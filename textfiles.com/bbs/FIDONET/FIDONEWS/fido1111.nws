   I had a longish arguement/discussion/thread with a local
bussinessman on one of the local echos this week.  It started
with the intervention of the moderator to a new user, progressed
quickley to the standard clash of power-tripping vs
Free-Speech thread number 6, and then nicely evolved into a
disscussion of Fido philosophy, and why the echos had been set
up like they have been.

   Several things occured to me during the whole thing.  First
of all, Fidonet is growing up.  I see far less flames, and far
more literate and interesting posts.  The crowd seems to be
older.  Secondly, there are a lot of people that are new to the
net, and do not understand the beginnings of Fido,  or why
things are set up the way they are.

   Fido is ten years old this year.

Marge Robbins @ mrobbins@wps.com is writting a book on Fido's
history,  and portions of that research will be published
here.  I would like to ask some of the old-timers to start
thinking of articles.  We want to hear why you got involved, and
what you want the net to look like.  What you think the
strengths and weaknesses are.  What you think we should do about
them.

enditorial by me:  1:1/23

hello.  i was supposed to reply to last week's plea for lack of
expletives now, but i can't because i'm lying, passed out, on the
couch.  i should mention what i might have said, anyway, for fun.
I'm only dreaming, though, so this doesn't count as part of our
argument game.

i'm becoming <bemused> somewhat paranoiac, bopping around amidst the
electric <sic.> community because i do not know what is real anymore.
i used to see by-lines, serious looking news announcers in suit
jackets, and recognizable titles of journals with academic reputations.
I don't see those things much, on the net.  I no longer have a
preconceived, subconsciously accepted and exclusive list of sources for
"truth" which i could always depend upon to provide me with a framework
for telling differences between "normality" and "otherwise".  Hence i'm
lible to believe anything.

i'm writing this with a pen on the back of an envelope which was used
to convey an issue of ANIMADVERSE, an anarchist journal with a box
number address and no names on anything.  Why should i believe any of
the news in it?  I can't point a finger at a writer and hold them to
their version of truth.  [Actually, i like this kind of publication
because it has a personal style to it, like net mail and unlike big
media stuff.  I'd rather learn from people than from spewing robots.]

How can i tell the difference between urban myth and real statements
of facts?  I need to know the difference between those things, so i
can know what things require action and judgements and which things
FidoNews 11-11                 Page:  3                    14 Mar 1994

should inspire only laughter, right?  Don't i need to know this?  Do
i need semeone to tell me which is which?  Before the net made so
much information instantly available, i had institutions and figures
to lend credence to stuff, right?

K, so, maybe i am suspicious of how good a job such entities have been
doing of thinking for me, but at least i didn't have to be personally
responsibe for my beliefs if i didn't want to be liable for them.   And
i don't have those any more!  I have no more excuses.  Now i have to be
my own institutions and everything.  The net makes me NEED to hone
whatever facilities i might innately discover for making choices about
what to believe.

oh - about the "expletive"..  Which expletive?

The only true curse on the net is untruth.

The History of Fidonet another progress report
By Marge Robbins
1:283/120 or mrobbins@wps.com

So many exciting things have happened since last I wrote for the
snooze I scarcely know where to begin.  Tom Jennings <Who I don't
think knows how to say no> has sent me a whole box of items from
Fidonet's past. Some have, compliments of NC283 Keith Sippy, been
turned into JPGs and will eventually become available to all
interested parties.

NC107 Burt Juda has made available diskspace on ftp.fidonet.org as a
permanent home for the files I have been accumulating.  Some files
are there now, available by anonymous FTP, and others are on their
way.  Once they are approved by TJ I will be uploading some of the
JPGs to that site. I would also like to make the collection available
via freq from  several Fidonet systems around the country. If anyone
who has lots of disk space would like to volunteer please contact me.
You must be willing to commit at least 30mg to be on the safe side.
The snoozes alone are 10.

You can keep track of what is new in one of several ways. FTP there
of course change to pub/fidonet/history and issue the directory
command. OR gopher to ftp.fidonet.org and see what's in my directory.
On the Gopher menu the item you want is Fidonet History.

Due to Mr. Jenning's generosity and earnest desire to help in any
way<he really has been wonderful folks>, I have a more or less
permanent account on WPS.COM.  This morning I spent a considerable
amount of time playing <read that fighting> with his mail program and
now have a functional fake mailing list set up for this project.
Anyone who wants to keep up to date on this project can be added to
my mailing list.  Just contact me on WPS.COM.

I suppose since the Internet tends to be very confusing to most of us
<Me included and I've been romping on it for almost a year now> it
FidoNews 11-11                 Page:  4                    14 Mar 1994

might be a good idea for me to digress and give some basic
instructions. If you have an internet address, use it and skip this
paragraph.  I'm at mrobbins@wps.com.    If you are stuck with a
Fidonet address and want to receive my progress reports send a netmail
message in the following fashion...  To: UUCP  at 1:1/31.  ON THE
FIRST LINE in the body of the message put to: mrobbins@wps.com. And
yes, I do get mail at 283/120 but am not as likely to act on it in as
timely manner as I am something that shows up on WPS.COM.

My current project is slogging through a 1 mg+ file of articles I
have culled from back issues of the snooze. sorting and indexing.
Some are historical, some of just human interest.  Here's one of my
favorites.  Fidonet's first baby.

        ------------------------------------------------------------
                             The First FidoBaby

        Ken Kaplan (Fido 51) and his wife Sally now have the first
        official FidoBaby, named Eric Samuel Kaplan.  Sally wants to
        wait for awhile before she'll let Ken assign him a node
        number.

        We'd like to welcome Eric as the newest and youngest member
        of the growing Fido family, and offer him our best wishes.
        We'd also like to extend our congratulations to Ken and
        Sally.
       _________________________________________________________________

And just as a fire won't burn in a vacuum, this project would be
going nowhere fast without lots of good help. All of the folks in the
following list have contributed in some way, from helpful
suggestions, to donations of files, to sharing of memories to Burt
and Tom contributing time, disk space and memories.  My thanks to
all.  If you have helped in any way and are not on this list, please
accept my apologies and contact me so I can add you.

What did Robert Robertson say again?  Oh yeah...

RR> Unnecessary Expletives.

RR> I was reading the February 21, 1994 (Vol 11 No 8)
RR> edition of Fidonews and was shocked to see the use of
RR> an inflammatory word in the editorial.  If you're
RR> wondering what word, go back and read it for yourself.
RR> There are many young users who read Fidonews.  I've
RR> always enjoyed reading Fidonews, but this type of
RR> language is totally unnecessary.  On our board, we try
RR> to maintain a family type atmosphere and when a young
RR> user or anyone else can go to the bulletin menu and
RR> read this type of trash does not give Fidonet and the
RR> BBS community a very good image.  I hope that in the
RR> future that the editors will delete these unnecessary
RR> expletives.
RR>
RR> Robert Robertson 1:3607/5
RR> eobytes!robert@vulcan.com

Okay Robert....now that we've started in on Fidonews...let's
start in on American television.  And then American radio.
Now, let's go after the satellite feeds to require that all
messages be pure and wholesome.  Now, let's go after all
international sources of profanity.  Okay, now let's go
after the American Constitution, and while we're at it...all
constitutions everywhere amending such with a clause saying
that all thought, actions and words must be bunnies and
light...without coarse or rough language.  Now, define
coarse or rough language.  Now try to enforce it. And while
we're at it, define unnecessary expletives.  I know some
people that think the word "Gee Whiz" is the height of
profanity.  I know others who use terms regularily that
would probably make my father blush.

What is unnecessary and vulgar to you does not apply to
the world, Robert.  And also, please keep in mind that you
are also reading what is essentially a public newsletter
sent out by two private individuals who have the right to
really print anything that they see fit to print.  And
speaking from personal experience, they probably are really
tired of seeing all these messages telling them what they can
or cannot print.

If you think that what they are printing is vulgar, then
fine...delete the Fidonews or else make it unavailable for
public viewing.  Or complain to your higher's up...you have
that right.  I personally see nothing wrong in what the
FidoNews prints...and have watched the editors bend over
FidoNews 11-11                 Page:  6                    14 Mar 1994

backwards to ensure that every party in FidoNet is equally
represented. No matter how distasteful that taste may have
been to themselves personally at times...their
responsibilities to their readers is upheld, and they stick
by what they print.  If you have a problem with that idea,
then by all means...censor what goes into your BBS so that the
BBS world for your users conforms to what you feel it should
be.

Again, that is your right.

But with a world full of seedy dives, and seedier
characters...you're never going to get rid of vulgarity and
you're white-washing the world to attempt to cover the cracks
that will always be there.  And setting up anyone who sees
only that Care Bears and Teddy Ruxpin view of the world for a
really nasty fall someday.  Because by not educating those
that have less knowledge of the world than yourself...you
leave them open to exploitation and manipulation by those
who may not have their best interests at heart, as you
yourself undoubtedly do.  And let me tell you Robert...
there's nothing sadder to see than a glassy-eyed follower
who traipses along lemming-like behind some god-like figure.

You probably remember a similar incident that happened in
Waco, Texas, right?  An entire compound of people followed
one man to their deaths.

Therein lies the danger of control Robert...we have free
speech and freedom of expression to help prevent another
Stalin, or another Hitler.  It leaves us open to those
that would try to exploit others, surely.  And it leaves
us open to any sicko that wants to walk along the street
and proclaim that their view of the world is the only True
One.  But it also allows you free to say what you have to
say...and for me to reply to that opinion.  Whether you
agree with me or not is totally irrelevant...at least our
messages get across to others.  And be careful of who you
judge...you also fall short of other's standards.  As do I.
As does the FidoNet itself, and the FidoNews. As does every
creation of man on this planet or beyond it.  Because we're
HUMAN, and have human weaknesses and faults.

And that's why we here I guess...to learn to live with our
faults and to strive to overcome them.  To attempt to
become a more perfect being through religion, through
self-learning, through whatever method is right for that
person.  And you have the chance to do it Robert...thanks
to your history, your country, and your upbringing. Not all
are lucky enough to be able to say that in the sphere that
FidoNet encompasses.  Thank your blessings, and learn to
love others for their faults...as for their blessings.  And
the world will come a lot closer to being that bunnies and
light picture that you always wanted it to be.  Because the
key to freeing the world is to win the battle inside first
FidoNews 11-11                 Page:  7                    14 Mar 1994

and foremost.

...And I thought this was going to be simple....

COUNTRY Echo - Message with your friends in low places
COUNTRY Echo - Message with your friends in low places
by John Cosper  (1:123/302)

Problem:
You like Country music (no, this is not the problem).  The first
couple of bars from any song by Reba, Garth, or Dwight sends chills
down your spine and threatens to knock off your cowboy hat and spurs
(this is not the problem either).  But, if you look at the national
echo listing, there is not a national echo available to talk about
your favorite singers (at last, we get to the problem!).  You've
already been chased out of the CD_ECHO, MUSIC, and even
60S_70S_PROG_ROCK echos by Tori-Amos-worshipping, Axl-Rose-imitating,
alternative-listening metal maniacs.  What do you do??

Solution:
Pick up the COUNTRY echo!

The COUNTRY echo is now available from John Cosper at 1:123/302.  It
is already on the official backbone of Net 123 echos and is wanting
to expand its borders beyond the Memphis area.  Now is YOUR chance to
help a future national echo get off the ground and talk about Country
music with people who have actually seen the furniture at Graceland
and lived to tell about it!

Here are the requisite particulars...

Tag:       COUNTRY
Purpose:   The discussion of Country music
Moderator: John Cosper

Rules:
1.  This echo is for the discussion of all aspects of Country music.
    "SOME" chatter is expected and allowed, but too much will result
    in a message from the moderator.  Which brings us to #2...

2.  Let the moderator moderate.  Just because you may not see an
    official message from the moderator to a particular person
    does not mean the situation isn't being handled.  Your response
    to an off-topic message is also considered off-topic.

3.  The discussion of bootlegs or the unlawful copying or
    distributing of copyrighted material is forbidden.

4.  Flames are not permitted at any time.

5.  These rules are subject to change at any time.

So what are you waiting for??  Drop me a line at 1:123/302 today and
FidoNews 11-11                 Page:  8                    14 Mar 1994

start dissing Wynonnah's weight problem tomorrow!!  :)

This brings an end to my sales pitch.  Thanks for your time.

ANNOUNCEMENT:  NoSnail v1.10 for RBBS

ANNOUCEMENT:  NoSnail v1.10 for RBBS
by Eddie Rowe @ Fidonet#1:136/1.0

(Monroe, LA USA)  Just over a year after its initial release,
WER Development unveiled its latest update of its Fidonet & Internet
connectivity add-on for the RBBS-PC Bulletin Board System, NoSnail
version 1.10.

The NoSnail utility allows RBBS-PC sysops to grant OUTGOING netmail
access to Fidonet technology domains to their users without incurring
undo economic hardship from delivering the mail to the remote systems
scattered throughout the world.  Internet connectivity is possible by
utilizing a Fidonet to Internet gateway -- some users of NoSnail
operate such gateways themselves, while others use Fidonet connectivity
to move to remote gateways.  Since exported netmail may be written to
the *.PKT FTS-0001 standard or to the *.MSG format, NoSnail works with
virtually any Fidonet compliant mailer as well as the current range of
Fidonet compatible mail products.

New in the 1.10 release of NoSnail:

Ported to the "C" programming language from PDS 7.x
Enhanced Internet addressing for Fidonet <-> Internet traffic
External language file for non-English systems
Optional explicit OverMail support
Optional Domain addressing support
Solved random problems for OS/2 users (DOS Box)

Availability:

Submitted on 03/10/94 to the Simtel Archive Site (oak.oakland.edu)
for the ~pub/msdos/rbbs_pc/ directory as NOSN110.ZIP for those with
FTP access.  As of this writing it is not yet been posted to the
rbbs_pc directory for download.

Fidonet members may File Request NOSN110.ZIP from any Planet Connect
or Filebone downlink participating in the RBBS File Distribution
Network (RBBSMAIL area).

Any FTN capable system may File Request from the WER Development
Support BBS @ Fidonet#1:136/1.0 at v.32bis & ZyXEL 19.2k speeds,
or Fidonet#1:136/2.0 at v.32bis and HST 16.8k speeds using the
complete filename NOSN110.ZIP
FidoNews 11-11                 Page:  9                    14 Mar 1994


The WER Development Support BBS may be accessed at 318-325-6608
where NoSnail may be downloaded on anyone's first call without any
complicated registration process.
