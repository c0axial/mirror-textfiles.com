     Q: Hey!  How did this guy get to be Editor of the FidoNews?  What kind
     of new conspiracy is at work here?  Just who does he think he is?

     A: Me?  I'm just your humble FidoNews Editor.  I have volunteered for
     this post every time it has become available.  The latest offer was
     made to Donald Tees before he unceremoniously disappeared from here
     and from FidoNet completely.  After five weeks of no FidoNews, I
     volunteered again to ZC1 who maintains the administrative listing for
     the FidoNews Editor slot at 1:1/23.  ZC1, being familiar with my
     previous volunteerings and my general capabilities to string cogent
     sentences together, said, "Thanks, and you've got it."

     It's no big mystery or conspiracy.  There was a job to be done that
     wasn't getting done and now it is. [grin]

     Who am I, you ask?

     I am a longtime FidoNet Node and former NC and RC.  I have written
     many articles for FidoNews in the past.  I have watched FidoNet grow
     and change since I first picked up a copy of the software that started
     it all - Fido [9c was my first version] in 1984.  I host and moderate
     many international Echos and several fileechos.  I have attended
     FidoCon when it was a FidoNet event and broken bread with many of the
     ancient ones.  In some circles, even I am considered one of the
     ancient ones. [grin]

     Judge for yourself whether the stewardship of FidoNews is in good
     hands or not by the content and distribution of the latest issues.

     If you have any other questions, feel free to send me Netmail to
     1:374/14, or email to cbaker84@digital.net, or join me in the FIDONEWS
     Echo which is now available on the Zone 1 Backbone.  I answer all mail
     within 24 hours, as a rule, and often within minutes of its receipt.

      NOTE:  There are two new sections in FidoNews this week.  [The old
             FidoNet Software listing will be reactivated in the next
             issue.]

             FidoNet History [.HIS] and FidoNet Biographies [.BIO] appear
             in this issue.  Everyone is encouraged to tell their stories
             of FidoNet in these new sections. ARTSPEC.DOC has been updated
             with the new section extensions and ARTSPEC is enclosed in
             this Issue's archive.

     =================================================================

     Dropping like flies? (Part 1 of ?)
     Shawn K. Quinn (1:106/4301 or skquinn@brokersys.com)

     It had been several months since I had read FidoNews until fairly
     recently. I grab the first 20 issues of the year and it seems like
     every week there's some kind of article about the lack of growth, or
     the outright decrease of the number of nodes in the nodelist. What
     kind of surprised me was a recent article showing that zone 2 now has
     more nodes than zone 1 by ~3000 or so. Given British Telecom's well-
     intended but rather out-of-date goal of making a national data network
     that runs at the positively blinding speed (yeah right) of 2400 bps,
     and the general lack of Internet connectivity abroad compared to the
     US (at least from what I read a few months ago), it kind of makes
     sense.

     But the real surprise, is that there is obviously still a place for
     the hobbyist BBS medium. The problem is, that the Internet is starting
     to be where the action is. On the Internet you can "call" places with
     telnet anywhere you wish, without any long-distance fees. It kind of
     blows the idea of "local" BBSes out of the water, which has
     historically been a strong feature of BBSes. Kind of hard to have
     a local BBS on the Internet, when already you have people
     cross-posting something to every "local" *.general Usenet newsgroup in
     sight.

     The advantage, though, is wider exposure. However, this blows even
     more old paradigms out of the water. Voice or callback validation?
     Maybe, replace it with e-mail validation (at least on one BBS I've
     logged onto via telnet, this has been done). And what about spam that
     has already pretty much ruined Usenet? It's bad enough when we get BBS
     ads in local general chat echos. What about pay BBSes? I mean, you
     have IRC, so chat boards will probably not do very well on the
     Internet. Any type of adult board will probably not last long either,
     as there are already tons of free adult-oriented web sites and
     newsgroups.

     Is the entire BBS paradigm outdated? Or is it possible to run a
     BBS for the purpose of providing limited Internet access to those who
     can't afford a commercial provider? Is it feasible to offer free
     Internet e-mail via the FidoNet gateway as an alternative to Juno and
     Freemark?

     The shutdown of the default Internet gateway at 1:1/31 was,
     admittedly, something of a step backward. But given the reasons it
     happened, I can't blame Burt for doing it. For an alarmingly similar
     reason, I have been very tempted to shut down my BBS and concentrate
     completely on the Internet.

     But now that local FidoNet politics have appeared to die down somewhat
     (or at least involve others) I kind of like what FidoNet has become.
     My concern is Policy 4. It's (IMHO) seriously outdated. There are
     things in it that were based on paradigms that were valid when FidoNet

     was less than one-sixth the size it is now.

     One such example is the fact that a sysop is responsible for all
     traffic that passes through his/her node. This is a problem because of
     the potential for legal liability by monitoring everything that passes
     through. The opinions I have read are that unless one does indeed
     monitor everything passing through one's system, there is no legal
     liability incurred. The annoying ECPA disclaimer is one of them. I got
     so tired of seeing it that I hung up on boards as soon as I saw it. I
     have run Polar Bear Hotel with completely private mail (not monitored)
     for the past year and a half. SecureMail has been in operation at
     least that long and thankfully has not suffered an untimely demise due
     to policy complaints.

     Another is geographic restrictions on nets, regions, and zones. I
     think that this is more of a problem than a solution to whatever
     problems existed 5+ years ago. I think if one's willing to pay the
     long distance charges to join another net, then by all means one
     should be able to. With the Internet, geography won't be an issue any
     longer anyway.

     Well, this rant has already reached the better part of 4K in length,
     so I'll leave off here for now. I labeled this part 1, because I may
     write again on this subject in a couple of weeks. Best of luck to all
     of you who enjoy the hobby of running a BBS and FidoNet node.

          Upon duly submitted and approved petition to the International
          Headquarters of the Universal Life Church, Inc., Elvis Aron
          Presley was named Saint of the Universal Life Church in
          November, 1988.  The petition to the church read as follows:

              Elvis exhibited faith and hope when, as a youngster,
              he pursued his talent as an entertainer despite the
              odds against rising from his humble beginnings. He
              exhibited charity by his obvious and documented
              generosity. All of these attributes of character are
              believed to have been present to an extraordinary
              degree by his followers.

         ----------------------------------------------------------------




                                 THERE's MORE!!!


               The CHURCH OF ELVIS is a sect of the Universal Life
                     Church and is looking for new ministers.



                                ABOUT MINISTERHOOD

     -- Is This For Real?

      Yes, it is.  The Universal Life Church will ordain anyone, for
     life, no questions asked, and at no cost.  The ordination is
     legally valid, and, after registering with local authorities, ULC
     Ministers can legally perform weddings, funerals, baptisms, etc.


     -- But I Have To Believe In Something Silly, Right?

      Nope.  The ULC doesn't impose ANY beliefs on it's Ministers or
     their congregations.  Your god is OK.  Period.


     -- Am I Making Any Promises?

      Only one.  A ULC Minister agrees to do what's "right".  You get
     to interpret "right" to your satisfaction.  No one will call to
     ask for money.  You're not joining a "cult."  You're welcome
     (encouraged!) to continue practicing whatever faith you like.
     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 7                   22 Jul 1996


     ULC Ministers are also Catholics, Episcopalians, Methodists,
     ELVIS Worshippers... you name it.


     -- So How Do I Become Ordained?

      Easy.  Just fill out the simple form below, or call
     CompuChurch (tm) and go to the Santuary then to the Altar
     Your info will be processed by CompuChurch (tm)
     International Headquarters.  CompuChurch will file your request
     with the ULC, and you'll receive your credentials within a
     coupla weeks.  It's free, but we could use a stamp! Canadian Pilgrims
     could send 2 stamps!


     -- Still A Little Wary?

      There's more information on the ULC at any CompuChurch (tm)
     Chartered BBS, from The Church of Elvis or from CompuChurch (tm)
     International Headquarters, 1:3800/6 or call direct at (504) 927-
     4509.

     BBSes are filled with ULC Ministers from all walks of life. Join
     us!

        -----------------------------------------------------------------

     * MAKE ME A MINISTER!

     Yes, this all sounds wonderful. I want to be a minister, fully
     ordained and authorized to do anything ministers usually do, and
     entitled to the privileges and benefits extended to the clergy.

     Grand Prix Pages on Fidonet
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     So often we hear about the death of Fidonet, and about what can be
     done about it.  To my mind, the answer is to provide something
     accessible to Fidonet nodes, points and users, which will keep their
     interest, and therefore, their presence in the network.  In this short
     article I intend to tell you about just such a thing.

     Formula 1 motor racing is a popular sport across the world.  The Grand
     Prix season consists of races held at tracks throughout the world,
     making it a truly international sport.  One of my points, John
     Suffill, has had the idea of making information about Formula 1 motor
     racing available via Fidonet.

     Those of you with a better memory than the average fish will recall
     that I submitted an article about my program InfoMail to Fidonews
     recently.  John has chosen the installation of InfoMail at my own
     system to make his Formula 1 information available, and the results
     are much like a small electronic magazine.

     The document includes a timetable for this year's Grand Prix season,
     showing the dates for each race.  A similar proposed timetable for
     next year is also included.  In addition to this, news and gossip
     about the drivers and teams is included, as is an editorial 'rant' (as
     John puts it).

     John updates the document after each race, and includes a run-down of
     the latest race, which includes the finishing positions of all the
     drivers.  The driver and team championship positions are updated at
     this time, so you can keep tabs on how your favourite driver and team
     are doing.

     I found the document very interesting, and on a more general note, I'd
     like to see more of this sort of thing being offered to Fidonet users
     on a variety of subjects.

     To obtain the GrandPrix document via routed netmail, send a message to
     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 10                  22 Jul 1996


     INFOMAIL at 2:2502/666 with the subject GRANDPRIX.  For a more
     immediate response you can file request GRANDPRIX from the same system
     (it's a magic name).

     Please welcome the Middle East

     By Ward Dossche
        ZC/2

     As of day-201 a new region has been added in the zone-2 portion
     of the world nodelist.

     I'm talking about Saudi-Arabia which will henceforth be known as
     region-54.

     The region is just starting-up and networking in that part of the
     world is a novel thing ... something like the early years of Fido
     revisited.

     Personally I am very excited about this.

     The region starts rather modest but already now is it certain
     that there will be a rapid initial growth.

     There will be 2 nets in the start-up phase, 2:541 for Riadh and
     2:542 for Jeddah. Other nets will be added when necessary. The
     first nodes are crashmail-capable.

     Who says Fidonet is dying? There are areas in the world where
     Fidonet is the only way for reasonable and affordable networking.

     here's my canned text from this Echo many moons ago:

     i was run down by a 73 y/o drunk in 1975. i was on my motorcycle going
     home from work at Randle-Eastern Ambulance in Miami, Florida and made
     it to S.W. 8th Street and almost 67 Ave. when this geriatric pinhead
     got to the intersection, he decided he needed to make a U-turn more
     than i needed to get home. he did and i was struck broadside. my leg
     was crushed from mid-calf, my foot nearly severed on the scene and the
     bike and me thrown across the street.

     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 12                  22 Jul 1996


     i hit and crushed a bus bench and the bike landed next to me with the
     frame twisted to ruin. i ended up with a post-knee amputation of the
     left leg, several fractured ribs, a concussion, and a comminuted
     fracture of the left ulna which had a 12" pin in it from elbow to
     mid-arm for two years. my helmet was cracked and had i not been
     wearing it, so would have been my head. [grin]

     i was out of work for two years and on Social Security Disability
     until i got the dispatching job with Dade County Fire & Rescue. now,
     i'm disabled again with a herniated disk at L5/S1 that i got courtesy
     of poor maintenance in the disabled stall of the bathroom at
     work. [sigh]

     i already couldn't stand and now i can't sit. kinda limits one's work
     options? [grin]

     i finally won my latest Social Security disability appeal. they called
     this morning to tell me my first check would come in Aug. that's a
     relief. [grin]

     i'm an expert on prothesis technology that doesn't work. [sigh]

     just in case you never read FidoNews or Echomail, i've been agitating
     and propagating FidoNet since the dim dawn of Net/Node installation
     many moons ago. before that all we had were plain sequential numbers
     and stone axes. [grin]

     i found Fido 9c on my console at work one day in 1984. i don't know
     where it came from but i know i was hooked from that day forward.

     after the shakeup to Net/Nodes [what a threat that was to many change
     haters], i was 18/14 in May of 1985. i started a Net [1:135] shortly
     after that and bullied a lot of the local, Miami Sysops who never
     heard of FidoNet into abandoning their old, non-network BBSes for
     Fido, and Opus and SEAdog. [grin]

     several years later, i was appointed RC18 by David Dodell who was
     anxious to get some movement going in Region 18. new Nets sprang up
     like weeds. i did that for about 18 months till an injury forced me to
     retire. Dodell appointed Ben Mann to replace me. [that was in the old

     my injury put me on the disabled rolls and i was forced to drop out of
     Net 135 and move up here to Titusville [Space Shuttle ring a bell?]. i
     became a private Node in Net 374 until my lawsuit against my previous
     employer [maybe you remember Metro Fire, 1:135/14?] was settled and i
     could relocate and setup a full system. i've been here for a couple of
     years.

     i'm still disabled but have plenty of time to devote to the pursuits
     of Coordination and when Ben decided to retire, i was drafted and ran
     for the post.

     i moderate and/or host several Backbone Echos and a couple private
     ones. i co-moderate several others. i'm no neophyte. [grin]

     i've done my share of Policy complaint arbitration and Echo delinking.

     FidoNet History and Operation     8 Feb 85
     Tom Jennings and many authors

     Part 1 of 3

                     This is a long and convoluted document; it has been
             sorely needed for months now, and it finally got done.
             FidoNet is growing at a tremendous rate, and newer sysops
             don't have the information that us oldies (pre Sept 84
             sysops) assume everyone knows; hence the history section
             here. There is a lot of extremely important material covered
             here that was assumed to be known by all; we are finding out
             otherwise.

                     This also covers some of the dark mysterious secrets
             about the magical node numbers, and how the magical node
             lists appear from nowhere. Those of you that have been
             FidoNet nodes since way back when, spring and summer of
             1984, and watched all this develop (such as it was) in full
             Technicolor, will know most of this; if you are a relatively
             new sysop, much of this may come as a suprise. Everyone
             should read this, experienced sysops, new sysops, and all
             Fido and FidoNet users.

                     FidoNet is no longer just a piece of software; it
             has become complex organism. There are about 160 Fidos in
             FidoNet right now; this does not include Fidos being run as
             Bulletin Board only systems, just ones that you can converse
             with over the net. If the average number of users on each
             system is 300 people, you can start to guess at the scale of
             things today.

             HISTORY:

                     When FidoNet was first tested, there were two nodes:
             myself here at Fido #1 in San Francisco, and John Madill at
             Fido #2 in Baltimore. John and I did all of the testing and
             development for the first pass at FidoNet. Its purpose: to
             see if it could be done, merely for the fun of it, like ham
             radio. It quickly became useful; instead of trying to call
             each others' boards up to leave messages, or expensive voice
             phone calls, Fidonet messages became more or less routine.

                     This was version 7 of Fido sometime in June 84 or
             so; it did not have routing, file attach, retry control,
             error handling, cost accounting, log files, or any of the
             niceties since added. A packet was made, a call placed, the
             packet transferred, that was it. This was adequate for a
             month or two, when there were less than 20 nodes.

                     In August of 84, the number of nodes was approaching
     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 16                  22 Jul 1996


             30; the net was becoming clogged, believe it or not. FidoNet
             wasn't too smart about making calls then. With 30 systems,
             coordination became difficult; instead of a simple voice
             phone call to the (very few!) sysops to straighten out
             problems like modems not answering, wrong numbers, clock
             problems, etc, it took days to get the slightest problem
             repaired. There were by now six nodes in St. Louis, and Fido
             #1 was making seperate phone calls for each, when obviously
             one could be made. Enter the beginnings of routing.

                     The "original" FidoNet was very simple and friendly;
             you told me at Fido #1 that you had a FidoNet node ready, I
             put you in the list, with your phone number, and people
             called up and downloaded the list; done!

                     Well ... at first, "everyone knew each other"; we
             were in more or less constant contact. However, when the
             node numbers got into the twenties, there were people
             bringing up FidoNodes who none of us knew. This was good,
             but it meant we were not in close contact anymore.

                     The Net started to deteriorate; every single week
             without fail there was at least one wrong number, usually
             two. To impress on you the seriousness of wrong numbers in
             the node list, imagine you are a poor old lady, who every
             single night is getting phone calls EVERY TWO MINUTES AT
             4:00AM, no one says anything, then hangs up. This actually
             happened; I would sit up and watch when there was mail that
             didn't go out for a week or two, and I'd pick up the phone
             after dialing, and was left in the embarrasing position of
             having to explain bulletin boards to an extremely tired,
             extremely annoyed person.

                     There were also cases where the new node really
             wasn't up yet, and the number given was a home phone to be
             used temporarily, but I'd forget that, and include it in the
             list anyways. Or the new node wasn't really up yet, and we'd
             all make calls to it and it would not answer, or worse, the
             modem would answer but the software wasn't running, and we'd
             get charged for the call.

                     This obviously could not go on. We had to have some
             way to make sure that at least the phone numbers were
             correct! I started a new policy; before giving out a node
             number and putting it in the list, I had to receive a
             FidoNet message from the new node, directly. This verified
             that at least the new Fido was half way running. At the
             time, Fido had a provision whereby Fido #1 could set the
             node number remotely; I'd send a message back, and presto! a
             new node was up.

                     Well, this didn't work properly either; at the same
             time, the Fido software was changing so rapidly, to
             accomodate all the changes (literally a version a day for a
             few weeks there) that I was losing new node requests, wrong
             numbers caused by illegible handwriting, all sorts of
     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 17                  22 Jul 1996


             problems. Out of laziness I would still assign nodes "word
             of mouth", and got in the same trouble as before.

                     The people in St. Louis (Tony Clark, Ben Baker, Ken
             Kaplan, Jon Wichman, Mike Mellinger) had their local Fidos
             going strong, and understood what FidoNet did, how it
             worked, and what it was about. They volunteered to take over
             the node list, handle new node requests, and leave me with
             the software. They tightened up on the FidoNet message
             requirement, and in a few months, had the "error rate"
             (wrong numbers, etc) down to practically zero, where it is
             today.

                     Though I did the programming, Ken Kaplan, Ben Baker,
             and the crowd in St. Louis did much of the design and most
             of the testing of routing, forwarding, and local nets. They
             still remain the experts on the intricacies of routing, and
             help sysops set up local nets.

                     Please keep in mind the entire process, from two
             nodes to over 50, took only three months! Fifty nodes is
             more than it sounds; at that level it becomes a large scale
             project. FidoNet went from about 50 nodes in Sept 84 or so,
             to the current 160+ in Jan/Feb of 85.

                     FidoNet today is a network quickly approaching the
             levels of complexity of commercial networks, and has many
             more capabilities than many "mini" networks, such as USENET,
             which has no routing or hosts. Only ARPAnet has some of the
             features of FidoNet. The southern California local network
             is three levels deep, with hosts in Orange, LA, Ventura, San
             Berdino and San Diego counties.

                     FidoNet is just too large today to run as an
             informal club. The potential for error is just too high to
             include numbers at random within the node list. I imagine we
             are in a predicament today what the radio ameteur operators
             had a number of years ago.

                     The requirements for new FidoNet nodes are pretty
             minimal, and they appear to be arbitrary and harsh if you
             aren't aware of what's going on. This is to spell them out
             in detail, so everyone will understand the process.

             FidoNet'S PURPOSE:

                     Very simple; it is a hobby, a non-commercial network
             of computer hobbiests ("hackers", in the older, original
             meaning) who want to play with, and find uses for, packet
             switch networking. It is not a commercial venture in any
             way; FidoNet is totally supported by it's users and sysops,
             and in many ways is similar to ham radio, in that other than
             a few "stiff" rules, each sysop runs their system in any way
             they please, for any reason they want.

             THE STIFF RULES:
     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 18                  22 Jul 1996


                     Actually, not as bad as it sounds; basically,
             politeness as a rule:

             1.      New nodes, see below.

             2.      If your system is going to be down for a week or
                     more, please let Fido 51 know. They can take you
                     out of the list while you are gone, so other FidoNet
                     sysops won't be wasting phone calls.

             3.      If you change your phone number, or decide to stop
                     running Fido, let them know, so other FidoNet sysops
                     won't be wasting phone calls.

                     The thing to keep in mind is that FidoNet's
             telephone calls to send mail are costing someone money; if
             you are down just for a night or so, don't worry about it,
             just make sure your modem doesn't answer.

             THE NODE LIST

                     Obviously (if you are a FidoNet sysop that is) the
             node list is a text file containing all the names, phone
             numbers and other things on each node, and as distributed by
             Fido 51, routing information for the many local networks. It
             is a very compact list, and so there is no clue as to how
             that list is made.

                     Here is the current process for new nodes to obtain
             a node number, and get into the node list. This assumes you
             want to run a public access Fido; specialized systems are
             covered seperately, below.


             SET UP FIDO

                     Of course, you should get your Fido running first;
             no sense in trying to run mail if your Fido doesn't run! In
             your FidoNet area, enter a message for Fido #51, and include
             the following information:

             1.      Your boards name
             2.      City and state
             3.      Sysops name
             4.      Board phone number
             5.      Maximum baud rate; 1200 assumed otherwise
             6.      Hours of operation; 24 hrs assumed otherwise
             7.      Way to contact the sysop during the day. This is
                     not absolutely necessary, but it makes it easier
                     if there is some problem.

                     Most of this is pretty obvious. The sysops voice
             phone number will be kept secret; it will not be given out.
             It is only used if there is some problem, and a FidoNet
             message can't be sent for some reason.

     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 19                  22 Jul 1996


                     For Fidos that want to run with an unlisted phone
             number, a few other things are needed:

             8.      A public FidoNet to act as mail host
             9.      The systems actual phone number

                     A host is required for an unlisted number, so that
             you can receive mail. (If you don't want to receive mail,
             then there is no reason for you to be part of FidoNet!) The
             host system will have to have the unlisted phone number, of
             course.

                     Fido 51 needs to have the phone number also, but it
             will be kept secret. This is so that they can contact you
             directly if there is any problem, such as a known bug or a
             question, or if your host drops out of the network, so there
             is some way to contact the local nodes.

             GETTING A NODE NUMBER

                     This is the part that seems so arbitrary if you
             aren't aware of what's happening. What happens is: you send
             Fido 51 the message described above. When they receive it,
             they put the stuff into the node list and fido list, pick
             you a node number, and mail a copy of it to you the next
             weekend.

                     This tests your system at the same time; you have to
             be able to sucessfully send and receive mail in order to get
             the node number. Out of it, you get a copy of the latest
             lists.

             NOTE:   Fido 51 does not mail out copies of the lists to
             everyone on a regular basis; it would mean too many phone
             calls ($$$ ...). You can get the new node list Friday
             evening at Fidos 10 and 51, or Fidos 1 and 2 later that
             weekend or early the next week, and usually most any other
             busy Fido.

                     If it all works, then 1) you know your system is
             working 2) Fido 51, the node list keepers, knows it's
             working 3) the other 160 or so Fido sysops know that your
             system was working at least as recently as the last node
             list. Print out the last few weeks nodelists; compare all
             the changes, not just the additions.

                     This is why node numbers aren't given out "word of
             mouth", or at other sysops request. It has to be done
             directly, as a test.


             WHAT FIDO 51 REALLY DOES

                     Making the node list is more than just typing in the
             information; they make sure that the information in the list
             is accurate as possible. This frequently means voice phone

             calls to double check, or calls to the new system to see
             what the problem is; sometimes it is as simple as the wrong
             baud rate, the time wrong on the new system, so that it is
             not running FidoNet at the right time.

                     Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker do the node list work when
             they have "spare time"; please be patient! As the number of
             new nodes increases every week, response time goes up.
             Currently, the node list is done once a week; new node
             requests must be received in Wednesday nights mail (by
             Thursday morning) so that they can work on it Thursday
             night, and send it out on Friday night, so that you will
             have it over the weekend. The volume of mail is such that it
             may take a few days to get out.

                     (Please note that Fido 51 is an unattended node;
             there is no one there to answer Y)ells unless someone
             happens to walk by. The machine is located at Data Research
             Associates, who kindly donated the phone line, and runs on a
             DEC Rainbow 100+, donated by Digital Equipment Corp.)

                     Fido 51 is an extremely busy system; they receive
             125 messages a week through FidoNet alone, so please be
             patient.

             CHANGES, MISTAKES AND UPDATES

                     If you ever find wrong information in the node list,
             please send the information to Fido 51; they will include it
             in the next list.

                     If you become part of a local net, ie. you have an
             incoming host, notify them, and it will be included in the
             node list also. Other changes might be baud rate (got a new
             modem!) hours of operation, board name or sysop, etc.


             SOME OTHER THINGS ...

                     If you have questions or problems with any part of
             Fido or FidoNet, please ask. Here's where to go for
             problems:

             HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PERFORMANCE OR INSTALLATION TROUBLES

                     Call or FidoNet to Fido #1, me, Tom Jennings.
             FidoNet is best, if possible; that way, I have your "address
             and phone" handy. If not, then call Fido #1 and leave a
             message. If you leave it at G)oodbye, when you call back
             looking for a reply, remember to check in the ANSWERS area;
             Fido will NOT tell you if there is mail for you, you have to
             search for it.

                     Fido #1 always has the latest versions of Fido for
             all hardware supported, available for download. Fido #1
             ALWAYS runs one revision later than the released version; it
     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 21                  22 Jul 1996


             is used to test new features or bug fixes, so that when
             released they will be working. Check the FIDO download area
             for the current Fido version.

                     I have nothing to do anymore with maintaining the
             node list, nor do I hand out node numbers.


             ROUTING, NODE LIST, LOCAL NET QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS

                     Fido 51. Since they keep the list, they're the ones
             to contact for node list problems. If you want advice on how
             to set up a local net in your area, they can offer help and
             advice.


             SPECIALIZED SYSTEMS

                     If you are setting up a private network, and it is
             to be truly private, what you do with it is your own
             business. If, however, there is any possiblility that
             members of your private network may wish to communicate with
             any members of the public network, you should contact Fido
             51 for the allocation of a block of node numbers to be
             assigned by you to the nodes in your network. This is to
             avoid node number conflicts upon receipt of FidoNet mail in
             the public network.

             LOCAL NETS

                     Neither I nor Ken Kaplan nor Ben Baker "run"
             FidoNet; local networks such as the one in Southern
             California and Massachusetts are entirely the responsibility
             of the sysops in the area; the only thing we ask is that the
             designated "incoming host" for that area be somewhat
             reliable, for the obvious reason that it will be receiving
             lots of phone calls from across the country.

                     As a matter of fact, you are encouraged to form
             local networks, or join one that exists locally. IT makes it
             cheaper for other systems to send you mail, and generally
             streamlines FidoNet operation.

                     Other than that, local nets are totally standalone;
             that is what they are for! For instance, SoCal can run their
             net anyway they please; it is their hardware, their phone
             lines, and their phone bills. It is their investment in
             work, and they should reap the benefits. If there is a
             "FidoNet policy", this is it.

             AND SO ON ...

                     I hope FidoNet is a bit clearer now; if you have any
             suggestions, or want to volunteer to help, please let us
             know. Our only interest is in keeping the node list correct
             and up to date; this simple list is what ties the entire net

     The table below depicts the growth of the world nodelist as
     seen through the eyes of someone in Zone-2. Delays in pro-
     cessing inbound zone-segments are possible.

     Administrative entries as well as Pvt, Hold and Down are ommitted.
     Percentages have been rounded.

     ZEC-Election in Zone-2

     By Ward Dossche
        ZC/2

     If you happen to have the misfortune to be either an RC, a REC, an NC
     or a NEC in Zone-2, then this is meant for you. All others may skip
     this article.

     The first round in the ZEC-election is just over and I'm amazed by
     the unusual high turn-out of votes. Let nobody say any more that
     Fido-guys 'n gals are apathetic.

     Of course, Bill Birrell's effort to get all eligible voters to vote
     was tremendous. A "thank you" is already owed now to him and his team
     of verifiers Frank Ellerman and David Rance. And "thank you" also to
     Anton Kuznetsov for the tremendous help in spreading election announ-
     cements etc.

     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 24                  22 Jul 1996


     As might be expected a second round is needed in which Steve Woodmore
     of 2:440/410 and Dieter Soltau of 2:2448/69 will be the sole candida-
     tes.

     To be eligible as a voter in this run-off election one must be pro-
     perly listed in NODELIST.194. Properly means not Hold, Down nor Pvt.

     The voters will be identified as follows :

     * ZC/2 : the person holding the 2:2/0-AKA;
     * RC :   the people occupying the "2:region/0"-AKA;
     * REC :  the people flying the "U,REC"-flag. Only 1 REC per region is
              permitted and he/she _MUST_ fly this flag. Any local arran-
              gement of identification by system-name or a special node-
              number will be void.
     * NC :   the people occupying the "2:net/0"-AKA unless someone other
              than the host flies the "U,NC"-flag. Any other local arran-
              gement of identification by system-name or a special node-
              number will not be accepted.
     * NEC :  the people flying the "U,NEC"-flag. Only 1 NEC per net is
              permitted and he/she _MUST_ fly this flag. Any local arran-
              gement of identification by system-name or a special node-
              number will be void.

     The returning-officer will be Bill Birrel of 2:2504/200 again. He
     will be assisted by 2 verifiers of his choice, I understand that one
     of the previous verifiers is not available.

     The time-table from now on is :

     16.07.96-15.08.96 : Run-off election!
     00:00:00 23:59:59

     16.08.96 :          Pre-announcement of election result by the Retur-
     00:00:00            ning Officer

     16.08.96-31.08.96 : Period for adjustments (wrong counted votes, lost
     00:00:00 23:59:59   votes etc...)

     01.09.96 :          Appointment of ZEC/2 by ZC/2.
     00:00:00

     Although Echopol1 mentions nothing about individual sysops I hereby
     urge all elligible voters to poll their lower levels and respect this
     when casting a vote.

     At the end of this election-period the RO will publish an extensive
     list with results indicating in-extenso who voted for whom. This is
     done to make certain that sysops'-wishes are being followed.

     All other rules from round-1 remain unchanged.

                      **********  Begin Voting form **********
     You are eligible to vote in the ZEC run-off election. The candidates

     With advance apologies to anyone born under any sign of the Zodiac

                                       HOROSCOPE

          AQAURIUS: (Jan 20 - Feb 18)
                  You have an inventive mind and are inclined to be
          progressive.  You lie a great deal.  On the other hand, you are
          inclined to be careless and impractical, causing you to make the
          same mistakes over and over again.  People think you are stupid.

          PISCES:  (Feb 19 - Mar 20)
                  You have a vivid imagination and often think you are
          being followed by the FBI or CIA.  You have minor influence over
          your associates and people resent you for flaunting your power.
          You lack confidence and are generally a coward.  Pisces people do
          terrible things to small animals.

          ARIES:  (Mar 21 - Apr 19)
                  You are the pioneer type and hold most people in
          contempt.  You are quick tempered, impatient, and scornful of
          advice.  You are not very nice.

          TAURUS:  (Apr 20 - May 20)
                  You are practical and persistent.  You have a dogged
          determination and work like hell.  Most people think you are
          stubborn and bull-headed.  Taurus people have B.O. and fart alot.

          GEMINI:  (May 21 - Jun 20)
                  You are a quick and intelligent thinker.  People like you
          because you are bi-sexual.  However, you are inclined to expect
          too much for too little.  This means you are cheap.  Gemini's are
          known for committing incest.

          CANCER:  (Jun 21 - Jul 22)
                  You are sympathetic and understanding of other people's
          problems.  They think you are a sucker.  You are always putting
          things off.  That's why you will never make anything of yourself.
          Most welfare recipients are Cancer people.

          LEO:  (Jul 23 - Aug 22)
     FIDONEWS 13-30               Page 29                  22 Jul 1996


                  You consider yourself a born leader.  Others think you
          are pushy.  Most Leo people are bullies.  You are vain and
          dislike honest criticism.  Your arrogance is disgusting.  Leo
          people are thieves.

          VIRGO:  (Aug 23 - Sept 22)
                  You're the logical type and hate disorder.  This is nit-
          picking and is sickening to your friends.  You are cold and
          unemotional and sometimes fall asleep while making love.  Virgo's
          make good bus drivers.

          LIBRA:  (Sept 23 - Oct 22)
                  You are the artistic type and have a difficult time with
          reality.  If you are a man, you are more than likely a pedophile.
          Most Libra women are prostitutes.  Chances for employment and
          monetary gains are excellent.  All Libra's have venereal
          diseases.

          SCORPIO:  (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
                  You are shrewd in business and cannot be trusted.  You
          will achieve the pinnacle of success because of your total lack
          of ethics.  Most Scorpio's are murderers.

          SAGGITARIUS:  (Nov 22 - Dec 21)
                  You are optimistic and enthusiastic.  You have a reckless
          tendency to rely on luck because of your total lack of talent.
          The majority of Sagittarians are drunks or dope fiends.  People
          laugh at you a great deal.

          CAPRICORN:      (Dec 22 - Jan 19)
                  You are conservative and afraid of taking risks.  You
          don't do much of anything and are lazy.  There has never been a
          Capricorn of any importance.  Capricorn's should avoid standing
          still too long as a dog might think you are a tree and piss on
          you.
