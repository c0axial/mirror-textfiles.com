     Below you will find the proposed update to the nodelist flags.
     This proposal will be open to public comment for a period of
     fourteen days from the date it appears in FidoNews.  Please
     direct all constructive comments to Rick Moore,  1:115/333.
     Please don't waste your time and effort with complete rewrites of
     this document.  What I am looking for is small detail revisions
     that will make it a better document,  not a complete rewrite.
     While I am sure this document will not please anyone completely,
     it represents the sum of several months of discussion by the
     FTSC,  followed by several rounds of revision by myself and the
     FidoNet International Coordinator.

     A few words concerning the objectives in this update are in
     order.  First,  there was a concerted effort to minimize the size
     of the nodelist,  which is growing at a very rapid rate.
     Second,  there was a clear concensus in the FTSC to limit the
     content in the nodelist to that needed by FidoNet nodes,  rather
     than a humanly readable BBS list.  Third,  there was great demand
     to include modem data,  expand the data concerning types of
     file-request/update supported,  provide a flag to denote gateways
     to other network domains,  and provide a mechanism by which
     nonstandard data could be included into a nodelist entry.  Last,
     and this was my own desire,  I tried to make these flags upwardly
     compatible with the flags used in the AlterNet nodelist,  where
     possible.

     A machine readable version of this document is available at
     1:115/333 as FSC-0027.ARC.  Special machine readable versions in
     either MultiMate or DCA/RFT (Document Content Architecture /
     Revised Form Text) format are available upon special request.

     This document is a proposed update for the document known under
     the names of FSC002-4,  FSC-0002,  and FTS-0002.

     This document defines the format and content of the nodelist for
     FidoNews 5-49                Page 2                    5 Dec 1988


     the Public FidoNet Network (PFN) as published each Friday.

     The PFN is an international network of independently owned
     electronic mail systems, most with interlocking electronic
     bulletin board systems.  The distribution nodelist, or simply
     "nodelist," is the glue which holds the network together.  It is
     the PFN's "phone book" and it defines the top-level network
     structure.

     The nodelist is published as an ASCII text file named
     NODELIST.nnn,  where nnn is the day-of-year of the Friday
     publication date.  This file is packed into an archive file (by
     System Enhancement Associates' ARC utility) named NODELIST.Ann,
     where nn are the last two digits of day-of-year.

     A companion file,  COORD.nnn, lists the coordinators of the
     various regions and local networks which constitute the PFN. This
     file may be created from NODELIST.nnn by the program COORD.EXE,
     distributed by many PFN bulletin boards.

     As stated above, NODELIST.nnn is an ASCII text file.  It contains
     two kinds of lines, comment lines and data lines.  Each line is
     terminated with an ASCII carriage return and line feed character
     sequence,  and contains no trailing white-space (spaces, tabs,
     etc.).  The file is terminated with an end-of-file character (EOF
     = decimal character value 26).

     Comments lines contain a semicolon (;) in the first character
     position followed by zero or more alphabetic characters called
     "interest flags."  A program which processes the nodelist may use
     comment interest flags to determine the disposition of a comment
     line.  The remainder of a comment line (with one exception,
     treated below) is free-form ASCII text.  There are five interest
     flags defined as follows:

          ;S This comment is of particular interest to Sysops.

          ;U This comment is of particular interest to BBS users.

          ;F This comment should appear in any formatted "Fido List."

          ;A This comment is of general interest (shorthand for ;SUF).

          ;E This comment is an error message inserted by the nodelist
               generating program MakeNL.

          ; This comment may be ignored by a nodelist processor.

     The first line of a nodelist is a special comment line containing
     identification data for the particular edition of the nodelist.
     The following is an example of the first line of a nodelist:

     ;A FidoNet Nodelist for Friday, July 3, 1987 --
          Day number 184 : 15943

     This line contains the general interest flag,  the day,  date,
     FidoNews 5-49                Page 3                    5 Dec 1988


     and day-of-year number of publication,  and ends with a 5-digit
     decimal number with leading zeros,  if necessary.  This number is
     the decimal representation of a check value derived as follows:

          Beginning with the first character of the second line,  a
          16-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is calculated for the
          entire file, including carriage return and line feed
          characters,  but not including the terminating EOF
          character.  The check polynomial used is the same one used
          for many file transfer protocols:

               2**16 + 2**12 + 2**5 + 2**0

     The CRC may be used to verify that the file has not been edited.
     The importance of this will become evident in the discussion of
     NODEDIFF,  below.  CRC calculation techniques are well documented
     in the literature,  and will not be treated further here.

     The content of the remaining comments in the nodelist are
     intended to be informative.  Beyond the use of interest flags for
     distribution,  a processing program need not have any interest in
     them.

     A nodelist data line contains eight variable length "fields"
     separated by commas (,).  No space characters are allowed in a
     data line,  and underscore characters are used in lieu of spaces.
     The following discussion defines the contents of each field in a
     data line.


     Field 1: Keyword

     The keyword field may be empty,  or may contain one of the
     following:

          Zone --
               Begins the definition of a geographic zone and define
               its coordinator.  All the data lines following a line
               with the "Zone" keyword down to,  but not including the

               next occurrence of a "Zone" keyword,  are regions,
               nets and nodes within the defined zone.

          Region --
               Begins the definition of a geographic region and
               defines its coordinator.  All the data lines following
               a line with the "Region" keyword down to,  but not
               including the next occurrence of a "Region" or "Host"
               keyword, are independent nodes within the defined
               region.

          Host --
               Begins the definition of a local network and defines
               its host.  All the data lines following a line with the
               "Host" keyword down to,  but not including the next
               occurrence of a "Region" or "Host" keyword,  are local
     FidoNews 5-49                Page 4                    5 Dec 1988


               nodes,  members of the defined local network.  The
               difference between a region and a local network is in
               the routing of messages.  A message addressed to a
               member of a region is sent  direct to the addressee,
               while a message to a member of a local network is sent
               to the network host.

          Hub --
               Begins the definition of a routing subunit within a
               multilevel local  network.  The hub is the routing
               focal point for nodes listed below it until the next
               occurrence of a "Hub",  "Region",  "Host",  or "Zone"
               keyword.  The hub entry MUST be a redundant entry,
               with a unique number,  for one of the nodes listed
               below it.  This is necessary because some nodelist
               processors eliminate these entries in all but the local
               network.

          Pvt --
               Defines a private node with unlisted number.  Private
               nodes are only allowed as members of local networks.

          Hold --
               Defines a  node which  is temporarily down.  Mail may
               be sent to it and is held by its host or coordinator.

          Down --
               Defines a node which is not operational.  Mail may NOT
               be sent  to it.  This keyword  may not be used for
               longer than two weeks on any single node,  at which
               point the "down" node is to be removed from the
               nodelist.

          <empty> --
               Defines a normal node entry.

     Field 2 - Net/Node number

          This field contains only numeric digits and is a number in
          the range of 0 to 32767.  If the line had the "Zone",
          "Region",  or "Host" keyword,  the number is the zone,
          net,  or region number,  and the node has an implied node
          number of 0.  Otherwise,  the number is the node number.
          The zone number,  region or net number,  and the node
          number,  taken together,  constitutes a node's FidoNet
          address.

          Zone numbers must be unique.  Region or net numbers must be
          unique within their zone.  Other numbers must be unique
          within their respective units.

     Field 3 - Node name

          This field may contain any characters except commas and
          spaces.  Underscores are used to represent spaces.  This is
          the name by which the node is known.
     FidoNews 5-49                Page 5                    5 Dec 1988


     Field 4 - Location

          This field may contain any characters except commas and
          spaces. Underscores are used to represent spaces.  This
          field contains the location of the  node.  In the USA it is
          typically "City_ST where ST is the standard two-letter
          abbreviation for the state.

     Field 5 - Sysop name

          This field may contain any characters except commas and
          spaces.  Underscores are used to represent spaces.  This is
          the name of the system operator.

     Field 6 - Phone number

          This field contains at least three and usually four numeric
          subfields separated by dashes (-).  The fields are country
          code (1 for USA and Canada),  city or area code,  exchange
          code,  and number.  The various parts of the phone number
          are frequently used to derive cost and routing information,
          as well as what number is to be dialed.  A typical example
          of the data in a phone number field is 1-800-555-1212,
          corresponding to country 1  (USA),  area 800 (inbound
          WATS),  exchange 555,  and number 1212.

          Alternatively,  this field may contain the notation
          "-Unpublished-" in the case of a private node.  In this
          case,  the keyword "Pvt" must appear on the line.

     Field 7 - Baud rate

          This field contains one of the values:  300,  1200,  2400,
          or 9600,  and defines the maximum baud rate supported by the
          node.

     Field 8 - Flags

          This optional field contains data about the specific
          operation of the node,  such as file requests,  modem
          protocol supported,  etc.  Any text following the sixth
          comma on a data line is taken collectively to be the flags
          field.  The required format is zero or more subfields,
          separated by commas,  consisting of a flag,  possibly
          followed by a value.


          The following flags define special operating conditions:

               Flag      Meaning

               CM        Node accepts mail 24 hours a day
               MO        Node does not accept human callers


          The following flags define modem protocols supported:

                    NOTE:  Many V22 modems also support Bell 212A.

               If no modem flag is given,  Bell 212A is assumed for
               1200 bps systems,  CCITT V22bis is assumed for 2400 bps
               systems.


          The following flags define type of error correction
          available.  A separate error correction flag should not be
          used when the error correction type can be determined by the
          modem flag.  For instance,  a modem flag of HST implies MNP.

               Flag      Meaning

               MNP       Microcom Networking Protocol error correction
               V42       LAP-M error correction w/fallback to MNP


          The following flags define the type(s) of compression of
          mail packets supported.

               Flag      Meaning

               MN        No compression supported

                         NOTE:  The only compression method supported
                         by FidoNet at this time is SEA's ARC,  as
                         defined by the specs for ARCMail 0.6.  When
                         other types of mail compression are adopted,
                         indicators for them will be added.  For now,
                         the absence of a compression flag indicates
                         that ARCMail 0.6 compression is supported.


          The following  flags  indicate  the types of file/update
          requests supported.

               Flag      Meaning

               XA        Bark and WaZOO file/update requests
               XB        Bark file/update requests,  WaZOO file

          The following flag defines gateways to other domains
          (networks).

               Flag      Meaning

               Gx        Gateway to domain 'x' where 'x` is  a value
                         from 'A' to 'Z` or `1' to '9'.

                         NOTE:  Valid values of 'x' are assigned by
                         the FidoNet International Coordinator.
                         Current valid values of 'x' may be found in
                         the notes at the end of the current FidoNet
                         nodelist.


          The following  flags define the dedicated mail periods
          supported. They have the form "#nn" or !nn where nn is the
          UTC hour the mail period begins, # indicates Bell 212A
          compatibility and ! indicates incompatibility with Bell
          212A.

               Flag      Meaning

               #02       Zone 2 mail hour (02:30 - 03:30 UTC)
               #09       Zone 1 mail hour (09:00 - 10:00 UTC)
               #18       Zone 3 mail hour (18:00 - 19:00 UTC)

                         NOTE:  When applicable,  the mail period
                         flags may be strung together with no
                         intervening commas,  eg.  "#02#09".  Only
                         mail hours other than that standard within a
                         node's zone should be given.  Since
                         observance of mail hour within one's zone is
                         mandatory,  it should not be indicated.


          The following flag defines user-specific values. If
          present,  this flag MUST be the last flag present in a
          nodelist entry.

               Flag      Meaning

               Ux..x     A user-specified string,  which  may  contain
                         any character except blanks.  This string may
                         contain one to thirty-two characters of
                         information that may be used to add
                         user-defined data to a specific nodelist
                         entry.  This string may not contain any flags
                         already defined in this document.  FTSC makes
                         no guarantee that it will not assign an
                         unused letter/number to new flags.  Certain
                         unused flags are already reserved - see the
     FidoNews 5-49                Page 8                    5 Dec 1988


                         list below.


          The following flags are reserved for future planned
          expansion of existing flags:  Mx and Px (where 'x' is any
          valid character).  This is not meant to imply that FTSC will
          not use any to use any other character sequences,  and FTSC
          reserves the right to assign any flag deemed necessary.


          The FTSC recognizes that the FidoNet International
          Coordinator is the ultimate authority over what appears in
          the FidoNet nodelist. Also,  the FTSC is by definition a
          deliberative body,  and adding or changing a flag may take a
          considerable amount of time.  Therefore,  the FidoNet
          International Coordinator may temporarily make changes or
          additions to the flags as defined in this document.  The
          FidoNet International Coordinator will then consult with
          the FTSC over the changes needed to this document to reflect
          these temporary changes.



          The following are examples of nodelist data lines:

     Host,102,SOCALNET,Los_Angeles_CA,John_Doe,1-213-874-9484,2400,XP
     ,101,Rainbow_Data,Culver_City_CA,Don_Brauns,1-213-204-2996,2400,



     With more than a thousand nodes,  the nodelist,  even in archive
     form,  is a substantial document (or file).  Since distribution
     is via electronic file transfer,  this file is NOT routinely
     distributed.  Instead,  when a new nodelist is prepared,  it is
     compared with the previous week's nodelist,  and a file
     containing only the differences is created and distributed.

     The distribution file,  called NODEDIFF.nnn,  where nnn is the
     day-of-year of publication,  is actually an editing script which
     will transform the previous week's nodelist into the current
     nodelist.  A definition of its format follows:

     The first line of NODEDIFF.nnn is an exact copy of the first line
     of LAST WEEK'S nodelist.  This is used as a first-level
     confidence check to insure that the right file is being edited.
     The second and subsequent lines are editing commands and editing
     data.

     There are three editing commands and all have the same format:

               <command><number>

          <command> is a 1-letter command;  A,  C,  or D.  <number> is
          a decimal number greater than zero,  and defines the number
          of lines to be operated on by the command.  Each command
          appears on a line by itself.  The commands have the
     FidoNews 5-49                Page 9                    5 Dec 1988


          following meanings:

          Ann - Add the following nn lines to the output file.

          Cnn - Copy nn unchanged lines from the input to the output
          file.

          Dnn - Delete (or skip) nn lines from the input file.

     The following  illustrate how the first few lines of NODEDIFF.213
     might look:

          ;A Friday, July 25, 1986 -- Day number 206 : 27712
          D2
          A2
          ;A Friday, August 1, 1986 -- Day number 213 : 05060
          ;A
          C5

     This fragment illustrates all three editing commands.  The first
     line is the first line from NODELIST.206.  The next line says
     "delete the first two lines" from NODELIST.206.  These are the
     identification line and the line following it.  The next command
     says "add the next two lines" to NODELIST.213.  The two data
     lines are followed by a command which says "copy five unchanged
     lines" from NODELIST.206 to NODELIST.213.  Notice that the first
     line added will ALWAYS contain the new nodelist's CRC.

     Since only the differences will be distributed,  it is important
     to insure the accuracy of the newly created nodelist.  This is
     the function of the CRC mentioned above.  It is sufficient for a
     program designed to  perform the above edits to pick the CRC
     value from the first line added to the output file,  then compute
     the CRC of the rest of the output file.  If the two CRCs do not
     agree,  one of the input files has been corrupted.  If they do
     agree,  the probability is very high (but not 100%) that the
     output file is accurate.

     For actual  distribution,  NODEDIFF.nnn is packed into an archive
     file named NODEDIFF.Ann, where nn are the last two digits of
     day-of-year.

     Steve Bonine
     115/777

                 An Introduction of Don Daniels (107/210)


     Don Daniels was last year's IFNA President, thus his name should
     be the FidoNet equivalent of a "household word".  (A "network
     word"?  A "system word"?  A "dirty word"?)  In spite of what some
     might think, neither "Don" nor "Daniels" is a four-letter word.

     Don started Fido 86 at Grumman Data Systems in October, 1984.  He
     selected Fido software because of the potential benefits of the
     network support for a company distributed in so many locations.
     The Grumman system is still running, plus two at Don's home.

     Then there's the train.  Don commutes to New York City via the
     Long Island Railroad, and uses his laptop during those two hours
     each day to access his mail.  He has written a utility named
     xOVER which he uses to keep straight the file attaches, special
     files, and two independent messages bases (one on the laptop and
     one on the home BBS).  Don reports that his biggest fear is
     getting so involved in what he's doing that he works right past
     his stop.

     Don's history in FidoNet began as an independent for quite a
     while, finally joining net 107 in 1986.  He was NC for a year or
     so, during which time he operated as the Long Island Hub, a
     position he still maintains.  After surviving last year's stint
     as President of IFNA, Don is still quite active in the organiza-
     tion as a Director and member of the Executive Committee.

     The year as President took its toll on time for traditional sysop
     tasks, and everything else.  Both of Don's BBS's have a general
     PC-DOS flavor, the IEEE LI one being slanted toward users in the
     IEEE community.  Experimenting with a "life outside FidoNet", Don
     has just re-started on a volleyball team, and is even looking
     forward to possible time playing softball in the Spring!  When
     you spend 25 hours a day working as IFNA President, it does
     impact almost everything else.

     If we need a mascot for FidoNet, I'm happy to report that Don is
     the owner of a black lab, named (what else?) Fido.  The other
     dog, a viszla named Rexx, is named after the IBM Real-time
     Executive Language.  A nice touch.

     Since leaving Grumman, Don has been an independent computer
     consultant, and he's presently on contract with the Jacob Javits
     Convention Center in NYC, providing technical support for their
     PC, Wang VS, and IBM mainframe systems.  Having travelled a bit
     in his younger days -- circling the world twice while working
     overseas for seven years out a ten year span -- Don is currently
     FidoNews 5-49                Page 11                   5 Dec 1988


     negotiating with the UN for a possible computer consultancy
     contract in Kenya.  Look for a new zone opening soon, near you!

     -------------------

     I want to add just a short author's comment.  Response to this
     column has been underwhelming, at best.  Not that I expected
     anything else, but sometimes it is nice to be surprised.  I plan
     to keep going for at least a few more weeks -- after all, I owe
     it to the folks who went to the not-inconsiderable trouble to
     send me information on themselves -- but when the material stops
     coming in, the columns will stop going out.  After all, this
     ain't fiction. . .

                    RegComm - Communications From RegCon.

     All of the Regional Cordinators of FidoNet meet in a private echo
     named RegCon. It is here that we discuss what needs to be done to
     enhance FidoNet and help it grow, and to discuss our problems and
     solutions  to  those  problems.  Very  recently  David Dodell was
     placed in a position that allowed outside interference to  affect
     his actions and  a few errors  in judgement were  the result. But
     from those errors came  a new intensity in  communications within
     RegCon and the development of an entirely new team concept.

     There will be those who will immediately attempt to convince  you
     this can't possibly work because of the politics involved. We can
     assure you  the only  politics involved  will be  from those  who
     accuse us of it.

     RegCon will, as a team, endeavor to keep all FidoNet SysOps fully
     informed of our work.  We will do this  via messages in a  few of
     the echoconferences and by a column in FidoNews. We ask that  any
     of our fellow SysOps feel free to communicate with your local Net
     Coordinator and your Regional Coordinator at any time you feel it
     necessary. We hope you will all keep your Net Coordinators  fully
     informed of your feelings and help your Net Coordinators to  keep
     us informed.  If, at  any time,  you feel  that chain of communi-
     cations is failing  we welcome your  direct input with  a request
     for your concerns to be forwarded to RegCon. Please excuse us for
     not responding to messages in any of the echoconferences, as less
     than five percent of the net is represented in these areas and it
     is not  good time  management for  us to  do so.  If there is any
     problem with  this please  let us  know and  we will restrict our
     information flow to FidoNews only.

     As our first effort to clear our communications channels we would
     like to address  the subject of  the mandated technical  require-
     ments that  were originally  to take  effect on  January 1.  That
     mandate was rescinded weeks back and it appears we had an  almost
     total  failure  in  communications  when  that  took  place. That
     failure was within the RegCon  team as it was our  responsibility
     to deliver the original mandate and our responsibility to commun-
     icate to you that it had been rescinded. We are in the process of
     informing all of the Net Coordinators and Regional Echo  Coordin-
     ators of the change to make  sure all are aware and we  apologize
     if we failed to make it perfectly clear.

     The  Fidonet  Technical  Specifications  Committee  is  presently
     working on new  specifications for the  software used within  the
     net. When these  specifications are available  we will know  what
     capabilities we will have and will address the uses of those cap-
     abilities. We all  agree to the  need for gating  between FidoNet
     and the other nets, and the need for good software to make this a
     positive move and a move that  will be of benefit to all.  Trying
     to make any decisions before the necessary software is  available
     was our error and we will  do our best to avoid any  reoccurances
     of "putting  the cart  before the  horse". You  can be  sure that
     RegCon is fully supportive of the work being done by the FTSC and
     we hope to see new specifications in the near future.

     Remember, if you have any concerns we would appreciate it if  you
     would address them via NetMail so that we may respond quickly and
     directly. We do  want your input  and we're working  very hard to
     assure a clear channel for communications for all.

     ("RegComm" will be a weekly column in FidoNews and your  comments
     are  welcome.  Please  address  your  concerns  and  comments via
     NetMail to your Net  or Regional Coordinator, you  should receive
     an answer within a few days. It's your net and we are in need  of
     your input in order for us to fairly represent you.)

        New Medical Echo: MEDLIT -- Medical Literature Discussions

     Richard Kaplan
     Medical Software Exchange
     1:135/3
     (305) 325-8709


     I am organizing a new echo (MEDLIT) which will include
     discussions of current papers in popular medical journals such as
     JAMA and NEJM.   I think electronic publishing ultimately could
     revolutionize the way medical information is disseminated by
     minimizing publication delays and providing for efficient
     discussion of controversial theories, including direct
     communication with authors.  Perhaps FidoNet can in some way
     contribute to this vision.

     Think of MEDLIT as an electronic letters-to-the-editor section of
     your favorite medical journal.  If the echo is of high enough
     quality and has enough participation, I would be willing to
     compile the messages periodically and submit them to the editors
     of the appropriate journals, similar to the publication of the
     "Best of Bix" in Byte magazine at one time.

     Let me know if you would like to link into this echo or if you
     have any suggestions about organizing it.  I am PC-PURSUITABLE,
     but if you do not use PC PURSUIT then I will try to link you in
     locally as the distribution list grows.
