     Fidonews won't begin with a hard-hitting editorial this week.  The
     usualy muckraking has taken a back seat to a higher priority.  I had
     lots of contributions, and I wanted to make sure to say "Thanks."
     Take a look through the issue and see if you don't agree that it's
     richer for the variety of input.

     I'm hoping this idea catches on...

             Well, It's just a test to write to another zone (#1 from #2)
     and a humorous thing too. I hope you like it. May be you'll post it.
     OR NOT! :-)

             A plane folls down. People inside of the plane are worried.
     The Stuardess says: "If one man jump out of the plane we won't foll
     down and everybody will survive..." There was an American citizen.
     He told I'll resque all of ya! Gimme whisky!" He drank it and beeing
     shaky jumped out shouting "FOR AMERICA!".... The plane kept folling
     down:-(

             There was a Franch man. He told: "OK, I'll resque all of
     you! Give me wine." He drank a LOT OF wine and jumped out shouting
     "FOR FRANCE!!"... But the plane still kept folling dawn  :~~-(

             There was a Russian man. He told: "Hey! I'll resque all of
     you. Where is my Russian vodka?" He drank two bottles and shouting
     "For Africa" pushed out two black people out.....

             I hope you liked it.

     Email originally to Joe Jared
     ---------------
     Joe,

      First, I'd like to thank you for helping Doug with the Fidonews
      stuff. As a reader (and habitual lurker), I want you to know that
      your efforts are appreciated, and read as well!

     I have an observation and suggestion that I would like to share with
     you, for action (or not!) as you see fit.

     Each week, we receive a listing of those kind individuals who make
     the Fido echomail feeds available via the internet.  The list
     includes node numbers, names, connection details, and the price of
     the service.  The one item it does not include is an internet EMail
     address to contact these indiviuals for more information.  While one
     could always crashmail (or netmail) a message to them, it would seem
     logical that someone providing Fido services via the internet should
     also be contacted via the internet (through EMail).
     FIDONEWS 16-43               Page 3                   25 Oct 1999


     Would it be possible to include EMail addresses (where available)
     for these individuals or companies listed?

     Tis just a thought... for your consideration...

     Again, thank you for all your efforts to keep Fido happy and
     healthy!

     Ed:  Joe Jared responded to this, but , unfortunately, I lost the
     copy I had.  However, Joe responded even more eloquently by action.
     Check out the "virtual email" addresses in Joe's Fidonet by Internet
     Hubs column.  These were actually introduced last week.

     Netmail from Steve Asher @ 3:800/432
     ---------------
     Hi Douglas!

     I enjoyed the current FidoNews, esp the Dr Thom / Mr Hide
     editorial, & used the lot for a log-on bulletin to show
     users that Fido can be fun as well as a web of intrigue. :)

     Cheers, Steve..

     ED: <sigh>  I was hoping to give you an article which showed higher
     purpose.  I was hoping to write an article about how Mother Theresa
     had signed on as a zone coordinator and had dedicated her zone to
     the improvement of the intellectually impoverished.  But she didn't
     get around to it before she left her last office :(

                            ON THE SUBJECT OF BEER
                           Thanks to Warren Bonner
                             wdbonner@pacbell.net

     It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a
     month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his
     son-in-law with all the mead he could drink.  Mead is a honey beer,
     and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called
     the "honey month" or what we know today as the "honeymoon".

     Before thermometers were invented, brewers would dip a thumb or
     finger into the mix to find the right temperature for adding yeast.
     Too cold, and the yeast wouldn't grow.  Too hot, and the yeast
     would die.  This thumb in the beer is where we get the phrase "rule
     of thumb".

     In English pubs, ale is ordered by pints and quarts.  So in old
     England, when customers got unruly, the bartender would yell at
     them to mind their own pints and quarts and settle down.  It's
     where we get the phrase "mind your P's and  Q's".

     Beer was the reason the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.  It's
     clear from the Mayflower's log that the crew didn't want to waste
     beer looking for a better site.  The log goes on to state that the
     passengers "were hasted ashore and made to drink water that the
     seamen might have the more beer".

     After consuming a bucket or two of vibrant brew they called aul, or
     ale, the Vikings would head fearlessly into battle often without
     armor or even shirts. In fact, the term "berserk" means "bare shirt"
     in Norse, and eventually took on the meaning of their wild battles.

     In 1740, Admiral Vernon of the British fleet decided to water down
     the rum. Needless to say, the sailors weren't too pleased and called
     Admiral Vernon Old Grog, after the stiff wool grogram coats he wore.
     The term "grog" soon began to mean the watered down drink itself.
     When you were drunk on this grog, you were "groggy", a word still in
     use today.

     Many years ago in England, pub frequenters had a whistle baked into
     the rim or handle of their ceramic cups.  When they needed a refill,
     they used the whistle to get some service.  "Wet your whistle", is
     the phrase inspired by this practice.

     In the Middle Ages, "nunchion" was the word for liquid lunches.  It
     was a combination of the words "noon scheken", or noon drinking. In
     those days, a large chunk of bread was called lunch.  So if you ate
     bread with your nunchion, you had what we still today call a
     luncheon.

     Things you didn't know about beer.  <chuckle>

     IP Nodes And The Nodelist

     By Jack Yates; N3613C
     1:3613/1275

     Last week I noticed that a new node had been added to FidoNet,
     1:345/4; Michael Wendell.  Michael's node is IP (internet presence)
     only and cannot be called via Plain Old Telephone Service  (POTS);
     Net 345 is in Hawaii, The Net Coordinator (NC) is Todd Cochrane who
     provides FidoNet echomail feeds to about 79 nodes and nets, and by
     doing so is a definite asset to our network and our hobby.  Michael
     lives in Charlotte NC, within the service area of an active net.

     Why, I questioned, did the N345C nodelist Michael in his net rather
     than contact the N379C or the R18C; I sent a netmail to Mr. Cochrane
     advising him that I had seen this addition to his net and stated
     that it was my opinion that it was his duty as a Net Coordinator to
     contact the proper NC and/or RC and advise those people that the
     SysOp was in need of a node number rather than to list him in a net
     thousands of miles from his residence.  This message was CC'd to the
     N379C and R18C AS an "FYI." and posted in the echo, Z1C.

     Mr. Cochrane's response was timely and stated (in substance) that
     "the SysOp had tried to find the NC but got no response; if someone
     wanted to get on the ball and list him, no problem."

     The scenario should end right here as the node is being listed in
     the proper net, but it didn't; there are several members that feel
     that a node should be able to be listed where s/he gets his/her
     feed; traffic in Z1C has increased.

     As someone's tagline states: "If you aren't catching flak, you are
     not on target."  I must have made a direct hit; this is further
     evidenced by the actions of the RC's involved, and the Z1C.

     The underlying question in a lot of this echomail is "Why didn't you
     just leave this alone?"

     Because it's my opinion that this exemption would be harmful to
     FidoNet.

     Other questions and statements have been, and my opinions are:

     "Why can't he belong to that net as that's where he gets his feed."

     I know that it's a thorn in the side of some of the membership but
     we *do* have a Policy document and all Coordinators are obligated to
     uphold it.  Policy 4.07 says that the networks will be defined
     geographically, not according to where the node gets its feed.


     "He's IP-only, how can he get his Host-Routed Netmail (HRN) if he's
     in a local net and the NC doesn't have IP capabilities."

     FIDONEWS 16-43               Page 6                   25 Oct 1999


     Don't be so sure that the NC does not, or that an NEC cannot connect
     with an IP node.  If either of these people are polling for mail via
     Internet FTP, chances are they are capable of connecting.

     If the NC has no internet account or is not capable of FTP or e-mail
     transfers for any reason, the nodes HRN can be held at the RC-s node
     for pickup or delivery via FTP.  Failing all of this, the RC can, by
     editing his route file, redirect the messages to the RC of the
     Region the node's net is in, thence to the node's feed.


     "What difference does it make what net he's in?  It's an increase in
     the membership. why make it difficult for him?"

     What's difficult?  The SysOp wants in, he can't find the Net
     Coordinator but the Sysop who runs the hub knows who it is and knows
     who the RC is as he has a nodelist; send a netmail to the NC or RC,
     advise the SysOp of the NC's address and coach him, if necessary, on
     how to submit the application.


     "If we didn't have such narrow-minded people and all these rules, we
     would see a turn-around in the decline in FidoNet."

     First, I'm not narrow-minded; When I have to read P4, I am looking
     for things that it does not say because if it isn't there, we are
     not told that we can't do it.  Unfortunately, we are told how we
     must list our nodes.

     Second, if we didn't have *any* rules, it would make little or no
     difference in the decline in Fido; local BBSs, as most anyone will
     tell you, are a thing of the past as the Internet beckons the users;
     the nodes in Z1 are leaving primarly due to the lack of callers, not
     because of the rules.

     Third:  Because Policy 4 says we cannot do this.  There is a
     minority of SysOps that would choose to ignore Policy and do as they
     please, thinking that by doing so Policy 4 will be declared as
     unworkable or unnecessary.  I don't think that this will make Policy
     go away.

     Lets say that in your neighborhood there's a 4-way stop sign, the
     East-west road is well traveled, the North-South roadway is
     abandoned, there are barricades, grass grows up through the
     pavement. You ae on the East-West road, you know the North-South
     road is abandoned so you don't stop at the stop sign.  Uh-oh!  Blue
     lights, pull over, citation.

     Now tell the judge that the stop sign is not needed, too
     restrictive, or outdated and see what it gets you.  Or go to the
     Department of Public Works, the governing body of the political
     subdivision ad request the signs be removed and show them why they
     are no longer necessary and it's quite likely that the signs will go
     away.

     At this writing, the Z1C is asking for input regarding a new Policy
     FIDONEWS 16-43               Page 7                   25 Oct 1999


     document; tell him what you want, substantiate your reasons for
     wanting it and see if it will be considered.  While you wait,
     however, keep stopping at the stop sign.


     "The IC has said that all geographical exemptions are pre-granted
     pending someone proving that the exception would cause harm to the
     net."

     Yes, he did, but I feel that to allow an exemption for the reason
     given would be harmful as, if allowed to stand, a precedent has been
     established;  "You allowed So-and-So to do it, you have to allow me
     to do it as well." Soon the nodelist becomes fragmented with
     listings scattered in all parts of the world as part of what were
     once local nets.

     What if we have nodes that feed from, say net 000, who are in other
     Zones and have Zone 1 nodelistings?  The NCs and RCs are responsible
     for the smooth operation of there Networks/Regions; how can one
     discharge that responsibility if there are nodes that are, say, in
     India, Australia, or other, perhaps non-English-speaking or `English
     as a second language' areas?  I can almost hear the screams of (for
     instance) the Zone 2 Coordinator the first time a Zone 1 NC lists a
     node in Russia, or the Zone 3 Coordinator, should I list my point in
     Queensland as a member of net 3613, near Columbus, Georgia, USA, not
     to mention the howls of anguish from my RC if I were to do so.

     I think a better method of accomodating IP-only nodes already exists
     under the auspices of the Zone Coordinator who has listed several in
     the 1:1/3000 block of the nodelist.  There may be other workable
     options that can be implemented that don't conflict with current
     Policy.  I urge those of the membership who are more aware than I am
     of the features and confines of IP-only nodes to work out a
     reasonable solution.  Until then, I suggest that the *Cs accomodate
     new nodes as speedily and painlessly as possible, but within the
     bounds stated in Policy.


     -----------------------------------------------------------------

                           Beating on the ThomToms
                                  Doug Myers

     I doubt that I've had more response to any editorial than I did from
     last week's "Dr. Thom and Mr... hide?"  While it's clear that I'd
     continue to draw more interest towards Fidonews with my muckraking
     than, say, Joe Jared would with his excellent work on the Internet
     listings... I wanted to save the editorial this week for another
     purpose.  However, I feel that I owe readers a report on some of the
     response I've gotten.

                                    * * *

     On the "more bad news for Thom" side if the discussion, some
     observers have noted discrepancies in the ELISTing.  ELADD.TXT is a
     report circulated with the ELISTING, and details additions by
     FIDONEWS 16-43               Page 8                   25 Oct 1999


     ECHOBASE, the elist software.  The discrepancy noted is that at
     least some of the echoes acquired by Tom Knowles were listed in
     ELADD.TXT without a moderator, while other echoes acquired or added
     by other moderators were listed with that name.

     Matt Bedynek has a working copy of ECHOBASE installed on his system,
     and reports that he could only simulate this discrepancy by burning
     the echoes manually, and feels from his experience that manual
     intervention would have been necessary on Thom's system too.

                                    * * *

     Though Thom LaCosta has been mostly silent since the controversy
     started, and has certainly not responded to anything written in
     Fidonews so far, he did post in Z1_Coordinator on the subject.  He
     acknowledges that Tom Knowles accesses his sysop editor through a
     doorway program, and acknowledges that this would give Tom access to
     functions not normally available to users.  However, he maintains
     that there has been no such abuse, and that user access is his
     business only.

                                    * * *

     Supporting Thom and Tom is one reader who prefers to remain
     anonymous.  He maintains that Thom and Tom are separate individuals,
     though he wasn't free to tell how he knows that.  This reader points
     out that there is insufficient evidence presented to prove this, and
     makes two observations:

     1.  That the echoes REC, Z1_BACKBONE, and ZEC have been turned over
     to proper moderators upon polite request.

     2.  That there has been no harm in any of Thom LaCosta's "playing"
     with the ELIST, even if any of the allegations are true.  Certainly
     he has "played" less than his predecessor, Adrian Walker.

     feet became quite thick and hard.  He also was quite a spiritual
     person.  Even when he was not on a hunger strike, he did not eat

      A new feature has been added to this list.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.
