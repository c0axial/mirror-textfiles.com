                              Editorial
========================================================================
    Our net has been having a lot of discussion lately on the
cost of the CRP.  One of my pet peeves as a hub (I am not
hubbing anymore, but used to), was the 2400 baud BBS's that
received 1.5 megabytes (compressed) of echomail daily.  I once
expanded that, and counted the pages.  By my calculations, the
BBS would have needed 45 hours a day of online time to read it
all.

    I wonder just how much mail is actually read, and how much
is received to cater to the "my BBS is bigger than your BBS"
syndrome.  Perhaps, with satellite feed, it does not affect the
cost for most CRP's.  Waste still irks me though.

    On another subject, I just finished a book than was
interesting to anybody involved in net culture.  It was called
"Megatrends, Global Paradox" by John Naisbitt.  I am not about
to attempt to summarize a 400 page paperback in an editorial, but
the essential theme of the book is to compare global trends to
the mainframe/microcomputer network tradeoff.  The author makes
a convincing arguement that the world will (and should) evolve
into many more smaller and smaller nations, almost a citystate
existance.  Email and automated voting procedures will play a
major part, and electronic banking will effectively produce a
world currency, regardless of the actual number of "national"
currencies. A stimulating head trip that I am still mulling
over.

    Last but not least, we have cut an article today, or at
least put it on hold.  It was an ad for a piece of software that
is not shareware, but purely commercial.  While we do run ads
for software that pertains to BBSing, we have always stuck to
shareware only.  What do people think about ads for BBS software
that is a commercial product?  I should mention that the author
is a Fido sysop.

     On with the snooze.

 This message has been e-mailed to you for no good reason. The
 original sender has been hunted down and executed. It has been sent
 back and forth to the same superstitious dorks for about 20 years.
 This stupid piece of trash has now been e-mailed to you. You will
 back and forth to the same superstitious dorks for about 20 years.
 This stupid piece of trash has now been e-mailed to you. You will
 spread the boredom within seconds of receiving this message -
 provided you, in turn, e-mail it on.

 This is no joke. Not even I, the sender, am amused. You will gets lots
 of angry e-mail in return, but no money. Send copies to people you
 think are as stupid as you are. E-mail your credit card number and
 expiration date to as many people as you can. Don't send money as it
 will clog up your Net connection. Do not keep this message. This
 message must leave your hard drive in 96 hours.

 * A United States Crack Dealer received $470,000 Dollars.
 * Another Man received $40,000 Dollars and lost it because he
   couldn't find it.
 * In the Philippines, Gene Welch lost his wife 51 days after receiving
   the message. He failed to circulate the message. However, before his
   death, he received 7,555,000 new wives.

 Please e-mail twenty copies to Canter & Seigel and see what happens
 in four days. The chain comes from Venezuela and was written by
 Saul De Groda, a plumber from Cleveland. He has been hunted down
 and executed. Since the copy must tour the Net, you must make
 twenty copies and e-mail them to friends and associates. After a few
 days you'll get a flood of angry responses. Nothing is true, even if
 you are superstitious. Do note the following:

 * Constantine Dias received this chain in 1958, several years before it
   was created. He asked his boss to make twenty copies and send them
   out. He was fired and became a prostitute. A few days later he won
   two dollars in the lottery.

 * Carlos Daditt, an office droid, received the message and forgot that
   it had to leave his hard disk in 96 hours. He lost about 20KBytes of
   storage space. Later, after finding the message again, he erased it
   from his hard drive. A few days later he was fired and went into
   storage space. Later, after finding the message again, he erased it
   from his hard drive. A few days later he was fired and went into
   business with Constantine.

 * Dalan Fairchild received the message and, not believing, deleted it.
   Nine days later he choked to death on a ham sandwich while watching
   the "Space Madness" episode of Ren & Stimpy.

 * In 1987, the message received by a young woman in California was
   full of garbage characters due to line noise, and was barely readable.
   She promised herself that she would retype the message and e-mail
   it on, but she set it aside to do volunteer work at an orphange. She
   was plagued with various problems, including being beaten up by
   the kids at the orphanage. The e-mail did not leave her hands within
FidoNews 12-05                 Page:  4                    30 Jan 1995

   96 hours. She finally typed the letter as promised and was beaten so
   severly by the children that she was hospitalized for 18 months.

 So, Good Luck, but please remember: 20 copies of this message MUST
 leave your computer in 96 hours...

 You must not sign off on this message...

 YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

Microsoft Clarifies Trademark Policies

REDMOND, Washington--January 4, 1995--In response to customer
inquiries, Microsoft today clarified the naming policy for Bob(tm),
its new software product designed for computer beginners.  Contrary
to rumors, Microsoft will not demand that all persons formerly named
"Bob" immediately select new first names.

"I don't know where these rumors come from," commented Steve
Balmer, Microsoft Executive Vice President for Worldwide Sales and
Support. "It's ridiculous to think Microsoft would force people
outside the computer industry to change their names.  We won't, and
our licensing policies for people within the industry will be so
reasonable that the Justice Department could never question them."

Balmer said employees of other computer companies will be given the
opportunity to select new names, and will also be offered a
licensing option allowing them to continue using their former names
at very low cost.

The new licensing program, called Microsoft TrueName(tm), offers
persons who want to continue being known by the name Bob the option
of doing so, with the payment of a small monthly licensing fee and
upon signing a release form promising never to use OpenDoc.  As an
added bonus, Bob name licensees will also be authorized to display
the Windows 95 logo on their bodies.

Persons choosing not to license the Bob name will be given a 60-day
grace period during which they can select another related name.
"We're being very lenient in our enforcement of the Bob trademark,"
said Bill Newkom, Microsoft's Senior Vice President of Law and
Corporate Affairs.  "People are still free to call themselves
Robert, Robby, or even Rob.  Bobby however is derivative of
Microsoft's trademark and obviously can't be allowed."

Microsoft also announced today that Bob(tm) Harbold, its Executive
Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has become the first
Microsoft TrueName licensee and will have the Windows 95 logo
tattooed to his forehead.

Subject: Dictactorship in Z4 - Update

Hello Fidonetters,

This  article is only to keep the world up-to-date with the  last
happenings in Z4 - Region 80.

The  ZC4 (Gamey Garcia) kept his decision in replacing our  RC80,
and as i said before, even a single word of reason wasn't stated.

All  former NCs decided to keep their decisions in not  to  agree
with  the ZC's act, and they even tried to make a deal  with  the
ZC, but again, the ZC didn't agree.

While  this,  our  new RC80 performed a  'cleaning'  job  in  the
region.  He killed 4 nets, and merged 'em with other  nets.  Some
days ago, he simply replaced all NCs, and killed my net (4:808).

In  the  new  positions,  he  assigned  SysOps  without  previous
experience or even enough knowledge to handle their new jobs.  Oh
well, i wish 'em luck in their new position.

It's  simply incredible, how a person like Mr. Gamey Garcia  make
deals  with persons like our new RC80 and a few supporters  (less
than 10) of his ideas around the country.

This children game is only playing with more than 10.000 users in
Brazil, and they're very angry with this situation.

Today,  FidoNet  in Brazil is broken in two pieces. One  of  them
controlled by the current RC, with less than 10% of the  original
number of +- 170 nodes, and the other one with the rest.

This  is  a  funny situation. We have two  fidonets,  one  called
"FidoClean" and another called "Fidonet", running in paralell...

Folks,  wake up for the current situation in Fidonet.  There  are
many  conflicts today... the fight for the power is  becoming  an
insane  war, with lots of loosers fighting for a stupid  position
of *C, and the only victims are the users around the globe.

Fidonet-Brazil  is dead. More than 90% of the SysOps are  willing
to  move to another network, or even create a new  network.  This
dirty policy is killing a 6 year job performed by several  SysOps
in our Country, in a great effort to consolidate the network.

FidoNews 12-05                 Page:  9                    30 Jan 1995

I'm so sorry we can't do anything, but we're with tied hands...

Well, i'm stopping here, because we're only a few nodes trying to
reestablish the order in our Region, and we're dealing with dirty
minds.

I really hope that Fidonet can survive here in Brazil...

That's all.

Regards,

Alexandre Beltrao (former 4:808/3)

There is a new echo to FidoNet. It is another in the line of the famous
NIGHT_SHIFT echos! It is NIGHT_SHIFT_BASH_POLI where you can
bash/defend politics, politicians, or just talk about them. We are
attempting to get it backboned, but we need some REC requests! So send
a message to your Regional Echomail Coordinator and ask them to get
NIGHT_SHIFT_BASH_POLI on the backbone! If you are interested in getting
this echo, please contact Josh Kayser or Joe Shear at 1:105/249 or just
simply write to your REC and tell them you want it backboned! It's that
easy! And remember, you can bash politics all you want! That's what
it's here for!

Clues sought in Kayla Mayberry murder
Daniel Tobias
1:380/7

The family and friends of Kayla Mayberry are desperately seeking clues
to help solve her murder.

Kayla was last seen at The Wet Bar on Spring Street in downtown
Shreveport, Louisiana, on Saturday, October 22, 1994 after 10 PM.

Her family spent the next two weeks searching for her, but this ended
tragically when her body was found in an abandoned farmhouse in east
Texas.

Now, they're attempting to find anybody who has any information that
might lead to the solution of this case.

FidoNews 12-05                 Page: 10                    30 Jan 1995

Kayla Mayberry was 5'6", 115 lbs, age 19, medium blonde hair, brown
eyes, and was last seen wearing light blue Guess jeans and a
sleeveless blue and white striped v-neck tank top.  Anyone with
