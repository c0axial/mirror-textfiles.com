     =================================================================


     We're coming up on our 10,000th node.  Its time to start
     thinking about the prizes we might want to heap upon this
     person as he enters the net.  He or she will be surprised
     at what gets heaped upon them later ...

     Since there will be more than one 10,000th node (everyone in
     the nodelist the week it breaks 10,000 can claim the honor),
     we'll need more than one set of prizes!  So contribute early
     and often.

     So, from our home office in International Falls, Minnesota,
     here are the Top Ten Prizes for the 10,000th node in FidoNet!

     A drumroll, Anton, if you please ...

     10. Complete Echomail Sayings of Mahatma Ravsic (Along with the
         terabytes of optical storage needed to hold them)

      9. Lifetime Membership in IFNA

      8. One Year's Supply of Aspirin and Maalox
         (which will last about three weeks)

      7. Nomex Body Stocking Styled By Frederics of Hollywood

      6. Get Out of Excommunication Free Card

      5. Letter of Sincere Appreciation Signed By all the
         stockholders of the common carrier of your choice
         personally thanking you for the BMW's you're going
         to buy each and every one of them over the next 10
         years (along with the number of that bar in Fiji)

      4. Honorary Dobyns Award

      3. Beta Test Access to the product of your choice
         (be careful what you wish ... it might come true!)

      2. A Free Lifetime Connection To John Richard's Echomail
         star of the week (you have to track him down yourself)

      1. A mikey Doll (complete with engineer's hat!)

     FidoNet 1:130/20.1102
     MailNet 20:491/223.0
     RATnet  45:200/52.0

                      FidoNet and "Alternative" Networks

     Recently, it seems, there has been a tremendous growth of
     "alternative" networks using FidoNet technology.  I think
     this is great - I am a member of two of them.  Alternate
     networks can provide things that Fido, due to its sheer size,
     can't.  For example, while I am allowed to operate a private
     (Pvt) system in MailNet and RATnet I am restricted to operating
     a point system (with the inherent restrictions that come from
     not being listed in the nodelist) in FidoNet.  Alternate
     networks can provide sysops flexibility in the way their systems
     operate, how and when these operations take place, and a host of
     other things that, for whatever reason, FidoNet can't.

     The growing number of sysops in alternate networks presents
     several technical problems, not the least of which is
     addressing.  Multiple zones have caused many a sleepless night
     for sysops who try running echomail from Fido and their other
     network(s) (as evidenced by the dark circles under my eyes).

     The installation of alternate addresses on Fido nodes has caused
     headaches for hubs and coordinators, as well.  While there is a
     period of learning for implementing one zone, there is a longer
     one for implementing more than one (or should that be more than
     1:?).  :-)  The effects of this period of learning are felt in
     both (or, in my case, all three) networks.  Bad AreaFix
     messages, dupe echomail messages, wierd origin, seen-by, and
     path lines, and other technical mishaps are part of learning how
     to make a mail processing utility address your mail correctly.
     I know - I've done it.  Several times.

     Until software is updated to take full advantage of domains these
     problems will continue to exist and we will all suffer to some
     extent.  Unfortunately, some members of both the alternate
     network and FidoNet are intolerant of this learning curve and
     take out their frustration about technical mistakes on sysops
     trying to eliminate glitches.  Often they send harsh reprimands,
     cut mail feeds, and even drop nodes from nodelists.

     POLICY4 mentions this learning curve, and points out that all of
     us are likely to be annoying at some time.  It suggests that we
     all follow the Second Law of FidoNet - "Thou shalt not be too
     easily annoyed."  However, it seems that some one-network Fido
     sysops are breaking this rule (often without realizing they are
     doing it).  It's sad, in my opinion.  I have messages on my
     system which order echomail feeds cut to systems who send
     messages using the wrong address, create an inadvertent dupe
     loop, or even send a bad AreaFix (and I can tell you that I have
     done all three of those).

     FidoNews 8-06                Page 3                   11 Feb 1991


     Both you and I understand the problems of setting up a one-zone
     system.  If you're reading this, you've probibly done it.  You
     know that mistakes in batch files, command lines, etc., can
     result in increased transmission time (and cost) because of
     them.  My problem is especially magnified because I use a 1200
     bps modem, so for each dupe you transmit at 2400, double the
     time it takes me to get it - and that time adds up.  But since
     I have set up two other addresses (with some but not complete
     success) I think I am a little more tolerant than some of the
     FidoNet "regulars" or "old-timers."  Sure, dupes take up disk
     space, increase transmission time and cost, and increase
     processing time (I know - I use an 4.77 mHz machine, too).
     But so do messages complaining about them.  They are a fact of
     life, no matter how much we would like to believe otherwise.
     Technical problems will continue to exist until someone writes
     a bug-free all-in-one package (that will still not satisfy
     everyone) in which the sysop has only to select a pre-defined
     modem type, enter the system name, sysop name, and any
     Fido-style addresses to be used.

     My message in all of this?  Just to ask those of you who get mad
     at people who have multiple addresses with technical problems
     to be understanding.  You had problems too - remember?  I do.

     Alternate networks, just like new technology, can only benifit
     FidoNet.  Communication, information and idea exchange - the
     purpose of FidoNet.  Right?  We are not here to strong-arm
     members who have accidental problems into single-minded
     compliance with "the way."

     So next time you have a feed cut for an annoying technical
     glitch, think first.  We all want FidoNet to be the vibrant
     grandfather, not the senile old ostrich with our collective
     head buried in the sand.

     Responses are, of course, welcome at any of the above
     addresses.  For information about MailNet, contact Terry Day
     at 1:106/800.0.  For information about RATnet, contact Craig

                 HOW TO UPLOAD A TEXT FILE AS A BBS MESSAGE

     by Dave "who likes to jump out of airplanes" Appel, C-20451
     A user on 1:231/30

     C:\INTRO>
        This procedure describes how to prepare a text file on your
     computer and how to upload it to a BBS (Bulletin Board system)
     as a message instead of an upload file. I'm sure you sysops
     already know all this, but this might make a good bulletin for
     your users, or an article for your user group newsletter.
        There are several reasons why you would want to do this. You
     might not like the online message editor that the BBS uses. You
     might want to include text from other files in the message. You
     might want to send the same message to several people on the
     BBS. You might want to send the same message to several BBSs.
     (Gee, who do we know who does that?)
        You might want to conserve BBS time by preparing the message
     beforehand. This leaves you more time to do other things on the
     BBS, or else frees the line up for someone else to call the BBS.
        There are three steps to this process:
        1. Create the text file.
        2. Configure your communications program.
        3. Upload the message.

     C:\CREATE\MSG>
        The first step is to create your message in a text file. You
     can use your favorite word processor as long as it can save the
     file as "plain ascii text." This means you can't have any
     formatting characters like bold, underline, italics, font
     changes, etc.
        For best results, you should just use a "text editor" that
     defaults to a plain ascii text file when you save the document.
     If you do use a word processor like Word 5.0, you need to
     specify "with line breaks" when you save it.
        "Plain ascii text" also means that each line terminates with
     the standard MS-DOS "CR/LF" (carriage return/line feed)
     combination.
        Text editors like Q-Edit, PC-Write, and AHED would do fine.
     (In my opinion PC-Write is a text editor, not a word processor.)
        There are some important formatting considerations when
     composing your message. There are exceptions to most of the
     following rules. However, I have researched this extensively,
     and the following rules will work in the majority of situations
     for most BBSs. If you change one formatting rule, you will have
     to change several others, and then you will not get the desired
     result.
        Not everyone has the same text editor, and not all BBSs are
     the same. So even if you change something, and it works for you,
     it will not necessarily work for someone else.
        1. No blank lines. If you want a blank line, put at least one
     space character on the line, so it is not a true empty line.
     FidoNews 8-06                Page 5                   11 Feb 1991


        2. Left margin should be 0 or 1. Some bulletin boards wrap
     the lines of your message unless the first character of the line
     is a space or a period. If the BBS to which you will upload the
     message wraps messages, such as TBBS, use a left margin of 1.
        When using a text editor: to make a left margin of one, it
     can be easier to compose your message first with a left margin
     of zero, and, when you are done, go back to insert spaces. This
     can be done quickly by hitting <space bar><back-arrow><down-
     arrow> repeatedly starting at the top left margin.
        3. Make the right margin equal to the smallest right margin
     of the BBSs that you call. Some have a line width of 72, some
     65, some 60. I use a right margin of 60 on all BBSs because it
     is easier to read.
        4. Know the number of lines to which you are limited by the
     BBS. Most BBSs allow messages to be up to 66 lines long. Some
     only allow 19 lines. All BBSs that I've seen tell you at the
     beginning of the message-entry procedure how many lines you are
     allowed. If you never paid attention to that, call the bbs,
     enter a test message, and cancel it before you save it.
        If you want to write a message longer than the BBS limit, you
     will have to break your message into smaller files.
        5. You need to terminate the text file correctly. This means
     no extra blank lines at the end of the file. There should be one
     true blank line at the end of the file, with the line above it
     being the last line of actual text.
        To make sure you have no extra blank lines, execute the
     keystrokes that place your cursor at the very last character of
     your document. (For most text editors repeatedly pressing <down-
     arrow> and <End> will do this.) Then press the backspace key
     until your cursor is at the first column of the last line.
        Here is what it should look like, the asterisk is where your
     cursor should be:
          |------Column 1
          V
          blah, blah, blah, blah, blah-blah
          This is the last line.
          *

        This will cause some text editors to put a true blank line at
     the end. Others will just put ONE CR/LF combination after "This
     is the last line."

        If it looks like this:
          blah, blah, blah, blah, blah-blah
          This is the last line.*

     then it will not work for some text editors. Some text editors
     will NOT put a CR/LF combination after that last line, and this
     would cause your upload to hang, or freeze your system on the
     last line.
        It really doesn't matter where your cursor is when you save
     the file from your text editor. I'm just using it as a method
     for determining that there is a CR/LF at the very end of the
     file no matter what text editor you are using.

     C:\PROGRAM\SETUP>
        I will describe the configurations for the two most popular
     communication programs, Telix and Procomm. If you don't use one
     of these programs, then I suggest that you switch to one of
     them. These are the most common. Therefore, there are more
     people to help you with any questions you might have.
        Bitcom, Smartcom, PFS:First Choice, and Crosstalk are among
     the worst. Don't even try this with those programs unless you
     consider yourself an expert.
        I use Telix version 3.12. I used to use Procomm 2.4.2.

     TELIX:
        (Use ALT-O to get to the setup menu)
        A- Strip high bit     off
        B- Remote abort char  0
        Uploads:
        C- Local echo  on or off
        D- Expand blank lines off
        E- Pace character     13 (Ascii)
        F- Line pacing 3  (1/10 seconds)
        G- Character pacing   10 to 60 depends on CPU
                       speed
        H- CR translation     none
        I- LF translation     strip
        Downloads:
        J- CR translation     none
        K- LF translation     none

        The local echo is not important. Your screen will most likely
     look funny if you leave it on, but it won't hurt anything.
        Expand blank lines must be off. You might think that turning
     this on will let you put blank lines in your text file. But this
     only messes up other stuff. Turning this ON will cause your
     system to hang up at the end of an ascii upload.
        A Pace character of 13 means that the program will wait until
     the BBS returns a carriage-return (decimal 13 ascii) before
     sending the next line. This is so your communication program
     doesn't out-pace the BBS's capability to accept characters. A
     value of 13 will work on most systems.
        If you are uploading a message to GEnie, or a bbs using
     Protree (such as "The Tardis") you will want to use decimal 62
     ascii, which is the ">" character. GEnie and Protree won't
     accept characters until the ">" character is sent. And there can
     be a delay between the carriage-return and the ">".
        The line pacing figure is in tenths of a second. This varies
     according to the BBS you are calling. I find that a value of 3
     works for most BBS's. Some very slow BBSs will require a longer
     delay. If the first characters of every line get dropped, then
     increase this number.
        Character pacing for Telix depends on the speed of your CPU.
     I am using a 10 Mhz 286 and I use a value of 10 here. Those who
     use a 33 Mhz 386 need to use a value of 60 here. This is based
     on a timing loop in Telix. The faster your computer, the larger
     this number needs to be.
     FidoNews 8-06                Page 7                   11 Feb 1991


        You can tell if you need to increase this number if there are
     missing characters in your uploaded message. Increase this
     number until there are no dropped characters.
        This figure is also dependent on the slowest BBS that you
     call. Some BBSs can't keep up at a full 2400 baud when you are
     entering a message. BBSs are not as efficient at accepting a
     text message as when you are uploading a file with the UPLOAD
     command.
        CR translation (upload) must be none.
        LF translation (upload) must be strip. Otherwise, you could
     get a blank line between every line of text.
        For DOWNLOADS, you don't want to strip anything because DOS
     needs both the carriage-return and the line-feed.
        Press ESC to get back to the setup menu, and then "W" to
     write the setup information to disk.

     PROCOMM:
        (Use ALT-S to get to the setup menu)
        Uploads:
        Echo locally yes or no
        Expand blank lines    no
        Pace character   13
        Character pacing 10 (1/1000 seconds)
        Line pacing  3 (1/10 seconds)
        CR translation   none
        LF translation   strip
        Downloads:
        CR translation   none
        LF translation   none

        Procomm has the same setup as Telix except for character
     pacing. The Telix character pacing is based on a timing loop,
     whereas Procomm measures the actual milliseconds (1/1000th of a
     second.) This is the only number that you should have to play
     with in order to get it right for both YOUR computer, and the
     BBS that you are calling.
        Press ESC to get back to the setup menu then press "S" to
     save the configuation.

     C:\UPLOAD\MSG>
        There are many ways to do this. I am going to explain what
     works for me, and what works in most situations.
        When you are ready to enter your message, it is easier to NOT
     use the "full-screen editor" sometimes called a "visual editor."
     These have a tendency to mess up when doing an ascii upload.
     They also have the tendency of not keeping up when you are
     sending them data at a full 2400 baud.
        SIDE NOTE: If you are adventurous, and love to tinker, you
     can "tweak" the numbers on the ascii upload setup menu to work
     for a particular "full-screen editor." But, be aware that they
     all work differently. (Hint: try setting the "pace character" to
     0, and triple the character pacing and line pacing numbers over
     what they normally are.) It's even harder if your message is
     over one screen long when using a full-screen editor.

        But my purpose here is to tell you the SIMPLEST way that
     works for MOST people.
        Depending on the BBS software, some of these items may be
     entered in a different order, or even omitted.
        Enter the command to begin entering a message. It's usually
     "E" for enter, but could be "P" for post, or "W" for write on
     some BBSs.
        Enter the subject.
        Enter the message security, such as "R" for receiver-only, or
     "N" for none. Not used on all BBSs.
        If the system asks if you want to use a "visual editor" or a
     "full-screen editor" enter "N". You might have to change your
     "user configuration" on the BBS to change this.
        Wait until the message "header" is displayed on your screen.
     This is usually a line of dashes indicating how long your lines
     may be.
        The BBS will usually number your lines for you.
        Wait until the BBS places the cursor on the first line of the
     message and is waiting for you to start typing.
        At this point, press the "PgUp" key.
        Press the key corresponding to the ASCII protocol.
        Type in the name of the text file containing your message. If
     the file is not in your upload directory you must specify the
     full path name.
        If you have everything set up properly, the message should
     upload. When done, the BBS should be at the "end of message
     command" menu, asking you to <l>ist the message, <s>ave it, or
     <a>bort it.
        If your text editor is funky, and did not put a true blank
     line at the end of the file, then you may have to press ENTER to
     terminate the message entry procedure and get the "end of
     message command" menu.
        If the ASCII UPLOAD hangs up, or freezes at the last line of
     the message, it is probably because you didn't set "EXPAND BLANK
     LINES" to "N", or off. It could also be because you didn't
     terminate the text file correctly with your editor. See item #5
     above on how to create the text file.
        Until you become confident with the procedure type "L" at
     this point to "list" your message. Some BBSs use "P" to "print
     formatted" or "V" for "View."
        Read your message and look for any dropped or missing
     characters. If there are missing characters, abort this message,
     change your setup menu (ascii upload section) to increase the
     character pacing and/or the line pacing values, and try again.
        On those BBSs that wrap the lines, check to see that it
     didn't wrap where you didn't want it to. On TBBS, BBS-PC or
     Citadel BBSs use the "P" or "V" command to do this. Go back to
     your text editor and put a space at the beginning of the lines
     if you don't want it to wrap.
        When you are satisfied that your message was uploaded
     correctly, type "S" to save it.

        If you see the BBS displaying the "end of message command"
     menu before you are done uploading the message, it is because
     you had a blank line in your text file. Remember that you must
     have NO blank lines, they must contain at least one space
     character. Hit the ESC key to terminate the upload procedure,
     wait for the BBS to calm down and stop beeping (this could take
     a minute or two) and then abort the message. Go back and re-edit
     your text file and try again.
        Hint: Both Procomm and Telix allow you to "jump to DOS" so
     you can quickly edit your text file while you are still on-line
     with the BBS. Don't take too long, or the BBS will think you
     went to sleep and log you off.

     C:\RECAP>
        There are a lot of things to configure and remember when
     doing all this. But once it is set-up right, it sure makes
     writing messages a lot easier. I especially like it when I am
     uploading announcements to various BBSs.

     BACKBONE -- the file echo -- is now available in a region near
     you. It's a distribution mechanism for ASCII text lists that
     identify conferences carried via "backbone" transport mechanisms.

     The text files will be generated whenever backbone transport
     conference lists change. This will [hopefully] offer more timely
     and efficient backbone conference request routing.

     Text files hatched into BACKBONE -- the file echo -- are named
     <org>.<suborg>. For example, the FidoNet North American EchoMail
     backbone conference list is named < FIDONET.NA >.

     Text files for EchoMail conferences are in a format compatible
     with the AreaFix v1.10+ automatic forwarding mechanism -- one
     conference name per line. This is so AreaFix can be configured to
     find the files in a fixed location such as the BACKBONE
     subdirectory [as defined in the Tic.Cfg file]. The format also
     allows us to provide additional information.

     The advantage? I'm glad you asked. If all region and net level
     "backbone" distributors maintain current BACKBONE conference
     lists much of the difficulty and delay associated with new
     backbone conferences might be reduced noticably. If BACKBONE --
     the file echo -- follows backbone conference paths we might even
     achieve "overnight" availability of new conferences.


     Obligatory Technical 'Splanation
     ================================

     Text files distributed via BACKBONE -- the file echo -- will
     maintain a fixed name. That means Tick's CRC2DUP/DUPBYCRC
     configuration option is recommended for unattended flow.

     Tic.Cfg configuration parameters specific to BACKBONE would
     include the global parameter...

      CRC2Dup

     and an AREA block something like...

      AREA C:\Backbone BACKBONE
        LOCAL DupByCRC
        1:13/13    Passwrd1    *
        1:396/1    Passwrd2    *

     AreaFix.Ctl parameters might then look similar to...

     Well, that's chapter 1 of the story. Let's see if this helps
     streamline backbone distribution operations. If it does, both
     Real SysOps and backbone operators will benefit. If it doesn't
     catch on, at least I'll have had more fun than if I hadn't tried
     at all.

      Peace to all.

                             BBS_UTIL Echo

          The BBS_UTIL Echo is for the support and development of
     "utilities" (support programs) written for any BBS package
     available.  Whether you use RBBS, Remote Access, QuickBBS,
     PCBoard, SBBS, Opus, Maximus or who knows what else, you are
     welcome to join in the discussions.  Utility authors and users
     are welcome to discuss the programs they use, their features,
     problems, and the like, no matter what BBS they are written for.
     Many programs, though written for "one" BBS, will work (maybe
     with some help) on other BBS packages, find out how...  If you
     are feeling a bit "limited" in only knowing what is available
     for one particular BBS package, then here is a place to come to
     find out what "others" are doing, what they have available, etc.,
     without worrying about who is running what, where, why and
     without having to pull in every BBS support echo there is.  Share
     your own knollege about what you use and maybe learn something in
     return.
          For those beginning and "older" programmers, who wish to
     discuss their programs, how they do things, implementation
     problems, etc... the discussions are welcome.  Though not geared
     "specifically" for programmers, their discussions concerning what
     they are doing, how they are doing it, etc., will be more than
     welcome, even encouraged!!.  Some may find that by just
     incorporating small changes, their programs will work (without a
     kludge :-)) on some other BBS package, thus enhancing their work
     and making it available to more people.  If you need assistance
     in getting something to work, need information concerning how
     something is done with another BBS, just ask... who knows,
     someone may actually have the answer!!
          Overall, if you are interested in discussions concerning
     "utility" software, without concern as to what BBS it is for,
     join the echo.

          The echo is presently being made available on the Backbone,
     so just start asking for it.  If you need any assistance in
     getting a feed, or just want to know more about it, you may
     contact either myself at:  FidoNet 1:322/235 or Jim Hadfield,
     at:  FidoNet 1:11/717

                    What the hey? This is FidoNews?

     Good grief! This is _Fido_ News?  FidoNews 804 had probably the
     worse collection of  articles I've ever  seen. We got the basic
     fag spreading effluent throughout the issue and some additional
     irrational sputterings from the _Christian_ cult!

     How many people used to look forward to bringing up FidoNews on
     the screen every  week? Prior to  the split of FidoNet  and the
     political  reorganizations, there was some interesting stuff in
     the years gone by.

     Now we get to read about fags  'finding' each other through the
     computer and about the religious cults doing  the same. Is this
     what FidoNews was intended for?

     It's time to consider the print-it-all issue again, I think.


     [ Editor's note: Since you asked -- frankly, this is about the
     most offensive article which I have ever printed. I object to
     your tone, your attitude and your obnoxious, self-indulgent
     homophobic whining (and my wife doesn't approve of it either).
     If we were to reconsider the print-it-all policy, submissions
     like this would be the first to face the axe.

     I don't see anything wrong with people reaching out to others
     like themselves. For example, the type who thinks they spent
     $5,000 on a computer so they could play some fool game like
     Universal Mayhem. I *DO* happen to think that's what FidoNews is
     for. Unfortunately, I have to put up with sick, hateful racist
     crap like this in order to accomplish my goal. Hopefully, your
     submission won't be the start of a rash of Aryan Nation or Ku
     Klux Klan articles.

     My advice to you is: Chill Out. And keep this in mind -- it's
     real hard to stop restricting people's rights once you get off
     to a running start. -- Vince ]

                      A Rose is a Roze is a Rqse

     Altering a single letter of a filename to indicate it's  com-
     pressed status dates back, at least, to the original sQueeze
     and Crunch(Z) when CP/M was THE small game going.  We still
     see it weekly as the NodeDiff makes its rounds in an .Axx.

     As the compression and collection programs make their appear-
     ance in the FidoNet community, various nodes choose favorites.
     Most of these have a standard appendage we recognize as a three
     letter "Extension" such as the venerable .ARC's and .ZOO's.
     In the tradition of FidoNet, however, we seek to not exclude
     the most limited participants, so for broadest compatiblity we
     retain the 8+3 naming limitations, though these ARE quite the
     limitations.   In this naming schema, single letters begin to
     have a lot of significance.

     NOT AS LAW OR FORCED POLICY, I would like to propose the
     following as a starting place for friendly interchange aids.
     If others agree, perhaps the Signet letter ALSO can be included
     with the companion archiver listings in the appendix of the
     regular FidoNews distribution.   (see table below)

     Some of these letters are already being used pretty widely,
     some not.  There are already three contenders for "Z" of which
     I am aware.  In each case, the compression/librarian method(s)
     indicated are mentioned as an aid to compatibility determina-
     tion, and neither a promotion nor derrogation of the software.

     Of course with a mere 26 letters to work with, this can quickly
     become congested.  I have probably inadvertantly missed one or
     more with significant popularity.  Fortunately, the writers of
     many file librarian-and-compression utilities have allowed for
     cross-system compatiblity, at least in the headers and specif-
     ications, and those for which it would be nearly meaningless to
     port any files, such as the Commodore 8-bit full-disk-zip, its
     Amiga counterpart, or any non-compressing librarian's output, a
     wide variety may be lumped under a single heading.

         A NodeDiff file, then might be retained as NodeDiff.J39 in
     the file area of one BBS,  .A39 on another, and .Z39 on yet a
     third, without confusion as to what is needed by the person
     running late with NODELIST.032.

     For comment, I can be reached at 1:310/5.1.  I cannot guarantee
     an immediate reply, but will appreciate any responses to this
     InterChange column.

     The SECRET C BBS

                        CXL and GUI_PROG Echoes

     When I first started the CXL echo my main motivation was because
     no one else was doing it, so I should. This came at a time when
     it was getting extremely difficult to reach the author of the CXL
     libraries for support. Little did we know at the time a process
     was being fianlized for the sale of CXL to IDC (Innovative Data
     Concepts) which in turn has now renamed the package to TCXL. So
     be it. The tagname for the echo is still CXL, but covers all
     phases of the package from past to present.

     For those who are wondering, CXL is the C Xtended Language add-on
     library that has given many C programmers (and wannabes) the
     ability to manipulate windowing and data field entry while not
     breaking any banks and no, I have nothing to gain by saying that
     here. The CXL echo is a user supported echo, but we are fortunate
     to have IDC available in the echo to answer our questions.

     The CXL echo is available on the backbone.

     The second echo I've started is tagnamed GUI_PROG. This may be
     confusing to some because most of us believe that to be a true
     GUI (Graphical User Interface) you have to be working with
     bitmaps and interfaces such as Macintosh Finder or MicroSoft
     Windows. But this is not the case. In this echo, even so-called
     "text-based" interfaces are discussed. In fact, it's amazing to
     see how many people don't realize that the DOS interface a lot of
     users are used to is really a predefined bitmap of characters on
     a grid layout (eg:25x80).

     So there you have it. The GUI_PROG echo encompasses the
     programming of interfaces. Whether be truly graphical in nature
     or psuedo-graphical/text-based.

     All environments, platforms, packages, compilers or languages are
     welcomed to be discussed as long as it has to do with interface
     programming. Currently, because the GUI_PROG is new, it's only
     available from myself (1:134/21), or from the Region 17 REC (John
     Souvestre - 1:396/1). If you want to get connected, netmail me
     and I can put it on hold from here or there may be a node in your
     area already getting it that I can get you connected with.

     FYI, I am now running an HST 14.4, but remain MO. The system is
     up from 5:00pm to 7:00am for now. I hope to be changing to
     continuous mail capable sometime in the summer.

                   The Realm of Insanity *** Brigadoon

     Brigadoon is devoted to the weirder things in life -- fringe
     groups, nonstandard religions, cult movies, bad audio and video,
     and certified maniacs and politicians.  The goal of Brigadoon is
     to allow the weird, the odd, the huddled masses yearning to free
     an electronic playpen in which to espouse their varied belief
     systems.  It is a netswork of losers, winners, dreamers,
     screamers, dragons, cats, witch's, whatever.

     Brigadoon postings is that they follow common-sense rules of
     echo procedure, whatever those are.  The big things are staying
     on topic in the specific base. Your welcome to carry just one or
     all of the echo's listed above.  If you have something weird and
     feel like you would like to add..feel free to speak your mind in
     Brigadoon City Hall.

     We make no distinctions as to age, background, religion, sex,
     gender, et cetera.  We are an Equal Opportunity Network, limited
     solely by the ability to move echomail around in a reasonably
     good manner.  Problems with offending nodes will be dealt with
     via the path structure of the network until it reaches Brigadoon
     Central (1:325/101) where we will deal with it as need be.

     A rough topology map will be compiled monthly to give Brigadoon
     users an idea of who gets the net from whom, and for new users to
     have an idea where to plug in.

     In closing, I point out that we are all of us doing this as a
     hobby, and will tolerate no politics or powerplays.  I hope to
     keep Brigadoon open and free for all by dealing with problems as
     they arise.  It is my hope that official regulations and
     policies will not be needed, to the enjoyment and betterment of
     all concerned.

                         SysNL v3.20 Open Beta Test Program

     Luke Kolin,
     Constellation Software,
     1:250/714@fidonet.org

      With SysNL v3.20 beta_iii, SysNL is commencing what I consider
     an "open" beta test program. This beta version will be freely
     available to all that desire it, from 1:250/714@fidonet.org, as
     SYSBETA.

      SysNL is an extremely fast nodelist compiler, supporting not
     only the usual (Version 5/6, QuickBBS, text lists), but it also
     supports SEAdog v4.51, RA v0.04, and it is the first compiler
     to support the domain-aware Version 6 list as found in Binkley
     v2.40 and up.

       I invite everyone to join the SysNL team - to take part in the
     development of a new piece of major FidoNet software. If you're
     interested in SysNL itself, or want to experience and understand
     the development of a software package, I invite you to join.
