     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

          Well, things  look a  little better  this week. I'm over the
     depression that lead to  last  week's  editorial.  However,  I am
     somewhat disappointed in the number of submissions still arriving
     not matching ARTSPEC.DOC. If you  need  a  copy  of  this,  it is
     available for  SEAdog style file requests from 1/1 and it is also
     available to  first time  callers for  downloading. It  is not my
     responsibility  to  get  the  specifications  to  you, it is your
     responsibility to get the document yourself.  I am  going to make
     it easy to match the specs.

          First off  the specs  are easy  to match.  There aren't that
     many rules. The first rule is no characters below space  or above
     tilde ("~").  This includes the tab character and characters with
     high bit flags (which I associate  with Wordstar  in the document
     mode).  The  second  major  rule  is  your line length can not go
     beyond 65 columns. Your text should  have a  flush left. MakeNews
     (the program  that puts  FidoNews together)  will indent the text
     for you. If you  have a  chart or  graphic picture,  by all means
     indent it.  MakeNews just inserts a few spaces before every line.
     The reason you shouldn't put in the spaces  as a  general rule is
     because  different  people  would  indent  a  different number of
     spaces and that would result in a poor  looking FidoNews.  If you
     want an  entry in  the table  of contents, your first line should
     start with an asterisk. This tells MakeNews to use this line as a
     table  of  contents  entry.  This  line  will  not appear in your
     article. If you want  a title  in the  article as  well, you will
     have  to  have  another  line  that  tells  the readers what this
     article is about. It is also suggested that you include your name
     and  a  network  address  either  at the beginning or end of your
     article. That's all you  really need  to worry  about inside your
     article.

          The  filename   you  submit   your  article  under  is  also
     important. MakeNews uses the file extension to determine the type
     of  submission.  "ART"  extensions are articles, "COL" extensions
     are columns, "NOT" means a notice and "SAL" is a for sale  ad. If
     you have  a series  of articles  or columns  you want to run in a
     certain order, you can easily number  your articles  so that they
     run  during   consecutive  weeks.  If  you  named  your  articles
     SAMPLE1.ART, SAMPLE2.ART  and SAMPLE3.ART;  SAMPLE1.ART would run
     the first  week, SAMPLE2.ART the second and SAMPLE3.ART the third
     week. This allows you to send in a collection of related articles
     (or  columns)  and  not  have  to worry about sending a different
     article each week. Instead you can send the  whole batch  at once
     and not have to worry about the order.

          The grand finale to all of this is a short submission tester
     I almost wrote. I have been  thinking about  doing something like
     this since  Bob Arnold  (editor of  the Opus Gazette) suggested a
     program  to  do  this  some  time  ago.  Due  to  the  number  of
     submissions not matching specs, I decided to write such a program
     last week. While it doesn't test for everything I'd like it to at
     FidoNews 5-15                Page 2                   11 Apr 1988


     this point. It does make for a start. Since I had the full source
     code to MakeNews, and  could easily  find the  section that tests
     article submissions I decided to try it the easy way. I called up
     Thom  Henderson  at  System  Enhancement  Associates  (who  wrote
     MakeNews) and  asked him if it would be alright if I "borrowed" a
     piece of his program and explained the reasons  why. He  was kind
     enough to  let me  do this, so I really didn't write that much of
     this program. Following this editorial, you will find  a complete
     source code  listing for  TESTART, the submission tester. In it's
     present state, all it tests for  is  that  the  file  you specify
     contains no illegal characters and that no line is longer than 65
     columns. Sometime in the future, I hope to  put in  sections that
     will  check  for  a  title  line  as  well as try and check for a
     netmail address. If you  write  these  sections  yourself, please
     send me  a copy  and I'll reprint the source code. Many thanks to
     Thom for saving me a few  hours work  (and hopefully  a few hours
     every week!).  If you  don't have access to a C compiler, you can
     file request (SEAdog style) the executable program from 1/1 under
     the magic  filename of  TESTART. If you can't make a SEAdog style
     file request, it is available for download to  first time callers
     in the recent uploads and FidoNews directories.

          Over the  next few  weeks, my editorials are going to vanish
     again. I'm working on a new MakeNews which may make  much of this
     unnecessary. I'm  trying to make more easily configured as put in
     some punitive formatting for those of you who  seem to  be having
     problems matching specs. This is unfortunately going to take some
     time away from FidoNews,  so  try  and  keep  to  the  specs I've
     outlined.  Until  the  next  time  I have some words of wisdom to
     impart....

     "Did You See THAT"?  An appropriate title for this article, based
     on a running joke on my BBS, started by Keith Vogt, I believe.
     The object of the joke is: there was nothing to see!

     Last November, Thom Henderson asked me to do a guest editorial
     for FidoNews on why "FidoNet isn't fun anymore".  Here it is,
     Thom.  Greatly late.  I plead it is no fun to write about not
     having fun.

     The article I composed the first time around was so damned
     depressing I destroyed it.  In this rewrite, I will be quoting
     from recent FidoNews editorials and articles.  I have done this
     as I know no other way to convey the sense of what I feel.  I
     have made no attempt to quote in completeness, the selection is
     arbitrary.  If I have quoted someone out of context, it is
     unintentional.

     "As alot of you know region 18 went thru alot of flexing
     and turnoil in the last several months. For those who don't
     know, our regional coordinator was replaced without hardly a
     wisper in the middle of the night. We had no say. The zone
     coordinator said it and it was done."

     "The new region 18 coordinator is a nice guy. Means well
     and all that, but I have to wonder if FIDO would have wanted
     it that way. I mean you know what happened in Boston some
     years ago. Something about the rights of the governed."

     FidoNews 5-05, Page 12, 1 Feb 1988 by Ben Mann


     "Why do I bring this up? Because FidoNet is based on RELIABLE
     communication between systems. While many may only be concerned
     about EchoMail, there is much more to FidoNet than EchoMail. This
     isn't to say that EchoMail isn't important these days, because it
     is. EchoMail may be one of the most important concepts ever
     introduced to FidoNet. But EchoMail is only a part of FidoNet,
     and even it is based on reliable communication. While catching up
     on some EchoMail conferences this past weekend, I noticed how
     this idea seems to be fading. If it ever does vanish, we may very
     well see the end to FidoNet. After all, if I can no longer count
     on my mail getting through, why bother sending it at all."

     "Another idea that seems to be vanishing is RESPONSIBILITY.
     FidoNet is not a right. When you joined FidoNet you were
     accepting the responsibility for several things. Primarily to
     "not excessively annoy others," "not be easily annoyed," and most
     FidoNews 5-15                Page 6                   11 Apr 1988


     important of all to make your node available only to other nodes
     during National Mail Hour (NMH). While NMH may be a little
     outdated these days with so many running continuous mail programs
     like SEAdog and BinkleyTerm, it is still important to observe
     NMH. Many nodes are unable to process mail at anytime of the day,
     and can only send and receive mail at specified times. To these
     people, NMH is the only way they can reliably send and receive
     mail. When the nodes they're trying to contact are always busy
     due to receiving a large batch EchoMail or allowing users, it
     only serves to annoy others. In time, it could even be classed as
     excessively annoying."

     "New software could easily cause the net to come apart in days.
     The base FidoNet protocol is very important. Any program meant
     for use in FidoNet NEEDS to be able to fall back and use this
     original. Without this, no one would ever know where it was safe
     to try sending mail. While this may be considered archaic by
     some, it is the basis of this network. Without complete
     compatibility, we are endangering something that many of us have
     worked hard to see continue. I ask that all network software
     authors keep this in mind, lest they become known as the
     destroyer of FidoNet just because they need the ego trip of a
     "title" like creator of whateverNet."

     FidoNews 5-08, Pages 1 and 2, 22 Feb 1988, by Dale Lovell


     "To say a bill of rights is needed in FidoNet is like saying a
     drain plug is needed in the swamp. "Sir, I have no time to drain
     the swamp, I'am to busy fighting the aligators." Region 18 has a
     new EchoMail coordinator. Located in a non-PCP city.
     Good thinking. At least he has a 9600 baud HST and a sence of
     humor. The sence of humor is more important."
     "Every NC in Region 18 cast their vote (pun intended) and the
     outcome was a new EC."
     "Can anyone anywhere tell me why and how this happens? Does a
     friend of a friend call someone late in the night and make the
     change? Are there greater forces (farses) at work?"

     FidoNews 5-09, Page 9, 29 Feb 1988, by Ben Mann


     "It used to be you could trust what you read in EchoMail, not to
     mention FidoNews. Everyone treated FidoNet (and it's users and
     sysops) with respect and decency. If you received a netmail
     message from someone, you knew it was legitimate. Likewise, no
     one would have thought of impersonating anyone in EchoMail. What
     brings all this up? Let me tell you..."

     "I thought it very odd when some messages supposedly written by
     Thom Henderson popped up in the sysop echomail conference. I
     thought it very odd because they didn't sound like Thom, besides
     which I was under the impression he was leaving FidoNet alone.
     Well, the other day I received a phone call at work. Even though
     Thom is now in AlterNet, we keep in touch. This was unusual only
     because I was the one who usually placed the call. Thom's main
     FidoNews 5-15                Page 7                   11 Apr 1988


     reason for the call was to find out if I had seen any messages
     from him in the sysop echomail conference. After a long
     discussion with Thom, I am convinced that he isn't the one who
     sent those messages. If you've received a nasty message from
     Thom, odds are you've been hit by someone with a juvenile
     mentality and no respect for FidoNet."

     FidoNews 5-10, Page 1, 7 Mar 1988, by Dale Lovell


     "I've gotten a few people upset by referring to FidoNet as a
     "mature technology". Those of you who would dearly love to "play
     games" with the protocols (like the late, unlamented Yahoo
     experiment) rail at that designation, but in few (if any) cases
     have I been allowed to explain. By "mature" I mean that it is no
     longer solely (or even mainly) a province of the hackers. Few on
     your network either know or care how the stuff works. All they
     care about is that it does. And THAT is the true strength of
     your network, if you would only realized it. A percent or two of
     performance, or a widget or two that maybe three out of three
     thousand will use, is of little import compared to the mighty
     throng to whom your network is a powerful tool for COMMUNICATION.
     It is for them that Tom Jennings, Randy Bush, Ben Baker, and
     myself saw the need for a standards committee, because for THEIR
     needs stability is more important than widgets."

     "One of the people who has benefitted most through this approach
     now believes that the time has come to get rigorous. To only
     implement to published standards. To not "make a big deal of

     We still have work to do. To limit what we can do in the
     network to published specifications would be very wrong at this
     point. We still need to properly implement direct interzone
     mail. To add other protocols to our abilities, particularly
     such things as the Janus protocol and the X.25 code that is
     apparently working out so well in Europe, neither of which would
     have happened if we only allowed our mail transfers to take
     place using protocols documented by the FTSC. Why did I cough
     (an impolite thing to do while someone else is talking)? Well,
     to my knowledge there is no FTSC document describing SEAlink
     protocol, SEAlink Overdrive, passwords in packet headers,
     procedural guidelines for password mismatching, the so-called
     "BARK" method of requesting files from a remote system, or even
     the addressing method used by the author of the previous article
     (the address was in the form "net1/node1-net2/node2" where
     apparently you need to send mail for net2/node2 to net1/node1
     but who can tell without a document?)."

     "BBSs have escalated in complexity way out of proportion to their
     usefulness; most BBSs are used by highly skilled people with lots
     of resource$ to talk to people like themselves. This is fine, but
     most of the world isn't in the position to sit $1,000 (or more!)
     in a corner of the room for one special purpose only.

     Also, the trend is towards larger, more complex systems, wide
     area networking, extremely high throughput data transfers and
     other things that just push the likes of Fido, Opus, TBBS an
     order of magnitude or two out of the range of many (if not most)
     people who might benefit from them.

     Seems we've forgotten that the original intent of BBSs was to
     communicate with other people. It is not obvious to me that
     talking to more people is better. The best BBSs I've ever used,
     of any type, were all very small systems; RCP/Ms, Apple][/GBBS,
     etc. Most used awful software, but were still the best (meaning

     most useful or most amusing) systems I've run across. There's a
     hint there, I think."

     From Puppy's Documentation by Tom Jennings.


     Dear FidoNet Leadership, Echomail Leadership, and IFNA:

     I have quoted above from several recent issues of FidoNews.  I
     did not quote from SYSOP, IFNA, or POLICY4; I try to limit my of
     depression to the Minimum Recommended Daily Allowance.  I had to
     go back to FNEWS3xx to regain mental balance before continuing
     this missive.

     Gentlemen, we have a problem in FidoNet.  You, as leaders
     (elected, appointed, self-appointed), have failed miserably.  The
     time came and went to exert any sort of control over the anarchy
     reigning in FidoNet.  You have allowed distrust to permeate the
     very heart of FidoNet.  Hang your heads in shame.

     There, I feel better.

     Should we blame the leadership (actually, the lack thereof)?  No.
     If we must place blame, look into a mirror.  We, the sysops of
     FidoNet, have allowed this to happen.  We have allowed this to be
     done to us.  We can stop it.  Without destroying the net.

     Step number 1 - join another net.  This eliminates any control
     the IC, ZC, and RC have over you.  Dave Dodell, as IC and ZC, or
     Ray Gwinn, as RC, can delete my node number from the nodelist and
     Maltese Alien wouldn't skip a beat.  Things might be delayed
     while my friends changed mail destined here from one node number
     to the other, it would be minimal.

     Step number 2 - don't join IFNA.  Without members or membership
     dues, IFNA is nothing.

     Step number 3 - Assume tyrants run the backbone and stars.
     Decide how to pick up echoes if the tyrant gets out of hand.
     These days, control of echomail is often control of the net.
     Some of you are using echomail as weapons, withholding it from
     nodes you don't like.  Or in an attempt to usurp power from your
     net coordinator.  You remind me of slugs and cockroaches.

     Step number 4 - Quit reading the "sysop" echoes.  There are two
     sorts of people who participate in them.  People who care and
     irresponsible egomaniacs bound and determined to bend the net to
     their will.  You can tell the difference by who supports
     elections for net positions and those who crave "back room"
     politics.  I say to the people who care, "Quit talking and DO IT
     NOW".  Would Dave Dodell or Don Daniels stand in the way of an
     elected IC who received 2000 votes?  For that matter, who would
     care if they did try to stand in the way?

     Step number 5 - Ignore the egomaniacs.  These people enjoy
     arguing.  Some don't even use their real name.  Like spoiled
     FidoNews 5-15                Page 10                  11 Apr 1988


     children, they will sulk home crying if ignored.  Too bad, eh?

     Step number 6 - What do your USERS (remember them?) want from a
     BBS?  Could it be that TJ is right?  Do we need ten terabit per
     second transfer rates, full screen color Word Star compatible
     message editors, multiple options on questionnaires, and all the
     other bells or whistles?  Before you answer, ask your users for a
     candid evaluation of what is important on your BBS.  What do they
     enjoy?  Are you a "good sysop?"  You may be surprised.  I was.

     Step number 7 - Ignore the people who abuse echomail by trying to
     tarnish someone's name.  These people are the lowest scumwads
     around, seeking attention like the naughty spoiled rotten
     children they are.

     Step number 8 - If all else fails, pull the plug on FidoNet.  If
     we are worth anything as sysops, our users will NOT abandon us.
     They are our friends first and users second, right?

     Step number 9 - Ignore this article.  Thinking about solutions to
     problems and acting on them is much harder than sitting back;
     waiting for the nodelist and echomail to arrive.  If you take an
     active part in shaping FidoNet's future,  you can't blame someone
     else.  Be an Ostrich sysop, do nothing except take and take and
     take and take......

     Now I go back to being happy.  You see, I don't read the "sysop"
     echoes.  I don't acknowledge Dave Dodell's authority, the worst
     he can do is delete my node from the nodelist.  Who cares?  I
     won't renew my IFNA membership.  I won't lose any sleep if
     FidoNet comes crashing to a halt because of improperly designed
     or incompatible software.

     Don't get me wrong.  Dave Dodell, Don Daniels, Butch Walker, Bob
     Hartman, Thom Henderson, Vince Perriello, and others too numerous
     to mention are fine people.  We owe a great deal to many people.
     However, it does not follow that fine people make fine leaders.
     Nor does it follow net developers make fine leaders.  In simple
     terms, all of the current problems can be traced to absent or
     inept leadership.

     I will help anyone I can.  I will do what I can to assure mail
     moves from here to my friends.  I will ask my USERS (remember
     them?) what they like.  I will treat honest people honestly and
     ignore the ignoble slobs abusing echomail.  I will test new
     software to make sure it doesn't break anything on another's
     system (the egomaniac net developers might not test it too well,
     if at all).  I will ignore flames and messages from anyone
     ashamed to use their given names in echomail (hear that you
     sleaze bags hiding behind pseudonyms?). And I will end this
     article to go cough up a lung by the random group that meets at a
     wide spot in the road.

                        WARNING TO LAP-TOP OWNERS

     The other night while walking home with my lap-top slung over on
     my back as usual, the plastic D-ring connecting the strap to the
     bag suddenly snapped and, before I even realized I had a problem,
     my Zenith 183 crashed to the concrete.

     Incredibly enough, when I checked it all out on the train, it
     seemed to still be functioning fine although the case was broken
     and the latches don't work.  (When I expressed surprise of its
     survival to a Zenith official he was less so, saying that they
     are specially engineered, well, not for that exactly, but
     certainly for the odd bump or two).

     However, if this can happen once it can happen again and as I
     know of several other Zeniths in the Net I thought a word to the
     wise would be in order.  Note that this happened with no apparent
     wear whatsoever -- the ring just gave out.  Zenith (which BTW has
     been very responsive on this and an earlier software incompat-
     ability I experienced) has requested the D-ring for analysis.

     I'd suggest that ALL lap-top owners regulary check their cases
     and rig up some kind of a back-up to protect from failure of the
     weakest link and the sickening feeling I experienced.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                      Episode 6:  Starting a FidoNode



          I've wanted to  start  a  FidoNode  since  I  first heard of
     FidoNet.   I've  been  intensely  interested  in  FidoNet and its
     survival and expansion as long  as  I  can remember knowing about
     it.

          Well, the  time  was  drawing  near;  Money  just  isn't the
     problem now that it once was.    This is the time to do all those
     things that one just never gets around to, for whatever reasons.

          I don't want  to  go  part-way  into  FidoNet;  when my time
     comes, I want to dedicate a system  to the FidoNet.  So now's the
     time to buy that spare  computer  (prices  on  XT compatibles are
     incredible right now!), put one  of my hard disks into it and get
     that FidoNode going.

          My housemate just put a damper  on  my enthusiasm.  He's put
     his system up as  a  part-time  BBS  and  -  lo  and behold - has
     joined the FidoNet.  I am now an assistant SysOp on EagleTech BBS
     (1:128/31).  But my foot's  in  the  door to FidoNet, and someday
     I'll have my own Node.

          But just what is it like to  bring up a FidoNode these days?
     Most of you know, since most of  you are FidoNet SysOps.  But for
     the future FidoNet SysOp out  there,  here's a little heads-up on
     our experiences.

          First, we were fairly  convinced  we  were going for Opus or
     Opus/Binkley as our setup.  Most  of  the boards around town here
     run Opus, some with SEADog or  Bink as a front-end.  Well, we may
     be better off than we were,  but  we're  not rich.  $100 for Fido
     and  $60  for  SEADog  just  didn't  cut  it  for   starters.   I
     personally planned to  go  to  SEADog  after  awhile because I've
     seen it run and I like  the  way  it  interacts with human users.
     So I was biased to pay the  $60  for  SEADog after we were up and
     running.

          Then a friend  suggested  QuickBBS,  commenting  that he was
     HIGHLY impressed with it.    So  we  borrowed a copy of it, being
     shareware and only $25  if  you  go  for  it.  Seemed like a good
     price.

          So my housemate loaded  QBBS  and  got  the DOCs printed and
     FidoNews 5-15                Page 13                  11 Apr 1988


     started to set it up.    We  were  almost  there - minor problems
     getting the  modem  to  behave  properly  with  QBBS  -  when the
     computer came up with "Internal  Stack  Failure - System Halted".
     My home-built system gets  that  a  lot if you hold down on a key
     with the  keyboard  in  fast-repeat  mode.    The  keyboard  flat
     outprocesses the system  and  blows  it  open (custom BIOS is the
     culprit, I believe). But his system NEVER gets that error.

          His system refused to boot, and  the dual-colored LED on the
     second hard disk was red and  flashing instead of green and being
     happy.  We disconnected the culprit drive and the system booted.

          After farting around with the  drive, we found an arm inside
     the chassis which said "DO  NOT  TURN"  on it, we turned the arm,
     replaced the drive and all  was  fine  -  except all the data was
     gone.  Somehow we'd overwritten  the  809  cyl/6 head format with
     information that  it  was  615  cyl/4  head.  We  just re-did the
     low-level format, then reformatted the drive and went on our way.

          The main drive  had  been  backed  up,  but  QBBS  was being
     installed on the  drive  that  went  bye-bye  on us, so it wasn't
     backed up.  Unfortunately,  all  my  housemate's archives were on
     that drive.  No backup.    You'd  think  we'd known better, being
     programmers.  Hmm.  Perhaps a message here...

          I still had his  nearly-fully-configured  QBBS on my system,
     but by this time, for a multitude  of reasons, he decided to take
     Opus from the Net Host's board  and  grab a PC FOSSIL driver from
     a PC user in the Net.  So it was like starting over.

          We hacked through the  setting  up  of  Opus, and eventually
     found that, for whatever  reason,  using  a  9-pin serial port to
     the modem didn't work right,  while  using a 25-pin serial worked
     just fine.  That could  easily  have  been  what was keeping QBBS
     from working; we may never know.   Armed with a 25-pin RS-232 COM
     port, my  housemate  got  Opus  up  and  running,  and  proceeded
     to try to test it both local  (keyboard)  and remote modes.  We'd
     though ahead in this area; we already had two phone lines.

          Good to go on February 29,  1988.   Need I say what happened
     on March 1st?  You  guessed  it  -  good  old  Opus 1.03a had its
     little date problem,  and  another  day  or  two was lost getting
     upgraded to 1.03b using FIXDATE.COM.

          Now armed with  1.03b,  my  housemate  sent  a  Network Mail
     message to the Net Host requesting  a node number, which has been
     approved, and by the time you  read  this in FidoNews should be a
     part of the National NodeList.

          I'd like to thank all the  people  that helped get EagleTech
     BBS up and running  cleanly,  especially  Richard Evers, Net Host
     of Net 128 and  Joe  Rock  (128/15),  whose  technical assistance
     reduced  the  headaches  of  starting  a  FidoNet  BBS  to a mere
     irritating itch.  It's really not as bad as it seems.  :-)

     Administration and Finance Committee
     1:148/122

                      CREATION OF AN IFNA "JOB BAG"

     Being volunteers, there just isn't enough time available to do
     many of the things that we would like.  Either we don't have the
     time to adequately define a job or, when we need something in a
     hurry, we can't seem to find anyone to help out, and end up doing
     it all ourselves, perpetuating the cycle in the process.

     There are a couple approaches to addressing this concern.  One
     will be the establishment of what has been called an IFNA
     'head-hunter' -- essentially an internal 'personnel office' that
     maintains resumes of candidates for certain IFNA posts.

     Leading up to (or concurrent with) that, we are establishing the
     IFNA Job Bag.  Any IFNA officer or Committee Chairman will be
     able to submit jobs to the Job Bag.  These will then be
     advertised here and volunteers will be able to respond to a
     centralized clearing-house.  Actually, we're not 100% sure as to
     how this will all work because, as can be seen below, one of our
     first jobs is that of running this effort for the Administration
     an Finance Committee.

     Please respond to 148/122 if you are interested in taking on one
     of these jobs.  And please don't be upset if it turns out you are
     not selected -- there should be plenty more to come!

                             IFNA JOB BAG

     JOB                                                        EST.
     NO.  JOB TITLE                    TYPE       FOR          EFFORT

     001  IFNA Job Bag Manager         Perpetual  Admin Comm.  3hrs/wk
          This person will establish the procedures for the IFNA Job
          Bag, post qualified requests received, accept and screen
          applicants, and make the assignments in some cases.

     002  IFNA Statistician            Perpetual  Admin Comm.  3hrs/wk
          This person will collect and maintain various historical
          data relative to FidoNet and will provide services to the
          other areas of IFNA.  Should have the expertise to answer
          questions like "What is the projected rate of growth for
          FidoNet in 1989?"  "How many nodes will there be in 1990?"

     003  NodeList Editor              Perpetual  President    3hr/mo
          The Nodelist which IFNA licenses to DAK will be replaced
          periodically.  Each time, it will have to be edited to
          remove non-applicable entries (a list of these will have to
          be maintained) and shipped to them in an appropriate format.
          When required, turn-around time must be immediate.

     PLEASE, do not bother to respond to any of these unless you are
     sure you have the resources to do a good job!

                     IFNA Status Report for April 1988


     PROGRESS DURING THIS PERIOD

     General

     One of the major problems facing IFNA is the fact that, as an
     all-volunteer organization, we are all subject to many outside
     influences on our limited time to which we attach higher
     priority.  As a result, our good intentions for IFNA are not
     realized.  This is very apparent to the officers of IFNA, but,
     because we don't adequately report this to our membership (that
     time bugaboo again) the membership feels free to create its own
     reasons for our setbacks.

     This is an area which we are now trying to address.  To begin
     with, I'm making reporting to the membership my highest concern.
     I've instructed the Committee Chairman to restructure their
     committees so that each includes its own Executive Board.  The
     intent is that they will run each committee while the Chairman
     need only be responsible for general direction, management, and
     reporting.

     There are so many things that we are trying to undertake to do
     that there is no way to get it all done.  We could/should cut
     back on our scope of effort, but the membership keeps rightly
     clamoring for services which they feel are needed.  It is our
     intention to make a reality of IFNA's original goal: to make
     it and FidoNet equivalent by expanding IFNA's operations
     throughout the entire membership.  Expect to see quite a few
     opportunities for this in the future.

     This is not a "we vs. them" situation, despite misconceptions to
     the contrary by a few.  It is only all of US struggling to do
     what's best for FidoNet.


     In order to cut-down on the length of this report, the usual
     PROGRESS/PROBLEMS/PROGNOSIS format has been combined.


     ADMINISTRATION AND FINANCE

     Under the brand new Chairmanship of Greg Small in Canada, this
     committee spent most of this period trying to get itself
     organized.  There are quite a few ideas underway whereby this
     committee will truly provide the needed administrative services
     the rest of IFNA requires, such as committee operating
     procedures, information repositories and services, and job
     handling and personnel functions.
     FidoNews 5-15                Page 20                  11 Apr 1988


     BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     The BoD has experienced quite a few technical difficulties with a
     recent change of topology and the resignation of its moderator
     Bob Hartman who feels that he no longer can give the level of
     effort required.


     BY-LAWS AND RULES

     I was expecting a verbal report from Steve Jordan on some
     concerns relative to this committee but it has not been received
     by press time.  Work is underway trying to make the By-laws
     reflect the desires of the membership, but its almost impossible
     to know what their concensus is.  We are looking into taking some
     straw votes on certain issues in order to write modifications for
     presentation in time for the summer voting.  It appears that
     other pressures are calling upon those most active in this
     committee and that they will have to augmented, if not replaced.


     EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

     Essentially, our tie-ups with other concerns have left little
     time for efforts here.  However, it was decided to proceed with a
     member's offer to provide an independent report on IFNA's books
     for the period prior to 1988.  The process of copying all the
     necessary information and forwarding it on to the CPA has begun.


     INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS                    N

     For the most part, this Committee is only operating in Europe as
     there are too many obstacles yet to be resolved for full
     international involvement.  There are still very real concerns
     relative to the ZoneGates.  Not so much in the technical sense,
     but the financial.  This is a very expensive undertaking which
     IFNA would like (but is presently unable) to be better able to
     address.  Europe will be having their FidoCon in southern Holland
     the last weekend of June.


     MEMBERSHIP SERVICES

     This is one of the committees that has been involved in
     discussions regarding the missions of various committees and how
     we might better define and structure them to meet all our goals.
     As this committee is so important to our future support and
     success, particularly from the user community, it is a prime
     candidate for reorganization and expansion.  Part of these
     discussions have been consideration of such items as the IFNA
     "Head Hunter" for pre-qualifying individuals for certain jobs so
     that we don't go into panic mode everytime an xC or committee
     chairman steps down.  NOTE: this would be a SERVICE which any
     authority in the Net could ELECT to utilize.

     FidoNews 5-15                Page 21                  11 Apr 1988


     There appears to be a need for some regional FidoCons.  This
     would help to get more people involved and, through direct
     interaction, aware of our true situation and objectives.  The
     problem with this is the work getting it to happen.  Essentially,
     it must be left to the various regions to provide the necessary
     level of effort required, but we could provide some expertise and
     general support.

     A lot of people have worked hard to produce audio and VCR tapes
     at two of the FidoCon meetings.  We are still struggling to find
     a way to get them out to the folks who want them.


     NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS

     This committee has suffered from a recent change of chairmanship
     but appears to be making necessary efforts to meet the By-laws
     requirements for this summer's elections.  David Garrett has just
     stepped right into the firing line on this one.  No status
     report was received for this period.


     PUBLICATIONS

     The committee has reviewed the existing FidoNews publication
     policies and has determined that they should be confirmed for the
     present.  There are still quite a few issues to be resolved
     relative to the format of FidoNews and any possible additional
     publications.

     Tim Sullivan says, "I must reiterate that neither this committee
     nor the BoD decides what is/is not published in FidoNews on a day
     to day basis, that is the job of the Editor.  The Editor does
     what an editor is supposed to do: manage and run the day to day
     affairs of the newsletter.

     "We still receive article submissions that don't even come close
     to specs.  This is resulting in Dale spending much more time than
     should be necessary preparing each week's issue."

     He also report the problems with lack of time.


     TECHNICAL STANDARDS

     No written report was received.  I did have a chat with Randy who
     described a few happenings and concerns but, frankly, it was so
     late at night that I can't remember them, let alone repeat them.
     Hopefully, we'll have a report next month.


     ETHICS COMMITTEE

     This is a new Committee just getting underway.  No report was
     received from its Chairman Bill Allbritten.

     VP-TC

     Dave Dodell (with his IC hat on) reports, "Still trying to get
     South America on line on their own.  Granted them Region status
     so they could have a little more independence, but that has not
     come about.  Every time I give them a block of node numbers to
     use, they reinvent the wheel with numbers that they want to use.

     "Also will be breaking the eastern half of Canada into a new
     region within the next couple of weeks.  This is also to give
     them some independence on a national level.

     "Have been working with Randy Bush and FTSC to develope an
     assignment scheme for nets/region numbers.  At the moment,
     there is no clear formula to assignment of regions to zones,
     and nets to regions."


     FIDOCON LIAISON

     This report did not come through the Vice-President (liaison
     according to the By-laws) but was received directly from Tim
     Sullivan.

     "Monies have been received from IFNA to aid in start-up costs.
     We have spent much time organizing and assessing future
     directions.  Early registration has been opened up.  Vendor and
     Attendee information packets are being developed.  The business
     of putting on an international conference is progressing on
     schedule [although] there never seems to be enough time or
     resources available.

     "Because the SYSOP of our registration node 1/88 moved, accessed
     to this board was interrupted and should be back on-line shortly.
     We are still soliciting speakers for the conference.  We have not
     yet found an appropriate guest speaker for the banquet.

     "Registration will be in full swing and we will try to
     accommodate most special requests.  The attendee information
     packets we hope to have ready for mailing by mid-May.  We may
     delay this if registration is slow.  Site preparation and planing
     will also be an area of concentration.

     "After a rough start planning and preparation for this event is
     in full swing.  We are VERY optimistic about the quality of this
     year's conference.  Much effort is going into this event to
     ensure a success.  However, net participation is the key to great
     time.  IFNA can help by encouraging participation by all members
     of FidoNet.  I would like to see more discussion about FidoCon'88
     in Echo areas just to bring about more awareness.  Any help along
     these lines would be appreciated."
