     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     An interesting week...no?

     Thanks go out first to Jim Barchuk, who has managed to fix the
     problem with the mail server at the FidoNews web site at
     http://www.fidonews.org.  With that, a number of articles and E-Mail
     came tumbling forth, to be published in this issue, as well as adding
     a bit of delay to the publication this week through volume and the
     ANSI characters to boot throwing the software out of whack...

     Just as interesting is the selection process used to implement the
     ELIST in Zone 1...not so much the technical aspect, but the lack of
     investigation into the claims being put forth.

     Like a good illusionist, the audience is drawn to the object that the
     illusionist wants you to see, while making you forget the rational
     part of your mind that wants to know how it is done...or why.

     It's called 'misdirection'.

     One has to ask why such claims are being made by the RECC, when the
     person behind the effort has yet to be asked a single question about
     the content.

     And, I suppose, it goes to further their own agenda which has yet to
     be as fair or open as they have collectively claimed it to be.

     But, for now, Thom LaCosta has been named by the RECC as the new
     EchoList Coordinator in Zone 1.  Our congratulations to his
     appointment...as defined in existing rules and procedures.

     And, as it may be interesting to note, a long-time critic of this
     Editor puts forth the idea of a change to the way in which the
     FidoNews is published.

     Hmmmmmmm...

     Interesting that someone from a society where free speech and free
     press makes such suggestions, while another reader from a society
     in which such freedoms have been restricted in the past asks for the
     FidoNews to remain the same.

     If nothing else, it makes for an interesting contrast in what is and
     is not taken for granted when one lives in a society where freedom
     has never been so constrained.

     Other than this, there is little news that came forward this week,
     though we do have a message from Peter Karlsson, who apparently has
     better connections to the FTSC as a 'member in limbo' than I have as
     a full member...but inquiries into the reasons why still go
     unanswered.

     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 2                    6 Jul 1998


     How odd.

     And just as interestingly, we hear from the "Zone 7" members...a sign
     that there is still hope for FidoNet, if only they can be allowed to
     develop as their own Zone.

     Added in here is another reminder to all who submit articles to the
     FidoNews that the "flush left, margin 70" standard is the one thing
     that will guarantee that your submission will be edited to meet.
     Among the submissions in the 'flood', only two were compliant to the
     FidoNews specifications.

     And, lastly, the issue of advertising in the FidoNews...

     I asked for particulars on this some time back in the FIDONEWS echo
     and received some comments, but recent events (and submissions) have
     caused me to re-open the request for comments.

     Interestingly enough, some of the comments suggest that I am asking
     only to justify doing this...especially in the light of one such
     request offering to sponsor or even _buy_ advertising space in the
     FidoNews.  There has even been a threat to stop distribution of the
     FidoNews based on the same innuendo and assumptions that Fido has
     become trademarked for of late, rather than on any basis of fact.

     More on this in a moment...

     The reality, as those who have made the innuendo that has become so
     very typical in FidoNet of late, is that I would like to formulate a
     specification for myself and future Editors (if any) to operate from
     as to which types of advertising are 'acceptable' to FidoNet sysops.

     Should the FidoNews reject *ALL* advertising?  Should it accept only
     that advertising which is _directly_ involving FidoNet, to the
     exclusion of such things as TCP/IP-capable hybrids which also
     incorporate Fido technology (programs such as ARGUS, TransX and iFTP
     come to mind)?

     Or should the Editor decide on a submission-by-submission basis as to
     what may be of interest to FidoNet sysops?

     The issue of payment for advertising in FidoNews is without merit,
     since FidoNews is free, distributed for free and there would be no
     possible way to determine who to pay any such fees to, let alone for
     what purpose they would be used for...or by whom.

     In simpler words, no paid advertising will be done in the FidoNews.

     If any company submits software for review, no 'quid pro quo' is to
     be expected, nor is one offered other than a legitimate and earnest
     assessment of the value and usefullness of the software...and even
     then, it would be more likely to be turned over to another sysop to
     perform the review itself, as chosen by the Editor...to do otherwise
     is to merely open the door for a 'ringer' to be used.

     At least, lacking any more suggestions, this is the _intended_ base
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 3                    6 Jul 1998


     for the proposed advertising specification.

     But, the question still remains...and although I have many responses,
     including those sent to be posted here, the direction is not there.

          Should there be *no* advertisements?

          Should there only be Fido-based advertisements?

          Or is there a 'middle ground' that is acceptable to
          all that meets and satisfies as many as is possible?

     And, in reference to the pause above, how very interesting that
     for a 'tabloid-style' publication, which is 'losing readers' for
     being so 'biased', that several companies have decided that the
     FidoNews is of sufficient distribution to be 'useful' to them.

     In all, an interesting week...no?

     =================================================================

     RESPONSE TO EDITORIAL IN FIDONEWS OF 29 JUN 1998

     By Kent Anderson, 1:382/92   kand@onr.com

     In Fidonews V15N24, in part of your editorial, you said this:

       "In other news, the battle to wrest control of the EchoMail
       Listing has now moved into high gear, with the RECC all but
       demanding that the Z1C choose a particular system."

     I am a long time hangout in the Moderator and ZEC echos, and am a
     Moderator, (Memories) so I have to wonder where did this "battle to
     wrest control take place?" There was an outcry from Moderators when
     John Souvestre reported Adrian Walker's alleged wish that the
     Echolist be turned over to Peter Witschi, the Zone 2 Echolist
     Coordinator. I have been told that Zone 2 operates under an
     unratified Echopol which much resembles a certain ECROC, so
     why would I want my echo handled in Zone 2.

     Adrian Walker was never anything but helpful and nice to me, so I
     have no quarrel with him, but his departure did appear to me to be
     much like that of a child throwing a temper tantrum. He certainly
     did not do it with the grace and dignity of Mich Fuchs, who had the
     courtesy to see that the robot was smoothly passed into Adrian's
     hands. Thus, there was no disruption of Echolist updates. We might
     say that the uproar, or stink if you will, was caused by this
     tantrum.

       "Odd how this came out immediately after the existance of other
       ELIST systems was announced in the FidoNews."

     But, I think you tie their action to the wrong event. Your mention
     in an earlier Fnews did not name any specific echolists other than
     the Zone 1 and Zone 2 echolists. We Moderators, all along, have been
     aware that there were other, smaller echolists. In Zone 1, however,
     the major one has been the one which Adrian's Robot faithfully
     handled each month. In the Moderator Echo and elsewhere, Thom
     Lacosta announced that he had what he believed to be an excellent
     replacement system for Adrian's robot, and offered to run an open
     test of it to see if his assessment was correct.

     There was a tremendous response from Moderators, and it became
     obvious that his system's performance was very, very good, and it
     was then accepted by many, if not most of the Moderators who had
     input to it. So, recognizing that Moderators should have the major
     influence in selection of such a system used, the RECC's were kind
     enough to "suggest" to Bob Satti that Thom's system be awarded the
     title of "Echolist Robot" under a separate node number to
     distinguish it from Adrian's old system. In my considered opinion,
     not only was this move not politics but a recognition of the desire
     of Moderators as expressed by many, many of them. As I see it, it
     was done to help keep a political battle from erupting, and in
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 5                    6 Jul 1998


     consideraton of the necessity for getting an operating Echolist
     Robot in place as quickly as possible.

       "One would think that a more prudent RECC would look at all of
       the   accesibile systems before settling on one...or is this just
       another jab at the ZEC, and the RECC refusal to work with him?"

     You may manufacture any scenario you like out of it, but how do you
     know the RECC didn't look at others, but recognized and supported
     those most affected rather than some other faction?

       "More odd that the RECC would claim that the ZEC is supposedly to
       'moderate and present' to the RECC, but then turns around to lock
       the ZEC out of discussions, then claim that the ZEC is not doing
       his assigned duties."

     If the ZEC is Bob Kohl, he has also said that the Echolist should be
     above politics, and your charges of some political agenda driving
     toward the selection of Thom's system appear to me to be totally
     manufactured and paranoid.

       "But then, these are also the same people who present in their
       erstwhile ultimatum to the Z1C that they wish the ELIST process
       to be above politics, while using the same proposed system as a
       political tool."

     I believe my other remarks have covered this.

     > In response to the editor's opinion that the RECs have posted the

     First point, the ZEC duties were written with input not only from the
     RECs, but from the sysops of Z1 themselves. There was no single
     author to the list.

     More to the point is some of the RECs convenient use of the list
     selectively without "remembering" that the list also notes the use
     of an interim ZEC.

     > The RECC charges that the ZEC is inactive, ineffective in his job,
     > and is not taking care of his responsibilities.

     Particularly true, I was indeed busy with personal business as
     happens to us all from time to time.  On the other hand not competely
     true since Bob Satti had noted to me early on that Adrian was going
     to leave Fidonet. When I was elected, I started sending out netmail
     looking for a replacement for the Elist keeper. In the end, there
     were two individuals that were working on a replacement for the
     Elist:  Thom (the appointed replacement Elist keeper), and Marshall
     Presnell.  Marshall is a professional software engineer and has been
     for years.  Marshall was also a Fidonet sysop for many many years.
     He offered to help and, as Thom was, in the process of building an
     Elist replacement.  As things progressed, I continued to give
     feedback on the issue to the ZC in an impartial manner as I felt I
     was expected to.

     In the end, Thom was selected by Bob, and my congratulations or
     condolences as the case maybe.

     I did find it interesting that some of the RECs "jumped" on the
     bandwagon after I noted that there were two projects in the works
     in national echo areas.

     Wrong, as noted both in the REC echo and in other echos the question
     was one that was brought to me by the *C side and possibly looking
     for an alternative to the normal means of an RC dealing with the
     issue.

     There is nothing wrong with looking for an alternative means to deal
     with an issue except of course when it's turned around to make it
     look like there's political motivation involved.  According to Ben,
     there's a deep dark implication at any question that might lead to
     evolution in the way things are done to keep an issue on the *EC side
     instead of involving a *C.

     >  He soon removed an NC.

     I'd like everyone to remember Ben's statement that what goes on in
     Reg 10 is none of his business.  Sounded good at the time, didn't it?

     > His REC quit, saying that he could no longer stand working with
     > Kohl.

     Ben's memory of the time line is a bit shakey.  The REC quit before
     any action about this issue took place.

     > He disclosed some in-transit  netmail.

     Ben also likes to paint with a very broad brush. There were two
     complaints brought up. One was dismissed, the other was explained
     and apologized for.  Someone sent me netmail and I cc'ed Bob Satti
     when I responded. While technically it is disclosing in-transit
     mail, it isn't to the degree that Ben would like to make it out to
     be since neither Bob Satti or myself would be inclined to run
     around discussing the nature of that netmail.  Bob was cc'ed since
     I did note to the sender that I would no longer route her mail.

     > Are these the actions of a active, effective, responsible ZEC?  Can
     > you honestly say "yes" in good conscience?

     Can Ben accurately make some of these statements in good conscience?
     Moreover, is this the same Ben Hamilton that suggested to a sysop
     that he should change his node number to poll someone?  Using an
     unissued nodenumber?  Ben should spend a moment reading P4.

     > and how.  Please be specific.  And if a sysop-level vote is so
     > great, why was the recent R10C election only an NC-level vote?

     Ah yes, once again Ben should be reminded of his extremely short
     and yet convenient memory when it comes to his own statements.  Ben
     forgets that he stated that the affairs of Reg 10 were none of his
     business in the last issue of the snooze.

     It should also be noted that we have another REC in a national echo
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 8                    6 Jul 1998


     condoning packet ramming to an echo without permission of the
     moderator.

     I find it interesting that two of the REC's are now suggesting
     behavior that is generally frowned upon or considered illegal per P4.

     In the course of "trial by public opinion, hearsay and innuendo",
     I find it interesting that good old Doc Logger has never bothered
     to take the time to confirm any of the information that he continues
     to process in his little diatribes.

     It reminds me of the old days when we had such prominent gossips
     like Hedda Hopper, Walter Winchell, etc.

     Given Doc's use of such gossip without any regard to fact or fiction,
     I formally suggest that the editor make Doc the official "gossip
     Queen" of Fidonews.  It would certainly fit his writing style and
     the "old hen" mentality that he subscribes to so well.

     What's the problem now?
     by Gary Gilmore, 1:2410/400

     I was rather disappointed in the editorial written by Zorch in the
     last Fidonews regarding the Elist.  Forgive me, but I need to quote
     in order to state my views on the matter.

     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 10                   6 Jul 1998


     >In other news, the battle to wrest control of the EchoMail Listing

     Why is this a battle?  The RECC -and- the Z1EC have done nothing
     but battle with each other over almost anything said, but meanwhile
     OUR echolist was going away.  Too busy peeing in each others
     sandboxes, the Elist did finally disappear, when (thankfully) Thom
     Lacosta stepped up and said he not only had software to handle the
     job, but was willing (silly fool) to DO the job.

     The RECC/Z1EC were finally distracted from their "did too!/did not!"
     petty bickering long enough for someone to do something, anything
     about the situation.  Thank God!

     Maybe this is a beginning where the REC/ZEC will start working again,
     rather than spending all their time fighting.  I honestly hope so.
     If not, then perhaps we need to replace the whole damn lot of RECs
     and Z1EC, and replace them with people that give a damn about Fidonet
     first, and not their own petty desires and disagreements.  (Now
     there's a thought!)  They are ALL guilty for the lack of movement, no
     matter what they (all sides) want us to believe.

     >has now moved into high gear, with the RECC all but demanding that
     >the Z1C choose a particular system.

     I saw the original letter to Bob Satti regarding this.  It did not
     look like a "demand" to me, but rather a recommendation.  However,
     I know of only ONE REC (R11's) that bothered to get the input of his
     region BEFORE jumping in and saying "Yea" to this movement. (Yes, I
     asked friends in other Regions about it.)  THAT should be the
     problem, not the decision itself.  (Those in other regions should
     wonder if their REC is acting autonomously, and not getting YOUR
     input on matters that effect each and every node in their region.)

     >Odd how this came out immediately after the existence of other
     >ELIST systems was announced in the FidoNews.

     What announcement?  It must have been made in Portuguese, since -I-
     never saw it.  I'm one of hundreds of echo moderators, and no one
     bothered to ask MY input, no one bothered to tell/ask ME anything.
     I think most other moderators are in the same boat.  It would be
     nice when decisions affecting OUR echos were at least run past US
     once in a while.  It's pretty easy to find us, since almost all
     moderators -are- listed in the nodelist.  (And netmail -would- be
     the way, since not all of us want to read the fight-filled "fidonet
     operations" type echos...  we have real lives.)

     Instead, our echos are treated like the kids in a bitter divorce,
     with the parents (the RECs, the ZEC, and the "backbone providers")
     all pulling at us as a weapon against the other side.  I don't want
     to speak for all moderators, but I think most of us are pretty sick
     of it.  Grow up, boys and girls.

     >One would think that a more prudent RECC would look at all of the
     >possibile systems before settling on one...

     Prudent?  How long -should- we wait for a replacement to the Elist?
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 11                   6 Jul 1998


     How long would we wait if the Nodelist was suddenly gone, due to
     someone being childish and saying "it's MY program, and you can't
     have it, nyah nyah!"?  (And yes, I think it was childish of Adrian to
     "take his ball and go home".)  About 10 seconds is how long we'd
     wait.  Echomail is THE most important force in Fidonet, IMHO.  (And I
     completely disagree with Bob Satti's old decision that "echomail is
     not Fidonet".  Yes it is Bob, and that decision is what opened the
     can of worms... thanks.)  Take away the Echomail from your system for
     a month, then come back and tell me how many users you still have on
     your BBS, or if you don't have a BBS, tell me how exciting Fidonet is
     now that you don't have echomail.

     Maybe it's time for the moderators and users of echomail to take back
     echomail from those that use it like a weapon against each other.
     It's OUR echomail, and we shouldn't allow ANYONE to use it as a
     political football, or send it's control over to other zones, or as
     a means to make money while imposing additional control on its
     distribution, moderation, or use.

     >or is this just another jab at the ZEC, and the RECC refusal to work
     >with him?

     Jab, schmab.  Perhaps, for a change, someone getting off the "attack
     metality" mode and doing something for a change.  I think that the
     Z1EC -and- the RECC should have done something about this long ago,
     and done it together.  (How many months have we all known the Elist
     was going away?  Two?  More?)  All parties are guilty here.  Not just
     Bob Kohl, not just any one REC, but all of them together.  Stop the
     fighting and nitpicking, and do the damned jobs you were elected to.
     A truce should be declared, and a new beginning should start, one
     where they all try to do something for US, the sysops of Fidonet,
     rather than push political agendas and attack mentality (from BOTH
     sides).

     Those involved also need to drop their silly "secret" mailing list to
     discuss ZEC/REC matters, and get it all back into the echos designed
     for such purposes.  Nothing can be accomplished while those involved
     "hide out" in a mailing list away from the other side, and this shows
     a complete lack of desire to get a working relationship going again.
     Again, all sides (ZEC and REC) are acting childish in this whole
     matter.  Both sides, shake hands, share your toys, and start worrying
     about Fidonet FIRST, please.  We'll all be better off.

     >More odd that the RECC would claim that the ZEC is supposedly to
     >'moderate and present' to the RECC, but then turns around to lock
     >the ZEC out of discussions, then claim that the ZEC is not doing
     >his assigned duties.

     I don't think the Z1EC has really done -anything- yet.  This also
     means that he hasn't done anything wrong (in the title of ZEC), nor
     has he done anything to move forward.  Likewise, I don't think the
     majority of RECC has done anything since the new ZEC took office
     except to attack and -keep- him from doing anything.  Again, both
     sides are to blame here.

     This constant tit-for-tat mentality is keeping all parties concerned
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 12                   6 Jul 1998


     from accomplishing anything for the good of Fidonet.  That's a shame.
     You had someone that lost the ZEC election as a REC, leading a charge
     to attack Kohl.  What is that?  Sour grapes?  Then you have Kohl on
     the attack against that.  Do I think Bob Kohl has done a good job so
     far as Z1EC?  No.  He's done nothing that I can see.  Have the RECs
     done their jobs?  No again.  Everyone seems to be too wrapped up in
     the whole "let's get <whomever>" frenzy.  It's a no-win situation,
     and the sysops are the losers.  Wake up, RECs and ZEC.  Drop the
     childish fights, and work for US, not in your own interests.

     >But then, these are also the same people who present in their
     >erstwhile ultimatum to the Z1C that they wish the ELIST process to
     >be above politics, while using the same proposed system as a
     >political tool.

     I disagree.  I don't see Thom Lacosta being "political", (why,
     lately, does everything have to be political in Fidonet anymore?)
     nor do I see him "siding" with one or the other in the battles we've
     all had to endure around the various "Fidonet" echos.  I think Thom's
     Elist works well, and every echo I moderate or co-moderate is listed
     on it.  I strongly support Thom, and I think the numbers of
     moderators that -have- listed their echos with him speaks for them as
     well.

     That's my take on the matter.  Your views will probably differ, but
     all I can ask is that your respect mine as I will yours.

     "Building a Better Fidonews"
     by Andrea Santos, 1:135/382

     Fidonet has long had a newletter for its membership, affectionately
     referred to as "The `Snooze" and, as irony would have it, the
     nickname has been a fairly apt description for most issues.  How else
     to explain the abominably low readership levels attained by a
     publication which Fidonet Coordinators are required to make available
     to keep members informed? Coupled with regular doses of political
     conjecture, which the average sysop detests, it's little wonder one
     of the first electronic publications has been deemed boring and
     devoid of content which interests a larger audience.

     In reviewing the usual content, format, latest, greatest and oldest
     software listings, page long PGP signatures, etc., the `Snooze reads
     like a repetitive semi-technical document.  Perhaps it's time to
     break with a tradition that isn't working and get a community effort
     involved.

     With that said, I've put together a preliminary outline for a "new
     and improved" Fidonews.  Some of this is generally covered in
     ART.SPEC.

     The outline is suggestive only.  Whether further consideration would
     be given depends entirely on feedback provided by sysops directly to
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 13                   6 Jul 1998


     the Editor and the Editor's receptiveness to the suggestions.

                               NEWSLETTER OUTLINE

     Suggested Positions

     Maintains list of those carrying newletter via Web sites/ftp, submits
     new additions to the Fido WebRing, or anything else related to
     Fidonet which appears on the Web, ie., the addition of new Net or
     Region Web sites, Fido Boards accessible via telnet, ftp.  Contact
     point for all such submissions.

     - Satirists (2-3)
       submit "lighter side of fidonet" or other such amusing wit.

     Other than "Editor," the rest of the positions wouldn't be "official"
     per se, nor are these suggestions all-inclusive. What we do need is
     Fidonet, the Community, to make it happen, and this outline serves to
     provide basic organization, which is presently lacking.  Hopefully,
     the end result will be regular involvement in producing a weekly
     publication that sysops will WANT to read and find meaningful.

     Why???
     by Jayson Taylor 1:120/107-mechanic@netquest.com

     In these times of FidoNet seemingly dying in North America, one would
     think that the creation of a new net would be a good thing, right?
     Well, the powers that be seem to think differently.  They would
     rather hagle over false boundry lines.

     I am not looking to "grind my axe" here, I am just trying to get the
     word out about this, and hopefully get some feedback on it.  Here is
     the complete story of my strugle to create a new net.

     I live in Pontiac, Michigan in the USA.  I wanted to hook my BBS
     into FidoNet because I truely enjoy exchanging messages with others
     around the world.

     Much to my dismay, there were no local hubs in my area of North
     Oakland County, Michigan.  After talking to several other SysOps in
     my area, we thought it would be a good idea to put in a requisition
     for a new net number.

     So, after reading the all mighty Policy 4, section 2.4, I went ahead
     and created a proposed node list and did research on our closest net,
     net 120.  Net 120's published boundries cover only Southern Oakland
     and parts of Macomb County.  Not one single hub in Net 120 is a local
     call from my area, so I figured there would be no conflicts with them.

     I then sent all of the proposed information to the RC for our region,
     just like Policy 4 states I am to do.  He replies to me that he can't
     do anything because Net 120 is supposed to have control in the
     proposed area.
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 15                   6 Jul 1998


     I stated to him that this is ridiculous, because not one single hub
     in Net 120 is a local call for any of the SysOps in my area wanting
     to join FidoNet.  I explained that this defies all logic in that it
     would never be free to exchange Netmail.  Echomail is not much of a
     concern becuase we could get it via FTP if we have to.

     After typing until I was blue in the fingers, I have gotten nowhere.
     This is clearly wrong, and I turned to FidoNews to get the word out.
     I hope some of you reading this can understand my frustration, and
     give me some feedback on what would be a good next move for us.

     Thank you for reading, and I hope to hear from you soon.

     =================================================================
                                  COLUMNS
     =================================================================


     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who was
     busy deciding which of the four tasty peanuts he'd eat. The
     peanuts were offered as the inflight meal by an airline
     which should remain nameless but whose stewardesses are
     world-renowned for surliness. To give this some perspective,
     Leona Helmsley would be counted as too polite to qualify as
     a stewardess on this airline.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     The good folks at Swamp Swine magazine were in high dungeon
     when I submitted the latest batch of petty cash vouchers.
     They claimed that there was something suspicious in the fact
     that I listed five cases of Glenlivet as "Lobster
     Repellent." Their argument was that lobsters were repellent
     enough on their own without being drunk. The case would be
     hard to disprove since no life form in the Maritimes appears
     to be sober for long, particularly the cheerful souls who
     drive the logging trucks on the scenic back roads.

     I see that the genius of Henk Wolsenk continues to shine
     through in the ZCC echo where he was busy trying to insult
     Ward Dossche. Henk is the stellar intellect who asserted
     that he supported representative democracy but promptly bent
     over for Satti and is now sniveling about an elective policy
     being continued in Germany. Our prayers and our edible
     underwear should go out to Henk in his hour of need.

     I see that his Zorchness got his policy complaint against
     Ruth Argust rejected as well it should have been. Zorch was
     even keen enough to offer a "complaint kit" to other Region
     10 NCs so that they could follow his bizarre lead in
     attempting to foster Kohl's vendetta. The funniest part of
     Zorch's complaint was where he accused Ruth of lying. What
     makes this so terribly amusing is that the accusation comes
     from the man who hasn't quite answered whether he voted
     twice in the ZEC election.

     Zorch: Did you vote twice in the ZEC election?

     David Calafrancesco, Bob Seaborn, and a raft of others have
     been patiently trying to explain to Kohl why his version of
     the echolist robot was dismissed in favour of a more
     trustworthy system. Since the echolist robot is another
     function of Fidonet which has escaped the tentacular grasp
     of Kohl, we can give thanks to Thom Lacosta for saving us.
     Kohl was economical with the truth in terms of the timing of
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 17                   6 Jul 1998


     his various pronouncements and it is a great pleasure to see
     that the RECC have unanimously chosen a process that will
     keep the echolist functional.

     In other Region10 news, it seems that a new R10EC has been
     appointed. It is quite amazing the progress that can be made
     by Kohl after just three months of brain-numbing thought.
     The new R10EC appears to share Kohl's subtle grasp of
     technical performance so it should be mid-September before
     she can directly connect herself to the RECC echo.

     Brenda Donovan, Kohl quisling extraordinaire, still hasn't
     answered any of my queries. I would have added a new
     question as to how five alleged NC votes magically appeared
     in the last 2 1/2 hours of the voting period but even asking
     could probably cause her to blow the same headgasket she
     overheated when she objected to Region10 being polled by
     "outside agitators."

     It seems that commercial interests are knocking on the
     Snooz's door, wondering if the last bastion of militant
     public domain publishing can be whored to their causes. I
     suggest that advertising of commercial interests should be
     banned from the Snooz with the single exception of those
     companies that manufacture electric artichoke steamers.

     I must go Visage, your secretary is back in the office and
     she is definitely not a happy camper. Andrea Santos sent us
     several tons of shark gizzards which reek only slightly less
     than Region10 politics. I may have to take her to Zurich
     with me next week so that the office has a chance to air
     out.

                             of Internet.

       This is only nodelist statistics, without points. If I'll count all
       the points, then Russia will be, IMHO, about 1/2 of world FidoNet.
       Abroad Russia point systems are not widely distributed.

       Think about the reasons of FidoNet shortage. If it because of
       Internet only?

       Or because of absence normal fast IP and modem routing scheme,
       absence of regional and European backbones? And so on, and so
       on. Ward included Internet Nodes into nodelist, but, may be,
       as a "last chance" for FidoNet. European fidonetters must
       consult with their Russian collegues, or FidoNet in Europe
       will die soon.

       P.S. For example, I'm trying to get UK echoes from November, 1997.
       Nowadays process was stopped after Cliff Harold passed away.
       Another examples are with international echoes. Without backbones,
       we have only a few message in them, then traffic rises, and gets
       down again.

     P.P.S. Sorry for my bad English.

     Greetings,

       I was just browsing FIDONEWS from June 15th and saw an article
     saying you're looking for a list of FIDONET nodes on Internet.

      My Amiga BBS serves a web page at http://tfbbs.tvinet.com and
     provides telnet access via a BSD like TCP/IP stack. It has been on
     a 24x7 dedicated connection since late March 1993.

     I'm located in Region 17 (Vancouver, BC Canada) Node: 1:153/765.0

     To: editor@fidonews.org
     Subject: Policy

     Thank you for taking the time to read my e-mail. My name is Randy
     Mitchell. I'm co-sysop of "The Collin County Station" in
     McKinney, TX. I also run a point from the same board.

     The reason for my message is to find out where I might be able to
     locate a cite in FidoNet rules, regulations, or policy about posting
     practices and norms. I know that most of what needs to be known about
     posting messages in certain echoes are basic common sense, but
     occasionally, as you may well know, one runs into a person who
     doesn't have a clue as to what policies should be adhered to.

     Let me give an example:

     A few postings in a specific echo are of a particular subject and one
     of the participants make a claim that sounds rather unbelievable. He
     is called upon to back his statement up with cites and the sources of
     the cites, but refuses to do so claiming that the other participants
     should look up the site themselves.

     Now I know something of this nature may sound petty and childish to
     FIDONEWS 15-27               Page 21                   6 Jul 1998


     even be concerned about, but it would be advantageous to those who
     enjoy a good debate or discussion to have something in writing with
     which to quote from when being faced with a situation such as this.

     The moderator of the specific echo I'm concerned with doesn't seem to
     want to get involved in the discussion and there really is no need.
     I don't believe any rules have been broken (other than drifting from
     the topic:-) ever so slightly ) .

     Once again, I thank you for your time and look forward to hearing
     from you in the future.

     > one 'official' announcement has yet to be made...

     To the best of my knowledge, there is no "requirement" that such
     a thing should be announced in FidoNews. While I can see why it
     could be a good thing, I don't think it's really required. Those
     who are interested in the proceedings of the FTSC should read the
     FTSC_PUBLIC echo (which, I admit, I forgot to post my announcement
     to).

     Anyway, I've not officially resigned yet, since they others are
     deciding whether to allow me to contine after dropping down to a
     point system (I don't want to tie my main computer up with OS/2
     all the nights, because I cannot use it to logon remotely over
     the network). I'm planning on returning to node status when I can
     afford a harddisk for my secondary computer (which probably will
     not be until the autumn), and then I will ask if I can be
     "re-instaded" (if they decide to kick me out now).

     Hello Bob,

     I claim to not publish the comercial news about
     acounts or trial soft.
     This would be only the beginning of a real commercialization
     One has to defend it in the begining yet.

     The most interesting part of the fnews is allways the first part,
     were (like in a telegram) the Big F's of the Fidonet are announced.

     more of them!

          Pages listed above are as submitted to the FidoNews Editor,
          and generally reflect Zone and Regional Web Page sites.  If
          no Regional site is submitted, the first Network page from
          that Region is used in its place.  Generally, Regional pages
          should list access points to all Networks within the Region.
