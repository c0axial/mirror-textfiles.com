                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     A report last week that FidoNews had been censored by an unnamed ZC
     turned out to be a difference of opinion on what constitutes a case
     of censorship.

     When I first started editing FidoNews, I added a FidoNews public-key
     section to the newsletter for those who wanted to send things to the
     FidoNews privately or clear-signed. ZC1, to whom I feed FidoNews for
     worldwide distribution, suggested such an addition be removed due to
     the possibility that such an addition might compromise laws in other
     countries. I removed the key segment itself and replaced it with the
     note about the removal pending a decision by the ZCC on its inclusion.
     This was a voluntary act on my part in response to the request by ZC1.

     After polling the ZCs, personally, via direct Netmail and receiving a
     majority having no problem with the key segment being included in the
     FidoNews, I returned the segment to each Issue without fanfare or
     complaint.

     While the segment was missing from the FidoNews it was available on
     FidoNews webpage. I never considered it censorship of any kind. I may
     have thought it overly sensitive but I understood the intent and
     complied voluntarily. So, no blood, no foul. Case closed.

     Speaking of the dreaded Internet, there are several additions to the
     Regional listings in today's Issue. The R19 page has changed from the
     inactive listing to the working one and R41 [Greece] has been added as
     well our first listing in Zone 4 at Net 904 in Argentina. Normally,
     Net level listings appear only on the FidoNews webpage but since Zone
     4 has no listings at all, Net 904 is there to see if it can stimulate
     some action in that area of FidoNet. [grin]

     The only Regions missing in Zone 1 are Region 12 and Region 13. Does
     anyone out there know if they have webpages? Please point them in
     this direction. Thanks.

     For those who hate the technical history section, you're really going
     to dislike this one. It contains the EMSI standard proposal in toto.
     History is good. There are less than 40 to go and all of them are a
     lot smaller.

     These things that repeat are here in each Issue because any one Issue
     may be the only one a newbie sees that might bring them into the fold.

     C.B.

                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================


     From Pete Snidal, 1:354/910 - Grand Forks, BC Canada

        Excellent ideas expressed in the last FNEWS over redundancy in
     technobabble which most of us never read, and also in this great new
     letters-to-ed idea.

        I write in query to whether anyone else has noticed a disturbing
     trend I've been watching going down on CBC (Canadian Broadcasting
     System) TV from Montreal.  (I get it on my sat dish, and consequently
     get to watch CBC Montreal and Toronto as well as Vancouver, even
     though I live out West.)

        Since I live out west, all I've seen of this trend is a few
     commercials on Montreal TV, but it looks like it could be sticky.
     What I'm referring to is what appears to be a CelTel provider calling
     itself, of all things, FIDO!

        That's right!  FIDO!  The ads started late last summer, just little
     shorties, saying nothing but stuff like:  "FIDO IS COMING!" Now,
     though, they're right into it, announcing how they provide a multitude
     of _Communications_ services, of all things!  CelTel, voicemail, ISP
     perhaps, what's next - AOL-style bulletin board?  Hey, that'd be nice!
     A little confusing, perhaps, what with their coverage area - whatever
     it is (Montreal?  Quebec?  Canada?  North America?) - sure to have a
     whole mess of existing FIDO bulletin boards already.  (In fact, I
     think I saw the word NET in there somewhere in the last FIDO ad or
     two.)

        So what's happening here?  I thought there was a
     copyright/trademark/whatever on the FIDO name.  Apparently not; they
     seem to have gotten past whomever you apply to for corporate monikers.
     Do they even know about Fidonet?  I don't imagine so.  What are they
     going to have to say when they discover this upstart network of
     computer hobbyists using "their" name?  They've obviously spent
     too much money already and are too committed to the name to change
     themselves.

        How did this happen?  Where's it going to lead?  Has anyone else
     noticed this?  What the (*&(% is going on?

        Sincerely,

        Confused.

     Lock and Load: Guerilla Marketing for BBSes
     Robert Parson 1:3822/1

     After mulling over the idea for several weeks, I have decided, for the
     second time in my career, to write a column.  I really should have
     learned my lesson the first time.

     At one time, Fidonet stood on the brink of being THE Network for
     international computer based communications.  Let's face it, that
     opportunity has been lost because of the dynamic growth of the
     Internet.

     So what.

     In my previous column, I wrote something along the lines of "BBSs will
     become the convenience stores of electronic information.  They'll be
     useful for getting some quick information, but you'll have to go to
     one of the commercial services if you need if you need to get
     serious."

     That comment was made about two years before the breakout of the
     Internet, but I generally still hold to it, except you probably should
     change "commercial services" to "the Internet."  Be that as it may,
     and I'm sure you agree with me, BBSs still provide a useful and vital
     communications link.

     There's no reason why BBSs should continue to do their work in
     obscurity and be considered the shadowy side of electronic
     information.  To that end, I'm offering to help through this column.
     With "Lock and Load," I hope to give you the ammunition you need to
     raise public awareness of your BBS.

     You cannot compete with AOL or even your local Internet Service
     Provider.  You don't have the money or the manpower.  I'm going to
     look at helping you market your BBS in your community using just a few
     hours and less than 20 dollars a month (with a target of Zero dollars
     a month!)

     What makes me audacious enough to think I should write this column?
     That's a fair enough question.  First of all, I am a broadcast
     journalist with nearly 20 years experience.  Secondly, I wrote The
     "BBS Guide to Public Relations" some years ago (by the way, it's still
     available for download at Jackalope Junction BBS (1:3822/1), but is no
     longer being actively supported.  Among other things, I need to
     completely overhaul the file.  Perhaps I'll get to it one day).
     Thirdly, I want to be of help.

     Now the groundrules.  I am going to deal only with Public Relations
     and Public Image issues in this column.  If you contact me in E-mail
     or somehow track down my home phone, I will be happy to discuss
     particular issues or problems at no cost.  If you send me snail mail,
     FIDONEWS 14-14               Page 4                    7 Apr 1997


     please include a self addressed stamped envelope if you expect a
     response (Hint: I love getting BBS newsletters.).  I'll print my
     mailing address in this column occasionally. Any discussions or
     correspondence could become fodder for this column.  Unless
     specifically requested, your name, BBS name, and node number could be
     included in the article.  I will NOT be writing this column weekly.
     but it will be in every other issue of Fidonews.  At least until I run
     out of things to say.  These groundrules are subject to change.  But I
     will let you know in advance.

     Okay, now with all that out of the way, let's roll up our sleeves and
     get to work.

     Order some business cards.  Nothing fancy.  Just the name of your BBS,
     your name and title (I suggest System Operator since the average Joe
     on the street is not going to know what a Sysop is.), the number of
     the BBS and your voice phone.

                   Sample Business Card:
                   _______________________________________

                                  Newsbob BBS

                                 Robert Parson
                                System Operator

                   XXX XXX XXXX Data    Voice XXX XXX XXXX

                   ________________________________________



     You can probably get these pretty cheap at the printshop or you can
     make your own using a desktop publisher.  If you decide to make your
     own, you can get blank card stock at just about any office supply
     store.

     While you're at it, get some letterhead.  Order it at the same time
     you order your business cards.  Again, though, if you decide to make
     your own letterhead, you can usually turn it into a template in your
     desktop publisher or wordprocessor.

     Your BBS may be "Just a hobby."  But at the same time it's bit of a
     profession.  You should present a professional image in any dealings
     with the "outside world," even if your BBS is primarily a gaming BBS.
     Keep in mind "professional" doesn't mean "not fun."

     Now I want you to get out your phone book and get the phone numbers of
     the newsrooms for all the newspapers and television and radio
     stations.  Over the next couple weeks I want you to collect from
     newspapers: the names of the Business Editor (if they have one) and
     the Editor, the fax number to their newsroom, e-mail address and their
     mailing address.  From radio and tv stations: the names of the News
     Director, Assignment Editor, and Public Service Director (if they have
     them), the fax number, e-mail address and their mailing address.

     In most cases, they will be happy to provide you with the information,
     although they may want to know who you are and why you want it.  Be
     honest.  Tell them your name and you would like to send them some
     information soon.

     In two weeks, we'll discuss what sort of information to send them.

                  Security Passwords in Nodelist Update Files

         Status of this document:

              This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
              community,  and requests discussion and suggestions for
              improvements.  Distribution of this document is subject

              SysNL is a program by Luke Kolin.

       PURPOSE

             This document is intended to explain the format and purpose of
       security passwords within nodelist update files, and to inform the
       authors of nodelist software about its proper usage.

       THE NEED FOR PASSWORDS

             Until now, the nodelist update files that *Cs create with
       software packages such as MakeNL or SysNL have had no security
       passwords inside of them. The only security between the NC and an RC
       has been the name of the update file itself. For example, the name
       of the Net 250 update file was "Metronet.250". It was quite
       conceivable for a sysop, upon discovering this name, to make a
       fraudulent update file, also called "MetroNet.250", and send this to
       1:12/0. The nodelist processor which created the regional update
       file at that end would not know that the file was not genuine, and
     FIDONEWS 14-14               Page 7                    7 Apr 1997


       this would be added to the weekly update for the region.

       PASSWORD FORMAT

             It seems emminently logical that some sort of security
       password should be added to nodelist update files, to prevent the
       aforementioned problems from occurring. Therefore, I propose that
       nodelist update files have an optional password in the first
       (header) line, right after the ";A" general interest flag. The first
       character of this case-sensitive password shall be an "at" sign @
       (ASCII decimal 64 hex 40). If this character is present, then all
       characters after it, until (but not including) the next space (ASCII
       decimal 32 hex 20) will be considered part of the password. As well,
       no password may be 8 characters or more in length. This is a sample
       header line, with a password of ConSoft present:

       ;A @ConSoft Net 250 nodelist file for Friday, February 22nd : 10344

             Please note the password starts right after the first space
       (ASCII 32) with the ASCII 64 decimal character, and is case-
       sensitive. The following is a sample header, without a password
       present:

       ;A Net 250 nodelist file for Friday, March 1st : 13501

       NOTES

             It is extremely important that the password be on the first
       line of the nodelist update file. It must commence immediately after
       the first space (ASCII 32) character, with an ASCII 64 "at" sign.
       Remember, it is case-sensitive.

             I believe that it is up to the authors of individual nodelist
       utilities to deal with the presence of passworded update files as
       they believe fit. However, it is my belief that utilities, when
       faced with a file with a bad password, retain a copy of a previous
       (good) update file, which should be used instead of the bad one, to
       prevent the equally nasty problem of a bad update file preventing an
       entire network/region from being included.

             Please note that I do not participate in either the FTSC or
       NET_DEV conferences. I can be reached at 1:250/714@fidonet.org, or
       in Imex at 89:480/210@imex.

         This document obsoletes EMSI_003 and any previous document
         describing the EMSI, UZAP, and/or IEMSI handshake protocol. I
         apologize for the lack of proper state charts. I am currently
         under a fairly heavy work-load and thought it would be better to

         Restrictions
         ==================================================================
         EMSI/IEMSI may be used by any developer as long as these

         specifications may be implemented independently of each other.

         EMSI/IEMSI may be used free-of-charge by any developer for any
         purpose, commercially or otherwise. In creating EMSI/IEMSI, we are

         PART I

         Introduction
         ==================================================================
         The EMSI/IEMSI handshake protocol allows for maximum flexibility
         in E-Mail session start-up and control. The YooHoo (FTS-6)
         standard, designed by Wynn Wagner III, was a good idea, but did
         not allow sufficient room for growth and cannot be used in 7-bit
         environments.  EMSI/IEMSI should provide for virtually unlimited
         growth and expansion of its own scope. By providing variable-
         length packets, EMSI/IEMSI is capable of being as simple or as
         complex as necessary and entirely backwards compatible when new
         features and/or protocols are added.

         All EMSI/IEMSI packets and sequences consists of 7-bit printable
         ASCII characters. This format allows us to establish a universal
         handshake between "PCs" and "mainframes" alike. The more
         complicated the computer system, the more restrictions affect its
         I/O; there are many I/O channels that cannot transmit control
         characters such as XON and XOFF; for this, we have created a
         universal handshake protocol that uses all printable characters.

         EMSI/IEMSI does allow control and 8-bit ASCII characters to be
         transmitted. This is, however, accomplished by escaping the data
         and converting it to 7-bit printable ASCII characters.

         Data layer
         ==================================================================
         EMSI/IEMSI is a protocol based on multi-character sequences rather
         than single character flow control. There are several advantages
         of using several characters rather than just one, but there is
         also a drawback. On very poor-quality telephone lines, EMSI will
         most likely require several retransmissions of packets since line
         noise usually come in bursts. That aside, there is little
         advantage in using a protocol based on single characters.

         All EMSI/IEMSI sequences are terminated by a single <CR> unless
         otherwise specified. This is necessary to force some data
         collection equipment to flush their buffers. Appending <CR> to
         EMSI/IEMSI sequences in a FidoNet environment is a delicate matter
         and it is important that you follow the notes regarding this.

         Note regarding file requests
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The file request concept mentioned in the EMSI document refers to
         WaZOO style file requests as specified in FTS-6. No other file
         request mechanism is supported in the EMSI specifications.

         Separator usage
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         To designate the fields within the EMSI/IEMSI packets and retain
         complete transparency, both start and stop characters are used.
     FIDONEWS 14-14               Page 10                   7 Apr 1997


         The ASCII1 type is used for all fields within the packet. This
         uses the brace characters to delimit the fields. The '{' (ASCII
         123) character is the start byte and '}' (ASCII 125) is the stop
         byte.  If a stop byte is used as literal data within a field, it
         must be transmitted twice. The end of a field is designated by a
         stop byte that is not followed by another identical stop byte.

         The ASCII2 fields are delimited in exactly the same way, but use
         the square brackets as delimiters. The '[' (ASCII 91) is the start
         byte and ']' (ASCII 93) is the stop byte. ASCII2 is used to
         delimit data within the ASCII1 extra_field information.

         7-bit data restriction
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         It is the developer's responsibility to ensure that the software
         generates EMSI/IEMSI packets and sequences containing only 7-bit
         (00H through 7eH) printable ASCII characters.

         It is recommended that all EMSI/IEMSI implementations strip the
         high-order bit of all received characters prior to processing the
         packet/sequence and prior to calculating CRC values.

         CRC values
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The polynomial used to calculate a 16-bit CRC is the same
         polynomial used in the Xmodem file transfer protocol. The
         polynomial used to calculate a 32-bit CRC is the same polynomial
         used in the Zmodem file transfer protocol.

         Binary values
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Since the EMSI environment specifies only 7-bit printable ASCII
         characters to be used, binary values, such as CRC and length
         descriptors are expressed as a four character hexadecimal string.
         The only exception to this is a 32-bit CRC value which is
         expressed as an eight character hexadecimal string.

         The application must treat them case insensitive, eg. ffaa should
         be treated identical to FFAA.

         Handling 8-bit data
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Although EMSI only uses 7-bit printable ASCII characters, there is
         an escape mechanism that allows systems to transmit control and 8-
         bit ASCII characters without the requirement of an 8-bit data
         link.  The escape character is a backslash character ('\') and is
         followed by two characters in hexadecimal notation. Eg. "\80" is
         the ASCII character 128. To insert an actual backslash character,
         two backslashes are used ("\\"), or a backslash followed by the
         hexadecimal code for a backslash, eg. "\5c".

         The hexadecimal code following a backslash MUST always be two
         characters, ie. to insert ASCII 15 (hexadecimail 'f'), the result
         would be "0f". All hexadecimal sequences must be treated case
         insensitively.

         PART II - Electronic Mail Standard Idenfitication

         Connecting two EMSI capable systems
         ==================================================================
         This assumes that the two systems are connected and that no data
         has been transmitted by the Caller.

         It should be mentioned that sending/monitoring for the "YooHoo",
         "TSYNC", and other protocol start characters is optional and not
         required for a strict EMSI implementation.

         +-+-------------------------------+

         In steps 1 and 2, both the Calling and Answering system terminate
         all sequences with <CR>. In step 3, the Calling system does not
         terminate sequences with <CR> as it is explicitly transmitted
         after possible protocol start characters. In step 4, the Calling
         system once again terminate all sequences with a <CR>.

         All processing of the information in the EMSI_DAT packet must be
         done after transmitting EMSI_ACK twice to the remote system. It is
         recommended that an EMSI_HBT sequence is issued once every seven
         seconds while such processing is taking place to avoid unnecessary
         handshake collissions. Emitting EMSI_HBT should only be done when
         it is obvious that the remote system is waiting for the second
         phase of the EMSI handshake to take place.

         EMSI packet and sequence definitions
         ==================================================================

     =====================================================================
         EMSI Inquiry
         **EMSI_INQ<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI Inquiry is transmitted by the calling system to identify it
         as EMSI capable. If an EMSI_REQ sequence is received in response,
         it is safe to assume the answering system to be EMSI capable.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI Request
         **EMSI_REQ<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI Request is transmitted by the answering system in response to
         an EMSI Inquiry sequence. It should also be transmitted prior to
         or immediately following the answering system has identified
         itself by transmitting its program name and/or banner. If the
         calling system receives an EMSI Request sequence, it can safely
         assume that the answering system is EMSI capable.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI Client
         **EMSI_CLI<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI Client is used by terminal emulation software to force a
         mailer front-end to bypass any unnecessary mail session
         negotiation and treat the call as an incoming human caller. The
         EMSI_CLI sequence may not be issued by any software attempting to
         establish a mail session between two systems and must only be
         acted upon by an answering system.

     =====================================================================

         EMSI Heartbeat
         **EMSI_HBT<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI Heartbeat is used to prevent unnecessary timeouts from
         occurring while attempting to handshake. It is most commonly used
         when the answering system turns around to transmit its EMSI_DAT
         packet. It is quite normal that any of the timers of the calling
         system (which at this stage is waiting for an EMSI_DAT packet)
         expires while the answering system is processing the recently
         received EMSI_DAT packet.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI Data
         **EMSI_DAT<len16><data_pkt><crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI Data is transmitted by both the calling and answering system
         at the appropriate time to exchange system information. Following
         the header is a four byte number representing the length of
         <data_pkt> excluding the CRC and terminating <CR>.

         The EMSI_DAT packet is a variable length packet. Since this is a
         synchronous protocol, the inbound data buffer should be purged
         between transmission of the <data_pkt> and <crc16> fields to
         prevent accidental EMSI_NAK sequences, etc.

         EMSI ACK
         **EMSI_ACK<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI ACK is transmitted by either system as a positive
         acknowledgement of the valid receipt of a EMSI_DAT packet. This
         should only be used as a response to EMSI_DAT and not any other
         packet.  Redundant EMSI_ACK sequences should be ignored.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI NAK
         **EMSI_NAK<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI NAK is transmitted by either system as a negative
         acknowledgement of the valid receipt of a EMSI_DAT packet. This
         should only be used as a response to EMSI_DAT and not any other
         packet. Redundant EMSI_NAK packets should be ignored.

         The EMSI_DAT packet
         ==================================================================
         The EMSI_DAT packet is the core of an EMSI negotiated session. It
         contains information vital to the mail session. The following
         pseudo structure shows the layout of the EMSI_DAT packet.

         end;

         The EMSI_addon structure is defined as follows:

         The constant "EMSI". There is no need for a revision level since
         this basic format cannot change and remain backward compatible.

     =====================================================================
         System address list
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The system address list is a list of system-specific identifiers
         for the E-Mail system separated by spaces.

         For FidoNet-technology based networks, it is required that
         Zone:Net/Node be presented, and .Point be omitted if zero. Zone
         and Net must not be zero.

         In other networks, an address such as "jhom@csource.oz.au" should
         be considered valid.

     =====================================================================
         Password
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         For systems using a session level password, it would be passed in
         this field. Note that the same password is used for all presented
         addresses and that it must be treated case insensitive.

         Link codes is a string of flags that specify desired connect
         conditions. These codes are separated by commas. New codes may be
         added with prior approval from the author of this document.

         Calling system/answering system options:

             8N1,
             7E1,
             7O2,
             etc.       Communication parameters.

         Calling system options:

             PUA        Pickup mail for all presented addresses.
             PUP        Pickup mail for primary address only.
             NPU        No mail pickup desired.


         Answering system options:

             HAT        Hold ALL traffic.
             HXT        Hold compressed mail traffic.
             HRQ        Hold file requests (not processed at this time).


     =====================================================================
         Compatibility codes
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Compatibility codes is a string of flags that specifies the
         capabilities and enabled features of the mailer. These codes are
         separated by commas. New codes may be added with prior approval
         from the author of this document.

         The calling system must list supported protocols first and
         descending order of preference (the most desirable protocol should
         be listed first). The answering system should only present one
         protocol and it should be the first item in the
         compatibility_codes field.

             Protocols
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             DZA*    DirectZAP (Zmodem variant).
             ZAP     ZedZap (Zmodem variant).
             ZMO**   Zmodem w/1,024 byte data packets.
             JAN     Janus.
             KER     Kermit.

             Other codes
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             NCP     No compatible protocols (failure).
             NRQ     No file requests accepted by this system.
             ARC     ARCmail 0.60-capable, as defined by the FTSC.
             XMA     Supports other forms of compressed mail.
             FNC     Filename conversion. This indicates that any
                     transmitted files must follow the MS-DOS restrictions
                     of an eight character file name followed by a three
     FIDONEWS 14-14               Page 18                   7 Apr 1997


                     character extension; eg. FILENAME.EXT

         (*) DirectZAP is a variant of ZedZap. The difference is that the
         transmitter only escapes CAN (18H). It is not recommended to use
         the DirectZAP protocol when two systems are connected via a packet
         switching network, or via another layer sensitive to control
         characters such as XON and XOFF.

         (**) The minimum protocol requirement for an EMSI implementation
         is to support plain Zmodem (16- or 32-bit CRC, 1,024 byte packets)
         which is represented by the ZMO flag in EMSI.

     =====================================================================
         Mailer product code
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The hexadecimal representation of the EMSC product code assigned
         to the mailer. Currently, the EMSC codes are the same as the FTSC
         assigned codes.

     =====================================================================
         Mailer name
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Specifies the name of the E-Mail system sending the EMSI packet.

     =====================================================================
         Mailer version
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The version number of the mailer software, ie. "1.10", "2.00".

     =====================================================================
         Mailer serial number
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The serial number, distribution source, version information, etc.
         This field is usually displayed like:

             Name<sp>Version/Serial_number

         eg.

             AirMail 0.10/Beta-2

     =====================================================================
         Extra fields
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The extra fields make the EMSI handshake protocol extremely
         flexible.  Any program or mailer may add fields to the end of the
         pre-defined structure so that program-specific data may be passed
         without the concern of interferring with other systems.

         There may be any number of extra fields added to the end of this
         structure. Each EXTRA_FIELD contains two ASCII1 strings:

         PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER      A unique "tag" that defines a specific
                                 program (such as a mailer or a utility).

         SPECIFIC_DATA           ASCII text that is specific data to the
     FIDONEWS 14-14               Page 19                   7 Apr 1997


                                 program defined in PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER.
                                 With this structure, any program can add
                                 its own data to the EMSI packet without
                                 affecting other applications.

         It is recommended that you contact the author of this document
         should you have any EXTRA_FIELDS that you may think worthwhile for
         other developers to implement and support.

         Predefined extra fields
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The following extra fields have been defined to date.

         PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER   :  IDENT

         Purpose              :  General identification of system that
                                 includes all information to generate a St.

                                 flags:            ASCII2;


             SYSTEM_NAME         The name of the system given by the user.
                                 This would normally be a company name, BBS
                                 name or other identifying text.

             CITY                The geographical location of the system.

             OPERATOR_NAME       The name of the person primarily
                                 responsible for the system.

             PHONE_NUMBER        The telephone number of the system, or
                                 "-Unpublished-" if the telephone number is
                                 unpublished. This MUST be in the standard
                                 format COUNTRY-CITY-NUMBER. Leading zeros
                                 should be stripped from the city code,
                                 ie. Stockholm (Sweden) has a city code of
                                 08, included in an EMSI packet, it would
                                 read 46-8-<number>.

             BAUD_RATE           The maximum baud rate supported by the
                                 system. This is NOT necessarily the same
                                 as the highest DTE rate.

             FLAGS               The St. Louis (FTSC) nodelist flags
                                 associated with the system.

         Two specific labels are used when discussing the IEMSI
         definitions.  The Client, which in this case is the Terminal
         software, and the Server, which in this case is the interactive
         on-line software, such as a BBS package or database system. It is
         assumed that the Client and the Server have established a data
         link and that no data has been transmitted by the Server.

         STEP 1, IEMSI INIT

         There is no specific sequence of events in the IEMSI definition.
         The Client must monitor incoming data and if the EMSI_IRQ sequence
         is detected, it attempts to negotiate an IEMSI session with the
         Server.  Under no circumstances is the Client allowed to transmit
         an EMSI_ICI packet prior to receiving the EMSI_IRQ sequence from
         the Server.  All IEMSI sequences and EMSI sequences used during an
         IEMSI session are terminated by a single <CR>. There are no
         exceptions to this.

         The Server must monitor its incoming data channel for 'normal'
         data, ie. data not transmitted as IEMSI sequences, to detect if
         the user is attempting to log-in without the use of IEMSI. The
         only basic restriction this imposes on the Server is that user
         names and/or IDs may not start with the character '*' since all
         EMSI/IEMSI sequences start with this character.

         All processing of the information in the EMSI_ICI packet must be

         If either of the ICI or ISI packets are NAK'd three consecutive
         times, the session negotiation attempt is terminated and the
         Client proceeds as it would have done should the Server not have
         supported IEMSI.

         IEMSI packet and sequence definitions
         ==================================================================

     =====================================================================
         EMSI ACK
         **EMSI_ACK<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI ACK is transmitted by either Client or Server as a positive
         acknowledgement of the valid receipt of an IEMSI packet such as
         EMSI_ISI and EMSI_ICI. During an IEMSI session, this sequence can,
         however, be used as a positive acknowledgement for other IEMSI
         packets. Redundant EMSI_ACK sequences should be ignored.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI NAK
         **EMSI_NAK<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         EMSI NAK is transmitted by either Client or Server as a negative
         acknowledgement of the valid receipt of an IEMSI packet such as
         EMSI_ISI and EMSI_ICI. During an IEMSI session, this sequence can,
         however, be used as a negative acknowledgement for other IEMSI
         packets. Redundant EMSI_NAK sequences should be ignored.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI IRQ
         **EMSI_IRQ<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Similar to EMSI_REQ which is used by mailer software to negotiate
         a mail session. IRQ identifies the Server as being capable of
         negotiating an IEMSI session. When the Client detects an IRQ
         sequence in its inbound data stream, it attempts to negotiate an
         IEMSI session.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI IIR
         **EMSI_IIR<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The IIR (Interactive Interrupt Request) sequence is used by either
         Client or Server to abort the current negotiation. This could be
         during the initial IEMSI handshake or during other interactions
         between the Client and the Server.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI ICI
         **EMSI_ICI<len><data><crc32><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The ICI packet is used by the Client to transmit its configuration
         and Server-related information to the Server. It contains Server
         parameters, Client options, and Client capabilities.

     =====================================================================
     FIDONEWS 14-14               Page 24                   7 Apr 1997


         EMSI ISI
         **EMSI_ISI<len><data><crc32><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The ISI packet is used by the Server to transmit its configuration
         and Client-related information to the Client. It contains Server
         data and capabilities.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI ISM
         **EMSI_ISM<len><data><crc32><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The ISM packet is used to transfer ASCII images from the Server to
         the Client. These images can then be recalled by the Client when
         the Server needs to display a previously displayed image. This
         will be further described in future revisions of this document.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI CHT
         **EMSI_CHT<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The CHT sequence is used by the Server to instruct the Client
         software to enter its full-screen conversation mode function
         (CHAT).  Whether or not the Client software supports this is
         indicated in the ICI packet.

         If the Server transmits this sequence to the Client, it must wait
         for an EMSI_ACK prior to engaging its conversation mode. If no
         EMSI_ACK sequence is received with ten seconds, it is safe to
         assume that the Client does not support EMSI_CHT. If, however, an
         EMSI_NAK sequence is received from the Client, the Server must re-
         transmit the EMSI_CHT sequence. Once the on-line conversation
         function has been sucessfully activated, the Server must not echo
         any received characters back to the Client.

     =====================================================================
         EMSI TCH
         **EMSI_TCH<crc16><CR>
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The TCH sequence is used by the Server to instruct the Client
         software to terminate its full-screen conversation mode function
         (CHAT).

         If the Server transmits this sequence to the Client, it must wait
         for an EMSI_ACK prior to leaving its conversation mode. If no
         EMSI_ACK sequence is received with ten seconds, a second EMSI_TCH
         sequence should be issued before the Server resumes operation. If,
         however, an EMSI_NAK sequence is received from the Client, the
         Server must re-transmit the EMSI_TCH sequence.

         The EMSI_ICI packet
         ==================================================================
         The following pseudo structure shows the layout of the EMSI_ICI
         packet. Note that the information in the EMSI_ICI packet may not
         exceed 2,048 bytes.

         Name and Alias (or Handle)
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The name and possible alias (AKA) of the user (Client). This must
         be treated case insensitively by the Server.

     =====================================================================
         Location
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The geographical location of the user, ie. Stockholm, Sweden.

     =====================================================================
         data# and voice#
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Unformatted data and voice telephone numbers of the user.
         Unformatted is defined as the full telephone number, including
         country and local area code. Eg. 46-8-90510 is a telephone number
         in Stockholm, Sweden.

     =====================================================================
         Password
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The password for the user. This must be treated case insensitively
         by the Server.

     =====================================================================
         Birthdate
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Hexadecimal string representing a long integer containing the
         birthdate of the user in UNIX notation (number of seconds since
         midnight, Jan 1 1970). This must be treated case insensitively by
         the Server.

     =====================================================================
         CrtDef
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Consisting of four sub-fields separated by commas, this field
         contains from left to right: The requested terminal emulation
     FIDONEWS 14-14               Page 26                   7 Apr 1997


         protocol, the number of rows of the user's CRT, the number of
         columns of the user's CRT, and the number of ASCII NUL (00H)
         characters the user's software requires to be transmitted between
         each line of text.

         The following terminal emulation protocols are defined:

             AVT0    AVATAR/0+. Used in conjunction with ANSI. If AVT0 is
                     specified by the Client, support for ANSI X3.64
                     emulation should be assumed to be present.
             ANSI    ANSI X3.64
             VT52    DEC VT52
             VT100   DEC VT100
             TTY     No terminal emulation, also referred to as RAW mode.

     =====================================================================
         Protocols
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The file transfer protocol option specifies the preferred method
         of transferring files between the Client and the Server in either
         direction. The Client presents all transfer protocols it is
         capable of supporting and the Server chooses the most appropriate
         protocol.

             DZA*    DirectZAP (Zmodem variant)
             ZAP     ZedZap (Zmodem variant)
             ZMO     Zmodem w/1,024 byte data packets
             SLK     SEAlink
             KER     Kermit

         (*) DirectZAP is a variant of ZedZap. The difference is that the
         transmitter only escapes CAN (18H). It is not recommended to use
         the DirectZAP protocol when the Client and the Server are
         connected via a packet switching network, or via another layer
         sensitive to control characters such as XON and XOFF.

     =====================================================================
         Capabilities
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The capabilities of the user's software. If more than one
         capability is listed, each capability is separated by a comma.

         The following capability codes are defined:

             CHT     Can do full-screen on-line conversation (CHAT).
             MNU     Can do ASCII image download (see ISM packet).
             TAB     Can handle TAB (ASCII 09H) characters.
             ASCII8  Can handle 8-bit IBM PC ASCII characters.

     =====================================================================
         Requests
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         The requests field specifies what the user wishes to do once the
         initial IEMSI negotiation has been successfully completed. If more
         than one capability is listed, each capability is separated by a
         comma.
     FIDONEWS 14-14               Page 27                   7 Apr 1997


         The following request codes are defined:

             NEWS    Show bulletins, announcements, etc.
             MAIL    Check for new mail.
             FILE    Check for new files.
             HOT     Hot-Keys.
             CLR     Screen clearing.
             HUSH    Do not disturb.
             MORE    Page pausing, often referred to as "More".
             FSED*   Full-screen editor.
             XPRS    <reserved>.

         (*) Note that this allows the Client to request use of a full-
         screen editor without requiring that it also supports a full-
         screen terminal emulation protocol.

         XlatTabl
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Used for character translation between the Server and the Client.
         This field has not been completely defined yet and should always
         be transmitted as {} (empty).

         The EMSI_ISI packet
         ==================================================================
         The following pseudo structure shows the layout of the EMSI_ISI
         packet. Note that the information in the EMSI_ISI packet may not
         exceed 2,048 bytes.

     =====================================================================
         Localtime
         ------------------------------------------------------------------
         Hexadecimal string representing a long integer containing the
         current time of the Server in UNIX notation (number of seconds
         since midnight, Jan 1 1970). This must be treated case
         insensitively by the Client.

                               WE GET EMAIL
     =================================================================


     Hi,
             We have a problem at Region 35 and I hope you'll be so kind to
     mention something about it, and whether anyone can help.

             The problem is that we lost the connection to the
     international echo areas due to some problems facing the one who was
     taking the responsibility of routing these echomail areas. Now we have
     a node routing netmail and 1 of the echos, but we still have a problem
     with all other ones. Kiril Yugoslavov (2:356/200) is ready to get
     these echos by FTP, but we're searching for FTP-echo feeds.

             We'll be grateful if you can help (either directly or by
     posting the above in the coming issues of FIDONEWS). You can send
     information, either to me at zombie@inet.bg or directly to Kiril
     Yugoslavov at 2:350/200 (I don't know his e-mail, but I will ask if
     needed).

     Thanks for your attention and time.

     Best wishes
        Moh

     Note: At the end of April, I'll be phasing out the old Macintosh
     section. As always, I'll be happy to process any information I get,
     either before or after it is phased out.
