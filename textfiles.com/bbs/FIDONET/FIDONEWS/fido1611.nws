     Greetings,

     Will those readers who submit articles, please note, that when
     submitting such articles please ensure you send them in standard
     ASCII format.  No HTML, thank you.
     My Internet address system, is a plain Linux system. ;-)

     Will some kind sole, please send something for the readers out
     there in explaining what has been happening with the breakup of the
     Z1 backbone?  But please, do apply KISS.  Thanks. <g>

     I've had a few questions about it, but not residing in Z1, I cannot
     clearly provide the correct or any answer.  Thanks again. <g>

     Does it not makes you cry, reading all those sad stories about how
     good FidoNet was and why they, the authors, are leaving?  ;-)
     Hey, we know it's good, it always was good and always will be good,
     provided, we get rid of P4.  Common, do we really need P4?  Take
     some of those characters, they not sure how to read, nevermind P4. ;-)

     Happy reading,

     Nodus Operandi - an application of Cole's Law

                                Nodus Operandi
                         An Application of Cole's Law
                  Douglas Myers, 1:279/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     Regular readers of the Zone 1 echoes realize that Fidonet is
     governed by two great documents:  the organizational writings of
     Policy 4 and the thinly sliced cabbage of Cole's Law.  Tom Cole, the
     author of the latter living document, revealed yet another subtlety
     of interpersonal communication last week in a new section of his
     policy entitled Nodus Operandi.

     Nodus Operandi basically allows for multiple personality
     identification based on node number.  This is not a new treatment
     for schizophrenia, but rather a method of distinguishing between a
     person as the sysop or as the coordinator.  Simply put,
     coordinators must post from their /0 node number when they wish to
     speak as coordinator, or from their "real" node number when posting
     as a sysop.

     This bit of administrative legerdemain was in response to the
     prospect of a Policy Complaint being filed against Tom.  Tom
     contends that the aggrieved party would have to file the complaint
     with Tom /0 rather than the RC because Tom's posts were made using
     his "real" node number.  Many have complained about the prospect of
     Tom the NC sitting in judgement of Tom the sysop, but few recognize
     that Mr. Cole may just be onto something here.

     Why not have administrative node numbers for special purposes?  For
     example, when David Hallford is engaged in pizza acquisition, I (for
     one) would like to know.  Martin Blecke recently refused to divulge
     his personal opinion on how the Z1C should be selected on the basis
     that folks would interpret it as his official opinion (the official
     position presumably being based on his region's input).  If he would
     just post using his "real" node number, then there would be no
     ambiguity.

     I, personally, would be willing to switch the AKA matching software
     off in my mailer and BBS to gain the many benefits of posting from
     special node numbers.  I could maintain one node number when I'm
     posting as an Ace Fidonews Reporter and another when I'm posting in
     the chat echoes as a Lounge Lizard.  That way, when I strike out, it
     wouldn't impugn on the good name of Fidonews... and when I post a
     dry, uninteresting Fidonews article, I could flirt in the SUPERBITCH
     echo.

     One should not be afraid to examine the runes in the cabbage leaves
     for a good idea.  After all, ancient cultures examined entrails for
     enlightenment.

                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================


     I have been in associated with Fidonet since 1990.  While that may not
     be as long as some, but it's longer than others.  When I first joined
     Fidonet I was amazed at the vast amount of information being spread
     around.  There was an echo for just about anyone.  I was sold.  I
     learned much of what I know in several areas today due to Fidonet and
     the geat poeple associated with it.  Their names are too many to list.
     Infact I owe much of my currently career in the Infomation Technology
     industry to Fidonet.

     We are in new times.  Many don't even know what a BBS or Fidonet is
     anymore.  We are not main stream.  However, the amount of information
     being disseminated is still amzing.  I recently devloped a intrest in
     getting my kids involved in precision shooting and learning how to
     hand load ammunition.  I post messages in a couple relevant echoes.
     Because of these posts and the subsequent replies my kids and I were
     able to attend a local course on high power shooting.  They really
     liked it.  We met some really great people, most of whom are not
     associated with Fidonet, over the course of the past two weekends.
     I have received a vast amount of help and information in regards to
     hand loading.  It has enabled to to learn from the mistakes of others
     and avoid making the same mistakes myself.

     The only complaint I have ever had with Fidonet is the well earned
     stigma of it really being "Fight-O-Net".  I really wish the powers
     that be within the Fidonet infastructure would learn to live in
     harmony.  I know that years ago in my own net we were stuck in the
     muck of "back room politics" and ego's clashing.  We worked to get
     out of this and we did.  We lost some nodes.  But we are a much better
     group now.

     In my opinon we have people here that need to try and make Fidonet not
     so complicated and work together to keep this great communications
     medium alive and healthy.  As with everything else we need to evolve
     or die out.  I honestly feel that if Fidonet's people do not get their
     acts together we might fade away into the dark of night.  We need to
     get back to the basics.  This is a amateur mail/message network.  Do
     we really need all of these extra groups and commitees that are still
     point fingers, making accusations, and squabbling over basically the
     same things they have been for years?

     If Fidonet continues to thrive it's to our benefit an credit.  If
     Fidonet dies out it's all our fault too.  What do we want?

     NAB & Z1B Echo Diff
     by Lisa Gronke, 1:105/9
     lisa@psg.com

     The old NAB (North American Backbone) split into two parts at
     the end of February, 1999. The divorce created two distribution
     systems, the (new) NAB with about 58% of the topology, and the
     Z1B (Z1_Backbone) with about 42% of the topology.

     The (new) NAB echo list is backbone.na. ELISTed echos will be
     added to backbone.na by the NAB at the moderator's request (no
     REC requests needed). Echos are removed from backbone.na at the
     moderator's request. Echo removal by the NAB for other reasons
     (low traffic or expired ELIST entry) is not currently implemented,
     but is being discussed.

     The Z1B list of echos is called backbone.z1b. Echo addition and
     deletion procedures are similar to those used by the NAB in the
     past, and are described in the document SLA9903.Z1B. Briefly, the
     moderator of a wannabe echo needs to request addition to the Z1B
     and two Hubs or RECs need to request that the echo be added. Echos
     are removed from backbone.z1b at the moderators request. Echos may
     also be removed from backbone.z1b by the Z1B because of low traffic
     or no current ELIST entry.

     Over the past few years I have come accustomed to reading the snooze
     each week as it finds itself into my mailbox. It seems that a gloom
     and doom article are appearing in the snooze at least monthly.

     Usually it is a departing node or a former node trying to get in a
     parting shot, telling the rest of us how bad it is.

     Well, I have some news... It's not that bad!

     Fidonet is going through changes, just as every other aspect of
     Information Technology.
     Why would we be any different? Why would we expect not to have to
     change along with the currents of technology? We cannot expect to hold
     onto the past without embracing the future. A future that has
     unlimited opportunities if we approach it with the same sense of
     camaraderie and pioneering that this network was founded on in the
     first place - a future that seeks out new frontiers.

     The new frontier these days is Fido/IP integration, making Fidonet
     systems available on the Internet. It's the only way to let new
     generations of computer users experience what we already know. It is
     also a way of reaching those that have "migrated".

     Meet the Fido/IP project:

     The Fido/IP project is based on the premise that Fidonet has to
     embrace new technologies and philosophies while continuing to support
     its traditional membership. The goal is to create a coherent network
     that contains both POTS and IP nodes alike.

     The notion to use the Internet as a transport medium is not new.
     George Peace was the pioneer in utilizing FTP as a means to
     inexpensively and quickly move mail and files over great distances.
     Then came VModem and the idea to use Telnet as a "carrier" for
     standard protocols to connect via the Internet. Now we have BinkP -
     a protocol designed to work directly over the Internet, socket to
     socket. As a matter of fact, BinkP is the first protocol that was
     designed as a Fido/IP protocol, and it is the first protocol to then
     be adapted to a Fido POTS protocol in its Niagara incarnation.

     To make a long story short: Today there is a growing number of
     Fido/IP systems. Zone 1 and Zone 2 have implemented the I-suite of
     flags proposed by Lothar Behet. Zone 3 is reportedly close to doing
     the same. More and more mailer programs and bbs systems are natively
     IP-capable.

     Fidonet's structures and ways of interacting are changing as a result
     of it. New nodes are joining Fidonet and former nodes are coming back.
     It's a slow process, but it is a growing trend. We will see more of it
     as time goes on.

     If you want to embrace this new era, check out the following programs:

     North American Backbone Echo Changes [Jan-Feb]
     by Lisa Gronke, 1:105/9

     Summary of NAB echo changes during Jan & Feb.

     Brought to you courtesy of (unix) diff.

     The old NAB (North American Backbone) split into two parts at
     the end of February, 1999. The divorce created two distribution
     systems, the (new) NAB with about 58% of the topology, and the
     FIDONEWS 16-11               Page 8                   15 Mar 1999


     Z1B (Z1_Backbone) with about 42% of the topology.

     The (new) NAB adds echos at the moderator's request. The wannabe
     echo must have an ELIST entry, but there are no other requirements.
     Echos are removed from the NAB at the moderator's request. The NAB
     is still discussing how they will handle echos with an expired ELIST
     entry.

     After reading Rob Echlers Fidonet obituary (Volume 14, #10), I have
     decided to pen my own.
     I bought my first 300 baud modem in 1981 and started my first BBS a
     few years later, joining Fidonet in 1984. Many thousands of hours of
     my life was spent in echomail and netmail, and most of my lifelong
     friends were met through Fidonet or BBSing. I have no regrets about
     this time spent in my youth, as I learnt much about sociology and
     human relationships from this time.
     Now I'm a I.T. consultant and Project Manager, and owe much of my
     success to my experience in Fidonet.
     In fact, I suspect that many people now in their 30s who got into
     Fidonet in their teens have had much success in their lives due to the
     unique experiences that Fidonet offered. What better way to learn how
     to manage people than to become a echomail moderator, or to gain
     technical proess by running Multiple BBS and mail sessions
     FIDONEWS 16-11               Page 9                   15 Mar 1999


     concurrently under desqview!
     A few weeks ago, I found an old 80MB Hard Drive lying around and
     plugged it in to discover my BBS, Front Door, Fmail and echo areas
     that I thought had been long lost. I had a great laugh reading all the
     OS/2 will destroy Windows flames, (where are all the OS/2 bigots
     now?), and wondered if there was anything resembling a shell of
     Fidonet left. In a sudden burst of nostalgia, I tried to get
     everything running again and maybe even join Fidonet again to see out
     its last, but alas I was too late. I compiled my ancient nodelist (it
     makes you realise how fast computer have become when it took 10
     seconds instead of 2-3 minutes!) and tried to File Request an up to
     date nodelist, but not one system was left to poll from, and I
     couldn't even find a single BBS to connect to. In the end I gave up,
     so this message will have to do as my goodbye.
     It is a very slow and painful death that Fidonet is going through, and
     I believe it would be a great idea to go out on a high note and pull
     the plug formally at the end of this year - to mark Fidonet as a 20th
     Icon as a precursor to the Internet. However, the reality is that the
     threads of cohesion are too weak now for any cohesive decisions to be
     reached at any level within Fidonet.
     So for a time the ghosts will continue to haunt what once was Fidonet.
     These are the outsiders, most of them running linux or OS/2, but never
     Windows with outlook for e-mail and newsreader. People who once
     dreamed and begged to become a "hub", can now become their own NCs and
     even ZCs if they wish!
     One request - Please keep any old echomail (esp Sysop areas) archives
     that you have stored. I know that one day soon, Fidonet will be
     preserved and remembered in much the same way as my TRS-80 model 1,
     with a virtual emulator. On the Internet you will be able to connect
     to a virtual BBS and browse through the past with records of echomail,
     doors and games from a bygone era. I can imagine a Java nodelist
     compiler emulator, and emulated copies of everything from Opus to
     Frontdoor, allowing you to install a virtual BBS on the Net and even
     emulate the connections to other virtual systems to enable Netmail to
     flow again, but this time, just for the sake of fun and remembering
     the good old days. I look forward to this new project kicking off, and
     hope that there are many ex Sysops out there with an archive of their
     systems that can contribute to the virtual Fidonet archives.
     So on this positive note, I bid goodbye and farwell.

     Z1 Backbone Echo Changes
     by Lisa Gronke, 1:105/9
     lisa@psg.com

     Summary of Z1B echo changes during Jan & Feb.

     Brought to you courtesy of (unix) diff.

     The old NAB (North American Backbone) split into two parts at
     the end of February, 1999. The divorce created two distribution
     systems, the (new) NAB with about 58% of the topology, and the
     FIDONEWS 16-11               Page 10                  15 Mar 1999


     Z1B (Z1_Backbone) with about 42% of the topology.

     The Z1B "grandfathered" existing NAB echos as of 28-Feb-99, but
     sent mail to all moderators advising them that they could remove
     their echos from the Z1B. Unlike the (new) NAB, the Z1B requires
     two Hub or REC requests before a new Z1B wannabe echo will be added
     to the list of Z1B echos (backbone.z1b). Also unlike the (new) NAB,
     the Z1B is expected to purge echos that do not meet minimum traffic
     requirements or whose ELIST entry expires. For these reasons, the
     Z1B list (backbone.z1b) is expected to diverge from the NAB list
     (backbone.na) over time, and may be temporarily out-of-sync for a
     week or two on new echos that are requesting addition to both
     backbones.

     What I have done here is a "two month diff" between the last NAB
     list that I reported and the current Z1B list. This means that
     most of the echos in the "Added to the Z1B list of echos" were
     actually added to the NAB before the divorce.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:228/158

     Well, it has been quite a while. Been wondering if I should come
     back. Guess I just did. <grin>

     Everything is out of date. I've got a backlog, but while I catch
     up on old mail, I also want to get new mail as well. So write me.

     There's been some speculation about web page listings and e-mail
     addresses for this list. I do plan to add them to the web version
     of this list within the next couple of weeks. Please send them in.
