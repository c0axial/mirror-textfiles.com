                              Curious Products

        A friend of mine called me up the other day.  He was quite 
        irate about an ad he had just read, and he wanted to vent 
        his feelings.  

        It seems a company has come out with a "black book" program, 
        for organizing telephone numbers and addresses.  You enter 
        in all your data, and it will pull out selected names and 
        print them on standard printer paper.  Cut along the lines, 
        fold, and viola!  A little black book.  

        A cute idea.  Neat, handy, convenient.  In fact, so handy 
        that I have one in my wallet right now.  

        You see, what made him irate is that he and I have had our 
        own programs to do exactly that for about eight years now.  
        My earliest version was written in BASIC on a Honeywell 
        mainframe running DTSS operating system.  His originally ran 
        on a SWTPC micro in his bedroom and printed using his 
        Decwriter terminal.  I'm not sure about the exact history of 
        his version, but mine has been adapted to run on a New 
        England Digital minicomputer (in XPL), and finally on an

        IBM-PC (in C).  

        He heats up on this topic fairly regularly, and for good 
        reason, I guess.  I remember a few years back we had 
        brainstormed an idea we thought rather highly of.  We'd been 
        in the group that got real-time conferences going on the 
        Dartmouth College mainframe, and it took off like a house 
        afire.  When the college computer was linked into Telenet, 
        we hit on the idea of renting mainframe time and selling it 
        to people accross the country so they could join the 
        conferences.  We finally scrapped the whole idea because we 
        figured that nobody in their right mind would pay the six 
        bucks an hour it would cost us for Telenet charges and 
        mainframe time, much less enough extra to give us a profit.  
        After all, we only did it because we got the time for free.  
        It was only a year or two later that Compuserve went into 
        business.  How could we have known that so many people are 
        not in their right minds?  

        I guess the moral (if there is any) is that it's not enough 
        to have a good idea, you also have to market it.  I tend to 
        look down a bit on salesmen -- probably as a result of 
        having worked for a company that was run by a soi disant 
        "super salesman" -- but give the devil his due.  My father 
        always used to say, "If you want something done right, hire 
        an expert."  Nobody can be good at everything, and I don't 
        kid myself that I'm good at marketing.

        The problem, of course, is to find a marketeer that will 
        handle your product.  Most people don't want to talk to you 
        until you've proven yourself.  You do this by bringing out a 
        successful product.  This is known as a classic "Chicken and 
        egg dilemma".

        Someone once suggested to me that a possible answer might be 
        to form some sort of marketing co-op.  I confess that I have 
        no idea how such a thing would work, or even how to go about 
        setting one up.  My own pet idea is to convince some large 
        company -- probably a publishing house -- to try publishing 
        software the same way they now publish books.  Basically, 
        you would send your program off to a publisher, who then 
        takes a look at it.  Possibly you get some editorial 
        feedback, and change it a bit.  Then, if they like it, they 
        give you an advance against royalties and start publishing 
        it.  If the royalties ever exceed the advance, you start 
        getting income.

        The current situation is in flux.  Everybody seems to do it 
        differently, and it's not yet clear what will constitute 
        "normal channels" a few years from now.  The only trend I 
        can make out is towards the "big company" approach, which I 
        find personally distasteful.  It may be all well and good 
        for Lotus and Aston Tate, but it leaves no room for the 
        little guy.

                      ZAXXON: A TALE OF TROJAN FREEWARE
                            Tom Neff [76566,2536]
                      =================================

                               1. INTRODUCTION

        Most Sysops I know are careful to avoid carrying pirated 
        commercial software in their download data libraries, and 
        many post loud warnings about it to all concerned.  It's 
        usually obvious to the casual user when a program is not 
        intended for free distribution, because commercial programs 
        customarily display a copyright page on startup.  Even 
        "silent" programs (like some utilities) often carry embedded 
        copyright information in the program code itself, so that an 
        inquisitive Sysop can identify the program's origin and 
        status by "dumping" it.  

        However, an unwelcome phenomenon has arisen recently: copies 
        of commercial programs are "hacked" to remove all copyright 
        and/or authorship notices, then passed around as public 
        domain.  One example of this is the late, unlamented PSHIFT, 
        which was apparently a pre-production beta version of 
        Northeastern Systems' MEMORY SHIFT package -- the legend as 
        passed down to me is that a disgruntled ex-employee took a 
        copy with him, patched it to read "Public Domain" and handed 
        it out.  Others seem to include the games STARGATE and 
        ZAXXON.  I want to show you what I am talking about, using 
        ZAXXON as an example.  

                           2. ZAXXON IS AN EXAMPLE

        Now ZAXXON is the arcade game where you have a little 
        warplane that you fly over a brick wall and thru a gauntlet 
        of missiles, blimps, guns, lasers, and what have you.  The 
        full-scale coin-op version is owned and copyrighted by Sega, 
        a big video games company.  The IBM PC version is a 20K file 
        called ZAXXON.COM, which surfaced a year or more ago.  When 
        you fire it up, it clears the screen and displays the 
        legend: 

                                 Z A X X O N

                           Public Domain by: Sega

        I have Chatted or exchanged messages with several Sysops who 
        tell me that no matter what others may say, I must be 
        mistaken when I warn them about ZAXXON, because it's clearly 
        marked Public Domain -- end of discussion!  There are three 
        good reasons why they're wrong: 

          *  Sega is not in the freeware business.  This ought to be 
             self evident.  It's like seeing an entire shipment of 
             Epson printers with "FREE SAMPLE" stickers on them, and 







FIDONEWS     --           16 Sep 85  00:02:12           Page 4

             believing it.  

          *  Ever seen a REAL freeware game?  There are enough of 
             them out there: FLIGHTMARE, QIX, BERTSNAK, CASTLE, 
             etcetera.  They do NOT simply say "Public Domain" once 
             on the title page.  Instead, they typically display the 
             author's name and address, together with distribution 
             policy, "hope you enjoy it," and sometimes a request 
             for a contribution.  Again, at the bare minimum, the 
             program code itself will contain embedded text with the 
             author's name.  Compared to this standard, ZAXXON is 
             like a .38 Special with the serial numbers filed off -- 
             real suspicious.  

          *  This file has been hacked, crudely and obviously.  A 
             commercial copyright message, for Sega or whomever, was 
             blanked out in at least two places, and innocuous 
             messages were substituted in their place.  

                 3. HACKER'S TOUR OF WHAT WAS DONE TO ZAXXON

        Let me bore you with a page of hex dump for a moment by way 
        of illustration.  This excerpt from ZAXXON.COM includes some 
        of the text of the games's user messages, including the 
        strings used on the title and GAME OVER pages:

        OK, now what have we got here?  Take a look at the 
        "Keyboard" and "Joystick" messages around 700-760 for a 
        whole slew of examples of how this program stores its 
        strings.

        As near as we can figure out, this structure is Color, Row, 
        Column, then ASCII text, 00 terminated.  Notice there are no 
        leading or trailing blanks; the cursor positioning embedded 
        in the message makes that unnecessary.  Go ahead and look at 
        some of the others; they all pretty much follow that format, 
        except for the "Player 1/2 Your Turn" messages at 7F0-800, 
        which are 00 terminated but have no leading color or cursor 
        information.  But let's look at our "Public Domain" string:

        Well, well, well, what have we here?!  Normal cursor 
        positioning, then BLANK BLANK BLANK Public Domain by: Sega 
        BLANK BLANK BLANK!  

                         4. LEGENDARY PERSONS REACT

                       MR. SPOCK (raising an eyebrow):
                                Fascinating.

                 HOLMES (laying down his violin and needle):
                        You see, Watson?  Elementary!

              MAN FROM BOLTON (shaking cage at Pet Shop owner):
                     This parrot is NAILED TO THE PERCH!

                         (End of dramatic interlude)

                        5. LAST LEG OF HACKER'S TOUR

        If you want to believe that there WASN'T a "Copyright 1984, 
        by Sega Inc." message (or something close to it) in those 28 
        bytes before someone centered a 22-byte "Public Domain" 
        string in the same place, leaving 6 excess blanks, then I 
        have got some great Florida swamp land I'd like to sell you!  
        There's what looks like more of the same thing on the end-
        of-game screen: 

                                      03 10 0E 20 20 20           ...
        20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 03 10 0F 20 47 41 4D         .... GAM
        45 20 4F 56 45 52 20 00 03 10 10 20 20 20 20 20 E OVER ....
        20 20 20 20 20 20 00                                  .

        Here we have a GAME OVER message with one blank on either 
        side, hmmmm; but my favorite is the next message: ALL 
        BLANKS.  Nice one!  Anyway, enough on this example.  I 
        wanted to give you an idea of what to look for --unexpected 
        stretches of blanks is a dead giveaway.  

                         6. CONCLUSIONS AND PEP TALK

        What can we learn from this?  As far as I am concerned, the 
        burden of proof of a program's PD status rests squarely on 







FIDONEWS     --           16 Sep 85  00:02:17           Page 6

        the author, the program itself, and the uploader.  Here are 
        some general recommendations: 

          *  If you write freeware, shareware, or PDware, authors, 
             proclaim it loud and clear in the program itself -- 
             don't rely on external documentation to explain how you 
             want your program distributed!  

          *  BBS users and Sysops, if you see any program, 
             especially a game, that is clearly of professional 
             quality, MAKE SURE that an author's name and address or 
             similar convincing pedigree is present in the program 
             itself.  DO NOT be fooled by a one-line "Public Domain" 
             message or a completely blank startup.  If a program is 
             meant to be shared, it will SAY SO explicitly.  

          *  Sysops, help keep your users informed of known 
             commercial ripoffs.  There is about one new one a month 
             at present.  If you have a big upload-download BBS, 
             post a Bulletin saying you won't accept non-PD uploads, 
             and list the current Dirty Dozen: STARGATE, AXX, 
             ZAXXON, PSHIFT, and so forth.  One convenient way to do 
             this (on RBBS-PC systems) is to create bogus entries in 
             your upload DIR99 as follows: 

                   ZAXXON   COM   DELETED     ONLY PD SOFTWARE PLEASE!
                   STARGATE COM   DELETED     ONLY PD SOFTWARE PLEASE!
                   PSHIFT   LBR   DELETED     ONLY PD SOFTWARE PLEASE!

          *  Users, don't be shy about notifying the local Sysop 
             when you spot a ripped-off file on his or her BBS.  
             News takes a while to get around, and most Sysops will 
             be only too relieved to get the warning, since they are 
             the ones at risk when they carry stolen software.  

        I don't have to tell you how important it is that we keep 
        our risks to a minimum right now, with the legal storms 
        brewing in Washington and the various States.  The only way 
        to keep our BBS freedoms alive is to cooperate in protecting 
        them, and that means staying on guard against the abuses of 
        the irresponsible minority whose abuses grab the headlines, 
        taunt the lawyers and police, and threaten to stampede the 
        legislators.  Let's keep our act together -- PD SOFTWARE 
        ONLY PLEASE!  TMN

        A CONTEST.........Fido #519 on Net #102

        Hello Everyone!  My name is Darlene Faccone and I'm one of 
        the new Fidos in Southern California.  I've been having 
        trouble thinking of a name for my node so..........I'M 
        HAVING A CONTEST!!  

        The temporary name I'm using is NAME_MY_NODE.  I will be 
        accepting name suggestions until 9/30/85 when a real name 
        will be chosen.  The author of the selected name will win a 
        SURPRISE so, please include a mailing address with your 
        suggestion.  

        My BBS doesn't have a single theme yet but I'm leaning 
        toward an informational type system where people can ask 
        questions relating to the IBM PC family and peripherals.  My 
        system is running on an IBM PC/AT with 512K RAM, 20mB disk 
        drive, color display and Hayes 1200B internal smartmodem.  

        I am a reformed mainframer with 19 years applications and 
        systems programming experience.  My skills are mostly 
        software related but I'm always extremely interested in 
        learning new things all the time.  

        I'll be upgrading memory soon to a megabyte so that I can 
        run Multi-link or some other comparable multitasking 
        software which will allow me to keep Fido on-line all the 
        time but still use the system for other things.  

        I'm VERY excited about being a part of Fido.  Everyone has 
        been extremely helpful and supportive.  

        DON'T FORGET TO SEND ME A NAME SUGGESTION!!!!  I'LL BE 
        WATCHING FOR SOME REALLY CLEVER WITTY NAMES.

                 GOOD NEWS! THE FIRST COMPUTER PRIVACY ACT!  


        >>>> Ported from The Meta Network via UNISON by Lisa Carlson

        Senator Leahy to propose Electronic Communications Privacy Act

        This  afternoon,   at  the  first  annual  meeting  of   the 
        Electronic  MAIL  Association,  Senator  Patrick  J.   Leahy 
        (Democrat-Vermont) announced his intention to introduce  the 
        Electronic  Communication  Privacy  Act  of  1985.  When the 
        Senate reconvenes, similar legislation will be introduced in 
        the House.  In his address,  Senator Leahy  focused  on  the 
        complex  public  policy problems which have emerged with the 
        increase of computer-based communications.  

        Policy is now needed to protect the privacy and security  of 
        communication  exchanged  via  new  technologies,   so  that 
        citizens may feel as secure using newer communications media 
        as they do in using the mail services or the  telephone.  At 
        present,  the  Federal  legislation  enacted  in 1968 on the 
        illegality of wire-tapping is the only act which might apply 
        to  privacy  of  communication  issues.   That   legislation 
        designed  to  protect voice communication via common carrier 
        is no longer adequate,  as protection is  extended  only  to 
        communication  "capable  of  being  heard." According to the 
        Senator,  current federal policy needs to protect  "WHAT  is 
        being transmitted, not the WAY it is transmitted." 

        The Senator, Vice-Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on 
        Policy,   is   committed   to   the  protection  of  private 
        communication from any source,  be it government itself or a 
        private, undetected perhaps, intruder in a database.  

        The  to-be-proposed  Electronic Communication Privacy Act of 
        1985 will make five  important  changes  to  the  "wire  tap 
        laws." As outlined, these changes will: 

        - extend coverage from "voice" to all electronic 
          transmission 

        - recognize private carriers, so that all communications 
          systems will be covered, not just common carriers as at 
          present.  

        - institute civil and criminal penalties for illegal access.  

        - institute civil penalties for disclosure of private 
          information stored on any system.  

        - for law enforcement, require that a court order be 
          obtained before accessing information stored on private 
          communications systems.

        Note on overseas FIDO operation.

        After reading the article on international FIDO net 
        operations,  I am reminded of an article in an ICCA 
        newsletter.  I do not remember all of the details but..  

        There is a lot of concern these days about export of 
        technology.  Some laws are quite clear,  such as: 

              NO EXPORT OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE WITHOUT A PERMIT!

        The article said that this included a Lotus 1-2-3 disk in 
        your breifcase on the plane.  I would assume that file 
        transfers overseas would also be included.  The permit would 
        be obtained from the US Dept of Commerce,  the details of 
        which I have no idea.  

        If anyone knows the whole story,  please let us know.

        This was excerpted from DIGITAL REVIEW, August 1985 issue.

                             OUT OF THE DOGHOUSE

                               by Vin McLellan

        FidoNet, a grass roots telecommunications network, has 
        finally come into its own.  

             Among PC users with all brands of  machines,  "FidoNet" 
        is  probably perceived as the Rainbow's biggest contribution 
        to the telecommunications subculture.  Ironically,  only  in 
        the  last  few  months,  as FidoNet caught the attention and 
        imagination  of  others,  have  DEC  and  Digital  Equipment 
        Computer Users Society (DECUS) begun to acknowledge and take 
        advantage  of this extraordinary creation,  a global network 
        of intercommunicating bulletin boards that is in large  part 
        the creation of the Rainbow user community.  

             FidoNet  evolved  in  1984,  duting a period when DEC's 
        interest in the Rainbow began to fade.  One can almost taste 
        this  "despite  them"  attitude  among the FidoNet volunteer 
        managers. The administrative node of FidoNet in St. Louis is 
        called DECUS CENTRAL,  and the key regional network managers 
        and about one third of the 250 PC-based nodes that feed into 
        the network are Rainbow installations, but FidoNet developed 
        with  an insurgent mentality.  What FidoNet got from DEC was 
        largely given by individuals:  Key engineers in the  Rainbow 
        group  made  available  design data that corporate spokesmen 
        had refused to reveal, DEC regional sales offices in four or 
        five cities gave Rainbows  to  their  DECUS  PC  local  user 
        groups  (LUGs)  so  they  could  put  up  Fido  boards,  and 
        individual  DEC  employees  called  up  to  offer  services, 
        software,  advice,  and  applause -- but cautioned that they 
        weren't to be mentioned.  

             Perhaps  it  is  only  fitting  now,  as  DEC  moves to 
        reinvigorate its microcomputer line,  do both DEC and  DECUS 
        seem  on  the verge of openly acknowledging the contribution 
        of FidoNet to the spirit of the DEC  community.  Last  year, 
        FidoNet couldn't get a slot on the DECUS conference calendar 
        in  Anaheim  -- despite the fact that half the DECUS PC LUGs 
        run Fidos;  FidoNet's spokesmen were tossed into a "birds of 
        a  feather"  session  that  was mobbed by an overflow crowd.  
        This year -- just as Fido version 10l was being  distributed 
        to   the   estimated  900-odd  Fido  bulletin  board  system 
        operators (SysOps) -- Fido had a scheduled symposium at  the 
        New  Orleans DECUS convention at which it was announced that 
        the new version of the free Fido  software  will  break  the 
        software  barrier  that  had previously put a ceiling of 250 
        nodes on mail-exchanging  FidoNets.  As  the  Fido  bulletin 
        boards  convert to version 10l over the summer,  hundreds of 
        new nodes will be added.  

             What is Fido?  Fido is, first of all,  a public domain, 
        micro-based  bulletin board system that runs on the Rainbow, 
        IBM PC and compatibles,  the Sanyo  555,  the  Victor  9000,

        Otrona  Attaches,  and Tandy 2000s.  Fido was written by Tom 
        Jennings of San Francisco,  a systems programmer for Phoenix 
        Software  in  Boston,  the  craftsman  hired by Microsoft to 
        rewrite  MS-DOS  for  the  Rainbow  (a  project   originally 
        undertaken  against  the  wishes of DEC).  Although its user 
        interface is somewhat  more  awkward  than  those  of  other 
        bulletin   boards,   the  Fido  bulletin  board's  ingenious 
        networking capability has  made  it  the  most  widely  used 
        bulletin board system in the country.  

             For  one  hour  every  night,  the Fido bulletin boards 
        automatically close down and switch into FidoNet mode:  Mail 
        that  has  been  submitted for transmission is packaged with 
        proper  headers  (according  to  FidoNet's  U.S.  region  or 
        overseas  district  and  the  receiving  bulletin board) and 
        transmitted via very brief long distance phone calls. Fido's 
        cost per message (which obviously drops precipitously as the 
        number  of  messages  packed  into  a  single   transmission 
        increases)  is largely dictated by AT&T's minimum one minute 
        charge.  Most of the 250 Fidos active  in  the  public  Fido 
        network  use  Fido's  internal accounting system to maintain 
        user credit files and bill  about  25  cents  for  a  cross-
        country  message  of some 45 lines.  Although the feature is 
        used primarily by sysops,  FidoNet also allows files  to  be 
        attached  to  a  message  --  for transmitting spreadsheets, 
        software or whatever.  

             This is enormous functionality from free software,  and 
        both  the  product and its price have found widespread favor 
        in both the hobbiest world and the corporate  universe.  DEC 
        employee  Dave Rene,  sysop of both Fido 27 in Gardner and a 
        restricted Fido (310) at DEC's Rainbow  graphics  dvelopment 
        group  in  Westminster,  Massachusetts,  says  that  Fido 27 
        distributes four complete Fido software packages *daily*.  

             "What they're all doing with them is beyond me," laughs 
        Fido 44 sysop Dave Mitton,  secretary  of  the  New  England 
        Computer  Society  and a project leader in DEC's NetWork and 
        Communications Group.  According to Ken Kaplan,  chairman of 
        the St. Louis DECUS PC group, perhaps half the 250 networked 
        nodes  are  based  in  commercial stores,  radio stations or 
        corporations.  He guesses there are roughly 600 to 700 nodes 
        in  private  company  networks.  Kaplan  is  one  of the key 
        figures behind Fido's spread among DECUS Rainbow LUGs;  he's 
        a VP of Digital Research Associates, an authorized dealer of 
        VAX  and  Rainbow  systems  for  libraries,  and  one of the 
        leading DECUS CENTRAL volunteer  admnistrators  that  manage 
        FidoNet.  "It  was a hobby that just went wild," he explains 
        sheepishly.  

             "As the head of U.S.  Robotics told me yesterday," says 
        Kaplan, "there ain't anybody out there who has anything that 
        can match it right now." For micro-based electronic mail, he 
        says  Fido is "obviously the standard bearer" -- but more to 
        the point,  he says,  FidoNet's cost-effectiveness  puts  to 
        shame much larger,  more expensive, better publicized E-mail 
        systems.

             Still,  free software has a price.  Jennings says  that 
        the  current  version  (10l)  will  be  his  last.  Although 
        Jennings has never made the source code public,  he says  he 
        is  actively  encouraging  others  to write Fido clones.  "I 
        can't be the only author of public domain electronic  mail," 
        protests the 29-year old programmer. "It's crazy! When there 
        are  250  or 300 nodes,  and I'm the only person maintaining 
        them...I  can't  continue  forever   and   ever!"   Jennings 
        describes  himself  as  a  "burn-out"  victim  -- but he and 
        others associated with FidoNet administration have also been 
        talking about foundation support that might  allow  them  to 
        continue  without  carrying  a  full workload in addition to 
        their career jobs.  Volunteerism has its limits;  the limits 
        are often a matter of time rather than energy or interest.

                 Interesting Things From the World of USENET

                                     by
                                 Bob Hartman
                             Sysop Fido 101/101
                              The UN*X Gateway
                                     and
                                Home of ROVER


                Since my board is the UN*X Gateway node for Fido, I 
        thought that I would share some of the wonderful things that 
        have been posted as USENET articles recently.  Anyone who 
        thinks that my USENET link is not terribly useful, may 
        change their minds after reading further.  All of these 
        little tidbits are taken directly as they were posted to 
        USENET.  I only reformatted the paragraphs to make them 
        conform to FIDONEWS standards.  Note that the first item 
        seems to exist *ONLY* in MS-DOS V3.x.  I tried it on my PC 
        with PC-DOS 3.0, and it did not work.

        Newsgroups: net.micro.pc
        Subject: /e switch in MS-DOS V3

        I don't recall if this has made the rounds on the net, but 
        MS-DOS V3.x has an undocumented switch to expand the default 
        size of the environment. The switch is in config.sys. The 
        syntax is: 

        SHELL = drive/pathname_of_command_processor
                drive/path_to_command_process /p
                /e:number_of_16_byte_paragraphs

        The drive/pathname of the command processor and the 
        drive/pathname to the command processor must be specified.  
        Also note that omitting the /p switch will cause DOS to 
        discard the command processor after startup and send your 
        machine for a trip west. Here is the line I use in my 
        config.sys file 

        SHELL = c:\command.com c:\ /p/e:30

        Obviously, command.com is located in the root directory of 
        my hard disk. This sets up a 480 byte space for the 
        environment.  

        The number of paragraphs should be 10 < paragraphs < 63. If 
        less than 11 is specified, it is bumped to 11. If more than 
        62 is specified, DOS prints a message and sets the 
        environment space to the default of 128 bytes.  

        As this feature is undocumented, the caveat about any 
        undocumented feature applies. It's here in DOS V3.0 & V3.1 
        (and not in previous versions). It may or may not be in

        show up in the next release. :-(

        any file is 4096 bytes), while drives 20mb and larger 
        utilize 2k clusters.  At work, I use a PC with twin 10mb 
        drives under DOS 3.1.  Since I have a multitude of small 
        files on these disks, the smaller allocation unit's space 
        saving advantage far outweighs any theoretical disadvantage 
        of additional overhead for DOS to handle the added 
        allocation units.  With the help of Bob Morse, Jim Gainsley, 
        and the DOS Technical Reference, I was able to make the 
        changes necessary to use 2k clusters on both of my 10mb 
        drives.  By following the step-by-step instructions below, 
        you will be able to make the switch to 2k clusters yourself.  
        The need for making a complete backup of all your files 
        prior to attempting this procedure cannot be overephasized.  
        You will need the following tools: 

        (1) IBM PC-DOS version 3.1 (3.0 will work, but because of 
        other bugs, 3.1 is strongly recommended).  

        (2) A disk utility such as Norton's NU.COM, or equivalent.  

        Most critical to the process is the sequence in which this 
        procedure is attempted.  Here is the 4k to 2k cluster 
        procedure: 

        (1)  Do a complete backup of the drive, using your current 
        version of DOS.  

        (2)  Cold boot DOS 3.1, and FDISK the drive to create a DOS 
        partition.  

        (3)  Format the drive using the DOS format program.  Don't 
        use any parameters (no /s or /v).  

        (4)  Using your Norton (or whatever), select the boot sector 
        and view it.  See below for an explanation of the pertinent 
        info in this sector.  You should see a value of 08 for 
        sectors per cluster.  change this to 04.  You should see a 
        value of 0800 for sectors per fat. Change this to 1500.  All

        changes to the fat sectors required for 2k clusters will be 
        accomplished by the subsequent format (6,below).  No other 
        manual changes are required.  A more detailed explanation of 
        these two changes: 

             The number of sectors per cluster would change from 08 
        to 04, since that's what this is all about.  The sectors per 
        FAT will change, in order to accomodate (1) the increased 
        number of possible FAT entries, and (2) the increased size 
        of each fat entry (new 16 vs.  old 12 bits each).  The value 
        to use for a 10 meg & 2k clusters would be 21 sectors, or 
        1500 in hex word format.  

        (5)  Exit Norton and do a cold boot.  This is critical, 
        since the boot sector is read by DOS only once, at boot 
        time, in order to build the BIOS  Parameter Block.  Having 
        different info in the boot sector than what's in the memory-
        resident BPB will cause exceedingly flaky things to happen, 
        as you can imagine.  

        (6)  Reformat the drive using the DOS program, using 
        whatever switches that you desire (/s or /v).  Format will 
        not affect your changes to the boot sector.  

        (7)  Restore your files, remembering to use the new restore 
        switch (/P) which prompts before restoring system files.  If 
        you restore an old version of COMMAND.COM, make sure to copy 
        a 3.x version over it afterwards. You should now be 
        operational again, with 2k clusters.  

        ====================

        Example of first few bytes in the Boot Sector displayed in 
        hex format, after formatting with DOS 3.1, and prior to 2k 
        cluster size changes: 

        EB299049 424D2020 332E3100 02080100 020002F3 50F80800
                                     ^^                  ^^^^
                                     AA                   BB

        After the 2k cluster size changes:

        EB299049 424D2020 332E3100 02040100 020002F3 50F81500
                                     ^^                  ^^^^
                                     AA                   BB

        Where the data elements directly above AA are sectors per 
        cluster, and above BB are sectors per FAT.  

        Further info on the entries in the boot sector entries used 
        to build the BIOS Parameter Block can be found in the DOS 
        3.x Technical Reference, Page 3-22.  Of course, I cannot 
        warrant that this change will work for all controller/disk 
        combinations, particularly for controllers and drives which 
        are not 'XT clones' though it 'should work' for all drives 
        compatible enough to work under DOS 3.x.

        Subject: Re: Changing the dumb '\' to '/'...


        The reason MS-DOS uses '\' as the directory delimiter is 
        that the slash ('/') is used to indicate SWITCHES in the 
        command line.  MS-DOS (PC-DOS) has a call to change the 
        SWITCH character to any character you would like (I use a 
        dash '-' because it is consistant with UNIX conventions).  
        If you change your SWITCH character, the directory delimeter 
        will change to the familiar UNIX convention '/'.  The 
        following short program can be entered into DEBUG and saved, 
        all numbers are specified in HEX.  

                MOV AX,3700 ; AH=CharOper, AL=Get it
                INT 21      ; DOS Command
                MOV DL,2D   ; DL was 2F (slash), change it to 2D (dash)
                MOV AX,3701 ; AH=CharOper, AL=Set it
                INT 21      ; DOS Command
                INT 3       ; Exit from program

        On PC-DOS or MS-DOS 2.x any time DOS specifies pathnames 
        after this program is run, it will show the slash '/' as the 
        directory delimeter.  On PC-DOS 3.x it will still use the 
        backslash '\' to display pathnames.  On any version of DOS, 
        one will be able to use the slash character to send a 
        pathname to DOS.  Remember to now use dash '-' to pass flags 
        to programs.  Also, some programs may not check to see what 
        the current SWITCH character is ( some programmers are 
        really sloppy :-) and may require the user to specify 
        pathnames using backslash.
