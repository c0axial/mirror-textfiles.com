                                The Problem

                       I could not find Opus_102.Arc

     The reason for this document is basically that I could  not  find
     Opus_102.Arc,  two  days  after  the  release  announcement.   In
     particular,  I could not find it on the  SoftwareCentral  system,
     and  I  was flamed by the sysop of that system for wanting him to
     do what he has committed himself and his node to doing.

     Dave  Finster  asked  for  suggested  solutions.  I  rambled  the
     beginnings  of this idea in Meadow,  thought I'd take the time to
     formalize it and get it out,  perhaps in time to be discussed  at
     the Conference.

     Opus distribution format is very inconsistent

     This  is  not  a  criticism - simply a statement of fact.  If one
     polls the various "big" systems around here looking for the major
     Opus archives,  even those  of  the  same  version  will  contain
     different sets of files.

     This is a royal pain in the ass.


     Distribution of new releases often damages other net functions

     Echomail was thoroughly munged in R16 around Bastille Day

     In  our  region,  Echomail  reliability  has been a long standing
     problem.  One of the reasons I was given  for  one  of  the  many
     breakdowns  was  that  the  echomail distribution nodes were busy
     sending Opus around on Bastille Day, and "something had to give".

     If IFNA maintains its hands off echomail policy, perhaps they can
     at least take some of the preassure off in other areas.  I  don't
     see why, with all the capacity of this network, "something has to
     give".

     By   streamlining   and  formalizing  the  software  distribution
     channel,  and keeping it separate  from  the  other  two  primary
     channels  (the  NetMail  routes and the Echomail backbone),  this
     might be avoided.

     Distribution should not be a problem of the creator

     Creators should not have to bear the cost of distribution

     The creators of net compatible software,  particularly  those  in
     FidoNews 4-32                Page 2                   24 Aug 1987


     the  Opus  group,  are  doing us all a great favor by putting out
     fine products for low/no cost.

     It does not seem fair that they should have to bear the  cost  of
     distribution, or even the hassle of arranging distribution.

     Not precluding creator distribution nets

     Of course,  this is not to preclude an author from setting up his
     own distribution network,  nor does it mandate the  use  of  this
     network.  In some cases, such as Spark Software, where money MUST
     change hands, it is obviously the responsibility of the author to
     handle distribution.

     Keeping track of distribution points should be easy for the sysop

     The  main  goal of this proposal is to make the life of the sysop
     simpler.   As  it  stands,   there  are   overlapping   sets   of
     distributors for Sirius,  Opus,  Dutchie,  and all the rest.  The
     sysop is not sure he can get what he wants  from  the  "official"
     IFNA  software  distribution nodes.  And he is unsure of what the
     distribution format is.

     By formalizing the distribution chain,  the  sysop  will  have  a
     known good place to look,  and the author can spend a little more
     time packaging distributions and be sure they are consistant.

     A proposed solution

     A Software Backbone - a la the Echomail backbone

     Backbone nodes to be multi-line (described below)


     Distribution Files Should Be:

     Identical on all distribution systems

     The files on all distribution nodes should be identical in  name,
     contents, internal dates, and external dates.

     Someone  who  round robin polls official distribution nodes using
     update file requests should not get the same files  twice  simply
     because the distribution systems have different dates on the same
     archives.


     On all distribution systems within 24 hours

     Once  a  proper distribution hits the chain,  it should,  in most
     cases,  be on all the other distribution  systems  (backbone  and
     regional) within 24 hours.


     Backbone nodes should NOT be otherwise committed

     FidoNews 4-32                Page 3                   24 Aug 1987


     A  Distribution Backbone or Regional Distribution node should not
     perform any other central service -  they  should  not  be  major
     echomail hubs,  NetMail Hubs, Region or Net Co-ordinator systems,
     IGATES or OGATES.

     There is simply no good reason to concentrate all these functions
     into a small number of nodes.  By doing so, all we do is increase
     the chance of one system failure entirely blacking  out  all  the
     functions of a region.


     Regional Nodes assume cost of Backbone pickup

     The  regional  nodes  should bear the cost of picking up from the
     backbones.  This is not as bad as it sounds -  there  are  enough
     latest  and  greatest  freaks out there that this should not be a
     problem.

     The backbone to backbone costs should be borne  by  the  backbone
     systems. (You gots to pay for a 1/ number!)


     Should be defined in Policy/IFNA

     I personally feel this structure should be formalized at least at
     the Policy level, and perhaps at the IFNA level.

     I  don't want to see this to end up like echomail,  where a small
     group (the echomail backbone) effectively dictates the policy  of
     the  net.  This  could be a good test of the abilities of IFNA to
     organize something,  and perhaps change the minds of the echomail
     backbone on some of their obstinancies.


     False Node Distribution

     Multiline node

     The backbone nodes would best be run on multi-line systems.


     Multiple node addresses with same phone in public nodelist

     Private number of the back channel node is kept that way

     The  backbone nodes would operate (at least) two lines,  and have
     (at least) two node numbers.  Their normal node numbers, and a 1/
     number.  The phone numbers in the nodelist would all be the  same
     - the "public" number.

     The  actual  number of the second number of each of these systems
     would be a closely held secret,  and would be associated with the
     "real" 1/ partition of their system.


     Distributors are given the real numbers
     FidoNews 4-32                Page 4                   24 Aug 1987


     Only  the  regional  distributors  would be authorized to use the
     "real" back channel numbers.  This should be enforced by as  much
     technical security as is possible.


     Authors submit via regional nodes

     In   order  to  keep  the  system  secure,   authors  would  make
     distributions via their regional node.  The regional  node  feeds
     to his backbone back channel number.  Once distributed across the
     backbone, it is fed down to the rest of the regional nodes.


     Possible problems with the solution

     Frequent releases

     A  problem  with  something  like  this will be authors of highly
     dynamic products.  Authors who add features and release on  every
     change  could  dramatically  increase  the  costs of running this
     backbone.

     Some definite policy should  be  established  on  how  frequently
     changes  are  to  be allowed,  along with a policy on exceptions.
     For instance,  Opus 1.02 has a couple of very nasty bugs,  a 1.03
     is  soon  to follow.  While there will probably be a week between
     them in this case,  if the maximum submission  rate  is  one  per
     month, some exception would have to be made.

     There  are  also  some  things  that  need  to  be  changed  more
     frequently than our "once a month" example  rule.  For  instance,
     nodelists, newsletters, and the work of the megalist and echolist
     projects.


     Distribution Format Changes

     A  related problem is a change in the format of the distribution.
     If the archive sets change, there is considerable work to be done
     on the part of the distribution system to change the references.


     Deciding what developers get access to the backbone

     Who decides what developers get access to the distribution chain?
     This is not a simple problem.  Obviously,  anyone  with  an  FTSC
     product  code  should be able to get at it.  But many products do
     not require FTSC product codes.

     I don't have any answers, good or bad, to this question.


     How to regulate access in the age of incompatible software

     The obvious way to control access  to  the  back  channel  is  to
     control  file requests and access on the basis of node number and
     FidoNews 4-32                Page 5                   24 Aug 1987


     password.  However,  given the current state  of  incompatibility
     between WaZoo and Bark session security, this is a very difficult
     problem to address.


     Wasting a high speed modem and a line

     The  "back  channel"  lines  would  like to have high speed modem
     attached to them.  However,  since these phone numbers  would  be
     have  to  be  very  restricted  in order to make this work,  this
     capacity would be wasted, to some degree.

     A possible solution is to nominally have a high  speed  modem  on
     the  backbone's  standard  line,  and a medium speed modem on the
     backchannel line, and swap them during distribution sessions.

     I look at this as part of the price one has to pay if  one  wants
     to be a "bigwig" in the net.


     Summation

     I don't want the job!

     I  obviously  am  not  tempermentally  suited  for  any social or
     political task in the network.  More importantly,  I  don't  have
     the  hardware  needed  for  this  job.  I  don't  really have the
     hardware to even handle region distribution.

     However,  there is a person I have in mind for the task of  being
     an  organizer  of  the backbone - I'm hoping he'll know who he is
     and stand up and offer to do it.

     * One Man's Opinion of PC-WRITE

                      One Man's Opinion of PC-WRITE

         by John J. Herro, 1456 Miner Circle, Endicott, NY  13760

     The author is a Senior Software Engineer for the General Electric
     Company.  He has no connection with  Quicksoft, Inc.,  except for
     being  a  registered user of PC-WRITE.  Since he knows of no Fido
     nodes near him,  he is probably best reached by the  U. S. Snail,
     otherwise known as the U. S. Mule or the Phony Express.


     PC-WRITE is an excellent  word processor / text editor written by
     Quicksoft, Inc.,  and  marketed  under  the  "Shareware" concept.
     This means that you can download the latest version from your fa-
     vorite bulletin board and try PC-WRITE for free.  You can option-
     ally "register" with Quicksoft for a reasonable fee,  but even if
     you choose not to register,  you are still encouraged to distrib-
     ute copies of the program.  This  is  such a welcome  relief from
     copy-protected  word  processors  that  sell  for several hundred
     dollars!

     PC-WRITE runs on any size PC, including a PC Junior.  The program
     includes a  brief  tutorial manual  and a quick reference  guide,
     both of which can be printed out.  Thus,  when you copy  PC-WRITE
     you are also making  copies of the two manuals,  without the need
     of an office copying machine!

     Quicksoft provides several  incentives  for you to register.  One
     is telephone support.  (More about that later.)  Users who regis-
     ter also receive a more detailed printed manual  (which would not
     fit on the PC-WRITE diskette), a one-year subscription to a news-
     letter, and two free updates (or one update and the source code).
     Finally, when you register, Quicksoft assigns a unique number for
     you to embed into the  program  before  you give away copies.  If
     anyone registers from one of your copies, Quicksoft will send you
     a modest sum, hence the name "Shareware."

     PC-WRITE contains two major programs, ED to edit a file and PR to
     print it.  You simply type  ED <filename> or  PR <filename>;  the
     on-line help is excellent.  When you first get PC-WRITE,  you run
     a special program to customize it for your particular printer.  A
     large menu of printer manufacturers is presented; when one is se-
     lected,  a menu of printer models made by that  manufacturer  ap-
     pears.  Subscripts, superscripts, boldfacing, underlining,  a va-
     riety of fonts, etc., are then all available if your printer sup-
     ports them.

     If your printer is not on the menu, PC-WRITE can treat the print-
     er as "dumb" (having no special features).  Underlining and bold-
     FidoNews 4-32                Page 7                   24 Aug 1987


     facing are still available if your printer recognizes backspaces.
     Alternately, Quicksoft will help you customize PC-WRITE.

     I've found the telephone support to be excellent, and I never re-
     ceived a busy signal.  Even  before I registered,  Quicksoft  was
     nice  enough  to help me with a printer problem.  I have a Smith-
     -Corona Deville 3 Messenger  typewriter  with a parallel computer
     interface; it isn't on the PC-WRITE menu.  It amounts to a daisy-
     -wheel printer with a very small buffer.  The DOS  PRINT  command
     was working correctly, but when I ran PR, I would get the message
     "Printer not ready, Abort, Retry, or Ignore?"  Responding with  R
     caused errors on the printed page.  My  MS-DOS  manual  explained
     how to do "infinite retry" with a SERIAL interface,  but not with
     a  PARALLEL  interface.  Since my version of MS-DOS  came with 90
     days of telephone  support,  and the 90 days  had not expired,  I
     first called the MS-DOS support telephone number.  When they were
     not able to help,  I called Quicksoft.  When Quicksoft asked if I
     had registered, I said, "No.  I'm willing to register, but I want
     to be certain  that  PC-WRITE  will  work with my printer first."
     They were very courteous about giving me help,  and advised me to
     type MODE LPT1:,,P.  That  fixed  the  problem,  and  of course I
     added that command to my  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Quicksoft also told
     me that if I had registered  first and later became dissatisfied,
     I would have no trouble getting my money back.

     ED,  the screen editor, has a few features not found even on some
     expensive word processors.  For example,  you can optionally make
     the program  continuously  keep a  paragraph  within the margins,
     even while adding words to the  middle of the paragraph!  I  find
     this feature very useful.  Also,  PC-WRITE works with ASCII files
     - a MUST for programmers.  I've even edited  .EXE files,  because
     there's no limit to the  line length.  (The screen  automatically
     scrolls  horizontally  when  long lines are edited.)  There are a
     few "font characters,"  for example,  alternate-B for Boldfacing.
     These  characters  can  optionally  be made visible or invisible.
     When  they  are  invisible,  boldfacing  appears on the screen as
     high intensity, etc.

     PR interprets the special characters for your particular printer,
     and also  optionally pauses at the end of each page,  in case you
     don't have  continuous paper.  It also has a nice feature for re-
     covering from a paper jam in a long document.  If the paper jams,
     you can interrupt PR and resume printing from the top of the cur-
     rent page or any other page.

     Other features include  definable keys, mail-merge, footnotes and
     headers, table of contents and index, automatic page breaks, file
     includes,  keyboard input  during  printing,  etc.  The method of
     writing to the screen can be changed to avoid "snow" on some sys-
     tems,  and the screen can be divided  into two windows of unequal
     size.  Text can be "cut" from one file and "pasted" into another.

     Much thought has been given to  assigning  functions to keys, al-
     though  the  assignments  can be changed if desired.  To  COPY  a
     block of text, you use F3 three times: at the start of the block,
     at the end of the block,  and at the new location.  Similarly, to
     FidoNews 4-32                Page 8                   24 Aug 1987


     MOVE a block of text, you use  F6  three times, and to  DELETE  a
     block, you use  F4  twice.  (You can undelete the block with con-
     trol-F4.)  For the  masochists  among  you,  most  of the control
     codes of Wordstar (tm of MicroPro) are duplicated.  Control-D can
     be used instead of the  -> key to move the cursor right one char-
     acter, control-F will move right one word, etc.

     PC-WRITE lacks two features that are found on some expensive word
     processors.  At present,  ED cannot handle files that are too big
     to fit in memory, and there is no spelling checker.  Rumor has it
     that both of these  deficiencies  will be removed in a later ver-
     sion.  In the meantime,  PC-WRITE  will at least help you segment
     large files, and spelling checkers like  EZSPELL and PC-SPELL can
     be found on many bulletin boards.

     PC-WRITE.ARC  is  available  on the IFNA board,  314-576-2743.  I
     hope that  PC-WRITE will become the de facto standard for PCs and
     compatibles,  and that the "Shareware" concept will put an end to
     copy protection forever!

          FidoCon, here  at last. I'm writing this from my room at the
     conference  having  just  checked  in  and   registered  for  the
     conference. I'll  be writing  parts of this over the next several
     days and am going try to keep the flow of events intact.  Most of
     this column  is going  to be  initial views of the people and the
     earlier events at  the  conference.  While  registering  I  had a
     chance to  meet several people including Thom Henderson. All I'll
     say is my mental image of Thom wasn't even close!  While he seems
     to have  the personality I expected, the physical picture doesn't
     even come close to matching.  So  far  everyone  has  seemed very
     friendly. This  paragraph is  going to come to a quick close as I
     head off to SEA's hospitality suite, the reception  and hopefully
     a dinner squeezed in somewhere.

          The  reception  on  Thursday  night  proved  to  be  a great
     success. Got  to  meet  several  of  the  net's  more  well known
     personalities, and  some that aren't so well known but definitely
     interesting. The real gem  so far  has been  the Opus hospitality
     suite sponsored  by Vince  Perriello. My  only disappointment was
     Telebit's representative turned in early.  I  had  hoped  to talk
     with him longer, but he slipped away from me while I was involved
     in another discussion. This  turned  out  to  be  for  the better
     because I got almost everything I needed the next day. We'll have
     to see how much of the good will  lasts through  this conference.
     Thankfully everyone  I've talked  to that was also at last year's
     conference say this looks  much better  organized. With  the IFNA
     meeting being  held last  on Sunday  morning, I'm  hoping it will
     last at least that long and possibly even through the meeting.

          At  the  end  of  the  first  day  of  the  program  my good
     intentions on  giving everyone  a quick  look over the conference
     have died  a  quick  death.  While  the  opening  ceremonies went
     without any  problem, I  started having to type in quick notes (I
     type faster than I write longhand).  By the  time the  high speed
     modem report  was done,  I had  over 2 pages of "quick notes" and
     things only got worse.  By the  end of  the day  I've got  over 9
     pages of these notes and it's going to take me a couple days just
     to fully decrypt all of them.  While I'm  still going  to try and
     give you  an overview  of what going on at FidoCon, I am going to
     be unable to go into any detail for the most of it.  Instead I'll
     be sending  in a  series of  articles in  addition to the regular
     column and give everyone a proper report on the most interesting,
     to me, presentations and events.

          Things  started  picking  up  Friday morning with the report
     from the FidoNet Technical Standards Committee.  The basic report
     went  quickly  with  Ryugen  Fisher,  the  Old  Frog, managing to

     lighten up an all too serious crowd. If  things keep  going along
     as they are, we should be seeing a complete level one document (a
     very complete version of what many of you  have already  seen) by
     the end  of the  year. After  the report, several people from the
     floor were able to ask some good questions  of the  committee. By
     the  end  of  the  question  and  answer  period,  we had already
     started to fall behind the agenda and we weren't able to get back
     on it until the banquet that evening.

          The report  on the  high speed modems was perhaps one of the
     longer reports on Friday, and it was unfortunately cut short just
     to get on with the agenda (we may have gotten over an hour behind
     if the question and answer period had been allowed). If  all goes
     well the  question and  answer period  is going to be rescheduled
     sometime over  the next  few days.  Other than  that, the reports
     went well  with some  genuinely interesting  information from Gee
     Wong and Bob Hartman.  Information on  why the  high speed modems
     may  not  work  well  in  certain  circumstances, the pipe-lining
     effect, and other problems that had  been encountered  with them.
     The representatives  from US  Robotics and Telebit were than able
     to give a short spiel about their products which was scheduled to
     be  followed  the  question  and  answer  period. While Hayes was
     present in the exhibition  area, we  were informed  that it  is a
     company policy  NOT to  appear at  talks like  this one. I wish I
     could give you a solid report on the  modems yet,  but I  need to
     talk to a few people and try to make some sense out of some of my
     notes on their presentations. All I say is  that Telebit appeared
     to  be  much  better  prepared  than  US  Robotics,  and that the
     Trailblazer sounds interesting.

          After the report on the high speed modems there was  a break
     for  lunch,  and  I  spent  an enjoyable lunch with Phil Ardussi,
     Marshall Presnall (of Fido  Utility), and  Vince Perriello. While
     the discussion  between Vince  and Marhsall was very interesting,
     it did leave me in the dark in a lot of places. I may know a fair
     amount about  programming, but  these two  left me sitting at the
     starting line. I was able  to  learn  some  of  Vince's  ideas on
     speeding  up  bulletin  boards.  Among them having a special term
     program to be used with a particular type of BBS program. Instead
     of having  to resend  all the  menus over and over, it would send
     them once. The next time the  user needed  to see  that menu, the
     bbs  would  only  have  send  a short code and the communications
     program would redisplay  the  captured  menu.  I've  always found
     offbeat  solutions  to  problems  like this interesting and found
     some of his ideas very interesting. I'm going to have to do a lot
     of thinking  on parts of the discussion, but be assured that once
     I've come to a conclusion, you'll know what it is!

          The afternoon  program was  split into  two different parts.
     One  a  technical  program,  which  covered  most  of the IBM net
     compatible software (some of them  new  releases  since  the last
     conference) and a legal program. I decided to go to the technical
     sessions, but will hopefully find  someone  to  talk  to  on what
     happened in  the other  room. First up was Tom Jennings, and Fido
     version 12 is  here!  This  long  awaited  version  is  ready. Be
     forewarned that  it is  a commercial  product, although there are
     FidoNews 4-32                Page 11                  24 Aug 1987


     several different rates and specials that will be  made available
     to  IFNA   members,  registered  users  and  other  groups.  From
     everything in the presentation, it is what many  of us  have been
     looking for  in Fido.  I was  able to get a copy later in the day
     from Tom, and should be able to give a really solid report  on it
     in a few weeks.

          The Opus presentation was one of less impressive to me. I am
     familiar with Opus and although I haven't done a solid review and
     test of  the new  version 1,  I have started to look at it. After
     a brief look at Opus by  Vince  Perriello  it  was  opened  up to
     questions with Wynn Wagner answering. I found it interesting that
     despite all the claims  that his  Opus has  nothing to  do with a
     certain flightless waterfowl often seen in the Bloom County comic
     strip, he was carrying a very suspicious looking  stuffed animal.
     While some  of the  questions were bug reports or problems people
     were having, there was more than  enough new  ideas on  things to
     add to  Opus to  make it  interesting. Among them Wynn's proposal
     for a new user.bbs structure and  an explanation  of some  of the
     more unusual parts of Opus. I found it interesting that there are
     three common methods for clearing a screen, and Opus uses  all of
     them. Wynn's  personality helped keep what might have become very
     down beat, bug reports, into something  that was  entertaining as
     well as informative.

          The  next  presentation  was  one  that  I  found  extremely
     interesting, TBBS.  Phil  Becker,  the  author,  had  with  him a
     complete 16  line system.  While it  can only  handle mail during
     specified times, during which  the  board  is  down,  the package
     itself came close to leaving me speechless. Many of us in the net
     have had no experience, and little knowledge of  TBBS. Until this
     presentation all  I knew  was that  it was another bulletin board
     program that  had  been  made  FidoNet  and  Echomail compatible,
     mainly through  the use  of SEAdog. There was something about one
     reasonably fast (8 mhz) AT running 16 users  at once  with little
     degradation  to  the  user  that  I found impressive. I had often
     thought it would be interesting to write a piece of software that
     would handle  several different  people at once, to find out that
     it was actually being done astonished me. In addition to this the
     board sounds  to be very flexible on how it looks and what it can
     do. Hopefully, I'll be doing a series of articles on  in the near
     future.

          Last up  was Henk  Weaver with  Dutchie. I  was surprised to
     find out that Dutchie originally started  as a  joke. Henk  did a
     wonderful job describing what Dutchie is and the slot it fills in
     the net. Some of the people  present had  never heard  of a point
     and were  very interested  in the  concept. Henk believes that in
     the next 3 to 5 years  we'll see  the traditional  bulletin board
     vanish.  Instead   we'll  use   point  systems  for  the  greater
     flexibility they can provide.  Message base  readers can  keep up
     with an  enormous number of conferences without losing out due to
     time limits. Those users who prefer  the file  areas would merely
     request a  master file list and pick the files they're interested
     in acquiring and their system would proceed to go and get them.

          The banquet was uneventful until near  the end. Surprisingly
     the  meal  was  not  as  bland  as usually found at a banquet. My
     dinner companions were "Mort Sysop" and  his wife,  my local host
     and his family, and the Looneys. Combined it made for a wonderful
     dinner with  the discussion  including such  topics as historical
     points of  interest to  visit, the current educational system and
     universities,  and  the  success  of  some  of  the  projects the
     Looney's been  involved with and have announced through FidoNews.
     The speaker after the meal was George Bond,  the Senior Executive
     Editor of BIX (Byte Information Exchange). I learned that BIX has
     much of its roots in Fido.

          In addition to the history of BIX, George asked for any help
     that could  be provided  to a special project going on in Central
     and South America. The current war  situation has  caused several
     diseases  to  reappear  and  the  doctors in the areas have often
     never seen or been trained to handle them. They had  been thought
     cured or  eradicated years  ago and it was never covered in their
     schooling. Byte was asked if they knew of  any way  for a central
     hospital to  keep in touch with its doctors and help advise them.
     At first some of the high tech people at Byte  started going into
     Microwave  relays  and  satellite  communications,  until someone
     realized that this a perfect application  of Fido.  He asked that
     if we  could spare  some time  (on the  technical matters) or old
     equipment,  it  would  be   greatly   appreciated.   For  further
     information on  this you  can contact him directly at Byte, their
     address is near the front of every issue  and address  the letter
     to George Bond. I think it is a great compliment that FidoNet has
     been asked to help such a  situation by  providing some technical
     know-how on  the very  methods its  developed. This will prove to
     many  that  we  have  come  up  with  an   important  and  useful
     technology.  This  may  become  very important if the legislators
     ever get involved with the bulletin board community.

          I'm going to wind  this  down  now.  It's  getting  time for
     another  presentation  and  I've  got  to  get this to Thom a few
     hours from now. FidoCon has been utterly enjoyable  so far  and I
     only wish  that more  had showed up. Next week the column will be
     back to normal and  you'll see  my reports  as articles appearing
     over the  next few  weeks. In  the meantime I always welcome your
     comments and can be reached at any of the addresses listed below.
     For those  of you sending me mail through FidoNet, please have it
     routed through 157/1 (157/0) as I'm currently a private node.

     Todd C. Looney
     SysOp, Vietnam Veterans Valhalla
     IFNA (Opus 1.02) 143/27


                          TALK TO YOUR COMPUTER!


     I recently had the good fortune to be introduced to a product
     that I had so much fun playing with I just HAD to tell everyone
     about it!  It's called VoiceLink, and it's consists of a little
     half-card that installs in seconds into any IBM compatible
     computer mother-board.  The micro-phone plugs right into the back
     of the card, and the cord is long enough for me to lay back in my
     chair and chatter away all day long without getting
     uncomfortable.  The software has an install program so it goes
     onto your hard disk very quickly, and theirs only one diskette!
     I've had one of these units in my home now for over a month now
     and have programmed about 87 BBS-related words so far and all I
     have to say is ... WOW!   The ONLY problem I've had so far is
     remembering the words I programmed into the system (grin).  Other
     than that, it's a snap to just walk up to my system, press the
     ALT-SPACE keys, pick up the microphone, lean back and say "DO IT
     BABALOO!" yes, you can program multiple word commands!)

     At my verbal commands I go into Opus, tell it my name, my
     password, bark out the menu commands, tell it to "CHANGE TO AREA
     5!", "READ 195!", "NEXT MESSAGE", "REPLY AND KILL", etc. etc.  I
     even played around and programmed in all the keys on my keyboard
     and if I want to just kick back and recite the letters to type,
     it'll type out my message for me!  No more little unnoticed slip
     of the fingers so I have to go back and edit, GREAT!!!!

     I must say I've really had a ball checking this product out, and
     the offer of $195.00 made below by the manufacturers through the
     Vietnam Veterans Valhalla is a fair and honest deal.  It
     installed in less than 10 minutes (just a half card...took me
     longer to get the screws off the back of the computer!)

     This product is worth the $195.00!  It's worth the $395.00!!!!!!

                    Go for it...but don't dilly dally!
     If you don't have the money now, call Bill Newton up and tell him
     to put in your order and hold it for you (tell him Todd Looney at
                  the Vietnam Veterans Valhalla SAID SO!)
