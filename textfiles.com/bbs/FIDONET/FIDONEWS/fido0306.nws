       Josh Gordon, 125/93

                         110 Baud and More History

       Boy do I remember 110 baud!  I guess I  am  about  the  same
       generation as the Editor;  let me elaborate a bit further on
       the setup I had in my first days with  a  microcomputer.  At
       the  time,  I was a newly appointed Graduate Teaching Fellow
       in C.S. at the U. of Oregon.  There was no office for me, so
       they  stuck me in the room with the mini and microcomputers;
       a brier patch!  Fun stuff.  The  newest  acquisition  was  a
       remarkably  well-stuffed  IMSAI 8080,  with (to stir up some
       nostalgia!) a Cromemco Dazzler,  a TDL Z80 card,  a  Cyclops
       CCD  camera (also by Cromemco,  I seem to recall),  an IMSAI
       VDM, a whopping 64K of RAM, and some or another serial card.
       Also resident:  a trusty old Teletype.  No  disk  drive,  of
       course;  as  I was leaving,  a Processor Tech disk drive was
       just being received.

               So:  To use the IMSAI effectively,  I had it down to
       this sequence:  First I would key in a small boot program to
       the front panel.  (I miss front panels!  On the  IMSAI,  you
       could  put  the  colored  keys in whatever order you wanted;
       either RRRR BBBB RRRR BBBB if you were a HEX man,  or if you
       were an OCTAL buff, R BBB RRR BBB RRR BBB.) This program was
       an  absolute paper tape loader.  I would then load in a more
       sophisticated hex checksum loader on paper tape.  Now  comes
       the fun part.  In the same building lived a nice PDP-10.  In
       the room with the micro were several  serial  ports.  So,  I
       would  call  up  the  PDP-10 operator,  and say,  "Hey John!
       Please connect line 39 at 19200".  He would  blanch  a  bit:
       19200  was  only  used for this purpose,  and put a somewhat
       disproportionate load on the Ten.  Once it was hooked up,  I
       had  two  things:  either a remarkably fast PDP-10 terminal,
       the only one around,  or an IMSAI 8080 with one  hell  of  a
       peripheral (the 10).

               We  actually  got  some  pretty  sophisticated stuff
       going,  rudimentary image processing with the Cyclops,  nice
       games with the Dazzler, that sort of thing. We had much more
       memory  than  any  of our friends with micros;  and the huge
       capacity of the 10,  in comparison,  gave us quite  a  nifty
       setup.

               As  a  result  of my experience in that lab,  and by
       virtue of the fact that an SF bookstore in Eugene was  owned
       by  the  soon-to-be-ex-wife  of a somewhat high muckamuck at
       IMSAI,  my first job out of college was replacing a  certain
       Rob  Barnaby  when  he  left  IMSAI to work on an odd little
       program at that time NED,  which evolved into WordStar.  But
       the story of IMSAI is for another time,  assuming someone is
       interested.

                          WHY NOT TO USE ANSI.SYS
                      by Richard Ellis (Fido 102/509)


       This may sound heretical but if there's one  thing  I  can't
       stand,  it's  a PC with ANSI.SYS installed.  I have had this
       feeling since IBM first introduced  it  with  DOS  2.0.  Why
       must  people  feel  that  having  something  blessed  by the
       American National Standards  Institute  makes  it  good  and
       wonderful?

       The first problem is the memory ANSI.SYS takes.  It takes it
       permanently;  not  just  until you reboot.  You have to edit
       the CONFIG.SYS file and reboot to recover the memory.

       The second problem is related to the first.  You can't  turn
       ANSI.SYS  off!  There  is no way a program can say "Leave me
       alone,  I'll do it myself!" I have been working on an energy
       conservation  analysis system for over two and a half years.
       It does lots of screen manipulation.  It doesn't work  quite
       right  if  ANSI.SYS is installed.  I use no ESC sequences at
       all but ANSI.SYS still interferes.  The problems are  subtle
       but they are there and they are problems.

       Finally,  let's  pretend  we  can  live  with  the first two
       problems.  The ANSI CRT standard has received much criticism
       due to its wordiness.  To put it bluntly, it's SLOW!

       I don't think ANSI.SYS would be so bad if it could be turned
       on and off as needed by programs.  I see no need to have  it
       sitting  around  all  the  time  taking memory when it's not
       needed or wanted.  This would solve the interference problem
       and anyone that didn't  mind  their  software  running  slow
       could use it.

       In  conclusion I would like to plead to all software authors
       to not use ANSI.SYS.

                          Looking for Old Talkies

       It occured to me that a LOT of radio stations are  switching
       from  commercial  two  way  gear  to cellular mobile phones.
       Makes sense,  faster,  better quality,  easier to put on the
       air,  less maintenance.  And I know that right now,  anyway,
       used two-way gear is a drag on the  market.  Well,  if  your
       station  is  making  the switch and you'd like to get rid of
       the  old  walkie-talkies  and  get  a  nice  tax  deduction,
       consider giving them to the American Council of the Blind.

       Every year we have to rent them for our annual convention at
       rip-off  prices,  but we just don't have the free cash right
       now to buy our own.  Our annual convention has grown to  the
       point  where  we  have to have 'em just to keep functioning.
       Going to look for someone,  or sticking a message  up  on  a
       cork  board  just  doesn't  work when you are dealing with a
       meeting of 3,000 people,  95% of them blind.  Plus our  next
       convention, in Knoxville, Tennessee, in July, will be spread
       out between two major hotels!

       We  are  interested in most any kind of used commercial two-
       way gear,  VHF or  UHF.  We  also  would  be  interested  in
       chargers,  batteries, cases, spare rubber duckies, etcetera.
       Just send Fidomail to Vernon Henley,  Fido 147/1 and I  will
       get  right  back to about your donation.  Also,  be watching
       down in this direction for a burst of interest in Fido  from
       blind users.  Our monthly magazine,  the Braille Forum, will
       soon carry an article about  Fido,  and  there  are  several
       other  projects  in  the  works.  If you or someone you know
       would like a free subscription,  just drop me a line at  the
       same  address.   You  need  not  be  blind  to  receive  the
       magazine.  Please specify large print,  cassette or  Braille
       (the  cassette  requires  a special type player that usually
       only a blind person would have.)

       I would be pleased to answer any or all questions concerning
       ACB or blindness in general for you,  your  users  or  their
       friends,  relatives  or  acquaintances.  If I don't know the
       answer, I usually know someone who does,  and I love sending
       and  receiving  letters,  so  please feel free to direct any
       inquiry this way,  no matter how off the wall it  might  be.
       (No  matter  what  it is,  I've heard it before,  probably.)
       Thanks for your consideration, and ask your boss about those
       talkies.  It might be just the push he finally needs to make
       the jump to cellular.

       Fido 109/612

                        Confessions of a Fido Tyro


       Is WASH-A-RUG (109/483) a carpet laundry?  That was my first
       thought,  especially  after  I  discovered  that  FIDO-FHLMC
       (109/456)  really  IS  related to Freddie Mac.  Just what is
       the story  behind  these  electronic  bulletin  boards  with
       cutesy illustrations of dogs on them?

       I was initiated to the world of Fido by an announcement in a
       publication  of  an  organization  I belong to.  Having some
       experience as a subscriber to  CompuServe,  I  was  able  to
       connect myself to the BBS listed in the announcement.  After
       a  few  minutes I said to myself,  this is very interesting,
       but what's it for?  Also,  knowing how the minutes add up to
       $$$s  at CompuServe,  I wondered how much this diversion was
       costing me.

       My state of perplexity wasn't aided by reading  the  sysop's
       editorial,  in which HE was expressing some doubts about the
       usefulness of his new BBS.  All of a sudden my monitor  took
       on  a  life  of  its own,  and I slowly realized that he was
       "chatting" with me.  He reassured me that it was costing  me
       nothing,  but  that  made me even more leery.  If it's free,
       then how can he afford the required time and equipment to do
       this?  And though it seemed a bit dumb to be typing at  each
       other,  when  we  could  have picked up the phone and talked
       much  more  quickly,   I  played  along  and   enjoyed   the
       conversation.

       I'm afraid now I'm hooked.  A person who has always hated to
       use the phone,  I now find myself dialing BBS numbers when I
       could be doing more constructive things.  In  the  few  days
       since I made my first Fido contact,  I have graduated myself
       to Expert help-level status (even if I have to  occasionally
       resort  to  "?"),  and learned my way around several boards.
       I'd like to share some impressions and suggestions.

       I think the possibilities of sharing and  communicating  are
       what  appeal most to me.  I use my micro primarily for word-
       processing,  and will probably never become a programmer.  I
       admit  that  it  is great to be able to download a file here
       and there,  and obtain utilities or programs for  free,  but
       there  are  only so many utilities and programs one can use;
       beyond a certain point one approaches overkill or obsession.

       Because of the potential for  communication,  then,  FidoNet
       and  FidoNews are fascinating developments,  and I hope more
       people will get modems and participate  in  BBS  networking.
       Any   use   of   technology   that   furthers  interpersonal
       communication should be utilized to  the  fullest.  But  how
       can new participants in Fido networking best be obtained?

       As  I groped my way around the boards,  I got the impression
       that everyone else on the board was already a  computer  and

       Fido expert;  it was as though they had all gone through the
       same class  together.  Most  Fido  users  seem  to  be  into
       "heavy"  technical  stuff,  and talk about hardware the same
       way guys used to talk about their cars and accessories.  How
       does an outsider get into this seemingly closed group?

       I was able to see what Fido DOES to some extent,  but I  had
       no  idea where it came from,  why and when it was developed,
       and its guiding philosophy and goals (if any).  On one board
       (The Trading Post) I was happy to  find  a  "FIDO  TUTORIAL"
       area,  and  a  downloadable  Fido User Manual.  The sysop of
       this board obviously had  the  new  user  in  mind  when  he
       designed it,  and perhaps other boards should also take into
       consideration the fact that some users will know very little
       about what they are doing, and will need some coaching.

       I realize, though, that most sysops,  being well advanced in
       computer  and  Fido  usage  (or  else,  I'm  assuming,  they
       wouldn't be sysops),  don't want to clutter or slow up their
       boards  by making them more "user friendly" for a Fido tyro.
       Consequently,  perhaps there should be some boards that  are
       set up EXPRESSLY for beginners.  Such boards can have mostly
       ".TXT" files to be typed and downloaded,  and  a  very  non-
       threatening  and  supportive environment.  Such boards could
       also have general information about Fido,  or explain  where
       such  information  can  be  obtained.  Perhaps  these boards
       could be operated by sysops who are not very far from  being
       tyros  themselves,  and  they  could build up experience and
       expertise before tackling a more sophisticated BBS.

       I'd  appreciate  feedback  (partly  to  prove  that FidoNews
       really DOES get read).  I think I'll go call another  BBS--I
       wonder what the NASA Gas Net is all about?

              A Suggestion For a New File Transfer Protocol


       This  article  addresses  the   problems  inherent  in  Ward
       Christensen's  original  XMODEM  protocol,   which  are  not
       entirely  solved by any of the new protocols that have  been
       introduced  since.   It  then proposes a new  protocol  that
       would  be  a natural successor to the XMODEM  protocol,  and
       that  may  provide  more effective  long-term  solutions  to
       those problems.


       I.  Introduction

       I  have used Ward Christensen's XMODEM protocol for  several
       years.   In  that time I have become aware of  (actually,  I
       have  run  head  on into) several problems with  it.   These
       problems  are mostly solved, to a greater or lesser  degree,
       by  many of the current new crop of protocols that have been
       introduced  in the past few years.  However, the methods  by
       which  they have been solved are less than might be desired,
       and  introduce  new problems, mostly of  compatibility  with
       existing file transfer methods.

       II.  The Problems

       The  problems I am referring to are (1) the total lack of  a
       way  to  transfer  file   information  (file  name,  length,
       creation  date),  (2) relatively poor data  throughput,  and
       (3)  very  poor  performance of most software at  high  data
       rates (i.e.  rates greater than about 1200 to 2400 baud).

       The  first  problem   is   self-evident   in   the  protocol
       definition  itself.   Ward  Christensen provided no  way  to
       transfer file information.

       The  second  problem  has to do both  with  the  theoretical
       efficiency  of  the  protocol, and with the  efficiency  (or
       lack  thereof)  of  the   implementation.   The  theoretical
       efficiency  of  a  protocol is determined  by  dividing  the
       number  of  bits of actual data by the total number of  bits
       transmitted.   The obvious way to increase such  efficiency,
       then,  is  to  increase  the   amount  of  data  transmitted
       relative  to the amount of control information  transmitted.
       The  straight XMODEM protocol (using 128-byte blocks) ranges
       from  about  95% efficient in the worst case, to  about  96%
       efficient  in the best case.  (The best case occurs when the
       number  of  data  bytes  fits evenly  into  the  transmitted
       blocks  [the  file length is evenly divisible by  the  block
       length,  128 in this case].  The worst case is when the last
       block  transmitted  contains only one actual data byte  plus
       filler  for  the rest of the block.) The efficiency  of  the

       same  protocol using 1024-byte blocks ranges from 99% in the
       best  case to 93% in the worst case.  Efficiency is  lowered
       in  any  case,  of  course, if errors  occur.   The  average
       XMODEM  efficiency  is, therefore, around 96%.  The  average
       efficiency  when using 1024-byte blocks is also around  96%.
       So  increasing  the  block  length is  no  solution  to  the
       theoretical  efficiency problem.  A better solution would be
       to  use variable-length blocks (say varying between 128  and
       1024  or  2048  bytes).  This may also  help  solve  another
       problem.

       The  major problem with the actual effective data throughput
       of  most  XMODEM-type  file  transfers has to  do  with  the
       efficiency  of  the  software doing the  transfer.   In  any
       transfer,  the  throughput of the transfer is controlled  by
       the  speed  of  the least efficient side  of  the  transfer.
       Usually,  at  300  or   1200   (or   even  2400)  baud,  the
       inefficiency  of most software is not noticeable.   However,
       when  the  data rate is increased, the inefficiency of  most
       of  the  software make the effective throughput stay  around
       1200  or 2400 baud, at best.  (There are notable  exceptions
       to  this, particularly Greg Gilley's TERM terminal  emulator
       program  for  the  TI Pro, which is the absolute  best  I've
       seen  at this.  There may be others that I'm not aware  of.)
       Although  the  best  solution to this problem  would  be  to
       optimize  the  efficiency of the software, this may  not  be
       feasible  in  all cases.  Longer or variable block  lengths,
       which  increase the efficiency of the protocol and make  the
       software  spend  more  time   actually  transmitting  blocks
       rather  than processing, would undoubtedly help, even if  it
       wouldn't completely solve the problem.

       In  addition,  there  is  a  problem  that  stems  from  the
       attempts  by a very large number of programmers to solve the
       problems  outlined  above.   This can be summed  up  in  the
       statement  that none of the current file transfer  protocols
       provide  any  convenient  way for the receiving  and  trans-
       mitting  programs to reconcile what extensions to the XMODEM
       protocol  will  be  used in the  current  transfer.   (These
       extensions  include  CRC  error checking  [rather  than  the
       checksum  method  used in the original XMODEM],  and  larger
       data  packets  [as  in the relatively new  YMODEM  protocol,
       which  provides 1024-byte data packets to increase  through-
       put].)  A   compatibility   problem   also   exists  between
       different  XMODEM-based  protocols, such as Telink,  MODEM7,
       and YMODEM.

       The  current  methods  to   accomplish  some  reconciliation
       between  receiver and sender range in most new  XMODEM-based
       protocols  from  nonexistent   to  the  "C-instead-of-a-NAK"
       method  for  establishing CRC error checking, and  different
       characters  (instead of SOH) as packet prefixes in protocols
       that  use a "packet zero" and non-128-byte-packets (see  the
       descriptions  below  of  the Telink and  YMODEM  protocols).
       Different  implementations  use   different   features,  and
       future  implementations  may use still  different  features.
       There  is  really  no  way, currently,  to  accomplish  this
       reconciliation, in any existing protocol.


       Fidonews                   Page  8               10 Feb 1986





       There  is another problem with most XMODEM-based  protocols,
       having  to  do with CRC error checking.  In  most  implemen-
       tations,  a "C" is sent by the receiver instead of the first
       NAK,  to  signal  CRC  mode.    If  the  transmitter  hasn't
       responded  by  the  third  "C",  the  receiver  switches  to
       checksum  mode, and sends a NAK.  The transmitter presumably
       responds  to this by sending the first data packet, and  the
       transfer  continues  in  checksum  mode.   The  timeout  for
       response  to  the "C" is three seconds.  Thus, the start  of
       the  transfer  may  be delayed by as much as  nine  or  more
       seconds,  if  the  transmitter  doesn't  support  CRC  error
       checking.


       III.  Some Existing Protocols

       There  is  currently a proliferation of new  protocols,  all
       more-or-less  loosely based on Christensen's protocol.  Most
       have  features  that are desirable.  However, none  of  them
       have  provided  any really effective, long-term solution  to
       the  problems  enumerated  above, most of them are  to  some
       degree  incompatible  with Christensen's original  protocol,
       and  most, if not all, have added a level of complexity,  to
       an  originally  simple  protocol, that  prevents  them  from
       really  taking hold in the user community the way XMODEM has
       done.   Some  examples  of these  protocols  include  MODEM7
       (originator    unknown),    YMODEM   (originated   by  Chuck
       Forsberg),  and Telink (originated by Tom Jennings).   There
       are good and bad points about each of them.

       MODEM7  uses a very clumsy and error-prone method of  trans-
       ferring  the file name, although this does allow batch  file
       transfers.

       YMODEM,  used primarily on CP/M and UNIX systems, allows CRC
       error  checking  (using  the  "C-instead-of-a-NAK"  method),
       1024-byte  data  packets,  and the transfer of  file  infor-
       mation  (filename,  length,  and date) in a  "packet  zero",
       allowing  batch  file  transfers.  A problem exists  in  the
       YMODEM  protocol,  however,  in the area  of  the  1024-byte
       packet  length.   According   to   the   definition  of  the
       protocol,  a 1024-byte packet is prefixed with a STX  rather
       than  a SOH, and the receiver must be able to handle any mix
       of  128-  and  1024-byte  packets.  This use  of  STX  as  a
       data-packet  prefix  is   inconsistent   with  the  original
       simplicity of the XMODEM protocol.

       Telink  uses the same clumsy method of transferring the file
       name  that  is  used in MODEM7, which is ironic,  as  Telink
       transfers  the  file  name again in a "packet  zero",  which
       also  contains the file size and date, and is prefixed  with
       a  SYN  rather than an SOH (see the description,  above,  of
       the  YMODEM  protocol).   Telink  also  provides  CRC  error
       checking, using the "C-instead-of-a-NAK" method.

       Another  protocol,  which  is   not   based  on  the  XMODEM
       protocol,  and  which  solves most of the problems  in  that
       protocol  (at the expense of a lot of added complexity),  is


       Fidonews                   Page  9               10 Feb 1986





       the  Kermit protocol.  This protocol uses "command  packets"
       to  set  various  parameters between the  receiver  and  the
       sender.   This  protocol  is  commonly  used  in  university
       settings,  between  microcomputers   and   mainframes.   The
       protocol  is Unix-based.  The primary reason that Kermit has
       not  taken hold is because of that added complexity.  Kermit
       can  be difficult and tedious to implement, and the protocol
       has  features that are unneeded by most microcomputer users,
       as  well  as  some restrictions not present  in  the  XMODEM
       protocol.


       IV.  A New Protocol?

       Fine,  you  say.   Problems exist.  But is  a  new  protocol
       required,  when  there is a huge (well, maybe not huge,  but
       certainly  large)  proliferation of protocols.   Wouldn't  a
       new  protocol  just add to the existing mess?  I say that  a
       new  protocol is needed.  It should not try to be all things
       to  all people, as some existing protocols do, and it should
       not  compromise  the  essential simplicity of  the  original
       Christensen  XMODEM   protocol,   except   where  absolutely
       necessary.   It  should, however, allow the use of  the  new
       features  of  XMODEM-based file transfer, such as CRC  error
       checking  and  large packet lengths.  It should  attempt  to
       allow  file  transfers with virtually any XMODEM-based  file
       transfer  protocol implementation, using the straight XMODEM
       protocol.   It  should  also  be  as  easily  expandable  as
       possible, in order to meet possible future needs.

       I  propose  a  new  protocol   that  would  incorporate  the
       following features:

            1)  NO  IMPLEMENTATION  SHOULD BE REQUIRED  TO  SUPPORT
                MORE  THAN  THE   MINIMAL   XMODEM   FILE  TRANSFER
                PROTOCOL,  in  terms  of  CRC  error  checking  and
                packet  lengths.  This excepts the transfer of file
                information.

            2)  Transfer  of file information, including  filename,
                file  size,  and  file  date.   The  "packet  zero"
                method?  "Command packets", as in Kermit?

            3)  An  easy  way to let the receiver  and  transmitter
                agree  on what features will be used in the current
                transfer.   This  is the major problem that  I  see
                with  most  of the current XMODEM-based  protocols.
                This  might be accomplished several ways.  One  way
                would  be transmitter-driven, using a "packet zero"
                containing  file info and several bytes devoted  to
                what  features are supported.  Another method might
                use  Kermit's  solution   to   the  problem,  which
                involves    the   receiver   and   the  transmitter
                exchanging  some  kind   of   packet   (a  "command
                packet")  containing "feature-present" flags.   The
                features  used  would  be the exclusive-or  of  the
                "feature-present"    flags.    The   packets  might
                contain other information, as well.


       Fidonews                   Page 10               10 Feb 1986





            4)  The capability to support CRC error checking, with-
                out  requiring  such support.  (That is, it  should
                allow  CRC  error checking, but it should not  pro-
                hibit the checksum method.)

            5)  The  capability of using longer or variable  packet
                lengths     to      increase     data   throughput.
                (Variable-length    packets    would    be   easily
                implemented  by  adding  a  control  word  to  each
                packet containing the length of the packet.)

            6)  Batch file transfers.  This should be  accomplished
                easily, if item 2 is successfully accomplished.

            7)  Full minimal XMODEM compatibility, as the  default.
                This  means  no file information transfer,  no  CRC
                error  checking,  128-byte packets, and no way  for
                the  receiver  and transmitter to communicate  what
                features  will  be  used (this  last  is  obvious).
                This    might    be    accomplished     using   the
                "C-instead-of-a-NAK"  method,   using   some  other
                character than C.  Read "C" as NAK.

            8)  The protocol should be receiver-driven, as much  as
                possible.   However,  a  method   should  exist  to
                exploit  the  full capabilities of each end of  the
                transfer.   This  requirement  may  be  changed  or
                removed,  as it and item 3 may prove to be mutually
                exclusive.

            9)  Easy  expandability.  The protocol  should  include
                some  method  (such as reserved fields  in  command
                packets  or  in   a   "packet   zero")  for  future
                expansion.

       The  full  definition of the protocol would include all  the
       enhancements  outlined above.  As shown, the protocol  would
       also  allow  subsets (including a subset consisting  of  the
       original  XMODEM  protocol),  and  would  define  a  way  to
       specify  which  set of enhancements would be used  for  each
       transfer.

       There  are a number of methods of satisfying these  require-
       ments.   I  can see none that exactly fit the spirit of  the
       original    XMODEM   implementation   and   that  completely
       eliminate  all  the  problems mentioned  in  this  document.
       However,  it  may  not be possible to do both.   I  can  see
       several  possible  solutions that do satisfy these  require-
       ments,  using  features from several of the existing  proto-
       cols, and some new features.


       V.  Conclusion

       The  problems  mentioned in this document are real, and  the
       great  proliferation  of  file transfer  protocols  are  not
       helping  the  matter.   As I see it, some  new  protocol  is
       needed  that  is a logical successor to XMODEM, that  incor-


       Fidonews                   Page 11               10 Feb 1986





       porates  most  of  the  most-used features  of  the  current
       protocols,  and  that  is  as compatible  as  possible  with
       existing  protocols.   I think that the the general  outline
       above may provide such a protocol.

       I  have  not started implementing this  protocol,  primarily
       because  I don't want to go to all that work and have it  be
       completely  ignored.   I would like to see the  people  most
       directly  affected  contribute their opinions and  expertise
       to  the solution of the problems I've mentioned.  This means
       you,  the public BBS user.  By no means am I saying that the
       protocol  I've  outlined  is THE solution.  It is  merely  a
       suggestion  for  one  possible   solution.   However,  I  do
       believe  that a solution is needed, and soon.  Obviously  no
       one  protocol can be completely satisfactory to every person
       in  every  situation.   But we can come up with  a  solution
       that  solves  most  of the problems I've mentioned,  and  is
       also easy to use and implement.

       As  I  mentioned above, I would like to see a lot of  people
       get  involved.  My hope is that we, the user community,  can
       get  together and design and implement a good new  protocol,
       standardize it, and get it into common use.  If we can, per-
       haps  the  computer  industry, which has for the  most  part
       ignored  us  (although there have been a few notable  excep-
       tions  recently), will begin to view us a a real  innovative
       and productive force in computing.

       Don Daniels
       Sysop, Fido 107/211

                                  OUTSIDE


       In Version 11q of FIDO,  a  new  command  was  added  called
       O(utside).  Similar  to  the  Sysop-only  "0" command,  this
       command is available to any level of user  (as  set  by  the
       Sysop)  and  causes  FIDO  to terminate without dropping the
       phone connection.  A specific ERRORLEVEL  is  returned  that
       can be tested in the batch file that initiated FIDO in order
       to determine further action.  (If you have recently upgraded
       to 11q, you must delete your old MAINPRIV.BBS, enter FIDO as
       a Sysop,  and issue a  "3  O  priv-level"  command  for  the
       O)utside command to work properly at the access level(s) you
       wish.)

       Just  what such further action may be implemented is totally
       of no concern to FIDO,  as it  is  left  to  the  individual
       Sysops.  This  brings  up  the questions,  "Just what should
       this facility be used for on my system?" and "How do I  make
       sure that only the right people are running it and that they
       are not gaining control of the whole machine?"

       Well,  the  answer to the second question may well be in the
       form of a new program called, appropriately enough, OUTSIDE,
       which allows you to place several levels of control on  what
       is executed and by whom.

       OUTSIDE  is  kind  of  like a miniature FIDO that displays a
       welcome message (OUTSIDE.WEL) on the screen,  validates  the
       users  (again) by checking their names and passwords against
       USER.BBS, and then displays a small menu of options for user
       selection.  These include:

           L  List the services available to this particular user
           X  Execute a service
           R  Return to FIDO (via the batch file)
           ?  Display contents of a Help file (OUTSIDE.HLP)

       The Services that are available to users are specified in  a
       Service  Control  File  called  OUTSIDE.SRV which is created
       off-line by the Sysop.  It allows for an identification  and
       description of each service,  optional passwords,  specifica-
       tion of which of four levels of security should be used, the
       method of Service initiation,  and,  for those  entries  for
       which it is necessary, a list of authorized users.

       Depending  on  the nature of the Services,  several Services
       may be executed by the user  before  returning  to  FIDO.  A
       log,  OUTSIDE.LOG,  is  maintained  which keeps track of all
       OUTSIDE users, the Services they use,  and certain anomalies
       which may occur.

                        But You Can't dTUNE a Fish
                                    by
                              Ben Silverstein


       Some of you may be familiar with  a  bulletin  board  system
       called  The Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine RCP/M.  It is based in
       Phoenix,  Arizona and is run by  James  A.  Gronek.  If  the
       board isn't familiar, Jim's name should be to anyone who has
       more   than   a  passing  acquaintance  with  public  domain
       software.  Jim has written several original and updated many
       existing public domain programs,  mostly  in  the  realm  of
       dBASE  II applications.  One that will ring a bell with most
       users is DBSHELL,  the .CMD file that makes dBASE more  user
       friendly.

       Some  time ago,  Jim wrote a utility for dBASE command files
       called dTUNE.  This little gem allowed dBASE programmers  to
       write their files with liberal comments, proper indentation,
       and all the other habits essential to good programming,  and
       then "detune" it to a file that was the absolute  bare-bones
       that  dBASE  needs  to  run,  and no more.  All commands are
       reduced  to  their  minimum  4  character   representations,
       comments and unneccessary blank lines,  tabs, and spaces are
       deleted.  This reduces the space  needed  on  disk  for  the
       files,  increases  execution  time  by eliminating number of
       lines that dBASE must parse, and makes it harder for someone
       to follow the  program  listing.  The  source  file  is  not
       changed;  all  changes  are  written  to  a new file and the
       original renamed to type .SRC.

       The original public domain version was written in the  dBASE
       language itself and tokenized with  one  of  the  commercial
       RUN-TIME(c) clones.  This didn't allow listing, but could be
       run  by  the user with no difficulty.  Jim has now rewritten
       the program in TURBO  Pascal  and  is  offering  the  latest
       version  as a commercial product.  As a beta tester,  I have
       had the oppurtunity to try out the new version over the last
       couple of months.  Several new features have been  added  to
       dTUNE,  and  execution  time  is much improved thanks to the
       speed of Turbo.

       With the package,  Jim has included a terminal  installation
       program  so  that dTUNE may be customized to run on a number
       of different terminals.  This part  was  created  using  the
       GINST portion of the Turbo Toolbox utility disk from Borland
       that  installs  an application program with the same routine
       used to install Turbo itself.

       When the program is invoked,  you are presented with a  well
       laid  out menu showing the program choices and their current
       condition.  Most are toggles,  and pressing the  appropriate
       key  will  turn  them  on  or  off.  Several combinations of


       Fidonews                   Page 15               10 Feb 1986





       functions and outputs are available.


       Some of the high points of dTUNE are that it:

       - Prints a nested and indented listing of your command  file
         with lines connecting the IF/ENDIF, DO WHILE/ENDDO, and DO
         CASE/ENDCASE  pairs.  This  makes debugging easier in that
         is is readily apparent if you have an open-ended function.

       - Alters the case of your command file.  Text may be changed
         to upper or lower case as you wish,  with delimited fields
         left untouched.

       - Produces a trimmed file as described above that will  have
         a faster execution time.

       - Produces a nested and  indented  version  of  the  trimmed
         file.  Handy  in  case you lose the original file and must
         reconstruct it from the dTUNEd version.

       - Produces  a  cross-referenced  listing   of   all   memory
         variables.  Two files are produced: a .PRN file containing
         line  numbers,  and  a .XRF file with all variables listed
         alphabetically.

       - Allows a listing of any of the above files to be  sent  to
         the printer,  saving the trouble of printing them manually
         later.

       A status window is updated during processing,  allowing  you
       to  monitor  the progress of dTUNE.  This program works very
       quickly,  and I have found no bugs in the times that I  have
       used  it.  I have a small wish list,  but that is always the
       case.  dTUNE will run on any  Z-80  based  computer  with  a
       miminum  48K  TPA.  A smaller (40K) TPA version is available
       for those who need it.

       The public domain version (v3.1) of dTUNE can  be  found  on
       many remote systems around the country, or on Jim's board at
       the number below.  Check drive A2: for the CP/M version, and
       A9: for the MS-DOS edition. dTUNE 4.0 is in beta testing now
       and will be available soon.  The price will be approximately
       $35.00  from  Jim  through his company,  UCS,  Inc.  You may
       order by mail to the following address:

       Editor's note:  We've recently received a set of back issues
       to the European counterpart of FidoNews.  We'll  be  running
       articles from them for the next several issues.  I apologize
       to  our  European  readers  for  printing what is to you old
       news, but it's new to many of us here in the Colonies.

                             Notes from Abroad


       Hello, Good-Evening, and Welcome.

       Unlike my continental counterparts I am not multilingual,  I
       have  trouble  with  English!  I  will  apologize now if you
       cannot translate this!

       There is so much public domain software around  that  a  new
       medium for distribution must be found.  I have a DC-600 tape
       backup  (25  Meg) and I am willing to let any Fido sysop who
       has a DC-600 tape backup have  a  copy  of  my  tapes.  This
       makes  much more sense than sending hundreds of floppy disks
       through the post.  The tape is not finished  yet  and  I  am
       still  looking  for  more  software,  please send me any new
       public domain software or anything that is not listed in  my
       catalog.   I   am  currently  negotiating  with  several  UK
       hardware houses to supply me  with  various  types  of  tape
       streamers,  cassette  backups,  and removable hard disks.  I
       suggest that any Fido sysop who  has  not  yet  got  a  tape
       backup that they contact their local hardware houses and put
       this idea to them:

       There  are  approximately  500  Fido  systems throughout the
       world,  each with the same problem as  me;  lots  of  public
       domain  software,  (I  have 500 disks,  60 Meg) and no fixed
       standard for distribution except the  floppy  disk.  If  the
       same tape streamers were supplied to all Fido's (DC-600,  or
       DC1000) that in itself should establish that particular unit
       as the de-facto standard for exchange of an ever  increasing
       supply  of  public domain software.  If we can work together
       on this one I think we would all be better off.

       Just think  what  a  bonus  it  would  be  to  various  tape
       manufacturers.  They  could tell potential customers that if
       they bought their backup system  that  they  could  ask  the
       various  user groups and bulletin boards for a copy of their
       public domain software library on tape!!

       If anyone has tried this  approach,  or  has  any  ideas  or
       suggestions  please let me know.  I think it would be a good
       idea to conduct a census on all Fido nodes to see what  sort
       of backup we use.  It may be that we have a standard already
       without  knowing  it.  Is  anyone  willing  to  conduct  the
       aforementioned census?

       Please send all ideas to me, Fido 4403.
