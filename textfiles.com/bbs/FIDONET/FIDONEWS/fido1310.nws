Fido & Politics
Part 2 of ?
By Patrick Driscoll

    As I read last weeks Snooze, I realized I have hit a chord with at
least 2 other sysops in Fidonet. They both discussed basically what I
am planning to cover this week...Fido and the Internet.

    First, a little story. Many years ago, a small computer company
made a computer. It worked fairly well, and the company convinced many
schools in the US to buy their computer. Their computer ran on a
different standard than normal, high-end business computers and they
thought they could become the standard if they got all the children to
use their computers.

    Well, the high-end business computers got less high-end and every
one was buying these computers. The little company noticed this but
thought they could still be the standard. The other computers became
wide used and became the defacto standard, but the little company still
kept their standard, saying everyone will come around and use their
computers. When the evil, other computers were the standard, the little
company thought "hey. maybe we should use that standard, since nobody
uses ours", but that was too little, too late. Now the little company
is still little, with nowhere to go but down. This is a prime example
of not reading the winds of change correctly and not reacting quick
enough to the change.

   Fidonet is at this same point right now. We were a contender as THE
net at one time, but not anymore. We have failed to read the winds of
change, and are failing to act now. The Internet has jumped in leaps
and bounds over the last 2 years. The Usenet, which is a companion to
the Internet, has also grown over the last 2 years. Fidonet, on the
other hand, has started a downhill slide, mostly over the last 2 years.
While we will never be a 'worldwide web' class of system, we can still
be a contender for a Usenet class system. Fidonet hatches out a
NODEDIFF file, a file used to update the Fido Nodelist, weekly. In the
past 6 months I have followed the nodediffs and have watched whole nets
just disappear. Systems come and systems go, but a net should be in the
nodelist forever...but only if there are nodes in an area to have a
net. Politics have some to do with this, but mostly it's a lack of use
by the users.

    Here is my experience on what has happened. In the past, say 3
years ago, I had a fairly active userbase that used Fido. I had an
average of 30 calls a day, which was not bad for this area at the time.
Now, I average over 100 calls a day, with little to no use of the Fido
areas, but a fairly heavy use of the few Usenet areas I carry.
Technically, there is no difference between the echomail theory and the
Usenet theory. Both offer areas geared to a particular subject or an
FidoNews 13-10                 Page:  3                    04 Mar 1996

area of interest, but the Usenet has some distinct advantages. First,
the Usenet has a much greater dispersion of mail. Second, the mail is
MUCH faster. Fido just doesn't have the speed of the Usenet, but could
have the usership of the Usenet if it offered the speed. A few things
are stopping this from happening. One, we lack to software to handle
doing this kind of mail network. Fidonet runs on a archahic system of
connected computers on dialup lines. Ok, some say "but my mail comes
in via automated FTP or Planet Connect. Well, we are still bottlenecked
by the landline based starhubs and smaller distribution points all
through the net. The whole concept of echomail transfers via FTS must
be looked at again from a technical standpoint. The second reason we
can't do a Usenet style net is the powers that be wish to retain all
control of the net, for whatever reasons. Almost all major hubs in
fidonet wish to continue with business as usual. No tricky software
changes, no 'anyone can get the mail and distribuate it' kind of
thoughts, ect. for these people. They maintain control, and thats the
way it is.

    As for our netmail capabilities, they are lame at best. I offer free
internet e-mail to any of my users, and did offer free netmail until I
discovered that most Fidonet sysops do not allow non-sysop email on
thier boards. As was explained to me by one sysop, "if a user wants to
send netmail to someone, have him just get an Internet account, as I
ain't bothering with netmail to my users". Netmail, according to many
sysops, is a way for SYSOPS to contact each other, thats it. Maybe so,
or maybe not, but do remember, services like JUNO offer absolutly free
E-mail with local dialup access to most of the US. If we are planning
to compete for users with the Internet, we need to look at this aspect
also. The present method of sending netmail is too expensive for the
small sysop to crash at anytime, and too slow to route it via the
channels that exist. Again we need to look at changing our technology
to handle this sort of mail, and get the politics of the routing
channels out of the loop.

    Ok, you say I talk the talk, but don't offer any solutions. Here
are some suggestions I have. I do not profess to have a lot of
technical training in this field but do have enough to offer an idea
or two. We could develop a method of a central distribution point in
each zone and use automated FTP to move the mail. Right now, many
systems are using this method to get mail from George Peace, as my net
does. David Blanchard, the NEC of net 372, does a damn good job moving
the mail, at a cost of $5.00 a month. He pays George Peace whatever he
asks a month plus the cost of an Internet account. Does the internet
account have to be a full service SLIP/PPP account? I don't think so.
I believe it can be done with a inexpensive Unix shell. Just consider
the cost of the Internet account as part of running a BBS, and it does
not look that bad. If we pushed this method of mail moving, we could
have a noticeable increase in speed. The main distribution point should
also allow netmail to be gated into and from the internet, and forwarded
to whatever system it is addressed to, and that system should be able
to easily post the netmail on his/her board for the user to read and
respond to. This would cut the cost of netmail considerably, and speed
it up. It all sounds good, but how to do it? Again, we are limited by
software and the FTSC/FTN technology. Change the standards and the
authors will write programs to suite the new standards. Anyone who has
FidoNews 13-10                 Page:  4                    04 Mar 1996

a valid nodenumber should get mail from whoever wishes to feed them,
and not be forced to use the local hub.
I say the internet already exists, lets see if we can't use it to help
Fidonet survive in this new world. More on this issue in the next
Snooze, if they wish to post it.

       As usual, all love letters, flames, death threats, ect. welcome.

Prime Directive
by Bill Whitehouse

     After 8 years, the fido policy I continue to find most appealing is
its 'promote the growth of network' prime directive, a requirement that
assumes like any other living organism or human enterprise, unless fido
grows, fido dies...

     Snooze editor Donald Tees is right, my fellow fidonuts. The numbers
confirm it. Fidonet is dying.

     Blaming our appointed coordinators is all too easy. They've long
since ceased to promote the growth of this network, unless they can
self-promote every last dime out of it. Witness the fact that with 4
primary North American fido vendors, the oaficial area lists now reflect
reality for only one of them.

     No, our coordinators are only a symptom. We've seen the enemy and
the real enemy is us. Remember those quaint days of yesteryear when many
feared the phone company megaliths would finally contrive to shut down
bbsing forever?

     We've forgotten why we're here, what makes fido unique. We belong
to a network that belongs to all of us, and anyone else who cares to add
their resources to the collective whole.

     The internet, by contrast, is a cold, barren place, populated by
anonymous geeks with no sense of community, stumbling around computers
they do not own, resources in whose management they have no say. No
one's responsible. Everyone's vulnerable. And they're squandering a
fortune.

     This - fidonet - is personal. As in 'personal computer'? We each
control our own small part of it. We built it. It's ours. Fidonet has
earned and deserves a place in the future of the networked world.

     Speaking as one bbs obsessive to another, I urge you to promote it
with the zeal of a Jehovah's Witness. Please don't give up.

Nodelist Size For a Different Reason

By Clay Tinsley, 1:124/5125
Nodelist Size For a Different Reason

Is Fidonet shrinking?  Have we finally maxed out?  With all the online
services and exponential growth of the Internet, it wouldn't surprise me.

I've been in the nodelist since September 1988.  When I joined, there were
about 4,500 nodes in Fidonet.  Now, according to the current nodelist,
there are almost 40,000, approaching a 10x growth in almost 8 years.

When you think about it, what will the average new computer user
interested in communications do with their new PC?  There are alot more
options these days.  Why would they want to set up a BBS when they can get
on the Internet and access thousands of computers easier than they can
through Fidonet?  I personally feel that the Internet is taking away our
newbies.

Below is a simple chart showing nodelist size since the beginnings of
Fidonet.  "NL8411" means "Fidonet Nodelist for a week in November 1984",
while "NL9603" means the same for a week in March 1996.  I've saved
various nodelists throughout Fidonet history for reference, hence the
skips in the dates.  The column of numbers is the size of the PkZip'ed
nodelist in bytes.  All are zipped with v2.04.  The bar chart is a
graphical representation of the PkZip'ed files:

 NL8411    4596
 NL8501    5757
 NL8610   37426 =
 NL8707   59420 ==
 NL8710   70014 ===
 NL8712   82382 ====
 NL8802   94654 ====
 NL8811  135601 ======
 NL8901  160465 ========
 NL8905  160402 ========
 NL9001  196178 =========
 NL9005  234354 ===========
 NL9112  409959 ====================
 NL9212  595536 =============================
 NL9305  680494 ==================================

 NL9601 1051545 ====================================================
 NL9603 1060399 ====================================================

As you can see, growth has decreased rapidly since early 1995.  That's
been over a year, and now we're showing little to no growth.  My guess is
that Fidonet will experience slow growth over the summer, but who knows
after that.

I encourage everyone to help promote Fidonet by encouraging new members.
Take your best regular BBS users and suggest that they join.  Think about
why you joined, and propose the same to others.

HTML pages in FidoNet
From Simon Richter (2:2480/604.12)

In my opinion, FidoNet should adopt the HTML standard, but do a few
 changes to it:

 Graphics: Instead of sending the pictures together with the mail
  (which would be too expensive here in Germany, as we pay for local
  calls), we could insert some file request kludge. Whoever wants to
  see the picture, may double-click on it, and it would be put into
  some *.REQ file and downloaded from the writer's bossnode or next
  uplink supporting file requests.

 Hyperlinks: We could introduce some new link types by simply putting
  a 'FTN-' in front or the like:

   - 'ftn-html' points to another message (e.g. "<As Mr. Smith told
       before>...")
   - 'ftn-ftp' A simple file request.
   - 'ftn-telnet' Find out the phone number and call it using a simple
       terminal program (e.g. "Have you seen my <BBS> yet?")
   - 'ftn-news' order an area
   - 'ftn-mailto' post an answer via netmail ("Reach Amiga Tech. at:
       <Amiga Technologies, Gilles Bourdin, 1:2345/678.90>)

 Advantages:    - Graphics support
                - Easy Smith&Wesson (point and click) interface for
                   file requests
                - Message linkage

 Disadvantages: - New software had to be written
                - New software had to be used, too...

I'd like to get some comments about this (suggestions, flames, any-
 thing... :) )

Free Listings in the Encyclopedia of Associations

by Nigel Allen (1:250/438) ndallen@io.org
Free Listings in the Encyclopedia of Associations

People who start new new non-profit associations (including
othernets, lobbying groups and associations having nothing to do
with BBSes) should get their group listed, free of charge, in
the Encyclopedia of Associations, so that prospective members,
journalists and researchers can get in touch with them.

Groups based in the U.S. should write to the following address
and ask to be listed:
 Editor
 Encyclopedia of Associations
 Gale Research Inc.
 835 Penobscot Building
 Detroit, MI 48226-4094
 Telephone (313) 961-2242
 Fax (313) 961-6815

Groups based outside the United States should instead get listed
in International Organizations, a directory published by the same
company. Its address is:
 Editor
 International Organizations
 Gale Research Inc.
 835 Penobscot Building
 Detroit, MI 48226-4094
 U.S.A.
 Telephone +1 313 961-2242
 Fax +1 313 961-6815

As well, groups based outside the United States may also want to
get listed in single-country association directories published
in their own country, such as the Directory of Associations in
Canada. Any librarian should be able to tell you how to get in
touch with your country's national association directory, if
one exists.

Most large libraries have a copy of the Encyclopedia of
Associations in hard copy or CD-ROM, but it is probably too
expensive for someone to buy for home use.

alt.bighub.org FidoNet/Inet gateway
From: Wes Mills (1:124/2342)

I've started up my own gateway, and thought people would like to know
about it.  We will be registering our own domain (probably something
like fido.org) so that you don't have to use annoying UUCP addressing.
-----

FidoNet<->Internet Gateway at 1:124/2342.999 and alt.bighub.org
----------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Fidonet-Internet gateway run by Wes Mills!
We offer FidoNet and Internet members the opportunity to transfer
mail between these two networks.

Table of Contents:
1) Rules of the gateway
2) How to use the gateway
3) Top 10 ways to get banned
4) Contact information
5) SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS GATEWAY

---------------

1) Rules of the gateway

By learning from the mistakes and mishaps of the former default gateway,
we have put in this set of rules:

        1) DO NOT, FOR ANY REASON, AT ANY TIME ATTEMPT TO BYPASS THE
           BANNED ADDRESSES ON THIS GATEWAY.
        2) Subscribing to any mailing lists is prohibited.
        3) Exchanging of files is prohibited.
        4) No mail is private.
        5) Mail to *.z*.fidonet.org will be bounced.
        6) Please report any problems you experience.

2) How to use the gateway

You may address e-mail from the Internet in two different ways:

STANDARD:
   <name>%p##.f####.n###.z#@alt.bighub.org

FEWER KEYS METHOD:
   <name>%z-nnn-ffff-p@alt.bighub.org

Examples:
  STANDARD:
    wes.mills%p4.f2342.n124.z1@alt.bighub.org
  FEWER KEYS:
    wes.mills%1-124-2342-4@alt.bighub.org

For sending from Fidonet to the Internet:
FidoNews 13-10                 Page: 10                    04 Mar 1996


Use their regular e-mail address, but, for the node number, put
1:124/2342.999

3) Top 10 ways to get banned

        10) Subscribing to any mailing lists.
         9) Trading any files (any encoding method).
         8) Assuming mail is private and treating it that way.
         7) Being a pissy *C and screwing with the routing.
         6) Attempting to overload our pretty overloaded system.
         5) Moving massive amounts of unnecessary mail.
         4) Attempting to mis-direct other people's mail.
         3) Forging messages.
         2) Distributing illegal material.

         AND, THE #1 WAY TO GET BANNED:

         1) ANNOYING THE POSTMASTERS.

4) Contact Information

E-Mail for the FidoNet->Internet:
   gary.butters%1-124-2342@alt.bighub.org
   gary butters @ 1:124/2342

E-Mail for the Internet->FidoNet:

5) Special Information about this Gateway
The gateway will go offline at 00:00, February 24, 1996, so that we can
switch to a 128k ISDN for routing mail, and to set up the new DNS
system.  We will announce the new addressing scheme ASAP so that
users can start using it.

DEATH KNOLL FOR FIDONET?
Damian Stamm
1:273/406

Long day. It's about 12:15 am and I've got to be at Temple by
8:30. Plus an hour to get there via train.

Not much sleep tonight. But I stay up because I want to post in
the Fidonet bases that I carry, and to read the Fidonews that I
received yesterday.

FidoNews 13-10                 Page: 11                    04 Mar 1996

Over the years I've read passages about one sysop against
another sysop who has been excommunicated by some power-grabbing
NC to someone posting a message in Fidonews under the name of
Steve Winter when Steve never actually wrote it.

But I found it disturbing when the majority of the messages plus
the editorial faced on the death of Fidonet. I've virtually
been through it all in Fidonet. I've been suspended from
conferences, formed my own, created a competing echo before the
echo went on the backbone, filed P.C.'s, written in Fidonews,
posted in Z1* echoes, and dealt with a suspended user taking
advantage of his sysop's absense to continue to rant in an echo
I moderate.

Now, I've seen the death of one net and am seeing the death of
another net I'm involved with now, but all along I always knew I
had Fidonet there so that I could continue to write and enjoy
the opinions of others.

The final article had a point to it when he talked about what
trash P4 is. The fact is - we are in Fidonet for a hobby - for
fun. But when people get to power who ruin it for others, then
it is no longer fun.  I know since I had to hobby under the
reign of an RC who had the popularity of Castro and support of
Steve Forbes.  Still, he felt it his "duty" to cause chaos in
nets all over the region.

But then I heard about a new policy is being formed. But alas,
it's not even going to be called Policy 5. The changes are so
insignificant (the only change is border rules) that it's gone
from Policy 4.07 to 4.08.

There was also talk about how technology was going to catch up
to Fidonet as well.

While we may not be able to stop the internet from taking over
what Fidonet produces for us now, we can take care of many
squabbles over who is in what position, and at least make the
net worthwhile while it is here.

In my last message in Fidonews I called for making mandatory
elections for *C positions. While I was probably a little too
harsh on Bob Satti, I still awe at how the so-called heirarchy
claims how they so support elections made at net levels, etc.,
while at the same time balking at the idea of making it a part
of a new policy - Policy 5.

However, the facts are the facts. This issue has been going on
for years, and Bob Satti has never once shown his face anywhere.
The only way I know he exists is he sent me a netmail once.
That's it.  He has never responded to anything in Fidonews,
never written anything in it as long as I have been reading in
it, particularly on this subject. What he is scared of, I don't
know. Well, since he appoints the RC's and the RC's appoint
him, why the need to risk loss of being called yourself the King

of Fidonet when all you have to do is stay quiet and let the
status-quo continue, irregardless of what it does for the net?

We can talk all we want about old guards and new guards and
power grabbing moderators and the like, but the fact is nothing
will change as long as a few elitists run the net on their
whims. Who are the *C's responsible to? Not the sysops, that's
for sure.  And until elections are made legitimate and the net
is run by the sysops - not by elists - the fidonet nodelist will
get smaller and smaller - no matter how many flags they put in
it.
