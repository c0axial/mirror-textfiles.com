                    Sysops Majorly Against Rough Treatment
                                  Doug Myers

     Admittedly, my recent nomination as the Overlord of the ElfLords
     went to my head for a while, but I've been knocked down a peg or two
     since then.  I called upon my illusory powers to form a new
     alliance, the Association of Sympathetic Sysops - an elite group to
     embrace those delicate users of Fido who are easily offended.  I
     called upon the sysops to create a womb of understanding in which
     the sensitive could nurture protected from the bullies of Fidonet.

     But response to my registration drive has been light.  Perhaps
     sysops know that bringing these senistive souls into Fido is going
     to be tough... or perhaps my personal magnetism became degaussed.
     For whatever reason, sysops have largely ignored my plea for them to
     step forward and make an  A.S.S.  of themselves.

     Undaunted, I am pressing forward with yet another association to
     assist the first.  Only this time, we're not going to fool around
     with sensitivity training or sissy concepts like a protective womb.
     Sysops Majorly Against Rough Treatment will focus instead on
     practical advice to emerging sensitive individuals.

     I'm happy to report that this combination of groups seems to be
     well-received, and I think I can safely predict that sensitive
     individuals such as "The Hunter" can present their problems and be
     assured of a prompt  S.M.A.R.T. - A.S.S.  reply.

                                New Principles
                   Email from Luke.Kolin@connect.xerox.com


     I would like to comment on David Smith's recent article regarding
     first principles of Fidonet. The Internet vs. Fidonet debate has
     been going on in my memory since approximately 1994, and I think a
     few things have changed over the years that deserve addressing.

     I should begin by bidding adieu to the sentiment I often saw at the
     beginning that the Internet was 'just a passing fad' - that the
     whole thing would crash under the weight of spam and BBS systems
     would enjoy a new renaissance. I don't shed too many tears for its
     passing, since each day when I hook up to the Internet it never
     ceases to amaze me the sheer volume of useful content I can access
     quickly (far faster than calling a BBS or freq) and with zero
     marginal cost.

     I think that David misses some of the point when he addressed the
     lack of useful interactive content on the Web, and characterises it
     as "whatever a machine can provide out of it's [sic] canned
     responses & stored files." I respectfully disagree. There is
     valuable interactive content on the Internet - it just takes some
     FIDONEWS 17-09               Page 4                   28 Feb 2000


     searching. For example, I am a regular participant in Joe Grasmick's
     US immigration web site form (www.grasmick.com) which is a very
     valuable resource for Canadians working and living in the United
     States. I ocasionally participate on a Toyota MR2 owners' web site
     forum that continually provides me with excellent content.

     I will readily concede that it has taken a fair amount of time to
     reach this point - and part of the battle has been in the creation
     of effective discussion applications on the Web that facilitate
     search, browsing and easy reading. We are reaching that point today.
     What has amazed me all these years is that FidoNet has never changed
     the fundamental technology upon which it operates. I don't think for
     a second that that a text-based dial-up technology is superior to a
     GUI display that, thanks to high-speed lines, allows thousands of
     users to connect to a site at once.

     From a content provider's point of view, the greatest aspect of the
     Internet has been eliminating the necessity of worrying about
     infrastructure and allowing one to concentrate on content. I don't
     need to have multiple modems and phone lines - if I host on an ISP
     or other hosting service, I don't even need to own a computer. If we
     consistently suggest that FidoNet's greatest value is its content,
     why don't we take the principles that worked so well for FidoNet and
     implement a Web-based solution that will achieve the same end? Lord
     knows it wasn't FTS-0001 and ZMH that got FidoNet where it was in
     its heyday.

     Cheers!

     for the youth and homage for the old.

      Prof. of English:
     A kiss is a noun that is used as a conjunction;
     it is more common than proper; it is spoken
     in the plural and it is applicable to all.

     Uh, What? I'm not familiar with that term. <chuckle>

     A Letter from Fidonet Management

     It has been brought to management's attention that some individuals
     throughout Fidonet have been using foul language during the course
     of normal conversation in echomail.  Due to complaints received from
     the one person who may be easily offended, this type of language
     will be no longer be tolerated. We do however, realize the critical
     importance of being able to accurately express your feelings when
     communicating with others.

     Therefore, a list of "TRY SAYING" new phrases has been provided so
     that proper exchange of ideas and information can continue in an
     effective manner without risk of offending this one sensitive
     person.

       TRY SAYING:
       Perhaps I can help you with that.
       INSTEAD OF:
       And when the f*ck do you expect me find an answer for that?

       TRY SAYING:
       I'm certain that isn't feasible.
       INSTEAD OF:
       No f*cking way.

       TRY SAYING:
       Really?
       INSTEAD OF:
       You've got to be shitting me!

       TRY SAYING:
       Perhaps you should check with...
       INSTEAD OF:
       Tell someone who gives a shit.

       TRY SAYING:
       Of course I'm concerned.
       INSTEAD OF:
       Ask me if I give a shit.

       TRY SAYING:
       I wasn't involved in the project.
       INSTEAD OF:
       It's not my f*cking problem.

       TRY SAYING:
       That's interesting.
        INSTEAD OF:
        What the f*ck?

       TRY SAYING:
       I'm not sure this can be implemented.

       This shit won't work.

       TRY SAYING:
       I'll try to schedule that.
       INSTEAD OF:
       Why the hell didn't you tell me sooner?

       TRY SAYING:
       Are you sure this is a problem?
       INSTEAD OF:
       Who the hell cares?

       TRY SAYING:
       He's not familiar with the issues.
       INSTEAD OF:
       He's got his head up his ass.

       Eat shit and die.

       TRY SAYING:
       So you weren't happy with it?
       INSTEAD OF:
       Kiss my ass.

       TRY SAYING:

       Blow me.

       TRY SAYING:
       I don't think this will be a problem.
       INSTEAD OF:
       I really don't give a shit.

       TRY SAYING:
       He's somewhat insensitive.
       INSTEAD OF:
       He's a prick.

       TRY SAYING:
       She's an aggressive go-getter.
       INSTEAD OF:
       She's a ball-busting bitch.

       TRY SAYING:
       I think you could use more training.
       INSTEAD OF:
       You don't know what the f*ck you're doing.

       Thank You,

     What: Net282
     Where: http://www.rxn.com/~net282/

     The meat of it.

     Net 282 is a FidoNet sub-net covering the extended metropolitan area
     of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. The Twin Cities are
     located in east-central Minnesota. (taken from the page)

     This is a long page. It starts with a map of the U.S.A. on which the
     FIDONEWS 17-09               Page 9                   28 Feb 2000


     location of Net282 is circled. Other than the WebRing banner at the
     bottom, this is the only graphic on the page.

     Now... you might be saying "No graphics!?!"... but wait. This page
     is rich in access to historical documents on Fidonet as well as
     current information. From the bottom of the map to the top of the
     WebRing banner, it is filled with links with subjects such as "Find
     out how to join Net 282!" as well as "Link to Net 282 Member's Home
     Pages " and more. Under this section are links to Fidonet related
     sites, Fidonet Policy documents (both present and past), technical
     standards, Fidonews, the Nodelist, Fidonet history and more.

     I haven't checked every link, but I will tell you that I intend to
     visit and read and/or capture a lot of the information on this page.
     If you're looking for a wealth of information on Fidonet, check this
     page out. Even if you aren't, check it out anyway... You just might
     learn something. :-)

     Till Next week, regards,

      Frank
