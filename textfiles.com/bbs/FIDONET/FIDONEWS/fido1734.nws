                             Policy Ratification
                                  Doug Myers

     Regular readers of the FN_SYSOP echo can attest to the fact that the
     biggest non-event shaping up in Fidonet this year is any type of
     action relating to Policy.

     In one thread, David Moufarrege's proposed Policy revision was cited
     as current policy, though the author was quickly informed that the
     "new" policy was, indeed, a proposal.  However, in that discussion,
     Ward Dossche, the Zone 2 Coordinator, revealed that he hadn't
     previously seen the proposal nor had he seen the debate in the Zone
     1 echoes.  Since any policy change would require a majority vote of
     ALL Regional Coordinators... and since the issue doesn't even seem
     to be rambling about outside Zone 1... and since the discussion in
     Zone 1 on that particular version has already died... don't expect a
     Policy revision any time soon.

     In another thread, the question of whether the International
     Coordinator must be a sitting Zone Coordinator is argued.  One
     section of Policy states that the International Coordinator is the
     "First among equals" among the Zone Coordinators, while another
     section of Policy states that Coordinators at any level should
     minimize the number of hats worn.  So we seem to have one
     implication that the IC should be a sitting ZC, but another
     implication that the IC should resign as ZC upon his selection.
     Given that the call for a new IC earlier this year couldn't even
     draw a response from all the ZC's (let alone the IC), don't expect
     either a change of IC's soon, nor a resolution of P4's apparent
     conflict on the question of whether an IC must be a sitting ZC.

     And yet another thread rages, centered on Darrell Salter's
     longstanding assertion that Policy 4 is not legitimate because it
     was never ratified by the Sysops of Fidonet.  The solution to this
     would be obvious, it might seem:  put the question to the Sysops and
     see what they say.  However, two complications arise...
     1.  Darrell isn't interested in putting the question forward since
     he's chosen to simply ignore policy.
     2.  Those who disagree with him aren't interested in putting the
     question forward since Policy 4 itself says it isn't necessary...
     ratification is clearly placed in the hands of the Regional
     Coordinators.

     If Policy is defined as that document that proclaims itself to be
     FIDONEWS 17-34               Page 2                   21 Aug 2000


     Policy (P4), then don't expect any action soon.

     If, however, Policy is defined as that which is actually practiced
     rather than that which is documented... then the policy seems to be
     one of no particular action.  Same result :)

     The plane's cabin was being served by an obviously gay flight
     attendant who was just as obviously enjoying himself. He came
     swishing down the aisle and announced to the passengers, "Captain
     Marvey has asked me to announce that he'll be landing this big,
     scary plane shortly, lovely people, so if you could just put up your
     trays, that would be super."

     On his trip back up the aisle, he noticed that a woman hadn't moved
     a muscle. "Perhaps you didn't hear me over those big brute engines.
     I asked you to raise your trazy-poo so the main man can pitty-pat us
     on the ground."

     She calmly turned her head and said, "In my country, I am called a
     princess. I take orders from no one".

     The flight attendant replied, without missing a beat, "Well,
     sweet-cheeks, in my country, I'm called a queen, so I outrank you.
     Put the tray up, bitch!"

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
