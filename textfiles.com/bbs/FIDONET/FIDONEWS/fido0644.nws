     =================================================================


     Please, when submitting copyrighted material, give me some way of
     determining that the material may in fact be used in FidoNews.  I
     won't knowingly publish such material without these assurances.

     Thanks for  the  responses to last week's call for help.  I'll be
     contacting some of you shortly.  It looks like there will need to
     be a group rather  than  one  individual, but at least I can shed
     the load. That's all I was looking to do.

     This week the rules are being  published for the IFNA referendum.
     Please take some of your valuable time,  read the rules, consider
     the alternatives, and vote.

     As  always, thanks for reading this thing.  And thanks  for  your
     submissions!

                           The FIDONet <r> Bible

     As an individual, interested in knowing about and spreading
     some of the history of FidoNet, I am going to write a
     "Bible".  It's form will take after a lot of the Roman Catholic
     Bible, but will not contain any thing from "God".

     Things that will be considered are:

        o Net-Policies.   They will be given names such as
          "A Letter from FidoNet to Net-XXXX".
        o Anecdotes  <not antidotes...[grin!]>
        o the growth of FidoNet.
        o History Documents *
        o and just about anything else.

     (*) History Documents _MAY_ be rejected.  Already included
         in the "Bible" is Policy 4.06.

     Within ONE (1) week after you make your submission you will
     recieve NetMail declaring either your inclusion, or the
     rejection of your submission.  As I stated.  Most anything
     will be accepted.

     Please use  some degree of taste, as this will probably be
     distributed net-wide.  All persons who submit an entry will
     receive a copy on Jan. 1, 1990.  The Press-Date for the
     "Bible" is December 27, 1989.  File attaches will go out on
     the 29th and 30th of December, 1989, and the 1st of January,
     1990.
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

     Guidelines.

     Your file should be ready to be processed into the bible when
     we receive it.  This is how it should be formatted.

      o  The "book" should be written no longer than 40-columns
     across.  We think that we can fit more into the bible this
     way.

      o  If the submission is a real long file that you don't want
     to have to deal with changing formats, you may submit it as-is.

      o  There should be no left margins and no spaces between
     paragraphs.  However, if you were going to "block" something,
     you can do as follows.

     FidoNews 6-44                Page 3                   30 Oct 1989


         And so the reply came, "ISIS II
         is  NOT  FSC-0001   compatible.
         Therefore,  he will be  dropped
         from  the  Fido  Net nodelist."

      o  Avoid something in all-caps.  Exceptions are abbreviations.

      o  If your submission runs more than 40-characters wide, there
     should be a right margin of about 75.

      o  Please categorize your submission.  There will be three main
     sections.  The categories are

           o   .OLD    Old Testament  (History, etc ...   )
           o   .NEW    New Testament  (Current Events ... )
           o   .APL    Appocalypse    (Future Expectations)

     or you can make your own "Section" by naming the extension
     with your initials or name.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL if you do
     this.  If a certain Net-105 sysop with the initials 'RB'
     sent something in tonight, and a sysop from New York with
     the initials 'RB' sent something in, the result wouldn't
     be pretty <especially if they had the same file-name>.

     A copy will be sent to all those who send submissions, and you
     can "Order" one from a node to be announced, hopefully as "Bible"

     They will be ready on or about 01/01/1990.

     Send submissions to

     FidoNet Bible Editor
     at 1:105/377.0

     All are encouraged to participate!

     ANNOUNCING MACINTOSH ALTERNATIVE CONNECTIONS LIST (MACLIST)

     We are pleased to announce that a new, MacIntosh oriented
     network has been formed.  Named the 'MacIntosh Alternative
     Connection List', MACLIST has been located in the last
     remaining single-digit Zone address, Zone 6.

     The current MACLIST nodelist is available to all interested.
     Just file request 'MACLIST.ARC' from 1:107/554 or 1:269/102
     (FidoNet), 7:520/554 (AlterNet) or 99:9220/201 (EggNet) or
     any closer system to you that might carry it.  The first
     MACLIST nodelist was delivered to initial members on Day 300
     (Friday, October 27, 1989).

     Why form MACLIST?  There are several reasons we decided to
     form the MacIntosh Alternative Connection List.  Here are
     some that inspired us to form MACLIST:

       o  The MacIntosh is rapidly entering the world of computer
          networking.  MacIntoshes are located in many different
          networks, but how to find them?  The MACLIST nodelist
          is a centralized source for you to communicate with
          other MacIntoshes - simply compile the MACLIST nodelist!

       o  The MacIntosh community has many unique aspects.  The
          MACLIST is a network for Mac sysops, and their users,
          to join together and address MacIntosh issues that
          affect us all, examine the technology, discuss topics
          and disseminate information of interest to the
          MacIntosh community.

       o  Need a MacIntosh echo connection?  Files?  Looking for
          'Mac compatibility' (SEAlink transfer protocols and
          WaZOO FREQs)?  Check MACLIST for a system near you ...
          the MacIntosh Alternative Connection, an independent
          network on the move.

     If you are running a MacIntosh system, or a system dedicated
     to MacIntosh users (the MACLIST is not necessarily composed
     100% of systems that are physically running on MacIntoshes,
     but a member must have a system dedicated/oriented to the
     MacIntosh user), and are interested in joining the MACLIST,
     please contact one of us at our addresses listed below!

     It is our goal to generate a constructive discussion of this
     network with the MacIntosh community in the MACSYSOP echo.
     If you are interested in MACLIST, you might want to get a
     MACSYSOP feed to keep in touch with developments; if you
     need a feed, please contact one of us below and we'll locate
     a source.  MACSYSOP is not 'on the Fidonet backbone'.  You
     do not have to carry MACSYSOP to be a member in MACLIST.

     Here are our answers to some of the questions we have been
     receiving:

     Q: Why have you choosen Zone 6 for MACLIST?
     A: The Tabby mailer for the MacIntosh does not have the
        capability to use two-digit zone addresses.  We therefore
        do not have a choice in Zone selection.  Zone 6 is the
        last remaining unoccupied single-digit Zone address, and
        we do not wish to intrude on another network's Zone or
        encounter the technical problems associated with a
        'shared Zone'.  It is our hope that 'Other Nets' will
        respect our position and recognize why MACLIST is
        occupying Zone 6.

     Q: What do I have to do to become a member of MACLIST?
     A: Run a BBS/system that caters to the MacIntosh community
        and is accessable via some form of mailer that is FTSC
        compatible. It does NOT matter what hardware or software
        you use as long as you support the Mac.  Just send a
        message to one of us at the addresses listed below.

     Q: Is membership in MACLIST free?
     A: Yes.

     Q: If I do not join MACLIST will it be hard for me to get
        some Mac echoes?
     A: MACLIST does not have any echoes based in it. In other
        words NOT being a member of MACLIST will NEVER stop you
        from getting an echo.  We believe that the MACLIST will
        actually ASSIST you in finding systems that carry any or
        all of the 29 currently existing MacIntosh echos.

     Q: Will I have to use my MACLIST node number?
     A: MACLIST is NOT a 'replacement' for other networks. You
        do not have to use your MACLIST node number as a primary
        node address. It does not have to even appear in your
        origin line.  The minimal requirement is to make it an
        AKA on your system (to avoid duplicates and such).

     Q: Will joining this network cause problems for me in any
        other networks?
     A: It should not, as there have been software and hardware
        specific Networks for a long time with no problem, with
        participants in multiple networks.  DOS-based boards
        have been using nets like this all along (for example,
        PNET, QNET, RBBS-Net).  Each is means of communication
        and support for a particular interest group, just as
        MACLIST is oriented to the MacIntosh community.

     Q: Why are you using the MACSYSOP echo to communicate rather
        then the MUGADMIN echo?
     A: To communicate in matters concerning MACLIST we have
     FidoNews 6-44                Page 6                   30 Oct 1989


        chosen to use the MACSYSOP Echo.  We are using this echo
        rather then MUGADMIN because the MACSYSOP echo is not a
        Fidonet, Alternet (or any other net) echo and it is not
        carried on the backbone.  Carrying the MACSYSOP echo is
        not a requirement of MACLIST membership, although it is
        encouraged.

     Looking forward to bringing the MacIntosh community
     together,

                           MIDRANGE SYSTEMS ECHO

     I am in the process of forming a new echo for professional
     computer users.  It will be similar in concept to the MAINFRAME
     echo, but will be for IBM System/34, 36, 38, and AS/400 mini-
     computer users (also known as MIDRANGE computers).  The area tag
     will be (obviously) MIDRANGE.

     Midrange Systems have become a major part of IBM's plan for the
     future, and I feel that many of our users would find an echo
     dedicated to these system usefull.  Topics currently being
     discussed include SAA, communications, CASE, and programming.

     If you would be interested in carrying this echo, please contact
     me.  I can be reached at 1:115/439 or on my system, The Midrange
     System BBS, at 312-439-9679 (708-439-9679 after November 11th).

     Hurricane Hugo plus one month...
     --------------------------------

     I would like to take time to personally thank each and every one
     of the people that contributed to my "Relief Fund", but it will
     be a while before I have time to sit down and actually write you
     each a personal note.  As of today, I still don't have a road
     cut to my homesite (we'll take care of that November 4th with a
     bulldozer, tractor, bushhog and about three dozen crazed people
     armed with chainsaws <grin>...)...  Things are still a mess here
     except on the major urban streets - they wanted to get tourists
     back in town to help with the confusion!  Most people (90%) have
     power now, and most of the phones seem to work reliably, but the
     trees are still stacked 8' deep along every street and highway.

     I have tried to keep my stuff together enough to keep accurate
     records of who sent what, but I managed to lose one of my cheat
     sheets, so I have two people that contributed that I don't have
     a first name or net/node number for - the last names are:  Luca
     and Garcia.  If there is anyone else that is not on either list
     below, please accept my sincere apologies for idiocy - I really
     am doing the best I can!  I also have a set of contributions of
     $210 that I have no names at all written down for - those came
     in around October 5th (three people that aren't getting "credit"
     please send me a nastygram via netmail and I'll post the proper
     names soon - I'm *very* sorry this happened - that was one of
     the more "fun" days - when I went through the Federal Emergency
     Management Agency - and Senator Hollings was right - they're the
     biggest bunch of bureaucratic jackasses that anyone has ever had
     to deal with!)  I still haven't seen a cent from good ol' Uncle
     Sam, and I'm not even able to file my SBA emergency loan package
     since the IRS hasn't sent me copies of my last three years tax
     returns (and they guaranteed three-day turnaround <grin>...).


     Mike Ratledge Fund - Hurricane Hugo Relief

     There are two lists - one was maintained by Ed Meloan of 360/1
     who took care of the early contributions when it wasn't clear
     exactly what/where/how I was doing - here's his (slightly more
     accurate) list:

     ----------

     Here are the folks who have contributed, through Augusta Forum,
     to help Mike Ratledge who lost his home and all belongings in
     Hurricane Hugo.  This list represents mail received at Augusta
     Forum through 10/22/89.

     Since it is now possible to send contributions to Mike direct,
     this will be the last report I will issue.  Any checks that are
     received here, after this report, will be mailed down to Mike
     and he will acknowledge them.  My thanks to all those on this
     list.  Your help was appreciated!

     Guys - I can't tell you how much this has helped me during this
     "trial by wind" here!  I've kept up my bills, bought a minimal
     stereo so I don't go nuts (35+ compact disks we found are the
     only useful thing we found period - they all worked but one!),
     taken the wife to a couple nice dinners, etc, etc.  I will be
     using the rest of the $$ to help defray unknown expenses as I
     pull myself back together over the next six to eight months and
     rebuild.  Hopefully, by the time I'm back in my new house, I'll
     have received a little money from the SBA at 4% to buy myself a
     new 'puter, rebuild the dock (not insurable), do a little land-
     scaping, etc. - I'm sure beginning to wonder!?!  I know I will
     insure my personal property a little better next time!


     THANKS AGAIN!!!

                              Election Rules
                          IFNA/FidoNet Referendum


     1.  What we're voting on.

     The International FidoNet Association Board of Directors, at the
     1989 annual meeting at FidoCon in San Jose, passed a resolution
     which calls for a vote to be conducted throughout the entire
     FidoNet network to decide the future of IFNA.  The text of this
     resolution is as follows:

       We, the representatives of the International FidoNet
       Association, have heard a cry for democracy in the
       administration of the network.  As IFNA is supposed to
       represent the interests of the sysops, and as such
       representation is deemed to have failed, be it hereby
       resolved that:

       Without a mandate from the sysops of FidoNet, IFNA has no
       purpose or reason for existence.

       THEREFORE, the board proposes the following action, of which
       failure to pass will mean the dissolution of IFNA:

          It is hereby resolved that a special election be held
          for consideration by the Sysops of FidoNet of the
          following:

          IFNA shall be empowered to re-draft the bylaws of IFNA
          and to draft a Policy document for FidoNet.  Such
          documents are to include:

            1.  An independent judicial system.

            2.  A reduced size Board of Directors, to be
            completely reseated in an election on or before
            FidoCon 1990.

            3.  Better representation from outside the United
            States.

            4.  Make each sysop in FidoNet a member in IFNA
            with all rights and privileges of membership.

       Voting for referendum of this document shall be completed on
       or before December 1, 1989.  The rules of the election shall
       make it clear that failure of the election to approve the
       questions presented shall result in the current Board of
       Directors acting under Article XII to dissolve the
       corporation.

     FidoNews 6-44                Page 12                  30 Oct 1989


       In addition, it shall be made clear that approval must be
       gained from a majority of the eligible nodes in the nodelist
       in effect at the time of the election.

     (End of resolution.)


     2.0  Eligibility.

     The sysop of each public-access node in the FidoNet nodelist
     issued on October 27 (NODELIST.300) is eligible to vote.


     2.1  Definition of "public access".

     The IFNA by-laws define "public access" as "A system that has a
     telephone number published in the FIDONET NODELIST, and in
     addition provides services to the public."

     For the purposes of this vote, a system will be considered
     "public access" if it (1) is listed in the nodelist (see section
     2.3) without a status of "Pvt", "Hold", or "Down" AND (2) has a
     unique telephone number.  This specifically includes MO [mail
     only] systems.

     In cases where multiple systems are listed using the same
     telephone number, only the sysop of the "primary system" is
     entitled to a vote.  The "primary system" is determined by the
     address by which the system identifies itself during Zone Mail
     Hour.


     2.2  Definition of "sysop".

     Each person receives only one vote, regardless of how many
     systems he or she runs, and what names are used in the nodelist.
     For example, Steve Bonine runs two separate FidoNet systems,
     115/444 and 115/777, with slightly different sysop names, but
     this entitles Steve Bonine to only one vote.

     Network Coordinators (Regional Coordinators for independent
     nodes) will, to the best of their ability, enforce the one-
     person-one-vote rule.  These are the individuals at the best
     level to know the sysops.


     2.3  Definition of "nodelist".

     For purposes of determining eligibility, the nodelist segment
     from the zone where the node resides will be used.  In other
     words, NODELIST.300 as it exists in zone 1 is used to determine
     whether a given sysop in zone 1 is eligible; NODELIST.300 as it
     exists in zone 2 is used to determine eligibility for a zone-2
     sysop, and so on.  This negates any effects of non-
     synchronization of nodelists for that particular edition.

     FidoNews 6-44                Page 13                  30 Oct 1989


     2.4  Definition of "sysop".

     Only the sysop listed in the nodelist is eligible to vote.  No
     co-sysops or point sysops associated with the system may vote.
     The voting right is not transferable; the person listed in the
     nodelist may vote but may not transfer the right to another
     person.


     3.0  Voting procedure.


     3.1  Ballot

     The official ballot (see section 7) was published in the nodelist
     difference file (and thus will appear in the nodelist) for
     NODELIST.300.  The ballot, resolution, and voting rules are in
     the October 30 FidoNews (FNEWS644.ARC).


     3.1  Collection of votes.

     Network Coordinators will collect votes from their nets.
     Regional Coordinators will collect votes from independent nodes
     in their region.  Sysops vote by sending netmail to their Network
     Coordinator (independents to the Regional Coordinator) with a
     CLEAR INDICATION of a vote of YES or NO, using the ballot
     published in the nodelist or a reasonable facsimile thereof.  The
     voter will also provide a password  (8 characters or less) to be
     used in a public list of votes.  See sections 3.4 and 7.0.


     3.2  Acknowledgement of votes.

     The coordinator will acknowledge the votes received using
     netmail.  Network Coordinators will handle this netmail in the
     same manner as if it had been received as normal host-routed
     mail, that is, if the sysop normally polls to pick up host-routed
     mail then that is how it will be delivered.  Regional
     Coordinators will send an acknowledgement to independents unless
     prior arrangements are already in place for the independent to
     poll the Regional Coordinator (for example, an arrangement to
     pick up the NodeDiff).

     Any sysop who votes and does not receive an acknowledgement
     within 48 hours should follow up with the coordinator to be sure
     that the vote was not lost.  (Note:  Coordinators take vacations,
     usually with the knowledge of the systems in the local net.  This
     may explain a delay in acknowledgement.)


     FidoNews 6-44                Page 14                  30 Oct 1989


     3.3  Responsibility of coordinators.

     The responsibility of the coordinator structure is to conduct the
     election.  Coordinators answer questions on voting procedure, but
     are not authorized to speak for IFNA on policy questions.
     Coordinators are free to state their opinion, but may not
     pressure the sysop to vote in a particular way (YES or NO).

     Coordinators have a responsibility to inform the nodes in their
     net (or independents) of the election.  In fact, this is an
     excellent opportunity to make sure that all nodes in the net (or
     independents) are still capable of receiving netmail.  However,
     voting cannot be imposed as a condition of being in FidoNet.  If
     an individual prefers not to vote, that is their right.


     3.4  Public posting of votes.

     At the end of the voting period, each coordinator is to make
     available the results of the vote in their jurisdiction.  The
     normal method of doing this is to publish the information in a
     local echomail conference.  If no such local conference exists,
     the coordinator should include in the acknowledgement message for
     votes the method to obtain the results.

     In addition, the coordinator must respond to any netmail
     requesting the results.  Coordinators are encouraged to provide
     the information in a file-requestable file named VOTEnnnn.TXT
     where nnnn is the net or region number.

     The results to be posted are:

       (a)  A list, by node number, of who voted.

       (b)  A list, by password (see item 3.1) of the individual
     votes.

       (c)  A count of the number of eligible voters in the net, or
     for Regional Coordinator's a count of the number of eligible
     votes from regional independent nodes.


     3.5  Example

     Assume that there are ten nodes in net 115 who are eligible to
     vote.  Further assume that the Network Coordinator receives the
     following votes:

     Node           Sysop          Vote           Password
     115/123   Elmer Fudd          YES            ABC
     115/456   Donald Duck         NO             DEF
     115/789   Joe Smith           YES            GHI
     115/987   Sue Jones           NO             JKL
     115/654   Deputy Dawg         YES            MNO

     FidoNews 6-44                Page 15                  30 Oct 1989


     The Network Coordinator should post the following in the local
     sysop echo, and make it available a file named VOTE115.TXT:

     Total number of eligible sysops:  10
     The following nodes voted:  123, 456, 789, 987, 654
          ABC       YES
          DEF       NO
          GHI       YES
          JKL       NO
          MNO       YES       Results:  YES, 3
                                        NO,  2

     In the actual vote, the passwords would be more imaginative, and
     the results would not be posted in node-number order.

     If Tweety Bird (who did not vote) sees her node number listed in
     the list of voting nodes, she can point out the problem first to
     the Network Coordinator and then to 1:1/11 if necessary.  Similar
     action can be taken by any sysop whose vote was not recorded or
     was recorded incorrectly.


     4.0  Tabulation.

     Using the schedule in item 5, results will be reported up the
     coordinator structure.  The three items in section 3.4 will be
     reported.


     5.0  Schedule.

     October 27:  NODELIST.300 is published.  Coordinators begin
     accepting votes.

     December 1:  Polls close at midnight local time at the collection
     point.  NO LATE VOTES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

     December 4:  Coordinators post final vote detail (see sections
     3.4 and 3.5).

     Note:  Coordinators are encouraged to post weekly interim lists
     of which nodes have voted during the voting period, but should
     not post actual vote counts until the polls close.

     December 11:  Deadline for challenges.  Any questions based upon
     the public posting of votes must be received by the collection
     system no later December 11 at midnight local time.

     December 15:  Deadline for Network Coordinator's to report their
     totals to Regional Coordinator's.

     FidoNews 6-44                Page 16                  30 Oct 1989


     December 18:  Deadline for Regional Coordinator's to report their
     totals to ZC's.

     December 22:  Results published in NODELIST.356.


     6.0  Miscellaneous.


     6.1  Proxy for the Network Coordinator

     If for any reason the Network Coordinator is unable or unwilling
     to conduct the election, another individual may be assigned the
     responsibility by the Regional Coordinator, or the Regional
     Coordinator may collect the votes for the local net.


     6.2  Changing votes

     Changing votes is NOT ALLOWED.  Tabulating each vote once is
     enough work for the *C structure.


     6.3  Cheating

     An attempt by any individual to cast more than one vote will
     disqualify that individual from this election.


     6.4  Appeals

     The decision of the Network Coordinator or Regional Coordinator
     can be appealed to the IFNA Election and Nomination Committee by
     sending netmail to 1:1/11.  (Note:  No actual votes will be
     accepted by 1:1/11.)


     6.5  Irregularities and Difficulties

     Any problems with the voting process should be reported to 1:1/11
     as early in the voting process as possible, so that they can be
     addressed while the polls are still open.


     6.6  Determination of Number of Eligible Voters

     Due to the way the resolution is structured, the determination of
     how many eligible voters exist is as important as counting YES
     and NO votes.  Network Coordinators will report the number of
     potential votes in their net, and Regional Coordinators will do
     the same for their regional independents.  In the case of no
     report being received from a Network Coordinator, the number of
     eligible voters for that net will be calculated by multiplying
     the number of public-access (not Pvt, Hold, or Down) nodes in
     that nodelist segment by the ratio for nets which did report.
     For example, if there are 3000 eligible nodes reported, and that
     FidoNews 6-44                Page 17                  30 Oct 1989


     represents 4000 nodes in the nodelist, a .75 ratio will be used.
     If a net containing 20 nodes failed to report, the number of
     eligible voters would be increased by 15 (20 times .75).  This
     calculation will be performed by the IFNA Nominations and
     Elections committee; Regional Coordinators should simply report
     the data received (or lack thereof) to their Zone Coordinator.


     6.6  Reporting of Net-wide Vote

     A list will be published in FidoNews in this format, repeated for
     each zone:

                                  YES  NO    ELIGIBLE
     Zone 1
       Region 10
         Regional independents    xxx  xxx    xxx
         Net 102                  xxx  xxx    xxx
         Net 103                  xxx  xxx    xxx
         ...                      ---  ---    ---
       Subtotal for region 10     xxx  xxx    xxx
       ...
     Subtotal for zone 1          xxx  xxx    xxx


     7.0  Sample Ballot

     My vote on the IFNA resolution published via NODEDIFF.300 is:

                 _____ YES            _____ NO

     Post this vote using the following password:  _______________

                        **** IMPORTANT NOTICE ****

     As of Midnight (MST) on November 4, 1989, the msged echo is
     changing it's name.  Due to a problem with Qmail, the msged and
     smut echoes are being crosslinked in a number of places.  In
     order to eliminate this problem, on the 4th of November, the
     msged echo's areatag will change from MSGED to MSGED_ECHO.  This
     should alleviate the problem.  This notice is also being posted
     in the REC conferences and in the msged echo.  If you receive the
     msged echo or pass it to anyone else, please be sure to make the
     necessary changes on November 4.  Thank you all very much.
