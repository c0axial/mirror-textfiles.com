======================================================================


It is surprisingly quiet this week. Absolutely no reports came in on last
week's FidoCon '91! I have not had time to write anytthing at all. I will
say, it was a great time. Hardly any flames at all. I'll try to elaborate
on it for next week's issue. I assume everyone else was swamped and a bit
tired after three days of non-stop talking and drinking bad coffee.

It seemed to me the biggest influence, content-wise, was Mitch Kapor and
John Barlow of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explaining the goings on
in the electronic communication world outside FidoNet. I think it was an
eye-opener for a lot of sysops, which is good. Response was quite positive.

Well, it's nearly midnight Sunday, and this has gotta ship out now, so
until next week...

Cheryl Buzzell 322/200


                                Region 16 Mourns


     Well I hope this article does not hit the streets. I hope someone
who knew Steve a little better than I writes in but if not at least this
much has been said.

     On Tuesday August 13th region 16 lost a loved and valued member
of it's community. Steve Ahola our beloved REC (and just about everything
else) coordinator died unexpectedly.

     Little did we know it when our echomail was interrupted that a few
days later we would find that our lives will never again be the same.
The fidonet node numbers of 322/1 and 322/210 would no longer take
us to Steve. That yes our echomail will return but Steve will not.

     I am sure that anyone and everyone who knew Steve even the sloghtest
would agree with me when I say his death will leave a big empty spot in
all our lives. The good times and the bad will be foever in our memories.

     I hope that this horrible event will instill in each and every one
of you the fact that we are mortal. That our time on this planet is number
and that we should all take the time to smell the roses. To appreciate
those who love us and show our love to others.

     In parting. I wish each and every one of you reading this article
to take a moment and say a prayer/wish or good though to Steve as he
journeys onto the next phase of existence and to his family who need
all the good wishes etc that they can get.

   The Fort Worth Format Nodelist - A Proposal v2.0

FidoNews 8-34                  Page 6                      26 Aug 1991


A number of discussions have taken place on the state of the
nodelist, both within and outside FidoNet.  In FidoNews 820
I outlined a proposal for a new, smaller nodelist format.
In FidoNews 826, after a lot of thought and discussion with
others, I published a short revision (it was short because I
was going on vacation two days after it came out, and I felt
pressed to get it out before I left for six weeks).

This is the third submission of this format.  It still isn't
a full FSC-type document, but in due course I expect it will
be.  I've elected to do another full-length draft and call
it Fort Worth Version 2.0.

I wrote this article using NODELIST.228, with a length of
1,019,934 bytes.  I don't use any nodelist pre-processors to
delete zones for me because that makes applying the NODEDIFF
much harder, in my opinion.  However, I do compile a full
Zone 1 nodelist and can add the rest in under 10 minutes if
I want to.

Several ideas have been proposed, such as changing the
format, splitting the nodelist into sections, etc.  I find
myself supporting a combination of both - change the format
and then segment.  I am still in favor of a pure ASCII
nodelist.

A couple weeks ago in FidoNews the gentleman from 3:680/828
(I'm sorry - I don't remember the name) asked why there was
no software for any of the current proposals, the Fort Worth
nodelist format included.  I can not answer for others, but
with respect to the Fort Worth format, the primary reason
there is no software is that the specifications aren't
complete.  You can not write a software package if you don't
know what you want it to do.  You must first define the
problem to be solved, and the method used to solve it, and
finally write the implementation of the solution.  The
problem is already well defined, but not the method to
solve.

On I ramble.  Anyway, here it is.  Comments are, of course,
welcome sent any way you want to send them, letter-bombs
excepted.  :-)

Again, let's start at the top.

  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -   -  -  -  -

 o   Each line in the nodelist will still be CR/LF terminated.
 o   CRC calculation and notation on the first line of the nodelist
         will remain the same.
 o   Each comment flag now in use will remain the same, with
FidoNews 8-34                  Page 7                      26 Aug 1991


         current comment formats remaining, as well.
 o   The nodelist must still be a pure ASCII file, with
         characters between 32 and 127 (space to tilde)
         allowed.
 o   The nodelist will be organized along the same lines we
         see today - that is, Zone/Region/Net/Hub/Node
         organization.
 o   Each Zone number must still be unique to a nodelist.
         Each Region and Net number must be unique to a Zone,
         and each node number must be unique to a Net.
 o   Each field in the nodelist is still divided by a comma (,)
         character, ASCII 44, hex 0x2C.  Spaces (ASCII 32, hex
         0x20) are not allowed except in comments.  Underscore
         (_) characters (ASCII 95, hex 0x5F) represent spaces in
         nodelist entries.
 o   Current maximum integers for Zone, Region, Net, and node
         numbers will apply.

   *   *   *   * Normal Nodelist Entries *   *   *   *   *   *

For a normal public node a listing is as follows:

num,sys_name,sysop,phone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag,mailcap

The NUM field is the individual node address, unique to a
        net, assigned according to current policy.

SYS_NAME is the system name, such as "Shadowdale_BBS". Maximum
        field length is 20 characters.

SYSOP is the sysop name, such as "Mike_Wilson".  Maximum
        field length is 20 characters.

PHONE is the phone number of a BBS, without extra dialing
        information such as an area code.  The number placed
        in this field is the same one you would dial if you
        were calling from right next door.  For example,
        "732-6157" is a valid value, while "1-817-732-6157"
        is not.  Because phone systems vary there is no field
        maximum.

        In order to faciliate nets without a standard
        dialing scheme (such as those which cover more than
        one area code), a dash "-" may be added in front of
        the phone number, like so:

        -1-817-...

        This will indicate that the DIAL_TRANS field
        (defined below) should not be added to the front of
        the phone number.

BPS is a one character representation of the maximum
        transmission rate of the node.  Valid values are:

            3  - 300 bps         9 - 9600 bps
            1  - 1200 bps        4 - 14,400 bps
            2  - 2400 bps        5 - 19,200 bps

        Other values may be added as technology becomes
        available.

MTYPE is a one or two character representation of modem type.
        Valid values include:

        M  - MNP error correction
        H  - USRobotics HST
        V3 - CCITT V.32
        P  - Telebit Packet Ensamble Protocol
        H9 - Hayes V-Series
        3B - CCITT V.32bis
        V4  - CCITT V.42
        4B - CCITT V.42bis

        Redundant listings should be avoided.  For example,
        because HST implies MNP error correction no MNP flag
        should be present.  More than one flag may be present if
        the modem type warrants it.  For example, a USRobotics
        Dual Standard with V.42bis could be listed as:

        ...,9,H,V3,4B,...

HRS is a two or nine character representation of the hours during
        which a node accepts mail.  If a node runs 24 hours this
        flag should be "CM".

        A nine character representation should be used for nodes
        that don't run the entire day but are up for part.  The
        format is:

        HHMM-hhmm

        "HH" is the 24-hour representation of the hour in which a
        node goes online to accept mail, translated to Greenwhich
        Mean Time (GMT).  Valid values are 00 - 23 (midnight to
        11:xx pm).

        "MM" is the two digit representation of the part of the
        hour in which the node goes online.  Valid values are
        00 - 59.

        "hh" is the 24-hour representation of the hour in which a
        node goes offline, and ceases to accept mail, translated

        to GMT.  Valid values are still 00 - 23.

        "mm" is the two digit representation of the part of the
        hour in which the node goes offline and ceases to accept
        mail.  Valid values are still 00 - 59.

        Thus, a node with this flag, listed as 0600-0900 is able
        to accept mail for three hours, from 06:00 to 09:00 GMT.
        A node listed as 1330-1800 is able to accept mail from
        1:30 pm to 6:00 pm GMT.

        If the flag is "CM" the node is able to accept mail 24
        hours a day.

        Absence of this flag indicates that a node only accepts
        mail during ZMH.  ZMH shuld not be indicated by this flag
        because all nodes are required to accept mail during ZMH.
        Only mail times different than ZMH should be noted in
        this field.

        This field is optional and may be left out.

UXFLAG is an informational flag used for special comments.
        The International Coordinator is the ultimate authority
        over what goes into the nodelist, and it is up to that
        person to decide upon valid values for this flag, as
        well as their meaning.  Suggested values include:

        UNEC - Net Echomail Coordinator
        UREC - Region Echomail Coordinator
        UZEC - Zone Echomail Coordinator
        USDS - SDS Distribution point
        USDC - SDS Distribution Coordinator

        This field is optional and may be omitted.

MAILCAP is the "mailer capability" flag.  In the current
        nodelist format an X preceeds a second letter.  In
        the Fort Worth format, the mailer capability flag is
        reduced to one letter, dropping the X.  Second
        letters remain the same (A for Bark/WaZoo
        update/requests, X for WaZoo update/requests, etc.).
        If a node does not use a front-end mailer or
        software with mailer capability (such as Fido or
        Opus) this flag is ommitted.


  *   *   *   *  Pvt and Hub System Notation  *   *   *   *   *

Two optional flags may be used at the beginning of a nodelist
entry.  These flags, P and H, are abbreviations of the Pvt
and Hub flags, and retain these meanings.

FidoNews 8-34                  Page 10                     26 Aug 1991


If one of these flags is used it placed before the node number,
with a comma (,) ending the field, like this:

H,num,sys_name,sysop,phone,bps,mtype,Uxflag,mailcap

If the P flag is used the PHONE, BPS, and MTYPE fields are left
blank, and the MAILCAP flag is ommitted, like this:

P,sys_name,sysop,,,Uxflag

   *   *   *   *   *   * Host System Notation  *   *   *   *   *

For net coordinators a different set of fields is used, preceeded
by the N flag (for Net) as follows:

N,net_num,net_name,area_admin,sysop,phone,dial_trans,
        bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag,mailcap

Field names duplicated from the previous section remain the same
except as noted below.

NET_NUM is the number of the network, assigned according to
        current policy.  A valid value of this is "130".

NET_NAME is the name of the network, created according to policy.
        A valid value of this might be "FTW_Gateway".  Maximum
        field length is 20 characters.

AREA_ADMIN is the name of the region administered.  A value for
        this field might be "Ft_Worth_Metro".  Maximum field
        length is 20 characters.

SYSOP is the person holding the NC position.  "Tom_Dobbins" is a
        valid value.

DIAL_TRANS is a portion of a phone number added to the beginning
        of the PHONE field on a call outside your local net.
        An example of this would be "1-817-" for all nodes in Net
        130.  If you must dial something special to call long
        distance (for example, from New York City to Fort Worth)
        put that here.  This does not include 011- for
        international calls, nor does it include special
        sequences to get an "outside line" on office phones, or
        strange digit codes not used by a normal phone network.

  *   *   *   *  Region and Zone System Notation  *   *   *   *

Each Region and Zone coordinator listing will be be preceeded by
either keyword "R" or "Z", as appropriate.

The formats for Zone and Region Coordinators are as follows:

FidoNews 8-34                  Page 11                     26 Aug 1991


R,reg_num,area_admin,sysop,fphone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag
Z,zon_num,area_admin,sysop,fphone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag

Unless defined below, each flag retains the meanings given in the
previous sections.

"R" and "Z" are unchanging flags, in the same manner as P,
N, and H are unchanging flags.

REG_NUM and ZONE_NUM are Region and Zone numbers, respectively.
        Each Region number must be unique to a Zone, and each
        Zone number must be unique to a nodelist.

AREA_ADMIN means the area contained within that section of the
        nodelist, such as "North_America" (for Zone 1) or
        "TX.AR.OK.LA" (for Region 19).

FPHONE is the full phone number of the system, including area
code.  A valid value would be "1-817-732-6157" while "732-6157"
would not.


  *   *   *   *   *   *  Down Nodes  *   *   *   *   *   *   *

The D flag preceeds a down node's number, in the following
formats.

For a standard node (a net member):

D,num,sys_name,sysop,phone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag,mailcap

For a Zone Service Node (1:1/x) or Regional Independant Node
(1:19/x):

D,num,sys_name,sysop,fphone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag,mailcap

  *   *   *  Zone Service and Regional Independants  *   *   *

For Zone service nodes (1:1/x, 2:2/x, etc.) and regional
independant nodes (1:19/x, 2:23/x, etc.) one last format is used.

num,sys_name,sysop,fphone,bps,mtype,hrs,Uxflag

The only difference between this flag and a normal (networked)
node is that there is a full phone number, not a partial one.

  *   *   *   *   *   *  NODEDIFFs  *   *   *   *   *   *   *

The current system of NODEDIFF production using the A, C, and D
commands will not change.

   *   *   *   *   *   *  Explanation  *   *   *   *   *   *   *

Here's the part you've been waiting for, but the one that I
dread.  Here are my reasons for the suggested changes.

There's no preceeding comma before a node number because there's
no need for one.  It's just an extra byte to transmist and keep
around.  If it doesn't need to be there, zap it.  If it's not a
keyword it's a node number, and there's no need to create a field
to tell it that.

Fields are limited to 20 characters because that encourages
sysops and coordinators comments succinct.  It discourages extra
information that doesn't need to be there.  For example,
"The_Shadowdale_BBS" and "Shadowdale" in the SYS_NAME field
convey exactly the same information but one is shorter, thus
taking less disk space.

Sysop names are included in the nodelist to make sure that
someone is responsable for what goes on at a node, so that it's
not just an address with nobody on the other end.  Some may argue
that if you don't know who the sysop is you don't need to be
sending mail there (and thus you don't need to list the name in
the nodelist), but it must be clear who is responsable for the
actions of a node.  Including the name seems the reasonable way
to go.  Since it's limited to 20 bytes per entry anyway, that's
not too hefty.  Drop the first name if necessary.

Phone numbers have been shortened because it just carries
redundant information.  There are about 60 nodes in Net 130 and
all carry 1-817- before their real phone numbers, which, on my
system, gets deleted anyway.  In net 124 there are over 100
nodes, and most had 1-214- in front of the number.  Assuming
125 nodes that's 750 bytes of information that can be cut to 6
bytes.  Do that for every net in FidoNet and we might just have a
good size cut.

BPS is cut to one characters because the trailing zeros just
aren't needed, and one character can convey the required
information.  Every listing has those two zeros, so it can be
universally understood that they're there.  Zap them and, at
10,000 nodes that's 20k saved.  Less disk space, less
transmission time, less money.

Mtype is included because some mailers allow the capability to
modify how a calling modem will react to the called modem's
carrier.  For example, if you have a Dual Standard and you call
another Dual Standard you can choose if you want an HST or V.32
connection.  Also, some modems require special commands be sent
to be able to connect with modems that offer different
communications protocols, and identifying the type of modem
present is a good way to facilitate this.

Hours online allow someone to send mail outside of ZMH to a node
that isn't CM.  If the node is online 24 hours CM is used to
indicate this.  Some say that since most nodes are CM, only
systems which do not support CM should be flagged, instead
of using a CM flag.  I believe that, because every FidoNet
member is required to operate during ZMH only that any
capabilities outside of this hour require a flag.`

Uxflags allow the conveyance of additional information to sysops
and (maybe) mailers, such as who is the local NEC or SDS
distributor.  Elections have been conducted using this flag and
it could be helpful.

Dropping the location field in the current nodelist eliminates
much of the redundant information, as does dropping area codes.
Does anybody really care what city 1:130/28 is in, so long as the
mail gets through?  If it's that important you can send a netmail
message rather than have it sit on everybody's system.

Some have suggested dropping private (Pvt) systems from the
nodelist.  However, because they currently exist I feel
obligated to support their inclusion.  Removal of private
systems is a matter left to policy, not to technical
specifications.  Ditto for Down nodes.

I have retained the current net/node system (Z:NNN/nnn.pt)
because all current mailer software supports some version of it.
Thus, mailers won't have to be completely rewritten to use a new
addressing scheme.  Besides, would you remember that Shadowdale,
sysop Mike Wilson, is node 1-817-732-6157 if node numbers were
phone numbers?  Everything would have to be rewritten.  With this
change relatively minor modifications would have to be made to
nodelist compilers and mailers.

Most of the changes suggested here are designed to save space.
To see if it works, let's use a large net in Zone 1 - Net 1:124,
Dallas, Texas.  I chose it because it's large, has several
private nodes, some which are down, and a hub-based mail
distribution system.  Because Net 124 is SO large, however, I
chose only to use the 1000 and 2000 hub series, as well as the
first two lines from the 3000 nodes.  All line formats except
Zone and Region are represented in these three sections.

All but one of these nodes fits within the FidoNews specs, less
than 65 characters per line.  Only 124/2113 had to be cut short.
In the nodelist ALL lines exceeded 65 characters.  Some went past
80 characters.  There is a very signifigant space savings.

Please consider this proposal.  If you'd like to suggest changes
you may netmail me at any address listed at the beginning of this
article.  Of not, well, okay.  :-)  It's not final, I'm not done,
it's not an FSC yet.  Take a look and see what you think.

A proposal of new nodelist formating
------------------------------------

I propose to use following method to save the volume of nodelist.

The baud rate and flags are now represented by using a 32-bit flag
type and written on the nodelist by hexdecimal.

Crash Mail should be:

  (^ the 32bit number in HEX)


Hope this can help!

A Correction Concerning the Suggested Change in Nodelist Flags



I overlooked something in my previous article:  all flags after the
baud_rate field in the nodelist are lumped together in one field
called the "Flags" field.  I mistakenly thought there were separate
fields for special operating conditions, modem capabilitites, etc.

The changes proposed in last week's article about converting from the
current multi-character flags to one-character flags can still be
implemented because by using the numbers "0" through "9" and the
letters "A" through "Z", you will get 36 possible flags.


So, to recap my thoughts on reducing the size of the nodelist:

1)  Change all baud rates to single-character codes:
    "300" would become "0"
    "1200" would become "1"
FidoNews 8-34                  Page 16                     26 Aug 1991


    "2400" would become "2"
    "4800" would become "3"
    "9600" would become "4"

2)  Change all flags to single-character codes.  For example:
    "CM" would become "0"
    "MO" would become "1"
    "LO" would become "2"
    "V21" would become "3"
    .
    .
    .
    "V42" would become "9"
    "MNP" would become "A"
    "H96" would become "B"
    etc. etc.


I do apologize for any confusion last week's article may have caused.
I hope this helps clear things up somewhat.
