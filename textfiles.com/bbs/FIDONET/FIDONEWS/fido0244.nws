       Tom Jennings
       9 Dec 85
       125/1

               Some interesting things happened to me in the last
       few weeks; the Hobbycomputerclub (HCC) of Holland invited me
       over there to officially open their club-run FidoNet in
       Holland, consisting of some 15 or 16 Fidos. I spent a total
       of 12 days out of the country, visiting England as well.

               There is so much to tell that I don't know where to
       start. I'll first just cover the trip serially, but there is
       also important information about Fido, and BBS's in general,
       in Europe that will have to be covered seperately. I may
       have to leave out important details at first, and get to the
       later. Please bear with me.

               At first I was a bit suprised that a computer club
       could and would afford to fly someone from the U. S. just to
       attend a club show and open a FidoNet network. The real
       suprise was discovering that the HCC has over 25,000
       members, and that their "newsletter" resembles a slightly
       thin issue of Byte magazine! Clubs on this scale just don't
       exist here in the U. S. as far as I know.

               I was greeted at Schipol airport, outside Amsterdam,
       by Henk Wevers, whose house I would be staying at. Henk, as
       it turns out, is a major force behind the Dutch FidoNet, and
       Fido in Europe in general, as well as one of the key people
       in the HCC. Henk also runs a Fido in Ede, which appears in
       the nodelist.

               After recovering from serious jet lag (9 hour clock
       difference plus a 9 hour flight) we headed to the show in
       Utrecht Friday morning. Utrecht is a major city in Holland,
       and a major business center. The show filled a large hall,
       similar to most US convention centers (SF's Civic Center for
       instance) and had about 30,000 attendees on Friday. The Fido
       booths were right at the main entrance; there was a large
       entranceway announcing the HCC show, and Fido was right
       where you went in. Fido had a very large presence, and there
       were a couple of Fidos running demos during the entire two
       day show.

               BBS's are just starting to generate large interest
       amongst hobbiests, because of the modem problem; while we in
       North America have only three universal protocols (Bell
       103A, Bell 212A, and CCITT V.22bis for 2400 baud), in Europe
       there are at least a half dozen incompatible protocols, and
       the North American models are all useless. This subject will
       be covered in detail later.

               There was a tremendous amount of interest in Fido,
       if you had told me beforehand I would not have believed you.

       At a talk given by Henk explaining the HCC's plans for Fidos
       in Holland, and where I answered questions, the room was
       filled to capacity, standing room only. Needless to say, I
       was not prepared for such a response, I'm not used to this!
       There was coverage on national TV, newspapers and radio
       about the show (the HCC is taken very seriously) including
       Fido.

               The next day, Saturday, was similar, but much
       busier. Hectic is not the right word, we literally ran from
       one event to the next for much of the day. The show was
       packed with visitors.

               I guess all computer shows are basically the same,
       no matter where they are held. There was row after row of
       booths, all displaying various products, many small machines
       making noise and playing games, others showing more sedate
       things like monitors for IBM clones, and so on. There was
       also a very large user group presence; anyone familiar with
       the unfortunate recent history of the West Coast Computer
       Faire will appreciate this! The fact that most communication
       is done in Dutch is the first indication that something is
       different, and after looking closely you see that emphasis
       is put on different kinds of products and services.

               The most common machine by far is the Commodore 64.
       While it's a popular machine here, it's nothing compared to
       Holland at least. I saw more add on hardware and software
       that I decided to think about purchasing one for myself.
       CP/M is very popular, mostly a thing called the Amstrad
       (spelling?) which from what I've seen is very nice, color
       graphics and so on, and seems to be high quality.

               On Saturday morning, Pieter van Diepen, the current
       publisher of the HCC magazine, gave me a quick tour of old
       Utrecht. (The part we were in was a typical high tech city,
       with the usual traffic and hotels.) The old city surrounds
       canals, ancient churches (I mean ancient, hard for us
       Yankees to appreciate 600 year old anything), and a
       coffehouse that has been in continuous operation for about
       300 years, where we had coffee, and made us late enough to
       mess up the plans for opening FidoNet on live radio. Sigh.

               I don't remember seeing a single IBM computer; like
       here, most these days are Taiwan clones. The Taiwanese are
       changing the world of computing in ways they may not
       realize; someone like IBM does the large scale design, the
       cloners simplify and improve the design (Faraday, etc) and
       the Taiwanese manufacture them in *huge* quantities, for
       cheap, and all that I've seen are of pretty good quality.
       Even I have one. These are what most European Fidos are
       running on, and I would guess the same is true for North
       America.

               The international sysops meeting was held Saturday
       afternoon. Henk Wevers and other Holland sysops where there,
       plus Frank and Silvia Thornley from England, Martin ? from
       England, Bob ? (sorry for the ?) from Dataflex (a modem


       Fidonews                   Page  3               16 Dec 1985





       manufacturer) in London, Arne Asplem and Robert Hercz from
       Norway, and of course me. Helge ? from Sweden had an
       accident and could not make it.

               It was not a big complex affair, mostly just a get
       together, but past experience says that more was
       accomplished than meets the eye. Merely putting names with
       faces does a lot of good. We cleared up some
       misunderstandings about putting the European nodes in the
       Boston net; for example, what we thought was a convenience
       turns out to really make for additional work. Since Fido
       doesnt know about "countries" (yet) they were included in
       the Boston net so that the mail would get routed properly;
       in reality, it makes it extremely difficult to handle mail
       in Europe, as most mail is done via PICKUP and POLL due to
       the lack of autodial modems.

               That night, there was a big banquet for the HCC
       staff that put it all together, we ate too much good food
       and drank real beer, not this "lite" stuff. Pour that stuff
       down the drain!


               The next day, Sunday, Frank, Silvia, Arne, Robert,
       Bob, Martin and I went in two cars to Belgium to take the
       ferry to Dover, and then on to Frank's house in Woking. The
       drive itself was interesting; by the time we made it on to
       the ferry, I had three flavors of money (dollars, guilders,
       pounds), which makes small purchases very interesting until
       you get used to it. Robert and Arne also had German marks,
       and presumably Norwegian money. Welcome to Europe.

               From the ferry we all went directly to Frank's
       house, where we all spent the night. The truly hardcore gang
       (Martin, Bob, Arne and Robert) stayed up all night setting
       up Robert's computer, and playing with Frank's huge
       collection of IBM PC software. Us more rational types went
       to bed.

               For the next few days, we talked about various
       things, Fido of course among them, and Frank gave us the
       grand tour of London and area. It was an excellent tour; it
       would have taken me weeks and weeks of vacationing to hit
       all the spots, if I could have ever found them at all.

               One I would not have found was the pub at Fullers
       brewery. The best bitter beer I ever had, period. Drank a
       fair amount there, took some back with us ... us hardcore
       types drank it and other things, the more rational ones went
       to sleep. Guess who had a hangover. And yes, it was worth
       it.

               For the next three days, four of us traveled around
       London and area, Martin and Bob having gone home. We visited
       Dataflex (makers of addon boards for various computers, and
       soon a Hayes compatible modem).

               On Wednesday, I returned to Holland, and spent three


       Fidonews                   Page  4               16 Dec 1985





       days pointlessly wandering around Amsterdam, having a
       wonderful time taking pictures and freezing to death.

               A hint for travelers: the standard travel books
       (Fodors, Baedakers, etc) absolutely refuse to mention the
       weather, with one exception that crammed "average yearly
       temperatures" over much of Europe into one paragraph.

               Europe is miserably cold in the winter. Plan on New
       York City weather. Cold, wet, more cold and wet. It was
       supposedly colder than usual for that time of year. this
       always happens to me; I was in the South West high desert,
       and it rained. I went to Phoenix AZ four years ago, and it
       rained there, too. Maybe it's me.

               On Sunday, I returned to San Francisco, on an eleven
       hour flight; jet lag in this direction isn't too bad,
       relatively speaking.


               I want to thank once again everyone who made my trip
       over pleasant, never mind possible. Henk Wevers and his
       family for making me welcome at their home and to Henk for
       arranging things; Frank Thornley for putting me up at his
       home, and or putting up with all the hackers messing up his
       house, and for the grand tour of London. It was appreciated!
       And of course to the people fo the HCC for their enthusiasm
       for Fido and friendliness.








               The modem situation in Europe is very very different
       than here in N. A. In the U. S., we have the "benefit" of
       having our modem protocols dictated to us by the one time
       telecom monopoly, AT&T. We have the Bell 103A protocol for
       300 baud and less and Bell 212A for 1200 baud. There are and
       were others, of course, but most have thankfully died out;
       Bell 202A is still used by radio amateurs, however, mainly
       for radio use.

               This is not a discussion of technical excellence in
       protocol design; merely observations on practical reality. I
       don't care for the way Bell did their 1200 baud protocol
       either. Anyways ...

               In Europe, however, things are a little different.
       There are at least a half dozen different protocols, most
       defined by the CCITT. (Don't ask ...) The main ones, I
       think, are 300 baud V.21, 1200 baud V.22, 1200/75 Viditel,
       and V.22bis 2400 baud. Modems are very expensive, and there
       doesn't seem to by the hobbiest/microcomputer type array of
       modems we have here.



       Fidonews                   Page  5               16 Dec 1985





               While compared to the North American continent
       Europe is physically compact, (it takes 5 hours to fly from
       San Francisco to New York, and somewhat less than that from
       there to Amsterdam) there are many languages in use, most
       incomprehensible to each other. Lucky for us, English is the
       technical language of choice, so Europeans are not as
       intimidated by English as we are (generally) by Dutch,
       French, German, etc.

               I am familiar somewhat with AT&T's policies as to
       making connections to the phone line; I do not know what the
       situation is in countries in Europe, whether it's easy or
       hard, or if it varies from country or not. The PTT seems to
       be everywhere; is it the same across Europe or different all
       over?

               Last, but definitely not least ...

               The person who basically started Fido in Europe was
       Ron Smallwood, in London. He was Fido #33, and first started
       in early 1984. Talk about pioneering ... not too much was
       heard from him over here, due mainly to the incompatibilities,
       the time differences and the expense of overseas phone
       calls. Ron is not running Fidos anymore, but he kept things
       going long enough for others to pick it up. I did not get to
       meet Ron, I ran out of time and had to leave, but I'm sure
       we will meet in the future.

               I'm sure I missed or glossed over many important
       points, if there are any questions or corrections please
       feel free, etc. And thanks once again for everyone involved
       for the very pleasant and informative trip to Europe!

       Fido is such a great tool.  There are now literally hundreds
       of Fido Bulletin Boards across  the  nation  and  the inter-
       national list  is growing  too.  These boards provide a rich
       exchange of public domain software, technical  questions and
       answers and can also be an interesting social environment.

       In addition  to these  technically-oriented boards, a number
       of non-techie boards are springing  up.    They  are focused
       around some  "special interest."   For  example, there are a
       number of boards with  a medical  bent, boards  dedicated to
       music and  concert reviews, etc.  Sometimes these boards are
       not very visible and are hard to find  just by  browsing the
       board names  in the  Fido Node  List.  That is the reason we
       are writing this little public announcement.

       There are a number of boards in the net who  have a "special
       interest" in  the Gay & Lesbian Community.  We'd like to let
       all of our gay brothers and  sisters out  there know  who we
       are.  The boards listed below are places that you can get in
       touch with the Gay & Lesbian Community.   You can  use these
       boards  as  a  social  tool  and  also  to read and exchange
       information about current events and issues of importance to
       us all.  So give us a call and let's exchange some ASCII!

                    Multilink, Jram, & Bulletin Boards

           This is more of a request for help than it is an
       article. It seems that I am not the only Sysop having
       trouble with the above combination. I have talked to other
       Sysop's around the country and find that they also have
       problems with Multilink, JRam boards, and Bulletin Board
       software. For whatever reason, our systems will lock or
       crash periodically for no apparent reason.

           I know that several boards are running Multilink
       successfully without the JRam board. Allen's board (Fido
       108/10) is an example. However it seems that when you add
       the JRam board, whether the JRam AT, or JRam 8, the
       problems start. Neither Tall Trees, nor Software Link are
       much help at solving the problem. I have talked to them
       repeatedly, and Rudy Gordon (Sysop of The Machine) has
       talked to them for the last 4 months.

           The problem is the same whether you run Fido as I do,
       or RBBS as Rudy does. What we need is for anyone that has
       experienced the same problem to get in touch with me.
       Please put out the word to non Fido boards as well. We need
       to put some pressure on the two companies involved to get
       the problem solved. Frankly it makes me mad that I spent
       about $1,000 buying Multilink and the "approved memory
       board" only to have problems that the software company
       doesn't seem to want to correct.

           Just for your information, I am running a IBM AT with
       256k, a JRam AT populated at 2mb with 120ns chips, Hercules
       color card, Princeton HX-12, Seagate 30mb, one USR 2400
       internal, and a Courier 2400 external.

           Please send replies to me, Butch Walker - Sysop TBLUG
       Fido 10/620.

       EJ McKernan
       Node 14/386 ... The "Bit Bucket"
       Emporia, KS  (316)343-8028
       300/1200/2400 Baud ... 24 Hours/day

       As most of my fellow fidosysops know, fido has the ability
       to allow someone with a SYSOP priv. level to drop to
       dos, execute some code (sysop utilities, edit FILES.BBS,
       ect...)  It works great, IF (and this is a big if) one
       is running fido on any machine, except for the sanyo.
       I've often wondered why it was that the sysop 0 command
       croaked on the sanyo and receintly jumped in with debugger
       cocked to see if I could discover what was going on.

       For quite some time I blamed the trouble on Sanyos AUX1.SYS
       driver. Sanyo goofed their first try on the serial port
       device driver and released AUX1 as a replacement driver. It
       seemed to run great if you executed "CTTY AUX" immediatly
       after bootup, but the system locked up if you tried it after
       running fido_syo.exe. Well in looking at the code for fido
       I discovered that the transmitter is disabled in the sanyo's
       serial port when fido exits. One bug down.

       Further looking at FIDO, I discovered that the interupts
       are also disabled (masked out) from the UART. It
       seems that sanyo coded the device driver using a ring
       buffer on the receiver (interupt driven) and polled the
       xmitter if dos needed to transmit anything. Well a quick
       routine to enable the transmitter and turn the interupts
       back on fixed everything.

       If your running fido on a sanyo and would like copies of the
       above mentioned software it's available on my board,
       the Bit Bucket, at 316-343-8028 in the Network file area.
       The file is named SANINTFX.ARC. It contains AUX1.SYS from
       sanyo, my RUNFIDO.BAT file, and SANINTFX.COM the interupt
       patch routine. It also contains a modified version of
       watchdog called WATCHDGS.COM (watch dog sanyo.)

       One other item of note. You can't must remote sanyo from
       a terminal with 8 bits, 1 stop, no parity. Otherwise
       you'll get everything echoed back from DOS but nothing
       will be accepted as valid keystrokes.

       Finally...I can remote sysop my FIDO!

                     Introduce Special Users to Fido

       If you are like many Fido network users, you probably
       demonstrate the system to friends and acquaintances who
       express even the mildest interest.  How would you like to
       show the network to a group of people who could put Fido's
       potential to maximum use, but may not even know of it's
       existence?  There are approximately 20,000 to 45,000 people in
       this country who are both deaf and blind.  Some of the Deaf
       Blind are totally deaf and totally blind and special skills in
       sign language is needed to communicate with them.  Others
       who are "hearing impaired" and blind, can be vocally
       instructed in the use of computers and can use computers
       with braille attachments.  Still others are deaf and
       "visually impaired" and can see a CRT well enough to use
       the computer.  It is for this third group that this article
       is written.

       Ever stop and think how often you use the phone to talk with
       friends?  Give a thought about someone who can't use the
       phone normally and must use a Telecommunication Device for
       the Deaf (TDD), a sort of baby computer with one line of
       letters that bump across the display, teletype fashion.
       Deaf people with normal vision have little trouble with
       TDD's but a visually impaired person may have trouble
       reading the moving letters due to the speed they move and
       the person's restricted field of view.  And they can't take
       their eyes off the display for an instant without losing
       track of what's being said unless they have a TDD model that
       also prints paper messages or has a "save" recorder feature
       - neither a satisfactory solution for the visually impaired.
       In addition they are limited to people who also have a TDD
       to talk to; or they must use the services of a volunteer
       relay service to get messages to friends without TDD's.

       How many people do you know have TDD's?  How many have
       computers?  Lots more!  So why don't these D/B people use
       computers for communication? (just think of the use they
       could make of the FidoGram feature.)  The problem is
       communications itself; someone must "communicate" and
       explain the system to them on a "one to one" basis.  And
       that someone is reading this article right now.  OK, you'll
       give it a try.  Where do we find a D/B person to show Fido
       to?  They may know even less about you than you know about
       them and some of them are actually in hiding from rejection.
       Some areas have D/B support groups, often associated with
       the American Association for the Deaf Blind (814 Thayer
       Ave., Silver Spring MD 20910). Some church and temples have
       a "Office for the Deaf".  A call to the HELEN KELLER
       NATIONAL CENTER, Sands Point, Long Island NY (voice or TDD
       516/944-8900) or the HKNC Field Service Supervisor, Dallas
       TX (214/630-4936) will get you the name and phone number of
       the HKNC district representative who may be able to advise
       you about groups to contact with a offer to help.  These
       groups in turn will see if any of their members are
       interested in learning about computer communication.

       After you have meet a D/B person, then what?  Two rules: (a)


       Fidonews                   Page 12               16 Dec 1985





       Never take the advise of "experts" in D/B rehabilitation as
       the last word.  Just like computer "experts" they're right
       most of the time and wrong just often enough to be human.
       (Yes, that includes this article.)  (b) ASK.  Just that:
       Ask!  Ask the person you are trying to help how you can
       help, communicate with or show something to, how you can
       best do it.  Each D/B person "see's" a little different and
       only he/she - not a expert - can tell you how.  For the
       first contact, arm yourself with a black ink ballpoint or
       felt tip pen and white paper - NOT a pencil and yellow legal
       pad.  Some visually impaired people need large letters.
       Others, due to restricted field of view, read normal size
       letters better.  All need contrast between words and paper.

       Write out a short note telling the D/B person your name and
       explain your interest in computer communications.   Describe
       the room the computer is located in before you take them
       into it - and be prepared to follow the Blind Persons Rule
       of Doors: "All the way Open or All the way Closed!"  Clear
       the decks of anything bumpintoable.  Ask the person if
       he/she can lipread; some can if conditions are right. If you
       have  a mustache or are in a dimly lit room conditions are
       not right.  And few D/B's can read smoke signals if you talk
       with a pipe in your mouth.

       Keep in mind that the D/B person can't look at you and the
       screen or keyboard at the same time so you can't "back seat
       drive" him/her thru Fidoland.  Since you will have to give
       them a chance to become familiar with the CRT display, it
       would probably be best to put a text file on screen first to
       see how well they can read it.  I'd suggest letting them
       read the Fido USERSMAN.UAL on screen first; this will save
       you the trouble of explaining how the system works and find
       out how well they can see the screen.  Depending on their
       individual eyesight condition, some will do well with the
       standard size screen.  Others will need larger size
       characters or a larger screen.  Still others will be most
       comfortable reading small, sharp characters on a small
       screen like the Kaypro 2-84 / 4-84 or Radio Shack TRS-80 /4P
       (the portable model).  LCD displays usually do not have
       enough contrast for a visually handicapped person to read.
       This will probably be the most important part of the project
       and will require some patience to help the person read the
       screen comfortably.  If you have a file containing a logon
       of a fido node that you captured on disk, put it on the
       screen so the person can become familiar with the menus
       while they "hold still".  Remember that the person may not
       be able to see the entire screen at the same time and will
       "scan" it by sections.  (They may also need time to scan the
       room and the parts of the computer so don't start this
       project when your pressed for time.)

       Most D/B's will have some typing ability from using a TDD
       but will need a little time to adapt to the new keyboard.
       Some use Hi Marks (a red cement for the blind) to make small
       "bumps" on the right edge of the "F" and the left edge of
       the "J" keys.  You might place a thin strip of masking tape
       on the edge of these keys to make locating them easier.  The


       Fidonews                   Page 13               16 Dec 1985





       concept of commands may be new to them and you may have to
       explain, for example that typing "M" at a menu will either
       get you into the Msg. section or back into Main Menu
       depending on where it's typed from.  Another concept you may
       have to explain is the password security procedure.

       When you're sure the D/B person can use the screen and
       understands what's going to happen then it's time to go
       online.  Dial up your favorite Fido node and let the person
       watch you "read the mail".  Use 300 baud the first time
       (even if you have a capture buffer on) as 1200 may be too
       fast for some people to follow.  And if your running on
       "Expert" mode, you might drop back into "Novice" with "M)ore
       On" for this project.  Then give your D/B person a chance to
       try it him/her self and browse through a message or text file
       area.  If you have a Sysop in your area who's always read to
       chat at the touch of a Y)ell key, give the D/B person a
       chance to "talk" to him/her as this "one to one" feature may
       be important; they will be comparing it to the TDD.  (Best
       to make advance arrangements with the Sysop.)  Be sure to
       explain that many Sysop's are not usually available.

       In addition to message posting and retrieval, explain the
       Fido ham telegram setup and it's restrictions (especially
       msg length).  If they have out of state friends, and no one
       to make calls for them, this feature will be important.

       And finally, be prepared with some realistic information if
       he/she asks about buying his/her own computer, including
       pricing information.  Keep in mind that the least expensive
       system may not be suitable for a handicapped person.  Few
       blind people can comfortably read a Radio Shack 100.  A
       person who can't hear a dial tone will want a Auto-Dial
       modem.  The ability of the computer to run a program with a
       text file download capture buffer is almost a must for
       someone who can't read a screen quickly; they can always
       grab all the messages and exit the board to read them, then
       return to post answers to messages.

       Showing a deaf, partly blind person the Fido network may
       take time and patience and you will have to reexamine some
       of the things you take for granted.  But for a D/B persons
       with few communication options, you will be opening the
       world for them.

       The deadline for free Christmas Fidograms to arrive at
       101/105 is December 20th.  this should give our packet
       switching systems and other network sufficient time to
       route your messages.

       What are Fidograms, you say?  Egads! - We've accepted
       Fidograms all the way from Sweden, Alberta and Holland,
       bound for every which way, and you don't even know about
       them yet?  Sheesh...

       OK - a brief recap.  Fidograms are your way of sending free
       personal telegrams to almost anyone in the USA who has
       access to a voice telephone.  Just like Western Union.  You
       provide us with your complete name, address and fone number,
       as well as the same complete data for the addressee of the
       Fidogram.  Naturally, you want to provide us with the text
       of the Fidogram (20 words, more or less max), and a
       signature.  That's it - we take it from there.

       Your Fidograms are routed from Fido 101/105 via Amateur
       Packet Radio at 1200 bauds into our networks, and are
       relayed by radio across town, or across the country until
       they reach the city of ultimate destination, at which point
       they are telephoned to the addressee.

       There are no limits to the number of Free Fidograms that you
       can send, but there ARE limits as to the contents.  Nothing
       related to business or the making of profit to any persons
       may be contained in a Fidogram.

       You can send Fidograms to certain countries overseas, but
       only those whose governments have the necessary agreements
       with our government.  Those that do include Canada, Mexico
       and many central and south American countries, but virtually
       none in Europe.  If your local Fido does not yet have the
       file describing Fidograms, contact me at 101/105 and I'll
       try to get it to you.

       One more reminder - college and University Fidos should
       consider "advertising" free Fidograms during the week
       preceding Valentine's day.  Terminals placed in college
       cafeterias usually net us several thousand Fidograms each
       year - bundles of fun!  Enjoy.

            Thom  has asked me if I would do a regular (or at least
       semiregular) column for the newsletter.   It  is  with  some
       misgivings  that  I undertake this venture.  I enjoy writing
       on occasion when the mood strikes me, but the thought  of  a
       weekly   deadline  is  very  unsettling.   My  wife  is  the
       journalist in the family.  Several years ago she worked  for
       a  chain  of  local newspapers and did a weekly column which
       appeared in several of them.  I can still remember the  days
       she  would  sit dowm at the typewriter with a blank page and
       nothing to say.  At  those  times  even  the  cats  tip-toed
       around the house!

            Thom  has given me no guidance as to format or content.
       I interpret this as having a good deal of  latitude,  and  I
       shall  make  the  most  of  it  as I meander from subject to
       subject.

            It is incredible to me that Fido was conceived only two
       years  ago  this  month, the brain-child of Tom Jennings and
       John Madill.  I first became involved when I put up  version
       4 in March of 84 and was "officially listed" as Fido # 10 in
       April.

            Those were the days of  at  least  three  new  software
       releases  a  week.   I can recall at least one occasion when
       two new versions were released  the  same  day,  only  hours
       apart.   I had considered doing an "early history" piece for
       this first column, but things happened so fast  and  furious
       that, on reflection, it's all a blur!

            Unfortunately,  none of us kept a journal (how could we
       know we were making history) and Fido's early  history  can,
       at best, only be approximated.  I'm not sure how the idea of
       "the  network"  got   started.    I   recall   a   telephone
       conversation  or  two  with  TJ in which he talked about the
       concept in abstract terms.  "I have no  intention  of  doing
       it, but wouldn't it be neat if.  .  ." Within a week, we had
       version 6 and FidoNet was born!  I think that may have  been
       June.

            I  think  the phrase "Wouldn't it be neat if.  .  ." is
       as responsible as anything for many of Fido's features.   Of
       course,  each  new  feature  usually  broke two or three old
       features and could be counted on to supply at least four new
       releases.

            Not  all  the  features  this   phrase   spawned   were
       necessarily  good.   I remember when TJ added "broadcast" to
       FidoNet.   The  first  version  of  this  feature   had   an
       interesting   bug.    Whenever  Fido  received  a  broadcast
       message, it would rebroadcast  it.   Sort  of  an  automated


       Fidonews                   Page 16               16 Dec 1985





       electronic  chain letter.  A single message could have, in a
       week's time, choked the  network!   We  never  did  get  the
       feature  to  work properly, and when we passed through about
       forty nodes on the net, we decided we didn't want it to work
       right and it was removed.

            Our  early node lists were, at best, only about seventy
       percent accurate.  I recall two weeks of  trying  unsuccess-
       fully  to  send a message to a new node in Texas.  Finally I
       dialed the number one day and a mechanical operator informed
       me  "The  number  you have dialed has been changed.  The new
       number is.  .  ." A call to the new number connected me with
       a real person.  When I told her that my information was that
       an electronic bulletin board  was  supposed  to  answer  the
       first  number,  she  explained that the board was her son's.
       He had accidently reversed his voice and  board  numbers  in
       his  request  for  a  node  number.  After several nights of
       being awakened out of  a  sound  sleep  by  incessant  phone
       jangling  between three and four am., they had changed their
       number.

            Anecdotes  abound,  but  my  wife  tells  me  a  column
       shouldn't  be  too  long.   (I  think she wants to limit the
       amount of proof reading sne has to do.) I would like to hear
       from you with suggestions for future topics, questions about
       FidoNet, whatever.  Send FidoNet mail to 100/76.  I will try
       to  respond  directly  to  all messages, and some with broad
       general interest I will share with you here.

                     Why You Should Use A Retail Store

       By Robert Bova
       President, MicroAge-Downtown Computer Store
       Lexington, Kentucky

               Nowadays you can buy a computer from almost anybody.
       Toy stores, discount stores and by mail-order.

               But from most of these "computer stores" all you get
       is  a  computer or some software which may or may not run in
       your computer.

               You get very little,  if any,  help in figuring  out
       how  to  connect  the  cables  or  learning  how  to use the
       machine.

               After all, how do you get training by mail-order?

               But if you purchase a computer from  a  good  retail
       computer  store  (and  the  key  is  finding a good computer
       retailer),  you get more than just hardware and software  --
       you get a human being, one who will spend the time necessary
       to teach you how to use your computer.

               This is called SUPPORT.

               Support takes many forms. Not the least is the skill
       your  sales  representative  has  in  guiding  you  in  your
       purchase of equipment and software.

               True,  no computer store can  carry  everything  and
       every  brand,   but  today's  retail  computer  store  sales
       representative generally has a wide  selection  of  computer
       brands and software from which to choose.

               If the salesperson (who should really be more than a
       salesperson,  but  a  guide  in the often confusing world of
       computer hype) is doing his job,  he or she can size up your
       requirements for computer power.

               Often  a  good computer salesperson will determine a
       client's needs would best  be  served  by  a  less-expensive
       computer configuration.  In many ways,  today's professional
       computer salesperson is  a  consultant  to  the  purchaser's
       business, rather than just someone trying to sell as much as
       possible to the customer.

               That isn't always the case,  but new professionalism
       has come to computer retailers.  It had to happen  since  we
       all want your repeat business.

               A  good computer dealer will follow up the sale with
       effective and comprehensive training.  He'll  pre-test  your
       computer  at  his  shop,  install it and then re-check it at
       your location.  Plus he'll train you and your  employees  in
       its every function.



       Fidonews                   Page 18               16 Dec 1985





               From  hardware  to  software,  you  should know your
       computer and its uses after the  dealer  has  completed  his
       initial installation.

               The  job  isn't  done here.  A good dealer will stay
       with you until you are confident that you can make your  new
       computer  an invaluable asset.  Then he'll provide follow-up
       support, maintenance and the consultation required to insure
       your success.

               A good dealer will make available to  you  reliable,
       tried and tested hardware and software, all sized and priced
       to  fit  your present requirements,  but with the ability to
       grow as your needs expand.

               And, more importantly,  the dealer makes sure you'll
       never be alone in your computer needs.

               A  local  computer  retailer  provides conveience as
       well.  The store is nearby and you can usually test software
       and hardware in the store to get a feel for how it works. No
       ad,  no  matter  how flashy,  in a magazine can give you the
       feel of "hands-on" experience.

               And you know that if you have a  problem  after  the
       sale, your local computer dealer is just going to be a local
       phone  call  away  for aid and comfort.  If it isn't a sale,
       those folks with the 800 numbers in California that sell  at
       a discount, don't want to hear from you at their expense.

               My  advice?  Find  a consultant you feel comfortable
       working  with  at  a  local  computer  store.  Explain  your
       computer needs with him or her,  then give the salesperson a
       chance to evaluate your situation and make recommendations.

               Then expect your consultant to follow  through  with
       support, that magic word, which should lead to satisfaction.

       Allen Miller 108/10

                            Fido with Multilink


            I would like to find out how many of you are running
       Fido along with Multilink multitasking software.  If you
       are, or know of another Fido system that is, please send me
       a message letting me know the name of the system running
       Multilink (to Fido 108/10 @ 513/579-2587).

            One consequence, that I have found, of running Fido with
       Multilink is that the elapsed time computation that Fido
       does is off by a factor of 2 (2 if you run 2 Multilink
       partitions).  This means that if you set your session time
       limit at 60 minutes, a user is really allowed to be on for
       120 minutes.  You can compensate for this by changing your
       time limit parameter to 30 if you really want to have people
       able to stay on for 60 minutes.  The catch is in the file
       trans-fer transaction.  If a user wants to download a file
       that would take 35 (real) minutes, Fido says that there is
       not enough time remaining even though your intention was to
       permit 60 minutes of wall time.

            A friend of mine is writing a program to work in
       conjunction with Fido & Multilink to correct for this
       elapsed time distortion.  Part of the reason for this
       solicitation is to evaluate the usefulness of this program
       to a wider audience.  Once again, please let me know of any
       Fido systems that are running with Multilink.

       Regards,
       Allen

                              Rainbow Corner
                           by Theodore Needleman


       Welcome  to  Rainbow  Corner.  I'd like to introduce myself.
       I'm the  guy  from  Business  Software  Beat.  So  much  for
       introductions.  What  is  "Rainbow Corner"?  My hope is that
       it is someplace where friends will gather to talk about  the
       DEC  Rainbow.  What hardware is available from DEC and other
       vendors to enhance it?  How about  software  -  how  can  we
       accomplish what we want to?

       The  "Corner" was created because of requests from you,  our
       readers, for more coverage and information on the micro side
       of the street.  (Our Editor:  "Hello Ted - Our  readers  are
       asking  for  more micro coverage,  so we're adding a Rainbow
       column.  Want to write  it?"  ME:  "Well...Ah...Um...Sure!")
       The  column comes at an auspicious time.  Last week (this is
       being written in mid February) DEC announced it is switching
       the plant used  for  production  of  Rainbows  over  to  the
       production  of  "OTHER  SYSTEMS".  Rumors  abound.  My local
       Digital Systems Center is claiming that  production  of  the
       Rainbow is being moved to Hong Kong.  Other sources say that
       the  Rainbow  100  series is dead - when (and if) production
       starts up again,  it will be of  a  new  model.  I've  heard
       rumors  of a completely IBM-PC compatible Rainbow,  and of a
       lap-top Rainbow.  Someone has even suggested to me that  DEC
       will  be  coming out with a coprocessor system that will run
       both VAX and MS-DOS.  Are any  of  these  rumors  true?  Who
       knows?  Only DEC, and they're not saying!

       In  any  case,  there's no reason to feel abandoned.  In the
       coming weeks Rainbow Corner  will  review  hardware  add-ons
       that will make your system more powerful.  Numerous requests
       for review software have gone out, and some very interesting
       packages have already started to arrive.

       One  last  point  before  we move on to other business.  The
       "Corner" exists as a place to share  information.  If  there
       is  something you are particularly interested in,  drop me a
       line and I'll try to cover it.  The same offer goes for your
       questions.  If I don't have (or can't find) an answer, maybe
       another reader will be able to help.  The Rainbow is a  well
       designed  and engineered computer.  Its biggest defect seems
       to  be  the  dearth  of  information  available  about   it.
       Hopefully, the "Rainbow Corner" will help fill the void.

       Before  I  close  this  week's  column,  I'd like to briefly
       discuss an interesting piece of software that came across my
       desk recently.  As most of you no  doubt  know,  the  "Print
       Screen"  key  works  only  when  you are in "Terminal" Mode.
       Wouldn't it be nice to be able to accomplish a  screen  dump
       at  other  times?  An  inexpensive  ($39.95)  utility called
       "PRINT-SCREEN"  from  Micro  Resources  Inc.,   (154  Needam
       Street,  Newton,  MA.,  02164, phone 617/965-2890) gives you
       this capability with CP/M-86/80 (versions 1 & 2) and  MS-DOS
       (versions  2.01 & 2.05).  It has a few limitations,  such as
       not being able to print graphics screens or the Set-up  mode

       screen,  but  for the price,  it is a worthwhile addition to
       your utility library.

       That's it for now.  See you next issue.
