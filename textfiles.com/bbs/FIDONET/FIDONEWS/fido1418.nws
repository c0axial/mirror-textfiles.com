     Lots of fun and interesting stuff in today's Issue although I did not
     receive the usual Z2 stats file this week from ZC2.

     For those of you who still run BBSes, Opus has FINALLY released a new
     version this week. Opus 1.79 is making the rounds and has also been
     hatched into SDSOPUS file echo. For those of you who've never heard of
     it, Opus was the first multi-function BBS/Mailer developed after Fido.
     There is an announcement further down the page with sources.

     Still no IC. [sigh]

     Hi, David!

     Saw your note in Fidonews about International BBS Week.  Thought I'd
     let you know I'll do what I can to help.  I'm a Broadcast Journalist
     by trade, author of the BBS Guide to Public Relations, a BBS user (not
     a sysop), and few weeks ago I started writing a column on BBS
     Marketing for Fidonews.

     I can lend my expertise to anyone who wishes it, but I have no money
     to spend (a wife and three kids pretty well take care of that).  I'm
     drawing up a draft news release that Sysops can adapt for their own
     use.  I should have it done by Wednesday (April 30).

                   Warmest regards,

                   Robert Parson

     New Beanie Babies Echo
     by Ronnie Toth, 1:135/71

     BEANIE BABIES * BEANIE BABIES * BEANIE BABIES * BEANIE BABIES *

     They're here!   They're there!  They're everywhere!
     (If you can find them.)

     And now the FidoNet Beanie Baby echo, BEANIES, is here too!

     If you're into BEANIE BABIES, join the fun in the new BEANIES echo.

     It's all about having fun with these adorable critters, and a forum
     for Private Collectors to chat, exchange ideas and stories about
     them, and trade, buy and sell them.  Commercial pricing and
     availability is NOT permitted.

     Links are available at 1:135/71 until the echo is backboned, which
     we hope will be very soon.

     A netmail to the above FidoNet node will link you up immediately!

     NOT the death of a friend!
     by Louie Gonsalves, 1:2808/100, sysop@phosphor.datasync.com

     ----------------------------------------------------------------

     NOT the death of a friend!

     I was saddened by the news of Clay Tannacore's (1:372/4) dog's
     death.  However, it is my opinion that Clay let his companion of
     years, Fido, to die.

     You see, Fido *is* a sick little pup... but he can't get better if
     we don't help him.  Fido is getting old, true, and there are other
     animals in town that are better looking, and bigger... but Fido is
     not ready for the gas just yet.

     Fido is NOT dying.  He's going through a rebellious period.  You
     remember those, right?  When you decided that enough was enough, and
     rebelled against your parents, your school.  Long hair, loud,
     strange music.

     Fido is rebelling.  It is rebelling against those that for so long
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 5                    5 May 1997


     have ignored him.  Fido is trying to get attention, and frankly, he
     needs all of it.

     Fido can be nursed back to health.  The first thing that must be
     done is make his masters realize that his last proper training was
     done in 1989...  his masters must realize that no longer dogs run at
     300 bits per second.  His masters MUST realize that things have
     changed.

     Only us, the folks that have taken Fido as a friend can help our
     sick dog's masters realize all that.

     Netmail the masters, email them, send them letters, what have you.

     The masters:

     Bob Satti (Z1C)
     David Nugent (FTSC Chair)
     And all the RC's and NC's.

     AND MOST IMPORTANTLY:  ALL THE NODES.

     It is time for action.  Or Fido will die.

     Or will it?

     Lock and Load: Guerilla Marketing for BBSes
     Robert Parson 1:3822/1

     I've spent the last twenty years writing for a living.  You'd think
     I'd know by now that I shouldn't entirely trust my spell checker when
     proofreading articles.  But that's what I did last time.  And of
     course, I found three errors when it was published in Fidonews.  (I
     checked, and they were indeed my mistakes, not the fault of Editor
     Chris Baker's).  I've learned my lesson.

     I know I promised we would discuss how to deal with journalists today.
     But the sun is out, the temperature is fairly warm and I need to whack
     the grass.  Instead, we'll take our modems for a walk.  Anything to
     get out of mowing.

     Good word of mouth is the key to growth.  But in order to get good
     word of mouth, you have to get the word out in the first place.  Last
     time, we talked about writing news releases.  While that's a good
     start, you can't rely on getting published or aired.  You have to find
     other ways to get the word out.

     A prime example of this is Apple Computer.  In the early to mid '80s,
     they came out with the revolutionary Macintosh.  But they didn't rely
     on getting good press.  Apple was out beating the bushes, scraping for
     every possible user.  Contrast this with the Amiga.  Another
     incredible system.  They also got good reviews in the media.  But it
     failed, in large part, because Commodore didn't proselytize (Apple is
     down, but I wouldn't count them out quite yet).

     So where does this fit in with your BBS?

     If you answered "Get out of the house" you win the grand prize.

     Sure, you will likely get some new callers, or attract a few old ones
     who haven't called in a while, by advertising your BBS on other BBS in
     the area.  But you are preaching to the converted.

     What we're looking for is fresh blood.  We're going hunting.  (How
     many different metaphors can I sneak into this article?)

     Today, I want you to procrastinate.  You can put off for another day
     adding yet another door game to the BBS, or tweaking the color in the
     bulletins.  Grab your business cards, put on some shades and hit the
     road.

     Amazingly enough, there are people EVERYWHERE!  Everytime you turn
     around, THERE'S ANOTHER ONE!  Okay, I'm being facetious here, but the
     point is you are going to have to get out and find new potential
     callers.  And springtime is the perfect time to find them.

     Your Chamber of Commerce probably publishes a monthly calendar of
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 7                    5 May 1997


     events or knows where to find one.  Try to get on their mailing list.
     It may not be possible to be placed on the mailing list unless you are
     a member, which is quite expensive.  Worst case:  you'll have to go
     down to the Chamber offices and get one.

     Right about now there are little arts and crafts shows popping up all
     over the place.  There are civic groups such as the Rotary and
     Exchange Clubs.  Kids groups such as the Boy Scouts or school
     carnivals.  We're getting set for the summer parade season.  Later
     this year, county fairs.  If there is some kind of public event going
     on, you have an opportunity to invite new folks to call your BBS.
     Make yourself available.

     Steve Prado, the Sysop of my friendly neighborhood BBS (Jackalope
     Junction 1:3822/1), has visited with the local Genealogical Society to
     talk about the genealogical echos he carries and how useful they would
     be for people researching their ancestors.

     In many cases, you can get involved in something at no cost.  Civic
     groups are always looking for speakers and could be an easy mark.  You
     may have to pop a few bucks for some events, such as a table at a
     county fair or an entry in a parade (now that's something I'd like to
     see:  a float for a BBS.  Maybe something like those flying creatures
     in the Macy's parade).

     If you have an annual picnic for users, invite the local media to come
     around.

     Now suppose you run into someone that doesn't know how to do anything
     other than call their local Internet Service Provider or one of the
     commercial services.  Make sure you are well versed enough in Windows
     Terminal to at least tell them how to log on.  It probably couldn't
     hurt to create a little fact sheet, or maybe even give them a disk
     that has the appropriate configuration (if you're like me, you've got
     disks to burn).  Once they get on, then you can get them set up with
     other comm programs and/or offline readers.

     No.  This is not easy work.  But you can't expect users to come
     running when they don't know you even exist.

     So stop reading right now and head out the do--*

     Hey!  Where'd everybody go!?

             gateway system.    In addition, all gateway software should
             recognize, by the message itself, whether it has EVER passed
             through the gateway in the past.   CRC records, SEEN-BY lines,
             PATH lines and MSGID lines are not sufficient for this purpose
             as most systems purge recorded logs of this info after a given
             time.

     InterDomain Echomail/Netmail Flags:
     -----------------------------------

     ^ADOMORG:
     usr.nme@[!][p.f.n.z.]network[.nid][[#nodelist_name][#point[x]]
     ^ADOMDES:
     usr.nme@[!][p.f.n.z.]network[.nid][[#nodelist_name][#point[x]]

             These lines would be a complete domain signature for any user
             on any system in any FTN network.

             The DOMORG line would be the actual origin information of the
             user and system sending the information.

             The DOMDES line would be the actual destination information of
             the recipient user and system.

             There are essentially two variations to the domain signature.
             The ! immediately following the @ denotes a Type B, otherwise
             defaulting to Type A.

             Type A:

                     e.g.  jamie.penner@f1025.n153.z1.fidonet

                     This has the complete FTN information needed for any
                     processor to send the message.

             Type B:

                     e.g.  jamie.penner@!signet.admin#ic.signet

                     The ! immediately preceeding the network signifies
                     that no FTN information is available but the
                     information after the # will give the name of the
                     system as denoted in the nodelist for that network.
                     This way, processors can be designed in a fashion that
                     they can look up the system name.    Should this be
                     going to a point, the domain may be:

                     jamie.penner@!signet.admin#ic.signet#point

                     If I have two points and I want to send it to a
                     different point, I might use:

                     jamie.penner@!signet.admin#ic.signet#point2
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 10                   5 May 1997


                     The domain identifier in a Type B signature can be
                     further used for further locating a system if needed.
                     In both signature types, the nid (network identifier)
                     is optional (eg fidonet.org or signet.admin - only the
                     first field actually identifies the network name).
                     This information is completely dependant upon each
                     domain.   For example I might send this:

                     rob.macare@!signet.eur.r331#maasstad.bbs

                     This kind of structure would get the message to the
                     right system.   If there was two of the same system in
                     Region 331, I could use:

                     rob.macare@!signet.eur.n4601#maasstad.bbs

             This format of domain signatures is provided solely for
             compatibility purposes to provide software developers with a
             platform on which they can structure new programming
             techniques and can be used in conjunction with the other flags
             as laid out in this document.

      # GateOrigin: zzz:NNN/nnn.ppp@dmn    (note leading space)

             This line is currently inserted into all stripped down
             echomail passing through interdomain gateways by GateWorks.
             This allows the message overhead to be cut down by properly
             replacing the origin line for users to read in the text yet,
             not creating a second full originline.   This line shall be
             added immediately before the tearline with a single blank line
             following it.

             e.g.    # GateOrigin: 24:24/0.0@signet

     ^AGATECHK: zzz.NNN.nnn.ppp [zzz.NNN.nnn.ppp] [zzz.NNN.nnn.ppp]
             Any echomail passing through a particular gateway should have
             this line inserted at the beginning of the message text.
             Everytime the message passes through another echomail gateway,
             the address would be added to the line.   This way, if a
             message passes back through with the same ID, it is a known
             duplicate and can be vaporized.

             e.g.    ^AGATECHK: 24.24.0.0 8.8.7001.0

     ^AMSGORG: <originating-address> <originating-ID>

             The MSGORG line keeps a standard original address and message
             id in the message for reply, identification, dupe checking,
             and origination purpose.    This line would vanish and be
             replaced with the necessary lines if passed through a gateway.

             e.g.    ^AMSGORG: 24:24/0.0@signet 0123456789abcdef

             The originating ID is no different than other 16 bit IDs being
             generated.   It must be unique in a sense that no other
             message originating from that system will have the same number
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 11                   5 May 1997


             (at least within a short time span).

     ^AGATEWAY: <zonegate-address>

             This field is inserted by the packer.   The user-defined
             zonegate fields give the message its destination to the
             zonegate and may be routed through whatever channels to get
             there.

             e.g.    ^AGATEWAY: 1:153/1025.0@fidonet.org

     ^GRPLY: <zonegate-address> <originating-address>

             When replying to a message, this line would be looked up so as
             to find the actual message destination and give the system its
             zonegate information.    If the message passes through a
             gateway, the MSGORG line would be removed upon insertion of
             this line.

             e.g.    ^AGRPLY: 1:153/1025@fidonet.org 24:24/0.0@signet

     An example echomail message from 24:11/7777.0@signet across the domain
     to 1:153/85.0@fidonet should read:

     An editor programmed to handle these fields would recognize GRPLY line
     and know that the message had passed through a gateway.    An echomail
     reply would simply pass through the gateway.   If a netmail reply was
     required, this would be the reply message:

     > Hi Bill, just testing out this new software

     Got it here!

     via InterMail @ 24:24/0.0@signet, 17:23:17  22 Jan 92

     The mailer and/or packer would check for the GATEWAY flag and route
     the message through that gateway.

     Under this method of flags, all systems in all domains should have
     access to the ability to reply via netmail to a system in a different
     domain.    In addition, by following this specification, all
     interdomain echomail should be clean and troublefree.   This
     eliminates the need for some of the other ^A lines being used.

     It is the intention that all addresses in these flags may use the 5d
     addressing scheme, or either of the Type A or B domain signatures.
     The software should be written to determine the type of address used
     and manipulate the situation accordingly.

     The following list of software may be incomplete but lists all
     software currently available or under development using this spec:

     Introduction:
     ============

     This document describes a type of mail packet called type 3 ASCII.
     Type 3 ASCII was designed with how Fidonet Technology Networks (FTNs)
     handle mail (netmail, echomail, groupmail) in mind.  It was also
     designed to allow new distribution methods to be introduced.  For
     instance, it is possible to combine the best of echomail and groupmail
     methods using type 3 ASCII packets.  Finally, type 3 ASCII provides
     reliability, space and speed advantages over the current mail packet
     type 2 (see "Type 3 ASCII vs. Type 2" section below).

     Packet structure:
     ================

     (See "Definitions" section below for the meaning of any arcane
     symbols)

     Type 3 ASCII packets and archived bundles will ride existing transport
     services (mailers) as attached files.  Type 2 mail and type 3 ASCII
     mail can both be sent to a node without conflicts.  Naturally, the
     receiving node should be able to process type 3 ASCII mail before it
     is sent.

     Type 3 ASCII packets are named <fileroot><.><3KT> when sent to a
     remote site. Archives containing type 3 packets are named
     <fileroot><.><3?A> when sent to remote sites.  How these files are
     stored or named locally is not within the scope of this document.

     A type 3 ASCII packet consists of a packet header, followed by a
     carriage return, followed by zero or more messages, followed by a NUL.
     A type 3 ASCII message consists of a message header, followed by a
     carriage return, followed by zero or more characters of message text,
     followed by a NUL.

     Diagramatically speaking,

             (Text in brackets [] indicates optional data)

     Breakdown:
     =========

             (See "Description of Fields" section below for information on
              individual fields.)

         ...
         [Tagn[<sp>datan]<cr>]

       Message body:
       ============

         Free-flowing, NUL-terminated text.  May be composed of any
         combination of ASCII characters > 31 (from the space character,
         ASCII character 32, onward) and may include <cr> as a "paragraph
         terminator."  Systems which display message text should wrap long
         lines to suit their application.

         To be in compliance with this document, implementations must be
         able to forward messages with at least 131,072 (128K) characters
         of text (including the terminating NUL).  Network politics may
         outlaw messages of lesser size, but that is beyond the scope of
         this document.  If a compliant implementation encounters a message
         longer than the 128K limit, it may truncate the message text
         before forwarding.  However, since it is easy to support messages
         of a length limited only by available disk space, it is encouraged
         that you do so and not impose artificial restrictions.  The
         purpose of this limit is to guarantee a minimum size that will be
         passed, _not_ to restrict implementations to the "minimum."

     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 15                   5 May 1997


         Line feeds (ASCII character 10) are reserved and should not
         normally appear in message text.  Future plans call for their use
         as "escape codes."  So called "soft carriage returns" (ASCII
         character 141) should not be contained in transmitted message text
         unless the actual character itself is desired.

         Tabs (ASCII character 9) should not be used in message text as
         their use often leads to unreadable messages.  How many spaces
         should be used at a remote site to represent them?

     Description of Fields:
     =====================

       Note:  the maximum length of any field line (excluding, of course,
              message text) is 255 characters including the terminating
              <cr>.  In practice, a bit of restraint should be practiced to
              keep fields as small as possible.  The maximum length of any
              header is 32767 bytes, including terminating <cr>.  In
              practice, this limit should never be approached.

       Date:
       ====

         YYYYMMDDhhmmss<optional time zone>

         where
           YYYY = year with century, as in 1991 or 2001
           MM   = month, as in 01 to 12

           ss   = second of minute, as in 00 to 59
           <optional time zone> = offset from GMT in 15 min. increments
                                  (i.e. "+4" (sans quotes) for GMT + one

       From and To:
       ===========

         The From field contains the writer's name followed by a valid FTN
         network address. For the purposes of this document and current
         implementations of type 3 ASCII packets, the format of a valid FTN
         network address is:

             Domain is a text string from 1 to 8 characters in length
             containing only alphabetical [A-Za-z] and/or numerical [0-9]
             characters.

             Zone is a decimal number from 1 to 65533.

             Node is a decimal number from 0 to 65533.

             Point is a decimal number from 0 to 65535 (may be omitted if
                                                        0).

           The FTSC or whatever body guards tech specs may change this
           definition in the future as it sees fit.

         The full format of a type 3 ASCII From or To field is:

         [User Name<@>]Domain<#>Zone<:>Net</>Node[<.>Point]

         If User Name<@> is missing, assume user name is Sysop.  User Name
         may be composed of any combination of ASCII characters > 31 (from
         the space character, ASCII character 32, onward) excluding <@>.

         If <.>point is missing, assume point 0.

         The To field contains the recepient's name and address as above.
         The To field is optional.  If it is missing, message/packet is
         broadcast mail (no definite, single recipient).  In this case
         there must be an area (if the To field is omitted in the packet
         header, there must be an area in the packet header and all
         messages must be broadcast mail for that area.  If omitted in the
         message header, the message or the packet must have an area and
         message may be displayed as being addressed to "All@Anywhere").  A
         <cr> must still be present as a "space holder."  In broadcast
         mail, it is permissible to give only the name of the user (without
         following address) in a message header; however, the name must end
         with <@> (to distinguish it from an address with no User Name).
         Note this means a single broadcast mail packet can be sent to many
         nodes.

         The From field is required.

         In the case of From and To fields in the packet header,
         [user name<@>] is probably unimportant.

         In the interests of saving space, domains such as "Fidonet.org"
         should be replaced with just "Fidonet," as the ".org" modifier has
         no meaning to an FTN site.  Domains should be treated case
         insensitively.

         Sample:   John Doe@Fidonet#1:380/16
                     (User "John Doe" in domain "Fidonet" zone 1 net 380
                      node 16, implied point 0)

       =======

         Name of the product that produced the packet.  This field is
         required.

       Password:
       ========

         A password to use for security.  This field is optional.  If
         omitted, a <cr> must still be present as a "space holder."  How
         this field is used is implementation-defined.

       Subject:
       =======

         The subject field should contain text hinting at the subject of
         the message text.  It may be composed of any combination of ASCII
         characters > 31 (from the space character, ASCII character 32,
         onward).  The subject field is optional.  If omitted, a <cr> must
         still be present as a "space holder."

       Area:
       ====

         Area fields consist of a string of alphanumeric characters plus
         space, "-" and "_" (ASCII characters 32, 45 and 95 respectively).
         Area fields are optional with the following consequences:

           If the area field in a packet header is missing, the messages in
           the packet will have area fields present for broadcast mail,
           omitted for personal mail.

           If the area field in a packet header is present, all the
           messages in the packet will be broadcast mail for the area
           specified in the packet header.  The message area fields will
           not be present.

         When an area field is omitted, a <cr> must still be present as a
         "space holder."

       ID:
       ==

         An ID consists of the originating address of the message plus a
         serial number, in the form:

           origaddr<sp>serialno

          The originating address should be specified in a form that
          constitutes a valid return address for the originating network.
          If the originating address is enclosed in double-quotes,  the
          entire string between the beginning and ending double-quotes is
          considered to be the orginating address.  A double-quote
          character within a quoted address is represented by by two
          consecutive double-quote characters.  The serial number may be
          any eight character hexadecimal number,  as long as it is unique
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 18                   5 May 1997


          - no two messages from a given system may have the same serial
          number within one year.  The manner in which this serial number
          is generated is left to the implementor.

            Notes:  The "old" format of
                      Zone<:>Net</>Node[<.>Point][<@>Domain]
                    for FTN addresses is allowed in this field.

                    The address portion of the ID may be omitted if it is
                    exactly the same as the From address (less User
                    Name<@>).  In this case, the ID field should begin with
                    a space followed immediately by the serial number.

                    In the case of foreign network addresses, this address
                    gives you the "true" origin, and the From address gives
                    you the gateway at which the message entered FTN
                    territory.  This allows you to gate replies to
                    "foreign" sites.


              Samples:  some.other.net.addr ABCDEF12
                         12345ABC

              (Assume From field of second sample contained
               "Joe Blow@Fidonet#1:380/16",so complete constructed ID would
               be Fidonet#1:380/16 12345ABC
               Note address would be copied exactly from the From field.)

         The ID field is required.

       Ref:
       ===

         A Ref consists of the ID of the original message to which this
         message refers (usually as a reply).

              Sample:   Fidonet#1:380/16 12345ABC
                        (would reference the second ID sample above)

         The reference field is optional.  If omitted, a <cr> must still be
         present as a "place holder."

       Tag<sp>Data:
       ===========

         The tag+data lines are type 3 ASCII's method of automatically
         expanding its headers.  A tag consists of a sequence of uppercase
         alphabetic (A-Z inclusive) and/or numeric sequence of characters
         and possibly a hyphen (ASCII character 45) and/or underline (ASCII
         character 95), up to 12 characters in length (a name).  A tag name
         can be followed optionally by a space (ASCII character 32) and
         data.  Data may be composed of any combination of ASCII characters
         > 31 (from the space character, ASCII character 32, onward).

         To aid in developer experimentation with tags in type 3 ASCII, it
         is guaranteed that the FTSC or whatever body guards tech specs
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 19                   5 May 1997


         will never "canonize" a tag beginning with the two characters "X-"
         (ASCII character 88 followed immediately by ASCII character 45).
         Thus, tags may use this combination before tag names to guarantee
         uniqueness.

         Experimental tags may be stripped by conforming implementations
         during message passthrough.  This helps prevent experimental tags
         from escaping from test sites.

           Samples (tag names are invented):

             FOLLOW AFILEN.AME
             X-TAG SOMEDATA
             LONETAG

         Tag<sp>data fields are optional and may be completely omitted when
         creating a packet.  Exception:  all tag<sp>data fields except,
         possibly, experimental fields, should be passed through with a
         message being forwarded.

         Predefined tags:
         ===============

         Tag         Where         Data        Meaning
         ---         -----         ----        -------
         PRIV        Msg Hdr       None        Message is private
         FOROK       Pkt Hdr       None        Packet may be forwarded
                                               without unpacking -- all
                                               messages are
                                               to the To: address in the
                                               packet header

     Type 3 ASCII vs. Type 2:
     =======================

     Type 3 ASCII saves between 6% to 11% in raw packet size over type 2
     (using Tiny Seenbys with the type 2 packets to make the test as fair
     as possible), depending on how area tags for echos are used in the
     type 3 ASCII packet (in packet header vs. message headers).  7%
     smaller would be the norm for the way we do echomail business now.
     The tests conducted were most unscientific but should be close to
     everyday echomail-oriented reality.

     Compressed packets are a slightly different story.  Type 3 ASCII
     compresses the same as type 2 when using area tags for echos in the
     message headers.  Type 2 compresses approximately 2.5% better when
     area tags are used in the type 3 ASCII packet headers instead.  Either
     way, compressed type 3 ASCII packets are smaller than comparable type
     2 packets due to the smaller raw packet size.  Even compression ratios
     would be the norm for the way we do echomail business now.

     Type 3 ASCII imports between 2% to 5% faster (depending on algorithms
     used).  There is no discernable difference on export.  Keep in mind
     that this particular test has too many variables (software, hardware,
     relative efficiency of code, etc.) to be considered a real benchmark.
     Most of the speed savings is in not having to process SEEN-BY and PATH
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 20                   5 May 1997


     lines.  The lack of end-of-text control information is a real boon.

     Type 2 has no method for reliably obtaining the full 5-D origin
     address of a message.  Type 3 ASCII provides a reliable method of
     obtaining full origin address information for both the true origin (in
     whatever network) and the gateway which brought the message into FTN
     territory (if from a foreign network).  This means that even if a
     message originated in a network with which your software has no idea
     how to communicate, you can still send a reply to an FTN node for
     gating.

     Type 2 has no reliable method for stopping dupes.  Type 3 ASCII has a
     mandatory ID field, very similar to type 2's optional MSGID, which can
     be used for reliable dupe checking.

     Type 2 echomail has control information scattered throughout the
     message body, including SEEN-BY and PATH information at the end of the
     message.  This causes problems for developers, who often opt for
     fixed-length buffers and arbitrary message length limits.  All control
     information for Type 3 ASCII is in the extensible message header.
     Moreover, type 3 ASCII has generous set limits to which programmers
     can work, and which users can therefore rely on.

     Definitions:
     ===========

       Except where noted otherwise, numbers are in decimal.

       Although the ASCII character set is normally defined as being
       limited to characters from 0 to 127, this document acknowledges the
       existence of an eighth bit in most bytes and uses the term (loosely)
       to mean characters from 0-255.  Network politics may or may not
       "outlaw" the use of some of those bytes; that is outside the scope
       of this document.

       Note:  text in brackets [] indicates an optional field.  See
              "Definitions" section below for meaning of text in <>.  See

     Miscellaneous notes:
     ===================

     jim nutt invented MSGIDs and REPLYids (ref. FTS-0009), which were
     lifted very nearly whole to become IDs and Refs in this document.  Tom
     Jennings invented Fido and Fidonet <tm and stuff> from whole cloth and
     RAM chips.  NET_DEV's continual foolishness inspired me to do instead
     of whine.  Let's see if this cuts down on the whining...

     Preliminary specifications for type 3 binary mail format:
     ========================================================

     Type 3 binary is a new form of mail for Fidonet Technology Networks
     (FTN).

     The basic unit of type 3 binary mail is a chunk.  A chunk looks like
     this:

         +-------------------------------------+
         | 2-byte integer length (type + data) | (A 2-byte integer is
         +-------------------------------------+  a signed integer in
         | 2-byte integer type                 |  Intel format, giving
         +-------------------------------------+  a length range of
         | length - 2 of data                  |  2-32767 (0 is unused))
         +-------------------------------------+

     Predefined chunk types:
     ======================
      Mnemonic  VAL Where  Data format
      --------  --- -----  -----------

     *EOP       0    PKT   None
     *FROM      1   BOTH   FTN address in packet, name + FTN address in msg
      TO        2   BOTH   [FTN address in packet,] name + [FTN address] in
                           msg
      SUBJECT   3    MSG   Text
     *ID        4    MSG   4-byte long integer
      REF       5    MSG   4-byte long integer followed by FTN address
     *DATE      6    MSG   Packed date
      ATTRIB    7   BOTH   2-byte integer (bit field)

     A type 3 binary packet always begins with a single byte containing the
     binary number 3.  This is followed by the first chunk.  A packet
     "header" is composed of all chunks until the first MSG chunk is
     encountered.  A header should contain at least a FROM chunk, either a
     TO chunk or an AREA chunk, and a PRODUCT chunk.  PASSWORD, ORIG and
     ATTRIB chunks might also be used.

     The rest of the "specs" can be gleaned or clarified from the (working)
     code included in the 3bcsrc.lzh archive.  Personally, I don't think
     this type of packet is much suited to FTN mail; too much of what we do
     is text oriented.  But here it is, to possibly get your tails moving
     (or convince you that type 2 or type 3 ASCII is more what we need).
     The main reasons for the 3binary archive are to show you I've done my
     homework, to give working examples of the "other type" of type 3 mail
     some folks advocate, and for comparison to type 3 ASCII and type 2.

          community, and requests discussion and suggestions for

          Software.

     MSGTO:  This kludge line, together with a MSGID: kludge (see FTS-
             0009), would provide full address specs for both the
             originating and destination nodes of a netmail message (MSGTO
             should _not_ be used in echo mail).  Its format is simple:
               ^aMSGTO: <FTN address>
             MSGTO (coupled with MSGID) would eliminate the need for the
             INTL, FMPT, TOPT and DOMAIN kludges.  A MSGTO kludge line
             should go just below any MSGID and REPLY kludge lines.  See
             also discussion on FTN address representation below.

     ASSOC:  ASSOC introduces a filename that should follow the message (is
             associated with the message). Format is, again, simple:
               ^aASSOC: <filename>
             A message tosser would forward the file along with the
             message, if so configured for the AREA: of the message
             (assuming echomail) or other criteria.  Paths would probably
             not be useful in the <filename> field and should not normally
             be included or used if found to be present.  ASSOC kludge
             lines should go below any addressing kludge lines.

     SPTH:   Clint Adams described this as a "5D, sensible order, top-of-
             the-message path" line.  I like that.  Stands for "Sticky
             PaTH."  SPTH displaces the current PATH line.  Instead of
             being located at the bottom of the message, it's located at
             the top of the message.  Instead of being 2-D (net/node), it's
             5-D (domain#zone:net/node.point).  It's sticky like a normal
             PATH line so that the size doesn't get outrageous.  Because
             it's 5-D instead of 2-D it can be used for dupe checking
             (which a normal 2-D PATH line cannot; is 1/1 Fidonet#1:1/1 or
             Dufusnet#2:1/1?).  Because it's 5-D we would no longer have to
             go through hideous gyrations when gating echo mail from one
             domain to another; just let it flow.  Using SPTH it becomes
             trivial to cut SEEN-BYs down to Tiny Seenbys (only required
             for backward compatibility with old mail processors that barf
             without some SEEN-BYs, and to protect fully enclosed polygon
             topology).

             SPTH is to be used only in echo mail.  It's format is
             basically:

                 ^aSPTH: <address> <address> ... <address>

             SPTH lines, like PATH lines, contain only addresses of mail
             processors that actually processed the message.  SPTH lines
             are specifically not sorted and are "sticky" so that they
             carry the least amount of information that will convey a full
             address when coupled with preceding addresses.  For example,
             if 1:380/16.0@Fidonet, 1:380/16.1@Fidonet,
             1:380/100.0@Fidonet, 1:396/100.0@Fidonet, 2:4177/1.0@Fidonet
             and 2:4177/1.0@Othernet processed a message, in that order,
             you'd have:
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 26                   5 May 1997


              ^aSPTH: Fidonet#1:380/16 .1 100 :396 #2:4177/1 Othernet

             Note that point 0 is assumed if missing and that punctuation
             *precedes* an address element except in the case of a domain
             change (and when the net element is the first change -- this
             dictates that domain names begin with an alphabetical
             character).  This compacts SPTH entries as much as possible
             for most typical topologies.

             When an SPTH-aware processor forwards a message containing (a)
             PATH line(s) but no SPTH line(s), it should create a new SPTH
             line (or lines as required; SPTH lines shouldn't get longer
             than 80 characters, including terminating carriage return)
             containing "fleshed-out" addresses from the PATH line(s), then
             add itself.  If this is done at all zone/domain gates, the
             SPTH will always be current even if intermediate nodes are not
             SPTH-aware.  In the event an SPTH-aware processor receives a
             message containing both SPTH line(s) and PATH line(s), it
             should concatenate the "fleshed-out" addresses from the PATH
             line(s) to the SPTH line(s), then add itself.  The PATH
             line(s) may then be discarded from the message.  When
             exporting new messages, only a SPTH line should be created; no
             PATH line should be generated.  Tiny Seenbys should be added
             at the end of the message for the reasons noted above.

     Note that all the kludge lines above are in actual use and have been
     for some time; they do work, and work as presented.  Code is available
     on request, but implementation is trivial (only SPTH takes any real
     work at all).

     FTN address representation:
     ==========================

     The current convention for representing an FTN address has become:

         zone:net/node[.point]@domain

     I propose we change this to:

         domain#zone:net/node[.point]

     Why?  It's all in one order, highest to lowest; it's consistent.  "@"
     is used, in the former method, in a way rather opposed to normal usage
     in network addressing.

     While we're on the subject of domains, let's knock off using
     "fidonet.org" in FTN addresses.  That only means something in
     Internet.  It's going to gum up the works for FTN domains, where we'll
     want things like "fidonet.eu" to mean Fidonet Europe some day.

     I'm done now.

     Holy Moley! The latest chapter in the Internet Explorer Security Hole
     of the Day saga from www.winsources.com:

     Norton Utilities, Internet Explorer Combo Puts Systems in Harm's Way
     (by Jesse Berst)

     Combination of NU 2.0 for Windows 95 and Internet Explorer 3.x
     highlights security weaknesses in ActiveX controls

     Your worst fears have come true. McAfee Associates has discovered, and
     Windows Sources has confirmed, a flaw in the underlying architecture
     of Internet Explorer and Windows 95 that renders users of the Web
     vulnerable to a range of catastrophes. These disasters range from an
     involuntary reformatting of your hard drive to breach of information
     once thought to be secure.

     Users running the combination of Windows 95, Internet Explorer 3.x,
     and Symantec's Norton Utilities 2.0 for Windows 95, one of the most
     popular and widely used software utility products for Windows 95, are
     currently known to be at risk.  (In the spirit of disclosure, users
     should be aware that McAfee Associates and Symantec Corp. are
     competitors in the utilities and anti-virus software market.)

     Neither Verisign's Authenticode (which is built-in to Internet
     Explorer) or recent IE security patches posted on Microsoft's Web site
     offer any protection. According to Reston, VA-based research firm PC
     Data, 143,559 licenses have been issued for Norton Utilities, and
     125,825 users have Internet Explorer. The number of users who have
     actually deployed both at the same time is unknown.

     The problem lies in TUNEOCX.OCX, a core component of Norton Utilities'
     System Genie. When installed, this OCX is marked as scriptable, which
     allows ActiveX-aware Web page scripts to make use of this ActiveX
     control. This control supports a "run" option that allows the script
     to execute any local application, such as the FORMAT or FTP (net-based
     file transfer) commands.
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 29                   5 May 1997


     Windows Sources analysis of Norton Utilities found that this component
     essentially granted unauthorized access to any system resource that is
     normally accessible from the desktop itself. As a result, any
     programmer with access to one of Microsoft's scripting tools
     (VBScript, MS C++, Visual C++, Visual J++, etc.) can leverage this
     control to perform any task on the target system -- unbeknownst to the
     system's user.

     For example, a Web page hacker could build a page that, when viewed by
     Internet Explorer, runs a few lines of VBScript code that wipes out a
     hard drive, installs a Trojan horse, or invokes file transfer and
     directory utilities to retrieve confidential information. Worse yet,
     all these tasks could be performed in the background without the user
     ever knowing what's happening to their system.

     Verisign's Authenticode, billed by Microsoft as a protection mechanism
     built into Internet Explorer that allows users to intervene before
     potentially dangerous code is downloaded, is ineffective against this
     sort of invasion. That's because Authenticode watches for software
     that's about to be downloaded, but not VBScripts that activate
     software components that are already installed on the system (e.g.:
     TUNEOCX.OCX).

     Although the aforementioned combination of software is currently the
     only known group at risk, there could be other combinations of
     application and ActiveX-based browsers that are equally vulnerable.

     The smoking gun in this example is Norton Utilities 2.0, but NU simply
     exposes an important and oft-debated feature/weakness in Microsoft's
     ActiveX architecture. Other products that are already deployed en
     masse could be "offering" the same service to those with malicious
     intent.

     In tests, Windows Sources found the same combination running on
     Windows NT (including the NT-based version of NU) to be safe.
     HealthyPC, another PC tune-up utility from Symantec also tested safe
     at Windows Sources.

     SYMANTEC, MICROSOFT RESPOND

     According to Symantec Sr. Product Manager Tom Andrus, "It is a
     problem. We know how serious it is. But we think that it is very
     uncommon. To our knowledge, there are no Norton Utilities users in the
     world that have run into this."

     To Symantec's credit, Norton Utilities 2.0 includes a feature called
     Live Update that automatically updates a user's system with new
     drivers and software, when that system is connected to the Internet.
     "We've worked out a fix and it's in the hands of our quality assurance
     group right now," said Andrus. "By this afternoon, a fix will be up
     on-line so that any PC that connects to the Internet while running
     Live Update will be automatically fixed so as not to allow this
     again." For more information, users can go to www.symantec.com.

     Microsoft sought to put this situation in a more positive light,
     highlighting the ability to quickly fix the problem rather than the
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 30                   5 May 1997


     problem itself.

     "The fact that [Symantec] could fix it so quickly is a major testament
     to the flexibility of the ActiveX architecture," said Microsoft
     Program Marketing Manager Cornelius Willis. "Yes, this is a threat but
     there are so many threats. Vendors can mark off-the-shelf software
     safe-to-script or not-safe-to-script. For example, Microsoft Excel is
     marked not-safe-to-script because it has access to system resources.
     Therefore Excel is invulnerable to such attack. VBScript and
     JavaScript will only instantiate controls that are marked safe-to-
     script and this was one of them."

     "Plug-ins (a la Netscape's Navigator) have no digital certificates or
     safe-to-script toggles and we feel that ActiveX is the only
     architecture that offers any kind of accountability for downloaded
     software," added Willis.

     But, in Windows Sources tests of the Norton Utilities example, ActiveX
     offered no opportunity to engage this accountability since it involved
     a script acting against an already installed component (from shrink-
     wrapped software) rather than the downloading of software.

     SOLVING THE PROBLEM

     There are preventative measures users can take to protect themselves.
     Following one of these five steps will help protect your system from
     the effects of the toxic software combination:

     1)  Download the patch from Symantec
     2)  Uninstall Norton Utilities
     3)  Disable support for ActiveX-scripting in Internet Explorer
     4)  Switch to a non-ActiveX-based browser such as
           Netscape's Navigator,
     5)  Stay off the Net.

     Be warned also that, going forward, addressing the problem through
     Norton Utilities is not a complete fix. Downloading a patch or
     uninstalling NU will not protect a system if other equally vulnerable
     software is already installed. Additionally, disabling ActiveX
     scripting or switching to a non-ActiveX browser may disable other web-
     and ActiveX-based applications. Manually disabling Norton Utilities
     without uninstalling it is unlikely to safeguard the system and
     therefore is not recommended.

     Corporate sites that use Windows 95's centralized policy management
     features may also disable the ability to run Internet Explorer
     throughout their local area networks. Unfortunately, the same policy
     management feature doesn't provide centralized management of Internet
     Explorer's run options, making it impossible to reach across corporate
     nets and just disable support for ActiveX scripting.

     Finally, for those who are really paranoid, switching to Windows NT
     might be one last measure of assurance. Under Windows NT, software
     cannot be executed without a security token that authenticates the
     code's privileges to the system's resources. Such code usually
     inherits the rights of the user sitting at the machine, thus limiting
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 31                   5 May 1997


     intruding code to only the resources the user has rights to access.
     Provided that the user doesn't have administrator-level rights, the
     malicious code's impact could be far less catastrophic.

     For further discussion on this important issue, ask questions and
     express your opinions in the ActiveX Expert Answers Forum."

     Although no bill is perfect, Internet advocates including CDT, EFF,
     EPIC, VTW and others, including the Internet Privacy Coalition, have
     expressed support for the bill.  Supporters agree that the SAFE bill
     holds great promise for enhancing privacy and security on the Internet
     and have offered their strong support and suggestions to improve it in
     a detailed letter at http://www.privacy.org/ipc/safe_letter.html

     BACKGROUND ON SAFE (HR 695)

     In early May, the Judiciary Committee will be voting on whether to
     send HR 695, the Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act,
     on to the full House of Representatives.

     The SAFE Bill, introduced by Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Anna Eshoo
     (D-CA), would promote privacy and security on the Internet by:

     * relaxing current export controls on encryption technologies;

     * prohibiting the government from imposing "key-escrow" or "key-
       recovery" inside the United States, and;

     * addresses concerns from law enforcement about the use of encryption
       in the furtherance of a crime.

     The SAFE bill enjoys broad bi-partisan support and currently has 78
     co-sponsors.

     Although no bill is ever perfect, the SAFE bill, along with Pro-CODE,
     a similar bill in the Senate sponsored by Sens. Burns (R-MT) and Leahy
     (D-VT), represent the best chance yet of passing real reform of US
     encryption policy.  The Senate Commerce Committee is expected to hold
     a markup on Pro-CODE soon.

     The Clinton Administration, through the FBI and NSA, is working hard
     behind the scenes to block passage of SAFE and Pro-CODE. The
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 49                   5 May 1997


     Administration favors an approach which would limit the availability
     of privacy-protecting encryption technologies and compel American
     Citizens to ensure law enforcement access to their private online
     communications.

     By passing the SAFE bill and sending on to the floor, the House
     Judiciary Committee will send a strong signal to the Administration
     that Congress is serious about passing real reform of US encryption
     policy, and would represent an important victory in the fight for
     privacy on the Internet.

     Detailed background information, including the full text of the bill,
     and analysis is available online at http://www.crypto.com/

     ______________________________________________________________________
     WHY IS THIS ISSUE IMPORTANT TO INTERNET USERS?

     Encryption technologies are the locks and keys of the Information age
     -- enabling individuals and businesses to protect sensitive
     information as it is transmitted over the Internet. As more and more
     individuals and businesses come online, the need for strong, reliable,
     easy-to-use encryption technologies has become a critical issue to the
     health and viability of the Net.

     Current US encryption policy, which limits the strength of encryption
     products US companies can sell abroad, also limits the availability of
     strong, easy-to-use encryption technologies in the United States. US
     hardware and software manufacturers who wish to sell their products on
     the global market must either conform to US encryption export limits
     or produce two separate versions of the same product, a costly and
     complicated alternative.

     The export controls, which the NSA and FBI argue help to keep strong
     encryption out of the hands of foreign adversaries, are having the
     opposite effect. Strong encryption is available abroad, but because of
     the export limits and the confusion created by nearly four years of
     debate over US encryption policy, strong, easy-to-use privacy and
     security technologies are not widely available off the shelf or "on
     the net" here in the US.

     A recently discovered flaw in the security of the new digital
     telephone network exposed the worst aspects of the Administration's
     encryption policy.  Because the designers needed to be able to export
     their products, the system's security was "dumbed down".  Researchers
     subsequently discovered that it is quite easy to break the security of
     the system and intrude on what should be private conversations.

     This incident underscores the larger policy problem: US companies are
     at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace when competing
     against companies that do not have such hindrances.  And now, for the
     first time in history, the Clinton Administration has proposed
     DOMESTIC RESTRICTIONS on the ability of Americans to protect their
     privacy and security online.

     All of us care about our national security, and no one wants to make
     it any easier for criminals and terrorists to commit criminal acts.
     FIDONEWS 14-18               Page 50                   5 May 1997


     But we must also recognize encryption technologies can aid law
     enforcement and protect national security by limiting the threat of
     industrial espionage and foreign spying, promote electronic commerce
     and protecting privacy.

     What's at stake in this debate is nothing less than the future of
     privacy and the fate of the Internet as a secure and trusted medium
     for commerce, education, and political discourse.
