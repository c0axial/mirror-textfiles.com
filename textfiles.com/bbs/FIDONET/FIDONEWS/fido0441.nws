     =================================================================
                                 ARTICLES
     =================================================================

     Travis Good, 102/851

                          Building the LATINO Net

     Have you noticed what's been happening in  the  NodeList  lately?
     Other  than  continued growth,  a second phenomenon is that we've
     been getting nodes from Latin America.  There are  now  nodes  in
     Puerto Rico,  Argentina, and Suriname (OK trivia experts, where's
     "Suriname"?).

        Juan Davila of San Juan,  Puerto Rico (18/3 soon to be  367/0)
        says  that though there are only two nodes presently in Puerto
        Rico he already sees 5 to 6 more by year-end.

        Pablo  Kleinman of Buenos Aires (18/5) shows that Argentina is
        really on the ball.  Just last week he wrote  Ken  Kaplan  and
        got  four  nodes  added  to  the  list in one shot.  Growth in
        Argentina is expected to take off too.

     So why all this sudden interest?  One reason  might  be  that  La
     Nacion  ("South  America's  New  York  Times" according to Pablo)
     recently published the history  of  the  FidoNet  in  their  Home
     Computing     section.     Another    is    that    international
     telecommunications is  finally  past  the  stage  of  being  cost
     prohibitive.  What ever the reasons it's a healthy development.

     Could  Zone  4  be  far off?  Only time will tell but in the mean
     time we can do things to raise the Latin  American  participation
     level.  At  the end of this article I have two specific questions
     to ask of anyone interested in helping the effort.

     Below are some ideas on what might be done.  These are  presented
     in hopes that some of you might be interested in pursuing some of
     them.

     Regular E-mail Link
     ===================
     Outbound  and  inbound  gates  through which to channel all Latin
     American traffic to the U.S.  need to be established.  As part of
     this  it would probably make sense to do an analysis of just what
     routing was cheapest;  e.g.  a call during National Mail Hour  to
     Argentina  from  the  U.S.  using  MCI  costs $1.55 for the first
     minute plus $0.66 for each additional minute.  Probably far  less
     than  what it costs for Argentina to initiate phone calls.  Since
     we're all hobbyists we should try to keep costs down, no?

     Spanish-language Echo
     =====================
     This would be a means by which interested people could  find  out
     about  FidoNet  and  new nodes could get questions answered about
     participating in the Net.  This echo would be a takeoff point and
     would hopefully spawn other Spanish-language echos.
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 2                    9 Nov 1987


     We're in the  early  stages  of  establishing  a  three-hub  echo
     network.  Pablo  for  South America,  Juan for Caribbean,  and my
     node (102/851) for the Southwest.  Of course,  this is  just  the
     beginning and we would hope that it eventually will include every
     Latin American country.

     FidoNews Articles
     =================
     Having  something printed in the weekly FidoNews is a good way of
     elevating awareness within the  FidoNet  community.  If  articles
     were  published  promoting  the Spanish-language echo,  advancing
     growth of the LATINO Net,  and occassionally written  in  Spanish
     the  network  world  would certainly become more cognizant of the
     effort.

     IFNA Promotion Literature in Spanish
     ====================================
     Some of the key IFNA  literature  needs  to  be  translated  into
     Spanish  for potential Latin American members to understand about
     the network and the organization.  Without some decent reading it
     will be hard for people to get too enthused.

     Pablo,  Juan and I want to do what we can to help the  Net  grow.
     We hope you'll join us.  Give us your ideas, take on some role of
     your own, and jump on the wagon.

     OK, now for the end of the article and my two questions:

     1) Can anyone provide additional names of people in Latin America
        who might be interested in  joining  the  Net?  We'd  like  at
        least  one  node  in  each  major  city  in  each Spanish- and
        Portuguese-speaking country.  Having  this  would  get  us  to
        critical mass and the Latino Net can grow by itself.

     2) Anyone  out  there  interested  in participating in a Spanish-
        language echo?  There's a lot of curve climbing that needs  to
        be  done  and  we would use all the expertise we can get.  The
        LATINO echo will be available in the U.S. from 102/851.

     For further information or for feedback please contact any of the
     three of us.  We're all available during Mail Hour and soon  will
     all be up 24 hours per day.

     Brad Hicks
     Director-at-Large, IFNA
     Sysop WeirdBase, 1:100/523

     Since discussion has been solicited on Policy4,  here are my full
     comments  on  the subject.  Each section that will consist of the
     section number,  original  quote,  my  comment,  and  a  proposed
     revision  if  any.  These  are  emphatically  =not=  the official
     positions of the board of directors,  but these are some  of  the
     issues  being  discussed  in  IFNA_BOD  echo.  Make your feelings
     known to me or to any member of the Board of Directors.

                            --------------------

     SECTION 1.1     The Levels of FidoNet

     "o  Nodes;   A  node is a single  FidoNet address,  and  is  the
         smallest recognized unit of FidoNet.

     o   Points;  A  point is a node on  a private network  which  is
         accessible through a node on FidoNet."

     COMMENTARY:  Smallest?  Not an ideal word, especially since some
     very  popular  BBS's  have more users than some of  the  smaller
     nets.  Could also  be perjorative.   And in fact,  with sub-sub-
     points  available with PointMap,  it's no longer quite true.   A
     node is,  however,  the primary building-block of the  published
     nodelist.  I also think  it  might be nice if we said  something
     more about bulletin-board systems in these definitions, so as to
     put things in  terms  that  even  non-FidoNet  folk  can  have a
     referent, something to get a handle on what we're talking about.

     SUGGESTION:

     "o  Nodes;  A node is a single address in the international node
         list, the most basic building block of FidoNet.   It usually
         corresponds to a single bulletin board system.

     o    Points;  A  point is a system which sends or receives  mail
         through  a  node,  and is not independently  listed  in  the
         international node list.   As such,  there are fewer demands
         upon such a system.  A point usually corresponds to a single
         user of a bulletin board system."

                           --------------------

     SECTION 1.2     Coordinators

     "o   The  Point Coordinator;  Any node in FidoNet can act  as  a
         gateway to a point network.  ...

     o   The Sysop; A Sysop formulates his own policy for running his
         board  and  dealing  with his users,  so that  will  not  be
         discussed in this document.  ..."

     COMMENTARY:   Excuse  me if  I seem obsessed  with  definitions.
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 4                    9 Nov 1987


     First  of all,  I  cannot think of a single reason why these two
     paragraphs shouldn't  be merged.   Secondly,  what exactly is  a
     sysop?   Does a mail-only node have a sysop?  How about a point?
     Could it be that we should drop the word?   I  also see no point
     whatsoever in discussing at this point in the document what will
     not  be  discussed.   If it's not  to  be discussed,  let's  not
     discuss it!

     SUGGESTION:

     "o  The Node Coordinator (Sysop): Anyone who actually operates a
         node  on   the   FidoNet  is a  Node  Coordinator.   A  Node
         Coordinator is responsible for his own network mail and that
         of  any points below him,  or users on his node if he or she
         is a system operator."

                           --------------------

     CHAPTER 2       SYSOP PROCEDURES

     "A sysop of an individual node can pretty much do as he pleases,
     as long as he ...  is not excessively annoying to other nodes on
     FidoNet,  and  does  not   promote the  distribution  of pirated
     copyrighted software."

     COMMENTARY:   We still  haven't defined "excessively  annoying."
     We  need  to  do so -- or at least give  better  examples.   Are
     bombing runs "excessively annoying?"  (I think so.)   Is sending
     advertising  un-solicited?   (I think so.)   How about insulting
     another sysop?  (I think not.)  Racism, sexism, or bigotry?  How
     about censorship?   (Let's discuss these.)  And then there's the
     whole issue of echomail conduct ...   And then there's the  fact
     that  pirating copyrighted software is not the ONLY  crime  that
     can be perpetuated by a BBS.  Does this imply that we'll wink at
     fraud?  Chain-letter or pyramid schemes?

     SUGGESTION:

     "...  is not excessively annoying to other nodes on FidoNet (see
     section  x.x.x  below  for guidelines),  and does  not  use  the
     FidoNet for  the commission of a crime,  such as distribution of
     pirated software."

                           --------------------

     CHAPTER 2       SYSOP PROCEDURES

     "National Mail  Hour is the heart of FidoNet,  as this  is  when
     network mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes
     to be  a  part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail  at  this
     time.   ...   Failure  to  observe the  proper  mail  events  is
     sufficient  grounds  for  any  node to be dropped  from  FidoNet
     without  notice  (since  notice is generally  given  by  FidoNet
     mail). ..."

     COMMENTARY:   Now that the use of Points makes possible  special
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 5                    9 Nov 1987


     gateways,  I  think this is  even more  important than ever.   I
     stand 110% four-squarely behind these paragraphs.  Now ... do we
     want  to  go farther?   Consider the existence of nodes with  no
     listed phone  number.    (1)  Since no one can call them without
     making  special arrangements,  do they need to observe NMH?   On
     the other hand,   (2)  since they cannot be called directly,  do
     they have any place in  the  nodelist?   One area where  I  feel
     particularly  strongly  about  this is unlisted nodes not  in  a
     network, since there is effectively no way to send mail to these
     people - so why list them at all?

                           --------------------

     SECTION 2.1     How to get a node number

     "Your  application  for  a  node  number  must  be  sent  to the
     coordinator by  FidoNet  mail,  and must include  at  least  the
     following:

         1) Your name.
         ...
         6) The maximum baud rate you can support."

     COMMENTARY:   As a person who finds Bob Hoffman's use of another
     machine to  mimic  the  one he wanted,  thereby  requesting  two
     separate  node  numbers   from  the  same  machine,  excessively
     annoying,  I  would add to this "...  directly from the  machine
     requesting the address,  ..."  It also occurs to me that this is
     an   excellent  place   to  enforce  at  least  SOME  degree  of
     familiarity with POLICY4, by adding another requirement.

     SUGGESTION:

     "Your  application  for  a  node  number  must  be  sent  to the
     coordinator by FidoNet mail directly from the machine requesting
     the address, and must include at least the following:

         ...
        7) A statement to the effect that you have read, are familiar
           with,   and   will  abide by the rules  in  version  4  of
           POLICY.DOC."

                           --------------------

     SECTION 3.2     Node list distribution

     "The  node  list  is  posted weekly on Saturday,  along  with  a
     'difference file'  giving the changes for the week.   It is your
     responsibility  to   obtain   the  difference   file  from  your
     coordinator  every week and to distribute it to the coordinators
     below you. ..."

     COMMENTARY (Minor quibbles, both):  (1) I  think it's a bad idea
     in general to have so much of the traffic tied to a specific day
     when we  all  know that sometimes it doesn't  happen  that  way.
     Frankly, I've set my system up so that whatever day Rich crashes
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 6                    9 Nov 1987


     the  NODEDIFF  through,  I'll process  it.   So  let's  make  it
     "weekly,  usually on Saturday."    (2)  Suggested clarification:
     "... and to distribute it to the coordinators and nodes directly
     below you."

                           --------------------

     SECTION 3.6.3   Regional Coordinator procedures

     "A  Regional  Coordinator  should  try  to  avoid  the  needless
     proliferation of networks.   Networks should not be allocated on
     any basis  other  than technical  and  practical  considerations
     relating  to  network  mail operations.   For  example,  persons
     wishing to establish networks on the basis of special  interests
     or  for  company  mail should be encouraged  to  investigate the
     alternatives, such as echomail conferences and point networks."

     COMMENTARY:   I  notice that as written,  this section makes  no
     mention of geography.  Does this mean that is =is= OK for a node
     in Philadelphia to host the network for Arkansas?  Does this say
     anything about two or more networks that cover the same range of
     phone numbers, such as nets 102 & 103, or 125 & 161?

                           --------------------

     SECTION 3.6.4   Network Coordinator procedures

     "3)  The  most  common source of routing overload  is  echomail.
         Echomail is a nice invention, and offers great benefits, but
         it cannot  be allowed to degrade the ability of  FidoNet  to
         handle  normal message traffic.   If a node in a  network is
         routing large volumes of echomail, the sysop can be asked to
         either limit the amount of echomail, or even to stop routing
         his echomail completely. The design of echomail is such that
         it is a simple matter to do  either of these."

     COMMENTARY:   As  this problem is  ancient history,  and as this
     problem is also used for an example (4.1.7), I  find this entire
     paragraph  redundant.   In fact,  I'd  blow all  three  of these
     paragraphs into one much shorter sentence.

     SUGGESTION:

     "If  for  any  reason,   a  single  node   is  receiving  a dis-
     proportionate amount of the  mail  addressed to its network, the
     network coordinator should  require  the node  to either arrange
     for the mail to be sent direct or the node should be referred to
     the region  coordinator to become an independent node, achieving
     the same end."

                           --------------------

     CHAPTER 4       RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

     "...  In other  words,  there are no hard and fast rules of con-
     duct, but reasonably polite behavior is expected. ..."
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 7                    9 Nov 1987


     COMMENTARY:  I believe we want this to read, "...  there are FEW
     hard and fast rules of conduct ..."

                           --------------------

     SECTION 4.1     Case Histories

     "A few actual case histories of past disputes may be instructive
     to show general procedures and methods."

     COMMENTARY:  And then again, they might not.  This whole section
     makes me vaguely uncomfortable.  It's chatty, it gives few or no
     general  principles to extrapolate from,  and despite  the  fact
     that  it  coyly   leaves  out names and  addresses,  it  invites
     speculation.   (The  fact that I happen to be  case    4.1.7  is
     irrelevant.  I'd feel the  same  way even if it weren't me being
     pilloried behind  that gauze curtain.)   (Grin)   I  would much,
     much  rather  see  this entire section  re-written,  after  MUCH
     discussion,  into  a list of  behaviours which have  been  found
     "extemely  annoying"<tm?>  in  the past,  and/or which  we  have
     decided (will have decided, rather) are "extremely annoying."

                           --------------------

     SECTION 4.1.1   The Case of the Crooked Node

     "A sysop of a local node was using network mail to engage in un-
     ethical business practices. ... Independent status was denied."

     COMMENTARY:   Do  we mean illegal?   If so,  let's say  illegal.
     Unethical  by  whose standards?   This is why I don't  like  the
     whole coy,  chatty/catty tone of this chapter.   I =don't=  like
     the idea that somebody can be kicked out of the nodelist because
     one  host thinks he's a bit shady.   C'mon,  are we going to ban
     nodes by ambulance-chasing personal-injury law firms?  By share-
     lease  real  estate  salesmen?   Or do we  actually  want  legal
     proceedings?  Is the word of the local BBB sufficient?

     SECTION 4.1.6   The Case of the Sysop Twit

     "A  patron of various local nodes had been roundly recognized by
     all sysops as a twit.   The user obtained his own system, became
     a sysop, and applied for a node number.  The Network Coordinator
     denied the request.  No appeals were made."

     COMMENTARY:  This one makes me almost as uncomfortable as 4.1.1,
     for similar reasons.  It's vague.  It tells us nothing.   What's
     a "twit?"   Someone  who's  young?   Someone  who  treats female
     users/sysops  in a sexist fashion?   Or do we have to go all the
     way up to attempted crashers ... in which case,  this section is
     redundant with "The Case of the Hacker Mailer."   Is Bob Hoffman
     a twit?  How about Adam Selene?   How about Mike?  How about me?
     Who  decides?   And does that last line imply that appeals would
     have been seriously considered, or not?

     SECTION 4.1.7   The Case of the EchoMail Junkey key key

     "A local node became enamored with EchoMail and  joined  several
     conferences,  routing his outbound mail through his network.  He
     then  started  an  EchoMail  conference of  his  own  and  began
     relaying EchoMail between several systems,  again routing it all
     through his network."

     COMMENTARY:   Since I was there, I know that this one neglects a
     lot of what =I= (as the accused) think are important facts: like
     the  fact  that  I  had  permission  to  route  a  few  of those
     conferences through 100/10; the fact that I couldn't bloody well
     STOP  folks from sending me mail via 100/0  (what was I supposed
     to do,  mail them a letter bomb?);  and the most important  fact
     that the packets that actually affected network mail performance
     were NOT intentional on my part, they were accidental - I had my
     route-file  set  up incorrectly.   Would Ken Kaplan  really have
     ejected  me  from  the node list  for  an  honest,  easy-to-make
     technical mistake which I corrected as soon as possible?

                  Preferred Inbound and Alternate Inbound
                             A Routing Proposal

     (This article is NOT COPYRIGHTED and may be reproduced by anyone,
     in any form, with no strings attached.)

     The present scheme of regions,  hosts,  hubs,  and  nodes  within
     Fidonet was developed in an era when, by and large, all telephone
     costs   were  distance-sensitive  (and  where  the  costs  always
     increased when your call terminated at  a  more  distant  point).
     Even  at that time those assumptions were not always true (due to
     the use of leased lines and the generally  higher  cost  for  in-
     state  calls  as  opposed  to out-of-state calls) but now that we
     have PC Pursuit and AT&T's Reach Out America  plan,  distance  is
     often of no consideration in making modem calls.

     Still,  nets are often arranged geographically, with all BBS's in
     a given region grouped  together  on  a  geographic  basis.  This
     works  well  enough  when  an  entire  net  is located in a major
     metropolitan area, but it often does not meet the needs of Sysops
     in more remote areas.

     The major reason that it doesn't work well is that the  backwater
     Sysop's  HOST  is  probably accessible only via the long distance
     phone system,  and the HOST itself may be in only a  medium-sized
     city.  Consider,  for a moment,  the disadvantages that our rural
     Sysop will face:

     1) He will probably be expected to POLL his host for  mail  on  a
        regular basis,  even though the volume of received mail may be
        very low.

     2) He probably does not yet have  access  to  an  alternate  long
        distance carrier, let alone a packet network or PC Pursuit, so
        his calls to the host will be at AT&T long distance rates.  If
        the  host  is  located  in the same state and is some distance
        away, those rates may be VERY high, even at night!

     3) If the host is not in a PC-Pursuitable city, other Sysops will
        charge their users to send mail through to  the  remote  board
        (if  they  allow  it at all).  This,  in turn,  will lower the
        volume of received mail, making the prospect of having to poll
        the host regularly even less attractive.

     What we are talking here is COST.  The Sysop who is  out  of  the
     mainstream of traffic may have expenses that are many times those
     of  a sysop living in a larger city.  But inefficient routing can
     also affect Sysops in more populated areas.  For example, if your
     inbound host is a long distance call (and is not PC Pursuitable),
     it's still going to cost you to connect with him even though  you
     may be able to access other hosts (of other nets) for free or for
     less money.

     I'm sure that others have suggested that the whole Fidonet system
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 10                   9 Nov 1987


     be  reconfigured to take maximum advantage of PC Pursuit or Reach
     Out America or some other quirk in  local  calling  rates.  There
     are a couple of major problems with that,  however.  The first is
     that if the service that the net is configured around  goes  down
     or has a dramatic rate increase, you're right back to inefficient
     routing (for example,  if the proposed FCC regulations go through
     and PC Pursuit is discontinued,  I can guarantee you  that  there
     will  be  some  major  changes  in the way that Echomail is being
     routed!).  The second is that the geographic unity of  a  net  is
     not  something that should be easily cast aside.  It is nice (and
     usually very beneficial) to be  in  frequent  communication  with
     other Sysops in your own area!

     Therefore,  I  have  a  proposal  that  would  retain the present
     net/hub/node structure but would allow calls to be rerouted based
     on least-cost principles,  where the sysop of the receiving board
     is  willing  to  put  a  little effort into making it happen.  My
     proposal involves new comments in the miscellaneous field of  the
     nodelist:

     AI:net/node - An alternate inbound routing that MAY be used if it
                   is less cost to the calling board.

     PI:net/node - A  PREFERRED  alternate inbound routing that SHOULD
                   be used by the calling board if it is the same cost
                   or less cost than host routing or  direct  routing.
                   This  might be used when it is a toll call from the
                   receiving board to the net host,  but a "free"  (PC
                   Pursuit,   possibly?)   call   to   the   preferred
                   alternate.

     In either case,  more than one net/node may be specified.  Let me
     give  a  hypothetical example of how such routing might save some
     money.  Since a picture is supposed to be worth 1,000  words  and
     I'm  tired  of  typing,  please refer to the following diagram of
     nodes in imaginary net 999:

     999/999           999/123         888/888        777/777
     BACKWATER <-----> SMALLTOWN ----> HUBTOWN -----> METRO
         x               x
         |               |             (TELENET       (PC PURSUIT
         x               x              ACCESS)       INBOUND CITY)
       HOST 999/0 (TOLL CALL)

     Let's assume that BACKWATER is at the edge  of  nowhere,  but  is
     within  the local telephone calling area of SMALLTOWN,  which is,
     presumably,  in  the  middle  of  nowhere!  In  our  hypothetical
     example,  the Net 999 Host is a toll call for both boards but the
     Sysop of the Smalltown board happens to be a business owner  with
     a  direct  line  (foreign exchange or WATS,  perhaps) to HUBTOWN,
     which as it happens  is  the  location  of  a  HUB  for  net  888
     (unfortunately, that's NOT part of the same net!).  Our Smalltown
     BBS  operator  POLLs the Hubtown node daily to pick up echoes and
     whatever mail might be incidentally routed that  way.  Meanwhile,
     the  Hubtown  node operator,  which has access to a Telenet local
     line,  places a daily call via PC Pursuit to POLL node 777/777 in
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 11                   9 Nov 1987


     METRO for mail.

     Under the present setup,  both the Backwater and Smalltown Sysops
     would have to POLL their host to receive  incoming  matrix  mail.
     Of  course,  they  could  realign themselves to be under Net 888,
     ASSUMING that the host of node 888  has  no  objections  and  the
     regional   coordinator(s)  involved  are  willing  to  allow  the
     transfer - but what if,  two  months  later,  the  Sysop  of  the
     Smalltown  node decides to pull the plug on his system?  Then the
     Backwater Sysop is left high and dry,  with no connection to  Net
     999 and the possibility of a not-too-satisfying relationship with
     Net 888.

     Let's suppose,  however,  that our Backwater Sysop would take the
     initiative to contact all of the nodes involved and  set  up  the
     following arrangement:

     METRO  777/777 receives mail for Backwater - this in effect makes
     the Backwater board PC Pursuitable for mail purposes - and  HOLDs
     it  for pickup by HUBTOWN 888/888.  HUBTOWN 888/888 in turn HOLDs
     it for pickup by SMALLTOWN 999/123.  When  999/123  receives  the
     mail packet,  he immediately CRASHes it to 999/999 because it's a
     local call.  This much of it is all workable  under  the  present
     system.  The  only  problem  is  that  any Sysop that simply runs
     Xlatlist,   without  knowing   about   this   arrangement,   will
     automatically  route  mail for 999/999 to the Host (999/0) which,
     as noted earlier,  happens to be a toll  call  for  the  Net  999
     boards in question.

     Now,  if  our Backwater Sysop could some convince everyone to ARC
     his mail TO 888/888  or  777/777,  he'd  be  in  fine  shape.  He
     wouldn't  have  to Poll the host to get his mail.  So how does he
     do this?  Under my proposal,  he would place this comment in  the
     nodelist:

     PI:888/888 777/777

     This  would  tell other Sysops that,  if it is a toll call to his
     board,  he would prefer that mail be routed to 888/888 or 777/777
     rather than to the Net 999 Host.  On the sending end, the program
     that handles the mail (that would have to be written to implement
     this scheme) would use this logic to route the outgoing call:

     1) Is 999/999 a local/zero cost call?  If so, direct route it.

     2) Is  888/888  a  local/zero  cost  call?  If  so,  route it via
        888/888.

     3) Is 777/777 a  local/zero  cost  call?  If  so,  route  it  via
        777/777.

     4) Is the HOST (999/0) a local/zero cost call?  If so, host route
        it  (the  HOST  may  still  receive some inbound mail for this
        node,  but he may be able to Arc it To a node in the Backwater
        system's "free" path, if the call is also "free" for him.)

     FidoNews 4-41                Page 12                   9 Nov 1987


     5) If all of the above are toll calls, then check the cost fields
        to determine which of routing direct to 999/999,  indirect via
        888/888,  indirect via  777/777,  or  indirect  via  the  host
        (999/0) is the least expensive and use that method.

     6) Where the costs are the same, the first choice would be direct
        routing.  Since  this  was set up as a Preferred Inbound,  the
        second and third choices would be  to  route  via  888/888  or
        777/777.  Host  routing  would  only be used if it was clearly
        the lowest cost choice for the sender.

     Now let's change the scenario  a  bit.  Suppose  that  the  above
     diagram  is  the  same except that the HOST happens to be a local
     call.  In this case,  the Backwater Sysop isn't out anything when
     he  polls the host,  so he doesn't care if other boards send mail
     directly to his board,  or  route  it  via  his  Host.  The  only
     problem  with  this  scenario  is  that  the  Host  isn't in a PC
     Pursuitable city, which means that users in distant areas have to
     pay their Sysops to send mail to Backwater.  Now,  instead of PI:
     (Preferred Inbound), the Backwater Sysop would use AI: (Alternate
     Inbound).  This  simply  reverses  the  priorities  so  that Host
     routing would be preferred over the use of 888/888 or 777/777 for
     inbound mail,  BUT if it is a zero cost (or lower cost) call  for
     the  originating  BBS,  it  MAY  route  via  one of the other two
     boards.

     Of course,  the above describes  one  particular  situation  (any
     similarity  to  a real-life situation is purely coincedental) but
     the ability to use the PI and AI comments (one or  both)  in  the
     comment  field  might  permit  mail  to flow at a lot lower cost.
     More importantly,  I think,  is that existing Net bonds  are  not
     destroyed  and  if  something changes,  changing the preferred or
     alternate routing is as easy as making a change in the nodelist.

     Now,  how would a PI:  or AI:  be used at the sending end?  Well,
     the  lo-tech  method would be for a Sysop to manually eyeball the
     nodelist and look for the PI's and AI's.  Let's suppose he  found
     the  Backwater BBS and,  because he was a PC Pursuit user,  could
     call 777/777 for free.  He would then insert a statement such  as
     ArcTo  777/777  999/999  in  his route control file.  Most Sysops
     wouldn't enjoy doing this very much (although they might make the
     necessary adjustments for frequently-called nodes),  so I'm  sure
     that  someone  would write a utility that would scan the nodelist
     (after xlatlist processing) and generate  appropriate  statements
     for the route control file.  Such a utility,  when it encountered
     a PI: or AI: statement, would check the cost fields of the boards
     referenced  by  the  PI:  or  AI:   and  generate  any  necessary
     statements  based on the logic outlined above.  If the board with
     the PI:  or AI:  statements happened to be a Host or a Hub,  then
     the  routing  for all boards below that host or hub would also be
     checked  and  changed  if  the   alternate   routing   could   be
     accomplished  at  lower  cost.   Ultimately,  a  new  version  of
     xlatlist might handle all  of  this  automatically,  or  a  newer
     version  of  the  BBS  or  mail-handler  program (whichever brand
     you're using) might read the  comments  and  make  the  necessary
     adjustments in calling patterns.
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 13                   9 Nov 1987


     As with anything, this kind of alternate routing capability could
     be  misused  (I  can  envision "super" mailboards in the large PC
     Pursuit  cities  becoming  nearly  impossible  to  reach  due  to
     overloads),  so  it  would have to be used with some restraint to
     spread the message traffic evenly.  But I also  think  that  many
     Sysops  would  welcome this method of reducing costs for outgoing
     mail,  while at the same time encouraging a freer flow of mail to
     the boards in the outlying areas.

     Comments  on  this  proposal may be left to me via the BIXNET BBS
     (120/64, 616-361-7500 300/1200/2400bps),  although I really can't
     do  much  more  to  develop  it.  The  idea  is simple,  could be
     implemented  NOW  in  a  limited  manner,  and  when  appropriate
     software  is  written  could  be more fully implemented.  For the
     present, a Sysop could just ignore the PI:  and AI:  comments and
     continue  to  Host route mail,  or could manually make changes to
     his route control file for as many boards as he cares to make the
     effort.  I hope that this idea will  receive  some  consideration
     among those in the Fidonet community.

     Kilgore Trout, 1:107/6


                          What's Happening at SEA?

     Did you ever try to send 4096 blocks of echomail to someone, just
     to have the line die  on  you  after  4095  blocks?  Frustrating,
     isn't it?

     A  few  people  have  thought about ways to handle that.  Answers
     range from lots of little  mail  relays  throughout  the  day  to
     implementing  a  ZMODEM based protocol that can resume an aborted
     transfer in the middle.  But nobody has  actually  implemented  a
     workable solution.  Until now, that is.

     As  of  3  November  1987,  SEA  has released version 1.11 of our
     popular ARCmail program.  This version adds a variation of the -d
     parameter to create discrete archives based on the  size  of  the
     previous  archive.   For  example,  suppose  you  have  two  mail
     archives waiting to go out.  One of them is going to 107/312  and
     is  120k  in  size.  The  other  is going to 107/16 and is 50k in
     size.  You are now about to send another  30k  of  mail  to  each
     person.  If you give the command:

         arcmail to 107/312 107/16 -d100

     ARCmail  1.11  will  add  the  packet  to  the archive to 107/16,
     because his archive is still small.  But the archive for  107/312
     is  larger  than  100k,  so ARCmail will create a new archive for
     him. "-d100" means "create a new archive if the old one is larger
     than 100k" (you can vary the size, of course).

     So how does this answer the  problem,  you  ask?  Simple.  SEAdog
     keeps  track  of what files have or have not been sent,  and will
     not resend a file that has already  been  sent.  Thus,  the  4096
     block  archive  in  our  earlier example will now be sent as five
     smaller archives, and if the line drops while the last archive is
     being sent,  then ONLY the last archive will be sent on the  next
     call.


     In  other  news,  we  have also released version 1.23 of the DTTY
     terminal program.  DTTY still isn't  very  bright,  but  now  she
     knows better than to call a board that has an unpublished number.
     Two other changes have been made:

      1) DTTY will now respond to an ENQ with your name,  as listed in
         your CONFIG.DOG file, in the format "First;Last".  People who
         call TBBS boards a lot should appreciate this.

      2) The Give and Ask commands have been  modified  to  work  with
         Opus   upload  and  download.   Any  of  the  DTTY  supported
         protocols may be used.

                                 FidoCon V

         How convenient that the Oct 5 FidoNews should have a  request
     for suggestions on where FidoCon V should be held,  I just send a
     letter to Mr.  President about where I thought it should be held.
     Well, I'll publish it here and forward a copy to the RIGHT place,
     now.

         Although  I  cannot answer every question posed there,  I can
     probably get pretty far.  My suggestion is  to  hold  it  at  the
     InfoMart  in  downtown  Dallas.  Dallas  is home to many computer
     hobbists (just look at the size of net 124) and the  InfoMart  is
     an  ideal place for any computer-related conference.  It is seven
     floors and features such things as talking  elevators,  automatic
     flushing  urinals  (programmers  are  so  forgetful),  a  bar,  a
     cafeteria,   underground  parking,   many  many  many  rooms  and
     auditoriums,  a computer bookstore,  and a basement that can hold
     several hundred vendors.

         The  InfoMart  was   specifically   designed   for   computer
     conferences and for permanent vendor displays. Tandy, IBM, Xerox,
     and  many  other  companies  whose names I've never heard of have
     permanent "booths" there  where  clients  can  come  by  and  get
     demonstrations. It is also the home, on the 2nd Saturday of every
     month,  of  the  Dallas  Computer  Council user's group meetings,
     where hundreds of  vendors  with  rock-bottom  prices  crowd  the
     basement and groups for Apples to Zeniths have their meetings and
     talk  about  everything  from  C to 1-2-3 to dBase,  representing
     almost every interest.

         Since it is in downtown Dallas, I imagine everything you need
     will be right there.  There is public transportation (DART),  but
     as far as "shuttles" as such I do not know. There are hotels down
     there,  and  I'm  sure  they've  struck up some kind of deal with
     InfoMart.  I'm sure the price is right; if DCC, being made almost
     exclusively  of  hobbists,  can  meet  there  every month without
     charging a mandatory fee, I'm sure we can, particularly if we can
     produce non-profit organization status.  Net 124  would  probably
     host it if it came to that (Wynn Wagner lives in Dallas,  another
     plus),  and I certainly can't speak for them whether they can  do
     all those things (make T-SHIRTS and SOUVENIRS available?  GIMME A
     BREAK!) but net 124 is strong and I'm sure  they  could  if  they
     wanted  to.  Net  130  (Fort  Worth,  a  half-hour away) would be
     willing to help if it came to that.

         Since August gets really hot in Dallas, I recommend something
     earlier, perhaps the second or third week in June or thereabouts,
     or even in July.

         Dallas is a growing technological  city  that  can  offer  an
     awful lot in the area of entertaining Fido sysops. InfoMart is an
     excellent  place  for  a  computer  conference  and  was designed
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 17                   9 Nov 1987


     specifically for that purpose.  The airport is easily  accessable
     and  DFW  is  a  major airport (it is one of American's hubs) and
     there should be no problem getting a non-stop.  I hope that  IFNA
     will  seriously look into Dallas as the home for FidoCon V (geez,
     that sounds like a sci-fi movie....)

                             COMMITTEE REPORTS
     =================================================================

     Don Daniels, President
     International FidoNet Association
     FidoNet 1:107/210


                    IFNA Status Report for November 1987


     PROGRESS DURING THIS PERIOD

     General

       I am sorry to report that this Status Report will not be as
       positive as I might had hoped, as we are still being plagued by
       start-up problems.  That is not to say that a lot of
       individuals have not pitched in are doing a good job, because
       that does seems to be the case.  Rather, our problems seem to
       primary be that of an administrative and management nature.  It
       is hoped, however, that we are building up some inertia in the
       right directions.

       This month I only received two status reports from the various
       Committee Chairmen.  A synopsis of their reports and some
       additional concerns are included below.

     Administration and Finance
       Ken Kaplan met with Treasurer Leonard Mednick in St.  Louis in
       what seems to have been a very productive meeting.  Len informs
       me that we is still waiting on some additional material being
       forwarded by Ken, but we have already seen the beginnings of
       new forms and procedures to make various of our operations
       easier to perform and manage.

     Board of Directors
       No report this month.

     By-laws and Rules
       The Chairman of this committee informed me that he was taking a
       month off because of some personal concerns.  Last night I
       heard that he is back and will be picking up efforts next
       month.

     Executive Committee
       This month has primarily centered on organizational concerns.

     International Affairs
       This committee has not still not "met" as of yet, primarily
       because of our own domestic focus.  However, so many items of
       concern are happening overseas that it looks like we can't put
       this off any longer.

     Membership Services
     FidoNews 4-41                Page 20                   9 Nov 1987


       No report.

     Nominations and Elections
       Dave Dodell informs me that primary activity centered on
       discussions on how to secure echomail voting by email.  Legal
       rulings from IFNA Counsel indicate that voting by electronic
       means would not be invalid.  Encoding of passwords in voting
       messages is being studied.

     Publications
       Although not officially received, Brian Hughes indicated he has
       resigned as Chairman.  Ken Kaplan has named Tim Sullivan as the
       replacement.

     Technical Standards
       No report.


     PRESENT PROBLEMS

     General
       Getting such a large body to develop inertia in the right
       direction is proving very difficult considering the limited
       resources that can be brought to bear.  My apologies to those
       who have suffered from our lack of expedient responses.

     Administration and Finance
       No significant problems reported at this time.

     Board of Directors
       We have still not learned how to actually conduct business in
       an EchoMail environment.  Overcoming this will take
       considerable discipline.

     By-laws and Rules
       Specific direction has still not been received from either the
       BoD or Executive Committee.

     Executive Committee
       We have not yet resolved how we will meet our obligations to
       meet "at least quarterly" and handle all the concerns that are
       being placed before us.  The problem with working in EchoMail
       has resulted in many delays which in turn are causing friction
       with those laying business before us.  We are currently divided
       as to how best to proceed.

     International Affairs
       A very large storm seems to be brewing in Australia.  Distance,
       of course, makes it difficult for us to effectively intervene
       and provide assistance.

     Membership Services
       None reported at this time.

     Nominations and Elections
       None reported at this time.

     Publications
       With no Chairman, this committee has not been in operation.

     Technical Standards
       No report.


     PROGNOSIS FOR THE COMING MONTH

     General
       It is hoped that we will solve some of organizational problems
       this month and get on to the backlog of business.

     Administration and Finance
       Leonard Mednick will continue to take over much of the
       administrative factors previously handled exclusively by Ken
       Kaplan.

     Board of Directors
       No Report.

     By-laws and Rules
       Activity in this committee will mostly still be tabled.

     Executive Committee
       As this Committee is required to meet quarterly it is expected
       that much of the orgainizational concerns and backlog of work
       will be addressed this month, providing some acceptable
       compromise can be met on how to meet.

     International Affairs
       This committee will begin to get underway this month.

     Membership Services
       No report.  FidoCon proposals should be acted on, however.

     Nominations and Elections
       Furthur development of electronic voting with appropriate
       software development.

     Publications
       Installation of new Chairman should get this committee rolling.

     Technical Standards
       No report.
