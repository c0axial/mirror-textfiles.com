     Greetings,

     And now for the last issue for November 1998.  In 31 days, we have
     1999 and the start of a new year.

     Has 1998 gone past without you knowing what you did?  Or was it a
     year in which you knew what was going on, but you ignored it anyway?

     Well whichever way, you have 31 days to correct it. :-)

     Happy reading,

     Password Change - Right or Wrong?

     Kent Anderson  1:382/92/kand@onr.com

     Your letter in Fidonews F47 points out, line by line, your sysopsis of
     what happened in the recent password change incident. In actuality,
     it's the best proof I have seen of the correctness of Thom Lacosta's
     action in revealing the password to Rob Ferrera. Here's why I feel
     this is true:

     Those who move the mail MUST know to whom they look for initiating
     action within the conference. They have no way whatever of knowing
     that some puppetmaster behind the scences is making a dummy dance.
     Their looking to the LISTED Moderator(s) is the only logical
     approach. It even makes sense to consider the first listed Moderator
     as in charge in the event of a dispute.

     The commonly accepted practice through all the time I have
     participated in Fidonet activities has been to consider the listed
     Moderator as in charge of a conference, and the one with authority
     there, when authority must be wielded. That authority includes with
     it the right to delegate to another such tasks as the Moderator deems
     fitting. Delegating those duties does not mean that the person in
     charge delegates the responsibility for the delegated task to
     performed properly.

     Revealing a password to the proven Moderator of an echo is not
     something new. Under proper circumstances, it was most certainly done
     when Adrian Walker kept the echo list, and so far as I know during
     his predecessors' regimes. As a Fidonet Moderator, I have not the
     slightest compunction about letting the security of my echo's
     password rest with Thom. I personally feel that we owe him a vote of
     thanks for preventing an echo from being orchestrated from behind the
     scenes by someone unknown to the users of that echo.

     [ED Interesting comment, the question remains, is the elist worth it,
         as commented in my Editorial of last week?


     -----------------------------------------------------------------


     Finally something I can get up on the soap box about. Now
     listen up it's time for a lesson. Stepping up to my Soap
     Box I Proclaim:

     Is there room in Fidonet Nodelist for IP's. In this Authors
     opinion Damn right. There should have been some adaptation
     officially about 7 years ago. There was a time where Fidonet
     system operators were on the cutting edge. Today some of you
     are finally waking up and getting on the band wagon... But most
     FIDONEWS 15-48               Page 3                   30 Nov 1998


     of you want to cry that your user base has dried up and moved
     on. Get a grip and start showing the world we have what it
     takes to put Fidonet back on the map. If not put it back on the
     map but at least move the technology into the 90's instead of
     staying in the 80's

     It's kinda funny in a sense I was laughed at back in 1992 for
     setting up one of the very first Internet e-mail capable
     BBS systems. Sysops laughed and said, what do you need that
     for. Well who is laughing now.

     I was pushing for IP integration back in 95 and for the most
     part it was like talking to a brick wall. Well I am very very
     happy that the new innovators in Zone 2 are actually pushing
     the boundaries so that they can force the rest of you into
     actually implementing something useful.

     What is comical is that I hear many of you crying that your
     BBS systems are not getting callers anymore. No Shit sherlock
     they are all connecting to the 1000 or less BBS systems that
     are fully connected to the Internet. I never had 7000 logins
     in one day when we had 16 dial in lines going. Move your
     systems to the Net and take away some of my volume.

     Connectivity is getting cheaper and with services like
     www.dynip.com who update your dns records on the fly when you
     don't own a static IP the cost to put your BBS on the Net
     is no more than a upgraded Internet account and a dedicated
     phone line.

     But so far as what the real wizards over in Zone 2 are doing
     I would hope that those of you spending your days squabbling
     about who is the biggest and baddest and who has power and
     who doesn't will wake up and take notice and move this hobby
     forward once again.

     I get mad like everyone else when people try to push there
     personal agendas and not help one another and move this
     network forward. But it will be like the past a few early
     adopters will move on Zone 2's innovation and then the rest of
     you will wake up one morning and play catch up..

     If your crying that your poor old 286 single line dial up system
     is gonna break because they modified the nodelist well I guess we
     will have to come up with 2 Nodelist after all it isn't that BIG
     and I am sure it would not be real difficult rig a conversion
     program.

     It is time for some real new Fidonet leadership and I mean real
     new leadership most of the so called leaders are either burned
     out or they still are listening to Disco.

     Lastly I want to tell you the real reason Zone 1 has not adapted
     Fidonet over IP it is because it would put a few subscription
     echomail feeds out of business. BTW I have already set about
     25 of you up for free feeds an am re-feeding you. I have plenty
     FIDONEWS 15-48               Page 4                   30 Nov 1998


     of bandwidth for about a 1000 more so If any of you need a free
     full Fidonet echomail/filebone and netmail feed drop me a line
     at the contact at the bottom and I will be happy to save you
     some of you hard earned cash each month that you can put
     towards putting your BBS on the Internet

     Announcing the newly backboned MP3 echo!

     A new echo has been established for discussion of the popular internet
     music distribution file format of MP3.  It is an open-ended echo for
     discussion of just about anything related to the MP3, including the
     political aspects and the legal aspects of the file format.  I, the
     moderator (Steve Steffler, 1:17/667.3) encourage all sysops reading to
     hook into this sure-to-be interesting echo from their nearest backbone
     feed.  I'm not great at advertising, so below I'll include the ELIST
     entry, and you can come check it out for yourself.

     MP3
     International MP3 Discussion Forum
          This echo is for news, discussion and information pertaining
          to the high quality digital music format that is sweeping
          the world, MPEG I Layer III (or MP3). This echo is gatewayed
          into e-mail mailing list format as well.  Put "SUBSCRIBE
          MP3" in an email to listserv@gen.lcrnet.org to add yourself
          to the discussion.
