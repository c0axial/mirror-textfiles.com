     Let's have a contest to name the new network the Echomail weenies
     want to move into when FidoNet refuses to adjust to their skew of
     what FidoNet is and does!

     The new name should certainly be self-contained in eight characters
     for historical if not MSDOS plurality. That name should express as
     succinctly as possible the all-consuming Echomailness of the newly
     moved into network. It might even have some kind of oblique reference
     to its former FidoNet origin like TailDog or FleaNits. [snicker]

     After all, the EWs don't want to become yet another superfluous FTN
     based solely on Echomail that will eventually dry up and blow away
     like its predecessors such as EggNet and AlterNet do they? They've
     got to fight for the right to coopt FidoNet without infringing that
     trademark.

     And in an unrelated vein, next week there will be two more Sections
     available for submissions to FidoNews. The first will be .TRU for
     True Stories of FidoNet and the second will be .FIC for wannabe
     FidoNet Fiction writers [which could include Echomail weenies'
     standard bleats]. The ARTSPEC.DOC will be updated to include the new
     Section extensions and hatched out into FIDONEWS and SOFTDIST file
     echos.

     The True Stories will be essays about FidoNet-related events in the
     personal lives of Sysops and/or Users. FidoNet Fiction will be
     imaginary FidoNet-related short stories or novellae or poems or
     limericks. In either case, remember this is a family publication and
     nothing illegal gets published. [grin]

     Well, it's later than usual this week. We've been having a lot of
     lightning storms and tornado watches and warnings today and the system
     has been offline a lot to avoid frying.

     Please note that the R19 Internet listing has changed once again.

               Hello Christopher!

        About "FIDONET BY INTERNET" section of fidonews. We are the
     developers of IGATOR - Fidonet-Internet gateway - our URL is
     http://www.ritlabs.com/igator/

        We are also working in direction of fidonet transferring via
     internet channels, and have written a multinode mailer that can
     simultaneously transfer fidonet netmail/echomail/files over dialup and
     ip using standard FTS technology. Argus is now widely used in Russia,
     especially be hubs, and some nodes in UK and US began to use Argus as
     a primary mailer.

     It's been brought to my attention that I made an error with a previous
     note on International BBS Week and it's support echo, INTBBS_WK. The
     error was mentioning the echo as INTBBS_WEEK.

     Could anyone who has set this area up as INTBBS_WEEK please change it
     to the correct INTBBS_WK.

     Also, links are needed to Zones 2, 4, 5 and 6, as well as distribution
     around the rest of Z1 and Z3. If you could help with this, please do
     so.

     Subj: Bring Back FIDONET.NA

     -=> Note:
     Copied (from: z1_backbone) by C I A using timEd.

     I am proposing the reformation of fidonet.na.

     The way I figure, if enough people in enough regions support the
     concept, we can approach the main distrib hubs (George Peace, John
     Souvestre, Ken Wilson) and ask them to host it for us.

     I know at least George Peace is willing to include other nets in his
     bulk feed, so I don't see him rejecting an request to pass around
     fidonet.na.

     The technical aspects we need to accomplish are, who maintains the
     fidonet.na, how echos are to be added/removed to/from it, and a
     minimum set of 'rules'.

     Please, let's open a discussion on this, perhaps someone can assist in
     getting a 'fidonet.na discussion' echo on the backbone, so we can hash
     out some ideas.

     I had in mind, for adding echos, to have say, 5 nodes from each region
     'vote' that they will carry and participate in the echos. Much better
     than the current '2 rec' voting echos are at the mercy of now :)

     As for a minimal set of rules, we'll prolly be arguing for a while.
     But I think the concept of an alternative backbone is overdue, and I
     hope we can get together and create it :)

     A good start, along with the creation of an echo for discussion, would
     be to begin assembling a list of ftp/transx/vfossil and other
     Internet-fido feeds. I would like to suggest to our Editor of Fidonews
     Chris Baker, add a new section to the weekly fidonews, a list in
     hierarchial order, from T3's to 28.8s, all the system's who have
     fidonet available across the Internet.

     Here's my current list, please feel free to send additions! :)

     North American Backbone Problems
     -by Jon Gentil  1:232/211.0  <jon.gentil@magi.station-1.com>

        The North American Backbone (NAB for short) is undergoing
     tremendous alterations of itself, and it's causing some
     disturbances in the FidoNet community.

        Take for example the FLAME echo.  I don't really like the FLAME
     echo, and really don't hate it either.  But when it's removed from
     distribution simply because the Backbone feels that it's causing
     trouble, there's a problem.  Which echo will they remove next?  The
     TOTT_* echos pose a potential hazard to it's readers.  The CHATTER
     echo has mean people in it.  The FILEFIND echo doesn't have enough
     real people posting there.  What next?

        And did you notice the second-to-last paragraph of this week's
     Backstat.na?

     It reads:
     --------------------------------------------------[BACKSTAT.NA]----
     Each region is normally offered 1 link to each ZHub.   Exceptions are
     made after agreement between the REC, Z1EC, and the ZHub subject to
     the ability to handle the additional load.  Individual net/node
     connections to ZHubs are made on the basis that the node will serve as
     a Region Hub, the exception being connections local to the ZHub.
     ----[END]----------------------------------------------------------

        Note "Individual net/node connections to ZHubs are made on the
     basis that the node will serve as a Region Hub."

        Does that mean that every node connected to a ZHub serves as a
     Region Hub?  That's what it says.

        So we have 100+ Rhubs now.  !!!

        Ever notice how the BOFAQ is constantly changing?  Who radified it?
     Who must obey it?  Anyone?  Everyone?

        Why is a private distribution system allowed to use the term ZHub
     if it's private?  I thought that Hubs were public.

        The requirements to be a Hub of the NAB are that you must have a
     link to a ZHub and you must have at least one downlink, yet Ken Wilson
     (1:12/12), a ZHub, has no downlinks.  Do they pardon those that are
     "Insiders?"

        Did you notice how conviently the Backbone changed their policy of
     who is the OBO?  Possibly in fear that someone that wants to abolish
     the OBO Council and return the Backbone to a public system?

        Write your NC's, NEC's, RC's, REC's, ZC, ZEC, and even me telling

                              ISDN capability flags in the Nodelist
                                           A proposal
                                   by Jan Ceuleers, 2:292/857
                                 version 0.4, October 3rd 1993


              1 Introduction

              The Integrated Services Digital Network is a worldwide
              overlay network, offering the same services as the PSTN
              (Public Switched Telephone Network) and more. Its basic
              bearer capability is a digital bit stream of 64000 bits/s,
              as opposed to the audio channel with a 3.1 kHz bandwidth
              provided by the PSTN.

              Transferring data across the ISDN can be done in one of two
              ways:

                -  by using the telephony services the ISDN provides. In
                   this mode, a standard modem can continue to be used.
                   Some modulation schemes currently in use are V.32bis,
                   PEP, ZyXEL, HST, V.32, etc. We already have nodelist
                   flags for these cases.

                -  by using  ISDN's 'native'  mode. In this  case, a
                   number of protocols  (either or not  ISDN-specific) are
                   used, such as V.110, V.120, X.75 etc.

              This  document  aims to  define  the way  in  which nodes
              are to advertise their ISDN  capabilities in the nodelist,
              irrespective of whether or  not ISDN-only nodes should be in
              the nodelist in the  first place.  This latter problem is to
              be  solved by  the politicians.

              Descriptions of ISDN equipment and compatibility with POTS
              (Plain Old Telephone Service) equipment are beyond the scope
              of this document. More detailed information on ISDN is also
              not provided; readers  are referred to the literature (e.g.
              'Computer Networks' by Andrew Tanenbaum).

     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 8                    2 Jun 1997


              2 Different flavors of the same protocol

              Some ISDN protocols have different flavors, some  of which
              differ only marginally, but others are quite distinct.

                       For  the techies among the readership: examples of
                       both cases can be found in the 1988 definition of
                       V.110.  There are two variants of the frame
                       structure used in the 56kbps synchronous mode
                       (marginal difference), while there is quite a major
                       difference between the synchronous and asynchronous
                       versions of V.110.

              Since FidoNet  applications are essentially  character-based,
              the asynchronous versions  of protocols  will be  preferred
              over the synchronous-ones(1).  This  applies  to V.110  and
              V.120 and to any other such protocol.

              If there is an option, 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit
              will be used in preference over all other possible
              combinations.  (This is in line with the FOSSIL spec).

              3 Speeds

              Some protocols (such  as V.110) can be used  at different
              speeds.  Certain implementations of  these protocols may not
              support some of these speeds.

              The baud rate field in the nodelist  should not be used for
              indicating the  maximum speed an  ISDN node is capable of,
              since ISDN capability  flags could  (technically) co-exist
              with normal modem capability flags(2).

              4 Nodelist flags

              ISDN-related nodelist flags consist of a prefix, a protocol
              indicator and an optional (set of) suffixes.

              The prefix is the capital letter I (for ISDN).

              The protocol indicator is one of the strings defined in
              paragraph 5 below.

              The suffix indicates the way in which the implementation
              deviates from the preferred  implementation, as indicated in
              paragraphs 2 and 3. The possible suffixes are:

                       Onnn          The  only bit  rate supported  =  nnn
                                     *  100 (e.g.  IV110O384 means that
                                     this node only supports V.110
                                     asynchronous at 38400 bps and at no
                                     other speeds.

                       1.  As  a  matter  of  fact, there  are  no
                           provisions  for advertising the synchronous
                           versions of such protocols.

                       2. ISDN technology indeed allows for the possibility
                          of both modem   and  ISDN-specific  datacom
                          connectivity  on  the same 'telephone' number.

                       Pnnnnn        Maximum  packet size supported in
                                     bytes. This is a layer 2  packet
                                     protocol parameter. Communication
                                     between two nodes is only possible if
                                     either end's maximum packet size is
                                     not exceeded.  Leading zeroes are to
                                     be omitted.

                       Rnnn          Highest bit rate supported = nnn * 100
                                     (e.g.  IV110R192 means that this node
                                     does not support V.110 asynchronous at
                                     38400 bps, but does support all other
                                     standardised rates up to and including
                                     19200 bps)

                       Wn            Window size. The window size must be
                                     less than the modulo value (i.e. in
                                     modulo 8, the maximum window size is
                                     7).

              If more than one  suffix is used, the suffixes will  be
              sorted in ascending order.

              5 Protocols

              This section defines the meaning of the base protocol
              indicators.  The aim is to have this base protocol indicator
              cover the majority of cases, so that suffixes will only
              rarely be required.

              5.1 V.110

                       The protocol indicator is V110.  When specified
                       without suffixes, the IV110 nodelist flag indicates
                       V.110 asynchronous capability at bit rates up to and
                       including 38400 bps.

              5.2 V.120

                       The protocol indicator is V120.  When specified
                       without suffixes, the IV120 nodelist flag indicates
                       V.120 asynchronous  capability. Due to the nature of
                       the protocol, the O and R suffixes are irrelevant.

                       There is no explicit mention of frame size in the
                       V.120 specifications. However, since Q.921 is the
                       layer-2 protocol of V.120, one might assume the
                       frame size of Q.921, which is 260 bytes. Frame sizes
                       larger than that should be negotiated between
                       sysops.

              5.3 T.90 (X.75)
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 10                   2 Jun 1997


                       The protocol indicator is T90. Base protocol
                       parameters are:

                                modulo: 8
                                window size: 2
                                packet size: 2048 bytes

                       Currently, there is no standardized method for
                       negotiation of the modulo mode (Recommendation ITU-
                       TS T.90 reserves this subject for further study),
                       all T.90-capable nodes should answer in modulo-8
                       mode.  Itis therefore useless to advertise modulo-
                       128  capability.   This also limits the maximum
                       window size to 7.

                       Some implementations have a maximum frame length of
                       130 bytes and a maximum window size of 1.  This
                       would be documented as IT90P130W1.  The 1992 version
                       of the T.90 standard specifies a method for in-band
                       negotiation of frame length and window size.

              5.4 Other protocols

                       Additional protocols can be added to this document
                       (and thus assigned a nodelist flag) if sufficient
                       technical information is made available.

                       Neither X.25 on B nor on D have been added, because
                       there is no room in the nodelist for the X.25
                       address.

              6 Conversion from old to new

              The ISDNA, ISDNB and ISDNC nodelist flags are already in use
              in zone 2.  The table below shows the relationship between
              old and new.

     new                                                old

     IV110O192                                        ISDNA

     IV110O384                                        ISDNB

     Status of this document:
     ========================

                   This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the
              FidoNet(r) community, and requests discussion and
              suggestions for improvements.  Distribution of this
              document is unlimited.

                   Fido and FidoNet are registered marks of Tom
              Jennings and Fido Software.

     General Introduction:
     =====================

                   Within the FTN networks today is the ability to
              belong to a variety of networks.  These can include, but
              are not limited to, FidoNet, RBBSNet, AlterNet, etc.
              Within each of these specific networks is the ability to
              pass "NetMail" both routed and direct.  But what if
              someone belongs to many of these networks?  How does one
              differentiate netmail between them?  Currently, NetMail
              does NOT allow for an AreaTag to allow for specifying
              between different Domains.  I propose that this change.
              My proposal is to allow for the areatag, for netmail, to
              be called "NETMAIL".

                   current netmail  - none

                   current echomail - AREA:<echoname>  ex. AREA:Binkley

                   proposed netmail - NETMAIL:<domain> ex. NETMAIL:FidoNet
                                                       ex. NETMAIL:RBBSNet

                   This would allow for multi domain'd netmail to be
              seperated into seperate sub-directories to allow our
              netmail readers to differentiate between them and allow
              for replying based on their originating Domain.

     Compatability
     =============

                    "Compatibility is a set of abilities which, when
              taken as a whole, make it safe to list a net or node in
              the FidoNet nodelist."

                   I believe that utilization of my proposal, will
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 12                   2 Jun 1997


              allow for full backwards compatability with reguard to
              netmail and will allow, at the same time, for forward
              progress to be achieved, both, within the fidonet
              community and with other FTN networks.

     NetMail Definition:
     ===================

                   NetMail is a driving force behind FidoNet, and
              allows for the communication between two individuals
              anywhere in the world.

                   See FTS-0001.015 for details on netmail packet
              structure.

     Required Control Information:
     ============================

                   An "AREA:" tag is what makes the difference between
              netmail and echomail.  This would change the definition
              between NetMail and EchoMail, as practiced today.  This
              proposal, however, would not effect EchoMail.  NetMail
              would now, simply, have an areatag named "NETMAIL".

                   The NETMAIL line must be the first line in an
              netmail message's body.  A NETMAIL line's format is
              simply:

                         NETMAIL:<DomainName>

              The NETMAIL tag is specifically _not_ preceded by a ^a.

                   Where <DomainName> is the unique name of the
              NetMail's origin.  Area names should not begin with the
              plus or minus ("+" or "-") symbols.  Area names must not
              contain control characters (less than ASCII character
              32, a space).  Leading and trailing spaces on the area
              name should be ignored (and preferably not produced).
              Compares on the netmail name should be case insensitive.

                   NetMail <Domain> names are generally kept as short
              as possible while still maintaining uniqueness and some
              sense of which Domain the NetMail belongs to.

     EchoMail Definition:
     ====================

                   Echomail, sometimes called broadcast or conference
              mail, is netmail (ref. FTS-0001) containing additional
              control information that allows it to be "echoed"
              (forwarded) from node (site) to node.  Echomail is
              divided into areas, or conferences, with unique names.

                   For historical reasons, the term packet is used in
              FidoNet to represent a bundle of messages, as opposed to
              the more common use as a unit of communication, which is
              known as a block in FidoNet.

     An Inbound Mail packet arrives.  (0000fff1.mo0)
     The packet is unpacked and b498c880.pkt is found.

           IF NETMAIL: THEN toss to "Tosser" defined netmail area
                according to domain,
             IF NOT AREA: OR NETMAIL:  THEN *.pkt is (old-style) netmail
                toss to "Tosser" defined netmail area.

                         Type-10 Packet Format
                       An FSC Standard Proposal

     I.  Introduction:

          Over time, the traditional FidoNet FTS-0001 "Type 2"
     packet format has been repeatedly shown to be inadequate in
     a wide variety of advanced implementations.  The inadequacies
     of the type-2 format have been particularly evident in multi-
     zone and multi-domain environments.
          When type-2 was originally established, it was
     sufficient to existing networking needs.  FidoNet was the
     "only show in town" and the 2-dimensional net/node
     arrangement was easily adequate to the requirements of the
     network.  However, growth in FidoNet required the
     introduction of "zones" to separate large geographical areas
     from each other.  The advent of echomail led directly to the
     creation of sub-node "point" systems, adding a fourth
     dimension to the addressing scheme.  The explosion in recent
     years of similar-technology, non-FidoNet networks has
     required the addition of a fifth dimension, the "domain" to
     differentiate between potentially conflicting addresses in
     different networks.
          The 2-dimensional type-2 format is clearly inadequate
     to a 5-dimensional addressing requirement.  Various schemes
     have evolved to attempt to compensate for the failings of
     the type-2 environment.  Type 2.2 (FSC-0045) and type-2+
     ("capability word" -- FSC-0039) packet format modifications
     have been devised to attempt to modify the packet format to
     include necessary addressing information.  Further, a
     plethora of message text "kludge lines" (lines hidden behind
     an ASCII #01 character) have been inserted to provide
     additional addressing information required by modern
     implementations.
          The major failing of all these schemes, however, comes
     when they run square-on into the "real world".  Competing
     implementations often use slightly different formats or
     requirements within packet formats and kludge lines.  The
     mere existence of kludge lines impose significant performance
     and message test size and content penalties for mail
     processors.
          This proposal seeks to establish a new packet format
     which would resolve the problems and inadequacies presented
     by the existing formats.  In acknowledgment of the fact that
     a theoretical proposal is useless without a practical
     implementation, this proposal has been implemented in the
     JMail 2.10 (and later) versions of electronic mail
     processors.  In the interests of reverse-compatibility, it
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 15                   2 Jun 1997


     is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that any implementations of this
     proposal include some mechanism for supporting older formats
     and their popular modifications.
          This proposal establishes a detailed packet format
     including packet header and internal message structure.  The
     format assumes the utilization of the FidoNet-style
     zone:net/node.point@domain addressing format.  Other
     addressing formats, such as UUCP RFC-822 domain addressing
     and/or "bang-path" addressing are not directly supported by
     this format.

     II.  The 5-Dimensional Address

          The 5-dimensional address consists of the elements (in
     hierarchical order) domain, zone, net, node, and point.  The
     full ASCII representation of this is
     "zone:net/node.point@domain".  Where the point number is
     zero (a full node system as opposed to a dependent point
     system), the period (.) and the point number (0) may be
     excluded.
          Implementations with size concerns may desire to include
     some facility to "assume" or "guess" at particular elements
     of a particular address based on prior addresses or user-
     supplied criteria.  This capability also has advantages when
     dealing with older formats which supply less than complete
     information.

     III.  Type-10 Packet Format

          A.  Conventions

          All binary numerical values in a type-10 packet are
     stored in Intel's byte-swapped format.
          Within this document, all binary numerical values will
     be given in hexadecimal notation (base-16) using the (#)
     designator and right-justified with leading zeros.  For
     example, a single-byte value of 10 would be designated as
     "#0A" while a word-length, two-byte value of 10 would be
     designated as "#000A".
          "NULL" is equivalent to either a #00 byte or #0000 word
     value.

          B.  File Naming Conventions -- *.P10

          Type-2 packet formats established the convention of
     using the PKT extension on file names.  This naming
     convention enabled mail-processing software to easily
     determine which files within a given directory were intended
     to be processed.
          In order to prevent conflicts and preserve easy reverse-
     compatibility, it is necessary for any upgraded format to
     utilize a different file naming convention.  Type-10 packets
     are named with an extension of P10.  This has the additional
     effect of providing an easy new path for additional standards
     -- for example, a theoretical type-11 packet could use,
     without conflict, an extension of P11.
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 16                   2 Jun 1997


          Archived type-10 mail packets may use the same archiving
     file name conventions established for type-2 packets.
     Indeed, the different file naming convention of type-10
     packets allows the inter-mixing of packet types within a
     single archive.

          C.  Packet Header

          The PacketAddressRecord contains a complete 5-
     dimensional address.

               (* Address structure -- Pascal notation *)
               PacketAddressRecord = RECORD
                    Domain : ARRAY[1..8] of char;
                    Zone, Net, Node, Point : integer;
               END;

               /* Address structure -- C notation */
               struct PacketAddressRecord {char domain[8],int
               zone,int net,int node,int point};

          A packet header must appear at the beginning of each
     type-10 packet file.

               (* Packet Header structure -- Pascal notation *)
               PacketHeaderRecord = RECORD
                    PktType : byte;
                    PktFrom,PktTo : PacketAddressRecord;
                    PktPWd : ARRAY[1..8] of char;
                    ProdCode : word;
                    ProdVer : word;
               END;

               /* Packet Header structure -- C notation */
               struct PacketHeaderRecord {unsigned char
               PktType,struct PacketAddressRecord PktFrom, struct
               PacketAddressRecord PktTo, char PktPWd[8],unsigned
               int ProdCode,                 unsigned int
               ProdVer]


          The PktType field contains a numerical value indicating
     the packet type format of the rest of the packet.  The
     PktType field of a type-10 packet will always contain the
     value #0A.  This value has been placed in byte 0 of the file
     to provide a convenient upgrade path for future packet
     formats.
          The PktFrom field contains a PacketAddressRecord
     structure indicating the address of the sending system.
          The PktTo field contains a PacketAddressRecord
     structure indicating the address of the destination system.
          The PktPWd field may contain a 1-8 byte (NULL padded)
     password for the securing of links between systems.  If the
     link has no password protection, this field will contain 8
     NULL bytes.
          The ProdCode field contains a 0-65535 numerical value
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 17                   2 Jun 1997


     indicating the product code assigned by a relevant standards
     committee for the software package producing the packet.
          The ProdVer field contains a 0-65535 value.  The hi-
     order byte contains the major version number and the low-
     order byte the sub-version number.  The ProdCode and ProdVer
     fields are used to detect and assist in the elimination of
     format errors produced by errant software implementations.

          D.  Packet Body Format

          After a packet header, a type-10 packet will contain
     any number of packet "blocks".  Individual blocks may not
     exceed 30720 bytes (30 kilobytes) in length.  (This allows
     for easy buffering and data manipulation.)
          Each block is prefaced with a "block header" to define
     the type of information contained within the block:

               (* Block header structure -- Pascal format *)
               BlockHeaderRecord = RECORD
                    BlockID : longint;
                    BlockType : byte;
                    BlockLen : word;
                    BlockCRC : word;
               END;

               /* Block header structure -- C format */
               struct BlockHeaderRecord {long int blockid,
               unsigned char BlockType, unsigned int BlockLen,
               unsigned int BlockCRC}

          The BlockID field is used for error-checking purposes.
     It must alwasy be set to #22AAE0.
          The BlockType field contains a numerical value from 0-
     255 indicating the type of data contained within the block:

          #00 - Packet Terminator Block. (BlockLen and BlockCRC
     fields must be set to #0000.)  This block indicates an end-
     of-file.  Data beyond this point will be ignored.
          #01 - Command Block.  This block is for system-to-
     system commands and requests. This block is not yet
     implemented and will be detailed in a future revision to
     this document.
          #02 - Message Header Block.
          #03 - Seen-by Block.
          #04 - Path Block.
          #05 - Message Text Block.  (More than one successive
     #05 block may be used to hold the text of messages greater
     than the maximum block size.  In theory, this allows for
     truly unlimited-length message capability.  However,
     implementations which intend to communicate with older, type-
     2 are realistically limited to message sizes which can be
     adequately buffered by type-2 processors.)

          The BlockLen field indicates the number of bytes within
     the block.
          The BlockCRC field is optional.  If the value of field
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 18                   2 Jun 1997


     is other than #0000, then the field will contain the CRC
     value of the field data (excluding the Block Header).  This
     allows for some degree of integrity-checking on packet data.

          Following each Block Header will be BlockLen bytes of
     data of the type specified in the BlockType indicator.  A
     normal message would break down into a Message Header block
     (#02) followed by a Seen-by Block (#03), followed by a Path
     Block (#04), followed by one or more Message Text Blocks
     (#05).

          Some data areas will contain structured sub-fields.
     These are as follows:

          #02 - Message Header Block.  Each sub-field within this
          data block will be prefaced with a numerical sub-field
          identifier, followed by a single byte indicating the
          length (in bytes) of the sub-field, followed by the
          appropriate sub-field.  Sub-fields are as follows:

               #01 - From Name.  This is the ASCII name of the
          person who originally wrote the message.  This sub-
          field is required on all messages.
               #02 - To Name.  This is the ASCII name of the
          person to whom the message is directed.  This sub-field
          is required on all messages.
               #03 - Subject.  This is the ASCII representation
          of the originator-entered subject.
               #04 - Date/Time Group (binary -- length byte will
          always be #04).  This is the date and time the message
          was originally entered.  It is stored in the 32-bit
          "longint" format.  This is a "packed" time format used
          by MS-DOS to store file date/time records.  This or a
          #05 sub-field is required on all messages.
               #05 - Date/Time Group (ASCII -- length byte will
          always be #13).  This is an ASCII date/time
          representation of the origination date/time of the
          message in the format specified in the FTS-0001
          document (DD MMM YY  HH:MM:SS)  This or a #04 sub-field
          is required on all messages.
               #06 - MSGID line.  This is an FSC-0036 compliant
          MSGID line.  It is a required sub-field on all echomail
          messages.
               #07 - Origin Address (PacketAddress Format --
          length byte will always be #10).  This is the network
          address of the originating system of the message.  This
          sub-field is required on all messages.
               #09 - Destination Address Override (PacketAddress
          Format -- length byte will always be #10).  This sub-
          field contains an override for the destination address
          of the corresponding messages.  Processors should
          determine that each message is destined for the address
          listed in the PacketHeaderRecord except where
          specifically overridden in a #09 sub-field.
               #0A - Echomail Area Name.  This sub-field
          indicates the echomail area that the message is being
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 19                   2 Jun 1997


          distributed in.  This sub-field is required on all
          echomail messages.
               #0B - Origin Line.  This sub-field contains the
          origin line for echomail messages.  This sub-field is
          optional, but is realistically required on all
          implementations which intend to communicate using any
          older type-2 format.
               #0C - FLAGS line.  This sub-field contains the
          message attributes in FSC-0053 format.  The leading
          ASCII #01 (control-A) character should be excluded from
          this sub-field, but implementations should be tolerant
          of common minor FSC-0053 variations.
               #0D - Tear Line:  This sub-field contains a
          tearline (not to exceed 35 characters including the
          leading "---" characters.  This line is required on all
          echomail messages.
               #0E - PID Line:  This sub-field contains the
          optional Product Identification (PID) line.
               #0F - REPLY:  This sub-field contains the optional
          REPLY field, used with MSGID lines for message thread
          linking purposes on echomail messages.

          #03 - Seen-by Block.  The Seen-by Block contains
          address information of the systems which have "seen" an
          echomail message.  This data is used to prevent sending
          multiple copies of messages to a single system.  Seen-
          by blocks are required on all echomail messages.
          Implementations will append information for all
          addresses the local system is sending the current
          message to prior to actually sending any message.  Seen-
          by information for systems not in the same domain as
          the destination system must be excluded.  The local
          system's address information in a minimal requirement
          on all messages.
               The data is a series of two-byte integers.  The
          first four integers indicate (in order) the zone, net,
          node, and point number of the first address in the
          list.  This address serves as a "base" from which other
          addresses "evolve" as explained below:

               Positive value (greater than or equal to 0):  node
          number (zone and net information same as previous
          address and point number equals 0).
               Negative number (less than zero EXCEPT -32768):
          number multiplied by -1 equals new net number (absolute
          value).  Next number will be new node number.
               "Reset number" (-32768): indicates new full
          address block.  Next four integers will equate to (in
          order) the zone, net, node, and point number of next
          address in seen-by list.  Later addresses will "evolve"
          from this number.

               This storage format allows for an extremely
          flexible and compact method of storing seen-by
          information.

     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 20                   2 Jun 1997


          #04 - Path Block.  This block contains the addresses
          that the current message has passed through.  This
          information is maintained across all domain boundaries.
          Whenever a system processes a message, it adds its own
          address to the end of this list.  Address records are
          stored in PacketAddressRecord format.

     IV.  Development and Implementation Assistance

          As this is a proposal for a new standard, it is
     reasonable to expect ambiguities and problems to eventually
     develop in potential implementations of the standard.  The
     author of this standard is available to clarify matters of
     interpretation or ambiguity or problems in coding or
     implementation of the standard.  Public-domain code
     "snippets" of critical portions of the standard
     implementation will be made available when necessary and
     feasible.

     INTRODUCTION

       Many networks, using the Fido technology, are being created
     everywhere. It is now time to implement a means to provide gateway
     capability between these networks. Some proposals were made, but, as
     far as I know from reading most of the FSC standards, none of them
     actually play with the basic standards of Fidonet, as established in
     FSC-0001. It is time to think of other ways in which to improve Fido
     technology based on what is universally available, rather than
     relying on the infamous ^A kludges that many software packages out
     there don't use, or worse, ignore systematically.

     ABSTRACT

     From now on, the word FakeNet will be used to refer to any Fido-
     compatible network that is not in the Fidonet nodelist, thus using
     node numbers not found in the 1-thr-6 Fidonet zones.

     A Fakenet uses its own nodelist. There is a large number of Fakenets
     all over, one not knowing the existence of the other, some using the
     same node numbers in their own nodelists.  We shall try to put these
     networks together, not by forcing any of them into a single nodelist,
     but by making one aware of the existence of the others, and providing
     gateways in each of these networks so that mail can flow in both
     directions.

     IMPLEMENTATION

     For a gateway to be implemented, extra information must be provided
     in the netmail. Normally, two user names, From: and To: define the
     sender and the addressee. The node numbers go "inside" the netmail
     and have their existences checked in the nodelist of the network in
     question by the local running software.

     Since we now have 2 networks, the extra information must be the
     remote node in the destination network, which obviously cannot be
     found in the local nodelist, and the local node that must reach the
     remote addressee, otherwise a reply cannot be made.

     Suppose, for example, that there are 2 Fakenets, one based in zone 10
     (network 1), the other one in zone 11 (network 2), and that user John
     Green in node 10:100/1 wants to send a netmail to Paul Brown in
     11:200/1.

     In both networks, a gateway node (common to both nodelists) must be
     provided.  Let's say that node 10:10/1 is the gateway in network 1,
     named "Gateway system A"  and node 11:11/1, named "Gateway system B"
     is the gateway in network 2.

     What John, from network 1, will have to do is:

     Send a netmail to his local gateway node, which is 10:10/1.

     In the To: field, he will put, besides the name of the addressee,
     Paul Brown, PAUL'S NODE NUMBER, 11:200/1, inside (). This is the
     extra information needed for the gateway to work. What will happen
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 22                   2 Jun 1997


     is:

     This netmail, in the domain of network 1, will travel the route and
     reach the gateway, 10:10/1. This gateway system must do the
     following:

     Change the domain of the netmail from network 1 to network 2. This
     means that any reference to node numbers in the netmail header must
     be updated.

     Thus, the netmail will now have the node 11:11/1 as the originating
     node, and 11:200/1 as the destination node, "hardcoded" in its
     header. But we can see that John's node number must be provided,
     otherwise Paul will not be capable of replying.  This is done by the
     gateway software that includes John's node number in his From: name
     field, inside (). When Paul receives John's netmail, he will reply,
     and the From: field will automatically become the new To: field, and
     will contain John's name and node number. The netmail will reach back
     11:11/1 and the process will be exactly the same, finally reaching
     John.

     In resume, this is the odyssey of John's netmail to Paul:

     1 - John enters his message to Paul. Since Paul is not in John's
         network, John will have to use the gateway.

         He sends a netmail to his local gateway system, 10:10/1 which
         looks like this:

         From: John Green, John's BBS (10:100/1)
         To  : Paul Brown (11:200/1), Gateway System A (10:10/1)
         Re  : Hello
         ------

         body of message ......

     Note that John had to MANUALLY enter Paul's node number and put it in
     the To: field, together with Paul's name. This netmail is addressed
     to Gateway System A, node 10:10/1.

     2 - After arriving in 10:10/1, the gateway software will create a new
         netmail that looks like this:

         From: John Green (10:100/1), Gateway System B (11:11/1)
         To  : Paul Brown, Paul's BBS (11:200/1)
         Re  : Hello
         ----

         body of message....

     Note that John's node number was inserted in the From: field, which
     is the information needed for the bidirectional gateway to work.

     3 - This netmail is now in the domain of network 2. It will travel
     the normal route and reach Paul. When he replies, the local message
     editor will make the From: field become the To: field. The

     netmail-reply will look like this:

         From: Paul Brown, Paul's system (11:200/1)
         To  : John Green (10:100/1), Gateway System B (11:11/1)
         Re  : Hello
         ----

         body of new message.....

     This netmail will travel the route and reach 11:11/1. The process now
     is exactly the one used to gate the original netmail from network 1
     to 2. The gateway software will create a new netmail that looks like
     this:

       From: Paul Brown (11:200/1), Gateway System A (10:10/1)
       To  : John Green, John's system (10:100/1)
       Re  : Hello
       ----

       body of new message....

     Note that Paul's node number was inserted in the From: field,
     finishing the gateway process.

     The only trade-off in the current proposal is obvious. The limited
     length of the name fields, which, according to FSC-0001, is 36
     characters long, and that may not allow the inclusion of the person's
     node number in it.

     For example, if John's full name were John Green Richardson Smith
     Jr., he would have sent his netmail to Paul, but the gateway system
     would fail when attempting to include his node, 10:100/1 together
     with his name. In this case, the netmail is bounced back with a
     warning message, and it will be John's responsibility to change his
     name to a shorter one or use an alias. It seems that more and more
     people are being practical and using only 2-word names, so this is a
     problem that can be easily worked out by the local BBS operator.

     Lastly, ^aINTL kludges must be issued in all netmails gated between
     the 2 networks.

     This proposal follows FSC-0034 and FSC-0001. It also allows immediate
     aplication, since it relies on what is Fidonet in essence, FSC-0001.

     A gateway package was implemented for this purpose. MailGate (c),
     besides gating netmail and echomail between 2 or more Fakenets, also
     provides transparent gateway between a Fakenet and Internet,
     integrating lists and news with echomail and also providing a BBS
     with the feature of creating its own lists, that can flow as
     echomail through a Fido-compatible network, through the gateway
     between 2 fakenets, and also through Internet, as a mailing list.

     CONCLUSION

     Enhancing technology and creating new oportunities, necessary
     ingredients to allow systems and sysops to play their freedom of
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 24                   2 Jun 1997


     choice, are the best keys to improve Fidonet technology and make it
     really become the de facto standard, no matter which new network is
     created every day.

     I don't know how suitable this proposal is in regard to  the incoming
     problem Fidonet is facing, or will have to face, when all the
     nodelist zones split apart, since the size of the nodelist is growing
     alarmingly.

     My thanks to those who were prompt in helping me through the

     when trying to reach FTSC, (it finally reached the right place,
     Australia) especially Tom Jennings, Randy Bush and David Nugent.
     Thanks to Mitch Davis for helping me with some technical details.
     By no means am I saying that they support or have even read this
     document, it's only a thank you note.

     Fidonet is a trademark of Tom Jennings and Fido software, to whom we
     all owe many thanks for the origin and spirit of Fidonet.

     I am the very model of a Usenet individual,
     I've information meaningless and ultimately trivial,
     I know the basic elements of alien biology,
     And all the hidden secrets of the Church of Scientology,
     I've seen "The Wrath of Khan" and every Star Trek film that followed
     it,
     I moan about my Servicecard and how the cash till swallowed it,
     About the laws on handguns I am sending off a counterblast,
     With many cheerful facts about the way you can MAKE MONEY FAST!

             ALL: With many cheerful etc.

     I'll tell you why the Japanese are taking over Panama,
     And why the USA is still a better place than Canada,
     In short, in matters meaningless and ultimately trivial,
     I am the very model of a Usenet individual.

             ALL: In short, in matters meaningless and ultimately trivial,
             He is the very model of a Usenet individual.

     I post in alt.revisionism lies about the Holocaust,
     I cut my .sig to twenty lines, I didn't want to, I was forced,
     I really can't believe the "Good Times" virus to be mythical,
     And Clinton's raising taxes which is, frankly, bloody typical,
     I've upset several people on alt.flame, I really don't know how,
     And sent a thousand business cards to Mr. and Mrs. Shergold now,
     I have a very poor grip of political geography,
     And absolutely no involvement (yet!) in child pornography,

             ALL: And absolutely no, etc.

     I've paid two-fifty dollars for the Nieman-Marcus recipe,
     And told the Spanish tourist's tale about the toothbrush pessary,
     In short, in matters meaningless and ultimately trivial,
     I am the very model of a Usenet individual.

             He is the very model of a Usenet individual.

     In fact, when I know what is meant by "binary" and "FTP",
     When I know how to decode porno JPEGs from a .uue,
     When I can handle HTML, Telnet, mail and IRC,
     And when I know the words initialised to form "http",
     When I have learnt what topics are acceptable in talk.bizarre,
     When I know more of Usenet than the tailpipe of a motor-car,
     In short, when I've a smattering of elementary netiquette,
     You'll say a better individual has never surfed the Net.

             ALL: You'll say a better individual, etc.

     For my technical experience, although I claim to know it all
     Could barely serve to run the installation disk from AOL;
     But still, in matters meaningless and ultimately trivial,
     I am the very model of a Usenet individual.

     =================================================================


     New haven, CT USA - 06/01/97 -

     Fidonet echos are available for internet users. Smokey's Lair BBS,
     formally of Dallas, TX, more recently of New Haven, CT, has been
     watching the current trend of disappearing FidoNet BBSes with alarm.
     The quality of available echos and conferences on these systems far
     outweighs ANYTHING that can be found on the internet. The FidoNet
     echos have experts in all fields, have good in depth conversation
     without the spamming that is found so often on the net.

     In hopes that we can help bring back life to some of the conferences
     and echos that are dropping like flies we have made them available to
     those of you fidonet users that have lost your local BBSes or just
     prefer the ease of use of the internet. It is our hope that you will
     once again re-join the FidoNet family.

     Here is how it works:

     1. You must have an internet connect, be it dial-up, employer network,
     or anything else that connects you. If your using a LAN, you must know
     how to get through the firewall. I'm sorry we can't help you on that
     one.

     2. You must have a newsreader. This could be something like Microsoft
     netNews, Netscape News, Chameleon, Trumpet, or Free Agent from Forte.
     I use Free Agent and find it the best.

     3. Find the location in your setup that defines the news server.
     Change this to newn.com

     4. Connect and let it pick up a listing of all news groups. This can
     take 10 or 15 minutes, so be prepared to wait.

     5. You can subscribe to any newsgroup, but be aware, the only active
     ones are the FidoNet ones. These all start with "fido." and the echo
     name.

     6. Once you have selected those that you want to read, have at `em.
     Please follow the moderators rules for each echo. Remember, in FidoNet
     NO ADVERTISING is allowed except where specifically included. This
     includes spam (Internet junk mail).

     Please, if you are trying to read an echo and find no activity for a
     couple days, send me net-mail. This can either be done to Chris Molnar
     @ 1:141/635 or cmolnar@newn.com. Most likely I haven't turned on the
     echo, but will be happy to do it for you.

     A word to echo moderators: We are a FidoNet node, the echos are NOT
     being gated to the internet. We are not passing these echos to other
     systems, we insist that the users connect to our system to read and
     post.
     FIDONEWS 14-22               Page 29                   2 Jun 1997


     A word to the users: We maintain a log that includes your machine
     name, host, and internet feed for every article posted. This is an
     electronic signature and is yours. We will not tolerate abuse, this
     includes spamming.  Please do not jeopardize our system, but help us
     try and maintain the Fido Family.

     If you run an FTC compatible network, and you would like your net
     added to this type of distribution please contact us, we will not
     charge for this service. Please, however be aware the following rules
     apply:

     1. We will not place long distance calls to carry your network. You
     may however drop mail packets off via FTP. It is your responsibility
     to get and receive mail from us. We do not charge for carrying your
     network, and we maintain a dedicated internet connect, therefore we
     believe that you can maintain the cost of distribution to and from us.

     2. We will not carry multiple AKAs. We believe the FidoNet address
     structure can easily identify our system and if you want us to make
     your network available to internet users, you can adjust.

     3. We do not screen users accessing the echos. We do not screen the
     messages being sent. We are an information provider and the content of
     your network is not our business. This protects us from legal harm.
     However, we believe that you as the Network Coordinator are
     responsible for following US law when creating and administering your
     network. Be it that your network originates outside or inside the
     United States as we are proudly a U.S. based system.

     Please ask us if you have any questions!
