                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                        FidoNews is Back on the Air!

     Sorry for the recent interruption,  gang.  Our  glorious  90  meg
     drive  (I've since discovered that we're pikers in the disk space
     game -- one sysop I know told me he has a 120 meg drive!)  rolled
     over  and  died,  making horrible noises along the way and taking
     all our .BAT files with it.  We got it replaced quickly,  but the
     new  drive kept finding new bad sectors,  on the order of a dozen
     or so a day.  Then I had to leave for two weeks,  and didn't have
     time to fix it before going.

     But now I'm back, and another new drive was waiting for me.  It's
     now installed and tested, and is looking solid.  If I reconstruc-
     ted all the files properly, you might even get this issue on time
     (crossed fingers).

     While  the  new  drive  is smaller than the old (77 meg versus 90
     meg),  it is also a half-height where the old drive was  a  full-
     height,  so  we can add another 77 meg any time we need it.  With
     that much storage,  I think we'll be able to keep a full  set  of
     FidoNews back issues online for quite awhile to come.

     In  other  news,  we've added two sections to FidoNews -- Minutes
     and Committee Reports.  These come after the notices,  and it  is
     our  intention  that  IFNA  business  articles  will  go in those
     sections so that readers uninterested in what IFNA is  doing  can
     stop  reading  once  they  reach  the  notices  and  thus  not be
     bothered.

     Now the bad news.  Dave Dodell  asked  me  to  write  an  article
     explaining zones,  particularly how to use the zone gates and how
     all the pieces fit together.  So I spent a couple of days writing
     it all down.  You guessed it -- it was lost in the disk crash.  I
     really hate rewriting stuff,  and I'm still trying  to  catch  up
     from  my  two week absence,  so.  .  .  The only REALLY important
     thing in the article dealt with XlatList modes of  operation.  We
     goofed  up  in the XlatList docs for the latest version and never
     described the changes.  The latest XlatList can  generate  output
     in any of three "modes", as follows:

      1) SEAdog mode    This produces a NODELIST.BBS for your own zone
                        only, with hubs left in.

      2) FIDO mode      This produces a  NODELIST.BBS  for  Fido  v12,
                        which  gives  all  zones and retaines the ZONE
                        prefixes.

      3) OPUS mode      This produces a NODELIST.BBS for your own zone
                        only,  with hubs not in your own net  removed,
                        and with the node list comment flags retained.

     Some folks running Opus or Fido 11w got the latest  XlatList  and
     FidoNews 4-40                Page 2                    2 Nov 1987


     started  running it in FIDO mode (which used to be correct),  and
     got a NODELIST.BBS that their software  could  not  handle.  They
     should now use OPUS mode.

     I'll try to find time to rewrite that article one of these days.


     There  are  some  other  projects  underway  that should make for
     interesting  reading.   Al  Arango  is  now  in  the  process  of
     interviewing the IFNA Board of Directors,  and will be publishing
     a series of articles introducing you to them.  We're also working
     with Don Daniels  on  getting  timely  status  reports  from  the
     plethora  of committees for this and that.  And of course,  we're
     always ready, willing, and eager to hear from you.  We're back up
     and rolling,  so keep those articles coming!  Remember,  FidoNews
     is YOUR newsletter!

                         Fee-Paid Systems Revisited
                        Another look an an old gripe

     I would like to respond to Bill Paul's article in  the  Sept  28,
     1987 issue of the Fido News, dealing with Fee Paid systems.

     I run Plato's Retreat in El Paso,  Texas, and I consider it to be
     a free system.  I allow almost  all  callers  access,  I  do  not
     require a fee,  but I do strongly request (NOT require) donations
     to help me pay for the expenses related to this bbs.

     I would like to take very strong  exception  to  a  part  of  Mr.
     Paul's article, and that is where he equates asking for donations
     with  "fee  paid  boards,"  or boards that are in the business to
     make money.  I can also understand sysops who require  people  to
     pay  a  fee  to access their boards,  or at least to pay a fee to
     access a part of their boards, when they do it to help offset the
     expenses of running the board.

     I have been a sysop of  various  boards  using  various  software
     programs  for  about  6  years  now.  I have been through BBS PC,
     PCBoard, RBBS, and now Opus. Across the board (no pun intended) I
     have had very high numbers of  callers  from  across  the  United
     States,  Canada,  and  Europe,  and  I  attribute this fact to my
     ability to run a good board as well as to the amount  of  time  I
     invest  in  it.  The  former  is a talent and cannot be measured,
     while the latter translates to about  3  hours  every  day,  plus
     another  2  to  3  hours each on Saturdays and Sundays.  I do not
     think that in this I am different from thousands of other  sysops
     worldwide.

     In  terms  of  equipment,  I have an XT (soon to be upgraded to a
     386) with a 40 Megabyte Hard Drive, a 1200 baud modem (soon 2400,
     as soon as I can get the initialization strings to work),  and  a
     300 cps printer,  all dedicated to the board, ie not used for any
     other applications.  My monthly telephone bill JUST for the  line
     used  for the board exceeds $250.  Although this is by no means a
     lot of equipment or especially expensive, in comparison with some
     of the sysops I know,  I am  mentioning  it  to  illustrate  that
     sysops go to quite considerable expenses for their hobby.

     I understand that Mr.  Paul has done the same, and I am happy for
     him that he can afford to run it all out of  his  own  pocket.  I
     understand  that  there  are  some very wealthy people who invest
     substantial amounts  of  money  to  see  that  Fido  is  a  truly
     international efford.  The vast bulk of sysops,  I venture to say
     however,  are not independently wealthy and cannot afford to  pay
     from  $250  to over $1000 a month in some cases month after month
     after month.
     FidoNews 4-40                Page 4                    2 Nov 1987


     I realize that this is a hobby. I do not believe that there are a
     lot of sysops who are in this for the money. But callers also get
     something out of it.  They too participate in the message  bases,
     they  too  laugh and argue and pound the keyboard in frustration.
     This is not a  one  way  street  for  anyone,  sysop  or  caller.
     Contrary  to popular opinion,  very few sysops are in this to get
     easy copies of pirated software,  and public domain software  can
     be  obtained  by  anyone,  even  without  going to the trouble of
     dedicating $2,000 to $10,000 worth of hardware  and  software  to
     the task 24 hrs a day.

     If  we  agree  that this is indeed a two way street,  the callers
     should become aware that it is at least their moral obligation to
     share in the expenses, and not only to reap the benefits paid for
     out of the sysop's personal funds.

     There is one more aspect to this which ought to be addressed.  In
     6  years of sysopping,  there is little that frustrates me more -
     and I venture to say that most sysops feel this  way  -  than  to
     have  a caller call for the first time,  and the second,  and the
     third, and so on, just to download,  and download,  and download.
     He doesn't leave a message,  doesn't introduce himself,  and when
     he is confronted by a sysop who asks him "Hi,  how would you like
     to  upload  some  of  YOUR  things  to  us?"  he  displays a self
     righteous demeanor  and  acts  as  though  it  is  his  god-given
     birthright to rape and pillage every bbs that his modem can reach
     -  even  with stolen MCI codes,  if he can get them,  but that is
     another story - without any obligation,  duty,  or  debt  to  the
     sysop or to the other callers.  This is a behavior pattern shared
     by the same people who oppose contributing reasonable amounts  of
     money  to help with the expenses of something that is their hobby
     as much as the sysop's. Not surprising is the fact that those who
     donate money also seem to be those who upload consistently, while
     those who don't donate anything also don't tend to upload, unless
     they are forced  to  do  so  with  ratios  and  other  unfriendly
     tactics.

     And  then  Mr.  Paul  reinforces  this  behavior pattern with his
     statement "The callers ...  don't owe me anything;  in fact I owe
     THEM  more than I could ever begin to express." It is sysops like
     Mr.  Paul who, to a substantial part, cause sponges, and leeches,
     and  whatever  else  we  want  to  call  them.  I  used to have a
     questionnaire in which I asked "How do you feel  about  paying  a
     small amount of money to help with the expenses of this bbs?" and
     I still recall vividly MANY answers that said something like "Why
     should  I  pay  anything?  There  are many bbs out there that are
     free,  and as long as they are there,  I will not pay." In effect
     they are telling me: "I will use you for everything I can get out
     of  you.  When  you get tired of it,  or can't afford it anymore,
     then I will use someone else.  And I will keep using  them  until
     there  is  nobody  left to use." And then Mr.  Paul asks me,  and
     other readers of his article, the question: "I'd be interested in
     knowing ...  what you offer users that is  unavailable  elsewhere
     for  free."  An education in manners,  Mr.  Paul,  that is what I
     would like to offer them.

     FidoNews 4-40                Page 5                    2 Nov 1987


     Mr.  Paul feels that charging a fee obligates him to the callers.
     Does it really?  There is a school of thought that goes something
     like this:  If a caller spends a substantial amount of  time  and
     effort  in participating in a conference,  especially if he calls
     long distance,  then it is the host's obligation to  ensure  that
     the  conference is not abruptly stopped because of the negligence
     of the host.  Thus,  the host takes a certain  responsibility  to
     back  up his system and to try to reactivate the board in case of
     a crash within a reasonable time period.  I  do  not  argue  with
     this,  and  in  over 6 years my board has not had any unscheduled
     and unannounced downtimes that lasted longer than 24 hrs. But how
     does it change this obligation if the hosts says "Hey guys,  this
     is costing me a lot of money. How about if you chip in to help me
     pay  the  bills?"  This  is no more a "profit" than if I offer to
     give someone a ride to a city 100 miles away, to which I am going
     anyway, if I ask the rider to help me pay for the gas.

     And to clear up a misunderstanding:  The IRS is not interested in
     your income, it's interested in your profits!

     I hope I make my point clear.  I too welcome comments,  which you
     may send to 381/20 (directly, or if you have problems sending it,
     route   it  through  381/1).   You  may  also  call  directly  to
     (915) 545-2752 or  mail  any  replies,  comments,  questions,  or
     whatever by US  Mail  to  Plato's  Retreat  BBS,  6112  N.  Mesa,
     Suite 103, El Paso, TX 79912.

     Anton Johnson
     National Family Forum 161/56

                  Open Letter about National Family Forum

     Dear Sysops and Bulletin Board Friends,

             Several days ago I was slandered  through  the  entry  of
     messages  into  Fido  mail  that  were  considered  to be of a an
     unethecial and offensive nature.  There were a  individuals  that
     were  very  supportive to me during this attack.  I wish to thank
     you for your support! It greatly encouraged me.

             For those of you that do not know me I  wish  to  provide
     you  with  a  short background on myself and my BBS I have been a
     System Operator (Sysop) for over 6 1/2  years.  It  has  been  my
     policy  that message or file content that may be considered to be
     offensive to users is not permitted on my system.  I run  a  semi
     open  system.  New  users  are  granted full access to the system
     witin 24 hours after their first phone call.  New users  are  not
     required  to register unless they want to.  In addition new users
     are not required to pay any fees to access the NFF.

             The  NFF  operates  using  The  Bread  Board  System  BBS
     software.  To  share  in  Fidonet I use Seadog.  There is an open
     reward that is offered on my  system.  If  anyone  can  crash  my
     system,  tell me how they did it and it is not caused by an error
     on my part in the way I  configure  my  system  I  pay  out  $100
     dollars.  During  the period of time that I have operated TBBS no
     one has yet to collect that reward.  No one has ever  crashed  my
     system  and  they  have not obtained entry to the system using my
     Sysop userlog entry. Many have tried without success.

             The National Family Forum is a family oriented system. It
     also is a Christian BBS. I can assure everyone that the offensive
     messages that carried the name of my system and my name  did  not
     originate on the National Family Forum.  It is my personal policy
     that when offensive messages appear on my system  from  my  users
     that I remove them as soon as they are seen. It is also my policy
     that  if  individuals  that use Fido Net enter offensive messages
     into the system that I kill all messages from them in the future.
     If I feel it is warranted I will send Net-Mail to that person  on
     the  node  the  message  originated  on.   I  no  longer  "flame"
     individuals in echo mail.  Most individuals do not want  to  read
     such  private  messages  and  it does nothing to directly improve
     message content in Echo Mail.

                             Sincerely Yours,
                             Anton Johnson

     Eric Ewanco, 1:130/3

                          Shrinking the Node List

         In October 5th's issue of FidoNews,  there was  a  column  by
     Aaron Priven about shrinking the nodelist,  and although I highly
     respect his purpose, I must comment on his proposed methods.

         First of all,  removing the name  of  the  board  is  totally
     ridiculous. When I read a message, I like to know what board it's
     from.  I  do  not  work  by  numbers,  I work by names!  I cannot
     immediately recognize that 125/111  is  Fido  Software,  or  that
     109/639 is Renex BBS. In addition, when it's calling, I'd like to
     know then and there if I entered the right number.

         As for the Sysop name,  and for SEAdog's USERLIST feature,  I
     use it all the time and it is the primary feature of SEAdog  that
     I  miss in Opus.  It is SO annoying to have to remember someone's
     node number;  or,  if I don't know them,  I just like to say,  "I
     want to send a letter to Bob Hartman, wherever he is." SEAdog can
     oblige. I don't want to have to look it up. In fact, I _couldn't_
     if we removed the names.

         As  for  the  flags,  I  would like to know who has SEAdog or
     equivalent,  although it's not that important.  But,  some boards
     are  "Mail  Only" (mine,  except for a very few people) and don't
     want people picking their name off the nodelist  without  knowing
     that  I won't be accepting human callers.  We can shorten them to
     one character, tho.

         The least useful field is the city/state,  but I still  think
     it should be kept. I agree with shortening the baud rate to about
     one character (1[200],  2[400], 3[00], 4[800], 9[600]) and I also
     believe that hex numbers would be faster  to  convert  and  would
     take up less space.

         We could shorten !_Unpublished to just !,  and for gosh sake,
     WHY is the nodelist distributed with 1- added to the  number?  We
     could save 4k right there!

         End  of line characters:  CR/LF is convenient for C,  but ...
     if we made it LF it could be handled WITHOUT text mode conversion
     and would be faster to operate on.  For those who need to edit by
     hand,  we  COULD conceivable make a utility for conversion.  This
     would only save about 2k, though. Or is that significant?

         Some fields could be made fixed, and we can eliminate some of
     the commas.  Or,  we could write some  fields  in  BINARY  format
     (node/net)  or  packed  decimal  (phone).  But  then  writing  or
     maintaining a private nodelist would be difficult.

         Thus is my rebuttle. Comments should be directed to:

         U.S. Robotics, Hayes to Share High-Speed Modem Technology


     Skokie,Ill.,October  21   --   Modem   industry   leaders   Hayes
     Microcomputer Products,Inc.,  and U.S.Robotics,  Inc., will share
     proprietary,  high-speed modem technology under terms of a newly-
     signed cross-licensing agreement.

     The  pact  could  lead  both  companies  to  manufacture  signal-
     compatible modems  operating  at  9600  bps  and  higher  speeds,
     potentially  boosting  a  market  that  cautiously  has awaited a
     standard technology for competing products.

     Despite the agreement, however, U.S. Robotics said that is has no
     immediate  plans   to   manufacture   modems   employing   Hayes'
     technology.

     U.S.  Robotics,  based here,  has gained a license to manufacture
     modems  using  Hayes'  proprietary  error-control  protocol   and
     modulation  technique  currently  implemented in Hayes' 9600- and
     2400-bps V-Series modems.

     Hayes,  of Norcross,  Ga.,  becomes a licensee of U.S.  Robotics'
     proprietary  high-speed  modem  tecnolgy  used  in  its  9600-bps
     Courier HST modem.

     The agreement also includes cross-licensing of any new inventions
     by both companies during the next three years.

     "This agreement also gives us more technological  flexibility  in
     responding   to   potential   demand  for  certain  features  and
     capabilities," said U.S. Robotics President Casey Cowell.

     "Any future enhancements to the Courier HST that derive from this
     agreement will  be  appropriate  to  meeting  market  demand  and
     anticipating long-term market development," Cowell continued. "We
     intend  in  any  future  versions  of the Courier HST to maintain
     operational compatibility with all previously sold HST modems."

     Both companies declined to declined to reveal terms of the cross-
     licensing agreement.

        Deadlines?   We  don't have no deadlines.  We don't  need  no
     deadlines!  We don't need no stinking deadlines!

                                  -------

        Lately  there has been a move toward placing Matrix  software
     into  free distribution,  with source code distributed too.  I'm
     not  going  to get into this subject very far,  but I really  am
     glad to see it happen.  I  love the idea of the Matrix as a free
     source of information.  The idea of all of us helping the common
     good, more for everybody, is perhaps one of the best things that
     could have happened in the Age of Information that John Naisbitt
     and other futurists are always talking about. I don't know if we
     can make a real difference in the rest of the world,  but I hope
     that  our  concepts  of  free distribution extend themselves  to
     others -- not just that others may join the net and take part in
     it,  but that people may discover that free distribution is good
     for *all* media -- not just computery ones.

        Now  I'm  not  suggesting that everybody  de-copyright  their
     books and music and let everybody have it for free --  just as I
     wouldn't  suggest that everyone de-copyright their software  and
     put  it  on BBS's.  What I am saying is that there is a  lot  of
     information out there  that  has  always been absolutely free --
     but inaccessible.

        Take an example close to my heart (or my stomach). In 1977  a
     friend of mine who happens  to  be my mother compiled a cookbook
     called "Family Cooking"  -- she took recipes from all her aunts,
     cousins, sisters-in-law,  and other relatives, and put it all in
     a 150-page book which she basically made herself.  She typed  it
     out on an IBM Executive typewriter,  and printed it a local copy
     shop.   It  turned out really nice,  but she made no  more  than
     twenty copies -- all of which went to our relatives.

        Why didn't we give it away to other people? How could we?  We
     would  have had to buy the paper,  which would have cost  money,
     and  if  we'd tried to sell it we would have had to make a  very
     risky  investment,   which we simply were not prepared to  make.
     (And realistically,  there are so many cookbooks out that  "just
     another  homestyle  cookbook"   would have had no  chance  at  a
     publisher.) So fifteen copies are in the hands of our relatives,
     and we have five copies left,  and the rest of the people in the
     world are stuck.

        So  this  year we're thinking about updating it.   We'd  take
     advantage  of newer technology,  and desktop-publish it in  high
     FidoNews 4-40                Page 10                   2 Nov 1987


     style.   We  would  also  release  the  text  of  it  into  free
     distribution.   We can now do this --  all we have to do is take
     the text, convert it to ASCII (which it will be in anyway),  ARC
     it and file-attach it to various BBS's.  That's all it takes now
     to give something away free. Big difference from 1977.

        The  point of this column is to get the rest of you  thinking
     about things like that. Maybe you're a leech type who would like
     to contribute, but can't because you can't write a line of code.
     You  don't have to!  If you can write a story,  or a  poem,   or
     relate an anecdote,  or anything along that line,  then you  are
     perfectly  well  off;  a  good story is at least as good as  the
     latest user-supported arcade game.
