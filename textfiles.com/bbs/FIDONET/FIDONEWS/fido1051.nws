wow. Am i ever depressed ... just saw somewhere in an echo ...
some guy totally-pro-free-speach and totally-anti-cencorship,
who believes so because 'christians" should be allowed to
discriminate  against  homo-sexuals,  because  to  be real
'christians" they must do that, and 'they' shouldn't  be
discriminated against for their traditional views. what a WIERD
agrument. Who's traditinal views?.  dunno.  Gotta like that
variety of opinionations, but there's smething wrong with it.
can't put my finger on what particular wrong it is, because that
one's hiding under a rock away from the light of day.

No UUCP in Sysop Name Field, Please

by Jeff Johnson (1:363/888, !CM)
An Argument Against Using UUCP in the Sysop Name Field

   A few issues back, Jim Northrup wrote an article stating how he
felt the use of UUCP in the sysop name field of the nodelist would aid
those attempting to send UUCP or Internet mail in locating a gateway.
I think it's more trouble than it's worth.  Following is a quote from
his article:

Consider the usage of "UUCP" in the sysop name feild, when used
by many seperate sites in various regions of the nodelist,
providing a simple choice of gateways for use in an instant if
there be a nodelist lookup for the name "UUCP".

In my own eyes, this seems a very simple and straightfoward
solution to a pile of misdesigned solutions to a simple problem.
It only comes natural to do what's easiest (speaking for myself
only).

[End quote]

   I too wish to do what's easiest, and that is exactly why I am
against the use of UUCP as a name.  Consider this: most of the people
who will be doing nodelist lookups are sysops, right?  I mean, unless
a sysop has a BBS program which allows nodelist lookups, users aren't
going to have to worry about which gateway they want to send their
messages to.  More than likely the sysop has a dedicated area for such
messages which are automatically forwarded to a gateway.

   This brings up my second point: the average sysop (or user) does
not just sit down and say, "I think I'll send a message through the
Internet," and fire one off.  I know I did a LOT of research before I
understood the difference between UUCP, Internet, ...!uuvax!joeblow,
xxx@fyyy.nzzz.zq.fidonet.org, and all that stuff, and one of the
things I learned was the address of my local Fido/UUCP gateway.  There
shouldn't be that many of them in your area.  I live in a medium-sized
city (Orlando), and we only have two.  Granted, if you live near a
large college, there may be a few more, but you will more than likely
learn who they are long before you write an Internet-destined
FidoNews 10-51                 Page:  3                    19 Dec 1993

message.

   All this leads up to why I think UUCP in the name field is
cumbersome: when I go to send a message through FrontDoor, I hit
<Insert> and type UUCP in the To: field.  For the longest time, I
would then immediately type 42 (my gateway) and get on with the rest.
Then one day a little window popped up.  FrontDoor found somebody in
the nodelist named UUCP!  I therefore had to hit <F10> to enter my
gateway's address.  This is an extra step, and not what I consider
doing "what's easiest."

   In summary, I feel that if you're going to send mail through a UUCP
gateway, you probably know who that gateway is, and there's no need
for your editor software to give you a lookup window.  Either way
you're going to have to choose the destination manually, by typing in
the address or selecting from a window.  Typing in the address is the
quickest from where I stand.  Let's leave the sysop name field for
sysop names.

Usenet Newsgroups for Fidonet Systems
by: Phillip M. Dampier
1:2613/228

                   USENET NEWSGROUPS FROM AROUND THE WORLD
                             FOR FIDONET SYSTEMS

A group of forward-thinking Fidonet SysOps have developed an
international echomail distribution system, similar to Fidonet's Zone
1 Echomail Backbone, which offers usenet newsgroups in Fidonet
echomail format.

This system, known as COBRUS, continually receives over 5,250
newsgroups each day from around the world, on stand-alone, dedicated
mailservers, converts them into Fidonet echomail format, and
distributes them to other Fidonet systems that elect to receive them.

These newsgroups include the seven major hierarchies (alt, comp, misc,
sci, soc, rec, talk) in addition to many newsgroups from other parts
of the world like Russia, France, Australia, Germany, etc., and
regional newsgroups that are usually limited in geographic
distribution (i.e. ca, tx, ny, etc.).  COBRUS automatically receives
all new newsgroups when they are created.  The system also provides
Internet/uucp mail for Fidonet systems using these newsgroups.

Members of Fidonet can receive these newsgroups using the same
software that they use now for Fidonet.  All the conversions are done
by COBRUS.  Fidonet SysOps just treat each newsgroup like a Fidonet
echomail conference.  The mailer and tosser/scanner they are currently
using is all the software needed to read and post in the newsgroups.

For a list of more than 5,250 newsgroups currently available, file
request ACTIVE.ZIP from 1:2613/333 or 1:2613/228.  A variety of feeds
are available - ZyXEL modems, USR Dual Standards, 28.8 V.FC modems,
FidoNews 10-51                 Page:  4                    19 Dec 1993

etc.  Sites utilizing different long-distance carriers are also
available.

Seward as follows:

Censorship?  Just say NO!

by Bryan Price, Burning Point 1742
1:226/250

Daniel Hagan's letter has struck a note with me.  To wit:

>I can understand your reasoning in trying to allow "freedom of the
>press", but there comes a point where common sense must be exercised.

Just *who's* common sense?

>As editor, it is your responsibility to overview the article
>submissions and *NOT* just to be looking for ARTSPEC.DOC infractions.
>I'm sure someone could write a program to handle that task if that's
>all there is to your position.

>Case in point: Your local newspaper has a "Letter to the Editor"
>section which is as close as it comes to a Fidonews type delivery.
>In that area, even though you are free to express whatever thoughts
>you have on a subject, articles like those published in recent and
>past Fidonews would never make print. Why? Because it is assumed you
>should be able to make your point without resorting to the types of
>terms used in the .A46 release. Freedom of speech, YES...freedom to
>print whatever arrives merely for "shock" value, NO!

Shock value *is* a form of expression, and therefore *is* protected
by Freedom of Expression.  The U.S. Constitution does *not* guarantee
Freedom of Speech, as everybody likes to put it, but Freedom of
Expression.  An important distinction.  But enough of the lesson on
citizenship.

You point to newspapers as an example.  So be it.  Here in Columbus,
OH we have been reduced to one major daily newspaper.  Of course, it
you read the editorials, you're going to find what some people call
"decent" langauage.  Why?  Because they cannot afford to get some
people upset, as you obviously are.  But their reasons are *not*
simply to get the news out.  This is a *major commercial* company.
They can't afford any real controversy, otherwise they may drop both
readers *and more importantly* advertisers.

Now, on the other hand, we currently have 3 alternative weekly
FidoNews 10-51                 Page:  5                    19 Dec 1993

newspapers.  While they're out to make a buck, they are following a
higher calling, reporting on things that the major paper doesn't want
to report, such as the major bailout of Ameriflora '92.  They also
have no compunction about using four letter words in letters to the
editor, news articles, and *even* editorials by the editors!  Even the
advertisers get into the act.  "Seriously Headfuct", while being
somewhat profane is also somewhat profound.

>As editor(s) of Fidonews, you should consider resigning the position
>due to malfeasance. Fidonet is supposed to be a community network.
>Its official publication should also follow suit with its overall
>appearance and content matter being much like that of a community
>newspaper or publication. In short, acceptable to all age groups.

The editors are not public officials, therefore malfeasance really
doesn't apply.

In my past example of the weekly newspapers, all three are
"community" newspapers, available for FREE.  You just walk into a
bookstore, newstand, just about anywhere and pick one up.  I haven't
seen *any* indication that church groups, or anybody else for that
matter are calling for them to "mend their ways".

>...
>As NC for my net, I am
>required to "make Fidonews available" and that it may even "encourage
>new sysops to join Fidonet."
>...
>If these types of articles are going to continue, I will
>still "make Fidonews available" as required by Policy 4, however it
>will be by File Request only and no copies will be available to users
>off of my system. I will also discontinue collecting back issues as
>I currently do.

If that's the way you feel, then go ahead.  I'd also make sure that
you no longer read it, since it offends you so much.  That's too bad,
because I think you'll be missing out.

As a side note, I reviewed A46 to see just what was so bad.  Two four
letter words.  One, I know I've heard many a time from both parents,
usually in a sentence as "You little ----!"  The other one I didn't
pick up until high school, at least as a curse.  Does that make me
demented?  I don't think so, not for being called a little piece of
defecation.  (Does *THAT* make you feel better??)  Overall, I
certainly had no problem with them being in the issue.

My Viewpoint on the Editor's duties.
By Brendan Keyport, 1:138/185 (SuperNet 43:1240/401, Worldnet 62:420/20)
=========

Here is my ViewPoint on the editor's duties as relating to FIDONEWS:

1) It's their job, let them do it. Look at this: Without these folks, There
may not even be a FIDONEWS to read. Imagine FIDONET without FIDONEWS...
Because there is not a Global 'Required' Echo, there would be no sounding
board for your viewpoint. Yes, some may argue that there are international
SYSOP echos, but, do YOU carry ALL OF THEM?

2) The Editor(s) should only edit to meet up with accepted standards
for publication. Accepted standards as far as I'm concerned is (based on my
local newspapers' standards):
     a) No Obsenity (As Accepted by the public in general)
     b) Written as center to the issue as possible (No one sided articles)
     c) Make your point clearly.
     d) Assure spelling and grammer match the 6th Grade level.
         (6th grade level is where reading is easiest for most folks)
     e) NO CENSORSHIP, unless there is valid reasoning as outlined
        above, and in that case, only editing to meet guidelines.

3) Publish on a regular basis, and in a format all can read. This currently
   is being only done part-way... FidoNews has a great schedule, but some
   computer platforms cannot read/decompress LZH files. Use of ARC (the Fido
   Standard one) would be preferred.

Comments are welcome, please write reply articles to FIDONEWS instead of my
address.

Thanks.
Brendan
