     =================================================================


                           The Fidonet (R)evolution
                                  Doug Myers

     This week in the Z1C Echo, David Moufarrege announced the
     appointment of Gary Gilmore as the Region 11 Coordinator, replacing
     Martin Belcke who has resigned for personal reasons.  Indeed, this
     issue features an article by Gary, making this announcement and
     going over his plans for the immediate future.

     While Martin's personal reasons for stepping down are undisclosed as
     yet, this editor sincerely hopes that no tragedy has marred his life
     and that the future will find him back in the echoes.  Martin was an
     entertaining corrospondant over the years - his contribution to the
     conversation was possibly greater than his administrative
     contributions to Fido.

     Martin Belcke was a long-time coordinator appointed at a time when
     the tradition of elections in Fidonet was not so strong.  Though he
     served as Regional Coordinator well, and seemed to enjoy popular
     support from those in his region, he was often criticized because he
     wouldn't take the initiative to hold elections in his own region.

     Gary Gilmore has wisely chosen to reverse this stance and put his
     own appointment on the line in a regional election.

     This editor applauds that decision.  Though elections are not
     specified in Fidonet policy, they are clearly desired by the sysops
     who comprise Fidonet.  Revolutionary methods to mandate such
     elections have not gathered much support in the past, but the more
     peaceful evolutionary process is slowly but surely bringing Fidonet
     to this ideal.  May we call Gary the latest leader in the Fidonet
     (R)evolution?

                         Region 11 Coordinator Change
                           Gary Gilmore, 1:2410/400

     Just to keep everyone up to date (since not everyone stays in touch
     like they should)...  Martin Belcke has stepped down as RC11 and
     named me the new RC11. This has been confirmed by our Z1C, and is in
     the current nodelist.

     You'll notice I've placed "(Temp)" in the listing, since I will
     consider myself temporary RC11 until a few things happen.  Those
     are:

     1) Get over the heart attack of the sudden change in RC11.  <laugh>

     2) Get nodelist processing straightened out, and make a clean, easy
        to operate system in place for me, or to pass along to whomever
        becomes "permanent" RC11.  (I've got the target, just need
        someone to pin it on.)

     3) Hold an election for RC11.  I will be talking to the Z1C about
        this, and get his feelings (as well as those of the other Zone1
        RCs) as to how I should go about this.

     Either way, there'll be an election, and if I'm picked, so be it.
     If not, well... I have that target over there...  <laugh>  I'm
     figuring a month (just to be safe) before I'm ready to hold an
     election, since I want to be sure all the NCs of Region11 know first
     that I'm the Temp RC, and second that there will be an election.
     (To that end, I'm attempting to crash netmail to all listed R11 NCs
     as I write this.)

     I'll try to keep you updated as to how things are coming along, but
     please forgive me if I get busy and it slips my tiny little mind.
     :-)

     Cheers!

                                SOME THOUGHTS
                                    PART I

     Love is grand; divorce is a hundred grand.

     I am in shape.  Round is a shape.

     Time may be a great healer, but it's also a lousy beautician.

     Never be afraid to try something new.  Remember, amateurs built the
     ark.  Professionals built the Titanic.

     Conscience is what hurts when everything else feels so good.

     Talk is cheap because supply exceeds demand.

     Stupidity got us into this mess - why can't it get us out?

     Even if you are on the right track, you'll get run over if you just
     sit there.

     Politicians and diapers have one thing in common.  They should both
     be changed regularly and for the same reason.

     An optimist thinks that this is the best possible world.  A
     pessimist fears that this is true.

     There is always death and taxes; however, death doesn't get worse
     every year.

     People will accept your ideas much more readily if you tell them
     that Benjamin Franklin said it first.

     It's easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.

     I don't mind going nowhere as long as it's an interesting path.

     Anything free is worth what you pay for it.

     Indecision is the key to flexibility.

     It hurts to be on the cutting edge.

     If it isn't broke, fix it till it is.

     I don't get even, I get odder.

     In just two days, tomorrow will be yesterday.
     **This one's brilliant

     [Editor's Note:  It has come to my attention that these comebacks
     are sexist.  Unfortunately, it's hard to tell a joke without making
     fun of _something_.  So, in the interest of social correctness, the
     female sexist orientation of thes comebacks is balanced by the male
     sexist orientation of the chain letter which follows.  Hopefully,
     Fidonews has achieved a "Balance of Sexism" here]


     25 Snappy Comebacks To The Question ...
     "Why aren't you married yet?"

     1. You haven't asked yet.
     2. I was hoping to do something meaningful with my life.
     3. What? And spoil my great sex life?
     4. Nobody would believe me in white.
     5. Because I just love hearing this question.
     6. Just lucky, I guess.
     7. It gives my mother something to live for.
     8. My fiance is awaiting parole.
     9. I'm still hoping for a shot at Miss America.
     10. Do you know how hard it is to get two tickets to Miss Saigon?
     11. I'm waiting until I get to be your age.
     12. It didn't seem worth a blood test.
     13. I already have enough laundry to do, thank you.
     14. Because I think it would take all the spontaneity out of dating.
     15. My co-op board doesn't allow spouses.
     16. I'd have to forfeit my billion dollar trust fund.
     17. They just opened a great singles bar on my block.
     18. I wouldn't want my parents to drop dead from sheer happiness.
     19. I guess it just goes to prove that you can't trust those voodoo
          doll rituals.
     20. What? And lose all the money I've invested in running personal
          ads?
     21. We really want to, but my lover's husband just won't go for it.
     22. I don't want to have to support another person on my paycheck.
     23. Why aren't you thin?
     24. I'm married to my career, although recently we have been
          considering a trial separation.
     25. (Bonus reply ... for single moms) Because having a husband and a
          child would be redundant.

                       The Ultimate Man's Chain Letter
                               Thanks to Ol'WDB

     This chain letter was started in hopes of bringing relief to other
     tired and discouraged men. Unlike most chain letters, this one does
     not cost anything. Just send a copy of this letter to five of your
     FIDONEWS 17-26               Page 6                   26 Jun 2000


     friends who are equally tired and discontented. Then bundle up your
     wife or girlfriend and send her to the man whose name appears at the
     top of the list, and add your name to the bottom of the list.

     When your turn comes, you will receive 15,625 women. One of them is
     bound to be better than the one you already have.

     At the writing of this letter, a friend of mine had already received
     184 women, of whom  4 were worth keeping.

     REMEMBER this chain brings luck. One man's pit bull died, and the
     next day he received a Playboy swimsuit model.

     An unmarried Jewish man living with his widowed mother was able to
     choose between a Hooters waitress and a Hollywood supermodel.

     You can be lucky too, but DO NOT BREAK THE CHAIN! One man broke the
     chain, and got his own wife back again.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email

     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
