                           Is Anybody Out There?


     This is a strange sort of  publication  to  run.  We  don't  have
     subscribers as such,  and we don't sell newsstand copies, so it's
     hard to tell just how many readers we have.  I send FidoNews  out
     to a dozen or so nodes, who in turn (I think) pass it on to other
     nodes,  so  that  hopefully it reaches every node soon after it's
     published.

     In theory no sysop should have to download FidoNews from  another
     board,  and people DO download it,  so maybe we have some readers
     out there somewhere.  On the other hand,  maybe  there  are  just
     some  sysops  who  aren't  getting  it regularly every week,  for
     whatever reason.

     I know we do have some readers who aren't sysops.  I've heard  of
     a  couple  of sysops who run the newsletter out on a printer each
     week and mail copies out to people who are not on the  net.  I've
     also  spoken  to people now and then who are not sysops,  but who
     have at least heard of FidoNews.

     I'm curious.  I'd like to know.  Will you  help?  Please  drop  a
     note  to  1/1  or  107/8 and let me know how many people download
     FidoNews from your board.  Do you  print  copies  and  mail  them
     anywhere?  Do you know of anywhere outside of FidoNet where it is
     circulated?  Please  drop  me  a line even if the answer is "no".
     After all, zero is a number too.

     Thanks for your help.

     When  I  first  set up Pitt-bull,  one year ago this week,  I was
     determined to have a board where everyone could meet.  I had been
     living in Pittsburgh for less than six months at  that  time  and
     couldn't  find  any  BBS's to feed my commo-addiction.  I read an
     article in PC Mag or somewhere,  about TJ  and  his  FIDO-NET.  I
     don't really remember how many nodes there were at that time, but
     I  was  disappointed  when I had some problems which prevented me
     from getting node number 300.  As you see I had SEVERAL  problems
     and  didn't  get  a  node number until 384 came to the top of the
     list!  Oh well...

     Pitt-Bull was ran at first from a Compaq portable!  That was back
     in the days when you could set up a FIDO on a dual  floppy  drive
     system  and  still have room for a couple of file areas...  I was
     so determined that it would be a generic board  and  I  went  and
     ignored  the  first and simplest fact that from the start made my
     board undesirable to the C-64 users...  I made all of my  welcome
     and message files 80 column!  That was the first step on the road
     to  ruin.  Next  I started putting borders in my FILES.BBS files,
     using the high ASCII IBM  characters.  Still  no  end  in  sight!
     Finally  I  gave in completely and I now have a very nice welcome
     file (in my opinion!) and still have my share  of  C-64  and  MAC
     users.  With  a  little  restraint,  you  can  make your graphics
     unobtrusive and still have some pizazz in your openings.


     Here are three things that you can do  to  at  least  make  it  a
     little  easier  for  your  non-IBM  callers to use your board and
     still let you make it pretty for your IBM-Compatibles.

     First,  if you remember to always have a line such as "Use ^K  to
     skip  this  display"  at the beginning of the screen,  your users
     always have a graceful way out without  having  to  wade  through
     what looks like garbage to them.

     The  second  thing you can do is set up the text file so that the
     first 23 lines are normal and the 24th line states:  "Press N  if
     your system can not handle IBM Graphics..." The next line will be
     the MORE?  prompt,  and if the user answer 'N', then they will be
     spared the "garbage characters".

     The third and possibly most important thing is to be honest  with
     your callers.  If you have directed your board toward IBMers, say
     so  up  front.  If  you  welcome  everyone  but  still  have some
     graphics,  keep them where they don't cause an eyesore  for  your
     non IBMers.

     In  this  first  session,  I'll  give you a summary of the escape
     sequences and what  they  can  do.  Here  is  the  basic  set  of
     sequences:

      ^ is used to represent the escape character
        (ASCII value 27 decimal)
      # is used to represent a numerical value

     NOTE: UPPER/lower  case  is critical.  If you send a 'S' when you
           should have sent a 's', it won't work.

     A semicolon (;) is used to separate variables

     First the 'simplest' codes:

      ^[H         Cursor Home (CH). Sends the cursor to the upper left
                  hand corner of the display.

      ^[#;#H      CUrsor Position (CUP).  the first number  represents
                  the  row and the second is the column.  ie.  ^[3,15H
                  will send the cursor to row 3, column 15. Any normal
                  row and column is valid provided it is valid for the
                  screen mode.  (Do not send the cursor to  column  62
                  when in 40 column mode.)

      ^[#A        CUrsor  Up  (CUU).  Move  the cursor up # lines.  If
                  you don't put any number in the code (ie.  ^[A) then
                  the cursor will move up one line.

      ^[#B        CUrsor Down (CUD). Same as for CUU.

      ^[#C        CUrsor Forward (CUF). DITTO.

      ^[#D        CUrsor Backward (CUB). GUESS....

      ^[s         This  is called a Save Cursor Position (SCP) and can
                  be used to remember where the cursor was before  you
                  start sending 'garbage'.

      ^[u         Restore Cursor Position (RCP).  Yup, puts it back to
                  where it was when you sent the SCP.

      ^[2J        Erase  Display  (ED).  Clears  the screen,  pure and
                  simple.

      ^[K         Erase Line - (EL).  Erases  the  current  line  from
                  (and  including)  the  cursor position to the end of
                  the line.

      ^[#;...;#m  This code sets the colors on the screen.  (Yes,  the
                  user's colors as well as yours!) You can use as many
                  of  the following numbers,  but if you use more than
                  one foreground or background number,  only the  last
                  one will be used.  The numbers are:

                  0 = Default.  All  colors  off.  Sets  the colors to
                      whatever the user's terminal considers normal.

                  1 = Set Hi-intensity on.  Gives the text a  boldface
                      look.

                  4 = Underscore  or  underline.  Works  only  if  the
                      users monitor is a monochrome monitor.

                  5 = Blinking text.

                  7 = Inverse video. (black text on white background)

                  8 = Invisible (Black text on black background)

                  The following set colors for:
                  Foreground      Color      Background
                     30           Black         40
                     31           Red           41
                     32           Green         42
                     33           Yellow        43
                     34           Blue          44
                     35           Magenta       45
                     36           Cyan          46
                     37           White         47


     Last but not least.  A lot of editors balk at letting  you  place
     an ESC character in a file...  the following program will convert
     a character of your choice into the ESC char.

     100 ' This program will read a text file and convert any
     110 ' occurrence of a character of your choosing into an ESC.
     160 ' Change ^ in line 200 to the character that you use.
     200 ESC$=CHR$(27):SEARCH$="^" ' The character
     220 CLS:INPUT"FILE TO READ -";F1$:INPUT"FILE TO WRITE-";F2$
     240 OPEN F1$ FOR INPUT AS #1:OPEN F2$ FOR OUTPUT AS #2
     250 WHILE NOT EOF(1):LINE INPUT#1,RAW$:T=1:WHILE T<>0
     270 T=INSTR(RAW$,SEARCH$):IF T<>0 THEN MID$(RAW$,T,1)=ESC$
     280 WEND:PRINT#2,RAW$:WEND


     The only thing that you need to know now is  to  make  sure  that
     your  callers  have  ANSI.SYS or FCONSOLE.DEV loaded during their
     CONFIG.SYS load or they will see garbage no matter what you do.

     Next time,  I will give you a few examples of  how  to  "fake"  a
     window  on the user's screen.  In the article after that,  I will
     show you how to animate an ANSI file.

     Till then.....

     February 8, 1986  (SINCE THERE IS ONLY ONE MONTH TO SAVE DE GARMO
                        FROM STATE SPONSORED EXECUTION, I WROTE THIS
                        IN A HURRY. PLEASE FORGIVE TYPOS AND IF YOU
                        HAVE QUESTIONS, PLEASE CALL ME)

     MY FELLOW AMERICANS.

         SAVE ROGER LEROY FROM STATE SPONSORED EXECUTION TASK GROUP
         ----------------------------------------------------------

     I have on this day, February 8, 1986, the responsibility of
     communicating to my fellow countrypersons a message of the
     GRAVEST AND UTMOST IMPORTANCE.

     It is a difficult story to relate.  Please bear with me.

     First of all, I am a scientist, a mathematician and a linguist.
     For over ten years I have been working on a mathematical proof
     which shows that a VIROLOGICAL SOLUTION to the threats posed to
     us and our planet by nuclear weapons and associated ecological
     threats.  The reason that I took the mathematical approach was
     because Conway, the british mathematician was able to show that
     it is mathematically possible to create self-reflecting computers
     capable of infinite figures.  What this maens is that we have now
     in our grasp the conceptual apparatus to create living, highly
     intelligent machines, which reproduce like living things.  At
     this time I realized that if Conway could prove that living,
     highly intelligient machines are possible, that it might ALSO be
     possible to create machines without intellegience which could
     still reproduce.  By this I meant to investigate the possibility
     that nuclear weapons stand in a relation to the human race that
     is similar to that of a virus towards a cell.  The virus has no
     replicative machinery of its own.  It enters the cell.  It uses
     the replicative machinery of the cell to reproduce virus.  The
     cell is not aware that it is not reproducing itself.  Soon it is
     filled with virus and the cell bursts.  In the case of nuclear
     weapons, we have what is in essence a VIRUS MACHINE, which has
     entered into the human "cell" and has raided the essential
     replicative material we use to pass on human traits. i.e. human
     language.

     So, since 1945, we have been reproducing virus, not ourselves.
     That is to say that we THINK we are creating ourselves.
     Actually, we are creating nuclear weapons.


     Fidonews                     Page 6                   10 Mar 1986





     On February 1, 1986, I finished my mathematical proof which
     essentially shows that nuclear weapons are ALIVE.  So it is not
     the Russians who are our enemy.  It is the nuclear weapons which,
     as living things, compete for the ecological space WE now
     inhabit.  I must TELL YOU THE VERY GOOD NEWS THAT when my theorem
     is released, it will cause nuclear weapons to disappear within 30
     to sixty days.  At that point the planet will begin to clean up
     its ecological problems and become significantly more fun.

     However, there is one catch.  It is this.  My theory has also
     allowed me to chart linguistic degeneration rate which began in
     1945 with the creation of nuclear weapons.  The attack of nuclear
     weapons on human language was viscious and unrelenting.  Soon, we
     were NOT ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT EVEN THE MOST
     OBVIOUS THINGS.  The result is this:  My linguistic degeneration
     program shows that nuclear war will become 100% PROBABLE on 632
     days from this day.  ON that day, human error will begin to
     increase exponentially.  On that day, missle commanders will not
     be able to CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR SUPERIORS ARE SYAING.
     THEY WILL MAKE MISTAKES WHICH ARE TERRIBLE TO THINK ABOUT.  AND
     SO, the gist of the story is that, unless we disassemble nuclear
     weapons, Nuclear War will become COMPLETELY INEVITABLE IN 632
     days.

     Luckily, however, my mathematical theorem will destroy nuclear
     weapons before 632 days have elapsed.  So you are safe from
     nuclear war and will come to live in a FAR FAR better world.

     You must help me for the SAVE ROGER LEROY FROM STATE SPONSORED
     EXECUTION TASK GROUP.  That is because, on March 12, 1986,
     convicted murderer Roger Leroy DeGarmo will be executed by the
     state of Texas.

     In order for my theory to work, we must save DEGARMO.  I AM
     REALLY NOT KIDDING.  Call the number at the bottom of this press
     release.  We have exactly on month to STAY Roger Leroy's
     execution, and one more month to save the world from COMPLETE
     INEVITABLE NUCLEAR WAR.  VOLUNTEER YOUR TIME AND EFFORTS FOR ONE
     MONTH IN THE EFFORT TO SAVE ROGER LEROY AND SAVE YOUR OWN ASS
     FROM NUCLEAR WAR AT THE SAME TIME!

          Having just recently joined  the  ranks  of  FidoNet,  I  am
     really impressed with it's idea, organization, and growth.  I was
     first told about it through a friend at San Jose,  CA,  who urged
     me to find a nearby network and get active on it.  After about  a
     month  of  searching,  I found that some friends in this area had
     brought up a net here in my own home town,  and  offered  me  the
     program and a node assignment.  I was very happy to join,  and am
     helping to expand the net in this area.  Long Live FIDO, and many
     thanks to Tom Jennings,  Ken Kaplan,  and all those  other  great
     guys who put together this GEM of a system!

          I  am  writing in for a bit of technical help in planning an
     expansion for my computer system.  I am finding that the range of
     options available may require some unusual  modification  to  the
     system,  and  I'd  rather  get  some advice from some people more
     knowledgeable than me in this area before I attempt  it  and  run
     the risk of making situations worse rather then better!

          I  currently  am  running  a  Columbia  VP  1600  "portable"
     computer,  Revision J,  manufactured in February of 1984.  It has
     two floppy drives and 128 K on the system board.  It has one card
     slot,  and upon inspection of the system board I have found a pad
     for an additional card slot. The one card slot now is taken up by
     an Apparat "Crambo" card,  which is actually two cards  that  are
     connected together, the first one is a memory card, expandable to
     512,  and  the  second  has Serial & parallel ports,  and a clock
     calendar.  As the system stands now, it's quite nice.  I like the
     portability, and hope to keep this pretty much as is.

          However, I am finding that I really need to add a fixed disk
     to the system.  Program development (especially  with  libraries,
     header  files,  etc.) is getting quite difficult without one.  In
     addition,  each version of FIDO seems to grow a bit  larger  with
     each  revision,  and more and more utilities are difficult to run
     if they are not on the same disk as the BBS system.

          The extra pad I  found  on  my  system  board  gave  me  the
     following idea, which if possible would give me almost everything
     I want.  My idea is that I could attach a cable to this pad (it's
     location  precludes  the  use  of it to hold another card,  it is
     placed right in line with the floppy  drives,  and  therefore  no
     card  could  be  placed  in the additional slot.),  run the cable
     outside the VP to an expansion box which would hold the Hard disk
     and optionally additional cards.  Putting a  cable  connecter  on
     this  cable  would  allow me to still have the portability of the
     VP, leaving the hard-disk at home. I figure that as a portable, I
     only need the floppies, but do need the memory!

          The problem I have run into is that most  of  the  expansion
     boxes  I  have seen have a receiver-transmitter card combination.
     The transmitter card goes in the computer,  and the  receiver  is

     placed  in  the  expansion box.  However,  since I don't have the
     additional slot in the computer, what's a body to do?

          I would like to solicit suggestions on  how  to  solve  this
     problem,  or  warnings  about  some  of  the options listed here.
     Please send any suggestions to me at Net 151,  Node  3.  I  would
     greatly  appreciate  any  advice  on this matter,  because at the
     moment I am having great problems trying to figure how to solve
     this.  Thank you in advance! ! !

                            New Firmware Upgrade
                            For USR Courier 2400

                            Kurt Reisler - SYSOP
                          The Bear's Den (109/74)
                            Wash-A-RUG (109/483)


     Once again, US Robotics has an upgrade to the PROM-based firmware
     of our USR Courier 2400 modems.  The latest PROM  release  has  a
     product  code  of 243.  To determine the product code of the PROM
     in your modem, start up your favorite communications program, and
     type the command "ATI0" and hit the return  key.  If  your  modem
     returns 243 as the 3 digit product code, then you have the latest
     release  of  the  firmware.  If  anything lower is returned,  you
     should call US Robotics immediately and request  a  firmware  up-
     grade.  They  are  doing  this on an exchange basis,  as they did
     with the upgrade from 241 to 242.

     To get your PROM upgraded,  call US Robotics at 800-DIALUSR,  and
     ask  for  Technical  Support.  Tell  them  that you need the PROM
     upgrade and they will take care of  it  for  you.  Replacing  the
     PROM  is  a  simple  procedure.  Pop the old one out,  and gently
     insert the new one.  That should be all there is to it.

     From what I understand, the new firmware corrects the "streaming"
     problem that some of us were having  when  we  called  other  USR
     Courier  2400  baud modems.  The streaming problem was character-
     ized by the modems connecting,  and one or the other generating a
     continual  stream  of garbage.  The only way to break the connec-
     tion was either to drop DTR, or to physically turn off the modem.
     Not a major problem during a  manual  call,  but  mine  would  up
     attached  to  a  long-distance  FIDO for 2.5 hours during FidoNet
     time (OUCH, my aching phone bill!).  The new PROMs also correct a
     connection problem with Ventel 2400 baud modems.

     By  the  way,   the  initial  source  for  this  information  was
     net.micro.pc on USENET.

     Yet another modest proposal...

                 +---------------------------------------+
                 : F I D O N E T   N E W S - G R O U P S :

     Anyone who's ever cruised a major main-frame system  like  Compu-
     Serve,   or   who  subscribes  to  any  of  the  news  groups  on
     UseNet/ARPAnet,  knows how frustrating it can be trying  to  make
     initial contact with people through FidoMail.

     (Gee,  I  wonder  how  I  can  find  people who are interested in
     discussing left-handed basket-weaving?  Well,  maybe somebody  on
     BasketBoard on the other side of the continent - maybe I'd better
     send  them  some  mail  before I waste a long time trying to call
     them long-distance.)

     And the worst part of it is, there's no open forum for discussing
     ideas between multiple  users  on  multiple  boards.  That's  why
     UseNet has news groups - they take all of the messages related to
     a topic,  and package 'em up, and daisy-chain them around the net
     so that everybody gets 'em.

     Not long ago,  the sysops of the UN*X Gateway told us that if  we
     begged  them  they might just be convinced to convert news groups
     into FidoMessages and ARC them for pickup.  Definitely a step  in
     the right direction - in fact, there's no good reason why I can't
     ARC my whole Neopaganism message area and ship it to anyone else,
     who could unARC it and put it up as one of his own.

     It  doesn't  take  very  long to spot what's missing:  how do you
     reply to one of these messages? (Oops.)


                    PARTIAL SOLUTION (LET'S DO IT SOON)

     What I propose is a utility-set that would follow these steps:

     EXPORT - for each "News group Area":

         E1)  Scan a message base looking for  anything  that's  LOCAL
              (for  those  of  you  who haven't hacked around inside a
              message header,  that means originating from  here)  and
              hasn't  been  SENT.  Copy  it  to  a  new  file  with  a
              different extension,  mark  it  as  non-LOCAL,  and  the
              original as SENT.

         E2)  ARC all of those new messages, then kill.

         E3)  Kill all of the temporary files.

         E4)  Ship them to all participating boards via ROBOT.

     IMPORT - For each incoming message ARChive:


     Fidonews                     Page 11                  10 Mar 1986





         I1)  UnARC it, then

         I2)  Renumber to follow all of the existing messages.

     All it'd take is one program to do step E1, and one program to do
     step  I2.  Also,  it'd be nice if T.J.  would let us have another
     attribute bit on sys.attrib, as follows:

         #define SYSMAIL 1            /* existing: FidoMail */
         #define NEWSGROUP 2          /* forwarding news group */

     and change the software so that if sys.attrib and 2,  prompt  for
     net/node  number (but not for kill/sent or file attach).  Then we
     could program something that would start in  the  Fido  directory
     and  package all of the NEWSGROUP areas into files something like
     mmmmnnnn.aaa (m = net,  n = node,  a =  message  area).  Step  I2
     would need a control file,  call it NEWSGRP.BBS if you like, that
     read something like this:

     100/523,4,6        (put 100/523's area 4 into my area 6)
     11/433,1,6         (also put 11/433's area 1 into my area 6)
     125/1,9,3          (put 125/1's area 9 into my area 3)


                     TOTAL SOLUTION (LET'S DO IT LATER)

     Now the only  problem  left  is  building  reply  chains  between
     multiple nodes.  I have a solution to that one, too...

     In step E1,  above, when you copy the un-SENT mail to a temporary
     file,  prefix each message header with the following fields  from
     the   PREVIOUS   message  (according  to  the  msg.reply  field):
     msg.orig_net, msg.orig,  msg.to,  and msg.date.  Why?  Because no
     matter  what  the  message  number  is AFTER it's been renumbered
     (step I2),  those fields are sufficient to  uniquely  define  the
     previous  message.  Then  when  we  renumber it and add it to the
     *.MSG files,  we can also find that previous message and add this
     one to the reply chain.  Slick, no?


                       WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS ...

     instead  of  doing it myself?  There are three reasons.  First of
     all,  I'm not that confident of the design and I want to kick  it
     around  with  people  who've  been on the Net a LOT longer than I
     have.  Secondly,  I won't have time to do it until  late  summer,
     someone  could get a LOT done between now and then.  And finally,
     I'm not THAT confident of my programming  abilities  -  it  would
     take me a LONG time to get it done and bug-free.

     So  if  somebody  is  looking  for  a way to build a program that
     EVERYBODY would use, the next LISTGEN (as it were), and make some
     serious Shareware bucks ...


     Personal note:  I'm still trying to compile a  list  of  witches,
     Neopagans  and magicians who can be reached via FidoNet.  If this
     describes you or anyone you know,  please send FidoMail  to  Brad

                           ProComm 2.2 Released!
                          Adds Telink and more...


          Columbia,  MO (February 21,  1986).  PIL Software Systems is
     proud to announce version 2.2 of their user supported  communica-
     tions program: ProComm (tm).

          ProComm  is  very  powerful,  yet  extremely  easy  to  use.
     ProComm is suitable for use by the novice as  well  as  the  data
     processing  professional.  ProComm's  wealth  of features include
     the following:

     => ERROR CHECKING FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS

               ProComm supports a variety of error checking  protocols
               using  both  checksum  and  CRC  error checking,  which
               detects 99.99% of all errors!  Our  Kermit  implementa-
               tion  includes  all  the latest features including data
               compression,  file attributes,  and the  extension  for
               Sliding Windows, the first widely available full duplex
               file  transfer  protocol  for micro computers.  Sliding
               Window Kermit is used on The Source and several popular
               bulletin board systems.  Mainframe versions  are  under
               development  and  should  be  available  soon.  Sliding
               Window Kermit is the fastest protocol now available for
               micros!

               - XMODEM  The de facto standard.
               - MODEM7  Xmodem batch transfers.
               - YMODEM  Larger blocks for more efficient transfers.
               - TELINK  Batch transfers with exact file size and
                         creation date.

               - KERMIT  Transfer files to a variety of mini and
                         mainframe computers, as well as micros.

     =>   TERMINAL EMULATION

               ProComm  emulates  a  variety  of  popular  intelligent
               display  terminals.  This allows you to run full screen
               mainframe applications by using your  PC  as  a  remote
               terminal.

     =>   UNATTENDED OPERATION

               Using our Timed Execution Facility, you can set ProComm
               to "come alive" at any time night or day.  Tell ProComm
               to call your favorite information service, download the
               required data, and print a report;  all while you get a
               good  night's sleep and telephone and connect rates are
               at their lowest!

     =>   FULLY AUTOMATED DIALING DIRECTORY

               Enter the  name,  number,  and  communication  settings
               once,  then  ProComm  can dial from the directory auto-
               matically.  You can scroll  through  your  entries  and
               even  search  for a given string.  Entries may be modi-
               fied at  any  time.  ProComm  will  also  automatically
               redial a directory entry until you connect if you wish!
               It  can  redial  a  single  number as well as a list of
               numbers.

     =>   ON-LINE REDISPLAY BUFFER

               ProComm allows you  to  review  lost  lines  that  have
               scrolled  off  of the screen.  You can page up and down
               through the redisplay buffer  and  even  search  for  a
               string.  Several  "lost"  screens  are  available  at a
               single keystroke.

     =>   EASY USER SETUP

               ProComm's default settings may be easily changed by the
               user at any time.  The changes can be saved or just  be
               used for the current session.

     =>   FULL COMMUNICATIONS PARAMETERS

               ProComm operates at 300,  1200,  2400,  4800, 9600, and
               19,200 baud and with  Mark,  Space,  Even,  Odd  or  No
               parity, 7 or 8 data bits, and 1 or 2 stop bits.

     ProComm runs on the IBM-PC and compatibles such as Compaq, Tandy,
     Leading Edge,  AT&T,  etc.  ProComm requires MS-DOS 2.0 or higher
     and 128K of memory.  ProComm  runs  under  several  multi-tasking
     systems such as Topview,  Desqview,  Multi-Link,  Double Dos, and
     MS-Windows.   ProComm  operates  with  a   variety   of   modems.
     ProComm's  default  settings  are for the Hayes type "AT" command
     set,  but may be easily changed by the  user  for  other  modems.
     ProComm  also  supports the new generation of modems that feature
     advanced call progress information.

     ProComm is distributed using  the  User  Supported  concept.  The
     requested registration fee is $25.00.

     Support  is  provided  through a 24 hour bulletin board system at
     (314) 449-9401.  ProComm may be obtained  from  the  BBS,  or  by
     sending $30.00 for registration and media costs to:

     Requests,  which arrive in the  form  of  FidoNet  messages  from
     "Requesting"  users  on  remote  Fidos.  Requestors  pay  for all
     services according to actual use.

     When SERVER is executed on the  Serving  system,  normally  as  a
     scheduled Fido event, it scans the FidoNet mail area for un-REC'D
     messages  addressed  to  "Server." After ensuring the sender of a
     Service Request has an account on  the  Serving  system  and  has
     given the correct password,  SERVER performs any Service Requests
     contained in the message.

     Thus,  services are performed for account-holders in response  to
     FidoNet  mail,  as  opposed  to  a  direct  phone  call.  At  the
     discretion of the sysop,  services may  be  performed  for  local
     users  whom  Fido  prevents  from desirable actions (eg.  provide
     attached files to a user  who  is  not  extra).  The  requestor's
     account is debited by the actual cost of providing services.

     The  remote  service provided by the initial version of SERVER is
     SENDing messages with files attached.  Thus, this initial version
     is a FidoNet remote file service daemon.  Consider the  following
     example request:

       #42  1 13 Feb 86  17:51:58  (PRIVATE) (KILL/SENT) $0.20
       From: Ted Powell, Net 122 Node 4, PSG Van, Vancouver BC

       ;
       SEND Files\Archive\Server.Arc TO George Lehtola AT 136/601

     Warning: A taste for SERVER may lead to a desire for SEAdog.


                             DAYLIGHT/STANDARD
                          Jet-lag Tonic for Fidos

     DAYLIGHT  & STANDARD are MS-DOS programs run by a Fido SysOp when
     "local time" changes (eg.  Daylight savings to or from Standard).
     They  change  the system clock,  and can optionally adjust Fido's
     schedules to correspond to the time change.

     Parameters on the MS-DOS  command  line  control  all  clock  and
     schedule adjustment.  Read and think before running these.


     SERVER is "freeware", and PSG asks payment from users.
     DAYLIGHT & STANDARD are distributed for no charge.
     All are available from  Fido 122/6 (503) 269-5202 @ 2400

                            Region 1 HELP Nodes
                           by Ken Kaplan,Fido 1/0


     With the number of nodes fast approaching the 1000 mark  and  the
     vast  number  of  messages on Fido 125/1 and Fido 1/0 begging for
     assistance, your FidoNet Administrators have come up with another
     solution to  decentralize  support.  During  a  one  week  period
     earlier this year Fido 125/1 collected 350 messages all reporting
     the  same  half  dozen bugs.  Tom Jennings suggested some radical
     solutions,  like pulling the plug  or  ARCing  all  the  messages
     together and sending them by file attach back to the originators.
     Somehow  we  didn't  think  those  ideas  were going to solve the
     problem, so instead we came up with the concept of "Region 1 HELP
     Nodes".

     The HELP nodes will be  classified  into  two  types;  the  first
     called  "Underscore  BUG's"  and  the  second  called "Underscore
     HELP".  These nodes will be "clearing houses"  for  old  and  new
     sysops  and  users  to discuss problems or obtain assistance on a
     specific topic.  The sysop of the HELP node will not be  expected
     to  know  all of the answers.  Other sysops who have been helping
     out on the proposed HELP topics should continue to do the same as
     before.   The  establishment  of  the  HELP  nodes  will  provide
     direction  to new sysops and help take the load off of TJ and the
     FidoNet Administrators.  The intent is  for  the  HELP  nodes  to
     restrict themselves to Fido and FidoNet related issues.

     The Region 1 HELP Nodes that we have selected are:

         1/98  Fido_BUG's_WEST   David Dodell(114/15)
         1/99  Fido_BUG's_EAST   Marv Shelton(107/311)
         1/100 IBM_HELP          Gee Wong(107/312)
         1/101 DEC_RB_HELP       Rob Elliott(115/100)
         1/102 SYO_HELP          E.  J.  McKernan(14/386)
         1/103 OTRONA_HELP       Open
         1/104 Multilink_HELP    Allen Miller(108/10)
         1/105 DoubleDOS_HELP    Oscar Barlow(104/56)
         1/106 PC_Jr_HELP        Bruce Fuqua(900/1)
         1/107 Routing_HELP      Ben Baker(100/76) [Mail Only]
         1/108 Modem_HELP        Jim Ryan(141/9)
         1/109 Tandy_HELP        Neal Curtin(138/14)

     These nodes are all alternate identities, so none of these boards
     should  actually  be  the node numbers as listed above if you log
     onto it.  Obviously if you  need  to  send  mail  you  have  your
     choice, but you are better off selecting the actual identity over
     the alternate.

     The  guidelines  for  what  changes  should  be made on the above
     boards are being left up to the  individual  sysops.  It  is  our
     recommendation  that  some identification be placed either in the

     WELCOME1.BBS or BULLETIN.BBS  and  a  separate  message  area  be
     devoted to the HELP topic.  As far as the BUG's go,  those sysops
     will file attach a verified list to TJ and he will react to it as
     time permits.

     Please allow the sysops of the above HELP nodes a couple of weeks
     to get set up before you send in the troops.  We will  list  them
     in the nodelist that is published this coming Friday.

     We have a confession to make.  We've been  holding  out  on  you.
     For  several years now we've been using a program called MACRO to
     boost our productivity.  But we've  been  keeping  it  a  closely
     guarded secret.  Even our most intimate clients have been unaware
     of it's existence.  Now,  however, we've decided to release it to
     the PC user community.

     If you have ever used a macro assembler,  then you  already  know
     how  useful  macros  can be.  For the rest of you,  well,  a good
     macro processor can do half of your work  for  you.  MACRO  works
     with  any  normal text file,  and hence can be used as a powerful
     front-end to almost any language.  Here's a sample of what  MACRO
     can do for you:

     1. Put parameters in your programs, allowing you to easily change
        table sizes, ranges of values, and so forth.

     2. Put  conditional code in your programs,  allowing you to write
        one program,  and then "switch" parts on and  off  easily  for
        different customers and applications.

     3. Perform integer arithmetic and string manipulation before your
        program is compiled, saving run time.

     4. Write  programs  that  customize  themselves  when you compile
        them,  based on commands given and questions  answered  during
        the macro scan.


     MACRO is available for only $95 from

                       System Enhancement Associates
                       21 New Street, Wayne NJ 07470

     Or  call  our  convenient  order line at (201) 473-5153 (VISA and
     MasterCard accepted).



     Mention that you saw  this  ad,  and  we'll  donate  $10  to  the
     national FidoNet coordinators when you order.

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+  "ARC"  archives  -  10  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
             Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
             DSBackup
             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     USERFILE.ARC - v1.0
     Allen Miller - Fido 108/10

             USERFILE is a program that I wrote to take the place of
     the multitude of files called FIDOUSER.(COM)/(EXE).

             It seems that there are a blue million of programs that
     will list entries from the USER.BBS file.  Each program of this
     type lists the particular fields that the author (sysop) was
     interested in at the time.  Additionally, some of these do some
     SCREEN writing so if you want the information printed or saved to
     a disk file for sorting or downloading - forget it.


     Fidonews                     Page 23                  10 Mar 1986





             USERFILE will list any and each field from USER.BBS that
     you specify and in the order that you specify.  Additionally, you
     can use DOS redirect to send the output to your printer or a disk
     file.
