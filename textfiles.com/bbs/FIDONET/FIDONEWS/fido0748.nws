     The U.S. Constitution does not grant us rights. "Our" government
     does not grant us rights. They have nothing to give us, other
     than ostensibly services which it provides from our taxes. (I'll
     leave that one alone here.)

     The Constitution simply admits that, as humans, we have certain
     rights, and that the government recognizes this, and promises not
     to take them away. THAT was the revolutionary idea behind this
     government.

     This is an incredibly important difference, and one which our
     gov't doesn't like to emphasize. They want it to appear that they
     are the defenders of all that is good, when in reality they are
     one of the worst offenders.

                             * * * * *

     Tim Pozar & I just got back from the Hackers Conference 6.0. (The
     Hackers' Conferences are an invite-only social event for the
     creative weirdos who make up at least part of the forces behind
     the (mostly) software frontier. When they were started in '84,
     the micro software industry was still somewhat laughable in
     large-industry terms (though given a lot of credibility (sic) by
     the IBM PC a few years before), and "hacker" usually meant more
     or less what "ham" did in amateur radio.

     I've been to four of them so far, 1, 2, 4 and 6. The first two
     were great, the 4th not so, in my peculiar opinion. It was too
     ... isolated. The whole trickle-down thing revisited. Like this
     -- "We're making the tools that will benefit the world" and all
     that rot, and if it only cost $500, everyone could buy one.
     (Forgetting that they themselves are 1% of 1% and $500 is an
     unthinkable figure for *most* US citizens -- and growing.)

     But this year was different.

                             * * * * *

     The unix-based usenet network has many corporations that pay for
     telecomm costs, unlike us bums who pay for it ourselves, or on
     the sly where possible. Until a year or so ago, FidoNet was not
     considered a "real" network, whatever that is. Part of it was
     simple snootiness, but a big part was simply that we sprung up
     from a place no one was expecting, and even when the wilder of
     the "traditional network" bunch looked in the right direction,
     FidoNews 7-48                Page 2                   26 Nov 1990


     they weren't sure of exactly what it was they were seeing ... you
     have to admit we are a curious bunch.

     People don't just "build" networks. They are expensive, take all
     that expensive minicomputer hardware, and who takes care of all
     those user accounts? What user accounts?! Where's your VAX? Hey
     wait a minute ...

                             * * * * *

     Some INTERNET nodes specialize in FTP'able (filereqestable)
     files; utilities, documents, that sort of thing, just like
     FidoNet nodes do. One specialized in .GIF picture files,
     including some of variously erotic content. The (gov't) sponsors
     of the net (in keeping with the current censorious trend) ordered
     the stuff "off". The Finnish offered to take the files, where
     they quickly became 70% of the traffic ... and indication of
     their U.S. popularity.

     Then the feds (I forget the branch) told the Fins: if you
     continue to provide those files to the U.S., we will cut all of
     your network connections. The Fins had no choice; survival comes
     first.

                             * * * * *

     The Hackers Conference was in a ski-lodge in Tahoe City, starting
     Friday afternoon, ending Sunday afternoon. Sleep optional. Dinner
     served at midnight. (Us vegetarian types had to sludge through
     greasy sauce-laden meat and such. Where "mint tea" is some grim
     lipton-clone where I swear they simply held a mint-leaf over the
     mixing vat ...)

     After the usual preliminaries (beer, M&M's, 10,000 "hello"s,
     finding rooms, etc) the fun begins -- a 48 hr long bullshit
     session, interrupted with food, sleep and occasional
     not-well-organized "sessions".

     In one of the bigger sessions, someone asked "how many people had
     been interviewed recently by the FBI?" Fully 1/4th raised their
     hands.

                             * * * * *

     The FidoNet is nothing if not contradictions -- independent,
     unpredictable, paranoid, decentralist, self-sufficient, flexible,
     reactionary, technically sophisticated ... Some wonder how we get
     anything done. I wonder how anyone ELSE gets things done!

     What appears to be a liability to the "rest of the world", our
     "lack of organization", lack of resources (90's code word for
     money) may be our long-term survival and later cause for
     rejoicing.

     Corporate "resources" don't come without strings, as the usenet
     may be about to find out. This past weekend, that bastion of
     liberalism (well, liberal capitalism; well, capitalism) Apple
     Computer just pulled the plug on the alt.sex.* newsgroups. (Their
     equiv. of echo conferences; ".*" means just what you DOS users
     might guess; it's a lot of conferences!) (Apple was a very big
     "backbone" distribution node.) Why? "Too controversial" or some
     such. I'm sure it's a "good reason". And of course they can do
     it, just like that. It is not unthinkable it will start a "run"
     on plug-pulling.

     Before we get too snooty ourselves, we have to keep in mind that
     we are just as vulnerable, maybe more so -- we don't have the
     resources to defend ourselves, nor the connections (yet) to the
     network community (though thanks to Tim Pozar we have ufgate
     (usenet/fidonet gateway) and INTERNET status). WE NEED THOSE TO
     SURVIVE. And we can do it while maintaining our utter and
     complete independence. And, the INTERNET will learn from us.

                             * * * * *

     To a few people, the high number of (ahem) interviewees was not a
     surprise. Mitch Kapor and John Barlow both had funny (if it was
     fiction) and foreboding (because of the feds power and ignorance)
     "interviews". The story is quite interesting, and was available
     on The Well and in print. To make a long story short, they have
     formed the EFF -- Electronic Frontier Foundation -- to defend
     First, (protected speech) and Fourth, (unreasonable
     search/seizure) Constitutional Amendments, as well to monitor
     ECPA (Electronic Communications Privacy Act) and other
     violations, and to work with legislators to work out fair laws.

     What was most heartening to me, was the approach -- instead of
     defending only the "nice, upstanding", positive-image type cases,
     they went for the real issues -- the kids and families getting
     busted at gun point by the feds, where literally every piece of
     electronics removed from the house, no recourse, no reason, no
     charges filed. The Niedorfer case, where the claimed $70K "stolen
     file" is found to be a brochure available to anyone for under
     $14. (And the press still calls it "stolen 911 software".) Steve
     Jackson Games; computers seized because an employee allegedly had
     on his home BBS a copy of the E911 doc (they were confused as to
     the location of the BBS; they later claimed that S.J's cyberpunk
     games (role playing like Dungeons & Dragons) were actually
     instructions on how to break into real-life computers!)

     In another case, the FBI thought that (1) John Draper (aka Cap'n
     Crunch) was CEO of AutoDesk and (2) AutoDesk was involved in Star
     Wars research, because they worked with something called
     "hyperspace". Yup -- it's hilarious, only they have guns,
     secrecy, bureaucracy and the power to evade legal process and
     accountability. And, you get hung in the press because their
     version of "reality" is so ... heavy.

     It is so rare to find someone who acts "from the heart" in their
     life, politics and actions, willing to put reputations at stake
     and correctly defend the "undefendable" first, not last. I have
     nothing but good things to say about EFF and it's supporters.

                             * * * * *

     This years FidoCon should be the best one yet. I'm actually
     looking forward to going, a rare event. (I'll drive out in my
     propane-powered '63 Rambler.) John Barlow, now of EFF fame, will
     be speaking. And you ought to listen -- not only is he an
     interesting speaker (and lyricist for the Grateful Dead!), the
     subject is Your Personal Future -- our governments actions
     against all too ordinary citizens, and what the EFF is doing, and
     what you can do as well.

     We all went through some internal hell these last few years, of
     which the growth and death of IFNA was merely a symptom. Look --
     the FidoNet doubled in size every few months for years, and is
     still growing at a rate that is completely, bar-none,
     unprecedented. How many of you have broad-based communications
     skills or experience? How many of you had telecomm. and/or
     conferencing experience before FidoNet? Simple experiences of
     speaking in a large group of diverse people? And I mean as in
     communications with humans, not hacking. Very few of us, I'm
     afraid, and while it's been a serious problem, it (1) affords us
     a fresh perspective and (2) simply something we have to deal
     with. The fun is in the learning.

     I think we are heading for the fourth phase of FidoNet growth
     (innocent start, echomail, paranoid self-consciousness, ...). The
     timing is good -- we have some real work cut out for us.

                             * * * * *

     So this year's Hackers Conference was different. How? Finally
     they reached my level of paranoia. There was an edge of stark
     reality in the air. A bit more tied to the planet.

     Personally, it completed a circle. Now, every single thing I'm
     involved in is officially disliked and under investigation and
     infiltration by police of one sort or another. I think those that
     though "well, you must have somehow brought it on yourself" are
     starting to see, it's not like that at all ...

                             * * * * *

     By the way -- you might have heard about the nonsense at Prodigy
     -- the idiotic administrators using broadscale censorship
     (correct word) to squash dissent. What you probably don't know --
     because the reports themselves were self-censored -- was that the
     original discussion, purged by Prodigy, was over gay rights and
     anything to do with gay people. This is what Prodigy claimed was
     "offensive material".

     FidoNews 7-48                Page 5                   26 Nov 1990


     Shame, shame, on the so-called liberal types who in their turn
     did not report that. It was not simply not including the gay
     angle; it was intentionally removed, a very different thing.
     Everyone suffers from that removal.

                             * * * * *

     (1) The usenet is our ally. We need as many interconnections with
     it, and other networks, as is reasonably possible. We are all
     under attack. Besides, it's technically interesting.

     (2) Don't fall for what Pastor Martin Niemoller did; ("In Germany
     they first came for the Communists and I didn't speak because I
     wasn't a Communist...") We're all "commies" in that sense -- the
     brat hackers are simply the thin edge of the wedge. Criminals are
     criminals -- which is decided in a court of law, not with a
     sealed search warrant and intimidation.

     (3) Watch for EFF stuff in the net, or contact them directly. EFF
     Inc, 112 Second St, Cambridge MA 02142. voice (617)-864-0665, or
     usenet eff@well.sf.ca.us Bug 'em for an echo conference. Tell 'em
     you are from the FidoNet.

     (4) The First Conference on Computers, Freedom & Privacy will be
     held 25 - 28 March 91 at the SFO Marriott. The goal is to open
     channels of communication between network and telecomm experts,
     info/datacomm providers, law enforcement, prosecutors,
     constitutional exports, computer users and civil libertarians.
     Attendance will be limited to 600 people. The event is sponsored
     by Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, and chaired
     by Jim Warren (of West Coast Computer Faire, amongst other
     notorieties). CFPconf, 345 Swett Rd, Woodside CA 94062, FAX

             It is of more importance to the community that
             innocence should be protected than it is that
             guilt should be punished, for guilt and crimes
             are so frequent in the world that all of them
             cannot be punished, and many times they happen
             in such a manner that it is not of much consequence
             to the public whether they are punished or not. But
             when innocence itself is brought to the bar and
             condemned, especially to die, the subject will
             exclaim, "It is immaterial to me whether I behave
             well or ill, for virtue is no security". And if such
             sentiment as this should take place in the mind of
             the subject there would be an end to all security
             whatsoever.

      Nets & Geography, Rules, Regulations, and other useless drivel
                             by Kwityer Bychin


     Hi Ho folks, how did you enjoy your Thanksgiving? Have a good
     time? That's just wonderful. Now enough of the merriment, its
     time to pay attention to our ugly hobby and get all worked up
     again.

     Did you read last week's Snooze article by that guy named Garth
     Somebodyorother from somewhere in Zone 3? Of COURSE you didn't
     (still can't unpack the Snooze eh?). Well, go back to Snooze
     #747 and read the damn thing. Then come back here.

     <time passes>

     All done? Ok, good.

     Now, it seems to me that this guy is on to something. Splitting
     off all the zones into independant Kinda-Fido-Related networks.
     I like it. Decentralize and all that stuff. Hey, if we did that,
     it would take the wind out of guys like MATT WHELAN who like to
     foist policies upon people. But that's a story for another
     day...

     What really piqued my interest, was his comment about trashing
     the geography rule for nets. This has potential. Its not such a
     bad idea to let someone be in whatever net he wants for whatever
     reason. I mean, why the hell not? Costs, you say? Piffle.

     See, all you gotta do is make the NCs not responsible to send a
     damn thing.  As a matter of fact, they ain't responsible to SEND
     a damn thing now. All they gotta do is make the mail, diff, and
     the Snooze "available". So if some guy in California wants to
     join a net in New York, why should the New York net care? Make
     the California guy pick up EVERYTHING. I mean, hey, if the
     Califonia Dude is crazy enough to wanna call NY all the time for
     his stuff, who are WE to save him from himself??

     Garth is right about the democracy deal. Rumor has it that
     Fidonet is moving toward democracy (which is really horsepucky
     since all the "movement" toward it is people moving their lips,
     there ain't been one single change to policy instilling one iota
     of democracy anywhere) . And if that's REALLY TRUE, what good is
     it if a guy who doesn't like the local net's policy can't get
     OUT of the net?

     I mean if you don't like the town ordinance that prohibits
     overnight parking, you can always move the hell out of the town.
     Can't move anywhere in Fidonet.

     FidoNews 7-48                Page 8                   26 Nov 1990


     Rules, rules, rules and more rules. Policy 4, Echopol, Gatepol,
     Interpol, Yo Mama's Pol, do this, do it my way, because I said
     so, I'm a *C, There AIN'T no vote, I make the rules - you keep
     your mouth shut, I wanna send mail to Alternet, NO! you can't,
     you gotta send it through me, GET THAT NODE NUMBER OUT OF THE
     SEEN-BYs, Vote for ME, WAIT! you can't vote!, You're just a
     sysop, You ain't a AUTHORIZED GATEWAY, Your mailer isn't
     compliant, IT IS SO, *YOURS* isn't, policy complaint....

     Ain't this fun? Oh yeah. We all got computers that can send
     messages to each other, but in order to do that, we gotta have
     six billion pages of rules and piles of "administrators" who
     make 'em up and throw 'em at you. And you can't vote THEM *OR*
     the rules out.

     What's the POINT? I dunno, you tell me. Food for thought. Eat
     THAT and save a turkey.

     the ratification referendum for the revised EchoPol, which is
     scheduled to begin on January 15, 1991.

     If you desire, we would be happy to assist you in choosing a
     slate of qualified candidates.

     Sincerely yours,

     Norm Henke, Region 11 Echo Coordinator
     Ken Wilson, Region 12 Echo Coordinator
     Dan Buda, Region 14 Echo Coordinator
     John Valentyn, Region 15 Echo Coordinator

     Comdex '90 Gaming Dept. --

     Vegas sure has changed in the last 5 years.  I remember when
     you could play blackjack with a single deck and a two dollar
     bet.  I didn't look REAL hard, but a lot of places had a double
     deck, played 3/4 of the way through for three dollars.

     I was staying at Bally's and playing five dollar bets.  And the
     6 deck played 2/3 of the way through.  I was unlucky and happy.
     Bally's lets you surrender, and they don't mind you bringing a
     cheat sheet to the table.  I didn't do either, and I won a
     little money.  I should have won a lot.  Later, I'll tell you
     my system.

     Check out the poker room.  The low exposure poker table is less
     expensive than blackjack;  you can buy in for 20 bucks and play
     for hours.  I didn't have much luck and lost money overall at
     the poker table.  I had only one winning session there.  One
     evening, Redd Foxx walks in.  I didn't see his show, but he got
     some of my money anyway.  "You big dummy".

     I had mixed feelings about craps.  I usually never play the
     game, but on the advice of my brother-in-law, played his system
     for a while. His system is to play 5 on the pass line, 10
     behind the line odds, and put 6 bucks each on the 6 and 8 odds
     bets.  The '27' dollar system.  It sort of made sense, but I
     lost money just the same.

     I also played the slot machine with the 77 thousand dollar
     jackpot. Dropped a bunch of quarters in that, won nothing.  I
     figured that a real long shot bet was something you had to try
     once.


     1 Iron Dept.  --

     Out at The Legacy : 18 hole golf course cut in STONE.
     Literally.  If you got very far off the fairway, you entered
     the rough, which is usually about 1/8 inch of grass and dirt,
     then a gravel sand mixture which scratched my new irons.  That
     and the idiots they let play in front of us; or maybe hack in
     front of us. We putted the last green in the dark.  I shot 90
     but had 6 out of bounds penalties.  We played from the blue
     tees.

     The second time, I thought I played much better, but had a 93.
     We played from the black tees, the way back markers.  My new
     clubs were playing great.  Again it was slow play, which I hate,
     but at least we finished in daylight.  I'm so used to bermuda
     greens, and to get onto a bent grass course, like a pool table,
     was quite a new experience.  Actually I did quite well putting.


     From the Horse's Mouth Dept. --

     Vince "Bink" Perriello assured me that Bink 2.50 will be out
     before the new year.  I have several changes of my own planned
     for this release, beyond those for 2.40 which Vince doesn't
     include :

     1. rid keyboard buffer clearing in b_initva.c at shutdown,
     2. expand outbound queue display down the page by narrowing the
        recent status and transfer status windows,
     3. separate the screen blank timer from the modem reset timer,
        in mailer.c/others, add screen blank timer config,
     4. add file size transmits, other counters to statistic screen.


     The System --

     Believe it or not, I got my college degree in math and I'm
     perfectly capable of calculating the odds of card appearance.
     However, playing into a 4 deck shoe is just a bit much : "I'm
     not an excellent driver."  So I used " The System ".  I only
     won a little, so " The System " let me down.

     The first rule : always double down when you should.  You cannot
     overcome the house's advantage unless you double your bet at the
     appropriate time.  The house advantage is that when both you and
     the dealer go over 21 ( bust ), you did it first, so you lose.
     Odds of player or dealer busting are about 28%, and both busting
     ( remember you lose ) is about 8%.  Odds of a tie ( push ) is
     about 8% which leaves your win/loss percentage at 42/50.  You
     make up some of this by getting 2.5 times your money on a
     blackjack ( two card 21 ).  You make up the rest by doubling
     your bet.

     The second rule :  when 'ten' cards are in the shoe, your odds
     of winning are increased.  The simple reason is that the dealer
     is more likely to bust.  For every 13 cards, there are 4 tens,
     about 1 in 3.  For every hand, there are about 3 cards played
     per player, so we compare the number of 'seen' tens per deal to
     the number of players.  If there are a lot fewer tens, increase
     your bet.  I wait until after the third deal, and divide tens
     seen by the number of hands.  Double your bet when that ratio
     is less than 4 for 7 players.

     I liked " The System " so much, I wrote a simulator that plays
     blackjack as fast as it can, while keeping statistics.  You can
     file request that program, with C source code from 1:124/6120,
     the name is S21.ZIP.  According to the simulator, I should have
     a bunch of money.  Oh, well, maybe next time.  Have fun.
