                              MOVBASIC.COM,MOVBASIC.ARC

          I have recently noticed a program called MOVBASIC.COM and I
     also noticed that it was very similar to a piece of commercial
     software that my company is currently beta testing. I then
     downloaded the file MOVBASIC.ARC. When I unarced it and checked
     it out I relized that it was the beta test version of our
     package with the messages changed a bit. I then called all the
     people that we had beta testing and asked them about it and I
     found that one person had inadvertantly uploaded it to a RBBS-PC
     system. I was given a copy of the message left to the sysop of
     the Board after he relized what he did but couldn't "kill" the
     file. I will list it below. (Names Changed for our security)


         TO:SYSOP
       FROM:John Doe
       Subj:PAKBASIC

            sysop,
                  Please delete the file PAKBASIC.COM From your
                  file listing and you hard disk as in it was
                  mistakenly uploaded and is a beta test version
                  of a commercial package that I am testing.
                  Thank You VERY much!

           John Doe

        The Sysop Did delete it but somewhere someone must have
     gotten it before he could delete it.


        The Only Thing I ask Is that All Fido Sysops PLEASE delete it
     from your board and put in you files.bbs:

     MOVBASIC.ARC NOT P.D. Commercial Software

        I Thank You For This and Hope that you will call out BBS
     Soon.

        OUTER is here!  A new program for the "O" command

     There has been a program floating around for some time
     now called OUTSIDE that was a "mini BBS" and could be
     used in conjunction with the "O" command from FIDO's
     main menu.  The problem was that OUTSIDE was unreliable -
     it would occasionally cause the system to hang up, and it
     was hard to use.  Upon contacting the author, I found out
     the program was written in what he called "an antiquated
     language" and he was not willing to release the source.

     I realized it was time to re-write the whole thing.  Jim
     Fullton did most of the work, and I've been making fixes
     and small improvements from the beginning.  The program
     is called OUTER, and we believe that it will soon replace
     OUTSIDE.

     From Grant Fengstad (134/0) Alberta Fido Coordinator:

     TO:   Ron Bemis
     SUB:  Howdy
     Hi Ron.  I recently rec'd your Outer program and I must
     say "Fantastic".  I had used Outside previously, but your
     program puts it to shame...

     The comments are rolling in, and the program hasn't even
     been released yet!  Some of the advantages:

     o Single keystroke execution of commands
     o SysOp-selectable access by privilege level - no passwords
     o Built-in watchdog timer/carrier detect monitor
     o Control-C and Control-Break disabled
     o Absolute security when used with IBMAUX
     o Checks SCHED.BBS so a user can't "over-run" an event
     o Displays "time left" each time a user sees the menu
     o Easy to understand and set up command file for control
     o Optional help and welcome messages may be displayed
     o Complete accountability of user activity

     The program can be downloaded from file area #5 on Fido
     151/104 Nibbles and Bytes.  A first-time user can download
     it.  C source code is available for "registered" users.
     Oh, and for the folks that got the program before it was
     released - we're now in version 1.15 and there are quite
     a few goodies in the ARC that you probably don't have.

                         Pittsburgh Area BBS Picnic

       Recently the Pittsburgh Area BBS SysOps got together and
     organized the 1st BBS picnic for all FIDO users in the
     area. Before the SysOps had SysOp picnics but they decided
     to have one that involved everyone. A nearby picnic area
     was chosen and directions and info was distributed
     through out the net. Not being a SysOp (Hoping to be one
     soon) I was excited about this type of gathering. I was
     wondering about the people I would meet. Would they
     meet my expectations that I have associated their
     messages with their personality? Then the day came, and
     to say the least I was not disappointed!!! It was very
     interesting to meet all the people that I have typed to
     and have had discussions (sometimes arguments) with.
     Some met their type of messages and some even over
     my expectations. All day people ate, drank, played and
     of course talked SHOP. SysOps gave info on how to run
     FIDO more efficiently and correctly. Some also brought
     defective equipment to see if anyone could figure out
     how to fix it. There was one Tandon Hard drive that even
     Tandon would not want to fix.
       I would advise all other nets and such to try to
     organize something of this nature. All the users that
     showed up did not go home disappointed. This is a great
     way to get people closer together and to make new friends.
     I can't wait for the next one.

     By Joaquim Homrighausen
     Sysop at Future Hacker Central 501/4609
     September 7th, 1986 at 3:49 am!

     Hello all people out there. This should be an unusual place
     to receive an article from. Here in Sweden, things are growing
     rapidly, and as times goes by it gets colder. But what the heck
     we're vikings right?! And we're born from a packet of ice with
     a label on it telling wether it's a female or a male.

     Let's get serious. The main reason for this article is to let
     people (mainly FIDO sysops of course) listen to the voice from
     this part of the foreign world. And don't worry, Tjernobyl has
     not poluted these bytes in which this letter resides! But
     anyway, I've just finished a "hot" dispute with my fellow sysop
     (or co-sysop). And we've come up with some (from a "poor" guy
     like me) interesting facts. Fido started all up as a Public
     Domain and there weren't any problems opening a new BBS because
     it was all free. Sure great, I can just download the CORE files
     and then open a FIDO BBS of my own, and then eventually join
     the net. Sounds good to me, except for the terrifying "news"
     from the "good-old-US" (yes, I've been working at both Apple,
     Commodore, and IBM in the United States of America, so I'm not
     a total outsider) that Fido probably won't be "Public Domain"
     anymore.

     What's this (my co-sysop said BULLS??? about it), we're getting
     greedy aren't we? OK, let's look at it from this angle. How
     many hours do you think people have spent all over the world
     creating new FIDO utilities to make life easier for users/sysops
     of a FIDO BBS? Several (me included), and how many hours
     compared to that do you think the developer(s) of FIDO have
     spent? About a ten to one ratio would be very close. So let's
     start charging all users/hosts and sysops all over the world so
     we could get something in return for all the work we have put in
     to it. THINK (yes with those gray things called cells)! WHY do
     "we" have to start charging people for this GREAT service? Huh?

     This is not IBM nor is it DEC, or IS IT? Since when did Public
     Domain BBS go off the market? Well, I guess it started with a
     program called FIDO, or something like it uh? This is really
     a "John Cleese" (M.Python) classic. I mean BE SERIOUS.

     Well, I'd like to have some FEEDBACK on this, my Net/Node number
     was at the top of this article, so start typing. And to the
     author(s) of FIDO I'd like to dedicate this last line. If a
     machine isn't anything without good software what good is the
     core of an apple without the "goodies" around it?

     Metro-Fire Fido, 135/14(0)


                            SEAdog, I Love It!


     This is an unsolicited testimonial. I have no financial interest
     in SEAdog or in S.E.A. I have never met Thom Henderson or any of
     his S.E.A. cohorts. I am writing this to encourage other Sysops
     to become SEAdog capable (XP:) and make their systems much more
     flexible.

     SEAdog is a stand-alone, E-Mail processing program. It sells, on
     the open market, for $100.00. It is designed to provide a method
     for corporate users to automate their message and file handling
     between branches or offices during regular business hours or
     after the offices close for the day. It allows corporate users
     to get more value from their computer installations by making
     them work nights when they might otherwise be idle.

     SEAdog has an added benefit for Fido system operators. In
     addition to its mail and file handling abilities, SEAdog can
     invoke a BBS by setting a command line and executing a batch
     file. When run in front of a Fido board, SEAdog becomes a 24
     hour, mail handling system and allows your system to send or
     receive mail at any time. With SEAdog on-line, you are no longer
     restricted to the National FidoNet window for message or file
     transfers.

     The SEAdog package comes with several utility programs that
     further enhance the operation. Included are two powerful file
     handling utilities; GET and SEND. With these programs, it is
     possible to send or request files to or from other SEAdogs at
     any time. The MAIL program also allows you to request updates of
     files you already have and the files will only be transferred if
     the remote SEAdog has a NEWER version of the file than you do.
     If you are in a hurry, you can send mail or make file transfers
     immediately by invoking a CRASH event. The MAIL program is also
     a sophisticated message editor that allows you to FORWARD
     messages to other Nodes, operate under different Net/Node
     numbers (useful for Hosts and private Net participants), print
     messages, write messages to files, send 'Carbon Copies' of
     messages to other Nodes while writing the message to one Node,
     enter messages by entering the name of the person you are
     sending it to while SEAdog adds the appropriate Net/Node number,
     and many other features.

     This Node has been operating under SEAdog 3.80 for several
     months and the support from S.E.A. has been terrific, both by
     telephone and by Net mail. I have had several weird problems in
     fully implementing SEAdog due to my peculiar hardware and Thom
     has been patient with my myriad questions and helped me at every
     turn. I've also received a lot of help from the IBM HELP, SEADOG
     HELP and MODEMS EAST HELP Nodes in resolving some of the more
     arcane problems.
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   22 Sep 1986


     SEAdog is available to Fido Sysops for the ridiculously low
     price of $50.00. This is a special offer to Fido Sysops only.
     SEAdog requires an IBM or compatible computer and a Hayes or
     compatible modem. There is a DEC version in beta-test on 1/0,
     even as I write.

     I suggest you send for the program as soon as possible. You will
     find it much more valuable than the fifty dollars it costs and
     your system will be tied into the growing number of SEAdog
     capable Nodes and become a 24 hour NetMail system. Your system's
     efficiency and capabilities will be dramatically enhanced.

     I love it. If you are into NetMail, you will too!

     From:  Mark J. Welch, Fido 161/459 [WelchNet, Berkeley, CA]


                   Shareware Authors: Under Attack

     [Even if you skip the article, please read the request at the
     end.-mjw]

     I have just been notified that PC-SIG's attorney is sending
     threatening letters to a number of firms engaged in the
     business of selling disks that contain Shareware and public
     domain programs.

     For those who don't realize, PC-SIG is not a user group. It
     is a profitable business, owned by an individual. It has a
     rapidly-growing staff of paid employees, and is planning to
     release a CD-ROM disk soon with its entire library on it. Its
     main business is selling disks with MS-DOS Shareware and
     public domain programs on them for $6 each.

     I have not yet seen the letter, but was told it makes the
     following demands:

     a) The recipient firm must cease using the PC-SIG numbering
        scheme. (Trivia question: where did PC-SIG get its
        numbering scheme?)

     b) The recipient firm may not include the PC-SIG disk summary
        files on disks being resold or in their own catalogs. PC-
        SIG is claiming copyright ownership of that text, despite
        the lack of any copyright notice on the disk or file.

     c) The recipient firm is ordered to put a notice in its
        newsletter or other brochures advising all its customers
        that it is not PC-SIG, does not represent PC-SIG, and
        including PC-SIG's address and phone number.

     Several firms, not having the financial resources to
     investigate their legal options or resist this intimidation,
     have complied with the first two demands, adopting new
     numbering schemes and creating their own "disk summary"
     files.

     In my opinion, these letters are intended to intimidate
     legitimate individuals and companies who wish to assist
     Shareware authors and their customers, and who usually want
     to make a few dollars from that enterprise. The immediate
     effect is that several such companies have pulled GAGS and
     other programs from their software libraries until they can
     review the disks to create their own summary files.

     In other words, fewer copies of GAGS are being sold, and PC-
     SIG is thus attempting to monopolize the market for my
     program (and others).

     [This is not to say that all of the folks out there selling
     Fidonews                     Page 9                   22 Sep 1986


     disks are good guys. Many are themselves selling GAGS
     (and other programs) illegally, since they haven't requested
     my permission to do so, as required in the documentation. But
     at least one firm that properly asked for my permission was
     later forced to pull the disk while he re-did the summary
     file.]

     I would like to gather as much information about all of this
     as possible.

     REQUEST:

     I am trying to gather information on the facts and legal
     issues surrounding all of this.

     1) Please send me the names and addresses of any organization
        (commercial or non-profit, user group, individual, or
        business) which sells disks containing public domain and
        Shareware programs.

     2) Please let me know if you, as a Shareware author or
        vendor, have been treated in an unexpected way by any
        vendor or author. (In other words, have any authors been
        screwed over, or vendors received threatening letters?
        Also, has anyone been exceptionally nice to you?)

     3) Please point me to any legal authorities, articles, or
        such, which discuss the legal issues involved in
        Shareware. Have there been any legal actions yet?

     4) Please let me know of other authors who have placed a
        price-per-disk restriction on PC-SIG's right to sell their
        programs. (Their CD-ROM disk will sell for considerably
        more than the $8 maximum I allow.)

     PLEASE: Don't assume that "someone else" will provide me with
     information you know about! Every little piece of information
     will help! Thanks.

     I will try to gather the information together and will
     summarize the results in a future issue of FidoNews.

     A few weeks ago I wrote an article for FidoNews enthusiastically
     praising a product I know and have come to love, DataCare. I did
     this because I thought it to be a good, worthwhile product, and
     had learned that not many people out there in FidoLand have ever
     heard anything at all about it, good or bad. So I wrote this
     article, and it appeard, and I looked at it, found a misspelled
     word and asked myself, "If I read this, would it interest me?",
     and myself replied "It sure would!".

     The reason for the rhetorical question that is the title is that
     the author of the product read the review (he probably got it off
     my board, wlthough I am not sure) and left me mail thanking me
     for my effort, as he had not known of my intentions to review
     his product. HE liked the review. He also found the misspelled
     that I thought nobody would find.

     I ran into him at lunch today and asked "Have you had any feed-
     back from that review?", expecting that he had been inundated
     with inquiries as a consequence of having had his product re-
     viewed in FidoNews. He responded that he had had ONE inquiry.

     So I thought I would write this article soliciting FidoMail from
     anyone reading it, just to see if the response I get is about
     the same in quantity as the inquiry volume he got.

     Please do not misunderstand - I look forward to each new issue
     of FidoNews - I really enjoy reading them, and just made the
     dumb assumption that everyone else did.  With the number of
     Fidos that we know about, the network connections, the number
     of potential users and readers, FidoNews readership should be
     eclipsed only by the readership of the Wall Street Journal.

     I will continue to write articles to FidoNews as long as they
     continue to be published. I would like to think they were being
     read, but most folks who write would, as I do, write for their
     own amusement only if there were no other audience. But I would
     like to hear from folks out there in FidoLand, as to who reads
     FidoNews, and what they seek in it.

     We have a very powerful vehicle here for the dissemination of
     ideas and information - an idea and medium that exists nowhere
     else in the (known) universe - a totally unorganized network,
     amorphous in topology, largely unmanaged, that actually works.
     FidoNet sets historical precedent on a daily basis. With the
     vehicle of FidoNews there is not any excuse for us not to be
     informed about any issue that impacts our precious BBSes.

     But two things are needed -
          1. Someone's gotta write the stuff;
          2. Someone ELSE has got to read it.

                               CLIMBING TREES

                                By Bill Ross

     The only advantage to the study of history is that it might allow
     us to learn from past mistakes.  In this regard,  MS-DOS  is  the
     child  of  CP/M.  Like  most  children  though,  it does things a
     little differently than its parent.  And in many cases,  a little
     better.

     For  some  of  us,  one  of the greatest irritants to CP/M is the
     limitation of 64 floppy disk directory entries,  even on a double
     sided  disk.  If we keep copies of short correspondence,  such as
     letters,  on a disk,  we usually run out of directory space  long
     before we exhaust disk file storage capacity.  MS-DOS is a little
     better;  a  single sided disk provides 64 directory entries and a
     double sided disk allows 112.  The  availability  of  hard  disks
     muddied  the  water.  Although  there  was  no longer a realistic
     problem on directory space,  they presented another problem:  how
     to keep track of so many directory entries.

     For  CP/M somebody,  I'm not sure who,  finally wrote LIBRARY,  a
     program that allows you to keep track of numerous files under one
     directory space.  And for  hard  disks,  CP/M  resorted  to  User
     Areas.  These  are  both  good solutions,  with only minor flaws.
     LIBRARY is a program external to the operating  system  and  User
     Areas   are   awkward  and  still  limited.   MS-DOS  utilizes  a
     combination of both ideas.  Technically,  it's called pathing but
     most of us commonly refer to it as Trees.

     The  term  trees comes from the fact that the main directory of a
     disk under MS-DOS is,  in fact,  only the  root  of  a  potential
     structure  of inumerable subdirectories that spread out much like
     the branches of a tree.  Each directory space may be utilized  to
     build  a  completely  isolated  "user" area with as many files as
     necessary to fill its particular needs.  The advantages of such a
     system are immediately apparent.  We now can have as many  "user"
     areas  as we are allowed directory entries on a disk (SS-64,  DS-
     112, or Hard Disks-512), and the size of the area is limited only
     by the total capacity of the disk on which it resides.

     As an illustration,  let us suppose that we might wish  to  place
     all MicroPro programs in one area utilizing a root directory name
     of  STAR.  Each  program  would  then be listed under the root as
     follows:

          WORDSTAR
          DATASTAR
          CALCSTAR
          REPORTSTAR

     These programs would not,  in actuality,  lie one under the other
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  22 Sep 1986


     of course; each would be directly acccessible from the root as in
     the following illustration:

                                    STAR

          WORDSTAR/       DATASTAR/      \CALCSTAR    \REPORTSTAR

     and  the  subfiles under these programs would reside in a similar
     manner:

                                    STAR

                /            /               \             \


          WORDSTAR        DATASTAR        CALCSTAR     REPORTSTAR

          /   \            /   \           /  \          /  \

        WS.1  WS.2       DS.1  DS.2      CS.1 CS.2     RS.1 RS.2

     The subfiles  above  might  include  any  of  the  program  files
     required  to make the named programs functional (i.e.  WSMSG.OVR,
     WINSTALL.COM,  etc.)  and  were  limited  to  two  here  just  to
     illustrate  the  tree like structure that pathing generates.  For
     those of you who fail to see any semblance of a  tree,  turn  the
     page upside down.

     Pathing  is  accomplished  with  the aid of three internal MS-DOS
     commands:  MKDIR (MAKE DIRECTORY), CHDIR (CHANGE DIRECTORY),  and
     RMDIR   (REMOVE   DIRECTORY).   More   commonly  used  but  fully
     functional short forms for these commands are  MD,  CD,  and  RD.
     They are relatively simple to use.

     Let's  generate  the  pathway directory structure of the previous
     illustration.   Utilizing  MD  we   first   generate   the   STAR
     subdirectory listing in the disk root directory.

          A>MD STAR(Return)

     We can view the results by calling up the disk directory.

          A>DIR(Return)

     DOS shows the file STAR:

         Volume in drive X has no label
         Directory of X:\

         STAR       <DIR>    07-23-85  8:15a
                 1 File(s)   360448 bytes free

     If we want to view the contents of a subdirectory we address
     it specifically:

          A>DIR STAR(Return)
     Fidonews                     Page 14                  22 Sep 1986


     and will see the following:

          Volume in drive X has no label
          Directory of X:\star

          .        <DIR>    07-23-85  8:15a
          ..       <DIR>    07-23-85  8:15A
               2 File(s)   360448 bytes free

     Even though we just created this subdirectory, it would seem that
     two  files  all ready exist in it.  These <DIR> subdirectory file
     entries are reference files only and are generated for the use of
     the subdirectory functions.  For the moment,  note their presence
     but don't worry about them.

     We can,  if we desire, now copy each of the programs we want into
     the subdirectory,  but in this case it would not be a good  idea.
     The  reason for this is that each program is composed of multiple
     files and,  after we transfered them in,  they  would  be  listed
     amongst  the files of the other programs,  as well as any working
     files we might generate as we use them.  Gad! how confusing.  No,
     the purpose of this system is to maintain order so let's  go  one
     step  further by generating additional subdirectories for each of
     the programs to occupy.  In this way,  we  can  actually  provide
     each  with  its  own  private  "user" area in which to reside and
     work.

     We do that in a similar manner in which we made  the  first  one.
     The  primary  difference is that these subdirectories will reside
     at a lower level and we must use specific instructions to  MS-DOS
     so  they  will  appear  where we want them.  In this case we want
     them all to reside within the area commanded by  STAR.  In  order
     to place them there, we give the command:

          A>MD \STAR\WS(Return)

     This  command instructs MS-DOS to (MD) Make a Directory (\) below
     STAR (\) under the name WS.  Since we still physically reside  in
     the  Root Directory,  we utilize these \ (reverse slash) marks to
     show the PATH to the place in which the new subdirectory is to be
     generated.  We generate subdirectories  for  each  of  the  other
     programs by repeating this procedure with appropriate titles and,
     to save space, will not repeat it here.  and, if we perform a DIR
     STAR, we will then see:

          Volume in drive X has no label
          Directory of X:\star

          .         <DIR>     07-23-85  8:15a
          ..        <DIR>     07-23-85  8:15a
          WS        <DIR>     07-23-85  8:15a
          DS        <DIR>     07-23-85  8:15a
          CS        <DIR>     07-23-85  8:15a
          RS        <DIR>     07-23-85  8:15a
               6 File(s)   358304 bytes free

     Well now that we have this orderly layout  of  directories  under
     which  to  organize  our programs,  how do we get the programs in
     them so that  we  can  utilize  them?  We  simply  use  the  same
     commands  that  we  have  always  used,  except  that we add Path
     directions.  For the purposes of  illustration,  we  will  assume
     that we have generated STAR on the Drive B.  In order to copy our
     WordStar   program   and   its   supporting  files  into  the  WS
     subdirectory,  place the disk with these files  in  Drive  A  and
     issue the command:

          A>COPY *.* B:\STAR\WS/V(Return)

     and  MS-DOS  will  echo each file as it copies and then state how
     many files were copied.

     We can check our work by requesting a directory listing of the WS
     subdirectory.  Using path directions we enter:

          A>DIR B:\STAR\WS(Return)

     and MS-DOS displays the following directory:

          Volume in drive B has no label
          Directory of B:\star\ws

          .         <DIR>     07-23-85  8:23a
          ..        <DIR>     07-23-85  8:23a
          WS       COM  21375 01-01-80 11:02a
          WSOVLY1  OVR  41216 03-16-84  8:02a
          WSMSGS   OVR  29056 03-16-84  8:02a
                 5 File(s)   7726496 bytes free

     And of course we repeat this procedure for each of the programs.

     All right, now that we have everything where we want them, how do
     we use them?

     Up to now,  we have done everything from the root  directory.  We
     have  generated  subdirectories,   copied  files  into  them  and
     examined the directory listings without moving ourselves  at  any
     time.  This  is  all  well  and good for disk maintenance and the
     like,   but  things  become  very  awkward  if  we  try  to   use
     subpositioned  programs  from  such  a  lofty position.  To begin
     with,  program functions seldom recognize the  path  instructions
     that  would  be  necessary  under  such  conditions.  So,  if the
     mountain can't come to Mohammad,  then Mohammad must  go  to  the
     mountain.  Our  magic  carpet  in  this  case  is CHDIR or,  more
     simply, just CD.

     Jerry Hindle
     123/6


          In this article i will attempt to give you a synapse of the
     features of FidoUtility version 1.10. This program was written by
     Benn Mann and Marshall Presnell of Fido 151/10 and 151/2.

          I found the first version of this amazing utility on the Region
     18 coordinators system and after toying around with it for a few days
     I decided to go ahead and send the message to the author (sneaky
     wasn't he). I discovered that the first version used a hidden read-
     only file as the key to testing for the message send prompt. He has
     since changed this.

          Ok on to the good stuff.

          In version 1.10 he has implemented the following utilities:

          Killsrvr          Lastuser          Twituser
          Bounce            Ricochet          Killto
          Killfrom          Waittime          Month
          Userlist          Wait              Weekday
          Killrobt          Status            Password
          Setpriv           Adopt             Twix
          Robot             Sched

          Although all of the programs reside in this utility, some are
     limited in scope (and in my opinion, use). Marshell and Benn have
     done an admirable job of implementing those that are there however
     and they are to be commended for their efforts.

          I will take the utilities one-at-a-time from the top of the
     above list.
                                    Killsrvr
                                    --------

          This will follow the fidomail message path and kill ALL messages
     generated by server whether they have been sent or not. If you run
     server on your system then you can run this as a scheduled event
     after sending the messages to insure that the same message is not
     sent twice. This program has limited application in that it is NOT
     selective as to which server messages it kills. An improvement here
     would be to add the ability to kill only those messages that have
     been sent, or all messages, selectable by switchline command.

                                    Lastuser
                                    --------

          This will tell you the name of the lastuser and print it to the
     standard output device. While there may be a need to know this
     information sometime I find no valid use for this program as all the
     system operator need do it TYPE the "lastuser.bbs" file to see who
     was the last one on the system. The authors do however make
     provisions for generating an errorlevel if the lastuser on the system
     matches a name entered on the command line. The only use I can think
     Fidonews                     Page 18                  22 Sep 1986


     of for this would be remote triggering of a non-standard event by the
     sysop by placing a call to the system. One could have the RUNBBS.BAT
     file trap an errorlevel 2 and if the last user to call before a
     specified time was in fact the sysop (or some other user specified on
     the command line) then this errorlevel could trip a non- standard
     event to run.

                                    Twituser
                                    --------

          This is useful for those of us who like to "lurk" on our side of
     the keyboard. I have occasion to have to RAPIDLY twit a user if they
     are the type that likes to call right before midnight use up all
     their time and log off at 23:59, only to call right back at 00:01 to
     go to it again. This type person  can be taught a QUICK lesson by
     simply breaking out of Fido typing the command to TWIT him and re-
     booting Fido. When the user calls back they are surprised to find
     they can do little other then get off. The command line again
     contains the name of the user (exactly as shown in the userlog) to
     twit.

                                     Bounce
                                     ------

          This sends the message back to it's originator, why I don't
     know. If a person sends a message to me that I do not care to get I
     simply kill it when I read it. Why bother (not to mention the cost)
     to send their own message back to them. I find this utility totally
     useless, and will not go into any detail here on it.

                                    Ricochet
                                    --------

          This one is GREAT. Kind of like call forwarding for messages!
     The command line contains the net/node to forward to and if
     applicable the name to send it to. If no name is specified then it is
     sent as a message to ALL. The only flaw with this utility is that if
     the message being forwarded is from out of town then the REPLY link
     is broken since the from line in the header is changed to read
     FIDOUTIL RICOCHET and the net/node number is changed to read your
     net/node number instead of the original senders. I suggest the
     authors change this to keep the original senders name and net/node
     number.

                                Killto & Killfrom
                                -----------------

          These utilities will kill any messages either to or from the
     username specified on the command line. You must also specify the
     area # to kill messages in. This is handy for cleaning up after a
     user has gone berserk and left illegal (or profane) messages all over
     your system. You simply kill them all with one fell swoop. I suggest
     that the author make a switch to kill messages either to or from a
     user in ALL areas at one time (very handy). I also suggest that you
     TWITuser immediately after running this utility.

                                 Waittime & Wait
                                 ---------------
          These two do just what the names imply. Waittime will stall a
     batch file until a specified time and then resume execution, while
     wait (if invoked without any switches) will wait till the next
     minute. If Wait is invoked with a number after it (ie WAIT 15) then
     it will stall that many seconds and then resume. This is nice for
     those 1 minute events that actually take 15 or 20 seconds to execute,
     thus keeping Fido from cycling thru the same thing over and over till
     the next minute when the window closes.

                                      Month
                                      -----

          Month if used in conjunction with the runbbs.bat file will
     return an errorlevel based on the month of the year (ie 0 for January
     and 8 for September...etc.). While this may be useful for certain
     things, I have yet to find any of these to use this particular item
     on.

                                    Userlist
                                    --------

          This one is used to get a listing of certain information from
     the userlog. It will list either:

           Username, password, times called  (command switch  "/p")
           Username, last date on, times called     ( "       "/d")
           Username, Privilege level, times called  ( "       "/r")
           Username, Fidomail credit, times called  ( "       "/$")

          With no command line switches it will list the username, city,
     and times called. Handy for a quick printout.

                                     Weekday
                                     -------

          Like month this will return an errorlevel based on the day of
     the week. I find this one more useful the month since I run different
     things on different days at odd hours.

                                    Killrobt
                                    --------

          This one acts like Killsrvr and kills any messages from ROBOT
     found in the network message area. Again I suggest a switch to kill
     only SENT messages.

                                     Status
                                     ------

          Probably the BEST status report layout and information content I
     have ever seen! This utility is GREAT. The information it lists is
     EVERY system?.bbs file you have showing the path for u/l and files
     and messages and privilege, etc. It also list the info set with the 4
     command (ie net/node # , alt net/node #, etc). It will also list out
     Fidonews                     Page 20                  22 Sep 1986


     the schedule file showing all events you have whether enabled or
     disabled. The whole program is worth it for this utility alone. I
     forgot to mention it will also list out your route?.bbs files and
     what they contain. A GREAT UTILITY guys !

                                    Password
                                    --------

          This one as the name implies allows you to change a users
     password. You invoke it with the NEW password and the username on the
     command line, in that order. Handy for changing the sysop password
     easily.

                                     Setpriv
                                     -------

          This will allow you to change the privilege level of any user
     from the command line. You use the first letter of the privilege and
     the username to change. Handy for reversing Twituser.

                                      Adopt
                                      -----

          Allows you to adopt those orphan messages for a retry at sending
     them out. Simple straightforward and easy to use.

                                      Twix
                                      ----

          Works exactly like the free-standing utility. This will list to
     the printer messages that are NEW. It is also able to list to the
     screen.

                                      Robot
                                      -----

          This is a limited use version of Thom famous automated file
     transfer utility. The author of FidoUtil says it operates in the
     interactive mode. I say it operates PERIOD. It does what it is
     supposed to do when it is supposed to do it.

                                      Sched
                                      -----

          This one allows you to change the scheduler from outside Fido.
     While this is not a bad idea I think most of us dummies would like to
     have a printout on the screen to look at while we make the changes
     needed. As it is not you must either use the status to get a hard
     copy printout and work from that, or go into Fido to make the
     changes, or use some other utility. Suggestion here is to add a
     switch to list the entire scheduler to the screen, then allow the
     sysop to change as he needs.

          There are a number of other things about FidoUtil that make it
     nice. These are the savings in disk space as mentioned by the
     authors, due to the smaller size of the file as opposed to the size
     Fidonews                     Page 21                  22 Sep 1986


     of the combined utilities. Also this program has a config file that
     takes the place of the config files of the other programs that make
     use of one. This file is also smaller then the config files of the
     rest combined.

          The authors have gone to great trouble to put EXTENSIVE help
     files into the setup for each utility involved with such info as the
     syntax for the command line, what switches are available, and the
     version number of the individual utility involved. They have also
     done a good job on the documentation included in the ARC file of
     their program. I commend them for a job well done. I also say that
     they continue to do the job as they are making every effort to ad at
     least one new utility a month to the package. Pretty soon we can use
     one program to do it ALL.

          The authors request that any bug reports be sent to Fido 151/10.
     Although I haven't as yet found any I will pass this info along. The
     latest version of FidoUtil is available from either 151/2 (the
     authors system) or mine (123/6). Again I take my hat off to these two
     men for an excellent job. (Benn and Marshall....I believe bows are in
     order here gentlemen)

     Note:  No  profit is made from the sale of the Public Domain

     inspecting,   cataloguing,  archiving  and  maintaining  the
     files. Obtaining this software yourself through the use of a
     computer with a modem using commercial  phone  access  would
     cost you much more than what we charge for the service...

     I've recently received several notes from people who are
     using old versions of these utilities.   Because of this
     I think an update notice is in order.

     Pixie's latest version is 1.31.   This is much faster than
     older versions and depending on the version you have may
     have several new features, as well as a few bug fixes.
     This will be the last major release in a while as major
     changes are planned for Pixie.

     The latest version of Sched is 5.0.   This version allows
     completely initialization of a file and specification of
     the filename to work on.  Both of these changes were made
     to facilitate Sched's use with a stand-alone scheduler
     which is currently on the back burner here at the Ark.

     Both of these utilities may be File Requested or downloaded
     from node 137/19.  Pre-registration is required if you come
     in person so send me a password first.
