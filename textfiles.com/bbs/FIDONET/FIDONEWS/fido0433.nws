     Thom Henderson, 1:107/6.1

              "Free at last!  Free at last!  Thank God Almighty, I'm
              free at last!"
                        --- Martin Luther King, Jr.


     First of all,  I want to extend my heartfelt thanks  to  everyone
     who voted for me.  Yes,  I was elected to the Board of Directors,
     and yes,  I really do deeply appreciate the show  of  confidence.
     I'm VERY glad to know that my efforts have been appreciated.

     But I felt that I had to resign.

     Before leaving, I nominated Rick Siegel as my Alternate, so he'll
     be  on  the board in place of me.  I've known Rick for some time.
     He's a concerned sysop who I think will make an  excellent  board
     member.  Besides, every stew needs salt.

     I  should  explain.  As I read it,  article 11 of the Articles of
     Association says I can't be  on  the  board.  The  articles  were
     passed by a  majority  of  the  members.  But  the  members  also
     elected a number of board members in addition to myself who would
     be disqualified under article 11.  So what to do?

     A  few  days  before  the  conference an emergency meeting of the
     Interim Board was called to consider article 11.  At that time we
     voted to temporarily suspend article 11 until the new board could
     sit and consider the matter.  I still stand by that  decision.  I
     wouldn't swear it was right, but I stand by it anyway.  Meanwhile
     I decided that,  if I was elected,  I would stand aside until the
     new board had decided what to do about article 11.

     Then it came down to brass tacks, as they say.  I got elected.  I
     spent a great deal of the weekend wrestling with  my  conscience,
     and  finally decided that in good faith I must apply the original
     article 11 to myself.

     So now I'm back where I was a little over  a  year  ago,  on  the
     outside  looking  in.  I'll  probably like it better here.  I was
     never really comfortable with being an "insider".

     IFNA is off and running now -- it doesn't need me any more.  It's
     better off without the controversy.

     Tom Marshall - IFNA Secretary
     IFNA Legal 1/12

     DRAFT - 082787

     MINUTES OF THE FIRST IFNA BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING
     August 21, 1987 at about 1229
     Poplar Room, Radisson Mark Plaza Hotel

     The Meeting was called by the Chair of the Interim Board of
     Directors, IFNA Executive Director, Ken Kaplan.

     The first order of old business was the distribution of folders
     of information for each of the attendees.  Those attending were
     those persons present at the Fourth International FidoNet
     Association Conference who had been elected as Members of the
     Interim Board, as announced by the Chair of the Nominations and
     Elections Committee, Bob Morris 16/0, as part of the 0900 Opening
     Ceremonies Item on the Conference Agenda.

     On motion of Ben Baker 1/0 At-Large Director, Ken Kaplan was
     nominated Chair of the Board of Directors.  That motion was
     carried unanimously.

     Ryugen Fisher, Director - Division 11, moved the nomination of
     Tom Marshall as IFNA Secretary and Parliamentarian.  That motion
     was carried. Thereafter, Tom Marshall 107/524 attended each
     Board Meeting to record the Minutes and act as Parliamentarian.

     The next order of business on the Agenda, as proposed by the
     Secretary and adopted by the Board for this Meeting, was to
     bring before the Board the previous actions of the Interim Board
     suspending Article 11 of the ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION FOR
     INTERNATIONAL FIDONET ASSOCIATION and recommending adoption of a
     substitute Article 11 (known as the Kessler-Marshall Substitute)
     previously approved by Mark S. Rubin, Esq., St. Louis IFNA
     General Counsel.  On motion by Ryugen Fisher to adopt the
     substitute Article 11, pending further review and until the
     Meeting of Board of Directors scheduled for Sunday, August 23,
     1987 at 1000.  The motion carried.

     The next Agenda item was for the Board to receive formally the
     Report of the Nominations and Elections Committee.  On motion of
     Ryugen Fisher, seconded by Mark Grennan, after discussion, the
     Board adopted that Report.  On the request of the Secretary, a
     motion was made to amend the Report to state that the Directors
     elected were for the voting Divisions as specified in By-Law 24
     and that full names of each elected Director be substituted,
     when provided by such to the Secretary.  The motion carried.

     The Secretary requested each elected Director to appoint an
     Alternate, as defined by the By-Laws, as promptly as possible.
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 3                   31 Aug 1987


     On motion of Ryugen Fisher the Chair opened the floor for
     nominations for the Office of President of IFNA.  Thom Henderson
     was nominated, but declined the nomination on personal
     privilege.  Gee Wong 103/312; Mark Grennan; and Don Daniels
     were nominated, whereupon Ben Baker moved that nominations be
     closed and that motion carried.   Each of the nominees was
     requested to state his qualifications.  Gee Wong withdrew
     himself from consideration on matters of personal privilege.
     That withdrawal left only two candidates, each of whom spoke in
     his behalf as did others.  On motion by Thom Henderson, which
     carried, the Board concluded that the voting for the Office of
     President would include the election by the Board of the Vice
     President, with the person receiving the highest number of votes
     being appointed President and the other candidate being
     appointed as Vice President. Upon calling the question, the
     Board voted to elect Don Daniels President and Mark Grennan
     Vice President.

     The last business item was a duly made and adopted Board
     Resolution, appointing Ken Kaplan as Acting Treasurer of IFNA,
     pending nomination and election of a Treasurer at the scheduled
     Board Meeting, Sunday, August 23, 1987 at 1000.

     At about 1315 the First Board of Directors Meeting was adjourned
     to a time after the Banquet at a place to be announced by the Chair.

     Respectfully submitted,

     Tom Marshall, Secretary

     (NOTE: A number of Alternates were appointed by Directors,
     both those present and by telephone contact on August 22, 1987.
     A Listing of the present Members of the Board of Directors,
     Alternates and Officers of IFNA is enclosed herewith as a

     DRAFT - 082787

     MINUTES OF THE SECOND IFNA BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING
     August 21, 1987 at about 2100
     Great Hall and Patio, Radisson Mark Plaza Hotel

     The Second Meeting of the IFNA Board of Directors was called by
     the Chair and convened following the Banquet at the Great Hall,
     but was moved to the Patio at the request of all.

     The Chair called the Meeting to order.  The Agenda as proposed by
     the Secretary and adopted by the Board was to consider matters to
     be on the Agenda for the Sunday, August 23, 1987 Board Meeting
     scheduled in the Conference Agenda and open to all attending the
     Conference.

     Ben Baker proposed a new Agenda item, action on the proposed
     substitute Article 11 by the Board.  It was agreed that that item
     would be considered first.

     Ben Baker moved the immediate adoption of the substitute Article
     11 of the ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION.  A lively discussion followed,
     ending with the call of the question.  On vote it was determined
     that eight Directors were for Ben Baker's motion and four
     against.  The Secretary was called upon to rule whether the
     matter could be adopted.  Reference to Article 9, ARTICLES OF
     ASSOCIATION, showed that "three-fourths vote of all directors"
     was required and that for the substitute Article 11 to be adopted
     an affirmative vote of seventeen Directors was required, making
     it impossible for the twelve Directors voting to effect
     amendment.

     On motion duly made and seconded, Ben Baker's motion was tabled
     until the Sunday Board of Directors Meeting.  The President and
     Vice President were requested by the Board to contact the absent
     Members by telephone, Saturday, August 22, 1987 and to request
     that each absent Director appoint as an Alternate someone in
     attendance at the Conference.

     A motion was made that the text of the substitute Article 11 be
     amended to include the test of Mitch Kessler's proposed "purpose"
     language.  After discussion, the Board adopted the intent of the
     motion by requesting the Secretary to include the the sense of
     the language in a Board Resolution. (See: Enclosed Resolution
     below, Enclosure Item 2.)

     On motion made and duly adopted the Board convened itself as a
     Committee on the Whole to act on the Secretary's request of
     determining the Agenda for the Sunday Board of Directors Meeting.

     After considerable discussion, the Committee on the Whole
     reported the enclosed proposed Agenda, Enclosure Item 1.  The
     Committee of the Whole was then dissolved.
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 7                   31 Aug 1987


     The Board was reconvened by the Chair.  On suggestion that the
     hour was late, on motion duly made and adopted, the Second
     Meeting of the Board was adjourned at 2343, subject to being
     recalled on August 22, 1987 by the Chair at a place to be
     announced.

     Respectfully submitted,

     Tom Marshall, Secretary

     (NOTE:  The enclosed Agenda and its attachment, the proposed
     Board Resolution relating to Article 11 were prepared by the
     Secretary and made available to the Board of Directors and
     Alternates present at the Conference, as well as distributed to

     Tom Marshall - IFNA Secretary
     IFNA Legal 1/12

     DRAFT - 082787

     MINUTES OF THE THIRD IFNA BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING
     August 23, 1987 at about 1000
     Plaza A and Great Hall, Radisson Mark Plaza Hotel

     The Meeting was called to order by the Chair AT 1032.  The
     Agenda prepared by the Secretary and widely distributed to those
     attending the Conference on Saturday, August 22, 1987, was
     adopted.  After noting that those Board Members and Alternates
     present were greater than the three-fourths required by the
     Article 9, ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, a motion was adopted to
     amend Item I. A. to add "and all acts of the Interim Board taken
     in accordance with those Articles of Association and By-Laws."

     Motions were made on Items I. A. through D. and discussion
     proceeded, including recognition by the Chair of IFNA Members
     and others attending on the floor in order that they could be
     heard.

     It appearing that the length of the Meeting was going to exceed
     the time allowed by the Hotel for use of Plaza A and that there
     was general agreement on adopting all the Items on the Agenda
     under the heading "I.  Old Business ...", upon the request of
     Randy Bush, a motion was duly made by a Board Member and adopted
     to accept those Agenda Items, as amended above.

     The Chair then opened the Meeting up for consideration of the
     Agenda Items II. New Business:, Items II. A. through G.

     The Board heard discussion by Board Members, Alternates and from
     the floor on Items A. through D. and, after motions duly made
     and adopted, took the following actions on each such Item:

     Item II. A. - POLICY4 - Referred the matter of adoption of the
     revised POLICY4, reported by Thom Henderson as the proposal of
     the participants of the Coordinators EchoMail Conference, to the
     Executive Committee for review; the soliciting of the views
     of the FidoNet Community; and reporting to the Board that
     Committee's recommendations thereon.

     Item II. B. - Standing Committee appointments and the Chair for
     each such Committee as required by By-Law 30.  Don Daniels read
     a list of appointments he as President suggested and called for
     opening up membership on such Standing Committees to all
     concerned. The Board duly adopted Don Daniels' requests that
     those names read by him be appointed; that the list of those
     appointed be published in FidoNews, along with a call for
     recommendations for further appointments.  The Chair announced
     that he would appoint the Chairs of each Standing Committee from
     the members of such and, until such Committees were formed, the
     persons presently acting as Chairs were appointed as "Interim
     Chairs" of each.  It was the sense of the Meeting that the
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 11                  31 Aug 1987


     announcements of the President and Chair of the Board be adopted.
     Further details relating to this Item will be published in
     FidoNews.

     Item II. B. 1. - A new Agenda Item was proposed and adopted that
     the "four Directors selected by The Board of Directors", as
     required by Article 6, ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, be nominated and
     elected by the Board as promptly as possible.  Accordingly the
     Chair opened up the Meeting for nominations of Board Members for
     the four open positions on the Executive Committee.  Nominations
     were duly made for the following: Kurt Reisler; Hal DuPrie; Wes
     Cowley; Bob Hartman; Steve Jordan; Rob Barker; and Ryugen Fisher.
     After a motion to close nominations was duly adopted, the
     President and Vice President prepared written ballots and
     distributed them to the Board Members and Alternates present.
     The voting was, by consensus, postponed until the resumption of
     the Board Meeting after 1200.

     At about this time, it having been noted that Thom Henderson,
     though elected as Director - Division 13, had elected not to
     participate in the Board's deliberations and had "informally
     resigned" his elected position, the secretary, at 1153 August
     23, 1987 was handed a written resignation of Thom Henderson.
     Upon receipt of that document, the Secretary notified the Chair
     and the Meeting that a vacancy existed on the Board and that
     there no Alternate had been appointed.  The Secretary's request
     that the the Board make filling that position the first order of
     business when the Meeting resumed was adopted.

     Item II. C. - Budget Report - As Acting Treasurer, Ken Kaplan
     presented the Board with a written Budget Report of IFNA
     Operations and Financial status, along with a proposed Budget
     for the coming year.  Ken Kaplan noted that he had been assisted
     by Leonard Mednick in the preparation of his submissions.
     On motion duly made and adopted, the Board accepted the Budget
     Report as presented by the Acting Treasurer and referred the
     proposed Budget to the Administration and Finance Committee.
     Upon motion made at the request of Ken Kaplan, Leonard Mednick's
     name was placed in nomination for the Office of Treasurer.  No
     others having been nominated, nominations were duly closed and
     the Board elected Leonard Mednick as Treasurer.

     ITEM II. D. - Policy Directives to the FTSC - On motion made by
     Don Daniels,  the Board referred this Item to both the Fido
     Technical Standards Committee for its recommendations on the
     nature of the effort it would undertake and to the Executive
     Committee for consideration of the policies that should be
     implemented by the FTSC.

     Item II. E. - Consideration of changing the NOTICE language in
     the text as it appears after the Copyright Notice in the weekly
     FidoNet NodeList; and consideration of Licensing IFNA properties
     to commercial users.  The Board heard some discussion from Board
     Members; Alternates; and the floor.  Upon a request made by a
     Board Member, Tom Marshall, IFNA Legal, commented on a suggestion
     that the NodeList could be published without any Copyright
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 12                  31 Aug 1987


     Notice or accompanying NOTICE text.  The Meeting was advised
     that, as Copyright comes into existence on the instant of
     creation in a form readable by man or machine, such a
     publication would not affect the Copyright status of the
     compilation work, the NodeList.  However, it was recommended that
     that not be done as there are procedural advantages to including
     the Copyright Notice and a NOTICE be used to specify allowed and
     prohibited usage.  After further discussion, the matter was duly
     tabled for further review by the Executive Committee, promptly
     after its election in the resumed session of the Board Meeting.

     At this point, the Meeting was recessed, pending its movement to
     the Great Hall, for fifteen minutes.

     The Chair reconvened the Meeting in the Great Hall at about
     1230.  The first Item on the Agenda was the filling the Board
     vacancy created by Thom Henderson's resignation.  The Chair
     opened the Meeting by calling for Division 13 Members present to
     nominate candidates for Director - Division 13.  Rick Siegel
     107/27 was duly nominated.  No other nominations having been
     made, the Board closed nominations and directed the Secretary to
     note the election of Rick Siegel as Director - Division 13.
     Rick Siegel appointed Dave Oshea as Alternate - Division 13 by
     written notice to the Secretary.

     The next order of business was the voting by the Board on the
     candidates nominated for the four Directors' positions on the
     Executive Committee.  The President and Vice President collected
     the written ballots.  A short recess was declared to allow the
     President and Vice President to count the votes, the Secretary
     observed the counting.  Three of the four were elected on the
     first ballot and two candidates ended up in a tie for the fourth
     position.  New ballots containing the names of the two tied
     candidates were prepared and distributed.  On counting the
     second round ballots the fourth member was elected.

     Upon reconvening after the Board Meeting, at the request of the
     President, the Secretary announced the following results:
     The Directors elected to serve on the Executive Committee are:
     Kurt Reisler; Bob Hartman; Steve Jordan; Rob Barker.  Pursuant
     to Article 6, ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION, the President, Don
     Daniels; the four elected Directors; the non-voting Vice
     President and Vice President - Technical Coordinator constitute
     the Executive Committee.

     Upon motion of Ben Baker, duly adopted, the Board Meeting was
     recessed to allow the newly constituted Executive Committee to
     consider and report to the Board on the matter referred by the
     Board for immediate attention earlier, relating to Agenda Item
     II. E., portion up to the semi-colon - specifically changes to
     the Copyright Notice and NOTICE language in the present NodeList.

     (See: Separate Minutes of the Executive Committee Meeting, August
     23, 1987, Enclosure to these Minutes below.)

     Upon the return of the Executive Committee, the Chair reconvened
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 13                  31 Aug 1987


     the Meeting and heard the Report of the Executive Committee. The
     Secretary read the language recommended by the Executive
     Committee and explained the effect of the changes.  Basically,
     the previous language prohibited any commercial use of any kind
     of the NodeList by anyone.  As there have been and are numerous
     such uses by listed nodes to conduct "commercial business", the
     Executive Committee's new language licenses listed nodes to use
     the NodeList only in the technical operation of their nodes.
     All other commercial uses of the NodeList continue to be
     prohibited.  The more general issues of Licensing "commercial
     use" of IFNA properties, also referenced to the Executive
     Committee are postponed until a chance has been had for
     contributions to the discussions by the FidoNet Community and
     until the Executive committee may consider this critically
     important matter in an atmosphere less constrained by time.

     In the discussion that followed, Thom Henderson and others, made
     a plea for much more "English" and simpler NOTICE  language that
     Sysops could easily understand.  In particular, Thom Henderson
     felt that a Sysop should not have to get his attorney's opinion
     before deciding that a proposed use is licensed or not.  In
     rebuttal, Tom Marshall defended attorney's fees in general, and
     particularly pointed out that the language is necessarily
     "legalese" because its sets forth a line between licensed uses
     of the NodeList and unlicensed uses.  If a proposed use is
     questionable, any commercial user should realize that the
     consequences of a Copyright Infringement are serious enough to
     retain a competent attorney before jeopardizing a business.

     After further discussion the Board adopted the Executive
     Committee's Report and the changes to the NodeList NOTICE
     language that Committee suggested.

     (For the text of the "new" language adopted by the Board in
     accepting the Report of the Executive Committee, See:
     NodeList.240, published August 28, 1987.)

     Agenda Item II. F. - Selection of the dates for the next Annual
     Meeting of the Members and reference of details to the
     Membership Services Committee.  There was some discussion of
     this Item, but the sense of the Board was there was not enough
     data on which to arrive at any decision.  Accordingly, on motion
     duly adopted, the Board referred this entire Item to the
     Membership Services Committee for review; solicitation of
     suggestions by Members, Sysops and any others interested; and
     required that the Committee report dates and suggested sites to
     the Board within ninety days.  Thus, the Membership Services
     Committees report on arrangements for next year's Annual Meeting
     of Members is due on or before November 20, 1987.

     Upon being reminded that the terms of the At-Large Directors is
     not specified in the By-Laws for this first elected Board, an
     additional Agenda Item was placed before the Board, by consensus.
     Those At-Large Directors present were polled to see if enough
     were willing to accept a one-year term, with three indicating
     they would do so.  However, as consent of the number required
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 14                  31 Aug 1987


     for half of this first elected Board's At-Large  to hold that
     position for one year was not available, this Board referred the
     matter to the Nominations and Elections Committee for resolution
     and report to the Board.  In view of the volunteering by three
     of those present to serve the on year term, it is not
     anticipated that resolution should require much effort.

     Agenda Item II. G. - Adjournment of the Annual Meeting of the
     Members and the Meeting of the Board of Directors.  No decision
     having been reached about next year's Annual Meeting of the
     Members dates, the Annual Meeting of the Members was adjourned
     until the time selected by the Board upon considering the
     recommendations of the Membership Services Committee.  There
     being no further business to come before the Board, on motion to
     adjourn, pending call by the Chair, the motion was adopted and
     at 1536 the Board of Directors Meeting was adjourned.

     Respectfully submitted,

     Tom Marshall, IFNA Secretary

     Tom Marshall, Esq.
     107/524

     As  I  was  completing  DRAFTs  of  the  three Board of Directors
     Meetings and on Executive Committee,  a number  of  "impressions"
     kept  floating  up  that  I  felt  should not be a part of formal
     Minutes of Meetings.  Also,  two (and  probably  lots  of  other)
     details  are  "of  record"  but  are  not  included in any of the
     Minutes.

     First, the well-intentioned, serious - but mostly light-hearted -
     fellows and gals I met at 4FIDOCON are definitely  NOT  the  same
     crowd that attended last year's Conference.  I wasn't there,  but
     I've read lots and listened to lots of  tales  about  disruptive,
     abusive and downright disagreeable persons who did attend, that I
     had  formed  a  conclusion  that  this  was  likely  to  be a bad
     experience.

     Nothing could be further from the truth.  I certainly did not get
     to meet or "be with" many  who  were  there.  But  to  a  person,
     everyone  I  did meet,  was with and who participated in the same
     activities I did was patently eager to  be  constructive.  I  did
     not witness, nor have I heard of one incident that I could in any
     classify as mean-spirited or destructive.  Maybe the people I did
     meet  and engage in conversation were just the "nice guys".  I am
     firm in my conviction that that did not happen.

     The lasting impression I have is that  "we",  those  present  and
     those not,  who are this incredible FidoNet Community can be very
     proud of our accomplishments and can count on the continued  hard
     work  of  all to build an even more important Net for the good of
     all who we  contact.  To  Tom  Jennings,  who  isn't  necessarily
     pleased  with  "how"  his  baby is growing up,  thank you so very
     much.  To Thom Henderson,  who stepped aside for reasons he  will
     explain,  I'll  miss your counsel and wit in the "inner circles".
     To all of the nay-sayers who could not or chose  not  to  attend,
     you  missed  a  delightful experience that might have given you a
     different impression.

     The two "items of record" you won't find in the Minutes are:

      1. A written note by Hal DuPrie:  clearly stating for the record
         his  reasoning  for voting against submission of the NodeList
         NOTICE changes to the Executive Committee.  Herewith is Hal's
         "for the record" submission:

              "for 'reading into the record'
              Section -- Vote on 'copyright'

              I voted NO on modifying the  copyright  notice  since  I
              believe that the statement made by counsel 'Copyright is
              retained/created   at   creation  of  document...',   is
              sufficient to allow  REMOVAL  not  modification  of  the
              copyright statement form the nodelist until such time as
              IFNA   wishes   to   re-instate  it  with  the  members'
              approval."
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 17                  31 Aug 1987


              Signed: HAL DuPRIE, Director At-Large;
              Marked received 8/23/87 1:10PM from H.duP. TMM

         As a guide to anyone else who feels the need to make anything
         "of record", be you Director or not:  my archivist chore (and
         "pack-rat"  propensities)  are  such that I'll file it if you
         send it to me and indicate you want to "go on record".  I may
         or may not do anything else  with  "it",  but  you  can  rest
         assured you will be "on record".

      2. Before  the  start  of the last Session of the Third Board of
         Directors Meeting on Sunday, there was an "off-record" baring
         by all of the Directors,  Alternates and Officers of anything
         they felt anyone could criticize as constituting a "conflict-
         of-interest".  When  the  Substitute for Article 11 was being
         discussed during the Second Board Meeting,  all of us  agreed
         to  make  a  full  disclosure  of  any  possible conflict-of-
         interest,  as soon as  that  Article  was  adopted,  that  is
         required  by that Article's text.  In listening to that group
         "bare their individual souls",  I felt  a  growing  sense  of
         pride in IFNA because of the spirit with which each displayed
         their feelings on this sensitive matter.

     So it is "of record" here is basically what I said: I am a Patent
     Attorney,  specializing  in  Computers/Software/Systems.  That is
     how I earn my living.  As an attorney for nearly 32 years, I find
     the concept of  advertising  my  services  distasteful,  but  the
     realities of today, and the concept of my practice being "On-Line
     Real-Time"  require me to let potential clients know who I am and
     what my qualifications are.  I am counting on my participation in
     FidoNet and in IFNA as Secretary and IFNA Legal,  to get my name,
     "who"  I am and what my qualifications are "out there".  I expect
     that many of my clients will know me because  of  my  connections
     and  service  to  this  organization.  I  DO  use the NodeList to
     contact directly my clients and for  my  clients  to  contact  me
     directly.  And  I  am  Commercial  Use Licensee #1!  I've paid my
     $100 Commercial Member Dues and donated  my  fair  share  of  the
     expenses  to  4FIDOCON.  My  opinion  is  that  there  is  now no
     conflict-of-interest,  nor is it likely that there ever  will  be
     any.

     Lastly,  "for  the record" one last thought - I think I had a lot
     of "fun" at 4FIDOCON.  When I recover form the exhaustion of  the
     whole affair,  I'll find out.  For sure two remarks made stick in
     my mind as being very appropos - Bob Hartman said in an  EchoMail
     message  before the Conference and repeated the same theme at the
     Conference:  Up until the Conference we were organizing for a new
     beginning,  now  all  we  can do is push the start button and see
     what happens.  He is SO RIGHT.  Then when the  (still  in  shock)
     new  President  finished  his  speech at the Saturday Luncheon he
     said: "Don't tell us what we're doing wrong, tell us how to do it
     right!"

     The start button has been pushed and it is entirely probable "we"
     didn't do it right the first attempt.  But there is in place  and
     now  running  the  ways  and  means  to  patch the bugs and "our"
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 18                  31 Aug 1987


     representatives are there to find out from us how we think it can
     be done right.

     Now that all the work is done, I'm going to have some "fun"!

     The following is a copy of a letter sent by Thom Henderson to the
     Chairmain of the Board of Directors of IFNA:



     25 August 1987

     Ken Kaplan, Chairman
     International FidoNet Association


     Dear Ken:

     First, I would like to appoint Rick Siegel, 107/27 as my
     Alternate for the IFNA Board of Directors.

     Second, I regret to inform you that I must tender my resignation
     as a member of the IFNA Board of Directors.  I interprete Article
     11 of the Articles of Association, as passed by the membership in
     January of 1987, as indicating that I cannot hold a seat on the
     Board.  I know that Article 11 was suspended prior to the
     election, but my conscience demands that I apply it to myself.


     Sincerely,



     Thom Henderson

     This article was originally intended as a paper to  be  delivered
     at  FidoCon.  Unfortunately,  it was not received in time,  so we
     are publishing it here instead.


                        FIDONET IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC
                         (or is it Western Pacific)
                                   ZONE 3

     Whilst FidoNet was created and evolved largely in the U.S.  where
     the  Network  and  its environment largely adapted to each other,
     the growth of FidoNet in other  parts  of  the  world  has  posed
     different sets of problems....  none more unique than those found
     on the continent of  Australia,  the  western  pacific  area  and
     south-east Asia.

     In this area,  known of late as Zone-3,  there have been problems
     arising from the relatively small number of nodes spread  over  a
     huge area of the earth's surface, literally hundreds of different
     languages,  remoteness  from  the  U.S.  as  the  major centre of
     FidoNet development and even from Europe  and  the  necessity  to
     service and accomodate the rapid growth of the Net.

     That all these problems have, to a large extent, been overcome or
     are  in  the  process  of  being  solved,  is  a  credit  to  the
     flexibility and adaptibility of the Networking concept itself and
     to the administrators on both sides of the Pacific.

     The purpose of this contribution from Zone-3 is  to  tell  you  a
     little about how the Zone is structured and to point out where we
     have overcome some of the problems that have arisen.

     The  first  networked  Fido Boards in the Region were operated in
     Indonesia.  Indeed,  the first mail sent outside the  continental
     United States was sent between Indonesia and the U.S.

     However,  the Indonesian Boards were not the active participators
     they have become today and the Western  Pacific  area  languished
     until  a  couple of Boards were brought up in Australia as a part
     of Region 12...  based in Hawaii.  In  fact,  the  whole  of  the
     Australian  continent must have been the largest net that FidoNet
     ever saw....  or,  is ever likely to see again.  With an area the
     size  of  the  U.S.  (excluding Alaska) the country was served by
     Net-155.

     As Net-155 grew and,  even with substantial hubbing arrangements,
     became unwieldy , it was decided to create Region-3 with a couple
     of  Regions beneath it...  Region-50 to cover mainland Australia,
     Region-52  to  cover  Indonesia  and  Region-59   to   accomodate
     independent nodes.

     With the introduction of the Zone philosophy, of course, Region-3
     became Zone-3.


     As  it  stands  today  Zone-3  accomodates six Regions,  with one
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 21                  31 Aug 1987


     pending and allowanc e for an eighth.  The Zonegate is owned  and
     operated  by Alwyn Smith and is based at Scarborough on the coast
     of Queensland near the New South Wales border. Mainland Australia
     is covered by Region-50  with  John  Blackett-Smith  as  Regional
     Coordinator based in Melbourne,  the most southern mainland city.
     Region-50 contains Net-620 in Sydney,  Net-626 in  Canberra  (the
     national capital), Net-630 and Net-631 serving Melbourne, Geelong
     and Tasmania, Net-640 in Queensland, Net-680 in Adelaide and Net-
     690 in Perth.  It is believed that Net-640 is the largest net (by
     area) in the international Fido Network being spread over a  1200
     mile strip along the east coast and containing only 6 nodes.

     Region-54,   covers   Papua-New  Guinea  with  Net-710  and  some
     Australian Nets - 711,  712 and 713 - and is coordinated by Geoff
     Smith from Port Moresby, the capital city of PNG.

     Region-51  covers  Singapore with Net-600,  Malaysia with Net-609
     and Thailand with  Net-608...  three  small  countries  in  close
     proximity  in  the  same  geographical region but culturally very
     different.....

     Region-52 is Indonesia covering two nets - 131 and 611.

     Region-53 covers Hong Kong and contains Net-164  which  may  soon
     change to Net-700.

     Region-55  is  the Japanese region.  Whilst there have been Fido-
     type boards running in Japan for some time now,  it  is  expected
     that  they  will be joining the international network in the very
     near future.

     Allowance has been made  for  the  inevitable  inclusion  of  New
     Zealand  with  Region-56  and  finally,  Region-59 was created to
     accomodate those nodes who,  for  a  variety  of  reasons  either
     didn't  fit  into the existing structures or,  elected to operate
     independently.  At the moment this Region,  coordinated by  Geoff
     Arthur from Sydney, contains only 3 nodes.

     Because of the distances, differences in time zones, difficulties
     with  satellite links across the Pacific as well as the multitude
     of languages involved,  a great deal of planning and thought  has
     gone  into  the  mail  routing  throughout the Zone,  and it goes
     something like this....

     The Zonegate handles all incoming and outgoing mail for the  Zone
     as  well as well as passing EchoMail and Netmail through from the
     U.S. to Europe and return.

     The  Zonegate  distributes  NetMail  and  any  required  EchoMail
     conferences to Region-50 via 630/301 in Melbourne which,  in turn
     distributes to Nets 631, 626, 680 and 690 as well as nodes within
     Net-630.  The remaining nets in  Region-50...  620  and  640  are
     served direct by the Zonegate.

     The  link to Region-52 in Indonesia and Region-53 in Hong Kong is
     direct to and from the Zonegate.
     FidoNews 4-33                Page 22                  31 Aug 1987


     In Region-54,  the other large Region  in  Zone-3,  all  mail  is
     routed  to 711/403 which,  in turn distributes to the other nodes
     in his Net as well as to mail servers in Nets 710, 712 and 713.

     A special gateway operates between  Regions  54  and  51  and  is
     provided  by 711/805 which is owned and operated by Andrew Khoo a
     SysOp  of  Chinese  extraction.  This  has  helped  overcome  the
     language problems between the two areas.

     It should be noted here that the operator of the Zone-3 Zonegate,
     Alwyn Smith,  provides free local, international and echomail for
     the entire zone.

     The system works quite smoothly,  depite the unpredictable nature
     of  the  satellite  links between Australia and the U.S.  and the
     varying sizes of the incoming mail packets...  varying,  that is,
     from  large  to  gargantuan,  and  the  large  distances  between
     centres.... particularly on mainland Australia.

     That  it  IS  successful  is  evidenced  by  the  steady   growth
     throughout  the entire zone...  Australia is fast approaching its
     hundredth node,  Thailand  and  Malaysia  are  adding  new  nodes
     currently  and  Indonesia  recently added several new nodes.  The
     only area yet to be penetrated by FidoNet is New Zealand..... but
     even they will be hard put to resist once their very  restrictive
     regulatory problems are solved.

     We  hope this gives you all some idea of the nature of Zone-3 and
     its structure..... and that we can expect to continue the already
     enjoyable dialogue with Zones 1 and 2  along  with  the  echomail
     conferences  which have done so much to enhance this uniques area
     of computer communications.
