   There are several excellent articles in this snooze.  I was
thinking tonight that not only are we getting some excellent
articles as submissions to the snooze, but I have been reading
some excellent posts lately.

   I think we should have a contest ... best post of the year,
and best snooze article of the year.  To start it off, I will
propose the following rules, and kick in two $100 (Can.) prizes,
one for best post of the year, and one for best snooze article.
Any post or article can be noninated by any one that reads it,
and can be forwarded here.

   If we have more than 10 nominations in eithor catagory, we
will narrow it down to 10, and decide the final winners by
vote, all snooze readers being elegible to vote.  I'll figure
out just how to do that over the next few weeks <S>.

   Here is the snooze.

My now weekly submission to Fidonews:
From: Ari Pollak (1:107/302)

Subject:World Wide Web browsers (Part 2)

      In Part one if "World Wide Web Browsers", I mentioned many
different browsers.  I will only review one more, since it is not likely
that you will want to get any other browser.  Most other broswers only
support the first version of HTML, the WWW programming language.

      UPDATE ON MOSAIC 2.0:  At the moment, programmers at NCSA
are working on the final release of Mosaic 2.0.  There are very few bugs
left, and according to one of the programmers, the final release should be
out in around a month or so.
Again, you may FTP it from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/Mosaic.

      Netscape: The best (at the moment) is now even better.
Version 1.1 was just recently released.  I won't describe it, because you
should try it out yourself. FTP from ftp.netscape.com/Netscape, or if that
doesn't work, try ftp2.netscape.com/Netscape. Or for a list of sites, HTTP
to: home.netscape.com

      If you have an idea about an article I can write, something
that would be of interest to the general public, or about a problem that
many people should know about, just e-mail me at:

questions answered

Proposed VModem Nodelist Flag
Proposed VModem Nodelist Flag
by Bob Quinlan, 1:143/240 (bquinlan@october.com)

VModem is an OS/2 utility that is part of Ray Gwinn's SIO serial port
driver package.  VModem creates virtual modem ports that act just like a
conventional serial port connected to a modem.  Any application that
will work with a normal serial port, such as a BBS program or mail
handler, will also work with VModem.  The difference is that these
virtual modems use the Internet to carry the "call".  That means no long
distance charges.

To use VModem your local machine must be on the Internet.  Either a
direct network connection or a dial-up SLIP/PPP link will work.  The
machine that is "calling" you must also be on the Internet and must use
Vmodem, or the widely supported telnet protocol, to communicate with
you.

I will not go into details of how VModem initiates and answers calls.
The important point here is that *any* program that can talk to a serial
port will work with it.  If you set up your existing BBS software on a
virtual modem port anyone with full access to the Internet can "call"
your system from anywhere in the world...at no cost.

What works for user-to-BBS communication also works for BBS-to-BBS
communication.  Netmail and echomail can be exchanged over the Internet
using the same mail handling software that we all use now.  Some of us
are already doing it.

At this point all VModem mail links have to be arranged and configured
manually.  What is needed is a way to locate other VModem-capable
Fidonet nodes and configure for contact with them.  These requirements
imply something very much like our current Nodelist.

I propose that the best solution is to add the necessary information to
our existing nodelist as a new flag.  Any system capable of receiving
VModem-type "calls" should include a flag beginning with the letters VM
immediately followed by the system's Internet name or IP address.  For
example, my system's new flag would be "VMoctober.com".  The SIO Support
system's would be "VM199.248.240.2".

Nodes which are accessible only through VModem should be listed as
Private, but with an appropriate VM flag entry.  My first thought was to
substitute the Internet address for the phone number in those cases.  It
was pointed out to me that several nodelist compilers would break if bad
values were put into the phone number field.

Until the VM flag is formally accepted it should only be included as a
user flag.  Even so, if we use it consistently it will become possible
to automate Internet "calling" in the same ways we automate regular
calling.  New nodelist compilers can be developed that, when requested,
will extract the address from a VM flag and substitute it for a phone
number.  Existing compilers could use the VM flag to set a new modem
type for such nodes.
FidoNews 12-22                 Page:  4                    29 May 1995


Now allow me to qualify a couple of side issues.

First, I realize that there are already utilities other than VModem
provide similar capabilities via the telnet protocol.  Any system using
such a utility should use the same VM flag and format.  As long as all
systems using the VM flag can communicate with each other over the
Internet it does not matter what utilities are actually used.

Second, I realize that there are almost always some costs associated
with getting access to the Internet.  In some cases it may even be more
expensive to connect to other nodes through the Internet than with a
conventional dial-up.  My point is that in most cases VModem provides a
low-cost or flat-fee alternative to toll calling.

Does my proposal overlook any potential problems?  Do you have a better
suggestion for how to handle this?  I would be interested in hearing
about either.  In the meantime, I would encourage everyone with a
VModem-capable Fidonet node to add the VM flag and address to your
nodelist entry as a user flag.

DiDoNeT

Hi everyone!

A couple months (February to be exact)ago I put in an a little article/ad
about my net, DiDoNeT, which was real puny then, and had only 5 BBSes,
which I thought was pretty good...well, now I have 27 BBSes in my net and
its doing a lot better :) Please read the following little text file I
made, and if you like the look of my net, and would like to join you can
get the latest Application Package by F'REQing DIDOAPP from me, (1:250/607)

here's the file:

                    DidoNet - Important Information
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                            Introduction
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Hi there.  This is Greg Peterson (Lucifer) - Net Coordinator of
DidoNet.  I'm going to tell you a little bit about DidoNet, it's goals,
and what it's all about.
                               Goals
                               ~~~~~
        DidoNet is a relatively small net, compared to FidoNet, TNC, and
other big international nets, but I think the environment is more "social"
and friendly.  The ultimate goal of DidoNet is to let all the sysops and
users in the net have FUN! There is a good constant flow of messages
everyday with an average of about 20 messages in the general base alone
per day, with other bases that also do well.
                              Statistics
                              ~~~~~~~~~~
        Now, a few statistics about the net.  There are currently
(as of 05/14/95), 25 BBSes in the net, all in Metro Toronto, with the
FidoNews 12-22                 Page:  5                    29 May 1995

exception of Deep Blue Shadows BBS in Indiana, and The Universal Joint
in Kenora, Ontario.  Soon there will also be a BBS in Salt Spring Island,
British Columbia.  Hopefully with these long distance hubs, other long
distance sysops will follow them, and join one of the fastest growing
Nets based in Toronto.
                             Message Flow
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        There is an average of about 20 messages per day in the general
base of the net. That's nothing of course, compared to nets like FidoNet
and UseNet (Which may I remind you is part of the InterNet).  But all the
messages are fun to read and reply to! Also, the nets free, so what can
you lose?
                            InterBBS Games
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Now I'll tell you about a fun and entertaining reason to join
DidoNet: InterBBS Games!  There are currently TWO InterBBS Games.
They are BRE and LORD! In BRE there are 9 BBSes. In LORD there are 5
BBSes, but that just started yesterday and that will go up as the net
grows. In BRE we use version 0.971. In LORD you must use 3.25+ and it must
be REGISTERED! You also need special software for InterBBS LORD, it is
called LORDNet, and the zip is called LNET###.ZIP. If you want to start
another type of InterBBS game, such as ArrowBridge, etc. please contact
me, and I'll set it up ASAP, or I may put you in charge of it.
                          Message Base Rules
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The next thing and a very important topic that you may be
wondering about with suspense is posting rules.  In DidoNet there are
very few rules for the message bases.  The main rule is: NO FLAMING!!!
If I catch anyone "flaming" another user on the net (Unless the victim
of the flame really had it coming) You will be suspended from the net,
and may not post in it for a while, (how long depends on how mad I am at
you and how annoying your message was).  Next rule: Do NOT post the same
message more than once!  Unless there was a technical error in scanning
the message bases and created dupe messages.  There will be a punishment
for posting multiple identical messages, because even though you may have
a chuckle out of it, you're costing the long distance hubs who have to
call and pick up the mail a fair bit of money.  Other than that I don't
think there are any other rules I have to run by you, just overall, don't
be a nuisance in the message bases.  And yes, you're allowed to swear in
the message bases, but if you're swearing in every sentence of every
message you post, that's where I draw the line... I think anyone who can
call a BBS can handle a few "Bad words", oh and I don't want to see any
racist, sexist, or any other "ist" messages that could possibly offend
another user, you will be punished SEVERELY! (This means no homophobic
messages too...)
                           Routed NetMail
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        OK, now to the subject of netmail.  You may route netmail through
your hub, please, keep it to a minimum, and please, no UUENCODE'd files.
This costs hubs lots of money...If you need to send a file long distance,
call yourself.

        I think I've covered pretty much everything...

        Please consider joining DidoNet!

An Alien Looks at FidoNet

by Lisa Gronke, 1:105/6
lisa@psg.com

POLICY4 says the official language of FidoNet is English. POLICY4 is
wrong. The official language of FidoNet is the Type 2 (or Type 2+)
Packet. The *.PKT is the data structure that is transferred over
FidoNet. Often the *.PKT files are transferred inside archived mail
bundles with names like 0000FFDC.WE2.

The *.PKT has the following structure:
-- a Packet Header (58 bytes)
-- zero or more Packed Messages
-- a Pseudo-message 00 00 (2 bytes) ends the packet
So an empty packet (no packed messages) is 60 bytes.

Each Packed Message has the following structure:
-- packed message header
   -- starts with 02 00 (message type) (2 bytes)
   -- 6 fixed length fields (2 bytes each)
   -- 1 fixed length, null terminated string (20 bytes)
   -- 3 variable length, null terminated strings (max 144 bytes)
-- message text, null terminated (unbounded)

All of the control information that makes echomail messages
different from netmail messages is considered part of the message
text as far as *.PKT structure is concerned. Usually a *.PKT will
contain netmail or echomail, but not both. Echomail "message text"
starts with an AREA:ECHOTAG line and ends with the Origin, SEEN-BY
and ^aPATH: lines.

If you're past the stage of total FidoNet bewilderment, 'tis time to
snag a couple of *.PKT files and take a look at them. Use a tool
like Vernon Buerg's LIST (or newer versions of 4DOS LIST) with hex
capability. Gurus use David Nugent's INSPECTA. Aliens with Apple IIs
use their sector editor <g>.

Where to look? In your inbound area if you can grab a copy of the
incoming files before your mail processor does. Or in your outbound
area(s). Specific tips follow.

But first a word about file names. An "archived mail bundle" is a
file that contains one or more *.PKT files, archived with ARC, ZIP,
ARJ, LZH, LHA, PAK, ZOO, RAR etc. Bundles to/from strangers are
FidoNews 12-22                 Page:  7                    29 May 1995

supposed to be archived with ARC (but sometimes aren't). Hubs and
other regular callers usually will have made arrangements with you
to use an archiver with better compression.

ARCmail (used as a generic term for ARC|ZIP|ARJ|ETCmail) bundles
have "standard" names of the form nnnnmmmm.dd#, where nnnn is
(orignet minus destnet) in hex, mmmm is (orignode minus destnode) in
hex (2's compliment for negative numbers), dd is a day of the week
in the form MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, or SU, and # is a decimal digit.

BinkleyTerm: Outbound
---------------------
BinkleyTerm is just a mailer (does no mail processing), but is used
with mail processors like QM or Squish which usually archive both
netmail and echomail. Outbound mail bundles (for MyZone 1) are found
in the c:\bink\outbound subdirectory. Here is a sample from 1:105/6.

   c:\bink\outbound\0069002a.flo
   c:\bink\outbound\0000ffdc.Mo0

0069002a.flo is a control file that references the mail bundle. The
destination information is in the file name; 0069 (hex) means Net
105, 002a (hex) means Node 42, and .flo means normal mail.

This 0069002a.flo file contains one line. It could reference
additional mail bundles and/or other files (# indicates that the
 *.Mo0 file should be truncated after it is sent).
#Outbound\0000ffdc.Mo0

The ARCmail bundle has the standard name:
 onet  [Net 105] minus dnet  [Net 105] ==   0 (dec) == 0000 (hex)
 onode [Node 6]  minus dnode [Node 42] == -36 (dec) == ffdc (hex)

Bink can also send *.PKT files. They are stored in the same
subdirectory, but are not stored with *.PKT file names. Instead, a
packet for 1:105/42 would have a name like 0069002a.OUT
[NetNode.?UT], which is changed to a *.PKT name, on the fly, when it
is transmitted.

BinkleyTerm sysops should not have any trouble finding *.PKTs to
examine.

FrontDoor: Packets & Archives
-----------------------------
The FrontDoor software package contains a message reader/editor
[FM], a nodelist compiler [FDNC] and the mailer/router/packer. FD
can pack netmail messages into *.PKT files. FD cannot archive *.PKTs
into ARCmail bundles. It can toss incoming netmail if it arrives in
 *.PKT form, but cannot decompress ARCmail bundles.

FD puts outbound *.PKT files in the subdirectory (folder) specified
in..
FDSETUP: Global -> Filenames -> Packets ..... (say) c:\fd\packets

The packets folder is dynamic. *.PKT files are built and deleted
FidoNews 12-22                 Page:  8                    29 May 1995

frequently. If you exit FD, you will not find anything in the
c:\fd\packets folder. In order to find files in the folder, you have
to shell out of FD.

I entered netmail Message #6 addressed to 1:105/6 using FM, ran my
friend's runfd.bat, watched as FD said "Processing netmail folder"
and "Preparing outbound mail" and then shelled out of FD with ALT-Z.
I found two files.

     c:\fd\packets\000e4ebf.fdc
     c:\fd\packets\000e4ebf.pkt

000e4ebf.pkt is the *.PKT file with my message. 000e4ebf.fdc is the
associated control file. It looked like this:

01 00 69 00 06 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 A0 3D B0 1E
01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 70 FD 36 00

The first 8 bytes are the zone, net, node and point (hex, lsb : msb
order). The 36 at the end is the ascii value for (Message #)6. When
the *.PKT is sent, FD uses this information to flag the stored
message as "Sent" (or to delete it).

Since FrontDoor does not 'do' echos, the sysop needs to use a
separate echomail tosser. Leonard Erickson uses QECHO. Qecho.ctl
asks for an "Archive path." That is where you will find outbound
archived mail bundles containing echomail. Other tossers will have
something similar.

I entered an echomail message in the NET105 echo on Leonard
Erickson's system [1:105/51]. After processing, there was a mail
bundle for his HUB [1:105/31] in his c:\qecho\out directory named
00000014.TU2. Inside the mail bundle was a file named 16143322.PKT.

There also was a 60 byte (empty) 000e4ec0.pkt in c:\fd\packets and
an associated 000e4ec0.fdc control file showing a packet going to
1:105/31.0 referencing the full file spec of the ARCmail bundle.

Novice FrontDoor sysops may not realize that messages are turned
into *.PKT files before they are sent, since it "looks like"
FrontDoor is sending the stored message directly from the netmail
folder.

I have not seen InterMail, but I would expect an organization pretty
much like FrontDoor. The control files are named *.IMC.

D'Bridge: Temporary & Outbound Queues
-------------------------------------
D'Bridge is an integrated software package. It reads/edits messages
with DBEDIT, compiles the nodelist, and processes both netmail and
echomail.

The overall organization is similar to FrontDoor, but D'Bridge uses
a base 36 file naming scheme in both packet and bundle outbound

areas.
       C-00102X.006
                ^^^ ----Node 6
            ^^^ ----Net 105 [(0 x 1296) + (2 x 36) + X=33] = 105
         ^^^ ----Zone 1
       ^ ---- type of packet or bundle (C = Crash)

File names are changed to standard *.PKT or *.DD? ARCmail names, on
the fly, when they are sent.

D'Bridge sends *.PKT netmail by default. Outbound packets are built
in the "Temporary queue" directory ..... (say) c:\db\packets.

I entered a netmail message to 1:105/6 with DBEDIT, exited the
editor, watched as D'Bridge said "Building the outbound queue" --
then DROPped to DOS and looked at the packets subdirectory. I found:

     c:\db\packets\c-00102x.006
     c:\db\packets\q-00102x.006

C-00102x.006 was the *.PKT file with my message. Q-00102x.006 is the
associated control file.

ARC|ZIP|ETCmail bundles are found in the "Outbound queue" directory
..... (say) c:\db\queue. They may be echomail or optional compressed
netmail (XMail), and use the same base 36 file naming scheme. I
think there is an associated q-*.* control file in the same
subdirectory.

Next week
---------
Now that you've found some *.PKT files and maybe played around
making some new ones, don't be shy! Look inside. Read the message
text? Does the packet contain netmail or echomail?

Next week I'll tell you a little more about reading the packet
header and the packed message header.
