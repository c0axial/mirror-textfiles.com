     Yet another email from Zone 2 telling me they've either:

      1. never heard of FidoNews;

     or

      2. don't get FidoNews in their Net/Region.

     Isolated incidents? Probably, since the reports are not at flood level
     so far. But, of course, if FidoNews is unknown out there, who is going
     to know to comment or complain? The last reporter only found FidoNews
     during an Infoseek search on the Internet.

     I know it gets to ZC2 but what about you Zone 2 RCs? Are you moving
     FidoNews out there? Zone 2 NCs? YooHoo.

     P4 sez FidoNews is part of the glue that holds us together but glue
     doesn't work unless you spread it on all the parts you want to stick.

     ZCs, RCs, and NCs can send Netmail to me at 1:18/14 or 1:1/23 or email
     to cbaker84@digital.net and let me know how many times they send out
     FidoNews to their constituents, if they'd like to help sort out the
     black holes of FidoNews distribution.

     Otherwise, the news continues. [grin]

                      A new ACLU/EPIC website

                    Take the First Amendment Pledge


     As we all await a Supreme Court decision on the future of free speech
     on the Internet, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic
     Privacy Information Center launched www.firstamendment.org, a website
     dedicated to upholding the First Amendment in cyberspace.

     The groups called on President Clinton and members of Congress to be
     among the first to "Take the First Amendment Pledge" and cease any
     further attempts to draft legislation to censor the Internet in the
     event the Supreme Court upholds a lower court decision striking down
     government regulation of the Internet as unconstitutional.

     The launch of the website comes as Clinton Administration officials
     have begun publicly discussing a shift in policy on Internet
     regulation, saying that "industry self-regulation" -- not laws
     criminalizing certain Internet communications -- is the solution to
     shielding minors from online "indecency."

     "Attempts to censor the Net will not end with the Supreme Court
     decision," said David Sobel, legal counsel for EPIC and co-counsel in
     Reno v. ACLU.  "Proponents of Internet content regulation have already
     indicated their desire to take a 'second bite of the apple' if the
     Communications Decency Act is struck down."

     In anticipation of such new attempts at online censorship, visitors to
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 3                   23 Jun 1997


     www.firstamendment.org are invited to "Take the First Amendment
     Pledge," which reads: "I pledge to support free speech and free
     expression for all Americans and to urge Congress to uphold the First
     Amendment to the United States Constitution and pass no law abridging
     our  freedom of speech."

     People taking the pledge are encouraged to place the "First Amendment
     Pledge" GIF their own websites.

     Day of Decision Events

     As the countdown continues to a Supreme Court ruling in Reno v. ACLU,
     the first-ever case to look at how free speech principles are applied
     to the Internet, the American Civil Liberties Union is preparing to go
     live on the World Wide Web with a cybercast news  conference on the
     day a decision is reached.

     Day of Decision Schedule

     1:00 p.m.(E.D.T.) Press Conference and Cybercast

     At the ACLU's new national offices at 125 Broad Street in lower
     Manhattan.  Reno v. ACLU attorneys, co-counsel and plaintiffs will
     participate. The live cybercast can be accessed through the ACLU's
     website, http://www.aclu.org, and directly through Pathfinder's Netly
     News at http://www.pathfinder.com/news/netdecency.

     7:00 p.m. (E.D.T.) Live Chat with ACLU Attorneys

     A one-hour chat with ACLU attorneys is planned on ECHO.

     Instructions:
     ECHO chats are open to anyone with Internet access.
     Telnet to echonyc.com, or  dial 212-292-0910 with your modem.
     Login as echolive, and communicate directly with the Attorneys.

     Reno v. ACLU challenges censorship provisions of the Communications
     Decency Act aimed at protecting minors by criminalizing so-called
     "indecency" on the Internet. The government appealed the case to the
     Supreme Court after a federal three-judge panel ruled unanimously last
     June that the law unconstitutionally restricts free speech. The ACLU
     filed a challenge to the law the day it was enacted.

     Setback in Efforts to Secure Online Privacy

          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          Thursday, June 19, 1997

     WASHINGTON -- A Senate committee today setback legislative efforts to
     secure online privacy, approving legislation that would restrict the
     right of businesses and individuals both to use encryption
     domestically and to export it.

          On a voice vote, the Senate Commerce Committee adopted
     legislation that essentially reflects the Clinton Administration's
     anti-encryption policies.

          The legislation approved today on a voice vote by the Senate
     Commerce Committee was introduced this week by Senate Commerce
     Committee Chairman John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and co-
     sponsored by Democrats Fritz Hollings of South Carolina; Robert Kerry
     of Nebraska and John Kerry of Massachusetts.

          Encryption programs scramble information so that it can only be
     read with a "key" -- a code the recipient uses to unlock the scrambled
     electronic data.  Programs that use more than 40 bits of data to
     encode information are considered "strong" encryption. Currently,
     unless these keys are made available to the government, the Clinton
     Administration bans export of hardware or software containing strong
     encryption, treating these products as "munitions."

          Privacy advocates continue to criticize the Administration's
     stance, saying that the anti-cryptography ban has considerably
     weakened U.S. participation in the global marketplace, in addition
     to curtailing freedom of speech by denying users the right to "speak"
     using encryption. The ban also violates the right to privacy by
     limiting the ability to protect sensitive information in the new
     computerized world.

          Today's committee action knocked out of consideration the so-
     called "Pro-CODE" legislation, a pro-encryption bill introduced by
     Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana. Although the Burns
     legislation raised some civil liberties concerns, it would have lifted
     export controls on encryption programs and generally protected
     individual privacy.
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 5                   23 Jun 1997


          "Privacy, anonymity and security in the digital world depend on
     encryption," said Donald Haines, legislative counsel on privacy and
     cyberspace issues for the ACLU's Washington National Office. "The aim
     of the Pro-CODE bill was to allow U.S. companies to compete with
     industries abroad and lift restrictions on the fundamental right to
     free speech, the hallmark of American democracy."

          "Sadly, no one on the Commerce Committee, not even Senator Burns,
     stood up and defended the pro-privacy, pro-encryption effort," Haines
     added.

          In the House, however, strong encryption legislation that would
     add new privacy protections for millions of Internet users in this
     country and around the world has been approved by two subcommittees.

          The legislation -- H.R. 695, the "Security and Freedom Through
     Encryption Act" or SAFE -- would make stronger encryption products
     available to American citizens and users of the Internet around the
     world. It was introduced by Representative Robert W. Goodlatte,
     Republican of Virginia.

          "We continue to work toward the goal of protecting the privacy of
     all Internet users by overturning the Clinton Administration's
     unreasonable encryption policy," Haines concluded

               ACLU Wins First-Ever Challenge to a State
                  Internet Censorship Law in Georgia

          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          Friday, June 20, 1997

     ATLANTA -- As the nation awaits a Supreme Court decision on Internet
     censorship, a federal district judge here today struck down a state
     law criminalizing online anonymous speech and the use of trademarked
     logos as links on the World Wide Web.

     Ruling simultaneously in ALA v. Pataki, another ACLU challenge to
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 7                   23 Jun 1997


     state Internet regulation, a Federal District Judge in New York today
     blocked the state from enforcing its version of the federal
     Communications Decency Act (CDA).

     In ACLU v. Miller, Federal District Court Judge Marvin Shoob today
     granted the ACLU's request to enjoin Georgia's statute restricting
     free speech in cyberspace and denied the State's request to dismiss
     the suit.

          The Court agreed with the ACLU, Electronic Frontiers Georgia and
     others that the statute is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad
     because it bars online users from using pseudonyms or communicating
     anonymously over the Internet. The Act also unconstitutionally
     restricts the use of links on the World Wide Web which allows users to
     connect to other sites.

     In the Court's decision, Judge Shoob noted that Georgia's law, "sweeps
     innocent, protected speech within its scope." He went on to say that
     it, "affords prosecutors and police officers with substantial room for
     selective prosecution of persons who express minority viewpoints. . .
     .  [Moreover,] Georgia already has in place many less restrictive
     means to address fraud and misrepresentation."

     "The Court's order goes straight to the First Amendment flaws with the
     statute." said Scott McClain of Bondurant, Mixson & Elmore,
     cooperating attorneys for the ACLU. "Judge Shoob viewed the statute
     exactly as the Plaintiffs did: as a vague, overbroad, unconstitutional
     restriction on free speech and privacy on the Internet."

     "The Court recognized that anonymity is the passport for entry into
     cyberspace for many persons," said Gerald Weber, Legal Director of
     the ACLU of Georgia. "Without anonymity, victims of domestic violence,
     persons in Alcoholics Anonymous, people with AIDS and so many others
     would fear using the Internet to seek information and support."

     "We are very pleased with the Judge's decision," said Robert Costner,
     Executive Director of Electronic Frontiers Georgia. "This injunction
     clears the way for Electronics Frontier Georgia to release our
     anonymous remailer services on the Internet."

     Georgia's lawsuit was the first challenge to state cyberspace laws and
     statutes restricting privacy on the Internet.

          Today's ruling came as the nation awaits word from the U.S.
     Supreme Court in Reno v. ACLU, the ACLU's challenge to Internet
     censorship provisions of the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA).

     "Today's decisions in New York and Georgia say that, whatever limits
     the Supreme Court sets on Congress's power to regulate the Internet,
     states are prohibited from acting to censor online expression," said

             New York Judge Prohibits State Regulation of Internet

          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          Friday, June 20, 1997

     NEW YORK -- As the nation awaits a Supreme Court decision on Internet
     censorship, a federal district judge here today blocked New York State
     from enforcing its version of the federal Communications Decency Act
     (CDA).

     Ruling simultaneously in ACLU v. Miller, another ACLU challenge to
     state Internet regulation, a Federal District Judge in Georgia today
     struck down a law criminalizing online anonymous speech and the use of
     trademarked logos as links on the World Wide Web.

     In ALA v. Pataki, Federal District Judge Loretta A. Preska issued a
     preliminary injunction against the New York law, calling the Internet
     an area of commerce that should be marked off as a "national preserve"
     to protect online speakers from inconsistent laws that could "paralyze
     development of the Internet altogether."

     Judge Preska, acknowledging that the New York act was "clearly modeled
     on the CDA," did not address the First Amendment issues raised by the
     ACLU's federal challenge, saying that the Commerce Clause provides
     "fully adequate support" for the injunction and that the Supreme Court
     would address the other issues in its widely anticipated decision in
     Reno v. ACLU. (The Court's next scheduled decision days are June 23,
     25 and 26.)

     "Today's decisions in New York and Georgia say that, whatever limits
     the Supreme Court sets on Congress's power to regulate the Internet,
     states are prohibited from acting to censor online expression," said
     Ann Beeson, an ACLU national staff attorney who argued the case before
     Judge Preska and is a member of the ACLU v. Miller and Reno v. ACLU
     legal teams.

     "Taken together, these decisions send a very important and powerful
     message to legislators in the other 48 states that they should keep
     their hands off the Internet," Beeson added.

     In a carefully reasoned, 62-page opinion, Judge Preska warned of the
     extreme danger that state regulation would pose to the Internet,
     rejecting the state's argument that the statute would even be
     effective in preventing so-called "indecency" from reaching minors.
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 9                   23 Jun 1997


     Further, Judge Preska observed, the state can already protect children
     through the vigorous enforcement of existing criminal laws.

     "In many ways, this decision is more important for the business
     community than for the civil liberties community," said Chris Hansen,
     a senior ACLU attorney on the ALA v. Pataki legal team and lead
     counsel in Reno v. ACLU.  "Legislatures are just about done with their
     efforts to regulate the business of Internet 'sin,' and have begun
     turning to the business of the Internet itself. Today's decision ought
     to stop that trend in its tracks."

     Saying that the law would reduce all speech on the Internet to a level
     suitable for a six-year-old, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
     New York Civil Liberties Union, the American Library Association and
     others filed the challenge in January of this year.

     The law, which was passed by the New York legislature late last year,
     provides criminal sanctions of up to four years in jail for
     communicating so-called "indecent" words or images to a minor.

     In a courtroom hearing before Judge Preska in April, the ACLU
     presented a live Internet demonstration and testimony from plaintiffs
     who said that their speech had already been "chilled" by the threat of
     criminal prosecution.

     "This is a big win for the people of the state of New York," said
     Norman Siegel, Executive Director of the New York Civil Liberties
     Union. "Today's ruling vindicates what we have been saying all along
     to Governor Pataki and legislators, that they cannot legally prevent
     New Yorkers from engaging in uninhibited, open and robust freedom of
     expression on the Internet."

     The ALA v. Pataki plaintiffs are: the American Library Association,
     the Freedom to Read Foundation, the New York Library Association, the
     American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, Westchester
     Library System, BiblioBytes, Association of American Publishers,
     Interactive Digital Software Association, Magazine Publishers of
     America, Public Access Networks Corp. (PANIX), ECHO, NYC Net, Art on
     the Net, Peacefire and the American Civil Liberties Union.

     Michael Hertz and others of the New York firm Latham & Watkins
     provided pro-bono assistance to the ACLU and NYCLU; Michael Bamberger
     of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal in New York is also co-counsel in the
     case.  Lawyers from the ACLU are Christopher Hansen, Ann Beeson and
     Art Eisenberg, legal director of the NYCLU.

     CRC and The Nodelist

     Has anybody else had problems keeping current?  If it's not a missing
     DIFF now and then, it's CRC trouble... What is this CRC thing anyway?
     I've been trying to find out for over a year now, it's been one of
     those things that just keeps coming up now and then.  Right now my
     NODELIST.164 has an improper CRC.  The utility I use to merge the
     diffs told me so, and actually added a line at the bottom:

     ;S This Nodelist file has an improper CRC!

     The nodelist seems to be working correctly, but it bugs me to know
     something is improper about it.  I have all those FSC- and FTS- files
     that tell about fido junk, maybe they can help?  Maybe someone in the
     net knows what's going on?  Isn't anybody gonna do something? My
     Nodelist has an improper CRC!  Help!

     I like fido, and it's a good excuse to try writing small programs in
     c/c++ that can help me out.  I've been sort of working on a small
     utility that will take our local netseg and make a BBS list for the
     systems not marked HUB, HOST or with a MO flag.  Our netseg has that
     CRC number on the top line, shouldn't my program insure that the
     contents are valid before it tries to use them?

     This source will check an input file for a number at the end of the
     top line, and use that number if found to compare CRC value with the
     rest of the file. There may already be code out there to do this, if
     there is, I sure wish I'd had access to it!!  I'm very interested in
     c/c++, but don't have access to any echos dealing with fido or BBS
     programming.  There may be plenty of source code out there.

     Seems like most good software comes from Zone:2 anyway.  If anybody
     knows where there is some source code dealing specifically with
     fidonet, how about dropping me a line?

     If you need a compiled (.EXE) version, F'Req NLCRC.ZIP (35k).

     Y'know.  One of the things I've always found rather bothersome about
     the Internet is its lack of a local identity.  Sure, it's got lots of
     really spiffy stuff on it.  But it still seems rather cold and
     distant.  Even the sites that are highly personalized are somewhat
     remote.

     When was the last time you were really able to discuss local issues
     with someone on the Internet?  Can you vent your indignation about a
     city sales tax increase with someone across the country?  You could,
     but he or she won't have the same empathy as someone across the town
     would have.

     This is the great power BBSes have.  They are the Friendly
     Neighborhood Electronic Townhalls.  But the users can't come if they
     don't know you are there.

     When I was just a tad, about 8 or 9 years old, my grandfather and two
     uncles opened up a window glass store.  Most of their business came
     from contractors who called up and said "We've built a house, now we
     need windows."  But a good chunk of their business was repairing
     windows broken in storms, vandals, or the neighborhood baseball games.

     One Saturday morning, they armed my brother and me with hundreds of
     flyers.  We were to go slipping through the neighborhood, tucking
     these flyers into doors.  The flyers talked about how great the work
     of Lawrence Glass Company (In Lawrence IN) was and how inexpensive the
     rates were.  We earned a whopping 25 cents each (it's amazing how I
     can remember things like that, but can't remember how old my wife is).

     I'm sure you can see where this is going.  How many of your neighbors
     know you have a BBS?

     Crack open the Desktop Publisher and create a flyer.  It doesn't have
     to be very elaborate.  Make sure it has the name of your BBS and the
     data number (you might want to include your voice phone in case
     someone wants to ask a question before they dial in), and invite the
     neighborhood to call.  Print up a jillion of these things.

     Then put those preteens to work.  If they're like mine, they're aching
     to get outside anyway ("But there's a blizzard!"  "I don't care!  I
     wanna go out!").  And don't forget to give them a quarter for their
     efforts.

     Now, it's quite likely not every house in your neighborhood is going
     to have a computer equipped with a modem.  I think in my neighborhood
     there's an average of one computer per block.  But that's unimportant.
     What IS important is that you're getting the word out to people that
     are likely to be intrigued at the very least.

     1. They're going to be interested because it's someone they know that
     lives near them.
     2. They're going to be interested because it's so close to them, there
     may be something on the BBS that offers them some sort of local
     information.
     3.  They're going to be interested because it's something
     different.
     4.  They're going to be interested because they want to make sure you
     aren't peddling pornography. (or maybe because you are)
     5.  They're going to be interested because you had the audacity to put
     that doggone flyer in their door.

     I'm constant amazed at the numbers of small-town weeklies that exist.
     They're poorly written, sloppily edited, have messy layouts, and low
     page counts.  Thy thrive because they publish the little details of
     small-town life.  Your Friendly Neighborhood BBS can thrive in much
     the same way.

     Document: Descriptions of the "NOZIP" and "ERX<n>" nodelist flags
     Purpose: To give a system that is about to send some mail to a system
        not already defined by its operator in its configuration some idea
        about what kind of mail the mentioned destination system accepts
     Author: denis bider, ofs->FidoNet#2:380/129.0


     The NOZIP nodelist flag and its affects on the MN nodelist flag
     ======================================================================
     Generally, most FTN systems are able to receive compressed mail from
     any other FTN system. Up to now, the official compression format
     between systems has been ARC. This document, however, puts the ZIP
     format to that position.
        *  A system whose nodelist entry contains neither an "MN" and
           neither a "NOZIP" flag is assumed to support both ARC and ZIP.
        *  A system whose nodelist entry contains an "MN" flag is assumed
           not to support any compression at all.
        *  A system whose nodelist entry contains a "NOZIP" flag is assumed
           to support ARC compression, while not supporting ZIP
           compression.
        *  Both "NOZIP" and "MN" flags cannot appear in the same nodelist
           entry.  If they, by some accident, do, the system should be
           assumed not to support any mail compression.

     Since the majority of systems support ZIP compression, a flag
     indicating that this type of compression is NOT supported has is
     proposed instead of a flag indicating that this type of compression IS
     supported, the reason being to minimize the amount of changes required
     to the nodelist.

     The format of the NOZIP flag is, simply, "NOZIP".
     The format of the MN flag stays the same.

     The ERX<n> nodelist flag
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 18                  23 Jun 1997


     ======================================================================
     The presence of this flag in a system's nodelist entry indicates that
     the system is able to process ERX mail packets of level <n>. The
     current minimum and maximum values of <n> are both "1", indicating
     that the system is able to process ERX packets of level 1, meaning
     that the packets can only contain EDX message items. Please refer to
     EDX1.TXT for the EDX and ERX specifications.

     The format of the "ERX<n>" nodelist flag is
        "ERX" <n>
     as in "the three letters 'E', 'R' and 'X', immediately followed with
     the token <n>", where <n> is a number in decimal notation, with
     currently all values but '1' being reserved.

     If your system does not support ZIP and you do not yet have a NOZIP
     flag in your nodelist entry, or if your system is able to process ERX
     packets and you do not yet have an ERX<n> flag, please urge your NC or
     RC, whichever appropriate, to update your nodelist entry as soon as
     possible.

     0. Introduction
      In common, more and more mailer are about to implement the ability to
      call external request processors. But very soon, we discovered a
      command line cannot handle all the information the mailer has and the
      ERP needs.

     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 19                  23 Jun 1997


      To transfer the information in a proper and fast way, we designed and
      implemented the S R I F option in the mean it will be a standard
      soon.

      The structure and idea is protected by copyright law, except these
      circumstances:

             +  you may distrubute, use and implement this structure for
                free
             +  you have not to pay any value for usage of these methodes
             +  you should note in your documentation the origin of SRIF

     1. Description
      The SRIF name is the only parameter given from the Mailer to the
      External Request Processor. The file is designated as a so called
      "plain vanilla ASCII" file, filled with pre-defined, optional and
      not-yet defined statemets.

      We discussed the possibility of binary files, and of EMSI-like files,
      but a plain ASCII control file is more flexible and can be read
      faster by various program languages (C, Pascal, Basic, Cobol ect).

      In the SRIF, one command plus parameter is allowed per line, the file
      is unlimited in length, comments are not allowed.

      The SRIF is generated by the Mailer and after the ERP finished its
      work, the Mailer is responsible for erasing the SRIF.

     1.1 Required statements
      The following statements are required for the ERP:

            Sysop            <Sysop_Name>
                             This is the name of the remote sysop

            AKA              <Zone:Net/Node[.Point][@Domain]>
                             This is the main aka of the remote system in
                             4D or 5D notation. A zero as point number may
                             be ommited, the domain with "@" is optional

            Baud             <Current LINE rate>
                             This is the effective baud rate, not the fixed
                             DTE rate

            Time             <Time in minutes>
                             This is the time till next event which does
                             not allow file requests. Use -1 if no limits

            RequestList      <File of request list>
                             This is the filename of the list containing
                             requested files.
            ResponseList     <File of response list>
                             This is the filename of the response list.
                             It must not be equal to RequestList. One file
                             per line, including drives/pathes to the file.
                             The first character defines the way the mailer
                             should act after sending that file:
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 20                  23 Jun 1997


                              =   erase file if sent successfully
                              +   do not erase the file after sent
                              -   erase the file in any case after session

            RemoteStatus     <PROTECTED or UNPROTECTED>
                             Defines whether the session is protected by
                             password or not

            SystemStatus     <LISTED or UNLISTED>
                             Defines whether the remote system is listed in
                             any current nodelist of system.

     1.2 Optional statements
      These parameters are already known and defined, but a ERP should run
      also without them:

            SessionProtocoll <e.g. ZAP,ZMO,XMA

            AKA              <Zone:Net/Node[.Point][@Domain]>
                             Additional AKAs. One AKA is required (see
                             REQUIRED section)

            Site             <Site Info>
                             The site info as given e.g. in EMSI handshake

            Location         <Location and/or ZIP>
                             The location info as given e.g. in EMSI
                             handshake

            Phone            <Phone Number>
                             The phone number info as given e.g. in EMSI
                             handshake

            Password         <Session password>
                             On protected sessions, the session password.
                             If no protected session, this parameter must
                             be ommited!

            DTE              <Current DTE rate>
                             The PC<->Modem speed (so call DTE rate)

            PORT             <COM Port from 1 to 8>
                             The FOSSIL Communication Port. The Mailer
                             should leave the fossil "hot" for the Request
                             Processor

            Mailer           <Remote's mailer if EMSI>
                             The Mailer name as defined by FTC

            MailerCode       <Remote's FTSC code>
                             The hex code of the remote mailer as defined
                             by FTC

            SerialNumber     <Remote's serial number if passed>
                             The remote mailer's serial number if
                             transfered

     1.3 Undefined options
      There may be the need to add new commands / parameters to the SRI
      file. If so, they may be added, but inform us to keep the
      documentation "up to date" and to share your good ideas with other
      autors of software for FIDONet.

     2.0 Implementation
      SRIF is implemented in these fine products already :

                     Mailer                  Request Processor

         Purpose:
             To  document  current practices in File Forwarding and the
     minimum requirements and known extensions of the TIC file format.

         Acknowledgements:
             The  TIC  file  format  was introduced by Barry Geller, in the
     MSDOS File Forwarder, Tick.  Useful extensions to this format were
     introduced by Harald Helms, in the MSDOS FileForwarder, AllFix.

         Terminology:
         FTN - Fidonet Technolgy Network, such as FIDONET, AMIGANET or
         IBMNET.  Sometimes used interchangably with the term DOMAIN.

         FNC - FileName Conversion, process of converting filenames to
     msdos 8.3 format for transmission.

         FQFA - Fully Qualified FTN Address, the format is
                   FTN#Zone:Net/Node.Point

         CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check, method to determine whether some
     data has been altered. CRC-32 is used in File Forwarding.

         TIC - a file that contains control information for the File
     Forwarding system.   These  files  are  named  xxSTAMP.TIC,  where  xx
     is  an abbreviation  representing  the  File  Forwarding  program
     name and stamp  is  a  unixdate  stamp  truncated  to 6 characters.

         UTC  -  Universal  Time  Coordinated,  the  time  at  the  0o

       Format of a TIC file:

         Addressing:
             In  a  tic  file  any form of FTN address representation from
     3d to FQFA  may  be  used.   All  File  Forwarders  must  understand
     the following formats:

               zone:net/node                 - 3D
               zone:net/node.point           - 4D
               zone:net/node@ftn             - 5D - point 0 assumed
               zone:net/node.point@ftn       - 5D
               ftn#zone:net/node.point       - fqfa

             File Forwarders should have configurable options per site as

     to the type of addressing each of it's downlinks can understand.

         Dates:
             All dates are expressed in UTC.

         TimeDateStamps:
             All  TimeDateStamps are unix TimeDateStamps (# of seconds
     since Jan 1, 1960) in UTC and expressed in hexadecimal notation.

         Case Insensitivity:
             the  format is completely case-insensitive.  It is general
     practice that  the  first  letter  of a keyword is uppercase.  This is
     not a requirement.

         Order Dependancy:
             keywords are not order dependant.
             Order  dependancy  is required in some groupings of a keyword,
             such as PATH, VIA, DESC and APP.

         Modification of address fields on PassThrough:
             The  forwarding  site may modify the addresses in any keyword
     field to  make  them  compliant  with  the addressing limitations of
     each downlink.

         Stripping of SeenBys:
             The  forwarding site may strip seenbys to current FTN, ZONE or
     NET, when not forwarding outside of current FTN, ZONE or NET.  This
     does not imply nor permit the stripping of of a direct downlink
     which is outside the current strip filter.

         Keywords:
           There are no colons on keywords.

           Each keyword line is terminated with CR LF pair.

           The maximum length of a keyword line is 256 characters,
     including the CRLF termination. Some keyword lines may have a shorter
     limit.

           Keywords  are  separated from their data by a single space.
     There is no space if there is no data associated with the keyword.
             eg:  ReturnReceipt

           Keywords are case-insensitive and order independant.

           Keywords not understood are to be passed-though.

           Known Keywords that are blank should not be passed though.
             For  example,  an  empty  AREADESC,  could be either dropped
     or the blank  replaced with the proper description.

           Most Keywords are passed through when processing.
             There  are  exceptions.  In some cases, a site-specific
     replacement may be created.
             Keywords marked with a ^ should not be passed-through.

           Keywords marked with a * are REQUIRED when processing a TIC
     file.  If  any  of these are missing, the tic file should be
     considered as BAD and the associated file not forwarded to downlinks.

           Keywords marked with a # are CREATED when hatching or
     forwarding.

         *#  AREA [AreaName]
               the TagName of the file area.

             AREADESC [description of area]                    OPTIONAL
               a  short  (80 chars) description of the file area.  This
     could be the description found in FileBone.NA

         *#  FILE [File being sent]
               the name of the file being sent, no path
               the filename must conform to msdos 8.3 format, unless it is
               known that the receiving site can handle longer filenames.

         ^#  FULLNAME [original filename before FNC]           OPTIONAL FNC
     only the original filename (no path) before FileName Conversion

         *#  CRC [CRC-32 in hex]
               crc of the file being sent, 8 hexadecimal characters

         ^   MAGIC [MagicName]               OPTIONAL
               Name  under  which the file can be FREQed from the site
     listed in FROM.   This  is  NOT  passed  though when forwarding,
     unless the MAGIC  name  is  the  same  on  the  forwarding  site.  It
     can be replaced by the appropriate name.

             REPLACES [FileName]               OPTIONAL
               Filename  (no  path)  of  a  file  hatched  in  the AREA
     that the associated file replaces.  If the site expects FNC files,
     and the filename  does  not confrom to msdos 8.3 convention, the
     REPLACES name should also be FNC.

          #  DESC [Description]
               Description of the file, limited to 80 characters per line,
               including CRLF termination.
               If  multiple LDESC lines are used, the DESC line must
               provide the maximum information.  No File Forwadrer is
               required to passthough or make use of any extra DESC line
               after the first.

          # LDESC [multiple lines]
               A  long description of the file.  LDESC does NOT replace
     DESC, it is  used IN ADDITION to the short description.  No File
     Forwarder is required make use of LESC lines.

          #  SIZE [Bytes]              OPTIONAL, SHOULD be required
               Length of the file in bytes

             DATE [TimeDateStamp]
               TimeDateStamp of the file. Can be date of creation of
     archive.

            RELEASE [TimeDateStamp]
               Date  when file is TO BE released.  Usually used by SDS, but
     can be used by ADS as well.

            AUTHOR [name]
               Name of the author of the software package being hatched.
     This field is obviously not applicable to Newsletters, Nodelists and
     Diffs and the like.

            SOURCE [authors_address]
               FTN  address of the Author of the software package being
     hatched.  Not  necessary  the same as the ORIGIN hatch site.  Does not
     have
               to be an FTN address.

          ^ APP [program] [Application Specific Information]
               The  APP  keyword  is  a  keyword  known  to programs of the
     name indicated.  APP'S are order dependent and must be passed
     though.

         *#  ORIGIN [Address]
               Site where file entered the fileecho

         *^# FROM [Address] [Pwd]
               Site  that  is  forwarding  the  file  to  the next site.
     Pwd is optional and rarely used, IF AT ALL.  Pwd is NEVER passed
     through.

         ^   TO [Address]                        OPTIONAL
               Site  to  which  this TIC and the assocaited file are being
     sent.  This keyword is included in the .TIC file when:
                 a)  the file is being routed via another system which
                     permits such routing.
                 b)  the  platform  in  use  does  not  have  any  FTN
                     software independant   method   of   associating   a
                     file  and it's destination.   eg.   platforms  that
                     do not have filenotes that   could  contain  this
                     information  as  part  of the filesystem.

               If  the address in the TO line is that of the receiving
     site, the field  is  not passed through when forwarding.  If the
     address in the  TO  lines  IS  NOT  that of the receiving site, it
     should be forwarded to the TO site, if a routing agreement is in place
     with the sending site.

         *^# CREATED [by] [Program Banner]
               File  Forwarder which created the TIC file.  This is
     generally in the form:
                 Created [by] program_name version [copyright_info]

             VIA [FROM CREATED]                  OPTIONAL (tracking)
               Copy  of  CREATED  line of FROM, with 'Created [by]'
     stripped and FROM  prepended.   Always passed though.  The VIA is only
     created by the receiving site when forwarding. It is never created
     by the hatching  site.  Therefore, in any TIC file, the addresses
     in the FROM and VIA should never be the same.

     TimeDateStamp, date and time is that of when the Site received and
     Processed the file.

         * # SEENBY [Address]
               Site  which  has  received the file.  There are multiple
     lines of Seenby and they are unordered.

         *   PW [password]
               Site or Area password.  This is case-insensitive and should
     be at least 5 characters in length.

             PGP [signature]
               PrettyGoodPrivacy signature. To be discussed.

         ^    ReceiptRequest -no data-               OPTIONAL
               A  request  to the receiving system to generate a
     IsReturnReceipt (attribute  word bit 13) messsage, in the same manner
     it would if it  had  received  a message with the FileAttach an
     ReturnReceipt attributes and a subject of the filename.
               There  is  NO  requirement  to recognize this keyword.  It
               should never be passed through.

       Transmission of Files:

         The  associated file, that is, the file Listed in the FILE field
     of the TIC  file, should always be sent FIRST.  In the case of a
     failed session, sending  the  FILE  first  prevents  the  orphaning
     of  the file that is normally caused by the deletion or movement of
     the TIC file to BAD.

         File  Forwarders should not move or delete orphaned TIC files, but
     this can neither be relied upon nor mandated.

         File  Forwaders  should  be  transparent  to  the  renaming  of
     file by mailers.   This  means  that  if  the  mailer renames a
     duplicate file by renaming  or  bumpinmg  a numeric extension, the
     File Forwarder should be able  to  use  the  size  and  crc fields of
     the TIC to find and properly rename the associated file referred to in
     the TIC.

       File  Forwaders  should  always  delete and dequeue unsent TIC files
     when re-hatching  the  same  or  updated  version  of an associated
     file.  The implementor  may  wish  to  allow  exceptions  for
     periodicals such  as nodediffs and newsletters.

         Compatibility and Link Qualifier Extensions for EMSI Sessions
         Robert Williamson FidoNet#1:167/104.0  robert@ecs.mtlnet.org

         Purpose:

         The  basic  purpose of this document is to start discussions which
         will hopefully result in an improved handshake negotiation
         protocol.

         Scope:

         Relation of flags to Types of files transferred:

         The  FSC-0056  EMSI  specification  (hereafter  referred  to as
         EMSI-I) makes  little  distinction  between  ARCmail/packets and
         other types of files,  such  as  files attached and TIC'ed files.
         In EMSI-I, the term 'Mail'  when  not  used  in  conjunction with
         the term 'compressed', is interpreted to mean ANY file.

         This  extension  (hereafter  referred to as EMSI-II) makes
         reference to and  allows control of types of files in addition to
         'compressed mail'.  References  to  'Mail'  are  changed to 'File'
         where common practice so indicates.   The  additional qualifier
         flags described provide for more control as to the types of files
         a system is prepared to receive.


         Relation of flags to presented addresses:

         The  EMSI-I  specification does not allow qualification for any
         address other than the PRIMARY address.  This means that Link
         flags are limited in  application  to  either  all  presented
         addresses or to the primary presented address only.

         This  extension  also  allows  application  of  Link  flags to
         specific addresses other than the primary.

         Distinctions between Calling and Answering System:

         In  the EMSI-I spec, the type of flags that may be presented is
         limited by  the  status  of the site.  Certain flags may only be
         presented when the  site  is the caller and other flags may only
         be presented when the site is the answerer.  This proposed
         extension removes this distinction.

         In the EMSI-I spec, certain Link and Capability (a.k.a:
         Compatibility) flags  are  caller-driven, while others are
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 28                  23 Jun 1997


         controlled by the answering system.  This specification attempts
         to harmonize these discrepancies.

         A  attempt  is made to remain somewhat backwards compatible and to
         have new  flags  follow the original flag naming convention.
         However, IMHO, it  would  be preferable to harmonize the flags;
         reducing the number of them  while retaining the fine type
         control, so that the same codes are used in all sessions.

         Under  both  EMSI-I and EMSI-II, any flags that are not
         understood, are to  be  ignored.   Therfore,  if  a site presents
         it's flags in EMSI-II format  and  the  other site does not do
         EMSI-II, it is permissable for that site to interpret all flags
         according to EMSI-I specifications.

         Specifics:

         Compatibility flags:

         Compatibility  flags  consist of a string of codes that specify
         the PROTOCOL CAPABILITIES and ENABLED FEATURES of the mailer.

         ARC, XMA
         These  EMSI-I  compatibility  flags  have  no  meaning  relavant
         to the transfer  of  files  and  are  not  to  be presented under
         EMSI-II.  If received, they are to be ignored.

         FNC
         The FNC EMSI-I compatibility flag has been identified as a
         'mistake' by the  author  of EMSI-I.  This is agreeable as that
         specification called for   the   creation   of   a   filename
         that  was  ALWAYS  8.3, not up-to-8.up-to-3.  It   is   not  to
         be  presented  under  EMSI-II.   If  received as  a compatibility
         flag, it is to be ignored.

         Protocol Selection:

         In  the EMSI-I spec, a requirement is placed upon the calling
         system to present  it's  available  protocols  in  order  of
         preference.  A quote follows:

             The calling system must list supported protocols first and
             descending order of preference (the most desirable protocol
             should be listed first).
             The answering system should only present one protocol and it
             should be the first item in the compatibility_codes field.

         Some mailer authors have interpreted 'the compatibility_codes
         field' in the  second  sentence  to  mean  that  of the answering
         system, thereby making  protocol  selection RECEIVER-PREFS driven.
         This interpretation makes  unnecessary  the  'decending  order'
         requirement placed upon the calling   system,   so  shall  be
         considered  in  conflict  with that requirement.

          Most   mailer  authors  have  interpreted  that  phrase  to  mean
         the 'compatibility_codes  field'  OF  THE  CALLER,  thereby making
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 29                  23 Jun 1997


         protocol selection  CALLER-PREFS  driven.   Since  EMSI-I  was
         intended to be "a clear  protocol  definition  for  state-of-the-
         art  E-Mail systems  to follow",  they  cannot  be  faulted  for
         interpretation.  Caller-prefs driven  selection  is state-of-the-
         art, receiver-prefs driven selection is older technolgy, such as
         Wazoo.

         This   specification   requires   that   the   second
         interpretation, CALLER-PREFS driven, be mandatory.

         New Compatibilty Flags:
         ----------------------

         EII
         Indicates   that   the   system   will   interpret   flags  under
         this specification, if other end also presents this flag.  IF
         either or both systems  do  not  present  this  flag,  all
         interpretations  are  done according to EMSI-I.

         DFB
         Indicates  that  the  system  presenting  is  capabable of fall-
         back to FTS1/WAZOO  negotiation  in the case of failure of EMSI
         handshake or no common  protocol.   Since  ZMO  is  the  minimum
         required protocol, NCP should  only  occur  if  the  answering
         system presents more than one protocol..  (ie. it's broken)

         FRQ
         Indicates  that  the  system  will  accept  and  process  file
         requests received  during  outbound  calls.   In other words, the
         calling system will  do a second turnaround for uni-directional
         protocols, to send the files requested, at his cost.

         NRQ
         NRQ should be presented ONLY IF the mailer does not have a file
         request server, task or function and cannot accept requests..  It
         should NOT be used to indicate that the  function  is  temporarly
         disabled.

         When  examined,  No  requests will be sent.  It would be advisable
         that the  mailer  alert  the  system  operator  of this occurance
         to prevent continued polling of the remote site.

         Protocol Capabilities:

         Protocol   capability   flags  are  presented  in  decending
         order  of preference  by  the  caller.  The answering system
         selects and presents the  FIRST  protocol  from  the  callers
         list  that  it supports.  The answering system must present only
         ONE protocol.

         This  is  presented  if  no compatible protocol can be negotiated
         under EMSI.   Since  in  most  FTN  networks,  a  common protocol
         DOES exist, fallback   to  WaZoo  and  FTS1  negotiation  is
         expected.   If these negotiation methods are not available, the
         session is terminated.

         This  condition  should  never  occur  under  normal
         circumstances.  It should  be  considered as a problem with the
         design or configuration of one of the mailers involved.

         Link flags:
         ----------

         Link  flags  consist  of a string of codes that specify DESIRED
         CONNECT CONDITIONS.   They  apply  to  the CURRENT SESSION ONLY.
         Under EMSI-I, there are four TYPES of link flags:  communications
         parameters, session parameters, pickup options and hold options.
         Under EMSI-II, only three types  are  used,  the communications
         parameters type is REMOVED, as it serves no purpose whatsoever in
         FTN operations.

         Link Session options:

         FNC
         If  either  system  presents  this  flag,  it is an indication
         that the presenting   system   requires   filename   conversion
         to  cp/m-msdos conventions.  The other system will convert
         filenames to cp/m cpm/msdos 8.3 conventions before sending.
         The   convention   is   defined   as   a  filename  consisting  of
         two parts,  the  filepart  and  extension.   The filepart and
         extension are separated  by a period ".".  The filepart may be
         from 1 to 8 characters in  length  and  the  extension  may  be
         from  0 to 3 characters.  The character set shall be any uppercase
         character in the range A-Z and any numeric  character  in  the
         range  0-9.   If  the extension is of zero length, the period may
         or may not be present.

         RMA
         Indicates that the presenting site is able to send and process
         multiple file  requests.   If both sites present this flag, the
         caller will send any REQ files found for each AKA presented by the
         answering system.  The answering system will process each received
         REQ.

         RH1
         Indicates  that  under  the  Hydra  protocol,  batch  one contains
         file requests only, while batch 2 is reserved for all other files.

         (others to be defined)

         Pickup and Hold Flags:

         Under  the  EMSI-I  specification, Link Pickup flags are only
     FIDONEWS 14-25               Page 31                  23 Jun 1997


         presented when  calling (an Outbound Session) and are examined and
         processed only when  answering  (an  Inbound  Session)  and  Link
         Hold flags are only presented  when  answering  (an  Inbound
         Session) and are examined and processed only when calling (an
         Outbound Session).

         With  EMSI-II,  BOTH  Pickup and Hold flags are presented by both
         sites during  a  session.   This  allows  more control for those
         systems, for example,  which  cannot  modify  addresses  presented
         or rotate akas to change  the  primary  address  presented  on  a
         per-session or per-site basis.

         Link Pickup and Hold:

         Each  system can present one of three (or more) Link options
         related to application of addresses.  If neither of these flags
         are presented, PUA is to be assumed.

         Neither  PUA  nor  PUP  is  to  be  presented  if  only one
         address was presented.

                  PUP     Pickup FILES for primary address only
               /  PUA     Pickup FILES for all presented addresses

         Qualifiers:

         Qualifiers  are  processed  in  the  order presented, with any
         conflict being  resolved  by  subsequent  qualifiers overridding
         any conflicting previous qualifier in the list.

         Qualifiers may be not be presented with either NPU or HAT and
         should be ignored if received with NPU or HAT.
