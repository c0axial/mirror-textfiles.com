     Introducing the Old Echomail Policy
     George Peace
     1:1/0

     Many of us have seen the document. Many use it every day to help
     us choreograph the flow of echomail. But until a real Echomail
     Policy is enacted as a formal Zone 1 Policy, we're all simply
     operating the backbone; moderating our conferences; and choosing
     our Echomail Coordinators independently, inconsistently, and
     without administrative support.

     Echopol isn't perfection -- Policy never does seem to be. Some
     parts of it give some of us heartburn while others evoke our
     applause. What most of us do agree on is the need to enact an
     Echomail Policy. The Zone 1 Region Echomail Coordinators have
     banded together to offer the April 1989 Echopol to the Zone 1
     Coordinator for adoption. I've joined them in this effort after
     witnessing and even being part of situations that would have had
     a much different outcome if we'd finished the job we started 18
     months ago.

     So what we've proposed is that the document be adopted as the
     Zone 1 General Echomail Policy effective October 22, 1990. For
     the first 60 days following its adoption, Zone 1 will operate
     under that Policy. During that time, the Zone 1 RECs will accept
     our constructive comments and requests for change. Comments and
     RFCs will be accepted by any Zone 1 REC in a two part Situation /
     Solution format that includes a proposed change to the Policy. At
     the end of the 60 day period, the RECs will work with change
     submitters, Conference Moderators, and NECs to determine which
     solutions/changes will be implemented. A *C/*EC ratification
     referendum for the revised EchoPol will be conducted between
     January 15 and January 31. If that referendum fails, the Zone 1
     Echomail Coordinator will coordinate efforts to submit another
     document for ratification.

     The document presented here is also available for file request
     as ECHOPOL from 1:1/0, 1:157/200, 1:12/12, 1:13/13, 1:114/5,
     1:322/1, 1:105/310+311+312, 1:151/1003, 1:382/1, and 1:396/1.




                        GENERAL ECHOMAIL POLICY 1.0
                            October 22nd, 1990

     PROLOGUE

     This document sets forth policy governing Echomail conferences
     and their distribution.

     If any item in this policy is in conflict with any existing or
     subsequent General FidoNet Policy, then General FidoNet Policy
     will be in effect.

     This Policy applies to Zone One Backbone Echomail conferences and
     to any other conferences for which the Moderator desires it to be
     applicable.

     Future changes to Echo Policy may be proposed by any FidoNet
     Sysop by submitting the proposal to their REC.  The REC will then
     determine if the proposal should be brought before the rest of
     the RECs.  If an REC decides not to bring a proposed change
     before the rest of the RECs, a message stating why must be sent.
     If 10% or more of the NCs and NECs in a region request that a
     proposal be brought before the RECs then that proposal must be
     submitted to the RECs.

     A majority vote of the Regional Echomail Coordinators is required
     in order for a proposal to be formally voted on.  If 10% or more
     of the NCs and NECs in the Zone request that a proposal be
     formally voted on, then that proposal must be formally voted on.

     Those eligible to vote on any proposals made by the REC structure
     will be the ZEC, RECs, NECs, NCs, RCs and ZC.  Only one vote per
     person is allowed.  Adoption of changes will require a simple
     majority of those voting to pass.

     In this document, "a simple majority" means more than 50 percent
     of those voting.  A good faith attempt must be made to make all
     potential voters aware that a vote is occurring and make
     available all necessary information.


     I.  HISTORY

     Echomail consists of the sharing of message bases or conferences
     between various independent network addresses.  The Echomail
     concept started with a series of programs by Jeff Rush.  Since
     the original implementation, many authors have written programs
     improving on the original idea.  In spite of worries that the
     flow of Echomail would increase Netmail traffic to the point that
     the Network would collapse under its own weight, Echomail has
     been a success.  To simplify the distribution of Echomail, a
     national Echomail Backbone formed whose primary purpose is the
     distribution of Echomail at a national level.  Of recent
     introduction to the Backbone system has been the generous
     contribution of the Echomail Stars.  As a result of the growth of
     Fidonet and the increase in the volume of Echomail, it has become
     necessary to set forth a formal policy governing Echomail.

     II.  DEFINITIONS

     1.  ECHOMAIL:  The process of sharing message bases between
     independent systems with unique net/node addresses.

     2.  ECHOMAIL CONFERENCES:  An Echomail conference is a message
     base of forum design distributed under a specified conference
     name dealing with a defined area of interest.  Notable examples
     include TECH, the National Technical Conference and COMM, the
     National Telecommunications Conference.

     3.  MODERATED CONFERENCE:  A moderated conference is an Echomail
     conference for which a moderator has been appointed to supervise
     the flow and content of the conference.  All conferences carried
     on the Backbone must be moderated.

     4.  SYSOP-ONLY CONFERENCE:  A Sysop-Only Conference is one in
     which the Moderator has decided that the conference will be made
     available only to Sysops and not to users.

     5.  RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCES:  A restricted
     distribution conference is one which is restricted only to
     eligible recipients.  Notable examples include REGCON, the
     Regional Coordinators Conference, COORD, the National Echomail
     Coordinators Conference, and MAGICK, a pre-register Echomail
     Conference.

     6.  ZONE ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR (ZEC):  This individual is
     responsible for coordination of Echomail on a FidoNet Zone level.

     7.  REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR (REC):  This individual is
     responsible for coordination of Echomail within his region.

     8.  NET ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR (NEC):  This individual is
     responsible for coordination of Echomail at the Local Net level.

     9.  ECHOMAIL Backbone:  The Echomail Backbone consists of
     voluntary members who provide services to enhance the national
     distribution of Echomail.  The Backbone consists of nodes which
     handle a high volume of Echomail traffic and are responsible for
     distribution of Echomail down to the regional level.

     10.  NATIONAL ECHOMAIL LIST:  The National Echomail List
     identifies the available national conferences, the conference
     moderator and requirements of the specified conference.  The ZEC
     will appoint the keeper of the National Echomail List.

     11.  AUTOMATED CENSORSHIP:  The term Automated Censorship refers
     to programs which cause messages to be removed from the intended
     conference or have their content altered.

     FidoNews 7-41                Page 4                    8 Oct 1990


     12.  FIDONET POLICY:  The document which governs Fidonet as
     adopted by Fidonet.  The document as of this writing is Policy4
     and is subject to change.  This policy is intended to become a
     part of general Fidonet policy.  Until it is incorporated into
     General Fidonet policy, this document shall serve to define
     policy violations occurring in Echomail.

     13.  OPEN ACCESS CONFERENCE:  This is a non-restricted conference
     open to all users who are willing to follow the posted conference
     rules.

     14.  TERMINAL NODE:  A system which does not process echomail for
     pickup by another system.


     III.  DUTIES OF ECHOMAIL COORDINATORS

     1.  GENERAL:  It is the duty of the *ECs to make available to any
     Fidonet Sysop, any conference which the Sysop is not prohibited
     from receiving by not meeting requirements as mandated by the
     conference moderator.  If for any reason the *EC does not have
     access via recognized distribution channels to a specific
     conference, they can not be expected to pass it on.  If a *EC
     fails to make available any conference to qualified lower
     distribution levels, this shall be deemed to have violated the
     outlined duties of the position held.  Such violation is cause
     for the removal as provided by this document.  Nothing in this
     provision requires that a *EC must import any conference to the
     extent of adverse economic impact.  It is recommended that cost
     sharing arrangements be employed.  Where financially feasible for
     the supplier any conference on the Backbone must be made
     available (other than restricted conferences) when requested.

     An exception is when a *EC cuts a link to end unauthorized
     distribution of a conference.  In this case, some otherwise
     authorized nodes may temporarily lose their link.

     A *EC shall do everything in their power to insure that:

         1.  All downstream links are educated as to this policy.

         2.  Downstream links know how to properly link into
         conferences.

         3.  Acceptable and unacceptable behavior in echomail
         conferences is explained.

         4.  Downstream links are not engaging in topologies that
         increase the risk of duplicate messages.

     2.  DUTIES OF ZONE ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of the
     ZEC to coordinate the connections between the Echomail Backbone
     on both an inter-Zone and intra-Zone level as well as
     coordination of inter-regional connections.  The ZEC will
     coordinate transmission of Echomail and to provide for routing in
     a manner that will avoid the transmission of duplicate messages
     FidoNews 7-41                Page 5                    8 Oct 1990


     within the same conference. It is also the duty of the ZEC to
     monitor compliance with this policy on both a national and
     international basis.

     3.  DUTIES OF REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of
     the REC to provide for regional Echomail distribution.  In
     addition, the REC will coordinate any inter-regional
     cross-linking of conference feeds with the REC of the
     participating region with the direct knowledge of the ZEC.  The
     REC will provide for transmission and routing of Echomail within
     his/her region in a manner to avoid creation of duplicate
     messages within the same conference.  It is the duty of the REC
     to monitor compliance with this policy at a regional level.

     4.  DUTIES OF NET ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of the
     NEC to coordinate the intra-net Echomail and to cooperate with
     the REC and NECs of other nets to arrange for the inter-net
     transmittal of echomail.  The REC may require the NEC to provide
     links for independent (regional) nodes.  The NEC shall maintain a
     list of available Echomail Conferences within the net as well as
     the requirements of each Conference area as supplied by the
     conference moderator (Echolist).  The NEC shall also monitor
     compliance with this policy at a net level.

     5.  DUTIES OF ECHOLIST COORDINATOR:  It is the duty of the
     Echolist Coordinator to compile and make available a listing of
     national and international Echomail conferences and optionally,
     conferences at various local levels.  The content and format of
     the Echomail listing shall be at the sole discretion of the
     Echolist Coordinator, but shall include the conference name and
     moderator for each conference.  The Echolist Coordinator shall
     also maintain a list of requirements applicable to each listed
     conference.

     6.  DUTIES OF ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE MODERATOR:  It shall be the
     duty of the Echomail Conference Moderator to make in good faith
     every reasonable effort to insure that the moderated conference
     does not distribute or promote illegal activities or information
     as defined below in Section V Paragraph 2.  The Moderator shall
     be responsible for insuring that messages contained in the
     conference corresponds to the conference theme.  The Moderator
     shall report any violations of this policy to the proper Echomail
     coordinators and lodge any appropriate policy complaints as
     provided for in policy documents adopted by Fidonet.  The
     Moderator shall post the conference rules in the conference at
     least once a month.  The Moderator is to authorize the
     disconnection of the conference feed.  Any Sysop the moderator
     believes is violating policy shall be reported to the offending
     node's nearest local echomail coordinator (may be a NEC, REC or
     in extreme situations a ZEC); and the moderator shall formally
     authorize the feed to the offending node to be severed.  The
     conference moderator is the sole judge, subject to review only by
     the ZEC (or his delegates), if a complaint is filed by the
     banished party.  The Moderator may request in direct written form
     (netmail) that the *ECs disconnect a node from the conference
     when that node refuses to follow the published conference rules
     FidoNews 7-41                Page 6                    8 Oct 1990


     after at least 3 warnings.  Knowingly feeding a conference to a
     node that has been severed by the Moderator is considered a
     violation of this echomail policy and is subject to suspension.
     The length of this suspension will be determined by a joint
     decision of the conference moderator and the nearest local echo
     coordinator of the node illegally feeding the conference to the
     original offending node or point.

     Echo conference complaints from a Sysop should be filed at the
     net level (NEC) or if the complaining party is an independent
     node then with their REC.  The NEC or REC receiving such a
     complaint must take action in accordance with the provisions of
     this echomail policy.

     For severe or chronic infractions the NEC, REC or ZEC may file a
     complaint under general Fidonet policy for excessively annoying
     behaviour.


     IV.  APPOINTMENT AND ELECTION OF ECHOMAIL COORDINATORS AND
          MODERATORS

     1.  GRANDFATHER CLAUSE:  Those Zone, Regional, and Net Echomail
     Coordinators and Echomail Coordinators currently holding these
     positions as of the date of acceptance of this Echomail Policy
     shall continue to serve in said capacity until resignation or
     replacement under this policy.

     2.  ELECTION OF ZONE ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  The ZEC shall be
     elected as follows:

         a) upon resignation or replacement of the existing ZEC,
         the FidoNet Zone Coordinator (ZC) shall nominate at
         least five individuals to be voted upon.

         b) 10 days after the nominees are selected, an election
         shall be held.  The ZEC will be elected by a simple
         majority of IC, ZC, RCs, NCs, RECs, and NECs in their
         Fidonet zone.  An individual holding more than one
         position can only cast one vote.  That is, if an
         individual is both a NC and a NEC, they may cast only
         one vote.

     3.  ELECTION OF REGIONAL ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  The REC shall be
     elected as follows:

         a) upon resignation or replacement of an existing REC,
         the ZEC shall nominate at least 3 individuals for
         election.

         b) 10 days after the nominees are selected, an election
     FidoNews 7-41                Page 7                    8 Oct 1990


         shall be held.  The REC will be elected by a simple
         majority of the RC, NCs and NECs in their FidoNet
         Region.  An individual holding more than one position
         may only cast one vote.

     4.  NET ECHOMAIL COORDINATOR:  The NEC shall be appointed by the
     FidoNet Net Coordinator (NC) or in such alternative manner as
     determined by the NC.  If a NEC is not appointed within 30 days,
     the REC will appoint the NEC.

     5.  REMOVAL OF A *EC:  A *EC may be removed from their position\
     by a simple majority of those allowed to vote for their
     successor.  For a NEC, the members of the Net may vote by simple
     majority to remove the NEC.  The position directly above (in the
     *EC structure) will oversee the recall election in the same
     manner as prescribed for electing successors.

     A *EC may only be subject to recall for failure to properly carry
     out their duties described above, or if they are no longer a
     member of Fidonet.  A promise of 'free' echomail delivery from
     another source is *not* considered an acceptable reason for
     recall.

     A *EC may be removed by the level above for continued violations
     of policy or for gross misconduct.

     6.  RECOGNITION OF CONFERENCES:  The *EC corresponding to the
     appropriate level recognizes a conference at his level.
     Examples: The NEC recognizes a conference as local.  The REC
     recognizes a conference to be regional.  A ZEC recognizes a
     conference to be zonal.

     7.  REMOVAL OF AN ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE MODERATOR:  An Echomail
     Conference Moderator may be removed from their position by a
     three fourths (3/4) vote of the *EC structure voting.  This vote
     must be carried out in a fair and decent manner while giving at
     least ten (10) days notice to the entire *EC structure of the
     upcoming vote.

     The ZEC shall notify the RECs who in turn shall notify the NECs
     in their region of any upcoming vote.  Notice must be given via
     NetMail.  Additional postings in such conferences as COORD and
     regional conferences are encourgaged.

     An Echomail Conference Moderator may only be subject to recall
     for failure to properly carry out their duties described above or
     continued pre-meditated violation of this documents section V.
     Statement of Policies as seen below.  Failing to perform the
     above duties of a conference moderator for a period of 3 or more
     months and/or failing to designate a proxy in his absence shall
     be in violation of this policy and be subject to recall.  A vote
     may only be callable by the ZEC (or his delegate).  This delegate
     should not be from the region or net of the affected conference
     moderator.

     Membership in Fidonet need not be a paramount issue, but is
     highly recommended.


     V.  STATEMENT OF POLICIES

     1.  BASIC ECHOMAIL POLICY:  The basic policy of Echomail is to
     promote communication in Echomail Conferences in a lawful,
     friendly manner consistent with the general principles of
     FidoNet.

     2.  PROHIBITION ON ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES:  Any Node which knowingly
     distributes or allows to be entered into echomail conferences any
     messages containing or promoting illegal activities or
     information shall be deemed to have violated general FidoNet
     policy as being excessively annoying.  As used in this paragraph,
     "illegal activities" includes activities which are a violation of
     civil law as well as activities which would result in criminal
     prosecution.

     3.  AUTOMATED CENSORSHIP:  The use of Automated Censorship in the
     passing or distribution of echomail will be considered a
     violation of this policy and will not be tolerated.  Disciplinary
     action will be as referred to in General Fidonet policy as being
     excessively annoying.

     An exception to this provision shall be the deletion and not
     censorship of messages by any Sysop which may lead to legal
     action against that Sysop.

     No echomail shall be modified in any manner which could
     potentially cause duplicates.

     4.  INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCES:  Inter-Net conferences shall
     conform to general Fidonet policy as well as the provisions of
     this policy document in addition to any foreign network's
     provisions.  Conferences which originate outside of FidoNet must
     be designated as such in the list of conferences kept by the
     Echolist Coordinator.

     5.  CHARGING FOR DISTRIBUTION:  Any entity which makes a profit
     from the distribution (passing from system to system) of echomail
     shall be deemed to be excessively annoying and in violation of
     Fidonet policy subject to enforcement under existing Fidonet
     policy.  Profit as defined in this paragraph is the charging for
     echomail distribution that exceeds actual cost to obtain and
     distribute the Echomail over a sustained period.  The cost of the
     equipment used to obtain and distribute echomail may only be
     recovered on a strictly voluntary basis.  A Sysop that charges
     users for access to their BBS shall NOT be in violation of this
     paragraph.

     FidoNews 7-41                Page 9                    8 Oct 1990


     Implementation of cost recovery plans may vary greatly.  In
     general cost recovery plans should not be overly restrictive.

     6.  RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCES:  Participating Nodes
     shall honor and support the restrictions placed upon restricted
     distribution conferences.  Violation of this restriction by
     individual nodes and points shall be a violation of this echomail
     policy and result in suspension of the violated echo in
     accordance with the above paragraph in Section III Duties of the
     Echomail Conference Moderators.

     A Sysop-only conference shall be made available only to the
     Sysops or Co-Sysops of Fidonet or other nets with which inter-net
     conferences exist.

     A violation of the restrictions placed on a RESTRICTED
     DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCE will be a violation of this policy if and
     only if the moderator has posted and specified the restrictions
     governing the conference.

     7.  PATHLINE OPTION:  The PATHline (as defined in FTS-0004),
     originally implemented by SEA in the MGM package, is recommended
     for all nodes.  If your current Echomail scanner supports the
     pathline you should enable it.  While the pathline does not
     eliminate duplicate messages, it can be a very useful tool in
     determining where a topology problem exists.

     Systems operating as Echomail Stars, Backbone nodes, or Echomail
     Hubs must implement the PATHline option (as defined in FTS-0004
     within 30 days of adoption of this policy.  Since these system
     are operating beyond the scope of the typical FidoNet system,
     they are required to implement features that are otherwise
     optional.

     8.  SEEN-BY LINE:  Under the current technology and topology (the
     routing structure of echomail), SEEN-BY lines play an important
     part in reducing duplicate messages.  Tiny SEEN-BYs will not be
     allowed until the respective ZECs feel topology will allow their
     use.  Nor will the stripping of SEEN-BYs (except Zone-Gates and
     Inter-Network EchoGates) be allowed unless approved by the ZEC.

     Violation of the above shall be excessively annoying behavior
     enforceable under general Fidonet policy.  Zone-Gates and Inter-
     Network EchoGates SHOULD strip the SEEN-BYs of the exporting Zone
     or Network to reduce addressing conflicts.

     9.  COUNTERFEIT MESSAGES:  Entering or knowingly distributing
     counterfeit messages shall be considered excessively annoying and
     a violation of Fidonet policy enforceable under the terms of
     Fidonet policy.  As used in this paragraph, a counterfeit message
     is defined as any message entered using another person's name,
     handle or node address with the intent of deceiving others about
     the true author of the message.  No handles shall be used to
     enter messages to knowingly provoke, inflame, or upset
     participants in a conference with the purpose of deceiving others
     about the true identity of the author.

     10.  SYSOP'S RESPONSIBILITY:  It is the responsibility of each
     Sysop to make every reasonable effort to assure that the users on
     his board conform to the provisions of this policy document.  A
     Sysop may be held responsible for the acts of his users unless
     the Sysop can show that a reasonable attempt was made to conform
     to this policy document.

     11.  ECHOMAIL SOFTWARE:  Echomail software which does not conform
     to the minimum acceptable standards as defined by the Fidonet
     Technical Standards Committee (FTSC) shall lead to disciplinary
     action as described previously in this document.

     12.  HOST ROUTING OF ECHOMAIL:  Host routing of Echomail without
     the prior consent of both the Sending and Receiving Hosts shall
     lead to disciplinary action as described previously in this
     document.  See Section III.

     13.  INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCES:  It is the general policy of
     Fidonet to encourage the development of INTER-NETWORK
     CONFERENCES.  It shall be the duty of those providing the
     INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCE links to remove foreign net distribution
     identifiers which will adversely effect the distribution of the
     Echomail Conference while in Fidonet.  The INTER-NETWORK
     CONFERENCE links maintained in Fidonet shall be operated in a
     manner not to interfere with the foreign network's distribution
     of Echomail.  INTER-NETWORK CONFERENCE links maintained in
     FidoNet must also conform to General FidoNet Policy.

     14.  DEFAMATORY POSTING:  The posting of any DEFAMATORY MESSAGE
     other than in conferences dedicated to this purpose (i.e.  FLAME)
     shall lead to disciplinary action as described previously in this
     document.  See Section III.  The posting of substantiated facts
     shall not be considered a violation under this section.

     15.  ADDING OR REMOVING CONFERENCES FROM THE BACKBONE:

     A conference may be added to the Backbone only at the request of
     the RECOGNIZED Conference Moderator.  A conference must be
     registered with the Echolist Coordinator before it can be added
     to the Backbone.

     A conference may be removed from the Backbone by lack of traffic.

     The recognized conference moderator may, at their discretion,
     request removal from the backbone any conference that same
     moderator initially placed in backbone distribution.

     16.  TOPOLOGY and DUPLICATE MESSAGES:  Cross Regional links
     should be avoided as they increase the risk of improper linking
     and generation of duplicate messages.  Cross Regional links may
     only be established with the knowledge of the REC in both
     regions.  The REC must be notified prior to or at the time of the
     link being established.  If an REC determines that a cross
     regional link is contributing to the creation of duplicate
     messages, the REC may request that the link be terminated.

     FidoNews 7-41                Page 11                   8 Oct 1990


     The use of the PATHline option is required for all out of region
     links.

     If a sysop has a prior history of creating duplicate messages
     because of out of region links, the REC may require prior
     notification and approval before an out of region link can be
     established.

     Cross Regional links are permitted without notifcation if one of
     those systems is a dead-end.  Should the status of this link
     change, then notification is required.

     Each REC will do their best to make available high speed hubs,
     out of state hubs, PC Pursuit hubs, etc, to facilitate the low
     cost, efficient movement of mail within their respective Region.

     Any Sysop who willfully and knowingly establishes links that
     either create duplicate loops (topology that creates circular
     feeds) or who refuses to break such links upon request by their
     NEC, REC or ZEC shall be subject to disciplinary action as
     described previously in this document.  See Section III.

     17.  MESSAGE STANDARDS:  Until the adoption of a superceding
     standard by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee, the
     following Echomail message standards are recommended:

         a) Eight-bit characters (ASCII 128-255) and non-printing
         low-order codes (ASCII 2-31) are prohibited, except the
         use of 8Dh(soft <CR> character) per FTS-0004.  This is
         not intended to discourage participation of foreign
         zones or networks, which may permit said characters.
         Any echomail processor should pass information exactly
         as it was received, without stripping any non-standard
         characters.

         b) Origin lines should be limited to 79 characters
         including the required ending of a proper network
         address (i.e.  Zone:Net/Node.Point with zone and point
         being optional).

         c) Tear lines should be limited to 35 characters
         including the required "--- " lead-in.  These should
         only contain packer or editor program identification.
         Tear lines for message editors are discouraged.  If an
         editor adds a tear line, it should also add an origin
         line to avoid multiple tear lines.

         d) "Extra" origin lines (ZoneGating) are limited to
         essential information only.  This consists of the
         required lead-in plus the network name "Gateway" and
         optionally the software ID followed by a Zone:Net/Node
     FidoNews 7-41                Page 12                   8 Oct 1990


         address.  Example:  " * Origin:  FidoNet Gateway (TComm
         88:372/666)"

         e) SEEN-BY addresses should be in sorted order.
         Multiple AKA's are not allowed in SEEN-BY lines unless
         you have more than one address which processes mail.  Or
         for one month during change of an existing address (to
         avoid duplicates to the previous address).  Node 0
         addresses should not be used for echomail distribution.

         f) All current FTSC specifications must be followed.


     VI.  ENFORCEMENT

     Enforcement of this policy document shall be under the provisions
     of General FidoNet policy.  Complaints concerning Echomail
     violations defined under this policy may be filed by the
     aggrieved individual, the conference moderator or by any level of
     Echomail Coordinator to the appropriate *C level.  All complaints
     made pursuant to this policy must be made within 60 days of the
     date of occurrence or discovery.  Complaints shall be filed under
     the provisions of General Fidonet Policy, with a copy to the
     respective *EC.

     Enforcement is immediate, with any currently existing software
     allowed 60 days to conform (from the date EchoPol1 goes into
     effect).  A 30 day extension may be granted solely at the
     discretion of the ZEC if efforts to bring about compliance are
     clear.  Continued use of aberrant software after this period
     shall be deemed excessively annoying.


     VII.  ADOPTION OF POLICY

     1.  ADOPTION:  This policy shall become effective upon
     ratification by a simple majority of those voting.  Those
     eligible to vote shall be the IC, ZCs, RCs, NCs, ZECs, RECs, and
     NECs.  Those individuals holding more than one position can cast
     only one vote.

     2.  GRANDFATHER CLAUSE:  Within 60 days of adoption of this
     policy, moderators shall be appointed for all existing Echomail
     Conferences which do not now have a moderator.  Moderators shall
     be appointed by the ZEC from those volunteering as moderator or
     if no volunteer is available then the ZEC shall request and
     appoint a moderator for the conference.  In the case where more
     than one individual claims to be the conference moderator and no
     agreement can be reached, the ZEC may order the conference
     retired and ban the further use of the specific conference name.
     Failure of the individuals to retire the conference name shall be
     deemed excessively annoying behavior.

     VI.  BACKBONE STRUCTURE

     This section is for information purposes only.  It gives a plain
     English description of the current structure and operation of the
     Backbone.  The ZEC may change this structure without amending
     this document.

     At the top of the Echomail distribution network, there are
     systems commonly called Stars.  These systems are usually
     dedicated to passing Echomail.  The stars operate at the
     discretion and direction of the ZEC.  At the time of this writing
     there are 3 stars, each has a backup system/plan in the event of
     a failure. In general, the Stars link to one another and feed the
     RECs.

     The RECs are then responsible for distribution of the echomail
     within their Region.  Normally, the REC will feed the NECs in
     that region.

     The NEC is responsible for distribution of Echomail to the
     individual Sysops within a net.

     Note that the RECs and NECs can appoint Hubs to help in the
     distribution of Echomail.  That is, they do not have to directly
     feed the lower level.

     This is the distribution GOAL.  Because of less expensive phone
     rates and other reasons, this distribution method is not followed
     exactly.  Any change to the above requires agreement of the *EC's
     involved.  All *ECs will use all the tools at their disposal,
     such as hubs, high speed modems, ROA, Wide Area Calling plans, PC
     Pursuit, corporate sponsorship, etc., to provide fast, efficient,
     and cost effective movement of echomail.

     Dave "who likes to jump out of airplanes" Appel
     Just a user on 1:231/30

     [bych mode on]
          Personally, I'm getting sick and tired of all the non-
     computer-related articles appearing in FidoNews.  Especially
     the ones by the eco-freaks, the left-wing-commie-pinko-
     conspiracy-theorists, either side of the abortion issue, and
     30K .GIF files of some stranger's ugly mug. (However, an
     occasional missing child announcement is fine by me.)  If you
     can't relate it to computers, or the network, find someplace
     else to publish it, please.  I even prefer bashing/defending
     the editor about LHARC versus ARC than the completely off-topic
     junk.
     [bych mode off]

          Well, here's how conservation CAN be applied by computer
     users.  Print on both sides of the paper.

          As an arch-conservative anal-retentive capitalist pig I
     see it as a way to save dollars on my paper costs.  Bottom
     line, you know.  For you tree-hugging vegetarian
     environmentally correct eco-geeks, you might even save a few
     trees so you can continue your smug sense of moral superiority.

          There are several utilities that are specific to certain
     printers or to certain word processing packages.  There are
     even utilities to split text files into 2 files, one containing
     odd-number pages, and the other containing even-number pages.

          An example of such an "evironmentally conscious" (cost
     conscious to me) utility is 4PRINT for the HP LaserJet.  It
     prints 4 66-line pages per sheet of paper, 2 each, front and
     back. You have to run the paper through twice. It's shareware.

          Some word processors such as XYWRITE have built-in macros
     for printing odd and even pages.

          The LaserJet IID prints on both sides of the paper, but
     not many people have these printers.  For the rest of us, we
     need to print the odd pages, turn the paper around, feed it
     back into the printer, then print the even pages.

          The lazy way that I used to print documentation was to:
                      COPY myfile.DOC LPT1

          Since I decided to do double sided printing, I always
     bring the doc file into my word processor and print it from
     there, where I have control over which pages to print.

          MS-Word 5.0 doesn't have a built-in macro to do this so I
     wrote my own.  Here it is:

     FidoNews 7-41                Page 15                   8 Oct 1990


      <Ctrl PgDn><up><up><Ctrl Esc>jp[SET lastpage = field]<Esc>
      [ASK pageno=?Enter starting page]
      [WHILE pageno <= lastpage]
      <Ctrl Esc>po<down><down><down><down>p<right>[pageno]
      <enter><enter>
      [SET pageno=pageno+2]
      [ENDWHILE]

          You need to substitute the "[" and "]" symbols with the
     chevrons by pressing Control-[ and Control-].  (The chevrons
     are special characters, 174 and 175, that ARTSPEC.DOC says not
     to include in FidoNews articles.)  You can store this macro in
     your macro glossary. Load your paper, run the macro, tell it
     page "1", when the printing is done, reload the paper
     backwards, run the macro, tell it page "2".

          If you do everything right, and your printer doesn't jam,
     you just cut your paper usage in half, with only about an extra
     42.5 seconds of effort.  If something goes wrong, like a
     printer jam, or you re-edit the document in between printing
     the two sides (thereby shifting the page breaks), you just
     screwed up the whole thing, wasted even more time, and wasted
     more paper than you were going to save in the first place.

          Another benefit of two-sided printing is that when the
     document becomes obsolete, you aren't tempted to keep it around
     as clutter hoping to someday use the blank side as scrap paper.
     You can chuck the whole thing with the satisfaction of knowing
     that you squeezed every last use out of it, or you can even
     (*gasp*) recycle it.

     FidoNet 4:4/0
                        General Elections in Zone 4
                     Elecciones Generales en la Zona 4
                         Eleicoes Gerais na Zona 4

        As the result of an agreement reached by ZC4 and the rest of
     Zone 4's coordinators, on November 9th 1990 the members of
     FidoNet Zone 4 "Latin America" will be able to vote for the
     renovation of the whole coordination structure of the zone, and
     elect Network coordinators, Region coordinators and Zone
     coordinator.

     The procedures defined for the democratic election process are
     the following:

      - All the FidoNet members will be able to present themselves as
     candidates to a single coordination position, by sending netmail
     to Elecciones at node 4:4/444 until October 20th, stating the
     position they intend to run for.

      - On October 21st, the list of all candidates will be published
     on the official echomail conference LATIN.SYSOP and on October
     22nd, on FidoNews. From then until the voting closes on November
     9th, the candidates will be able to debate ideas on the
     LATIN.SYSOP echo, as well as on the other region and local
     sysops' echomail conferences.

      - From October 22nd until November 9th, all the members of
     FidoNet Zone 4 will be able to vote for the different candidates
     -voting for a someone that is not a candidate will void the
     entire ballot- for the domain where the member is registered (for
     example, a FidoNet member in Net 900 can vote for NC 900, RC 90
     and ZC 4), and they will do so by sending a message to Elecciones
     at node 4:4/444, whose subject will be a special "secret
     password" and the text will indicate the different choices. THE
     VOTE IS SECRET, AND ITS CONTAINTS WILL NEVER BE REVEALED. This is
     an example of how a ballot must be issued:

                                                 secret password

                        FIDOCON 1990 - ZONE 5

     Held on 7 September 1990 to 9 September 1990

     It is with great pleasure, that I will try and give you a
     summary of what actually happened at FidoCon 1990!  Yes, you
     would ask, what was the fuzz all about, but let me tell you, it
     was a great thrill to meet and actually see the faces behind the
     messages, that we so often take for granted.

     First and foremost, I would like to thank Grahamstown, and
     particularly the Rhodes people, for their hospitality, and all
     the arrangements they made, to please all the delegates, that
     attended the convention...the very first held on the African
     continent!

     At 08:00, we all got registered for the convention, and everybody
     start to take there seats, while the camera-man puts up his video
     equipment to record everything to be said and done.

     First of all, we had Henk Wolsink, our Zone 5 Coordinator,
     opening the very first convention, in Zone 5. He introduced
     himself, and mentioned the fact that two speakers couldn't make
     it. They were Anthony Walker and Stephan Davies. Fortunately,
     Anthony knew beforehand, that he would probably not make it, and
     made a video tape, for all to watch, during the convention. He
     was also the chairman for the first session till tea time.

     He then talked a bit about the history of FidoNet, and particular
     , how it started in Southern Africa. He also mentioned how
     FidoNet grew throughout the world, and how it affected sysops in
     Zone 5.

     Then he introduced the Grand Daddy of FidoNet Zone5, Bryan
     Haefele, who gave a thorough speech about the history of FidoNet
     in the now called Zone 5 area. It is just a pitty that this
     speech was not recorded properly, as the sound of the video
     camera, was not on for this and the next session...but never the
     less, the people that were there, would hopefully not forget the
     history lesson.

     Pat Terry, better known to his students as Professor Terry, gave
     us a very in depth insight on UFGATE, and how the interfaces
     between UNIX boxes and FidoNet works. He also talked about the
     specific connections between zone 1 and zone 5, where Randy Bush
     was providing the porting of UNIX networks to the zone 1
     zonegate, then sending it to Rhodes, using the normal FidoNet
     dial-up links.

     Then we had tea...and I got lost while trying to find the lecture
     room again :-)

     After tea, and discovering that the camera failed to record sound
     of the previous session, Pat Terry, the chairman of the second
     session, introduced Randy Bush, the main speaker of the
     convention.

     Pat mentioned about his relationship with Randy, and how he got
     stuck into Modula-2, first with the Apple II computers, and
     later the bigger buggers.

     Randy started off with, a bit of history (again:-) on FidoNet,
     but talked about Tom Jennings, the father of FidoNet, and how
     FidoNet started, with his program called Fido (because it was
     such a dog of a program <grin>). Randy mentioned when he got
     involved, and mentioned Ben Baker, also one of the pioneers of
     the olden days.

     He talked about how regions, and later zones started all over the
     world, to reduce cost mainly as well as to make distribution more
     effective. Echomail was also mentioned and how the first echo's
     came about.

     IFNA was also mentioned, and what the reason was, why it was
     started. Echomail wars also started, and IFNA eventually
     collapsed.

     He then mentioned the fact that many non-clone machines were used
     to port FidoNet software, and those users writing their own
     software, etc.

     Politics power and policy, is probably one of the biggest
     problems in FidoNet, Randy mentioned. Zone 5 will have to get
     more countries connected, so as to change perspective of the rest
     of the FidoNet world.

     He talked about all the various zones, and how they operated.
     Also the fact that zone 3 will split up in to zone 3 and 6 in a
     friendly manner, also to concentrate the mail links, etc. Zone 4
     has a big problem financially, while zone 2 seems the most
     organised.

     He then also talked about various other networks, and the fact
     that FidoNet addressing, were not very intelligent, compared to
     UUCP, etc.  For instance, sending a message to
     USA.ORIGON.PORTLAND.RANDY would make more sense, than sending
     it to 1:105/42! This makes sense to me, but might not to others,
     etc.

     Bitnet, was for instance based on the IBM proprietary protocols,
     using 7 bit data bytes, etc.  USENET is not a network, and all
     networks receiving USENET news files, actually belongs to USENET,
     like FidoNet!

     FidoNews 7-41                Page 21                   8 Oct 1990


     Internet was also discussed, and RFC's a bit explained, as well
     as the current FTS documents, which are to become RFC's
     eventually.

     Vic Shaw, of the FRD, was then summoned to give his talk on
     Uninet. He explained, that the relation between Uninet and
     Fidonet was excellent. Uninet's mission is to, development,
     implementation and promotion of an academic and research computer
     network in Southern Africa. This means, that it's intended for
     use by Universities, and higher education institutions, etc.
     This network, is of course sponsored by the FRD (Federation for
     Research and Development).

     He then gave credit to FidoNet, which made UNINET into what it is
     today, although, FidoNet (Zone 5) got quite a few benefits,
     financially, from Uninet as well.

     Anthony Walker's tape was then played, where he gave us a chat
     about his COMNET system, and how it is interfaced with BELTEL,
     the local prestel dailup system, operated by the P&T.

     We all, then partook in a general discussion, about FidoNet in
     general, and ways and means in expanding FidoNet, to the lower
     levels, like schools, etc.

     Lunch was then served at the 1820 Settlers Monument building.

     The Chairman for the afternoon, was Dave Pedler, who is the
     region 49 Coordinator. He introduced himself, and talked about
     how zone 5's *C sysops were elected and appointed, when Zone 5
     got off the ground in September 1989, etc.

     Henk Wolsink, our Zone 5 Coordinator, was then called to give his
     talk about Zone 5, and how it started, etc. The discussion then
     also turned to why and when points and super users (users using
     Silver Xpress or XRS) are used, the pros and cons thereof.

     I then stepped in to give a chat on how echomail links are
     connected throughout Zone 5 and the rest of the world. We also
     discussed a bit of history on Zone 5, and what made echomail to
     be 'magic'.

     All Zone 5 *C sysops then gathered at the Hotel (Not to drink
     :-), but to discuss various aspects of the network, mostly
     difficult to sort out over the network itself.

       1. We basically decided that Henk should keep on being the ZC
          for Zone 5 for another year, unless someone has a complaint
          about him:-)

       2. We also decided, not to allow a Beltel gateway for FidoNet,
     FidoNews 7-41                Page 22                   8 Oct 1990


          unless it is going to be READ-ONLY on the BELTEL side.

       3. Changing of echo tags like ECHOMAIL, which was always
          confusing to users.

       4. We also decided to follow Randy Bush's advice in changing
          pick-up and poll times for echomail, excluding the zonegate.
          This will have a drastic effect on the turnaround time of
          all echomail in Zone 5.

     We then drank ourselves, under the table, while the other crowed
     looked at the Rhodes computer equipment, until the dinner in the
     same Hotel. No, not really, we just sat there waiting for them
     :-)

     And so the day came to a halt? No, we still had a very nice
     dinner, and it carried on till very late. We had some photo
     sessions, we even had food! Very nice too, although, I can't
     remember what we ate, as it was more interesting to chat to each
     other, about...PC's and computers and FidoNet and BBS's...what
     else? :-)

     Anyway, to rap it up, I personally think it was a great success,
     and I would like to thank each and everyone, attending FidoCon
     1990. I sure hope to see you all, and many more, with the next
     FidoCon.

     Also great thanks to Rhodes, for hosting the convention, and for
     the FRD, who sponsored Randy's visit to our Zone. Also many
     thanks to Randy to take the trouble in getting the FidoCon...
     great to have had you here, Randy!

                      HOMESCHOOL - WHO WOULD DO THAT!

     A Home Schooling Echo Conference (HOMESCHL) is available on the
     backbone.  There are many reasons for educating children at home.
     In fact, there are more reasons for educating children at home
     than there are parents.

     Who teaches their children at home?  There are families who
     travel or are living overseas.  Some think there is too much or
     too little religion in the public schools.  Some live too far out
     even for school buses to reach them.  Still others think that
     learning and education are two separate activities.  Large
     families, families with an only child, single parents, the rich,
     the poor, professors and high school drop-outs, atheists and fun-
     damentalists, capitalists and socialists  --- the only things
     homeschoolers seem to have in common is a particularly strong
     (but varying) view of the importance of their families and a com-
     mitment to that oldest form of education - learning at home.

     The laws regarding home schooling vary from state to state and
     are always changing.  Basically, it is legal.  Some localities
     require curriculum plans filed with school boards and overseen by
     certified teachers.  Others only require an attendance sheet
     (after all, only school attendance is mandated).  Alaska provides
     home schools with materials and California provides assistance
     from the local school district; but in most states, you are on
     your own.  Some states require testing or external evaluations.
     Children who re-enter traditional schools have been doing quite
     well.

     This echo is available for all who wish to share ideas, support
     one another, ask questions and answer them, adults and
     "students".  Child development issues, curricula and methods of
     dealing with the legal requirements from state to state have all
     come up for discussion.  (Arguments about religion, politics not
     relating to homeschool issues or  the role of public education
     already have their own echoes and need not call in here.)  If you
     have a child, may some day have a child, know a child or were a
     child and ever learned or wished to learn anything, homeschooling
     might interest you.

     There have been several local echoes across the country dealing
     with home schools and we are trying to unite them.  Voice mes-
     sages can reach us in the evening (Central Time) at (414)722-
     4046.

                        Loglan Language, Loglan Echo

         I recently became involved with learning the Loglan language
     and I decided to support  the Loglan Institute by submitting  an
     article about the language in FIDONEWS.  James Cooke Brown,  the
     creator  of  Loglan  has  given  me  permission  to  upload  the
     following article.  I have also created a one node ECHO for  "lo
     logli" (loglan people) called as you probably guessed LOGLAN. It
     is available at 1:153/713.

         I first heard of Loglan in R.A.Heinlein's book  "The Moon Is
     A Harsh Mistress".  When I saw their advertisement in Scientific
     American magazine,  I immediately called the Institute and asked
     for a price list.  When the list came I sent away for just about
     everything.  I am now in the process of learning the language.

         If you are  interested in Loglan,  please contact me  or the
     Institute.

     Rob Duff 1:153/713

                            What is Loglan?[1]

         Loglan[2] is a speakable, human language originally designed
     to serve  as  a test  of  the Sapir-Whorf  hypothesis  that  the
     structure of local human  languages places local constraints  on
     the development of human thought, and hence, on human  cultures.
     If this hypothesis is correct,  a language which "lifted"  those
     constraints--that is to say, which  reduced them to some  formal
     minimum--should in a certain sense "release" the human mind from
     these ancient linguistic  bonds and, in  any case, have  notable
     effects on both individual thinking and on the development of  a
     global human culture.

         Since its original development in the late 1950's and 1960's
     Loglan has  acquired  certain  other  properties  that  make  it
     interesting to  computer  science,  principally  (1)  its  total
     freedom from syntactic ambiguity. This feature of the  language,
     together with  with (2)  its audio-visual  "isomorphism"  (which
     means that the Loglan speechstream breaks up automatically  into
     fully  punctuated  strings  of  separate  words)  and  (3)   its
     borrowing  algorithm  (by  which  the  International  Scientific
     Vocabulary goes into  Loglan virtually ad  libitum) makes it  an
     ideal medium for three  uses: (i) for international  information
     storage and retrieval,   (ii)  for   machine-aided   translation
     between     natural  languages,   and  (iii)   for   spontaneous
     interaction between computer-users and their machines.  Finally,
     Loglan is (4)  culturally and politically  neutral in the  sense
     that its basic  predicate vocabulary has  been engineered to  be
     maximally memorable to speakers of the eight most widely  spoken
     languages: English,  Chinese, Hindi,  Russian, Spanish,  French,
     Japanese and German.

     FidoNews 7-41                Page 25                   8 Oct 1990


         All these  features taken  together have  suggested to  many
     loglanists that  their adopted  language  is ideally  suited  to
     become a second language for the world. For others, conducting a
     scientific test  of the  Whorf hypothesis  with Loglan  has  the
     highest  priority.     For  still   others,  its   use  at   the
     human/machine interface is the most challenging role for  Loglan
     in the years ahead.

     On October 27, 1989, a new, MacIntosh oriented network was
     formed.  Named the 'MacIntosh Alternative Connection List',
     MACLIST was established in the last remaining single-digit
     Zone address, Zone 6.

     The current MACLIST nodelist is available to all interested.
     Just file request 'MACLIST.ARC' from 1:107/554 or 1:269/102.

     Why was MACLIST formed?  There are several reasons we decided
     to form the MacIntosh Alternative Connection List.  Here are
     some that inspired us to form MACLIST:

       o  The MacIntosh is rapidly entering the world of computer
          networking.  MacIntoshes are located in many different
          networks, but how to find them?  The MACLIST nodelist
          is a centralized source for you to communicate with
          other MacIntoshes - simply compile the MACLIST nodelist!

       o  The MacIntosh community has many unique aspects.  The
          MACLIST is a network for Mac sysops, and their users,
          to join together and address MacIntosh issues that
          affect us all, examine the technology, discuss topics
          and disseminate information of interest to the
          MacIntosh community.

       o  Need a MacIntosh echo connection?  Files?  Looking for
          'Mac compatibility' (SEAlink transfer protocols and
          WaZOO FREQs)?  Check MACLIST for a system near you ...
          the MacIntosh Alternative Connection, an independent
          network on the move.

     If you are running a MacIntosh system, or a system dedicated
     to MacIntosh users (the MACLIST is not necessarily composed
     100% of systems that are physically running on MacIntoshes,
     but a member must have a system dedicated/oriented to the
     MacIntosh user), and are interested in joining the MACLIST,
     please contact one of us at our addresses listed below!

     If you are interested in MACLIST, you might want to get a
     MACSYSOP feed to keep in touch with other Mac sysops.  In
     the summer of 1990, MACSYSOP was added to the "Fidonet
     Backbone", so it should be available in your local network.
     If it is not, please contact one of us below and we'll help
     you locate a source.  You do not have to carry MACSYSOP to
     be a member in MACLIST.

     Here are our answers to some of the questions we have been
     receiving:

     Q: Why did you chose Zone 6 for MACLIST?
     A: The Tabby mailer for the MacIntosh does not have the
        capability to use two-digit zone addresses.  We therefore
        do not have a choice in Zone selection.  Zone 6 is the
        last remaining unoccupied single-digit Zone address, and
        we do not wish to intrude on another network's Zone or
        encounter the technical problems associated with a
        'shared Zone'.  It is our hope that 'Other Nets' will
        respect our position and recognize why MACLIST is
        occupying Zone 6.  After Tabby 3.0 is released September
        30th, 1990 and is being generally used, we will move to
        another Zone as Tabby 3.0 supports zones up to 32767.

     Q: What do I have to do to become a member of MACLIST?
     A: Run a BBS/system that caters to the MacIntosh community
        and is accessable via some form of mailer that is FTSC
        compatible. It does NOT matter what hardware or software
        you use as long as you support the Mac.  Just send a
        message to one of us at the addresses listed below.

     Q: Is membership in MACLIST free?
     A: Yes.

     Q: If I do not join MACLIST will it be hard for me to get
        some Mac echoes?
     A: MACLIST does not have any echoes based in it. In other
        words NOT being a member of MACLIST will NEVER stop you
        from getting an echo.  We believe that the MACLIST will
        actually ASSIST you in finding systems that carry any or
        all of the MANY currently existing MacIntosh echos.

     Q: Will I have to use my MACLIST node number?
     A: MACLIST is NOT a 'replacement' for other networks. You
        do not have to use your MACLIST node number as a primary
        node address. It does not have to even appear in your
        origin line.  As a matter of fact, you must have a
        "primary" address in some other network (such as Fidonet
        or Alternet) before joining MACLIST.  You might want to
        make MACLIST an AKA on your system.

     Q: Will joining this network cause problems for me in any
        other networks?
     A: It should not, as there have been software and hardware
        specific Networks for a long time with no problem, with
        participants in multiple networks.  DOS-based boards
        have been using nets like this all along (for example,
        PNET, QNET, RBBS-Net).  Each is means of communication
        and support for a particular interest group, just as
     FidoNews 7-41                Page 28                   8 Oct 1990


        MACLIST is oriented to the MacIntosh community.

     Q: Why have you added the MACSYSOP echo to the "Fidonet
        Backbone" after so many months of successful distribution
        off the backbone?
     A: At the time MACLIST was formed in October of 1989, we chose
        the MACSYSOP Echo rather than some other echo because at
        the time MACSYSOP was not a Fidonet, Alternet (or any other
        net) echo.  After many requests by various Mac sysops, we
        placed it on the backbone to make it more available to those
        that wanted a link.

     Looking forward to bringing the MacIntosh community
     together,

     OtherNet News - 10/05/90

     Welcome to the third edition of the OTHERNET nodelist.  As you may
     have noted in OTHERNET.271, the 69LIST (Adult Links, Zone 69) and
     OPCNLIST (Official Public Computer Network, Zone 11 segment) node-
     lists were deleted from the OTHERNET Nodelist.  GhotiNet (Zones
     60-61) will not be included due to a request for permission for
     inclusion being denied.

     OtherNets will be added to OTHERNET.xxx on an on-going basis only
     if permission is formally granted.  Permission to continue to
     include those OtherNets included in OTHERNET.271 will be sought.
     I'm happy to say that as of OTHERNET.278, inclusion of MetroNet
     (Zone 200) has been formally obtained.  Thanks and hats off to
     Jason Steck (MetroNet ZC) for his support and participation! ;-)

     If it turns out that the OTHERNET nodelist is more hassle than it
     is worth, or if someone begins to politicize this nodelist, I'll
     simple pull it out of the public domain and consider it a dead
     project.  Hopefully this will not happen, as my netmail area has
     been full of comments and congrats from people who find OTHERNET
     to be very useful.  Thanks to all for their supportive comments.

     The OTHERNETS echo is well under-way, with thirteen systems linked
     into 269/111.  Hopefully there will be more interest generated,
     and we can begin to submit the echo to those networks that have
     "backbones" for a wider and more convenient distribution.

     Thanks to all of you who have been supportive of the OTHERNET
     nodelist, OTHERNETS echo, and have provided me with information
     and nodelists.  I appreciate it!  We'll all benefit from the info
     that is being shared about OtherNets.
