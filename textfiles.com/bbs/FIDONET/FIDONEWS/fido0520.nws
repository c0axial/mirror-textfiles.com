     From   : Steve Sherwick, Coordinator of Net 282
     Date   : 05/13/1988
     To     : All FIDONET SysOps
     Subject: 282/1, The Midwest Echo Star

          As the coordinator of Net 282, The Twin Cities Area Metronet
     it has fallen to me to try to explain the whys and wherefores  of
     the  status  of  282/1  also known  as  the  Midwest  Echo  Star.
     Unfortunately this information is quite limited.

          Please  be assured, we in Net 282 are just as upset as  much
     of  the nation is at this time due to the disruption of  echomail
     flow. I will be as blunt about this point as I can be. 282/1 will
     NOT be returning to the net and the Midwest Echo Star is down for
     good.

          On  the up side of that note it appears that  the  excellent
     management  of the echo portion of the net has responded  quickly
     and echomail is returning to normal flow.

          It  is  the  consensus  of the SysOps  in  the  Twin  Cities
     Metronet  that  it  is in the best interests of the  net  to  not
     respond  to Netmail information requests concerning the SysOp  of
     282/1 at this time. Please accept this note as our assurance that
     we at this time have no information that we can release and  that
     when we can release a full disclosure will be made.

          While we are interested in anything that the net may produce
     as  far  as  information concerning 282/1  and  it's  SysOp  John
     Richard  as  well as his whereabouts we have  been  deluged  with
     requests concerning the return of 282/1 as an echomail hub. As  I
     said, this will not occur.

          We  highly advise looking into new links, Butch  Walker  and
     his  troops  are hard at work relinking the system and  once  the
     help  nodes go back into the nodelist  the echomail  coordinators
     are ready to help you out.

          Any  information  you  might care to share  should  be  sent
     marked  private  in  netmail only to either the  SysOp  of  282/0
     (Myself,  running  NMH -1 to NMH +1) or crash to Don  Seiford  at
     282/3. We are deeply interested.


          We thank you for your concern,

          Steve Sherwick

     Ed Ridpath
     FidoNet 1:372/2.0

                       Why the FidoNet is Still Fun!

     I've recently rejoined the FidoNet and IFNA after an absence of
     about a year.  I missed the fun of the FidoNet and Sysoping
     greatly, and I'm very enthusiastic about being involved again.
     This has to be the most interesting hobby I've ever come across.
     I recently read an article here in to FidoNews where some one
     felt differently, and thought that there was no more fun in the
     FidoNet.  Not so, the Fidonet is still fun!

     I can remember the first time I saw a FidoNet mail session.  It
     was like magic.  I  had entered a message in the mail area of my
     Fido BBS requesting a Net/Node number from the Regional
     Coordinator of Region 18.  Yes, I did get up at 4:00am to make
     sure this thing worked.  The call went flawlessly from Fido to
     Fido (that was the only thing that did mail then) and I was in
     the FidoNet.  The ability to send electronic mail back and forth
     between BBSs I still don't take for granted.   There is always a
     thrill when I see two computers transferring mail all by
     themselves.  With the continuous mail features of many new
     FidoNet software packages, I don't even have to get up in the wee
     hours to see it.  Now this is excitement!

     I'm also a devout EchoMail junkie.  The combined information
     available through all the users and sysops is incredible.  Sure,
     you have to stick to the smaller, more specialized conferences to
     get a good percentage of worthwhile info.  These smaller
     conferences also have the advantage of getting to know some of
     the people better, and form a more cohesive group.   There is
     something just plain neat about entering a message here in
     Charleston, SC, USA and getting replies from Europe, Australia,
     or Atlanta, GA.

     I also like to see my computer not only get used, but pushed to
     the limit.  To see it available for use all day, watch it crunch
     on EchoMail, and see it transfer files and messages, is some how
     satisfying.  It's also an adventure, getting the latest whiz-bang
     NetMail software to work right without doing something that
     causes a great uproar on the board or my part of the net.
     Getting new hardware online to increase the mail efficiency can
     be quite challenging also.  I'm not alone though, and there are
     lots of people in the net that are willing to help, if I just ask
     nicely.

     I think another proof of the magnetism of the Net is the old
     faces that are back.  I'm not going to name them all here, but
     there are many people who were instrumental in the beginnings of
     the net who have returned.  I can remember them leaving, very
     unhappy with what they saw, and now some of them are not only
     back on the nodelist, but very actively involved in the FidoNet
     and IFNA.

     So, I don't know about you, but this sysop plans on sticking

     around for the fun and frolic of the FidoNet for some time to
     come.

     D'Bridge - A new commercial EMAIL package
     Chris Irwin, 1:135/68


     D'Bridge is a fully "Fidonet-compatable" EMAIL system for the IBM
     PC.  It is a commercial package designed to facilitate electronic
     mail and file transfer in a friendly, menu-driven user interface.
     I have tried to create a system which is both powerful and easy
     to use.  Mainly designed for "corporate" use, D'Bridge is also
     capable of acting as a front-end for bulletin board systems and
     other EMAIL receivers.

     D'Bridge was released on May 15th and is priced at a reasonable
     $79.00 for a "soft" copy.  Complete information and a "30-day
     demonstration copy" are available from our support BBS in Miami.
     On the leading edge of EMAIL technology, D'Bridge has all of the
     "standard" features that you would expect from an commercial mail
     system, and many unique to "UltraTek" systems.  To name a few...

       - Advanced full-screen editor with macros and block commands
       - Complete Fidonet/WaZOO compatability
       - Uses ZMODEM, SEAlink, Telink and XMODEM
       - ZMODEM has 32 bit CRCs and aborted file recovery
       - Runs stand-alone; no other software required
       - Complete "point" support with a 4-dimensional nodelist
       - Supports WaZOO and SEAdog file/update-requests
       - Excellent security system
       - Complete cost-accouting (shows actual)
       - Complete 4-dimensional routing language
       - Weekly scheduling of mail events and DOS commands
       - Provides a unique "SERVICE-REQUEST" feature
       - Can also be the "front-end" for other EMAIL receivers
       - Powerful scripting language for alternate carriers (like PCP)
       - Free updates available;  always available for file-request.
       - Much, much more - get the DEMO version and see!

     I'd tell you more, but I wanted to keep this article to one page.
     If you use Fidonet technology in your workplace, then I'm sure
     that you'll find D'Bridge is the best EMAIL system on the market
     today...

     FidoNews 5-20                Page 5                   16 May 1988


     Jeff Sheese, Washington DC
     Fidonet 1:109/714.0 and 1:109/714.2
     Good Egg Net 99:9200/1.0 and 99:9200/1.2

         In September 1985 when I became the net host for the newly
     formed Net 110 in Dayton Ohio I was amazed to see the nodelist
     gently pushing toward the 2000 node limit for Fido v11w.  What
     was even more amazing is that these nodes not only covered the
     continental United States but also Europe, Asia and Australia.
     Now it's a common weekly occurrence to see at least 3000 nodes
     being reported by my favorite nodelist compiler.

         Just recently I was stunned to hear that our International
     Coordinator had to prune comments and other information in order
     to produce the nodelist for Friday April 29.  This should be
     common knowledge by time this article is published in Fidonews.
     What troubles me more is that nodes marked as private as well as
     certain hubs may have to be pruned to prevent MAKENL from
     choking on more nodes thereby preventing new node numbers from
     being assigned, especially with the existing RBBS-PC, QuickBBS
     and PC-Board systems gaining netmail capabilities.  I'd really
     hate to see someone from being listed in the nodelist simply
     because the software that's used to generate the nodelist has
     met certain technical limitations.

         I'm nervously awaiting to hear flames about this, but you
     CAN'T blame the software.  Wasn't it Bob Hartman who said in the
     BINKLEY echo that "software and hardware are not infallible,
     especially when used together!".  What should happen instead is
     that the great minds currently keeping our heads above water
     should work on a better system.  I realize that they're doing
     this now, so I'd like to throw a few ideas to them.  Heck,
     everyone needs as much help as they can get without hearing
     everyone cry for results!

     THE PROBLEM:
         One problem is that new node number assignments have been
     frozen since MAKENL is choking on the size of the final
     nodelist.  This nodelist contains not only Zone 1 for North
     America, but also Zones 2 and 3 covering Europe and Asia
     respectively.  I'd hate to see the new node assignments frozen
     because of this limitation.  I'd also not like the fact that
     this may prevent the addition of other zones from South America
     and Africa.

         Another problem is that the St. Louis format nodelist as
     published takes up more than 250k disk space.  Compile the
     nodelist and it creates one or more data files that almost equal
     in size.  If you use Fido v11w you wind up with the St.  Louis
     nodelist, NODELIST.BBS and at least two more data files after
     compilation.  Total the amount of disk space and if you don't
     clean up after the nodelist compiler your nodelist and related
     data files result in almost 1 meg of disk space.

     ONE SOLUTION:
         This isn't the final solution, just a suggestion.  This
     FidoNews 5-20                Page 6                   16 May 1988


     suggestion may even be partially combined with other suggestions
     to make a workable solution that everyone can work with.

         How about the idea of a ZONELIST in lieu of a NODELIST.
     Most nodelist processors and compilers allow the combining of
     one or more nodelists.  By restricting a zonelist to one zone
     including zonegates to other zones the size of each zonelist
     will be reduced to facilitate production of all the zonelists.
     These ZONELIST's with their respective ZONEDIFF's can be
     distributed along the same paths as the current NODEDIFF's.

         This would allow everyone to maintain communication to nodes
     within their zone and communicate with zonegates as needed, as
     well as include other zonelists in their nodelist compilation as
     necessary.

     IMPLEMENTATION:
         The names of the zonelists are important since not every
     nodelist processor or FTSC compatible mailer program has the
     feature of using differently named nodelists.  XLATLIST v2.86,
     Copyrighted by System Enhancements Association, has the ability
     to include one or more nodelists whether they use the name
     NODELIST.### or not with the PUBLIST statements.

         I propose that the zonelists be distributed under two names
     for each list.  I propose that the zonelists for zones 1, 2 and
     3 used the following name conventions:

     Zone                 ZoneLIST       ZoneDIFF
     --------------       --------       --------
     Fidonet Zone 1   -   FNZ1LIST   -   FNZ1DIFF
     Fidonet Zone 2   -   FNZ2LIST   -   FNZ2DIFF
     Fidonet Zone 3   -   FNZ3LIST   -   FNZ3DIFF
     Fidonet Zone X   -   FNZXLIST   -   FNZXDIFF

         To maintain compatibility with existing setups the required
     zonelist as shown above can be distributed under the name
     NODELIST.A## and NODEDIFF.A## within each zone.  The other
     zonelists may be distributed under the above listed names or be
     made file requestable by those that need them.

         This will allow the nodelists for each zone to be small
     enough in size to allow processing, with the advantage of using
     existing software to add the extra lists to the locally produced
     nodelist.  To add the lists with XLATLIST v2.86 you only need to
     add the following lines to your XLATLIST.CTL file:

     publist NODELIST NODEDIFF
     publist FNZXLIST FNZXDIFF
     .
     .
     .

         If your using PARSELST v1.0 which does not yet support the
     'publist' statement you can:

     FidoNews 5-20                Page 7                   16 May 1988


     1.  Use XLATLIST v2.86 as described above to update all
         zonelists with the required zonediffs.  Also use the
         NONODELIST option to prevent generation of NODELIST.BBS.

     2.  Use the batch file command "DayNbr Copy FNZXLIST.@###
         FNZXLIST.LST".

     3.  Use PARSELST v1.0 with the command "mylist FNZXLIST.LST" in
         the PARSELST.CFG file.

     IN CONCLUSION:
         A change like this cannot take place overnight, but may
     prove to be either an interim or long term solution.  Regardless
     of what the 'powers that be' decide on something must be done in
     order to prevent assignments of new node numbers from being
     frozen.  If anyone disagrees with the concept of distributing
     the zonediffs separately, through the use of batch file commands
     the zonediffs may be distributed in the current distribution of
     'NODEDIFF.A##'.  Whatever solution is agreed upon should be
     designed to meet as many needs as possible.

                              Are You Afraid


     How  many  times  have you thought about writing an  article  for
     either  the Fido News or Opus Gazette,  or any other news  letter
     you may have been reading.  This is a difficult task, and in many
     cases  some of you have not done so.   I would like to  offer  to
     SySops and Users a little way to get around the hassle of writing
     a lengthly article or column.

     I  have established a ECHO MESSAGE AREA where you may post pieces
     which you would like to see printed in a news letter.   This area
     is called Local,  Regional,  National News Items.  For you sysops
     who would like to join in this echo, the title is LRN-NEWS, it is
     available from 301/1.  I only ask that no more than one node from
     each net request pickup.

     I  do  not intend to replace or compete with either  of  the  two
     major  news letter for our network.   I would just like to see  a
     place where we can post such items as:

            1.  Birthday Announcements.
            2.  Systems Going Down, or Up.

                     NEW ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE CREATED


     A new echo called AVICULTURE has been created. It covers all
     topics related to birds.

     Have you ever wondered ...
     What kind of bird was easiest to teach to speak?
     What is the easiest one to teach tricks?
     What you should feed your pet bird to keep it in top health?
     Where to find rare birds?
     How can to find a good vet who knows about birds?
     How to get your pet birds to breed?

     The answers to these and other questions are given in a spirit
     of helpful cooperation in the AVICULTURE echo. We are a group
     of bird lovers who have birds as pets and / or breed birds.
     Our goal is to share our knowledge and experiences to the
     benefit of both birds and pet owners. We are looking for like
     minded people to help spread the word.

     Any interested Sysops can pick up this echo from:

      1:13/33  Avi-Technic BBS           Sysop: Tom Hendricks
     1:120/85  Charlie's Roost BBS       Sysop: Joe Elser

     We look forward to hearing from you all soon!
