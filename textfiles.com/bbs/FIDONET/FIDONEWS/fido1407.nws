     As I write this Issue's editorial, it is the 11th anniversary of the
     invention of Echomail by the now infamous Jeff Rush. Echomail is now
     the reason why many people belong to FidoNet. What a concept!

     More opinion on the size of FidoNet this week but differing views of
     where the 'bloat' is. I guess it depends on whose ox is gored. [grin]

     Below is the text of an exchange with a Z2 Sysop. I didn't have time
     to get his permission to post his side but his name is removed for the
     sake of discussion and only my quoted reply is included.

     i think understanding is important. we all need to understand what is
     going on here.

     good, because size is irrelevant unless FidoNews in archive gets too
     big to fit on a floppy.

     > Posting old (and almost uninteresting) Doc's (while not practicised)
     > is pure nonsense.

     practice makes perfect. the publishing is for historical and technical
     purpose. the FTSC has lain dormant for years. the folks who went to
     all the trouble of creating the various proposals and technical essays
     contained in the FTSC docs never got much of an audience. the
     publishing serves to illustrate where we came from and may stimulate
     some action on some of these plans. it also acquaints people with the
     underpinnings of the hobby many do not understand at any technical
     level.

     Echomail is not mandatory and not what FidoNet is or does. it's a nice
     add-on that is useful for specific topics but it is not universal nor
     available to everyone in toto. your reference to FIDOSOFT.xxx is a
     good example of a local phenomenon that nobody outside your area knows
     about. that's why FidoNews is an important conduit for such

     information.

     > I crashed this file month ago to Peter ... nothing happens.

     did you get any mail back from him? perhaps, he has incorporated some
     of the info into his listings or used it as a contact point for the
     authors involved? i cannot answer for Peter.

     he has taken on a monumental and thankless task in reorganizing and
     winnowing this list. the software list is VERY important to FidoNet.
     it is the ONLY centralized list of what is available for new Sysops
     [or current Sysops looking for a change]. it won't always be the size
     it is now. it is being actively maintained which means the dead wood
     will be removed eventually. this is going to take time, however, and
     FidoNews is not going to suffer for its size or content while that
     process continues. it is important information and the only way to get
     it to everyone [including the authors] at once is via FidoNews.

     the point is that FidoNews is the only place [other than the Nodelist]
     that is standard to all FidoNet Nodes. it is the appropriate place to
     recount FidoNet history and to disseminate material peculiar to
     FidoNet.

     i hope this helps our mutual understanding. [grin]

     thanks.

     We have another Guest Editorial in response to Clay's of 1406. Keep
     'em coming! I also see that Clay Tannacore HAS returned to the
     Nodelist as of .045 on Friday. That's the spirit!

                              GUEST EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     [This was slightly reformatted and edited for spelling and punctuation
      and clarification of which Net is being referred to only.] Ed.

     Hi Chris..

     I don't suppose this will be in the proper format for a submission,
     but I am ignorant of such things. Please do as you see fit. <grin>

     I'm responding to a few pieces in the latest issue of Fidonews -
     volume 6/97. Specifically, the article by Clay Tannacore about the
     direction of Fidonet.

     I found myself nodding my head in agreement with just about everything
     Clay says in his article. I particularly found agreement in his
     position #5, regarding the overuse of quoting in echomail. This has
     long been a thorn in my side in every echo I read, or have read and
     left. I have, on numerous occasions, taken it upon myself to attempt
     to educate writers in the proper methods of quoting in echomail. Among
     them, only quoting enough of the original message so others know your
     point of reference.  I've also campaigned against the geeks with the
     multi-line, Internet style, high ascii "sigs" people have become so
     fond of lately. As a SysOp myself, I'm aware of the costs involved in
     moving echomail. I take it personally when people abuse our largesse
     with this crap. Unfortunately, the response to most of my pleas has
     been to "mind your own business - you ain't the Moderator!" Now you
     would expect such from the elements who regard anonymous
     communications as there personal playground to practice "Beavis and
     Butt-Headisms", but when you get the same response from an echos
     Moderator - saying "Leave the Moderating to the Moderator" - it's a
     bit much. After all, had the Moderator been doing his job - such
     conduct would not have been tolerated. The attitude seems to be "Fido
     is dying, let them talk or they'll go to the Net." Well fine - let
     them go if that's what Fido has degenerated into  -I don't like paying
     the freight for it!

     Clay's point on the plethora of "Pay to Use" BBSes also struck a cord
     here. I've run a board since 1992 - as a hobby. Shareware BBS software
     (TriBBS 10/Pro, registered, thank you), bottomline all the way. I've
     never charged for access to my board. Yes - I do offer subscriptions
     for cash or donations of equipment in exchange for increased file
     limits.  Now, there are 2 schools of thought on Pay vs. Free boards.
     The first is that people seeing a board charges for access will assume
     it has to be pretty good or they wouldn't charge. Interesting! The
     second is that, as Clay points out - we do this as a hobby, and
     therefore shouldn't charge for access.  I tend to see points of
     agreement in each, since a few pay boards in my area are doing great,
     while free boards like mine are suffering. Doubly interesting since on
     "free previews" I've taken on these boards, neither the graphics work,
     features, games, nor filebase are as extensive or good as mine. But
     there ya go - different strokes.  Clay's proposition that pay boards
     are sometimes thinly disguised pirated software hangouts, i.e. "Elite"
     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 4                   17 Feb 1997


     boards, has an element of truth to it.  That is certainly the case in
     my areas anyway. I limit non-members on my board to specific but
     generous download levels. Members are allowed practically unrestricted
     downloads. That's it.  All callers have full access to the 15 CDROMs I
     carry, all message networks and echos, and all the games.  I do know
     of several boards running hacked software, with logon procedures like
     speakeasys of the 20's - complete with "joe sent me" doorways and
     phony menus. Pretty neat if you want to spend 3 hours online
     downloading a copy of Win95 at 14400. Not me, thanks.

     A final point is Clay's mention of the effects of the [Inter]Net on
     local "hobby" bulletin boards.  The [Inter]net has hurt me badly.
     Calls have dropped significantly over the last year, for a number of
     reasons. One of those is new computer owners/users don't need
     additional communications software and the accompanying knowledge to
     call the [Inter]Net - most PCs come with the software. They can
     connect to the [Inter]Net and play. To call a BBS they have to locate
     and install a comm program, find some local boards numbers, then plod
     through setting up to connect properly with ANSI, etc.  Not a lot of
     fun for todays crop of "point and click or forget it" PC users.  We
     should indeed stress the FREE nature of our boards, and the usefulness
     of Fidonet in messaging all over the world via a local call.  I've
     found myself making close friends I've yet to meet in countries the
     world over, as well as states of this great country I've never
     visited.  That means something, and should be made note of. There has
     to be a simpler method of interfacing local boards with beginners PCs.
     How that could be accomplished I have not a clue - the more technical
     aspects of these toys we play with escape me, and at this time of my
     life (age 50), there is no hope of my learning. That I will leave up
     to others more capable.

     Fido[Net] has some problems, to be sure. None of them are
     insurmountable, in my opinion. Surely the "in your face" mentality of
     certain recent critics does nothing to enhance its prospects. Fidonet
     after all is a mirror image of politics - many criticize, yet too few
     offer solutions. Not surprising since criticism is easy. Finding
     solutions takes work and some semblance of intelligence - both
     characteristics lacking in the harbingers of doom.

     Common Sense for Fidonews
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindnes@csl.co.uk

     Gary Gilmore was quite rash in a number of his comments a couple of
     weeks back... However a couple of valid comments can be made regarding
     Fidonews's size and content:

      o Internet distribution sites - A simple link to a web page that
     contains these address would suffice. It goes without saying that
     everyone that is interested in these sites would have internet access,
     and hence be able to access such a page.

      o Zone, Region, Net Homepages - As above, a reference to a web page
     would do.

      o Jokes & ASCII 'pics' - Not the thing we should *promote* for
     Fidonews inclusion. It's the type of thing anyone with an email
     address gets bombarded with daily from friends and in the humour
     echoes (PUNCH et al).  So before you think about submitting these
     jokes and pictures consider that you've got - it's more than likely
     everyone else has too!

      o Software listing - Monthly rather than weekly would be a better
     frequency, and lets get rid of the old software section - a pile of
     meaning less names and version numbers is of no use to anyone!

      o PGP key - A pointless peace of INet poseur?

     Lets cut down on all the static information...

     And now onto the positive aspects... The posting of FTSC documents is
     a great idea (i waiting to see how the RTF FSC is handled thou ;) and
     Chris has done a great job in reviving Fidonews after Tees's death
     grip.

     FTSC - Dead and Buried?
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindness@csl.co.uk

     Last year i submitted 3 FTS update proposals to the FTSC Chair Dave
     Nugent. 5 months later, no reply.

     Speaks volumes really... I wonder how many people remember the words
     of Dave when he took over the position, pot calling the ke... I

     really must dig them up and post them!

     We need a solution, The 'new' FTSC-something leaded by R1EC seems
     too elitist (All this FTSC_PUBLIC echo bollox, get into NET_DEV
     where the developers are!)

     A point to ponder...

             sets the value of current attribute to 3, ^V^L, ^V^M and ^V^A
             to an explicit value.  In addition, ^V^B turns blink on.

                                 Extending AVT/0

     It has become clear some of the Avatar commands originally reserved
     for AVT/1 would be very useful in AVT/0. I was hesitant to add them
     for one simple reason: Any addition on level 0 will break all existing
     Avatar emulating software.

     However, at present there are only three programs I know of that have
     implemented Avatar emulation: My own TinyTerm, Joaquim Homrighausen's
     FrontDoor and Jason Galanter's Jterm.

     Both Joaquim and Jason have assured me they would put the new commands
     in their programs, thus nothing will be broken. With that assurance in
     mind, I feel confident no chaos will result from adding these new
     commands.

                           Detailed Description

     Insert mode: Insert mode controls the way characters are printed on
     the screen. Insert mode is always assumed OFF unless explicitly
     set ON by the ^V^I command after which it stays on until another
     AVT/0 command except for ^Y or ^V^Y is encountered. Then it reverses
     back to off.

             Whenever insert mode is OFF, characters are printed on the
     screen like this:

             1. Print character at current cursor position using current
                attribute, overwriting whatever was previously displayed at
                current cursor position;

             2. Move cursor to next position, usually one character to the
                right.  At end of the line, move the cursor to next line
                (possibly scrolling the display or current window if in
                AVT/1).

             Whenever insert mode is ON, characters are printed on the
             screen as follows:

             1. Starting at current cursor position and going all the way
                to the second last character on current line, scroll the
                text one character to the right;
     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 10                  17 Feb 1997


             2. Discard the character previously at the end of the line, do
                NOT move it at the beginning of the next line;

             3. Print character at current cursor position using current
                attribute;

             4. Move cursor to next position, precisely as in par. 2 of
                insert mode off.

     If ^Y or ^V^Y are encountered, the string of characters they compress
     is first expanded, then treated as an ordinary stream of characters
     printed according to the above rules.

     Any other AVT/0 command turns insert mode back off. Please note that
     in either case the cursor is moved to its next position in an
     identical manner.  The mere fact the cursor is moved to next line, or
     even scrolls the screen a line up, does NOT turn insert mode off. Only
     an AVT/0 except as mentioned above can change insert mode on or off.

     If control characters are a part of the text stream, they are
     interpreted indentically in insert mode on and off as follows:

             Carriage return  -  move cursor at the beginning of the same
                                 line;

             Line feed        -  move cursor one line down (scroll screen
                                 or window [in AVT/1] if necessary), do not
                                 change cursor column;

             Back space       -  move cursor one position to the left. Do
                                 NOT overwrite the character at that
                                 position.  Do nothing if already at the
                                 leftmost position;

             Tab              -  move cursor to next tab position without
                                 overwriting anything. Tab positions are
                                 multiples of 8. Do nothing if already at
                                 the rightmost position.

     A space is treated as a character, not as a control character.

     Scrolling an area (^V^J and ^V^K): The area defined by its upper,
             left, lower and right coordinates is scrolled up <^V^J) or
             down (^V^K) by <numlines> lines filling the gap with blank
             spaces using current attribute. If the value of <numlines> is
             zero or exceeds the actual number of lines within the scrolled
             area, the area is filled with blanks using current attribute.

             These two commands do NOT change the position of the cursor,
             nor do they define the scrolled area as the default window.

             The coordinates are relative to the upper left corner of the
             screen (or current window in AVT/1). The coordinates of upper
             left corner are 1,1. If a coordinate contains 0, it is to be
             changed to 1.

     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 11                  17 Feb 1997


     Initializing an area (^V^M): This command contains several steps:

             1. Set current attribute to <attr>;

             2. Starting at current cursor position (inclusively), ending
                at current cursor position plus number of <lines> and
                <columns>, print <char> at all position inside the defined
                area. Do not move the cursor. If the number of columns or
                lines exceeds whatever is available to the right and below
                current cursor position, truncate the dimensions to fit
                within the limits of the screen (or current window in
                AVT/1).

     Clearing an area (^V^L): This is a shortcut version of the ^V^M
     command.
             The character to be used to initialize the area of the screen
             is assumed to be a blank space. In other words, it sets
             current attribute and clears an area of the screen starting at
             current cursor position (which remains unchanged).

     Please note that the usual 7-bit restriction applies to ^V^L  That
     means that the attribute byte should be anded with 7f hex before
     applying.  If blinking is desired, ^V^B should be used next.

     On the other hand, requiring to ignore the high bit in ^V^M would make
     it impossible to fill the area of the screen with a blinking pattern
     (something I have seen used very creatively by Chris Gaal of PittNet).
     Therefore, if bit 7 of attr is set in ^V^M, current attribute is set
     to <attr> AND 7f hex and blink is turned on before filling the area
     with a character.

     Deleting a character (^V^N): Starting at the column one character to
             the right of current cursor position all the way to end of the
             line, scroll the text one character position to the left. This
             effectively deletes the character at current cursor position.
             Print a blank space using current attribute at the rightmost
             end of the line to fill the gap. Do not change current cursor
             position. If the cursor is at the end of the line, simply
             overwrite the last character with a blank space using current
             attribute.

     Repeat pattern: This is an extension of the ^Y command which allows a
            group of characters to form a repetititious pattern. <numchars>
            determines the number of characters in the pattern, <count> the
            number of times the pattern is to be printed out.  The pattern
            may contain AVT/0 codes.

     For example, <^V><^Y><#3>ABC<#4> expands to "ABCABCABCABC".

                             Scrolling Philosophy

     An important philosophical question has not been answered yet: When
     scrolling the contents of an area (in the scrolling commands ^V^J and
     ^V^J, in insert mode ON and in deleting characters ^V^N) should only
     the text be scrolled and the attribute of the scrolled areas remain
     where they are or should the attributes move as well.
     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 12                  17 Feb 1997


     A case can be made for either approach. Obviously, the gaps created by
     scrolling are filled with current attribute, therefore, it seems more
     logical to scroll the attributes along with the text (else there would
     be no need to fill the gaps). Thus we follow a consistent principle of
     video attributes belonging to a character (be it a blank, a digit, or
     a true character), not to a location. Whenever a character is scrolled
     to a different location, it takes its attribute along.

                        A Domain Proposal For Fidonet(r)

                                   jim nutt
                               1:114/30@fidonet

          Information:

              This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet
              community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
              improvements.  Distribution of this document is
              unlimited.

     A. Rationale

     A recent proliferation of alternative networks based on Fidonet
     technology has brought to light the difficulty of maintaining a fully
     coupled addressing method for Fidonet.  Additionally, Fidonet has
     joined the Internet,  revealing a need for a transparent scheme for
     addressing messages across the networks.  It is therefore proposed
     that a system be established whereby geographical or political sub
     units of the network can be broken off into an independent network
     called a "domain".  These networks will be fully independent, even to
     the point of having duplicate net/node numbers or using a different
     addressing scheme altogether.  This will allow continued growth of
     Fidonet without necessitating that the nodelist grow to an
     unmanageable size (if it isn't already there).  Among the advantages
     of this type of system are reduced nodelist overhead, easier inter-
     network communication and greater autonomy of alternative networks.
     This document will only cover the definition  of the necessary
     addressing extensions to support domain based addressing.  It will not
     attempt to define standards for gating mail and conferences between
     domains.

     B. Description

     It is proposed that domain addressing be implemented in a fashion
     similar to the current ZONE extended addressing method.  Domain names
     will be case insensitive.  The domain extended addressing line will be
     comprised of a leading SOH (^A, 0x01) followed by the keyword
     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 13                  17 Feb 1997


     "DOMAIN", the destination domain of the message and then the full
     address (zone:net/node.point) of the destination node in that domain,
     followed by the source domain of the message and the full address of
     the originating node.  The line will be terminated by a <CR> (0x0d)
     and an optional linefeed (0x0a), fields within the line will be
     separated by one or more spaces or tabs. i.e.

          ^ADOMAIN  dstdmn daddress srcdmn saddress

     Where "dstdmn" is the name of the destination domain and "daddress" is
     the address of the destination system in a format appropriate to the
     destination domain.  "srcdmn" and "saddress" are similar, except that
     they express the origination address of the message in a format
     appropriate to the originating domain.  This allows a seamless gateway
     to the Internet and other large system networks.  The destination
     address in the FTS-001 message header should be that of a gateway to
     the destination domain.

     C. Summary

     Domains are independent networks that are fully decoupled from the
     Fidonet nodelist.  Message traffic is passed back and forth between
     domains via domain gateways that can understand the DOMAIN extended
     addressing line and act accordingly upon the message.  The advantages
     include reduced nodelist size and easier communication with other
     networks.

       Introduction
       ------------
       This document serves two major purposes.  The first is an attempt to
       define and document the Type-2 packet which is widely in use in
       FidoNet today.  Although FTS-0001 defines the structure of a Type-2
       packet, the natural evolution of our network, mostly with regards to
     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 14                  17 Feb 1997


       addressing methodology, has made it necessary to utilize hitherto
       unused portions of the header to insert Zone and Point information.
       Also, it has become apparent that some of the existing fields are
       not large enough to accomplish their original tasks.

       The second is to propose a simple mechanism to allow FidoNet to
       begin to utilize advanced mail packing techniques.  It is quite
       apparent that while Type-2 has served us faithfully for some time
       now, the evolution of our network in terms of technical and physical
       complexity has caused us to consider more efficient and functional
       ways to pack mail.

       It should be made clear that with the exception of the Capability
       Word, Capability Word Validation Copy, ProductCode(hi), and
       Revision(minor), which are proposed extensions to the Type-2 packet
       header, this FSC is an attempt to correctly document existing
       practices with regards to the insertion of zone and point info by at
       least three mail processors in use today.

       The Type-2 Header (Where's the Zone?)
       -------------------------------------
       Although FTS-0001 has recently been updated to reflect the use of
       some of the areas in the packed message header for zone data, at
       least two other methods for inserting the zone information have been
       adopted, making it necessary to provide support for both formats in
       all of the zone aware mail processors.  The end result is more code,
       and redundant information in the packet header.

       This has presented a problem in logistics, as it is difficult to
       consider the project of updating mail processors using one type to
       use the other.  As sufficient indentification is provided, in the
       form of the product code, to determine the expected location of the
       zone information, and because code already exists in most of the
       mail processors to overcome this, this proposal does not attempt to
       suggest that one method be used over the other, rather the intent is
       to attempt to document the extensions in use, and the products
       involved.

       See the accompanying chart and cross-reference.

       The Product Code
       ----------------
       Based upon the current rate of requests for product codes from the
       FTSC, it is probable that the Product Code byte will not be large
       enough to accomodate all of the codes required.  While it is not
       reasonable to expect that all Type-2 processors will eventually
       check the hi-order byte proposed here, it is likely that 'current'
       mail processors will.  This can be nothing but benefical, as it will
       force users to upgrade their mail processors to a product which will
       as a minimum, support Type-2 with Zone and Point extensions, and
       quite possibly, processors that will utilize more advanced mail
       packing techniques, making Type-2 extinct once and for all.

       The Capability Word  (How do we GET there from here?)
       -----------------------------------------------------
       Everybody would like to see more efficient and functional ways to
     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 15                  17 Feb 1997


       pack and exchange mail.  Several Type-3 message bundle proposals
       exist, but none really address a problem which must be solved first.
       The problem is that since FidoNet is a hobbyist network, no demands
       can be placed on any one sysop to upgrade or change their bundling
       software.  Because of this, it is necessary to consider strategies
       which allow for the existence of Type-2 bundlers in the network
       topology.

       Considerable advantages can be realized, however, between systems
       that consent to use advanced bundling techniques.  One way to do
       this is to simply send netmail to all of your connecting systems,
       saying "Hey, I've got a Type-3 bundler now, how about you?"  This
       could become quite tiresome, and does not represent much of an
       improvement on the current situation.

       What would be desirable is a network that would 'upgrade itself'.
       Given a situation where mail processors of various capabilities will
       exist in a network topology, the goal is to provide a mechanism
       whereby two links can determine and utilize the most efficient
       bundling method to use, in a manner transparent to the sysop.

       For instance, let's say that the FTSC releases the Type-7 All New
       Singing and Dancing bundle format.  Well, your current version of
       SlingToss can only support Types 2, 3, and 5.  One of your downlinks
       gets a new version of MailMangle which can support Types 2, 3, 4,
       and 7.  Well, it is quite obvious that since you and he are
       exchanging 4 megs of mail each night, and it's an overseas call,
       that it would be in your interest to obtain a new version of
       SlingToss which can support Type 7.

       Note that this is *optional*.  Because both processors can support
       Type-3, they will continue to exchange Type-3 mail quite happily,
       even though MailMangle is happily advertising the availability of
       Type-7.  Even your downlinks which are still using stone-age Type-2
       processors will be fine, as SlingToss will always export Type-2
       bundles when no higher capability can be determined.

       So, after dashing off the check to the author, your new version of
       SlingToss comes in the mail!  You rush over to your system, and
       install it.  The next time SlingToss exports mail to the MailMangle
       system, it says "Hey!  I can now support Type 2, 3, 5, and 7!  So,
       whattya got?" This is no skin off MailMangle's nose, he's had Type-7
       for quite a while, and he begins to export Type-7 bundles to
       SlingToss.  "It's about time.", he says.

       Now, this scenario is made possible by implementing a 'Capability
       Word' in the present and future packet headers.  The Capability
       Update mechanism depends on several assumptions:

       1)   Any Advanced Capability Bundler *MUST* be capable of receiving
          and faithfully processing Type-2 bundles.  Hopefully, the inbound
          packets will be in the new format proposed by this document, but
          then again, this is not an exact science.  What this means is
          that it is likely that some packets may arrive with the
          Capability Word (CW) set to 0.  In this case, Type-2 is assumed,
          assuring compatibility.  The only caveat is that it is
     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 16                  17 Feb 1997


          conceivable that some obscure mail processor uses the location
          proposed for the CW for other arcane purposes.  This | can
          detected through the CWValidation Copy, which is byte-swapped and
          | compared with the CW at that time.  If a mismatch is found, a
          CW of | type 0 is assumed, and a Type-2 bundling method is used.

       2) An Advanced Capability Bundler, hereafter referred to as a Type-N
          Bundler, must have a method to store and maintain the node-by-
          node capability information.  This can be done many ways, and in
          fact several processors already have begun to maintain node
          information outside of that found in AREAS.BBS, mostly to
          implement pre-arranged alternate compression methods.  In a text
          configuration file, you might see the following:

          ;       Address      Comp    Send  LastCW ; Comments
          Node    1:260/340    ZIP     Auto  7      ; Auto detect & upgrade
          Node    1:135/20     LZH     3     2,3,7  ; Always send Type-3
          Node    1:           ARC     2     0      ; Stone-Age processor
          Node    1:135/4      ---     Auto  7      ; Sent me netmail
          Node    1:           ---     0     0      ; Don't send CW

          In this example, the fields are:

          Address - downlink address.  Note that this is not necessarily
                    relative to echomail, only, it is possible to append
                    information to the node database as netmail packets are
                    receieved from different addresses.

          Comp    - desired mail compression method.

          Send    - Auto - automatically determined maximum common packing
                           method to use.  Automatically update to LastCW
                           when packing.

          LastCW  - Last CW received from remote system.


       3) A Type-N Bundle will always advertise it's capabilities in the CW
          regardless of the type being sent.  As shown in the above
          example, it allows Type-N processors to automatically track the
          capability of your system.  Again, in cases where a stone-age
          processor is being used, this field will be ignored, and in the
          unusual event that it is not ignored, and is somehow harmful to
          the far system, the Type-N processor can be configured to send a
          CW of 0.

       The format of the Capability Word is designed to support up to 15
       future bundle types, and is bit-mapped to facilitate the easy
       determination of the maximum common level supported between two
       nodes:

                      msb           Capability Word               lsb

                       +--- Indicates UseNet RFC-822 capability

                       ** - a mismatch in the CWValidation Copy also
                            produces a CW=0.

       In this example, the Type-N bundler would first compare the remote
       CW | and the byte-swapped remote CWValidation Copy, and check for a
       mismatch.  Prior to the compare, the MSB of the CW's are masked, as
       this bit is reserved to indicate whether the mail processor is
       capable of also accepting UseNet RFC-822 bundles.  Following the MSB
       mask, and bit comparison, if they do not match, a remote CW of 0 is
       assumed.  If they match, the Type-N processor would AND the local
       and remote CW words, obtaining a CW expressing the Types which are
       in common to both systems.  The most significant Type will be used,
       by default, but note that this assumes that new bundling Types will
       be increasingly more efficient or in some way more beneficial.

       Because this may not always be the case, there should be a method
       provided, as illustrated above, to override the automatic upgrade
       should this become the case.

       The MSB of the CW is used to indicate whether the mail processor can
       accept UseNet RFC-822 bundles or not.  It is a separate indicator,
       and not intended to be used as a part of the above comparison,
       however can be used to also advertise RFC-822 capability to other
       systems.  Since RFC-822 is 'set in stone', there is no need to
       assign more than one capability bit.

       It might seem somewhat limiting to only consider the possibility of
       15 different future bundling methods, but it is my opinion that the
       careful use of a 'Sub-Type' byte in the packet header can allow for
       the variations on a single theme, and that proposals for new formats
       should be evaluated by the FTSC to determine whether sufficient
       benefit can be realized in the implementation of the given format,
       prior to assigning a new type code.

       Mailers
       -------
       It is quite clear to me that should this concept take hold, that the
       logical place to store node capability data is in the local nodelist
       database, or an index-associated data file.  As above, it is
       necessary to generate Type-2 packets for whatever purpose, unless it
       is known by prior association, that the far mailer can accept other
       types of packets.  It is also quite reasonable to assume that a
       nodelist flag could be assigned to advertise the CW for a given
       node, which the native mailer nodelist compiler could then
       immediately determine the preferred bundling method for any given
       node in FidoNet.

       Another possibility would be to pass a capability advertisement in
       the extensible portion of a handshake protocol, which may or may not
     FIDONEWS 14-07               Page 18                  17 Feb 1997


       already exist in FidoNet.

       The approach suggested previously in this document suggests the use
       of a text configuration file, but it is quite obvious that many
       benefits can be realized through the use of the nodelist, including
       the use of additional flags to indicate the preferred compression
       method, etc.

       Summary
       -------
       This document has been created in an attempt to define a method to
       allow the future expansion and enhancement of FidoNet technology
       mail processors and mailers, and in a way that is the least
       disruptive to existing mail operations.  The intent is to provide
       for an environment that is as open, and extensible as possible.

       The mechanism described should allow many different types of
       processors (FTSC-registered) to exist in the network at once, and to
       provide an environment which is designed to operate at it's maximum
       efficiency wherever possible or practical.

       Revision 2 of this document was produced to implement suggestions
       made primarily by Jan Vroonhof, who suggested the use of the CW
       Validation Copy.  Jan presented this idea in his FSC-0048, along
       with other concepts relating to the correct indentification and
       handling of zone and point addressing.   This document sanctions the
       improvements to the CW as recommended, but does not address or
       support the other extensions recommended in FSC-0048.

     10> "The woman predicted Kennedy's assassination, for cryin' out
          loud -- you'd think she'd have known how hideous she'd look
          in that dress."

                        Ruminations & Ponderances

          One night I walked into the kitchen and found Grandma
           getting ready to cut up Anna Chin-Williams' family.
              "GRANDMA!" I cried, "You said we were having
               *Paul Paternoster* tonight!!"  She replied,
                "No, the dog is having Paul Paternoster!"
                  Boy, did we ever laugh about that one.
                          (Thanks to Bill Muse)

         One night while I was enjoying Grandma's dog a l*orange,
     I mentioned that Paul Paternoster's family actually ate CHICKEN!
      Grandma replied,  "I guess for some people, nothing's sacred."
               There wasn't much to laugh about that night.
                      (Thanks to Anna Chin-Williams)

                                THE END

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     I'm going out on a limb here, but I'm -fairly- sure that all of the
     utilities listed in the old format for OS/2 aren't used any more. I
     could easily be wrong, though. If I am, all you have to do to keep
     a specific utility in the list is send me netmail by the 28th.

     Fair warning: Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari sections are close behind.

     Currently the old format takes up 45% of the list. I expect that to
     drop to well under 40% by the 3 Mar 97 issue and to under 25% by 7
     Apr 97.

     Phased out this week: "Xenix/Unix 386 -- Other Utilities" Section

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: "OS/2 Systems" Section
             Deadline for info: 28 Feb 1997.
       Last week: "Tandy Color Computer 3 (OS-9 Level II)" Section
             Deadline for info: 21 Feb 1997.
