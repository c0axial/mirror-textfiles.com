Editorial from afar (temporally)
by Tom Jennings

This is a canned editorial that will repeat every week like a bad cold
unless Tim Pozar stops it. (Written 19 June 91)
[Hmmm... Should I?  -Tim]

I will be out of town until 1 Aug 1991. Tim Pozar is acting as editor
(he's on the masthead, in case you didn't notice). He can be reached
at 1:125/555. Articles etc still go to 1:1/1. Probably most of the
projects I initiated are on hold until I return. 'Salright, we lasted
this long without them.

Hey! Bye! Have a nice trip! (Wait... that's your line!)

                        GRANDPARENTS Echo

        GPARENTS was formed to discuss the entire realm of
grandparenting; from being a grandparent, becoming a grandparent,
wishing you were a grandparent and includes 'Honarary'
grandparents as well as everyone who ever had a grandparent. Its
main goal is to present a forum to brag and/or commiserate about
grandchildren, to devise methods for spoiling grandchildren, and
plan for the care and feeding of the future's grandchildren. It
is a place to share the grandparenting experience.

        GPARENTS can be a good companion echo for the PARENTS,
DADS, and MEMORIES echos.  It will offer the parent ideas on how
to cooperate with a bragging grandparent and it can be an
effective source of ideas for grandparenting with your own
grandchildren or other people's grandchildren.

        We would like to have you and your users join us in
becoming more informed about a national pastime.  In the past
month we have extended congratulations to grandparents on new
arrivals, exchanged ideas on activities for grandchildren, and
discussed the difficulties of long-distance grandparenting.
We hope we can offer an important echo to the BBS community.

        If you would like to participate in the echo please

                A New Echomail Hub System - A Proposal

        I was looking at my ^aPATH: lines today and I sadi to myself, THIS
IS CRAZY!  Net 261 is Baltimore, and we are net 109, Washington, DC, which
is the closest major city.  Anyway I had a message in RA_SUPPORT that had
a path like this: 261/1024 13/13 396/1 12/12 13/13 396/1 109/25 40

FidoNews 8-26                  Page 4                       1 Jul 1991


That is wierd.  Now this is going to be a short and sweet one, so here we
go.

We have Zones, then we have regions, then nets then hubs then leafs.  Why
not let every region have a central echomail hub?

Region,13
Hub,13,ProtoStar_Hub
Region,14,
Hub,14,Canada_Hub

Also, every net could have a central echomail "hub".  So my path would
look something like this:

Message from SoandSo in region 18 at 135/4003.  this is how it would go:

135/4003 to his hub.  The from his hub to the net 135 hub (like 135/6000,
or something..)  then from him goes to the regional hub, so:

PATH: 135/4003 400 6000 18/18 13/13 109/25 109/40

So as not to be convoluted like first it goes to the DFF Dutch Mailer in
Holland first.

Here is what would happen for the routing technique:

RA_SUPPORT routed (example only).

135/node1 135/node2 135/node3 135/node4
    |         |         |         |
     - 1000 --           -- 4000 -  (HUBS)
         |                   |
          ------- 6000 ------ (CENTRAL HUB)
                   ||
(REGIONAL) 18/18 --  -- Other HUBS in the net
             |
             1/2(3/4/5/6) - Int'l OGATE
            11/11
            12/12
            13/13 -- Net 109 HUB (109/25) --- Other HUBS --- Leafs
            14/14
            15/15 Etc.


the same thing could be implemented on a zone bases as well.  Send
comments to Nathan Moschkin at 1:109/427.0@fidonet.org (Echolist
Coordinator, Net 109)

20:491/110.0 MailNet

                  A Fort Worth Nodelist Update

Since the publication of the preliminary specs for the Fort Worth
Nodelist format in FidoNews 820 the response has been
overwhelming.  I've gotten mail from every zone at least once,
and usually a ton.  I've tried to reply to each person who sent
mail, but some problems with outbound netmail on my system have
prevented some replies from getting out.  But never fear, it'll
come.

There were a number of problems with the article that I became
aware of only after its publication.  Many people pointed them
out, so I'm more than acutely aware of them.  :-)

First, there is the matter of the PHONE and FPHONE fields, and
how it is not feasable to strip parts off the nodelist.  So, a
fix is in the works.  Several possibilities are being considered,
but I think the best one is this:

   Instead of listing the entire number, or instead of stripping
   parts of the number in the manner suggested in the previous
   article, keep the FPHONE field and allow a full phone override
   for the regular PHONE field, like this:

   Host,...,FPHONE,...
   num,...,-PHONE,...

   This means that you could put a dash in front of the full
   phone number, indicating that it is the full phone number,
   instructing the compiler not to add the DIAL_TRANS field.
   This allows non-geographic or inter-area code nets, such as in
   parts of the United States and Canada (the Washington, D.C.
   area comes to mind), as well as in many other parts of the
   world.

This approach would also allow area codes in true geographic
nets, while allowing the removal of redundant information.

A great number of people commented on the dropping of the X?
mailer capability flag, since some mailer seems to use this.  My
arbitrary removal of this flag seems to have been hasty, so it
may return in the form of a one byte flag.

Comments were made on the lack of a NUM field in the PVT and HUB
fileds.  This was simply oversight and lack of proofreading on my
part.  They go right after the Pvt and Hub flags, of course.

FidoNews 8-26                  Page 6                       1 Jul 1991


Several people suggested changing the entire thing to a
binary-encoded file.  I am against this change because it would
not only require the writing of a program to create the nodelist
for each platform (something that I am not going to do), but it
could interfere with some computers' method of saving files.  I
will not take the file formats of each and every computer on the
market and/or still in use into consideration when designing a
binary-format file.  Every platform has a text editor that can
save a pure ASCII file.  This part seems to work, so I see no
need to change it.

People have also noted that a conversion program will be required
to convert the Fort Worth format nodelist to the St. Louis format
for those mailers that either haven't been updated or aren't
supported any more.  This is a good idea.  Any volonteers?

Some suggested the dropping of Pvt nodes as a whole.  I believe
that, since the current nodelist format supports the use of Pvt
nodes, I should, too.  The dropping of Pvt nodes is a matter that
should be left to policy.

Some suggested ordering nodes in the nodelist by phone number.
Also, ideas for hex-encoding of flag fields at the end of a
listing is in order.  Neither of these options is a good idea, in
my opinion, because of the time involved in conversion.  Changing
to a new nodelist format will be bad enough - I don't propose to
turn the world upside down twice.  Also, many NCs are not
programmers, have no background in hex, and, while hex isn't that
hard to pick up, the number of combinations available for any
given mailer capability flag/modem type/speed/whatever makes it
very hard to define a system that will account for each variation
in equipment, and that NCs will want to implement.

And there was even discussion about dropping the CM flag.  I
believe that this is a bad move - the nodelist is a
representation of nodes that meet the minimum requirements for
being a member of FidoNet.  According to FTS-0001 this is
compliance with ZMH only - not being CM, not supporting FREQs.
Just accepting mail during ZMH.  Therefore, any capabilities that
are extra, such as supporting 24-hour mail, should be listed with
extra flags.  If a capability is required of all nodes in
FTS-0001 it should not be listed in the nodelist because all
nodes are understood to support it, but additional capabilities
should be listed because there are some that do not.  It should
not be the other way around.

That confusing enough for you?

In closing, I told some of you that a revision would hit the News
by July 1, 1991.  This is that revision.  I will release the next
version, a full FSC-formatted document, for publication in
FidoNews sometime in September or October.  I'm going out of town
on July 3 and will not return until the middle of August.  I'm
not even going to take a computer with me!  If you're going to
the GenCon Game Fair in Milwalkee, well, maybe I'll see you
there.  Until next time, WOOF!

Yet Another Vote Proposal


I've read with great interest the discussions going on about how
Fidonet elections are held. On the one hand, we have those that say
that the current method, which involves the *C to collect votes from
those under him and submit one vote, is the only practical method.
The proponents of this method say that it would not be practical to
count the votes.

On the other hand, there are others who say that if computers can do
nothing else they can COUNT. Why not have them do all the work? I
don't think it's a technical reason. I realize that there are many
different types of platforms running Fidonet systems, but a counting
program should not be diffucult to implement, especially if it looked
for a message addressed to it, dealt with it, and sent a reply to the
sender saying how is was recorded.

But I think there is another motive here. The current system is much
like the electoral college of the United States, where each state has
a set number of electors (the total number of representatives in
Congress), and (generally) all of the votes for that state go with
whom the state chose as their favorite.

Both systems favor smaller units, whether they be states or nets. But
it's a bit more pronounced in Fidonet, because a net with four nodes
has an equal voice as a net of 100 nodes. The result of this is the
node in the small net has a vote about 25 times more powerful than one
in the large net.

However, a system that counts a vote from each and every node, while
being equal to each node, is NOT equitable to each net. Result: from
the one net, one vote system comes a vote that favors the wishes of
small nets; from the one node, one vote method comes a vote that
favors the large nets.

The answer? Many nations today have a bicameral legislative system -
such as the House of Representatives and the Senate in the United
States. Fidonet needs to have one too. The method is this:

Nodes send their votes to their NC (or RC for independents). The *C
uses software that tallies the votes, puts them in a single file, and,
at the proper time, netmails the file to the *C at the level above.
The process repeats itself until it gets to the top of the tree (the
IC). The IC then counts the votes in two ways: first, by a
node-by-node basis; secondly, by a net-by-net basis. The measure would
have to pass BOTH ways for a measure to pass. Therefore, if a measure
is popular with about 25% of the nodes as a whole, but is extremely
popular with small nets, the measure would not pass. By the same
FidoNews 8-26                  Page 8                       1 Jul 1991


token, a measure that passed by about 60% of the nodes, but is
unpopular among small nets, the measure may not pass. It would have to
be beneficial to large AND small nets -- and, most importantly,
individual nodes -- to be passed.

Of course, this requires a policy change. One is probably due, as
current versions of policy are usually about the same as current
versions of MS-DOS. ;-)

Preface:  The purpose of my writings here is not to necessarily
"convert" or hassle anyone who is content in their current lifestyle
or religion;  but rather, to show what the real Biblical criteria
for Christianity is, and thereby expose those who are conning others.
Whether they are conning people financially, socially, or on the
FidoNet echos that allow religious discussion; false preachers and
false Christians are doing great harm to their fellow man.
Just a basic elementary Bible knowledge could keep current and
future "Jim & Tammy", "Jimmy S.", or "Billy G." types from conning
anyone on or off of FidoNet or other Network.
(J & T, J.S, and Billy G. never have taught the real Bible message).

                    Peter's Conversion

Mark 4:12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing
they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be
converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them.

We have many people today claiming to be converted or "saved". Yet,
none of them spent time with Jesus.  Peter spent quite a bit of time
with the Lord, yet, we see that Peter was not yet "converted" or
"born again".  Even though he obviously "believed". We see that Jesus
told Peter that WHEN he was converted (future tense). In fact we
notice that Peter even denied the Lord after this conversation:

Luke 22:31  And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath
desired [to have] you, that he may sift [you] as wheat:
Luke 22:32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:
and WHEN thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
Luke 22:33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with
thee, both into prison, and to death.
Luke 22:34 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow
this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.

FidoNews 8-26                  Page 9                       1 Jul 1991


The only major "conversion" event that LATER happened to Peter was
when he was filled with the Holy Ghost (speaking in tongues) in the
Upper Room. (see Acts 2:4)

He never denied the Lord after that. The Holy Ghost (with speaking
in tongues) is the "birth of the Spirit" that Jesus mentioned
in John 3:5.  It was in the Upper Room that Peter was "CONVERTED"
or "born again of the Spirit."

Many today make great swelling claims of Christianity, and claim
to be Christian even though they don't even believe in "tongues";
their pride will prevent them from considering that they might have
been deceived.

But, just as Peter was wrong when he said that he would never deny
the Lord; are also these others wrong, when they claim to be
"Christian" without meeting the Biblical criteria, which includes
the baptism of the Holy Ghost (with speaking in tongues).
see Acts 2:38.

A_theism means free of religion in the way a_political means
free of politics or a_sexual means free of sex

                     The English Professor Echo

The English Professor echo is for anyone who wants to learn, practice,
or just brush up on there English skills. Here is a brief idea of
what this echo will provide: It will correct your grammar mistakes so
you do not keep repeating the same ones over and over again. If you
have a report due for school and need help developing it. If you need
help with developing a presentation or you just want to converse about
FidoNews 8-26                  Page 14                      1 Jul 1991


the English language, than this echo is for you!

For those of you who are interested in American Economics this echo is
also for you!

This echo has NO RULES or SET TOPICS unlike other echos. This echo is
like a class room where you will constantly learn new things. All
types of people are welcomed here, including teachers and parents!
However this echo is not just for the student. It is also for others
to learn a great deal more about the English language you use every
day. You can talk to others around the world about other langauge
problems.

Do you have problems with verbs, nouns or adjectives? Do you get bad
marks on your English papers? Would you like to write better? Would
you like to speak clearly in a presentation? Do you get nervous when
talking to others in English? Do you have problems when you try to
translate your native language to English?
If you can answer yes to any of the above, than the ENGLISH_PROFESSOR
Echo is for you!

The English Professor echo is currently not on the backbone. If enough
systems link up, we will do out best to put it on the BBR. The echo
is hosted by Howard Sucher (2:247/83).

The following is a list of systems that are capable of supporting links:
This list is as of June 26, 1991.
You may request to link up to it via the following systems:
2:247/1, 2:249/2, 2:359/1 and more to come.

I hope you will join us today or ask your sysop to link in via the above
systems. If you have any questions netmail me at 2:247/83.

    "God abhors a naked singularity
        so he censors it with an event horizon." -- Stephen Hawking

Legion SysOps have groveled for me to write an unambiguous censoring
utility and have been surprised to learn that what they've been
looking for already exists. (I have a well-deserved reputation for
software that censors or otherwise sterilizes, it seems, and it has
been mentioned that I have a generally technocratic predilection
towards throwing software at any social enigma that might offend a
critical thought processes.)

It's released with the understanding that the software gets 'floppied'
or destroyed after this particular social problem goes away.

Educate.LZH actually moves repellent articles out of FidoNews and puts
them into a holding file without operator intervention. A backup of
the original issue is offered so that if you supply FidoNews to other
sites, they can get the uncensored issue.

Let's site academician elitism and intolerance for this one.

Fredric.
