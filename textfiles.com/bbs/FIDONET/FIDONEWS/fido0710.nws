                       Commercial Advertisement Echo
                       -----------------------------

     For  months  now I have deliberated about doing this and  know  I
     will  probably  get all kinds of stones thrown at me but  I  have
     just about had it with:  We do not allow commercial advertisement
     in this echo, or we do not want anyone to make a profit from this
     echo.   It  is not that I do not disagree with all of that it  is
     just  that  I am sick and tired of all the whinney babies an  how
     much  it cost to send messages around the world.   Well guys  and
     gals who do you all think you are kidding.

     When  we (those of us who really do this for FUN) want  something
     the  cost is not the Object.   Nor is it the hold back.   Well  I
     think it is about time an echo where commercial advertisement can
     take   place.    A  place  where  sysops  can  post   their   BBS
     advertisement's,   or  if they have something for sale that  does
     not  belong in For-Sale,  or Modem or Hd or what ever.   A  place
     where  If  I  want  to advertise my wares or my  programs  or  my
     services I can do so.

     So  here is what I have done.   I have established an  echo  area
     called ADVERT.   There is one catch,  this echo is not FREE.   It
     will  never  be placed on a backbone,  nor will it ever  be  made
     available  for  free distribution.   There will be one  point  of
     distribution,  and  one point for delivery.   Connection to  this
     echo   will  cost  $1.00  per  month.    Payable  in  advance  of
     connection,  and  connection  will only be made upon  receipt  of
     payment and validation of correct node number.   I will also  not
     make  any out going distribution calls,  all calls must  orginate
     from  the receiving node.   The echo areas may be set up as  READ
     ONLY  or  Sysops May allow Users to Enter Messages.   Sysops  may
     establish their own fee for entering messages into the echo area,
     and will be responsible for content.

     As  I said at the start I am tired of hearing you can't so  I  am
     now  giving  all of you out there who have heard these words  and
     even violated the policy of entering such messages now You have a
     place to do just that.   But rememeber I warned you nothing we do
     any more is free.   I have established a Flat Rate of $10.00  per
     message and this may be used as a guideline.

     Echo Area Guidelines are as follows:

     1.    Only   commercial   advertisements   should   be   entered.
     Advertisements  of  personal  nature's may be  entered  at  local
     sysops discretion.

     2.  Messages should contain only standard american characters, no
     upper ascii should be used.

     3. Messages will remain posted on individual systems for a minimu
     of 30 days or deleted as often as necessary by the sysop.

     4.   Individual  BBS will be responsible for monitoring  messages
     entered by users, and so long as messages are not offensive or do
     not  attack any person place or thing there will be no ground for
     removal from the echo.

     5.   Sysops  may pay for as many months of receipt in advance  as
     they  would  like,  and will receive a full refund for  any  full
     unused months if they request connection termination.

     Ok there you have it.   A way and a means to advertise your stuff
     with  no  hassles and a promise you will not be told  you  cannot
     advertise that here.

                   SCSI-ONE Echo for SCSI Discussions

     There has been a great deal of discussion involving SCSI topics
     lately in HDCONF. Consequently, a need was seen for a dedicated
     area devoted to discussion on the SCSI-1 standard and the
     proposed SCSI-2 standard, as well as the handful of new PC SCSI
     adaptors on the market today. SCSI-ONE was formed for just this
     reason. SCSI-ONE is moderated by Jeff Lengel (the developer
     of the Scsi System One PC SCSI adaptor) of 1:151/121.10 and may
     be used as a forum for discussion by anyone interested in SCSI
     applications, host systems, hardware, and theory. SCSI-ONE is
     available on the Z1 backbone and should be available through
     your local REC. Should you encounter problems getting connected
     to SCSI-ONE, contact me via netmail at 1:151/121.0 to arrange
     a feed.

                           Telegard Does ECHO's!

     Telegard,  a BBS already  known for it's flexibility and powerful
     security,  now adds  ECHOMail support  to it's list of  features.
     Adding an ECHO area to a  Telegard BBS  is as easy as  adding any
     other message area -- and that's EASY!!  The BBS just prompts you
     for the  directory where the  ECHO is stored, and  then with  the
     help of  a small,  quick utility called  TGMAIL,  ECHOMail can be
     easily  Tossed and Scanned  in regular  events controlled  by the
     mailer being used.  This new feature has already been tested with
     D'Bridge and FrontDoor, and other mailers will be tested shortly.

     TGMAIL  not only Tosses  messages into Telegard, but it colorizes
     them  using Telegard  colors to  give a new  'flavor'  to reading
     ECHO's.   The program colors text,  quoted text, origin lines and
     tear  lines all  in different  colors  (all  configurable by  the
     SysOp) to make the messages easier to read.

     For a long time now Telegard has been the choice for closed BBS's
     due to it's strong security.  What many people don't know is that
     ALL  of the security features are optional.   The  flexibility of
     Telegard's menu system makes it  perfect for any environment.  If
     your users tend to like a PCBoard type of menus,  Telegard can be
     easily customized to duplicate EXACTLY every command in virtually
     any  BBS software  available.  The downside  of this  is  that by
     emulating  another  BBS,  you  would  have  to  DISCARD  many  of
     Telegard's features!

     With most BBS's  you can have a menu  option to send  feedback to
     the SysOp.  Telegard has this too.  However, why limit it to just
     that?  Why not a Feedback Menu which allows the user to send mail
     to either the SysOp or any Co-SysOps just by  entering the choice
     off of an easy to follow, 100% custom menu.

     Do you like ANSI Colors  and  Animation?  I do.   Telegard's menu
     and logon systems incorporate a full  ANSI Sub-Sytem which allows
     not  only  different ANSI's  to  be  displayed  based  on  User's
     Access Level, but also  by day of week and  even 10 full randomly
     displayed  ANSI's  for any  or  all of those.   That  means  that
     without  even  accounting for  the  Users Access Level,  you  can
     create up to 70 ANSI's for any  screen including  Menus,  Welcome
     Screens, Bulletins ... the  list is endless.   I've seen Telegard
     SysOps run  out of disk  space from making  ANIS's as  opposed to
     Uploads.   However  this, like everything  in Telegard, is  fully
     optional  and the  SysOp can use  as much  or little  of it as he
     wants.  The authors of Telegard do not  impose there  features on
     SysOps, they offer them.

     Why do I come  here and sing the  praises of Telegard?  I use it.
     If  it wasn't  exactly what I  wanted or couldn't do  something I
     needed and there  was something  else that did,  I would  switch.
     However,  that hasn't happened.   Every time  I have come up with
     a suggestion for Telegard, I have sent it to the authors and nine
     times out of ten  it's in the next release.   Now I'm a Beta Site
     for the software.  Sure, I get errors.  You  don't!  That's why I
     get the errors.   The authors of  Telegard do not lose touch with
     the users of the software.   Bugs are  found in the Beta versions
     and usually fixed  within the next two days.   There are over 100
     Beta Sites nationwide  pushing every part of the software to it's
     limits  and every single bug is vanquished  prior to any Standard
     release coming out.  And this Standard version is FREE to all!

     If you would like to see a  list of Telegard BBS's  in your area,
     there is a  FREQable  file on my BBS  which you  can get with the
     magic  name of TELELIST.  Go ahead, call one.  You'll be glad you
     did!

     A View from the Bridge

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9003.03"

     Howdy!

     Well, it looks like Andy's back on CBS.  Why am I not surprised?

     Geez, what a pain this week was!  I wanted to buy a 32 bit ram
     board for my Hauppauge 386 XT replacement motherboard and put 2
     meg on it.  Simple, no?  Cost me about $500, right?

     Wrong.  First of all, I wanted to get this thing installed
     before the weekend pushed my shipping back to monday or later,
     so I paid the additional $20 to get the card UPS 'red' (and the
     same for the memory.  I wasn't about to pay THEIR prices for
     chips!), but I didn't complain.

     Anyway, I get the board, plug it in, but it only works
     intermittantly.  "What's wrong?" I asks meself, and gets on the
     horn to Hauppauge (day long distance rates!)  What kind of power
     supply you got, they ask.  130 watt, I answer.  Oh, you have to
     have a minimum of 150 watts to run that card, they says.

     Great.  After spending all that extra money to get the stuff
     'next day', I still have to buy a $200 power supply!  Well, no
     time to get cheap.  I buy a 200 watt 'turbo-cool 200' from PC
     Power and Cooling.  Yes, I get it shipped red, again.

     Finally, I get my power supply installed, the memory board is
     running, and I think, gee, what a great time to install that
     SEAgate 4096 hard drive.  I already have the machine apart...

     Well, 36 hours later I was back up and had recovered my D:
     drive.  Needless to say, I was not happy.  Still, I learned my
     lesson again, the same one I've learned all my life...

     Don't rush, and get it right!

     'Till next time...

     Ciao for now!

     The Death of Shareware and Other Good News --

     "Shareware enters mid-life crisis."  I read these paragraphs
     with somewhat backhanded interest; I always do when 'they'
     mention anything about Procomm, but that's another story.

     Ever hear of FONDIR ?  That's my particular excursion into the
     MYTH AND REALITY of Shareware. Now sure, you say, the user
     interface was messed up.  What with all the GUI wars about to
     hit, that's going to become the de facto reason for failure in
     the software industry.  I think the real reason is that
     Shareware is dead.  None too soon.

     Why?  The banner reads Militantly Public Domain.  It's
     Please-Run-Me-Ware, written for the fun of it, shared out of
     pride, and unencumbered by all the license agreement nonsense
     that runs the gamut from 'Please' to 'Will destroy your FAT
     after 3 executions'.

     What this really means is the illusion is gone.  No more
     deception.  Thank the gods.


     The Big Mistake --

     A huge and terrible MISTAKE has been released upon all the
     sysops in the world.  What is it ?  It's the "ARCHIVE
     COMMENT".  It's immoral and probably illegal.  It's a downright
     nuisance.

     It might not be so bad if it was treated like a PATH; you could
     track a program back to it's source.  Will this ever happen ?
     Silly me.

     For this to end, Mr. Katz has to release a NEW HOT compression
     method and the program that implements that compression method
     will have NO ARCHIVE COMMENT facility.  Now wouldn't that be
     special.

     Until then, it's   pkzip -z filename < return   where return is
     a file with a <return> CRLF sequence in it.  This is not what
     it is.


     Big Blue Subterfuge --

     Have you heard the words brother : "COOPERATIVE PROCESSING".
     This is where a certain mainframe database product and an OS2
     based presentation manager will allow you all the RDBMS
     productivity you need.  Well here's the scoop.  It's called
     'Mega Block Mode'.

     FidoNews 7-10                Page 12                   5 Mar 1990


     Hurt by repeated bashing about the inefficiencies of regular
     old Block Mode, Big Blue has gone one better with Mega Block
     Mode.  Your OS2 is not required to do the background
     communications, ( which it may do only slightly worse than a
     Desqview task ), it's the protected mode feature which allows
     you to run huge programs that wouldn't fit in 640k.  Huge
     programs and memory you will need to manipulate the 'Mega
     Block'.

     "Cooperative processing" ( better understood as 'weakest link
     syndrome' ) is simply a less interactive mode of data access.
     You spend hours updating up the data and then send the whole
     thing back, where it's rejected because of a missing parameter
     on line 609.

     Oh my god.

     Cooperate this... <grin>
