     =================================================================


                               In this issue...

     It is with great sadness I learned from Carol and Brenda late
     Tuesday night, that Doug Myers, Editor of FidoNews passed away last
     week.  This is a "Shortie" to fill in for that missing Fido News
     Letter.  I am sure many more would like to have their personal
     eulogies included, but time is of the essence. Any eulogies for
     Doug will be included in the next Fidonews letter.  I felt a great
     loss for Fidonet, and wanted all to know we have lost a very bright
     light in Fido; a light that always tried to illuminate the positive
     and draw peoples of the whole earth, all zones, together in warm
     fun and friendship.

     Doug was deeper than he pretended to be in his humor, and his
     intelligence showed through, "in every pixel on the monitor
     screen!", (courtesy Brenda in a phone conversation early this am).
     I could not have said it better.  I will miss that wonderful sense
     of humor he lavishly inserted in his "one liner" replies. Doug was
     a fair minded editor, about all matters brought to his attention.
     He analyzed everything in a logical light, prepared his comments in
     a way that pulled our hearts and minds above the thorns of
     complaint and conflict,  to smell the sweetness of the roses,
     which are our friendships on this FidoNet world wide web.

     Goodbye to a dear, dear friend.
     Ol'WDB
     ~~~~~~~~~~
     Add me to the above sentiments! I'm sure the position of Fidonews
     Editor will be filled, but the shoes of Doug Myers will not.  Words
     that come to mind are, friend to all, compassion, caring,
     understanding and a million more such.... all totally inadequate in
     their description of Doug.

     Best regards to all,
     Frank  Vest - N124C

     Beautiful tribute.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us here.

     Certainly not off-topic, Warren, and a fine tribute to a friend.

     Thank you..

     I didn't know Doug well but we corresponded intermittently during
     the past few years and I enjoyed our exchanges. He was always
     polite, pleasant, and insightful. FidoNet is poorer for his
     passing.

     Hello All!

     I hate to have to pass this on but I was worried when Doug didn't
     respond to John Souvestre's message about the FidoNews this Monday.
     :(  Here is the message as posted in FN_SYSOP.  Me and Doug had
     gotten close since he selected me to take over the FidoNews in his
     absence back in April and then he ended up not having to have
     surgery but had a balloon angioplasty instead.  I just hate the
     news that another of our dear FidoNet friends has died. :(

     In writing this letter seems to be one of the hardest things I have
     to do. This is let you know that  Doug Myers  passed away on
     September. 17, 2000  Sunday at approximately 8 P.M. in his sleep. I
     know this is a great loss to our Fidonet Community.

     His funeral will be at Fort Indiantown Gap just outside of
     Harrisburg, Pa. The Funeral will be on Thursday  Sept 28, 2000 at
     12:30 P.M.  If anyone is interested in attending you must be at
     Fort Indiantown Gap by 12:15P.M.

     Doug will be buried with Military Honors. Any questions please feel
     free to netmail me at 1:270/911  or email me at john@9-1-1.org

            John
       Harrisburg, Pa.
     ~~~~~~~~~

     I still don't know what to say other than I am heart broken and
     confused at the suddeness of it all.  The good part is he
     apparently passed away quietly in his sleep.  I must assume no pain
     as I have no other information.

     I may well be unavailable 28 SEP.  I am trying to rapid-fix a
     schedule so I can get up to PA from here for his funeral.  No
     promises that I can, but I will *try*.

     The Navy flag presentation, is done this way:

     With extreme care and full precision, the American Flag is carried
     to the one who is to receive it.  (Wife, son etc). Come to a snappy
     halt 1/2 pace from them and render a salute, looking them directly
     FIDONEWS 17-39               Page 3                   24 Sep 2000


     in the eyes.  (count of 5 at slow pace) then drop salute and
     gracefully drop to one knee while bringing the flag to the fore on
     2 outstretched hands.

     " Ms/Mr/David/{insert name of person recieving flag}, On behalf of
     a grateful nation, The {insert branch served in}, and the President
     of the United States, we present to you this flag in honor of
     {insert name/rank} faithful service"

     Rise slowly and salute.

     The 21 gun salute (3 sets from 7 people) follows during the salute
     which is dropped after the 3rd volley.

     Other branches have other traditions....   God rest your soul
     Doug..... xxcarol

     Subject: Talk to me
     Date: Saturday, March 18, 2000 5:55 PM
     As you got up this morning,
     I watched  you,
     and hoped you would talk to me,
     even if it was just a few words,
     asking my opinion or thanking me
     for something good that happened
     in your life yesterday.

     But I noticed you were too busy,
     trying to find the right outfit to wear.
     When you ran around the house getting ready,
     I knew there would be a few minutes
     for you to stop and say hello
     but you were to busy

     At one point you had to wait
     fifteen minutes with nothing to do
     except sit in a chair.
     Then I saw you spring to your feet.
     I thought you wanted to talk to me
     but you ran to the phone and called a friend
     to get the latest gossip instead.
     I watched patiently all day long.
     With all your activities
     I guess you were too busy to say
     anything to me

     I noticed that before lunch you looked around,
     maybe you felt embarrassed to talk to me,
     that is why you didn't bow your head.
     You glanced three or four tables over
     and you noticed some of your friends
     FIDONEWS 17-39               Page 4                   24 Sep 2000

     talking to me briefly before they ate, but you didn't.
     That's okay.

     There is still more time left
     and I hope that you will talk to me yet.
     You went home and it seems as if
     you had lots of things to do.
     After a few of them were done,
     you turned on the TV.
     I don't know if you like TV or not,
     just about anything goes there
     and you spend a lot of time
     each day in front of it
     not thinking about anything,
     just enjoying the show.
     I waited patiently again
     as you watched the TV and ate your meal,
     but again you didn't talk to me.

     Bedtime I guess you felt too tired.
     After you said goodnight to your family
     you plopped into bed and fell asleep in no time.
     That's okay because you may not realize
     that I am always there for you.

     I've got patience,
     more than you will ever know.
     I even want to teach you how
     to be patient with others as well.
     I love you so much that I wait
     everyday for a nod, prayer or thought
     or a thankful part of your heart.

     It is hard to have a one-sided conversation.
     Well, you are getting up once again.
     And once again I will wait,
     with nothing but love for you.

     Hoping that today you will give me some time.
     Have a nice day!
     Your friend,
     GOD

     P.S. - Do you have enough time to send this to another
     person?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
     Doug is in God's hands now,  no more pain.  We had talked about
     the angioplasty we both have endured, and the pain of the weight of
     a locomotive sitting on our chests.  God bless you Doug.
