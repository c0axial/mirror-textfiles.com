========================================================================
                              Editorial
========================================================================
    We are running a bit behind today, so this will be a short
editorial. (no sighs of relief, please).

    There is an article called "A short revisit ..." regarding
archivers, that bears a note of explanation.  In it, Mr. McMahon
notes that we refused to print an article.  That is not quite
true.  The article in question (in fact all of Mr. McMahon's
articles) bore no resemblance to ARTSPEC.DOC whatsoever.  Now
when that normally happens, we curse a tad, then proceed to
reformat the article, put a title in, etc.  That is what we did
with the first three articles by Mr. McMahon, and this last one.
However, the article in question contained a couple of pages of
tables that were all too wide to print, and to simply justify the
text would not have made sense.  We therefore netmailed him, and
asked him to set it up in a format that did not require vast
amounts of work by ourselves.

    Judging by this week's article, he did not get that netmail.
It was routed, as our phone bill cannot stand all the snooze
correspondance going out crash.  Perhaps the fact that he runs
as a point has something to do with that.  However, our policy
is to print everything we get that has to do with the net.
["hey, whaddya mean, POLICY.....policy ?  WHAT policy ?]

   We did get some heart warming and inspiring mail lately.  One
person wrote indicating playful enjoyment of trying to guess
which editor wrote what.  Personally, i like to think of these
editorials as a microcosm of FidoNet in the sense that whatever
gets written by us is generated by a wide range of types of
dialogue.  We don't always agree about much, other than the
importance of producing the snooze.  I think what we come up with
together is better than what we would produce in isolation.

  Partly in response to readers' mail about the format of the
Snooze, i'd like to again raise the idea of publishing the
Snooze in two formats:  one to be read only by people in a
visually pleasing format which could change depending on what
gets submitted,  and another to be read only by machines in a
strict format according to specs [yet to be formed] so that door
programmers can have something practical to work with.  With two
formats, human readers won't be bothered by restrictions made
necessary by door programs, and programmers can have a free hand
in creating ways of mounting the snooze.  Both formats could be
sent around just like the one is now.

   In persuing the topic of e-zines and their potential, you
might pleasantly anticipate a forthcoming series of articles by
several people that responded to last weeks editorial.

   Oh yes, sorry that this editorial is so long.  The other
editor added to it.

Out of bounds.
By:Nils Hammar
2:205/601@fidonet
4341@msg.abc.se
nils@f109f.fdata.se

From my opinion, there are several topics in fidonews that are
out of bounds right now.

1. The compression war.
   Why fight about the best compression program, there will be a new
   better program next week, and every program doesn't run on every
   platform. I'm looking for a mailer for VMS 5.3 right now.

2. The use of pirated/hacked/whatsoever software in fidonews.
   If you use the tool for daily work and somebody claims money
   for it - Pay!

3. ZC:s, RC:s and NC:s that are annoying, excessively annoying or
   breaking the law. I don't care if sysop John Doe is in conflict
   with Albert Einstein III in Z1 when I'm in a calm part of Z2.
   There are better ways to solve problems like that than having
   a flame war here in the world wide fidonews.

What I would like to see is more about the social and cultural life
of the sysops and their friends around the world. Some people in
Z1 (and other parts of the world too) are often confusing Sweden
with Switzerland for example.

(For those who don't know, Switzerland is right north of Italy,
while Sweden are north of Germany and west of Russia)

I am living in Sweden, less than 100 kilometers south of the
polar circle. This will place me closer to the north pole than
Fairbanks in Alaska! But any snow isn't expected until late October.

For those who wonder about reindeers, Yes we have those animals here,
but they aren't running around in the streets! Only on the roads,
especially when there is a lot of snow, since it's easier to run
on the road then! We also have a lot of other animals running around
here, like elks and bears, and even a few wolves, but they are very
rare. This sunday the hunting season for elks started (so I woldn't
recommend you to run out in the woods in the early morning in a dark
suit...)

One thing that is special with Sweden is that anybody may leave the
road by foot (or any unmotorized veichle) without permission of the
landowner.

This right has however some limitations. You may not disturb the
growth of whatever is growing in that area, you shouldn't make a fire
FidoNews 10-37                 Page:  4                    13 Sep 1993

unless it's completely necessary and it must be completely fireproof.
You may not use live trees to anything unless it's an emergency.
(It's also a bad idea trying to make a fire with a living tree -
it would only create a lot of smoke without any heat)
It is also not allowed to disturb the animals more than necessary
if you are out walking. Any gates that you have to pass must be closed
when you have passed, since it wouldn't be any fun for the owner of a
hundred cows or sheeps trying to find them in the woods.

One thing that I would recommend you if you want to visit Sweden as
a tourist is to do it by train, foot or by bicycle. It's possible to
rent bicycles in some parts of Sweden, especially the island Gotland
(which have a lot of history. (On a few maps Gotland might seem to be
Russian, but that's not true.)

The major city of Gotland, Visby has a stone wall that is about 800
years old and several other buildings of the same age.
Gotland is a very nice part of Sweden for a person that has even the
slightest interest in history. It was one of the largest commercial
marketplaces in northern europe during the middle age.
There are also a lot of beaches all around Gotland if you like to
take a bath or only being lazy.

If you like sailing, it is also a good idea to take a trip to Sweden,
but you have to watch out in some parts, since some areas around the
coast are military restricted areas, and a good navigation equipment
is also recommended, since if you are sailing to Stockholm, you will
find out that you are in an archipelago (did I get that right) that
is one of the largest in the world. The correct number of islands
wasn't stated until the 20th century. If you are going to count all
islands, you will have to use more than one summer! :-)

If you are a dirt bike rider, you would probably want to visit the
Gotland grand national, which is celebrating it's 9th anniversary
this year in November. This is a REAL dirt bike race with between
1200 and 1500 participants starting at almost the same time!
Somebody said that this is the worlds largest dirt bike race counting
the number of participants. Since everybody starts at almost the same
time, it's possible for anybody to compare themselves with the world
champions in this game (and a lot of them are here). If you are afraid
of real dirt - stay out!
There are several classes in this race. A few are here: 125cc, 250cc,
500cc and 4-stroke.
Some years ago, the oldest participant was over 70 years!
Anyone interested may contact me, and I will try to pass you some
more information.

If your native language is english, don't be afraid of coming to Sweden,
the majority of the swedes understand english, but are often afraid of
speaking english (me too:-))!

If you come from the US, you will probably find Sweden rather cheap
right now, since our currency is rather weak compared to the US dollar
and the japanese Yen.

FidoNews 10-37                 Page:  5                    13 Sep 1993

There are a lot of other special attractions here in Sweden to hang on
too, but I have chosen a few here, and I hope that you who read this
also writes an article that choses a few goldies about your country
that you think is nice to know to the world.

(Excuse me if my english are confusing in some parts. It's hard to
explain some things in a non-native language.)

CONTROLLING ECHO ACTIVITY, cont'd

Just to follow-up on my article titled CONTROLLING ECHO ACTIVITY...
AND ELIMINATING MODERATOR CENSORSHIP in FidoNews 10-35, I'd like to
thank those of you who have replied to me by NetMail, and suggest
the formation of an informal working group to study the whole question
of using content codes instead of a fixed list of echos.   If this
were the InterNet, I'd probably set this up as a mailing-list or mail
reflector, so that contributions from anyone would be sent out to
all the members of the group.  In fact, I may do that anyway, if there
seems to be enough interest shown by people with InterNet access.
But meanwhile, here on FidoNet, the answer is probably an echo.  Can
anyone recommend an appropriate one?

So far, the responses I have received on this subject have been quite
positive, and I will post a summary of our discussions at a future date.
Anyone who would like to contribute or comment is invited to contact me
at one of these addresses:

 dwilson@chaserv.almanac.bc.ca           --  InterNet

Thanks,

Updating Nodelist Flags
Re: Updating Nodelist Flags
Chris Farrar (1:246/20)

    In issue or two ago, there was an article regarding updating flags
on some entries in the nodelist, specifically the HST, H14 and H16 flags
to reflect the current "State of the Art" flags.  There is only one
problem with this.  A large number of systems are using FrontDoor
2.02/NC by Joaquim Homrighausen.  FrontDoor 2.02 won't recognize the H14
and H16 flags as indicating an HST modem.  By updating all nodes to
these flags, before the mailers are capable of recognizing and acting on
the flags, will hinder, not help, communications in FidoNet.

    While talking of nodelist flags, I would also like to propose that
we create 2 new flags for the nodelist, which I propose be CID and NBL.
As most people in Zone 1 are aware, Caller ID is springing up as an
optional feature of most phone companies.  The flag CID would be used to
indicate that a node is using Caller ID, so those with privacy fetishes
would know not to call them for fear of their number being recorded
(even though in most cases they gave out their phone number when they
first called the BBS).  The companion flag, NBL, would be used to
indicate that the system will not accept calls from people who block
their number from being displayed.  This would easily let people who
want to hide their numbers to using routing commands to always route
mail to nodes with NBL flags.

A short revisit to the archiver question.
Shawn McMahon
1:206/1701.666

I submitted a new article, in which I re-did my previous tests of various
archivers on Fidonet mail, with all the valid concerns expressed to me
corrected.

The Editors of Fidonews have chosen not to print it; no problem.

They've also chosen not to respond to netmail asking why; no problem.

Here's a quick breakdown of the contents:

I took out HAP, added ARJ 2.41, and used a whole week's worth of mail to
build a larger packet.  I corrected a couple of typos that made my results
irreproducible with the command-lines given.

Everything came out in the same place on the list.

ARJ 2.41 in maximum compression mode created larger archives than PKZIP
2.04g in default; PKZIP 2.04g in maximum compression mode ran faster than
ARJ in default.  ARJ still remained in the same place on the list, however.

FidoNews 10-37                 Page:  9                    13 Sep 1993

I had hoped to publish this one last large article, then update it
incrementally as new archivers became available to me; that appears not to
be about to happen anytime soon.

There's nothing I can do about it; I'm not a listed node at present, so
there's little I can do about the Editors ignoring my mail.  I won't sweat
the small stuff, however.

If anybody wants a copy of the test, lemme know and I'll netmail it to you.

BTW, informal testing of Info-ZIP's ZIP-compatible archiver shows that it's
REALLY slow, but actually produces slightly smaller archives than PKZip
2.04g.  It fits in the chart just below PKZip.

With luck, I'll be a full node again soon; if so, I'll make an effort to
have every possible relevant archiver for every system on-line, and test all
the MS-DOS (and, by that time, OS/2) ones in as scientific a manner as
possible.  I'll make those results available via a magic name, and see if I
can't work out some kind of deal with the Editors for a periodic (yearly?
bi-yearly?  Netmail me if you care) update article.

Again, I must reiterate; the standard is only there for dealing with people
you haven't dealt with before.  The first time you send somebody netmail,
ask him if he supports your favorite archiver.  My system supports every
archiver I tested, except HAP which I shouldn't have tested in the first
place.

If you want your echomail in your favorite format, then get it from somebody
who supports that format.  As for your nodediffs; give your hub a break, ok?
If he can't give it to you in ZIP format, then get it from somebody else.
If you want that extra couple of percent compression on it, get a life!
Jeez, it's only a couple of seconds.

BTW, just for the record; despite what Carlos Bazan said, saving 45% on
files that are several megs in size isn't 1%, and it isn't 10k, and it isn't
insignificant.  Nor do even a dozen articles on the subject add up to
thousands of echo messages a day.  I didn't pluck that 45% out of a hat;
that's about the average savings OVER ARC of all the top archivers I've
tested.  The extra couple of bytes saved by using Squeeze or Hpack instead
of ARJ or ZIP may be irrelevant; the extra megs saved by using SOMETHING
other than ARC, and thus literally THOUSANDS of dollars on some systems,
certainly IS relevant.  I'm obviously not the only person who thinks so, or
the Snooze wouldn't be shipped LHArced.

Re: WORD OF WARNING!!!!!!!!!
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| WARNING TO ALL MAXIMUS SYSOPS!  READ THIS!  VERY IMPORTANT!!!! |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+

There is a very easy way for a  user  to  crash  your  Max  board...!
Tonight,  it was brought to my attention by Ming Ho (1:250/526).  One
a couple of occasions, a  Maximus  board  known  as  "The  OH!  Zone"
(non-Fido  BBS)  was  crashed  by  the  user  issuing  the  following
commands; first, they would use the yell option,  and  then  for  the
reason, they put:

                              %16,%f,e.t.c

Although  the  "e.t.c"  part  more than likely means nothing, the "%"
means a lot to Dos.  I have thoroughly tested this on my system.   It
 *does*  work.   There is a simple solution for it however (which I've
also tested).

To avoid this hassle, edit your "Yell.Mec"  (or  whatever  file  your
system  invokes  when  the  user  presses 'Y' from the Main Menu) and
change the line that reads:

                     [log]+User yelled about "%J".

                               to read:

                     [log]+User yelled for you.

The reason you do this is because if you don't, there will be an  FPU
error.  Much  like as in a programming language, Dos cannot store the
wrong data-type in a wrongfully declared memory region.   It  has  no
'type-caste' precautions built-in to it and consequently doesn't know
how to handle a  statement  such  as  above,  i.e.  the  reason  it's
crashing  is because the user is making an illegal call to the memory
regions of the machine-- this is why  the  system  crashes,  and  you
 *must* hard-boot it!

I  urge all sysops to make these changes as soon as possible.  If you
must log the reason, then use the [store] or  [write]  statement,  do
not use any codes with the "%" sign in them.  There are other ways to
log it if you like, I would pursue those avenues if a reason to  chat
is absolutely essential for you to know even when you're not there.

I  would  now  like to thank Ming Ho and Raffi Shahinian for bringing
this problem to my attention, and also to Ming Ho for testing it  out
for me.

I  have  the  user  name,  and  his  telephone  number (although it's
probably fake). He has tried to log onto  my  system  with  different
names  etc.  now.   I will release this information to any sysop that
feels they require it, or I could post  it  in  this  echo.   I  just
FidoNews 10-37                 Page: 11                    13 Sep 1993

wasn't  sure if I was being 'fair' if I put all of his information in
this echo.

I hope that this message is of some help to you (of course  it  is!).
By the way, this does not exempt OS/2 users either.

IMUS in the Morning ECHO
by Anthony Grillo
   1:272/94
                       IMUS in the Morning ECHO

I will be moderating a new echo available from 1:272/94 discussing the
phenomenon known as the "I" man.

The "I" man is John Donald (Don) Imus the original shock jock that has
captured the commuting audience of the New York Tri-State area for the
last 20 years. He originally broadcast on 660 AM radio on the flagship
station of the NBC network, WNBC. 50,000 watts on a clear channel
frequency that can be heard over a multi-state area. A few years ago
NBC sold the transmitter to a fledgling and struggling sports station
WFAN. WFAN began broadcasting on the 660 AM frequency and is now the
top billing station in NY. Of course IMUS the egomaniac takes all the
credit.

The "IMUS in the Morning Show" can be heard from 5:30am to 10:00am
Monday to Friday. But you don't have to tune to 660 AM if your in the
following areas.

Boston, MA              Providence, RI          Scranton, PA
Tampa, FL               Washington, DC

The NATCOM satellite is carrying the program for radio stations that
want to broadcast the show. If you in one of the above areas check the
AM or FM bands for the show. Most stations pick the show up starting
at 7am. More stations will be coming on the air in the following
months and we will announce them on the echo.

Listen in and laugh as IMUS lampoons, politicians, TV personalities,
newspaper reporters and callers while he talks to them on the air.

So give it a try. Call the Monroe Electronic Mall 1-914-783-0992 or
request an echo feed from 1:272/94.

1:170 XAB.  My views

By: Todd Basnaw.  1:170/911
Another 1:170 sysop talks.

This is my first article here.  I never had a reason to write before now.
As mentioned by Tim Winters, this IS a hobby.  Everything about networking
and BBS's will always be a hobby, but some people JUST DON'T GET IT.
Jason Garcia isn't the first person Bruce Bodger has attempted to
harass (XAB) about the registration discussion.  When I first started
out in Fidonet, Bruce decided to harass me too.  Telling me to register
RA or else.  I finally got tired of it and switched over to EzyCom.
If this isn't XAB, then I'm not sure what is.  I was finding "warnings"
in my mail folder every day for a week until I switched!
What I don't understand is WHY they are being allowed to harass people
about registration when it has nothing to do with the network.
If they don't like it, then they need to take it up directly WITHOUT
getting ANY network involved!

I'm not sure if anyone has noticed, but there's been a rash of drop-outs
from the 1:170 zone because of Bruce Bodger and JB Graham.  I agree
with Mr. L's suggestion.  Warnings won't work with these two and they
think they're GOD around here.
Any comments are welcome in MY mail folder.  1:170/911.  Todd Basnaw

RAH Celebrates Its "Paper" Anniversary

RAH Celebrates Its "Paper" Anniversary
by Dave Bealer (1:261/1129)

One year ago something new hit the online world.  Random Access Humor
(RAH), the first electronic magazine dedicated to personal computer/
communications humor, debuted on 9/1/92.  RAH pokes fun at draconian
sysops, goose-stepping moderators, and twits in all their infinite
variety.

RAH is a great experiment, one that appears to be succeeding.  The
list of official RAH distributors has expanded from five systems, all
in North America, to almost 60 systems on three continents.  Best of
all, the official distribution sites are just the tip of the RAH
iceberg.  Only 5% of the responses to our first reader survey came
from listed systems.  This indicates total RAH distribution of around
1,200 bulletin board systems worldwide.

These sysops (and their users) are attracted to RAH's irregular
features, like The Twit Filter, the Grunged Glossary, and the RAH
Humor Review.  Articles by resident crazies Greg Borek, Rob Novak,
Ray Koziel, and the maddest hatter of all, yours truly, are also
quite popular.

RAH is available in ASCII Text and READROOM.TOC format.  The latter
format supports the popular Readroom BBS Door.  Dozens of boards
FidoNews 10-37                 Page: 13                    13 Sep 1993

around the country (including such insignificant operations as
EXEC-PC and Channel 1) use the Readroom Door to allow their users to
read electronic magazines (emags), including RAH, online.  Readroom
can be used with any BBS software package capable of generating a
DOOR.SYS drop file.

RAH is distributed on the following file echoes each month:
NEWSLETR (SDS), and EP-MAG (EPubNet).  Both of these echoes ride the
Filebone.  RAH is available (Text only) to Internet users via
anonymous FTP from:  nic.cic.net
     dir: pub/nircomm/gopher/e-serials/alphabetic/r/rah

RAH is also available at the following FidoNet boards:

The Hypothetical Hypocritical Hypochondriac ZC
George Dorn

Please note that the story that follows is pure fiction, and any
similarity between the persons described and any persons who are
currently or have in the past breathed the mixture of gases that we
generally refer to as the atmosphere of the planet Earth are totally
hypothetical. This will become immediately apparent to all readers
as there has never been, to my knowledge, a female ZC. Perhaps it's
time we rectified that as well.

The person described herein may be considered a hypocritical
hypochondriac, and if any particular ZC thinks the story applies to
them in some way, well maybe they're paranoid as well. ;-) Is mental
instability a basis for removal of a *C I wonder?

Once upon a time, there was a ZC out in FidoLand, and she upset the
SysOps in a Region in her Zone, by assuming the RC post of that
Region, even though she didn't live in the Region.

Then, when she had finished that, she decided to ignore the wishes
of the SysOps in another Region in her Zone, when they complained
about reorganisation, because reorganisation was "Policy Compliant",
and indeed although there was a lot of suggestion that she was
involved in the reorganisation, she said that anyone who said she
was involved was a liar, and she would sue them and get lots of
money from them for their nasty lies.

Next she said that a SysOp who said he was going to get a legal
judgement on the application of Policy in another Region was a
FidoNews 10-37                 Page: 16                    13 Sep 1993

blackmailer. She then removed the RC, and installed herself in the
RC post as she didn't live in the Region and it meant the SysOp
couldn't sue her, and was generally bossy as all women are.

Then she said that anyone who threatened another sysop with court
action was a blackmailer and was XAB.

Now it so happened that some SysOps didn't like what she did, and
they wrote Articles in FidoNews complaining about her behaviour, and
she saw these, and she was mightily angry, and she ranted and raved
and threatened the SysOps with XABs and Court Actions (remember, she
said that a threat of court action is Blackmail) and she wrote nasty
letters to the editors of FidoNews, and she made the bold SysOps who
had put their names to their articles retract their statements, and
she went purple with rage and had apoplectic fits because other
people had written articles anonymously and she couldn't make them
retract those articles.

So, the moral of this story is simple, and is there for all to see,
do not upset the whinging woman ZC lest she have a purle fit and
suffer a stroke or some other such illness through her bad temper.

YES!!

(Even when it's someone else taking your money (long circuit I'm
thinking of, not robbery).

Substantial changes in San Fransicko. Lots of businesses closing. People
on the street. Etc. But also -- lots of "boho" type places, instead of
charging $7 for a shitty breakfast in a "boho" punk neighborhood, umm,
the bridge & tunnel crowd no longer has in interest in slumming for fun.

Instead, they're actually *becoming* punk grunge cafes with homemade
stuff because, its all people can afford (will buy) and instead of fake
dirt, it's real dirt.

The TV subsume/consume culture can seemingly vampirize any potential
threat, be it punk, Seattle grunge, rock'n'roll, whatever. However
there's two things that don't work in that scheme (eg. show up at
Macy's)

ACTUAL sex and DIRT.

Sex, they approach from all angles, but real SEX is sticky, smelly,
FidoNews 10-37                 Page: 17                    13 Sep 1993

slippery, and seeing two people FUCK ... looks silly! It's goofy! One of
the utterly LAST things people want to do is NOT LOOK SERIOUS. Sex also
means dirt (...) and bodies (scary!) and touching, and... the insides od
their heads, the worst of all.

DIRT is... the antithesis of Western culture. You could measure "class"
by the amount of dirt tolerated. No one wants it. A dirt "look" might
sell -- the Seattle grunge thing, ripped jeans, all that -- but ACTUAL
dirt is like SEX.

The crustcore punx have dirt as their central theme. Actual, crusty,
filthy, filth. There's even crustcore music. I am not kidding. I love
the crustcore kids. There are small crustcore enclaves, that hop trains
(really) and hitchike, and now overlap the Rainbow family (check out one
of their gatherings sometime, though you'll likely not lik ea lot of the
crowd it is an amazing even nonetheless). A lot of them are castoff
fuckup kids.

San Fran in places (that I like) is developing a comfortable layer of
well-worn dirt. It is Authentic dirt. Not for looks. It's the dirt of
sex, the kind you don't mind. Like the crud that accumulates in drawers,
corners, etc. It only grosses you out when its SOMEONE ELSES DIRT! Like
moving into a new apartment, the dirt in drawers is somehow... icky. But
your own dirt, who notices?

(Maybe this is behind why the Normals HATE ALL DIRT -- THEY ARE ALIENS
EVEN TO THEMSELVES!!!)

A local "hip" restaraunt, the New Dawn, used to attract the art school
kids, out-of-town wannabees and such.. it's a sort of trashed out
restaraunt, with "kitchy" decorations, bad paintings, pervert art, bad
food, etc. It was of course over priced and populted with hipsters. NO
MORE! They're open later, for dinner, and have a $1.98 breakfast
special, after 3pm! The food still sucks, but now they have real punks
and locals eating there.

People also seem to be getting more tattoos and other line-drawing
decorations; it's like, it doesn't matter any more. I'm not gonna be
able to be a Bank Teller during the day anyways, so what the fuck what I
look like, I might as well like it.

I like these lines being drawn. Assuming we hav to have the other part,
ie. poverty on the rise. It's wartime, is all. I have no doubt the
Normals will not win.

.EXE, so you'll still need PKUnZip to extract it. "Why would I
want it anyway"?  Well, it will do things that PKUnZip won't,
like zip subdirectories by default instead of by special switch,

There's now a new one of the "BIGBRO" files, which contain info
on the US govt.'s Clipper/Capstone/Skipjack encryption scheme
(it has builtin backdoors for "law enforcement" snooping, and
the plan will only succeed if they OUTLAW all other forms of
cryptography), and other threats to your privacy, plus all sorts
of analysis, commentary, letters to send to congress, etc etc.

The new one is BIGBRO4.ZIP. You can FREQ the whole "set" as
magicname  BIGBRO,  or  just get the individual files as
BIGBRO.ZIP, BIGBRO2.ZIP, BIGBRO3.ZIP, and BIGBRO4.ZIP.  You do
not have to be Fido nodelisted to FREQ these files, 24 hrs.
Note: the full set is between 700 and 800k. BIGBRO4.ZIP is about
350k or so.

BigBro4 has a lot of info on the PKP-RSADSI scandal with NIST
(over DSA/DSS encryption licensing and bogus  monopolistic
patents on properties of mathematics. Besides that, there's
some info on CPSR, EFF-Austin and other groups, analysis of
Clipper from both sides, and more.

IndraNet, a small-but-growing OtherNet (FTSC and QWK), which has
NO policy, NO coordinators, and NO moderators, where freedom of

Some Responses to Last Issue

In "Change Nodelist Archiver Rebuttal", David Johnson 1:244/117 says:

".ZIP - an unzip package is available for every machine that I know
of, but the corresponding .zip create requires more memory than is
available on ALL machines.. Will both the Create and UnCreate run in
64K is probably a reasonable criteria for determine whether or not a
specific archiver will be used."

64K? Maybe someone took that joke about the Timex Sinclair
seriously... At any rate, all that's needed is to get the InfoZip
source code, and strip out everything that is not essential for the
FidoNews 10-37                 Page: 19                    13 Sep 1993

mail use of a ZIP archiver (such as passwording, encryption, ZIPing
directories, etc etc. Just the basics. I'd suspect the result would
fit into 64K quite nicely.

In "Open letter to ZCs and the IC", Joaquim Homrighausen 2:270/17
says:

"I'm sure I'm out of line, have used all the wrong examples, gotten
the picture wrong, and everything else that can be said about this
message.. so, with all due respect, GMAFB."

I for one wouldn't say you are out of line; you have interests to
protect like anyone else. However, the thrust of your argument seems
to rely on the following:

"It is stated over and over again that FidoNet is an amateur network.
In which case, what does the US (or any nation's) justice system have
to do with an amateur network? A copyright is a copyright. It is not
a grey area of definitions that can be judged or interpreted by means
of personal opinions, or is it?"

I hate to point it out, but that's doublethink. Copyright is a law
issue, nothing more nothing less. Your idea seems to amount to "What
does the justice system have to do with Fido? Except of course when
it comes to copyright." I'd also like to point out that copyright law
differs from country to country, so in many cases it IS a grey area.
I have to firmly agree with those who decry the Garcia Incident as a
load of crap, on the grounds that until Mr. Garcia, or anyone else,
is actually convicted, they are not guilty. Beyond that, I also
question the wisdom of kicking someone out of the net for such an
infraction in the first place, for a lot of reasons.

This is not to say I support piracy, as someone or other accused me
of doing previously. It's just my opinion that the issue of piracy
is not one which Fido need concern itself with, there being things
like legal systems to deal with it already. Last I looked this was
supposed to be a NETWORK, not a government or software registration
enforcement agency. Oh well. As for the matter of people pirating
YOUR "warez", perhaps you should look into software methods of
preventing it. Anything but using Fido as a copy-protection
mechanism.

"TITLE of Article,  POLICY 4"
Dan Mancuso, Another BBS?, 1:301/0,  NC301

Dear Friends...

(I wanted to start off friendly)

Recently, one of the Sysops here in Net 301 decided to express his
opinion to the Fido World... I was unaware this article was planned,
and in fact as of the writing of this reply, I have not even read it.
My reply has nothing to do with the content of that article.
FidoNews 10-37                 Page: 20                    13 Sep 1993


I decided to put this short note in FidoNews to ask folks a favor...
Please take the time to read POLICY 4 a little closer before you
start asking, requesting, or demanding a NC remove or otherwise take
action against a sysop for having an opinion.

I think most folks would be rather surprised at how little real power
is afforded to an NC (or RC for that matter) As I read it, an NC can
remove a node only if it becomes technically incapable of properly
moving NetMail (note: this does not include echomail, unless it
interferes with the movement of NetMail.) Oh, I suppose if you read
through the examples you could find other example of where an NC
could take advantage of his/her position...

All I want to say on the matter is: Unless a sysop is somehow
interfering with the proper operation of FidoNet, do not ask an NC to
take action. The NC's function is to maintain the NodeList for his
network, distribute the nodediff, FidoNews, and policy updates, and
NOT to be the Network BABYSITTER

In Net301, we had a history of seemingly serious problems between the
sysops of our network... My solution to the 5 year problem was the
simplest I could think of... I eliminated the "Official Net Echo"
and the arguments, disgust, and so on, went completely away! It
appeared to me that mosty of the percieved problems were imaginary.
and after the removal of the echo where all the flaming took place,
Net 301 has become a quieter, and much friendlier place...

Perhaps some of you can learn from this... if not, Please try to
limit your complaints to that which really make a difference. As
some of you noticed (those who netmailed me asking me to take action
against Stanton McCandlish) have discovered, I have a tendancy to
ignore those types of messages, unless they have technical merit. So
many messages were recieved and still continue to arrive, that I felt
this was the easiest and quickest way to let people know what kind of
action I was planning to take.

Thank you for listening!
