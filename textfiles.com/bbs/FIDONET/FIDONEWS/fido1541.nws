     Greetings,

     How many Policies does FidoNet need?  Is Policy 4 not enough?
     Now there are moves, to have an Echo Policy - again.

     And how many hats does a *C's have to wear?  Is one not enough?

     Yes, call me the question _man_ if you like.  And you may wonder
     why this time. :-)

     Personally, I do not believe the *EC structure should exist.  Get
     rid of them bunch as they do nothing worth while.  Let the *C
     structure take care of ALL that it is suppose too, including that
     what the current *EC structure is doing.

     During my stint as Z5C, I voted for the current Z1C, to take the
     IC position.  So he got it, but is it not time for Bob to hand
     the Z1C chair over?  Just after the election of IC, Bob sent me
     e-mail, asking what I thought of a few items, including that if
     he should resign as Z1C.  My answer to him was, YES!  I do not
     believe, that the interest of the Nodes in Z1 is best served by
     having him holding office of both positions.

     Sorry Bob, this is not a vendatta to have you removed as Z1C,
     in fact, I could care less if you wear the hats of both.

     One of these days, we'll have more office bearers than Nodes.
     What's an office bearer?  Someone, who carries his office on his
     shoulders.  But you get my idea, no?

     Talking about Policies.

     Region 24 in Zone 2, has asked the IC for approval of a Policy.
     Sure, let them have a Policy of their own, but should it override
     Policy 4?

     Happy reading,

     =================================================================


                       Stepping into the Hornet's Nest

     Welcome me to the ranks of one of Fido's most persevering entities:
     the rebel without a clue.  In a brilliant display of naivete, I've
     managed to mention the terms "feed cut," "policy," and "committee"
     all in the same breath... in the MODERATOR echo! Judging by the
     heat, there are no other terms used in Fidotalk so emotionally
     charged.

     Actually, this particular hornet's nest has been swarming just about
     forever, and I'm not the first who has ever stirred it.  Perhaps
     that's the reason Policy 4 speaks in hushed tones about matters
     echomail.  Lacking any formal policy, moderators and sysops have
     generally followed an informal set of guidelines collected in the
     North American Backbone's BOFAQ text file, distributed on the
     BACKBONE file area on a monthly basis.  Most agree that the informal
     method has worked well, and may even be optimum.

     But now we're talking about feed cuts, which aren't going to work
     well no matter what system is used.  A feed cut is the ultimate
     confession that the purely voluntary approach to echo moderation and
     distribution has failed in one small area.  A moderator doesn't like
     to employ it - he's spent a lot of time trying to promote the
     conversation, not kill it.  A sysop doesn't like to make the cut -
     he's spent a good part of his life bringing people into his system,
     not ushering them out.

     No one even likes to talk about feed cuts.

     But then, that's the reason such a thing should be talked about in
     advance.  When it's necessary, when the heat is on and the
     atmosphere is emotionally charged, it's just the wrong time to be
     discussing philosophy and organizational charts, who's in charge and
     who does what.

     But the conversation is going well.  My motives have been
     challenged, my premises have been challenged... but my lineage is
     still not a subject for discussion :)  It's a good start for a Fido
     bash!

                     Elections - What's Happening or Not

     I'd promised in earlier editions to keep you all informed on the
     election for Z1EC.  Unfortunately, after I'd made this commitment,
     things started not happening.  The Z1EC had been replaced, and an
     interim Z1EC assumed the duties.  Or should I say "duty," for the
     job description specified that the interim Z1EC's sole duty is to
     conduct an election for the permanent ZEC.

     Bob Satti, however, charged the RECC to determine how to select the
     next ZEC.  This led most to assume that there would be some minor
     changes before a sysop-level election was held, but rumor has it
     that the RECC has other thoughts.

     So the news is that the RECC is poised to not decide to appoint a
     ZEC, or else they're poised to decide not to appoint a ZEC.

     In stark contrast to the non-election in the ZEC echo, the folks in
     the FN_SYSOP echo are taking a wham-bang no nonsense approach.
     After a couple weeks of nominations, I missed reading for a few days
     and found, upon catching up, that we were in the middle of a three
     day election.  I'd mention the candidates and urge you to vote, but
     if you didn't vote yet, then it's over.

     Just in case either of the above echoes want to alter their election
     methods, I figured I'd outline how some of the other echoes handle
     it.

     FN_APATHY               The moderator is expected to keep a low
                             profile here.  Elections are held every five
                             weeks when the echo falls off the backbone
                             for low traffic.  The first person to elist
                             the echo is moderator for the next five
                             weeks.  Some guy named Bob is serving his
                             13th consecutive term.

     MY_FAVORITE_MARTIN      Elections here are held on demand.  Demand
                             is off topic.

     NINJA_LITERARY          The International Order of Teen-Aged Mutant
                             Ninja Literary Commandos meets in enclave
                             annually, selecting qualified members from
                             it's rank to participate in a
                             double-elimination duel with asparagus.  The
                             survivor is elisted.  There can be only one.

     LEMMINGSnnn             The twelve thousand critters in this echo
                             scamper to the top of the backbone,
                             whereupon the moderator orders camp to be
                             made.  One of the troops protests this order
                             and elists a new echo, and then leads a

                             charge off the backbone.  This method of
                             election has been adapted in other echoes and
                             is commonly called "voting with your feet."

     DALLAS                  The moderator in this echo is appointed
                             against his will and administered
                             mind-altering drugs to ward off outside
                             influences.  He spends his days trying to
                             convince any of the other residence of his
                             echo to take the job, but they reject his
                             pleas.  His only hope is for rescue from one
                             of the freedom fighters from other echoes,
                             but he is conditioned to send them away when
                             they succeed in breaching the walls of his
                             echo.
