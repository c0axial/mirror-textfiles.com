======================================================================
                              EDITORIAL
======================================================================

Well, another newsletter. I haven't yet started some of the things I wanted
to, mainly soliciting articles from specific authors and groups. My excuse
this week is that I just started a new job, which I think is a pretty good
excuse.

FUNNY FILES: FidoNews submissions must adhere to ARTSPEC.DOC standards. I
don't have the time to manually rummage around in .LZH, .ZIP or other funny
file formats. (Nor am I adventurous enough to sacrafice my disk drive --
when decompressing one such file, it created three nested subdirectories
and put a file in the bottom one!) Other than FidoNews submissions,
nodediffs, files from friends, etc., I generally delete files that I did
not solicit.

If you intend to submit things for inclusion in FidoNews, please read and
follow ARTSPEC.DOC, to the spirit and letter. I do!

FUNNY MESSAGES: Another thing happened when I became 1:1/1 -- I started
getting misdirected mail. Some are of the "Hey Mary, how about goin'
fishin' this weekend?", which I just delete. "Important looking" ones I
generally bounce back to the author.

Fabian Gordon seems to have figured it out -- software that doesn't
properly handle zonegating/^AINTL lines, and intra-zone mail gets
'zonegated' to 1:1/1. Oh well. I suppose eventually these old non-
functional programs will get replaced by newer versions (hint hint).

                                * * * * *

LAST AND LEAST: I will reiterate every week -- if you don't like what you
see in FidoNews, write it or solicit it from people doing interesting work.
Complaining is boring, and no one likes it except the author. (Meaning,
complaining is selfish and inconsiderate of others -- and they go on and
on, sometimes weeks after the original "offense".)

If you find someone doing interesting work (ingenious uses of FidoNet,
unique software, etc) by all means ask them if they've got something
written up about their project. If you see an article in a magazine that's
short and of interest to FidoNews, by all means write the publisher for
rights to republish -- most like that, as it tends to attract new readers.

Don't forget -- I am the publisher first, and editor second. I don't write
this stuff! You do!

Abstract: 'Computer Underground Digest'

by Tom Jennings

/* NOTE: This is something I'd like to see every week -- abstracts of other
electronic newsletters. While at least mine will occasionally contain
personal likes dislikes (if you knew me that would be funny), these are
meant to be abstracts -- quick descriptive summaries, rather than "reviews"
intent on passing judgment of good vs. bad. You can make up your own mind.

On the list for the future are the Electronic Frontier Foundation's
EFFECTOR, and HOME POWER MAGAZINE's electronic-conference/articles. If you
see any others worth considering, either write up an abstract (see
definition above) or if you're absolutely lazy, send me one. Though that
won't guarantee I'll even read it... -- tomj */



COMPUTER UNDERGROUND DIGEST (CUD) is an electronic-only newsletter, with
it's readership centered on the usenet/internet world, though they're
widening their audience a bit.

CUD comes out weekly, at about 40K bytes of ASCII text. (They are
expirimenting with file-format, to allow it to me automatically processed
by mailers -- I will be following this one!) It's available from at least
one FidoNet node (1:100/345, see below) by filerequest.

CUD has two moderators (ie. editors, more or less), Jim Thomas and Gordon
Meyer. The content is legal/social more than technical, at least lately
dealing with the "hacker" (sic) "busts" (sic) by the FBI and such, as well
as the more legitimate busts of actual computer criminals.

The rest of what follows was clipped from CUD #3.25.

Subject: LOD Members for Comsec COmputer Security (News Reprint)

Reprint from Sunday, June 23, 1991 Houston Chronicle (1A, 15A)
By Joe Abernathy

           FORMER HACKERS OFFER SERVICES IN COMPUTER SECURITY

The most notorious force of computer hacking's heyday is asking
forgiveness and joining the forces of good.

FidoNews 8-30                  Page 5                      29 Jul 1991


The storied Legion of Doom, nemesis to the Secret Service, is forming
a computer security consulting firm in Houston.

Drawing members from around the nation and its name from comic book
villains, the youthful hackers' group dominated the underground
electronic landscape of the middle and late 1980s. Finally, a
controversial penetration of phone company computers landed several
members in jail.  According to documents, activities of the Legion of
Doom were a primary motivation for Operation Sun Devil, a nationwide
crackdown on computer crime coordinated by the U.S. Secret Service.

But remaining members in Austin and Houston, who disavowed any
connection with the phone company incident, now say they are on the
right side of the law and are offering their expertise on computer
security.

"People need us. We're the best," said Scott Chasin, known in his
hacking days by the computer handle Doc Holliday. "Ten years from now
we'll be the leaders in data security."

Computer security is a burgeoning field, but one that is almost
impossible to define in terms of dollars lost to penetrations or
dollars spent on security. Tales are plentiful among police of losses
in the six-figure range that went unprosecuted in order to spare the
affected firms embarrassment.  Estimates of the yearly loss to
industry from computer break-ins range from $500 million to more than
$2 billion -- much of it lost to long-distance phone service theft or
credit card fraud.

Some industry observers welcomed the creation of Comsec Computer
Security, as the new company will be known, while others derided it as
a new twist on a familiar theme.

"There's lots of precedent for that," said Richard A. Schaffer of New
York, editor of the industry publication ComputerLetter. "Crooks of
all types try to hire themselves out after the fact."

"So these guys are purporting to tell you how to protect against folks
like them," he mused. "It strikes me that people should refuse to hire
them just on principle...although from what I've seen they're
qualified."

But Linda Laskey of the Computer Security Institute in San Francisco
said she believes the firm will provide a valuable service.
"They know what they're doing as far as  doing as far as security
systems go," she said.

Laskey said the Computer Security Institute, a worldwide organization
of computer security professionals from business and government will
be among the first clients of Comsec.

FidoNews 8-30                  Page 6                      29 Jul 1991


The value of computer security is pitched now by those associated with
particular security products. Accounting firms also provide security
consulting.

By contrast, Comsec is banking on its past association with the
Legion, which gained a high profile from run-ins with the Secret
Service and BellSouth, one of the regional phone companies.

Robert J. Riggs, Franklin E. Dardin Jr. and Adam E. Grant were
sentenced on Nov. 16, 1990, in federal court in Atlanta for  breaking
into the computers of BellSouth and stealing a document on the
administration of the emergency 911 system.

Hacking grew up around the Legion, which wasn't content merely to
penetrate computer systems and networks. The deed wasn't finished
until the intimate details of each  system were written up and
electronically published.

Legion followers became associated with tutorials on obscure subjects,
such things as how to make nitroglycerin and drugs, and with
electronic documents on "social engineering," the fine art of the
scam.

Born in the swirling computer underground of the 1980s and named after
the minions of Superman archrival Lex Luthor, the Legion's
"educational services" ultimately helped reshape the online community
and gave the group a stature beyond its nominal activities.

But the best summary may have been written by Comsec principal Chris
Goggans, the historian of the Legion and only member associated with
it from its official founding in 1984 until it was disbanded late last
year.

"The Legion of Doom has been called everything from 'Organized Crime'
to 'a communist threat to national security' to 'an international
conspiracy of computer terrorists bent on destroying the nation's 911
service,'" he wrote under his pseudonym, Eric Bloodaxe. "Nothing comes
closer to the actual truth than 'bored adolescents with too much spare
time.'"

Now Sun Devil has put an end to hacking's innocence and perception of
among computer enthusiasts that it is a noble pursuit.

As for the Legion members, a few got busted, a few got bored, and the
rest are pondering a direction for their lives as young adults.

"I didn't want to be 30 years old and still breaking into systems,"
said Chasin, who is 21. "I want to be securing systems."

Chasin and Goggans, 22, will be joined in the firm by Ken Shulman, 21,
the son of Houston socialite Carolyn Farb, who is providing discounted
office space and other assistance.

FidoNews 8-30                  Page 7                      29 Jul 1991


Comsec will be managed by Robert Cupps, 24, a graduate of Emory
University and former securities trader.  Chasin and Goggans are
pursuing degrees at the University of Houston.

"From a marketing standpoint, we've got a real strong presentation,"
said Cupps, a Baytown native who does not consider himself a computer
expert. "What we will do is a brief demonstration. When you can walk
into someone's office and get root (administrative privileges) on
their system, that says something in itself, that maybe you're the
person they should be talking to about securing their systems."

The only member of Comsec who has faced criminal charges is Shulman,
known vicariously on computer networks as Malefactor, The Mentor, and
Jack the Ripper. He pleaded no contest in 1989 to misdemeanor charges
of credit card fraud, paid nearly $20,000 in restitution and was put
on a year's deferred adjudication -- meaning he emerged from probation
without a final conviction on his record.

"It was telephones, long distance calls," he said. "I quit everything
after that, and that was years ago."

Goggans has also had a run-in with the law, however. His Austin home
was raided on March 1, 1990, because he allegedly possessed the 911
document.  No charges have been filed.

Originally held forth as a life-threatening penetration of the 911
system, the document theft is now viewed by computer enthusiasts and
others as having been considerably overblown.

"The fact of the matter is that there was no damage to the system,"
acknowledged Scott Ticer, operations manager for BellSouth and
spokesman for the security team that lead the investigation. "But the
potential for damage was there."

"You just can't have people playing around in your network -- it's not
some high-tech toyland. This is the telecommunications system."

Would BellSouth hire the former hackers whose associates caused it so
much grief -- proving their expertise along the way?

"We don't use hackers as consultants, period," Ticer said. "Thanks but
no thanks."

                THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION

                       General Information

************************************************************


                 EFF MISSION STATEMENT -- April, 1990

A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic
media which
connect us.  Computer-based communication media like electronic mail and
computer conferencing are becoming the basis of new forms of community.
These communities without a single, fixed geographical location comprise
the first settlements on an electronic frontier.

While well-established legal principles and cultural norms give
structure
and coherence to uses of conventional media like newspapers, books, and
telephones, the new digital media do not so easily fit into existing
frameworks.  Conflicts come about as the law struggles to define its
application in a context where fundamental notions of speech, property, and
place take profoundly new forms. People sense both the promise and the
threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies, even as
they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the workplace and the
home.

        The Electronic Frontier Foundation has been established to
civilize the
electronic frontier; to make it  useful and beneficial not just to a
technical elite, but to everyone; and to do this in keeping with our
society's highest traditions of the free and open flow of information and
communication.


                 A LOOK BACK -- June, 1991

        That was our mission statement when we began the EFF little more
than a
year ago. In the past year we have worked hard to fulfil this mission.

        When we began there was a void separating the pioneers of computer
networking and the rest of the world.  The technologies were ill understood
outside of a small, technically minded part of the population.  One of our
first tasks was to begin to build bridges between these groups.

        In our first year The Electronic Frontier Foundation has:

        Inspired and helped to organize and present the first Computer
Freedom and
Privacy Conference.  CFP was a four day event that brought together, in
search of  knowledge and common ground, representatives from computer
networking, law  enforcement, and privacy advocate groups.

FidoNews 8-30                  Page 9                      29 Jul 1991


        Worked within Senator Leahy's Privacy Task Force in
Washington,D.C. in
order to advance the concerns of the computer networking community in the
formation of  legislation in this critical area.

        Established a fully staffed, operational headquarters in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

        Distributed  the first six issues of our electronic newsletter,
EFFector
Online, throughout the net.

        Published the first  issue of our quarterly print  newsletter,
EFFECTOR.

        Filed suit against the Secret Service for the unlawful search and
seizure
of computers, BBS systems, books and manuscripts at Steve Jackson Games in
Austin, Texas.

        Defended  Craig Neidorf, unjustly accused of publishing purloined
documents.

        Become a presence on the Internet with our node, eff.org.

        Created  an FTP archive on the net for documents on computer
networking
and privacy law.

        Spoken to numerous groups nationwide on the issues of civil
liberties and
computer networking.

        Made grants in aid to Computer Professionals for Social
Responsibility as
well as joining them in numerous projects and workshops around the nation.

        Testified before the Federal Communications Committee concerning
the
public access and design needs of the National Research and Education
network.

        Lobbied effectively at the state level to change legislation
inimical to
computer networking.

        Developed a network of relationships with the local and national
media
that has affected the climate of  opinion about computer networking and
begun to reverse the slide into "hacker hysteria" that was beginning to
grip the nation.

FidoNews 8-30                  Page 10                     29 Jul 1991


        Given a net home at eff.org to groups like Computer Professionals
for
Social Responsibility and the new Computers and Academic Freedom group.

        Created a voice that is listened to in Washington on  issues
concerning computer networking.

        Joined in an association with the ACLU and the Consumer
Federation of
America in order to plan and to act in the future to ensure broad public
access to the information super-highways of the future.

        Launched the Open Road program  in order to make sure that the
needs of
the public in the building of the National Public Network are addressed at
the beginning of the project.

        Begun  research and  development into creating the tools that will
allow
non-technical individuals using PCs to access the net over voice-grade
telephone lines in a simple and straightforward fashion.

        Defined the problems associated with the questions of protecting
nodes and
carriers from unwarranted risks and liabilities in providing  information
services from the  producer to the consumer.

        We are proud that we have been able to accomplish so much in such
a short
time.  We have had a lot of help doing it from friends and supporters from
all sectors of American society in the public and the private sectors.  In
this we have been fortunate.
        At the same time, we see more clearly that we did a year ago just
how far
we have to go and how much work lies ahead of us.  The issues that those of
us in the computer, telecommunications, and computer networking fields of
endeavor can see so clearly now will affect every American and most of the
people of the entire world within the next ten years.  The opportunities
are immense and the potential for an increase in human knowledge, wisdom
and well-being beyond our calculation.
        We now know that we cannot know all of what lies ahead.  Instead,
we can
try to prepare as best we can, and to protect the legitimate interests of
the individual and society as best we can, for the full dawn of the Global
Information Age.
        We hope that we can count on you for your continuing good will and
support.

INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM, INC.
                          TODAY
-----------------------------------------------------

SaudiNet was formed in the midst of a crisis developing in the
Middle East, this crisis is now known as the War in the Persian
Gulf.  The intent of this project was to provide a quick,
efficient way to get letters, in the form of electronic mail, to
troops stationed in the Persian Gulf.  These letters, from
family members and well wishers, are entered on a personal
computer equipped with a modem while "online" with a computer
Bulletin Board System (BBS).  There were some systems around the
country that operated on a "stand alone" basis.  Schools and
libraries etc.  participated in SaudiNet.  These computer
Bulletin Board Systems operate voluntarily.  The System
Operators (SysOps) who maintain these systems give a large
amount of their time and money for toll calls, maintenence etc.
to provide this service, free of charge, to the public.  These
individual systems and the people who run them are the very
backbone of the entire operation.  Without them, this great
effort known as SaudiNet, would not be able to run.  As with all
projects of this scope, SaudiNet has had its growing pains.  As
problems arose however, they have been dealt with in a manner
befitting commercial organizations.

There are still nearly 45,000 troops stationed in and around the
Persian Gulf Theatre of Operations, and mail continues to flow
from systems who belong to SaudiNet, to a Bulletin Board System
(BBS) in Saudi Arabia, where they are printed out, stapled and
turned over to the Military Post Office.  Here in this country,
plans are underway to expand the present operation to include
crises areas around the world.  SaudiNet remains an ongoing
project, as long as need be, under the direction of a
not-for-profit corporation called the International Public
Emergency Communications System Incorporated (IPECS Inc.).

This corporation is already unique.  The members of SaudiNet are
at this time electing representatives from their respective
regions to an Advisory Board of Directors.  The chairman of
which holds a seat on the regular board of directors of IPECS
Inc..  This insures that the entire membership will have a voice
in the future directions of the network.  To our knowledge, this
is the first time that this has been done in any, large scale
computer communications network.

The time is ripe for an organization such as this.  With the
proliferation of technology available to nearly everyone, a
computer network such as this can serve a great need.  We can
provide nearly instantaneous communications to crises areas
around the world.  Another important facet of the IPECS Network
is being able to provide moral support to crisis victims, as
well as making previous experiences and the knowledge gleaned
from these past experiences available to others.  We sincerely
hope that this "global knowledge" will help people from all over
the world deal with whatever situation they may find themselves
in, and promote understanding between diverse peoples of the
FidoNews 8-30                  Page 15                     29 Jul 1991


world.

In 1981, the percentage of schools in this country that had
personal computers available to students was 18.2%.  This number
has risen dramatically and in 1987 was up to 96.4%.  At the same
time, the number of students per PC has fallen from 56.2 in 1984
to 28.8 in 1987.  (1)

There has been an incredible increase of sales of PC's as well.
In 1981, 1.11 million PC's were sold.  These numbers increased
through 1984 to 7.61 million units.  After a slight drop in 1985
and 1986, 8.34 million units were sold in 1987.  (2)

Additionally, the use of modems in personal computers has
increased.  In 1981, 180,000 modems were in use in PC's in the
United States.  Through 1987, this number has increased to
nearly 9 million.

Clearly, there is a trend in this country.  People utilizing the
personal computer as a communications device.  Also, it is clear
that our children are getting "hands on" experience in the ways
of the computer world.  A computer network such as the
International Public Emergency Communications System Inc., is
timely.  "User friendliness", and IPECS' dedication to providing
crisis communications in an emergency situation, as well as "day
to day" communications that will keep the network "primed" and
ready for any situation, will be a benefit to people around the
world.

SaudiNet will continue as long as troops are stationed in the
Persian Gulf.  As long as there is a need for mail to the
troops, and it's much needed, the SaudiNet project will
continue.  Some may wonder where the Board of Directors of this
new corporation, the International Public Emergency
Communications System (IPECS Inc.) is going in the future.

By "corporation", we speak of the entire network.  The
individual node is the single, most important element of IPECS
Inc.  and SaudiNet.  Without the dedication of the individual
member, SaudiNet would have been an utter failure, and IPECS
Inc.  would have no future.

Now that we have the basic system in place, IPECS Inc.  will
continue to provide similar services during future crises,
wherever they may strike in the world.  We have proven, with
astounding success, that that we can function in accordance with
our charter in the worst of all possible scenarios, that being
wartime communications.  General H.  Norman Schwarzkopf
expressed interest in SaudiNet in a letter, February 27, 1991.

   INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM,
                        TOMMORROW
   -----------------------------------------------------

Our mission is not like other organizations whose basic
structure is the same.  We are not here to provide emergency
communications links between rescue and relief teams and their
offices in the United States.  Our mission is to provide an
invaluable communications link between the families, friends,
loved ones, and general supporters in this country and the
people who live and work in those foreign countries beset by
tragedy.  Be it war, as in the Gulf, or natural catastrophe such
as earthquake, fire, flood, or whatever may come along, IPECS
Inc.  will be there to provide timely, computer communications.

Our Board of Directors consists of selected members of our
current SaudiNet network.  We intend to include prestigious
members from corporate America, the Senate, and Congress as
well.  We have earned much in the way of credibility in the past
months or so, and we will continue to do so until it is
traditionally accepted of us.  We will be a respected and
credible organization whose services will be sought after by
humanitarian organizations and government agencies throughout
the world.  We have, in fact, already been approached.

We are expanding the existing IPECS network to include support
to the American and Canadian civilians who are rebuilding
Kuwait, and all the existing SaudiNet nodes who want to join us
will make up IPECS' general membership.  We will continue to
provide the valuable service we have been to date, honing our
skills, waiting and ready for the next crisis.  Our membership
will eventually total in the thousands.  From within the ranks
of our growing membership, we will recruit, and train, Crisis
Action Teams who will, on very short notice, pack up our
equipment and travel to the scene of a catastrophe to begin
establishing our essential links to that country.  We are
approaching various foundations and corporations for the funding
necessary to accomplish this humanitarian effort.

We will have our own computer and communications equipment,
including our own satellite communications link to transmit
IPECS members letters of support, concern and sharing of ideas
anywhere in the world.  We will have our own facilities to store
and repair this equipment.  We will have offices staffed with
full time employees from where we will conduct business just as
any successful charitable organization.

Our headquarters will have several data and voice 800 lines, as
will each of our regional coordinators in the field.  Our
operation will be entirely computerized, operating virtually
paperless in order to streamline efficiency, and the HQ will
house the IPECS BBS System which will be online 24 hours per
day, accessible through an 800 number, to provide membership and
outreach services to the general public in accordance with our
charter.

FidoNews 8-30                  Page 17                     29 Jul 1991


Between crises, our CAT members will "drill and train" in
preparation of the next call for our services.  Our
communications commitee will look at what was learned from
previous projects, and those mistakes that will inevitably be
made, planning for the next emergency utilizing this
information.  Our membership committee will actively seek out
new volunteer BBS sysops.  Our technical committee will work
with our existing member nodes, as well as new members as they
come online, to insure they have all the tools they need to
provide effective, efficient services to the general public
during the next emergency.  Our funding committee will actively
solicit contributions from a wide variety of foundations and
corporations.

Our Public Relations Director will continue to work with the
general public, as well as corporations, making our services
known to them through various publications and media events.
Our executive staff will continue to strengthen our contacts in
the world with applicable agencies and organizations so that we
may call on their expertise during future crises no matter when
or where they occur.

IS PROFANITY REALLY NECESSARY?
by Richard Bash - 161/357; Castro Valley, California


A recent article in FIDO829 was very thorough, even to the point of
including expletives making reference to sexual intercourse. This letter
to the editor is a condemnation of the acceptance of that and similar
articles containing obvious profanity.

Gentle reader, the nut cases that permeate this network have a right to
have their point of view and the editorial policy of this publication
seems to accept all articles (including mine). But good taste dictates
that there is absolutely no need for this Lenny Bruce mentality. Yes,
that's censorship. But there are all kinds of SysOps OF ALL AGES who read
this stuff. So, if you are a submitter of articles to FidoNews, please
clean up your act. Additionally, learn to use a word processor and a
spelling checker. Buy a copy of The Chicago Manual of Style if you do not
have a clue as to how to construct a sentence or if the word "grammar"
has little meaning to you.

In any event, it is time for Tom Jennings and crew to add a couple of
lines of code to their program that processes these articles and trash
articles that contain socially unacceptable language. I, like anyone
else, can cuss like a sailor. Good taste prescribes that it not appear in
this otherwise meaningful journal. Being an editor requires a modicum of
editing. Let's see that talent put to use, for pity's sake. Otherwise
this good publication will deteriorate even more. The inclusion of such
profanity reflects upon the entirety of this worldwide net and its
editor(s). Let's grow up a bit, OK? Your use of common courtesy will be
appreciated. Thank you.

In FidoNews 821, the case for publishing EVERYTHING
submitted to FidoNews regardless of content or
applicability was dealt another blow. Publishing
anything has resulted in a torrent of similar stuff in
every issue since this article was first written [the day
after 821 came out].

This was not the first non-FidoNet related
article to be published but it was sufficient to get
me to the word processor.

Though some are offended by religious proselytizing of that
sort, I found it more pitiful than offensive and certainly
a waste of space and transport time in FidoNews. It is also
an invitation to jihad from every other nutbar superstition
that decides to use FidoNews for GoodNews or BadNews. [sigh]

And it's not only religious fundamentalism but the other
articles on socialism and gender identity and rambling
trash on the state of the world that bears no resemblance
to anything of FidoNet or computers in general.

Historically, FidoNews has published anything sent to it.
This happened even when there was no identification on the
material and when it was out of spec for publication. Is
this a good idea anymore? I don't think so.

It would be reasonable to restrict content in FidoNews to
things actually related to FidoNet and telecommunications.
It would be reasonable to permit announcements of non-
FidoNet related Echo conferences since Echomail is an
integral part of FidoNet. It would be reasonable to permit
announcements of software and discussion of same since this
is a computer-based Network. It would be reasonable to
permit the inevitable political give and take concomitant
with Policy debate and complaint. It would be reasonable to
permit personal response to personal attack [though both
should be nipped in the bud by the Editor prior to
publication] so long as it did not become an endless free-
for-all.
FidoNews 8-30                  Page 20                     29 Jul 1991


Point is: do we want to be reasonable?

I suggest the FidoNews specifications be modified to
allow material related to FidoNet and to discourage the
submission of personal problems or pronouncements that have
nothing whatsoever to do with FidoNet operations or the
computer world in general.

The new [old] Editor has decided to continue the policy of
publishing anything sent that is within specs [ARTSPEC.DOC]
and not illegal.

While that may be a noble ambition, I don't think that view
particularly realistic [of course, they laughed at Fulton,
too.] nor conducive to encouraging reading of the FidoNet
newsletter.

In the current edition [829], the Editor warns of the evils
of Television and opines that restricting input to FidoNews
based on actual content will result in 'bland'. On the
contrary, I think it might result in more readership. A
socially driven newsletter rather than a topically driven
newsletter is not the path to follow in this Sysop's opinion.

The time is ripe for bringing FidoNews back to FidoNet.
What better time than the changing of the Editorial guard? I
suggest we start a Netmail writing campaign to Tom J. at
1:1/1 [1:125/111] protesting the publishing of 'extraneous'
and non-FidoNet/computer material. FidoNet and computer ops
is wide enough a venue for FidoNews. Maybe we can start a
FIDONEWS Echo for discussing Editorial policy? [grin]

Think about it. Thanks.

TTFN.

It is, at present, a non-backbone Echo Hosted and Moderated by
Tomas Hood [1:352/777].  It is now on the Ragion 17 backbone,
1/217.

The Echo is open to anyone who desires to discuss the topic of
the Fine Arts.

A sample of the first few messages and the statement of purpose
of the Echo is available as FNART (majyk name for FNART.ARJ)
from this system anytime, if you wish to get an idea of whether
to commit disk space to the Echo.  The ARJ archive utility is
also available as "ARJ."

I hope you will join us or ask your Sysop to request a link
via Netmail to 1:352/777.

Cheers!
Tomas Hood
