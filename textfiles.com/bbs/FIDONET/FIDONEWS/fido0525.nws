          I  have  written two Outside programs for the OPUS <tm>
     and Fido 11w <tm> Bulletin Board Systems.  They may be piped
     (redirected) using the excellent program GATEWAY,  or  using
     DOS redirection through CTTY Com1 or CTTY Com2.

          These  two programs are called TRANSITS and NATAL. They
     are for  the  astrology  student.  (And,  it  seems,  Ronald
     Reagan.)

          When invoked, TRANSITS will calculate the longitude and
     latitude  for  the  Sun,  Moon, planets, five asteroids, and
     eight uranian placements, with heliocentric  and  geocentric
     values, for  the  exact moment TRANSITS is run.  It gets the
     required information  from  the  computer's  date  and  time
     stamp,  and  a  sysop-edited file called TRANSITS.CTL. These
     values will be given in decimal and sign notation.

          TRANSITS.CTL  just  holds  the  geographic   longitude,
     latitude, and time zone for the computer running TRANSITS.

          A  sample  batch  file  is  included with TRANSITS. The
     device driver that does  the  redirection  (piping)  is  NOT
     included,  as  it  is  not  my  program, but is available at
     Astro-Net (Called GATEWAY).    The  carrier  detect  program
     WATCHCD  is  also a good idea, and is available at Astro-Net
     as well.  Please, if you use  the  programs  GATEWAY  and/or
     WATCHCD, pay the shareware price for them.

          TRANSITS  may  be  downloaded  from  Astro-Net  free of
     charge.  It may not be sold for  any  price  or  remittance.
     This  means  "distributing  companies" may not copy and sell
     any of my programs.  TRANSITS may only be installed on a BBS
     that does not charge users for any remittance for using said
     BBS.

          File request: TRANSITS.ARC.

          The program NATAL will do the  same  as  TRANSITS,  but
     requires the  user to supply all information.  The user must
     enter day of event, month, year, time, longitude,  latitude,
     and zone.    NATAL  will  also calculate the Placidian house
     cusps, unlike TRANSITS. NATAL does  not  require  any  other
     file to run, and therefore requires no maintenance.

          Fire Request: NATAL.ARC

                         = "For Birders Only" Echo =
                         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

     I am pleased to announce the availability of a new echo-mail
     conference group for bird watchers named "For Birders Only"!

     This echo will be supported by the Charleston Natural History
     Society (local Audubon chapter) and also expects to get regular
     input from the Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology and
     "Wild Bird" magazine, as well as rare bird sighting information
     from various sources available through the nationwide rare bird
     hotline, Carolina Bird Club and the South Carolina Wildlife and
     Marine Resources department in Columbia to get us started.  I
     hope that interest will be sufficient in the near future for us
     to bring the headquarters of the National Audubon Society online
     as they have expressed interest to me in hopes of creating a new
     bulletin board to carry similar information!

     This conference group has been active for quite a while, and all
     previous information posted will be available if you want to get
     "up-to-date".  Note that I expect at least two other sources to
     be available shortly - one through Tom Hendricks (13/33) on his
     "Avi-Tech" board which specialized in pet birds (and has another
     echo named 'AVICULTURE' available to pet bird lovers).

     Interested SysOps should contact me via netmail at 372/888 and I
     will arrange for a feed either from my board, or from someone in
     a closer location if possible.

     The "For Birders Only" conference group is mentioned in the next
     (not out as of this writing - August) issue of "Wild Bird"
     magazine on pages 6 and 7 in the 'Bulletin Bird' section.  I will
     post a listing of other boards participating in an upcoming issue
     of "Wild Bird" as well.

     I know there is a lot of interest out there, so let's get started
     and provide a useful vehicle for information to the bird-lovers
     around the country!

     Conference host and SIG-Op will be the real expert in the family:
     Donna Ratledge.

     FidoCon'88 is quickly approaching and it's still not too late to

     Delta Airlines free ticket giveaway and the USR discounts are
     going FAST!

     You must register before July 15 to be eligible to win a free
     round-trip ticket from Delta Airlines to anywhere they fly in the
     continental US!

     There are still some coupons left for the US Robotics special
     discount offer.  If you are one of the first 50 to register for
     this year's conference, you will receive a discount from US
     Robotics of $50 off the price of an HST 9600 baud modem.  You may
     use this discount along with the SYSOP deal ($495) to bring the
     cost of an HST down to $445.00!  - - > BUT you must be one of the
     first 50 to register!

     Remember after July 31 the cost for the conference jumps to $75!
     and you must register at the door.  So register now and get in on

     What could  SEA  do  to  top  it's  phenominally  successful  ARC
     program?


     Well,  have  you noticed that new programs from SEA don't seem to
     ARC very well lately?

     System Enhancement Associates,  Inc.  is proud  to  announce  the
     latest  and  greatest  addition  to our line of quality software.
     Our new product is called AXE, and it can chop your programs down
     to size!

     If you thought ARC was good,  wait until  you  see  AXE!  It  can
     compress  almost  any  .EXE  or  .COM  file  by  twenty to thirty
     percent,  saving you megabytes of disk  space.  And,  here's  the
     best part, the programs don't have to be uncompressed to run!

     That's right,  you can AXE all your programs and make them twenty
     to thirty percent smaller (or MORE), and they still run just like
     they always did.  You'll never even notice  you  AXEd  them,  but
     you'll sure notice the extra disk space!

     AXE is available for $50 from:

     It has come to my attention that there are great deals to be had
     by booking your FidoCon'88 airfare early.  By making reservations
     now you can save $$$$ and with many of today's SuperSaver fares
     you can still cancel as late as 3 days ahead of time if there is
     a problem.

     Couple these already low fares with the special discounts Delta
     has made available to us and you can potentially save BIG $$$$!

                  Contact 1/88 or 108/62 for more details!

                             COMMITTEE REPORTS
     =================================================================

     By-Laws and Rules Committee
     1:102/2871

     The By-laws and Rules Committee has prepared the rules which
     appear below for this year's By-laws amendment process.  They
     have been approved by the IFNA Board of Directors.


                 1988 Rules for Amendment of By-laws


     1. By-Law Amendments will only be accepted from IFNA members.

     2. The By-Laws Committee is responsible for any suggested
        changes to the By-Laws.  To this end, all suggestions must be
        submitted to the By-Laws Committee for inclusion on the
        Ballot.  The Committee reserves the right to edit, combine, or
        expand the submissions provided that any changes made do not
        substantially change the original intent of the suggestion.
        In the event of conflicting suggestions, the changes may be
        presented on the Ballot in the form of a "multiple choice"
        where only one of the suggestions may be selected.

     3. All proposed amendments will be of the form "old wording"/
        "new wording" including By-Law reference numbers where
        applicable.  This is intended to clarify the changes proposed.

     4. All changes must be received by the Secretary at least 60
        days prior to the scheduled vote date in order to be included
        on the Ballot.  They will then be forwarded to the By-Laws
        committee for preparation for inclusion on the Ballot.

     5. Ballots will be accepted from members in good standing
        through regular postal service addressed to the Secretary and
        must be received no later than the Annual Meeting.
        Alternately, Ballots will be accepted from members in good
        standing provided they are hand delivered to the Secretary or
        his designate at the Annual Meeting, no later than the
        announced time for the closing of the polls.

     6. A certified public accountant will receive and collate all
        mail Ballots received prior to the Annual Meeting, and will be
        responsible for the receipt, tabulation and verification of
        all Ballots cast before the close of voting.  The certified
        public accountant will present and certify the results of the
        balloting.

     7. In the event of a tie, the current (outgoing) President shall
        cast the deciding vote.
