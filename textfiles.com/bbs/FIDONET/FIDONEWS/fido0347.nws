     Did  you  know  that  we  are  not alone?  FidoNet isn't the only
     amateur mail network  in  the  world  anymore.  There's  a  group
     called  RamNet  that's  using  a whole different approach to this
     sort of thing.  But we  needn't  go  far  afield  to  find  other
     amateur mail networks.

     There's CollieNet,  of course.  That's the net the  Collie  crowd
     has  set  up.  Last  I'd  heard,  they  were trying to make their
     software compatible with FidoNet so that they could exchange mail
     on FidoNet.  Great!  The more the merrier.  Tom Jennings  himself
     has  stated  publicly several times over the last couple of years
     that he wants other vendors to get  out  there.  That's  a  large
     part  of  why he helped the FidoNet Technical Standards Committee
     so much.  Wynn Wagner grabbed the technical specs  and  ran  with
     them,  and  now  has his Opus program in gamma test and very near
     general release.  TBBS and RBBS are also  joining  our  ranks  as
     fully FidoNet compatible systems.

     But  all of that,  as good as it is to hear,  is still beside the
     point.   Opus,  TBBS,  and  RBBS  are  becoming  compatible  with
     FidoNet, and many sysops are eagerly awaiting the new software so
     that  they  can  participate in FidoNet itself.  But there's also
     another group forming a FidoNet compatible network competing with
     FidoNet.  They call it "TechNet",  which may be a better term  in
     general  than  "FidoNet"  is.  After  all,  we  aren't just Fidos
     anymore.

     This,  too,  is a healthy development.  Nothing grows  well  that
     grows   in  a  vacuum.   Healthy  competition  is  good  for  all
     concerned.  And there is always the chance that if FidoNet  takes
     a  wrong  turn  somewhere,  TechNet will turn out to have done it
     right.

     For the real concerns here are ones of organization and  control.
     FidoNet has grown quite large,  and quite a bureaucracy has grown
     up to control it.  Maybe we've done it wrong.  How can  we  know?
     We'll  know for sure later,  if it all falls apart.  But that's a
     bit too late.  It's good to  know  that  there's  an  alternative
     waiting in the wings.

                      ----------------------------------

     The flow of information about IFNA to Australia has been poor.
     We have been unable to plug into the IFNA conference despite
     offers to pickup the conference from US boards and have had to
     live what information we could gleam from occasional captures
     of the conference from whenever I could log onto Ken Kaplan's
     Fido.

     The arrival of Fido News 344 which was totally devoted to IFNA
     matters was awaited with great interest.  We had become a little
     alarmed at what we had seen in our snippets from the IFNA
     conference and the contents of Fido News 344 only served to
     increase that alarm.  It seemed quite clear to a number of
     sysops in Net 155 that the "I" in IFNA was a misnomer and the
     only way to effectively represent the interests of Australian
     Fido sysops and users would be to form an Australian FidoNet
     Association.

     From a purely local point of view we needed to associate to
     be able to successfully lobby various arms of the Australian
     Government who have recently taken an interest in Bulletin Board
     systems.  There is also a need to liaise with our local PTT,
     Telecom Australia, on various technical aspect of Fido net
     operation.  So the AFNA will serve both a domestic purpose and
     an international purpose for Australian Fido sysops and users

     Fido is now spreading quickly Australia, from a small start in
     Melbourne during 1985, with 19 active public systems on Nodelist
     325 (plus one in Papua New Guinea).  There are approximately 20
     new Fido systems due to join the network in Australia in the
     next few months.  The geographical spread is also increasing
     with a new network in Western Australia about to come on line.
     Papua New Guinea is also adding new systems and should soon have
     its own net and FidoNet Association.

     It is AFNAs aim to work closely and co-operatively with other
     FidoNet Associations to encourage the formation of an
     International FidoNet Association made up of independent
     national associations. AFNA will also maintain and enhance
     FidoNet network standards in this part of the world.

     A motion to form the Australian Fido-Net Association was passed
     unanimously at the Network 155 sysop's meeting on November 23,
     1986.  A motion to adopt the following interim constitution was
     passed unanimously at the same meeting.

     The following sysops were elected unopposed to form the First

     NOTE: These proposed bylaws are NOT a joke!  They are presented
     in all seriousness as an alternative to the previously proposed
     IFNA bylaws.


                              PROPOSED BYLAWS
                                  for the
                       INTERGALACTIC FIDONET ALLIANCE


     This document contains the proposed bylaws of an organization to
     be  known as the Intergalactic FidoNet Alliance, herein referred
     to as IFNA.

      1. IFNA shall exist solely to serve the Knights of IFNA, and
         such others as the Knights shall desire served.

      2. The following orders of Knights are established:

         A. The Order of the Golden Dawn.  To be eligible, an
            applicant must be the system operator in good standing of
            a PUBLIC ACCESS node, and must have paid any tithes
            required.  A Knight of the Order of the Golden Dawn is
            entitled to one vote.

         B. The Order of Mercantile Grammarie.  Any entity which
            profits by the existence or operation of the Intergalactic
            FidoNet Alliance shall be eligible to join the Order of
            Mercantile Grammarie by paying the required tithes.  If
            said entity would otherwise be eligible for the Order of
            the Golden Dawn, then it shall be entitled to one vote.

         C. The Order of the Rose and Cross.  The Peers of the Realm
            may award membership in the Order of the Rose and Cross to
            any being which they feel worthy.  Knights of the Order of
            the Rose and Cross are exempt from paying tithes, but are
            not permitted to vote.

         D. The Order of the Garter.  Any being wishing to be a
            Knight, but not qualifying for any other order, may join
            the ranks of the Order of the Garter by submitting an
            appropriate contribution to the Keeper of the Exchequer.
            A Knight of the Order of the Garter is not entitled to
            vote.

      3. Applications for knighthood shall be submitted to the Mundane
         Interface.  In the case of any applicant whose character,
         reputation or conduct are such that knighting them may be
         questionable, the Mundane Interface shall refer the
         application to the Peers of the Realm.  In all other cases,
         the Mundane Interface shall have the power to knight the
         applicant.

      4. Tithes shall be set by the Peers of the Realm, and be payable
         in advance. For members outside the United States territorial
         zone of the planet Earth, the Peers of the Realm shall assess
     Fidonews                     Page 7                    8 Dec 1986


         such additional costs as may be required.

      5. The Mundane Interface shall notify all Knights of any tithes
         required to keep their peerage not less than thirty days
         prior to the date the tithes are required.  Any Knight who
         submits his tithe within thirty days of the deadline shall
         not be regarded as having lapsed.

      6. No entity shall be a Peer of the Realm or hold any other
         position within the Intergalactic FidoNet Alliance unless
         they qualify under all applicable statutes.

      7. The Peers of the Realm shall be five in number, and shall be
         elected annually by the Knights.  Each Knight may cast one
         vote, consisting of five choices for Peers of the Realm.

      8. The Peers of the Realm shall be elected by ballot cast at a
         time selected by the previous Peers of the Realm, save that
         they may not wait longer than eighteen months between
         ballots.

      9. The Mundane Interface shall notify the Knights of an
         impending ballot not less than three months before the ballot
         is scheduled to take place.  The Mundane Interface shall also
         take nominations for Peers of the Realm up to one month
         before the ballot.  Any Knight may be nominated for Peer of
         the Realm by submitting a petition endorsed by ten other
         Knights.

     10. The Mundane Interface shall close nominations and post the
         list of candidates one month before the scheduled ballot.  If
         less than six Knights are nominated for Peer of the Realm,
         then the Mundane Interface shall consider them elected
         without a formal ballot.

     11. The Mundane Interface shall arrange for the counting of all
         votes received, and shall post the result.  Votes received by
         the Mundane Interface after the close of balloting shall not
         be counted.

     12. At the first meeting of the Peers of the Realm each year they
         shall elect one of their number to be the Royal Figurehead,
         who will preside over all meetings of the Peers of the Realm.
         They shall also appoint the following officers:

                Automatically Compiling the Fido Nodelist

     I've got my Fido trained to do many things without my intervention
     (he even fetches the paper).  But I had a problem getting Fido to
     compile the Nodelist then exit back to my batch file after receiving
     the Nodediff file each week.

     After trying many complex methods (even patching Fido) that all
     failed to work the way I wished, I discovered that the solution is
     incredibly simple.  I just created a text file (CONTROLC.TXT)
     containing a control-C (^C), then I executed Fido with the following
     command:
                            FIDO_IBM <CONTROLC.TXT

     Fido compiles the Nodelist, then exits to DOS.

     You can create CONTROLC.TXT using the following Basic program:

          10 OPEN "O",1,"CONTROLC.TXT"
          20 PRINT #1, STRING$(10,3)
          30 CLOSE
          40 END

     This program creates a text file containing 10 control-C's in the
     current directory.

     Make sure CONTROLC.TXT is in the current directory when you execute
     Fido_IBM and Fido will compile the Nodelist if necessary then will
     exit back to DOS or a batch file.

     Fido 109/74 "The Bear's Den"

                         Doug's Column

         WHY I LIKE ATARI:  Sig Hartmann called me up on Sunday and
     wanted to know how Computerfest went. Since I'm an u-grad,
     and have no spending power at all, why should Sig care about
     a small user group like mine? He's of the opinion that U. of
     MD is important and he would like my advice. Plus any contacts
     I can give him in high-tech land.

         The 520ST is the first under-$500 machine which has enough
     ports & firepower to be worth the hassle to buy. The 1040 gives
     you a meg of RAM for under $1,000 (street price with mono
     monitor right now is $800). And the ST family is being backed
     by some good public domain software; Atari has put a decent
     word processor into the public domain.

         WHY I AM MAD AT ATARI:  Built-in VT-52 emulation in the ST
     family. Like putting a Volkswagon Beetle in a Ferrari parking
     lot. VT-100 would be the min, and VT-220 desirable. Someone
     wasn't thinking very clearl.

         Neil Harris may be more arrogant than the Apple sales
     reps at U. of MD. We wanted to get a
     single speaker at Computerfest. Uno. After making at least
     3 phone calls on separate occasions, he FINALLY calls me back
     with the big brush-off.

         "You need to have at least 25-30 Atari-related vendors
     there, 12,000 square feet of exhibit space, 3,000-5,000
     guaranteed attendence and then we'll send a squad of 7
     people with lots of hardware to demo, and products to blab
     about". Uh huh. "We can't support small events all the time,
     because if we did we'd lose money and never get anything done."

         I've gotta have a f#$#ing Comdex/Maryland before Atari
     will send ANYONE out. But wait, there's more....

         "Now, I'll have our user group representative, Cathy
     Austin, call you up and she'll make arrangements to send
     out lots of trinkets". She never did. Even after I called back.
     Thanks Neil.

         APPLE ISN'T MUCH BETTER: PCA has been at Uni. of MD for
     nearly 3 years. We've have Mac & Apple // SIGs for over a year.
     So just what motivates the local Apple sales reps to try and
     create their own user groups at College Park? Despite the fact
     they know we exist (they demo'ed products at a meeting!), they
     decided we weren't good enough and started making noise about
     starting their own user group. Now they're just ignoring us.

         GOOD PD SOFTWARE:  AS-EASY-AS is a shareware clone which
     looks/acts like the Lotus 1A spreadsheet (ONLY the spreadsheet,
     however; you don't get DATA functions). The distribution copy
     Fidonews                     Page 13                   8 Dec 1986


     I have has lots of advanced features (printing graphics, @ATAN2
     function, Macros, use of Scroll key) which don't work as per
     1-2-3, but I suspect if I send in $30 and register my product,
     all those "bugs" will disappear.

         Cavat: I haven't done a lot of heavy work with it yet, and
     will share my experience as it grows. However, I am
     *very* excited because this seems like the first truly useful
     PD/shareware spreadsheet program; it dances rings around
     PC-Calc. Interested? Write to: TRIUS, Inc., 15 Atkinson Str.,
     Lynn, Mass. 01905.

         NICE SOFTWARE:  Was at a "junk fair" at the old Sheridon
     a week ago, when a company from Harrisburg, PA caught my eye
     (I wuz born in Harrisburg, mind you). Genesis Data Systems
     was showing off this screen design program called "Screen
     Master", creating objects, moving objects around, animating
     them, and capturing screens from other programs. "Big woopie",
     I muttered to myself, "I can do dat with the Mac or with
     Dan Bricklin's Demo Program".

         But then the salesman/demoer said "And you can call these
     routines from a Quick BASIC compiler or Turbo Pascal
     program". THAT got my attention. You can call up screens, save
     them, move them or parts of 'em without writing lines and lines
     of code. Nifty. Call 'em at (717) 652-1200 for literature.

         A REASONABLE LAPTOP?: Datavue Corp. to ship a $995 PC
     compatible lap-top in January. Nine pounds, 1 3 1/2" floppy,
     384K RAM, and a "highly readable" (according to PC Week)
     super-twist LCD. To expand to 640K of RAM, insert $99 memory
     card. Standard serial, parallel, 8 hour battery pack, and
     external video. Runs at either 4.77 or 9.54Hz clock.

         I confess. I hope Datavue sends me one in the mail to
     review. You can also get it without an LCD screen for $750.
     Maybe if I get enough cash, I'll buy one; it does sound
     a LOT more desirable the IBM PC Convertable.

         DISCLAIMER: I make no official blessing or endorsement of
     the aforementioned products, nor am I an employee, stockholder,
     friend, or second cousin to the president of
     any of the mentioned companies. Simply giving my opinions
     and gut instincts.

         IBM vs AT&T: Round 1 winner: IBM. Better marketing and
     friendly salespeople. Plus the advantage of being a trend-
     setter. Comparative Advantage: AT&T. They make some great
     hardware; the TARGA video boards, for one thing.

         PROMISES, PROMISES: Both Apple and IBM are going to
     release hot hardware over the next 12 months, Apple with
     the Open Mac, Mac-Workstation and interactive video and
     IBM to show a "clone killer", faster/cheaper AT machine, and
     a '386 machine which will have hi-res (1024 x 980) graphics,
     hellfire speed, and plug-in connectivity to mainframes.

     I better make sure my subscription to BYTE is paid up.

         DOPY IDEA IF I HAVEN'T SAID IT ALREADY: '386 accelerator
     boards. $2,000 for a board which may or may not increase
     your calculation speed. And is stuck with an I/O bottleneck
     by going through the AT 16-bit slots. Save your money and
     get a '386 AT clone instead.

         OK, YOUR TURN: If you want to reach me, send me
     FidoMail to Doug Mohney at 109/74. Or call me at
     (301) 350-1437. Good gossip or demo copies of anything
     welcome. Money not refused (although if I get real
     successful, I may have to give a cut to my SYSOP at
     109/74).

          I  would  like  to  request  that  anyone  sending messages to me
     requesting  that  I  send them particular files via fidomail, read the
     following.

          To the requestors:

          I  would  very much like to be able to personally respond to each
     and  every  one of the file requests that I receive daily, however due
     in  part  to my sever lack of free funds to give to MA BELL, I must in
     all  fairness  request that you arrange to either POLL my system (upon
     receipt  of  a  confirming  file from myself to you) for any files you
     may  want.  You  may  also  call  anytime  of the day or night (except
     during  netmail  time) and simply download whatever you may find. I do
     not  at  the  present  time  have  SEAdog (although if someone were to
     donate  it  to me for the system I would graciously ACCEPT !) and thus
     am not able to respond to file requests via SEAdog.

          Also  in  order  for  me  to  be able to properly respond to your
     requests  I  would  appreciate it if you would address any REQUESTS to
     the  "DISTRIBUTOR".  This will cause my system to scan the message and
     construct  a  return message to you telling you how to POLL me for the
     files  you requested. If you are sending a file to me for distribution
     or  inclusion  in  the distribution area please address the message to
     the  "FILE  HANDLER".  This  will  in turn trigger the process whereby
     your  submission  will  be  added  to  the  list  automatically by the
     system.  By  your  co-operation I hope to be able to make the response
     time  drop  from  2 or 3 days to SAME DAY response !!!!!  Yes you will
     receive  a  response  the  same  day you send the message! Amazing but
     true.  Thus  if you are requesting a file the actual time from sending
     the request to being able to poll for the file will be 24 hours.

          At  the  present  time  I have over 140 files in the distribution
     area  covering  all facets of Fido operations.  These files have taken
     a  great  deal  of  time and money to amass and sort into some sort of
     order.  I  would  like to thank everyone who has sent me files for the
     distribution  area.  I  would also like to thank all of those who have
     called  requesting  files.  I would appreciate it if you would help me
     to  keep  the  cost of running this system for you somewhere below the
     NATIONAL  DEBT.  I  think  that  by  following  this simple outline of
     operation, everyone should be a lot happier.

          Please  remember  to  send all file requests to the "DISTRIBUTOR"
     and  all  files you send to me please address to the "FILE HANDLER". I
     also  have a file in area #1 of the "station" called ALLFILES.*(ARC or
     TXT).  This  is a complete list of every file on my system showing d/l
     Fidonews                     Page 16                   8 Dec 1986


     times  and descriptions. This file in ARC format alone is over 34k and
     un-arced  is  over  64k  should  you decide to d/l it, it will greatly
     help you to decide which files you should get.

          If  you  request  that  I  send you the files on disk then please
     send  me  AT  LEAST a box of disks to copy the files onto (in FASTBACK
     format  alone  it  takes 10 disks) along with a self-addressed STAMPED
     carton  to  mail  them  back in (BE SURE TO HAVE ENOUGH POSTAGE ON THE
     CARTON).  I  will  copy  the  distribution area in it entirety over to
     your  disks  and  send  them  RIGHT BACK. At present I am able to copy
     files over in the following formats ONLY:

          a)  FASTBACK 360k DSDD
          b)  DOS BACKUP utility again 360k DSDD
          c)  PLAIN FILES in ARC format (requires at least 15 disks at
              present.

          There is NO CHARGE for copying the files. Send disks and etc to:

               Part 4: Review of GEOS (By Berkeley Softworks)

        Welcome back to "The Nautical View", boys  and  girls!   Well!
     I've been getting quite the favorable response, at least here  in
     Calgary, to my articles in this FINE PUBLICATION (it never  hurts
     to get in good with the publishers).  Despite a complete lack  of
     writing  style  induced  by   ingesting   large   quantities   of
     uncontrolled substances (namely 7-11 Super Big Gulps), I  managed
     to  attract  some  attention.   Unfortunately,  I  still  haven't
     attracted ANY response to my request for questions,  suggestions,
     etc.  Does this mean you folks all know everything and  therefore
     this column isn't needed?  Nah.... hell, I don't profess to  know
     everything, but I take care to surround myself  with  those  that
     do.  Anyways, on to the topic at hand: GEOS!

        What is GEOS?  Surely you've heard of GEOS by  now!   GEOS  is
     the  "Graphic  Environment  Operating  System",  currently  being
     bundled with the new 64C computer (redesigned keyboard, same  old
     64).  GEOS gives your worn out 64 new life by giving it something
     machines like the MAC, Amiga, and Atari ST  have  had  all  their
     lives: a graphics-oriented OS.  The OS is booted from  disk,  but
     "switches out" the resident OS and  uses  the  memory  space  for
     itself.  It's all here folks: pop up  windows,  on-screen  mouse,
     etc.  It is of course different in many  ways  to  the  operating
     systems of the MAC and Amiga, but the similarities are striking.

        To boot a program under GEOS, simply move the on-screen  arrow
     onto the "icon" of the file in question.  Press the button twice,
     and up she boots!  Talk about easy!  Other  operations,  such  as
     copying files (or whole  disks),  selecting  printers  and  input
     devices (currently only joystick is  supported:  a  mouse  driver
     will be supplied later),  setting  the  time,  or  setting  other
     system preferences are similarly easy.  In fact, the hardest part
     about running GEOS is typing the LOAD"*",8,1 to boot  the  system
     up.  Not too shabby...

        What we have so far  is  an  8-bit  computer  with  1MHz  chip
     running a  sophisticated  graphics-oriented  system.   Wow.   But
     wait: that's not all.  Did I mention that all (ALL,  ALL,  repeat
     ALL) disk operations are  intensely  speeded  up?   No,  guess  I
     didn't.  Your 1541 need no longer be  the  "lumbering  hippo"  it
     once was, and now you don't even need an Epyx Fastload  Cartridge
     to do it!  Incidentally, the  FastLoad  cartridge  IS  compatible
     with GEOS.  Anyways, you also have the following:

       - Preference Manager
       - Built-in System Clock (uses TOD clock)
       - Photo Manager
     Fidonews                     Page 18                   8 Dec 1986


       - Text Manager
       - Many other DOS thingies

       - And -

       - geoWrite
       - geoPaint

        Yes,  Virginia,  this  system  even  has  it's  own  software.
     geoWrite is a "WYSIWYG" word processor, meaning "what you see  is
     what you get".  Text is formatted on-screen, in  your  choice  of
     fonts and fontstyles.  Graphic "scraps" from geoPaint can also be
     inserted into your text for the professional touch.

        geoPaint is yet another graphics program for the 64, but  with
     a MAJOR difference: it allows you to compose your  picture  on  a
     pixel-by-pixel basis using an  entire  sheet  of  paper  as  your
     canvas.  Consequently, you can only see a small chunk of it at  a
     time, but this is  seldom  a  problem,  especially  if  you  make
     liberal use of the "preview" option, which gives you a rough idea
     of what the printed page will look like.

        So far I've been quite liberal in my praise for GEOS.  It IS a
     nice program, and a boon to 64 users everywhere.   However,  like
     most things, there are some drawbacks, some quite serious.

        First, and most serious, is a complete lack of GEOS-compatible
     software.  Berkeley Softworks has added one feature  that  helps:
     GEOS will boot any program that loads into  the  BASIC  workspace
     (and starts with  the  RUN  command),  be  it  BASIC  or  machine
     language.  However, this reduces GEOS to  a  quite  sophisticated
     boot program, and that is NOT  what  it  was  meant  to  be.   If
     Berkeley or any other third parties start  making  programs  that
     run under  the  GEOS  environment,  then  GEOS  will  be  a  good
     investment.  At $80 Canadian, that's a hefty price for a graphics
     program and a word processor...

        Secondly, while geoWrite and geoPaint are QUITE user friendly,
     they have drawbacks.  geoWrite can be quite slow and  cumbersome.
     You cannot see the whole page width at  one  time,  and  when  it
     redraws  the  screen  (once  you  hit  the  edge),  it  can  lose
     keystrokes while you type blindly on.  This problem becomes quite
     severe when using the  "OUTLINE"  fontstyle  and/or  any  of  the
     larger fonts.  It is not a word processor for the  serious  user:
     there are no features for moving text, spell-checking, or any  of
     the myriad other features that word processor users have come  to
     expect in a good package.  If you want to re-arrange a paragraph,
     you delete it and re-type it.  Fun, huh?  As for  geoPaint,  it's
     nice, but it REFUSES to support the multi-color  hi-res  mode  on
     the 64.  True, the resolution is not as great, but YOU try mixing
     lots of colors in hi-res mode!  It  just  doesn't  work  out  too
     well, and your geoPaint picture starts looking like gibbled bits.
     Additionally, it isn't "intuitive" enough (God, I HATE that word,
     but it fits): while most GEOS functions can be figured out easily
     and painlessly without leafing through  a  500-page  manual  (no,
     that is NOT the real size of it), some of the geoPaint  functions
     Fidonews                     Page 19                   8 Dec 1986


     must be studied via the manual before you'll  have  any  hope  of
     making use of them.

        GEOS was a long time coming.  It isn't  perfect,  but  it's  a
     step in the right direction.  From most accounts, Berkeley  seems
     to be listening to  the  'geoUsers'  in  making  changes  to  the
     program where necessary, and this is to be commended.  However, a
     lot of improvement needs to be made.  The designers  at  Berkeley
     have a goal, which is almost realized.  If they hope  to  realize
     it to its fullest, then a lot of work must still be done.

        I'm interested in answering any of your questions about either
     the C-64 or C-128.  If you are having a problem,  please  address
     your mail to Joe Lindstrom via TC-Link  Fido  (Calgary,  Net  134
     Node 7), and I'll address it in an upcoming article.

                        The World of Computing

                         by Reuven M. Lerner
                           FidoMail 107/233

        Hello, and welcome to yet another edition of The World of
     Computing!   There have been many new product  announcements
     since  the last time this  column appeared, as well as  some
     new  books  and other items  of interest which I'd  like  to
     share with you.  Of course, there won't be time for me to do
     it all this week, but I hope that with luck, I'll be able to
     do  this  column on  a  semi-regular basis, and give  you  a
     different perspective on the computer industry.   So without
     further ado, let's go to the news.

        One  of  the  biggest  announcements in a long  time  was
     Ashton-Tate's  decision to  remove copy-protection from  its
     products,   including   Framework   II   and   dBase   III.
     Unfortunately,  the trade-off is a steep price for  service,
     paid on a yearly basis.  However, there are some user groups
     and corporations working on this issue.  At this point, that
     leaves  Lotus (makers of 1-2-3, Symphony, and several  other
     best-sellers)  as the only company selling its products with
     copy-protection.

        Speaking  of  Lotus,  by  the time you read  this,  there
     should  be  yet  another  word  processor  on  the  market.
     Manuscript,  a  technical  word processor, was previewed  in
     this  month's BYTE magazine, and promises to be yet  another
     best-selling product from the people at Lotus.  Due out soon
     from  the giant is  HAL, a natural-language interface  which
     should  increase 1-2-3's popularity amongst  non-programmers
     and business users.

        InfoWorld reported something recently (about two or three
     weeks  ago as I write this, probably four to six as you read
     it) about how CompuServe wrote a letter to a Sysop demanding
     that  he not offer programs for downloading which he himself
     downloaded  off of CompuServe.  As any of you know, the  way
     that  Bulletin  Boards work  is that people  are  constantly
     uploading files to one that they downloaded off of another.
     What  happens  when someone  tries to break that  chain,  as
     CompuServe did?
        They  found  out.   The  Sysop is absolutely  correct  to
     protest  the  complaint, and  that's not only from  a  legal
     standpoint,  but  from a moral  one at that.  If I  write  a
     program and put it into the public domain (or even copyright
     it  as  "Shareware",  and  distribute  it  through  bulletin
     boards),  no  one has the  right to say that it's  wrong  to
     download it.  (If you agree with me, read an article by Mark
     Whelch on Shareware in FidoNews several weeks ago -- he says
     it much more eloquently, and goes into detail about it.)
        As  far as I know, there is only one (count 'em, one) BBS
     that  restricts the use of their programs for  downloading.
     The  PC-IRS  Board, run  by PC Magazine, has warnings  (just
     like  in the magazine itself) that tell you not to upload it
     Fidonews                     Page 21                   8 Dec 1986


     to a BBS as you would another program.  Although I disagree,
     I  respect  their position,  and was horrified to see  their
     programs (in the identical file name, size, date, etc.) on a
     local BBS.
        To  make a long "news bulletin" short (as if this  really
     will),  we must respect the authors of programs in how  they
     want their programs distributed.  However, companies such as
     CompuServe  have  no  right  to  say how you can  use  other
     people's work.


     Memory-Resident Programs
     ------------------------

        Although  I  am  by  far no expert on  assembly  language
     (although  I  just  bought  several books on it  today,  and
     should be experimenting in a few weeks), I do know about the
     famed  "TSR"  call in MS-DOS.   For those of you  who  don't
     know,  this  allows programs  to terminate, but  not  become
     erased  from the computers memory.  That is to say,  they're
     available at the touch of a key (and thus "un-terminate", at
     least for a while).
        TSR's (Terminate and Stay Resident; a new way to describe
     memory-resident  programs) have only been out in full  force
     for  two or three years.  For a while, it was only companies
     such as Borland who knew how to implement this machine call,
     now there are literally hundreds of these programs either in
     the public domain or on the market.
        The  newest things  are "super-TSR's."  These TSR's  help
     manage  smaller TSR's, so you can drop them from memory, and
     regain  precious  kilobytes that  you may have  lost.   Such
     programs  are  supposed  to  fill a need for  programs  that
     already fill a need.
        Where will it stop?
        Ah, that's the question that no one really wants to face.
     You  see,  TSR's  are  only  a  frail  substitute  for  that
     wonderful  thing  called  "multitasking" that we don't  want
     Microsoft  to  implement for  fear that our IBM's  won't  be
     compatible  with themselves.  The so-called "protected mode"
     on the 80286 and 80386 are wonderful things unto themselves,
     but won't do anything until we accept the fact that we can't
     remain an IBM-compatible community forever.
        Once  we become truly multitasking (and the  technology's
     not  hard to implement; we've seen that already -- it's just
     that it would make our existing programs so obsolete that we
     would  have  to buy new  ones, and no one wants that),  like
     some  other operating systems,  we won't have this need  for
     TSR's.   Instead of typing  Control-Alt to get our  SideKick
     notepad, we'll just type Alt-1 for our super-duper 100-digit
     calculator  (with memory, of course), and Alt-2 for the most
     incredible address book you'd ever want, and...well, you get
     the picture.
        In  fact, given the right operating system and  software,
     the  change from one partition to the other would be  faster
     than  switching over to a TSR is nowadays -- without loss of
     your screen or anything else.
     Fidonews                     Page 22                   8 Dec 1986


        However,I  do have to admit it: I'm just as guilty of  it
     as  anyone  else.  Between  two PC Magazine utilties that  I
     couldn't  live  without (Pop-cal,  and PR-Swap), as well  as
     Re-View,  a 100-line virtual screen for long directories and
     such,  and two or three  other toys, I'm hooked on TSR's  as
     much as the next guy.
        I guess I do understand the problem that everyone else is
     facing.


     Working Together
     ----------------

        I've  understood for a while now the problems involved in
     getting more than one microprocessor to work in a computer.
     However,  I didn't quite get the picture until about a month
     ago, when I went to lunch at a restaurant near my school.
        Usually,  there are two  people in the entire store:  One
     stands  behind the counter, getting the orders, and one does
     the  actual cooking and  "packaging" of the hamburgers.   As
     luck  would have it, the day I went in, there were no  fewer
     than six people working in the entire place.
        Under  most circumstances, that  would be no problem;  it
     would help the efficiency by at least three times the norm.
     These people, though, obviously had never put their minds to
     thinking  about  statistics, and  it took me three times  as
     long as I usually wait to get my meal.
        All  I'm trying to say is that it may not be easy to  get
     more  than one processor to work inside of a computer.  Just
     make  sure  when you finally  put it together that you  know
     it's  going to be faster than, say, the original that you're
     trying to improve.

     Note to those misled folks who have been trying to reach me via
     Fido 138/45, in regard to my Bible project article...I am now a
     part of NET 340 (CanWest), as NODE 20. My apologies to those of
     you who had to phone me (especially Dana Montgomery, in Mass.).

     For those of you who wish to download WORD.ARC: Please let me
     know through 340/20 in advance; just send me a message contain-
     ing your log-on name, password, and WORD.ARC. Upon receipt, I
     will clear access and add a call to your record to avoid the 1st
     caller limit (20 minutes.) The file requires about 35 minutes,
     at 1200 baud. It would be less expensive if you would send me a
     disk, in a disk mailer, and $1.00 for return postage. I will
     copy the file onto the disk and return it the same day via 1st.
     Class Mail. If you would rather call my board, be advised that
     it is best to do so immediately after an event - particularly at
     23:02 hours or 07:01 hours, PST.
