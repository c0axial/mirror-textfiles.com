Editorial: Huh?!

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Another not so quiet week here at the FidoNews ranch. Privacy,
encryption, BBS law, carrier vs. publiser status for BBSs and
in-transit mail...

I'm on two private Internet mailing lists, BBSLAW and CYPHERPUNKS. As
well as a participant in the PUBLIC_KEYS echo. I can tell you, things
are heating up, and we might actually get some definition or at least
a seat-of-the-pants feel for where we stand regarding just how liable
a sysop is for the traffic on their system.

POLICY4 again leads the pack in naivete and silliness, outright
banning "encryption" because it prevents sysops from censoring mail.
Which practice is questionable anyways under US law.

But anyways. I won't dwell on the subject until there's something
solid to report. I will give you this to consider: there is very good
reason to believe a sysop has only limited liability for messages in
their system. And this liability may vary, depending on the type of
message. For echomail, you've probably got fairly limited liability;
you don't have control over them, and the traffic is too great to
monitor. For in-transit mail, such as net hosts, it's probably near
zero; this is carrier activity, and carriers are generally not liable
for their content.

None of this is "fact", it is my sense of what's going on. Most of
the law in our area simply isn't defined. We are breaking new ground,
and it's not always for the fainthearted.

I would suggest also to net hosts, to consider if they really want to
do the job, if they will not allow, nay, encourage, the free flow of
traffic through their systems.

                   Why We Don't Need New Laws

by:  Jack D. Feka                                       1:153/615
     Chilliwack, B.C., Canada


    Janis Kracht's article in FidoNews 940 raises some interesting and
vital issues not only concerning BBS's but about laws in general and
our attitudes towards them.

    Ms. Kracht states that we should have better laws available to
protect her and others from potential abusers of BBS's.

    We must realize, in the first place, that laws do not "protect"
anybody from anything.  What the laws do is establish the penalties
that may be applied to people who are judged guilty of breaking them,
and also procedures which must be followed in order to have a person
judged and penalties applied.

    The only way any law is going to protect anyone is by judging
someone else guilty even before they have acted and incapacitating
them.  Even now, Ms. Kracht is not immune from future assualts from
the Johnson brothers, especially if they decide that they don't care
about the consequences.

    Ms. Kracht might argue that if the penalties were stronger the
deterrant would be more effective, and in many cases it would be
provided that the potential abuser knew in advance about the
penalties.  In our increasingly complex world we have to be more and
more prepared to accept that people are not going to be aware of all
the laws which might affect them.  Recently reported statistics stated
that in the US, governments on all levels are enacting literally
thousands of new laws EVERY DAY!

    Another aspect of having more and stronger laws is the enforcement
of those laws.  No law is effective if nobody is available or willing
to enforce it.  This implies that enforcement agencies must have the
trained staff and the resources available to respond to complaints,
investigate them and to undertake all the other steps which are
necessary.  To do this requires money and that, under our present
system, would probably come from taxes.

    What Ms. Kracht seeks, in essence, is that somebody else pay for
her privilege of operating a "very open" BBS.

    While I agree that it is laudable that she is willing to operate
such an open system as she describes, I also believe she is being
unrealistic if she returns to such a policy  without taking any steps
to protect herself unless she is prepared to accept the risk of a
future assalt.

FidoNews 9-42                  Page 3                      19 Oct 1992


    I think Ms. Kracht's article was a great first step in the process
of developing self-defense against potential abusers of a BBS:  it
made us aware of a potential problem for all who want to enter that
activity.  Now, rather than seek to change our laws, lets see what can
be done using education, cooperation, technology and other resources
within our reach to arm ourselves against such assaults.

    Especially with all the demands already erroding the public purse,
I do not agree that we need new laws and enforcement capabilities for
BBS's and other new technologies.  Before we seek protection and
remedies through the law we ought to do everything within our own
power to protect ourselves.  In doing so I believe we will not only
strengthen ourselves but enhance our society and quality of life as
well.

Region 18's Most Interesting Approach To Elections

     Region 18 is having a Regional Coordinator election.  Sounds
like a fairly simple proposition.  And rain makes applesauce.

     When the current RC announced the election there was quite a
feeling of shock to a lot of the sysops.  There had been no talk
before by the current RC about, "Hmmmmmm.  Think I will hold an
election next week, OK?"  In fact, some people in the region felt
that the election time for the RC position was long overdue.  I
myself was pleasantly surprised.  My job as Net Coordinator is
elected, so why shouldn't then RC's be?  Even more shocking to the
people banging around in the HOST18 (Regional NC & NEC) echo was that
Ben (the current NC) was not going to run for the position.  In all
fairness, I can't say I envy him the job.  There are always some
people that you will make mad.  It doesn't matter what you do, some
are simply happier when they are making noise.

     The announcement in the HOST18 echo stated Mr. Mann's intent to
hold an election, and laid down some basic guidelines for the rules.
He also appointed another gentleman to be in charge of running the
election.  Due to some difficulties in timing, all the firm dates for
the election had to be shifted back.  Mostly this was a result of the
slow propagation time of the HOST18 echo.  Mr. Mann's rules included
the following:

 1)  The region's NCs would be voting for their choice of candidate.
 2)  The only people eligible for the position would be current NCs.

     Very soon, the information concerning the election had made it
into Region 18's general sysop echo.  It caused a storm of messages.
The topics of these messages ranged from simple "good-bye & thanks"
type messages to some quite rude comments about the eligibility
requirements.  The messages that were upset about the requirements
soon began to take on the aspects of an epic battle.  Two sides
formed, and the bickering became quite intense.  On one hand was the
side saying that someone with experience was needed to handle the RC
FidoNews 9-42                  Page 4                      19 Oct 1992


spot because of the importance in handling the nodelist segments,
etc.  The other side rallied under a cry of an elitist conspiracy to
keep "grunt sysops" from reaching the position.  They also argued
that experience in another net should count as experience in FidoNet.
As of this writing, the battle has cooled somewhat, but there is
still the occasional sniping taking place.

     Meanwhile, in the HOST18 echo, an amendment was made to the
original rules to allow both past and current *Cs to run for the
position.  Since Region 18 has no formal policy, and no election
guidelines, this was simply a request from Mr. Mann to allow this
change.

     Soon thereafter, people in HOST18 began to nominate candidates
for the RC position.  At first there was a slight question as to
whether a nomination must be seconded or not, but it was accepted as
requiring a second.

     The candidates for the election were given access to the HOST18
echo so as to let them post their platforms.  Some people were
opposed to the idea of allowing the candidates access.  Others felt
that some had begun to get their echo feeds before it had been
decided to let them in.  There was a small back and forth message
session between some of the HOST18 participants concerning these
ideas.  It was certainly more interesting that the weekly nodelist
segment acknowledgements, however intense it became.

     There is more coming.  I don't know exactly what else, but as
always, it's bound to be worth the price of admission.  ** grin **

                 All Good Things Must Come to an End.

        When George Peace appointed me to the ZEC position I had
hoped to finally accomplish some objectives that had been left
undone at the end of my first term back in 1989.  Fidonet is in
desperate need of a general Echomail Policy whether a stand alone
policy or an inclusion into a rewritten Policy4.  The Echomail
Coordinator positions need to be properly defined as well.  The
'backbone' in Zone 1 needs to become independant of the *ECs and
have a well defined distribution agreement similar to the other
independant echomail distribution systems such as Groupmail,
K12_Net, etc.

FidoNews 9-42                  Page 5                      19 Oct 1992


        Over the last several months it has become obvious that I
am spitting in the wind.  Many moderators, Sysops and Users seem
to believe that they are in possession of some God given rights
to do as they please everyone else be damned.  Added to that are
some problems within my family that require my time and
attention, plus my course load, a non-profit agency that needs my
attention and I'm 15 days away from buying an equity position in
a couple of insurance agencies that will eat 40 - 60 hours a
week.  Frankly life is hectic enough without the abuse that goes
with a Fidonet position.

        With a heavy heart I am resigning as Zone Echomail
Coordinator for Fidonet Zone 1 effective Monday October 19, 1992.
I appologize to Zone 1 for not being able to accomplish some of
my goals and can only hope that someone in the near future will
be able to put things on the right track.

        I leave you with some thoughts.  Fidonet had grown
tremendously since I called the first meeting of the backbone in
Chicago in September of 1986.  Unfortunately it hasn't grown up
or matured, it's just gotten bigger.  Anarchy may be fine for an
organization of 1,200 nodes but it's out of the question for an
organization of 12,000 let alone an organization of our current
size.

        An organization the size of Fidonet cannot afford the
luxury of individuals in administrative positions that do nothing
but occupy a node number.  An organization the size of Fidonet in
North America cannot continue to watch the echomail explosion
without 'offical' guidelines that cover it's growth, operation,
ettiqute and set some non-technical standards.

        Thom Henderson said in the fall of 1986 that Fidonet
would collapse under the weight of echomail.  I said in
addressing the attendees of Fidocon '88 that echomail was the
cocaine of Fidonet.  I believe both statements are true today.
Echomail, undirected or unregulated, will be the downfall of
Fidonet.  Not due to the volume or the expense, but at some point
in time in the not too distant future without Fidonet guidelines
echomail will cause a court action.  Due to the adicting nature
of echomail and it's tendency to make folks do or say things that
they wouldn't do in a face to face manner, fewer and fewer will
be willing to serve and those that do serve will do nothing to
further the cause of Fidonet in order to avoid the slings and
arrows of the adicted masses.

        Over the years I have been thrilled by the growth of both
Fidonet and Echomail.  I hope I have played a small role in that
growth since I joined Fidonet in the fall of '85.  I am disturbed
by the lack of history that has been passed on however.  Fidonet
has lost it's roots and without roots growth will eventually stop
when the tree topples.  Few know of the pains we went through in
the first year to get echomail off the ground nationally or
internationally.  That's sad, for without a knowledge of the past
you can't appreciate the present nor plan for the future.

FidoNews 9-42                  Page 6                      19 Oct 1992


        I've rambled enough.  I leave disappointed, but I hope
Fidonet is a little better place leaving than when I came.

                   Misconceptions Of Responsibility

                       By Brian Keahl 1:133/524

     Americans have had so many years of freedom and economic growth
that we have forgotten what creates it, how it is maintained, and how
easily it can be destroyed.

     I believe our country is in terrible danger in both economic
growth and personal freedoms. The problem has less to do with
Republicans and Democrats and more to do with the fact the citizens of
the United States of America do not understand how our government
works.  Please, if you read this no further, locate and read the
constitution of our great country. It is not very long and it is not
very hard to understand.

     The constitution is divided into four parts.  These parts are the
preamble, articles, signatures, and amendments.  The articles of the
constitution dictate how government works.  Since we have election
campaigns in progress I think it is important to understand what the
president and congress are empowered to do.  You may find that
candidates are claiming they will do things that they can not do and
that others are taking credit and being given blame for things they
can not control.

     Article I (A fancy way to say chapter one) describes congress.
An interesting portion of article I (Section 7) is that it gives
congress the right to pass any piece of legislation it wants simply by
two-thirds of them agreeing that it is the right thing to do.  A two-
thirds vote by the house of representatives and the senate overrides a
presidential veto.  In other words, the president lacks the power to
stop congress from implementing laws (and taxes) if congress can get
two-thirds of the members to agree.

     Congress is also given the right (and responsibility), in section
8, to borrow money and regulate commerce and trade with foreign
countries.  By virtue of this congress  controls the flow of economic
aid and business development capital inside our own country and to
foreign countries.

     Article II of the constitution gives the president control over
the army and navy, the ability to grant pardons and reprieves, and to
make treaties as long as two-thirds of the senate agree.  The
president does not have the right to control domestic spending or
taxes at all.  The only recourse the president has is to veto, which
can be over-ridden by the congress by a two-thirds agreement.

FidoNews 9-42                  Page 7                      19 Oct 1992


     Given the limited power of the president it is surprising to me
that he is burdened with the blame for unfair taxes, government debt,
and the domestic troubles our country is perceived to face.  Congress
determines where the money goes and where it comes from, the president
can only choose to veto or sign.

     It angers me that a congress and senate controlled by democrats
can not create bills which are clearly good enough for our country and
get a two-thirds vote to override a presidential veto.  If this can
not be accomplished then I must assume we have an inept congress, the
bills are not really in the general interest of our country, or the
combination of both.  Congress took great pride in the one override
that it managed: A cable television bill.  With high taxes, government
debt, crime, and unemployment our elected congressmen marshall their
incredible power and responsibility to ensure we have some new
"rights", of questionable value, in watching television.  If the bills
that the president vetoed were as important as many congressional
members claim, why didn't they override it like they did with the
cable bill?

     Lets give credit where due and blame where it belongs.  Evaluate
congress and the president based upon the powers and responsibilities
given when you go to the polls.  Read and understand the constitution
and its definition of powers and then evaluate our leaders and the
promises of our candidates.  The president has the power and
responsibility to deal with foreign affairs, treaties and ability to
veto legislation.  Congress has the power and responsibility of
creating a balanced budget, collecting revenue (taxes), and passing
laws.

     Consider the implications of a president that agrees with the
choices congress is making.  Consider whether we really want a
congress that has operated in the manner we have seen.  Consider
placing your vote based upon the power and responsibility of the
office and the ability of the candidate to fulfill those needs. It's
time for a change all right, but not where many seem to think it is
needed.

I would like to invite you all to pick up the CBM-128 echo.

CBM-128 is a support echo where C=128 users can share information
about the C=128 computer, its software, its peripherals, programming
it, news and reviews, etc..

The CBM-128 echo is important to C=128 users, because it is one of the
few avenues of support for the C=128 that is growing at a time when
industry support is declining.

The FIDOSTAT.NA released 10-Oct-92 shows that CBM-128 has been accepted
for FidoNet Zone 1 Backbone distribution.  So you can now get CBM-128
through your regular echo feed.

Cohousing Echo
by Wilma Keppel, 1:283/657
Community Living Project, P.O. Box 2262, Iowa City, IA  52244-2262

Cohousing is a type of cooperative housing which originated in Denmark
about 20 years ago and is becoming more and more popular in Europe and
the United States.  Since the concept reached the States in 1988,
several communities have been built here, more are under
construction,and more than 90 cohousing development groups have
formed.

The COHOUSING echo was started by my development group, the Community
Living Project, as a way to network with other cohousers, hold
electronic meetings, and provide a way for interested people to find
out about cohousing and link up with groups or individuals in their
area.  Groups which are spread out geographically are invited to hold
meetings on the echo; localized groups can hold meetings there until
it becomes a problem for others.

The echo is currently available from 1:283/657 and 1:285/666, and should
appear in the November Echolist.  Please netmail for more information.

EPubNet - The Electronic Publishing Network
by Kief Morris   1:3603/210

Nowadays we have enormous power and flexibility at our fingertips when
we write documents using a computer. However, most publishers abandon
this power by distributing their publications on paper. Electronic
publishing lets readers tap the power of the computer to read text, by
offering the ability to scan, leap around within the document at whim,
etc. This publication is an example of EPub in its simplest form - for
more sophisticated examples we need only turn to the hypertext help
systems which come with most high-end programs and GUI's today.

The Electronic Publishing Network has been started to support EPub in
two major ways - by providing echoes for people to communicate ideas and
information, and by building an electronic distribution system for
publications and related files. EPubNet uses regular Fido numbers, so
there's no need for new aka's and the associated hassle - essentially,
we're simply establishing our own, alternative distribution system for
our echoes and files.

Who is EPubNet for? Anybody who is at all interested in the concept of
EPub! There are echoes where people new to the idea of EPub can ask
questions, where you can get help on using hypertext and other authoring
software, and where you can discuss ideas for better ways to write,
format, publish and distribute publications.

Here are the main (non-administrative) echoes we are distributing:

        EP-AUTHOR       For authors interested in writing for
                        electronic publication.
        EP-BOOKSTORE    Running a BBS as a location for people
FidoNews 9-42                  Page 11                     19 Oct 1992


                        to download publications.
        EP-GENERAL      General EPub Chat/Discussion echo.
        EP-PUBLISH      For publishers and self-publishers to discuss
                        the business of electronic publishing.
        EP-TOOLS        General support echo for electronic authoring
                        software, such as hypertext programs. The
                        authors of several such programs are already
                        participating in the net, with more expected!

What's in it for you? If you're a writer interested in EPub, the net
will give you BBS's where you can discuss ideas with others, and make
contacts with publishers. We also distribute electronic authoring
tools, such as shareware hypertext programs.

If you are a publisher or self-published author, not only does EPubNet
let you communicate with others in this fledgling trade, it also
provides a way to distribute your publications to a number of systems
with a single upload. We intend to explore other avenues of
distributing member publications, so you can get wide distribution with
little effort and no cost (other than the initial upload).

Sysops - you can help users interested in EPub connect with others via
the echoes, plus you can build a sizeable collection of publication
files.

General users will be able to find "Electronic Bookstores," BBS's they
can call to find a variety of the latest publications.

EPubNet is new, but we're committed to building a viable support
organization for all kinds of people interested in EPub. We've got a lot
of plans to support this effort, and we not only want members, we also
want people with ideas to help the net grow and succeed in its goals.

Interested? More details are provided in a file called: EPUBINFO.ZIP,
available from:

        Kief Morris   1:3603/210  (v42)
        N.L. Hargrove 1:301/301   (v42b)
                      1:301/1     (HST)

Feel free to netmail either sysop with questions, or post a message in
the OTHERNETS echo.

New NATURIST echo

As life becomes more and more stressful, an increasing number of people
are finding family-oriented nude recreation to be the perfect tonic. And
whether joining in with an organized club or resort, or going out to a
secluded spot for some sunning and skinny dipping, the social climate
has never been more favorable to enjoying nude recreation.

There is now an echo for naturism/nudism discussion. In the NATURIST
echo, discussions may range from recent outings and information
concerning establishment or closure of public areas designated for nude
recreation to personal reasons for being involved in nudism.

Are you looking for a club or a public clothing optional place in your
area? Are you someone who finds yourself usually nude when you're home,
and you would like to find out more about social nudism? Or are you just
curious about what kind of person would *want* to run around stark
nekkid :) ? If you answered 'Yes' to any of the above, NATURIST is the
place to be.

The two primary feed points for NATURIST are 1:105/222 (v32b) and
1:3401/1 (HST/v32b).

This is not an adult echo. Nudism isn't about orgies or swinging. Entire
families enjoy nudism -- we would like to keep the echo family-oriented
as well.
