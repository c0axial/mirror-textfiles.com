     Another disaffected and long-time Sysop is calling it quits in this
     Issue; citing burnout. [sigh]

     It's unfortunate that this hobby is taken so seriously by some that it
     affects their enjoyment. There are pinheads in Echomail but then
     that's what Echomail is for, isn't it? You've got to ignore them.
     Taking it to heart is the road to disappointment and burnout.

     On a happier note, Region 13 has elected a new Region Coordinator with
     no bloodshed and no uproar. David Moufarrege has taken over the daily
     Coordination ops on the eastern seaboard. He has already set up a new
     webpage for Region 13 at:

        http://www.smalltalkband.com/st01000.htm

     and this now appears in the Zone 1 list at the end of the Issue and on
     the FidoNews webpage. I was hoping to have a report of the election
     from the R13 Election Coord but if it's enroute it won't make it this
     week.

     Still no sign of the uucpGate at 1:13/10 or its replacement. I need a
     new gateway to use for outbound email here. I've tried the local one
     used by my former Net but it doesn't like my uucp format for some
     reason and bounces my traffic. I don't need one to be local. If I can
     use your uucpGate, please let me know via Netmail or email. The
     addresses are in the Masthead at the end of every Issue.

     There is a new date in the Future History section this week. I hope it
     doesn't last but fear it will. You figure out which one it is. [sigh]

     If any of you column writers of past Issues wish to restart your
     efforts or if any of you closet columnists wish make regular
     contributions, check ARTSPEC.DOC and have at it! FidoNews is only what
     FidoNet, at large, makes it.

     >Subject: New MS WORD Email spread virus

     The official MICROSOFT web page acknowledges that their wordprocessor,
     WORD (all versions) and their Internet mail product, MSMAIL are
     vulnerable to another macro type virus that CAN be spread by Email
     described as follows:

             ShareFun.A Virus Information

     ShareFun.A is a new virus that utilizes MSMail and Microsoft Word to
     spread itself three-fold throughout your email network. Also known as
     the "ShareTheFun" virus, it is spread by using MSMail email messages
     and attaching itself as an embedded document. The subject line of the
     email reads "You have GOT to read this!"

     ShareFun.A is a WordBasic virus, running in Word 6 and Word 95. It has
     also been found in Word 97 Visual Basic for  Applications (VBA), after
     the infected Word 95/6.0 document has been opened in Word 97. The
     virus runs and infects the Word environment whenever an infected Word
     document is opened.

     Details are available at:

     Eating Crow - A FidoNet Diet
     By: Clay Tannacore  1:372/4

        For the last several months I have from time to time been engaged
     in writing guest editorials for FIDONEWS.  You on the other hand have
     been condemned to either reading them, or scooting past this section,
     so that you might indulge yourself in the technical aspects of
     FidoNet, one of the most celebrated portions of FIDONEWS, assuredly.
     Of course, you haven't been entirely immersed in the body of knowledge
     (aka technologies) of FIDONEWS, by no means.  Some of you fine, fellow
     SysOps have instead been preoccupied with *flaming* me via NetMail, in
     various Echoes, and by even placing late night calls to my home.  Why?
     Well, it's simple.  I have had the audacity to question FidoNet, and
     POLICY 4.  Apparently these subjects are taboo, if the writers opinion
     varies in any way from standard operating procedures, or the status
     quo.  I obviously stumbled into the area of our association reserved
     exclusively for *The Blessed Ones* of our brotherhood.  Because of
     this unholy transgression, I have been placed on a diet of *CROW*.
     That's right, I am now "eating crow" as my mainstay, my only allowable
     meal until I learn to communicate with the masses, and conform to the
     mind set of the majority.  I must undergo *reprogramming* in my mental
     attitude towards FidoNet, POLICY 4, and any imbecilic procedure that
     is contrived by the *Almighty* powers that be.

        So, henceforth I will *not* indulge in any criticism,
     animadversions, or any other commentary concerning FidoNet, nor will I
     even express my opinion that POLICY 4, requires unequivocal
     modifications.  No longer will I be the *one* dissenting voice in this
     association.  Now that I find total harmony alive and well in FidoNet.
     Now that I have been shown the *proper* path I must take to coexist in
     this federation.  Now, I resign myself to becoming assimilated into
     the *true* brotherhood of Fido Net SysOps.  No longer will I allow my
     testosterone to rule me.  I will become yet another cretin in the
     fraternity of SysOps, in the land of FidoNet. .  .

        All the above crap aside, I *have* decided to *shut up* (loud
     applause) and leave well enough alone.  I have been gutted by Network
     Coordinators, an RC or two, and more damn SysOps than are listed in
     the NODELIST.  So, with *everybody* telling me how wrong I am about
     POLICY 4, and FidoNet as a hole (OOPs, I meant whole), and with only a
     few (about 4 percent) SysOps in agreement with my views, I think it is
     time I faded off into obscurity and allow you folks who read this
     news-letter, to get a bigger dose of FTSC-0001 type literature to
     digest from now on.

        I do want to thank all of the guys/gals who have had to suffer
     through my odious attacks on POLICY 4, and the general *C structure of
     FidoNet.  I never *really* expected to see any changes made in the way
     this association is operated.  I was, however hoping that will
     FIDONEWS as my outlet, some positive dialog would evolve.  Some did,
     but only for a short time.  Then it seemed that the voices that were
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 4                   21 Apr 1997


     raised, dissolved.  Either because of disappointment when noting was
     seemingly getting done , or because of inter network intimidation.
     Whatever the case, as expected, nothing has changed.  The new motto
     for FidoNet, and the old motto, is still; "STATUS QUO for FIDO", sung
     to the tune of "God Bless Armenia" (and that ain't America). . .

        While I'm thanking people, let me thank a guy who has (probably)
     the least appreciated job, in this organization.  Chris(topher) Baker,
     the Editor of FIDONEWS.  I know this guy has spent enough of his
     personal money on phone calls alone, to place a substantial down
     payment on a 98 Mercedes.  A damn shame too, in my opinion.  I think
     each Net in *every* region should help support FIDONEWS, with a once a
     year contribution of say, ten cents per node per month, or a one time
     a year payment by the SysOp of one dollar ($1.00).  Now, this one
     should get me a group of new words to add to my vocabulary. . .[smile]

        So long folks, See All of You, On The Internet. . .(BS)

     FIDO Toes Up
     by Tom Johannsen, 1:104/540

     Has anyone paid attention to the size of the nodelist lately?  It's
     shrinking.  Why?  The internet?  Lack of interest?  Politics?
     Technology?  None of the above?

     How about all of the above.  I've been in FIDO almost since it's
     inception. I watched it grow until it broke the nodediff processors
     and sent everyone back to the drawing board.  I've watched the
     in-fighting and the birth of the term Fight-o-Net.  I've watched the
     gradual decline of the comradeship, the friendship, that was the
     purpose of FIDO to begin with.  I can remember a time when you could
     actually call the (now zc) on the phone and get help with anything you
     needed.  He actually listened, he MADE time for you.  I watched FIDO
     grow from a hodge-podge collection of BBS' to the formation of nets to
     the ultimate - zones.  Now nodes in the U.S. are declining so fast
     that the growth of other zones cannot even keep up with the attrition.
     Zone 1 is now outnumbered. The reason?  All of the above.

     FIDO is being overrun by "all of the above".

     The INTERNET because of it's easy accessibility, it's timeliness of
     both files and responses.  You can send and receive response messages
     clear around the world in less than a day.  You can chat with anyone
     anywhere, you can get the most recent files written.  You don't need
     to even keep any archives.  The i-net has it all.  EXCEPT for
     friendliness.  It's very antiseptic.  You rarely ever meet the people
     you come into contact with.

     The LACK OF INTEREST is due primarily because of selfishness and
     greed.  People don't run BBS' or call BBS' for the fun factor, as they
     used to.  Most sysops that are just starting out in FIDO now do it for
     purely selfish reasons.  They already know what they are getting into
     and have decided to *use* fido to get what they want, whether it is
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 5                   21 Apr 1997


     files or echos or experience.  A very few do it "just for the fun of
     it" and they rarely last over a couple of years.  They soon find out
     just how bad it REALLY is.  They volunteer to be a hub or become an
     NEC or NC. Then reality hits. They find out just how little anyone
     cares in FIDO.

     The POLITICS have caused a large part of the attrition.  Policy 4 was
     initially written to act as a GUIDE to helping people in the net.  Now
     it's used more as a CLUB to pound with.  It's selectively enforced and
     NEVER fairly.  Policy 4 is in shambles.  It needs re-writing.  When it
     was written we foresaw growth, but not to the extent that actually
     occurred, particularly in the area of echomail.  However, P4 will
     never be redone.  Why?  Laziness and Politics, along with apathy and
     resistance to change.  Instead of creating a document that would
     promote the growth of the net, the only thing I see are inputs that
     are submitted by someone "with an axe to grind".  Or I see someone
     with a good idea being shot down by someone without a clue as to why
     FIDO exists.  There is no ACTIVE participation by anyone that can get
     the job done.  They lurk, they read, but they don't participate.  Why?
     Because it might tarnish their image to align themselves with an
     unpopular idea.  So long as they don't have the "moxy" to stand up and
     go for it, P4 will *forever* be P4.

     The TECHNOLOGY of FIDO has fallen terribly short of reality.  There
     was a time when FIDO sysops were asked for help on many cutting edge
     programs/equipment.  Now????  When was the last time you saw a 300
     baud modem?  Statistics say that there are 2323 of them out there
     somewhere.  There's a whole 9 (count 'em, nine) 1200 baud modems and
     so on to 9600 baud modems.  Of those listed as 9600, roughly 2/3rds
     are v.34 types.  Why does the nodelist not reflect the true speeds?
     Politics? Laziness?  Or some other lame excuse.  Other nets have been
     using true speeds for some time now in THEIR nodelists.  Why can't
     FIDO?  Don't ask someone.  They will tell you that it's because some
     software cannot handle them.  Technology???  If that's the case then
     why don't they update the software?  However, we know that's not the
     case.  If it were then how is it the other nets use the same software
     and get the job done.

     In Summary.
     FIDO is a dinosaur with it's brain in it's tail.  The problem is that
     the tail was cut off and the message hasn't reached the rest of it's
     body yet.  If it doesn't learn to adapt and improve it's technology,
     it's dead (or close to it), for zone 1 at least, and just doesn't know
     it.

     The only thing the sysops of FIDO can agree on is to DISagree.  This
     DISagreement is DISagreeable and DISgraceful to those that have any
     pride left.  Others just don't care I guess.  It's a shame.  No one in
     FIDO seems to care what image FIDO has.

     I've become a minority.  All those years of work on building and
     promoting FIDO by myself and other "old-timers" has gone for naught.
     Others that really CARED have already left.  Even the founder is no
     longer in the nodelist.  Maybe Tom J. was right.  I know that soon
     I'll follow the rest of the "old-timers" and leave FIDO.  Why? Because
     it is beyond help.  It has become Deaf, Dumb, and Self-Serving.  Fresh
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 6                   21 Apr 1997


     ideas are voiced to deaf ears.  Software writers are leaving because
     of the dumb antiquated technology and requirements.  Improvements are
     frowned on OR ignored.  New concepts or new ideas are rejected out of
     hand.

     Am I bitter?  NO!  Am I "out to get someone"?  NO!  Am I sad?  Yes.

     Roll over FIDO, point your toes up, get comfortable, and play dead.
     Actually, the FIDO I knew is not playing.  It IS dead.

     Lock and Load: Guerilla Marketing for BBSes
     Robert Parson 1:3822/1

     I hope you did your homework.  In our last column I asked you to
     collect up information about your local newspapers and radio and tv
     stations, and advised you we would be sending them some information.
     Those of you who have since also downloaded the "BBS Guide to Public
     Relations" probably know what I'm going to talk about next.

     That's right, we're going to talk about News Releases.

     The News Media is your friend.  Yes.  They really can be.  I know that
     the image of BBSes in the media is not generally a happy one, but you
     can turn that around with a grass roots effort.  All it takes is your
     wordprocessor and your fax modem.

     Anyone who's seen a movie or tv show about journalists knows that
     there are five "W's" that must be answered:  Who, What, When, Where,
     and Why.  You don't need to write a lot to get all those in.  I once
     wrote a news story about a traffic fatality in two sentences.  ("A 68
     year old (city) man was killed in a traffic accident today.  Police
     say (name) slipped off a curb at (street) in (city) and was hit by a
     car driven by (another name).")

     The main issue, though, is that there must be something going on.  You
     can't just say "Joe Blow invites everyone to call his BBS."  You
     could, but it means nothing.  What is going on at your BBS that might
     entice someone to call?  How about some recently added Fidonet Echos?
     Now you have something.  So crack open that wordprocessor and let's
     crunch some words.

     First, you need a headline.   Something like "NEWSBOB BBS EXPANDS"

     Now, the news release.  (I'm making up some echos here, obviously)

     "NEWSBOB Computer Bulletin Board System (BBS) has added several new
     message areas that are share messages with BBSes around the world.
     The new areas are 'Newsbob,' discussions about Award Winning Broadcast
     Journalist Robert Parson; 'Bobmobile,' discussions about his car; and
     'Bobsquad,' discussions about his wife and three children.

     "The message areas are shared internationally, or 'echoed,' with
     roughly 25 thousand BBSes through FIDONet, the oldest and largest
     amateur message network.  Fidonet carries messages with topics ranging
     from abortion to zymurgy.

     "NEWSBOB BBS can be reached by anyone with a computer by dialing XXX
     XXX XXXX with their modem.

     "For more information call Robert Parson at XXX XXX XXXX"

     Let's break this down into its five components:  Who, which in this
     case is a thing: Newsbob BBS.  What:  New Echos.  When: Recently (not
     stated, but understood).  Where: locally, or alternatively, in
     Cyberspace (that is an actual place now, according to the latest
     Associated Press style).  Why: expand the offerings of the BBS.   You
     don't have to be a particularly brilliant writer.  But if you include
     all the necessary information, your News Release will, at the very
     least, be readable.

     There's also information about how the echos are distributed, how to
     get on the BBS, and just as importantly, how to get hold of someone to
     talk to in case a reporter has some questions.  In most cases, if
     there is now contact information, a News Release will be dumped into
     the trash.

     Make sure your News Release is checked for spelling.  Although it
     probably won't be dismissed out of hand for spelling errors, it does
     look unprofessional.  And professional is the image we're shooting
     for, right?

     Finally, try to keep your News Release to one page.  Most reporters
     will read the first couple paragraphs and act on it, file it, or trash
     it.

     Now print it out on that letterhead you ordered (or designed on your
     DTP), and drop it in the mail to the media contacts you made in your
     previous calls.  Yes, you can send a fax if you prefer.

     Do NOT expect anyone to call, and do NOT expect your News Release to
     result in a story in the paper or broadcast media.  You are competing
     with the normal news of the day, plus possibly hundreds of faxes and
     letters from others trying get space or airtime.  A couple years ago,
     I helped a local BBS wage a Media Campaign.  It took about two months
     of weekly faxed News Releases before it finally resulted in a story.

     There are other things you can have in a News Release besides
     additions to your BBS.  You could include anticipation of the 10
     thousandth caller (or 100 thousandth, or whatever), with a follow up
     of who that person was.  A gaming tournament.  My favorite: local
     angles to national stories.  For instance, I contacted a local
     Internet Service Provider this year to see if it was having the same
     connection problems AOL was having due to the explosive growth of the
     Internet (they claimed they weren't).

     Be creative with your topics for News Releases.  Nearly anything your
     BBS is doing can become a possible news story.  It's simply a matter
     spinning it correctly.

     Next time, we'll talk about how to handle those media scallywags.

       A proposed standard for the interchange of USENET News messages
                               among FidoNet nodes.

     Status of this document:

          This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the FidoNet(r)
          community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
          improvements.  Distribution of this document is unlimited.

          Fido and FidoNet are registered marks of Tom Jennings and Fido
          Software.

     Introduction:

     This document defines the standard format for the interchange of
     USENET news messages among FidoNet nodes.  It incorporates by
     reference the document RFC-1036, "Standard for Interchange of USENET
     Messages" by M.  Horton of AT&T Bell Laboratories and R. Adams of the
     Center for Seismic Studies.  A copy of RFC-1036 should be included in
     the distribution archive of this standard.  However, RFC-1036 is NOT
     applicable in its entirety to FidoNet.  Therefore, unless specifically
     referenced elsewhere in this document, only section 2 of RFC-1036
     should be considered part of this standard.  Section 3, which deals
     with "control messages", may be implemented in FidoNet on an optional
     basis, and if processing of control messages is included in a FidoNet
     implementation, it should be done in accordance with section 3 of RFC-
     1036 to the extent possible.  Section 4 of RFC-1036 is *NOT*
     applicable to FidoNet (except for section 4.3, which will be discussed
     later) and therefore is NOT included as part of this standard.
     Section 5 of RFC-1036 is a treatise on the News Propagation Algorithm
     used within UseNet, and should be studied even though it is not
     directly applicable to FidoNet, in particular because it contains a
     discussion on the prevention of loops (what we in FidoNet commonly
     refer to as "dupe loops").

     Please note that FidoNet implementations do not recognize nor support
     what is referred to as the "old format" or the "A format" in section 2
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 10                  21 Apr 1997


     of RFC-1036.

     The goal of this document is to define a standard for the interchange
     of news messages between FidoNet nodes in a format that will also be
     acceptable to UseNet hosts.  In order to simplify the creation of
     software that conforms to this standard, we do not intend to support
     every news format that has ever existed in UseNet.  The standard
     described in RFC-1036 is used by the majority of UseNet hosts, and
     therefore it is the standard that will be adopted in this document.

     This standard will contain three sections:  General theory of
     newsgroup transmission, Format and protocols of batched newsgroups,
     and the translation of newsgroup messages to and from FidoNet message
     format.

     1. General theory of newsgroup transmission:

     Prior to the introduction of the DoveMail program, the usual method of
     gating a UseNet newsgroup into FidoNet was to convert it to FidoNet
     echomail, and then send it to "downstream" nodes in echomail format.
     This method is still used at the majority of gateway systems at this
     writing.  Unfortunately, no conversion process is perfect, and some
     useful control information is usually lost in the conversion.  In
     addition, most FidoNet echomail processors don't handle long messages
     (which are fairly common in newsgroups) well at all, and many gateway
     systems either try to split these messages into multiple parts (a
     somewhat awkward process) or discard them entirely.  Because the
     duplicate message detection algorithms used in many FidoNet echomail
     processors incorrectly identify some of the parts of a split message
     as duplicates, parts of long messages often get "lost" when
     transmitted as echomail.  Also, UseNet allows a message to be posted
     to multiple newsgroups, and when such messages are converted to
     echomail, it may be necessary to create multiple copies of the message
     (one for each echomail area that it would be placed in), thus
     increasing the transmission time for such messages.

     Even normal-length newsgroup messages may be falsely discarded as
     duplicates by some "downstream" echomail processors.  The reason this
     is a particular problem in newsgroups converted to echomail is because
     some echomail processors use a checksum of parts of FidoNet message
     headers to determine if messages are duplicates. Since all newsgroup
     messages are assumed to be addressed to "All", and since some gateway
     software uses the date and time that the message was converted to
     echomail rather than the original date and time from the message, it's
     quite possible that the remainder of the message header contains
     information that is similar enough to information in another message's
     header to cause it to be discarded as a duplicate message.  This
     happens far more frequently with converted newsgroup messages than
     with messages originally entered as echomail.

     Finally, when a BBS user enters a reply to a news message that has
     been converted to echomail, in many cases the information is simply
     not available in the original message to generate a proper
     "References:" line in the reply, as required by RFC-1036.  If the
     original message contained a "Followup-To:" line, which requires that
     replies be posted to a different newsgroup than the one in which the
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 11                  21 Apr 1997


     original message was entered, this line may not transmitted in the
     message as converted to echomail.  And even if this information is
     available, no echomail processor currently available will modify the
     reply message as required (to add the "References:" line where
     necessary, or to move the message to a different area if it is a reply
     to a message that contained a "Followup-To:" line).

     Under this proposed standard, none of the UseNet message header
     information is lost in transmission between nodes, and reply messages
     can be generated that conform to UseNet specifications.  If a message
     is posted to multiple newsgroups, it is only transmitted once (instead
     of multiple times as it might be if converted to echomail).  Also,
     long messages are not truncated or changed in transmission between
     nodes, and finally, there is no chance that a message will be
     improperly discarded as a duplicate.

     The main thing to remember is that under this standard, news messages
     are never converted to echomail.  Echomail is an irrelevant concept in
     this context, since we are not passing echomail between nodes.
     Instead, newsgroups are transmitted in the native format specified by
     RFC-1036, and tossed directly from batched newsgroup packets to the
     FidoNet message format (e.g. the *.msg format) if necessary.  Keep in
     mind that most FidoNet BBS software uses the same general format not
     only for echomail messages, but also for netmail and local message
     areas, so it is not necessary to transmit messages between nodes in
     echomail format if another format is more suitable for the type of
     message being transmitted.

     2. Format and protocols of batched newsgroups:

     When newsgroup messages are transmitted between systems, the
     individual messages must conform to the specifications of section 2 of
     RFC-1036, and section 3 of this document.  Where section 3 of this
     document defines a more restrictive standard than RFC-1036, this
     document shall take precedence.

     When transmitting news messages between FidoNet nodes, they must be
     sent in a batched newsgroup file (as described in section 4.3 of RFC-
     1036) unless some other format is agreed upon in advance.  The
     transmission of unbatched news messages, or the use of any batching
     method other than that described in section 4.3 of RFC-1036 shall be
     considered non-standard.  Please note that RFC-1036 section 4.3 refers
     to this batching process as combining several messages into "one large
     message", but we will refer to this "one large message" as a "batched
     newsgroup file", or a "UseNet format mail packet" rather than as a
     "large message", since FidoNet systems do not normally handle large
     "messages".

     When messages pass through a FidoNet system on their way to other
     nodes, the header lines in the message may be modified to conform with
     the standards given here.  However, the text (body) of a message
     should NEVER be altered (one exception: Carriage Returns MAY be
     converted to Line Feeds in order to conform to this standard, but this
     is neither required nor expected of software).

     The standard format for sending a batched newsgroup file to other
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 12                  21 Apr 1997


     FidoNet nodes is as follows:

     First, as will be noted in section 3 of this document, individual
     lines of the batched newsgroup file must be terminated with Line Feeds
     only, and the file must NOT contain Carriage Return characters (ASCII
     13).

     Batched newsgroup files shall be transmitted between FidoNet nodes as
     files named using the filename ????????.PKU, where the eight character
     root name can be any of the hexadecimal digits 0 - 9 or A - F.  The
     .PKU extension (which stands for "PacKet - Usenet format") is the news
     equivalent of the .PKT file used to transmit FidoNet format netmail
     and echomail between nodes.

     Batched newsgroup files with the filespec ????????.PKU may be archived
     into a standard mail archive file (bearing the extension *.MO?, *.TU?,
     *.WE? ... *.SU?).  It is assumed that the receiver of batched
     newsgroup files will take any necessary steps to make sure that both
     *.PKU and *.PKT files are extracted from incoming mail archive files
     before the mail archive files are deleted.  In certain cases, this may
     mean that an external unarchive shell may have to be used, instead of
     allowing the echomail processor to call the unarchiver (typical
     external unarchive shell programs at this writing are GUS, POLYXARC,
     and SPAZ).

     A batched newsgroup file awaiting transmission may be stored in a
     FidoNet system's "outbound" area in uncompressed form, prior to being
     archived for transmission or sent in uncompressed form.  It is
     suggested that when a system uses the .OUT extension to indicate an
     uncompressed netmail or echomail packet, the .UUT extension be used to
     indicate an uncompressed batched newsgroup packet.  It is expected
     that a .UUT file in a system's "outbound" area will be treated in much
     the same way as an .OUT file, except it will be renamed to a file with
     an extension of .PKU (rather than .PKT) before being archived into the
     mail archive.  This implies that the root name of the .UUT file will
     contain the net number and node number of the destination system,
     expressed as four hexadecimal digits each for net and node numbers, in
     the same manner as the root name for a FidoNet .OUT file is
     constructed.

     The root filename of the *.PKU file should be an eight digit
     hexadecimal number, with leading zeroes used if necessary, in order to
     make an eight character root filename.  It is suggested that this
     hexadecimal number be based on time of year, with 00000000.PKU
     generated at exactly midnight on January 1 and FFFFFFFF.PKU generated
     at just a moment before midnight on December 31.  However, it is
     permissible to use the same algorithm that is used to generate the
     root filename for *.PKT files.

     The normal sequence for transmission of messages between FidoNet nodes
     might then be described as follows:

     a. Messages created on the originating system are placed into a
     batched newsgroup file conforming to the specifications of RFC-1036
     section 4.3.  When this batched newsgroup file is destined for another
     FidoNet node, it will have a filename of the format:
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 13                  21 Apr 1997


          [4 hex digit net number][4 hex digit node number].UUT

     This file will then be placed in the outbound mail area for packing.

     b. A mail packing program will examine the outbound mail area and,
     upon finding the .UUT file, will rename it to a file with an extension
     of .PKU, and then shell to a compression program in order to place the
     *.PKU file into a new or existing mail archive file for the
     destination node.  Mail archive files bear extension names consisting
     of the first two letters of a day of the week (in the English
     language) plus a numeric character in the range 0 - 9 (for example,
     .MO5 or .TH7).  The method of compression for the mail archive is as
     agreed upon between the originating and destination nodes.  No
     "standard" method of compression for the mail archive is specified in
     this document.  NOTE: If the compression program fails for any reason
     (such as running out of disk space), the mail packing program MUST
     rename the .PKU file back to the original *.UUT filename before
     exiting.  Since batched newsgroup files do not contain a header that
     indicates the destination node, there would be no way to determine the
     proper destination node if the file were not renamed back to the
     original filename.

     c. The mail archive is transmitted in the usual manner by a FidoNet
     compatible mailer, or such other means as may be agreed upon in
     advance by the sysops of the originating and destination nodes.

     d. At the destination system, the individual files are extracted from
     the mail archive.  *.PKT files are processed in the usual manner to
     extract any netmail or echomail messages, while *.PKU files are
     processed by software designed to handle batched newsgroup files.  In
     this context, such files could be "handled" by re-processing the
     messages and batching them to be sent on to one or more additional
     node(s), or by tossing the messages to the local message base, or
     both.

     Please note that this standard does not anticipate that batched
     newsgroup files will be converted to FidoNet echomail at any point
     along the way.  It is realized that this may indeed happen, but such
     conversions should be considered as something to be avoided if at all
     possible due to the problems discussed in section 1 of this document.

     3. Translation of newsgroup messages to and from FidoNet message
     format:

     NOTE: Where applicable, the standards defined in this section for
     messages shall apply not only to locally created messages, but also to
     all messages sent to "downstream" FidoNet nodes.

     In this context, "FidoNet message format" means that format in which
     messages commonly reside on a FidoNet BBS.  At this writing, there are
     three formats commonly used for message storage on FidoNet systems,
     but other formats may be in use as well.  The three most common
     formats are the "*.msg" format as used by the original Fido program
     (and a host of programs since), also commonly referred to as the
     "single message per file format"; the "Hudson" format, used by
     QuickBBS, Remote Access, and some other products; and the "Squish"
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 14                  21 Apr 1997


     format used by the Maximus BBS and the "Squish" echomail processor.

     Because there are so many message formats, some other programs have
     taken the approach of trying to convert UseNet news into echomail,
     creating *.PKT files which can theoretically be processed by any
     FidoNet system.  However, since the *.PKT files are processed by the
     echomail processor, all the limitations and pitfalls associated with
     converting newsgroup messages to echomail come into play.

     The preferred way of handling incoming messages would be to have the
     BBS (or message reader/editor) software directly read batched
     newsgroup files.  In this way, the files would not have to be
     "processed" per se.  As new batched newsgroup files arrived on a
     system, they could simply be concatenated to the existing message
     base, and then a utility could be run that would build an index to the
     message base, in a manner somewhat similar to the way "flat file"
     message bases are currently implemented on some BBS's.  Of course,
     you'd need to occasionally run a utility to delete old messages in
     order to keep the message base from growing too large, and new
     messages entered on the system would have to be exported from the
     system in a separate batched newsgroup file.  However, at this writing
     no FidoNet-compatible BBS or message editor is capable of directly
     reading a batched newsgroup file.

     The second most preferable method is to convert news messages directly
     to the message format used by that system.  At this writing the
     DoveMail software includes utilities (NewsToss and NewsScan) that can
     convert batched newsgroup files to and from messages in the *.msg
     (single message per file) format.  It should be possible to convert
     batched newsgroup files to and from other FidoNet message formats as
     well.

     The method in which messages are stored on a BBS, and the method in
     which it is determined which new (locally-entered) messages need to be
     exported from the system will necessarily be implementation-specific.
     One method that can be used with *.msg type message bases is to
     maintain a "high water mark" in 1.msg, similar to the "high water
     mark" used for echomail messages, and additionally to mark messages
     received from other nodes as "sent" when they arrive, and locally-
     entered messages as "sent" when they have been exported, and to never
     re-send a message marked as "sent".

     When tossing incoming messages, duplicate messages can be detected by
     comparing the contents of the "Message-ID:" line with those of
     previously received messages.  This may be slow processing
     considerably, however, and would require storage of a history file of
     "previously seen" messages.  Another method is to look in the "Path"
     line and see if we are already listed in the path; if so, the message
     is a duplicate and should be deleted.  This method is faster and does
     not require maintenance of a history file, but will not guard against
     duplicate messages arriving from one's feed that have not passed
     through the system twice (for example, a message that arrived from two
     different paths).  Fortunately, UseNet folks seem to understand the
     need for proper topology, so those types of dupes are relatively rare.
     FidoNet sysops taking UseNet feeds must understand that it is
     IMPERATIVE that a feed of any one newsgroup be obtained from only ONE
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 15                  21 Apr 1997


     source, especially if they are then passing that newsgroup to any
     "downstream" nodes.  This absolutely does NOT imply that geographic
     restrictions on newsgroup distribution are necessary or desirable!

     Additional comments on preventing "loops" can be found in section 5 of
     RFC-1036, in the discussion of the News Propagation Algorithm.  Please
     note that only two methods of loop prevention are included in this
     standard:

     1) The history mechanism.  Each host keeps track of all messages it
     has seen (by their Message-ID) and whenever a message comes in that it
     has already seen, the incoming message is discarded immediately.

     2) Not sending a message to a system listed in the "Path" line of the
     header, or to the system that originated the message (which, in
     practice, should be listed in the Path line).

     No other methods of dupe loop prevention are acceptable.  In
     particular, checksums of portions of the message header or message
     itself are NOT permitted to be used for loop prevention, except
     perhaps as a method to quickly identify POTENTIAL duplicate messages
     before doing a full string comparison with the Message-ID data in the
     history file.  In no case should a checksum be used as the SOLE method
     of determining whether a message is a duplicate.

     When newsgroup messages are created for transmission to other systems,
     or when received messages are transmitted other systems, the
     individual messages must conform to the specifications of section 2 of
     RFC-1036.  However, in order to simply programming of software
     designed to handle such messages, the following modifications to the
     standard are proposed for use within FidoNet.  Please note that these
     are slightly more restrictive than the standard permitted by RFC-1036:

     a. The "old format" or "A format" described in section 2 of RFC-1036
     is NOT supported in FidoNet.  Only the format detailed in RFC-1036
     (sometimes referred to as the "B" News format) is supported.  The vast
     majority of UseNet sites currently use the "B" News format.

     b. The UseNet standard permits the use of "white space" to separate
     certain items in the message header, with "white space" defined as
     blanks or tabs.  It also states that "the Internet convention of
     continuation header lines (beginning with a blank or tab) is allowed."
     However, it should NOT be ASSUMED that "continuation header lines"
     will be used in any message.  It is suggested that when creating
     newsgroup messages for transmission to other systems, the use of tab
     characters be avoided in header lines, and that "continuation header
     lines" NOT be used, even if this means that a header line will be
     considerably longer than the length of a screen line.  Software that
     creates FidoNet-format messages (for display to BBS callers) from
     batched newsgroup files (that is, newsgroup message tossers) should
     break up such extra-long header lines, using a single space character
     ONLY (NOT a tab!) at the start of "continuation header lines."  Since
     batched newsgroup files received from a UseNet site may contain
     "continuation header lines" and/or tabs as "white space" in header
     lines, it is necessary to be able to decode such header lines
     properly, but it is strongly suggested that FidoNet software not
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 16                  21 Apr 1997


     CREATE messages with tabs or "continuation header lines" for
     transmission through the network.

     c. All lines in news messages, including header lines, shall be
     terminated with a LINE FEED (ASCII 10 decimal) ONLY.  Under NO
     circumstances shall a CARRIAGE RETURN (ASCII 13 decimal) appear in
     news messages transmitted through FidoNet (if a Carriage Return is
     found in an in-transit message it MAY be changed to a Line Feed, this
     being the sole exception to the rule about not changing the body of a
     message, but the expectation is that no Carriage Returns will appear
     in a news message).  Also, spaces appearing at the end of lines (just
     prior to the Line Feed character) are strongly discouraged since they
     convey no useful information.  Finally, there should be only a single
     line feed at the end of each message (blank lines following the last
     line of a message are not allowed, again because they convey no useful
     information).  Please note that the use of the Line Feed as a line
     terminator is fairly standard throughout UseNet, and when a news
     message is converted to a FidoNet format message it is a simple matter
     to replace Line Feeds with Carriage Returns so that the message will
     display properly.

     d. When constructing or adding to "Path" lines, RFC-1036 (section
     2.1.6) states that "The names may be separated by any punctuation
     character or characters (except '.' which is considered part of the
     hostname)."  However, in actual practice, only the "!" (exclamation
     point or "bang" character) is commonly used to separate names.
     Therefore, the "!" character will be considered the "standard"
     separator for system names in Path lines in messages generated in
     FidoNet.  Also, RFC-1036 states that "Normally, the rightmost name
     will be the name of the originating system.  However, it is also
     permissible to include an extra entry on the right, which is the name
     of the sender.  This is for upward compatibility with older systems."
     In actual practice, it appears that most Path lines originating in
     UseNet have a user name as the rightmost entry.  Therefore, when a
     Path line is created for a message originating in FidoNet, it is
     suggested that the following format be used (assuming a message
     entered by user John Smith at node 1:123/456):

          Path: f456.n123.z1.fidonet.org!john.smith

     When a user name is placed in the path, all spaces in the user name
     must be replaced with periods, and all uppercase characters in the
     name should be converted to lowercase.  It is permissible to use an
     alias in place of a user's real name if the originating system runs
     software that will recognize that alias in incoming netmail messages,
     and remap such messages to the proper user if necessary.  Also, note
     the restrictions on prohibited characters in the user name as
     specified in RFC-1036 section 2.1.1.  Although section 2.1.1. deals
     with the "From" line, common sense would indicate that these same
     restrictions on prohibited characters should apply if the user name is
     placed in the Path line (with the obvious exception of the use of the
     period to replace spaces in the user name, which is required).

     e. Header lines defined as "optional" may be more or less optional
     depending on the keyword.  For example, the "Reply-To" and
     "Followup-To" lines should be automatically honored, if at all
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 17                  21 Apr 1997


     possible, when reply messages are created, and the "References" line,
     even though listed as an "optional" line, is "required for all
     follow-up messages" (replies).  On the other hand, lines such as
     "Control" and "Distribution" may have little meaning to FidoNet nodes
     (in particular, "Distribution" is meant to control distribution of a
     message along hierarchial lines, but since FidoNet topology has little
     relation to UseNet hierarchies, it is probably best to just ignore
     "Distribution" lines on in-transit messages).

     Additional specifications for messages, including required and
     optional header lines, are detailed in section 2 of RFC-1036.

     When a newsgroup is moderated, it is the responsibility of the sysop
     of each participating BBS to prevent users from entering messages in
     that area (unless the message exporting software is capable of sending
     any locally-entered messages to the conference moderator via MAIL).
     However, if a software newsgroup processor is written that both
     imports (tosses) messages to a FidoNet-format message base, and
     exports locally entered messages, and if the software does not have a
     way to send replies to the moderator via mail, then some mechanism
     must be provided to prevent the export of messages from a moderated
     area, so that in the unlikely event that there is no easy way to
     prevent users from posting messages in the moderated area, such
     messages will still not be sent out.  Since this standard does not
     deal with the transport of UseNet MAIL within FidoNet, the method for
     transmission of replies in moderated newsgroups is undefined by this
     document.  However, software authors are encouraged to provide some
     mechanism for private mail replies to newsgroup messages, in both
     moderated and unmoderated areas.

     Note that if a moderated newsgroup is carried on a system, it is the
     responsibility of the sysop to provide mail access to users so that
     replies can be (manually) sent to the conference moderator, especially
     if replies in the newsgroup area cannot be automatically routed to the
     conference moderator.

     One point that needs to be emphasized is there is NO message length
     limit on UseNet messages.  If a FidoNet node passes newsgroup messages
     to, or on behalf of other FidoNet nodes, it is NOT permissible to
     discard or truncate messages that exceed a preset length limit.  Note
     that in a batched newsgroup file, each message is preceded by a header
     of the form "#! rnews <length in bytes>".  Since the message text
     length is never changed in processing, it is possible to determine the
     length of a message after processing by reading in all the header
     lines, calculating the combined length of the header lines prior to
     making changes in the header (e.g. the Path line), then calculating
     the combined length of the header lines after making changes.  The
     difference between the original and the new length of the header lines
     can then be applied to the value given in the "#! rnews" line to
     determine the new message length, when is then used in the "#! rnews"
     header of the modified message.  Also, the number of bytes given in
     the "#! rnews" line, MINUS the length of the message header lines, is
     the length of the body of the message.  Once this length is known, the
     body of the message can be copied from the input file to the output
     file(s) in "chunks" small enough to fit in memory, until the end of
     the message is reached.

     The following comments are implementation suggestions applicable to
     current FidoNet-compatible BBS systems, though not necessarily to
     software that may be written in the future:

     It should be noted that when a BBS user enters a reply message, most
     FidoNet BBS software will "link" the reply message to the original by
     placing the message number of the original message in the message
     header (this is almost always the case if messages are stored in the
     "*.msg" format, in which case the number of the message being replied
     to is found at bytes 185-186 in the message header).  If the
     appropriate header lines have been stored in the text of the original
     message, it is possible to construct a reply message that meets all
     RFC-1036 specifications.  For example, a "References" line can be
     constructed from the "Message-ID" line (and the "References" line, if
     any) of the original message.  Similarly, if the original message
     contains a "Followup-To:" line, the reply can be posted to the
     newsgroup(s) specified in that line.  This may not work as expected if
     a message renumbering program or similar program messes with the
     message base before reply message is exported, so it is highly
     recommended that locally-entered newsgroup messages be exported as
     soon as practicable after they are entered.

     Since the user of a BBS may reply to a message entered by another user
     of the same BBS, it is recommended that when a message is exported,
     any UseNet format header lines created for the exported message also
     be written back to the original message if possible.  This will permit
     reply linking to remain intact even if two or more users of the same
     BBS participate in the same message thread.

     If a message is received that specifies more than one newsgroup in the
     "Newsgroups" header line, and corresponding message areas are
     available on the local system, one copy of the message should be
     placed in each such area.  For example, if the message is posted to
     four different newsgroups, and two of those groups are carried on the
     local BBS, then a copy of the message should be placed in the message
     base for each of those groups.  If users of a BBS are allowed to post
     a message to multiple newsgroups, then any message thus posted should
     be copied to the message bases of any of the other areas that are also
     carried on that system (and that the message was posted to) at the
     time the message is exported.

     This document is a DOC in which the CRC encoding and some usages of
     this encoding are explained. Also some routines are included. In some
     of the FTS & FTC doc's the encoding is very badly and sometimes wrong
     explained this will take a lot of time when you are planning to
     program a CRC encoding routine instead of using a routine which is
     made by someone. I will also include some routines and also the scheme
     to make a CRC routine so you can easily make a CRC check routine
     yourself in your program.

     What is a CRC :

     Simply explained a CRC is a division and the remainder is the CRC
     value.  I think this example will help you to understand it :
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 20                  21 Apr 1997


     1011 / 10011101 \
            1011
            ----
              1011
              1011
              ----
                 001 (This is the CRC value)

     Look familiar to division as you are used to learn at school. But
     there are some differences.

     When subtracting a bit the following table is used :
     0 - 0 = 0
     0 - 1 = 1
     1 - 0 = 1
     1 - 1 = 0

     There is a function called XOR which will use this table. When you are
     subtracting 0-1 = 1 then there is a shortage and normally you will
     take a higher bit to complete to subtraction.

     234
      91 -
     -----
     143

     You cut 200 to 100 because 3-9 = negative. But with the CRC you
     DO NOT use this !!!

     The divisor used with CRC encoding is a divisor with 1 bit more then
     de actual CRC. This is explained by the remainder which is always 1
     bit less then the divisor. If not then you can divide it a time again,
     not?

     Now you have to perform dividing on a row of char's and you can't do
     that without a special trick. What you do is shifting all the bits one
     by one into the CRC value and then checking if you can perform a
     division. Lets have a look at this example :

     1011 / 10011101 \

     We are gonna use a CRC of 3 bits (the highest bit is always cut).
     The first bit is the checkbit. We can divide if this bit is 1. In that
     case the value is big enough to divide.

        x 100 no we can not divide
         perform a shift to left and shift in the next bit.
        1 001 yes we can divide
          divide it by 1011
        0 010 the divided value (XOR'ed)
              we can not divide so shift to left and shift in the next bit.
        0 101 the shifted value + shifted bit.
              we can not divide so shift to left and shift in the next bit.
        1 011 the shifted value + shifted bit.
              divide it by 1011
        0 000 the divided value (XOR'ed)
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 21                  21 Apr 1997


              we can not divide it so shift to left and shift in the next
              bit.
        0 000 the shifted value + shifted bit.
              we can not divide it so shift to left and shift in the next
              bit.
        0 001 the shifted value + shifted bit.
              we can not divide it so shift to left and shift in the next
              bit.  OOOppps sorry the bits are gone so this is the
              remainder
          001 The 3 bit remainder (is 1 less then the divisor)

       0 101 no we can not divide so
         no we can not divide
         shift to left and take the next bit.
        1 011 yes we can divide
        0 000 the divided value (XOR'ed)
        0 001 okay we have shifted again to left and took again the next
          bit.
        0 010 again
        0 101 again

     Compare it to the division performed at page 1 and you will see the
     result is the same. But this method is more comfortable for computers.
     In fact it is the same way to divide but we as humans can take more
     bits and we can see direct if it is possible to divide and the
     computer can not.  But if we have to check every bit it will take a
     lot of time to put in every time 1 bit by bit. Now luckily for you
     that is not necessary. The computer and also your program can shift in
     byte per byte. But then you have to try the division 8 times every
     time you have putted in a byte. And the byte you have put in has to
     fit in your CRC. So when you have a CRC which is 2 bits in length than
     it won't fit of course. But generally a 16 bit CRC is used and even
     CRC32 are now in use. When in the near future CRC64 are used I'm not
     surprised. Okay now to the computer programming stuff. Here is a table
     with a good method to implement a CRC16 in any language. After this a
     program is stated with all the documentation in it. Remember a CRC16
     has a 17bit divisor. Bit 16 (As you know we start at bit 0) is 1. When
     not we have again a smaller divisor.

     CRC : wordvalue

     { This routine has to be executed 8 times }
     IF CRC bit 15 = 1
     then
     shift left 1, divide by divisor (16 bits)
     else
     shift left 1, {do not divide cause we can't}

     {After this put in the next byte}
     CRC = CRC + inputbyte

     {end of this routine}

     Simple isn't it. Now for the more experienced programmers a sample in
     pascal at the next page.

     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 22                  21 Apr 1997


     inpbyte = input byte for CRC
     oldCRC = old crc value
     divisor = the least 16 bits of the divisor string

     Function CRC16 ( inpbyte : byte, oldCRC : word, divisor : word ) :
     word ;

     var
     tel : word;
     temp : word;  {A simple variable to use to store the CRC)

     begin
     temp := oldCRC;
     for tel := 1 to 8 do
     begin

       If (temp and $8000)= $8000
       then
         begin
           temp := temp shl 1;
           temp := temp xor divisor;
         end
       else
         begin
           temp := temp shl 1;
         end;

       { Now we have to put in the next byte }

       temp := temp xor inpbyte;

       CRC16 := temp;

     end;

     {End of routine}

     This routine is easily to expand to CRC32. In that case you have to
     expand your divisor and temp and CRC function to LONG value's.

     Some additional information about CRC's :

     CRC16 divisor =  $1021 ( + bit 16 = $3021 )
     The CRC16 feed value (when you first call the CRC routine) is $0000
     CRC32 divisor =  $77073096 ( + bit 32 = $17707306 )
     The CRC32 feed value (when you first call the CRC routine) is
     $FFFFFFFF

     Q:  How many internet mail list subscribers does it take
             to change a light bulb?

      A:  1,331:
        1 to change the light bulb and to post to the mail list that the
               light bulb has been changed
       14 to share similar experiences of changing light bulbs and how
              the light bulb could have been changed differently.
        7 to caution about the dangers of changing light bulbs.
       27 to point out spelling/grammar errors in posts about changing
              light bulbs.
       53 to flame the spell checkers
      156 to write to the list administrator complaining about the light
              bulb discussion and its inappropriateness to this mail list.
       41 to correct spelling in the spelling/grammar flames.
      109 to post that this list is not about light bulbs and to please
              take this email exchange to alt.lite.bulb
      203 to demand that cross posting to alt.grammar, alt.spelling and
              alt.punctuation about changing light bulbs be stopped.
      111 to defend the posting to this list saying that we all use
              light bulbs and therefore the posts **are** relevant to
              this mail list.
      306 to debate which method of changing light bulbs is superior,
              where to buy the best light bulbs, what brand of light
              bulbs work best for this technique, and what brands are
              faulty.
       27 to post URLs where one can see examples of different light bulbs
       14 to post that the URLs were posted incorrectly, and to post
              corrected URLs.
        3 to post about links they found from the URLs that are relevant
     FIDONEWS 14-16               Page 27                  21 Apr 1997


              to this list which makes light bulbs relevant to this list.
       33 to concatenate all posts to date, then quote them including all
              headers and footers, and then add "Me Too."
       12 to post to the list that they are unsubscribing because they
              cannot handle the light bulb controversy.
       19 to quote the "Me Too's" to say, "Me Three."
        4 to suggest that posters request the light bulb FAQ.
        1 to propose new alt.change.lite.bulb newsgroup.
       47 to say this is just what alt.physic.cold_fusion was meant for,
              leave it here.
      143 votes for alt.lite.bulb.

     Good news: I've finally got the GEcho entries in the list.

     Peter Karlsson, the author of Announcer, has set up a home page for
     his software: http://www.mds.mdh.se/~dat95pkn/wolves/announcer.htm

     Note: At the end of April, I'll be phasing out the old Macintosh
     section. As always, I'll be happy to process any information I get,
     either before or after it is phased out.

     Note: Mid-May, I will phase out the entire "Old Info" section.
