                              Undead of Fidonet
                                  Doug Myers

     A lot of you responded to last week's editorial; here's what I've
     been hearing:

     We, the undead sysops of Fidonet, have decided against all common
     sense and advice to the contrary, to continue to practice our hobby.
     We know that the demand for the amateur system we created has
     largely subsided as technology has advanced and commercialization
     has created "Your Internet."  But we've decided to continue anyway.

     It's not so much that we want to return to the way it was - to the
     days when PC to PC communication was only possible to the public due
     to the efforts of amateur system operators.  In a sense, it was
     inevitable that computer manufacturers would someday develop systems
     sufficiently powerful and inexpensive that you could participate in
     the internet, and commercial interests would ultimately find it
     profitable enough to make it easy.  But before all this happened and
     it fell to us amateurs to provide communications, we found we
     enjoyed working together.

     It was an imperfect community we forged back then, but perhaps
     better because of the imperfections.  We didn't have any idea how to
     check out a credit card, so the folks then were worth what they
     could communicate.  Some were rich beyond compare, though they could
     barely afford the equipment they were working with.  We didn't have
     digital cameras online then, so all we could see was what a person
     wrote; perhaps the most beautiful would have only cast a plain
     picture image.

     We understand there are other communities on the Web, and that we
     have no franchise on this.  But what we had was good, and still is,
     so we're not giving it up.

     We're not repudiating progress.  Some of us are already active on
     the Internet; indeed even pioneering there.  Some of us will hang
     onto the old technology until the last possible minute, perhaps
     ultimately dropping out of sight rather than switch.  Most of us,
     though, will step into both arenas... perhaps forging a new place
     for Fido on the Web, perhaps preferring the old technology forever.
     We don't know... we're just not giving it up :)

     Perhaps this week's editorial is in the same vein as last week's,
     but with a touch of yellow journalism.  I'm about to utter
     blasphemies which, perhaps, will bring the Fidonet Elders from their
     chambers tearing their robes from their chest.
     ---Cut---

                    Blasphemy, Blasphemy! Crucify him! :)

     Do I sound like an elder?? :-))

     ---Cut---
     The BBS as we know it is a dying animal - it's not coming back in
     the old form we grew to know and love.  Why not?  Simply because
     we'll attract no users again - they'll log onto their ISP and play
     on the Internet even if they know about BBSes.  Why not?  The
     graphics are better than we ever dreamed about at the height of
     BBSing, the variety of activity is greater than we individual sysops
     could ever supply, and some areas such as e-business - which can
     transform lifestyle - were never even possible with BBSes.
     ---Cut---

     I wonder... Is Fidonet and BBS dying? Maybe in the sense that there
     are fewer Nodes and BBS out there and the Nodelist is shrinking. In
     other ways, I wonder....

     CB (Citizens Band Radio) was big when I was in my teens and early
     20's. It was the rage. CB shops were everywhere! Time went on and
     this "rage" died out. Did CB radio die? No. It is still here. Not as
     big as it used to be, but alive.

     AM radio was once the "thing"!... Now it is a small part of the
     industry due to FM radio. Is it dead? No. Still here, but smaller
     and more specialized.

     Fidonet is smaller than it was... It is shrinking in Nodes... Is it
     dead? No. Smaller? yes. The traffic is less, but we are still here.

     Let's look... We are down to half or a third of our largest size. I
     understand that it's hard to justify a BBS when no one calls it. Not
     a bad reason to quit. We don't have the graphics, we don't have the
     chat areas, we don't have the mass of information at the "click of a
     mouse". Well, that's life. We can either complain or live with it.
     I'll live, thank you. :)
     FIDONEWS 17-19               Page 3                    8 May 2000


     Points before I go on... Interesting thing about Points. With the
     Internet as a tool, a former Sysop that just can't justify keeping a
     BBS up and running can use the Internet to become a Point. Yes, we
     lose a BBS, Node and Sysop, but still have a person that is "in"
     Fidonet. I note that the FTSC is doing something about putting
     Points in the Nodelist. I wonder how this will affect the size of
     the Nodelist? Could we see the old 30,000+ listing of the past? I
     wonder...

     What about the Internet? Well... What about it?!? It's there. We
     can't change that. We can and do use it for Fidonet. We have Telnet,
     Web BBS, Packet Tunneling and other things we use the Internet for.
     I'm not a big fan of the Internet and I have concerns that Fidonet
     could become another Internet if we aren't careful.... But let's
     look on the other side of this. What if we didn't have the Internet
     as a tool for Fidonet? We are smaller now... what if there wasn't a
     way to access Fidonet, send Echomail and Netmail and Files and ???
     via the Internet? Could we do it via POTS lines like we did in the
     past? Probably, but at what cost? Yes, I do mean dollars. As with
     any "new rage" or "in thing", Fidonet went big and then dropped off.
     Could we keep going if there had been no Internet to help us with
     the cost? I wonder...

     Compete with the Internet? Could we??  Sure we could. Look at the
     Internet. When you boil all the stuff down, is it so much different?
     What does the Internet do that Fidonet doesn't do?

     Transfer files? Nope... Both of us do that. The web pages that you
     look at are nothing but files transferred via modem to a program
     that displays them. In fact, since BBS graphics are sent "on the
     fly" instead of being downloaded and then displayed by some fancy
     program, I see us at an advantage there. Maybe not as fancy, but
     faster.

     Send and receive information? Nope again. We both do that. Fidonet
     is a little slower in some ways, but in other ways, just as fast.
     Fidonet just can't reach the audience that the Internet can.

     Messages? Nope, we both do that as well. As above, not as fast at
     times and faster at other times. Not as big an audience either.

     Games? Well, gee. See above. :)

     Ok... So why can't we compete with the Internet?

     MONEY!!  Take a look at this. Let's take Fidonet technology, ad
     money and commercialize it. What do you have?  Sell services to
     customers. We _CAN_ deliver. You need a file from point A to point
     B? We'll get it there now!! Promote the Fidonet "Business". Get
     Fidonet Zones, Regions, Hubs, Nodes, Points in all places with
     software that sets itself up and makes the connection. Build a Point
     package that works like the "Web Browser". A business pays for the
     service, gets the software, installs it and starts sending
     information to where it's needed. The Point software is "mouseable"
     and "point and click". The software sets up a connection to a Node,
     Hub, Region, or Zone automatically and there you are. The people
     FIDONEWS 17-19               Page 4                    8 May 2000


     above the Point address are the "ISPs" of Fidonet. We charge for the
     service and deliver the goods. Crash mail direct. For the right
     money, we can get it there fast! In fact, the "heyday" of Fidonet
     saw many pay BBS systems that did things very similar to this.

     With something like this, I'd bet that for transferring of
     information, Fidonet technology could beat the pants off the
     Internet and its "site to site" relay system. The real question
     is.... Do we want to do this?!?!? Not Me!! That would be like the
     Ham Radio operators trying to compete with the Commercial Radio
     stations. Where does the hobby end and the business begin?

     Improve Fidonet.. of course! We've done that for years. Look at the
     original Fidonet BBS software and tell me otherwise. :) All I say
     is, let's improve the hobby, not compete with the others. Tread
     softly least we become our own worst enemy.

     Pardon my rambling here. I know I've been long winded, but it feels
     good to get it off my brain. :) I see Fidonet shrinking down to a
     hobby again, but not dying. We'll still be here.

     Last one out, please turn off the lights! :-))

     Best regards,

                     Fidonet is Dying - It's Time to Act
                     Email from Derrick, info@soluware.nl

     Dear Doug,

     I just finished reading the most recent Fidonet newsletter. Yes,
     Fidonet is dying unless we find a way to bring it back to life, and
     I think I have a solution for this. You said the reader should write
     if anything came up. In fact something came up months ago.

     I don't know about the country where you come from, but I suppose
     you might have heard from cable-modem. It's basically the death-
     penalty for Fido because it makes people stop using their FrontDoor,
     FMail, GoldED, or whatever package they use to dial in at their
     fido- provider (proFIDOr? :) ).

     Anyway, since the Internet is practically unstopable, we'd better
     use it's popularity. None of the services Internet is providing the
     community with has ever exceeded the warm, personal fidomail. I
     personally recently hooked up with Fido again, now I have contacted
     our national host (Jan Vermeulen, the Netherlands, 2:280/0). I
     wasn't able to use Fido because several hosts were dropping like
     flies.

     What we need is something similar to Fido. Newsgroups are nothing,
     they usually have no moderator and are so general that no one will
     feel at home. Plus, no e-mail editor can support multiple areas.

     So I thought of myself (you still guess, what the hell have cable-
     modems got to do anything with what you are saying?) ... What's
     e-mail. It's nothing but a simple host supporting the POP3/SMTP
     protocol. What we simply need to do is set up one or more
     mailservers, develop a new protocol and a mailclient to support the
     new protocol. A cable-modem can make it possible to set up a
     mailserver with several gigabytes for mail and file-storage without
     paying much.

     Such a server can be accessed from anywhere, because due to the
     cablemodem it is in the air for 24 hours a day, affordable for the
     common user. I was thinking about such a mailsystem, and I
     definitely am going to develop the software for it (the server will
     definitely be Linux, the client can be both Linux, Windows, DOS (for
     those that still want to pick up the mail with something similar to
     FrontDoor/Intermail or such a system).

     We can later extend it with short-message-services, voice-mail,
     videoconferencing and such. With one or more commercial mail- areas
     with interestgroups that people can connect to. This way we could
     even get the system sponsored so a bigger server can be put up which
     allows faster and better access.

     FIDONEWS 17-19               Page 6                    8 May 2000


     Through webadvertising we could get people's attention and create a
     new rage that has Fidonet's looks and feels, the graphical user-
     interface people want, and all the gadgets they get from other
     servers like ICQ / mIRC / Powwow and all that stuff.

     We're talking an offline mailclient here. One that picks up the mail
     like any simple POP3/SMTP client, but with the fidonet advantages.
     I'd propose the oldfassioned look and feel, as we know it with the
     DOS editors, and a more advanced version that gives the possibility
     to create messages that have an HTML look, but that's something for
     the future. Furthermore, I want to be include hotlinks so people can
     refer to webpages, ftp sites, but even files that can be downloaded
     directly from the mailserver. For these files can then be generated
     a filerequest that will be picked up next time the user picks up the
     mail. The mailclient should be able to be setup with a scheduler to
     pick up the mail at preprogrammed times, unlike those 'dumb' clients
     like MS Exchange.

     This really can become something, I have had several years
     (something like 6 or 7) experience in Fidonet like networks,
     including DigitalNet, ( )lympic, Contactnet, Quazienet and several
     others, I know the messaging- services like ICQ, mIRC, Powwow and
     know their (dis)advantages.

     With the help of those people that have supported fidonet for the
     past decade, I am certain that we can create something the
     internetworld is ready for.

     Normal 'fido-standards' can apply, such as moderators, a committee
     that handles incoming suggestions, solve conflicts and such. I want
     a system that is controlable but is free for users.

     I personally want to invest my time and money in it to create a
     system that will become popular among old fido-mailers that are now
     internetting and will think "hey, this looks familiar" and new users
     that can pick up just as easily.

     How? Well, that's one of the things that users currently break their
     neck over. Many people (especially people NEW to computers) are used
     to a simple click-click graphical interface and find DOS
     applications disgusting and hard to use. For someone new to
     computers it's practically IMPOSSIBLE to set up a system like
     FrontDoor/Fmail/Golded because they have no knowledge whatsoever
     about the system.

     The mailclient I want to develop must be simple to setup and use. I
     want to make it modular so people can easily plug in new technology.
     The basics must be a downloadable version from the internetsite that
     is hosted from the same server. This package contains all needed
     information to connect to the server. Installing the rest will be
     easy. A simple guide "What interests do you have" and click-click.
     Download the setup-information, setup the program, wait for
     authorisation from the host (ofcourse they should be able to receive
     general areas and write in areas with for example the attribute
     "guests allowed") and MAIL! :)

     FIDONEWS 17-19               Page 7                    8 May 2000


     People that want to host their own network can do the same thing,
     get a copy of the server software and we can have several networks
     in no time at all, they could co-exist like before, and a user would
     only need one mailcient to access them all in an orderly fashion.

     Let me know what you think, can we get a committee on it's feet and
     start designing standards, protocols, looks and feels? Are we ready
     for something like that and can we pull it off? I think we are, I
     think we can. I just hope that I can count on your cooperation.

     If I sent this to the wrong person, I'm sure you know where this
     e-mail should go. Please forward it to everyone you think is
     interested (and I mean qualified people that know the
     (dis)advantages as well) so we can come up with something.

     I really hope you will write me back. I'm going to prepare the work
     I've been thinking about for the last several months. I hope that I
     will get the support I need.

     Thanks Doug,
     Derrick

     Editor's Reply:  Derrick, I don't know whether you sent this to the
     wrong person or not.  In a sense, I may be wrong because I'm a poor
     innovator.  Oh, I've made my contributions to BBSing; I'm a decent
     conversationalist and a competent administrator.  But it's always
     been people like you who have moved and shaken and brought about
     change.  For my part, I'll post this excellent visionary comment on
     my editorial in hopes that your fellow visionaries see it and help
     you shape the future of Fido.

              Email from Chris R. Evans <teknopup@bigvalley.net>

     Thanks man for taking the hard edge and saying it like it is !

     BUT one thing BBSes have that the internet doesnt seem to have
     readily available to all is FREE access..  Yes, there are/were bbses
     that charged for access but even then they had non paying time
     limited accounts which ISPs no not have.  We as a Network have to
     reinvent BBSing to attact the masses, but with the cost of ISP
     administration and setup so sky high (eg $33K minimum) its is really
     impossible for the hobbist sysop to do that.

     Also, another things that doesnt help our plight, is that local
     computer 'zines (like CCN) dropped the BBS list, in favor of the ISP
     directory (which is really small and lame), if they allow the BBS
     FIDONEWS 17-19               Page 8                    8 May 2000


     list to come back eg published so ppl know of our bbses, then we'd
     get more callers.

     Editor:

     I don't really know if I said it like it is.  My prognostication has
     always been weakest where the future is concerned...

     We've got to seperate two factors here... what the "user" pays and
     what the "provider" pays.  Someone just using the web in the US
     usually pays $20 or less a month for the access, and most think no
     more of it than the basic charges for their telephone.  Once the ISP
     fee is discounted, the whole internet is essentially free.

     Certainly someone wishing to be an ISP is in for substantial
     expenses... but that's not the only way to establish a web presence.
     Peple are putting up home pages for practically nothing... and the
     home pages are technically more sophisticated than the early BBSes.
     Live sysop chat is tough to manage with a home page, but what other
     BBS function can't be managed?

     There may be some tactics beyond my ken right now which would
     attract users to bbses, but I don't think it's simply a matter of
     letting them know we're out there.  Six years ago, everyone knew we
     were out there, and they still chose to migrate to the web.

     Hmm...  if a rule excluding nineteen-year-old's had been in effect
     in the 1980's, then there would have been no Fido boards in Boston,
     Massachusetts, U.S.A. .  At the time of the release of the IBM PC,
     the Boston Computer Society was running Ward Christensen's RBBS
     package.  It was a nineteen year old M.I.T. freshman named Buzz
     Moschetti who got FidoNET off the ground in Boston by running The
     Buzz Board Fido.  When the Boston Computer Society was told about
     message networking, they replied that their members came to them,
     calling their boards, and that they didn't need to send their
     messages out to their members.  It took almost a year of arguing
     before they finally saw any advantage to echomail (such as linking

     their Pioneer Valley Computer Club UMASS University club and their
     New Hampshire and Rhode Island chapters to their Boston boards).
     One of the top Macintosh sysops of Boston -- Zeff Wheelock --
     started as a sysop when he was tweleve years old, and many of the
     famous early TBBS TRS-80 boards, such as Milliways TBBS of Concord,
     Massachusetts, U.S.A., were started by fourteen year old high school
     freshmen.  If you took away the teenage sysop, fully two-thirds of
     the B.B.S.es founded in Boston, Massachusetts in the early 1980's
     would have never been started!

                         Creator of PKZip Dies at 37
          From ZDNet News as posted by Steven Horn (1:17/67) in Z1C


     Creator of PKZip dies at 37
     Phillip W. Katz led an apparently troubled life -- but invented one
     of the most used utility programs in computing.
     Robert Lemos
     04/24/00


     Phillip W. Katz, creator of the popular PKZip compression utility,
     has died. He was 37. A PKWare Inc. representative confirmed an AP
     report, but declined further comment.

     Katz, who died of complications from chronic alcoholism, was found
     dead April 14 in a Milwaukee, Wis. motel room with several bottles
     of alcohol, said the article, quoting a county medical examiner's
     report on Monday.

     While leading a problematic personal life, Katz created one of the
     most used utilities on the Web. The compression utility PKZip
     enjoyed enormous popularity, with the latest two versions racking up
     more than 600,000 downloads on ZDNet.

     PKZip shrinks files by more than half, allowing data transmission
     speeds to be doubled.

                             This Weeks Web Page
                                by Frank Vest
                                1:124/6308(.1)

     What: SkyNET BBS

     Where: http://www.multimania.com/skynetbbs

     I really don't know where to begin! I stumbled onto this page and to
     say I'm humbled would be an understatement.

     <regrouping here>

     Let's start at the top.  When you first hit this page, look in the
     upper right hand corner. You'll see options for [Netherlands ]
     [English ] [ Francais ] [ Deutsch ]. Choose the language of your
     choice. The default language seems to be Netherlands<sp?>. I, of
     course, choose English.

     This site uses "frames". I'm not overly fond of frames, but for the
     information available here it seems to work very well. The main page
     (frame) tells about the page and gives information on the BBS. I'm
     not going to "cut & paste" any of it because there are too many
     other points of interest to talk about.

     Steven Leeman is the Sysop of SkyNET. To say he spent "some" time on
     this site might not be true. To say he spent his life on this site
     might be closer. :)

     I'm really lost on this page. On the left side is a menu. it reads
     as follows:

     --- Cut ---

       Screenshots
       Points & Photo's
       Technical Info
       Statistics
       Fidonet???
       Fido via IP
       Downloads
       Setup:
         FD/APX
         F.I.P.S.
         Terminate
         WinPoint 95
       Messageboard
       Distributed.net
       Belgian BBS List
       Mail SkyNET

     --- Cut ---

     This is but a small part of what is here. Start at the top of this
     menu and go through it all. Be warned, you'll need some time. The
     one thing, if there is such, that I liked is what appears to be a

     meeting of the Point Systems that Steven supports. It looks like a
     Net meeting of sorts where they get together, talk and have a good
     time. I like that idea. :) I also like the support for Point that is
     given here. The "How to" of setting it up and such is great!.

     Ok... I'm gonna stop here. To tell all that is on this site would
     take all of the average Fidonews article size and still be lacking.
     Drop by this page and see what it's about. Lots of time and effort
     have been put in here.
