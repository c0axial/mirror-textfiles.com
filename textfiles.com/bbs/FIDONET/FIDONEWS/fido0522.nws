     Those of you still sitting on the fence about attending this
     year's FidoCon in Cincinnati lend me your ears (eyes in this
     case).

     [guilt trip on] [tongue in cheek]

     Here we sit in Cincinnati working ourselves way too hard planing
     for the BEST conference this group has ever seen...  and for
     what!  Where are the registrations?  Where's the commitment from
     our FidoNet compatriots?  I see people in echos talking about how
     this, that or another thing can be resolved at FidoCon.  Frankly
     I don't know how anything can be resolved if no one shows.  50
     vendors are going to have a great time talking to 20 attendees!

     At least I know I have a one in twenty chance of winning the
     airline ticket we are giving away!

     wait....hmmm.... on second thought don't register... don't come!
     I have that much more likelihood of winning one of the modems
     too!  hehehe this is great... I could use another modem and a
     trip to California...... bye.


     [tongue out of cheek] [guilt trip off]

     See you here in August.

     Claude Witherspoon
     Fido 100/525

           Kids Echo Conference and the KidsNews NewsLetter

     I  got  aquainted  with  the computer field about a year ago
     while serving this great nation with a career  in  the  U.S.
     Army  at  an  aviation unit. I was at my desk minding my own
     buisness when this little guy with a big truck dropped three
     Zenith Z-248's in front of my  desk.  I  had  never  seen  a
     computer up close till then.

     The   computers   sat   there   for   a  few  days  awaiting
     instructions. Finally, my curiosity getting the best of  me,
     we decided to pull them out of the box. They were impressive
     in  relation  to  the  old  typewriter.  I  dug through some
     manuels and found an operators  book  and  finally  got  the
     things  plugged  in  and  making  noises.  One  thing led to
     another and I found that I was not watching the clock like I
     used to do. I began to get home later and later each  night.
     This  continued for months. Each day something new would pop
     up on the screen. Then one day it  happened.  I  learned  to
     operate the modem!... I was really hooked then.

     My  brother,  Paul  Witherspoon,  who  is  also my technical
     advisor, took me by the hand  one  day  and  showed  me  the
     wonderful  world  of the Bulletin Board System. I knew right
     then that I  was  a  goner.  I  began  to  ask  millions  of
     questions about the possible use of these bulletin boards. I
     began driving my brother crazy with my innocent curiosity of
     what these things could do and what "I" could make them  do.
     While  all  this  was going on, I was constantly proding  my
     entire family with the thoughts of a home system of our own.
     Once  the  kids  were  involved with the games, it wasn't to
     hard to convince "Moma" (Instant sitter, ah ha!).

     That day finally happened and things  started  going  pretty
     fast  then.  We  got  a Net/Node number which is like seeing
     your name in the phone book. Your somebody now!...  Our  new
     system was a joy to behold. Loaded with a BBS.

     Time  went  on and I noticed the children were always on the
     computer when I would  arrive  home.  They  were  constantly
     burried  in  one  game or the other and just as excited as I
     was when I started. They were very  forceful  in  their  joy
     about  their  new  discoveries. Much like I was. I noticed a
     little of myself in what they were doing. This led me to the
     thoughts of possibly letting the kids run the  BBS.  Then  a
     kids  area  was  developed  and  the  more  I  spoke with my
     brother, the more things started to grow. I got my daughter,
     Brandy  Witherspoon,  involved  in  publishing  a   KidsNews
     Newsletter  all on her own. This started to take on more and
     more shape as time passed. Contributions to  the  newsletter
     were  sent  in  and  published  with  recognition to the the
     sender. Also, birthdays and special  events  went  into  the
     newsletter.  Kids  and adults were requesting the newsletter
     FidoNews 5-22                Page 3                   30 May 1988


     through messages in the echo. Distribution was very  limited
     due  to  the audience which it was targeted for and the lack
     of  knowledge  on  my  part  on  exactly  how  to   get   it
     distributed. Still have problems there!...

     One  day I was reading through my messages and there was one
     from Don Daniels, President  of  the  International  FidoNet
     Association, Melville, NY. He informed me of IFNA's interest
     in  promoting  the use of FidoNet for various endeavors that
     should accrue to the common good of  mankind.  He  suggested
     that I contact David Drexler, Net/Node  147/1,  to  possibly
     combine  our  efforts  with  what  David  was doing with the
     "International Pen Pals". I checked with my brother and  off
     the  message  went. David answered and was very pleased that
     someone else shared his interest in the children. David also
     mentioned  a  possible  connection  to Australia through the
     Telenet.  This  may  be  a  reality  sometime in the future?
     Somewhere in California there is a connection to  Australia.
     David, your a saint. Please continue with us and we can rest
     assured  that computing and children can lead us to a future
     of unlimited possibility.

     The  KIDS  Echo  Conference is now on the Region 19 Backbone
     run  by  Tony Davis, 147/9, in Oklahoma City. So look for it
     to be a developing concept with  International  interest.  I
     would  like to thank all those involved with the development
     of a tool to insure this  great nation's  growth through our
     children.  I feel certain that the best interest of our kids
     is being looked after through your efforts. The kids may not
     say  it  sometimes. But we can see it through thier eyes and
     actions. They too are pleased with you.

     I plan to write future articles if this one is accepted with
     the kids best interest in mind. I will also keep you updated
     on  the  growth  of  the  KIDS  Echo  either  through   this
     newsletter  or  the kids newsletter. Thanks for your time in
     reading this. My kids thank  you  also.  Hopefully  we  have
     generated a spark of interest in what the echo is all about.

     Edward Hawes
     Fast-BBS 106/132

     I wanted to let all sysops know about our new CHESSLINE
     system available for bbs operations.  The ChessLine will give
     your BBS that extra feature which will attract the kind of users
     you want.  Do you ever get tired of seeing users call in, skim
     the message base, then go to the files section?  The ChessLine
     makes your board more interesting by giving them something else
     to do.  Chess has been around for centuries, and unlike other
     past times, has not been harmed by the computer age.  In fact,
     have you ever noticed that of the people you know who are
     interested in computers, probably more of them play chess than do
     not?  While the game does not require a genius to play, it does
     attract people who are at least interested in exercising their
     intellectual dexterity.  This is a prerequisite to personal
     computing and goes hand in hand with the users of a bulletin
     board system.

     The ChessLine operates in a fashion similar to 'postal chess'. A
     user will call your BBS, enter The ChessLine, make his move, and
     exit.  His opponent will call later, enter The ChessLine, make
     his move, and then exit.  What makes The ChessLine more
     interesting than postal chess is that you don't have to wait on
     the US mail.  The ChessLine will store all moves and when your
     user calls, will set up an on-screen chessboard with the last
     played position shown.  All moves entered are checked for their
     legality, as The ChessLine will permit no illegal moves.  All
     legal moves including castling, enpassents, and pawn promotions
     are allowed.  The ChessLine will terminate the game as soon as
     one player check-mates the other or if the game becomes
     stalemated or a player resigns.

     We have also added some other options to Chesline for you and
     your users enjoyment :
     1.. The ability to leave short comments to the other player
     2.. Sysop chat mode (with auto word-wrap)
     3.. Sysop online play with user
     4.. Netmail play (see Netmail doc's)
     5.. List of all moves
     6.. The ability to take back moves
     7.. View other games in progress
     8.. Online Help

     FUTURE ADDITIONS (Already under developement)
     1.. U.S. CHESS Federation ranking system..
     2.. Node to Node interactive play..

     CLMAIL.EXE
     This utility is the most exciting aspect of Chesline.. Clmail is
     the Net-mail utility that will send moves to any board
     in the E-Mail Network that has ChessLine installed.
     Let me explain. You see Clmail creates a outbound
     message with the record enclosed.. So if you wanted to play a
     game with a user in Washington D.C.,you make your move and clmail
     will send it across the wire to the Node in Washington then the
     FidoNews 5-22                Page 5                   30 May 1988


     move applied to chesline on that board.. The next day the user in
     Washington would send his move to your board through Clmail
     and so on and so on... Now that i have you confuzed
     lets make it worse... Say you have 20 games going on and
     3 of them are network games to 3 different nodes,
     Clmail will automatically create the outbound messages with the
     node numbers there going to. (Have I got your attention?)
     This is a great concept because you can now play National Chess
     without having to call another board with procomm or whatever
     and sign on and go through lond distance networks just to
     make a move.. Now with CLmail you make all your moves
     locally and your mail system handles the rest..(NEAT HUH?)
     We are presently working on a player list utility that will list
     all Chessline players nationally and rank them according to
     U.S. Chess Federation rules and regulations then create a
     listing that will be distributed to all Chesline nodes so the
     users can select by player and ranking!! (Exciting HUH?)
     Well Im sure you can see how this could grow into a Chess Net!
     We are very excited about the possibilities this could bring...
     The program Clmail was written by James Brown at Brown BBS in
     Houston. Many Thanks to his hard work and dedication to the
     expansion of Chesline and the idea for the Net-Mail application.
     This concept has broken new ground in the E-mail Network and
     blazed a new path for bbs games..
                 THANKS James Brown.. WE APPRECIATE THE WORK!!

     Notes:

     Chesline is a very high quality program designed with the sysop
     in mind.  It is written in assembler and uses ansi graphics for
     the display.  It also uses RAM for file processing so the speed
     is kept to a maximum.  It monitors the carrier and has it's own
     ansi interpreter so you don't have to load ansi.sys and you can
     still see everything on your screen that the user sees. It will
     allow a max of 200 games and is set up to run under multiple
     nodes. It will automatically get the user's name and will run at
     2400/1200/300 even 9600 baud. Thise version will have the
     ability  for the sysop to play online with user and has a
     chat mode as well.

     This program was specifically designed for opus but will run
     on PCBoard,Quik-BBS,GTPowercomm,RBBS.

                       Networking
            What the hell is it, and what's in it for me?
                      By David Rice
                      (1:103/506.0)
                      714-662-2294


               The  LAN  (Local  Area Network) is currently one of the
     fastest growing computer products in the  business  world  today.
     In  1987  the  Office  Computing  Group  (one  of  the  first  to
     mass-market Net products) installed 420,000 LANs,  75%  of  which
     were in  the  United  States.  There are currently plans to place
     another 400,000 in 1988.  The  conservative  estimate  stands  at
     over  3,000,000  PCs  currently  connected  to  LANs  in the U.S.
     business world.  Latest forecasts  expect  from  40%  to  60%  of
     business  in  the  U.S.  will  have  some  sort of LAN set up and
     running by 1992.

               But what's a  LAN?  A  LAN  (Local  Area  Network)  can
     include anything (and everything) from a large collection of dumb
     terminals  hooked  up  to a controller via interfaces, to massive
     mainframe corporate computers sharing a common data base.

               For our purposes I will define a LAN as a collection of
     PCs in an office (or home) environment,  all  connected  together
     over  high-speed  cables  for  the sole purpose of sharing common
     equipment, data bases, and message  bases.    These  devices  may
     include  printers,  hard (or floppy) disk drives, specified paths
     on a  specified  drive,  and  even  modems.    The   methods   of
     accomplishing these tasks are many and varied.

               Since  there  are so many different types of commercial
     hardware and software to set up a LAN, I will have to limit  this
     article  to  the  "Big  Three", with side mentions of the Biggest
     Fourth, which is the most common.  Why I'm  not  going  to  cover
     this most common LAN will become apparent later on.  First I will
     cover the major TYPES of LANs.

               The   first   type  of  LAN  to  arrive,  from  "Corvus
     Constellation and Nestar Systems" in 1979 was/is what's known  as
     a "Linear  Bus Topology."  That is, a main cable ("Bus Cable") is
     routed from one end of the building to the other, with the  "Work
     Stations"  (more  about  them later) hooked up by just dropping a
     line from this Bus to the "Network Interface Card" (NIC)  in  the
     PC. The Following Figure 1 is an example of Linear Bus.

               With  this  configuration, each Work Station listens to
     the main bus line, waiting for something addressed to it to  come
     along.  When the Work Station discovers that the bus is quiet, it
     may  make  a request by introducing information to this bus line.
     For instance, Work Station 1 may want a file  from  Work  Station
     2's hard disk.  Work station 2 will be listening to the bus line,
     as well  as  Work  Station 1.  When Work Station 1 hears that the
     bus is quiet, it sends a message to Work Station 2  saying  "Send
     Me ORGY.EXE"  please.    Since  all  the  WS  (Work Stations) are
     listening, WS 2 will see that the message was meant for  it,  and
     FidoNews 5-22                Page 7                   30 May 1988


     if the passwords are correct, it will send the file.

               What  if  two  or more WS attempt to use the bus at the
     same time?  A collision occurs.  This is why this type of LAN  is
     called a  "Contention" type.  When the bus is contended, both WSs
     wait a random number of nanoseconds and then try again.

               The well known, and excellent LAN, "Ethernet"  is  this
     type  of  LAN.  The Ethernet is very fast, at 10,000,000 Bits Per
     Second data transmission. "StarLAN" is also this kind of LAN, and
     it runs at 1,000,000 BPS.

               We'll call Ethernet Top 1, as it is  one  of  the  best
     sellers of Net products.

               The  second  topology is called "Star Wire Ring," as it
     has a common "file  server"  at  the  center,  with  multiple  WS
     running off  of it.  Novelle NetWare uses this topology under the
     ArcNet Protocol, which runs at 2,500,000 BPS. ArcNet is very easy
     to set up and run, uses coax, and is low cost ($250 approximately
     per NIC (Network Interface Card)).  We'll call this Top 2.

               No doubt you have heard of the third best-seller.   IBM
     Token  Ring  uses the Token Passing Protocol, under the Star Wire
     Ring or Distributed Star topology. "Ring" means that, unlike  the
     bus  cable  that  terminates  at  both  ends,  the  main cable is
     connected in a circle, with the WS  connected  parallel  to  this
     main ring.

               The ring  is  quite  different than the bus method.  As
     the bus method, each WS listens in on the  ring,  but  one  at  a
     time!   What  happens is that the file server passes a "Token" to
     one WS. That is, the server says "Ok, Work Station  1,  you  have
     the Token.    What,  if  anything,  would you like to do with the
     network?"  If WS 1 doesn't have  anything  it  wants  to  do,  IT
     PASSES  THE TOKEN to WS 2, and it is now up to WS 2 to figure out
     if it wants to do anything on the net.  If not, it in turn passes
     the Token.  This way, each WS waits its turn, and collisions  are
     not possible.    The IBM Token Ring Network runs at 4,000,000 BPS
     and is high cost.  A connector alone costs $25.00, with  the  NIC
     around $450.   The cable connecting the NIC to the wall connector
     costs $79.90 when I called IBM. The prices WILL be lower  if  one
     buys from a distributor instead of IBM directly.

               However,   IBM   Token  Ring  is  very  dependable  and
     predictable.  It uses "Type 1"  cable,  which  is  two  pairs  of
     twisted 12  gauge  solid  wire, in a sturdy casing.  Each pair is
     tied together, so in essence the cable is  "two  conductor"  even
     though there  are four wires in it.  This double duty makes it an
     excellent problem-free cabling system, though an  expensive  one.
     The  Token Ring Connectors are gender-generic (a term I just made
     up), in that there is no male or female.   Every  connector  will
     plug into  every  other  connector.  The money you save on gender
     changers you will spend on these damn connectors (!) but they are
     very handy and extremely reliable.

               Coax  cable  systems  can   handle   very   high   data
     transmission speeds, which is why Ethernet uses Coax.  There is a
     problem  with  some  coax,  as  it  may  not meet the fire safety
     standards in some areas.  Whoever installs the coax had damn well
     better know ahead of time.  Burning coax can be deadly.  The nice
     thing about the older version of Ethernet is that they use  their
     own  cable,  as  IBM does, and it meets fire safety standards and
     exceeds them in some specs.  The cable of Ethernet,  however,  is
     thick, bright yellow, and a swatting pain in the ass to lay down!
     Coax  cables  may be terminated very cheaply, but the reliability
     is subject to wild fluctuations depending on how you do it.

               There are coax connectors that just screw on, after the
     installer strips back the jacket to expose the  shield  and  cuts
     back the   center   tap.    These  should  be  avoided,  but  are
     serviceable.  That is, if it were MY Net, I'd  shoot  the  person
     who hands them to me.  They work fine, true, but just yank on the
     cable, or  look  at  it  mean-like,  and  see  what  happens!  My
     suggestion is that if one (perhaps you) are using these, set up a
     schedule to re-terminate them one at a time.  It doesn't need  to
     be done  all  at  once,  that  is.    Please  note that this is a
     personal opinion.

               The better coax connector will crimp  on.    I  suggest
     again  that  the  right  tool be used for the job, so invest in a
     REAL coax stripper.  These will usually remove  the  jacket,  cut
     the  shield, and expose the center tap, all to desired dimentions
     (!) all at the same time.  If you are using coax, you owe  it  to
     yourself,  and  the  person  paying  for your time, to get one of
     these strippers!  At $100 to $135, the time you  save  will  very
     quickly pay  for the cost of the stripper.  This one tool will do
     more for making a reliable coax  based  LAN  than  any  secondary
     component.   A sharp knife is what I used to use, and though this
     method works fine, I'd fire any employee I saw  using  it.    How
     much is  your  employee's  fingers worth to you?  Please, get the
     right tool.


          There are many coax crimpers available.  AMP sells excellent
     ones.  The crimper MUST be for the right "class" of coax.   Using
     a  type  1  crimper on a type 2 coax cable won't work well, if at
     all.

               That said, I will mention that there is a third type of
     LAN. This is called RS-232c or "Zero Slot LANs."  That is, it  is
     a software package that runs the comports on your PC as if it was
     an  NIC.  A very good, cheep LAN of this sort is made by EasyLAN,
     which supports from 2 to 18 users, runs at 19,200 baud  on  a  PC
     and  56,000  baud on an AT. The price for two users is $220, with
     an additional $120 for each additional user.

               The Zero Slot LAN is excellent for home use, though  it
     may be  very  good  in  the business environment.  If you wish to
     hook up your two computers at home together,  as  in  hooking  up
     your  bulletin  board on the kitchen table to the PC in the study
     to use the study computer's hard disk for more storage, this is a
     FidoNews 5-22                Page 9                   30 May 1988


     very low cost way of doing so.  At 19,200 baud it may take awhile
     to transfer the proper file from the study to the BBS,  but  what
     the heck?    The user is running at 2,400 baud any ways so she/he
     isn't waiting for your LAN to catch up!

               If 19,200 baud isn't fast enough for  you,  that's  ok,
     too.  For $149.50 per work station you may get 115,200 BPS for up
     to 6  work  stations.  This is from Knowledge Network, and may be
     ideal for the home, or in the small  office  environment.    This
     system  is  perfectly serviceable, cheep, and easy to set up, but
     compared to the NIC based LANs, the speed is crippling.

               The Zero Slot LAN is the lowest cost  one.    It  is  a
     Contention type LAN.

               LANs encourage   sharing   and   communication.    Many
     businesses have standard operating  procedures  (SOPs)  that  one
     must follow  to  be  productive  in  their  environment.  The LAN
     forces the user to follow set procedures for every user, with  no
     excuses.   The  Vice President must follow the same SOPs as every
     person who uses the LAN, so the rouge  employees  who  insist  on
     using  Word Star when MultiMate is the corporate standard, or the
     employees who use DbaseIII when everyone else wants the files  in
     R:Base  System  V,  will have to bear the responsibility to learn
     the standards set by Those Who Rule.   That's  tough,  guys,  but
     productivity  is  the  issue,  and  after  all  the employee will
     benefit by the extra training.

               Most LANs support a user message base, where every user
     may communicate with any and every other user.  The  manager  who
     broadcasts  a  message  to  her/his  supervisors can get feedback
     immediately.  Some users may abuse this by passing  jokes,  dirty
     gossip, and  hate  mail.  They must remember that the LAN manager
     may have a message log running, and that anything  they  say  can
     and will  be held against them.  That means you should send stuff
     like "The boss is a real great guy, ain't he?" to  a  dummy  work
     station, so  that  the  boss will think highly of you.  The dummy
     work station is so that no one else reads your message and thinks
     your a butt-kissing clown.

               Many software development houses offer LAN  version  of
     their single-user  products.    Lotus  1-2-3 is a good example of
     this.  Word Perfect also provides this.  Expect to pay  more  for
     the LAN version than the single-user version, and you may have to
     pay a  licence  fee for every user who uses the LAN version.  Few
     offer site licences.

               The LAN Version is important, as they check the  status
     of files  before  they  access  them.   One may use a single-user
     version of Lotus 1-2-3 on the net, but what happens if two  users
     are running  1-2-3 and want the same file?  When the smoke clears
     you'll see a three-foot crater where your file server used to  be
     (i.e. a missing or corrupt file).  Heads will roll, and the Lotus
     Development Corporation WILL have you tossed in jail.

               The  way  around this problem is called "File Locking."
     FidoNews 5-22                Page 10                  30 May 1988


     The LAN version of  the  application  software  will  "lock"  the
     currently reading  file,  and  no one else may use it.  The whole
     file may be locked, or just parts of it.  R:Base  System  V  will
     lock records,  but  not the whole data file.  Lotus will lock the
     whole spreadsheet, and no one may use it until the first user  is
     finished with it.

               Version  3.0 and 4.0 of Microsoft's QuickBASIC supports
     file locking!  If one opens a file for Read,  Write,  or  Random,
     all or  parts  of  that  file may be locked.  The software author
     does not have to program around the locking  problem,  therefore,
     because QuickBASIC  handles  that  problem!   That's why my Space
     Battle  game  for  our  network  at  work  is  being  written  in
     QuickBASIC.

               There are   two   types   of   LANs.     The  first  is
     "peer-to-peer," and the second is "file-server-based."

               Peer-to-peer.  As the name implies, each and every work
     station is considered equal.  One may  share  devices  freely  or
     not, as  the  user  wishes.  If the LAN manager approves, one may
     share one's hard disk files with anyone, and one  may  get  files
     from  any  other  WS.  This  method  requires  that  each  WS  be
     individually configured.

               File-server-based LANs use a central file  base,  which
     other WS use to store and retrieve files.  All workstations slave
     to the  file  server.    This  is  great for standardizing files,
     schedules, and memos, as there is only one copy of the  document,
     file, or  what-have-you at one time.  If one trashes a file, head
     will roll, and the blood will run freely through the halls.

               Back up your LAN. If  you  have  a  file  server  based
     system, this  is  a  must, as every WS DEPENDS on the server.  If
     peer-to-peer, a trashed file isn't as major a problem.

               Some networks will run over existing  telephone  lines.
     The  phone  lines  installed  in most businesses have from 4 to 6
     connectors, but only two are used.  The other wires may  be  used
     for the  network.   Think of the money saved by not buying cable,
     and not having to route it through the building!  The  VAX  often
     uses this method.

               Cabling distance is a consideration.  Every cable has a
     maximum range  it may be run before it requires a bootster.  It's
     about 4,000 feet for coax, and perhaps  3,000  for  IBM  Type  1.
     Check the  manufacturer  before you buy.  This is very important,
     as the type of cable and the distances involved will tell you  if
     a repeater is required.

               Never run a memory resident program on the file server.
     That's just  asking  for  trouble.   Remember to protect the file
     server first, as it's an important link (the most)  in  the  LAN.
     This includes a battery backup system in case of power failure.

               With many users using the same hard disk, the hard disk
     FidoNews 5-22                Page 11                  30 May 1988


     on the  file  server  will require defragmenting now and then.  A
     few Networking program will  perform  this  function  during  lax
     (idle) time!    Otherwise,  there  are many programs available to
     "optimize" the hard disk  for  you.    Remember  that  many  copy
     protection  schemes  resort  to  terrorist  tactics,  and  if you
     optimize  a  hard  disk  after  installing  this  software,  this
     software may  not  run!   Examples are Lotus 1-2-3, Chart Master,
     Map Master, Sign Master, Harvard Total Project Manager,  just  to
     name a very few.

               There  are  several  ways to connect two LANs together.
     One is called a "bridge," which connects two like LANs.  That is,
     connecting two Token Ring Nets, or two Ethernets.

               A "Router" will connect two LANs with  similar  network
     level protocols, but differing informational packet formats.

               The  "Gateway"  will connect just about any kind of LAN
     to just about any other.  It is extremely costly, though.

               The following is some information you may wish to  look
     into if you plan on starting a LAN.

               EasyLAN, mentioned above.  Phone (408) 738-8377.  Their
     package is  Zero  Slot LAN type, through the comports.  Currently
     supports from 2 to 18 users.

               Knowledge Network.  Supports up to 6 users, phone (408)
     739-6800.

               3+ is supplied by 3Com, from Mountain View, California.
     The price is around $900.00 for from 1 to  5  users,  and  around
     $1800 for unlimited  users.    It  is file-server-based.  NICs it
     supports  are  3Com  Ethernet,  IBM  Token  Ring,  StarLAN,   and
     Appletalk.

               VINES  &  VINES/286, by Banyan Systems in Westboro, MA.
     Suggested price is $1,895.00 per file server.  NICs supported are
     IBM Token Ring, 3Com Ethernet, SMC ArcNet, Proteon Pronet, Corvus
     Omninet, and others.  It is a very good system,  but  limited  in
     RAM accessing.

               PC Network  Program by IBM, Armonk Yew York.  The price
     is $125 per user and requires 3.1 DOS or higher.  It supports the
     IBM Token Ring Adapter NIC only.

               As far as I know, the IBM Token Ring Adapter  NIC  will
     NOT work with the OS/2 model 50 or higher.

               Oh.  The  single  most  common  LAN in use today?  It's
     called "Sneakernet," where one puts on a  good  pair  of  running
     sneakers,  picks up a floppy, and carries it to another PC. It is
     the cheapest LAN available to date, and presumably the slowest.

                    NODELIST Crisis -- Past, or Coming?
                           by Ben Baker -- 44/76



          I'm sure  most of  you are  aware of the recent minor crisis
     with the FidoNet nodelist.  Let me first explain what happened.

          In order  to generate  a difference  file, MakeNL must first
     perform an  analytic comparison  of last  week's nodelist and the
     one it  just created.   Traditional programs to perform this task
     have been  notoriously slow  because of  the inordinate amount of
     I/O required  to resynchronize  the input files once a difference
     has been  detected.   MakeNL uses an algorithm which allows it to
     resynchronize in  memory, without performing any I/O, thus speed-
     ing the  process significantly.  But when an algorithm depends on
     a limited  resource, such as system memory, the limits of the re-
     source translate to limits on the algorithm.

          Two bad  assumptions conspired  to precipitate the "crisis."
     I thought  MakeNL's difference  analyzer was  limited to  between
     9,000 and  10,000 lines  of input,  or more  than 4,500 lines per
     file.   And I  was not  keeping close track of the nodelist size,
     but thought  it was  around 3,500  lines, yielding  about  a  25%
     safety factor.   Actually , the two numbers collided at just over
     4,000 lines!   And  at a time when another "minor crisis" was oc-
     curring with another of my utilities!  "When it rains. . ."

          Version 2.11  of MakeNL has now been released which corrects
     the problem  by dividing  large input files into segments of man-
     ageable size  and analyzing  differences of the segments indepen-
     dently.   Some clever  (if I do say so myself) resynchronizing of
     the segment  boundaries in  the input files results in difference
     files of  near optimum  size.  From the point of view of MakeNL's
     difference analyzer  at least, nodelists may now grow arbitrarily
     large!

          As an  aside, while  working on  the difference  analyzer, I
     discovered a  benign, but  annoying bug  which can, under unusual
     conditions, cause unnecessarily and unreasonably large difference
     files to  be generated.   (Take  a close  look at the back end of
     NODEDIFF.134.)   While only  ZCs need  the  correction  described
     above right away, this bug could affect ALL MakeNL users who pro-
     duce difference  files.   For that  reason, I recommend all users
     update to V2.11.

          Thus, the present "nodelist crisis" has been put to bed, but
     as my  title suggests, there is another on the horizon.  Consider
     this.   In April,  1985 (was  it really only three years ago?!) a
     group of  us met in St. Louis to resolve another nodelist crisis.
     An assignment freeze was artificially holding the number of nodes
     at about  250.   We solved  the problem, TJ modified Fido, we re-
     leased the  freeze, and  by August we had doubled our size to 500
     or so.

          The following  August (1986)  we  met  at  Silicon  Mountain
     FidoNews 5-22                Page 13                  30 May 1988


     FidoCon, facing another crisis.  We had some 1,000 nodes and were
     rapidly approaching Fido's 1,200 node limit.  Last August the net
     stood 2,000  strong(?) and I forget which software had just hit a
     limit.

          By the  time we  get to Cincinnati this August, the net will
     probably have  passed the 4,000 node mark.  Notice the pattern --
     500, 1,000,  2,000, 4,000!  With tens of millions of PCs and hun-
     dreds of  millions of phone lines in America alone, I see no rea-

     son for  the growth rate to slow, so by extrapolation, in August,
     1990 we  can expect  FidoNet to  have around  16,000  nodes,  the
     nodelist will  be about  1.25 megabytes  BIG, and  the difference
     file will be running in excess of a hundred kilobytes!

          Now, let's  play some  number games.   To keep current, each
     node must receive each difference file exactly once.  Assume that
     in 1990,  6,000 nodes can arrange to do that at 9600 baud and the
     rest support  2400 baud.   6,000  * 2.5  + 10,000 * 10 is 115,000
     minutes or  1,917*4 hours  or 80 days of connect time, much of it
     toll, just  to distribute  nodelist updates  EVERY WEEK. Assuming
     50% toll  time at  ROA rates, that's more than $7,500.  No wonder
     AT&T likes  FidoNet!  Now, let's assume that each system, once it
     gets the  difference file, spends an average twenty minutes doing
     nodelist processing.  That's 5,333.33  hours, or  222.22 days, or
     over seven  months of  computer time.  That translates to several
     days of 3080 time.  Got any idea how much that would cost?

          Did these  stats startle  you?  Did I get your attention?  I
     hope so.   Folks,  we do indeed have a looming crisis!  It is un-
     likely, but  there may  actually be  network software  out  there
     which, through  clever design,  has no systematic limits, but all
     software is  limited by  the availability  of resources it relies
     on; time,  memory and  disk space.   The  burgeoning nodelist  is
     straining all three.

          A recent FidoNews article "proposed" a first step toward the
     "phone book" concept Thom Henderson has been championing for more
     than a  year.  Jeff Sheese would have the nodelist distributed as
     separate zone  lists.  I would suggest an immediate, more radical
     shift to region lists.  It would permit operators of smaller sys-
     tems with  modest communications  needs to  pick and  choose only
     what is needed.  But even that does not solve the (not very) long
     term problem.

          The "fully  coupled" network,  in which the software at each
     node has full knowledge of all other nodes, is a good concept for
     small networks.   But  far from  being the necessity Tom Jennings
     insists it is, it is fast becoming a luxury we can't afford.  For
     FidoNet to survive exponential growth, it MUST become a decoupled
     network.   To achieve that end, software will have to change -- a
     lot of  software.   The fundamental concept of network addressing
     is involved  here.  And the software will have to change in a co-
     ordinated manner.   The  sooner, the better!  If you think a mas-
     sive update  of 4,000  nodes running  at least six different mail
     servers will  be traumatic, imagine the trauma of updating 16,000

     nodes and perhaps twenty mail servers!

          I appeal  to the  netware developers.   FidoNet's  growth is
     setting your  priorities for you.  At this time it is not too im-
     portant how  you connect  reply chains or adjust seen-bys in echo
     mail.  Nor do the relative elegance or utility of Wazoo vs. Bark,
     or Zmodem vs. SEAlink matter very much.  We must first figure out
     how to handle growth gracefully, or it may all simply collapse.

          I appeal  to the  net administrators.  FidoNet's growth will
     inevitably place  increasing pressures on you, and let's face it,
     the pay  is not  that good.   Yours  is the role of the coxswain.
     You must  provide the  leadership to  get us techies stroking to-
     gether, and in the right direction.

          Finally, I  appeal to  all sysops.   FidoNet's growth is, in
     the final  analysis, your  problem.  It will become more and more
     difficult, and  require more  and more  of your time to operate a
     FidoNet system.  Believe me -- without change, in another year or
     so, you  will be seriously considering giving it up.  I'd hate to

     see that happen.  What can you do?  Gentle (or if necessary, not-
     so-gentle) pressure  from you  will help  get your administrators
     off their duffs and us techies off TDC!

          The shoes  are starting  to pinch.  Let's find a replacement
     for them before they become crippling.

     Fido 301/1
     High Mesa Ranger's

                        Does your Hair Stand On End

     If  your hair stands on end it may not be because you are afraid,
     it  may be because of high static electricity in your  area.   In
     the past few weeks,  I have experienced several problems  related
     to this.  After moving to New Mexico in early February, I started
     noticing  when  I  touched the light switch I would  get  a  mild
     shock.  Knowing this was caused by low humidity, I purchased some
     static guard.  Which helped a little.

     Then  the morning of 25 April,  after having worked all night,  I
     came back into the house,  and turned on the monitor.   Well  for
     some  reason  it did not want to come on.   So being the kind  of
     person  who figures he can fix anything that is broken if  it  is
     simple enough,  I opened the case on the monitor, and in a matter
     of  minutes  had  parts  scattered all over the  counter  of  the
     cabinet.

     After   several  attempts  to  locate  the  problem  I  took   my
     Multitester and sent 200 OHMS through the on and off switch.   It
     checked out OK.   I then touched the positive end of my tester to
     the plug on the cord, and the end where it went into the monitor.
     The first result was positive,  but the second was  negative.   I
     had  found my trouble,  'NO POWER.'  I then started checking  for
     fuses.  I finally found them, both of them.  An one was scorched,
     so I knew what I had to do.

     The  next morning being saturday,  we drove all over town to find
     the little devil.  An being the wise guy, I only bought 1 package
     of 2.   Upon getting back to the house,  I put one into the  slot
     and  plugged  in  the monitor.   Well I had to tear it  all  down
     again,  walk  over  and  ground myself on my  static  mat  before
     putting  the 2nd one in.   This worked for all of about 2  hours.
     Around 3am I returned from work again,  reached over and  touched
     the monitor, and ZAAAPPPPPP.  Down it went again.

     After  replacing it 4 times,  I figured out what was  wrong,  and
     raised  the  AMPS  from 2.5 to 3.15.   This should  not  harm  it
     according  to  my electronic friend.   It is not good for it  but
     what it does is gives me a buffer of .65 amps before it blows.

     If by now you have not guessed what was causing the problem.   An
     you may be Afraid to Ask.  I will let you in on the problem.


         1.   Friday  24 April.   My wife purchased some  anti  static
     carpet cleaner.  1800 hours she vacummed the floor.

     FidoNews 5-22                Page 16                  30 May 1988


         2.    With  the  anti-static stuff all over the  carpet,  the
     static electricity had no place to go.   An even the static pad I
     was using to sit on did not displace the static from the monitor,
     which is highly staticy any any.   An with it having no place  to
     go when I turned it on it had just enough juice to fry my fuse.

     Yes I hope I have solved the problem til I can afford to purchase
     a swamp cooler or humidifier.   I now have the monitor sitting on
     a  static pad also which we all touch before we turn the  monitor
     or  for that fact the computer ON.   This is just a little  added
     precaution.  Because this area is full of static electricity, and
     even  the  slightest jolt or volt from  STATIC  Electricity,  can
     knock  you on your can so imagine what it can do to your  circuts
     or for matter, your data.

     Don't be afraid to ask.   If you have questions,  there is always
     someone  out here who is willing to provide you with good helpful
     advice.  An what is really nice about it, is most of it is FREE.
