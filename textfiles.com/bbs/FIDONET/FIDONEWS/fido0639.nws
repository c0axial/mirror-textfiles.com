                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     I'm trying  to  sort  of  stand  to  the side and let things just
     happen, but I'm afraid that I need to make a point of order.

     I'm  really  pleased  with  the  way submissions to FidoNews have
     picked up this year.  However, in the past several weeks,  I have
     gotten articles  which  are  really  huge  (over  60K in length),
     formatted so far  out  of  spec  that I couldn't do anything with
     them, and with all kinds of  really strange file names.  My guess
     is that not too many people have  ARTSPEC.DOC  or  aren't reading
     it, so I'll give you some guidelines here.  Please pay attention,
     I don't promise I'll fix ANY broken article!

     Please, give me flat ASCII text, no more  than 65 characters on a
     line, no tabs and no control characters.  Also,  try  to keep the
     length down.  4,000 characters is a pretty good length.    I will
     print  longer stuff, but once you get past 16,000 characters, you
     invite being overlooked, as  MAKENEWS  won't automatically insert
     the story and I don't  like  having  to override its limits.  Use
     any file name you want, but  use  .ART  as  the extension (if you
     send me archives I may not find  them for weeks!), and if you are
     a prolific writer, please use a different file name every time.

     This last thing recently caused Phil Buonomo some  embarrassment.
     His articles have tended to have the file name AAA.ART.  Recently
     I  went  looking  for  stuff I hadn't caught for publication  and
     found files  AAA.AR0  and  AAA.AR1  (BinkleyTerm  keeps  dupes by
     changing the extension).    I published them.  Because of the way
     things had progressed since  they  first  had arrived here, those
     articles no longer made complete sense.

     I'm sorry that this happened.    Please  help  me  keep this from
     happening again.  Stick to these  simple  guidelines  and it will
     make life easier for both me and you.

     I captured  this  from the SYSOP echo this morning.  I think it's
     worth publishing, so here it is:


     [Copied from the SYSOP echo]

     From:   Amnon Nissan
     To:     All
     Subj:   Mike Ratledge

     Guys, how about taking a break a second, and and attending to
     this:

     This is a message I posted in R18 sysop echo, I thought it would
     be a good idea to post it here, so more can help.

     From:   Amnon Nissan
     To:     All
     Subj:   Mike Ratledge

     I just spoke with Mike guys, and the situation is real sad.
     Mike's both houses are completely gone, foundation and all.
     Their cloths, personal belongings, computers, EVERYTHING.  Those
     of us who were fortunate to visit him at his house on the water
     front, the forest is all gone, everything is completely flat he
     says.

     I would like to suggest that we start some kind of a fund to help
     him.  Do we have someone who can head this effort ?

     Mike is not sure if his insurance will pay for anything, he will
     know tommorow.

     This is real sad, but at least they are alive he said.  They
     spent the nite at his dad's house, 50 miles away.

     I forgot to get his address, or a phone number where he can be
     found (got sort of emotional there, and didn't think).  But he
     did say he is going to call other sysops in the region.  If you
     get this befor he calls, or if you have the number or address,
     get/post them.

     Mike sounded real hurt when he called.  So a word of support is
     the least we can do, but hopefully more.

     ================

     OK, if you don't know what I was talking about, Mike Ratledge
     lives in Charlston SC, and I am sure he will not name his first
     born Hugo.

     Ed Melone, 360/0 - 360/1 volonteered to take care of the
     specifics, and open a bank account for the fund.

     If there is ANYTHING that you can do, please do it.  This is --
     unfortunatly -- one way we can show we do care about each other,
     and put all of our differences aside.

     I will keep you posted as to any developements, but at the
     meantime, you can get in touch with Ed, at 360/0.

                   North Dakota says good-bye.

       Well I learned about a week ago that my friend and partner
     in crime is getting reassigned from Minot AFB ND to the
     warmer climes of March AFB in California. And with his
     departure the only network and ONLY nodes in the state will
     disappear from our nodelist. Tom Manship went to the Dakotas
     with an idea to setup and operate a friendly and interesting
     BBS called the Buddist BBS. He succeeded so well that his
     BBS was named twice as one of the Top 10 in the country by
     PC Mag. Along the way he introduced a lot of people,
     including a me, to this neat little network called Fidonet.
     Why he persisted in the face of the great apathy and sparse
     population(600,000) of the state.....amazes even me. But he
     did and he was influential behind the scenes, even though he
     will strongly object to the idea, of changing the way some
     people look at this hobby. Maybe it has to do with his
     Buddist beliefs?
       I guess the reason I am lauding such praise upon the past
     net coordinator of 281 is that after a little experience and
     exposure to the network.....I am beginning to see the wisdom
     of his laid-back easy going style and "don't get mad"
     approach. If we could only just see that same spirit
     throughout the rest of the net. Wow!! You would attract a
     greater following and net expansion. We might even become a
     collective force to be dealt with when it comes to
     organizations that legislate/regulate/manufacture items
     vital to our hobby.
       In closing I hope that Tom Manship returns to us when he
     gets setup in California and keeps our feet on the ground
     and gently reminds us that sometimes there is "no answer"
     .....just questions......and friends with which to discuss
     them with.

     =================================================================
                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================


     From:   David Pyke of 120/148.0
     To:     Everyone of 1/1.0
     Subj:   the finding of a source

     I am unable to get ahold of the source for the game Omega due to
     the lack of easynet access.  WOuld any one having the latest
     version of the source please send me where i can get it.  I wish
     to install it on the VAX i have use of.

     From:   Scott Johnson of 260/332.0
     To:     Sysop of 1/1.0
     Subj:   Showpartner, and Hyperpad

     I'm not sure just how many people are out there that own a
     product called Showpartner, and Hyperpad.  They are both products
     of a company out of Syracuse, NY called Brightbill/Roberts. Their
     customer support BBS has been a whole lot less than anticipated,
     and expected.  In response to this, I am setting up areas in my
     BBS to handle this situation.  I am not an employee of
     Brightbill/Roberts, nor am I a user of these particular products.
     I am a supporter of any new company, and a supporter of Customer
     SUPPORT.  In this respect, I feel that this BBS should, and will
     support Showpartner, and Hyperpad if only to handle the influx of
     questions and ideas, as well as files, and programs.  My BBS is
     called "The Last Word!!!" at 1200 baud, 8/n/1, and the phone
     number is (315) 476-3604.  All hyperpad and Showpartner users
     will receive instant validation if they fill out the
     Showpartner/Hyperpad questionnaire.

                                    Scott Johnson
                                    Syracuse, NY   13203

     From:   Adam Plotkin 269/101.0
     To:     EVERYONE of 1/1.0
     Subj:   Fido Mailers

     do you know of any fido mailers or BBS programs for the Apple
     IIGS or II Series?  Your help is appreciated.  Also, if someone
     is writing one and you could put me in touch with him, I'd love
     it.

                Report from Bylaws and Rules Committee
                             89/09/21

     During the recent Board of Directors meeting held August 25-27
     in San Jose during FidoCon, the Board of Directors enacted
     changes to the bylaws of IFNA as follows:

       1f) is changed to read:

          "At-Large Member.  Anyone listed in the FidoNet nodelist who
          is a system operator in good standing of a PUBLIC ACCESS
          NODE at the date of publication of the ballot, is
          automatically entitled to one vote in the election.  Dues
          for At-Large Members are set at $0."

          [The intent of this amendment is to insure that all public
          access sysops in the FidoNet nodelist in good standing are
          automatically granted a vote in an election, without having
          to apply for membership or pay a 'processing fee'.]

       2. is changed to read:

          "Applications for regular, associate, commercial, or life
          membership shall be submitted to the..."

       9. is changed from "written report" to "report".

      10. is changed from "Elections Committee shall solicit such
          petitions" to "Elections Committee should solicit such
          petitions".

          Add "Failure to meet the deadline will not invalidate an
          election."

      11. Strike "Annual Membership Meeting", change to "the
          election".  Strike "send to every voting member, and..."
          Add "Failure to meet the deadline will not invalidate an
          election."

      12. Remove the last sentence, "Said time must be at least
          forty (40) days from the date the ballots were sent to the
          membership."

      13. Change to read, "The Nominations and Elections Committee
     FidoNews 6-39                Page 23                  25 Sep 1989


          shall be responsible for the receipt, tabulation and
          verification of all BALLOTS cast before the close of
          voting."

      18. Change the word "mailed" to be "sent".

     The complete, up-to-date set of the IFNA Articles of Association
     and Bylaws may be obtained from 1:107/210 or 1:107/211 by file
     requesting BYLAWS.ARC (which is dated 89/09/21).
