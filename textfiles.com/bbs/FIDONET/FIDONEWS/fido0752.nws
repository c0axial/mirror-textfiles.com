     C:\INTRO\MATH
          Here is a list of "things you should know" about upgrading
     your IBM or clone computer. I am going to focus on upgrading
     with a numeric co-processor, a math chip. And, whether or not
     you really need to upgrade to the latest 80486 system even if
     you think you are maxed out on your 33 Mhz 80386.
          Even if you are familiar with the 80x87 series read on. Now
     there are alternative clone chips. One of these alternatives may
     just save you the expense of upgrading your whole motherboard or
     system.
          The thing that got me interested in this topic was a July
     1990 Byte article reviewing two 25 Mhz 486 systems. The big news
     is that a 25 Mhz 486 CPU is no faster than a 33 Mhz 386 CPU. The
     only benefit that you get for spending thousands of extra
     dollars for the 486 system is that the 486's built-in floating
     point unit (FPU) is about twice as fast as the 33 Mhz 80387
     (that you can add to your 386 system for about $550 to $600.)
          If you are maxed out with your current 80x86/80x87
     combination you have several alternatives besides upgrading to a
     faster motherboard or even the 486 system. Now that I've told
     you what my thesis is, let me back up a bit and explain the
     basics.

     C:\BASIC\MATH
          A "numeric co-processor" or "math chip" is an integrated
     circuit chip that you can plug into your motherboard. Its sole
     purpose is to speed up numeric calculations. This chip does
     calculations which would otherwise be done with software running
     on the CPU chip itself.
          Numeric co-processors only benefit a small number of users
     because there are two conditions that must be met in order for
     these chips to make a difference. One is that a good portion of
     your computer time is spent doing mathematical calculations. The
     second is that the software doing these calculations must be
     smart enough to detect the presence of a co-processor and use
     it.
          Computer Aided Design (CAD) programs such as AutoCad
     usually require a co-processor in order to get anywhere near
     acceptable response time. Lotus 1-2-3, QuickBasic, PageMaker and
     Ventura are other common programs that can take advantage of the
     co-processor. (Ventura and PageMaker only take advantage of it
     when printing graphics.)
     FidoNews 7-52                Page 2                   24 Dec 1990


          If you are running one of these programs, and you can
     ascertain that the program is "compute-bound" as opposed to
     "I/O-bound" (such determination is a whole science unto itself)
     then ask yourself if the computations are "number crunching" or
     "character crunching." If your application is compute-bound
     while doing mostly numeric calculations, then adding a numeric
     co-processor or upgrading to a faster alternative co-processor
     will allow your programs to run much faster. If you are compute-
     bound, but the application is just moving data around and not
     doing actual numeric calculations then a co-processor will NOT
     make it run faster.
          One application where a co-processor is useless is a
     dedicated file-server.  Although the 80486 CPU is now touted
     as "ideal" for file-servers, it is a waste of money for such an
     application. The extra money you spend for the 80486 is better
     spent on faster disk drives or more memory for buffers. File-
     servers don't use the floating point unit.
          The claim to fame of the Intel 80486 CPU chip is that it
     has the numeric co-processor built-in. You don't need to add
     one. If you have an 8088, or an 80286 or an 80386, there is
     probably an empty chip socket on your computer's motherboard
     where you could plug in the co-processor. The part number of the
     co-processor depends on the part number of your CPU. The price
     depends on the speed (Mhz rating) and the chip maker.

           CPU      NUMERIC       PRICE RANGE(depends on speed)
                    CO-PROCESSOR
           8088     8087          $ 80-$150
           80286    80287         $170-$250 (AMD's=$99)
           80386    80387         $280-$600
           80386SX  80387SX       $280-$400
           80486    built into CPU chip

          In addition to matching the part number, you also have to
     match the speed. If you have a 10 Mhz 80286, you need a 10 Mhz
     80827. If you have a 12 Mhz 80286, you need a 12 Mhz 80287. If
     you have a 16 Mhz 80386 you need a 16 Mhz 80387, etc. (Assuming
     you "need" one in the first place). If you have a 10 Mhz 80286
     CPU and a 10 Mhz 80287 co-processor just swapping out one of
     these 10 Mhz chips and replacing it with a 12 Mhz chip won't do
     you any good. The timing controls are in the motherboard itself.
     Adjusting the timing controls won't do any good either, because
     the other chips on the motherboard are matched to the timing
     too. (This is akin to those who think that swapping their 120 ns
     memory chips with 80 ns chips will speed up their system. It
     just doesn't work that way.)

     C:\NEW\MATH
     There are five options for those who would benefit from adding a
     co-processor (compute-bound doing numeric calculations). They
     are:

         Vendor   Parts
         ------   -----
         Intel    8087, 80287(-XL(T)), 80387, 80387SX
         IIT      80287, 80387, and 80387SX replacements
         Cyrix    80387 and 80387SX replacements
         AMD      80287 replacement
         Weitek   non-80x87-compatible co-processors for 386 & 486

          Intel, IIT, AMD, and Cyrix co-processors can plug right
     into the socket on your motherboard. Just be sure to choose the
     part number and speed that corresponds to your CPU. The Cyrix
     and IIT chips are about 2 to 3 times faster than their
     corresponding Intel part.
          Intel recently replaced their original 80827 chips with the
     newer 80287-XL and 80287-XLT.  They claim the 80287-XL is 50%
     faster than the original 80287 of the same Mhz rating. But the
     IIT chip is still faster. The 80287-XL will work with any 80286
     CPU up to 12 Mhz.
          According to Byte benchmarks, the AMD chip is slower than
     the Intel chip but only 1/2 the cost. The AMD chip is plastic,
     wheareas the other makers use ceramic chips.
          The Cyrix and IIT co-processors are also slightly less
     expensive depending on where you buy them.
          In addition to being "pin compatible," the Cyrix, AMD, and
     IIT chips are "code compatible" with the Intel chip. Your
     hardware and software cannot tell them apart. Just plug them in
     and go.
          It's the same as the clone philosophy of marketing. You
     have to be better and cheaper than the "big guy" in order to get
     market share. Interesting side note: Intel didn't start
     agressively advertising their numeric co-processors until IIT
     and Cyrix came on the scene. Amazing what a little competition
     will do.
          If you already have an Intel 80x87 chip, then switching to
     either the IIT or the Cyrix equivalent might get you the extra
     number crunching power you need. This could save you the cost of
     upgrading to a faster motherboard or a whole new system.
          There are several "gotchas" here.
          Gotcha #1: Intel somehow fixed or boosted their 33 Mhz
     version of the 80387. While the Cyrix chip is at least twice as
     fast as the Intel chip in the 16, 20, and 25 Mhz versions, the
     33 Mhz version of the Cyrix is only marginally better than the
     33 Mhz version of the Intel chip.
          But... the 33 Mhz Cyrix is still 2.5 times as fast as the
     33 Mhz Intel 80387 when doing transcendental functions such as
     sine, cosine, etc. This makes it a rough equivalent of the 80486
     at this specific type of calculation.
          Gotcha #2: The Cyrix chip has a 90 bit internal
     architecture whereas the Intel chip has an 80 bit internal
     architecture. This means that on certain intensive double-
     precision calculations, the Cyrix chip is SLIGHTLY more precise,
     or better, than the Intel chip. Cross-machine consistency may be
     more important to you than unnecessary extra precision. It is
     possible that after thousands of iterations, the Cyrix will give
     a result that is more precise than the Intel's result. Both
     chips are IEEE compatible and give "accurate" results, but "more
     FidoNews 7-52                Page 4                   24 Dec 1990


     precise" is still different.
          Sidenote: This is the issue on which Intel charged that the
     Cyrix chip is "not Intel compatible." This was a cheap shot
     since the Cyrix chip is better in this regard.
          But... very few applications require the precision where
     the difference would be notable. Single-precision and most
     double-precision calculations would not be affected at all.
          So, if cross-machine conformity is an issue, and you
     already have one vendor's co-processor installed on some
     machines, you might want to stick with that vendor on others. If
     you only have one machine, or haven't installed any co-
     processors on your machines yet, or are going to upgrade all of
     them at once, the Cyrix or IIT is still more bang for your buck.
          Gotcha #3: This applies to all co-processors including
     Intel. When motherboard manufacturers test their boards prior to
     shipping, almost all of them neglect to test the co-processor
     socket. This is probably because no motherboards are shipped
     from the manufacturer with a co-processor already installed.
     This results in some being shipped with defective sockets or
     socket wiring. You might insert your co-processor chip and think
     it is the fault of the chip if it doesn't work. It could be the
     fault of the socket, its wiring, or the motherboard. One vendor,
     Microway, offers a diagnostic program to help you pinpoint the
     problem. Their address is at the end of the article.
          Gotcha #4: Intel did not ship the 80387 co-processor at the
     same time as the first 80386 CPUs. Therefore, manufacturers
     equipped their first 80386 motherboards with an 80287 socket
     instead of, or in addition to, the 80387 socket. The 80287 is
     NOT pin compatible with the 80387. They require different size
     sockets.
          If you are going to add a co-processor to a 386 purchased
     in 1988 or earlier, check the motherboard specifications before
     making a purchase. It might even be a good idea to open the box
     and inspect the motherboard to visually verify what kind of co-
     processor socket is there.
          An 80287 socket is rectangular and has holes for 40 pins in
     2 rows of 20. An 80387 socket is square with round holes for 68
     pins. It has 2 rows of holes on all four sides. A Weitek 3167
     socket is square with round holes for 121 pins. It has 3 rows of
     holes on all four sides, with one extra hole on an inside
     corner. The co-processor socket is usually located adjacent to
     the CPU chip.
          Gotcha #5: Some of the very latest 286 laptop computers
     don't use the 40-pin socket for the 80287. Some, such as the
     Compaq 286/LTE and the Tandy 2800, use a square socket called a
     PLCC. Intel's 80287-XLT is the only math chip currently made for
     these sockets.
          Gotcha #6: Some motherboards drive the co-processor at a
     different clock rate than the CPU. It will be either the same
     clock rate as the CPU, or a certain fraction of the CPU clock.
     Some motherboards have jumper settings to determine the co-
     processor clock rate.  My ATTAK brand motherboard drives the CPU
     at 10 Mhz.  But I can jumper it to drive the co-processor at
     either 10 or 6.66 Mhz.
     FidoNews 7-52                Page 5                   24 Dec 1990


          If your motherboard uses one of the 16 or 20 Mhz 286 chips
     from Harris or AMD, be sure to check the speed at which the co-
     processor is driven, and if it is jumper-selectable.  For
     instance, JADO brand motherboards can drive the CPU at 20 Mhz
     while driving the co-processor at jumper-selectable rates from 8
     to 20 Mhz. IIT is the only manufacturer I could find that makes
     a 20 Mhz 80287 compatible chip.

     C:\ADVANCED\MATH
          The Weitek co-processor is a unique and popular chip. It
     has a dual 32 bit and 64 bit internal architecture. This makes
     it much faster than the other co-processors. It is slightly less
     accurate at double-precision than either the Intel or Cyrix. It
     is still IEEE compatible, but just "different." Again, only the
     pickiest of scientific applications need precision beyond what
     the Weitek provides.
          The Weitek chip is about twice the cost of the Intel chip
     at each Mhz rating. But, it is even faster than the Cyrix and
     IIT chips. It is 3 to 5 times faster than the 80387 of the same
     Mhz rating. And here is the kicker, the 33 Mhz Weitek 3167,
     coupled to the 80386, is FASTER than the 80486's internal FPU on
     everything except double-precision matrix (vector) calculations.
          The manufacturer claims that a Weitek 3167 coupled to a
     80386 provides the floating point speed of DEC VAX 8650. If the
     internal floating point unit (FPU) on the 80486, or the
     80386/Weitek combination is still not enough power for you, you
     could add the Weitek 4167 chip to a 486 system. The Weitek 4167,
     coupled with the 80486, more than doubles the floating point
     speed of the 80486 alone. (The Whetstone rating for the Weitek
     4167 equals the speed of many of today's mainframes.)
          The Weitek chips have their own gotchas.
          Gotcha #1: The Weitek chips are NOT "pin compatible" with
     the Intel co-processor chips.  Most motherboard manufacturers
     are now putting "Weitek sockets" on their motherboards in
     addition to 80387 co-processor sockets. Acer, ALR, AST, AT&T,
     Compaq, CompuAdd, Convergent, Dell, Everex, HP, NCR, Packard
     Bell, Sun, Tandy, Wyse, and Zenith are some that provide this
     feature. If you are buying a new computer system for number
     crunching, this may be a feature you should consider.
          Gotcha #2: The Weitek chip is NOT "code compatible" with
     the Intel 80x87 chips. In order to get the screaming speed into
     this chip Weitek had to change both its electrical interface
     (hence the need for a separate socket) and the software
     interface.
          Like all the other "gotchas," this one also has a "but." A
     growing number of software packages, that are popular among
     users needing number crunching power, have Weitek compatibility.
     CADKEY 3, Vericut, ANVIL-5000pc, CADMAX, VersaCAD/386, AT&T
     Unix, 386/ix, SCO Unix, Phar Lap Virtual Memory Manager, Eclipse
     Dos Extender OS/386, are some that are Weitek Compatible.
     Microway also makes Fortran, C, and Pascal compilers, graphics
     applications, and Math/Stat applications that support the Weitek
     chip.

     C:\OTHER\STUFF
          If you are going to do a lot of number crunching, your
     system has to get those numbers to the co-processor before they
     can be crunched. Many factors go into the overall system speed
     besides the Mhz rating of the CPU.
          The major factors besides the CPU are the disk and main
     memory. ESDI and SCSI disks are faster than MFM and RLL.
     Controllers that support 1:1 interleaving (full track buffering)
     are faster than controllers that are 2:1. Look for these
     features when building a system for speed.
          Memory on the motherboard is accessed a lot faster than
     memory on an expansion card. Look for a motherboard that has the
     capacity for all the memory that you expect to need. The amount
     of memory supported directly on the motherboard varies a great
     deal from one manufacturer to another. Memory on an expansion
     board can take 2 to 4 extra cycles to read.
          "Cache memory," "0 wait state memory," or "system cache" is
     another feature to look for. This is not to be confused with
     disk caching. Disk caching is performed by software, and buffers
     data between the disk and main memory. "System cache" or "0 wait
     state cache" is a special kind of memory that buffers code and
     data between main memory (DRAM) and the CPU. This kind of cache
     is implemented in hardware right on the motherboard. It has
     nothing to do with disk caching or the disk controller.
          CPUs are so much faster than dynamic ram (DRAM) memory that
     "wait states" are used. This has the effect of throttling down
     the CPU. Benchmarks published elsewhere have amply demonstrated
     that systems with cache memory are considerably faster than
     systems without cache memory when everthing else is equal.
          System cache overcomes the problem of slow DRAM slowing
     down the CPU. 80386 systems rated at 20 Mhz and up usually come
     with some kind of cache. Common denominations are 32K, 64K, and
     128K. The more main memory you have, the larger you want your
     cache. To build a faster system, go with the largest cache
     option. CPUs rated at 25 Mhz and up really NEED this cache or
     else the speed of the CPU goes to waste.
          How much cache is needed is a subject of debate. It depends
     on the application, and the size of the portions of code that
     get executed most often. Multi-tasking or multi-user systems
     would need more than a non-multi-tasking system. Heavy CAD
     graphics also benefit by having cache. Constant manipulation of
     large matrices in memory, such as large spreadsheets, also
     benefit by having cache.
          The 80486 CPU chip has a built-in cache controller and 8K
     of internal cache. This is one of the reasons that a 25 Mhz 486
     can perform at the same speed as a 33 Mhz 386. However, 8K of
     cache is no where near enough for a multi-tasking system that
     has megabytes of main memory. So look for a system cache of 64K
     and up when shopping for 486 systems too. Don't be fooled by
     Intel's claims of "built-in cache" on the 486 chip. It's nice
     that it's there, but it's not enough.

          If you are writing your own programs for in-house
     scientific use there are even more esoteric options. Computers
     based on the Inmos/SGS T800 transputer and the Intel i860 RISC
     CPU chip are available in the form of expansion boards that fit
     in your AT or 386 expansion slots.
          The T800 operates at 10 MIPS and 1.5 megaflops. The i860 is
     capable of from 8 to 20 megaflops. Microway offers these
     "supercomputers-on-a-board" and the software (C, Fortran, and
     utilities) to run them. A German company, DSM, phone 408-946-
     0655, also offers an i860 computer on an expansion board.

     C:\RECAP
          If you need more number crunching speed:
          1. If you don't have a numeric co-processor on your system,
     see if your software applications support one. If they do
     support one, consider adding a co-processor if you meet the
     compute-bound criteria previously described.
          2. If you already have a co-processor and applications that
     use it, consider switching to a Cyrix, IIT, or Weitek (if your
     applications can also support the Weitek) before upgrading to a
     faster CPU.
          3. If you are shopping for a new number crunching computer,
     look for: a high Mhz rating of the CPU, lots of fast motherboard
     memory, lots of memory cache (not just disk cache), and ESDI or
     SCSI disks with a 1:1 controller. Then shop for the fastest co-
     processor that both the motherboard and your applications
     support.

          4. Beware of the claims of the 486-25. It's not as fast as
     a 386-33 with a Weitek 3167. The extra cost is not in proportion
     to the extra power. Aside from the FPU, it's no faster than a
     vanilla 386-33. But if you have the bucks to spend, the 486
     combined with a Weitek 4167 is the current ultimate.
          5. To shop for a co-processor check the chip distributors
     who advertise in the back of magazines such as Byte and PC
     Magazine. When you are ready to buy, be sure to tell the vendor
     what kind of system you have in order to match the part # and
     Mhz rating of the chip.
          6. A company specializing in co-processors, add-in boards,
     and number crunching, both software and hardware, is Microway,

     AVICULTURISTS WANTED!!

     I have noticed reading the echo's available to me in Region 12,
     that there is not one dedicated to Aviculturists. For those that
     are unfamiliar to this term, it relates to those interested in
     the breeding of domestivated birds (ie Canaries, Parrots etc
     etc). I've seen echo's devoted to those interested in Tropical
     fish (the AQUARIUM echo) and thought of establishing one for
     those involved in the breeding or just the keeping of birds.

     If there is one already established, I would most certainly like
     to hear about it. If not, I would appreciate hearing from anyone
     that is interested in such an echo. If demand prevails, I am
     considering setting up an echo area.

     Any Sysops who are interested, either for themselves or for their
     users, can contact me via Net Mail, 24 hrs, at 1:229/110 Durham

               PUBNET: The International Publisher's Exchange

     For those interested in electronic publishing, desktop
     publishing, and computer graphics, a new organization has been
     formed with telecommunications technology at its core.  The
     International Publisher's Exchange (PUBNET) is a not-for-profit
     organization which serves as an information clearing house for
     individuals involved in graphic communications.

     Currently, PUBNET is carried by 200 BBS's throughout the U.S. and
     Europe.  Primarily implemented with Fido-based technology, PUBNET
     is expanding its operations to include gateways to other networks
     (i.e. InterNet & RIME).

     PUBNET currently consists of 14 echoes focused on many aspects of
     computer graphics and publishing including specific software
     topics (i.e. PageMaker, Ventura, Quark, etc.), production
     techniques, hardware technologies, and other such forums.
     Additionally, PUBNET maintains a file distribution system as well
     as a specific echo, called PUBNEWS, which carries late-breaking
     news and press releases regarding the fast-moving graphic
     communications market.  Many times new product announcements
     appear in PUBNEWS long before they appear in print.

     Users of PUBNET include those with a casual interest or need, to
     professional individuals and organizations involved in graphic
     production, computer software and hardware, and corporate
     communications.  PUBNET provides a good way for all levels of
     users to learn and share ideas and solutions in computer
     publishing.

     If you would to learn more about PUBNET, or would like to
     establish echo feeds, you may contact Carl Dickson, 1:109/519,
     Robert Keown, 1:273/718, or Gene Rodrigues, 1:143/25, for
     additional information and the location of the nearest PUBNET
     hub.

     | The Respectable SysOps Guide |
     |    by:  Michael Rapp         |   LAST REVISED: 12/17/90
     |    aka: Captain Vizor        |
     | SysOp:  USS Vulcanix         |
     |         713/774-0088         |
     \------------------------------/

     This is a guide that ALL SysOps should follow if they are
     to be viewed by the modem world as "Respectable", and their
     BBSes known a "Quality" BBS.
     -----------------------------------------------------------

     1. Respectable SysOps don't put up a board without a hard
        drive. They already have a 20MB or greater one made by
        a major company like Seagate.

     2. Respectable SysOps have 2400 baud or greater.  The one
        exception is that chat boards may have 300 because of
        the expense of 5 or more phone lines and modems.

     3. Respectable SysOps do not run their BBS when the fan has
        broken down.

     4. Respectable SysOps turn off their monitor as often as
        possible.

     5. Respectable SysOps don't care if a user is going to put
        up a board next week.

     6. Respectable SysOps try to help the user get his/her
        board started by offering hints and tips.

     7. Respectable SysOps who operate boards that require money
        for access do not give free validation to someone just
        because they run "THE ULTIMATE BBS" and have a 250 MB
        hard drive.

     8. Respectable SysOps laugh when users say 'I have your voice
        number' or 'I am a Phed'.

     9. Respectable SysOps are very annoyed when users leave
        numbers like 'CAN-NOT-TELL' or 'PRI-VAT-E!!!'.

     10. Respectable SysOps do not make up excuses to leave a
         person with whom they are chatting like 'My dad is
         calling me'.

     FidoNews 7-52                Page 13                  24 Dec 1990


     11. Respectable SysOps NEVER have pirated software on their
         boards.

     12. Respectable SysOps ALWAYS check uploaded software for
         viruses before putting it online.

     13. Respectable SysOps have a dedicated computer with a
         dedicated phone line and modem for their board.  They
         never take it down except to run BBS maintinence or to
         call a few BBSes that they like.  They never tie up the
         board for more than an hour calling other BBS systems.

     14. Respectable SysOps don't say 'L8r', 'k-K00l','B@SS' or
         any other related terms.

     15. Respectable SysOps when on chat boards do not use macros
         every five minutes saying "Call the SPECTRUM ELITE!
         ???/???-????".

     16. Respectable SysOps NEVER leave mail to users asking them
         to post.

     17. Respectable SysOps get EXTREMELY angry if their boards
         are crashed intentionally by other users. If
         unintentionally, they go get a Pepsi and try to fix it.

     18. Respectable SysOps ALWAYS make a backup of their user
         list and other important files every week.

     19. Respectable SysOps don't care about "improper sign-offs".

     20. Respectable SysOps don't think that they are God and are
         better than everyone else.

     21. Respectable SysOps help the new users, not cut them down.

     22. Respectable SysOps NEVER have a message base such as
         "ABUSE THAT USER".

     23. Respectable SysOps don't care what another user posts
         about him/her on a "kid" or "looser" or "sleazy" board.

     24. Respectable SysOps put up the BBS as a service.

     25. Real SysOps don't get out their sector editor and put
         their name on every piece of software they have in hopes
         of gaining national recognition.

     26. Respectable SysOps NEVER let users threaten them in any
         way.

     FidoNews 7-52                Page 14                  24 Dec 1990


     27. Respectable SysOps NEVER EVER answer their board line by
         voice.

     28. Respectable SysOps NEVER chat with users when they
         themselves are in a bad mood.

     29. Respectable SysOps know that users tend to like SysOps
         who take the time to chat to work out a problem the user
         is having online.

     30. Respectable SysOps always wait at least 15 seconds before
         breaking into chat.

     32. Respectable SysOps never type their fastest.  Users
         respect SysOps who are accurate.

     33. Respectable SysOps NEVER say "My board is the best" or "if
         you're going to pay, make it my board", this will more
         discourage users than attract them.

     34. Respectable SysOps NEVER copy an obvious, original idea
         from another board.  Users admire SysOp that come up with
         their own ideas.

     35. Respectable SysOps try to modify the original BBS software
         as much as possible.  Users tend to get bored if they call
         boards that just leave the software exactly in the
         original "generic" condition.

     Introduction

          FidoNet has been using the Type II style packet for some
     five years or more now with good results.  However, at this
     point, the Type II format has been extended an amazing number
     of ways using the "Kludge" hidden line facility provided by a
     leading ^A (ASCII SOH) on a line of text.  It is my belief that
     the time has come to move to a newer technology for handling
     packets, one that is inherently extensible and easily handled by
     a number of systems.  Such a system should be able to handle such
     varied things as integrated text/graphics and other special
     attributes of messages.

     Basic Format

          Essentially, this format would break a message into a number
     of "chunks".  Each chunk would be a maximum of 4,294,967,306(!)
     bytes long including its header and may contain any type of
     data.  A chunk header would be 21 bytes long and would consist of
     a 4 byte chunk type tag followed by an 8 byte length field.  The
     length field does *not* include the 12 bytes of the chunk
     header.  Additionally, the length field is the the length of
     the chunk *AS TRANSMITTED*, i.e., in ASCII.  Chunks would be
     unterminated.  In C, a chunk structure would look like this:

          struct chunk {
               char type[4];
               char  len[8];  /* 32  bit  length of data field, 8 hex
                                 digits */
               unsigned char data[len]; /* not really, this isn't
                                           legal c, but it gets the
                                           idea across */
          };

          Certain chunk types require that a FidoNet address be
     represented in a binary hex format.  This address would be
     comprised of the domain, zone, net, node, and point expressed as
     the following C structure:

          struct address {
     FidoNews 7-52                Page 16                  24 Dec 1990


               char point[4];
               char node[4];
               char net[4];
               char zone[4];
               char domain[];
          };

     The domain name is nul terminated and variable length.  If absent
     it defaults to the current domain.

          All other fields are 4 hex digits with NO
     terminating nul character.  It was chosen to use an ASCII
     representation of numbers (in hex) to avoid byte ordering
     problems and to enhance portability across 7 bit transport
     layers.  For example, the author's address would be:

             0000001E00720001FIDONET

     See Appendix 6 for suggestions on generating this form of
     address.

          A line, as defined by this document, is a sequence of 7
     bit ASCII characters terminated with a linefeed (0x0a).

     Chunk Types

          Chunk type names are exactly four characters long, padded
     with spaces if necessary.  Chunk types not recognized by a
     program would be passed along and ignored.  Chunk types that are
     marked with an asterisk (*) must be recognized by a conforming
     installation.  Chunk types marked with a C are considered control
     chunks, while those marked with D are data chunks.  Unmarked
     chunks are delimiters or informational.  I would propose the
     following base chunk types:

        * BEGB      A chunk indicating the beginning of a bundle.
                    This chunk may contain optional information
                    identifying the bundle.

          CRTR      Indicates the software and revision level used
                    to create this bundle.  Applies only to entire
                    bundles.

        * PSWD      Password for the entire bundle, or if within
                    "BEGM"/"ENDM" a single message.  If the password
                    in this chunk does not match a predefined
                    password on the receiving system one of two
                    actions occurs.  If the receiving system is the
                    final destination of the bundle or message, the
                    bundle or message is discarded, optionally with
                    a message being sent back to the sender saying so.

                    If the bundle or message is only passing through,
                    it will not be made visible to the sysop of the
                    routing system, regardless of any options that
                    may be set to the contrary.  Obviously, this is
                    lightweight security, but it is better than
                    nothing!

          BEGA  C   This chunk indicates the conference the following
                    messages (up to the corresponding ENDA marker)
                    belong to.  This could be multiple areas, one area
                    per line.  BEGA/ENDA chunks may be nested.

        * BEGM      A chunk indicating the beginning of a message,
                    this chunk may contain optional information
                    identifying the message.

        * ROUT  C   Binary address of next destination for this
                    message or bundle.  In other words, if a message
                    from 123/456 is going to 456/789 but is routed
                    through an intermediary system (say 321/654) this
                    address would be that of the intermediary system.

                    This chunk may be applied to either a single
                    message or an entire bundle.

        * TO    C   Name and address of receiver in ASCII.  The
                    address in this field may be anything, so long
                    as the system at the "ROUT" address can make
                    sense of it.  For split addresses (name and
                    address separated, such as a FidoNet address) the
                    address should be on two ASCII lines separated a
                    newline (ASCII 0x0a) with the address on the first
                    line and name on the second line.  Integrated
                    addresses (name and address all in one, such as
                    Internet) should be on one line, with an
                    optional second line giving the recipient's
                    actual name.

        * FROM  C   Name and address of sender in ASCII.  This
                    may be anything so long as it is possible for
                    the receiver to reply via the address in this
                    field. The format of this should be the same as
                    for the TO chunk

        * TIME  D   Timestamp of the message. Represented as a 32
                    bit integer counting the number of seconds from
                    January 1, 1970 0:00 UTC.  8 digit hexadecimal
                    field.

        * SUBJ  D   Subject of the message

     FidoNews 7-52                Page 18                  24 Dec 1990


        * ATTR  C   Attributes of the message. See Appendix 2 for
                    a complete list of message attributes.

        * NUMB      Serial number of this message on originating
                    system. This chunk is fixed as an 8 byte hex
                    word. Length is 8.

        * RPLY      Identifier of the message this is a reply to.
                            This is a two line field, with the address
                    of the system the message being replied to on
                    the first line and the serial number (from the
                    NUMB) chunk of the replied to message on the
                    second line.

        * ATCH  C   Name of a file attached to this message

        * FREQ  C   Name of a file requested from receiving system.
                    This would incorporate the same type of update
                    request logic as is currently used by WaZoo
                    mailers.  A separate "FREQ" chunk is required
                    for each file requested.

          DOMN  C   Echomail only, list of domains, one per line, of
                    the domains this message has passed through

          ZONE  C   Echomail only, list, as four byte hex words,
                    of zones that have seen this message.  This
                    chunk is cleared each time the message enters a
                    different domain and the name of the domain the
                    message is exiting is added to the "DOMN" chunk.

          NET   C   Echomail only, list, as four byte hex words,
                    of all nets that have seen this message.  This
                    chunk is cleared upon export to another zone and
                    the exporting node's zone number is added to the
                    "ZONE" chunk.

          NODE  C   Echomail only, list, as four byte hex words,
                    of all nodes in the current net that have seen
                    this message.  This chunk is cleared each time
                    the message enters a new net and the number of
                    the net the message is exiting is added to the
                    "NET " chunk.

          PONT  C   Echomail only, list, as four byte hex words,
                    of all point systems that have seen this message.
                    This chunk is cleared upon export to another node
                    and the node number of the exporting system is
                    added to the "NODE" chunk.

        * PATH      List of the systems this message has passed
     FidoNews 7-52                Page 19                  24 Dec 1990


                    through to reach this system, in order.  This
                    includes all systems in all zones and domains.
                    All addresses would be in hex as defined in the
                    section "Basic Formats" with one address per
                    line.

        * TEXT  D   The text of a message.  This is restricted to
                    seven bit ASCII characters.  Prefixing a
                    character with an ASCII ESC (0x1b) indicates
                    that the following character has its high-order
                    bit set. ASCII ESC is recognized by the sequence
                    ESC ESC. Text lines are terminated with an ASCII
                    LF (0x0a).  A message may contain as many TEXT
                    chunks as are necessary for the text of the
                    message.  Adjacent TEXT chunks are logically
                    concatenated.

          QUOT  C   Indicates that the following text chunk is quoted.
                            This field contains:

                             name of quoted person
                             address of quoted person
                             timestamp of quoted message (8 digit hex)
                             optional information

                    with each subfield on a separate line.

          GRPH  D   A vector drawing. This is an HPGL image. Multiple
                    GRPH chunks may appear in a message. GRPH chunks,
                    like TEXT chunks, are logically concatenated when
                    adjacent.

          SEEN  C   This is a list of the systems that have seen this
                    message.  Address are in ASCII, one per line.
                    Omitted fields in an address are replaced by the
                    value of the corresponding field of the preceding
                    address.

        * ENDM      A chunk indicating the end of a message.  This
                    chunk may optionally contain information
                    identifying the message it terminates.

          ENDA      This chunk terminates a list of message for a
                    particular conference(s).  If the opening BEGA
                    chunk lists multiple conferences, then multiple
                    ENDA chunks may be used, each listing one or more
                    of the conferences in the BEGA. See Appendix 4 for
                    more details.

        * ENDB      A chunk indicating the end of the bundle,
                    anything after this can be safely ignored.
     FidoNews 7-52                Page 20                  24 Dec 1990


                    This chunk may optionally contain information
                    identifying the bundle it terminates.

          NULL      An empty chunk. This may never be needed, but
                    would conceivably be useful for separating
                    adjacent GRPH and TEXT chunks that should not be
                    concatentated.

     Other Considerations

          Chunk style packets could not be sent as *.PKT files as they
     are not backward compatible with type II packets.  I propose that
     chunk style packets be called bundles and sent as *.BUN files,
     with compressed bundles sent as *.B??  where ??  is the
     compression method used (see Appendix 1 for extensions).  Bundle
     file names should be unique for at least a one week cycle, a 32
     bit serial number expressed in hexadecimal should prove adequate
     for most applications.

          Experimental chunk types are provided for by the provision
     that unrecognized chunk types be passed through and ignored.
     Systems that know how to use a particular chunk type (say, BITS)
     can, while systems that don't understand it may ignore it.

          Chunks should appear in a bundle in roughly the same order
     as they appear above, with control and informational chunks
     (PATH, ROUT, etc) appearing before data chunks (TEXT, BITS,
     GRPH).

     Control

          Chunk tag name assignments are controlled by Appendix 3 of
     this document.  New chunk tags may be added and old ones
     revised by revision of this document.  Message attribute
     assignments are controlled by Appendix 2 of this document.  New
     attributes may be assigned by revision of this document.
     Bundle file extensions are controlled by Appendix 1 of this
     document.  New extensions may be defined and old ones revised
     by revision of this document.

     Conclusion

          I doubt I have covered all possible or desirable chunk types
     in this document.  I do believe however, that enough have been
     defined to get started with.  Chunks offer a highly flexible,
     extensible system of bundling mail.  New types of chunks may
     defined as needed to accomodate advances in technology and
     FidoNet.  Additionally, this would further separate the
     application and transport layers of FidoNet, yielding less
     confusion as to their respective roles.

          It may be noticed that this structure is extremely similar
     to the IFF format as used on Amiga computers and introduced by
     Electronic Arts Software. While inspired by IFF, this system
     has been simplified somewhat and changed to be more easily
     transportable between computers using different byte orders and
     processors.  All fields defined in this document are 7 bit
     ASCII and should be easily parsed by any system.

     Appendix 1 - Compression Extensions

          Compressed bundles would indicate the type of compression
     used by the following file extensions:

          Extension      Creator
          ---------      -------
          .BUN           Uncompressed
          .BPK           PKZip
          .BLH           LHarc
          .BAR           ARC
          .BDW           DWC
          .BPA           PAK
          .BZO           ZOO
          .BPX           PKXarc

     Appendix 2 - Message Attributes

          The following attributes have been assigned:

             PRIV            privileged message (sysop or recipient
                             only)
             CRYP            encrypted message
             CRSH            High priority message
             DRCT            Send directly to destination (no routing)
             HOLD            Hold this message for pickup

          Attributes are listed one per line and may combined where
     it makes sense to do so. (crash and hold makes no sense...)


     Appendix 3 - Defined Chunk Tags

          The following chunk tags are defined in this document:

          BEGB      TO        RPLY      NODE      SEEN
          CRTR      FROM      ATCH      PONT      ENDM
          PSWD      TIME      FREQ      PATH      ENDA
          BEGA      SUBJ      DOMN      TEXT      ENDB
          BEGM      ATTR      ZONE      QUOT      NULL
          ROUT      NUMB      NET       GRPH

     Appendix 4 - The BEGA/ENDA chunks

     FidoNews 7-52                Page 22                  24 Dec 1990


          Messages may belong to multiple conferences (this is quite
     common in UseNet).  Therefore it is possible to nest both BEGA
     and ENDA chunks.  Additionally, it is possible to list multiple
     conferences in either chunk.  For example, ten messages come
     through a system.  The first five are crossposted to both c_echo
     and c_plusplus, the next two are c_echo only and the next are
     posted to c_echo and net_dev.  Finally, the last message is to
     net_dev only.  The basic bundle structure (showing only the
     BEGA/ENDA [with BEGM....ENDM indicating a message] chunks for
     clarity) would be as follows (<lf> is a linefeed [ASCII 10]):


             BEGA00000011C_ECHO<lf>C_PLUSPLUS
             BEGM....ENDM
             BEGM....ENDM
             BEGM....ENDM
             BEGM....ENDM
             BEGM....ENDM
             ENDA0000000AC_PLUSPLUS
             BEGM....ENDM
             BEGM....ENDM
             BEGA00000007NET_DEV
             BEGM....ENDM
             BEGM....ENDM
             ENDA00000006C_ECHO
             BEGM....ENDM
             ENDA00000007NET_DEV

          In other words, BEGA/ENDA are cumulative. This should allow
     greater flexibility in conferencing and should assist in porting
     UseNet conferences over as it is common for a UseNet message to
     posted across several conferences.

     Appendix 5 - Echomail

          This proposal contains two different possibilities for
     controlling echomail flow.  The first assumes a tree structured
     topology and is represented by the DOMN, ZONE, NET, NODE and PONT
     chunks.  The second is similar to current echomail distribution
     and uses the SEEN chunk to list the systems a message has been
     seen by.  This document does not attempt to judge either system
     on its merits (or otherwise), they are simply presented.

     Appendix 6 - Addresses and C

          In C, chunk addresses can be generated using the sprintf()
     function with parameters of the form:

     sprintf(addrstr,"%04x%04x%04x%04x%s",point,node,net,zone,domain);

     It may be read back with:

     sscanf(addrstr,"%4x%4x%4x%4x%s",&point,&node,&net,&zone,&domain);

     Appendix 7 - Contributors

          The following people have contributed to this
     specification in some way.  If I've missed your name, please
     forgive me...  I get a lot of mail on this and have misplaced
     some messages.

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9012.25..."
     by Phil Buonomo, 1:107/583@FidoNet 520/583@AlterNet 9:807/1@PNet

     Since this is the last scheduled FidoNews of the year, and coin-
     cidentally the last one before BOTH Christmas and New Year's, I
     made a special effort of submitting something this week.  I've a
     few articles that have been on the back burner for a few weeks,
     but just haven't had the time to get them in.  Hopefully I'll be
     able to write them down soon.  In the meantime I wish all who read
     this a very happy holiday season, regardless of religious belief,
     color of skin, sexual preference, or even network affiliation:

                    A Christmas Poem  (Author unknown)

     Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the shop,
     The computers were whirring; they never do stop.
     The power was on and the temperature right,
     In hopes that the input would feed back that night.

     The system was ready, the program was coded,
     And memory drums had been carefully loaded;
     While adding a Christmasy glow to the scene,
     The lights on the console flashed red, white, and green.

     When out in the hall there arose such a clatter,
     The programmer ran out to see what was the matter.
     Away to the hallway he flew like a flash,
     Forgetting his key in his curious dash.

     He stood in the hallway and looked all about,
     When the door slammed behind him,and he was locked out.
     Then, in the computer room, what should appear,
     But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer;
     And a little old man, who with scarcely a pause, Chuckled:
     "My name is Santa... the last name is Claus."

     The computer was startled, confused by the name,
     Then it buzzed as it heard the old fellow exclaim:
     "This is Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen,
     And Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen."

     With all these odd names, it was puzzled anew;
     It hummed and it clanked, and a main ciruit blew.
     It searched in its memory core, trying to "think";
     Then the multi-line printer went out on the blink.

     Unable to do its electronic job,
     It said in a voice that was almost a sob:
     "Your eyes--how they twinkle--your dimples so merry,
     Your cheeks so like roses, your nose like a cherry,
     Your smile--all these things, I've been programmed to know,
     And at data-recall, I am more than so-so;

     But your name and your address (computers can't lie),
     Are things that I just cannot identify.

     You've a jolly old face and a little round belly,
     That shakes when you laugh like a bowlful of jelly;
     My scanners can see you, but still I insist,
     Since you're not in my program, you cannot exist!'

     Old Santa just chuckled a merry "ho,ho,"
     And sat down to type out a quick word or so.
     The keyboard clack-clattered, its sound sharp and clean,
     As Santa fed this "data" into the machine:
     "Kids everywhere know me; I come every year;
     The presents I bring add to everyone's cheer;
     But you won't get a thing-- that's plain to see;
     Too bad your programmers forgot about me."

     Then he faced the machine and said with a shrug,
     "Happy Christmas to all," as he pulled out its plug.

             =========== >>> PERNnet: Brigadoon Weyr <<< ==========
             *********** >>>    Gift Certificate     <<< **********

     Welcome to the planet PERN where one can play Pernese style of
     life.  With this Certificate you may get ONE link into PERNnet
     regardless of the originating system's origin and network.

     Brigadoon Weyr is devoted to the weirder things in life -- fringe
     groups, nonstandard religions, Elvis searchers, cult movies, bad
     audio and video, and certified maniacs and politicians.  It is
     the goal of The Brigadoon Weyr to allow the weird, the odd, the
     huddled masses yearning to be free an electronic playpen in
     which to espouse their varied belief systems. It is a network
     of losers, winners, dreamers, screamers.

     In time the Pernese conference where one will play out the roll
     of a Pernese name and also be able to have (a) Fire Lazard(s) or
     be a dragon rider to defend the planet Pern againsts the Red
     Planet that visits every 400 years.

     In closing, I point out that we are all of us doing this as a
     hobby, and will tolerate no politics or powerplays. We make no
     distinctions as to age, background, religion, sex, gender, et
     cetera.  We are an Equal Opportunity Network, limited solely by
     the ability to move echomail around in a reasonably good manner.
     Problems with offending nodes will be dealt with via the path
     structure of the network until it reaches The Brigadoon Weyr
     Central (1:325/101@FidoNet) where we will deal with it as need
     be.

     For your free information package you may file requet(FREQ) the magic
     name of BRIGADOON from the following locations:  Also you may FREQ
     the magic name of PERNLIST and it will get you a list of systems
     currently part of PERNnet.

     This should get you BRIGADON.ZIP.  if you need a standard ARC version
     FREQ `BRIGADON.ARC' instead.
