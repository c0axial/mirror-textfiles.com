     =================================================================

                          What Mean These By-Laws?


     You all,  I hope,  saw the special By-Laws edition two weeks ago.
     What do they mean to YOU?

     Well,  right off the bat,  they mean that  you  can  continue  to
     operate  as  before with little or no change.  I can't really say
     no change at all,  simply because FidoNet is growing large enough
     that,  for  purely technical reasons,  a few changes are going to
     have to happen.

     One of these technical changes  will  involve  splitting  FidoNet
     into separate "zones", but if you don't do any international mail
     (as  few  of  us  do),  then  that  shouldn't  really  make  much
     difference to you.

     So how else will it affect you?  Well,  if you do nothing at all,
     then it won't affect you at all.

     Let me explain that.  The whole idea is to set  up  a  membership
     organization  called "the International FidoNet Association",  or
     "IFNA" for short.  To be a  fully  qualified,  voting  member  of
     IFNA,  one  must  first  be the sysop of a public access bulletin
     board that is in the FidoNet node list,  and then  one  must  pay
     dues.  Notice  that  these  are separate.  You can be in the node
     list without paying dues,  in which case you are not a member  of
     IFNA  and  can't  vote  on how to spend the money that you didn't
     contribute.  But if you DO pay dues,  then you get a say  in  how
     your money is spent.  What could be more fair?

     In fact, the only problem that I see with the whole thing is that
     there  really  isn't  much  of any incentive to pay dues and be a
     member.  And if there aren't many members,  then IFNA will remain
     a cash-poor,  starving association with almost no resources to do
     anything really constructive.  I personally am hoping  that  IFNA
     can come up with enough additional benefits to provide to members
     that there will be some real incentive to join,  so that maybe we
     can start making some progress on  the  many,  many  fronts  that
     await us and challenge us.

                       BackComm, A productivity tool


     La Salle Micro's  BackComm is no ordinary communications utility.
     It is a  comgolmerate  of  programs  integrated  into  a  mammoth
     productivity  tool.   Unfortunately, a great deal of lead and lag
     time is required between using the utility and reading well  over
     350  pages  of  well  written documentation before one can become
     proficient enough to use BackComm readily.   Hence,  if  you  are
     looking for a program that you can use right away, then stay away
     from BackComm; this  is  definitely  not  the  utility  for  you.
     However,  if  you  are  looking for a program that will do almost
     anything with a modem and a file, then BackComm  may  just  be  a
     utility which you may want to add to your software library.

     BackComm  is  enormous,  its programs and data are distributed in
     two 360K non-copyprotected 5.25" diskettes.  With  a  utility  of
     this  size,  it is senseless to use the utility directly from the
     diskettes.  I  strongly  recommend  that  anyone  using  BackComm
     installs  it  onto a hard drive; it is just too clumsy to execute
     from a diskette.

     BackComm  also  requires  a  minimum  of  256K  of memory, and it
     supports a variety of modems such as  Hayes  and  U.S.  Robotics.
     BackComm may also be installed as a resident program which can be
     entered and exited to perform  background  file  transfers.   The
     resident  portion  of  BackComm  requires  a  minimum  of 180K of
     memory,  and  three  protocols  are supported for file transfers:
     ASCII, XMODEM, and X.PC.

     Despite  its  enormity,  BackComm's many features may be accessed
     through a menu driven system with context-sensitive help screens.
     And  although  I found the default colors of the BackComm screens
     disagreeable, an interface is provided for  altering  the  screen
     colors.   Furthermore,  interfaces  have  also  been provided for
     configuring a hierarchical  telephone  directory  which  size  is
     limited  by  the amount disk space available, and for configuring
     communications parameters so that BackComm may  be  used  with  a
     variety of modems and databases.

     BackComm  also  has  an  extremely powerful script language and a
     script generator, BackTalk.  The script language may be  used  to
     completely  automate one or more on-line sessions, and the script
     generator may be used executed  in  learn  mode  to  convert  the
     user's  keystrokes into a script.  Furthermore, BackTalk may also
     be used as a script editor for updating,  creating,  and  merging
     scripts.

     Lastly,  BackComm  provides  an interface for manipulating files.
     The file services offered by BackComm are similar to those  found
     in  1-Dir  and X-Tree.  This interface may be used to:  display a
     directory sorted by name, extension, size, or date;  copy  files;
     move  files;  view  files;  encrypt or decrypt files; compress or
     expand files.

     BackComm is an extermely large utility that attempts to do almost
     everything.  Unfortunately, because of its  immensity,  too  much
     lead  and  lag time is needed to develop any level of proficiency
     for my liking, but if you do not find this  unsettling  then  you
     might find BackComm a utility worth the time and effort to become
     adept in using it.

     Doug Mohney
     Fido 109/74 "The Bear's Den"

                         Doug's Column -- 10/31/86

          POSTSCRIPT IS IT: Lots of word-processing packages,
     including Word Perfect, are providing support for the
     PostScript language and Sun MicroSystems is endorsing
     PostScript as a standard to exchange graphics on its
     workstations. Since Sun is a trend-setter in the
     workstation market, expect to see lots of printer makers
     and software manufacturers rush to support PostScript.

          I know of one Atari ST software developer who will
     end up supporting PostScript in his desktop publishing/CAD
     program. Wish he'd paid up for Computerfest earlier tho'.

          DON'T DO THIS, BUT: A programmer-hacker wrote and
     maintained a payroll system for a rather important firm.
     Said firm lost some money and got RIF-fever, and among those
     to go was our programmer-hacker. When the next pay period
     rolled around, the payroll program, previously flawless,
     crashed and died bigtime.

          The company hired a <cheap> consultant to look at the
     payroll system; he couldn't find anything wrong with the
     system. Meanwhile, the rank and file were getting Very
     Pissed over not being paid for nearly a month.

          Finally, the company re-hired the programmer-hacker and
     he had the payroll system up and running without a hitch
     in 10 minutes.

          Seems he heard about the RIF in advance and had plugged
     in a simple routine which looked for his name on the payroll.
     IF NOT(hisname) THEN Crash.

          Moral of this story: Yes, this was a nifty trick. It was
     also criminal for the hacker to pull a stunt like that. I guess
     you could say the people who hired him were criminally stupid
     to be dependent on a single programmer for a vital task.

          WISHLIST FOR FIDO:  I would really love to see someone
     publish a "Phone Directory" for FIDOnet, which would list all
     the nodes by geographic area/city, net and node number, phone
     number, and specialities which each board may have. There are
     FIDOs in Europe, Austrailia, and New Jersey. Lotta places.

          I hope Tom Jennings ports FIDO over to 68000-based machines
     like the ST and Amiga. My understanding is that FIDO is written
     in 'C', which is psuedo-portable. It should be relatively easy
     to port FIDO over to ST, because its' OS deals with files a
     lot like MS-DOS (e.g.: Directory-based).

          It'd be nice to also see multi-user support on FIDO, a la
     RBBS-PC, with an additional capability for chatting. Obviously,
     Fidonews                     Page 6                    1 Dec 1986


     it would take more code to provide for file-locking, etc,
     Needless to say, this "UltraFIDO"
     would be restricted to IBM-PC/AT/? and 68000-based machines.

          JUNKO-HARDWARE DEPARTMENT: Penril "Cadet" modem. A division
     at Uni. of MD bought 6 of them in the summer, and 4 of the 6
     powerpacks have fried out. Further, it does a wonderful job of
     picking up AM radio stations.

          Another nomination is the VAXMate (I can hear the DEC
     purists scream). It took Digital 2 years to develop
     a pretty AT-Clone with lots of proprietary expansion capability
     and Ethernet built in. At $4,000 a pop for a diskless
     workstation, BFD. You can buy a PC-clone, plug in Ethernet,
     and DEC's MS-NET, and have lots of change left.

          GRAPHICS STANDARDS WANTED: EGA is old hat now and eyes
     are on the TI & Intel graphics co-processing chips. Who will set
     the next generation standards for graphics boards? Or will we
     have to wait for IBM to put out another medocre "standard"?

          The current patch is to write drives for Microsoft Windows;
     if your application will run under Window, it will take
     advantage of the higher resolution. Euh. I guess it is better
     than nothing, but it'd be very nice for company "X" to stand
     up and say "We're doing 1280 by 840, and making our specs
     public domain so anyone can make clone boards to follow in our
     footsteps." I also believe in the tooth fairy.

           BORLAND'S BLUNDER:  Borland's latest promo
     gimmick, the scratch & look contest to win a trip for the
     final races for America's Cup (just like
     Roy Rogers, etc.), sounds nifty. But, YO! What happens
     if you win? You fly down to Australia, get stuck in a town
     where prices are event inflated (a la L.A. Olympics), and
     get to watch the yacht race from the shore.

           Bunkie, as any affectionaido of yachting will tell you,
     there ain't nothing to watch on the shore, cuz all the yachts
     are 3 miles and 4 miles out running around. Maybe you get on
     a boat and cruise out there, but you won't see much, because
     Aussie ocean conditions are EXTREMELY choppy. Welcome to
     seasickness. I sure hope I don't win. And second prize, a
     Suziki pickup, doesn't quite float my boat as well; the
     Suziki is one UGLY vehicle.

           I think Mr. Kahn could have better spent his money on
     reaching out to user groups better, than pouring it into Yuppie
     sports like 12-meter sailing. It would help if the boat he's
     sponsoring won a race or two. Oh well, it is his money. We
     haven't seen Turbo "C" yet, either.

           I myself am going to get into the "dBASE goes gold"
     contest. First prize, a gold Porsche 944. Second prize, a trip
     for two to Las Vegas. Or a gold watch. For some odd reason,
     I find a trip to Vegas more appealing than to Australia. And

     I'd take a Porche over a Suziki pickup any day of the week...

           YOUR OPINIONS, GOSSIP, FEEDBACK, AND MONEY WANTED:  Send
     me your opinions and good gossip and I'll try to print the
     good stuff. I won't be at Comdex, but I suspect 97% of us
     "true users" won't be there either. I'm here at FIDO 109/74,
     or (301) 350-1437. No obscene phone calls, please.

                          FireNet Meets Echomail
                                    and
                          The Dream is Realized!


     I have been writing articles for FidoNews since early 1985. One
     of my goals, through these articles, has been to unite Fire and
     Rescue Departments through FidoNet and generate some kind of
     meaningful exchange of information. It has not been easy to get
     departments to join in for one reason of another.

     Many departments, only now, are becoming capable of supporting
     Fido systems. Those that can are beginning to understand the
     potential. Many others are unaware that Fido exists. It is my
     intention to keep at it until EVERYONE knows about Fido, et al,
     and the possibilities for mass communication of vital data (e.g.
     Hazardous Material warnings, equipment updates, program
     availability, conference notices, new services, etc.) within the
     Fire/EMS community.

     Toward that end, a NEW Echomail conference has been established.
     The FireNet Echo, hosted by Colorado's FireNet Leader (128/16),
     is a reality and available to any Node who wants to hook in.

     This Echo is available from 128/16 in the West and from 135/14
     in the East. It encompasses the following Nodes: 128/16, 135/14,
     104/610, 138/411, and 17/38. (Colorado's FireNet Leader, Metro-
     Fire Fido, DIVE_LINK, The Dalmatian and 65' North, respectively.)

     Anyone with an interest in the technical aspects of the Fire/EMS
     services is welcome to participate in this Echo. At the moment,
     we are discussing HazMat databases, hydraulic friction loss,
     wilderness Search & Rescue, and a new CHEMTREC service via
     modem to registered subscribers.

     If you or someone you know is involved in Fire or EMS, paid or
     volunteer, and has a PC and a modem and a desire to become part
     of a new idea in inter-departmental communications, please give
     them a copy of this article and have them call me or send Net
     mail to 135/14. If anyone would like an ARC containing all of my
     previous Fire-related articles to spread around to their local
     departments, let me know via Net mail and I will file-attach it
     to you as soon as I receive your request.

     If you prefer the U.S. Mail (and who would?), send requests to:

                             Christopher Baker
                             Metro-Fire Communications

     The Urgency of Moral Outrage
     By Bernard Lown, MD
     Co-President, International Physicians for the Prevention of
     Nuclear War (IPPNW)
     Fido 101/301, 101/302


     We live in an age when intelligent people defer judgment to self-
     described experts, even on issues that concern their very
     survival.  We have been conditioned to deny the evidence of our
     senses and to ignore the incontrovertible.

     We have been assured by experts that nuclear war will not happen.
     But the elementary laws of probability tell us that an annual
     risk of nuclear war, even as low as one percent, cumulates to a
     likelihood of 40% when projected over the expected lifespan of
     today's young people.  It is a statistical certainty that hair-
     trigger readiness cannot endure as a permanent condition.
     Ignoring the possibility of accident ascribes to man and his
     products a godliness that can never be achieved.

     The world has been spared catastrophe, but our good fortune is
     fragile.  Nuclear war is an accident waiting to happen.

     There is no dearth of warnings.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three
     Mile Island, Bhopal, Challenger, and Chernobyl are sharply etched
     vignettes of experience -- lessons, so to speak -- to educate us
     about the world's end.  We shall be given no more precise
     warnings.  We can only hope that the lessons will never be more
     concrete and tangible.

     The Trap of Deterrence

     For two years IPPNW has been calling for a cessation of all
     nuclear explosions.  The Soviet Union has responded with a year-
     long moratorium.  The United States has not reciprocated, a
     disappointment especially great for us American physicians.  Most
     informed commentators ascribe the US government's position to its
     desire to develop space weapons, which a test ban would retard.
     Few supporters of the plan speak of a total defense of the
     civilian population; the more pragmatic justify space weapons as
     necessary to strengthen deterrence.

     If we are to comprehend the threatened escalation in the nuclear
     arms race, we must examine its justification: the policy of
     deterrence.  In essence, this policy is based on the supposition
     that nuclear weapons, by threatening unacceptable damage,
     restrain undesirable actions by an adversary.  A number of
     illusions underlie this policy.

     First is the illusion of numbers.  If deterrence is the objective
     of military policy, what is the purpose in accumulating 50,000
     strategic and tactical warheads, equivalent in the aggregate to
     more than four tons of dynamite for every man, woman, and child?
     Why such a blatant exercise in redundancy?

     Fidonews                     Page 11                   1 Dec 1986


     A second illusion is the claim that nuclear weapons have
     conventional or political value.  But all such claims rest on a
     hidden premise of limited nuclear war -- an event as likely as an
     explosion restricted to the top third of a keg of dynamite.

     A third illusion is that deterrence has been a successful policy.
     It is commonly stated that the avoidance of war between the US
     and the USSR during the past 40 years is due to deterrence.  This
     unpersuasive assertion is not amenable to proof.  The two
     countries were not at war before the advent of nuclear weapons.
     They were, in fact, military allies.  They do not dispute each
     other's borders; they do not engage in significant commercial
     rivalries.  Fundamentally, of course, the argument that
     deterrence has prevented catastrophe fails irredeemably when it
     fails just once.  Any guarantee of peace with such a small margin
     of error is no guarantee at all.

     The Immorality of Deterrence

     On the basis of this policy of deterrence, responsible
     governments are targeting entire nations.  Everyone's home has
     become the front line.  Infants and the aged, the sick and the
     crippled are all targeted.  The irreplaceable artifacts of human
     history, the creative and artistic achievements of the ages will
     not be spared incineration.

     In the sorry recorded history of 5,000 years of endless wars,
     some limits had been set on human savagery.  Moral safeguards
     were raised to preclude the killing of unarmed civilians and
     health workers, the poisoning of drinking water, the incineration
     of open cities, and the spreading of infection.  But nuclear
     barbarism threatens in one stroke all these painfully won but
     limited constraints.  Total war -- unprincipled in method,
     unlimited in violence, indiscriminate in its victims, and
     uncontrolled in its devastation -- is now sanctioned military
     policy.  Deterrence is a suspended sentence of mass murder to be
     executed at any moment.  The idea of pointing nuclear missiles at
     entire nations is without precedent in moral depravity.  We
     fought Hitler to rid the world of genocide.  Have we defeated the
     enemy of mankind only to become infected with his immorality?

     The Need for Moral Outrage

     Information is not equivalent to knowledge, and possessing
     knowledge does not necessarily impart understanding.  Nor does
     understanding consistently stimulate the appropriate activity to
     achieve change.  The gap between cognition and involvement is
     frequently bridged by moral arousal.

     We physicians, guardians of health and life, have an ethical
     categorical imperative to expose the bleak immorality of the
     policy of deterrence.  We must not acquiesce to stockpiling
     weapons of mass extermination as the guarantors of national
     security.  We must not permit the search for peace to proceed
     through overt flirtation with death.  There are no conceivable
     circumstances which can justify the use of genocidal weapons.
     Fidonews                     Page 12                   1 Dec 1986


     We need the moral courage to go further.  We need to equate the
     possession of nuclear weapons with crimes against humanity.
     Would the building of thousands of gas chambers not be deemed
     repugnant to the laws of civilized society?  It is appropriate,
     from this podium in Germany, to call for activation of a new war-
     crimes process, a new Nuremberg, to begin to examine the
     violation of international law implicit in the stockpiling of
     instruments of genocide.

     Brooding over the nuclear threat for a quarter of a century now,
     I am led inexorably to the conviction that without exciting moral
     outrage among their intended victims, the dismantling of nuclear
     weapons will not succeed:  only unprecedented arousal of moral
     revulsion will provide the necessary spiritual energy.

     On VE day 1945, Norman Corwin delivered on radio his poetic
     drama, On a Note of Triumph.  I quote the last stanza:

     Lord God of test-tube and blueprint
     who joined molecules of dust and shook them 'til
     their name was Adam,
     Who taught worms and stars how they could live together,
     appear now among the parliaments of conquerors and give
     instruction to their schemes,
     Measure out new liberties so none shall suffer for his father's
     color or the credo of his choice,
     Post proofs that brotherhood is not so wild a dream as those who
     profit by postponing it pretend,
     Sit at the treaty table and convey the hopes of little peoples
     through expected straits,
     And press into the final seal a sign that peace will come for
     longer than posterities can see ahead,
     That man unto his fellow man shall be a friend forever.

     This article was from an excerpt of Dr. Lown's speech to the 6th
     IPPNW World Congress in Cologne, FRG. 6/86.

        MSG - a SysOp's message utility

     MSG is a program that allows the SysOp to read and modify
     messages from DOS.  Any part of the message may be changed.

     MSG works very similarly to FIDO.  You can invoke it with
     a chain of commands separated by spaces, and you can type
     a chain of commands at any of the program's prompts.  The
     program assumes an area change command to get it started,
     so to avoid the initial list of areas, you should type an
     area number as your first parameter.

     Example:  MSG 3 R 59 A P Q Q G
     Will select area 3, message 59, switch the state of PRIVATE,
     and exit the program.  Without the trailing "G", you would
     be presented with the MSG prompt, and allowed to continue
     by typing other commands to the program interactively.

     When you select "B" from the Message Reading menu, the body
     of the message is copied to MESSAGE.TXT in your main Fido
     directory, and the command "WS MESSAGE.TXT" is executed.
     The program is easily patched to change the WordStar command
     to that of a different editor.  After editing, MSG asks you
     whether or not you'd like to save the changes back into the
     message.

     The program doesn't need much documentation.  Typing "MSG ?"
     will give a quick syntax reminder.  Following are the help
     menus from the program:

          Message Command Help

          A = AREA change
          G = GOODBYE (quit MSG)
          K = KILL a message
          L = LIST of messages
          R = READ messages

          Message Reading Help

          Enter = read next/previous message
          # = read message number "#"

          + = read reply to this message
          A = change ATTRIBUTES of this message
          B = change BODY of this message
          K = KILL this message
          M = MODIFY this message
          N = read NEXT message
          P = read PREVIOUS message
          Q = QUIT reading messages
          ? = HELP (what you're reading)

     Cincinnati, Ohio
     513-662-5884

     For those sysops that list the nodediff/nodelist files, as well as
     the Fido Newsletter in a file area that is available for download
     by users, as well as other sysops in the area, there is a program
     that will allow you to automate this process from a batch file.

     For some time I have been looking for a program that would do a
     selective dos directory search in order to automate the updating
     of my file area that contains the latest Nodediff/nodelist files,
     as well as the weekly Fido newsletter.

     I have found a program that almost does that.  It is called
     files.com and it allows for a selective directory search and also
     allows for the insertion of a comment and then outputs the
     results to a file that can be copied, using DOS + command, into a
     revised files.bbs. This is all done from a batch file on specified
     days.

     The search command line that I use is as follows:

     files nodelist.a?? /x $f Friday - $d > save.txt

     This does a directory search for all nodediff.a?? files in the
     current directory and outputs to a file with the following
     result:

     NODELIST.A11  Friday - 11/07/86
     NODELIST.A04  Friday - 10/31/86
     NODELIST.A97  Friday - 10/24/86

     or,

     files nodediff.a?? /x $f week ending - $d > save1.txt

     NODEDIFF.A11  week ending - 11/07/86
     NODEDIFF.A04  week ending - 10/31/86
     NODEDIFF.A97  week ending - 10/24/86

     This can be done with the fidonews files with the same results
     and the output of each can be transferred into a revised
     files.bbs using the copy command. Or, if you wish, the output can
     be directed into files.bbs if that is all you have in a
     particular file area.

     The program allows for sub-directory searches, so you can execute
     from anywhere you wish.

     For those who would like to have the program w/docs, it can be
     picked up at 108/64 using SEAdog, or you can call, however
     registration is required so it will involve two phone calls.

     For SEAdog pickups, request files2.arc.  For callers, look in

     Daniel Tobias
     Soft Fido, 380/2

     This is a contrary viewpoint to the views expressed by Joe
     Lindstrom in a recent FidoNews on the subject of "open" systems.

     My system, Soft Fido, has been in operation for about five months
     now, and is entirely open.  No special registration is required,
     and there is no mandatory questionnaire.  I have not adopted a
     specific policy regarding the use of "handles", either pro or
     con.

     The results seem to be entirely opposite to the experience of Mr.
     Lindstrom.  The vast majority of my users log in with their
     correct names, and there have been no cases thus far of people
     posting abusive or "obscene" [however you might define such a
     vague term] messages.  One or two people have posted messages
     offering or soliciting pirated software, but when I inform them
     that it is not Soft Fido's policy to promote such illegal
     activity, these people have cooperated by ceasing to use my
     system to post such messages.

     A minor handful of people have logged in under phony names, but
     they seldom call back again; I guess there isn't much on my
     system to interest such people.  I do have a large number of
     regular callers, many of whom have answered the voluntary online
     questionnaire and provided their address and telephone number.
     These users have participated in stimulating discussions in the
     message sections, and contributed numerous uploads to the file
     sections.  They also enjoy the online games I provide in the
     OUTSIDE section; since I have an online scoreboard giving running
     scores, it is in their best interest to log in under their
     correct names so their name will show up as system champion.

     There have been a few extremely minor abuses of the open
     policies; a couple of people have logged in under multiple names
     to evade the daily time limits when doing extensive downloads.
     However, nobody (to my knowledge) has attempted to crash the
     system, or post abusive messages in other people's names, or such
     things which are the reason why so many other boards have had to
     adopt restrictive access policies.

     I hope this continues, and I don't intend to restrict access
     unless and until it is forced on me by flagrantly-abusive users.
     Cumbersome registration requirements are a hassle to user and
     sysop alike, and make it particularly hard on long-distance
     callers (such as those who call to download the Fido utilities I
     have written, and announced the availability of in another
     FidoNews article), since they must then call at least twice (once
     to register, another time to actually use the system, and
     possibly several other times in between to check and see if
     they've been upgraded yet.)

     I like to take a general view that people are reasonable and
     moral; it's only a few "bad apples" that make trouble.  It is a
     shame when everybody's freedom must be curtailed due to the
     Fidonews                     Page 20                   1 Dec 1986


     actions of a few.  I think there are better ways to keep a BBS
     from degenerating into childishness than to adopt rigid access
     policies; if you set an intelligent tone to the system from the
     start through such matters as your choice of message and file
     areas, the tone of your editorials and bulletins, et cetera, you
     will attract the kind of users who appreciate your interests, and
     the morons who prefer childish bickering and harassment of each
     other will stay away from your system and use other systems more
     receptive to their sort of thing, regardless of what access
     policies are followed.

     Watts lines have been used primarily by large corporations for
     cheaper rates on volume long distance calls.

     This is a program that takes average telephone users and combines
     their usage to obtain volume rates.

     WHY -

        The divestiture of ATT has given other companies the
     opportunity to compete with ATT for long distance phone service.
     Many companies have done so.  The company that I am dealing with
     offers unrestricted, (in the United States, except Alaska), long
     distance phone service for $100.00 per month.  Most of the other
     long distance companies are asking you to choose them or ATT.
     Our service is saying keep your present long distance carrier and
     also have this, now you have two long distance choices.  For
     heavy long distance users (like we SysOps) this is inexpensive
     because we use state of the art equipment, access low cost lines,
     and maximize usage.  This is a supplement, not an alternative.


        I am sure you are asking about long distance rates within your
     state.  Well, presently our service offers INTRA-STATE long
     distance for the following states;

     Arizona               Colorado              Delaware
     Fidonews                     Page 22                   1 Dec 1986


     Dist. of Columbia     Hawaii                Idaho
     Michigan              Montana               New Hampshire
     North Dakota          Oklahoma              Pennsylvania
     Rhode Island          South Dakota          Tennessee
     Texas                 Utah                  Virginia

     ....With many more on the way!  While you wait for your state, you
     can still call anywhere outside your state (unlimited).


     ACCESS -

        Upon receipt of your application your personal access code
     will be issued.  To access our service you only need dial an 800
     number then your personal access code.  It is very important that
     you keep your access code personal!


     BILLING

        Our service does not send bills.  When you become a customer,
     you may (if you wish) sign up for the Check-O-matic plan.  Your
     $100.00 monthly long distance phone bill will automatically be
     deducted from your account and you will not have to worry about
     forgetting the payment and losing the service.  Check-O-matic
     deductions are made the 15th of each month. Otherwise payment may
     be made by the 24th of the preceeding month by mail.


     What a deal, huh?  There is more.....

        Our service is a new company that will not spend money on
     advertising.  They use the most effective and least expensive
     form of advertising.  "WORD OF MOUTH" (OR COMPUTER TERMINAL!).
     For people who know friends or relatives who would be interested
     in their long distance phone rates, our service offers and
     incentive program that enables participants to profit from
     commissions.  THERE IS NO COST FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE MARKETING
     PLAN.


     HOW -

        For each new customer who purchases our service, you will
     receive a $25.00 commission each month that customer
     participates.  For example, if you sign up four people for our
     phone service, you would receive 4 x $25.00 ($100.00), per month,
     during their participation.  You would still have to pay your own
     $100.00 bill for your long distance service but you would receive
     a seperate commission from us for $100.00.  IN EFFECT, your long
     distance calls would be at NO COST.

        We have designed a marketing plan so that you can earn even
     MORE commissions.  If the first four people you sell the service
     also sell the service to others, you receive a $5.00 commission
     for each additional participant each month they continue the
     Fidonews                     Page 23                   1 Dec 1986


     service.  This $5.00 bonus plan pays down through 5 levels*

     *Where payment through more than a specified number of levels is
     prohibited by state law, payment will be made only to the levels
     permitted by such law.


     EXAMPLE -

             You sell       Mike      $25.00       Level 1

             Mike sells     Tom       $ 5.00             2

             Tom sells      Ken       $ 5.00             3

             Ken sells      Vick      $ 5.00             4

             Vick sells     Bill      $ 5.00             5

             Bill sells     Richard   $ 5.00             6


     You may offer this program to as many people as you choose.


     You are saying "What's the catch?"  There isn't one!!  And even
     if you don't sell it to anyone, $100.00 per month long distance
     is still the best deal around!

     Ken McVay
     Fido 340/20


                         Let's Lease a Satellite!

     As a new Fido SysOp, I tend to read my MAILER.LOG a lot. I am
     part of CanWest Net, and am located 36 cents-a-minute North of
     my Host, DataWest (340/10) in Victoria, British Columbia. My
     routing calls for SCANMAIL just prior to the NMW; I collect my
     mail, send it to Victoria, and pick up inbound. Well after NMW,
     I poll 340/10 for mail received from the other nodes, and for
     inbound from outside the Net. The log tells me that polling my
     host is a relatively expensive proposition. Typical connects
     run from 1.5 to 4.0 minutes, even if no packet is received. I
     assume this has something to do with the polling process, as
     NMW connects are rarely in excess of 20 seconds, unless files
     are attached. In the real world, it means an extra expense of
     about $30.00 a month, just to get the echo's on time.

     As I have come to devote more and more time to Fido, I have
     begun to realize that there are thousands of hard-working,
     dedicated people slaving away to improve and expand the net.
     It would appear, from my point of view, that all of this effort
     has yielded spectacular results. A system has been created that
     may very well grown into the most significant communications
     network on the planet; as the low-cost benefits from mass-
     production bring more powerful and more advanced tools within
     range of those hard-working people, the costs of the services
     they provide will go down, and the service will expand.

     Satellite communications channels have been a fact of life for
     our culture for a long time. The profusion of satellite
     receiving stations in the back yards of homes and offices is
     just a beginning - wait until they're only $1.99 at K-Mart, and
     then watch the frantic conversion from cable TV! Commercial
     use of these satellites is commonplace - the evening TV News
     is evidence of the quality possible, if you've got the money.

     What's this all have to do with my MAILER.LOG? I propose that
     we begin to gather data relating to both the cost of leasing
     commercial satellite channels, and of building our own XMT/RCV
     earth stations. One friend suggests that a station capable of
     utilizing commercial satellite channels could be built for very
     little more than the cost of my pc - about $3000.00. As they
     sell in the $20,000.00 range, I have my doubts.

     I would like to alleviate these doubts, and GET THE FACTS. I
     would rather, if the price was right, forget the phone and zap
     the satellite with my own transmitter. If Fido's Regional
     Co-ordinators utilized such technology first, with the Hosts
     following next, I wonder how long it would take before we could
     forget our late-night routings and communicate whenever we
     damned-well pleased via satellite. I would be happy to serve as
     a clearing house for data. (If there is an EchoMail conference
     already, my apologies - just tell me how to link - if there

          Well,  it  seems  that certain segments of FidoNet do not like my
     assessment  of  them  as Shareware users, while other segments seem to
     agree 100%.

          First  for  the disapprovers......  You are definitely a MINORITY
     of  ONE.   I  mean out of all the responses I got you are the ONLY one
     that  seemed  to  think I was personally attacking you!  Why?  I would
     name  you  here  but I feel that you should remain anonymous since you
     feel  that  my  referring  to  persons  who use something they did not
     purchase  was  a  personal attack on you.  I will only say that of the
     marketing  studies  that  were returned to Mr. Presnell by persons who
     tried  FidoUtil  that  your  area/net was the 3rd largest response.  I
     seem  to  think  that  there  is  more  to  your  flame  then  you are
     admitting,  but  then  again maybe not.  In either case the old saying
     he  who  denies  it the most is usually the guiltiest of the bunch (or
     something  like  that).  The breakdown of responses for FidoUtil is as
     follows:

            1)   California  had the most responses with NO registrations.
            2)   New York had the second highest total with 1 registration
            3)   Colorado had the third highest response (none registered)
            4)   3 states tied  with 2 registrations among the three
                 Florida, Georgia, Tennessee

          Now  for  the  remark you made in your message to me about my not
     paying  for  the  program myself....I TRIED TO but the author declined
     my  money  and  registered  my  copy  as a way of saying thanks. I had
     written  the review and sent the $$$ before it ever hit FidoNews and I
     got  my  check  back  from  him by return mail 3 days after the review
     came  out.   I did go you one better... I at least TRIED !  You stated
     that  to  your  knowledge there was no one using FidoUtil in your net.
     Well  I  will take this on faith as true since I have no need to doubt
     you  at this time. I was assuming that out of the 497 responses to the
     marketing  study  that  Mr.  Presnell got back that about 50% of those
     were  one  time only runs.  This would leave about 250 or so that used
     the  program  more  then once and about 20% of this figure could still
     be  using  the  program.  This would mean that somewhere out there are
     50  persons  using  FidoUtil on their system (this is 10% of the total
     response)  of  those  only 5 are now registered.  This means that only
     1%  of  the  total response decided the program was worth anything.  I
     find this HARD TO BELIEVE, NAY IMPOSSIBLE !!!!!

          I  have  received  one  response  from  a sysop that specifically
     stated  that  he did not use FidoUtil after trying it out.  He decided
     Fidonews                     Page 27                   1 Dec 1986


     that  waiting  for  updates to the individual modules was too much for
     him,  which is by the way a very good reason.

          I  received  10  responses  from  others praising me for my stand
     (although  one  said that he agreed with my idea but said I picked the
     wrong program to flame about).

          So  it seems that the ONLY negative response was from someone who
     decided  that I was attacking HIS integrity personally.  All I can say
     to you is this:

          If the shoe fits wear it !!!!!

          I  am  a  staunch  supporter  of  the  ShareWare concept and will
     continue  to  support it any way I can. I might not be able to send as
     much  as  I  would  like to for the programs I use but I will at least
     send  something  which  is  more  then  most shareware authors expect.
     From  what  I  can  see most shareware authors decide on the front end
     that  there  will be absolutely no return on their investment and thus
     are totally shocked when they do receive any funds back.

     Again responses welcome.....

     P.S.   this  is  to the one disagreeing comment I got in FidoMail....I
     have  done  a  little  checking  and  find  that  this is not my first
     contact  with you.  I also had contact with you on another program and
     got no reply at all.

                         Coordinator Ramblings XXIV


     Don't let them tell you any different; the inside of one hotel is
     no different than  any  other  hotel.  I  spent  the  weekend  in
     Nashua,  New Hampshire, smoking too many cigarettes, drinking too
     much coffee,  and raising my voice in discussion too many  times,
     and  still have no mortal idea what New Hampshire and Boston look
     like.  We left the hotel for a grand total of two hours in  three
     days,  other than the drive to and from the airport.  And I think
     I was suppose to say "Am I having fun yet?"

     Anyhow,  I am ahead of schedule (for the first time in six days).
     As  I  mentioned  in  my last Ramble,  I was going to the BY-LAWS
     Committee meeting in Nashua,  New Hampshire over the  weekend  of
     Nov 7 through 9.  I spent close to twelve hours getting from here
     to  there,  and  thought  I  was  probably  the last to arrive on
     Thursday night.  As Ken Kaplan and I wandered  around  the  hotel
     together,  we  discovered  we  were probably the first to arrive.
     (Hint - don't try  to  find  anything  to  eat  in  Nashua  after
     midnight  unless you have a car.  No pizza deliveries.  Hotel bar
     closed down,  and forget the restaurant.) When the first wave  of
     late  arrivals was over,  we commenced to gather in fellowship (a
     nice way of saying I stayed up until after 4 am drinking beer and
     talking. I don't know when the rest of them gave up, but think it
     wasn't much later).

     Friday started out with a dull thud.  By the time  people  rolled
     out  of  bed and finished breakfast (lunch for the early risers),
     we were almost ready to begin.  We set up a suite and  began  our
     attempt at figuring out exactly what we were there to do.  I know
     it  sounds  easy  to  say  we were going to formulate Articles of
     Association and a set of By-Laws,  but that  is  really  an  over
     simplification.   Believe  it  or  not,  we  spent  a  whole  day
     'defining' what we were to do,  set up our  draft  agenda  and  a
     proposed By-Law outline.  We used a dual monitor PC and MAX Think
     (tm) to brainstorm our goals, desires and objectives.

     Friday  night  was  a nice dinner (the one trip out of the hotel)
     and a little more socialising in the evening as the rest  of  the
     crew  arrived.  We  felt  we had laid out a good set of plans for
     the next day.  It was really kind  of  funny  because  we  really
     hadn't accomplished that much,  but then again, we had progressed
     with leaps and bounds,  and everyone was riding high over what we
     had done.

     Saturday  began  much quicker and went a lot longer.  Now was the
     day to fill in the MAX Think Outline and  argue  all  the  points
     raised while building the outline.  Tempers were short,  but good
     natured.  We were constantly reminded there was  a  rule  stating
     that  if a person lost their sense of humor,  they would be taken
     to the fourth story roof and thrown off.  Dinner came, but almost
     slipped us by as we refused to take a break and loose the head of
     steam we had built up.  We were simply cooking down the road, and
     Fidonews                     Page 29                   1 Dec 1986


     continued to do so on into the night.

     In the mean time, the Fido Standards Committee was meeting in the
     suite next door.  They would occasionally wander over to our room
     for a refill on a soda or a  cold  beer,  but  would  leave  very
     shortly thereafter with some comment about being techie's and not
     being  able to handle the politicians.  Personally,  I took those
     comments as insults,  but after sitting in on their meeting for a
     couple  of  minutes,  I  was  happy  to  be labelled a politician
     because I certainly had no idea what they were talking about.

     Another long night Saturday, and an early start on Sunday because
     we had more to finish before meeting flights at  the  airport.  I
     couldn't  believe it when we started taking the equipment down 10
     minutes before we were required to checkout.  We  could  actually
     take it down and not move it over the Bob Hartman's apartment and
     set it up for more last minute things.  We were finished with our
     task.

     And  what  did  we  do?  Gosh,  I  don't  know how to put it in a
     nutshell other than to reference you to a file;  IFNA1109.ARC  (I
     am  ROBOTing  it  to all Region 17 HOSTs this evening and have it
     posted on my System in File Area #1 - will move to Area #5  later
     in the week).  The files are the major products of our weekend in
     New  Hampshire.   This  is  a  proposal  package  that  has  been
     presented to the  Board  of  Directors.  We  were  not  in  total
     agreement on everything,  and minority opinions are being written
     at this time.  In fact,  we had hoped they would be available for
     inclusion.  YOU  are  encouraged  to  comment  on  what you read.
     (Constructive  comments,  not  just  a  rash  of  FLAMES).  These
     comments  should  be  forwarded to Randy Bush (122/6).  Or if you
     choose, and desire an open forum,  you may enter your thoughts in
     the IFNA ECHO.  This is the ECHO that was started for the members
     to discuss the By-Laws and policy matters.  Who and why it turned
     into  a basket weaving circle,  is beyond me and I shall stay off
     that subject this go around.

     I will be happy to try and attempt to answer any  questions  that
     people  have,  but  before you ask,  PLEASE READ the documents we
     have  presented.   I  believe  I  remember  everything  that  was
     presented,  but then again I have read, and reread the darn thing
     so many times over the weekend,  and  was  involved  in  so  many
     changes,  I  seriously doubt I really know what it says any more.
     I think I need a day or two to sort it out,  then I will read  it
     again.

     However,  I  am comfortable with what was presented to the Board.
     I don't believe any one person dominated the group or  forced  us
     to  go  in  one  direction  or  the other.  It was simply a joint
     effort of a group of individuals who were  looking  out  for  the
     interests  of others.  It was neat to watch people push different
     items as far as possible to see what the long range ramifications
     were for each statement.  We believe we  have  have  presented  a
     document that will service our needs now, as well as for the next
     few years.

     Now  it  is  up  to YOU TO VOTE.  EDUCATE yourself on the issues.
     DISCUSS them rationally with others  in  the  IFNA  ECHO  without
     destructive flames.

     Yawl have a GREAT week.

                          NY MetroNet System Crash

     During the weekend of Nov. 16, the inbound Host system for the
     New York Metropolitan area (Net 107) had a head crash.  The
     system has finally been restored as of the backup of October 27.
     However, all files for the host since that date and all messages
     in-transit at the time of the crash have been lost.

     It is suggested that you re-send any transmissions which you feel
     may have been affected.
