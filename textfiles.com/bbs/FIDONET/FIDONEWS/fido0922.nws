Another week, another Snooze.

Today I'm trying out what will be the routine for the next month;
generating FidoSnooze by calling into my BBS with my nice old Tandy
200 and my original U.S. Robotics Courier 2400. Futuristic high-tech
of the past. I want to make sure this set up will work.

For the entire month of June, I'll be in the rainy Northwest. I should
be back in time for Gay Pride Week here is San Fran. (Last weekend of
June.) (Why the last weekend in June? To commemorate the 1969
Stonewall Rebellion, a spontaneous response to police harrassment, and
the start of the modern gay liberation movement.)

I swear this won't be a political editorial.

(It's also simply a fun weekend -- 300,000 people downtown San
Francisco, culminating a week of events. There are even --gasp--
straight people there. Check it out.)

OK, I'll shut up now.


                             * * * * *

Anyhoo, FidoNews. More specifically, article submissions. Now,
ARTSPEC.DOC notwithstanding, I'm pretty loose on article format. I
cleanup two or three articles a week that are simply the wrong format.
This is done as a personal favor, me to you.

I won't be able to do this this month. Articles better be acceptable
as-is, or they will not be included in FidoNews until I return, and
can properly reformat them.

See, "locally" I use MATE, (stands for Mike Aronson's Text Editor), an
ugly little beast that does everything that BRIEF does, 'cept windows,
and is only 25,000 bytes long (not a typo). OK, so the macro language
is a bit ugly. I'm using version 4.00, from 1983. (Never found a
reason to upgrade.)

With MATE I can do anything to the random-format files that come in
pretending to be articles.

With the Tandy 200's editor, I can't do that much, and it line-wraps
at 40 columns. Plus, I have to download each article, edit them
offline, then upload. Not pretty. (At least I have XMODEM. If you have
a Tandy 200 and want a "real" terminal program, call my BBS and check
out the TANDY 200 MODEM directory.)

FidoNews 9-22                  Page 2                       1 Jun 1992


I will keep on top of things, but not at my usual near-daily rate,
probably only once a week. The other editor (Tim Pozar, 1:125/555,
remember him?) can kick and strangle my BBS should it drop dead.

Other than a few poorly-formatted paragraphs, you shouldn't notice any
difference...

        BROTHERHOOD MANIFEST BETWEEN TWO EUROPEAN NETS
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FidoNet  is an amateur,   non-profit organization dedicated to
electronic  mail interchange in a worldwide scale;   such   an
organization  can  be  a immensely  powerful medium for  human
relations and for common efforts in order to make peoples live
in  peace.  SysOps in West Siberian Net (2:5000) and Catalonia
Net (2:343)  are fully aware of this fact and want to use this
mean to make a declaration which will state clearly their will
of peace and freedom.

As a peaceful and goodwilling gesture, taking the example from
lots of towns and cities all over the world,  SysOps  in 2:343
and  2:5000    have  decided to make  a  brotherhood   binding
between their Nets;  the technical or administrative effect of
such a declaration is null: it is only to state a common will,
hope and objective. In order to maintain this objective alive,
they  are going to celebrate periodical meetings in each  Net,
as  synchronized  as circumstances will allow;   during  these
meetings,   SysOps in each Net will make a toast for the other
Net.   When economical  circunstances  allow it,  it would  be
possible  to create  a  common echo routed between both  Nets;
currently,   there  is  a periodical link between the NCs with
local news exchange.

             THE FIDONEWS VERSION LIST IS CHANGING AGAIN
             -------------------------------------------

Like I didn't have enough to do. Alas, it's time to once again take on
yet another task. This one is a bit more complicated than many other
aspects of FidoNet, at least from an administrative standpoint. The
FidoNews software version list is being rehashed, rebuilt,
restructured, and re anything else you can think of.

 There are numerous problems which need be considered. One of the
largest the mere fact that much of the software currently listed is
not supported by folks reachable via FidoNet or even other FTN
channels, so updates regarding these software packages seem to come
from less than 100% reliable sources. Update information should,
whenever possible, be submitted directly by the author, and software
authors ought to keep in mind the version list when updating or
releasing their software. I even came across several programs in the
old version list that are no longer supported by the original
publisher, and because of this it doesn't make much sense to continue
to list it.

 Of course with every new list keeper there's a new procedure for data
submission and revision. It was my conclusion that this process was
traditionally dealt with completely manually, and there was no way I
was going to keep that tradition going - there are just too many
programs out there, and too much room for error.

 So, I drafted specs on a new method of version list data submission
whereby software authors and/or their representatives could submit new
items and/or updates and know that they would be processed as
submitted, and receive a receipt of their submission. In addition, the
version list output will be significantly different than it has been
in the past. This is one aspect of the project that hasn't gotten as
much attention yet as the data collection process has, so some
experimentation, along with the collection of opinions of the authors
and/or readers themselves, will eventually bring us a regular
publication routine.

     So how does this all work now?  Simple, actually.

                    DISTRIBUTION METHODS
                    --------------------

                       F. FreeWare
                       S. ShareWare
                       C. Commercial
                       O. Other
                       U. Unknown *

*   U)nknown will automatically be assigned to all software
    during conversion from the existing Version List files
    unless currently listed as Commercial. Since most of
    these categories are new ones, authors should update the
    listings for their software.

Much of the information on presently listed software would
be considered incomplete based on these new standards.
Authors of software who find that their listings are
incomplete should make every effort to update their listings
as soon as possible for the benefit of those who might rely
on the Version List's information.  Also, past practice has
maintained listings for software not directly related to or
written by members of FidoNet.  Submisssion and update data
FidoNews 9-22                  Page 7                       1 Jun 1992


will be accepted by third parties for this software until
such time as a more reliable updating method is devised.

Submissions received which fail to meet the above technical
standards will not be processed.  All submissions, whether
accepted or not, will be automatically acknowledged via
netmail if the submission was properly addressed.

Because the traditional method of weekly publication of an
abbreviated version of the complete versions list in every
issue of FidoNews seems very tedious and only serves to
weaken the publication's possible importance and usefulness,
a new publication method will be adopted.

The FidoNews version list will be published as an weekly,
rotating, incremental reference list.  This means that more
information per software product will be published in every
issue, but the software category being published from week
to week will change.  Initially some of the experimentation
with this publication method may cause some minor confusion,
but hopefully that confusion will clear up rather quickly,
or at least soon after the editor's does.  However, the
initial publication of the list will be a complete one.
This will allow authors to update their information quickly,
before the next publication of their software's information.

In addition, authors of listed software may find that having
their software available at the Version List editor's system
may help make their programs more available to those who may
be interested in them.  As will be determined by the
response rate, if enough authors of any given software
products find any added value by having the system which
updates the Versions List maintain the LATEST and greatest
published version of their programs, they can directly
submit a redistributable copy of their product, or its
information file if the software cannot be made available
due to its primary distribution method.  These submissions
should include netmail authorizing redistribution.

The submitted programs and information files will be made
available for 24 hour file request by anyone at all, and
downloadable on the system maintaining the versions listing.
Software and/or information files available via this channel
will be noted as such within the published version list.

This comprehensive version listing, accompanied by the
software and/or information file relating to the software
could pose as a valuable resource to those who have trouble
finding what they are looking for as well as to the authors
of the software used by FidoNet.  New software versions will
always replace older ones.  No replaced version will remain
available once replaced with a newer release.

FidoNews 9-22                  Page 8                       1 Jun 1992


The complete Version List will be available for FTN file
request and download on at least 1:107/323@FidoNet, HST/V32,
reachable at 1-908-247-8252.  If other systems duplex the
file library, their addresses and telephone numbers will be
publised along with the Version List.  The magic request
filename for the complete Version List will be VER-LIST.

Other listings will be published as well.  These listings
will be formatted in different ways and cross-referenced to
each other somehow.  Details on this needs some work yet,
and announcements will be made as the report generators are
completed and the files become available.

If any author remains with questions regarding the Version
List, s/he should feel free to contact the version list
editor, Fabian Gordon, at 1:107/323@FidoNet.

If any author or reader of the Version List feels additional
data fields should be maintained or if a new report format
is in order, contact should be made with the editor at the
same address.  All suggestions will be considered.

If you know of any program which has been updated but not
reflected on the Version List, please contact the author.
DO NOT contact the Version List editor yourself.

Well, it took a while to get this whole procedure ready, but
I suspect it was worth the wait considering the scope and
diversity of the Version List and its information.  I most
certainly hope you find the information presented in a
coherent and useable format.

80XXX: The assembly language programming echo

You've been meaning to learn assembly language for the longest
time, but you thought it was too cryptic and hard to learn? Or you
couldn't figure out which of those darned segment registers to
use, so you gave up? Maybe you are nervous about learning the hex
and binary number systems? Or perhaps you're interested in
programming the latest DoWop Industries' UltraWarpGraphics SVGA
card with a HyperRAMDAC and a SCSI interface to your Cuisinart?
Then I think the 80XXX echo is for you.

The 80XXX echo was started ages ago by G. Adam Stanislav, who was
the original moderator. I'm now the latest in a long line of
moderators (I'm the second <g>). It's a great little echo, I learn
something new almost everyday. The average number of messages at
the moment is about 30/day. It is definitely available on the Zone
1 backbone, and I've also seen it available from Zone 2 Isreal,
FidoNews 9-22                  Page 9                       1 Jun 1992


Zone 2 Europe, and Zone 3 Australia.

You might get the idea (probably from the name, 80XXX) that this
is an Intel-only club. Though that was the original purpose of the
echo, it is now much more generalized. I don't think there are any
other forums devoted to assembly language for any other CPU
platforms, so the topic of discussion is being opened up to all
forms of assembly language. There are discussions going on
presently about assembly language on the Z80 (CP/M), 6502 (Apple
II, C64, Atari, etc.), and even various embedded controllers, just
to give you an idea.

Even if you're not a programmer, you'll find the echo useful. Ever
wondered if Windows is 32 bit software? If OS/2 2.0 is 32 bit
software? Desqview? Ever wondered what 32 bit software really is?
We can help you sort these questions out. As the technology
advances, it's important that you as a consumer know exactly what
they mean in simple terms. Otherwise, we'll all be repeating the
folly of our ancestors from the 1950's who thought the tailfins on
their cars were actually aerodynamic stabilizing devices! They
understood something about aerodynamics, but not enough to be
skeptical. The marketeers ran them over.

We won't tell you what to buy. (And please don't ask us, it's
offtopic <g>). However, we can probably explain how it works. And
you can decide from there.

Oh, and please note, I brought up the names of specific operating
systems up there. However the bashing of operating systems is
strongly discouraged here, we're here to learn about the services
that these operating systems provide. So comparisons between

Even in this age of higher and higher level languages, assembly
language is still needed to accomplish the tasks the high level
languages forgot about, or what they don't do well. Assembly is
also what gets you close enough to your machine for you to
understand its limits or its capabilities that you never knew
about.

An echo has been circulating to a few FidoNet systems, and I posted a
message regarding the echo in a FidoNews back about 5 weeks ago.
I thought I would drop one more article just in case anyone missed
it.

The echo is called DR_DOS.  It is for any person who uses the
operating system developed by Digital Research called DR DOS.

If you would like to receive this echo, please contact one of the
following persons:

Cal Gardner    1:247/99
David Graham   1:399/9 ..or..
Chris Grainger 1:163/518.

This echo is open to all.

    The "PET_FORUM" Echo

I would like to introduce to you, the PET_FORUM echo!  To be moderated
by one Rodney Harper, our local HerPETologist.  Now I give you Rod.

Hello, I will be the moderator of this fine forum.  Basically, this
forum is open to discussion for anything pet related.  Whether you like
Dogs, Cats, Birds, Fish, Reptiles, Goats to Gnu, you are welcome here.

Just to give you a little history about me:

I have worked as a freelance collector for many zoo's and public aquariums
over the years, and have traveled to many countries.  My specialty is fish,
and actually North American native fish are my fancy.  At present I am back
in school trying to get that Biology degree, and am working on several
research projects concerning endangered and threatened species of fish and
invertabrae.

I have a Dog, and a few cats, some tame squirrels that live in the yard,
along with a few other small mammals that like to call my yard home.  I
have a small colony of brown bats that live in my barn, and they have
become accustom to me and like to mess around with us at night while
sitting out under the oaks while BBQ'ing.

Other than that, I guess I am a nature freak, and love to get out in the
woods. Living on the Alabama Gulf Coast, I also spend a lot of time in the
boat, and out on some of the barrier islands of the Mississippi sound
watching birds and collecting fish.

Well, that's me... what about you ?

Rod!  What about those Pet snakes, or better known as serpents...<G>

PET_FORUM is the Echo tag name.  The current participants are 6 nodes
within the Gulf_Coast_Net 3625@fidonet.org.  This area was recently
gated to EggNet via 1:3625/455@fidonet.org
