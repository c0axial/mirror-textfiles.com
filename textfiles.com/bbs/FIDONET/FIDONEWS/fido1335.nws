     First, I'd like to say thanks to everyone who works for FidoNet and
     FidoNews by making their personal resources available to everyone at
     no charge and just for fun. Several people have contributed assistance
     to FidoNews this week and they should be lauded by one and all.

     jim barchuk's HTML FidoNews reading and archive page on the Internet
     is now operating 24 hours a day. If you'd like to wander over and read
     FidoNews in HTML format, go to:

                        http://www.geocities.com/athens/6894

     and you can sift through the weekly Issue by individual articles in
     the comfort of your web browser. Thanks, jim!

     Ross Cassell has produced a nifty little utility called STRIPFF that
     will remove the formfeeds from FidoNews [or any other text file] for
     those of you who want to put FidoNews up for online reading without
     having to manually edit out all those paging formfeeds inserted by the
     MAKENEWS program during FidoNews creation. His program is freeware and
     is available on his system, on this system, on the new FidoNews
     Homepage [more on that later], and was hatched into SDS area SOFTDIST.
     thanks, Ross!

     ALL of the FidoNews archives are always available on the Southern Star
     ftp site at:

                        ftp://ftp.sstar.com/fidonet/fidonews

     if you're ever in need of an old issue. See the listing at the end of
     every FidoNews Issue in the Masthead. Thanks, John!

     Thanks, too, to ALL the FidoNet Coordinators who take their
     responsibilities seriously and get FidoNews out to all their Nodes
     every week without fail! It is appreciated.

             Does Fido have an Echomail problem?

             I've been a member of FidoNet for many years.  I can
     remember a time when there was no cost recovery.  A time when there
     was less than twenty members in my net.  (look at it now)  I can
     remember when most people didn't have a clue what a BBS was.

             In the old days it wasn't unusual for mail polls to be
     infrequent.  But modem speeds have improved dramatically, cost
     recovery plans enacted, satellite systems built and the Internet
     has been harnessed.  It's not that expensive to have multiple
     polls a day.  So why do I go for whole weekends with no new,
     non-local mail?  And during the week I generally see one good
     mail bundle a day.  Let me back up a minute and discuss my
     echomail situation.  I have spent most of my FidoNet career in
     net280 in Kansas City, Missouri.  Net280 also has one of the North
     American Backbone star systems.  Recently I moved about 45 miles
     east to the little college town of Warrensburg and I became a PVT
     system.  I pull my mail feed via the Internet from 1:280/169.

             Does that seem strange to anyone?  I'm one hop off of
     one of the largest mail movers in North America and mail flow
     is inconsistent?  I'm not pointing fingers, Roy (/1) has given
     a lot to this net in the past.  Both as a previous NEC and as
     a star system.  But I have had many conversations with Brian
     (/169) and he swears that there is just no mail waiting when
     he polls.  This concerns me since it could indicate a problem
     in the future.

             So I wonder if we don't depend on Roy, John, and George
     just a little too much.  We have allowed mail distribution duties
     to grow beyond the capabilities of the average Fido hobbyist.  The
     last thing I would want to do is belittle what these guys have
     done for us in the past.  But what happened to the FidoNet of old
     where things were done in the most efficient, cost effective manner?
     It seems we could tackle a couple problems at the same time,
     inter-zone communication and alternative, free mail distribution,
     by getting a few volunteers to start hubbing mail through Internet
     Telnet and FTP sessions.  If you have an Internet account, the
     whole world is a local call.

             Comments anyone?  You've got my addresses.  Or better yet,
     write an article of your own.

             The Internet as an extension of Fido

             I know some of you will think that should be the other way
     around.  Especially if you are aware of the fact that the Internet
     is really just a group of smaller networks.  FidoNet has really
     been a part of the Internet for several years, we just choose to
     ignore it.  There have been Fido echos distributed as part of
     Usenet.  There are Fido nodes that you can Telnet into.  We try
     so hard to stay away from the Internet that we ignore what it
     has to offer.  An inexpensive means of bringing Fido's zones
     closer together.

             Many of you have heard me ramble about this before.  As
     a matter of fact, there is even another article from me in this
     issue of FidoNews.  But this time I want to make a proposal.  I
     would like to find some volunteers to work with me to put
     together a free mailer that would establish FidoNet mail sessions
     across TCP/IP via Telnet.

             I'm looking for programmers from various platforms that
     would be willing to contribute code to the project.  Once complete,
     the mailer would be released on several platforms with full source,
     similar to Binkley or GNU.

             Here's what I have to offer to the project.  I am a
     programmer.  But I'm just now getting around to learning C.  And
     since C is probably the only language that would allow real
     portability, that seems like the ideal development environment.
     Possibly something along the lines of GCC, since it is readily
     available on numerous platforms and can be used for free.  I have
     been a member of Fido for many years and know how a mailer
     functions.  I also have a great deal of code that I put together
     over the years for things such as; EMSI sessions, MSG and PKT
     formats, as well as a healthy protocol library.  Unfortunately,
     it's all in Pascal.  I have also been picking up my mail over
     the Internet using my normal mailer and VModem.  And that
     experience alone is enough to tell me that the project _could_
     be scaled down a little by just supporting EMSI with FTP
     transfers and leaving the rest out.  ZModem is just not real
     efficient over TCP.

             So, if you want more details or want to volunteer, you
     know how to get ahold of me.

     From Zone 4, Net 920, Node 65, Net Coordinator, Republic of Panama

     Hello from way down in Panama!! We are here! Really!!

     A current events brief of FidoNet in Panama:
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 5                   26 Aug 1996


     Hello FidoNet community!  Long before I was a SYSOP of a FidoNet BBS,
     I was a user.  I used to log onto FidoNet BBS's back in Dallas Texas
     in the mid to late '80's for programming conversations. I now work for
     the U.S. Navy and moved to Panama in '92.  Living on a U.S. military
     base overseas really has it's drawbacks.  One is that you give up what
     little you have of a life.  In order to keep in touch with my family
     and friends, and have some intelligent conversation I began calling
     BBS's again.  In '93 there were only a few FidoNet BBS's in Panama,
     and they could only afford to carry a couple of echos because they
     were pulling them via AT&T from Louis Oaken (Kudos Louis!) Florida!.
     I went ahead and built a BBS using Remote Access and Fmail and
     contributed my little bit to help out.  Later I discovered there were
     other software packages out there and purchased a good one, bought a
     mail tosser and began the slow process of registering all (well...
     most of my shareware).

     The history of FidoNet in Panama (we call it PanamaNet) is pretty
     short -and really pretty sparse.  We know that some guy started it
     back in the late '80's (I'd like to know who he was.. If you know
     please email me) and carried it over to Dave Dillard, who turned it
     over to Neil Armani, who turned it over to Jim Murphy and myself.

     The BBS users here in Panama are an unusual crowd.  I mean - some
     don't read or write English - so building bilingual menus is very
     important, and difficult if you don't know another language.  For the
     most part, the local users are either wealthy, students using school
     computers, or "gringos" (U.S. military).  Many of the user questions
     are in Spanish, so I had to invest in a translator.  Since there
     aren't many BBS's here, anything I did to better the BBS was viewed
     with awe.  The users raved and cheered when I purchased Searchlight
     BBS and created RIP graphics!  Pop up menus, etc. all in RIP. They
     thought that was the cat's meow.  Now with graphical www in Panama,
     people aren't easily amused by lights, bells and whistles.

     Zone 4 has *not* *provided* *any* *support* to speak of since I've
     been here. Gamey recently resigned, however the *only* time we EVER
     heard from him was during the elections <grin>.  If it weren't for
     Louis Oakin@sunshine.com we never would have been able to carry on
     FidoNet down here.  This last year the Republic of Panama has allowed
     some ISP's to move in.  This gave us a REAL opportunity to advance.
     Now we FTP our FidoNet Echo mail from SSTAR in Louisiana!  Since this
     wonderful advancement we have picked up about 40 echos ++ !!!  It's
     been a godsend. Using AT&T to get the mail really took a toll on us
     this last year.  The biggest problem that we have here in Panama is
     that most of the phone lines were built back in the 40's and 50's. We
     get better connections calling a BBS in the U.S. then we do calling
     next door!  So now that our packets are getting larger, it's getting
     difficult to distribute them.  And - to compound things -those of us
     who work for the military are only allowed one phone in our quarters
     (house).  We end up using phone switch boxes which makes users add
     ,,22,22,22 to the end of the phone numbers.  That is very difficult,
     because (inevitably) users don't get the string right and wake us up
     at 0300am.

     The BBS's here are mostly either American Military or Spanish Locals.
     The locals are mostly interested in Mexican Link - while the Americans
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 6                   26 Aug 1996


     are interested in all the echos.  For the most part, we all enjoy the
     conversations and connectivity.  The U.S. Military presence is leaving
     Panama as per the Treaty of the Panama Canal signed by Carter in the
     '70's.  We will all be out by the year 2000.  Once we are gone it will
     be up to the local BBS population to maintain a FidoNet presence in
     Panama.

     As for me, I'm leaving Panama in November.  I will be moving to
     Virginia Beach, Virginia.  I will revert back to being a BBS user and
     begin a new life as a Net Surfer.  Additionally I hope to work on some
     new FidoNet programming projects that I haven't had time for.

     I've been watching the BBS's close down as the Internet really picks
     up steam, and I really hope that FidoNet will adapt to the Internet.
     It would be nice to have a Front Door that could connect through
     internet service providers to other Front Doors on the net and pass
     mail back and forth.  It's really getting to the point where there is
     an internet connection almost anywhere.  I mean if we have it here in
     Panama......

     Two Choices: UPGRADE or DIE
     by Jon M. Craig <pazuzu@amphigory.com>, 1:201/0


     With all the talk in recent FidoNews issues about the impending death
     of FidoNet, I thought I should add my $.02 on the whole thing.

     As the title of this article suggests, we have two choices: UPGRADE
     or DIE.  What do I mean by this?  Well, quite simply, we need to move
     ourselves into the 90's as far as technology and ease-of-use goes.
     We need to be progressive, up-to-the-minute with technology.
     BinkleyTerm and Maximus just don't cut it in '96.  Today's users (and
     sysops) want advanced graphics, and easy-to-setup software.  And we
     need to make it easy for people to GET NODE NUMBERS!  Stop being
     elitist scum (and this is a generalization, but my experience, and
     that of most people I've talked bears it out).

     Using mail and news on the Internet is dirt simple with all the new
     graphical-based software available.  In contrast, the average BBS
     package used by a FidoNet sysop is quite clumsy and hard to figure
     out by comparison.  This is not necessary.  Sysops want to hold onto
     the BBS package they were running back in '85.  This is ridiculous -
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 7                   26 Aug 1996


     you don't still use the computer you used in '85, do you?  Then why
     use its software?  Even up-to-the-microsecond graphical BBS packages
     like Excalibur for Windows now have Fidonet capability.  There's even
     a fully Windows-based mailer that's NOT simply an old MS-DOS mailer
     with a Windows shell wrapped around it.  And how many such systems
     are in FidoNet?  To my knowledge, ONE -- Myself.  Why?  Yeah,
     BinkleyTerm works great.  So did my '286 back in '87, but...  This is
     1996.

     Even from a Sysop standpoint, joining FidoNet is difficult.  You've
     got to first figure out how the whole thing works, and there's NOT
     ONE SINGLE CREDIBLE DOCUMENT ON IT ANYWHERE!  And don't talk about
     the standards docs, either!  No human can decipher those.  Then
     you've got to assemble the eight million different programs you'll
     need to make it all happen.  Then you've got to find someone to give
     you a node number.  This should be easy.  It doesn't need to take any
     longer than 24 hours.  But it doesn't work that way.  Sometimes your
     NC won't get back to you within a week.  Sometimes he'll NEVER get
     back to you.  Sometimes you'll be told your BBS doesn't qualify for
     their "local standards of behavior", whatever that means.  We can't
     exclude people from FidoNet based on their personal beliefs, no
     matter how much we might disagree with them.

     The average person has this "hard-to-use-straight-ugly-ASCII-based"
     view of what FidoNet is, even if they've never used a FidoNet system.
     This has to be changed.  It doesn't suit people's tastes anymore.
     Even if you refuse to run Windows & a graphical BBS system, at least
     ditch your 5 year old copy of RBBS for something a little more
     up-to-date.  There's plenty of DOS-based ANSI system which use
     lightbar menus and such, which is light years ahead of where 95% of
     Fidonet systems are right now.

     The Internet is reaching critical mass.  The InterNic is running out
     of net numbers to give out.  Pretty soon, it'll be tricky to get your
     domain name registered, because it'll be already taken.  Usenet has
     become SPAM Central.  MLM's, Pyramid Schemes, 1-900 Sex Lines, that's
     all you see anymore.

     People won't put up with it for long.  Eventually, the only thing
     the SPAMmers will be able to SPAM to are OTHER SPAMMERS!  People will
     need somewhere else to talk.  Will it be FidoNet?  It could be.
     We've got a lot going for us.  We have message control.  Someone
     posts off-topic messages, *BAM* they get a warning.  Do it again,
     *BAM*, they're banned from the Echo.  Their Sysop doesn't comply,
     *BAM*, no mas node number.  You think AOL's gonna ban Mr. Joe
     Spamboy?  Hell no, he pays his bill!

     If we want to survive, though, we'll need to provide people with
     attractive, easy to use BBS's, and we need to make it DIRT SIMPLE for
     Sysops to get into the net.  All that's required is some
     documentation.

     In conclusion, as my title states, we've got two choices: UPGRADE or
     DIE.  Upgrade our software, upgrade our documentation, upgrade our
     technology, upgrade our acceptance procedures, or just shut the damn
     net down right now.

                                    Chapter 1

                                    OVERVIEW

     FidoNet  is  an  amateur electronic mail system.  As such,  all of its
     participants and operators are non-paid  volunteers.  From  its  early
     beginnings  as a few friends swapping messages back and forth,  it has
     now  grown  to  (June  1986)  over  1000  different  systems  on  four
     continents.

     FidoNet  is  large  enough that it would quickly fall apart of its own
     weight unless some sort of structure and control were imposed  on  it.
     Multinet  operation  provides the structure.  Decentralized management
     provides the control.  This document is an  attempt  to  describe  the
     procedures which have been developed to manage the network.

     1.1     The Levels of FidoNet

     With  the  introduction  of  multinet Fido in early 1985,  FidoNet has
     developed a hierarchical structure, with the following levels:

     o   The  international  coordinator;   The  international  coordinator
         compiles all of the  node  lists  from  all  of  the  regions  and
         networks  and  creates  the  master  node  list,   which  is  then
         distributed over the net.

     o   The  country  coordinator;   In  some  cases   the   International
         coordinator  will appoint a country coordinator to oversee network
         operations  in   a   given   country.   The   exact   duties   and
         responsibilities  of any given country coordinator are assigned by
         the international coordinator, and will not be discussed here.

     o   The regional coordinator;  The regional coordinator maintains  the
         list   of   independent  nodes  in  his  region,   and  encourages
         independents to  join  existing  nets  or  to  form  new  nets.  A
         regional  coordinator  does  not  perform routing services for the
         nodes in his region.

     o   The network coordinator;  The network coordinator  is  responsible
         for  maintaining the list of nodes for his net,  and for receiving
         and forwarding any mail coming to the net from outside.

     o   The network routing hub; Network routing hubs exist only in three-
         tiered  regional  nets.  They  generally  share some or all of the
         duties of the host,  in order to ease the management  of  a  large
         regional  net.  The  exact  duties and procedures are a matter for
         the network coordinator and his hubs to settle,  and will  not  be
         discussed  here.  The network coordinator is still responsible for
         the maintenance of the net.

     o   The system operator (sysop);  The sysop formulates his own  policy
         for running his board and dealing with his users, so that will not
         be discussed in this document.  However,  the sysop must also mesh
         with the rest of the FidoNet system if he is to send  and  receive
                        ____
         mail, and that will be discussed here.
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 11                  26 Aug 1996


     o   The  user;  Policy  and  procedures for the individual user on any
         given board is determined by the system operator  of  that  board,
         and will not be considered in this document.

                                    Chapter 2

                                SYSOP PROCEDURES

     A sysop of an individual node can pretty much do  as  he  pleases,  as
     long  as  he observes the mail events,  is not excessively annoying to
     other nodes on the net,  and does  not  promote  the  distribution  of
     pirated copyrighted software.

     National  Mail  Hour is the heart of FidoNet,  as this is when network
     mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a  part
                 ____
     of  FidoNet must be able to receive mail at this time.  A system which
     is a member of a regional network may  also  be  required  to  observe
     additional mail events, as defined by his network coordinator.

     Failure  to  observe  the proper mail events is sufficient grounds for
     any node to be dropped from the net without notice  (since  notice  is
     generally given by FidoNet mail).

     A system which has been  dropped  from  the  network  is  said  to  be
     ______________
     excommunicated (i.e.  unable to communicate).  A node which  has  been
     excommunicated may or may not be listed for a time in the "dog house",
     which is included in the comments at the end of the node list.  If you
     find  that  you  have  been excommunicated without warning,  then that
     means that your coordinator is  unable  to  contact  you.  You  should
     rectify the problem and report back.

     National  Mail  Hour  is  observed  from  0900  to 1000 GMT every day,
     weekends included.  In each of the  United  States  time  zones,  this
     would be as follows:

         Eastern Standard Time         4 AM to 5 AM
         Central Standard Time         3 AM to 4 AM
         Mountain Standard Time        2 AM to 3 AM
         Pacific Standard Time         1 AM to 2 AM
         Hawaii Standard Time         11 PM to Midnight

                    ___
     FidoNet  does  not  observe  daylight  savings  time.  In  areas which
     observe daylight savings time  the  FidoNet  mail  schedules  must  be
     adjusted  in  the  same direction as the clock change.  Alternatively,
     you can simply leave your system on standard time.

     2.1     How to get a node number

     You must first obtain a current node list,  so that you can send mail.
     You  do not need a node number to send mail,  but you must have one in
     order for others to send mail to you.

     The first step in obtaining a current node list is to  locate  a  Fido
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 12                  26 Aug 1996


     bulletin  board.  No  help  there;  you're on your own.  Most bulletin
     board lists include at least a few Fido systems,  and usually identify
     them as such, so this shouldn't be too hard.

     If  the  sysop  of any Fido system does not have a node list available
     for downloading, then he can probably tell you where to get one.

     Once you have a node list,  you must determine which network or region
     covers  your  area.   Networks  always  have  a  three  digit  number.
     Networks are more restricted in area than regions,  but are  generally
     preferred since they provide more services to their members.

     If  you  cannot  find a network which covers your area,  then pick the
     region which does.  Regions  always  have  a  two  digit  number.  The
     United  States is divided into ten regions,  so that you are certainly
     in a region even if you are not near a network.

     Once you have located the network or  region  in  your  area,  send  a
     request for a node number to node zero of that network or region.  The
              ____                                ____
     request  must  be sent by FidoNet mail,  and must include at least the
     following:

         1) Your name.
         2) Your current mailing address.
         3) Your telephone number (voice).
         4) The name of your system.
         5) The city and state where your system is located.
         6) The phone number to be used when calling your system.
         7) Your hours of operation.
         8) The maximum baud rate you can support.

     Your coordinator may want  additional  information.  If  so,  he  will
     contact you.

     Please  allow  at  least  two  weeks  for  a node number request to be
     processed.  If you send your request to a regional  coordinator,  then
     he may forward your request to the network coordinator who covers your
     area (if any), which may take longer.

     2.2     If you are going down

     If  your  node will be down for an extended period (more than a day or
                                                   ___________________
     two), then you should inform your coordinator as soon as possible.  If
     you do not do this,  then other systems will still try  to  reach  you
                                                               __ ___ _____
     while  you are down,  much to the annoyance of everyone.  Do not under
     ___  _____________
     any  circumstances  put an answering machine or similar device on your
     phone line while you are down.  If you do,  then calling systems  will
     get  the  machine repeatedly,  racking up large phone bills,  which is
     ____
     very annoying.  See the section on Resolution of Disputes for  details
     on what happens to annoying people.

     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 13                  26 Aug 1996


     If your system goes down without warning,  then you may be  placed  in
     the dog house, or even removed from the node list completely.

     2.3     How to join a network

     If you are an independent node and would like to  join  a  network  in
     your  area,  you  must  contact  the  network  coordinator.  He can be
     reached by sending FidoNet mail to node zero of the network.  He  will
     inform  you  of  any special mail schedules and/or routing required by
     the network.  Your regional coordinator will contact  you  to  confirm
     that  you  wish to join the network.  Once you have been placed in the
     network, you will be informed by the network coordinator.

     There are many advantages to being in a regional  network.  First  and
     foremost is that it helps reduce congestion of FidoNet during National
     Mail Hour.  Also, many nets are "outbound" as well as "inbound", which
     can  substantially  reduce  your  phone  bills.  In addition,  network
     members receive regular updates of the node list and  Fidonews,  while
     an independent node may not.

     2.4     How to form a network

     If there are several nodes in your area, but no regional network, then
     you may wish to form your own.  Again,  this has several advantages as
     outlined above.

     Your first step is to contact the other sysops in your area.  You must
     decide which nodes will comprise the network, and which of those nodes
     is  going  to be the network coordinator.  Your next step is to inform
     your regional coordinator.  You must send him a FidoNet  message  with
     the following information:

     1) The  region  number(s),  or  network  number(s)  if  a  network  is
        splitting up,  that are affected by the formation of your  network.
        The  regional  coordinator will inform the national coordinator and
        the coordinators of any affected networks that a new network is  in
        formation.

     2) The  name that you wish to call your network.  Please try to select
        a  name  that relates to your grouping.  For example,  SoCalNet for
        nodes  in  the   Southern   California   Area   and   MassNet   for
        Massachusettes  Area.  Remember  if  you  call  yourself  DOGNET it
        doesn't help others know what area of the  country  (or  even  what
        country) your group is in.

     3) A  copy  of  the  proposed  network's  nodelist.  The nodelist file
        should be named Frrr-nnn.NET  where  rrr  is  the  proposed  host's
        current  region  or  network  number  and  nnn  is his current node
        number.  For example,  if the proposed host is currently listed  as
        node  5  in  region 13,  then you would name the file F013-005.NET.
        This file should be sent attached to the message of application for
        a Network Number.

                         NETWORK COORDINATOR PROCEDURES

     A network coordinator has the following responsibilities:

     1) To receive incoming mail for nodes in his network,  and to  deliver
        it to its recipients.

     2) To assign node numbers to nodes in his network.

     3) To maintain the node list for his network, and to send a copy of it
        to the international coordinator whenever it changes.

     4) To  pass  along to his nodes new national node lists and new issues
        of FidoNews as they are received.

     5) To forward newsletter submissions to the FidoNews publisher.

     3.1     Routing inbound mail

     It  is  your  responsibility  as  network  coordinator  to receive all
     inbound mail for nodes in your  network  and  to  forward  it  to  its
     recipients.  You  are  left  to  your own discretion as to how best to
     accomplish this.

     There are certain exceptions to this,  however.  If  a  node  in  your
     network  is  sending  and receiving inordinately large volumes of mail
     you can request that he cease and desist.  If he  refuses  to  do  so,
     then  you  can  request your regional coordinator to assign the node a
     number as an independent and drop him from your node list.
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 15                  26 Aug 1996


     There are two main reasons why a  node  might  generate  exceptionally
     large  volumes  of  mail.  Once  in  awhile  a node will try to make a
     "bombing run" (sending one message to a great many  nodes).  If  these
     are being routed through your outbound host, then you can request that
     he cease and desist, on pain of excommunication.  If a node in another
     network  is making bombing runs on your nodes and routing them through
     your inbound host,  then  you  can  complain  to  the  network  and/or
     regional   coordinator  of  the  offending  node.   Bombing  runs  are
     considered to be annoying, and may be dealt with accordingly.

     The other common source of routing overload is EchoMail.  EchoMail  is
     a nice invention,  and offers great benefits, but it cannot be allowed
     to degrade the ability of the network hosts to handle  normal  message
     traffic.  If  a  node  in  your  network  is  routing large volumes of
     EchoMail,  you can ask him to either limit the amount of EchoMail,  or
     even  to stop routing his EchoMail completely.  The design of EchoMail
     is such that it is a simple matter to do either of these.

     3.2     Assigning node numbers

     It is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in  your
     network.  You  may  also  change the numbers of existing nodes in your
     network,  though you should check with your member nodes before  doing
     so.  You  may assign any numbers you wish,  so long as each node has a
     unique number within your network.

     You should not assign a node number to any system unless and until you
     have received a formal request from that system by FidoNet mail.  This
     will ensure that the system is at  least  minimally  operational.  The
     strict  maintenance of this policy has been one of the great strengths
     of FidoNet.

     3.3     Maintaining the node list

     You should attempt to implement name changes,  phone  number  changes,
     etc. in your node list as soon as possible, and to forward the revised
     node list to the international coordinator whenever a change occurs.

     You should also on occasion send a "broadcast message" to  every  node
     in  your network to ensure that they are still operational.  If a node
     turns out to be "off the air" with no prior warning given to you, then
     you can either mark the node as down,  place it in the dog  house,  or
     remove it from the node list completely, at your own discretion.

     If a node in your network is acting in a sufficiently annoying manner,
     then  you  can  take  whatever  action you deem fit,  according to the
     circumstances of the case.

     3.4     Passing along node lists and FidoNews

     As a network coordinator you should from time to time  receive  a  new
     issue  of  FidoNews  or an updated node list.  The node list is posted
     weekly on Friday, and FidoNews is published weekly on Monday.

     You should pass both of these along to your member nodes as soon as is
     practical  after you receive them.  It is also desirable that you make
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 16                  26 Aug 1996


     them both available for downloading by the general user,  but this  is
     not required.

     FidoNews  and  the  node  lists  are  the glue that holds us together.
     Without them,  we cease to be a community,  and  become  just  another
     bunch of bulletin boards.

     3.5     Forwarding newsletter submissions

     The  node  list  gives  us  our  structure,  but FidoNews gives us our
     character.  FidoNews is the primary medium by which sysops  hear  from
     each  other.  It  is  FidoNews  which  gives  us  the sense of being a
     community of people with common interests.

     Accordingly,  you should encourage sysops and users in your network to
     contribute  to  FidoNews.  If you receive any submissions,  you should
     forward them to the FidoNews publisher.  Think of yourself as being  a
     regional bureau chief on the FidoNews editorial staff.

                         REGIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES

     A regional coordinator has the following responsibilities:

     1) To assign node numbers to independent nodes in his region.

     2) To maintain the node list for his region,  and to send a copy of it
        to the international coordinator whenever it changes.

     3) To  encourage  independent  nodes  in  his  region to join existing
        networks, or to form new networks.

     4) To pass along to inbound hosts in his region new international node
        lists and new issues of FidoNews as they are received.

     5) To forward newsletter submissions to the FidoNews publisher.

     4.1     Assigning node numbers

     It is your responsibility to assign node numbers to new nodes in  your
     region.  You  may  also  change  the numbers of existing nodes in your
     region, though you should check with the respective nodes before doing
     so.  You may assign any numbers you wish,  so long as each node has  a
     unique number within your region.

     You should not assign a node number to any system unless and until you
     have received a formal request from that system by FidoNet mail.  This
     will ensure that the system is at  least  minimally  operational.  The
     strict  maintenance of this policy has been one of the great strengths
     of FidoNet.

     If  you  receive  a  node number request from a new node that is in an
     area covered by an existing regional network,  then you should forward
     the  request  to  the  network  host  instead  of  assigning  a number
     yourself.
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 17                  26 Aug 1996


     4.2     Maintaining the node list

     You should attempt to implement name changes,  phone  number  changes,
     and so forth in your node list as soon as possible, and to forward the
     revised  node  list to the international coordinator whenever a change
     occurs.

     You should also on occasion send a "broadcast message" to  every  node
     in  your  region to ensure that they are still operational.  If a node
     turns out to be "off the air" with no prior warning given to you, then
     you can either mark the node as down,  place it in the dog  house,  or
     remove it from the node list completely, at your own discretion.

     If  a node in your region is acting in a sufficiently annoying manner,
     then you can take whatever action  you  deem  fit,  according  to  the
     circumstances of the case.

     4.3     Encouraging the formation and growth of networks

     One of your main duties as a regional coordinator is  to  promote  the
     growth of networks in your region.

     You  should try to avoid having independent nodes in your region which
     are within the  coverage  area  of  a  regional  network.  There  are,
                                                       ___
     however,  certain  cases  where  a  node  should  not be a member of a
     network,  such as a commercial system with a large volume  of  traffic
     which would clog the network.  The resolution of such special cases is
     left to your own discretion.

     If several independent nodes in your region are in a "clump", then you
     should  encourage them to form a regional network.  Refer to the sysop
     procedure  on  forming  a  regional  network  for  details   of   what
     information you should get.

     Note  that  this  does  not mean to encourage the formation of trivial
     networks.  Obviously,  one node does not make  a  network.  The  exact
     number  of  nodes  required  for  an  effective network must be judged
     according to the circumstances of the situation,  and is left to  your
     own discretion.

     4.4     Passing along node lists and Fidonews

     As a regional coordinator,  you should from time to time receive a new
     issue of FidoNews or an updated node list.  The node  list  is  posted
     weekly on Friday, and FidoNews is published weekly on Monday.

     You  should  pass  both  of  these  along to any network hosts in your
                                                                        ___
     region as soon as is practical after you receive  them.  You  are  not
     required to mail them to any independent nodes in your region,  though
     you may if you wish.  It is also desirable that  you  make  them  both
     available  for  downloading  by  the  general  user,  but  this is not
     required.

     4.5     Forwarding newsletter submissions

     You should encourage sysops and users in your region to contribute  to
     FidoNews.  If you receive any submissions,  you should forward them to
     the FidoNews publisher.  Think of yourself as being a regional  bureau
     chief on the FidoNews editorial staff.

                                    Chapter 5

                      INTERNATIONAL COORDINATOR PROCEDURES

     The  international  coordinator  for  FidoNet  has the primary task of
     maintaining the master node  list,  as  well  as  the  node  list  for
     region 1.  From  this  are derived several additional responsibilities
     and powers.  However,  these powers are rarely  (if  ever)  used.  The
                                                      ___
     international coordinator is very much King Log, not King Stork.

     The  international  coordinator,  if  he  acts  at all,  will normally
     restrict himself to  negotiating  with  the  parties  involved  in  an
     attempt to achieve a peaceful resolution.

     If  a  system  has been dropped from the node list,  and can present a
     sufficiently convincing case to the international coordinator, then he
     can be granted status as an "independent at large" in region 1.

     In an extreme  case,  the  international  coordinator  can  order  the
     disbanding  of  a regional net,  or can assign a new coordinator for a
     region,  but this is highly unlikely.  The  international  coordinator
          ____
     will only take such action in an extreme situation which threatens the
     existence and integrity of FidoNet.
                                      ___________________
     The  international  coordinator  will take no action at all unless all
     other means of settlement have already been tried.  His first step  in
     resolving any dispute will be to contact the regional coordinators and
     network coordinators involved.  If they have not been consulted by the
     injured  party  or  otherwise  made  aware of the situation,  then the
     complaint will be dismissed out of hand.
                                             ________________
     He will also take no action  unless  in  his  opinion  the  matter  is
     serious enough to warrant his attention.

     If all means of recourse have been tried  to  no  avail,  and  if  the
     international  coordinator feels that the situation is grave enough to
                                         ____
     warrant his intervention,  then and only then he  will  intercede  and
     take whatever action he feels is appropriate, at his own discretion.

                             RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES

     The  world  not  being  perfect,  sometimes  troubles  crop  up.   Any
     organization larger than a cub scout pack needs some sort of grievance
     procedure, and FidoNet is no exception.

     The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 19                  26 Aug 1996


     1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

     2) Thou shalt not be too easily annoyed.

     In  other  words,  there  are  no hard and fast rules of conduct,  but
                                                                       ____
     reasonably polite behavior is expected.  Also,  in  any  dispute  both
     sides  are examined,  and action could be taken against either or both
     parties. ("Judge not, lest ye be judged!")

     6.1     Problems with another node

     If  you are having problems with another node,  you should complain to
     your network coordinator and/or his network  coordinator.  If  one  or
     both  of  you  is  not in a network,  then complain to the appropriate
     regional coordinator.

     6.2     Problems with a network coordinator

     If you are having problems with your network coordinator and feel that
     you are not being treated properly, there are a few things you can do.

     The  first  step is to contact your regional coordinator.  If he feels
     that your case has merit, and cannot resolve it in any other way, then
     he may grant you independent status.  You will then  no  longer  be  a
     part  of  the  regional  network,  and will probably no longer receive
     FidoNews and node list updates,  so don't ask unless you are sure  you
     want out.

     If you fail to obtain relief from your regional coordinator,  then you
     can appeal to the international coordinator.

     6.3     Problems with a regional coordinator

     If you are having problems with your regional  coordinator,  then  you
     should  first try to join or form a regional network in your area.  If
     this fails, you can appeal to the international coordinator.

     6.4     Problems with the international coordinator

     If you are having problems with the  international  coordinator,  then
     you are out of luck.  You can either live with it, drop out and forget
     it,  or  join  with some friends and start another mail system of your
     own.

     6.5     Appeals to the international coordinator

     If you are unable to obtain relief  from  your  regional  coordinator,
     then you can appeal to the international coordinator.  If your case is
     sufficiently  extreme and meritorious,  then you may be granted status
     as an "independent at large" (that is, an independent in region 1, not
     a part of any network or region).

     This is an extreme case, and has never actually come to pass thus far.
     The international coordinator has broad and sweeping powers  which  he
     almost  never uses.  You should be very,  very sure of the strength of
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 20                  26 Aug 1996


     your case before going this far.

     Also,  the first  step  taken  by  the  international  coordinator  in
     investigating  any dispute is to contact any regional coordinators and
     network coordinators concerned.  If you have not followed  the  proper
     channels,  then  your  case  will  be dismissed out of hand.  In other
     words,  don't go to the international coordinator until you have tried
     __________
     everything else.

     6.6     Case Histories

     A  few  actual  case  histories of past disputes may be instructive to
     show general procedures and methods.  Names  have  been  left  out  to
     protect the guilty.

     6.6.1   The Case of the Crooked Node

     A  sysop of a local node was using network mail to engage in unethical
     business practices.  His network coordinator became  very  annoyed  at
     this, and dropped the local from his node list.

     The  local  appealed  to his regional coordinator for assignment as an
     independent node.  The regional  coordinator,  on  checking  with  the
     network  coordinator,  decided that the network coordinator was within
     his rights to be annoyed.  Independent status was denied.

     The international coordinator did not intervene.

     6.6.2   The Case of the Hacker Mailer

     A sysop of a local node made use of file attaches for extra  users  to
     mail  himself the USER.BBS file from several local boards.  The sysops
     of these boards felt annoyed at this,  and appealed to  their  network
     coordinator,  who  agreed and dropped the offending node from the node
     list.

     The regional coordinator was not consulted.

     The international coordinator did not intervene.

     6.6.3   The Case of the Network Mutiny

     Several local nodes became annoyed with their network coordinator  for
     failing to provide services.  They complained to him,  but nothing was
     done.

     They appealed to their regional coordinator,  who  decided  that  they
     were justified in their annoyance and accepted their application for a
     new network number.

     The international coordinator assigned the network  number,  based  on
     the regional coordinator's recommendation.

     6.6.4   The Case of the Bothered Barker

     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 21                  26 Aug 1996


     A local node became annoyed with his network coordinator  for  failing
     to  provide  services.  Repeated complaints to his network coordinator
     did not satisfy him, so he appealed to the international coordinator.

     The international coordinator, on seeing that the regional coordinator
     had not been consulted, dismissed the complaint out of hand.

     The local node submitted his complaint to  his  regional  coordinator,
     who  investigated  the case and discovered that there was some justice
     to the complaint.  He advised and assisted the network coordinator  in
     configuring  his system to provide an improved level of service to the
     local nodes.

     The regional coordinator also decided that the local  node  was  being
     too  easily  annoyed,  in  that he was expecting services not normally
     required of a network coordinator.  The local node was informed as  to
     the true duties of a network coordinator, and was advised to lower his
     expectations.

     6.6.5   The Case of the Busy Beaver

     A  local node which was operated by a retail establishment was engaged
     in  making  "bombing  runs"  to mail advertisements over FidoNet.  His
     network coordinator felt annoyed and handling the outgoing traffic for
     a commercial operation, and asked the local node to leave the network.

     The local node applied to the regional coordinator,  and  was  granted
     status as an independent node in his region.

     6.6.6   The Mark of the Devil

     A local sysop whose board was used in conjunction with  voodoo  rites,
     hacking,   phreaking,  and  obscene  material  applied  to  a  network
     coordinator for a node number.  The network  coordinator  deemed  that
     this board was exceptionally annoying, and denied the request.

     The regional coordinator was not consulted.

     The national coordinator dismissed the case out of hand.

     6.6.7   The Case of the Sysop Twit

     A  patron  of  various  local nodes had been roundly recognized by all
     sysops as a twit.  The user obtained his own system,  became a  sysop,
     and  applied  for  a  node number.  The network coordinator denied the
     request.  No appeals were made.

     6.6.8   The Case of the EchoMail Junkey key key

     A  local  node  became  enamored  with  EchoMail  and  joined  several
     conferences,  routing  his outbound mail through his regional network.
     He then started an EchoMail conference of his own and  began  relaying
     EchoMail  between  several  systems,  again routing it all through his
     regional network.

     His network coordinator observed that network performance was becoming
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 22                  26 Aug 1996


     seriously impaired.  The offending node was told to hold  it  down.  A
     compromise  was  reached  whereby  much of the EchoMail traffic was no
     longer routed through the regional network,  and routed  EchoMail  was
     limited to twenty messages per night.  No appeals were made.

                         INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MEETINGS

     The  International  FidoNet  Association  (IFNA)   is   a   non-profit
     corporation.  As  such,  it  must  from  time  to time hold a business
     meeting for the election of officers and for general network business.
     These meetings will be held  at  approximately  yearly  intervals,  as
     scheduled by the international coordinator.

     Every FidoNet system is considered to be a member of IFNA.  Members
     are grouped according to their network or region, with each network
     and region receiving one vote.

     Every  network  and  region  coordinator should attempt to attend each
     business meeting.  If it is not possible for a coordinator to  attend,
     then  he  should designate a member of his network or region to go and
     vote on behalf of the network or region.  Any network or  region  that
     does  not have a designated representative present at the meeting will
     lose its vote.

     Six Mail Processors Reviewed [II]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     This is the second of my six-part series of articles which looks at
     six mail processors.  Last week's article looked at FastEcho, and this
     week's article is about GEcho.  A full feature table for all six mail
     processors will be produced in the sixth article.

     GECHO

         GEcho is a popular mail processor written by Gerard van der Land.
     The version I have here is 1.00 which, to my knowledge, is the latest
     evaluation version despite its 1992 release date.  Later versions
     include 1.11+ (registered users only) and 1.20/Pro (commercial
     version).

     First Impressions

         The first thing which strikes me as I unpack GEcho is the age of
     the evaluation version.  While GEcho 1.00 is a fully working piece of
     software (with the traditional shareware messages and some shareware
     limitations), the fact that it hasn't been updated with the shareware
     versions means that it probably doesn't give a good idea of the
     registered program's capabilities.
         The main thing which strikes first time sysops of modern systems
     is the lack of support for any of the more advanced message bases such
     as JAM or Squish which are common in Fidonet systems today.  You're
     limited to Hudson or *.MSG.
         This is fine for points, but it is of little use for sysops who
     want to evaluate the package on large systems with a busy message
     base.  For this reason, such sysops may pass GEcho over entirely, even
     though later versions are far more versatile in message base support.
         Another feature conspicuous by its absence is automatic creation
     of unknown areas when mail is received in them.  Although GEcho is
     very easy to set up, the fact that new areas have to be added manually
     may put points off using the software.
         These gripes can be put into perspective when you consider that
     this is the evaluation version of GEcho.  However, it would have been
     useful to have a more up to date evaluation version available, even if
     all features over and above those in 1.00 were disabled; this would
     allow sysops to see the potential of the registered package.
         Now that the advanced age of the package has been discussed at
     length, let's not dwell on it further, but instead, see what the
     package is capable of.

     On Further Examination...

         Upon loading and using the setup program, one thing which I found
     pleasing was the clean interface.  Although rather spartan in
     comparison with the other packages, the GEcho interface is consistent
     and very easy to use.
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 24                  26 Aug 1996


         What is slightly disappointing is the lack of 'hot keys' in the
     menu interface.  Each option must be selected using the cursor keys
     and ENTER; there are no single-letter keypresses to choose options in
     a menu.
         In common with most other Fidonet-related software, fields in a
     data entry screen are amended by highlighting their field names and
     pressing ENTER before typing or selecting a new value for the field.
     This contrasts to the method FastEcho uses, where the cursor always
     sits in a field, and the up/down/enter/tab keys are used to navigate
     from one field to another, rather like a standard GUI interface.
         The method GEcho uses, whilst a little more cumbersome, is
     slightly more consistent.  Merely moving past a multiple choice field
     does not invoke its menu, as with FastEcho; this allows easier
     navigation of a screen when only one or two fields need to be changed;
     you can move up and down through the fields using the cursor keys
     without inadvertently changing them.
         There is a help system with GEcho, which is context sensetive, but
     it is not a hypertext system like those used by FastEcho and IMail.
     Instead, it merely allows you to view the relevant part of the manual
     in a window, which is not quite as helpful.  However, full text search
     facilities are present, and you can scroll the window to view any part
     of the manual.
         Speaking of documentation... The manual for GEcho is quite clear
     and comprehensive.  It is rather slim, but this is to be expected with
     the age of the evaluation package and the lack of advanced features.
     Only the addition of an index would serve to improve it.
         One feature present in GEcho, which of the packages reviewed here
     only FastEcho shares, is a description import feature.  Having
     imported an AREAS.BBS (as I often do), you find your area database
     lacking descriptions.  GCONVERT, a bundled utility, comes to the
     rescue, with a feature which takes a standard echo list and imports a
     descriptions for every echo entry currently lacking one (ie. entries
     which already have a description are left alone).
         People are occasionally in doubt about this feature's usefulness,
     so a little example by way of explanation might be in order.  The
     region 25 backbone currently has around 550-600 echoes, which I have
     access to.  My downlinks and I only take around 150 of these, but I
     still like to have all 550-600 echoes in my echo database so that
     downlinks get a complete list of available echoes when they issue a
     %LIST to AreaFix (most packages only list echoes in your echo
     database, even if requests for other areas can be forwarded).  The
     ability to import areas from an AREAS.BBS, then import descriptions
     from an echolist, is therefore invaluable for those wishing to provide
     a complete %LIST to their points and downlinks.
         Another feature important to many sysops is the ability to import
     personal netmail which has been read or sent, into special message
     areas.  This differs from the normal netmail import feature in that it
     imports netmails with the Sent flag into a 'Sent Netmail' area, and
     netmails with the Rcvd flag into a 'Received Netmail' area.  This is
     useful if you (as the sysop of your node or point) want to keep your
     netmail correspondence for future reference without having to manually
     forward messages into a certain area once you've read (or posted)
     them.
         GEcho has a good AreaFix system.  In keeping with the rest of the
     package, it is short on the advanced features of more modern
     evaluation packages, but it contains all the necessary features for a
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 25                  26 Aug 1996


     full node, such as echo grouping (with the ability to restrict access
     to special groups such as sysop areas), forwarding requests to
     uplinks, and a full set of areafix commands.  Read-only access is not
     present, however; a node or point either has full access to an echo
     group or none at all.
         One impressive aspect of the package is its speed.  The evaluation
     package is only an 8086 executable (ie. no fancy DPMI or 386
     instructions), yet in the Hudson message toss test it was second only
     to FMailX, itself a 386 executable.  This is surprising for a package
     which was released in 1992, and the later versions of the program are
     reputed to be even faster.
         The exact timing for a message toss of 91 echomail messages into
     a newly created Hudson message base is 9 seconds, including the time
     it took to unarchive the messages.  The same archive took only 11
     seconds to be tossed into previously empty *.MSG areas.
         (For readers in doubt as to the impressiveness of such speeds,
     take note of the humble hardware the tests have been performed on--
     this is more fully detailed in the first article in this series).

     Summary

         Despite the age of the evaluation package, GEcho has some
     impressive attributes.  If the cleanliness and consistency of its
     interface are not enough, then its speed will impress.  However, the
     age of the evaluation version, and its lack of general features,
     detract from its attractiveness.
         Unless you know someone running the registered version of GEcho,
     you can't be sure of what features the current registered version
     possesses, and how well they work.  A more up to date evaluation
     package is sorely needed, even if it only displays the more advanced
     features of the modern package in registered-user-only form.
         In next week's Fidonews you should see the third part of this
     series, in which I poke and prod Folkert J Wijnstra's FMail echomail
     processor software.

     * Forwarded (from: RGN17-ADMIN) by Lisa Gronke
     * Originally from Dallas Hinton (1:17/0) to All.
     * Original dated: Thu Aug 15, 22:11

     Hi All!

     List of Candidates for REC 17 position (in alphabetical order):

     1)  John Mudge (352/0, 352/111)
     2)  Bob Seaborn (140/1, 140/12)
     ===================

     As previously stated, voting may now begin.  Bob and John may, if they
     wish, post a message (each) describing their qualifications,
     experience, etc.  If you wish to ask questions of either gentleman,
     you're welcome to do so in RGN17-ADMIN.  Please remember that there
     may be a considerable time lag since both John and Bob are LD from me
     and don't call for mail every day.

     I would like to see netmail ballots from each NC, each NEC, and each
     RHUB containing the name of their candidate of choice from the above
     list.  All ballots received at either 153/715 or 17/0 before 00:01 PST
     on Thursday August 29th, 1996 will be counted.

     Ballots should contain a password which I will use for confirmation
     when I post results.  Only the first received ballot per person will
     be accepted.

     Results
     =======

     The winning candidate will be selected by a simple majority of votes.
     The results of the vote will be announced no later than September 5th,
     1996. If a majority of votes clearly favor one candidate before this
     date, then that candidate may be declared the REC without waiting for
     the close of voting.

     If a runoff is needed, I'll post the guidelines at that time.

     My thanks to both Bob and John for letting their names stand -- good
     luck to you both!

     Subject: The New Dr. Internet

     I have been alerted to the presence of a "Dr. Internet" column which
     claims to be authoritative, but in fact contains several errors.  This
     alternate version obviates this difficulty by making no such claim,
     but does try to project the aura of quiet wisdom found in the original
     "Ask Dr. Science."  It was apparently written by our overnight janitor
     one evening when I forgot to logoff.  (Yeah, that's the ticket.)
     1.  How big is the Internet?  When did it start?  How did it grow?

         The Internet is actually much smaller than most people think.  It
         is primarily composed of fiber optic cables no thicker than a
         human hair, which can be conveniently rolled up and stored in a
         foot locker.  Janitors at the National Science Foundation do this
         on the third Tuesday of every month when they wax the floors.

         Since fiber optics are the size of human hairs, they also make
         attractive wigs.  The next time you watch a Sprint commercial,
         you'll see that Candice Bergen's alleged hair is really the T4
         backbone.

         The earliest origins of the Internet can be traced to Ancient
         Greece, where a loosely connected set of networks was used to
         discuss exploration in the Black Sea.  The Argonets, as they were
         then called, were entirely subsidized by the government, and won
         one of William Proxmire's first Golden Fleece awards.

         The Internet grows hyperbolically, but is usually described
         elliptically.


     2.  Who owns the Internet?

         There is no one person or agency that owns the Internet.  Instead,
         parts of it are owned by the Illuminati and parts are owned by
         Free Masons.


     3.  What do the Internet addresses mean?
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 30                  26 Aug 1996


         Precise meanings are often hard to determine.  The address
         baker.lib.washington.edu--which is sometimes written
         baker@lib.washington.edu--seems to refer to a computer either
         owned by a baker or by someone named Baker.  This can be deceiving
         however; names like this actually refer to where a computer is
         located.  This one is on top of Mt. Baker.

         In addition to names, computers on the Internet also have numbers.
         This is part of the whole right brain/left brain thing.


     4.  Tell me how to get on and off various lists and discussion groups.

         Getting off on various lists is currently the subject of pending
         legislation.


     5.  What is "Netiquette?"

         "Netiquette" is one of many cutesy neologisms created by combining
         two other words.  In this case, "network" and "tourniquette"
         combine to describe a program that shuts down a computer if it
         starts transmitting information too fast.


     6.  What is "Flaming?"

         Along with an improvisational approach to floating point
         arithmetic, early Pentium chips were noted for generating heat.
         While some hackers speak fondly of roasting marshmallows over
         their first P60s, others found themselves badly singed as the
         chips caught fire.  This "flaming" sometimes occurred while the
         user was composing e-mail, resulting in poorly chosen or
         excessively vitriolic verbiage.


     7.  What is "Bandwidth?"

         As capacity on the Internet has increased, people have begun to
         transmit material other than simple text.  One notable example is
         audio recordings of rock concerts.  These audio files are much
         larger than even very long books, so they have become a standard
         unit of network usage.  One Rolling Stone song equals one "band"
         width, and so on.


     8.  Why can't I FTP to some places?

         There are two main reasons for this.  The first is that the site
         you want to ftp files from is exercising a certain degree of
         control over its network resources; in network parlance, this is
         called "fascism."

         The second reason is that the remote site may be dabbling with
         such network fads as gopher or the World Wide Web.  This is called
         "keeping up with the times."
     FIDONEWS 13-35               Page 31                  26 Aug 1996


     9.  What is the World Wide Web, Gopherspace, etc?

         The World Wide Web, or WWW, is an experiment in generating
         acronyms that are much more difficult to pronounce than the words
         they replace.

         Gopherspace is an older network term.  In response to the Soviet
         space program's early use of dogs in space, NASA mounted a program
         to orbit a number of different rodents.  The programmers involved
         in this project adopted the motto "Gophers in space!" which has
         since been shortened.  The only actual gopher to go into orbit had
         been digging up the carrots in Werner Von Braun's garden, and was
         named Veronica after his daughter.


     10. Why can't I get some WWW stuff via FTP?

         It can be hard to say this, but some users of the Internet are
         unable to do things because they are stupid.  The comparatively
         trivial task of getting an ftp client to do every single thing a
         WWW browser can do is beneath this column's attention.

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     We've found the source of all the old FidoNews Issues. I now have a
     request to find the source of all the old Nodelists.

     The Question of the Week is:

     Do you have old Nodelists and where and how do we get them?

     As always, send your answers in Netmail, the FIDONEWS Echo, email, or
     as articles to FidoNews. See the Masthead for contact info.

     Thanks.
