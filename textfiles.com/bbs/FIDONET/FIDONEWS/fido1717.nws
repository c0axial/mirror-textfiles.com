                               Is BBSing Dead?
                                  Doug Myers

     Back in the late 1980's, I got onto a BBS for the first time with
     all the power of a 300 baud modem.  I was lured by the promise of
     free software in abundance - but it was the online community that
     made this venture a lifelong hobby rather than a passing fad.  I
     guess I'd always enjoyed interacting with people, but the
     interaction was never so intense as when corrosponding with people
     on bulletin boards.

     Does the internet community offer this same intensity of
     interaction?  I really don't know as I've never fully participated
     in the internet.  Oh, I exchange a lot of email, but most of it is
     with folks I've met through bbsing.  Perhaps the more appropriate
     question is:  Is the internet a substitute for BBSing?  Again, I'm
     only asking as I don't truly know the answer... I'm an old BBSer
     from way back.

     A letter I received this week (the author declined publication)
     pronounced BBSing dead, as well as Fidonet.  Further, he pronounced
     FTP and telenet to be dead ends, that folks would only point and
     click on the Web in the future.

     The author made some good points - it's certainly not a state secret
     that folks have embraced the internet and that the local bbs just
     isn't visited any more.  And I've long agreed that a Fidonet which
     depends on BBSing as it was in the past won't survive.

     However, Fidonet still carries the sense of community which BBSing
     held when I first got into it.  Further, I've not heard of folks on
     the internet telling me about that - so I'm presuming it doesn't
     exist or hasn't formed yet.

     Now here's a sense of direction for the future:  if Fidonet can
     successfully maintain this sense of community, possibly even
     carrying it to the internet, then Fido will never die.  However,
     Fido right now is composed of a lot of us who remember the spirit of
     BBSing... and there won't be many of us left as time goes by with
     the BBS a thing of the past.  Just as we needed BBS users in the
     past to make our community come alive, so we'll need the "point and
     clickers" in the future.  Are we doing anything to embrace them?

                      Editorial Response - At What Age?
                    Echomail From the Fidonews Conference
                           Nahum Wengrov, 2:402/633

        Responding to what FidoNews Robot wrote to All,
        about FidoNews 17:16 [01/07]: Editorial, on 17 Apr 00, 00:16

      FR> So at what age is one sufficiently mature to post in a Fidonet
      FR> echo?

      I don't know about Fidonet, but we have here in Israel 2 local
      Fido-style networks in Hebrew. The average age of most active
      participants is 16. The youngest participants to write regularly
      were 12 when they joined.

      English is a second language here, and I don't think there are many
      teenagers here fluent enough in English to enjoy reading, let alone
      writing, in an international English network. Perhaps that's the
      reason why most of Ultinet and C-net members don't bother to write
      in Fidonet.


      FR> Nineteen isn't such a bad age.  Though the age seems far away
      FR> to me at the age of 53, I seem to recall that I had most of my
      FR> language skills developed by that age and had a good general
      FR> idea of how people interacted.  While I've got to admit that
      FR> subsequent life experience has modified my approach to things,
      FR> I believe that at the age of 19 I was sufficiently mature to
      FR> enter conversations as an adult.  But then, I wasn't online
      FR> then... I was nineteen in the sixties and hardly anyone was
      FR> online then!  Especially, I wasn't interacting in a hobby which
      FR> has somewhat passed its prime and whose participants tend to
      FR> middle age rather than youth.


      I was a Yeshiva (Rabbinical College) student at the age of 19, in
      the 70's. I didn't own or have access to a computer yet. I got my
      first computer when I was 25, and only bought a modem a few years
      later. It took me a few years of modeming to discover the
      Fido-style mail networks here.

      By now, BBS's in Israel are mail-only or dead. The majority of
      C-net participants already polls their mail from their 2 Internet
      hubs. The future is in the Internet.

      FR> Imagine... the future of Fido is in the hands of a sysop who
      FR> goes by the handle of Black Death.  Kinda scary, eh?

      In a few years he'll probably change his handle :)

                         Something Special about Fido
                             Email to the Editor
                                Bruce Anderson

     For some reason, decided to check out Fidonet presence on the net a
     couple of days ago, and was pleasantly surprised.

     As part of Fidonet for about 8 years, (86-94?), and as the NC of
     Net 342 (Region 17), I cherish the time spent in the Fidonet
     community. Changing priorities resulted in me dropping Fidonet
     activities, but I'm glad to see Fidonet is, in this day and age of
     the Internet, thriving. (Some may question that description, but all
     things considered...)

     Fidonet does have something special. Keep that in mind.

                             Immaturity & Sysops
                             Email to the Editor
                                Michael Adams

     Immaturity is irrelevant to young age. Here in Florida, there
     used to be a number of young sysops here. Around 1997, a guy
     shut down a system he ran since age 12. Around 1996, I started
     using BBS' and ran one from 7-1996 to 3-1999: Fidonet 1:374/163;
     the Slug BBS. My age at bootup: 15. My age before shutdown:
     17 (18 in May).

     We need the young people. We also need young people who could
     use their cable modems to run Telnettable BBS', as Internet is
     here to stay, and there won't be any 374 net 2 years from now.
     But that's another issue, and one that may be interesting.

     Long live the BBS'!

     Editor:  There's a corrolation between age and immaturity to my
     experience, as I find most young people refreshingly unencumbered by
     excessive maturity.  If I want to try something new or innovative, I

     value a bit of immaturity.  The "mature" response to innovation is
     that the old way was good enough.

                                  2:402/633

       Hello All,

       I have been dethroned. The Emperor of region 2:40 decided to
       disband all nets in the region and unite them under his domain. I
       am to become 2:400/633, and lose my NC status about a month after
       having acquired it :)

       I personally agree with this move. In a place such as Israel,
       where most people don't write English unless they are forced to do
       so, dividing Fidonet into nets, with most of them having only one
       hub and a few nodes, simply doesn't make sense. Especially since
       the volume of mail is small enough and the modems are fast enough
       to make the difference in the phone bill really insignificant.

       Also, in the 3rd millenium, almost anyone who has a computer has
       internet access. More and more old-style bbs'es here in Israel are
       closing down. The majority of the participants of C-net, our major
       local Fido-style Hebrew network, are already polling mail
       (echomail, netmail, and file echoes) from the two Internet hubs.

       In another 2 weeks, our national phone company, Bezeq, will allow
       users to access the Internet for a flat rate of $25 per month.
       This will allow more Fidonet hubs (like me) to stay online 24/7,
       allowing their downlinks to poll mail through the Internet. This
       will make the division of the region into separate nets even more
       ridiculous than it is today.

     ZC/2 elections starting... NOW!
     By Jan Vermeulen, RC/28

     The following message was published in the REGCON.EUR (Zone 2) area
     on Fri 21 Apr 2000 - it was also sent to all individual RCs in Z2.

     Colleagues,

     Too long a time has passed since Ward announced the ZC/2 elections
     based on the formation of an elections committee; for a number of
     reasons this did not work as was expected by all concerned -- nobody
     FIDONEWS 17-17               Page 6                   24 Apr 2000


     can really be blamed forthis, least of all Ward himself, who, time
     and again, has used his virtual whip in order to get progress where
     none was visible.

     Oh well, finally this message marks the kick off of the ZC/2 elect-
     ions, with me as your Receiving Officer and DavidRance as the
     Verification Officer.

     Mailing addresses are at the end of this message.

     Starting dates are considered to commence at 00:00 UTC
     Ending dates are considered to end at 23:59 UTC


     Echomail areas used for the discussions:
     ----------------------------------------

     REGCON.EUR and ENET.SYSOP
     Current rules for those areas remain in force.


     Who may be a candidate:
     -----------------------

     Any sysop of Zone 2 region 20 thru 54 whose system is not Pvt,
     Hold or Down may run for ZC/2.

     Sysops of non-CM systems are expected to promise that, when
     elected, they will upgrade to CM before taking this most
     important office in our zone.


     Who may vote:
     -------------

     The Region Coordinators of Zone 2 Regions 20 .. 54.
     Ideally, an RC's vote should reflect the result of a referendum
     they will have held in their Region.


     What the vote should look like:

     Re: My vote
     ---------------------------------
     <name> ! <password>


     What password to use:
     ---------------------

     Each RC will be provided by crashed netmail with a password
     that (s)he must use in order to have his/her vote validated.


     Where candidates can send their application and RCs can send
     their votes:
     ------------------------------------------------------------

     The vote may be sent (in descending order of preference and
     degree of security):

     (1) by crash netmail to the Receiving Officer at 2:28/0
         (it may be prudent to force as V32bis session...)

     (2) by fax to 31-75-6401600. (Make sure you use a legible
         typeface at 12 points at least for my scanner and OCR
         software to make a correct conversion).

     (3) by email to j.vermeulen@hot.a2000.nl

     (4) by routed netmail to the Receiving Officer at 2:28/0


     Who may participate in the Regional Referendum:
     -----------------------------------------------

     The Sysops of all systems that are not Pvt, Hold or Down and
     having a valid telephone number for the Region in question.
     Regardless of the number of systems operated, a Sysop will have
     one vote.


     How the result of the elections will be calculated:
     ---------------------------------------------------

     Each Region has one vote.

     A vote that is not for one of the candidates will be invalid
     and shall not influence the results in any way.

     In the first round, the sucessful candidate must have more
     than 50% of the votes cast and valid.

     If such result is not obtained, a second round will be run
     FIDONEWS 17-17               Page 8                   24 Apr 2000


     between a minimum of two candidates; the list of candidates
     is compounded as follows:

     votes for:                      rerun between:
     ----------------------------    ---------------------------
     cand_1 > cand_2 > cand_3 ...    cand_1 and cand_2
     cand_1 = cand_2 > cand_3 ...    cand_1 and cand_2
     cand_1 = cand_2 = cand_3 ...    cand_1 and cand_2 and cand_3
     cand_1 > cand_2 = cand_3 ...    cand_1 and cand_2 and cand_3

     The successful candidate will be who has the most votes.

     In case of a tie after the secound round, lots will be drawn in
     the following way:
     . prior to the start of the second round of voting, the RO will
       have sent a list of four numbers between 0 and 100 to a trusted
       third party (TTP) who is neither RC nor candidate and whose
       name will not be revealed until needed.
     . each candidate surviving the second round will send his/her
       own set of 4 numbers to the RO who will request the VO to
       compare them with the list he will receive from the TTP.
     . the successfull candidate's set of numbers will be closest to
       the sum of the numbers or, if there is still a draw, closest
       to the first of the composing numbers, e.g.

         numbers are    34 67 88 91  sum = 280

         cand_1 has     37 61 94 87  sum = 279
                dev      3  6  6  4
         cand_2 has     31 61 91 98  sum = 281
                dev      3  6  3  7
         ---------------------^^     wins

                               Giving the Finger

     Before the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, the French, anticipating
     victory over the English, proposed to cut off the middle finger of
     all captured English soldiers. Without the middle finger it would be
     impossible to draw the renowned English longbow and therefore those
     with no middle finger would be incapable of fighting in the future.

     This famous weapon was made of the native English Yew tree, and the
     act of drawing the longbow was known as "plucking the yew" (or
     "pluck  yew"). Much to the bewilderment of the French, the English
     won a major upset and began mocking the French by waving their
     middle fingers at the defeated French, saying, "See, we can still
     pluck yew! PLUCK YEW!"

     Since "pluck yew" is rather difficult to say, the difficult
     consonant cluster at the beginning has gradually changed to a
     labiodental fricative 'F', and thus the words often used in
     conjunction with the one-finger-salute are mistakenly thought to
     have something to do with an intimate encounter.

     It is also because of the pheasant feathers on the arrows used with
     the longbow that the symbolic gesture is known as "giving the bird."

     And  yew thought yew knew everything about fingers! 8^)

     What: Jazzmasters Strange Facts & Useless Information

     Where: http://members.tripod.com/~Mitchell_J/

     Ok... This isn't exactly a Fidonet page. :)  It is the page of a
     friend and Point of mine.  Please forgive my wandering off like
     this. :-)


     Here's a cut and paste about the pages:

     -------- cut --------

       I've been collecting these little stories, facts, and bits of
     useless information for quite some time and thought it was time to
     share a few of them with everyone. Feel free to E-mail me if you
     have any suggestions or any strange facts you might think need to be
     posted here as well.
                           -----------------------------
       For those who may be interested, I also have a humor mailing list
     you can subscribe to. Simply send a blank e-mail (or click on the
     graphic below) with the word "Subscribe R" or "Subscribe PG" in the
     subject line and you'll be set!
     ---- uncut ---------


              Ok... so why did I put this page in the Fidonews?

                           Because it's there?! :)

                Real reason is, "Just a break from the usual".


     I've know Randy (Jazzmaster) since my BBS in Texas was named "The
     Musicians' Forum". He called, left me a message, we met and he
     became a Point off of my BBS. We've been friends since.

     As you might have guessed, Randy is a musician... and a darn site
     better one than I'll ever be! That should explain his page and the
     sense of humor involved better than anything I could write. :) After
     many years "on the road" in music, I'd bet there isn't much Randy
     hasn't seen or heard. <G>

     Enough about that.

                                      The page

     The page is just what it says... "Strange Facts and Useless
     Information".

     There are links to page after page of this stuff. I will warn you
     that some of the pages are adult type information and you might want
     to be careful if this would offend you. Otherwise, look, click and
     laugh or be amazed at this stuff. :)

     There is a nice midi song that is played on the main page. You might
     or might not know it ("What a Wonderful World") and a guest book as
     well as an ICQ link and information.
     FIDONEWS 17-17               Page 12                  24 Apr 2000


     When you visit the page, be sure to sign the guest book and tell him
     you got lost.... er heard about the page in the Fidonews. I'm sure
     I'll hear about that. :-))

     Have fun, read, learn, laugh and pray for me when Randy finds out I
     did this. :)

     I'll get back on the Fidonet stuff next week (I hope). <smile>

     With insane regards,

     Okay, I'm not really speaking from the heart, I'm speaking about it.
     At the time you read this, I will probably be in the local hospital.
     The good news is that it won't be for the open heart surgery I
     mentioned a while back.  The various doctors, in conference, decided
     that a procedure called baloon angioplasty could accomplish the same
     healing.  The difference is that the angioplasty only requires an
     overnight stay in the hospital and a few days off work (instead of
     the three month's unemployment I was preparing for).

     My thanks to Bobby Queen and Peter Karlsson for offering to put out
     Fidonews in the event that I was unable.  Hopefully I'll be able for
     a long time to come, but it's good to know that there's backup if
     needed :)
