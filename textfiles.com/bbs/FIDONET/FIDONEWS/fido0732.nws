     =================================================================


     I guess  I  could  ask  you  if anything important occurred in my
     absence, but too many people might take it the wrong way.

     Actually, two things  happened  in  my  absence.  One of them was
     entirely trivial but has  gotten  everybody's attention;  and the
     other was entirely important and has been generally ignored.

     What I want to talk about is what occurred yesterday in Lyndhurst
     New Jersey.

     We put IFNA to rest yesterday.  It went,  not  with  a  bang, but
     with a whimper.  I'm certain that everyone who had anything to do
     with  IFNA  at  any  point  has  his  or her own memory  of  what
     happened,  so  I  won't  get  into it much.  Suffice to say  that
     FidoNet has finally  arrived  at  the  conclusion that anarchy is
     what it does best -- so it's damned well going to do it.

     That's OK with me.  Though I thought IFNA was going to help us do
     it by taking some of the other monkeys off our backs.  I think it
     was when somebody decided that IFNA  was a bigger monkey than the
     rest, that it all started to get ugly.

     Well, it's all water under D'Bridge (sorry Chris) now.

     By the way, since  January  FidoNews  has  been published under a
     specific license from Tom Jennings to myself for use of the name.
     I have also published any IFNA  materials  sent  my  way and will
     continue  to  do so as long as  is  necessary  to  clear  up  the
     business of dissolving the corporation.

     I think I'll pass on the other issue  for a week.  I want to give
     it  all  some more thought.  In fact, I  don't  think  that  I'll
     change compressors again without a two week notice, so let's just
     say  that  the  first  issue  in September will decide the issue.
     We'll  either go back to ARC 5.12, keep LHArc, or choose another.
     I  have  some  thoughts on what we should do and I'll try to give
     them a proper presentation next week.

     Cheers,
     Vince

                          FidoNews Broke My System

     This week, I received my copy of FidoNews in LHARC format.  It
     broke my BAT file.  As a consequence, several people who called and
     requested FidoNews were inconvenienced.

     Upon discovering the problem and unpacking the issue, I discover an
     "editorial".  I use the quotes because it was obviously not written
     by the editor, referring in the first paragraph to Vince in the
     third person.  On the other hand, it wasn't signed.  Considering
     the content, I was led to wonder why Jack Decker had been asked to
     write a guest editorial for FidoNews.

     I have two comments on this distribution change to LHARC.

     First, it was incredibly inconsiderate.  I know that I am not the
     only person who had a BAT file which depended upon the packing
     method, and I'm sure that considerable inconvenience was caused to
     sysops throughout the net.  Much of this could have been avoided by
     simply giving notice that the change was coming.  Doing it without
     warning was, at best, inconsiderate; at worst, excessively
     annoying.

     Second was the motivation for the act itself.  I was amazed, upon
     reading the editorial, to find that I had been forced to use
     products of SEA.  Silly me!  All these years I've been unpacking
     FidoNews using non-SEA products, and that was wrong!  Strange,
     though.  For a year I distributed FidoNews throughout zone 1, and
     I never touched it with an SEA product.  SEA releases a new version
     of a product I don't use, and the packing method changes for
     FidoNews.  A new brand of logic is born.

     So, whoever you are, mystery editorial writer and packer of
     FidoNews, thank you so much for breaking my system.  So that you
     could make a silly political statement, hundreds of people were
     inconvenienced.  Cheap at twice the price?

     I can remember when the editor of FidoNews CARED about FidoNet.
     That is obviously no longer the case.  FidoNews has become a tool
     for making political statements, rather than anything resembling a
     newsletter.  That's truly sad.

     FidoNews, we'll miss you.

     LHArc vs. ARC(r) vs. Zoo and FidoNews - Or what a rude awakening
     Robert Heller
     Locks Hill BBS
     1:321/153.0
     (InterNet:  heller@cs.umass.edu)

     I was  somewhat  irked  when  Harry  Lee  decided  to  change the
     packaging of FidoNews  Vol  7,  No  31.    It didn't arrive at my
     system last Monday (no  big deal - it is occasonally late).  What
     did arrive (in the NESYSOP  EchoMail  conference) was a note from
     Harry letting us NE sysops know  that the format had changed.  It
     would have been better if Harry had  given  some notice so people
     could have had a chance to either have  some  input  or  at least
     prepare for the change.

     My system is somewhat usual - I run CP/M-68K  on  a  Stride  440.
     Under CP/M-68K I have exactly two archival programs:  a  CP/M-68K
     port  of a UNIX port of ARC (r) 5.12 and a  version  of  LU310  I
     wrote  for  CP/M-68K.    I'm  planning on changing the OS of this
     beast to  OS-9/68K,  but  that won't happen until I get a FidoNet
     package running on  my  other  system, a Force CPU-30, which runs
     OS-9/68K on a 68030.  *I* neither own nor use (or have access to)
     MS-DOS systems (at work I  use  VAXes,  Suns,  LISP Machines, and
     soon  DECStations,  at  home  68K systems).    Until  about  last
     Wednesday, I did not have LHArc on  any  of  these machines.  The
     only LHArc sources I had were one set  in  assembler and a set in
     ANSI Draft C.  The assembler sources are useless  to me, since it
     is 8086 assembler and the ANSI Draft C sources are  not  a  whole
     lot  better (only the VAX/VMS C compiler is close enough to  ANSI
     Draft C to have any hope of compiling it).  I had  all of this on
     the "back burnner" - something to port (rewrite) after many other
     things had been done - probably in 6 months.

     Needless to say,  when Harry's message arrived on my system I was
     rather irked.  Suddenly, I was effectively cuttoff from my weekly
     dose of FidoNews.  While  I could live without FidoNews, the same
     could not be said of NodeDiffs.   True, they are still in ARC (r)
     5.12 format - but if someone decided  to change them to LHArc (or
     worse ZIP or PAK), I'd be instandly screwed.   I'd be effectively
     dumped off of the net.

     The only save was I just happened to notice a version of LHArc on
     UUNET.UU.NET  while    crusing  through  the  index  files  under
     comp.sources.misc (I was looking for something else at the time).
     This was a port  of  LHArc to generic UNIX (more or less).  After
     some fussing I managed to  compile  it  on  a  Sun  4 under SunOS
     (UNIX) and this past Thursday running  on  my  Force  CPU-30.   I
     don't  think  I'll even try to get  it  running  on  my  CP/M-68K
     machine (it wants too many exotic functions not  in  the CP/M-68K
     CLIB).    Meanwhile,  since  the  sysop  of my hub  has  gone  on
     vacation, I have to download FidoNews from my NC's machine.

     Oh  one  other  thing:  LHArc might be freeware and  the  sources
     readily  available,  but   those  sources  are  not  particularly
     "portable".  Maybe not  as  god  aweful as ARC (r) 5.12's sources
     (complete  with  non-standard pre-processor and  tons  of  MS-DOS
     specific  library  and  system  calls),  but   still  not  really
     portable.  This is unfortunately true of  many  MS-DOS  programs.
     Please people, a little thought and a bit  of carefull design can
     save  a fellow programmer many hours of hair-pulling hassle.    I
     allways try to isolate O/S specific functions in a separate  file
     and avoid unnecessary use of non-standard constructions or when I
     do need to use them I bracket them with #ifdef's.

     Comments welcome.    My  machine  runs FTS-0001 during Zone 1 ZMH
     (2400  BAUD  max)   or  you  crash  routed  netmail  via  my  hub
     (1:321/152), which is a  CM HST/DS system running BinkleyTerm.  I
     poll 1:321/152 three times a  day  (a  1/2 hour before ZMH, a 1/2
     hour after ZMH, and at noon Eastern time).

     Robert Heller, Locks Hill BBS, 1:321/153.0
     Oh, BTW:  If anyone else  out  there  in  FidoNet  land  needs  a
     version of LHArc for OS-9/68K I'd be  happy to send you a copy of
     the sources.  Not lightning fast (Zoo is a lot faster), but seems
     to work.

     Sid Rogers
     Fido (1:324/100)
     August 4, 1990

                          "One FidoNet Policy"

     FidoNet deserves one complete policy. A guideline to serve all
     the membership. A single document that provides all the guidance
     and provision we, as single node operators, Hub, Network,
     Regional or Zone Coordinators can reasonably expect to need.

     The current Policy4 document is lacking certain democratic
     provisions which Pablo Kleinman, with other contributors, strove
     to address in "World Policy Document"(WPD), version 1f,
     published here in FidoNews 730. WPD is a fine piece of work
     demonstrating what can be achieved through thoughtful
     considerations of the democratic process; but, it leaves way
     too many holes open for an international policy document.

     I propose we negotiate, draft or divine ONE policy document and
     that document subscribes to the "Four Corners Rule". Under the
     presented WPD, an individual node would be subjected to the WPD
     Policy, Zone Policy, Regional Policy, Network Policy, Hub
     Policy, FTS Policy and EchoMail Policy (if there is one or
     one gets passed). That's just too many "Policy" documents!

     The "Four Corners Rule" means if it isn't within the "four
     corners" of the policy document it isn't policy; that one does
     not have to look elsewhere for guidance; that everything is
     covered by one all inclusive, specific document. That means
     the basic policy, the minimum acceptable technical standards,
     standards of practice and echomail policy are all in ONE
     "official" document.

     Tech standards, standards of practice and Email Policy can be
     attached as either exhibits or amended articles or by any
     other means that firmly attaches them to the one, specific,
     democratically approved policy document.

     While the "Four Corners Rule" is the principle problem with the
     proposed WPD, there are other gaps, too.  These are Financial
     Disclosure, Network Sovereignty, Policy Complaint Penalties,
     Standards of Practice, EchoMail Fees, and Conference Standards.

     FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

     Their are two separate financial disclosure issues neither of
     which are directly addressed by WPD. The first is an individual
     nodes absolute right to privacy regarding its financial status.
     I hold that an individual's financial arrangements are no one
     else's business; that no other node may demand an accounting of
     any other node's operation and that such a demand goes beyond
     "excessively annoying". I would also extend this to network
     financial arrangements which I consider sacrosanct to the
     network itself.

     FidoNews 7-32                Page 6                    6 Aug 1990


     This raises the second disclosure problem. Certainly if there is
     any "cost sharing" plan within a network that those
     participating should have access to those accounting records
     which must be kept for inspection. But such inspection is
     specifically limited to the parties involved. That means Network
     XXX cannot demand Network YYY open its books, if any, for
     inspection.

     Only the principals involved may reasonably expect a full and
     complete accounting.

     NETWORK SOVEREIGNTY

     I suggest each and every network is sovereign respective to its
     own region. That means individual members of Network XXX cannot
     directly call for action or make any demands, whatsoever, on
     Network YYY; that such an attempt at intervention goes way
     beyond "excessively annoying".

     If there is a dispute between Networks, then a formal policy
     must be followed to redress the grievance. Something of the
     order that a plurality of network nodes petition the NC who
     acts on their behalf to file a grievance against the offending
     network with the RC.

     POLICY COMPLAINT PENALTIES

     If any penalties are to be imposed by any mediator then these
     penalties need to be specific. I suggest FidoNet establish
     at least three, formal penalty classes: Explusion, Censure and
     Reprimand.

     Explusion

     You're outta here! Causes or crimes for explusion need to be as
     specific as possible. But it means you are outta FidoNet.

     Censure

     Less drastic that explusion but to carry a mandatory "down"
     listing in the nodelist for a specific time not to exceed, say,
     one year.

     Reprimand

     Less serious than Censure but to carry a mandatory "down"
     listing in the nodelist for a specific time not to exceed, say,
     thirty days or three nodediffs.

     I feel it absolutely paramount that penalties be specified and
     meted out according to defined World Policy; not at and on the
     whim of an individual moderator.
     FidoNews 7-32                Page 7                    6 Aug 1990


     STANDARDS OF PRACTICE

     Current Standards of Practices (SOPs) are not necessarily all
     that specific. Maybe they don't need to be; but, as of the last
     FidoNews publication some folk seem to feel others must not
     break their off-line processing procedures by sending them a
     file in a flavor they didn't expect. If the majority concurs
     then formal SOPs should be clearly defined and included in the
     final WPD.

     ECHOMAIL FEES

     What! You mean I gotta pay? No. Fees for mail and "cost sharing"
     plans should be defined and regulated in the WPD. Some places,
     like mine for instance, fall into the "you can't get there from
     here" category. We've worked it out (actually Jim Greely has
     worked it out) and mail freely arrives for the time being. But
     others are not so fortunate and cost is a very real factor. As
     an organization, FidoNet should endeavor to remove all costs
     via any means at its disposal while at the same time overseeing
     fees or "cost sharing" and regulating same.

     CONFERENCE STANDARDS

     I firmly believe the WPD should include specific subsections
     dealing with the WORLDCON and ZoneCONS. This section should
     include selection procedures, minimum standards, if any, and
     policy regarding "seed funds" together with financial disclosure
     provisions.

     CONCLUSION

     While the efforts to reduce the length of the WPD are greatly
     appreciated, now is the time to put an end to vagueness and add
     more specificity to the final document, creating ONE true World
     FidoNet Policy on which the membership at large can embrace
     knowing all their "rights" are truly protected.

     batch file, which I'll share with you :

      @echo ---NEWSPROC---
       if not exist c:\netfiles\fnews*.* goto End
       cd \fidonews
       for %%o in ( fnews*.* ) do set OLDNEWS=%%o
       cd \netfiles
       for %%n in ( fnews*.* ) do set NEWNEWS=%%n
       cd \binkley
       if "%OLDNEWS%" == "%NEWNEWS%" goto Dupenews
       del c:\fidonews\fnews*.*
       copy \netfiles\fnews*.* \fidonews\
       del \netfiles\fnews*.*
       goto End

      :Dupenews
       del \netfiles\fnews*.*
       goto End

      :End
       set OLDNEWS=
       set NEWNEWS=

     Actually, there is a little more to it than this, for example,
     right after the netfiles delete, there is a call to a robot
     sender.  But you get the idea.  The environment variable
     comparison does the trick of avoiding duplicate file
     processing.


     New Software --

     Last week, rather than writing this column, I installed Binkley
     2.40 and Opus 1.13.  These were both upgrades ( from 2.30 and
     from 1.03, respectively ).  This column is a lot more fun.

     I have a lot of source code changes to Binkley which I like to
     run. Unfortunately for me, I had scrapped the Microsoft C 5.1
     compiler in favor of 6.0, and this caused several problems in
     porting my changes from 2.30.  Not the least of which is,
     nobody else seems to be able to run my version of the program !

     One of the less fancy/more useful features is a RingTries Bink
     config parameter, I usually set it to 4.  On a dial out, if the
     other modem is RINGING 4 times, Bink gives up, hangs up and
     reports NO ANSWER.  I believe this is an important feature
     because I don't think you should leave your line 'off hook'
     when your system goes off line.

     As for Opus, well, it's nice, except for the 'A' area change
     command.  In the old Opus, the 'A' command would give you a
     list of areas.  The new Opus gives you a secondary menu, and
     you have to enter again.  Of course, this is not explained in
     the menu, it just happens that I can't type "shift ?" without
     lifting my shoulder !

     The Opus install program quit with a run time error, but seemed
     to do enough that I didn't bother to try it again.  I guess I
     knew enough to be prepared for that. But now it runs, and I get
     to save about 650k by no longer needing the old style nodelist.

     Man oh man, that Nodelist sure is big, isn't it ?


     Interesting Code Section --

     I came across some assembly language that uses the CPU
     pre-fetch queue to determine what type of CPU is present, and
     whether or not the program is being executed by a debugger.  It
     uses self modifying code which will run or not run depending on
     whether the CPU has pre-fetched the modified instruction.  If
     you run the self-modifying code under a DEBUGGER, the pre-fetch
     queue is circumvented by the debugger's execution of the
     program instructions.  For example :

             mov     al,L2             ; possible address
             lea     si,L0+1           ; modify address
             cli
             mov     [si],al           ; overwrite jmp destination
       L0:   jmp     SHORT L1          ; if trace active, goes to L2
                                       ;   else goes to L1
       L1:   sti                       ; normal running address
             ...
       L2:   sti                       ; being traced address

     The overwrite instruction will always modify the memory, but if
     the pre-fetch queue of the CPU has already read the instruction
     at L0, ( before the mov is executed ) then the jump will occur
     as coded.  If a debugger is active, the CPU will not have
     pre-fetched the jmp instruction, and the jump will go the
     overwritten address, L2.

     Now the CPU detection code ( don't try to trace it ! ) :

             xor     ax,ax               ; clear ax
             lea     si,L1+1             ; attempt to set
             mov     BYTE PTR [si],al    ;   al to zero
             nop                         ; queue fill
             nop                         ;
         L1: mov     al,1                ; al=1 if not i8088
             lea     si,L2+1             ; attempt to set
             mov     BYTE PTR [si],al    ;   al to zero or one
             nop                         ; queue fill
             nop                         ;
             nop                         ;
             nop                         ;
         L2: mov     al,2                ; al=2 if i386

     The resulting values of al=0 : i8088, al=1 if i8086 or i286, or
     al=2 if i386.  PC Magazine has a WHATCPU utility that uses stack
     and flag instructions to tell you exactly what CPU your program
     is running on ( see V9N13 ).


     'Hun'ey Checks In --

     Of course the airlines destroyed Honey's bags, so right off
     there's a couple of hundred.  She and Kevin call everyday, so
     there's another hundred.  Taking everyone out for dinner, more
     hundreds.  New clothes, glassware, etc. : more hundreds.

     Jutland, visiting cousins : hundreds. Will go to Legoland
     ( a hundred ) and probably Germany ( several hundred ).

     Hundred, hundred, hundred.  Hun is Danish for 'she', dread is
     English for 'extreme anxiety'. Hundred, hundred, hundred.
