FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
From: RanD (1:141/1030)

Announcing Connecticut's First Electronic Barn Raising

Hartford, CT, April 24 -- Emphasizing the need for all of Connecticut's
children to be able to access the Information Superhighway, a broad
based citizen effort is underway to connect all elementary and secondary
schools and public libraries to the Internet. This ambitious project was
announced today at the State Library.

The effort is spearheaded by John Larson, former president of the
Connecticut State Senate and currently a senior research fellow at Yale
University's Bush Center on Child Development and Public Policy. When
asked why he started such an undertaking, Larson stated, "This is an
extraordinary opportunity to develop a template for cooperation that
will enhance our children's ability to compete in a global economy."

ConneCT '96 is modeled after a similar effort in California where 17,000
trained citizen volunteers wired 2,600 schools in one afternoon. Janice
Gruendel, Project Manager for ConneCT '96 and Co-Director of Citizens
for Connecticut's Children and Youth, talked about the initiative. "On
September 28th, ConneCT '96 volunteers will wire participating public
libraries along with K-12 schools, using wiring kits that cost about
$600 and include a high-speed modem. Importantly, this effort builds
upon the wonderfill work already begun in Connecticut to bring students
into the global information age," Gruendel stated.

The electronic hub of ConneCT '96 is its web site, designed and hosted
by DynaMind of Avon, Connecticut. At this site, schools, libraries,
citizen volunteers and organizational sponsors can register to
participate. The site is located on the Intemet at the following
address: http://www.connect96.org.

Some of the educational and parent organizations that have already
joined the effort include the Connecticut PTA, the Connecticut Education
Association, the Connecticut State Federation of Teachers, and the
Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents.

Corporations are also joining the effort. Today's announcement comes
with the support of one of the State's largest businesses. Howard
Taylor, President, S.N.E.T Custom Business Group, announced that
Southern New England Telephone will become the official ConneCT '96
Internet provider by offering one year of free Internet access to
participating ConneCT '96 schools and public libraries. "In this dawning
information age, we want to do our part to ensure well-educated
students," remarked Taylor at the press conference.

The ConneCT '96 initiative will also include a fall symposium, sponsored
by S.N.E.T., in conjunction with the Vice Presidential Debate being held
in Hartford on October 2. At the symposium, Governor John Rowland and
Vice President Al Gore will send email messages to participating schools
and libraries. Symposium attendees will work to define next steps to
further enhance the Internet's role in education.

ConneCT '96 is guided by a broad-based citizen Steering Committee,
including members of the Connecticut General Assembly and the State
Department of Education. A Technical Advisory Network is being formed to
assist the community volunteer effort. A Media Committee will provide
ongoing information to the public.

For more information, to learn how to "adopt" a school, or to register
if you do not have access to the Internet, contact Citizens for
Connecticut's Children and Youth at 203-498-4240.
