                          FidoNet Gateway Policy
                          ----------------------

     I have accepted the following document, the final draft version
     of the FidoNet Gateway Policy, and it will be implemented as part
     of FidoNet policy commencing immediately upon publication of this
     issue of FidoNews.

     I'm sure I'd better follow that statement immediately with some
     points of clarification:

      o When the first draft of the document was published in January,
        a few people assumed it was designed to cut off communication
        with other networks, especially FidoNet-technology (or 'break-
        away') networks. This is entirely incorrect.

      o The document is an attempt to establish a valid technical base
        for increasing contact between the various networks. It is
        designed to encourage communication between FidoNet and
        _all_ other networks.

      o The document was revised after publication in an attempt to
        correct areas where its intent was clearly misunderstood. Its
        implementation was further intentionally delayed to allow
        discussion of its content, and an international echomail
        conference was established for that purpose.

      o This is definitely not a case of FidoNet telling others how to
        run their nets. We are saying how others should behave when
        present in our network, just as they should have the right
        to say how we should behave when 'guests' in their 'house'.

      o Please note where I said "commencing" in the opening paragraph
        -- we will, naturally, allow time for adjustment where anyone
        thinks that is necessary.

     The Gateway Policy deliberately does not specify implementation
     details. There are many ways to achieve its requirements, several
     of which already exist in experimental or released software. The
     aim was to specify the 'end', leaving the 'means' to the software
     authors and users who have made our 'hobby' a hub of pioneering
     creativity.

     I thank everyone involved for their work on the document,
     especially Tim Pearson and David Dodell for their effort,
     perseverence and, in the end, patience.

                 FidoNet(tm) Internetwork Gateway Policy

     Section 1 - Purpose
     ===================

          This document sets forth the administrative policy  require-
     ments  for interconnection between the FidoNet  amateur  interna-
     tional  electronic  mail network and other electronic  mail  net-
     works.

          As  an  amateur network, membership in FidoNet is  open  and
     available  to  any  individual or group capable  of  meeting  the
     technical  challenge  and willing to  participate  constructively
     within  the  technical  and  administrative  guidelines  employed
     within  FidoNet.  FidoNet desires to extend this idea, "The  free
     exchange  of information," to include other electronic mail  net-
     works.  While connectivity with other networks can be  beneficial
     to all parties involved, it cannot be expected to operate smooth-
     ly  unless the parties involved understand and agree  to  observe
     technical  and administrative guidelines designed to promote  the
     orderly flow of traffic between networks and to provide a  mecha-
     nism for problem resolution should problems arise.  This document
     intends to address those points.


     Section 2 - Definitions
     =======================

     "FidoNet"
     ---------
          An  amateur electronic mail wide area network consisting  of
     several  thousand  computer systems world wide.   Most  of  these
     systems  operate electronic bulletin board (BBS) software  giving
     each system the capability to provide electronic mail services to
     up to several hundred users.  Detailed information on the techni-
     cal  and  organizational aspects of the FidoNet mail  network  is
     beyond  the scope of this document.  Further information  can  be
     obtained from various FidoNet publications including the  FidoNet
     official policy document.


     "Other Network"
     ---------------
     FidoNews 7-45                Page 3                    5 Nov 1990


          The term "Other Network" will be used in this document as  a
     shorthand  term referring to any other electronic  mail  network,
     whether inherently compatible with the technology employed within
     FidoNet  or not.  This term will often be used to refer  specifi-
     cally to the electronic mail network making application to  Fido-
     Net for a "Gateway" (defined below).


     "Gateway"
     ---------
           A gateway is a system of computers equipped with the  hard-
     ware  and  software necessary to pass  electronic  mail  messages
     (possibly  of  various types, see below) between  FidoNet  and  a
     specific Other Network.  A Gateway acts as a translator, allowing
     messages  entered on a system in the Other Network and  addressed
     to a destination within FidoNet to be translated into a form that
     is technically acceptable to and compatible with FidoNet and vice
     versa.   All  messages originated in the Other  Network  and  ad-
     dressed  to  a destination within FidoNet are first routed  to  a
     Gateway.

           At a Gateway, the message is made technically acceptable to
     and  compatible  with FidoNet and forwarded into  FidoNet's  wide
     area  network for delivery to its final destination.   A  message
     originated  within FidoNet and addressed to a destination  within
     the Other Network is handled in a similar manner.


     "Netmail"
     ---------
          The  term  Netmail,  as used within FidoNet,  refers  to  an
     electronic mail message that is addressed to a specific  physical
     destination.   Netmail messages can be addressed to a  particular
     individual  at the destination site. Public messages can be  read
     by  users other than the named addressee while  private  messages
     cannot  typically  be read by any user other than the  named  ad-
     dressee and the system administrator/operator at the  destination
     site. Further information on Netmail is available in other  Fido-
     Net technical and policy documents.


     "Conference Mail"
     -----------------
          Echomail  is the term used within FidoNet to refer to  elec-
     tronic "Conference Mail" messages that, while possibly containing
     the  name  of  a particular individual in the  "To:"  field,  are
     copied  and  distributed to multiple (possibly  several  hundred)
     destination  systems.  Some Other Networks refer to their  analo-
     gous  capability  under  the terms  "GroupMail"  or  "newsgroup".
     Echomail  messages are segregated into "Conferences"  based  upon
     the  topic being discussed.  Echomail message content is  usually
     restricted  to the topic(s) for which the  particular  conference
     was  created.  Several hundred Echomail conferences exist  within
     FidoNet dedicated to topics ranging from technical discussions of
     various computer systems and peripherals to philosophy and  reli-
     gion.   Further information on Echomail can be obtained  by  con-
     FidoNews 7-45                Page 4                    5 Nov 1990


     sulting other FidoNet technical and policy documents.


     "FidoNet Technology Network" (FTN)
     ----------------------------------
           For  the purposes of this document, a  "FidoNet  Technology
     Network" (FTN) shall be defined as an Other Network whose message
     format  and  transmission protocols strictly meet  the  technical
     requirements set forth by the FidoNet Technical Standards Commit-
     tee  (FTSC).  FidoNet Technology Networks are inherently  techni-
     cally  compatible with FidoNet.  Connectivity options are  avail-
     able  to FTN's that are not (for technical reasons) available  to
     non-FTN Other Networks.


     Internetwork Coordinator (INC)
     ------------------------------
          The Internetwork Coordinator is the individual within  Fido-
     Net  who has the responsibility for overseeing the granting,  in-
     stallation, and maintenance of FidoNet to Other Network Gateways.
     The INC shall be designated by and act as the agent of the  Fido-
     Net International Coordinator.


     Multi-Network (MultiNet)
     ------------------------
          A "multinet" is a type of "super" network whose function  is
     to provide connectivity between many other networks and to  allow
     bidirectional communication between these networks.


     Duplicate Message
     -----------------
          Because  of the technology employed by some FidoNet  Confer-
     ence  Mail distribution systems, improper routing information  or
     topology can cause multiple copies of the same message text to be
     delivered  to  FidoNet  systems. A duplicate message  is  as  any
     message  arriving at a FidoNet node whose message body (the  text
     entered  by the human originator of the message) is identical  to
     the  message  body of a previously  received  message.   Messages
     manually forwarded to another recipient are not considered dupli-
     cates for the purposes of this document.


     Section 3 - Administrative Guidelines
     =====================================

          This  section  is  intended to  outline  the  administrative
     framework  under  which Other Networks may  connect  to  FidoNet.
     FidoNet  reserves the right to reject any Other  Network  Gateway
     application for any reason.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 5                    5 Nov 1990


     3.1 - Other Network Connectivity to FidoNet Through "MultiNets"
     ---------------------------------------------------------------
          FidoNet may elect to seek and obtain connectivity to various
     multinet host facilities for the purposes of communicating with a
     wide range of Other Networks.  Any Other Network that desires  to
     communicate with FidoNet may elect to facilitate such  communica-
     tion  via the multinet.  However, FidoNet reserves the  right  to
     refuse  to deliver incoming message traffic arriving via such  an
     arrangement based upon the guidelines set forth in this document.


     An Example:

          FidoNet is now gated into Internet via UUCP.  It has  agreed
     to  the  terms  and conditions necessary for  membership  in  and
     connectivity  to  the  Internet  multi-network  "umbrella".   One
     obvious method for achieving connectivity to FidoNet (and a whole
     host  of  other wide area networks) is for the Other  Network  to
     apply to Internet for a gateway.  Under this scenario, the  Other
     Network is bound by the terms and conditions of Internet just  as
     FidoNet is.  In this peer relationship, the terms and  conditions
     stated in this document are used by FidoNet to determine if Other
     Network  message traffic arriving at a  FidoNet/Internet  gateway
     will be accepted into FidoNet.



     3.2 - Connectivity Only Through Mutually Recognized Gateways
     ------------------------------------------------------------
          While  FidoNet has no desire to inhibit  experimentation  or
     connectivity  between  consenting systems it  must  maintain  the
     technical  and administrative integrity of its  network.   Hence-
     forth, FidoNet will not permit non-FidoNet addresses to appear in
     any addressing or routing control  fields  (Some current examples
     include: the "From" or "To" address fields, the "* Origin" lines,
     the "seen-by"  fields, or the "^APath" fields.) of any netmail or
     echomail messages traveling on any portion of FidoNet's wide area
     network.   This  restriction applies to all  present  and  future
     FidoNet  nodes.  FidoNet nodes who wish to participate  in  Other
     Networks  may  do  so but must insure that  all  message  traffic
     transmitted  to other FidoNet systems contain only valid  FidoNet
     addresses in the addressing and routing control fields. The Fido-
     Net coordinators will enforce this requirement and are authorized
     by the International  Coordinator to  take whatever action may be
     necessary to prevent non-FidoNet addresses  from  entering  Fido-
     Net, including  without limitation, referring the offending nodes
     to this document and to the InterNetwork Coordinator for informa-
     tion on  how to  establish proper Gateways. The sole exception to
     this requirement is set forth in the following paragraph:


     FidoNews 7-45                Page 6                    5 Nov 1990


          The  exchange  of  message traffic, on  an  experimental  or
     private  and closely controlled basis, between an  Other  Network
     and  a system or systems that happen to be members of FidoNet  is
     permitted  and encouraged if such message traffic is confined  to
     the consenting FidoNet systems and is not allowed to travel on or
     to any portion of FidoNet's wide area network that has not previ-
     ously  consented to carry such traffic and if  such  connectivity
     does  not  prohibit  the FidoNet system(s)  from  fulfilling  the
     technical  and  policy requirements necessary for  membership  in
     FidoNet.  FidoNet requests that the INC be informed of  such  ar-
     rangements  so that any unintentional "leakage" of Other  Network
     message  traffic into FidoNet's wide area network may be  rapidly
     isolated and corrected.

          The  exchange of message traffic between any  Other  Network
     and  FidoNet  on any basis other than the one  mentioned  in  the
     paragraph  above shall only be done through  mutually  recognized
     and  proper Gateways meeting the requirements set forth  in  this
     document.


     3.3 - Administrative Agreement and Registration
     -----------------------------------------------
          FidoNet requires that an Administrative agreement be execut-
     ed by and between the individual(s) responsible for the  adminis-
     tration of the Other Network and the FidoNet International  Coor-
     dinator, or the IC's authorized agent. This agreement should out-
     line, at a minimum, the following items:

          1 -  The name of the organization.

          2  - The  name,  address, and  voice  telephone  number
               where the  administrator of the Other Network  may
               be reached. (Administrative contact and  responsi-
               ble party).

          3 -  A brief description of the organization.

          4  - The name, address and voice telephone number where
               the individual(s) responsible for the operation of
               the   FidoNet/Other  Network  Gateway(s)  may   be
               reached. (Technical Contact(s))

          5  - A  list of computer system(s)  requesting  Gateway
               status  containing the following information:

               o    The  name  of the gateway system as  it  will
                    appear in the  FidoNet nodelist.

               o    The Locality, State / Province / Department /
                    etc.,  and  Country   where  the  Gateway  is
     FidoNews 7-45                Page 7                    5 Nov 1990


                    physically located.

               o    The name of the system administrator for  the
                    particular Gateway.

               o    The  complete data telephone number  for  the
                    Gateway, including country code.

               o    The maximum baud rate supported by the  Gate-
                    way and all modem standards supported.

               o    The  hours  during  which  the  Gateway  will
                    support FidoNet dial up mail sessions.  (*SEE
                    NOTE BELOW*)

               o    The  date the Gateway is expected  to  become
                    operational.

               o    The  FidoNet compatible  session  protocol(s)
                    supported

               o    If  the Gateway is now a member  of  FidoNet,
                    the zone, net, and node number of the FidoNet
                    system applying for Gateway status.


              NOTE: For a system to be granted Gateway status, it
                    must  at least be available for FidoNet  dial
                    up mail sessions during the FidoNet dedicated
                    mail  period  for  the  geographic   locality
                    concerned.    FidoNet  calls  its   mandatory
                    dedicated  mail period the "Zone Mail  Hour".
                    The time for "Zone Mail Hour" varies through-
                    out the world and can be found in Appendix  A
                    of the current FidoNet Policy Document.

          6.   A  clearly  worded statement indicating  that  the
               responsible  party in the Other Network and  Fido-
               Net agree to the terms and conditions set forth in
               the  Administrative  Agreement and those  in  this
               document  (included by reference as a part of  the
               agreement).

     3.4 - Application of FidoNet Administrative Policy
     --------------------------------------------------
          For  the purposes of applying FidoNet policy,  FidoNet  will
     view  the entire Other Network as a single FidoNet  "node"  under
     the  control of the individual named as the "Administrative  Con-
     tact/Responsible  Party" (or an authorized agent thereof) in  the
     administrative  agreement outlined in paragraph 3.3  above.   All
     other systems and their users will be viewed by FidoNet as  users
     on  the  "responsible party's" node for the purposes  of  FidoNet
     official policy application.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 8                    5 Nov 1990


          FidoNet  holds  the operator of a FidoNet  node  responsible
     (from  an  administrative policy standpoint) for the  actions  of
     that  node's users, subordinate "point" systems, and the  "point"
     system's  users.  FidoNet views single or multiple Other  Network
     Gateways  as a single "boss" node under the control of  the  "re-
     sponsible  party" and will apply FidoNet official policy  accord-
     ingly.  FidoNet reserves the right to sever links to one or  more
     of  the Other Network's Gateways as its final remedy  for  viola-
     tions  of  administrative  policy.  (see  the  paragraph   titled
     "Points"  in  the  "Overview" section and  the  paragraph  titled
     "Responsible  for All Traffic Entering FidoNet Via the  Node"  in
     the  "Sysop  Procedures"  section of  FidoNet's  official  policy
     document, for further information).


     3.5 - Supported Message Types
     -----------------------------
          FidoNet will grant Gateway interconnection for the  purposes
     of exchanging messages of the type defined above as "Netmail" and
     optionally  for the purposes of exchanging messages of  the  type
     defined  above  as "Echomail".  FidoNet will  not  grant  Gateway
     interconnection  for the purposes of exchanging "Echomail"  only.
     The ability to generate a private and personal "Netmail" reply to
     an  "Echomail" message is one of the basic facets of FidoNet  and
     cannot be compromised.


     3.6 - Acceptance Criteria (All Other Networks)
     ----------------------------------------------
          The  granting of Other Network Gateways into FidoNet is  not
     automatic  nor is it based solely on the Other Network's  ability
     to demonstrate technical compliance with the objectives set forth
     in section 4 below.  Some other criteria include:

          o    The Other Network should have an individual  will-
               ing and able to carry out the role of "Responsible
               Party"  as  defined  herein.  The  Other   Network
               "administration"  should  be willing  to  help  in
               assuring  that technical, social, and  administra-
               tive policy standards are consistently met in  all
               message  traffic  emanating from  the  Gateway(s).
               FidoNet pledges to do likewise.

          o    The Other Network must have demonstrable  stabili-
               ty.   It should have been in operation as  a  free
               standing  network for a period of time  sufficient
               to  prove its reliability.  It should be  able  to
               prove that it has the technical and administrative
               expertise to maintain and regulate reliable  Gate-
               ways over an extended period of time.

     3.7 - Other Criteria (FTN Other Networks)
     -----------------------------------------
          Current FidoNet compatible software allows a system to  par-
     ticipate  simultaneously  in  FidoNet  and in other FTN networks,
     completely isolating one network from the other; i.e., using only
     valid FidoNet addresses in FidoNet traffic and only valid  Other-
     Net addresses in OtherNet traffic.  This "isolated dual identity"
     approach is simple to use  and eliminates  any need for gateways,
     administrative  controls,  written  agreements, etc.  An OtherNet
     node wishing to participate in FidoNet  simply does so, isolating
     their  own  memberships  similarly to separating participation in
     Compu$erve and the Internet.

          This approach allows for FidoNet connectivity on  a  node by
     node basis, speeds mail transfers (since messages  from each node
     enter FidoNet's wide area network at the point  of  origin rather
     than having to first pass  through  a  Gateway),  gives each node
     contact with a nearby FidoNet coordinator to provide FidoNet ser-
     vices more  effectively,  and  eliminates possible administrative
     policy conflicts between the OtherNet and FidoNet as the node ad-
     heres  to  FidoNet  policy  in  FidoNet and to OtherNet policy in
     OtherNet message traffic.  Given the simplicity and advantages of
     the isolated dual-identity scheme  and  the non-trivial technical
     and administrative work of maintaining  gateways and policies for
     linked/gatewayed  OtherNet  connections  to  FidoNet, there is an
     onus on OtherNets wishing to gate to FidoNet to show mutually be-
     neficial  technical  and/or  social  considerations  which  would
     justify the work of setting up gateways and administrative agree-
     ments as opposed to merely encouraging OtherNet nodes who wish to
     participate in FidoNet to do so  in  the  simple  isolated  dual-
     identity fashion discussed  above.  This is not meant to preclude
     gateways  to  FTN  OtherNets, but rather to place an onus to show
     cause in order to  reduce  trivial or unnecessary formal gateways
     and gateway agreements.


     3.8 - Shared Echomail Conferences
     ---------------------------------
          Echomail conferences shared between networks must be  regis-
     tered  with the appropriate FidoNet echomail coordinator.  It  is
     the  responsibility  of  the  Other  Network  and  its   Echomail
     source(s)  within FidoNet to insure that proper topology  is  ob-
     served  between the FidoNet / Other Network Gateway(s)  and  that
     duplicate  echomail messages do not enter FidoNet.  It cannot  be
     overemphasized that all message traffic emanating from a  Gateway
     must  contain only valid FidoNet addresses in the  message's  ad-
     dressing and routing fields.  Current examples  include,  without
     limitation, the "from" and "to" addresses in the  message header,
     the *ORIGIN line  address,  the  SEEN BY addresses and the ^APath
     addresses.

     3.9 - Network Integrity
     -----------------------
          In  the event that FidoNet determines that significant  harm
     is  being  caused  to the technical or social  integrity  of  its
     network, it may immediately sever links between the Other Network
     Gateway(s)  and  FidoNet.  FidoNet will make all  reasonable  at-
     tempts  to  contact the "Responsible Party" as soon  as  possible
     (before  the severing of links if possible) to inform  the  Other
     Network of the problem and to work toward its resolution.


     Section 4 - Technical Objectives
     ================================

          At this time, FidoNet has not published a detailed technical
     standard  for Gateways.  FidoNet reserves the right  to  develop,
     implement,  and require adherence to such a standard at a  future
     date.  In the mean time, the following general guidelines are set
     forth for Other Networks that desire to communicate with FidoNet.


     4.1 - Technical Standards within FidoNet
     ----------------------------------------
          The  FidoNet  Technical Standards Committee (FTSC)  has  de-
     veloped and published technical standards for message packets and
     mailer-to-mailer  protocols.  The Gateway system(s) must be  able
     to  assemble and transmit FidoNet standard message packets  using
     FidoNet  standard session protocol.  A gateway must also be  able
     to receive and disassemble FidoNet standard message packets using
     FidoNet  standard session protocol.  Translation from  the  Other
     Network's internal message format to FidoNet standard packets and
     vice versa is the responsibility of the Gateway.


     4.2 - Logical Other Network Address
     -----------------------------------
          Software  at  a Gateway shall modify each  message  entering
     FidoNet (whether Netmail or Echomail) such that FidoNet  software
     will  interpret the logical address of origin of the  message  as
     the Gateway's FidoNet address.


     4.3 - Physical Other Network Address
     ------------------------------------
          Software at a Gateway shall embed the Other Network  address
     (physical point of origin), in human readable form, at a predict-
     able  location  in  the message body immediately  preceded  by  a
     predictable identifier such that software designed to  facilitate
     the automatic inclusion of this information in FidoNet replies to
     Other  Network  messages will be able to glean  this  information
     from  the other text in the body of the message  reliably.   This
     requirement  applies to Other Network messages entering  FidoNet,
     both Netmail and Echomail.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 11                   5 Nov 1990


     4.4 - FidoNet to Other Network Addressing (Netmail)
     ---------------------------------------------------
          FidoNet users must be provided with a procedure for  routing
     what  FidoNet defines as "Netmail" to Other Network users  via  a
     Gateway.  FidoNet users will be instructed to address netmail  to
     Other  Network users to the FidoNet Zone:Net/Node address for  an
     Other Network Gateway.

          The  exact method by which these messages are  forwarded  to
     their  final destination within the Other Network is left to  the
     discretion  of the Other Network.  One obvious method is to  have
     the  FidoNet user enter the "physical Other Network  address"  in
     the proper location preceded by the proper identifier as outlined
     in  paragraph 4.4 above.  FidoNet will help the Other Network  in
     educating  FidoNet users on the proper form and location  of  the
     additional  address information necessary to route a  FidoNet  to
     Other Network message to its final destination automatically  via
     a  Gateway.  FidoNet netmail arriving at a Gateway with  improper
     Other Network addressing information must either be corrected and
     forwarded to the proper Other Network address or returned to  the
     FidoNet  sender with text inserted notifying the sender that  the
     message was undeliverable.


     4.5 - Echomail Standards
     ------------------------
          Echomail  entering FidoNet shall conform to  FidoNet  (FTSC)
     standard format.  FidoNet control, routing, and addressing infor-
     mation  in  each message shall show that it originated  from  the
     Gateway's FidoNet address. Internal Other Network routing  infor-
     mation (if any) attached to echomail messages must be removed  at
     the Gateway with the exception being the "Physical Other  Network
     Address" as defined in paragraph 4.3 above.

     =======================================


     5.1 - Interpretation
     --------------------
          FidoNet  retains the exclusive right to interpret the  terms

                          The Trouble with **C's

     I have followed with great interest the current topic being
     exposed in the FIDONEWS. Please note that I said the current
     topic (singular), because I feel that it all comes down to a
     determined effort by a few persons to take away the rights of
     free expression and communication that we currently enjoy
     (somewhat), and given to us by the US Constitution.

     Abortion, the budget mess, the taxes mess, the determined
     attempts at curtailing the free exchange of information in the
     nation's BBSs, and last but not least the ECHOPOL fiasco, are all
     directly related to a long and dangerous trend, of taking away
     the right of the people to decide their own lives.

     The fact that George Peace has singlehandedly raped the rest of
     us by imposing this outrageous piece of fiction on 8000 others,
     is strikingly similar to the way South Africa's white minority
     has over the years raped the black majority. It is pure and
     simple tiranical, detestable, terroristic and preposterous.

     The same way that the pro-lifers and pro-choicers attempt to
     force their views down everybody else's throat, and the same way
     that the US Congress has attempted to regulate the BBSs, and the
     same way that the control of this country have fallen in the
     hands of demigods in Washington, that seem to gain office for
     life, whithout hardly a peep from the people.

     I urge all, to let George know your views on this watchamacallit
     that he tries to force on the rest of us. I will hate the day
     when a few (less than 1%, by my count) **C's will determine
     policy that affects all of us, and even worst, gives a small
     minority, proprietorship of the soul of FIDONET (read echoes),
     that so many moderators have work so hard to set up and mold into
     the wonderful forums that we have grown accustomed to.

     It is not only amoral, it is also a disgrace that tactics better
     suited for China or someplace in the Third world are attempted
     here in the land of Jefferson, Hamilton and Lincoln.

     It is time that the Policy be ammended to force elections for all
     the **C's at regular intervals, not to far appart, to remind them
     who is in charge, not too close to give them time to learn the
     job. Elections, by the way, that include the body of FIDONET,
     that other 99% that George has forgotten about.

                     Domain Addressing Gateway


     I am proud to announce the existence of a Domain Addressing
     Gateway currently operating in Fidonet. I also must plead guilty
     of procrastination since I did volunteer to do this at Fidocon
     90, and its now almost three months later.

     Effective immediately, 1:1/100@fidonet will accept and deliver
     domain addressed netmail to the domains of:

        Fidonet
        Alternet
        Eggnet
        Rbbsnet
        Network
        Kinknet

     These networks are the only networks that I am aware of that are
     currently operating the domain gating software. As any other
     networks set up a node that can receive the domain addressed
     netmail, the list will be expanded. 1:1/100 will operate as a
     help node for domain questions, and hopefully will be able to
     talk Ralph Merritt (who compiled the existing network lists I
     worked from) into helping contact other networks.

     The software (originally written by Jim Nutt and hacked by Bob
     Hartman and Burt Juda) is available for file request by the
     magic name of "DOMAIN" from:

         1:13/13
         1:147/100
         1:107/528 (bark only)

     Also available for anyone interested in the technical area of
     Domains is a conference (both in Echo & Group formats) named
     "DMNGATES".  This conference should be available through the
     normal distribution channels.

     There are no requirements other then technical to be listed as a
     recognized domain. The technical requirement is that a node in
     the network be willing to setup the currently available software
     (or create a functionally compatible piece of software).  There
     are no geographical or network restrictions. The technical
     specifications for domain addressing are available in FSC-0038.

     The current software has been set up with Binkley / Seadog /
     Tims / and Frontdoor. It should function as is with most fidonet
     compatible software.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 18                   5 Nov 1990


     Domain addressing is the way of the future. It will allow a
     de-coupling of the nodelist that is getting too large to handle.
     As an example, the current Fidonet nodelist, in archived form,
     will not fit on a 360k disk. Using the domain method of
     addressing, a netmail message could be sent to any node in
     Fidonet, with only 1 phone number in the users nodelist. It also
     does away with the problems created by the duplicate z:net/node
     arrangement that is currently being used for inter network
     communications.  Zones were designed for different geographical
     locations in a network, not different networks. Domain
     addressing allows for the peaceful co-existence of different
     geographical or political subgroups, and for these groups to be
     treated as a fully independent network.

     I am looking forward to working with this new method of
     addressing, and the possibilities it allows us all in the
     future. And I wish to thank the "pushers" who finally got me
     moving; George Peace, Fabian Gordon, Burt Juda, and the rest of
     the people that have worked hard at getting Domains implemented.

     Have you ever though about sending something in for publication
     in FidoNews, but were put off by the submission requirements?  I
     know they aren't very stringent as to content (as recent
     discussions have mentioned, and proven!), but there are a lot of
     rules for the *format* of submissions.  They have to have
     particular file extensions, there are restrictions on right
     margins, you can't have funny control codes in the file (and how
     many of us are *sure* that our word processors aren't putting in
     the occasional "soft" return?), and you should also follow some
     "appearance" guidelines to make your article look nice (like
     having most lines flushleft, having most lines get near the 65
     column mark, having a table of contents line at the beginning of
     the article, etc.).

     The last time I sent an article to FidoNews I spent a few days
     worrying that I had done something wrong, missed a control code,
     had a bare linefeed or something equally disastrous, and that my
     article would be rejected and returned for corrections, or,
     worse, that I would be the cause of the editor having to do extra
     work to fix my blunders.  I hate it when that happens!  (And I'm
     sure the editor isn't too thrilled by it either...)

     It is easy enough to find out what the requirements and
     recommendations are (just F'Req. ARTSPEC), but it is harder to be
     sure you have not made some minor mistake, or missed a
     requirement, or had your word processor "help" you without your
     knowledge.

     I suspect that many people have been put off sending in an
     article more than once for fear of making a mistake, or not
     wanting to take the time to read ARTSPEC.  In many cases this may
     even be a Good Thing, but even so, I'm in favor of greasing the
     wheels of communication wherever I can and just count on being
     nimble enough to avoid getting run over in the ensuing rush of
     ideas.

     Being a programmer, and having a copy of Turbo-Pascal 4.0 that I
     had not used in a while, I decided to write a program a couple of
     years back to make submitting without fear a little easier.
     NEWS_CHECK is the result.  Since there have been a couple of
     changes to the submission requirements recently, I decided that
     NEWS_CHECK needed a face lift, and that copy of Turbo Pascal 5.5
     didn't look too busy...and NEWS_CHECK v1.6 was born.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 22                   5 Nov 1990


     NEWS_CHECK is intended for use by authors of articles for
     FidoNews, Klore, or any other compatible newsletters, for
     pre-submission verification of format.  Once you have your
     article written you just run NEWS_CHECK, give it the name of your
     file and it will check it for fatal errors as well as non-fatal
     "aesthetic" errors such as not being flushleft, having too many
     blank lines at the top of the file, etc.  It does not make any
     changes to your submission file; it just lists errors and
     suggestions to your screen.  It is possible to redirect the
     messages to a file for use as a reference while editing-in the
     corrections.  NEWS_CHECK will *not* check spelling or grammar!
     You want miracles you go talk to Borland.

     NEWS_CHECK looks for the following mistakes or ill-advised
     practices:

        1. Incorrect file name extension.  Must be ART, SAL, WAN, COL,
           LET, or NOT.  Any other extension is flagged as a FATAL
           error.

        2. Non-Flushleft margin.  Based on a percentage of the lines
           in the file, not all of them.  (I.E. If 50% of the lines in
           a file are not flushleft a WARNING is generated.)

        3. Right margin greater than 65 on any line generates a FATAL
           error.  If the line is over 65 characters long, but less
           than 70, and all characters after column 65 are spaces,
           then only a WARNING will be generated.  This is the only
           exception to the column 65 limit.  This exception is based
           on a comment made by a past FidoNews editor, and may not be
           valid anymore, so ignore this warning at your own peril!

        4. "funny characters".  Control chars (except CR-LF pairs)
           result in a FATAL error message. All characters must be in
           the range 20 hex (SPACE) to 7E hex (~).

        5. If the file is an ad or a notice (SAL, WAN, or NOT) a
           WARNING is generated if the total length of the submission
           is over 30 lines.

        6. Checks for existence of a "contents" line at the top of the
           file.  Outputs a WARNING if there isn't one.

        7. Checks for "dashed lines" at the beginning and end of the
           file.  Dashed lines  result in WARNING messages.  A "dashed
           line" is any line consisting of at least 4 of only one type
           of character (SPACE excepted).  "# # # #" counts as a
           "dashed line", for example.

        8. Checks for excessive "whitespace" at top and bottom of the
           file.  More than 3 blank lines at the front or end of the
     FidoNews 7-45                Page 23                   5 Nov 1990


           file generates a WARNING message.

        9. Checks for articles that are "too narrow" (have the right
           margin set to too low a value).  If over 50% of the lines
           in a submission don't reach at least column 55 a WARNING is
           generated.  There are times when narrowness is fine, but
           most articles should have the right margin at 65 for the
           best appearance after publication.


     NEWS_CHECK is designed so that it may be run from a BAT file, and
     it returns ERRORLEVEL codes to allow an automatic determination
     of what happened with the check.  An example of such a BAT file
     is included, as are several test files that contain errors of
     various kinds, and a (short) documentation file.

     The program is available for file request from 1:109/508, and
     possibly from other places by now, as NEWSCH16.ARC.  If you have
     any suggestions for improvement, or reports of problems, I would
     appreciate hearing about them, but I can't guarantee that I will
     fix or include all of them in future versions of the program
     (though I will try).  If you publish a FidoNews-like newsletter
     (or even FidoNews!), but prefer other parameters for things like
     margins, number of blank lines to allow, length of ads, etc.
     please let me know.  It is easy enough to generate a custom
     version with these things changed.  There is no charge for use of
     this software, and none will be permitted. If you really like the
     software a lot, then write a good article for FidoNews and
     NEWS_CHECK it before you send it in.

     By the way...NEWS_CHECK was written on an IBM PClone, using Turbo
     Pascal 4.0 and 5.5 from Borland International.  This would seem
     to indicate that those folks who can't run IBM PClone software
     under MS/PC-DOS are out of luck at the moment.  If someone is
     interested in porting NEWS_CHECK to a non-MS/PC-DOS
     machine/operating system, I will seriously consider releasing the
     source code to them, provided that the resulting software is made
     available to the public under terms substantially like those of
     NEWS_CHECK 1.6.

                        Thanks for the Encouragement
                               Steven Watsky

     Before I get to the point of this, I'd first like to say thanks
     to each of you who took the time to respond to my article on
     abortion. I was urged by the sysops of two Baton Rouge BSS's to
     allow the story to be sent up, and I agreed.

     The story you read was published in the Baton Rouge magazine Gris
     Gris. It was a gift to my friend, John Maginnis, the publisher of
     the magazine on the occasion of his debuting a new statewide
     political magazine.

     I get the feeling from the tone of some of the responses I've
     read that a few of you don't understand who I am, or what I did
     for a living since 1972.

     I was, until last month, a reporter. For the past four-and-a-half
     years I was employed by United Press International, the world's
     second-largest newsgathering organization. For those of you with
     a strong belief that the media is liberal and pro-choice, I'm
     very sorry. I oppose MOST abortions, with good reason, but that's
     not the point here. I have never been accused by any of UPI's
     estimated 50 million readers that my articles were one-sided or
     favored one position over another. In writing the story, I
     approached the issue in the only way I knew how -- it was a
     spectacle from Day One until the last night of the 1990 session.
     It was calculated to be spectacle, by both sides, to maximize
     media impact. If the story offended you, good. It should have.
     Such an emotional and philosophical issue belongs on a higher
     plane than retail politics at the state level.

     I was the president of the Capitol Correspondents Association
     this year, the organization that oversees the activities of
     reporters in the Louisiana State Capitol. In that capacity, I was
     liason for countless national print reporters and network crews
     that descended on Louisiana to watch the debate on banning
     abortion. I was asked by ABC's "Nightline" program to moderate a
     debate between two of the key players in the Louisiana abortion
     debate because I was recognized BY BOTH SIDES on the issue as
     being an unbiased and knowledgable source. I also was interviewed
     by National Public Radio's "Morning Edition," and was interviewed
     by CNN for a piece on how the Louisiana Legislature turned a bill
     dealing with beating up people who desecrate the flag into the
     "Crime of Simple Battery of Abortion."

     All that being said, let's get to the point. The abortion debate
     in Louisiana this year WAS a spectacle, not matched in this state
     since the bitters legislative arguments over right to work laws
     in the 1970s.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 26                   5 Nov 1990


     There's an old saying that there are two things you never want to
     see being made: sausage and politics. Truly, the abortion debate
     -- on both sides -- proved that statement 100 percent true.

     I have never seen behavior like I saw this year from the pro-life
     lobby. Yes, the article does pick on them more, but for a simple
     reason: they overran the State Capitol in such numbers that it
     was virtually impossible to move from one place to another, much
     less get any work done. The pro-choice lobby had its act together
     more than people realize; they simply sat back and let the
     pro-life forces destroy any chance they had of passing a
     restrictive abortion bill.

     The failing here, I think, has to do with the church's role in
     turning abortion into a political crusade. The problem with that
     approach is that once you threaten a legislator, vow to campaign
     against him in the next election, you've lost him for life. He'll
     never vote for any other piece of legislation you support.

     In mid-June, a very much pro-choice black lawmaker from Baton
     Rouge was called out of the House during important debate by an
     insistent citizen. This citizen proceeded to quote scripture to
     the legislator about why abortion is murder. The legislator
     patiently listened, thanked the citizen for the input, then
     returned to his seat on the House floor. Moments later, a second
     citizen called out the same legislator, who also quoted scripture
     to the lawmaker. He again patiently listened, thanked the person
     for the input, then returned to his seat. A third message came to
     him requesting he meet a citizen outside the chamber. This nice
     clean-cut young man threatened the lawmaker, then shouted,
     "Repent, you asshole!" before he was led away by state troopers.

     A couple of weeks after that shouting incident, a woman who owns
     several pro-life pregnancy shelters in Louisiana testified in
     committee on the bill to ban abortions. She assured the panel
     members she could place each child in a good home if the mother
     wished to give up the infant. Under Louisiana law, a person who
     spends some measure of time lobbying on behalf of a bill is
     banned from also possessing a press credential. The theory, as
     legislative aides say, is that a member of the media could exert
     undue influence on lawmakers by virtue of their position.

     Well, this woman at about the same time got hired by a Christian
     radio station to report on the abortion goings-on. She was
     granted a State Police media I.D. -- the credential we use at the
     Capitol to verify that a reporter really is a reporter and will
     be given special priveleges in covering all types of legislative
     hearings. This woman was warned she could no longer lobby the
     bill because she was now a reporter. She said she understood. She
     then walked into a Senate committee, signed a form saying she
     wanted to lobby on behalf of the abortion bill and sat in the
     area reserved for press.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 27                   5 Nov 1990


     The board of the Capitol Correspondents voted to immediately file
     a protest against her action. The chairman of the committee, Sen.
     Mike Cross -- a staunch foe of all abortions -- chewed the woman
     out for the breach of security and refused to let her testify on
     behalf of the bill.

     This woman promptly whined that her constitutional rights were
     being violated by the "devil-worshippers on press row." She
     continued to lobby behind the scenes, but at this point, we
     ignored her. By the way, we didn't ignore some of the female
     reporters who wore purple, the abortion-rights color -- during
     some of the debate. One was evicted from the chamber for the day
     on my orders.

     Our friend with the Christian radio station probably won't be
     back next year. On the second-to-last night of the 1990
     legislative session, she told several sergeants-at-arms in the
     House the 20 women with her wearing the "Abortion is Murder"
     stickers on their blouses were actually reporters and authorities
     had run out of press passes for them. I'm not real sure what this
     woman had in mind trying to get 20 of her friends down on the
     floor of the House of Representatives, but I can tell you that
     the action was a felony in Louisiana. But we ignored that too.
     Ironic, isn't it? A woman working for a Christian radio station
     who runs a string of pro-life shelters stoops to attempting to
     commit a felony to impress her friends, or perhaps to save the
     15,000 fetuses that are aborted in Louisiana each year.

     One of the key players in the anti-abortion movement was the
     Eagle Forum, the same group that year after year vehemently
     opposes sex education in schools. They also support the death
     penalty and give the impression that they would not want the
     state to spend one extra nickle to support the children not
     wanted by their mothers. Every effort to include language that
     would make the state responsible for the childrens' welfare was
     blocked by the anti-abortion forces in the Legislature.

     Politics is the art of pragmatism. It is knowing what you have to
     give up to get what you want. It is not a knee-jerk reaction to
     an emotional issue. This was lost on the anti-abortion forces who
     failed to understand how banning abortion would lead to an
     increased number of people on the welfare rolls and would cost the
     state countless thousands of dollars each year. Until they
     address those questions, they will not win in Louisiana.

     It is also important to know a bit about some of the people who
     supported the anti-abortion legislation. Many were NOT in any way
     shape or form in favor of such a ban. But, and this is sad to say
     with such an emotional issue, they were in it for the money or
     the votes. Reporters and Capitol workers snickered when some of
     those "pious" lawmakers rose in support of the bill, knowing
     those same lawmakers were chasing the 16-year-old legislative
     pages and had led, shall we say, a checkered life.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 28                   5 Nov 1990


     The lead author on the bill, Baton Rouge Rep. Woody Jenkins, sent
     a "questionnaire" out in August. It asked citizens across the
     state if they supported his abortion ban. It also asked them to
     send a donation -- apparently to retire Jenkins' campaign debt
     for a failed U.S. Senate bid six years ago. Nothing wrong with
     that, but the timing of the mailing was questionable.

     Jenkins, for his part, spent the better of 1990 telling every
     camera in sight that the majority of Louisiana citizens favored
     his outright ban. He told every anti-abortion rally -- and
     believe me, there were plenty -- that they were in the majority,
     not the liberal abortionists. What Jenkins forgot to tell his
     followers, and the cameras, is that the most recent survey on the
     subject that was taken after the high-profile session shows a
     whopping 6 percent of the people in Louisiana favor an outright
     ban.

     The sad lesson for a lot of lawmakers who got sucked in on the
     "everyone wants to ban abortions in Louisiana" ruse is that when
     they returned home after the legislative session, they were
     pounded by their constituents. While they were busy creating
     perfect soundbites for the national networks, the state began its
     fiscal year without a budget and left untouched numerous critical
     pieces of legislation that affect most of 4.1 million people in
     Louisiana.

     A year ago, ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke -- now a Louisiana
     state representative -- said he supported abortions for welfare
     mothers. Duke is a master at veiling racism in the cloak of
     conservatism, and this was no exception. Fast forward to this
     year: Duke now opposes all abortions.

     Nobody wants to say this in the media. I would not say this in
     the media, but I will say it to you, the people who have a head
     on their shoulders: a good deal of the anti-abortion debate in
     Louisiana is a thinly disguised racist ploy. It's the poor black
     women who are getting pregnant and feel they need the abortion.
     Many get pregnant because they do not understand birth-control
     methods -- methods the Eagle Forum opposes. As sentiments
     continue to shift away from trying to achieve equality for all
     races, more and more creative ways are found to cover racism with
     a veneer of "conservatism" or "Christian beliefs." The
     predominantly white Louisiana Legislature didn't see a problem
     with banning abortions because it would not affect a majority of
     their constituents.

     During one of the rallies on the steps of the State Capitol, a
     woman with an adoption agency from western Louisiana tried in
     vain to convince some of the 1,000 "Christians" in attendance to
     adopt some of the unwanted children she must take care of. No one
     signed up. It helps to know the children were black.

     D. Rice's response in the latest issue of FidoNews about school
     prayer points up another angle of what I'm trying to get across.
     About 5 years ago, I was watching Pat Robertson on the 700 Club.
     He was urging his viewers to call Washington and convince their
     congressmen to support a bill to prayer in school. Robertson was
     incensed by this. He wanted the United States Congress to adopt a
     policy of verbal prayer "because we don't want the Hare Krishnas
     saying their own prayers." That statement, like some made in the
     Louisiana abortion debate, seems to say that if you're in a
     majority religion you have the right to decide the morals and
     convictions of everyone. The framers of the U.S. Constitution
     must be rolling in their graves.

     As the editorial in FidoNews 7-43 pointed out, my article was NOT
     about abortion. It was about the lengths that lawmakers and
     special-interest groups will go to in order to achieve their
     goals. These "lengths" include many not-so-Christian ideas such
     as playing white lawmakers against black lawmakers, and
     threatening and successfully bottling up the state's $8 billion
     budget because the votes could not be found to override the
     governor's veto.

     The night the legislative session ended, I vowed never to cover
     the abortion issue again if I could help it. I was accused by
     both pro-life and pro-choice forces of caving in to the other's
     demands of equal treatment. I carried out that vow a month ago.

     I am now the public information officer for Louisiana Attorney
     General William Guste. You might be interested to know that Guste
     was one of the prime movers in the 1990 effort to ban abortions
     in Louisiana. You might also be interested to know that Guste,
     like many of us, learned a painful lesson this year: it is an
     issue that leaves no middle ground and leaves no one without
     physical and emotional scars. Guste, like the rest of the players
     in this little drama will be back next year, Fighting the Good
     Fight to ban abortion. But perhaps they'll use a different
     tactic.

     One can only hope...

                 New Echo "The Saudi Connection"

     Some History:

     Probably by now the majority of you have heard of a new echo
     called "The Saudi Connection." Basically it allows you, the
     sysop, to offer your callers a chance to send "letters" to
     American Service personnel in the Saudi Arabian theater of
     operations (Militarily known as Operation Desert Shield).

     About 4 weeks ago Mark Niswonger, Sysop of CrossRoads BBS in
     Manteca California started using his BBS to allow his students
     to send messages to service personnel in Saudi Arabia. He did
     this by uploading those messages in file format because his
     American contact in Saudi Arabia did not have a net-mail
     capable BBS. Neither did Mark.

     About 3 weeks ago Mark told me about his local success with
     this. He had received a grant from the local telephone company
     to help defray phone costs, and several local businesses also
     donated money to the operation. He was written up in several
     local newspapers, reported on by a couple of radio and TV
     stations, and in general the idea was catching on with his
     callers.

     Well, having no fear, I mentioned that this seemed like a very
     good thing, and that it was a shame that it was only limited
     to his own callers and school classes. I offered to be a
     "gateway" to his system from the net-compatible BBSes all over
     the country.

     From that day on "The Saudi Connection" echo was born and it
     has grown to more than 400 BBSes in about 3 weeks.


     To Join:

     Setup an echo with the tagname of SAUDI, make it for private
     mail only. Then make a bulletin announcing this service. Send
     netmail to 1:208/2 asking to poll for the SAUDI echo. Alter-
     nately you can Freq (Magic Name) SLIST from 208/2 and see a
     list of about 100 BBSes where you might want to set up a regu-
     lar polling schedule.

     Also, setup a sysop-only echo with tagname of SAUDI_INFO. This
     will allow you to keep up with the latest in "The Saudi Connect-
     ion" and to talk with other "Saudi Connection" sysops.

     That's all there is to it!

     You can help further by uploading this message or sending it to
     other BBSes you feel might be interested in this service.

     If there are any questions please do not hesitate to give me a
     call at:

                 269 or not 269? THAT is the Question.
                           by Kwityer Bychin


     Hi Ho, folks.  First  of  all,  before  I  start  this  week's
     tirade, I want to address a netmail I got this  week.  Because
     I've been starting my articles off with "Hi Ho,  folks",  some
     NITWIT sent me a netmail asking me if I knew KERMIT THE FROG .
     Now, I know of THAT OLD FROG, but I don't think he's the  same
     guy. Anyway, GET A LIFE, BONEHEAD...

     Last week, if you found a program that'll unpack  the  Snooze,
     you noticed that I beat up on ECHOPOL pretty good. Well,  boys
     & girls, it's gonna be TOUGH to top that one. But I'll give it
     the 'ol college try...

     Not content to beat the hell out of a  document  or  a  single
     person, I figured I'd take a stab and kicking  the  collective
     asses of an ENTIRE NET. Yeah! Why just  piss  of  one  person,
     when you can get FIFTY?

     Let me start by saying that I WANT some  of  WHATEVER  IT  IS,
     that the boys in 269 are snorting, smoking, injecting, or  are
     otherwise applying to an available  orifice.  In  Snooze  743,
     some joker named AL SAVERIANO  was  rambling  on  incoherently
     about his inability to get a bowl of soup in a Chinese laundry
     and the significance of EIGHT BIT WHEAT  TOAST  or  something.
     And  then,  in  744,  The  Infamous  MAHATMA  RAVSIK  actually
     RESPONDS to it, as if it had some SOCIAL SIGNIFICANCE  or  was
     even REMOTELY relative to ANYTHING TANGIBLE.

     Then, two unnamed Looney Toons in 269  write  ANOTHER  article
     comparing the Snooze to the NEW YORK TIMES.

     *I* wanna know WHAT ELSE your  NC  is  delivering  along  with
     your nodediffs.

     Not knowing who this SAVERIANO twit  is,  I  decided  to  look
     him up in the OFFICIAL FIDONET NODELIST [(c)1990  by  Everyone
     Except IFNA] . And lo and behold, I FOUND HIM! The host  entry
     for net 269 CLEARLY STATES "Saveriano is God"!! Did  YOU  know
     that?? I bet not! To HELL with the NEW YORK TIMES, we have the
     ALMIGHTY writing for the Snooze!

     Anyway, the  phone  number  on  the  host  entry  matches  the
     number on 269/101, so we gotta assume that the warden of  that
     asylum is a guy named GLEN JOHNSON. Well, his  NAME  might  be
     JOHNSON, but does he HAVE one? That's what I'D  like  to  know
     ...

     Hey JOHNSON, *WHAT* is the problem with the "people"  in  your
     net, man?

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 33                   5 Nov 1990


     Oh wait, let's look at  this  another  way.  Maybe  we  should
     feel SORRY for him. I mean, what if YOU were the  NC  of  some
     net, and you had guys writing for the Snooze  ANONYMOUSLY  and
     then putting their NAMES on the bottom  of  the  article,  had
     some crazy man writing articles about dipping his wheat  toast
     in a bowl of soup the waiter won't give him,  and  had  a  guy
     like MAHATMA RAVSIK, who will fight with ANYONE over ANYTHING,
     ANY TIME for ANY REASON, in your net, how would YOU feel?? Did
     GLEN'S JOHNSON *WANT* to be NC? Or was  he  SENTENCED  to  the
     job??

     I wanna tell all these lunkheads  to  KWITYER  BYCHIN,  but  I
     can't tell IF they're bitchin' about ANYTHING, and if so, WHAT
     they're bitchin' about. And WHO wrote MAHATMA RAVSIK's article
     for him? We all KNOW he can't even  spell  his  own  NAME,  so
     SOMEBODY musta wrote it FOR him.  Maybe  those  two  anonymous
     guys named Erik & Peter....

     I think we should  make  this  SAVERIANO  guy  the  next  ZONE
     COORDINATOR. Yeah,  good  idea.  That  way,  if  the  nodediff
     doesn't come out, you can write to him, ask  why,  and  get  a
     response like "Ah yes, the nodediff. I musta  SMOKED  it  with
     the WHEAT TOAST  at  MAHATMA  RAVSIK's  house  while  we  were
     stuffing THE JOHNSON in the NEW  YORK  TIMES"  .  Oh  wait,  I
     forgot, he's already GOD, so is ZC a promotion or what?  Maybe
     we'll make him IC.

     So I'm giving the NITWIT OF THE WEEK AWARD to NET  269.  These
     guys should stay off the keyboards and work  on  their  BASKET
     WEAVING.

            The StarGate Conference Distribution System -
                           What is it?

     As a service of sysops from FidoNet, AlterNet, Eggnet, and
     Phoenix/Net, a groupmail distribution system has been set up to
     facilitate the distribution of conferences.  For over 2 years,
     this series of systems, located strategically around the United
     States has been known as the STARGATE system.

     The STARGATES make available all Alliance conferences, and all
     the "backbone" conferences 'gated' from echomail, as GROUPMAIL.

     The STARGATE nodes are listed in the ANETLIST as 7/1xx numbers.
     All are 9600 baud, HSTs, PEPs, and even Hayes V96s.  There
     are systems in the Philadelphia area, Dallas, California,
     Michigan, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, St. Louis, Tennessee, Maryland,
     Bedminster PA, and of course, New Jersey, for your convenience.

     Sites currently in the planning stages include Atlanta & Chicago.
     We are particularly in need of a volunteer from Canada, and given
     the new "Reach Out World" program from AT&T, are confident that
     affordable arrangements can be made.

     Any nodes wishing to become STARGATEs are welcome to apply.
     They must be willing to fulfill the following requirements:

     1) Own a 9600 baud modem (all brands).
     2) Be willing to call NJ nitely for no more than 10 minutes
     3) Be running a continuous mailer capable of update file requests
     4) Be willing to make the conferences available to others.

     Once again, please let me reiterate that this system is available
     as a service to other sysop at no charge, though donations for
     the operation of the system are always welcome.

     For further information, contact 520/583@AlterNet,
     107/583@FidoNet, or 9220/583@EGGNet.

     Fidonet 1:269/309 aka /300

                      The State of the Universe?

     Anyone who knows Al Saveriano, and admits to it, is likely
     not in touch with a reality other people would feel
     comfortable with. As for Bob Moravsik, well, he is a lawyer,
     need I say more? The negative implications of admitting that
     I not only know these people, but network with them, should
     tell you something about myself, if not the universe at
     large. Ah yes, the universe.

     It is a little known fact, that if you do not rely upon a
     Chinese waiter to read Wonton backwards, and thereby deliver
     not_now the soup, but instead shift your fingers over one
     key space to the right and type instead 'epmypm', that you
     are guaranteed not only to receive no wonton soup, but cause
     the delivery of a strange picquante fish stew, known only in
     the northern provinces, instead.

     This, of course, has no bearing on the heretofore UNVERIFIED
     Moravsik Equation, wherein the relationship between the
     Game_Boy Scandal of '88 and arbitrary rhymes can be
     extrapolated via Mr. Moravsik's converse method. Not at all!
     By taking the sum of the ASCII values of 'IEC' (note: not
     'iec'), and applying it as a constant to the series before
     the sequential division by 11, 11/2, 11/4, and 11/8, one may
     in fact add a dynamic aspect to the formula, and partially
     negate the otherwise static nature of the data. This, by no
     means will validate any significant properties. REVERSED
     order is significant when and only when this dynamic
     inference is true, and verified by Johnson's Law of Imputed
     Formation, "All causal imputations are inferential." Let me
     repeat with emphasis, ALL causal imputations ARE inferential.
     I don't see how it can be made any clearer than that.

     I also take umbrage with Mr Moravsik's mention of 'True
     Topology' and feel that this is not a fitting subject for
     this forum. I don't feel that this issue should indeed be an
     issue, as it issued from Mr. Moravsik in the last issue of
     this publication. I am sure there are more than a few who
     will agree with me in these various respects.

     Pablo Kleinman (4:900/101)
     Latin American FidoNet Coordinator
     Coordinator of the WorldPol Project

     Quote of the Day:

     "The time has come"
     -- Midnight Oil, Australian rock band


         An International Policy for an International FidoNet

     FidoNet has grown as large as probably nobody ever imagined.
     Today, it comprises a number of around eight thousand nodes all
     over the world.

     The current FidoNet Policy document, commonly known as Policy4,
     was written mainly by the North American Region Coordinators and
     replaced Policy3 a year and a half ago without the consent of the
     sysops in FidoNet, but just of a majority of the same
     coordinators.

     If we take a comprehensive look at the nodelist, we shall notice
     the enormous variety of different countries listed on it. For
     those of you still not familiar with them, here they are as of
     November 1st, 1990 (in alphabetical order): Argentina,
     Australia, Austria, Belgium, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada,
     Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,
     Great Britain, Greece, Holland, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan,
     Kenya, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Papua-New Guinea,
     Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa,
     Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, United States,
     Venezuela, and Zimbabwe (I hope I'm still not missing anything).

     All these countries have different governments and laws, they
     have different economies and telecommunication systems; and
     something as important: customs are different in the different
     countries.

     The current policy document, maybe ideal for North America,
     represents a problem for nodes in other parts of the world such
     as Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Some current Policy
     requirements are _useless_ or _unenforceable_ in many regions,
     and some other needed procedures are not addressed by Policy4.

     FidoNet, being an international organization, must adopt a
     federal form of administration and regulation. It is the only
     way to guarantee that each Zone, Region and Network will be able
     to operate the best way possible.

     Another issue addressed during the last year by the members of
     FidoNet is "democracy": Policy4 rejects democratic election
     means for coordinators, and rather establishes a mechanism that
     does not let the average sysop the right to vote, installing a
     system of "rotation of the elite" where coordinators are elected
     by coordinators. Practice has shown not only that democracy is
     FidoNews 7-45                Page 38                   5 Nov 1990


     possible, but that it benefits the network, and this should be
     reflected by policy.

     And finally, there is an alternative: product of more than a
     year of work by a group of sysops of different parts of the
     world (it was a project open to everyone that wished to
     participate): a new policy proposal for FidoNet, known as the
     FidoNet Worldwide  Policy Proposal or WorldPol, was written.

     The Worldwide Policy Proposal (version 1g), implements a
     decentralized administration, and proposes a total
     democratization of the entire network, letting every Zone
     establish its own election methods according to what is
     customary in each of them.

     WorldPol will make possible a goal long overdue: the smooth
     operation of FidoNet, worldwide.

     Unfortunately, the current Policy document does not allow every
     sysop to decide, and only the Network, Region and Zone
     coordinators are entitled to vote. But to change this, you
     should make your voice be heard, and tell your coordinators,
     your representative, to vote to adopt WorldPol!

     For all of us that want FidoNet to change for better, we finally
     have a good chance to make it happen.

     Here is a copy of the letter sent to the International
     Coordinator of FidoNet, Matt Whelan, requesting the vote to
     decide over WorldPol's future:

     Buenos Aires, November 3, 1990

     Message to:
     Matt Whelan, FidoNet International Coordinator

     Dear Matt,

     This message is to request you to convoke for a net-wide vote to
     decide whether the proposal known as "FidoNet Worldwide Policy"
     or "WorldPol", version 1g, will replace the current Policy4,
     according to the procedures described in chapter 8, sections
     8.1 through 8.6 of the current Policy document.

     We expect the vote to be announced the soonest possible.
     Our suggestion is that the vote begins on November 15th and
     that the deadline to vote is set for December 15th, 1990,
     before the Christmas season begins.

     We hope that a vote-receiving site is set-up in every zone,
     and that a reliable procedure, to guarantee that each vote is
     computed correctly, is used for the election.

     1 FidoNet

       This document installs an international (inter-zonal) policy
     for sysops who are members of the FidoNet organization of
     bulletin board systems worldwide.  FidoNet is defined by a list
     of nodes (NodeList) issued on a weekly basis by each of the Zone
     Coordinators, on behalf of the International Coordinator.

       Each FidoNet Zone is entitled to issue its own policy
     document, according to its own needs and customs.  This
     International Policy, determines general rules which must be
     specified -and may not be contradicted- by the Zone Policies.

       Regions and local Networks may also issue their own policies,
     provided such policies do not contradict this International
     Policy or the respective Zone's policy.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 40                   5 Nov 1990


     1.1 Overview

       FidoNet is an amateur electronic mail system.
     As such, all of its participants and operators are unpaid
     volunteers. From its nearly beginning in 1984, as a few friends
     swapping messages back and forth mainly in North America, it
     consists now of an International community of more than seven
     thousand systems all over the world.

       FidoNet is not a common carrier or a value-added service
     network and is a public network only as much as the independent,
     constituent nodes may individually provide public access to the
     network on their system.

       FidoNet exists to provide electronic mail services to its
     member sysops.
     To efficiently provide such services, various structure and
     control mechanisms are essential. The structure is organized into
     multiple nets, with decentralized administration.

       This document delineates all of the procedures at the
     international level of FidoNet, as well as some general rules for
     the lower levels (intra-zonal), developed to manage the network.
     Authorities in the international level not defined by this
     document, shall be defined by the Zone Coordinators Council and
     the International Coordinator.


     2 Language

       Each zone has the right to determine its own official language.

       At the international (inter-zonal) level, for practical
     purposes, FidoNet adopts English as its official language. All
     the FidoNet documents issued at the international level must
     exist in English. Translation into other languages is encouraged.


     3 Access to FidoNet

       FidoNet membership is open to everybody that fulfills the
     technical standards described in paragraph 5.9. Lower-level
     policies may issue additional restrictions only if particularly
     authorized by the Zone Coordinator Council.


     4 Organization

       The organizational structure of FidoNet, has been developed to
     distribute the administration and control of FidoNet, to the
     lowest possible level, while still allowing for coordinated
     action over the entire system.
     FidoNews 7-45                Page 41                   5 Nov 1990


       Effective administration is made viable by operating in a
     top-down manner.
       This means, that a person at any given level is responsible to
     the level above, and responsible for administrating the level
     below.

       If a person at any level above sysop is unable to properly
     perform their duties, the person at the next level may replace
     them.  For example, if a Region Coordinator fails to perform, the
     Zone Coordinator may cause the Coordinator to be replaced.
     Coordinators may also be removed by a majority vote of the level
     below. For example, if network Coordinators in a region lose
     faith in the ability of a Region Coordinator to effectively
     perform, they may vote to have a new Coordinator elected.


     4.1 International Coordinator

       The International Coordinator (IC) is the Executive Officer of
     FidoNet and coordinates the joint production of the master
     nodelist by the Zone Coordinators. The International Coordinator
     is responsible for creating new zones in FidoNet, but can only do
     so with the approval of the Zone Coordinator Council.

       The International Coordinator is selected by unanimous vote of
     the Zone Coordinators, and removed by a majority vote of the Zone
     Coordinators.


     4.2 Zone Coordinator Council

       The Zone Coordinator Council (ZCC) consists of the Zone
     Coordinators -each having a single ballot- and the International
     Coordinator. In the event of a ZCC vote tie, the International
     Coordinator may cast an additional vote to untie the election.

       The Zone Coordinator Council is the legislative body of
     FidoNet, it represents each of the zones in FidoNet. It is the
     highest authority of the network's Top-Down organization.


     4.3 Zones and Zone Coordinators

       A zone is a geographic area containing one or many regions,
     covering one or more countries.

       The Zone Coordinator is the Executive Officer of the Zone, and
     the zone's representative to the other zones.

       The Zone Coordinator compiles the nodelists from all of the
     regions in the zone, creates a master nodelist and a difference
     file, which is then distributed over FidoNet within the zone. A
     Zone Coordinator does not perform message-forwarding services for
     any nodes in the zone, whereas the Zone Coordinator is
     responsible for the formation and/or administration of one or
     more zone-gates to provide interzone mail facilities.
     FidoNews 7-45                Page 42                   5 Nov 1990


       The method used for selection of Zone coordinators is left to
     the  discretion of the relevant Zone Policy.  In the absence of a
     Zone Policy selection method, Zone Coordinators are elected and
     removed by a majority vote of the Region Coordinators in the
     Zone.


     4.4 Regions and Region Coordinators

       A Region is a well-defined geographic area containing nodes
     which may or may not be combined into networks. A typical Region
     will contain many nodes in networks, and a few independent nodes
     which are not part of the network.

       The Region Coordinator maintains the list of independent nodes
     in the region, and accepts nodelists from the Network
     Coordinators in the Region.
     These are compiled to create a regional nodelist, which is sent
     to the Zone Coordinator. A Region Coordinator is encouraged to
     perform message-forwarding services for nodes within the region,
     but is not forced to, unless the appropriate Zone or Region
     policy imposes such a requirement.

       The method used for selection of Regional coordinators is left
     to the discretion of the relevant Zone or Region Policy.  In the
     absence of such a policy selection method, Region Coordinators
     are elected and removed by a majority vote of the NCs in the
     Region.


     4.5 Networks and Network Coordinators

       A network is a group of nodes, normally but not exclusively in
     a local geographic area. Networks coordinate their mail activity
     to decrease cost.

       The Network Coordinator is responsible for maintaining the list
     of nodes for the network, and for forwarding netmail sent to
     members of the network from other FidoNet nodes. The Network
     Coordinator may make arrangements to handle outgoing netmail, but
     is not required to do so, unless the appropriate Zone, Region or
     Net policy imposes such a requirement.

       The method used for selection of Network coordinators is left
     to the discretion of the relevant Zone/Region/Net Policy.  In the
     absence of such a policy selection method, Network Coordinators
     are elected and removed by a majority vote of the Nodes in the
     Network.


     4.5.1  Network Routing Hubs

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 43                   5 Nov 1990


       Network Routing Hubs exist only in some networks. They may be
     appointed by the Network Coordinator, in order to assist the
     management (especially routing tasks) of the network.


     4.6 Individual systems (Nodes)

       The smallest subdivision of FidoNet is the individual system,
     corresponding to a single entry in the nodelist. The system
     operator (SysOp) formulates a policy for running the board and
     dealing with the users. The sysop must mesh with the rest of the
     FidoNet system to receive and send mail, and the local policy
     must be consistent with other levels of FidoNet.


     4.6.1 Users of an individual system

       The sysop is responsible for the actions of any user when they
     affect the rest of FidoNet (i.e. if the user is annoying, the
     sysop is annoying). The users have no rights under this policy
     document.


     4.6.2 Points

       A point is a system that is not in the nodelist, but
     communicates with FidoNet through a node defined to as bossnode.
     A point is generally regarded in the same manner as a user and,
     for example, the bossnode is responsible for mail from the point.
     Points are addressed using the bossnode's nodelist address; for
     example, a point system with a bossnode of 125/111 might be known
     as 125/111.6. Mail sent to the point will be sent to the
     bossnode, which then routes it to the point.

       Point operators are not FidoNet members, they are only users of
     a FidoNet node, as any other regular user; they have no rights
     under this policy document.


     5 General Procedures for All Coordinators

     5.1 Making Available Difference Files and Nodelist

       Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining and making
     available for file request and download by users, on a weekly
     basis, nodelist difference files and complete nodelists.


     5.2 Processing Nodelist Changes and Passing Them Upstream

       Each Coordinator is responsible for obtaining nodelist
     information from the level below, processing it, and passing the
     results to the level above.
     The timing of this process is determined by the requirements
     imposed by the level above.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 44                   5 Nov 1990


     5.3 Ensure the Latest Policy is Available

       A Coordinator is responsible to make the current version of the
     International Policy available to the level below, and to
     encourage familiarity with it.


     5.4 Minimize the Number of Hats Worn

       Coordinators are encouraged to limit the number of
     FidoNet-related Coordinator functions they perform. A Coordinator
     who holds two different positions, compromises the appeal
     process. For example, is the Network Coordinator is also the
     Region Coordinator, sysops in that network are denied one level
     of appeal.

       Multiple hats are also discouraged due to the difficulty of
     replacing services when a coordinator leaves the net.

     5.5 Be a Member of the Area Administered

       A Coordinator must be a member of the area administered. This
     is, a Network Coordinator must be a member of the network he is
     to coordinate.
     A Region Coordinator must be either a member of a network in the
     region, or an independent in a region.


     5.6 Encourage New Sysops to Enter FidoNet

       A Coordinator is encouraged to operate a public bulletin board
     system which is freely available for the purpose of distributing
     Policy and Nodelists to potential new sysops. Dissemination of
     this information to persons who are potential FidoNet sysops is
     important to the growth of FidoNet, and Coordinators should
     encourage development of new systems.


     5.7 Tradition and Precedent

       A Coordinator is not bound by the practices of predecessor.
     However, it must be clear that Coordinators are bound by all
     requirements of this document, both as FidoNet sysops and as
     Coordinators. The holding of a Coordinator title does not grant
     license to annoy others or to flaunt policy.


     5.8 Technical Management

       The primary responsibility of any Coordinator is technical
     management of network operations. Decisions MUST be made only
     on technical grounds. A Coordinator has the responsibility to act
     as objectively as possible; objectivity must be considered an
     essential factor when making a decision.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 45                   5 Nov 1990


     5.9 Exclusivity of Zone Mail Hour

       Zone Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when network
     mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a
     part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail during this time
     using the protocol defined in the current FidoNet Technical
     Standards Committee publication (FTS-0001 at this writing).  It
     is permissible to have greater capability (for example, to
     support additional protocols or extended mail hours), but the
     minimum requirement is FTS-0001 capability during this one hour
     of the day.

       This time is exclusively reserved for netmail.  Many phone
     systems charge on a per-call basis, regardless of whether a
     connect, no connect, or busy signal is encountered.  For this
     reason, any activity other than normal network mail processing
     that ties up a system during ZMH is considered annoying behavior.
       User (BBS) access to a system is prohibited during ZMH.

       Zone Mail Hour will be defined by each Zone Policy. In the
     absence of a Zone Policy, it will be defined by the Zone
     Coordinator.


     6 Election and Referendum Procedures

       Any election or referendum at any level of FidoNet, must be
     democratic by western standards.
       Each zone will issue its own election procedures, which must be
     approved by the Zone Coordinator Council before implementation.

       If a worldwide election, with the participation of all zones,
     is to be held, the Zone Coordinator Council will determine the
     election procedures.


     7 Policy Referenda

     7.1 International Policy

       A referendum on International Policy modification is invoked by
     the International Coordinator at the direction of a majority of
     the Zone Coordinators, or a majority of the Region Coordinators
     of all zones, a majority of the Network Coordinators of all
     zones, or by one third of all the sysops in all zones.

       All the members of FidoNet are entitled to vote on an
     International Policy referendum, which is to be held according to
     the procedures described by the Zone Coordinator Council before
     the election is called.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 46                   5 Nov 1990


     7.2 Zone Policy

       A referendum on Zone Policy modification is invoked by the Zone
     Coordinator, by a majority vote of the Region Coordinators in the
     zone, by a majority vote of the Network Coordinators in the
     zone, or by one third of all the sysops in the zone.

       All the members of the zone are entitled to vote on a Zone
     Policy referendum, which is to be held according to the
     procedures described on the Zone Policy. If such document does
     not exist, the procedures will be determined by the Zone
     Coordinator with the approval of the Zone Coordinator Council.

       The formulation of Region and Network Policy documents is
     encouraged, and must be regulated by the Zone Policy documents in
     each zone.


     7.3 Transition to a 'Worldwide Policy environment'

       After the approval of this Worldwide Policy, the previously
     existing policy will still be in effect for the Zone level until
     the approval of a new Zone policy, according to the methods
     provided in this document.

       All the procedures introduced by this Worldwide Policy document
     adjourn the procedures existing in the previous policy document.


     8 Resolution of Disputes

       The FidoNet judicial philosophy can be summed up in two rules:

            1) Thou shalt not excessively annoy others.

            2) Thou shalt not become excessively annoyed.

       The parties involved in a dispute are encouraged to solve their
     problems directly, without the intervention of a Coordinator.


     8.1 Mediation Requests

       Any of the parties involved may request the intervention of the
     respective Coordinator: Network Coordinator if a dispute between
     members of the same network, Region Coordinator if a dispute
     between members of different networks on the same region; Zone
     Coordinator if a dispute between members of different regions on
     the same zone; International Coordinator if a dispute between
     members of different zones.

     FidoNews 7-45                Page 47                   5 Nov 1990


       The Coordinator requested as "mediator", will ask each party to
     provide all the information before two weeks from the request and
     will make a decision within forty-five days after he received all
     the information from the involved parties.

       A Coordinator, unable to resolve a dispute, may name a third
     party to act as "mediator", provided the parties involved in the
     dispute agree.

     8.2 Appealing to a Mediator's Decision

       A mediator's decision may be appealed to the immediately
     superior level if considered unfair: Region Coordinators handle
     appeals from decisions made by Network Coordinators;  Zone
     Coordinators handle appeals from decision made by Region
     Coordinators; The International Coordinator handles appeals from
     decisions made by the Zone Coordinators; and the Zone Coordinator
     Council will handle appeals from decisions made by the
     International Coordinator,  being the Zone Coordinator Council's
     resolutions, unappealable.

       For appealing to a decision made by a third person named by a
     Coordinator to act as mediator, it will be as if the Coordinator
     made the resolution and the previously enumerated sequence of
     appealing will be appropriate.

       For appealing to a decision made by a mediator, the same terms
     and procedures as for any Mediation Request apply.


     8.3 Statute of Limitations

       A mediation request may not be filed more than 60 days after
     the date of discovery of the source of the infraction, either by
     admission or technical discovery of the source of an infraction,
     either by admission or technical evidence. Mediation requests may
     not be filed more than 120 days after the incident, unless they
     involve suspected unlawful behavior, in which the legal statute
     of limitations of the country involved shall apply.


     8.4 Echomail

       Each FidoNet Zone is encouraged to establish it's Zone Policy
     concerning the manner of handling Echomail and the resolution of
     disputes arising from such distribution.

       No sysop may be required to carry an echomail conference as a
     condition of joining or remaining in FidoNet.

     A View from the Bridge

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9011.4..."
     by The Captain, 1:107/583@FidoNet 520/583@AlterNet 9:807/1@PNet

     Let's talk ECHOPOL.  I like the idea of an Echo policy.  I even
     like most of the current one that's been placed in effect
     unilaterally by the *C structure.  There are a few points I don't
     like, some that don't make sense, yet all are certainly
     correctible.  I, and others, have pointed them out in conferences
     like MODS_N_CS, MODERATORS, SYSOP, and others.  I know that
     George Peace has heard what has been said, because he's responded
     in a very nice way.  George seems to me to be an individual who
     wants to do good in a no-win situation.  He has the unfortunate
     habit of sometimes saying what appear to be different things to
     different people, but few of us are gifted with the oratory
     skills of a William Jennings Bryan.  God knows I'm not.

     But in last week's FidoNews editorial, the editor of the day said:

       George says that's one of the areas he wants to see fixed. Good.
       It's one of the areas that most concerns me. But who is handling
       this fixing (or is it FICTHing)?  Where are the "we need to look
       at this problem with EchoPol" postings? This discussion has thus
       far consisted of a soliloquy by George. And random noise from a
       few people who prefer to bash George's brownshirt tactics rather
       than devoting time to trying to set things straight. Another
       FICTH is brewing. I can detect the stench from here.

     He then says:

       Wake up and smell the coffee. And stop looking at the world
       through sh*t-colored glasses.

     It seems to me that the FidoNews editorial staff (whomever it is
     this week)  needs to wake up and smell the coffee.  The very
     discussion he's griping about is going on, unless he's
     deliberately insulting us by calling our comments "brownshirt
     tactics", which I unequivocably reject. Sure, a lot of people
     objected to the way Echopol was turned on. I personally warned
     George ahead of time (in public) that the method used was going
     to draw attention away from the document. It looks like I was
     right, but still we seem to be getting somewhere.  I guess the
     FidoNews editors just haven't seen it.  That's too bad.  But that
     doesn't mean it doesn't exist, either.

     Incidentally, to those who didn't like the way EchoPol was put
     into effect: "Welcome to post-IFNA FidoNet."  Guess you shoulda
     voted "YES", huh?  Don't say I didn't warn you...
