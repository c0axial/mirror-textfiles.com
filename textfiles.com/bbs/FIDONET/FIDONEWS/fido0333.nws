                              Model 1000 Echo

             Due to the differences between the Model 1000 from Tandy
     and the normal IBM type of machine, I have asked several nodes
     if they were interested in the establishment of a Model 1000
     echo area. So far of the six nodes that I thought might be
     interested, two answered yes right away. One is here in net 138,
     the other is on the East coast. What we have in mind is a free
     area where all can enter the questions and whoever can answer,
     answers. We will be using arcmail for the message transfers and
     will try to keep the traffic out the normal outbound/inbound
     channels. If interested, set up an echo mail area for MOD1000
     and send me a message from it to 138/14.

                                SMART Echo

             A second echo that we have here is for users of the
     SMART Package from Inovative Software. Right now it is a local
     echo but will add others if they will send echomail to me under
     the name of SMART also at 138/14

                               The Condemned


     When the earth was created, the powers above,
     Gave each man a job to work at and love.
     He made Doctors and lawyers and plumbers and then,
     He made carpenters, singers, and confidence men.
     And when each had a job to work as he should,
     He looked them all over and saw it was good.

     He then sat down to rest for a day,
     When a horrible groan chanced to come his way.
     The Lord then looked down and his eyes opened wide,
     For a motley collection of bums stood outside.
     "Oh what can they want?" the creator asked them,
     "Help us," they cried out, "A job for us men".
     "We have no profession," they cried in dismay,
     "And even the jails have turned us away".
     Said the Lord, "I've seen many things without worth,
     But here I find gathered the scum of the earth!"

     The Lord was perplexed then he was mad,
     For all the jobs, there was none to be had.
     Then he spoke aloud in a deep angry tone,
     "Forever and ever ye mongrels shall roam,
     Ye shall freeze in the summer and sweat when it's cold,
     Ye shall work on equipment that's dirty and old,
     Ye shall crawl under raised floors, and there cables lay,
     Ye shall be called out at midnight and work through the day,
     Ye shall work on all holidays, and not make your worth,
     Ye shall be blamed for all downtime that occurs on the earth,
     Ye shall watch all the glory go to software and sales,
     Ye shall be blamed by them both if the system then fails.
     Ye shall be paid nothing out of sorrow and tears,
     Ye shall be forever cursed, and called FIELD ENGINEERS!"

     Letter to Editor
     Infoworld

     Suite C-200
     Menlo Park, California 94025
     CIS 73267,1537

     Dear Editor,

          I read Scott Mace's 8/18/86 'Software Makers Force Pirate
     BBS to Shut Down' regarding a Cincinnati area electronic bulletin
     board carrying 'pirate' software.  It was mentioned in the story
     that this was a 'Fidonet-based board'.

          Having just returned from an International Fido Sysop
     Conference with about 100 Fido Sysop's from the United States,
     Canada, Great Britain and Holland held in Colorado Springs; and
     being the Cincinnati area Fidonet administrator, I was a bit
     disturbed to hear this news.

          I thought I would take this opportunity to try and put the
     Fido name back in its more respectable light, since I now have
     made a few phone calls to check out this story.

          Fido is the name of an electronic bulletin board system
     written by Tom Jennings.  Fido Net is the informal cooperation by
     which over 1,000 Fido systems on 4 continents exchange electronic
     mail with each other every day.  These systems are run entirely
     independently by people that have no business relation with each
     other.

          Since we take this activity rather seriously, we do our best
     to maintain the highest possible standards for the systems and
     people that participate in our network.  'Pirate' boards that
     participate in the spreading of commercial software against the
     copyright restrictions are a definite NO-NO in the Fido Net
     world.  Of course there can always be the one bad apple (no pun
     intended) and it is unfortunate that in this case it blemished
     the Fido Net name.  Coincidentally, in researching your story
     further, I found that the particular Cincinnati area offender
     that you wrote of was not at all a Fido Net based system.
     However, he might have been, so I really can't take credit for
     the fact that he actually was running some bbs software other
     than the Fido software.

          Anyway, as I said, there are over 1,000 Fido Net systems and
     they are spread all over the WORLD.  I can assure you that these
     sysops, that generally go unmentioned, collectively outweigh this
     one joker's bad news with their own good news to the order of a
     giga times better.

          Thank you for letting me use this forum to hopefully help
     the Fido Net image.  If there is any further information that I
     can provide, please feel free to call on me.

              Are You Being Ripped Off When You Buy Diskettes?
                                Mike Guffey

     Almost everyone shops for the best buys in  5.25"  floppy  disks.
     Prices range from under $1 to over $5 per disk,  depending on the
     brand and type (SSDD, DSDD,  DSQD).  It is possible to get around
     one  of  the  big-gest  "fictions"  in computing by buying Single
     Sided Disks for most applications.  Crucial  to  this  method  is
     acquistion  of  a  magnetic  bulk eraser which is used to totally
     blank the disks before formatting.

     Few computer store people or mail order houses will tell you that
     the main (but not  necessarily  the  =only=)  difference  between
     single  and  double sided disks is that DS disks are certified on
     both sides.  All "name-brand" manufacturers' disks have  magnetic
     particles  on  both  sides.  Single-sided  disks  have  only been
     tested on one  side.  And  99%  of  single  sided  disks  can  be
     formatted for DS Double Density and, in most cases, will work for
     DS  QUAD  density  formats.  The  "trick"  is  to  first  use the
     magnetic bulk  eraser  on  each  disk,  format  it,  then  run  a
     commercial  or public domain program to look for and lock out bad
     sectors.  Single sided disks  will  not  always  work  for  "OCT"
     Density applications (i.e.  IBM AT),  but if they have never been
     used in any lesser format,  many premium  brands  are  likely  to
     work.

     Off-brand disks?  Yes,  they may be a bargain,  but they may also
     fail to retain data in storage.  Stay with "name-brands" for this
     trick.

     We are looking for Fire Departments currently using Computer
     Aided Dispatch programs on any type of computer system.

     If your Department is using a CAD system, we would like to hear
     from you about the screen design, the types of data stored and
     retrieved, access times, user interface, computer utilized,
     program language, portability and ease of program alteration,
     and maintenance and reliability factors. We would also like to
     obtain screen print-outs and any other documentation you are
     willing to share.

     This Department is in the process of purchasing a VAX system and
     attendant peripherals and is thinking of developing a CAD system
     in "C". We don't want to reinvent anything, if it can be avoided.

     If you have or have access to any of the above material, send a
     FidoNet message to:
                            Christopher Baker

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 550+ "ARC"  archives  -  20+  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 28 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...  Over
     55 DS/DD diskettes!!

     This collection is the result of more than 15 months of intensive
     downloads  from  just  about 150 or more BBS's and other sources,
     all of which have been examined,  indexed and archived  for  your
     convenience.  Starting  a  Bulletin Board System?  Want to add on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To order the library,  send  $100  (personal  or  company  check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No  profit  is  made  from  the  sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is  applied  entirely  to
     the  cost  of  downloading  the  software  over  the phone lines,
     running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and  inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software yourself through the use of  a  computer  with  a  modem
     using  commercial phone access would cost you much more than what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:
           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
           - Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
           - DSBackup
           - Fastback
           - ACS INTRCPT 720k format
           - Plain  ol' files (add $50)

     Add $30 if you want  the  library  on  1.2  meg  AT  disks  (more
     expensive  disks).  There  are  no  shipping or handling charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     Announcing the return of the "HIP Shack" to Fidonet, now in
     Colorado Springs, CO.  The files and message areas are in
     the process of being reorganized, but Amateur Radio and SWL
     are still the primary themes.  I'm looking forward to
     hearing from everyone I've been out of touch with for the
     last 9 weeks...
