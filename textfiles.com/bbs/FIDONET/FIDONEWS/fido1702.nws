                             Every Thousand Years
                                  Doug Myers

     Ironically, the Newsletter of the Fidonet Community is being brought
     to you this week by the person most out of touch with the rest of
     Fidonet.  A combination of personal illness and Y2K software
     failures have left my system in sad shape - still running but with
     many bugs still to correct.  Moreover, Net 270 needed to establish
     another path for netmail and echomail when George Peace left Fidonet
     at the millenium rollover.  These connections were working at first,
     but for some reason stopped.  Even now, we're receiving echomail
     sporadically, and I'm not sure of the status of netmail routing.

     Gawd!  I hope we don't have to go through this every thousand years!

     Rather than carp about the failures, though, I'd like to take an
     editorial opportunity to thank the people who are moving mail for
     Fidonet.  I've criticized them in the past for the petty quarrels
     and senseless power plays... but it seems that they are holding Fido
     together right now.  At least I've gotten my share of advice, offers
     for help, netmails, even phone calls... letting me know that Fidonet
     is still pulling together into the next thousand or so years.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.

      ROCKET SCIENTIST PEEKS INTO THE PHYSICS OF PROPELLANTS
                   Ol'WDB visits NASA's JPL Lab site for you.

      While the term "rocket scientist" gets tossed around rather loosely
      these days, Dr. Josette Bellan, a senior research scientist at
      NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, is the genuine article, spending
     FIDONEWS 18-02               Page 6                   10 Jan 2000


      much of her time pondering the mysteries of propellants at high
      pressures and temperatures.

      Dr. Bellan is currently leading research to help better understand
      the intricacies of high-pressure fluid behavior, which could help
      in the eventual use of powerful computers to simulate what goes on
      in combustion chambers.  That could result in significant cost
      savings over the current rocket design standard, which is primarily
      based on hardware testing.

      Dr. Bellan and one of her associates, JPL's Dr. Kenneth Harstad,
      are about to publish a paper in the International Journal of
      Multiphase Flow that may provide researchers with key elements
      needed to unlock the mystery of high-pressure fluid behavior.

      The work, titled "An All-Pressure Fluid Drop Model Applied To a
      Binary Mixture: Heptane in Nitrogen," due to be published this
      spring, documents the accuracy of their model of a single
      hydrocarbon droplet in a high-pressure environment, emulating the
      conditions that propellants endure in combustion chambers.  It also
      pinpoints differences between low- and high-pressure fluid
      behavior.

      The model highlights the importance of a previously neglected
      quantity, the "thermal diffusion factor," describing how a highly
      localized change in temperature within a mixture of fluids can give
      rise to a flow of one ingredient in that mixture compared to the
      rest of the ingredients. Conversely, this factor describes how
      local changes in ingredients can give rise to local changes in
      temperature.

      While typically  playing no role at ordinary atmospheric pressure,
      the thermal diffusion factor becomes important at high pressures.

      "Because this factor is usually unimportant, quantifying it has not
      been a high priority in the past," said Bellan, who holds a Ph.D.
      in aerospace and mechanical sciences  from Princeton University and
      now conducts research in JPL's Thermal and Propulsion Engineering
      Systems section. Reared in France, she earned a master of science
      in applied mathematics from the University of Sciences in Paris.

      "Our research shows that if we want to understand propellant
      behavior under high pressure, knowing this factor is in fact very
      important," she adds.

      She points out that this model brings scientists a step closer to
      creating realistic computer simulations of rocket, jet and diesel
      engine combustion chambers. Long-term benefits will likely include
      cost savings and greater design accuracy.

      Those simulations may well lead to new estimates of the ideal size
      of combustion chambers, because those simulations will now include
      the thermal diffusion factor, whose importance has been proven by
      this model.

      This research has been supported by the Advanced Subsonic

                                    Ol'WDB

      A man walks into a Silicon Valley pet store looking to buy a
      monkey.

      The store owner points towards three identical looking monkeys in
      politically-correct, animal-friendly natural mini-habitats.

      "The one on the left costs $500," says the store owner.

      "Why so much?" asks the customer.

      "Because it can program in C," answers the store owner.

      The customer inquires about the next monkey and is told, "That one
      costs $1500. It knows Visual C++ and Object-Relational technology."

      The startled man then asks about the third monkey. "That one costs
      $3000," answers the store owner.

      "3000 dollars!!" exclaims the man. "What can that one do?"

      To which the owner replies, "To be honest, I've never seen it do a
      single thing, but it calls itself a Consultant."

       A sister and brother are talking to each other when the little boy
       gets up and walks over to his Grandpa and says, "Grandpa, please
       make a frog noise."

       The Grandpa says, "No."

       The little boy goes on, "Please...please make a frog noise."

       The Grandpa says, "No, now go play."

       The little boy then says to his sister, "Go tell Grandpa to make a
       frog noise." So the little girl goes to her Grandpa and says,
       "Please make a frog noise."

       The Grandpa says, "I just told your brother no and I'm telling you
       no."

       The little girl says, "Please...please Grandpa make a frog noise."

       The Grandpa says, "Why do you want me to make a frog noise?"

       The little girl replied, "Because mommy said when you croak we can
       go to Disney World!"
