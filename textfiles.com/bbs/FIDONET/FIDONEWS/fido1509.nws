     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     Most people presume that an editor has enough knowledge of the reader
     base out there to present an insightful and 'pleasing-to-the-eye'
     style of publication.

     Then there is the case of one sysop and hub operator who insists that
     unless the *full* 87K of the Zone 1 EchoMail Coordinator election
     results are not posted, some sort of collusion is going on.  So, to
     satisfy his quest for information and his insistence, it is now here.

     To those of you in the *OTHER* Zones, I apologize, but since John has
     decided to personally direct editorial policy in the FidoNews, feel
     free to assess his efforts in editorial control to John Souvestre at
     1:396/1 , or at his E-Mail address of  john@sstar.com.

     To all Zone 1 sysops:  The election protest period will be over and
     done on March 8, 1998.

     Several more relevant and important points...

     I'm having problems with some of the messages being sent to me...are
     these for _me_, or for "The FidoNews Editor"?  Since these all of
     these appear to be for FidoNews or gave permission to be published,
     I have...but please be more careful in sending me things via NetMail
     or E-Mail.  If it is for the next FidoNews, please indicate that by
     sending it to "FidoNews Editor".  I'll see it...<g>

     Also, with an aside to some at the Zone level, your nodelist is very
     much out of date.  This is currently NODELIST.058, not NODELIST.044.

     On another point, and to all who would submit articles for FidoNews
     publication, I refer you to the file (MagicFileName ARTSPEC) called
     ARTSPEC.DOC.  It is also available for view or download at my own
     Web Site at http://209.77.228.66/fidonews (look for the link).  An
     updated copy has been hatched out as well.

     I'll point out now that if I have to hand-edit a message to fit
     the 70-character line limit, I will include the standard newspaper
     tear line of "### 30 ###" to indicate the article was modified by
     myself to fit.  As always, we'll print what you send 'as-is' in all
     instances, though we may send it back to you for 'clean-up'.  See the
     ARTSPEC.DOC for details.

     There is a complaint in one echo that NECs in some networks are
     claiming the 'power' to decide from who and when a sysop can get an
     EchoMail feed, and no changes can be made without the NEC granting
     permission.  Perhaps this is a misinterpretation of a local "no
     dupes" policy; perhaps it is something worse.  Anyone know of this
     situation?

     Also noted is that Net 163 has upped the ante on the pending Policy
     Complaint by picking up nodes in several nations and Zones, as well
     as one totally non-existant phone number for a node.  There doesn't
     FIDONEWS 15-09               Page 2                    2 Mar 1998


     seem to be an "867" area code or country code...anyone know of one?
     Anyone know if the node in Malaysia listed in Net 163 is still active
     and operating?

     To that extent, and with some modification needed to fit it in, some
     one in Region 33 sent a copy of the R33 IP Nodelist, one of the new
     'supplemental' nodelists to meet the needs of a FidoNet growing in a
     new direction, but without the benefit or support of either Policy or
     FidoNet itself.

     One point coming out of the FIDONEWS echo...there seems to be a
     consensus developing over the inclusion of the "page breaks" in the
     general publication of FidoNews...are these being used by anyone out
     there?  Or is there a predominance to find a way to dump them?  Your
     comments on this are solicited.

     Another point of concern is the various 'national' or 'regional'
     versions of the FidoNews out there.  I've run across several, and
     would ask that the editors of these send me the URL for each, and
     the Region that they are published for inclusion in the InterNet
     section of the FidoNews.

     I also invite the editors of each one to contact me so that we can
     come up with a way to set up translations.  Granted, Policy indicates
     that English is the "common tongue" in FidoNet, but Policy also
     encourages the free translation of FidoNet documents into other
     languages as well.

     It would be nice to have a roster for those who wish to see the
     Snooze in all the languages it is available in, no?

     Next to last...we get lots of mail...analysis of the Z1EC election
     and a lesson on statistical analysis to boot; responses to prior
     news; a comment or two on the new FidoNews; and more.

     And, lastly...articles, articles, articles.  Send them in.  From
     anywhere, on any thing, by anyone.  Just use the ARTSPEC instructions
     to make sure that the publication software doesn't choke.  Shoot, we
     even do guest editorials...

     Hi Zorch.

     RE: FIDOECHOPOL, my thoughts.

     Since my NAB_POLICY is still getting linked I threw out the following
     'off-topic' post to possibly stir interest, but see that the topic is
     better suited to FIDOECHOPOL where I've not requested write access.
     If you consider this 'annoying', please let me know.

     If I can be of any assistance to you for FIDONEWS, please let me know
     also.

     Well, we'd gain the right to vote, for whatever that's worth.

     Next reply from John Glinski:

     John G's reply makes no sense.  He would have the moderators become
     nodes just to be nodelisted?  To what end?  The resultant 'node'
     would certainly be subject to P4, but NOT the moderator.  The word
     "moderator" is not to be found in P4, period.

     What John G. wants to propose is that 'all cars _must_ have trailers
     attached to them because we have rules for towing trailers, but
     nothing for cars'.

     Just some ideas for your FIDOECHOPOL discussion.  I've not requested
     'write' permission, and would rather not at this time.  Too much to
     do here if we can get enough interest.

      +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

     As much as I hate to admit it, Bob M. is correct, but for the wrong
     reasons (if he's lurking, _that_ should wake him).   :-)

     We _don't_ own our echoes, and in fact, there is _no_ policy anywhere
     that even gives us the authority to make our own rules for 'our'
     echoes, nor to authorize us to insist that users follow the rules.

     P4 makes 'enough' reference to "echomail" to cover that subject for
     the time being, but often refers to "echomail" as something that
     should be scraped from our shoes should we step in it.  Heaven forbid
     if a node sends echomail during ZMH, and if a node gets too much
     "echomail" he can be restricted to 20 messages per day.  P4 is in
     _SERIOUS_ need of a re-write!  Times have changed!  1989, sheesh!
     Small wonder so many nodes are leaving.

     What we _DO_ need is a FIDONET 'moderator' policy.  Something like:

      +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

       "Echomail"
       ----------
       Echomail is the term used within FidoNet to refer to electronic
       "Conference Mail" messages that, while possibly containing
       the name of a particular individual in the "To:" field, are
       copied and distributed to multiple (possibly several hundred)
       destination systems.  Echomail messages are segregated into
       "Conferences" based upon the topic being discussed.  Echomail
       message content is usually restricted to the topic(s) for which
       the particular conference was created.  The originators of each
       of those "Conferences", as well as their designees and successors
       are called "Moderators", and during their stewardship of their res-
       pective "Conferences" are empowered to establish and enforce rules
       of conduct and topicality to which users are enjoined to adhere.

       Moderators are responsible for insuring the topicality and decorum
     FIDONEWS 15-09               Page 5                    2 Mar 1998


       of their respective "Conferences" in consonance with their
       published rules.  To accomplish this responsibility, a moderator
       may request that a user absent himself from the "Conference".  When
       a user in that category fails to comply, the moderator may request
       the assistance of that user's SysOp, node, or hub, whichever is the
       lowest appropriate level, to effect the absence of that user from
       the "Conference".
      +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

     Wording from "Echomail is..." down to "The originators..." was
     extracted verbatim from the FIDONET document GATEWAY.POL.  Feel free
     to use this any way you wish!

           Good luck...  M.

     There is nothing 'private' in this message Zorch, feel free to use
     its content any way you wish.

     >From Deb Milner, 1:112/285

     It was with interest that I read Wulf Kreuger's article
     in a recent edition of FidoNews regarding the filtering/censorship
     that took place in Zone 2, after all, it's not the first time
     this type of thing has happened.

     Since last year, when a private CRP hub in Net 112
     did the exact same thing to other sysops, ie:  filtering and
     removing all echomail messages to/from individuals
     that particular hub operator had a dislilke for, I have been
     warning that unless some type of action is taken to prevent
     hubs from filtering indiscriminately, that it would happen again.

     It did.  Both here in Net 112, by the same CRP, and now I read
     that it also happened in Zone 2, by Fidonet "officials", no less.

     Folks, if we allow it to continue, anyone, anywhere is going to
     start filtering/censoring echomail based on their personal dislike
     of others.  Think about what this will mean to the integrity of the
     echomail areas you are receiving and reading, or even the mail
     you are sending.

     Echopol is a hotly debated subject, but an echopol could stop it.
     If not an echopol, we need to do something.

     What say you?

     So what?

     The internet and fidonet are totally different things.
     They do things in a different way.

     If you NEED to have the Snooze that fast, then you oughta get a
     better life.

     This is a hobby John, although I know you make some money off it.
     Or maybe you don't.

     There are many other things that are more important than whether it
     takes 6 hours or 18 hours to get out.

     At this point in time, fidonet is the absolutely last thing in order
     of importance to me.
     Why should I worry about when Fidonews arrives when I had thyroid
     surgery to remove a malignant tumor, scheduled for 2/6/98 cancelled,
     because I had a stroke on 2/4/98.

     And now that the effects of the stroke are almost gone, and I am
     back to normal there, my kidneys are failing so that I will probably
     be going on dialysis very shortly.

     And that doesn't even get into my chronic Congestive Heart Failure,
     Coronary Artery Disease, High Blood Pressure, Arthritis and Gout.

     All of which are acting up.

     So, do you really thing I should get upset because it takes a little
     longer for the Snooze, or anything else, for that matter, to get to
     my system?

     No chance.

     But that doesn't mean that I am just going to sit by while you try
     to screw everything up because you can't control it, you can think
     again.

     It is about time you stepped back and stopped trying to take over
     everything, and trying to destroy what you can't control and get
     back to what this hobby is all about:  Communicating with the other
     sysops and HELPING them when they need help.

     An open comment to first, Bob Satti and then, all.  It's from someone
     who genuinely cares about FidoNet, has the ability to operate within
     its scheme of things and, I think, has helped draw out a proper
     viewpoint from some of those who do care, in a proper way.

               Specifically, my congratulations to Bob Kohl..
               He has demonstrated an interesting perspective
               in the dynamics of FidoNet opinion gathering...

                   as have I by losing in the way I did.

               Now lets's examine that....  chuckle...........

     This has nothing to do about my losing or Bob winning.  Please do
     *NOT* make the mistake of thinking this is sour grapes.  Winning or
     losing is frankly not that important to me; FidoNet is.

     To those who voted for me, *THANK YOU VERY MUCH*.  I had been
     wondering about what to do about spending time on Fido in the future.
     For anyone not known in Zone-wide circles to have done this well
     tells me there is a place for what we stand for.  We should march
     forward.   :)

     First, a *HUGE* vote of confidence and thanks to EC Martin Belcke for
     doing one of the most important jobs in Fido's history and doing it
     FIDONEWS 15-09               Page 8                    2 Mar 1998


     very well.  I respect work.  I admire good work.  Martin's work was
     good work.  Thanks also to Lisa Gronke.  Yes, folks, she did a fine
     job.

     From here on, this is all about, "What if?"  It is administrative
     analysis of what we must do to keep FidoNet as alive and well as can
     be expected, under the circumstances.  I think I speak for all who
     supported me; I hope so.  Skip the details of a vote not counted or a
     percentage point not rounded.  This is about the big picture,
     including the small stuff.

     In this ballot process format I counted a published 314 votes:

        25% or  78 - voters - cooperated with full vote choice slates.
        44% or 139 - voters - refused to use it, voting a single vote.

     No, I'm not in favor of holding elections like P4 suggests, with a
     simple majority of those bothering to vote in a single round settling
     matters on big issues.  As a "suggested" P4 format election, the
     "winner" would have had a 45 vote first round "win."  That vote
     method would have said nothing that *MOST* of the few willing to help
     guide Fido are *NOT* happy with the way things are.  This is not a
     minor issue; it is a biggee.  It's critical to address this group for
     Fido to live.  For FidoNet to survive, we must learn better how to
     upgrade the appointment game to walk a finer line between appointment
     and elections to best determine where that line is.

     Yes, FidoNet is not a democracy.  I'm comfortable about that as a
     FidoNet member, NC and proponent.  Yet, this election was so
     important because it was the best sounding board we have had for
     determining how to define that line, properly used.  This election
     was crucial in a far greater sense, because the *FORMAT* of the
     election, preferential balloting, gave us a chance to really learn
     something about Fido and what may be really wrong.

     However, this *SPECIFIC* form of a preferential ballot may not be
     what is needed to save FidoNet.  This preferential ballot format was,
     I think, an error.  By counting partial ballot votes not carried to
     the full depth, we will never know what the MAJORITY really wanted.
     Refusing to fill it out completely, said, "I'm out of here", then
     silence.  We can't afford that.  More than half the voters didn't
     want it.  They said so.  Forced on them, although they cared and made
     an effort to get something done for the real majority wish in
     FidoNet, their real wants have, again, been stripped from them.  This
     has nothing to do with who won or lost.  We *ALL* lost:

         1.) Only 78 or 24% of the total 314 voters were damned well firm
             about what they wanted from the start.   Only this one-fourth
             of the voters bothered to vote a whole rank of candidates.
             On first round stats, as a "P4 compliant" election, (Just
             guidelines!), that would have produced a firm 45 vote
             "margin" for the "winner."  Done that way, the simple
             majority of votes cast, I hold, would do a really bad job of
             producing any true view of the electorate.  This election
             proved that, I think.

     FIDONEWS 15-09               Page 9                    2 Mar 1998


         2.) In this "ending", the "winner" had a 30 vote "margin", but
             won nothing.  Run this way, 139+109=248 or 79% of the voters
             'fixed' their opinion at the end.  However, that's not the
             real story!  The full 139 voters who wouldn't use the ballot
             format never really "voted."  The "results" of the election
             merely indicate almost *HALF* of the entire crew just gave up
             messing with it.

         3.) In my opinion, the total vote *DECLINED* from what it *COULD*
             have been, because of the ballot format!  That's sad.  These
             were people from which we badly needed to hear views.

     The worst part about preferential voting was also very beautifully
     shown here!  Two top candidates together produced total first round
     results of 72+117=189 votes, more than the required 159 to win on the
     first round.  The second and third place 72+54=126 votes were not
     enough to win.  A run-off would have been between the top two
     candidates.  In a conventional election, a waning candidate often
     declares support for someone else, if they wish, at run-off time.
     I believe this markedly alters elections.  Thus a preferential
     ballot, in general, stole that opportunity away from FidoNet at a
     time when we most decidedly need to know the real best answer
     from our members.  I believe people often change their vote, at
     times, completely, after further discussion and round one, yielding
     a greater worth to an election, more accurately measuring desires of
     the people.  This election didn't yield that, in my opinion; it
     prevented it.

     Secondly, preferential balloting makes it more difficult to bring in
     the fold of lesser candidates for the common good, following an
     election.  I have come to understand, of elections, long before this
     one, this is a necessary part of the political "healing" process
     required to forge future alliances for good, those that move polity
     out of the "graveyard" so the skeletons can be bleached in the sun
     and we can move forward.

     In politics, as in much of life, psychologically, we are still
     "hedonistic calculators."  We make decisions as human beings, very
     much on the basis of our personal integral calculus.  This hurts so
     much we either want more or we don't; a little less or more and see
     how much less or more we hurt.  That is the pinnacle of human
     existence, the thing that best separates us from other animals, and,
     in fact, from some of the most animalistic of the human race itself!
     Preferential voting deprives us of this human need.

     Now, again, in the below here, do *NOT* interpret what follows as
     sour grapes.  It is not.  It is a very genuine attempt to use the
     results of the ballot to really show just how bad the issue of Bob's
     way of doing things is hurting FidoNet and what absolutely must be
     addressed to plan for Fido for the future, if, as I see it, we are to
     survive.

     In the best analysis I can make, of the people whom DID vote for
     more than one candidate, somewhat per the format, the following is
     Bob Kohl's final position - the *LAST* person any voter wanted to see
     run things:
     FIDONEWS 15-09               Page 10                   2 Mar 1998


               53 of those voters ranked Bob Kohl dead last.

                9 of those voters ranked Mike Luther dead last.

               Of course, irrespective of a #2 choice only, chuckle!

          But wait!  When the voters *DID* cooperate *FULLY* with the
          format, Messr. Kohl was in the unadmirable position of being
          disliked so damned badly that he was, in the case of the 78
          voters that were good enough to rank all of the candidates...
          even WORSE off:

               42 of 78 such candidates who really knew what they wanted,
                  or 53% told us *EXACTLY* what is wrong with FidoNet.

                2 of 78 such candidates who really knew what they wanted,
                  or 3% put the #2 candidate in that unenviable place.

     We see a perfect example why we shouldn't use this form of
     preferential balloting here, in my opinion.  Because the fallacy of
     permitting a one vote-level ballot, or a repetitive same vote ballot
     was allowed in the count, it hid, "If my candidate is really that
     bad, whom do I wish to suffer under the least?"  How?  It hid the
     real ripoff of this election for FidoNet!

     Most importantly, the real ripoff of this experiment is that 21% or
     65 voters were deprived of voicing their *ALTERABLE* opinions in a
     run off!   Those 65 votes could have swung this election wildly
     either way, folks.  That is why it may never be clear to anyone, what
     might have happened, had folks been given a chance to vote the way
     they wanted to vote, the way they are comfortable in voting and the
     way in which they could have best given in service to FidoNet!   In
     making appointments on what we did here, we may never best make them
     now, simply because of the ballot format!

     I stated in the comment in the election process, that the most
     divisive issues always focus closer and closer to one vote wins, or
     losses.  What this election cost the opportunity to determine, for
     FidoNet, because of the way the ballot was set up, was a real
     opportunity, for the amount of time invested on the part of all.  We
     lost a real handle on just how close or far we are to what will be
     needed to carry us forward.

     What we really lost, was the ability to best determine, whether what
     Bob Kohl or Mike Luther stands for will kill us, or carry us into the
     future.  We really settled nothing about the divisions of leadership
     in Fido that are the single most important thing we *MUST* fix to
     best keep Fido alive and guarding the dog house for us all.

     To really understand what is needed, we needed *ALL* six vote steps
     from *EVERYONE*, or at worst, have a reasonable majority of those in
     FidoNet whom did vote do that!  I hope an awfully good chance to
     really look at what is needed for FidoNet is not thrown away.

     If I were Bob Satti, I would invite anyone whom wanted to fill in the
     rest of the ballot to do so, netmail him the results.  Then he should
     FIDONEWS 15-09               Page 11                   2 Mar 1998


     act accordingly.  The fate of Fido is too important for any less, I
     opine.  The deal you do not investigate is always the deal you lose
     and this has nothing to do with who "won" or "lost" this race.  :)

     _both_ ways.

     I believe that is the part of my claim that you don't seem to

     something you tend not to tolerate too well.

     Let me ask you a specific question, then, John...when Bruce Bodger

     Did you support Bruce because you supported democracy, or because you
     don't like Satti as Z1C?

      JS> live to regret.

     I doubt it, John...that's a fundamental principle of any government,
     democracy or otherwise.

     The power elite always does what it can to insure that it remains in
     the control of the societal macrocosm.  The "13 Old Men in Geneva" or
     the "Illuminati" are archetypes of that structure, though the more
     correct and proper power elite are the holding companies which
     provide the financial support for industry, and thus the economy.

     In Britain and the US, and to a large extent most English-speaking
     nations, that power structure is the insurance/pension industry which
     is heavily invested.  In Asia, particularly Japan, and some of the
     so-called Lowland Countries in Europe, that structure is the banking
     industry.

     If anyone were to threaten their ability to dominate and influence
     the power structure, then the organic model of governmental theory
     comes to light...the 'system' reacts as a 'living being' and does
     what it can to repel the 'threat', up to and including damaging
     itself as necessary.

     Or, if you will, like the various species of lizard, the 'system'
     will be willing to lose a leg or a tail if it insures continued
     survival.

     The dynamic questions present in FidoNet currently are whether the
     sysops are reacting to the overt control expressed by the *C
     structure as well as the growing monopolization of the control of
     echomail/file distributions, or if it is the *C/*EC structure
     reacting to both mollify the sysops and protect itself from being
     overwhelmed by the echomail distribution system's growning influence
     over FidoNet operations, or if it is the effort of the echomail
     distribution to bring about a change in the societal understanding of
     cooperation between the various levels of FidoNet by incurring a
     larger influence on the events of sysop connectivity, inter-network
     distribution (between nets, Regions, and Zones, as well as between
     the various smaller distributions) as well as attempting to insure
     that a sufficient income is available to offset the costs of echomail
     distribution as much as is economically feasible.

     At this point in time, it appears that the echomail distribution
     services (EDS) is taking it in the shorts, and that the *C/*EC
     structure is ganging up on it with the cooperation of the sysops.

     The net result of this will either be that the EDS will shut down,
     leaving a vacuum for the smaller distributions to move into, or the
     EDS will finally look to the reasons *why* this point in time has
     been reached, and how it got there...the key factor will be if it can
     look _past_ the personalities involved, and truly _examine_ the
     issues rather than casting blame on anyone who happens to disagree
     with it (see above, your comments and mine on "free speech").

     The end result will be that FidoNet will become a close-knit, almost
     incestuous group that will dwindle down to nothing for fear that
     FIDONEWS 15-09               Page 15                   2 Mar 1998


     'cooperation' and 'philanthropy' will be considered signs of
     weakness, or FidoNet will figure out that no _one_ group can control
     the whole...and that all parts need to cooperate openly and clearly,
     without resorting to the "Me! Mine!" mentality that leads to the
     previous.

     Or, total order and total anarchy.  Without the breaking of the
     pattern, those are the two futures that FidoNet faces.  One person/
     group overwhelmingly controls it, micromanaging it to death; the
     other disregards any and all rules and works "at the moment".

     Your reactions and response fit into the classic patterns that most
     any student of governance and governmental structures can see.  Lots
     of laymen, too.

     Your stated objectives may be noble-sounding, but your actions and
     efforts say far more about your agenda than what you wish others to
     believe.

     To wit:

     JS> The only change I've worked for in R10 is to give SysOps a say in
     JS> who there C and ECs are.

     That you are _making_ an effort and doing it _in_ any Region is a
     clearer indication of your goals than anything else could possibly
     display.  Your otherwise noble statement of wishing the SysOps the
     ability to choose their own leadership is belied by the effort you've
     made to cast aspersions and doubts on the ability of Bob Kohl to do
     his job, and repeated comments on how an election needs to be held,
     when there hasn't been any 'popular support' or 'groundswell of
     discontent' to back it up.

     There is dissent...if there were not, then I would be one of the
     first to complain, if for no other reason than to _provide_ that
     dissent.

     But there is no reason to not allow _response_ to that dissent,
     regardless of how it is phrased....again, refer back to the comment
     of "free speech" at the beginning.

     Not at all, John.  No matter what happens, it will always boil down
     to personal matters...after all, that's what "free choice" is about.

     In many cases, the issues being discussed are beyond, above or
     irrelevant to what is on the minds of most of the readers here.

     In others, the issues are occulted by lesser discussions that _seem_
     more important but are irrelevant.

     It ends up leaving those who would be involved to either throw up
     their hands in frustration (the majority response) or to delve into
     the issues and understand the dynamics involved.

     In this case, you apparently don't want a ZEC who will act against
     _your_ wishes, even if it is for the *betterment* of FidoNet
     _overall_.  You apparently don't even want the _possibility_ of such
     a ZEC coming to power.

     Unlike yourself, however, I see where decisions may be made like that
     which I won't agree with, either...but I can see beyond myself, and
     look to the betterment of the group _as_a_whole_.

     You and I are only two small _parts_ of a larger mechanism.  Our
     independence of action is solely based on how we wish to interact
     with the whole, not just _parts_ of the whole.

     If you want _total_ individuality, then you shouldn't be in an
     association of cooperating individuals.

      JS> Chris Baker pegged you well.

     Perhaps he did.  Didn't seem to indicate this when we discussed
     matters after the weekend just past.

     Or are you simply exhibiting poor taste again in bringing up Chris'
     name at this time?

     Either way, John, is there now any point in contacting you about
     hatching the FidoNews into distribution as Chris said to, if your
     opinion of me is so low?

     Or are you going to take the 'far view' as I do, and do it for the
     overall benefit of FidoNet itself?

     Your call.  The issue goes out Sunday at or about 1800 Pacific time.

                          TRUE STORIES OF FIDONET
     =================================================================


     The "Larry (Larry-bud) Jaster" story...
     by Jack Sargent, 1:379/12

     In April of 1997, we finally caught up with the infamous anal
     retentive, Charles Wharton, alias Jaster or "larry-bud," who
     had literally plagued a number of Fido echoes, including UFO
     for several years.

     As it happened, a friend, Pat Parrinello was attending his web
     site when Charles Wharton "signed in," and proceeded to leave
     behind his foul vulgarisms of an anal-retentive nature. Pat
     monitored the situation and also notified Don Allen, a past
     moderator of UFO, and long-time victim of Mr. Wharton. Pat and
     Don then notified me of the incident and furnished me with
     "Larry-bud's" address.

     Here is the story, told in a series of e-mail exchanges between
     "Larry-bud" and myself. Note his tone in the beginning compared to
     his demeanor at the end.

     First of all, I never left any messages that Don Allen is referring
     to. I have discussed this with the person complaining about messages
     on his Internet page, and have informed my provider that, if the
     messages came from my provider, then I want to know from whom. So do
     they.

     Second, if it is so that Don Allen, or someone, left libelous
     messages on various computer discussion groups, then that is a job
     for a lawyer on Monday morning.

     Third, as this flurry of messages was going out, someone, probably
     the culprit, left a message with my Internet address, that was
     forwarded to me on a Usenet group, containing some libelous material.
     That has also been retrieved by my provider and they have the means
     to track exactly where it came from and from whom.

     The information I have is, you were caught in the act of

     as you were typing.  ...And traced the call back to...  ...You!

     It is YOUR hand that's been caught in the till!

     I am willing for you to pursue this issue to its climax, so go ahead
     with your legal options.  Hell, man, I'm the victim here, not you!
     You had better be prepared to prove you were not within miles of your
     computer when the obscene material was posted (on a number of
     occasions) to Pat's website. All I want from you (at present) is
     1. Your apology.
     2. Your promise to cease
     from posting anal retentive, obscene, thilthy messages into my echo.
     You do that, and I won't sue your ass off!  Do you understand that,
     mister?  You enter my echo with your real name and apologize, it's
     that simple.

     This is the information that is available to your provider when you
     use your account:

     The account name.
     The phone number.
     The address the phone is located at.
     The type of computer by brand and size (from internally encrypted
     information) i e: Mac, IBM, IBM clone, desktop, portable, etc.

     Not all of this information has been made available to us, and won't
     be until ordered by a federal judge presiding over FCC regulation
     infractions. (Read the first 3 pages in your phone book, or those
     that apply to obscenity laws.)

     Establishing your guilt or innocence is not a problem, as you can
     plainly deduce. ...Should charges be brought forth (not entirely my
     decision), it becomes an open and shut case, and damages will be
     awarded.  Your wife Sharon will know you for a maggot.  Your church
     will excommunicate you. ...Yet you brazenly still deny wrong doing.
     Once a judge demands the information from your provider(s), the
     attorneys will make their decisions (usually determined on the
     financial worth of the defendant).  You know how lawyers are.

     You have a little over 24 hours to decide what to do about my demands
     for a public apology (provided the others involved haven't changed
     their minds and are seeking independent counsel).

     I see!  Well, I'm not sure what I'm going to do next, but
     this note and its predecessors will be posted in their entirety on

     As you can see, folks, Mr. Wharton starts out rather brazen, and
     makes inuendos about taking legal action. ...But as the communiques
     progress, his attitude changes... ...Not to one who has been falsely
     accused, as an innocent person would normally feel, but to one who
     sees the rope hanging on the gallows, waiting...  ...And ends with
     his apology.

     Are these the replies of an innocent man?  ...Or are they instead,
     the words of one who is fearful of the consequences of his actions
     for 3 years.

     You be the judge.

     My thanks to Pat Parrinello, his swift attentiveness, and his
     long-distant phone calls that helped bring this to our attention.
     ...Also thanks to Don Allen for gathering the initial information
     together, and presenting it to the echo in an informative, well put
     together package.

     If the transcripts of the dialogue between me and Charles Wharton
     seem a little repetitive, I did the best I could moving them from a
     WINDOWS environment into a series of text files that I could present
     to you here.

     Z1EC Election Results
     Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator Election
          Election Results as posted by the Election Coordinator

     In accordance with a directive from the Zone 1 Coordinator
     charging the Region Echomail Coordinator Council (RECC) with the
     task of organizing an election for Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator,
     the RECC selected an Election Coordinator (Martin Belcke) to
     conduct the election.  Following the selection of the EC, the
     ground rules for the election were written, using input from the
     Sysops of Zone 1 and the RECC.  The final draft of the election
     rules were approved by a vote of the RECC.  The election coordinator
     then announced the time-frame as called for in the election rules.
     During the original time-frame set for the campaign period, a
     severe winter storm affect a large portion of Zone 1 and the
     campaign period was extended a week to accomadate those nodes
     affected by the storm.  This was the only change made in the
     election process once started, and was within the rules of the
     election as the rules did not specify specific length of time
     for each phase of the election process, thus leaving some
     flexibility for unforseen circumstances, such as the storm.

     Of the estimated number of nodes in Zone 1 (6,000), only 316
     nodes chose to participate in the Z1EC election process.  This
     is around 5% of the total nodes in the Zone.  Of the 344 nets
     in Zone 1, 111 nets were represented by at least one person
     voting from that net.  This represents 32% of the total nets.

     Since there were more than 2 candidates, a process known as
     preferential balloting was used to eliminate the need for
     holding multiple elections between run-off candidates and to
     allow the casting of a single ballot, listing the candidates
     in order of preference.  During each round of tallying the
     votes, the candidate listed first on the ballot was used as
     the 1st choice for that ballot, removing the names of any
     candidates that had been eliminated during any previous round
     tallying the ballots.  If the 1st choice candidate was
     eliminated, the name was removed and the rest of the names
     moved up one position.  If all names on a ballot were eliminated,
     the ballot was then also eliminated and the total number of valid
     ballots was reduced by the number of ballots eliminated.  The
     total number of votes required to win was also adjusted in the
     same manner.  The actual tallying of each round is listed after
     this synopsis of the election results.

     BAD BALLOTS:
     ============

     There were 8 invalid ballots received.  Ballots were required to
     contain certain information as per the election rules.  If the
     FIDONEWS 15-09               Page 27                   2 Mar 1998


     ballot did not contain the required information, the ballot was
     an invalid ballot.  The election coordinator was not required to
     notify a voter that the ballot was invalid, but I fealt it only
     right to notify the voter and allow the opportunity to re-send a
     valid ballot.  Nine voters took advantage of this and re-sent the
     ballot with the required information.

     Ballots declared invalid and reasons are:

     Ballot 1 - Name of sender did not match name as listed in nodelist.
                Sender was notified, but did not respond.  Ballot was
                declared invalid at close of voting.

     Ballot 2 - Name of sender did not match name as listed in nodelist.
                Sender was notified, but did not respond.  Ballot was
                declared invalid at close of voting.

     Ballot 3 - Node number not listed in nodelist.  Unable to notify
                sender as node is not listed.  Ballot was declared
                invalid at close of voting.

     Ballot 4 - Name of sender did not match node number listed in
                nodelist.  Sender was notified, but did not respond.
                Ballot was declared invalid at close of voting.

     Ballot 5 - Ballot did not contain any candidates name.  Sender
                was notified and re-sent same ballot.  Ballot was
                declared invalid at close of voting.

     Ballot 6 - Ballot received after the close of voting.  Time
                stamp of netmail was prior to closing, but ballot
                was sent direct after the close of voting.  Sender
                was notified via routed netmail.

     Ballot 7 - Ballot received after the close of voting.  Time
                stamp of netmail was prior to closing, but ballot
                was sent direct after the close of voting.  Sender
                was notified via routed netmail.

     Ballot 8 - Ballot received after the close of voting.  Time
                stamp on ballot is after the close of voting.  Sender
                was notified via routed netmail.

     ========================= END OF BALLOTS ===========================
     FOOTNOTES:

     (1) Invalid candidate listed

     (2) An INVALID BALLOT was a ballot received that did not contain the
         information as required by the election rules.  Any person that
         cast such a ballot was sent a netmail (or e-mail) message
         informing them that their ballot was invalid and given the
         opportunity to re-send the ballot with the required information.
         If the person did not re-send the ballot with the required
         information, then the ballot was declared invalid at the close
         of the voting period.

         An INVALID BALLOT was also a ballot received that was sent after
         the voting deadline.  For the purpose of routed netmail ballots,
         the time the ballot entered the routing stream (first via line)
         is the time of the ballot.

     ========================= END OF BALLOTS ===========================
     FOOTNOTES:

     (1) Invalid candidate listed

     (2) An INVALID BALLOT was a ballot received that did not contain the
         information as required by the election rules.  Any person that
         cast such a ballot was sent a netmail (or e-mail) message
         informing them that their ballot was invalid and given the
         opportunity to re-send the ballot with the required information.
         If the person did not re-send the ballot with the required
         information, then the ballot was declared invalid at the close
         of the voting period.

         An INVALID BALLOT was also a ballot received that was sent after
         the voting deadline.  For the purpose of routed netmail ballots,
         the time the ballot entered the routing stream (first via line)
         is the time of the ballot.

     ========================= END OF BALLOTS ===========================
     FOOTNOTES:

     (1) Invalid candidate listed

     (2) An INVALID BALLOT was a ballot received that did not contain the
         information as required by the election rules.  Any person that
         cast such a ballot was sent a netmail (or e-mail) message
         informing them that their ballot was invalid and given the
         opportunity to re-send the ballot with the required information.
         If the person did not re-send the ballot with the required
         information, then the ballot was declared invalid at the close
         of the voting period.

         An INVALID BALLOT was also a ballot received that was sent after
         the voting deadline.  For the purpose of routed netmail ballots,
         the time the ballot entered the routing stream (first via line)
         is the time of the ballot.

     ========================= END OF BALLOTS ===========================
     FOOTNOTES:

     (1) Invalid candidate listed

     (2) An INVALID BALLOT was a ballot received that did not contain the
         information as required by the election rules.  Any person that
         cast such a ballot was sent a netmail (or e-mail) message
         informing them that their ballot was invalid and given the
         opportunity to re-send the ballot with the required information.
         If the person did not re-send the ballot with the required
         information, then the ballot was declared invalid at the close
         of the voting period.

         An INVALID BALLOT was also a ballot received that was sent after
         the voting deadline.  For the purpose of routed netmail ballots,
         the time the ballot entered the routing stream (first via line)
         is the time of the ballot.

     (1) Invalid candidate listed

     (2) An INVALID BALLOT was a ballot received that did not contain the
         information as required by the election rules.  Any person that
         cast such a ballot was sent a netmail (or e-mail) message
         informing them that their ballot was invalid and given the
         opportunity to re-send the ballot with the required information.
         If the person did not re-send the ballot with the required
         information, then the ballot was declared invalid at the close
         of the voting period.

         An INVALID BALLOT was also a ballot received that was sent after
         the voting deadline.  For the purpose of routed netmail ballots,
         the time the ballot entered the routing stream (first via line)
         is the time of the ballot.

     ========================= END OF BALLOTS ===========================
     FOOTNOTES:

     (1) Invalid candidate listed

     (2) An INVALID BALLOT was a ballot received that did not contain the
         information as required by the election rules.  Any person that
         cast such a ballot was sent a netmail (or e-mail) message
         informing them that their ballot was invalid and given the
         opportunity to re-send the ballot with the required information.
         If the person did not re-send the ballot with the required

         An INVALID BALLOT was also a ballot received that was sent after
         the voting deadline.  For the purpose of routed netmail ballots,
         the time the ballot entered the routing stream (first via line)
         is the time of the ballot.
