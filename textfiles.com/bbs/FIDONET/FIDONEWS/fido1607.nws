     Greetings,

     And you had a good Valentine's Day?  Great!

     And what happens now, that Billy is found not guilty?  What a circus
     that was.  Such a waste of money, only the guys in the US of A can do.
     Well, I suppose it's all part of politics, which only the people in
     Zone 1 can understand. ;-)

     What is happening in Zone 2, Region 29?  I believe there are some very
     disgruntled SysOps there, who just had it with their Z2C.

     And my sympathy to all the Jordanians on the loss of their King.

     Read well,

     Cat Fight in the Backbone

                          Cat Fight in the Backbone
                  Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     Arguments in the BACKBONE echo were described a while back as "Cats
     tossing sand at each other."  The cats have abandoned scratching the
     sand in favor of scratching each other :(

     In the last two weeks, John Souvestre has been asked to leave the
     NAB, George Peace has been asked, Ken Wilson has been criticized for
     holding echomail, Butch Walker has been asked to resign as OBO, and
     several other mail movers have been invited to leave.  One could
     easily get the impression that these folks don't want to work
     together any more.

     There have been some technical problems, for sure... but the
     arguments have moved beyond problem resolution and into the realm
     of punishment for those who have failed to move the mail in an
     acceptable manner.  The conversation has strayed from how to best
     make the mail move for Fidonet as a whole to a discussion on who is
     the "best" mail mover.

     Echomail and Netmail are still moving*, though one questions how
     long it will continue if the mail movers don't want to work with
     each other.  Cooperation is especially critical in a hobby, because
     the only real incentive to making things work is the satisfaction
     which each individual derives.

     Figure out how to work together, folks.  I don't know how to restore
     enjoyment to the hobby for you all, but I'll make a few suggestions:

     1.  Remember the contributions which each of the mail movers has
     made to Fido instead of concentrating on the individual weaknesses
     or failures.  Now is a time for restoring the satisfaction to the
     hobby, not a time for picking each other apart.

     2.  Concentrate on one technical problem at a time, rather than
     trying to draw a broad principle from each one.  Now is a time for
     making things work, not pledging allegiance to policy documents.

     3.  Stop asking each other to leave.  It's true that Fido could
     probably work without any specific individual, but the "invitations"
     foster an atmosphere where no one will want to pick up the slack.

     A while back, I'd been impressed with echomail from Kay Shapero, so
     I'd saved it.  Though it was written before the current round of
     infighting in the BACKBONE echo, it applies.  I've submitted it as a
     separate article.

     * Ironically, I was cut off from echomail and netmail for a couple

     of days this week.  So far as I know at this point, it was a local
     problem - My NC couldn't connect with George Peace - and it's been
     resolved, but I was wondering if the big boys had pulled the plug...

      Kay Shapero on Cooperation
      --------------------------

      DM> I remember that cooperation stuff.  I think it got replaced by
      DM>P4 about ten years ago :(

     Actually it still goes on (speaking as one of the folks who just
     finished voluntarily notifying every moderator who hadn't checked in
     since the change of echolist keeper, to make sure they knew where to
     mail their updates).  What people tend to forget is that P4 is a set
     of operational rules, not laws.

     Operational rules tell you how to do something, and if you don't
     follow them it doesn't get done.  Laws tell you what you MUST do (or
     not do) under pain of enforcement.  Operational rules can be pretty
     broad, so long as the necessary information appears in sufficient
     detail that the reader can figure out how to do it right.  Laws have
     to be incredibly specific, in order to avoid loopholes.
     Operational rules are like explaining to a human being; laws are more
     like programming a computer.  And ultimately, operational rules exist
     on the assumption that those involved intend to cooperate, laws on the
     assumption that a significant fraction do NOT.

     I submit that there isn't enough true enforcement power in the
     entirety of FIDOnet to convert it into a true rule by law
     organization, but that the attempt, if carried through forcefully
     enough can kill it.  I know I'd be unlikely to hang around... and like
     the rest of us I do have other places to go.
