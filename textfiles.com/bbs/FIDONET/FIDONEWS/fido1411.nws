     Fortunately, FidoNews takes input from anyone and all angles and
     voices can be heard albeit a week delayed in the case of several of

     I expect we will have more responses next week.

     So, sorry, Gary [et al], this Issue is not 26K.

     Communication is what we are here for so let's communicate at ALL the
     levels of FidoNet. Quando Omni Flunkus Moritati may have worked just
     fine in the 5,000 Node days but sooner or later something is going to

     * ACLU Welcomes "Pro-CODE" Encryption Bill, Warns of Anti-Privacy
     Legislation Waiting in the Wings

        The American Civil Liberties Union today praised Senator Conrad
     Burns (R-MT) for his leadership in protecting free speech and online
     privacy and welcomed the introduction of  S.377, the "Promotion of
     Commerce in a Digital Era Act (Pro-CODE)."

        The bill, introduced by Senator Burns on the Senate floor last
     week, aims at lifting export controls on encryption with a resulting
     increase in privacy protection for both communications and stored
     information, the ACLU said.

        Encryption programs scramble information so that it can only be
     read with a "key" -- a code the recipient uses to unlock the scrambled
     electronic data.  Programs that use more than 40 bits of data to
     encode information are considered "strong" encryption. Currently,
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 3                   17 Mar 1997


     unless these keys are made available to the government, the
     Clinton/Gore Administration bans export of hardware or software
     containing strong encryption, treating these products as "munitions."

         The ACLU said the anti-cryptography ban has considerably weakened
     U.S. participation in the global marketplace, in addition to
     curtailing freedom of speech by denying users the right to "speak"
     using encryption.   The ban also violates the right to privacy by
     limiting the ability to protect sensitive information in the new
     computerized world.

        The ACLU believes that both encryption programs and communications
     using such programs are free speech, fully protected by the First
     Amendment.  A recent federal court decision -- now under appeal by the
     government -- has upheld this view.  The ACLU plans to submit a
     friend-of-the-court brief in that case (Bernstein v. U.S. Dept. of
     State), as it has done in other legal challenges to the
     Administration's anti-encryption policy.

        "Privacy, anonymity and security in the digital world depend on
     encryption," said Donald Haines, legislative counsel on privacy and
     cyberspace issues for the ACLU's Washington national office.  "The aim
     of the Pro-CODE bill is to allow U.S. companies to compete with
     industries abroad and lift restrictions on the fundamental right to
     free speech, the hallmark of American democracy."

        Haines said that the ACLU is urging other senators to support and
     co-sponsor the bill.  However, he noted that certain provisions raised
     important, "troubling" concerns that should be addressed before a
     final vote.

        For example, the bill provides that, in exchange for "relaxing
     export controls...this Act creates an obligation on the part
     of...companies involved in the export of information security products
     to share information ...about those products to designated
     representatives of the federal government." (Section 2(a)(16)).  Such
     an exchange undermines a central purpose of Pro-CODE: fostering
     American competitiveness, Haines said.

        "Who would want to buy a privacy protection program  bearing a
     label 'inspected by the U.S. government?'  That's fine for meat
     inspection, but it is not appropriate or wise for cryptography
     products," Haines said.  "It is also downright offensive to say you
     can exercise your free speech rights only after discussing what you
     want to say with federal agents."

        Another troubling provision of Pro-CODE would establish a secret
     "Information Security Board" composed of agencies involved in
     information security policy.  According to the bill, the purpose of
     the board would be for government agencies -- including the CIA, FBI,
     NSA and Department of Defense -- to meet with industry leaders to
     review "developments" in cryptography technologies.

        Aside from concerns that such agencies have a history  of invading
     privacy and violating civil liberties, the bill wrongly exempts the
     board from the federal open-meeting requirements, according to Barry
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 4                   17 Mar 1997


     Steinhardt, associate director of the national ACLU and chair of the
     ACLU's Cyber-Liberties Task Force.

        "Government should not operate in secret," Steinhardt said.  "Even
     if the board's meetings are limited to discussing general,
     non-proprietary industry developments, the Federal Advisory Committee
     Act should apply and the meetings should be open to the public.  While
     we continue to urge against the creation of an advisory board, at a
     minimum any meetings should be open and  should include consumers and
     members of the privacy community, who are conspicuously absent from
     the list."

        Some cryptography experts have also questioned whether the
     technical definitions in the bill will actually provide the
     broad-scale protection for encryption supported by Senator Burns.
     While clearly covering mass-market products (e.g., Netscape's Internet
     browser), the question is whether the protection would also cover the
     kind of encryption program the court upheld in Bernstein.

        Notwithstanding these concerns, the ACLU welcomed the Burns bill
     as a positive step toward eliminating unconstitutional restrictions on
     a developing industry that promises to enhance free speech and privacy
     for everyone in the Information Age.

        Senator Burns, as chair of the subcommittee on telecommunications,
     has scheduled a hearing on the Pro-CODE bill for March 11, with
     possible action by the full Senate Commerce Committee as early as the
     following week.

        "In both this Congress and the last one, Senator Burns has
     consistently championed free speech and privacy in the encryption
     debate," said the ACLU's Don Haines.  "He deserves our support and
     full cooperation in moving this bill, and we look forward to working
     with him to resolve our concerns."

        Haines warned that more restrictive proposals are already waiting
     in the wings, with provisions that would take a first step toward
     establishing mandatory controls on domestic encryption and requiring
     encryption "keyholders" to share their keys with the government.

        "In addition to supporting Pro-CODE,  we are closely monitoring
     all new encryption legislation.   The ACLU will vigorously oppose any
     scheme that calls for  key escrow, key recovery, or takes a step
     toward mandatory controls on encryption," Haines said.

     * ACLU Moves to Protect Netizens From Prosecution Under New York
     Cybercensorship Law

     Despite two lower court rulings protecting Internet users from
     prosecution under the federal Communications Decency Act, "netizens"
     are still in danger of criminal charges under a New York law that
     restricts free speech in cyberspace, the American Civil Liberties
     Union said today.

     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 5                   17 Mar 1997


     Moving to protect netizens, the ACLU and the New York Civil Liberties
     Union yesterday filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in federal
     district court, saying that their plaintiffs (and all Internet users)
     could face prison sentences of up to four years under the law. The
     federal CDA is currently awaiting review by the U.S. Supreme Court.

     "Governor Pataki may say that he is trying to protect minors, but the
     sad fact is that this law does not and cannot protect children," said
     Ann Beeson, an ACLU national staff attorney specializing in cyberspace
     issues. "The only immediate harm on the horizon is to the millions of
     Internet users, including our plaintiffs, who face criminal
     prosecution for exercising their right to free speech."

     "Parents, not the government, should control what their children see
     online," Beeson added. "This can be more effectively and less
     restrictively accomplished through the use of blocking software and
     the development of other technology that allows for voluntary
     screening."

     Because New York State has refused to stay prosecution while the
     Supreme Court considers the federal law, the case is now moving
     forward to a courtroom hearing, scheduled to begin on April 3. The
     hearing is expected to last from three to five days and will likely
     include a live demonstration of the Internet as well as testimony from
     expert witnesses and plaintiffs.

     The brief also includes the assertion that the Act violates the
     CommerceClause of the United States Constitution because it regulates
     communications outside the state of New York and subjects Internet
     users to a confusing babel of conflicting state laws.

     "A librarian in Illinois will now think twice before sending
     information to a fellow librarian in New York, or will not 'link' to a
     website in New York for fear that New York authorities will charge
     them under this confusing statute," said Judith Krug, director of the
     American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.

     "Despite the fact that this is a New York statute, given the reality
     of the Internet, anyone who accesses information from outside New York
     is also impacted by this law. This is clearly unacceptable for any
     Internet user," she added.

     Citing opinions that struck down the federal CDA, the ACLU said that
     the New York law contains the same "fatal constitutional flaws." A
     chart appended to the brief shows, point by point, the similarities --
     including, in some cases, identical language -- between the two laws.
     A favorable decision by the high court would provide powerful
     ammunition against the New York law, the ACLU said.

     "We are surprised and disappointed that the State of New York is
     rushing to judgment on an issue of critical importance, when everyone
     knows that the U.S. Supreme Court will be hearing arguments on the
     related federal case two weeks from now," said Norman Siegel,
     executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.

     The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral argument in Reno v. ACLU
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 6                   17 Mar 1997


     on March 19. A decision is expected to be handed down by the end of
     the term, in June or July.

     DIFFERENCES:  FIDONET/INTERNET

             By Pete Snidal (C) 1997
              sysop, Fidonet 1:354/910

         Have you heard of the Internet?  It's doubtful there's anyone
         alive on the planet who hasn't, but have you heard of Fidonet?
         Fidonet has been around and functioning as long as the Internet,
         and is still alive and well, thank you, but for some reason, we
         don't hear of it every time we turn on the tv or pick up a
         magazine.

         Fidonet is also a resource available to anyone with a computer and
         a modem, and following is a comparison of it and the much-touted
         internet:

     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 7                   17 Mar 1997


     FIDONET         Is a system of hobbyist-operated bulletin boards,
                     spanning the world, which connect and exchange data
                     regularly, usually on a nightly schedule.  There
                     are 28,000 Fidonet nodes on Earth, 9400 in North
                     America, and 16,000 in Europe.

     INTERNET        Is a system of server computers, also spanning the
                     world, which are virtually connected to one another
                     at all times.

     FIDONET         Offers the local user a series of conference areas,
                     which host discussions on specific subjects, such
                     as alternative medicine, home schooling, bicycling,
                     etc.  There are over 1000 such "Fidoechoes," and
                     few fidonet bbs's carry them all.  But your "local"
                     can usually be convinced to carry the ones you want.
                     The "Noise/signal ratio" of these echoes is quite
                     low, and the atmosphere is generally very folksy,
                     friendly, and casual. "Fidoecho" traffic is carried
                     from the originating bbs's to bbs' all over the world
                     which carry that echo, so discussion is facilitated
                     between people on an ongoing basis who are separated
                     by thousands of miles.

     INTERNET        Discussion of various subjects is carried by USENET
                     NEWS.  There are many UN areas, such as
                     rec.motorcycle, or alt.space.aliens.ufo, but there is
                     usually a very high "noise/signal" ratio on Usenet,
                     and the areas are hard to read and post in.  There is
                     also much hostility, or "flaming" on Internet UN
                     discussion areas.

     FIDONET         Most Fidonet bbs's have a Files Area, from which the
                     user may download a number of programme files, all of
                     which will be "shareware," or "freeware."  In some
                     cases, files of particular interest may even be "File
                     Requested" from other systems.  Many Fidonet systems
                     also carry a large number of information, or text
                     files, and some picture files, sound files, etc.

     INTERNET        Gives access to thousands of "FTP sites," which are
                     repositories for files by the millions.  They are
                     invaluable if you know what files you want and where
                     they are located, but finding them amongst all the
                     dross is often very time-consuming and requires a fair
                     bit of experience and expertise.

     FIDONET         Lets users send "netmail" to users of other fidonet
                     bbs's around the world.  This is private mail,
                     accessible only at the destination bbs, and readable
                     only by the addressee and the sysops through whose
                     systems it passes.  It is not instant, nor is it
                     guaranteed, but it usually gets there, and faster than
                     normal surface mail, as well as .43 cents cheaper.
                     Sending of commercial messages in Fidonet is
                     prohibited, and "Spamming" - electronic junk-mail - is
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 8                   17 Mar 1997


                     impossible.

     INTERNET        Provides "email" - probably it's best function.  Email
                     travels from origin ISP to destination ISP very
                     quickly, usually within an hour or less.  It also
                     costs nothing to send, other than the price of
                     subscription to the ISP (Internet Service Provider.)
                     "Spamming" - the sending of electronic junkmail to
                     your personal email box - is seriously frowned upon,
                     and sort of prohibited, but the fight with those who
                     would capitalize on this resource in this way is
                     ongoing.

     INTERNET        Allows access to the "World Wide Web."  Access to Web
                     Pages is an eye-opening experience, and allows
                     virtually anyone to give the world access to their
                     advertising, opinions, etc., on virtually any subject.
                     Comparable to leafing through an inexhaustible supply
                     of electronic magazine pages - complete with full
                     graphics, and "hyper-text" ability to jump from
                     subject to subject, and to follow "threads" of subject
                     material with a click of the mouse.  An awesome
                     information source, but with a scary potential for
                     wasting time and money (once your monthly maximum
                     contract time has been consumed.)

                     A special note to teachers and parents:  In fairness,
                     it must be noted that web access is not always a good
                     thing.  Since the "web" is a constantly growing,
                     almost living thing, there is no way to check just
                     what your charges - students or children (or both)
                     will have access to.  Or just what will have access to
                     them.  Thus, pages are presented which invite children
                     to join the Crips, for instance, or which espouse drug
                     use, pornography, violence, and many other things
                     which the intelligent leader of children would not
                     support.  As such pages can be on any server computer
                     anywhere in the world, there is little in the way of
                     accountability for those who present this
                     objectionable material.

     FIDONET         Access is provided to various text and graphic files,
                     but the machine on which the data is mounted is
                     locally accessible, and full accountability is thus
                     ensured.  Furthermore, the supervising adult can
                     access the same system his/herself, and be satisfied
                     as to the level of objectionability provided.  And if
                     there is a serious objection, the operator of the
                     system is someone in your local calling area, who can
                     be contacted, and if necessary, taken to task.
                     Fidonet gives no direct access to server computers
                     "somewhere" on the worldwide web.

     FIDONET         Has no parallel to the web.  The web is truly awesome
                     technology, but its phenomenal entertainment value
                     soon wears thin.
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 9                   17 Mar 1997


     FIDONET         Costs the user nothing.  Free basic access is a
                     fundamental given on all Fidonet systems.  User
                     support is sometimes encouraged, but never demanded.

     FIDONET         Encourages the use of Pre-Windows computers, or
                     "dosboxes."  There is a plethora of software available
                     for Fidonet technology, from that for the most basic
                     user online, through offline mail readers, to node
                     and bbs software, as well as Internet gating mail
                     feeders, all of which run fine in Dosboxes such as
                     286's and even XT's, with small hard drives, or no
                     hard drives, and with memory as low as the basic 640K.

     INTERNET        Service Providers whose systems don't require Windows
                     software for access are few and far between.  They
                     require a "Winsock" in order to connect, and they
                     the user needs to have such software as Eudora Mailer,
                     and Netscape or some other hi-tech "browser."  These
                     are fine software for the user with a minimum 4 Meg
                     386 running Windows 3.x or over, but the prospective
                     user with the earlier computer is just out of luck.

     INTERNET        "No tickee, no launlee" is the motto of the ISP.  The
                     Internet is a strictly commercial, no-bones money-
                     making proposition.  It's explosion in recent years is
                     due only to an ever-increasing interest by free-
                     enterprise capitalism to do just that - capitalize on
                     this new and expanding technology.  In many cases,
                     people are getting their money's worth, but the
                     Internet is nobody's hobby, and it is naive not to
                     look for a gimmick in every box.

     SUMMARY:  Both these fine networks have been in existence for over ten
               years now.  Each has its strengths, and its weaknesses.  The
               fortunate part is that nobody has to make a choice over one
               of the other.  Both are available to the computer user with
               a modem and a phone line, and both have much to offer.  If
               you're presently using neither, you might like to check out
               the less expensive one first.  Free is always the least
               expensive, and that is Fidonet.  For the number of the
               fidonet bbs nearest you (there is likely one in your town,)
               consult your local computer outlet or computer paper.  For
               details on hooking up to the internet, consult your yellow
               pages.

     Beware the Ides of March...
     by Ken Reaverson, 1:133/1004 / ablood@juno.com

     You can tell the Ides are drawing near... the doomsayers are out in
     full force. :)

     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 10                  17 Mar 1997


     Hello, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Ken. I've only been a nodelisted
     sysop on Fido since the beginning of the year, but I've been
     lurking around for a few years. I could bore you with my struggles
     to obtain a node number, but I won't. ;)

     At any rate, I picked up a feed, and started paying attention to some
     of the sysop and adminstrative echoes.. and I've noticed alot of
     people a tad upset, or exasperated. I've listened to more than one
     sysop moan about how Fido is in it's death throes. I've read FidoNews
     and watch the amount of nodes drop. It kind of surprises me.

     My experiences on Fido have been varied over the years... my first
     impressions was a collection of people babbling on endlessly.
     Sometimes I'd find an echo I liked and spend some time posting, but
     then I'd start getting notices from the sysop saying that my account
     had expired, and that if I wanted to continue using their system, I
     had to pay them money. :) Like any headstrong sysop, I dropped the
     BBS from my dialing directory. :) I spend too much money on my own
     BBS, I'll be damned if I'm paying someone else to run theirs.

     Then I became a little more familiar with Fido-style networking in
     general, and alot of my complaints disappeared. I understood why
     sysops wanted money, because pulling in echomail and FDN's takes
     money. It was during this learning period that some Fido echoes
     became helpful to me, as some helpful people put up with a newcomers
     questions and made things a little clearer for me. My opinion of
     Fido started to change, I didn't automatically dismiss it as a gaggle
     of loudmouths. :)

     These days, I like Fido. It's an immensely helpful tool.. I get
     questions answered quickly, and completely. If it weren't for Fido,
     I wouldn't be able to provide my users with access to Internet email
     or USENET groups through the BBS.

     Today, my main impression of Fido is a mixed one. I've had fun, and
     there have been a few things that have ticked me off (the next time
     a moderator tells me to cut my two line sig down to one line because
     I'm wasting bandwidth, I'm going to scream. :) ), but it seems that
     there are two types of Fido-style people; those that sincerely care
     and try to help the network and other sysops, and those that are
     concerned with their own personal ambitions.

     I think I've been lucky. Since picking the net up in early January,
     I've run into mostly people of the first type... my RC, my nets
     NEC, and our new NC are all very dedicated and helpful people. One
     of the nodes acts as a UUCP gate free of charge to the nets members.
     If it weren't for these guys, I probably would have long since
     grown disgusted by some of the infighting I see.

     I can't understand why, when people like them are around, people
     are hearing FidoNet's death knell. The net's losing nodes. So what,
     BBS's are dropping like flies. :) It's not really a surprise.
     Eventually, the people that do care, and the people that are dedicated
     to the network will be the ones that are left, and I would hope that
     if anyone could turn the network around, it would be them.

     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 11                  17 Mar 1997


     I can't help but wonder if Fido would be in such 'dire straits' if
     the same people that are busy tolling the bell were busy working
     to make Fido a place that the vanishing sysops would want to stay.

     Lighten up guys. This is supposed to be a hobby, after all. :)

     Zone 2 Excommunicates Tom Jennings
     by Zorch Frezberg 1:205/1701

     The following nodelist segment was submitted to the International
     Nodelist by Z2C, Ward Dossche.

     It is confirmed in the ZONE2.LD3 "ZSeg" for the nodelist, available
     in the FDN titled ZSEGS.

     Please note...Ward Dossche has unilaterally removed Tom Jennings'
     name and copyright from Fido in Zone 2.

     While it did not go beyond the Zone 2 confines, it would seem that
     Ward is saying on behalf of Zone 2 Sysops that intellectual property
     rights can be confiscated at whim, since he has effectively stolen
     both the copyright and registered trademark which Tom Jennings has
     graciously allowed us to use without fees or royalties all these
     years.

     Is this a precursor to someone trying to take the copyright for
     their own, and start charging us those royalties they might feel
     that they deserve?

     Other than a single brief message, as of March 12, Ward has issued
     no other explanation than that he feels the new wording 'best
     reflects reality' as he sees it.

     Mind you, this is also the same man who wants to be your new
     International Coordinator.

     Think on it.

     The More Things Change, The More They Stay The Same
     by Zorch Frezberg, 1:205/1701

     Regional EchoMail Coordinators are the unwitting victims of a
     particularly nasty hoax...one that their innocent blindness
     is keeping them from seeing as it really is.

     Most of you have seen the message by now that the ZEC, Bruce Bodger,
     has mandated that your Region be consulted on whether or not he
     should retain his post as ZEC.

     What you may not realize is that the entire call for election is all
     a hoax, a blind, a cover for what is the true nature of the situation.

     You see, Bruce Bodger also holds the position of "Overseer of
     BackBone Operations", or OBO, a shadowy position that he created for
     himself and imposed on Fido when he, as Zone EchoMail Coordinator,
     revoked the prior BackBone Operations Policy (BOP).

     This BOFAQ, while holding no real authority or power under the
     FidoNet Policy, FidoNet Technical Standards, nor any accepted vote
     or consensus of FidoNet members or Coordinators, has been quietly
     implemented and accepted as the 'guiding authority' on how EchoMail
     is handled.

     Moreso when the person who created the OBO and OBOFAQ is himself the
     Zone EchoMail Coordinator, the highest authority on EchoMail issues
     in Zone 1.

     So long as the illusion of authority has been maintained, the
     illusion of real power to impose these "guidelines" has been observed
     in the EchoMail hierarchy, and so few OBO decisions have ever been
     challenged successfully.

     However, the latest copy of his replacement document, BOFAQ703.TXT,
     clearly shows that the OBO is not answerable to any authority in Fido
     or the EchoMail hierarchy.

     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 13                  17 Mar 1997


     Most of these same points have existed in previous versions, but that
     the ZEC is calling for the choice of either a 'vote of confidence' or
     an election to replace him makes it necessary to refer to the latest
     set of BOFAQ "guidelines".

     Please get a copy of BOFAQ703.TXT and look at the
     document...specifically, look at the "definitions" area for the
     details.

     {modified to fit FIDONEWS specs and extracted to specifics}

     > O.B.O. - Overseer of Backbone Operations - Person responsible for
     >          maintenance of this help file and its associated
     >          distribution documents.
     >          The position has customarily been occupied by the Zone 1

     >          American Backbone.

     Note the three elements...

          1) The OBO is responsible for the BOFAQ document.
          2) The OBO is responsible for *all* decisions on EchoMail
             distribution.

     and, most importantly,

          3) There is no *requirement* that the OBO be the ZEC.

     But, let's continue...

     > O.B.O. Council - A group of people representing the EchoMail
     >          interests of the Zone, assembled for the purpose of

     >          consists of the 10 Region EchoMail Coordinators.

     Please note...nowhere in this definition, indeed, in the entire BOFAQ
     document, is there any *requirement* that the OBO _act_ on any
     decisions of the OBO Council...even if it were to call for removal of
     the OBO.

     > Zone Echolist - As it relates to the Backbone, a database
     >          containing a list of echoes distributed by, or aspiring to
     >          be distributed by, the Backbone.  The format of this

     >          ZEC, however customarily contains echo names, moderator
     >          names and addresses, and descriptions of the echoes.

     Here we have a conundrum...which "ZEC" is being referred to in this
     definition?

     Traditionally, the handling of echoes being listed is the province of
     the Zone Echo_LIST_ Coordinator, while the Zone Echo_MAIL_
     Coordinator has been responsible for the smooth operation of the
     various BackBones in Zone 1, usually under the BackBone Operations
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 14                  17 Mar 1997


     Policy.

     Now, however, with the BOFAQ, these distinctions are blurred beyond
     any form of clarity.

     > Zone EchoList Coordinator - Person responsible for the maintenance
     >          and production of the Zone EchoList.

     Note the smooth but subtle difference...

     Currently, Bruce Bodger is the  Zone Echo_MAIL_ Coordinator...it's
     Adrian Walker who is the Zone Echo_LIST_ Coordinator.

     With this, the Zone Echo_MAIL_ Coordinator is effectively removed from
     having any authority whatsoever in BackBone operations.

     So how does this "authority" to perpetrate this hoax come about?

     It came about by the Regional EchoMAIL Coordinator Council failing to
     act a while back when the ZEC revoked the BOP.  Without any clear
     action by the REC Council, the BOFAQ was slipped into place despite
     individual protests from various sysops.

     As stated in the BOFAQ itself:

     > Q1 ================================================================
     > What is the purpose of this help file?
     >
     > This help file has been assembled as a means to provide answers to

     "...how the BackBone operates..."

     "...an insight into its internal administration."

     These are comments which clearly indicate that while there is some
     formal set of rules to its operations, that same set of rules and/or
     agreements is not to be made available to the public.

     Moreover, the subtlety of the separation of power between the OBO and
     the ZEC becomes even more apparent as you read the BOFAQ:

     Seems that the OBO carries more weight and authority than either the
     Zone EchoMAIL or the Zone EchoLIST Coordinators...

     Most important of all, however, is that the OBO is a self-reliant
     entity, requiring and recognizing no other authority than itself.

     I would strongly urge that the Regional EchoMail Coordinator Council
     consider these words and information before allowing this hoax to
     continue.

     If it is the will of the REC Council to call for an election to
     replace Bruce Bodger as Zone EchoMail Coordinator, then it would
     seem to be best for them to see how far down they'll need to dig to
     uproot him from that post.

                                    A Proposal for
                              Passing Domain Information
                              During an FTS-0006 Session

                                          by

     FSC-0045 proposes a method for sending five dimensional FidoNet
     addresses (ie, zone:net/node.point@domain) via the type 2 packet
     header.  This document describes a proposed method for sending the
     same five dimensional address in the Hello packet of an FTS-0006
     session, with the additional advantage of being able to utilize the
     full Internet recognized domain name for various Fidonet technology
     networks.  This proposal, combined with FSC-0045 will help to solve
     one of FidoNet's most pressing problems: How to recognize alternative
     networks without the need of some centralized management looking at
     all of them and what they are doing with Zone numbers, etc.  Like FSC-
     0045, this proposal remains backwards compatible with what it is
     replacing.

     Currently FTS-0006 has provisions for zone, net, node, and point
     information to be passed in the Hello packet.  To extend this to allow
     the domain name to be passed, an extra capability bit is used.  This
     bit corresponds to the 0x4000 bit, and will be called the DO_DOMAIN
     bit.  If this bit is set, it means that the sender is domain aware,
     and has enclosed his domain in the Hello packet.  The domain is stored
     in the system name field, after the null that terminates the real
     system name.  The system name field is a maximum of 60 characters, so
     the sender must make the real system name, a null, the domain name,
     and another null byte fit within the 60 bytes.  The domain will start
     at the byte immediately after the first null byte.  The domain is
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 19                  17 Mar 1997


     arbitrary length and should correspond to the Internet assigned domain
     name.  This is NOT the same as the FSC-0045 domain, and therefore
     there needs to be a mapping between real Internet domains, and the
     FSC-0045 style domain name, if FSC-0045 is accepted by the FTSC as a
     standard for use by all mailers.  This mapping is normally
     straightforward (for example, Internet fidonet.org would correspond to
     FSC-0045 domain FidoNet).  Since most alternative nets do not have a
     registered Internet domain, the naming convention should be "known by"
     domain (ie, FSC-0045 domain name) followed by .ftn (for FidoNet
     Technology Network).  So, the FSC-0045 domain "Alternet" would be
     converted to alternet.ftn under this proposal.  This allows domains
     which are not normally FidoNet aware to use FTS-0006 to talk to
     FidoNet technology mail programs.  For example, a mailer located at
     Camex in Manchester, NH might send it's mail as 'man.camex.com' during
     an FTS-0006 session.  When parsing the domain name, the parsing should
     try to match the domain from right to left (Internet naming is
     hierarchical from right to left), so that if a mailer knew about
     man.camex.com, that could also match something of the form
     super.machine.silly.name.man.camex.com.  The domain name should be
     case INSENSITIVE, and the FSC-0045 abbreviation of it should be unique
     within the first 8 characters, and also should not include any periods
     ('.') or at-signs ('@') since those characters are significant in the
     Internet domain naming scheme.

     In order for this proposal to be adopted, the FTSC would have to
     assign the DO_DOMAIN bit, and have it documented in FTS-0006.  This
     method is fully backwards compatible, since a domain aware mailer
     could send the domain information, and if the other end was not domain
     aware, it would ignore it.  If the other end was domain aware, it
     would be able to extract the domain information easily and would then
     have a full five dimensional address available for the sender.  This
     proposal remains fully backward compatible with the current uses of
     all FTS-0006 fields, and should not affect operation of any mailer
     that has used reserved bytes in the Hello packet.

        Purpose

             This document should serve as a guide for the character set
             identifier, CHARSET hereafter, format for FidoNet message
             Editors.  The purpose behind CHARSET is related to my attempt
             to make it easier for each reader of a FidoNet message to
             identify the characters used in the messages.

             Since FidoNet messages aren't restricted to use any special
             character sets in the messages, there will be differences
             between computer kinds and special country dependent
             characters. To avoid confusion in such cases, I'm hereby
             introducing the CHARSET kludge.

             There is no need that each FidoNet Message reader should be
             able to understand every possible character set. If the reader
             can't handle the special character set found in a message,
             then it should use a default character set (as most readers do
             today).

        Format

             ^aCHARSET: <Character set identifier>

        Sample

             ^aCHARSET: ISO-11

             Would identify that the message is written using the ISO-11
             character set, which relates to the character set mainly used
             in Sweden.

        Supported character sets

             No special character set is specified, but it is recomended to
             use the ISO numbering of the different character sets. Where
             no ISO number is available, an easy to understand code should
             by used.

        Character set identifier examples

             ISO-6       Relates to plain ASCII 7 bit character set.
             ISO-11      Swedish character set, 7 bit.
             ISO-21      Germany character set, 7 bit.
             ISO-69      French character set, 7 bit.

             Other character set identifiers could be
             PC-8        IBM PC complete character set.
             ATARI       ATARI ST complete character set
             AMIGA       AMIGA complete character set

     Introduction

          This document proposes a method for transferring characters,
          including accented and otherwisely special  ones, in ordinary
          FidoNet  messages, and is the result of some of the thougts put
          forward in the discussion of foreign characters at TechCon  I, as
          well as extensive discussions in the Swedish equivalent of
          NET_DEV.

          The proposed standard will allow for the transmission of all
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 22                  17 Mar 1997


          variants of  letters  in  the  latin  alphabet,  as  well  as
          several special characters  commonly  used.  At  the  same  time
          the standard  makes inclusion of additional characters painless.
          The standard implements a way of  automatically displaying  these
          characters  as resemblingly as possible on systems that doesn't
          yet support them, using the  built-in fallback method described
          in this document.

          One main  advantage of  this standard  is that  even though  it
          uses a well-spread character set as its base, it is not limited
          to that  set.  It is therefore possible to include as many
          characters as needed.  The only restriction is that the
          additional characters implemented should be based on the Latin
          alphabet.

     How does it work?

          The base character set used  in this standard is ISO  8859-1,
          commonly known as 'ISO Latin-1'.  All  characters present in that
          set are  used as is. The advantages of this  character set are
          well known, and will not be discussed in this document. However,
          the most obvious advantage of Latin-1 is that characters can be
          easily case shifted.

          All accented and  special characters not  present in the  base
          set are considered 'extra'  characters, and  are obtained  by
          using  a form of character combination.   To let  message editors
          etc.   know when  to combine characters,  and when  not to,  all
          combination sequences are preceded by a  special 'escape'
          character.   This escape character  is 0x02, ie. ^B (STX).

     Advantages and problems

          A system that strips eight  bit characters when displaying them
          is no problem,  since  it  doesn't  support  this  proposed
          standard at this moment. When eventually doing so (which I hope
          most systems will), the hi-bit characters are treated as they
          should.

          A system  that treats  eight bit  characters as  other characters
          will give the effect  that extra characters  transmitted with the
          proposed method look strange if the system isn't supporting this
          method.

            * The method will never break anything fully FTS-compliant.

            * It will give strange characters on systems that don't support
              this method, but that is not worse than the current
              situation.

            * It  will  give  systems  supporting  this  method  the
              ability to transfer national, accented and  special
              characters to systems  on other computer platforms (ie. the
              characters look the same on a PC and a Macintosh).

              computers that don't  have the  ability to  display certain
              characters will automatically show the most resembling
              character the computer  can provide, if the character in
              question is one of the extended ones.  For the 96 hi-bit
              characters developers hopefully will include the needed
              translation tables  in their programs.  Such tables can  be
              provided upon request.

            * Conferences  on  FidoNet  in  English will be  minimally
              affected, since the English language seldom uses other
              characters than those in  pure  ASCII.  The  possibility  to
              use  other characters will however be present, if  needed.
              Those that frequently use special characters will benefit a
              lot, without causing trouble  for those that don't.

            * In fact, the minimum requirement to be I51-compatible is that
              your system can handle Latin-1 codes, plus the I51 fallback.
              When  the base set of I51 (ie. Latin-1) is implemented, you
              can obtain  full I51 compliance by  just adding I51
              fallback. After that,  you can choose which ones of the I51
              extra characters to implement, if any at all. The automatic
              fall-back system takes care of the rest for you! The
              additional work  to get  a  Latin-1 compatible system to
              fully support I51 is indeed negligable.

     Technical description

          The format of a representation of an extra character is as
          follows:

     <escape character><modifier><base character>

          I will be  using 0x02 as  escape character in  the examples
          below.  It will however be represented with a '.', since it is
          non-printable.

       Examples:

          02 2d 7e (.-~) will display as an about equals sign ('').

          02 50 74 (.$P) is used to represent a peseta symbol ('').

          02  02  represents  a  single  02,  if  that  code ever is needed
          in a message. I propose that the use of 0x02 in messages for
          other  reasons than in this method of character transmission
          should be prohibited.

     The fallback method of displaying an extra character

          If  the  system  where  you  are  implementing  this method of
          special character transmission doesn't support a certain extra
          character,  the following procedure should be used. To display a
          special character  as resemblingly as possible, just skip the
          modifier! Ie. the sequence  02 67 6a  (.ga) is  displayed as
          'a', 02  5e 73  as 's'. It is therefore preferred  that  the
          FTSC  in  assigning  sequences to any additional characters take

          this into account.

     How to use I51 in mail

          In transit  mail in  I51 format  _must_ be  passed on  un-
          altered, per FTS-0001. However,  it is  possible to  store
          messages  locally in any desired format. As long as  the BBS
          programs doesn't have  options for users to change their
          character setup and representation, this may  be desirable.

          The I51 method of representing  special characters is also
          allowed  in headers of messages,  if account is  taken to the
          fact that the extra characters occupy more bytes  than the
          'normal' characters.

          Since the  character codes  0x80 -  0x9f are  undefined in ISO
          8859-1, their  presence  in  an  I51  message  is  prohibited,
          if not defined in an FTS document (eg. 'soft CR').

          Here is some sample C code. The first function combines sequences
          into their proper representation  in IBM PC  codepage 437, the
          second does the reverse, ie. converts characters not found in the
          I51 base set  to their combination sequences.

           The code neccessary to translate between I51 hibit characters
           and any ordinary 8 bit character  set is trivial and  left as an
           exercise  to the reader..:-)
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 29                  17 Mar 1997


     Appendix D - Comments on the base set

          It is of  course possible to  use any character  set as the  base
          set, even pure 7-bit ASCII. Earlier revisions of this standard
          were in fact based on ASCII. But, the usage  of ASCII as the base
          set  will require all non-ascii characters  to be encoded.   That
          would cause  a lot  of unneccessary  trouble  for  almost  all
          foreign languages, and is not desirable. No one would want all
          'strange' characters of his  language to be encoded, just because
          'we  can't use 8 bits'. Mail sessions are conducted in 8 bit,
          packets contain 8 bit data - so we can.

          Then, of course, it is unwise not to use an 8 bit set as the base
          set, since it will  save a lot  of space compared  to a 7  bit
          set, not  to mention a lot of  trouble. It is my  belief that
          among 8  bit sets ISO 8859-1 is the most well-spread  and common
          around, and that  qualifies it to be the proposed base set of
          this standard.

     Appendix E - Comments on the escape character

          The escape character  can in fact  be almost any  character, if
          proper measurements are  taken to  make the  ordinary use  for
          the  character chosen possible at  the same time.  To avoid too
          much trouble, it  is wise to  select a  character seldom  found
          in  mail. 0x01  would be  a perfect escape character, were it not
          for the fact that it is  already used for  other purposes.  The
          next  character, however,  is currently unused. I therefore felt
          it wise  to use 0x02 as the escape  character in this standard.
          There are  several advantages related to the use of this
          character  as the  escape character.  There are  of course  other
          characters (eg.  '\' or '~') that could be used, but there are
          reasons not to use  them.  '\',  for instance, is commonly used
          in  Europe to represent a national character, and is therefore
          not well suited.  The '~' on  the other  hand is not often  used,
          but  can't be  used as an escape character  due to  the fact
          that it  itself is  an accent (see below).

     Appendix F - During the change to I51, co-existence with other methods

          Any message  in which  the I51  standard is  used (whether  with
          extra codes present or not) will, during a limited period of
          time, have  the following kludge line in it:

     ^AI51<cr>

          With this kludge line present, a message editor at once will know
          that a certain message should be 'de-I51-ified'. How to interpret
          messages lacking  this line is upon you decide. However, should
          you find a 0x02 in a message lacking the kludge line, the message
          is to be considered an I51 message.

          When a non-I51 message is quoted, its contents should be
          translated to the corresponding I51 codes, if possible.
          Characters not found in  the I51 standard (as defined in this
          document) are to be ignored, unless a similar I51 representation

          can be found.

     Appendix G - Comments to the author

          Please feel free to contact me on 2:200/108 if you have any
          questions, comments or suggestions regarding this document, or
          anything associated with it.  I appreciate any suggestions on
          additional 'extra' characters to be added to this standard.

     The below message was posted to all the RECs this morning.  Please be
     sure to let your REC know your opinion on this question.  Please
     discuss in your respective Region echos.

     Thank you..

             Subj: POLL YOUR REGIONS
     ======================================================================
     This message is to be posted in your Region's Admin. echo(s).

     I was elected as your ZEC on October 28, 1994 to serve a two year
     term.  Im a little over 4 months late in conducting another election
     or affirmation of the position.  You have my apologies.

     I want the RECs to conduct a survey of their respective Regions to
     determine if they, the Regions, would prefer either another election
     being conducted or an affirmation and acceptance of my willingness to
     serve another term.

     I am allowing at least 2 weeks for the RECs to get back to me with one
     of the following choices only;

     My Region would like an election to be conducted =or=
     My Region would like you to stay on for another term.

     The choice that each REC returns must be based on input from within
     their Region.  Each REC must do his/her best to make the discussion
     public within their Region by, at least, posting a copy of this
     FIDONEWS 14-11               Page 33                  17 Mar 1997


     message in their Region's admin. echo(s).

     I am setting March 24 as the target date for replies but use whatever
     time is necessary to ensure that your Region has had time to discuss
     this issue. I will NOT accept input from any REC that does not confer
     with their Region.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     All right, I admit it. I've been slacking off. I didn't get anything
     done this week. Sigh.

     The good news is that the old info section is down to under 40
     percent, so we're seeing some real progress there.

     Phased out this week: "OS/2 Systems" Section

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: "Amiga" Section
             Deadline for info: 14 Mar 1997.
       Last week: "Atari ST/TT" Section
             Deadline for info: 7 Mar 1997.
