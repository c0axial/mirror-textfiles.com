     =================================================================


     The second FidoNet Technical Standard appears today. FTS-0004 was
     lifted from the docs of ConfMail by Bob Hartman in the dim time of
     Echomail operations.

     FTS-0004 has a counter-point in FSC-0074 [which is way down the list
     for numerical publication in these spaces], the proposal for a new
     Echomail spec.

     Anticipating the FTS-0004 publication today, I have also received an
     adjusted version of FSC-0074 which also appears in this Issue. It
     should make an interesting comparison for those of you technically
     inclined.

     Next week's Headline was the first and only entry to-date in the
     Headline submission contest posed as a Question of the Week a couple
     Issues back. You'll have to ask the submitter [Damian Walker of
     2:2502/666] what it means or pertains to, however. I haven't got a
     clue. [grin]

     Everything in Moderation
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     With all this talk of echo policy which is flying around echoes and
     Fidonews itself, one of the subjects at the centre of conversation is,
     once again, echo moderators.  These people are often the object of
     controversy in Fidonet.  Who are they?  What do they do?  What should
     they do?  Who gives them the right to tell me what to do?!
         When conversation does come around to moderators, it usually
     orbits even more closely closely around the matter of feed cuts.  But
     why should it?  Feed cuts are not the only thing a moderator can do
     with their echo.
         In this article, I will take a look at some of the duties of
     moderators, some of the issues generating criticism levelled at them,
     and suggest for those who are interested what more a moderator can do
     for his or her echo.

     So, first of all, what is a moderator?  Most people who know enough
     about Fidonet to find this copy of Fidonews probably already know what
     a moderator is.  The moderator, in general terms, is someone who takes
     the responsibility of making sure a particular echo maintains the
     purpose for which the echo was originally set up.
         This 'purpose' could cover a lot of things.  Usually the most
     important is the topic, or subject, of the echo.  Then comes its
     intended readership, as an echo should allow (or restrict) access to a
     certain group of people, whether this is 'sysops', 'everyone' or some
     other criterion.  The other one which springs to mind from my own
     echoes is 'atmosphere'.  Is it supposed to be a friendly, chatty echo?
     Or perhaps something more efficient and businesslike, particularly
     where the echo set up to get a job done, rather than existing solely
     for the amusement of its readers.  There could be other aspects to the
     echo's purpose.
         As an aside, some people question the need for echo moderators.
     After all, many Internet newsgroups manage without them.  Or do they?
     Another school of thought suggests that a lot of the meaningless noise
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 3                   11 Nov 1996


     in newsgroups (which I have witnessed in some newsgroups myself) comes
     about because there is no-one to oversee the newsgroup in the way that
     a moderator does in Fidonet.  It seems there may be a place for both
     moderated and unmoderated echoes, after all.  But back to the topic in
     hand...
         So how should the echo purpose be maintained?  This varies from
     one echo to another, and there may be more than just one simple way to
     do the job, a fact that creates much of the controversy centred around
     moderators.
         The policies or requirements for some backbone structures state
     explicitly what a moderator's duties should be, and make suggestions
     or restrictions on how they should be carried out.  Such policies
     often try to achieve a balance between absolute control for the
     moderator, and some form of comeback to protect genuine users from the
     effects of the overly dictatorial moderators who sometimes appear.
         Even then, the subject of such policies often settles immovably
     upon the question of unruly users and feed cuts.  Where are the more
     positive aspects of moderation?  Even if these should not be
     regulated, the lack of suggestions might put the new or less
     experienced moderator at a loss for ideas.

     In practice, moderators often exercise some of both the positive and
     negative aspects of moderation, although the balance is not consistent
     from one moderator to the next.  Even among echoes moderated by a
     single person, the balance may not be the same.
         Firstly, what about the negative aspects of moderation?  The
     rules, the warnings, the feed cuts?  The first is hardly something
     which can be regulated, and it is difficult even to advise upon, given
     the wide range of purposes an echo may have.  Usually, a moderator
     will use the rules of another echo they enjoy reading as a guideline
     for their own echo.  Sometimes this is a good move, and sometimes it
     isn't.  Many moderators adjust the rules as they find things which are
     undesirable or unenforceable.
         The issue of warnings is clear cut in many policies.  A recurring
     theme is the requirement for three formal warnings before a feed cut
     can be made.  Personally, I prefer not to give formal warnings, since
     these may alienate genuine users who have simply made a mistake in a
     friendly conference, but this is just a personal issue.  Some
     moderators stick rigidly to the formal warning principle, where others
     might try other methods such as making polite requests to stay on
     topic or civil.  One such moderator in an echo I used to read would
     also suggest echoes in which off-topic messages might be appropriate;
     such a helpful approach maintained a friendly atmosphere, even when
     he was giving as many 'warnings' as in some less friendly echoes.
         The final negative issue, that of feed cuts, is regularly the
     object of moderator-related controversy.  Although a good moderator
     (or a moderator with an easy job) might have to make few of these,
     discussion about them takes up far more bandwidth than their frequency
     would suggest.  There are a number of ways feed cuts may be
     implemented.  A request to the user to stop writing is rarely going to
     work.  A request to the sysop of the offending user is one approach,
     although many sysops will want more than a simple request before
     cutting a feed.  Some will insist on the mandatory three warnings,
     others will be less rigid, but still want to see evidence of
     misbehaviour. Another approach sometimes used is to make a demand to
     the sysop for a feed cut, backed up by a backbone policy, but such an
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 4                   11 Nov 1996


     unfriendly way of doing things may work against the moderator,
     particularly when the fact that they are backed up by policy is open
     to interpretation.
         But now I've given these negative aspects of moderator duties more
     time than I wanted to, so lets move on to the more positive aspects of
     moderating echoes.  What do moderators currently do?
         Firstly, the moderator is frequently the person who sets up an
     echo. This may be more work than it at first appears, depending upon
     the requirements of a local backbone or other distribution system.
     Some need a minimum traffic level, others have requirements upon
     existing distribution (e.g. the echo must be distributed to at least 3
     nets). Some are more lucky, in my native region 25 all we have to do
     is send a copy of the echo rules (and the echo tag, description and
     moderator name/address) to our REC to get an echo on the regional
     backbone.  But once an echo is on the backbone, or even beforehand,
     there are other things to be done.
         Most of this is down to promotion.  The simplest way to promote an
     echo is to advertise it, particularly in other echoes which are set up
     for such advertising.  This is the approach most often used in my own
     locality, with the ECHO-NEWS conference specifically set up for
     moderators (or other parties) to gain support for echoes.  There are
     similar echoes available in some, but not all, parts of the network.
         An alternative way to advertise an echo is by including a bulletin
     on your own (or your sysop's) BBS, directing users to the echo.  This
     is of more use on specialist BBS's, where an echo pertaining to that
     system's subject is more likely to attract users.
         Another common way of promoting echoes is to stimulate discussion
     within the echo itself.  Once advertising has attracted a user to an
     echo, there should be something to read once they get there, or the
     user will just assume the echo is dead, and not give it a second look.
         There are a number of approaches to this.  One is to forward
     information from other sources, such as books and magazines, other
     echoes, or conferences on different networks such as Compuserve or the
     Internet.  Where direct crossposting is legal, it may be used in order
     to make the echo a good source of real information (as opposed to
     discussion on information available elsewhere).
         Another approach applicable to some echoes is merely to post large
     numbers of messages as and when inspiration occurs.  My own approach
     is to try and post at least one message a day, a thread starter, in
     order to get people talking.  This is especially useful when echo
     traffic drops off, and could even be a necessary procedure on
     backbones which require echoes to maintain a minimum amount of
     traffic.  Sometimes I have no personal interest in the questions I
     ask in my own echoes, but hope that somebody else does.

     There are some less common activities a moderator can do in order to
     maintain the echo purpose (the purpose being something which should
     always be borne in mind by moderators going about their moderatorial
     duties-- forget politics or ego here).  I will draw these from my own
     echoes and some of the other echoes I have participated in or read
     about.
         As for promotion, dare I raise the subject of document servers yet
     again?  Yes, of course I dare, since these are a good way of
     distributing information about an echo, particularly more detailed
     information which is not appropriate for a general echo advertising
     conference or a log-on BBS bulletin.  These can be particularly useful
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 5                   11 Nov 1996


     for directing users to related echoes as well.
         Within the echo, there are some things which can maintain users'
     interest.  One which I have seen in an echo is a directory of echo
     users, users being added either with their permission or by using
     information sent by themselves.  Either way prevents users appearing
     in a directory when they don't want their name listed.  It may be
     interesting to offer this list externally (by FReq or netmail) as well
     as by regular post in the echo.
         A few echoes offer an echo-related file list.  One echo I know of
     does this by gathering the files on one system, and maintaining mirror
     sites. One of my own echoes has a FReq list, which contains files
     available on all participating systems from which the sysop is
     prepared to send me their file list.  These files are obviously
     restricted to those relevant to the echo, and the list contains by
     each file the address of the system which offers holds it.  This
     prevents the expense of sending a large volume of files to mirror
     sites, but requires that the user call direct to the system offering
     the file they want.  Broadly similar to this is the common procedure
     of allowing systems to post a new files list into the echo, for areas
     pertaining to the echo subject.
         Another idea is to offer some sort of brief journal or electronic
     magazine for echo users.  A vast array of ideas for the content of
     this journal can be created by the imaginative mind, or it could
     merely be a collection of material related to other ideas already
     given, such as file lists, information and news from external sources,
     echo user directories, or just about anything related to the echo
     topic.
         Where echoes of limited distribution exist, or similar echoes in
     different languages, links could be established for the sharing of
     information and news.  This is especially useful where international
     links for an echo itself cannot be found.  Given suitable software at
     two designated systems, selected messages and announcments could be
     sent between the echoes via netmail, to be automatically posted as an
     echomail message.  Obviously this should only be used for a limited
     amount of traffic in order that uplinks are not annoyed with excessive
     traffic in netmail.
         Some of these less widespread activities could be conducted by
     echo participants other than the moderator, but in most cases it is up
     to the moderator to instigate them, or to specifically designate
     someone else to do the job, or just to make it known that they would
     be welcome in the echo.

     Most of the material here I have written in order to highlight the
     lighter side of what moderating an echo is all about, or what it could
     be about if moderators are willing, and hopefully I have managed to
     convince someone of the fact that there is more to moderating echomail
     than warnings and feed cuts.
         Such considerations should not be forgotten when formulating a
     policy for an echomail distribution system such as an official or
     unofficial backbone, a large-scale cost share scheme or an entirely
     separate network.  It is important not only that rules and regulations
     do not restrain moderators and users from making the most of their
     echoes, but also that the incentive is there for people to put the
     effort in to implement some of the more interesting ideas for
     attracting and retaining users in our echoes.

     FTS-0004 documents a fish more than it does Echomail...
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindnes@csl.co.uk

     In this issue of Fidonews Chris will be posting FTS-0004, the
     document that specifies Echomail. It is the FTSC's statement that
     they only document current practise - read thru FTS-0004 and my
     comments on it last week and you'll see this simply isn't true.  The
     worse thing is that the FTSC were submitted a proposed replacement
     for fts-0004 (fsc-0074) by John Souvestre and in their great wisdom
     not only altered the document before accepting it as an FSC but also
     didn't replace fts-0004 with it. I mean, look at fts-0004 it isn't
     even a technical document!

     I have included a recent draft i have made of fsc-0074 below.
     Additions and changes from the current fsc-0074 are marked by a '|'
     in the first column. Deletions from the current version are discussed
     after the document.

       EchoMail is a technique that permits several nodes on a network to
       share a message base. It is similar in concept to the conferences
       available on commercial information services but is most closely
       related to the Usenet system consisting of thousands of systems
       world wide.  All systems sharing a given conference see any messages
       entered into the conference by any of the participating systems.
       This can be implemented in such a way as to be totally transparent
       to the users of a particular system.  In fact, they may not even be
       aware of the network being used to move their messages about from
       node to node!

       Unfortunately, EchoMail has disadvantages as well.  Many users who
       are not educated about EchoMail systems do not realize the messages
       transmitted cost MANY sysops (system operators) money, not just the
       local sysop.  This is an important consideration in EchoMail and
       should not be taken lightly.  In a conference with 100 systems
       participating the cost per message can be quite high.


                         BRIEF HISTORY OF ECHOMAIL

       In late 1985, Jeff Rush, a Fido sysop in Dallas, wanted a convenient
       means of sharing ideas with the other Dallas sysops.  He created a
       system of programs he called Echomail, and the Dallas sysops'
       Conference was born.

       Within a short time sysops in other areas began hearing of this
       marvelous new gadget and EchoMail took on a life of its own.  Today
       the FidoNet public network boasts a myriad of conferences varying in
       size from a handful of participants to Sysop conferences with
       hundreds of participants.  It is not uncommon for a system to carry
       hundreds or more conferences and share those conferences with 10 or
       more nodes.


                             HOW ECHOMAIL WORKS

       Today's EchoMail processing is functionally compatible with the
       original EchoMail utilities.  In general, the process is:

         -  A message is entered into a designated area on a FidoNet
            compatible system.

         -  This message is "Exported" along with some 'control
            information' to each system "linked" to the conference
            through the originating system.

         -  Each receiving system "Imports" the message into the
            proper Conference Mail area.

         -  The receiving systems then "Export" these messages, along
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 8                   11 Nov 1996


            with additional control information, to each of their own
            EchoMail links.

         -  Return to the import step.

       The method is quite simple in general.  Of course, following the
       steps literally means messages would never stop being Exported and
       transmitted to other systems.  This obviously would not be desired.
       The information contained in the 'control information' section is
       used to prevent exporting the same message more than once to a
       single system.


                        MESSAGE CONTROL INFORMATION

       Control information is associated with each EchoMail message.  This
       information consists of certain special lines placed inside the
       message.  These lines are typically inserted automatically by the
       program which prepares or processes the message, not by the person
       writing it.

       In FTS-0001 terminology, these control information lines shall
       be inside the "text" field of a "packed message".

       Control information lines shall contain only ASCII characters, from
       32 to 126, except the first character of the path line and as noted
       elsewhere in this document.  This limitation applies only to control
       information lines.

       Alphabetic characters in required literal strings (AREA, Origin,
       SEEN-BY, and PATH) are case-sensitive.

       All control information lines shall be terminated with ASCII
       character 13 (carriage return).

       These required control information lines determine how EchoMail is
       handled:

     | The origin line, seenby and path are generated in that order, with
     | no other control information intermingled.


       1. Area line

       There shall be exactly one area line in an exported message.
       The AREA line:

         -  Shall be the first line of the text and thus shall
            immediately follow the packed message header.  This
            position is "offset 0" of the "text" portion of the
            packed message.

         -  Shall be formatted as:

                 AREA:CONFERENCE

     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 9                   11 Nov 1996


                 AREA: is a required five character upper case
                 literal.

     |           There is NO space between AREA: and CONFERENCE

                 CONFERENCE is the name of the conference. The
                 conference name is composed of ASCII characters in
                 the range 33 to 96 and 123 to 126.  The conference
                 name shall be no more than 60 characters in length.

       The AREA line is added when a conference is "Exported" to
     | other systems.  It is usually based upon information found
       in a configuration file for the designated message area. This
       field is used by receiving systems to "Import" messages into
       the correct EchoMail area.

       Some implementations insert a Ctrl-A (0x01) immediately
     | preceding the AREA: literal (^AAREA:CONFERENCE). This is broken
     | behavior but should be handled, but never created. A warning
     | message to the node who created the message can, optionally,
     | be sent.


       2. Origin Line

       There shall be exactly one origin line in a message.  It shall
     | be placed in the message directly after the user text and
     | immediately before the remaining control information lines.

       The origin line:

         -  Shall begin with the eleven character literal:

                 <space>*<space>Origin:<space>

         -  Is optionally followed by user/system defined data in the
            ASCII range 32 to 126.

         -  Shall end with a FidoNet network address enclosed in
            parenthesis:

                 ([<zone>:]<net>/<node>[.<point>][@<domain>])

         -  Shall be no more than 79 characters long including the
            required lead-in and address information.

         -  Shall be inserted into the message at the originating
            system.

       The complete line might look like:

                 * Origin: Conference Mail BBS (1:132/101)


       3. Seen-by Lines

     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 10                  11 Nov 1996


       Seen-by lines are the focus of EchoMail distribution control
       information.  They are used to determine which addresses (systems)
       have received messages.  There can be as many seen-by lines as
       required to store the necessary information.

       Seen-by lines consist of "SEEN-BY:<space>", followed by a list of
       net/node numbers corresponding to the systems which have received
       that message.  The net/node number of each system to which a message
       is exported is added to the seen-by lines at the time of export.

       There shall be exactly one set of seen-by lines in a message.
       Seen-by lines:

         -  Shall follow the origin line.

         -  Shall begin with the nine character literal:

                 SEEN-BY:<space>

         -  Shall contain a list of net/node numbers.

         -  Shall be no more than 80 characters long including the
            required literal.

       The complete lines might look like:

                 SEEN-BY: 104/1 501 132/101 113 136/601 1014/1
                 SEEN-BY: 1014/2 3

       The list of net/node numbers:

         -  Shall identify at least one address. "Blank" seen-by
            lines shall not be transmitted.

         -  Shall be sorted in ascending net/node order.

         -  Shall not contain repeated node numbers.

         -  Shall use only "2D" net/node notation.

     |   -  Shall be stripped at zone gates (since the data is 2D).
     |      In essence when a system imports an echo from a system
     |      in another zone it will dispose of all SEEN-BY lines
     |      in the message and replace it with a single SEEN-BY
     |      that contains their net/node.

         -  May use short form address notation where a net number is
            listed once on any one line.  These 2 lines are
            equivalent:

                 SEEN-BY: 104/1 104/501 132/101 132/113 136/601
                 SEEN-BY: 104/1 501 132/101 113 136/601

     |      The first entry in a line must be full net/node.

       Some implementations insert a Ctrl-A (0x01) immediately
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 11                  11 Nov 1996


     | preceding the SEEN-BY: literal (^ASEEN-BY:). This is broken
     | behavior but should be handled, but never created. A warning
     | message to the node who created the message can, optionally,
     | be sent.


       4. Path Lines

       Path lines identify a list of net/node numbers that processed a
       message before it reached the current system.  There can be as many
       path lines as required to store the necessary information.

       This is different from seen-by lines, in that seen-by lines list
       list all systems to which the message has been sent while path lines
       list the systems which have processed the message.

       There shall be exactly one set of path lines in a message.
       Path lines:

         -  Shall follow seen-by lines.

         -  Shall be the last line(s) in the text field of a packed
            message.

         -  Shall begin with the seven character literal:

                 ^APATH:<space>

            The ^A is a special character which stands for Control-A
            (ASCII character 1), and is required at the beginning of
            each path line.

         -  Shall contain a list of net/node numbers.

         -  Shall be no more than 80 characters long including the
            required literal.

       The complete path line might look like:

                 ^APATH: 132/101 1014/1

       The list of net/node numbers:

         -  Shall identify at least one net/node number.  "Blank"
            path lines shall not be transmitted.

         -  Shall not be sorted.  They shall remain in the order
            representing the actual "path" along which the message
            traveled.

         -  Shall use only "2D" net/node notation.

         -  Shall begin with the net/node of the originating system.

         -  Shall not be deleted during processing.  The original
            path information shall be maintained from origin to final

            destination.


                             ECHOMAIL TOPOLOGY

       The way in which systems link together for a particular conference
       is called the "EchoMail Topology."  It is important to know this
       structure for two reasons:

         -  It is important to have a topology which is efficient in
            the transfer of the EchoMail messages.

         -  It is important to have a topology which will not cause
            systems to see the same messages more than once.

       Efficiency can be measured in a number of ways:

         -  Least time involved for all systems to receive a message

         -  Least cost for all systems to receive a message

         -  Fewest phone calls required for all systems to receive a
            message.

       Users of EchoMail systems have determined (through trial and error)
       the best measure of efficiency to be a combination of all three
       measurements.  Balancing the equation is not trivial, but some
       guidelines can be offered:

         -  Have nodes form "stars" for distribution of EchoMail.
            This arrangement has several nodes all receiving their
            EchoMail from the same system.  In general the systems on
            the "outside" of the star poll the system on the
            "inside".  The system on the "inside" in turn polls other
            systems in a similar star configuration to receive the
            EchoMail that is being passed on to the "outside"
            systems.

         -  Utilize fully connected polygons with few vertices.
            Nodes can be connected in a triangle (A sends to B and C,
            B sends to A and C, C sends to A and B) or a fully
            connected square (all corners of the square send to all
            of the other corners).  This method is useful for getting
            EchoMail messages to each node as quickly as possible.

       All of these efficiency guidelines have to be tempered with the
       guidelines dealing with keeping duplicate messages from being
       exported.  Duplicates will occur in any topology that forms a closed
       polygon that is not fully connected.  Take for example the following
       configuration:

                 A ----- B
                 |       |
                 |       |
                 C ----- D

     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 13                  11 Nov 1996


       This square is a closed polygon that is not fully connected.
       It is capable of generating duplicates:

         1. A message is entered on node A.

         2. Node A exports the message to node B and node C placing
            the seen-by for A, B, and C in the message as it does so.

         3. Node B sees that node D is not listed in the seen-by and
            exports the message to node D.

         4. Node C sees that node D is not listed in the seen-by and
            exports the message to node D.

       At this point node D has received the same message twice - a
       duplicate was generated.

       Normally a "dup-ring" will not be as simple as a square.  Generally
       it will be caused by a system on one end of a long chain
       accidentally connecting to a system on the other end of the chain.
       This causes the two ends of the chain to become connected, forming a
       polygon.

       In FidoNet this problem is reduced somewhat by having a regional
       EchoMail star distribution architecture that maintains EchoMail
       connections within regions of the world.  Within that architecture
       only a small number of prearranged systems (regional collection
       systems) make inter-regional connections.  This architecture, along
       with multiple daily connections, results in an efficient topology
       which typically allows global distribution within 24 hours.


                         THE PATH LINE AND TOPOLOGY

       The PATH line stores the net/node numbers of each system having
       actually processed a message.  This information is useful in
       correcting the biggest problem encountered by nodes running an
       Echomail compatible system - the problem of finding the cause of
       duplicate messages.  How does the PATH line help solve this problem?
       Take the following path line as an example:

                 ^APATH: 107/6 107/312 132/101

       This shows that the message was processed by system 107/6 and
       transferred to system 107/312.  It further shows system 107/312
       transferred the message to 132/101, and 132/101 processed it again.
       Here's another example:

                 ^APATH: 107/6 107/312 107/528 107/312 132/101

       This shows the message having been processed by node 107/312 on more
       than one occasion.  Based upon the earlier description of the
       'information control' fields in Echomail messages, this identifies
       an error in processing.  This further shows node 107/528 as the node
       which apparently processed the message incorrectly.  In this case
       the path line can be used to help locate the source of duplicate
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 14                  11 Nov 1996


       messages or topology problems.

       In a conference with many participants it becomes almost impossible
       to determine the exact topology used.  In these cases the use of the
       path line can help a moderator or distributor of a conference track
       any possible breakdowns in the overall topology, while not
       substantially increasing the amount of information transmitted.
       Having this small amount of information added to each message pays
       for itself very quickly when it can be used to help detect a
       topology problem causing duplicate messages to be transmitted to
       each system.

     For immediate release to FidoNews:

     First of all, I apologize if I have mislead anyone about U'NI-Net.  I
     have not actually *tried* U'NI-Net since there is no system on that
     network local to me.  I merely chose UN'I-Net as an example of another
     network like Intelec that has much stricter rules than FidoNet.  The
     one thing I do have to add is that Cam DeBuck is a moderator on
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 15                  11 Nov 1996


     Intelec, so it's obvious where her ideas about a BBS network come
     from.  Enough said on that subject.

     Now for the topic at hand.  FidoNet *is* suffering crushing blows from
     the Internet.  If we intend to survive as a network, we have to appeal
     to netizens.  This might start with a World Wide Web site.  I have not
     seen www.fidonet.org, because for some reason I kept getting an error
     message that the server was not responding...(this could be the fault
     of the ISP, though)  This article is an open letter, and a call for
     action.

     We need software that's easier to use.  Your typical FidoNet
     connection software requires understanding obscure concepts like
     FOSSIL drivers and nodelists and so forth.  As much as possible needs
     to be shielded from the end user and there needs to be ONE software
     package to do it all.  A FidoNet BBS or point node needs separate
     components from various vendors: a FOSSIL driver, a front-end mailer,
     mail reading software (or the BBS software itself), a mail tosser (one
     for Fido .PKTs and one for .QWKs for some setups), a nodelist, a
     nodelist compiler, a nodediff compiler, an offline mail reader door
     for some BBSes, etc.  The closest approximation to a "complete"
     FidoNet point setup, for instance, is Terminate 4.0. It includes a
     FidoNet-compatible mailer, mail reader, mail tosser (both QWK and
     PKT), terminal program, internal communications drivers (obviating the
     need for FOSSILs except for a few with ISDN, or other non-standard
     setups), etc.  We're in the age of GUI, folks!  We need to settle on a
     standard for GUIs on a BBS, and make all-inclusive packages like
     Terminate for end-users, and better setups for people to start BBSes
     (WildCat! 5 is a start...)

     We need to emphasize FidoNet's quality of messaging content.  The fact
     that we have Moderators and newsgroups are not usually moderated
     matters.  We need more echos that cross FidoNet <-> Usenet boundaries
     but have their roots in FidoNet (there's at least one I'm aware of).
     We need to emphasize that FidoNet can offer all of the functionality
     of Usenet without the anarchy and chaos that exist on Usenet.  Besides
     porting FidoNet to Usenet, another idea might involve porting FidoNet
     conferences into Internet mailing lists, or making them available on
     the WWW.

     Advertising ourselves on the Web is just as important...  Like I said,
     I haven't seen www.fidonet.org (if it even exists), but advertising is
     key.  Getting the message out that FidoNet is out there, and is a
     completely viable alternative to the Usenet is the key to FidoNet's
     survival.

     So, software authors, users, SysOps, coordinators, UNITE!  There is
     much work to be done, and we should stop squandering time with all the
     political in-fighting.  If we don't, FidoNet's days are numbered.

     by Troy H. Cheek, 1:362/708.4

     According to Peter E. Popovich (1:363/264) and his Latest Greatest
     Software Versions list, Atari ST/TT software is slated to be phased
     out this week.  I hope that the information I mailed him yesterday
     will change that to "_was_ slated..."  Given the number of people
     still using such software (judging by origin and tear lines seen in
     various echoes), I simply assumed someone more qualified than I am
     would have already given Peter all the information he needed to know.
     Shows us what we get when we assume, doesn't it?  :-)

     If you or someone you know is using an Atari computer to access
     Fidonet, or simply has an interest in Atari in general, please note
     the following Fidonet echomail conferences:

     Tag:    ATARI_ST
     Mod:    Troy Cheek, 1:362/708.4
     Dist:   Z1-Backbone

     ATARI_ST covers the Atari ST and every Atari computer since (Mega ST,
     STe, Mega STe, TT, Falcon, Medusa, etc).  It also covers the Lynx and
     Jaguar game machines.

     Tag:    ST_PROG
     Mod:    Rodney Rudd, 1:138/34
     Dist:   Z1-Backbone

     ST_PROG originally covered only the programming of the Atari ST and
     later computers, but later expanded to include the game machines as
     well.  More recently, it has expanded to include programming of all
     things Atari.

     Tag:    ATARI
     Mod:    Larry Black, 1:3608/121
     Dist:   Z1-Backbone

     ATARI covers all Atari products based on the 6502 microprocessor such
     as the Atari 400/800, 600XL/800XL/1200XL, 65XE/XEGS/130XE, etc.  The
     moderator enforces this restriction rather strictly.

     Tag:    VID_GAME
     Mod:    Troy Cheek, 1:362/708.4
     Dist:   Z1-Backbone

     VID_GAME is dedicated to home videogames in general, including the
     Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, Panther, Lynx, and Jaguar.

     Please note that ALL of these echoes are active, listed in the
     Echolist, and are distributed on the backbone.  For some reason,
     people seeking these echoes have been told this is not the case.

          WHAT IS THE CONFERENCE MAIL SYSTEM?

               Conference Mail  is a  technique to  permit several  nodes
               on  a network to  share a  message base,  similar  in
               concept  to  the conferences available on many of the
               computer services, but it is most closely related to the
               Usenet system consisting of more than 8,000 systems  world
               wide. All systems sharing a given conference see any
               messages entered  into the  conference  by  any  of the
               participating systems.  This can  be implemented in such a
               way as to be  totally transparent  to the users of a
               particular node. In fact, they  may not  even be  aware of
               the network being used to move their  messages about from
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 19                  11 Nov 1996


               node to node!  Unfortunately, this has its  disadvantages
               also  - most  users who  are not educated about Conference
               Mail do  not realize  the messages  transmitted cost MANY
               sysops (system  operators) money,  not just  the local
               sysop. This  is an important consideration in Conference
               Mail and should not be taken lightly.  In a conference with
               100 systems as participants the cost per message can get
               quite high.

               The Conference  Mail System is designed to operate in
               conjunction with a  FidoNet compatible  mail server.  The
               currently supported mail servers  are Fido(tm),  SEAdog(tm),
               Opus, and Dutchie. Since the mail  server is  a prerequisite
               to using the Conference Mail System, it  will be  assumed
               you  already have  your mail  server operating correctly  on
               your   system, and you are connected into FidoNet or a
               compatible network.


          HISTORY OF THE CONFERENCE MAIL SYSTEM

               In late  1985, Jeff  Rush, a  Fido  sysop  in  Dallas,
               wanted  a convenient means  of sharing  ideas with the other
               Dallas sysops.  He created  a system  of programs  he called
               Echomail,  and the Dallas sysops' Conference was born.

               Within a  short time  sysops in other areas began hearing of
               this marvelous new  gadget and  Echomail took  on a  life of
               its own.  Today, a  scant year and a half later, the FidoNet
               public network boasts a myriad of conferences varying in
               size from the dozen-or-so participants  in the  FidoNet
               Technical  Standards Committee Conference  to   the  Sysops'
               Conference  with  several hundred participants. It  is not
               uncommon for a node to carry 30 or more conferences and
               share those conferences with 10 or more nodes.


          HOW IT WORKS

               The Conference  Mail System  is functionally  compatible
               with the original Echomail utilities.  In general, the
               process is:

               1. A  message is  entered into  a designated  area on  a
                  FidoNet compatible system.

               2. This message is "Exported" along with some control
                  information to each system "linked" to the conference
                  through the originating system.

               3. Each  of the  receiving systems  "Import" the message
                  into the proper Conference Mail area.

               4. The receiving systems then "Export" these messages, along
                  with additional control  information,  to  each  of
                  their conference links.
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 20                  11 Nov 1996


               5. Return to step 3.

               As you  can see,  the method  is quite  simple -  in
               general.  Of course, following  the steps  literally would
               mean messages would never stop being Exported and
               transmitted to other systems.  This obviously would  not be
               desired or  the  network  would  quickly become
               overburdened.  The information  contained in  the 'control
               information' section  is used  to prevent  transmitting the
               same message more than once to a single system.


          CONFERENCE MAIL MESSAGE CONTROL INFORMATION

               There are  five pieces  of control  information associated
               with a Conference  Mail  message.  Some  are  optional, some
               are  not.  Normally this information is never entered by the
               person creating the  message.   The  following control
               fields   determine how Conference Mail is handled:

               1. Area line

                    This is  the first  line of  a conference  mail
                    message. Its actual appearance is:

                                          AREA:CONFERENCE

                    Where CONFERENCE is the name of the conference. This
                    line is added when  a conference  is  being  "Exported"
                    to  another system. It  is based upon information found
                    in the AREAS.BBS (configuration) File  for the
                    designated message area. This field is  REQUIRED by the
                    receiving  system to  "Import"  a message into the
                    correct Conference Mail area.

               2. Tear Line

                    This line is near the end of a message and consists of
                    three dashes (---)  followed by  an  optional  program
                    specifier.  This is  used to show the first program
                    used to add Echomail compatible control information to
                    the message. The tear line generated by Conference Mail
                    looks like:

                           --- <a small product-specific banner>

                    This  field   is  optional   for  most  Echomail
                    compatible processors, and  is added  by the Conference
                    Mail System to ensure complete compatibility. Some
                    systems will place this line in the message  when it is
                    first  created, but  it is normally added when the
                    message is first "exported."

               3. Origin line

                    This line  appears near  the bottom of a message and
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 21                  11 Nov 1996


                    gives a small amount  of  information  about  the
                    system  where  it originated. It looks like:

                           * Origin: The Conference Mail BBS (1:132/101)

                    The "  * Origin:  " part  of the  line is  a constant
                    field.  This is followed by the name of the system as
                    taken from the AREAS.BBS file  or a  file named  ORIGIN
                    located  in the DOS directory of  the  designated
                    message  area.  The  complete network address
                    (1:132/101 in  this case)  is added  by the program
                    inserting  the line.  This field is generated at the
                    same time  as the  tear line,  and therefore  may
                    either  be generated at  the time  of  creation  or
                    during  the  first "export"  processing.   Although
                    the  Origin  line  is not required by  all Echomail
                    processors, it  is added by  the Conference Mail System
                    to ensure complete compatibility.


               4. Seen-by Lines

                    There can  be many  seen-by lines  at the  end of
                    Conference Mail messages,  and they  are the real
                    "meat" of the control information. They  are used  to
                    determine  the  systems  to receive the exported
                    messages. The format of the line is:

                           SEEN-BY: 132/101 113 136/601 1014/1

                    The net/node  numbers correspond  to the net/node
                    numbers of the systems having already received the
                    message. In this way a message  is never  sent to a
                    system twice. In a conference with many  participants
                    the  number of seen-by lines can be very large.   This
                    line is added if it is not already a part of the
                    message, or added to if it already exists, each time
                    a message  is exported  to other systems. This is a
                    REQUIRED field, and  Conference Mail  will not function
                    correctly if this field  is not put in place by other
                    Echomail compatible programs.

               5. PATH Lines

                    These are  the last  lines in  a Conference Mail
                    message and are a  new addition,  and therefore  is not
                    supported by all Echomail processors. It appears as
                    follows:

                           ^aPATH: 132/101 1014/1

                    Where the  ^a stands  for Control-A  (ASCII character
                    1) and the net/nodes  listed correspond  to  those
                    systems having processed the  message before it reached
                    the current system.  This is  not the  same as  the
                    seen-by lines, because those lines list  all systems
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 22                  11 Nov 1996


                    the message has been sent to, while the path line
                    contains all systems having actually processed the
                    message.  This is not a required field, and few
                    echomail processors currently  support it,  however it
                    can  be  used safely with  any other  system, since the
                    line(s)  will  be ignored. For  a discussion  on how
                    the  path  line  can  be helpful, see the "Advanced
                    Features" section of this manual.


          METHODS OF SENDING CONFERENCE MAIL

               To this  point the  issue of how Conference Mail is actually
               sent has been glossed over entirely. The phrase has been,
               "the message is exported  to another  system."   What
               exactly  does this mean?  Well, for starters lets show what
               is called the "basic" setup:

               In this setup exported mail is placed into the FidoNet mail
               area.  Each message   exported  from a  Conference  Mail
               area  has one message generated  for each  receiving system.
               This mail is then sent the  same as any other network mail.
               When Echomail was first created this was the only way mail
               could be sent.

               The "basic"  method has some disadvantages. First, since
               Echomail has grown so large it is not uncommon to get 200
               new messages per day imported  into various message bases.
               It is also not uncommon for a  system to  be exporting
               messages to 4 or 5 other systems.  Simple arithmetic  shows
               800-1000  messages per day would be sent in normal  netmail!
               This  puts a tremendous strain on any netmail system, not to
               mention transmission time and the resultant phone charges.
               When this limitation of Echomail was first noticed a lot of
               people started scratching their heads wondering what to do.
               If a  solution  could  not  be  found  it appeared  Echomail
               would certainly overrun the capabilities of FidoNet.

               Thom Henderson  (from System Enhancement Associates) came up
               with the original  ARCmail program.  Having previously
               written the ARC file archiving  and compression  program, he
               knew the  savings achievable by  having all  of the netmail
               messages placed in .ARC format for  transmission. As a
               byproduct, the messages no longer appeared in  the netmail
               area,  but  were  included  in  a  file attached to  a
               message  (see your  FidoNet mailer manual for file
               attaches).  In   this  way  the  tremendous  number  of
               messages generated, and the phone bill problems were both
               solved.

               Unfortunately, ARCmail  required the  messages to first be
               placed into the  netmail area  before it  could be  run. In
               effect,  it caused the  messages to  be scanned once when
               they were exported, once during  the ARCmail  phase, once
               when ARCmail was run at the other end  to get  the messages
               out of .ARC format, and once when those messages  were later

               imported into  a message  base on the receiving system.  The
               Conference Mail System solves this problem by eliminating
               the ARCmail  program. Conference  Mail builds the ARCmail
               files during Export, and unpacks them during Import. This
               way  messages   are  exported  directly  to  ARCmail  style
               file attaches, and imported directly from ARCmail style file
               attaches.  The scanning  phases between importing and
               exporting messages are totally removed and processing time
               is proportionally reduced.

               This is  now the  most common  method for sending Conference
               Mail between systems.  The overhead  involved in  doing it
               during the importing and exporting phases is much less than
               what is involved if ARCmailing  is not  utilized. This was a
               primary consideration in the  design and  implementation of
               the Conference Mail System, and as  a result  the entire
               system is optimized for this type of use.  Please  refer  to
               the  Import  and  Export functions  for specifics on how to
               use the ARCmailing feature.


          CONFERENCE TOPOLOGY

               The  way   in  which  systems  link  together  for  a
               particular conference is  called the "conference topology."
               It is important to know  this structure  for two  reasons:
               1)  It is important to have a  topology which  is  efficient
               in  the transfer  of  the Conference Mail  messages, and  2)
               It  is important  to  have  a topology which  will not cause
               systems  to see the same messages more than once.

               Efficiency can  be measured  in a  number  of  ways;  least
               time involved for all systems to receive a message, least
               cost for all systems to receive a message, and fewest phone
               calls required for all systems  to receive  a message  are
               all  valid indicators  of efficiency. Users  of Echomail
               compatible systems have determined (through trial  and
               error)  the best measure of  efficiency is a combination  of
               all  three  of the  measurements  given  above.  Balancing
               the equation is not trivial, but some guidelines can be
               given:

                    1. Never have two systems attempting to send Conference
                    mail to each other at the same time. This results in
                    "collisions" that will  cause both  systems to fail.
                    To  avoid this, one system should  be responsible for
                    polling  while the  other system is holding mail.  This
                    arrangement can alternate based upon various criteria,
                    but  both systems  should  never be attempting to call
                    each other at the same time.

                    2. Have  nodes form  "stars" for  distribution of
                    Conference Mail. This arrangement has several nodes all
                    receiving their Conference Mail from the same system.
                    In general the systems on the  "outside"  of  the  star
                    poll  the  system  on the "inside". The  system on  the
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 24                  11 Nov 1996


                    "inside"  in turn polls other systems to  receive the
                    Conference Mail that is being passed on to the
                    "outside" systems.

                    3. Utilize  fully connected  polygons with  a few
                    vertices.  Nodes can  be connected in a triangle (A
                    sends to B and C, B sends to  A and  C, C sends to A
                    and B) or a fully connected square (all  corners of the
                    square send to all of the other corners). This method
                    is useful for getting Conference Mail messages to each
                    node as quickly as possible.


               All of  these efficiency  guidelines have to be tempered
               with the guidelines dealing  with keeping  duplicate
               messages  from  being exported. Duplicates  will occur  in
               any  topology that  forms  a closed polygon  that is not
               fully connected. Take for example the following
               configuration:

                                           A ----- B
                                           |       |
                                           |       |
                                           C ----- D

               This square  is a  closed polygon that is not fully
               connected. It is capable of generating duplicates as
               follows:

                    1. A message is entered on node A.

                    2. Node  A exports  the message to node B and node C
                       placing the seen-by for A, B, and C in the message
                       as it does so.

                    3. Node  B sees that node D is not listed in the seen-
                       by and exports the message to node D.

                    4. Node  C sees that node D is not listed in the seen-
                       by and exports the message to node D.

               At this  point node  D has  received the  same message
               twice - a duplicate was  generated. Normally  a "dup-ring"
               will not  be as simple as  a square.  Generally it  will be
               caused by a system on one end  of a  long chain accidentally
               connecting to a system on the other end of the chain. This
               causes the two ends of the chain to become connected,
               forming a polygon.

               In FidoNet  this problem  is reduced somewhat by having
               "Regional Echomail Coordinators"  (RECS) that try to keep
               track of Echomail connections within  their regions  of the
               world. A  further rule which is  followed is  that only  the
               RECS  are allowed  to  make inter-regional connections for
               the larger conferences. In return, the RECS  have
               established  a very  efficient topology which gets messages
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 25                  11 Nov 1996


               from  coast to  coast, and onto over 200 systems in less
               than 24  hours. If  no one were willing to follow the rules,
               then this system  would collapse,  but due to the excellent
               efficiency it has remained intact for over a year.


          Why a PATH line?

               As was  previously mentioned,  the PATH  line is a new
               concept in Echomail. It  stores the  net/node numbers  of
               each system having actually processed  a message.  This
               information  is  useful  in correcting the  biggest problem
               encountered by  nodes running an Echomail compatible  system
               - the problem of finding the cause of duplicate messages.
               How does  the  PATH  line  help  solve  this problem? Take
               the following path line as an example:

                    ^aPATH: 107/6 107/312 132/101

               This  shows  the  message  was  processed  by  system  107/6
               and transferred to  system 107/312.  It further  shows
               system 107/312 transferred the  message to  132/101, and
               132/101  processed  it again. Now take the following path
               line as the example:

                    ^aPATH: 107/6 107/312 107/528 107/312 132/101

               This shows  the message  having been processed by node
               107/312 on more than one occasion. Based upon the earlier
               description of the 'information control'  fields in Echomail
               messages, this clearly is an  error in  processing (see  the
               section  entitled "How  it Works"). This  further shows node
               107/528 as  the  node which apparently processed  the
               message  incorrectly. In this case the path line  can be
               used to quickly locate the source of duplicate messages.

               In  a   conference  with  many  participants  it  becomes
               almost impossible to  determine the  exact topology used. In
               these cases the use of the path line can help a coordinator
               of the conference track any  possible breakdowns in the
               overall topology, while not substantially increasing  the
               amount  of information transmitted.  Having this  small
               amount of information added to the end of each message pays
               for itself very quickly when it can be used to help detect a
               topology  problem  causing  duplicate  messages  to  be
               transmitted to each system.

       It was suggested to me to contact you in regard to a policy
       complaint I have been trying to get R13C Philip Dampiere to resolve
       for many months. I was wrongfully removed from the nodelist by
       N2623C Bob Taylor.  I've written to Philip Dampiere quite a few
       times, with no replies.  I've also written to Bob Satti, in regard
       to Philip's failure to perform the duties of RC in regard to Policy
       Complaints, with no replies..

       Is there anything you can do to help?

       Below is included the msgs I've sent to Philip Dampiere. Please let
       me know.

     Greetings Phillip!


      I sent a message (Policy Complaint, (TM)) about this a while ago.
      Things haven't improved much since then.  It's still difficult to get
      the NC to perform his job as NC, particularly in making fidonews
      available. I've tried being patient and helpful, but it doesn't seem
      to get me anywhere.  I think perhaps its time to appoint a new NC for
      this net..  Isn't there enough stagnation and inertia in fido
      already??

       Anyway,  I asked for this week's fidonews, and haven't been able to
       get it. I thought the NC was -required- to make fidonews available?
       He doesn't even poll to get it directly, and makes no effort
       whatsoever to get it when whoever is feeding him, fails to deliver
       it to him.  This has been going on since September of last year (I
       said that in the last message I sent you asking for help in this)!
       Why can't we get the fidonews from our NC?

        If I have to call LD and make the stuff available myself, then I
        want the NC title along with it. I promote the net, the current NC
        just drifts along, making it difficult to even get new nodes into
        the net.. When I had FTPFIDO I fed the NC without any hitches, the
        fidonews was always delivered weekly as it is supposed to be.

        What are we supposed to do to break this inertia??  The fidonews is
        the last vestage of stability in fidonet, and now we can't even get
        that!

        Please help!

       Can you please tell me why you have not replied to any msgs?  We

     Greetings Bob!

       I've been trying to get Philip Dampiere to help us down here in
       net2623.  I have had no replies in 3 months.  Is he still R13C?  Can
       you look into whats going on?  We have no NC, the former appointed
       NEC seems to think he's taking over, and is already axing people
       from the nodelist, simply because he doesn't like them.  We get no
       nodediffs or fidonews.  Please help

     Thanks

     Greetings Phillip!

       This is a follow-up on a previous policy complaint submitted to
       1:13/0

       We are in need of a new NC here. You have not responded to my
       netmails, so I'm assuming there's also no RC to handle policy
       complaints. Please let me know what is going on ASAP.

       There is a growing problem, Bob Taylor (1:2623/58) seems to believe
       he is taking over as NC, and insists on writing me off the nodelist
       with no reason. Given that he does not officially have the /0
       designation, he cannot send in a diff that would delete my node, and
       this is all that stands between me and deletion.  I tried to discuss
       the problem with Bob via netmail (ignored) and today via telephone,
       but apparently Bob does not want to be reasonable, he stated he just
       does not like me and he can do whatever he wants.  This is
       ridiculous.  Is fidonet dead, and no one cares how bad it gets, or
       can any of you *Cs still going to help with this situation? I have
       sent numerous netmails to Philip and find the system down alot, and
       get no replies.

       Whatever Bob's problem with me is, is a personal matter, not a
       fidonet matter, and his attempt to remove me is uncalled for.  I use
       fidonet mainly for netmail and files, what reason is there to take
       my node number? I have received no complaints or warnings, and Bob

      THE HACKER TEST - Version 1.0

      Preface:  06.16.89

      This test was conceived and written by Felix Lee, John Hayes and
      Angela Thomas at the end of the spring semester, 1989.  It has gone
      through many revisions prior to this initial release, and will
      undoubtedly go through many more.

      (Herewith a compendium of fact and folklore about computer hackerdom,
       cunningly disguised as a test.)

      Scoring - Count 1 for each item that you have done, or each
                question that you can answer correctly.

      If you score is between:                    You are

                 0x000 and 0x010       ->         Computer Illiterate
                 0x011 and 0x040       ->         a User
                 0x041 and 0x080       ->         an Operator
                 0x081 and 0x0C0       ->         a Nerd
                 0x0C1 and 0x100       ->         a Hacker
                 0x101 and 0x180       ->         a Guru
                 0x181 and 0x200       ->         a Wizard

      Note: If you don't understand the scoring, stop here.

      And now for the questions...

     The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
     Your question was:

     > Mr Oracle:
     >
     >       Who wrote Opus 51 No. 1?
     >
     >       What musical instruments is it best played on?

     And in response, thus spake the Oracle:

     } Opus v51.1 was never released.  Once Wynn Wagner turned over Opus
     } development to George Stanislav, development virtually ceased except
     } for small incremental updates.  The latest version is currently
     } 1.70.
     }
     } As to the instruments, it was originally orchestrated for a DEC
     } Rainbow, but lately the instrument of choice has been an IBM PC.
     }
     } You owe the Oracle a decent FTSC-compatible mailer.

                PKWARE(R) ships PKZIP(R) for Windows Version 2.50

             Includes 32-bit support for Windows(R) 95 and Windows NT
     =====================================================================

     Brown Deer, WI - PKWARE, Inc., Friday, November 1, 1996, released a
     new version of the worlds best-known compression utility, PKZIP for
     Windows. This new release takes full advantage of the 32-bit operating
     system environments found in Windows 95 and Windows NT. An enhanced
     16-bit version is also included for Windows 3.1x users.

     Important features of PKZIP for Windows includes the ability to:

     * Create self-extracting Windows archives. This allows creation of
       archives that do not require PKZIP for Windows to extract files from
       the archive; self-extractor can create a program group and register
       extensions in Windows 95.

     * Create spanned .ZIP archives. A spanned .ZIP archive exists over
       more than one diskette or other removable media.

     * Span self-extracting Windows archives.

     * Drag and drop files from the File Manager or Windows Explorer into
       an open archive within PKZIP.

     * Recognize .ZIP archives imbedded with authenticity verification by
       PKZIP for DOS v2.04g.

     * Retain and restore Windows 95 and Windows NT long filenames.

     * Create new, open and test existing, and extract files from .ZIP
       files within the Windows 95 and Windows NT v.4.0 Explorer.

     * Click the right mouse button to activate a menu of the most often
       used features in PKZIP for Windows.

     * Have multiple .ZIP archives open simultaneously.

     * Quickly and easily copy or move files between different .ZIP
     FIDONEWS 13-46               Page 54                  11 Nov 1996


       archives without having to extract those files.

     * Convert archives to, or from, a normal .ZIP, a Windows
       self-extracting or a DOS self-extracting file.

     * View files from within an archive without extracting individual
       files.

     * Add, edit and view .ZIP archive comments.

     * Easily uninstall PKZIP for Windows, restoring your system to the
       setup previous to installation.

     PKZIP for Windows also has a distribution licensed version which has
     more advanced features for creating self-extracting archives.
     Individuals and companies can create small, easy-to-use archives to
     distribute their files and applications. With one click of a button,
     the self-extracting archive will install its file contents quickly and
     easily at a predefined location. After file extraction, the
     self-extractor can then automatically run a program, if so desired.

     "Many feature enhancements suggested by our valued customers are now
     in PKZIP for Windows," said Phil Katz, president of PKWARE. "The
     distribution licensed version is an especially exciting product
     enhancement, since it can take the place of using a special install
     program."

     PKZIP for Windows is compatible with other versions available for the
     DOS, OS/2 and OpenVMS Alpha/VAX platforms.

     Pricing and Availability
     ________________________

     The PKZIP for Windows version 2.50 is available immediately for $49.
     Registered users of PKZIP for DOS and OS/2 can purchase the Windows
     version of PKZIP for $29.
