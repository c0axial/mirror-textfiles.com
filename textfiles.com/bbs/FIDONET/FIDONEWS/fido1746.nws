                      Saturday morning November 4, 2000.
     Good morning to all of you!  Great morning lots of sunshine here!
     Grab a cup of your favorite brew and bear with Ol'wdb a couple of
     moments while I refresh your memory as to why this is a great day.

     It is the day before national election day in the United States. And
     just in time to make those monumental decisions of who to trust to
     guide your country's powerful engines of economy, environment, and
     safe well being of all citizens.  To know the issues and be prepared
     before you cast your ballot, be it absentee or at your local
     designated voting place.  To vote `helter skelter' is a waste of your
     voting privilege.  So take a few and read the issues in your voting
     packet; then make a list to shorten your time in the booth.

     Many men and women have given their lives so you can have that
     privilege, (thousands and thousands); and millions more have fought
     beside them. Freedom is not easily won, don't waste it in total
     disregard because your plate is full now... To do so may cause an
     empty belly later. The rights we enjoy did not come on a silver
     platter, rather by the most devastating destruction free men could
     devise to stay free. Look forward to your privilege in casting your
     vote, it is the one that counts!!!
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     An excerpt from Darrell's requested submission in Letters to Editor

      "Uhm, Warren, a friendly bit of advice for you, you might want to
     reconsider publishing "supermarket tabloid" articles like the one Mr.
     Grant sent you. It really makes Fidonet look cheap and sleazy, and
     heaven knows, Fidonet is in enough trouble as it is.

     That's it Ol' WDB! Have a great day and keep up the good work!

     Signed: The Region12 Nodelist Clerk!"

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Editors note: Accepting your "friendly bit of advice", Darrell, and it
     is taken with reciprocal friendly feelings.  However, how can I
     `accept' your article for publication and not put my other foot into
     the same sand box?  Letters to the editor are just that, and if
     requested, this editor-pro-tem will print them as long as they are
     civil in language, and meet the MakeNews.exe's parameters.

     My personal opinion has no place politically on ANYONE's message. I
     will not "tamper" with the content of a request, whether I like it or
     not.  The content is the author's and not mine to change, if I find
     reason to believe it likely to be disruptive to the harmony of Fido, I
     will return it to sender for modification.

     Also, in my opinion, contrary to your belief that it diminishes Fido
     to publish submitted letters of opinion; I think it gives voice to
     those who otherwise have no voice. That may be good for Fido... And it

     may bring many back to the table. To limit freedom of speech would be
     the death knell of fidonews.

     Editor,

     2 weeks ago I sent you this Email and asked you to post the links in
     the Fidonews section of the snooze.  You graciously published my Email
     in the snooze but forgot to add the links to the news section.  Would
     you mind terribly adding the links to the news portion?

     Thank you Shannon Talley

     Fidotel has been offline for quite some time.....  However, I have
     recently purchased new computers, upgraded software, and have acquired
     a very reliable xDSL line.

     Hi Warren:

     You perhaps didn't receive my resend of my submission? I'll try
     it this way:

     *Ed:(Sorry this is the first time I've received this request).

                                 Surf(ac)ing

                        London, Frankfurt, and New York
                        Are very faraway...
                        But lots of people that
                        I know Access them every day.

                        With all these far-flung places,
                        They've great libraries there...
                        And one can go and visit them
                        Without moving from one's chair.

                        That's on a web page, too.
                        There are so many things to see...
                        So many things to do!

                        But while you're busy surfing,
                        We beg you... don't forget
                        The good times that you've had with us,
                        Your friends in Fidonet.

                                   ENGLISH
     Centuries ago, English was mostly spoken by a few million people in
     the British Isles, and there were a few local dialects such as Irish
     English.  But in the last century, the language has exploded across
     the world and diversified, picking up many words and pronunciation
     styles from local tongues.

     Measured by the number of people for whom English is their first
     language, 72% speak American English and 16% use British English. 6%
     use Canadian English, 5% use Australian English and 1% use New Zealand
     English.  There are also dozens of minor dialects, including
     Caribbean, South African, (Asian) Indian, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh.

     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 5                    6 Nov 2000


     Even within American English there are significant regional
     differences.  Boston English is different from the language spoken in
     Atlanta, and Chicago English is different from both of them.

     I would just like to take this opportunity to say, "Thank you,
     FidoNews!" for your article on "Tick" and "Hatch".  For a while now, I
     thought that all of this talk about "Tick" referred to the SMTP ".TIC"
     protocol handshaking.  I was not aware that there was actually a
     separate program for FidoNET file propagation that was literally
     called "Tick", or for that matter, that "Hatch" was more than just a
     metaphor. Thank you for your excellent article!

     life.  But have you ever wondered what it would be like if God decided
     to install voice mail? Imagine praying and hearing this:

     Thank you for calling My Father's House. Please select one of the
     following options: Press 1 for Requests.  Press 2 for Thanksgiving.
     Press 3 for Complaints. Press 4 for All Other Inquiries.

     I am sorry, all of our angels are busy helping other sinners right
     now. However, your prayer is important to us and will be answered in
     the order in which it was received, so please stay on the line.

     If you would like to speak to:
     God - press 1.
     Jesus - press 2.
     The Holy Spirit - press 3.
     If you would like to hear King David sing a Psalm while you are
     holding, please press 4.
     To find out if a loved one has been assigned to Heaven, press 5.
     Enter his or her Social Security number, then press the pound key.
     If you get a negative response, try area code 666.

     For reservations at My Father's House, please enter:
     JOHN followed by 3-16.
     For nagging questions about dinosaurs, the age of the earth and where
     Noah's Ark is, please wait until you arrive here.

     Our computers show that you have already prayed once today. Please
     hang up and try again tomorrow.

     If you need emergency assistance dial 1(900) GOD-WHYME (This is a toll

                     Glass of Milk
     One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his
     way through school, found he had only one thin dime left, and he was
     hungry.  He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house.
     However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door.

     Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked
     hungry so brought him a large glass of milk.  He Drank it slowly, and
     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 7                    6 Nov 2000


     then asked, "How much do I owe you?" "You don't owe me anything," she
     replied. "Mother has taught us never to accept pay for a kindness."

     He said..... "Then I thank you from my heart." As Howard Kelly left
     that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God
     and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and Quit school.

     Year's later that young woman became critically ill.  The local
     doctors were baffled.  They finally sent her to the big city, where
     they called in specialists to study her rare disease.

     Dr.  Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation.  When he heard
     the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes.
     Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her
     room.

     Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her.  He recognized her
     at once.  He went back to the consultation room determined to do his
     best to save her life.  From that day he gave special attention to the
     case.

     After a long struggle, the battle was won.  Dr.  Kelly requested the
     business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked
     at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent it to
     her room.  She feared to open it, for she was sure it would take the
     rest of her life to pay for it all.

     Finally she looked, and something caught her attention on the side of
     the bill. She read these words.....  "Paid in full with one glass of
     milk".

     (Signed) Dr.  Howard Kelly.

     Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: "Thank You,
     God, that Your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands."

     Subject: An article for you
     Date: Saturday, November 04, 2000 6:51 AM

     Here is my submitted article.

     Hello Warren! Seems a rather confused sysop submitted an article to
     you last week. In my usual hospitable manner, I would like to help him
     out and introduce him to the concept of reality. Hence I submit this
     to you for publishing in next week's 'Snooze.

     First of all, nobody here in Region 12 seems to know what Mr. Grant is
     talking about. Now while that doesn't surprise me, it may surprise
     some of our readers, who may have mistakenly thought that Mr. Grant
     knows what he is talking about. Fortunately I am here to set the
     record straight. :)
     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 8                    6 Nov 2000


     As best as I can figure, someone from Region 12 became disgruntled
     with the R12EC and moved away. It seems he found an ear with Mr. Grant
     and told a rather unbelievable tale of woe regarding his time here.
     Either that or Mr. Grant made it all up. Either way, it's the stuff
     fairy tales are made of. :)

     We in Region 12 allow sysops to come and go from here as they please,
     so if one chooses to go somewhere else, this is not particularly
     shocking to us in any way, especially considering the fact that
     certain sysops don't get along too well with some of the other kids in
     the sandbox. As you know, Warren, we in Region 12 have long been
     advocates of free geographical movement of sysops.

     On to Mr. Grant's fantasies ...

     - He alleges that if a sysop in Region 12 doesn't agree with the way
     things are done here he is looked down upon.

     What does this mean? Sysops here have differing opinions all the time,
     nothing shocking or newsworthy there.

     - Mr. Grant alleges that if a sysop in Region 12 chooses not to vote
     in the annual elections, he's apparently casted as an "outsider", and
     his nodelisting may even get pulled for "inactivity in the R12 echos,
     or some other foolishness.

     This is very strange, Warren, and not surprisingly, apparently nobody
     here knows anything about this either. The R12C certainly didn't pull
     any node numbers, and I don't know of any Region 12 NCs that have done
     this either. I'd have to say Mr. Grant is again delusional on this
     one.

     - Mr. Grant alleges that "It seems the elfishness even extends to the
     holy and anointed mail mover and "defender of the dogma" of Region 12,
     to whom someone apparently forgot to mention that the moving of
     echomail should not involve politics. Heaven forbid that an R12 node
     might try to crash route a netmail; the Fido "free region" is internet
     aware, don't you know; and has perfect routed netmail lines that never
     lose mail. Why bother with a silly little thing like POTS
     connectivity? Who still uses modems these days anyhow?"

     Hmm ... more delusions apparently, Warren, and just who is Mr. Grant
     quoting? Himself? ROTFL! Many of us have modems here and we route
     netmail all the time. Poor Mr. Grant.

     - Mr. Grant further alleges that "the elfin antics of the top banana
     in the R12 bunch; it seems recently this "nodelist clerk" took a
     dislike to the sudden appearance of a certain node number of which he
     did not approve, in the path lines of a certain member of his region's
     echomail. Now this little detail perturbed this nodelist clerk so much
     that he just felt he had to fire off an immediate netmail to the
     offending node in order to voice his displeasure.

     Huh? Is he talking about me, Warren? I've read quite a few
     nose-stretchers in my time in this hobby, and while I certainly do
     consider Michael Grant to be a few bricks short of a full load, I
     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 9                    6 Nov 2000


     could care less who chooses to exchange mail with him. I fear Mr.
     Grant needs help. I sincerely hope he finds it.

     As for firing off a netmail to the offending node, poor Mr. Grant has
     completely lost it here, since I have sent no such netmail and would
     challenge Mr. Grant to produce this netmail. He can't of course,
     unless he fabricates one, something he seems quite good at,
     fabrication that is. :)

     - Mr. Grant wonders "Now is it just me, or does anyone else out there
     wonder just what business it is for a "nodelist clerk" where one of
     his regions sysops pulls his echomail from?

     To answer his question, this nodelist clerk could not care less where
     a sysop pulls their mail, but he knew that.

     - Mr. Grant further wonders aloud "The last time I checked, getting an
     echomail feed from a different source than the "approved" one was not
     a Fido crime, and not even against any policy that a region might
     choose not to recognize.

     Mr. Grant is delusional yet again, Warren, as we have no "approved"
     source. Our sysops freely get their mail anywhere they please. One
     need only check the routing charts for evidence of that. Perhaps Mr.
     Grant can produce proof of this bit of imagination as well. :)

     - Here Mr. Grant identifies himself and makes another rather dubious
     statement, "Yes, Ol' WDB, you guessed right; the node number which the
     R12 ElfLo-* err, "nodelist clerk" objected to so much to was none
     other than 1:134/11; my own happy Fido home on the range.

     Again, Warren, I have made no such objection, and challenge Mr. Grant
     to provide proof of this. Oh dear, if he cannot, we'll be forced to
     believe he is a liar, or extremely delusional, or both. Too bad, so
     sad.

     Uhm, Warren, a friendly bit of advice for you, you might want to
     reconsider publishing "supermarket tabloid" articles like the one Mr.
     Grant sent you. It really makes Fidonet look cheap and sleazy, and
     heaven knows, Fidonet is in enough trouble as it is.

     That's it Ol' WDB! Have a great day and keep up the good work!

     Signed: The Region12 Nodelist Clerk!

                    "Information Please"

     When I was quite young, my father had one of the first telephones in
     our neighborhood.  I remember well the polished, old case fastened to
     the wall. The shiny receiver hung on the side of the box.  I was too
     little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with fascination
     when my mother used to talk to it.

     Then I discovered that somewhere inside the wonderful device lived an
     amazing person her name was "Information Please" and there was nothing
     she did not know. "Information Please" could supply anybody's number
     and the correct time.

     My first personal experience with this genie-in-the-bottle came one
     day while my mother was visiting a neighbor. Amusing myself at the
     tool bench in the basement, I whacked my finger with a hammer.  The
     pain was terrible, but there didn't seem to be any reason in crying
     because there was no one home to give sympathy.  I walked around the
     house sucking my throbbing finger, finally arriving at the stairway.

     The telephone!  Quickly, I ran for the foot stool in the parlor and
     dragged it to the landing.  Climbing up, I unhooked the receiver in
     the parlor and held it to my ear. "Information Please," I said into
     the mouthpiece just above my head.  A click or two and a small clear
     voice spoke into my ear.

     "Information." "I hurt my finger..." I wailed into the phone. The
     tears came readily enough now that I had an audience.

     Isn't your mother home?" came the question. "Nobody's home but me," I
     blubbered. "Are you bleeding?" the voice asked. "No," I replied. "I
     hit my finger with the hammer and it hurts." "Can you open your
     icebox?" she asked.  I said I could. "Then chip off a little piece of
     ice and hold it to your finger," said the voice.

     After that, I called "Information Please" for everything.  I asked her
     for help with my geography and she told me where Philadelphia was. She
     helped me with my math.  She told me my pet chipmunk, that I had
     caught in the park just the day before, would eat fruit and nuts.
     Then, there was the time Petey, our pet canary died.  I called
     "Information Please" and told her the sad story.

     She listened, then said the usual things grown-ups say to soothe a
     child.   But I was inconsolable. I asked her,"Why is it that birds
     should sing so beautifully and bring joy to all families, only to end
     up as a heap of feathers on the bottom of a cage?" She must have
     sensed my deep concern, for she said quietly, "Paul, always remember
     that there are other worlds to sing in."

     Somehow I felt better. Another day I was on the telephone.
     "Information Please."  "Information,"  said the now familiar voice.

     "How do you spell fix?" I asked. All this took place in a small town
     in the Pacific Northwest. When I was nine years old, we moved across
     the country to Boston.  I missed my friend very much.  "Information
     Please" belonged in that old wooden box back home and I somehow never
     thought of trying the tall, shiny new phone that sat on the table in
     the hall. As I grew into my teens, the memories of those childhood
     conversations never really left me.

     Often, in moments of doubt and perplexity I would recall the serene
     sense of security I had then.  I appreciated now how patient,
     understanding, and kind she was to have spent her time on a little
     boy.

     A few years later, on my way west to college, my plane put down in
     Seattle.  I had about half-an-hour or so between planes.  I spent 15
     minutes or so on the phone with my sister, who lived there now. Then,
     without thinking what I  was doing, I dialed my hometown operator and
     said, said, "Information Please."

     Miraculously, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well.
     "Information."  I hadn't planned this, but I heard myself saying,
     "Could you please tell me how to spell fix?" There was a long pause.
     Then came the soft spoken answer, "I guess your finger must have
     healed by now." I laughed, "So it's really still you, " I said.  "I
     wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time.
     "I wonder," she said, "if you know how much your calls meant to me. I
     never had any children and I used to look forward to your calls."

     I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and I asked
     if I could call her again when I came back to visit my sister.  Please
     do," she said.  "Just ask for Sally."

     Three months later I was back in Seattle.  A different voice answered,
     "Information."  I asked for Sally. "Are you a friend?" she asked.
     "Yes, a very old friend," I answered.  "I'm sorry to have to tell you
     this," she said. "Sally had been working part time the last few years
     because she was sick.  She died five weeks ago."

     Before I could hang up she said, "Wait a minute.  Did you say your
     name was Paul?" "Yes, Ireplied."  "Well, Sally left a message for you.
     She wrote it down in case you called.  Let me read it to you.  The
     note said, "Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in.
     He'll know what I mean."

     I thanked her and hung up.  I knew what Sally meant. Never
     underestimate the impression you may make on others.  Whose life have
     you touched today?

                    Ol'Codger's Column
                   wdbonner@pacbell.net

                     RULES OF THE AIR

     1. Every takeoff is optional. Every landing is mandatory.

     2. If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger. If you pull
     the stick back, they get smaller. That is, unless you keep pulling the
     stick all the way back, then they get bigger again.

     3. Flying isn't dangerous. Crashing is what's dangerous.

     4. It's always better to be down here wishing you were up there than
     up there wishing you were down here.

     5. The ONLY time you have too much fuel is when you're on fire.

     6. The propeller is just a big fan in front of the plane used to keep
     the pilot cool. When it stops, you can actually watch the pilot start
     sweating.

     7. When in doubt, hold on to your altitude. No one has ever collided
     with the sky.

     8. A 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away. A 'great'
     landing is one after which they can use the plane again.

     9. Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to
     make all of them yourself.

     10. You know you've landed with the wheels up if it takes full power
     to taxi to the ramp.

     11. The probability of survival is inversely proportional to the angle
     of arrival. Large angle of arrival, small probability of survival and
     vice versa.

     12. Never let an aircraft take you somewhere your brain didn't get to
     five minutes earlier.

     13. Stay out of clouds. The silver lining everyone keeps talking about
     might be another airplane going in the opposite direction. Reliable
     sources also report that mountains have been known to hide out in
     clouds.

     14. Always try to keep the number of landings you make equal to the
     number of take offs you've made.

     15. There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing.
     Unfortunately no one knows what they are.

     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 13                   6 Nov 2000


     16. You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of experience.
     The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of
     luck.

     17. Helicopters can't fly; they're just so ugly the earth repels them.

     18. If all you can see out of the window is ground that's going round
     and round and all you can hear is commotion coming from the passenger
     compartment, things are not at all as they should be.

     19. In the ongoing battle between objects made of aluminum going
     hundreds of miles per hour and the ground going zero miles per hour,
     the ground has yet to lose.

     20. Good judgment comes from experience. Unfortunately, the experience
     usually comes from bad judgment.

     21. It's always a good idea to keep the pointy end going forward as
     much as possible.

     22. Keep looking around. There's always something you've missed.

     23. Remember, gravity is not just a good idea. It's the law. And it's
     not subject to repeal.  Avoid "Mile High Club" and Turtles.

     24. The three most useless things to a pilot are the altitude above
     you, runway behind you, and a tenth of a second ago.

     25. Lastly, ALWAYS check the runway number, then double check!

                         *LINUX  OS*
                       By Janis Kracht
               1:2320/38 (janis@filegate.net)

     Though many of us have converted our Operating Systems, bbs software,
     echomail tossers, and mailers to new ones many times, changing one's
     setup to run under Linux can be perhaps more challenging than anything
     else ever experienced <smile>.

     Hopefully this article will be of some help if you have just switched
     to Linux, or if you are about to do so. I'll show you some comparisons
     between DOS and Linux so that you can see that Linux isn't as foreign
     as it might at first seem, and then I'll provide some scripts that
     I've written to perform various functions on my bbs system.  Lastly,
     I'll also include a few notes regarding some things you should _make
     sure_ do when you install linux. Security under Linux is a very large
     topic however, so I will cover that in more detail in a later article.

     First off, let's look at some commands that you might commonly use
     under DOS, and their Linux counterparts.  As you'll see, there are
     some commands that do not have an equivalent under DOS (i.e., I'm not
     counting DOS GNU utilities, etc. since these are not generally part of
     the standard DOS distribution.)

     Tip: It would probably be a good idea to type 'man command', or 'info
          command', or 'command --help' without the quotes to see all the
          options of these Linux commands.
     ====================================================================

     ls -d .*                  Show only "." directories.  (these are often
                               configuration files, etc. for various
                               programs).  The -d indicates that only the
                               directory name should be shown, not the
                               contents.
     ls -ltr                   Sort by date, reverse order.
     ls --color=auto           Turn on color for file types in directory

     File Management
     ====================================================================

     touch              touch              Set the timestamp on a file
     del                rm -f              Delete a file
     type               cat                Print a file to the screen
     n/a                chown              Change ownership of a file
     n/a                chgrp              Change group ownership of a
     file attrib        chmod              Change access permissions of a
                                           file
     rawrite            dd                 Write directly to a device
     subst?             ln                 Create a link to a file

     Some Linux examples:
       mv firstdoc.txt seconddoc.txt    rename firstdoc.txt
       mv /janis/*.txt /afiles          move *.txt to directory afiles.

     Tip:  When moving groups of files with the same filename, such as
           mv *.tic *.bad, you must specify a different directory. To move
           files such as *.bad to *.tic, you can use the script in this
           article, mvbad2tic.

     ====================================================================
     Aliases
     ====================================================================
     You can tell the system to use aliases of the commands you use.

     Enter these in your /etc/profile to make them global or
     ~/.bash_profile to make them local.

     alias del='rm'
     alias copy='cp'
     alias move='mv'
     alias ren='mv'
     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 17                   6 Nov 2000


     alias type='cat'
     alias rd='rmdir'
     alias md='mkdir'
     alias help='man'

     You can also enter them on the command line, just for that session. If
     you type: alias md='mkdir' you can then use md instead of mkdir.

     ===============================================================
     tar/gzip:
     ===============================================================
     Tar and gzip are used commonly on Linux.  Often you'll see archives
     with tgz extensions, .gz, or no extension at all.  You can use the
     file command to see how the file is archived/stored if there is no
     extension or if you are just curious:

     [bbs@filegate bbbs]$ file ZPMF025D.TGZ
     ZPMF025D.TGZ: gzip compressed data, deflated, last modified: Thu
     Jun 8 04:55:16 1995, max compression, os: Unix

     So you'd need to un-gzip this file first, then un-tar it.

     gzip -d ZPMF025D.TGZ

     This results in the file ZPMF025.tar

     To list the contents of the tar file, type tar tf filename.tar To
     extract the tar, type tar xf filename.tar
     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 20                   6 Nov 2000


     There are options to "keep old files" with both gzip and tar which you
     may also want to include on the command line.  The default action is
     to remove the original tar. See tar --help, and gzip --h for more
     info.

     This shortcut extract both the tar and gzip files in one command:

     tar xvzf filename.tar.gz

     The "z" flag says "un-gzip before un-tarring".  The same flag works in
     reverse when tarring.


     ===============================================================
     Some BASH Scripts
     ===============================================================

     One of the neatest things about *nix systems is that any file can be
     made executible by simply changing the attributes of the file. Of
     course, if the text file doesn't have any useful commands in it, it
     won't "do" anything <smile>.

     Here are some scripts I've written  for my bbs - none of these contain
     any startling ideas, and I don't doubt a number of them could be done
     better, but you can feel free to modify them as you like or need. info
     bash will show you the system's man pages for these scripting
     keywords. To use these scripts, save them to a file and then make them
     executible with 'chmod a+x filename' without the quotes. To call them
     you can type 'sh filename' without the quotes, where filename is the
     name of the script. Again, scripting is a very broad subject ... looks
     like I will be writing yet another article concerning that subject
     later :)

     =============mvbad2tic====================
     #!/bin/sh
     # the above must be the first line in the script.

      do
       f=`basename $file .bad`.tic
       mv $file $f

     Next, mvfile2in.sh move files from a users inbound.
     It uses another file you must create named dirlist.
     dirlist contains the names of your users' home directories which will
     most likely be the same as the username.

     You can create this file with the command: dir /home/* -1 > dirlist
     Edit it to remove other entries you don't want, like ftp, etc. which
     may be in the /home directory.

     =======mvfile2in.sh======================
     #!/bin/sh
     cd /home/bbbs
     # move files from a users' inbound to the bbs' inbound
     # tests to see if user is online before moving anything.
     cd /home/bbbs
     for f in `cat /home/bbbs/dirlist`
      do
     if ps aux | grep ^$f
        then
        echo "===user $f online==="
     elif test -e /home/$f/*/*.bsy
     then
          echo "$f bsy-flag exists"
     else
      echo "===safe to move files from $f==="
      mv /home/$f/in/*  /home/bbbs/inbound
     fi
     done
     =================end mvfile2in.sh==================

     get_desc can be used to import file descriptions to a files.bbs or
     descript.ion type file list.

     #!/bin/sh
     # import file_id.diz to files.bbs or descript.ion type file

     ==============================================================
      Some Install Concerns for the SysOp Installing Linux
     ===============================================================
     The first concern is pretty simple.  When you log into your system it
     will be very tempting to login as root, or the superuser, because user
     root has no limitations, can run any program, read/write any file..
     and ...also can delete every single file on your system <g>. Issuing a
     command like rm -r from the / directory as user root will surely go
     through the entire directory tree and do just what you told it to do
     (rm -r deletes recursively... <ouch>. )

     Of course there will be times when you must log on as root to do
     things such as install your apache web server, configure your ppp
     connection, etc., but that is really the only time you should log in
     as root. Likewise, you should never log in as root in XWindows as user
     root, except as above.  XWindows can destroy your data if you are user
     root and are playing with commands.

     _Big_ Tip: Use the adduser command to create other users on your
     system which you can use on a daily basis. To add a user, as root,
     type:

       adduser username

     where username is the name you have selected, 8 characters or less.
     Linux will let you use longer names for the users, but will truncate
     them.  The adduser command adds the user to the passwd file in
     /etc/passwd, and unless you specify otherwise, creates a directory off
     /home which is that user's 'home' directory. These limited-access
     users can only harm the files they own in their home directory.  Next
     you assign that user a password with the passwd command by typing:

       passwd username

     The passwd command prompts you for this users' password, 8 characters
     or less since again it will be truncated if it's over 8 characters.
     The password you choose should be a combination of upper and lower
     case alpha characters and numbers.

     Tip: Try to make the password something that means something to you,
     then use the letters of the words to make up your password.  Here's an
     example of what I mean ...

     I love Chocolate cake I'll take two thanks = IlccIt2t

     The last section of this article is pretty important.  With the number
     of systems online 24/7, these issues cannot be ignored.  If you think
     your system is safe from those who would test and probe your system
     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 23                   6 Nov 2000


     for ways of gaining illegal entry, think again.

     Tip: After installing linux, the very first thing you should do is
     pull up your favorite text editor, and edit the inetd.conf file which
     lives in /etc (/etc/inetd.conf). _Comment out_ every single line in
     that file except for the one that refers to ftp if you figure to use
     ftp. If you think this sounds drastic, well, it is. And it's
     necessary.  If you leave the file as is, you are leaving an incredible
     number of ports and services open to trouble-makers who will (most
     likely) be port-scanning your system over and over again looking for
     weak points. You probably won't need any of the services you are
     commenting out - and some of them, like rlogin, are incredibly famous
     for having holes where hackers can gain access to your system.

     Tip: Use ssh, (Secure Shell) instead of telnet. Comment telnet out
     from inetd.conf. If you think are going to need telnet so that you can
     telnet into your system remotely, DON'T.  Use Secure Shell instead. If
     Secure Shell isn't already on your system, go to http://rpmfind.net/
     and download and install it.

     Tip: If your distribution of linux installs wu-ftpd, install a
     different ftp daemon, such as Bero-ftpd, or Proftpd.  Why the switch?
     Well, Wu-ftpd has been known over the years to have holes where creeps
     can gain illegal access to your system.  Technically speaking these
     holes are plugged with new releases, but ... in general it is a good
     idea to install one of the other daemon's mentioned.

     Tip: All of the above is good, but don't rest easy yet.. Another thing
     you must do is contantly stay aware of upgrades to the software you
     use.  If, for example, a new version of bero-ftpd is released, install
     it.  Upgrades under linux are not always done to make the software
     prettier or sexy <g>.  The site that maintains the software you use
     will always post what type of upgrade the software is and whether it
     is a security upgrade.

                 Smart NFL Quarterbacks
     Barry Switzer, clearly upset about the Dallas
     Cowboys' losing record, decides to find out from
     Steve Mariucci what his secret is. So Switzer
     travels up to a 49er practice and asks Mariucci,
     "Coach, how is it that your team is so good?
     What's your secret?"

     Mariucci responds by calling Steve Young over.
     "Steve, who's your father's brother's nephew?"
     Young answers, "Why coach, that's easy: it's me."
     Mariucci turns to Switzer and says, "That's the
     secret, Barry: a smart quarterback. You've got
     to have a smart quarterback."

     Thinking he's finally got all the tools he needs,
     Switzer returns to Texas and the Cowboys workout.
     He promptly calls over Troy Aikman. "Aikman!
     Who's your father's brother's nephew?"
     Troy looks perplexed, thinks a minute, then asks,
     "Coach, can I get back to you on that?"
     Switzer, disgusted, says, "O.K."

     During practice, Aikman calls over Deion Sanders.
     "Deion, coach just asked me the weirdest question".
     Deion asked, "What was that?"
     "who's your father's brother's nephew?"
     Sanders replies, "Duh! That's easy. It's me!"
     After practice, Aikman catches up with Switzer.
     "Coach, I think I've got it. My father's
     brother's nephew is Deion Sanders."

                              Hot Air
     A man in a hot air balloon realized he was lost.  He reduced altitude
     and spotted a woman below.  He descended a bit more and shouted,
     "Excuse me, can you help me?  I promised a friend an hour ago I would
     meet him, but I don't know where I am."

     The woman replied, "You are in a hot air balloon approximately 30 feet
     above the ground. You are between 40 and 41 degrees North latitude and
     between 79 and 80 degrees West longitude."

     "You must be a Republican," said the balloonist.

     "I am," said the woman, "but how did you know?"

     "Well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is
     technically correct, but I still have no idea what to make of your
     information, = and the fact is I am still lost. Frankly, you've not
     been much help."

     The woman below responded, "You must be a Democrat."

     "I am," replied the balloonist, "but how did you know?"

     "Well," said the woman, "you don't know where you are or where you are
     going. You have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot
     air. You made a promise which you have no idea how to keep, and you
     expect me to solve your problem.  The fact is you are in exactly the
     same position you were before we met, but now, somehow, it's my
     fault."

       George loves the race track. One day he was there betting on the
     ponies and nearly losing  his shirt when he noticed this priest who
     stepped out onto the track and blessed the forehead of one of the
     horses lining up for the 4th race.  Lo and behold, this horse - a very
     long shot - won the race.  George was most interested to see what the
     priest did the next race.  Sure enough, he watched the priest step out
     onto the track as the 5th race horses lined up, and placed his
     blessing on the forehead of one of the horses. George made a beeline
     for the window and placed a small bet on the horse.  Again, even
     though another long shot, the horse the priest had blessed won the
     race.  George collected his winnings and anxiously waited to see which
     horse the priest bestowed his blessing on for the 6th race. The priest
     showed, blessed a horse, George  bet on it, and won! George was
     elated.  As the day went on, the priest continued blessing one of the
     horses, and it always came in first. George began to pull in some
     serious money, and by the last race, he knew his wildest dreams were
     going to come true.  He made a quick stop at the ATM and withdrew
     every penny he owned, and awaited the priest's blessing that would
     tell him which horse to place the bet on.  True to his pattern, the
     priest stepped out onto the track before the last race and blessed the
     forehead, eyes, ears and hooves of one of the horses. George placed
     his bet - every cent he owned and watched the horse come in dead last.
     George was dumbfounded. He made his way to the track, and when he
     found the priest, he demanded, "What happened, Father? All day you
     blessed horses and they won.  The last race, you bless a horse and he
     loses.  Now I've lost my life savings, thanks to you!!" The priest
     nodded wisely and said, "That's the problem with you Protestants ...
     you can't tell the difference between a simple blessing and the Last
     Rites!"

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================

     =======================================================
             Question, How does God communicate?
                        Brenda Sez...:)

     "The Lord has a way of revealing those of us who really know Him and
     those that don't!!   Think about it!"

      Al Gore gave a big speech this past week about how his
      faith is so "important" to him. In this attempt to convince the
      American people that we should consider him for President,
      he announced that his favorite Bible verse is John 16:3.

      Of course the speech writer meant John 3:16, but nobody in the
      Gore camp was familiar enough with scripture to catch the error.
      And do you know what John 16:3 says?

      John 16:3 says,"AND THEY WILL DO THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE
      NOT KNOWN THE FATHER NOR ME."

      "The Holy Spirit works in strange ways and has a
      great sense of humor!!!"

     I think it would be very valuable for you to make such software list
     available in a Section named "Fido Software List" by Jim Barchuck,
     along with instructions for novices on what it is, what it does, and
     how to install and test to get a BBS up and running...  What do you
     think?

     Re: Fido Softeare list


     Hello Warren!

     Hibackatcha ol'pal,

     As far as 'tutorial', I am not the right person to write that. I only
     ever used one mailer, one bbs, and pretty much one of everything else.
     So that's all I know about, and even that is years out of familiarity.

     For software that I have web links to I assume that the site has some
     sort of support. Any software by name and version with a brief
     description of its abilities that may be used to develop more BBSes
     was my original con cern from emails asking me questions I don't know
     how to answer as Imail, RA and Elebbs & Binkd is all I have.

     If anyone suggests another 'useful site' about software, insallation,
     running, I can certainly add that link somewhere. Hey, good deal...

     Regarding 'list', I don't quite understand what you mean. I was
     thinking along the lines pf a master list of all that is availible
     with a description to include in the Snooze for many looking for such.

     If you mean a mailing list, that might be a good idea.  There was a
     onelist list that faded out of use. But if this is a
     software-support-specific list it might attract attention. Shareware
     or commercial, just to get the information out to would be newbbies
     and others that would be inspired to upgrade.

     If there are other fido related mailing lists out there I'd link to
     them. Perhaps this letter entered into the next issue will draw some
     links for you! <G>

     If you mean a kind of 'list of other interesting sites', there are
     already plenty of lists like that already out there. But a cool idea
     FIDONEWS 17-46               Page 29                   6 Nov 2000


     might be a user-submitted links list, CGI driven. Take me a while to
     work that out but I'll think about it. It's a good database project
     and I need practice with that. Now that's a winning ticket!  Lets run
     this up the flag pole and see if anyone salutes.

     Have a :) day!

      jb You too Jim, you give a lot to Fido being the Webmaster, and html
     mailer. Don't know if anyone pauses to say Thank you, Jim, but I do!

     ol'wdb
