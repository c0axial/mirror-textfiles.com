     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hello Ruth!

     DS>> His region went from being non-influential due to it's low number
     of sysops to being equally influential in spite of it's low number of
     sysops. Is that a good thing? Probably not. But maybe once and for all
     this network will settle on dying it's death via P4, or realizing it
     cannot afford to cling to it's past like a dinosaur and evolve into a
     real Sysops' network.

     ED: Why can't the RCC decide things by majority if they want to???
         I keep reading they all have to agree or it is no go on ANY vote.
     Why? Because some one put into P4 that it could not be changed? That
     is not logical and if only one RC objects to the will of the others,
     why don't you say, "You are out voted"!  What could s/he do about it?
     How is it one region's vote is worth more than the other nine regions?

     RA> I think this was an excellent post, Darrell, and certainly should
     cause some people to stop and think. I really can't add anything to
     it, you did cover it very well.

     RC> The absence of a clear cut ZONEWIDE election POL or a ZONEWIDE any
     POL certainly isn't helpful.

     ED: Stewart did that, unfortunately several misunderstood some
     postings and it fell apart.

     RC> I think you have at some point in the past looked over the
     regional policy document for region 18? As you can tell, there is no
     ambiguity regarding how many situations are dealt with, especially
     regarding elections and all the other tangibles.. It is a very well
     written document, written as a result of the finest tradition of
     Fido-war-athons during its adoption.

     RC> Surely you can agree, or I hope you can, that in the absence of
     clear cut zonewide guidelines that no matter what would or could have
     been whipped up in a pinch, someone would have been "upset". You know
     one option in this current situation was to appoint an interim and
     have the general election later, how many would have been "upset" over
     that notion, not to mention all worked up over whomever may have been
     FIDONEWS 17-51               Page 2                   11 Dec 2000


     appointed the interim?

     ED: Maybe too many cooks in the Z1C kitchen. All of this could have
     been avoided had the present ZC appointed a Pro-Tem Z1C with a March
     deadline for a completed election.

     RC> The catch-22 here is you can please some of the people some of the
     time, you cant please all of the people all of the time.

     ED: So go with the majority, be it Sysops or their RC. There are two
     or more sides to everything in life, in war, in politics, and in Fido.
     IF this is a sysop organization, then listen to the majority of the
     sysops. IGNORE those that want to do otherwise, for they have their
     own selfish interests at heart, and not the will of the sysops.

     RC> Well after all of this is over, we need to adopt some sort of
     formal zonewide election guideline or document or whatever so that we
     can be prepared for these scenarios... Instead of pissing away
     valuable time bitching about the what-if's like what we did this time.

     ED: Agreed!

     RC> For if I had been the one to resign as R18C, by 01/05/2001, my
     region would have known what to do, how to do it, and when to do it
     without a single question and before anyone asks, the region 18 policy
     document was ratified by the sysops of this region via a sysop level
     vote.

     ED: Could it be extended to cover all Zone one Regions? Could the Z1C
     send it to the RCs for ratification in their region?

     RC> So when work commences on a zonewide document and I will strive
     for one, regardless if I get elected Z1C or not, be prepared for
     varying ideas, lots of arguing and throughout the process nothing set
     into stone until the sysops of the zone agree to what's in it. Fair
     enough?

     ED: Fair enough. Should be easy to adopt any region's sysop ratified
     policy for the business of any region. If it is good for one region,
     then it is good for all as they all work in fidonet to move the mail.

                       My article for Fidonews...
                       by Gary Gilmore 1:2410/400

     Beware the "Saviours".

     In Fidonews Vol 17, No.50 (Dec. 04, 2000), Lesley-Dee spews forth some
     of her choice verbal turds, something she does as a hobby when she's
     not being a professional insinuator and part-time "saviour of
     Fidonet". For those that don't know what a "saviour" is, it's someone
     that knows what you need, knows what you should think, and has no
     problem telling you, because all of the rest of us poor old sysops are
     just too dang dumb to know what's good for us.  If you're not "smart
     enough" to listen to these "saviours", they'll beat you over the head,
     start name-calling you, and generally hound you until (they hope)
     you'll just give up, or join their little clan and mindlessly parrot
     what the other "saviours" in this little group say.  (If you don't,
     don't worry... they'll just turn on you next.)

     Let's take a little look into the toilet and see what turds Lesley
     (the saviour) Dee has dropped, shall we?

     LDD>  THE BENEVOLENT ELFLORD Dallas Hinton - This guy believes that he
     knows what his region wants, and needs, and he will take care of it
     for them.

     That's funny... she's here trying to make Dallas look bad with the
     above claim, but here she is, telling YOU what's best for YOU, and
     trying to take care of it for you.  How very nice of her.  Hmmm...
     should Dallas' region listen to him or to her?  What a quandary.  Of
     course, since Lesley knows all, and IS an official "saviour of
     Fidonet", Dallas' region should probably listen to her diatribes, er,
     commands, umm, I mean "suggestions", right?

     LDD>    THE WOULD-BE ELFLORD Janis Kracht

     Ahh, now here we have the favorite little name these saviours like to
     use... "elf-lord".  Funny, I don't know any elves in Fidonet, but I
     guess you all must be, since the "saviours" like to call you that.
     (Personally, I'm 6' 3", so I'm hardly an elf.  How about you?)

     LDD> This gal believes just about everything Dallas believes

     How about that!  Lesley is a mind reader!  She apparently has the
     ability to know what others (whom she has no dealings with, nor is
     even in the same region with, let alone net) think and feel! Stunning,
     isn't it?  Well, it's nothing for a "saviour".  Wait'll she walks on
     water, folks.  It's worth the price of admission!  (Don't mind the
     scuba gear though, since sometimes "saviours" can only walk on water
     when you're not looking.)

     FIDONEWS 17-51               Page 4                   11 Dec 2000


     LDD> She was trained by Elflord-for-Life Martin Belcke

     Funny... I can't remember Martin training ANYone for ANYthing here in
     Region 11.  Even stepping up as Temp RC11, it was pretty much "here's
     the stuff, have a nice day".  Not much training there.  <laugh>  I
     greatly appreciate the other RCs who helped me get up to speed with
     some of my new duties.

     LDD> who recently resigned his Elflord

     You folks aren't really "elves", are you?

     LDD> position in Region 11, turning the reins over to his best buddy
     Gary Gilmore.

     "Best buddy"?  Not every having met Martin in person, I wouldn't know
     who his "best" buddy is, but I somehow wouldn't think it'd be me. He's
     certainly not MY best buddy.  That position is currently held by my
     wife. My second "best buddy" lives nearby, and keeps trying to get me
     to take a job with him at Unisys.  My third best buddy is probably the
     NEC of the net I'm in.  My 4th though 37th best buddies are guys I
     work with currently, or have done tours with.  So much for her
     implication.  Well hell, I guess even a "saviour" can be wrong once in
     a while.  It's hard work saving us all from ourselves.  (I consider
     Martin a "friend" though.  He's always been quite a nice guy, and
     pretty straight up, at least in our dealings and discussions.  Nothing
     at all like a "saviour".)

     Of course, our "saviour" forgets to mention that Martin asked the Z1C
     about having me take over as Temp RC11 first, and that the Z1C OK'd
     this.  Now, it doesn't read as well when you leave this part in...
     kinda blows the whole "smokey back room" and "conspiracy" thing, so
     our "saviour", like all good little "saviours" leaves a little real
     truth out of their version of the "truth".  Hey, you gotta hook the
     readers when you're trying to bullshit 'em, so your garden variety
     "Fidonet saviour" isn't above bending the truth, or even leaving truth
     out completely.  <shrug>

     LDD> In five months, Gary has not been able to "manage" to pull an
     election together

     Yep.  100% right.  I haven't.  I've been too busy trying to clean up
     the massive amount of dead nodes, help nets replace MIA NC's, busy
     helping ALL R11 nets get connected to each other (via our regional
     echoes), get netmail flowing again, and in general, getting R11
     cleaned up, connected, and making sure they're all taken care of.  I'm
     sorry.  I guess I should have left all the dead nodes in, called an
     election (with links broken all over the region) and then called an
     election.  Yep, I guess that's how the "saviours" do it. Of course,
     I'd rather see R11 be informed, able to discuss things amongst
     themselves, and do an election in a region where everyone can get
     netmail, regional echoes, and even backbone if they want it.  I sorta
     think communications is the cornerstone of being able to hold a proper
     election. I guess I shoulda consulted with the "saviours" first.

     Gee, sorry if I've been sandbagging.  I invite anyone in Region 11 to
     FIDONEWS 17-51               Page 5                   11 Dec 2000


     complain if I've been taking too long for their tastes.  Of course,
     our "saviour" Lesley fails to notice (after all, she "knows all",
     right?) that I asked the region if they wanted to wait until after the
     Z1C election was over, and no one objected.  Of course, that's
     probably not good enough for the "saviour" crowd, but gee... I'm not
     lucky enough to have any "saviours" in my region. We're all just a
     bunch of sysops who want to enjoy our hobby. Guess that makes us bad
     elves, eh?

     LDD> (his latest excuse is that there is a Z1C election on, so the
     region cannot have an election at the same time

     Yes, our saviour has caught me.  I lied.  There's no Z1C election
     going on. I just said that to hang on to this wonderful position a
     little longer. <laugh>

     LDD> Janis turns to Gary for help on all matters that are over her
     head

     Hmmm, our "saviour" seems to be slipping again.  I can't recall Janis
     asking me for help in a long time.  If it was about anything, it would
     have been regarding the FileGate, and was probably something minor. (I
     do remember helping her with our routing chart, only because I was
     hooking up nets, and finding dead nets... there's that pesky
     communication stuff again.)  Of course, when you're trying to tar &
     feather someone, you just cast out any old accusation you like.  Don't
     matter if it's true or not.  Just say it. This is Fidonet, and they're
     the "saviours".  They MUST be right.  They don't need facts to back up
     their accusations.  Just fling 'em and see if anyone believes you.
     It's the "saviour" way!

     LDD> Gary is the asshole who filed a policy complaint against Net 163
     for providing a node number to a node in Malaysia when there was no
     other way for him to be in Fido.

     <chuckle>  "No other way", except the teensy neglected mention that I
     contacted the RC of the area where this Malaysian node should have
     been listed (before doing anything), and the RC was more than happy to
     give this node a regional independent listing.  Funny... it doesn't
     sound as compelling when you mention this fact, so our "saviour" just
     neglects to mention it at all. You can't be a "saviour" *and* be
     truthful, don't you know.  (Note how our "saviour" turns to name
     calling up there?  Makes it easier to spot "saviours" that way.  I'm
     sure I'm supposed to be terribly torn up being called "asshole".  I'll
     go cry now.  Boo hoo.  There, I'm better now.  <ROFL>)

     LDD> Janis is expected to lean on Gary for support for a while, then
     get full of herself and throw him off.

     Ooh, look!  Our "saviour" is a fortune teller too!  Is there nothing
     (besides telling the truth) that our "saviour" Lesley can't do?  We
     should genuflect in her presence.

     If *any* Z1C candidate thinks I'm going to hold their hand, they'd
     better smell the coffee.  If I wanted to deal with Z1C issues, I would
     have run for the position myself.  I don't, so I didn't.  Of course,
     FIDONEWS 17-51               Page 6                   11 Dec 2000


     our "saviours" DO want to deal with Z1C issues, they're just too darn
     smart to need to run for the position.  (Remember the old saying?
     "Shit or get off the pot"? Seems most of our "saviours" are
     super-glued to the seat!)

     LDD> When she figures out that she is not capable of handling the
     position, and does need help after all, she will turn to Dallas
     Hinton, and he will end up controlling the zone.

     Ah, how nicely we see Lesley (our "saviour") wrap this up to attack
     two of the candidates she likes the least by somehow tying them
     together.  Funny though... this election was declared a "sham" by
     "Saviour Lesley" and her fellow "saviours"... if that's the case, they
     sure like to spend a lot of time trying to sway everyone to their
     thinking over a "sham".

     (I have to wonder... does our "saviour" think us elves are stupid
     enough to believe her wild claim above for a minute?  Folks, just
     shows ya how little the "saviours" respect you, and how they think
     you're all too stupid to notice their lies and scare tactics, and
     will, like sheep, just follow them to the Fidonet promised land.)

     LDD> Since Janis objects strongly to any hint that Region 11 should
     have an election for RC, do not expect to ever be bothered with an
     election for Z1C again if she wins.

     Hmm, let's see.  Janis "objects" to a RC election, so that means no
     Z1C elections?  Howzzat again?  Seems our "saviour" showing us how
     stupid she thinks we all are with yet another wild claim.  I'm
     surprised she didn't toss in something like "and Janis will then raise
     your income taxes" as well. <laugh>

     But anyway, I guess our "saviour's" crystal ball was broken on the day
     that Janis offered to help run a RC11 election, and how she helped
     contact nets and nodes to get everyone in R11 connected so that we
     could do an election properly.  (However, I'm looking outside R11 for
     an election coordinator, just to make things as "hands off" internally
     as possible, and to make it harder for our "saviours" to call "foul!"
     on an election that doesn't concern their region anyway.)

     LDD> THE KISS-ASS ELFLORD Ross Cassell - This mail mover does not see
     a conflict of interest between mailmoving and nodelist clerking.

     Ah, here we are.  If you volunteer for ANYTHING in Fidonet, you can't
     do any other thing.  Funny that our saviours don't look into the
     nodelists and see that most people do double and even triple duties
     anymore.  Why?  Because (and it's they're right to do so), other
     sysops just want to sit back, get their mail, files and echos, and
     nothing beyond that.  SOMEone has to get these things.  SOMEone has to
     tend to the nodelists, weed out dead nodes, find new willing NCs for
     nets where the NCs have just vanished without notice.

     (Note that our "saviour" doesn't seem to mind that the RC12 is also
     the REC12, which means he's doing this "mailmoving and nodelist
     clerking" that "Saviour Lesley" seems so vehemently against.  That's
     up to Region 12 IMHO, but it is interesting that it doesn't seem to
     FIDONEWS 17-51               Page 7                   11 Dec 2000


     bother her, no?)

     But, our "saviours" command that we do ONE JOB and only ONE JOB in
     Fidonet, so some of the rest of you better get ready to do more,
     because your "saviours" command it of you.  (Notice this though...
     most of the "saviours" don't really do much of anything in Fidonet,
     other than command you how to think, how to act, and what to do.)

     LDD> My suggestion is that the first place vote go to Ross, and the
     second place vote to Dallas.  Janis is the biggest threat to Fido I
     have seen in a long time.

     Don't be fooled.  This is a backhanded endorsement.  All this really
     says is "I command you to vote for Ross because I hate him the least".
     I'm sure Ross is thrilled with an endorsement from someone like our
     "saviour".  (He probably flinched when he read it.)  I have faith that
     those in Fidonet (those that aren't "blessed" enough to be "saviours")
     are smart enough to recognize axe-grinding when they see it, and will
     give our "saviour's" recommendations the respect they deserve.  (Which
     is, umm... none.)

     Now, MY suggestion? ...beware the "saviours".  Beware those that will
     beat you over the head endlessly, screaming and ranting in any echo
     where they can corner you.  These "saviours" practice innuendo,
     half-truths, micro- dissection of anything someone says (so they can
     better twist it), outright lies, unfounded implications and pretty
     much whatever they can in order to "scare" you, the "elves" to whom
     they like to refer.  Their weapon is "FUD"... Fear, Uncertainty,
     Doubt.

     If they can't scare you into seeing things their way, they'll hound
     and bully you.  They'll call you names, they'll make fun of you, try
     to belittle you. (Which is, after all, just another version of
     bullying.) It's the "do it/see it our way, or else".  Hmmm... for a
     bunch of people (who we know as "saviours") that preach how they want
     a "free Fidonet", and how they want "Fidonet for the sysops", it's
     certainly interesting to see how they all treat their fellow sysop
     when he or she DARE to disagree with their party line.  Try it for
     yourself and see.  Just jump into any of the gutters of Fidonet where
     they accumulate, and disagree with their stances. Wear a helmet
     though, since they'll be clubbing you too quickly for you to put it on
     later.

     I'm sure (or at least I have faith) that the sysops in Zone One know
     better. They know better than to let a little band of childish bullies
     push them around.  They know better than to be swayed by intimidation,
     name calling and the other childish antics of our "Fidonet saviours".

     I hope that the sysops of Zone One vote according to their gut
     feelings, and what they learned in the HONEST exchanges the candidates
     had with those that WEREN'T trying out to trip them up.  These
     candidates are volunteers in a hobby, and deserve a round of applause
     for even being willing to take the amount of bullshit that our
     "saviours" would heap on them just for volunteering, not BEING Z1C,
     just volunteering to.  Notice that our "saviours" sit there tossing
     turds at the candidates, but can't be bothered to run for the position
     FIDONEWS 17-51               Page 8                   11 Dec 2000


     themselves and show us all how it should really work.  Armchair
     quarterbacks.  Back seat drivers.  They know how it should be, but
     can't be bothered to get up and DO anything for us, other than
     browbeat, insult, attack, lie, imply and use cheap innuendos.

     I don't care who anyone votes for in the Z1C election, because
     frankly, I think all three can do the job well.  Beware the "saviours"
     though, since they're the real enemy to the well-being of our hobby.
     They're the ones that are so busy "saving" sysops right out of the
     nodelist with their attacks and innuendo, and "saving" sysops out of
     the nodelist when sysops get sick and tired of all the screaming and
     hollering and name calling that they seemingly do 24 hours a day.

     Beware the "saviours".

     had some others on his side.

     Perspective, Warren. Do you think I am so young, naive, and/or
     inexperienced to not have been on both sides of most issues at one
     time or another? You might be surprised. I've sat in on private
     executive boards and been part of decision making processes that
     affected many hundreds of people and many hundreds of thousands of
     dollars. Real-life experiences affecting real-life people and issues.
     I know what it is to compromise and negotiate. I know what it is to
     say "enough" to negotiations. I've made tough decisions, some right,
     some wrong, but I've made them and accept responsibility for them.
     It's a question of being true to yourself and deciding just who it is
     you serve. Win or lose the battle, if you look yourself in the mirror
     in the morning and can say you did the right things as best you could,
     you've won. I have no regrets. But this is Fidonet, a hobbyist's
     network. No one's real-life livelihood, savings, pension plan,
     property, citizenship, or personal freedom is at stake. There is no
     good reason for the RCC doing what they did from a Sysop perspective.
     On this much I hope we agree.

     WB> You can't spit into the wind, and get your attending pals
     adoration, they will turn their back to you everytime and wipe their
     faces in disgust.

     Perspective, Warren. I can assure you I am not the only sysop that
     feels that that is exactly what has been done to us. Are we supposed
     to adore the people that spit in our faces and turned their backs on
     us after we elected them to a position of being able to do just that?
     Hardly. Are we supposed to continue to turn the other cheek year after
     year after year? Hardly. Some people will always go with the status
     quo. Some people will never care enough to do anything about
     injustice. These people deserve exactly what they get. But some people
     push back. Some people refuse to be intimidated and bullied and taken
     advantage of. Call us whatever you like, but I consider them the salt
     of the earth.

     RW> Why wouldn't a majority of sysops be able to handle that chore?

     Where is the new document that will lead us into this new sysop
     nirvana?

     BD> Very few of the sysops want to be bothered. They just want their
     mail.


     RW> Good idea. However, having only *Cs working on it guarantees it'll
     be the same policy as the wankers have now.


     BD> I don't believe that for a minute. You are so used to spouting the
     same old rhetoric, you sound like a broken record.  People do change
     their ideas over time if the input is reasoned. When it is denigrating
     or insulting, it's ignored even if the ideas are worthy of thought.

     BD> Look how David M. got the IONs accepted. Now it's normal, then it
     was new with all sorts of naysayers. People do change. You quote your
     old archives as if the ones writing back then don't ever change or
     modify their ideas.

     BD> That's a good reason for not relying on old archives for this sort
     of thing. I've seen many a node come around to a different way of
     thinking. You aren't going to get them to do that or see your point of
     view by being an asshole.

     BD> Remember the outcry when I put Net 211 up?  I hardly ever hear
     about it now. Lots of loud outrage that I would dare to do such a
     thing. It was against p4, motherhood and who knows what else. Net 211
     goes it's quiet way still.

     the brick walls and innuendos, etc.. For one, I welcome reasoned

     BD> I was on the phone for an hour last night talking about EMO nodes
     and the 5000 and 5001 documents. I may not always agree with folks,
     but I will listen. Some folks I won't listen to. They don't know how
     to debate an issue without being insulting. Once a sysop gets that
     rep, few will listen and be willing to have a discussion with them. If

     Jerry Schwartz said in Fidonews echo: "I'm one who is opposed to
     opening up the echo. It is my firm belief that an RC needs a place
     where he or she can say something stupid to the other RCs without
     seismic consequences".

     There have been plenty of messages posted in Z1REGCON that were
     ill-considered and subsequently ignored, withdrawn, or argued away.
     That becomes much more troublesome when any thoughtless remark can
     start a firestorm.

     It was with this in mind that I brokered the compromise with Mike
     O'Connor which remains in place: an RC can cross-post his own words,
     or any message directly and specifically relating to his Region, and
     can paraphrase any discussion he choses; but directly cross-posting
     the messages of an other RC beyond those boundaries is forbidded
     without permission.

     own private echo to do their laundry and iron out the wrinkles in,
     free of interference and unnecessary advice from others not elected to
     do their regions work.

     Of course the Ed has to report all sides fairly and unbiased, giving

     To: Dale Ross
     Re: Changing FidoNet
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     MG> The present election rules do not "force" any form of a vote on
     any region. Were it a zone-wide sysop-level vote, that /would/ be
     forced on all regions without recourse. That is the important
     difference. If there is to be one option and one option only,
     the RCC *MUST* be unanimous in accepting it, because of the fact
     that there are *no* other options available. The present rules, not
     imposing any particular format on any region, does not require
     unanimity because many options are still open to each
     region. It only denies the zone-wide sysop level vote, but does not
     deny regional sysop-level votes, or NC or RC represented votes.

     DR> I understand that the RCC must be unanimous. That is one
     of the flaws in the system that will prevent change. I
     do not know how this can change either. A policy for Zone
     1 could be written that would create a better system.
     However, there is a little problem there... that a Zone
     policy would have to be passed by the Zone 1 RCCs and it
     would have to be a unanimous decision.

     MG> Debatable... I think as long as regions are allowed to have their
     own regional/net policies, it doesn't have to be a unanimous vote in
     the RCC for a zone policy (as there are other options available to a
     disagreeing region, unlike the zone-wide sysop vote idea..) In fact,
     it states in the P-4.07 document that only a majority of RC's within
     the zone are needed to initiate a policy referendum. The referendum
     itself determines whether the new policy is adopted.

     DR> I can live with-in what we have. What do we really use this medium
     for anyway? Echomail. Yes there are still some systems that
     communicate via NetMail only. They do not use nor have Internet
     connectivity. So a big question concerning change. How would it really
     impact how we use this medium? The only fear that one has today is
     that a slap happy *C could remove a listing from the NodeList.

     MG> One thing about the shrinking nodelist in Zone 1; it makes this
     sort of thing a lot more noticable and harder to keep quiet. In the
     days when Fidonet was a lot larger, it was hard to keep tabs on
     everything that was going on. I doubt any *C attempting this sort of
     thing today would get very far with it, and certainly it would not
     carry on for nearly as long as a Bob Kohl type of incident did.

     DR> So we get a sysop-level Zone wide vote. What did we really get? We
     are assured that the Z1C is our popular choice. But once we have this
     Z1C what do we get? Even if he/she is the best person out there how
     does our hobby change? That is the real question for a candidate to
     answer.

     MG> Sadly, this is the most important question of all, but largely due
     to the bickering and suspicions about the process, it's been
     overlooked in this election. My line of questioning to the candidates
     was aimed at finding out who would be the best choice. Many others
     just chose to attack the candidates over their own personal views and
     support of one form of vote over another. That's a waste of time IMO,
     and time is something I don't have much of these days.

     been through several Z1Cs. The only things that I can point my finger

      A college professor asked his class a question.
     "If Philadelphia is 100 miles from New York and Chicago
     is 1000 miles from Philadelphia and Los Angles is 2000
     miles from Chicago, how old am I?"

      One student in the back of the class raised his hand and
     when called upon said "Professor you're 44.."

      The Professor said "You're absolutely correct, but tell
     me, how did you arrive at the answer so quickly?"

      The student said. "You see professor, I have a brother,
     he's 22, and he's half nuts."

     Re: Z1C Election rules
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                         ZONE 1 COORDINATOR ELECTION - 2000

     The Z1C has announced an election, for a new Z1C. Per Policy4, the ZC
     is elected by the RC's under them.  It is the choice of the RC's to do
     this by the following method per P4 section 6.2.

     A Z1 Sysop is defined as any Sysop who is nodelisted in Z1 and
     physically located within the normal geographical boundries of zone 1.

     The nodelist used will be the nodelist.322 version.  Reasonable
     exceptions will be made during the nomination phase by the election
     coordinator if a node, net or region is accidently dropped from this
     version and this is validated by the RC or NC of the affected node.
     The term 'nodelisted' means listed in this version of the nodelist.

                              Nominations

             Nominating time table: NOV 17-25, 2000
             All dates start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 PM EST

     Any nodelisted Z1 Sysop of Fidonet may nominate themselves or another
     nodelisted Sysop of of Z1 Fidonet for the position of Z1C.  The
     nomination must be made in the Z1_Election echo and should be
     addressed to the Election Coordinator.

     The nomination must include the name of the nominee and their Fidonet
     node number.

     Once a nomination has been received by the election coordinator, the
     name will be added to the list of nominees.  The nomination must then
     be accepted by the nominee and seconded by a Z1 Sysop in the echo to
     become a fully eligible candidate.

             Discussion Period NOV 26- DEC 02, 2000
             All dates start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 PM EST

     Following the nomination period, a period shall be allowed for each
     candidate to campaign for the position.  During this period,
     questioning of the candidates is encouraged.

             Regional Feedback Period  DEC 03-16, 2000
             All dates start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 PM EST

     Following the campaign period, the above period shall be allowed for
     each region to conduct selection proceedings in accordance with
     regional policy and such methods as are determined as appropriate
     FIDONEWS 17-51               Page 20                  11 Dec 2000


     based on regional policy or the desires of the Sysops within that
     region.  All voting or other feedback including what is desired if
     there is a run-off election and the primary candidate your region
     selected is eliminated, must be concluded no later than 16 DEC.  No
     time is alloted to conduct secondary polls of regional input once RC
     voting commences.

             Regional Coordinator Voting - DEC 17-22, 2000
             All dates start at 00:00 and end at 11:59 PM EST

     Following collection of regional input, the RC's shall cast their
     vote. (Location TBD at this time).

     Initial voting will be from 17-18 DEC.  The candidate with the most
     votes, wins.  This will be calculated by a simple majority where if
     any one candidate receives 6 RC votes, they will be announced as the
     winner.  If no candidate achieves 6 RC votes, a run-off election will
     take place from 19-20 DEC between the top 2 candidates.

     Contesting of the vote will take place from 21-22 DEC.  Once finalized
     and with no RC's contesting the vote, the results will be posted in
     the Z1_ELECTION echo.

     Note, this section may be ammended after the initial Z1C election
     process has begun, in order to finalize the location of the RC votes.

             Term begin/end: Turnover date to May 2003

     Upon completion of the election, the newly elected Z1C's term begins
     as soon as turnover can be accomplished but no later than 5 January
     2001. Due to early turnover, the normal 2 year period will be extended
     5 months and end May 2003.  This is in order to avoid mandating a vote
     over the holiday season in 2 years.
