========================================================================
Here we are in FidoLand once again. What's the diff' 'tween the
snooze, and most other papers, aside from its unsuitability for
wrapping garbage neatly?:  That's entirely up to all of us.

..read recently of an older echo being used interestingly
as a medium for cooperative creation.  Apparently some
dadaist-minded Frank Zappa enthusiasts are spinning tales into
echos for their and others' amusement...makes me wonder what
will become of "the" artistic ego, when it is shared freely
among many.  What happens when artistic movements happen inside
a REALLY FAST medium with no cencorship?

...a reminder to excitable capitalists:  FidoNews still does
*not* publish commercial advertisements.

The current conflict in the former Yugoslavia has given rise to
Europe's worst humanitarian crisis since World War Two:

                     50,000 Rape Victims
                        150,000 Killed
                 3,000,000 Displaced Refugees

The "Former-Yugoslavian Relief Effort" is a grass-roots, non-
profit, non-partisan humanitarian organization sponsored by the
Palmetto Project.  It was established May 1, 1993 as an
emergency response to the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia.

Thus far, various hospitals in the Charleston community have
made generous donations of medical supplies.  The "Former-
Yugoslavian Relief Effort" hopes to gather a total of 32,000
pounds of medical supplies, food and other vital essentials.

The supplies will be distributed by the International Rescue
Committee based throughout the former Yugoslavia.  The target
date for shipment is mid-August.

The "Former-Yugoslavian Relief Effort" needs material donations
as well as monetary donations in order to purchase additional
medical supplies which cannot be donated.

HAM Radio operators may send and recieve Internet mail providing the
message text is in keeping with the Internet guidelines and FCC
rules. (Mail is not read by myself unless the mail is undeliverable
-- please: no sensitive mail should be sent; we're not a private
environment here.)

Send packet mail to KC6EFH@WB6YMH.#SOCAL.CA.USA.NA.  Within the
message text include a "To: " keyword follwed by the Internet
address. Save the message and that's all that is needed.  (Before
you send mail, by the way, send a message to WB6YMH expressing
gratitude at allowing KC6EFH to gate from his system.)

Send Internet mail to packet@f890.n102.z1.fidonet.org.  Within the
Internet message text, include a "return: " keyword followed by the
Packet address. (All messages from Packet to Internet have the
"return: " keyword provided by the gateway software automatically so
that the Internet Destination User will know the Packet address the
message came from.)

Messages from Packet which do not have a valid To: statement anywhere
in them will be returned to the Packet operator.  Messages from
Internet which do not have a valid return: statement anywhere in them
will be returned to the Internet operator.  In either case, the
reason for the bounce will be commented upon. All Packet mail which
was undeliverable by the Internet Host will be returned to the Packet
Operator  with  an  explanation.  All Internet mail which was
undeliverable by the Packet Host will be killed and never heard from
again.

If you're interested in the Gateway software being used, download the
file PAK-UUCP.ZIP from The Skeptic  Tank  1:102/890.0  (24hour

version is to be started after much more testing within three to four

weeks and will be available for download under the same name. This
file contains the source code as well as an executable which will
probably do you no good as the software is very specific as to the
Packet Host systems User Interface.

CD_BST *

On both the CD_Echo and the Music echo, the selling of your CD's isn't
allowed by the moderators... CD_BST has been created just for that.
CD_BST stands for CD's (and records and tapes and VCR tapes, and laser
discs, etc) Buying, Selling, or Trading. If you're looking for
something that's out of print, only available in Germany,or is just
plain hard to find write a message. If you have something that's out of
print, only available from across the pond, etc, write a message. The
echo is for general information, as well. If you have a complete (or
not so complete) discography of a band, and someone wants to know about
something, you're more than welcome to list it.

The echo is currently flowing through a few systems across the US, and
is available to everyone. If you'd like to link up to it, Netmail me at
1:209/216 and we'll set you up.

Commercial ads are also welcome... (certain restrictions apply, not
valid in every state, minors must get parents permission, actual price
may vary, etc)

For more info, NETMAIL Gulliver Flynn @ 1:209/216 or FREQ CDBST from me.

An Open Letter to Joe Sysop
David Stark
@rochgte.fidonet.org or
1:2613/322.

In regard to the article entitled "No Privacy Or Safety For
Sysops" in issue 1024 of Fidonews -

First, there were too many capitalized words in the title. :-)

Second, how does anyone expect the Fido community at large to
take an article such as that one seriously? "Joe Sysop" indeed.
Where is this incredible breach of privacy and the Constitution
(if he/she is located in the USA) taking place?  Does "Joe
Sysop" have a legitimate beef? Then why are the location and
identities of the agencies involved being concealed?

FidoNews 10-25                 Page:  5                    21 Jun 1993

If the story is true as related, I should be seeing it on
"20/20" or "60 Minutes" or "Inside Edition" as a classic case of
illegal search and seizure.

Maybe "Joe Sysop" is really guilty of some crime and is taking
out his anger at having been caught by writing inflammatory
articles for Fidonews. How about it, "Joe"? Care to tell us who
and where you really are, and which Sheriff's Department has so
blatantly violated your Constitutional rights?  You cite the
Steve Jackson Games case. Is your attorney familiar with the
ruling? What is your real problem?

Perot Echo Grows, New Conferences Added

by Dave Stoddard
Status of Fidonet PEROT Echo

Hello FidoNet!

Since its inception last year, the PEROT echo has enjoyed remarkable
growth. Designed as a place to have constructive conversation about
the future of this country and how to fix its problems, we are
currently active in 32 states and 129 BBS's around the country.

We are pleased to announce that two new 'sister' conferences to PEROT
are available.

As listed in ELIST305, the UWSA and GOV-REFRM conferences are now
flowing. Distribution is not backbone at this time, but our hope is
that they will be soon.

UWSA is dedicated to the United We Stand, America movement, founded by
Ross Perot. It is a place to discuss UWSA, and to receive news and
announcements.

GOV-REFRM is a discussion area for the reform of American Government.
It is intended to be non-partisan and constructive.

These conferences are available via an arranged feed. Contact the
following for more information:

        Modem Type      Name            Address

The H-Net RAP!

By Jason Garneau 1:325/304
The H-Net Rap!

H-Net, H-Net, is something to see,
Many people talking here to you and me.
Ask anyone who has seen us,
Even you best freind Gus,
What is this H-Net about?
Gus will say without a doubt,
H-Net is the net of handles,
and people who love to wear sandles.
They have areas to talk about sports,
And an area to enquire about local forts.
People come from all over the world,
to the Pary room, where so many have hurled.
Everyone has fun,
even past quarter to one.
All that's required to join is your local Sysop,
Or if that's you, fill out the form, Easier than drinking soda pop!
Then you can prove Gus is right,
H-Net, is the net for tonight!

You will be using it instead of watching TV at 8.
Good-bye for now as we go,
We realised we never said "hello"
Too bad, I say, right now,
Please, man, don't have a cow!

The Global Community

The Global Community - A Step in Social Evolution
by Alexander Vollmer (2:247/202.0)

Close your eyes, give your brain a kick and leave your body for
a little journey into cosmic space. But stop near the moon, look
back and recognize that little brown, grey and blue ball. Yes,
that's the Earth, a small planet and a nip of cosmic existence.
Now you are prepared, go back and think about email as an
important step on the way from isolated citizenship to global
community.

If you cover the node number, there is little chance to detect
the geographic origin of a message nor the nationality, religion
or gender of the writer. And most people act in that manner,
ignoring all these differences, except that messages must belong to
the subject of the echo. Fidonet is a real success of social
evolution. We all should appreciate that; it's part of real life
outside the virtual reality of FidoNet.

But where are the schools, sister city commitees, and others?

Are they in FidoNet? Do they have their own network?

Do they use email networks to communicate and to come closer?

Lets look for these people and ask them to join the networks.
Talk to your teacher, relatives in foreign countries and contact
your business partners all over the world.

We need help from our administrations to get the possibilities
of free communication between the third world and the existing
networks. Many countries restrict the free use of phone lines
and prohibit the uncensored exchange of messages. In additional
a couple of countries control the messages and punish the
senders for unliked messages.

Thats a violation of human rights!

Its against the charter of the United Nations!

Let us write a letter to the president, prime minister or who
ever is the leader of your country and tell him to act against
this discrimination.

Think of the large increase of russian nodes since the dawn of
FidoNews 10-25                 Page:  8                    21 Jun 1993

glasnost and the active participation of many nodes in the free
world. A small number of nodes is to blame for each nation not
willing to give their people free access to free communication.

I hope the way to the global community is not as long as the way
from here to eternity. We can shorten that way in helping the
third world join FidoNet and spreading free and uncensored
communication arround the world.

Another way to prohibit free communication are high phone rates,
but that's another story.

note from Tom Jennings

Can you forward a message to that author the one that just got busted?
Simply tell 'em to contact the EFF. If that's a problem, I can do it if
he can't (I presume the author's male). I'll preserve the authors
anonymity (I swear) if it's even necessary for me to have it at all
(with them willing of course).

They can call voice, in DC. I believe the Boston office is closed/moved
now. "Electronic Frontier Foundation" or email me.

I forwarded that fidonews to eff@eff.org with a short note.

Law and Order Echo

There's a new echo out there on the Backbone. Known as
LAW_&_ORDER, it's roots run deep on the Southern Coast of
Oregon. This echo started out years ago on a local Bulletin
Board and involved a Trooper with the Oregon State Police
answering questions relating to law enforcement and the law in
general. After initial good sucess on this small Bulletin Board,
the echo was revamped to be geared towards Demand Reduction, a
fancy title to put out current information on the use and abuse
of narcotics and dangerous drugs. Approximately two years ago,
the Moderator decided to try and expand the echo and so was born
LAW_&_ORDER. The echo was then picked up at the local community
college and has had a permanent home there ever since.

In the two years it has been running, the idea of the echo has
remained the same. To disburse current information to both
police officers and civilians alike in the things that touch
most all of us sooner or later. Examples of this are ways to
protect your children, ways to protect your home, discussions on
the "War on Drugs", Fish and Wildlife laws, discussions of motor
vehicle laws, general law and other topics relating to law
FidoNews 10-25                 Page:  9                    21 Jun 1993

enforcement in general. Police Officers involved have enjoyed
researching topics and answering questions asked by other
participants.

The echo has expanded throughout Oregon, into Washington,
Arkansas, Louisiana and others. The Moderator has received
requests for this echo from numerous others in States not yet
receiving it. It is anticipated that Backbone support will
greatly expand the participants and the discussions. Currently,
the echo has participants with a wide variety of views and who
express them very well, indeed.

Those wishing to participate in a lively echo are invited to
check out LAW_&_ORDER. As with police work itself, the Moderator
guarantees you will not be bored. We look forward to hearing
from you and discussing most any law enforcement topic you care
to throw out.
