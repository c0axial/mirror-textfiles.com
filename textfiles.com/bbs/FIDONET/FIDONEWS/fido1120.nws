                              Editorial
========================================================================
Hello dearest fidolanders!  It's nice to see so much in the inbound
this week.  Thank you.

If the mail we get reflects the general mood of Fidolanders
[Fidoland: expanding association of sovereign states each containing
one individual?], not too many of us like censorship.  This makes me
happy...  but i do value being educationally upbraided by mail.
The snooze needs to truly reflect all opinions. The thing in the
boilerplate saying "newspapers should have no friends" is necessary.

There's some people downstairs jamming with a tuba, a banjo, and a
guitar, being eagerly watched by a little boy wearing a mask from
the house toybox.  I think it's neat when people just try things.
They're not playing particular songs, they haven't played with each
other before, they're not trying to prove anything; they're
experimenting to see what happens.  The little boy is accustomed to
people being creative and non-judgemental around him, and happily
plays by inventing his own games.  I wonder what he would do with a
computer.

It's interesting when people play this way in echos.  Has anyone
gathered conversations from echos and/or chats, and edited them into
play scripts?  Multi-media stuff wouldn't necessarily have to be
high-tech and expensive to be interesting.

i don't understand the article about compression.  i guess i'll
keep learning, then eventually i'll get it.  sigh.

I like the article about "living languages".  I think it is well
expressed and sensitive, even though it wasn't written in the
author's native tongue.  I tried to "correct" small spelling and
grammar "mistakes"  in one article because its author asked us to.
This should be simple, right?  Nope.  Language is full of nuances
and syntax is as complicated as spiders' webs.  I found it
impossible to change anything without worrying that i was
miscontruing intended meanings.  It is not our job to tell you what
to say.

Language Is a Living Matter

 by Ronald Hass (2:240/5311) Hamburg, Germany

 I am now part of the FidoNet community for about 2 years and
reading FidoNews for about one year. Although being just another
user and thus not listed in the nodelist I hereby dare to throw in
a few words which every now and then cross my mind when
encountering another of "those articles".

 The articles meant are the ones that complain about the nasty bad
language that certain people dare to use in FidoNews. Is it really
that bad after all? And what is "bad language" anyway?

 Our language - and this means every mother tongue that is spoken
on this planet - is a living matter and hence changing continuously.
It reflects the culture with all its ups and downs and the people
living within it. It cannot be clinical clean and I rather would
not like it to be. There have been several attempts in history to
force language into specific channels by certain governments. The
reason was always to chain and brainwash the people. Ten years
after Orwell's 1984 still nobody in the world brought it to that
final scenario he outlined in his novel, thank God.

 So there still are four-letter-words and other stuff of that kind
in it and there belongs a certain place to it. But I think the
bare use of them does not make up a so called bad language. It is
always the context and the way in which these words are used. In
that one year of my readership of FidoNews I never found what I
for my part would call really bad language. And to ban certain
words does not make them disappear, does it?

 The most used reason for complaints is that FidoNews is read by
children. People want a "family type" of FidoNews. Let me tell you
a short story which explains best what I am going to say.

 I remember myself as a child of about three years coming from the
playground and asking my father, what in the world an a**h**e is.
I had been called one by another child but never heard the word
before. Instead of shouting at me and forbidding to ever use this
word again my father took time and explained not just the mere
part of the body it stands for =:-) but the context in which it is
usually used to give me a feeling for the word. Henceforth I knew
when to use it and in which situations it is better to use a
synonym with - lets say - more anatomical meaning. Much more
important though was that in the future I was able to interpret
the chatter of other people and react in the right way.

 Things like that happened quite often in my childhood and I still
am thankful to my father having given me explanations instead of
prohibitions. He rather teached me feeling for the language and
the use of it.

 I sometimes suspect that parents fear to give those explanations
FidoNews 11-20                 Page:  4                    16 May 1994

to their children. I promise you: they get into contact with so-
called bad language anyway. It is a lot easier to say "You are too
young, dear. This is nasty, you'd better forget it." than
explaining the place of a word in the complicated system of a
language with all its facettes. But on the other side in my
opinion it is a lot easier to explain the word pussy in certain
contexts than words like holocaust or genocide. Would you call
those bad language? Give it a try, think about it!

 To make it clear: I am not encouraging people to use that type of
language here in FidoNews or anywhere else. But the way it has
been used in this publication up to now in my opinion is not that
bad that it should be banned or censored. It sometimes just calls
for explanation to younger children and parents should provide
them with it. It always has been the type of eye-twinkling tease
which normally does not hurt the addressed person. I just call for
a bit more tolerance and fun in using language. There is a lot
more to it than just placing bare words from a dictionary in one
line forming a sentence. The sense in between the lines quite
often is even more important. Teach your children proper use of
the _whole_ of it rather than trying to leave the part out that
you do not like.

 And please stop to call for censorship in FidoNews, may it be
certain words or whole articles! I do not want to end up being
allowed only to use the phrase "doubleplusungood" instead of
"worst" or any other synonym of it (see Orwell's 1984). This
strips language bare of any fine tunes condemning it to state mere
facts without any emotional and personal nature.

 Finally I want to thank the editors for the good job they are
doing against all criticism and well meant advices how it should
be done. I apologize for any grammatical errors in this article
for English is not my mother tongue. I am still practicing and
learning from reading and writing on the FidoNet. =:-)

 Thanks for your attention.

Hacker Barbie

[original source unknown]

(LA, California) Mattel announces their new line of Barbie
products, the "Hacker Barbie." These new dolls will be released
next month.  The aim of these dolls is to revert the stereotype
that women are numerophobic, computer-illiterate, and
academically challenged.

This new line of Barbie dolls comes equipped with Barbie's very
own xterminal and UNIX documentation as well as ORA's "In a
Nutshell" series. The Barbie is robed in a dirty button-up
shirt and a pair of worn-out jeans with Casio all-purpose
watches and thick glasses that can set ants on fire. Pocket
FidoNews 11-20                 Page:  5                    16 May 1994

protectors and HP calculators optional.  The new Barbie has the
incredible ability to stare at the screen without blinking her
eyes and to go without eating or drinking for 12 hours
straight. Her vocabulary mainly consists of technical terms
such as "IP address," "TCP/IP," "kernel," "NP-complete," and
"Alpha AXP's."

"We are very excited about this product," said John Olson,
Marketting Executive, "and we hope that the Hacker Barbie will
offset the damage incurred by the mathophobic Barbie." A year
ago, Mattel released Barbie dolls that say, "Math is hard,"
with condescending companions Ken.  The Hacker Barbie's Ken is
an incompetent consultant who frequently asks Barbie for help.

The leading feminists are equally excited about this new line
of Barbie dolls. Naomi Wuuf says, "I believe that these new
dolls will finally terminate the notion that women are
inherently inferior when it comes to mathematics and the
sciences. However, I feel that Ken's hierarchical superiority
would simply reinforce the patriarchy and oppress the masses."
Mattel made no comment.

Parents, however, are worried that they would become
technologically behind by comparison to the children when the
Hacker Barbie comes out.  "My daughter Jenny plays with the
prototype Hacker Barbie over yonder for two days," says Mrs.
Mary Carlson of Oxford, Mississippi, "and as y'all know, she
now pays my credit card bill. Ain't got no idea how she duz it,
but she surely duz it. I jus don't wanna be looked upon as a
dumb mama." Mattel will be offering free training courses for
those who purchase the Hacker Barbie.

The future Hacker Barbie will include several variations to
deal with the complex aspects of Barbie. "Hacker Barbie Goes to
Jail" will teach computer ethics to youngsters, while "BARB1E
R1TES L1KE BIFF!!!" will serve as an introduction to expository
writing.

COLUMN_5 echo

from Anthony Grigor-Scott
     3:711/933 @FidoNet

I am seeking expressions of interest from Hubs outside Zone 3  who  may
be prepared to inport COLUMN_5 echo.

COLUMN_5 is available fron the Fido backbone in Zone 3.  Message volume
is  low.  However  the  content  is  serious  factual   discussion   on
international  and  national political, banking, and business scams, UN
affairs  and  their  involvement  is  the  New  World  Order,   various
conspiracies,  LETs,  organic farming, health/medicine, defence, crime,
etc., The echo carries letters and in-depth messages on  these  matters
from Australian Senators, Members of Parliament and relevant experts.
FidoNews 11-20                 Page:  6                    16 May 1994


Much  content  is news-behind-the-news the press refuse to countenance.
This echo inviting trivia, debate, or large volume, but is a venue  for
serious  discussion  and positive contribution from thinkers and doers.
Potential Hubs are requested to FREQ COLUMN_5.ARJ (222,166Kb)  so  they
may  review  the  last 150 messages, and read COLUMN_5.RUL.  One weekly
poll would sufficient at this stage of activity.

Thank you for your consideration.

Thank you kindly. We appreciate your efforts in behalf of the Network.

Kind regards,

Announcement of RTSOFT echo
by Carl Morris

Announcing the Robinson Technology Software  echo  on  fidonet
compatible systems!  This will soon to be the official support
conference for Seth Able Robinsons games: LORD (the Legend Of the Red
Dragon) and PLANETS: TEOS (PLANETS: The Exploration Of Space) door
games.

At current Seth is hooking up to FIDO, but I'm going to get this ECHO
going now.  The TAG of the echo will be RTSOFT. At current it will
originate from me at 1:285/302. Please netmail your info, and when I
get you setup I will route a netmail response back, so please let me
know if you can't be routed back (just the netmail acknowledgement!)

As the echo grows it will be available from other locations, and soon
from Seth Able's board itself.

This ECHO will contain, technical info on setting up the games, or
any of Seth's software to come, players tips, bug reports, and maybe
later a file echo which will bring the latest versions to you also.

At current this ECHO does not have the author's (Seth Able)
endorsement, but if I don't get it when available, I will bring in
what ever echo the author decides to accept.

Netmail Carl Morris at 1:285/302 about RTSOFT echo today!
Carl Morris of Hooper Connections at 1:285/302.

Complaints in previous issues acknowledged!
by Carl Morris

I am writing in response to 1119. Let this be known now, I am a
FidoNews 11-20                 Page:  7                    16 May 1994

member of NET_285. Another one, from the macintosh side of NET_285
was talking about older news, along with several others.

I hate how you guys (and gals) give no task too easy to the
programmer. I would love writing some interface programs for fidonet
technology net- works, but like where do I go to get the info. Right
now I have found I shall not go anywhere for this info 'cause it is
nowhere! The FIDONET technology needs to be wrote up in one common
place, and everybody adapt to it, even those CoCo users (I have one
too).

The 2.6mb nodelist IS TOO LARGE! It needs to be re-done at least. I
see a lot of error messages in it, and other things wasting space,
like duplicate entries just for description of a system (very few)
and duplicate phone numbers (one nodenumber per phonenumber is
enough!)

For the person about rip, and used the |0?S|0?H|0?I|0?T|0?.  Please
never do that again, Renegade BBS uses the |?? codes for color, and
the last one was | 00 and Renegade turned BLACK, and I could no
longer read this wonderful, err, letter, err, newspaper, err, I don't
know.

I also have a feeling about compression (like who don't?) FIDONET is
one of the few net technologies that can heavily use compression.
All mail can be compressed offline, so what the hell, please
compress!  The compression of zip or arj is much better than modem
compression. However, letting the modem compress that will provide
even better compression, from the structure of ZIP files. I also
don't care what compression, and would suggest that all compression
programs that are worth their compression ratios be accepted. (this
removes ARC from the list, its not worth its ratio!)

Hey, its your time I'm wasting, what do you have to say?

I have been making a "diff" of the backbone echo changes every couple
of months for several years. It is a convenient reference when you
get an inquiry about zero traffic in a echo that was renamed six
months before :-) Dan Buda suggested that I publish it in FidoNews.

    "Unless you have more than the usual fundie quorum of neurons
    still sparking, you probably won't comprehend this, yet the
    traditional insistence that so-called 'profanity' is the sole
    realm of the inarticulate is irredeemably flawed.  Not only
    is it true that some of those who use what you consider foul
    language are in fact intelligent and articulate, but your very
    own post quoted above is a clear demonstration that some of
    those who refrain from using what you consider 'foul language'

    I would very much like to suggest that you leave FidoNet, Scott,
    and return to High School where you might _learn_ how to _spell_
    such things as "wisdom."  Then you might be capable of twigging
    to the fact that words are not this mystical, magical claptwaddle
    you have been programmed to believe they are.

Subject: Recent Nightline

Hey Editor
I thought you might wan't to take a look at a letter we sent to some
of our local news papers yesterday...

I give permission to the newspapers to print this letter in whole if
they wish. I seek no compensation for this article/letter.

Infobahn Media Blues

     The  recent  media  blitz  concerning  the  "Super   Information
Highway",  AKA.  The  Infobahn,  has  every  newspaper, book, and TV.
channel covering it. Unfortunately the main systems  covered  by  the
media  are  big  systems  such  as  CompuServe,  America On-line, The
Internet, MCImail, Prodigy, & Delphi just to name a few.  The  media,
magazines, and all others tend forget about the BBS.
              The  BBS(or  Electronic  Bulletin Board) was one of the
first purveyors of public on-line access via modem. Lately the little
attention BBS's have been getting have been extremely negative. BBS's
have  been  touted  as  being  havens  for  porn  pushers  and  child
molesters,  which  rather  bothers  me.  Recently  on  an  edition of
Nightline, a story was done on BBS's that carry  adult  files  called
GIF's.  GIF  stands  for Graphic Interface Format. They way the story
was done on Niteline(as well as others done in the  past),  portrayed
all  BBS's in a bad light. This is a shame, as the local BBS has been
a foothold in the on-line industry for well over 15 years.
     Granted, like any tool, a BBS or on-line system  can  be  abused
and  misused,  but a few bad apples don't spoil the bunch. I begin to
wonder if anyone has ever taken a close look at the Internet? I  also
wonder  if people who frequent big on-line systems realize that there
is more Pornography, Piracy, and illegal on-line  dealings  going  on
there  than you could find on all the BBS's running across the world.
Has anyone ever checked out the alt.binary.pictures USENET  group  on
the Internet? Approximately 500 "Adult" files float through there per
day. There are several sites on the Internet that deal in nothing but
commercial pirated programs, as well as codes and cheats for them.
     People  should check out their local BBS. It can be entertaining
and productive just like the big boys. Most BBS's offer something for
everyone, some specialize in one area. Alot of BBS's are networked as
well, via a network called FIDO. With FIDO(yes, like a  dog's  name),
you  can  join  in open and private conferences ranging anywhere from
debating to chatting to in-depth computer discussions. There are well
FidoNews 11-20                 Page: 11                    16 May 1994

over  800 areas(or Echoes) available on FIDO. But that's not all! You
can also send private mail to anyone on FIDO , Internet,  or  prodigy
or  any other of the big on-line services. And usually for free! FIDO
is also not the only network out there, there is RIMEnet, WDNET,  and
several  others.  Most of these conference networks span the globe as
well. FIDO being the largest of the amateur networks, has  well  over
32,000  systems hooked up to it in the United States, Europe, Canada,
Asia, South America, Puerto Rico, Australia, and other countries. All
these  systems  are  not commercial, they are run by people just like
you and me who just want to enjoy the on-line  world.  They  pay  for
phone  costs,  equipment maintenance, upgrades etc.. out of their own
pockets just for the sheer joy of it.
     BBS's also carry alot of the same Shareware programs you find on
the  big systems. You can call up, download the available programs to
your own computer and use it. You can also find alot  of  friends  on
these  systems  as  well.  BBS's  are  a  virtual community of people
getting  together  and  sharing  shareware,  information,   technical
support  and  fun.  Some systems are large, some are small, but every
BBS has something to offer somebody at very little, or most often  no
cost except the phone call.
     But  back  to  the point of this longwinded statement. The media
has given the local BBS a bad name and it's time to let everyone know
that  most BBS's are good family entertainment for all ages. Yes some
carry adult material and those areas are usually restricted to people
over  18, and most System Operators(sysops) are aware of the possible
ramifications of adult material being distributed to  a  minor.  Most
systems  require  you to fill out a waiver and ask for a copy of your
ID. They also have security levels  that  completely  block  out  the
areas  to  minors  and  people who do not wish to see them. But other
than that they are fun. So take a look at  your  local  BBS.  If  you
don't  have a number for a BBS in your area(or anywhere else for that
matter) call  your  local  Computer  Users  Group,  or  your  nearest
computer  store.  They  invariably have numbers for the BBS's in your
area. So check it out, you might like it.
     Now you may be wondering why I wrote this, well, you see,  I  am
the  System  Operator  of  Image Gallery BBS in Pulaski, Pa. and I am
very concerned about my hobby being ruined by  the  media.  I  run  a
large  BBS  on  a  FIDO  network  and to it for the shear pleasure of
serving our community as well  as  the  surrounding  areas.  You  are
welcome  to  come check out our system and enjoy our services. You'll
make alot of on-line friends and have alot of fun. But don't let  the
media  fool  you, not all BBS's are criminal. The Internet has a heck
of alot more crime going on inside their systems than we do in  ours.
Don't crucify us.

A case for No .ARC!

By: Raul Almquist
SysOp, WALK in the SHADOWs of the NIGHT BBS
(612) 593-5100/5106/5107
FidoNet 1:282/105
-----------------------------------------
editor's note: 1:282/105 does not appear
to be in the nodelist ???
-----------------------------------------
InterNet Raul.Almquist@SpareCom.MN.Org

  I would like to state a HEAVY complaint about the FidoNet  policy  of
.ARC being the de-facto standard, what I would like to know is WHY?!!

  Then I would like to know is WHY is it STILL the de-facto standard?!!
Especially since PLATFORM PORTABLE source for ARC newer than  v5.2x  is
NOT available!

  I  would  also  like to know why if ARC is the de-facto standard that
FidoNews is sent out in a format other than ARC?!!

  Here IT is.

  I am a commercial developer of  more  years  than  I  like  to  think
about:-)  and  a  couple  of  years  ago I decided to embark on another
shareware endeavor...  a full-featured Mailer for the Macintosh, little
did I know there would be a MAJOR road-block in the development of such.

  I  am  to the best of my knowledge the ONLY Mac developer licensed by
SEA for ARC extraction source, and while I have received XARC source  I
have   NEVER   received  PORTABLE  XARC  source  nor  have  I  received
programming specifications for XARC, instead  I  received  source  code
that  was about 70% 80xxx specific ASSEMBLER which made the source less
than useful.

  For over a year (going on two) now I have talked with a  fairly  nice
person  named Irene who has repeatedly stated that I would be receiving
portable ARC source, and the last time I talked with her she  said  she
would  get  the  specs for the XARC, it has now been sometime and still
nothing.

  Currently the largest  portion  of  FidoNet  ARE  based  on  machines
utilizing  80xxx MPU's, while at the same time that portion of Fido has
available ARC v6.0x utilities as well as other ARC utilities,  and  the
fact of the matter is, that many if not MOST of that portion of Fido IS
using ARC v6.0x or newer (which is NOT Fido ARC spec compliant),  while
the  other  platforms  are  stuck with the LAST release of portable ARC
which is ARC v5.2x, which means that those of you lucky enough to  have
access  to  the newer ARC v6.0x or even v7.xx CAN and DO compress files
that the rest of us can NOT extract and it looks like we will NEVER  be
able to extract.

  I  have  even  dealt  with  a  SysOp or two that got indignant when I
FidoNews 11-20                 Page: 13                    16 May 1994

requested that they go back to a more compatible/compliant ARC  format,
now  this  only  happened a couple of times, but it did happen and even
once is one time too many.

  Now shouldn't  the  de-facto  compression  format  be  one  that  has
platform PORTABLE source available?  I sure think so!!!

  Currently  ZIP  has  easily  available  source  (and  specs) for both
compress & extraction, and while  I  know  ARJ  has  extraction  source
available I am not sure about compression.

  So  how  much  longer are the rest of the platforms (other than 80xxx
based) to remain in a "doghouse":-)???  how long do we continue  to  be
stuck   without   the   means   of   maintaining   cross-platform  mail
compatibility, how long???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  Lastly a complaint that is and is not a complaint:-)

  Why is it that THE NEWSLETTER for Fido is  distributed  in  a  format
that  is non-compliant with stated Fido policy, or is FNEWS exempt from
what the rest  of  us  have  to  deal  with?   Not  that  I  am  REALLY
complaining about this, as I KNOW I can extract .LZH files for reading,
unlike any files compressed with ARC v6.xx or newer.  --  SpareCom  BBS

A response to another would-be censor

by Shawn McMahon, 1:19/34
smcmahon@infomail.com
A response to would-be censor Scott Mccool

In his recent letter attempting to insult everyone who uses words Mr.
Mccool doesn't happen to personally like, he said the following:

> Anyone that lowers him self to useing 4 letter words in anytype of
> publication only shows his ignorants, lack of wisdome and knowledge
> to use the proper language to tell his point.

I'll ignore all questions of who the hell died and appointed him the
arbiter of what is or is not "proper language" and go directly to the
heart of the matter.

Mr. Mccool, "himself" is one word.  "Using" contains no "E."  "Any
type" is two words.  "Ignorance" is spelled as I've demonstrated here.
"Wisdom" also contains no "E."

Semantically, your sentence states that using 4-letter words (note the
hyphenation here) shows one's "knowledge to use the proper" etc.

I believe this pretty much sums up how seriously we should take your
attempts to "fix" our use of language.

FidoNews 11-20                 Page: 14                    16 May 1994

Oh, BTW; I counted five words of exactly four letters in your
above-quoted paragraph, counting "type" and excluding "self."

Do try to use the proper language to tell your point next time, won't
you?

How does it feel being on the receiving end of insults regarding use
of language, Scott?  Perhaps you'll consider this next time you put
figurative pen to page.

ECHO MANIA!!
by Chris Cancilla, 1:375/64

    "Welcome new SysOp!  Enclosed in  your  welcome  package  is  a
current  list  of the FidoNet echo's, and the local echo's that you
can pick up as a new node in net xxx."

    These are the words enclosed in the FIRST message that most  of
us received when we bacame SysOp's.  Some a long time ago, some not
so long ago.  But this is the reason most become a SysOp of a  BBS.
Instantaneous  access  to message traffic, echomail, netmail; and the
ability to discuss a wide variety of interests with others.

    There are a number of echos that everyone enjoys  reading  and
utilizing; conversly, there are those echo's that are...not limited,
but of interest...to a few.  Each day someone comes up  with  a  new
topic  to discuss, starts a local echo about it, sooner or later it
ends up on the backbone.  I realize this is a  simplified  process,
but this is not an in depth review on creating your own echo.

    I  belong  to  a  few different networks: FidoNet, TrekNet, and
AcNet.  I started 3 echo's in TrekNet and quickly passed on two  of
the moderator positions to others.  Sitting here thinking about it,
I can  come up with a  few  echo's  that  I  am  sure  others  have
considered,  but not acted on.  For example, the SCUBA echo.  Where
hotel advertizments from places like the  Caymen's  and  such,  and
other divers sharing their experiences world wide, came be the base
for discussions.  I have contemplated starting this  echo,  but  do
not  think  I  have  the  time to moderate another echo.  I want to
share my experiences diving in Keflavik, Iceland; and  how  wonder,
although chilly, the diving really is in the land of Fire and Ice.

    I  can  think  of  other,  but  this is my point exactly.  If I
created this echo, there would be a number of users on BBS's  world
wide  that would be interested in what I had to say.  Perhaps there
is a BBS in Iceland that did not know about a spot I  found  there.
My  experiences  in  Iceland  would  enhance their experience, even
though they may be a native, and I was there for 2 years  with  the
Air Force.

    I  am  sure  that you, the reader, are wondering if I am for or
against creating new echo's and adding them to the backbone.  Well,
FidoNews 11-20                 Page: 15                    16 May 1994

I will not tell you.  BUT, what I will tell you is this;

       1)  Creating new echo's is a priviledge and not a right.
       2)  It should not be abused.
       3)  The creation of a new echo should have a wide enough
           topic for nearly all audiences.
       4)  More echo's mean more money shelled out each month
           by SysOp's in long distance, or Cost Recovery, charges.
       5)  More echo's mean users can spend more time reading, or
           replying, on a topic that has their interest.

    I  am  neither  for or against the current echo mania going on.
New echo's are popping up all the time, and old echo's are going by
the  wayside.   Perhaps  I  need  to  look at it in the sense of an
evolution.  New replaces the old, ect. I receive a number of echo's
on,  and  not on, the FidoNet backbone; and I am always looking for
something new to peak a hidden interest in this hobby of mine.....a
BBS System Operator.

    Thanks  you  for  taking  the time to read this dissertation.  I
hope that I at least gave you something to think about.

    See you in the echo's.........

Dear Emilia Postmadam

Q:  I've become addicted to net mail.  If i have no mail, I go
rangy.  I need my mail.  What should I do?

A:  Net mail socialization is similar to other forms of partying.
You must remember that your correspondents are *people*, many of
whom like to escape to their computers in a manner similar to
relaxing in pleasant, physically present company.  No-body likes
to read rangy, imploring mail.  Perhaps you should consider only
writing letters when you have something to say that you think
others want to hear, when you are corresponding socially.  If you
are in a rangy mood, either be creative and *happy*, or wait until
you calm down and feel good to write letters or post messages, unless
your correspondents are masochists and enjoy being tormented.

Q:  I'm very impatient to know everything about Fido Net.  But
things change so quickly, it seems that by the time I learn how to
do something, the methods for doing things have changed.  What
should I do?

A:  Keep on truckin'.  You will find that although details change,
methodology is fairly consistent.  Particular bits of software
quickly become obsolete and new utilities emerge at a frantic pace,
but basically the same tasks are accomplished.  The mail still moves
around.  Even the way snail mail travels is similar to Fido Net mail
routing.  True, you have much to learn, but Fido Net is endlessly
FidoNews 11-20                 Page: 16                    16 May 1994

fascinating and will entertain your mind for years to come.

Q:  My friends think I'm wierd because I spend all my time playing
with my computer.  They say that because I like computers, that I am
anti-social.  What should I do?

A:  Your friends may be afraid of computers.  Not everyone is used
to them.  Do you think your friends are anti-social if they spend
all their time using a telephone?  It is a ridiculous that
fascination with a machine used for enabling communications as well
as other socially beneficial things, could be considered by anyone
to be "anti-social".  Stop worrying, and invite your friends to
some BBS parties.

Q:  Why do governments spend our money on T1 lines, then censor
newsgroups at some sites?  Isn't "government" supposed to spend our
money on us?

A:  Dear, it is not considered to be good judgement to ask such
questions, although in some circumstances propriety has nothing to
do with actual politelness so I do not have a professional opinion to
offer you.  I only know about ettiquette.  Politics and etiquette
are not the same.
