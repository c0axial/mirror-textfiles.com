                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                              Filling the Gap

     Let's  face  it.  As  forms of communication go,  electronic mail
     falls short.  We are all very much used  to  supplementing  words
     with tones of voice,  facial gestures,  and body language.  It is
     quite possible to communicate fully by the written word,  but few
     of  us  are Shakespears or Hemmingways.  It takes a great deal of
     skill and practice to fully express oneself by the  written  word
     alone.

     But the written word is all that electronic mail gives us.  Worse
     yet,  our  minds  place more emphasis on the written word than on
     the spoken word.  A comment which would  rate  a  raised  eyebrow
     when  spoken  results  in  massive  flames when written.  Sarcasm
     becomes well nigh  impossible  to  detect.  Off-the-cuff  remarks
     look like rock-solid statements of position.

     Fortunately,  there's  a  way  out.  Once  you  actually meet the
     people you communicate with,  it becomes much easier to interpret
     their  messages in the way they actually meant them.  Coming soon
     is your big chance to do just that.

     The next to last weekend of August is  the  Fourth  International
     FidoNet Conference.  This is our big get-together,  where you can
     finally meet all those people you've been hearing from all along.
     This year it's being held near Washington DC,  which makes  it  a
     great  excuse to visit the nation's capitol.  While you're there,
     take a few extra days vacation and be sure to visit the  Air  and
     Space  Museum.  You'll  see  everything from the Wright brother's
     original plane to an Apollo capsule that went to the  moon.  Also
     check  out  the Washington Zoo and see the pandas.  [A tip:  Wear
     comfortable shoes when you visit the zoo.  It's huge.  I made the
     mistake of wearing a new pair, and almost killed my feet.  And be
     sure to visit the reptile house.]

     But first,  last,  and always,  it's a chance to meet your fellow
     FidoNet people.  There will be interesting speakers,  hospitality
     suites  offering  free food and drinks,  exhibitors showing their
     latest and greatest, and swarms and swarms of people you've heard
     from and talked to over the net and always wanted to meet.

     I know I'll be there,  and I'll be looking  forward  to  meeeting
     you.  Stop by my room and say "hi".  See you there!

                          Europe Proudly Announces

                                  DUTCHIE

                         The first fully operating
                               POINT PROGRAM



     DUTCHIE is written by           Henk Wevers

     DUTCHIE Copyright (C) 1987 by Henk Wevers.  All rights reserved.


     1. Release date of DUTCHIE.

     Dutchie will be released May 1,  1987.  From that date it can  be
     file  requested or down loaded from distributing nodes around the
     globe.  See at the end of this article for details.

     2. What is DUTCHIE ?

     Dutchie is basically written to get  most  of  the  load  off  of
     Fido/OPUS/Seadog  BBSes.  From  now on,  you can do almost all of
     your communication with the BBS offline,  Dutchie will take  care
     of  sending/receiving files to and from your host and you can now
     even subscribe to  local,  national  and  international  echomail
     conferences.  They  will  be delivered at your home at night and,
     if you wish,  you can have your mail printed out before you  wake
     up   in  the  morning.   Messages  can  be  entered  locally  and
     transferred to the BBS directly or during lower  phone  rates  at
     night.

     3. What do I need to run a DUTCHIE?

     At the moment you need an IBM (compatible) PC with around 512K of
     RAM  and  two  floppy  disk  drives or a hard disk.  The BBS that
     serves you must run SEAdog, Opus, or Fido, or a combination.  For
     the  best service you should pick a node running SEAdog on top of
     the BBS all day.

     I guess that Opus will be capable of handling all  services  also
     in  the near future.  The version of Opus that will be able to do
     so should be 1.00 or above.

     The sysop of the serving BBS must  run  BRINKERS,  a  program  to
     serve DUTCHIES.  Please check with him or her.


     4. What can Dutchie do ?

     FidoNews 4-19                Page 4                   18 May 1987


     Oh  Boy,  we  can  write a full manual on this,  but let's try to
     cover most of it.

     Communications Program
     ----------------------

     First,  Dutchie is a  simple  but  very  powerful  communications
     program  for those cases where you want to deal in real time with
     the BBS that serves you.  We will call that  BBS  the  BOSS  from
     now, and you the POINT.

     Dutchie  is capable of emulating an ANSII terminal (VT-100),  can
     automatically dial the BOSS,  and can  upload/download  with  the
     following protocols: Xmodem-Modem7-Telink-SEAlink.  The latter is
     a VERY fast sliding window protocol supported by Opus and SEAdog.

     You  can  change the baud rate given 300/1200/2400/4800/9600 baud
     support, and choose your communications port (1-4).

     You can shell to  DOS  during  a  session  to  do  all  kinds  of
     fiddling.

     Message editor
     --------------

     Dutchie  has  a  full  screen  message  editor  to enter messages
     locally.  You can send and receive those messages with  Dutchie's
     mailer program.  A few points:

      - Full screen editor
      - Read and write message text from/to disk
      - Change messages and resend/change already sent messages.
      - Attach file(s) to messages
      - Request file(s) from your boss
      - Send normal (nightly) mail or crash mail directly to your Boss
      - Multiple  area  support  so  you can easily maintain different
        echomail electronic conferences.


     Mailer program
     --------------

     Via your Boss you  can  be  attached  to  the  worldwide  Fidonet
     without  the  hassle of running a Bulletin Board.  The only thing
     you have to do is to make some arrangements with your Boss  about
     forwarding  mail,  mail times,  and costs for forwarding mail and
     files.  In the most simple setup all mail and  files  are  routed
     through  your  Boss.  He/She  will  help  you  to  setup  things.
     Remember,  if you want a file from your Boss want to send her/him
     a  file  there is no need to call into that BBS personally.  Just
     prepare the request or the message  at  your  own  time  and  let
     DUTCHIE  do  the  rest.  Either  at night,  during cheap hours or
     directly, if you are in a hurry.

     The mailer program is simple,  and  works  almost  automatically.
     There   are   menu   choices  for  sending  or  requesting  files
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 5                   18 May 1987


     immediately as well as getting your mail from your boss  as  soon
     as  possible.  We  call  this  crashmail.  If  you  are  awaiting
     crashmail from your boss you can tell Dutchie so and Dutchie will
     wait until the mail has arrived and then exit.

     On the other hand,  If you want to do the mail at night  or  will
     receive  so called echomail conferences from your host during the
     night,  you can start Dutchie's Nightwatch utility  as  soon  you
     have  finished  working  with your machine.  Dutchie will deliver
     mail at the specified times,  can receive mail all night and  can
     pickup  mail  that the Boss is holding for you (you pay the phone
     bill in this case) or you hold your mail and files until the Boss
     picks them up (If  you  find  a  rich  host.  Hurry  folks  those
     systems will have a lot of Dutchies to serve soon!)

     The Mail printer
     ----------------

     Dutchie  can  be  told  to print out all newly received mail at a
     specified time.  Imagine having  your  favorite  conferences  and
     your private mail available at breakfast!

     FidoNet
     -------

     Via  your  Boss  you  can exchange electronic mail and files with
     other people using the Amateur Public FidoNet around  the  world.
     We  are  approaching  the 2000 attached computers now without any
     Dutchie on the net yet!  How many will these be in a  year  after
     Dutchie?

     IFNA
     ----

     If  you are going to use the Public Fidonet,  you should consider
     becoming a member of IFNA, the International FidoNet Association.
     For a miserable $25,  you help prevent  the  net  falling  apart.
     There is a lot of work done behind the scenes only to keep things
     running!


     Advanced DUTCHIE features
     -------------------------

     If  you  are  unfamiliar  with electronic mail we suggest you use
     Dutchie in the Basic setup as a POINT under a BOSS for  a  while.
     The  BOSS  will  help  you  and  once  you have 'grown up' in the
     electronic mail scene you can make yourself more independent  and
     become  a self serving system in the Matrix.  (Matrix is the same
     as Fidonet, Opus people use this name ).

     The first feature you can enable in Dutchie is the 'External Node
     scanner'.  This means you  need  a  nodelist  that  is  published
     weekly  by  IFNA.  As  soon  as  you  have  enabled this feature,
     DUTCHIE will ask  you  for  a  net/node  name  anytime  you  were
     referring  to  your  BOSS.  This  means you now can automatically
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 6                   18 May 1987


     dial up,  poll,  request files and send files to all nodes in the
     nodelist.  You have gained one more degree of freedom.

     Another feature is to allow people on your system.  If you enable
     this a human caller (yes Dutchie knows the difference  between  a
     human  and  another machine!) is directed to an external program.
     This can well be a BBS or just a program of  your  own  you  want
     them  to  run.  There  are PD programs that can be used to make a
     sophisticated system.

     Now, for the full flavour,  Dutchie is capable of much more.  You
     can  hook  in  external  'pack'  and  'schedule'  programs to get
     another degree of freedom and do all your  mailing  yourself,  or
     send  where  ever  you  wish.  At  the  moment  of  writing these
     programs will still be in beta test,  but they will  be  released
     soon!  Opus's  packer  Ommm can be used to do this,  so watch out
     for news about this when you are ready for it.  Although being  a
     POINT  under  a  BOSS  gives  you  a lot of services with minimal
     hassle and frustration.


     THE PRICE
     ---------

     Ah well, I could make this product shareware, but why bother?  It
     is  free for all noncommercial applications.  Restriction is that
     it must be used in a private situation,  that  is  no  government
     building,  no  firm,  whatever.  Only  running  on your privately
     owned machine in a private home is allowed.  I have put a lot  of
     work in this just to give you the pleasure of using it.  If there
     is  money  to be made on this it should go to me don't you think?
     Now,  if you don't fall in above category,  just contact  me.  It
     won't  hurt.  I'll  probably  let  you  use  it  for free after a
     written request.  In special cases,  I may want to discuss things
     with  you  person  to person.  You pay the plane and hotel,  I'll
     come and tell you that it is ok to use it (you may end up  paying
     the  bill  for  a  vacation  for me and my family in the USA if I
     think you can afford it ).  If you are allowed to use it for free
     and you like the program, send me a postcard.


     SYSOPS
     ------

     To serve  POINTS  you  must  run  Brinkers.  Available  free.  No
     restriction  on  the use of Brinkers.

       How to Remove Those Pesky, Tattered, Stuck-On Diskette Labels


     Are you fed up with those ugly, stuck-on diskette labels?  Do you
     have so many layers of labels on your diskettes that you have  to
     force them into your diskette drive?  Eh,  Bunky,  is that what's
     troublin' you?  Well,  lift up your head,  take  a  walk  in  the
     sunshine and never give up; help is at hand!

     Removing old diskette labels is a cheap,  simple, relatively fast
     process requiring three things: you, the diskette and some rubber
     cement.   I  use  "Best  Test  White  Rubber  Paper  Cement"   or
     "Sanford's Rubber Cement," although any equivalent product should
     work just as well.  (There is also a "Sanford's Thinner" which is
     used to reconstitute rubber cement  which  has  thickened;  since
     this is probably the solvent alone, it might work just as well as
     rubber cement; why don't you try it first and let me know how you
     fare?)

     First,  remove  as much of the label as possible manually.  Doing
     this will provide a surface which will be more easily  penetrated
     by  the solvent in the rubber cement and will minimize the amount
     of work you have to do later.  Work from the corner;  remembering
     that  the  diskette  is  circular inside the jacket,  you will be
     applying no pressure to the diskette itself if you work from  the
     corner.

     Next,  apply  a  liberal  layer of rubber cement to the remaining
     label and to any glue residue still stuck to the  diskette.  This
     step  is  easiest if you have purchased rubber cement in a bottle
     having a little applicator brush integrated into the lid.  During
     this process,  observe all of the caveats printed on  the  rubber
     cement container or,  if you really enjoy a Cheap High, work in a
     small, unventilated area.

     Next,  allow the rubber cement to work for awhile but don't allow
     it  to dry completely.  You're looking for that magic moment when
     the glue holding the label to the diskette has loosened  but  the
     rubber cement has not yet dried.

     Then,  using your index finger,  work from the edge of the rubber
     cement area and stroke toward the center of the area.  The proper
     technique is a combination of a stroking and one-fingered  finger
     painting  motion.  You  have to do it to get the idea.  As you do
     this,  the rubber cement will dry and will begin to roll up under
     your finger.  If you have timed things right, the label will roll
     up  right along with the rubber cement or will be loose enough to
     peel away easily, leaving a relatively clean surface underneath.

     After you  have  done  the  above,  there  could  still  be  some
     remaining  label  and/or  glue  residue.  Just  repeat  the above
     process once or twice and every shred of evidence that there  was
     ever  a  diskette label on your diskette will disappear,  leaving
     the diskette pristine!

     Of course,  you must be extremely careful to confine  the  rubber

     cement to the label area.  That is, don't allow any material, wet
     or  dry,  to  stray  onto  the  magnetic  surface of the diskette
     proper.  If you lack manual dexterity,  small muscle  control  or
     are just a complete klutz, reconcile yourself to ugly diskettes.

     Developing   facility   with   this  process  will  require  some
     experimentation.  Start with  a  diskette  that  you  don't  care
     about; then, work your way up to the diskette containing the only
     copy of your economic model of the universe.

     Kilgore Trout, 107/7

                            High Speed Protocols


     Quite  some  time  ago  we  performed a series of benchmark tests
     aimed  at  producing  an  equation  for  predicting  XMODEM  file
     transfer  times.  The  results  of  those  tests  were originally
     published in FidoNews, volume 3, number 7.  Insights derived from
     those tests were directly responsible for the development of  the
     SEAlink file transfer protocol.

     SEAlink  is  a  variant  of XMODEM which employs a sliding window
     technique in order to eliminate turnaround time  and  propagation
     delays.  Our  tests  indicated  that  such delays are the primary
     source of lost time in a typical XMODEM transfer at data rates of
     1200 bps and higher.

     YMODEM takes a different approach, in that it uses a larger block
     size (1024 bytes versus 128 bytes) to reduce the number of  times
     the  line  must  be  turned around.  The amount of lost time in a
     YMODEM file transfer should therefore be one eighth of that of an
     XMODEM file transfer.  Additionally,  YMODEM has fewer  bytes  of
     protocol  overhead  for  a  given  file transfer than does either
     XMODEM or SEAlink.  This makes it a bit more difficult to  relate
     the two directly.


     Our original benchmark results came up with the following formula
     for  predicting/XMODEM  CRC  file  transfer  times  on  a   local
     connection:

         Equation 1:

                                  Blocks*1340         Blocks
              Time in seconds =   -----------    +    ------
                                   Baud rate             4

     The  last  term is due to line turnaround and propagation delays.
     Assuming that this  is  invariant,  the  equivalent  formula  for
     YMODEM would be:

         Equation 2:

                                  Blocks*10300        Blocks
              Time in seconds =   ------------   +    ------
                                   Baud rate             4

     FidoNews 4-19                Page 10                  18 May 1987


     Since   SEAlink  gets  rid  of  the  propagation  delay  and  the
     turnaround time, and also does not kill time waiting for the ACK,
     the equivalent formula for SEAlink would be:

         Equation 3:

                                  Blocks*1330
              Time in seconds =   -----------
                                   Baud rate

     Given a file size of 1,048,576 (1 meg) at 2400 baud, this yeilds:

         Table 1:

              Method      Blocks      Time
              ------      ------      ----
              XMODEM        8192      1h 50m 22s
              YMODEM        1024      1h 17m 31s
              SEAlink       8192      1h 15m 40s

     This is based on a turnaround delay of 0.25 seconds (0.27 seconds
     was measured).  If we assume an additional sattelite lag  of  0.5
     seconds (single hop,  if I remember the numbers correctly),  then
     we get:

         Table 2:

              Method      Time
              ------      ----
              XMODEM      2h 58m 38s
              YMODEM      1h 26m 03s
              SEAlink     1h 15m 40s

     Assuming zero turnaround delay gives the values:

         Table 3:

              Method      Time
              ------      ----
              XMODEM      1h 16m 14s
              YMODEM      1h 13m 15s
              SEAlink     1h 15m 40s

     So at some point where the turnaround time is  between  zero  and
     0.25  seconds,  SEAlink  becomes faster than YMODEM.  So where is
     that point?  It should be given by the formula:

         Equation 4:

              10640        10300
              -----    =   -----  + X
              Baud         Baud

     where X is the  turnaround  delay  in  seconds  (note  that  this
     equation  is made by equating equations #2 and #3).  This equates
     to:
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 11                  18 May 1987


         Equation 5:

              10640   =   10300 + X*Baud

     or:

         Equation 6:

                   340
              X =  ---
                   Baud

     Different baud rates yield the following values for X:

         Table 4:

              Baud           X (seconds)
              ----           -----------
               300           1.13
              1200           0.28
              2400           0.14
              4800           0.07
              9600           0.04

     These assumptions are of course based on a  clean  line.  SEAlink
     becomes  markedly superior to YMODEM in the case of sporadic line
     hits,  as (1) SEAlink retransmits fewer bytes  than  YMODEM,  and
     (2) SEAlink doesn't throw away as much received data when it gets
     a bad block.

     Conclusions:

     We'll ignore the 300 baud case, since YMODEM is using much to big
     a  block for 300 baud.  Normal XMODEM is quite sufficient for 300
     baud use.

     At 1200 baud YMODEM is slightly superior  to  SEAlink  for  local
     connections  on  clean  lines,  due  to  less  protocol overhead.
     SEAlink  becomes  slightly  superior  on   very   long   distance
     connections  where  propagation  delays become a factor.  At 2400
     baud  SEAlink  should  be  slightly  superior  even  on  a  local
     connection,  becoming  increasingly  preferable  at  higher  baud
     rates.

                       HAYES modems and compatables.


     1. Introduction.

     In the world of modem freaks and slowly on in the industrial
     world, the HAYES modem is a defacto standard.

     The official standards like RS232c (USA) and V24/V28 (CCITT)
     describe the Physical part of a data circuit,  while the V25
     (CCITT)  describes the A(uto) C(call) U(unit) function.  The
     speeds and usage of the modems are laid down by the CCITT V-
     standards, mainly in the V21 till V36 books.

     Due  to  the different country and telephone  company  laws,
     modems  are  different and not compatable with  each  other,
     exept  modems of one vendor.  Some years ago,  it  was  very
     unwise to make a connection with two different modems,  even
     if  they  claimed to be according a V-xx norm.  Mostly  this
     was no problem, because a  data transport was mainly between
     two predefined points via a leased line or switched network.
     The  connection was buildup manual,  or made  automatic  via
     autocall function ACU (V25/RS232).

     The  HAYES-300 modem (I think this was the  start),  besides
     the  Physical  RS232/V24/V28  norm  did  specify  the  modem
     control  command level between modem and terminal via the AT
     leadin and the <silence>+++<silence> command to return  from
     a  data  state to the command state.  Also it describes  the
     handling  of  automatic speed detection.  This  command  set
     enables  operators and application programmers to buildup  a
     connection   via  normal  conversation.   As  it  could   be
     programmed,  the  connection  via  a  switched  network  was
     possible automatical via simple statements like "CALL John".
     The  original HAYES-300 was not using call  procedures  like
     108/1  or  108/2 (DTR circuit).  With the  HAYES-1200,  this
     command  set  was extended to cope with more than  one  line
     speed, the BELL 103 and BELL 212A. The last one more or less
     compatable with the CCITT V22 norm. Also the automatic speed
     selection in 'answering' mode was build in.  With the HAYES-
     2400,  the set was dramatically extended with three  speeds,
     BELL-103,  BELL-212A and the CCITT V22 and V22bis norms.  So
     handling also in 'answering' mode an automatic selection. As
     the  BELL-212A  and V22 uses a PSK (four-level  phase  shift
     keying)   and    V22bis  uses  QAM   (Quadrature   Amplitude
     Modulation)  technic,  which  were designed for  synchronous
     modems,  the HAYES-modem translates the asynchrone data into
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 13                  18 May 1987


     a  synchronous way by inserting and consequently removing  a
     STOP bit in periods where no character is send.  The  HAYES-
     1200  is  not compatible with the BELL-212A/V22  synchronous
     modems. The HAYES-2400 is also in this aspect compatible and
     serves  also the formal Half duplex  (RTS/CTS-handling).  As
     the  HAYES-1200  did serve only the CCITT  108/2  mode,  the
     HAYES-2400 supports also the 108/1 mode. Really you can say,
     the  HAYES-2400 is a complex intelligent unit.  Despite  the
     well written handbook of HAYES,  it is a hard job to make  a
     compatible  one.  From all modems (compatibles) I have seen,
     there are a few which come close to the HAYES,  the most are
     fare away.

     As  my  job  is Faultfinder (Support),  I  really  was  very
     pleased,  HAYES  did implement in the HAYES-2400,  a  really
     complete circuit test via the S16-register, even with remote
     commands,  so the fully V54 norm of CCITT.  As most Hobbyist
     but  even  profesionals  have  big  problems  with  reliable
     circuit connections,  and more the solvation of it,  a modem
     without this feature nowadays isn't worth the word MODEM  so
     certainly not the word HAYES.

     2. HAYES-clones.

     What  is  "compatible".  Really nothing if not exactly  said
     with WHAT.  "HAYES compatible" is to vaque.  "HAYES  command
     set compatible" is better. Most modems, so not all, are only
     compatible  with a "subset of HAYES command set".  But  also
     most  "hayes" modems have commands not existing with  hayes.
     Some  unlucky vendors did use commands or registers not used
     with hayes-1200 at that time,  but later used in the  HAYES-
     2400. (Bad Ques).

     The  best  I can say most of the better clones are  more  or
     less compatible upto HAYES-1200.

     As  I  don't know if besides HAYES-1200 and the  HAYES-2400,
     also a HAYES-300 exists,  I further only refer to this  two,
     from  which both I have the specifications.  In Europe a lot
     of  'hayes' modems with only the V21 and V23 speeds  exists,
     which are similar,  but absolute not connectable,  with  the
     BELL-103 and BELL-202 norm modems.

     As  most  application programs only use a small set  of  the
     HAYES-command set,  most clones will run with these packages
     such  that the user is pleased,  not to use his fingers  and
     ear  to  make a connection.  This if he has a user  friendly
     telephone  company (are there),  but mostly the results  are
     hopeless in peak  hours,  if there is a mismatch between the
     modem commands and the terminal commands.  I had a modem and
     a terminal program and on some day no nice CALL <my  mother>
     was  succesfully.  With finger and ear there was no problem.
     Reaction of the terminal was "BUSY". The real point was, the
     modem  did  not pickup in ATX2 mode the dial tone  from  the
     Telephone company,  so didn't start dialling.  As the  modem
     had not a speaker (for cheapness),  I could not use the ATM1
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 14                  18 May 1987


     command,  to follow the connection process.  The dial signal
     was  strong  enough,  but the frequency was a little  ouside
     (WHO's) specification.

     3. The HAYES set.

     With  this I hope,  without copying the whole 250  pages  of
     both   Hayes  handbooks,   to  give  enough  information  to
     understand the HAYES-set and the differences.

     Hayes propose to use as terminal program, the Hayes Smartcom
     II Version 2.1.

     3.1. The Physical DCE/DTE-lines.

     With DTE is meant the Data Terminal Equipment (Your terminal
     or   Host   computer)  and  with  DCE   the   Data   Circuit
     (termination)  Equipment  (all equipment between two  modems
     RS232 plugs). The HAYES-1200B is the 1200 type but as a card
     to be fitted into an IBM-PC. The same for HAYES-2400B.

     The pin assignments must be in  accordance to ISO 2110.

             Pin  20  (DTR)  can be simulated  in  the  1200  and

             Pin  6  and  8  can be forced to true  in  the  1200
             and 1200B type with a dipswitch.

     3.2. The telephone line.

     On  the telephone lin level some distinction can be made  on
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 15                  18 May 1987


     the  HAYES-2400,  between  jack type RJ12/RJ13  (multi  line
     jack) and the RJ11/RJ41S/RJ45S (single line jack).  The 1200
     only  supports  the RJ11  (single  line),  RJ12/RJ13  (multi
     line),  which  can be set by dipswitches.  This typically is
     different per country.  In the USA and some other countries,
     the  telephone  set remaines connected in  parallel  to  the
     modem. In other countries like the Netherlands the telephone
     set is switched of, as soon as the modem goes off-hook.

     3.3. The modulation frequencies and call setup phase tones.

     The  following  information is not exactly  the  HAYES-modem
     information,  but  a   hopefully readable extract  from  the

     Important  is,  the modems use  filter technics to  seperate
     the transmit channel and receive channel. Some autoanswering
     modems also by filter technics decide in which mode they are
     called.

     3.3.2. Automatic answering sequence (V25).

     If  ringing  is received on the line,  the CE/CT125  circuit
     (pin  22) will be raised true.  If CD/108 circuit was  true,
     the modem goes OFF-HOOK.  If not the modem waits for a  true
     signal  on  CD/108 (pin 20),  before it goes  OFF-HOOK.  The
     modem remains after 'off hook',  for 1.8-2.5 sec. silent and
     then transmits the 2100 Hz.  answer tone during 2.6-4.0 sec.
     or till 100msec.  after a response from the calling station.
     At least now 75 msec.  silence is maintained. The 2100 Hz is
     intended   to  disable  network  echo  cancellers  or   echo
     suppressors and is reversed in phase every 425-475 msec. Now
     the  circuit CC/107 (pin 6) is set true to indicate  to  the
     terminal, a connection is ready. The calling modem reacts on
     the answer tone also by setting circuit CC/107 (pin 6) true.

     A  response  normally  as mentioned is the  frequency  of  a
     binary  '1'.  If the equipment of the telephone company does
     not  have  echo control devices,  the 2100 Hz  tone  may  be
     replaced  by  any other tone e.g.  directly the binary  '1'.
     Only  after this sequence (or in ommission of  it)  directly
     the  autospeed modems will determine the baudrate  norm.  In
     Europe,  with  its V23-splitbaud rate complexity,  there are
     Hayes  compatibles trying to select at the moment after  the
     answer  sequence to select:  V21,  V23  (viditel),  V22  and
     V22bis. This means actually a detection criteria for carrier
     frequencies  at  980/1180  (V21),  450/390  (V23)  and  1200
     V22(bis) modulated with 600 baud.  At the same time all kind
     of frequencies like 2100,  550, 1800 Hz. and busy tone, dial
     tones around 425 Hz. has to be ignored.

     asynchrone is allowed  by inserting extra stop bits  between
     characters.

     The  guard  tone is only send in the high channel (2400  Hz.
     carrier,  so by the answering modem, but can be disabled per
     country.  The 550 guard tone is another  option.   Basically
     the  Bell-212 and the CCITT-V22 are the same.  But in detail
     there are differences.  Which, I don't know yet for sure, it
     may be the scrambled '0' instead '1's (see lateron).  But in
     the  HAYES-2400,  there is a command ATBn,  with  which  the
     BELL-212  (n=1) or V22 (n=0) is selected.  This only for the
     1200 baud FD mode.  The V22bis is fully compatible with  the
     V22  norm.  The  difference between V22 (600/1200 baud)  and
     V22bis  (1200/2400  baud)  is V22 works with  2  dibits  and
     V22bis with quadbits.  The way of working of PSK/QAM  modems
     is  to complex to explain here,  but it is important to know
     that a phase change of the modulated carrier of:

          0 degrees is equal to dibit 01
         90 degrees is equal to dibit 00
        180 degrees is equal to dibit 10
        270 degrees is equal to dibit 11

     These  first two bits in the V22bis quadbit  are  compatible
     with the dibits of V22,  to remain compatabilty for fallback
     mode.  The V22bis has another 4 levels of detection by means
     of a quadrature amplitude modulation technic.

     3.3.4. Automatic answering mode V22(bis).

     At calling time the sequence as described above with the FSK
     type  modem  is  valid for the V22(bis).  The  called  modem
     reacts instead or after the answer sequence with unscrambled
     binary '1's at 1200 bit/sec.  and well in the upper  channel
     (2400  Hz.  carrier).  This till it detects scrambled '0' or
     '1's in the lower channel (1200 Hz.  carrier).  The  calling
     modem  remains  silent  till  it  for   155  msec.   detects
     unscrambled  '1's  in  the upper  channel,  after  which  it
     remains  silent for 456 msec.  and then transmit unscrambled
     double dibits 00 and 11,  if in V22bis mode,  for 100  msec.
     followed  by  scrambled  binary '1's or if in  V22  mode  it
     transmits  direct  scrambled  binary  '1's  (*).   Here  the
     distinction 1200/2400 baud is made by the calling modem. The
     called modem reacts with scrambled '1's preceded,  if V22bis
     with  the unscrambled double dibit 00 and 11.  At the moment
     of detection of the double dibits,  the circuit CI/112  (pin
     12)  is set true (indicating 2400 baud).  In both cases  the
     scrambled  '1's are observed for 600 msec.  after which  the
     circuit  CF/109 (pin 8) is set true.  If V22 (1200) the data
     transfer is started under control of CA/104 (pin 3).  In the
     V22bis  mode (2400),  first scrambled binary '1's  are  send
     form both sides for 200 msec.  on 2400 bit/sec. mode. Noted,
     that  till  now all was transmitted on 1200  bit/sec.  After
     this  200  msec.  also  the V22bis mode is  ready  for  data
     transfer.

     I  know it is confusing,  but so it works.  To make it  more
     difficult,  the (*) mentioned in the text is true for V22bis
     and for V22 alternative A and B only. For V22 alternative C,
     for the '1's you have to read '0's.  As the V22 norm is very
     confusing on some aspects, one remark has to be made. In V22
     (not V22bis) 3 alternatives can be selected.  Alternative  A
     and B are compatible with V22bis, but alternative C not. The
     difference  is  the scrambled binary '0's stead '1's of  the
     calling modem.  So the real difference between  alternatives
     A/B  and C is,  that alternative C includes the  possibility
     for mode V, for anisochronenous data upto 300 bit/sec. Which
     manufacturer  tells me which alternative as mentioned in V22
     he serves. Or has this to do with the Bell-212 norm. Who can
     tell?  Has  this to do with the famous ATBn command  in  the
     HAYES-2400 modem? See above.

     Be  carefully  with  these  V22  and  Bell-212A  norms.   As
     explained  before only the 2400 baud (V22bis) is compatible.
     The 1200 sometimes works,  but sometimes not.  E.g. I had an
     USA RIXTON 212 modem, not corrected for the European market.
     Also  I  had a Dutch designed (DATAD) V22(bis) V23  and  V21
     modem and an English (PACE) for the same speeds.  The RIXTON
     works pretty most at the time with both the DATAD and   PACE
     modem. But sometimes it goes wrong and the Eurpeans connects
     at 2400, which is strange, but true. With an original HAYES-
     1200  (with no ATBn) command as the HAYES-2400  has,  nearly
     the same result. The two Europeans hardly are connectable at
     1200  baud to each other.  This has in my opinion to do with
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 18                  18 May 1987


     the  way  of speed selection.  We try to come  out  of  this
     struggle.

     3.4. Some advise on real physical level.

     If  you  are ggiing into communications with modems and  you
     have  no  Telecomfreak-friend close to you and you  want  no
     nervous  breakdown  in  the near future,  have  at  least  a
     "breakbox",  self made or from the shop. This to follow  the
     different DTE/DCE levels. If you want to log a HAYES session
     to evaluate the connection process or data exchange process,
     make from your old computer a "DATASCOPE".  (See Appendix  A
     for  some  suggestions).  An other advise is to  standardise
     your cable set.  As some manufactures make a mash of the V24
     or  RS232C pins,  you have not to follow  it.  On  telephone
     line  level it is handy to have in your surrounding a  scope
     or frequency counter.

     3.5. Connection of the terminal to the HAYES.

     The  Hayes modem has a minimum and a maximum baud  rate.  If
     you connect a terminal to the modem,  make sure you have the
     right pins connected in relation with the dipswitches.  Also
     if you have selected e.g.  108/2 mode, be sure your terminal
     program  support them.  It is possible to connect  only  the
     pins  2,3  and 7.  So in this case the DTR and the  DCD  are
     forced true.  In general I don't like this methode. With the
     Hayes-1200, RTS and CTS are not used, so only full duplex is
     possible. With Hayes-2400 you have to use these signals only
     if you use the Half Duplex mode (Synchrone mode).  Otherwise
     RTS (pin 4) is neglected and CTS (pin 5) is set true.

     So if you have connected the terminal properly,  at the time
     you give an 'A' or 'a',  the modem decides what the baudrate
     is  and  set  the terminal interface UART according  to  it.
     Hayes is very street forward.  This speed is maintained till
     after the <carriage return>, which always finishes a command
     line.  With  the next A from a new AT command  line,  a  new
     speed  can be defined.  There is one other  possibility.  In
     auto  answer mode or if a call is made,  the baudrate can be
     else as the speed in the last passed command mode.  This  on
     real  modem  level,  the baudrate detection selects  another
     speed.  The Hayes reacts with the connect code on this  last
     command  mode speed and than switches to the new  speed.  To
     give an example.  Suppose the terminalspeed is 2400 baud.  A
     dial is made towards a 1200 baud only modem.  The Hayes will
     start  the connect phase as described in 3.3.2.  but finally
     will get a connection on 1200 baud. So he will react towards
     the terminal with 2400 baud with 'CONNECT' or '1',  switches
     back  to  1200  baud,  which the  terminal  has  to  follow,
     otherwise  it result in a  terminal/modem mismatch.  Also  a
     <silence>+++<silence>  on  2400 baud will not  be  accepted.
     Only  1200  baud,  from  this  moment  on.  So  suppose  the
     established  call  at 1200 baud is broken.  The Hayes  will,
     after  the carrier disappear,  fall back into  command  mode
     still  in 1200 baud.  The terminal has to give an AT<string>
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 19                  18 May 1987


     on  2400 baud if it wants the original 2400 baud  connection
     again.

     3.6. The differences in the Hayes command set.

     Very  short a comparision between HAYES-1200 and  HAYES-2400
     modem will be given and only per command a short  functional
     recoqnition.  First however the Hayes command-input line. It
     starts with AT or at (no mix of UPPER/lower) and ends with a
     cariage  return  from now on indicated with <CR>.  The  only
     exeption  is the A/ command,  which needs  no  <CR>.  During
     commandline editing backspace (hex '08') is accepted. One or
     more  commands can be given after one leading AT.  The  max.
     length of the input string however is 40 char.
     Blanks can be inserted for more readability.

     Appendix A.  Datascope.

     A  datascope  looks  to both the RXD and the TXD line  of  a
     V24/RS232C line.  So only follows what happens on the  line.
     There are very nice commercial packages as FELINE,  HP etc.,
     but  they are expensive and they use mostly a special POD to
     connect to the V24 line.  Most of them you have to preset on
     one speed and than to start the logging.

     If   you  have  an  old  computer  with  better  two   speed
     programmable UART or a SIO chip and you can program them  in
     Assembler/basic/pascal or C, you can make your one one.

     The   next  story  is  a  simplified  logunit  only  to  log
     datastreams   preceded  with  a  AT-string.   Most  of   the
     application programs works in terminal session as well

     filetransport in a half duplex mode. Or better, never the TX
     and RX line transports a character.  So basically in default
     you have to look to the TXD-line,  and look at 2400 baud for
     a  character x'41','06',  '78' or '01'.  At that moment  you
     know that probably the speed is 2400, 1200, 600 or 300 baud.
     You get on line speeds 600 and 1200 a framing error, because
     the  stop-bit is not detected.  Now depending  the  detected
     speed  you  have  to wait (time-out) till the  rest  of  the
     character  is passed,  then you have to change the speed  of
     your comm-port,  and await for the 'T',  If it is a 'T' than
     you  have  the  speed,  if  not wait on 2400  baud  for  the
     posibilities as described above.  The basic idee behind this
     is really simple.  If you listen with 2400 bit/sec to a  300
     bit/sec  send character,  the start bit is detected and will
     serve  for  the startbit and 7 bits char.  bits (so  7  zero
     bits).  The  eights char.  bit is formed of the LSB bit  and
     well 1/8 portion of it.  The second portion will be the stop
     bit.  So if on the line really is transmitted a 600  bit/sec
     char.,   the same is true with 1/4 portions. Furthermore you
     have to look to both the TXD and RXD line, if on one a char.
     is received.  If so you put this char. in its own buffer and
     in the other one a x'00'.  Lateron you can print it out, one
     line  from  buffer RXD,  one line from buffer TXD in Hex  or

     ASCII (or both) outfit.

     Go on on the same speed till you didn't receive for 30  sec.
     any  character  on  both  lines  and  start  again  with  AT
     synchronisation.  In fact the HAYES inside micro computer is
     doing  the  same.  Don't try to write the buffer to disk  at
     first instance,  because you need a DMA at least, but also 2
     buffers.  So buffer it in memory only.  You can try to write
     to disk in the silence just before the new AT string.

     Ryugen Fisher

                             What's Hopp-ening?

     Most of the readers of this newsletter  are  unfamiliar  with  my
     name  and  have  little idea why I would be writing an occasional
     column.  Those who are fortunate  enough  to  get  ECHOMAIL  have
     probably  seen  my mutterings but might well not recognize the me
     as Ryugen Fisher.  Instead they know me as "That Old Frog"  SYSOP
     of 220/1, The Old Frog's Swamp.

     Recently, I was asked to serve as the chairfrog of the FTSC (Fido
     Technical  Standards Committee) and it is in that capacity that I
     am writing you today.  As some of you may know,  the job  of  the
     FTSC is to document and make available to users or developers the
     "complicated"  parts of the way that Fido and Opus and SEAdog and
     ??????  talk to each other so that when the  systems  attempt  to
     talk to each other, there is every chance that they will succeed.
     This  is why "Net Mail" and "Echo Mail" and many of your everyday
     useful  utilities  work,   because  they  are  written   to   the
     specifications of a published (and available) standard.

     Additionally  the  FTSC  advises the Board of Directors about new
     products (hardware and software) that might affect  the  net.  In
     this  effort,  I  am  fortunate  enough  to  have the outstanding
     contributions of (in alphabetical order) Ben Baker,  Bob Hartman,
     Thom Henderson,  Tom Jennings [occasionally!],  Ken Kaplan, Vince
     Perriello,  Wynn Wagner and Gee Wong.  I doubt that  there  is  a
     board  anywhere in the world that is not using programs developed
     by at least 3 of these illustrious gentlemen.  These,  then,  are
     the  members  of  the FTSC committee and I wish to publicly thank
     them for their past, present and continuing contributions.

     Recently,  there have been many questions about the new 9600 baud
     modems.  Some of you may have them, most do not. Of course, those
     folks that do have them are anxious to see  them  on  the  weekly
     nodelist,  and  I  can  not  blame them for this.  At the present
     time,  the 9600 baud modems are  not  listed  on  the  "official"
     nodelist although Mr. Mike Johnson (Tulsa) is preparing a list of
     9600  HST  modems  that you can add with XLATLIST to the official
     list if you have a 9600 HST and wish to try to link with  someone
     else that has one. Many people have asked why the 9600 baud modem
     is  not  on the official list,  and explaining that is the second
     reason for this column.

     The first reason that the 9600 baud has not become  a  "standard"
     is  that Fido,  in any of its versions currently available,  will
     NOT work at 9600 baud.  Opus and SEAdog will handle the 9600 baud
     throughput,  but  Fido  just won't do it.  I'm sure that you will
     agree that this is an important consideration.  We hope  that  as
     the  new Fido 12 and Opus 1.XX finish their testing,  more sysops
     will change to one of these systems and thus  support  9600  baud
     modems.  But,  while software development is one issue, it is not
     the only (or even the major) one.

     FidoNews 4-19                Page 24                  18 May 1987


     The major issue is compatibility.  Simple put,  unlike  the  2400
     baud  modem that was designed to a standard so that Hayes and USR
     and Multitech, etc could all produce a modem that could and would
     talk to another brand, in the evolving world of 9600 baud modems,
     there are not two brands of reliable modems that can talk to each
     other at 9600 baud. Nor do all the brands "step down" to a slower
     speed in the same way.

     What this means is that a U S Robotics 9600  HST  cannot  connect
     with  a 9600 Telebit and neither of them talk to a 9600 Microcom.
     And such major modem manufacturers as Racal Vadic, Hayes,  Anchor
     and Multitech have not yet even released a product! But, they are
     going to. And as each of them is released, we will do our best to
     test  and  evaluate,  hoping that a common industry standard will
     soon be reached.  When that happens,  when two diverse brands  of
     modems  are  able  to  repeatedly connect with each other at 9600
     baud and can pass the committee's other tests, you can be certain
     that you will read about it HERE before you see it in PC WEEK  or
     INFOWORLD.

     What  we  are  hesitant  about  is  that at this time the FidoNet
     network is the largest network in the world and our  adoption  in
     the  nodelist  of a "non-standard" modem might well (artificially
     and prematurely)  serve  to  create  a  "defacto"  standard  that
     actually  RETARDS  the  development  of  a really great 9600 baud
     modem.  At this time,  NONE of our testers were willing to  spend
     their $$$ on the products.  And as long as that remains true,  we
     can not, in good conscience, actively or BY IMPLICATION encourage
     you to purchase a 9600 baud modem.

     We would like you to know that questions regarding the "standard"
     F-O-S (Fido/Opus/Seadog) interface can be addressed to  the  FTSC
     at 220/1 or via U.S. Snail at:

         Standards Committee
         P.O. Box 1061
         Rhinelander, WI 54501

     Questions can be addressed by IFNA members and non-members alike,
     and we will do our best to assist you.

          I'd like  to start  off this column by thanking all of those
     who have taken the time to write to me. One of the  things I like
     best about  this column is hearing from someone I've been able to
     help (or who thought I had  something interesting  to say). While
     the echomail  conferences are  fine for  some things (like asking
     questions), I think FidoNews is a  better method  of distributing
     information  that   you  think   many  people  might  need.  Even
     information that would only  apply to  sysops (a  new or improved
     utility for  example), not  all sysops have the time or resources
     to read every message in the sysop echomail  conference. While it
     looks like FidoNews is getting many more submissions recently, it
     still looks a  little  pale  at  times.  Let's  all  try  to keep
     FidoNews in mind when we discover any useful information.

     -- Oops... I goofed (Correction department) --

          In my  column on  PageMaker and Ventura Publisher there is a
     mistake. There is a  run-time version  of Windows.  Since Ventura
     didn't  need  GEM  (it  had  a  run-time  version  built-in), but
     PageMaker needed Windows  (the  package  even  came  with  a full
     Windows)  I  had  assumed  that  there was no run-time version of
     Microsoft Windows. David Dyer-Bennet (Sysop 14/341)  brought this
     to  my  attention.  It  seems  that Microsoft includes a run-time
     version of Windows in its Windows  Development Kit.  I don't know
     why Aldus didn't take advantage of it with PageMaker, but it does
     exist.

     -- Postscript, Laser Printers, and such --

          In the same column I  had  asked  if  there  were  any other
     Postscript laser  printers in  the market.  It was  brought to my
     attention a device by The Laser Connection called PS Jet.  PS Jet
     replaces the top of a Hewlett Packard LaserJet (or anything built
     on the same engine  like the  Canon Laser  printer) and  turns it
     into a Postscript Laser Printer. Please note that this can NOT be
     used with the new HP LaserJet series II, only with their original
     LaserJet  printers.  In  addition  to  this  I  found  a  list of
     PostScript printers in the latest  issue  of  BYTE  magazine. The
     list includes  the ITT  Qume Scrip  Ten, the NEC SilentWriter LC-
     890, the QMS PS  800  and  PS  2400,  and  the  Texas Instruments
     OMNILASER 2108.  Armed with  this list of names I went down to my
     local dealer and found out  that  he  is  able  to  order  the TI
     printer.

          Some people  suggested to  me that something like a LaserJet
     and the JLaser board would be  much quicker  than PostScript. The
     problem I'd  have with  this is  Ventura doesn't  really give you
     that much more for a JLaser. It may be able  to do  some graphics
     quicker and  allow you to print in reverse text (white on black),
     but it doesn't give you the  variety  of  type  faces  and sizes.
     That's where Postscript really shows its' stuff. With most of the
     laser printers you have to define a font in every  size you need.
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 26                  18 May 1987


     If you design a special font, you have to create it in EVERY size
     you intend  to use  it. A  printer using  PostScript doesn't have
     this liability. A font is defined by it's outline. If the font is
     there, great tell it what size you want  to use  for now. Ventura
     knows  about   this  and  gives  you  the  greatest  variety  and
     flexibility with a PostScript printer.

          Graphics with PostScript are indeed slow, but it also allows
     some special  things with  them. If you import an AutoCad drawing
     into Ventura, when printed (to a Postscript device)  it will show
     with the  greatest resolution  possible. If  you're using a laser
     printer,  300  dpi  (dots  per  inch).  If  you  have  a Linotype
     Linotronic L300  with the  PostScript RIP,  it comes  out at 2540
     dpi. This way  you  are  always  getting  the  highest resolution
     possible. I  don't how  PostScript does  these tricks, especially
     enlarging and reducing a font smoothly, but it  does do  them and
     do them  well. For  more information  on this,  I'd recommend you
     pick up the May 1987 issue  of BYTE  magazine. There  are several
     articles  on   DeskTop  Publishing,   with  a  few  dedicated  to
     PostScript.

     -- Updates and comments --

          Incidentally, Xerox  has  released  version  1.1  of Ventura
     Publisher. Included  in the  new release is support for many more
     printers (the original version knew about less than a dozen), and
     better  support  for  some  of  the existing printers. One of the
     extended features in Version 1.1  is  the  support  of PostScript
     download fonts.  I've seen  a few of these advertised for the PC,
     and it's nice to  see that  Xerox isn't  going to  ignore what is
     going on  in the  real world.  Continuing support  can be hard to
     find these days. The price for a new copy remains the same ($895)
     and updates  are $100.  I don't see anything wrong with this fee,
     as it should include quite a bit of updates to the manual.

          While I would normally complain loudly  about having  to pay
     for an update, I'm not going to complain about this one. While it
     would be nice for  companies  to  give  top  notch  support after
     you've purchased their product (read give free updates), it would
     make software prices  unreasonable.  Can  you  imagine  the price
     increase for a piece of software if "included" in the price was a
     few decades of updates? While it would be nice, I can't see it as
     being practical. If the update is because of a major bug, I think
     it the company should send the  updates  free.  But  when  it's a
     "legitimate" update,  I see  no reason not to charge a reasonable
     fee. If the update  just  consists  of  new  disks,  I  can't see
     charging  that  much  for  it.  On  the other hand, if the update
     includes a new manual (only if  needed,  I  have  little  use for
     duplicates of manuals) I can easily see the need to charge for it
     (printing costs can be very high).

     -- MathCAD (MathSoft, List Price $249) --

          I was given a demonstration of MathCAD this  past week  by a
     professor  at  a  local  college. I've been interested in MathCAD
     since I saw one of  their  ads.  It  looked  like  an interesting
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 27                  18 May 1987


     program and  while I  still can't afford it, I did want to take a
     look at it. The demonstration was by no  means a  real "test run"
     although I did have a chance to play with it for awhile.

          I was  very impressed with MathCAD's capabilities. It really
     is a "spreadsheet" for engineers  in  the  way  that  Lotus  is a
     spreadsheet  for  accountants.  In  almost  no  time at all I was
     getting it to calculate the results  to somewhat  complicated (to
     me at  least) formulas.  Since I knew I was going to get a chance
     to try it, I brought several of my old college texts in Calculus,
     Computer Science, and Physics. I was able to get MathCAD to solve
     many of the examples  (and  problems)  from  each  textbook, even
     going so  far as to graph the equations. For the first time I was
     able to "see" how much faster  different sorting  algorithms were
     for a  number of elements to be sorted. All I had to do was enter
     the formula for average  number of  "swaps" (obtained  out of the
     textbook)  for  each  algorithm,  give  a  range to represent the
     number of elements, and graph each  function. Total  elapsed time
     was less than 10 minutes, and that's including some learning time
     as well! When I was in college, it would have taken me over a day
     to write  a program  to analyze the different functions and graph
     them, and even then my graphs would have been much cruder (due to
     lack of graphics experience and laziness). Since MathCAD lets you
     insert text anywhere, my  "spreadsheet"  could  very  easily have
     been a  handout from a college course. Everything neatly labeled,
     functions looking like they do  in  textbooks  (no  sqr(),  but a
     "real" root  symbol), and  explanations for  everything. it would
     have been nice to have had this when I was  in college,  a lot of
     the work would have been completed in minutes instead of hours.

          While  I  wouldn't  recommend  you send your children off to
     college with a copy of MathCAD, it would be to  easy for  them to
     just finish  the book work instead of actually learning about the
     topic. I would recommend this program to anyone  who has  to do a
     lot of  function solving  in the course of their work. This would
     probably include  almost anyone  designing electronic components,
     buildings, and  the like.  Overall I  am very  impressed with the
     program. It will work with  any  graphics  cards  (CGA,  EGA, and
     Hercules mono)  and takes advantage of a math coprocessor if it's
     installed. If you plan on running it on an XT  (even a  turbo XT)
     get  an  8087,  it  will  crawl  without one. I'd go so far as to
     recommend a math coprocessor for any machine it's going to be run
     on frequently.  That's the only drawback I could find in the hour
     or so I was able to use the program, and I can barely see that as
     a  drawback.  Anyone  who  is  using  their  computer  for a math
     intensive application (like MathCAD or a CAD program) should have
     an 8087/80287.  It can  make a world of difference between barely
     running, and running quite well (and quickly).

          The best game I've come across  this week  is Silent Service
     from Microprose (list price $34.95). Last week I mentioned that I
     hadn't been able to get it to run. Well, the problem was in their
     copy protection  scheme. It  just didn't like my NEC V20. I ended
     up pulling the V20 out and putting the 8088 back in order  to get
     FidoNews 4-19                Page 28                  18 May 1987


     it to  boot. While  I can't condone a copy protection scheme that
     is this unforgiving (or a  program  that  only  supports  the CGA
     video  card  like  this  one),  I really do enjoy Silent Service.
     There are  several different  "games" within  the program ranging
     from  target  practice  to  war  patrol.  I've been busy with the
     latter for the most part (I  was already  familiar with  the game
     from my  Commodore days). I start off at one of the three Pacific
     sub bases and patrol the Japanese shipping lanes. I'm told when I
     run across  a ship or convoy. Since there are many types of ships
     I can decide if  the  convoy  is  worth  the  time  involved (one
     freighter is  not worth  taking on 3 destroyers). While I've been
     concentrating on the big ships (tankers and troop  ships), I have
     gone after  large convoys of freighters. My biggest problems have
     been with the "Kaibokan" destroyers.  You  usually  only  get one
     good chance  at hitting a convoy, after the first torpedo "salvo"
     the convoy starts zig-zagging  and the  destroyers escorting them
     come looking  for you!  It is a very accurate simulation of World
     War II submarine  warfare  and  can  be  very  addicting.  If you
     getting tired  of the standard shoot 'em up style games yet still
     want some action, look into Silent  Service. Just  be prepared to
     deal with strategy as well as good aim.

          The best book I've found is "Solutions in C" by Rex Jaeschke
     (Addison-Wesley,  $17.95  list).  It  covers  some  of  the  more
     advanced topics of C, and has helped me to understand my compiler
     a little better. Most  of the  books I've  seen on  C don't cover
     topics like  stack and  heap management,  and in  some cases this
     could be very important. It also goes into more detail  than most
     of my  other C  books on  structures, arrays,  bit fields and the
     like. This is not the book for someone just beginning to learn C,
     but it  does do  nicely for  someone who  is trying to learn more
     than is discussed in most of the books available on C. I  plan on
     making it a permanent part of my library and would recommend that
     others do the same.

          As usual  there's quite  a bit  lying around  that I haven't
     gotten around  to looking  at yet.  Part of the reason is lack of
     time, but some of it is lack of interest. I would really  like to
     hear  from  some  of  you  on  programs  that  you've found to be
     worthwhile. Not only will you "get your name in lights" (I try to
     give credit  where credit is due), but you could save me a lot of
     time as well. Below you'll find my US mail address, uucp address,
     and FidoNet net/node number. If you're sending me netmail through
     FidoNet, please route it through 157/1 (157/0 will  work as well,
     but I hit 157/1 more often). Next week, I'll give you the current
     results on my valspeak/LEX project.

     A few people have contacted the Radisson Mark Plaza  Hotel  about
     obtaining a room for the upcoming  FidoNet  Conference  and  have
     been somewhat surprised at the rates quoted.  Please rest assured
     that conference attendees do NOT have to  pay  full  room  rates!
     When  booking  your  room,  be  sure  to  tell  them that you are
     attending the International FidoNet  Conference.  This  will  get
     you a rate of $80 per room for any number of occupants.
