========================================================================
     i went to Victoria park where there were blue musicians playing
their souls into the nether regions.  Later, Ray said, [doing my best
to quote verbaim but i didn't have a recording device other than my
ineffecient mind] "some thing magical happened because the weather
was bad.  Only the optomists came out, the people who L O V E the
music were there."
     ...kinda reminds me of people who bother putting together a BBS
and running it and sending mail around by trying, rather than buying
an account somewhere to get easy connectivity.

     i still haven't figured out the _damn_ docs yet [oops, excuse
me PLEASE, honestly i'm only a satanist on weekends since it's
become fashionable]...  it's because i spend so much time reading
echos and mail that i get distracted.  i get pissed off when i hear
bickering [or hear  misself whining to later remember with
embarassment] because someone is trying to get the mail around but
isn't doing it absolutely perfectly according to absolutely everyone's
conceptualization of perfect-shun.

     I borrowed Simone's camera and took rolls of film of children
dancing to Mel Brown, Lazy Lester, and Gatemouth Brown bands. Children
are so much smarter than other people, they know enough to not be
inhibited and simply dance whenever they feel like it.  i gotta
mail pictures to people if i get up the nerve.

     Does anyone have an Online art gallery yet, that doesn't take
a T1 line and oodles of stuff no-one can afford, to connect with it?
What happened to ascii art?  ASCII is the black ink of computer art.
Picasso's Don Juan was done only with black ink, eh?  Where is it?
Please send some.  I like it sO much, i'd spend hours trying to
figure out how to get it to not fit across a page break in the
snooze.

     I'm extremely pleased that people have sent interesting
tech-type articles this week.  i was getting afraid that dear old
snoozey was sluffed due to political icicles stabbing issues up and
DOWN into mindless mayhem.  The node list iS So important.  If you
were a commercial wanting to find _the_ purrfect .5 minute segment,
would you put it amidst debate, chat, flame, or special interest?

     Please, someone stop me from thinking in categories.

     What happened to the Rev. Visage?  Did i miss my prayers again?

RING TSR for your DOS
   From: Fredric Rice (1:102/890)

I have a TSR which watches Ring Indicator on a specified COM port
and it will sound the audio tone when it is.  It's useful for modems
which don't have telephones plugged into them during times when the
BBS software isn't running and yet the operator may wish to know a
call is coming in.  I have the habit of stopping what I'm doing and
allowing users to have the BBS when the phone rings.  It has the
disadvantage of not being able to be turned off -- when your system
is tossing or scanning and a call rings in, the speaker rings and
you can't turn it off.  Internal modems don't even have visible
lights to see blink when RD sends you a 'RING' string...  This TSR
means I can take the telephone off of the desk and put the space it
takes up to better use, using the computer's speaker to listen for
inbound calls.

The only other piece of software that I know of is visible -- BRKBOX
which gives a break-out box on the screen.  I don't like my editor's
screen messed with.

RING.ZIP comes in a C module and an executable with a make file.
It ties into interrupt 1C (clock ticker.)  If you're running a sound
application and you get a ring-in, I have no idea how the sound
application will respond -- the two will fight for control of the
speaker.

Excommunication

Joe Klemmer - 1:109/0

    Ever since I've been a member of Fidonet I have read Fidonews.
Why?  Because it provides information and entertainment, though those
Madam Emilia things are starting to get a bit boring.  But I digress.

    The information that is disseminated through Fidonews is, at
times, important in the grand scheme of things (like the situation
in Italy) but generally it's interesting only from the perspective of
those of us who are members of Fidonet.  The point is that the
universe will not come to a fiery end because of anything printed in
Fidonews.  This goes for the entertainment aspects of Fidonews, also.
In fact, I've always felt that the vast majority of articles published
fall into the entertainment category since they're, by and large,
amusing to read.  These include the topics of censorship, nodelist
size, Archiver Wars<tm>, Policy debates and Steve Winter.  Which
FidoNews 11-35                 Page:  4                    29 Aug 1994

brings me to the crux of this article.

    As of this writing, Steve Winter has been excommunicated from
Fidonet.  Cheers of joy can probably be heard in just about every
Region in every Zone.  But it is an occurrence that has me a little
worried.  Follow me for a minute.

    There is little doubt that the reason for Steve's banishment would
be attributable to the tremendous amount of complaints that have
recently been made against him.  This flood of complaints having been
sparked by the letter in Fidonews a few issues back, credited to Steve
Winter, calling on a "Jihad" against Pagan boards.  Common sense and
some little proof tell us, now, that this letter was a complete
forgery.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe that Steve did
write that article.

    Here is where things start to bother me.  While I have always
found Steve Winter to be an extremely obnoxious and scary man, I find
it more frightening to think that someone can be removed from the
nodelist over something they DIDN'T do.  This sets an ominous
precedent.  Now, I know that many people will say, "So what if he
didn't write this message? He's written enough before and it's about
time he got banned."  This is a _very_ wrong way to think.  What it
amounts to is that someone can be removed because "we" (the powers
that be, the majority, the people, whatever) don't like them for any
arbitrary reason.  The concept of 'Innocent Until Proven Guilty' is,
while not universally accepted in the "real" world, one that HAS to be
followed for all the members of Fidonet.  If not, where will it leave
us?  What will be the criteria for excommunication?  Number of
complaints?  Who you annoy?  To put it another way, if I were to flame
Bob Satti and say it was really you (the reader of this article) who
did it should YOU be banned?

    Think about this the next time you get ready to send that
blistering retort in your favorite echo.  "Whom have I annoyed
recently?"  "Could I be the next node banned?"  And who will listen
if it is you who cries -

                       "But I didn't do it!"
                          "It wasn't ME!"

 ***                                                         ***

Optimal Dialing with a USRobotics 28.8 Dual

by Clay Tinsley, 1:124/5125
USR 28.8 Dual Standard / Qnode / Binkley

If you own a new 28.8 USR Dual Standard, run the Qnode nodelist
compiler and Binkley, you may be unaware of all the potential dialing
FidoNews 11-35                 Page:  5                    29 Aug 1994

options you have, and how easy it is to NOT get the best connects.

In order to connect at the highest possible speed to others in the
nodelist, you must tell Binkley how to dial out.

Also, you can cause incoming calls to connect at lower speeds if Bink
detects an incoming call, the dial is aborted, and the new call is
answered.  Example:  you're dialing a 16.8 HST Dual, so you set B1 when
you dial (see how below).  A call comes in, and it's answered instead.
If B1 is still set and the call coming in is a V32bis, he'll get a
2400b connect!  (bleah!)

Also, if you call a 16.8 Dual Standard modem with the default settings
(B0), you'll get a 14.4 V.32bis connect.  Normally, you would want the
higher 16.8k connect.

Try adding the following to your QNODE.CFG & BINKLEY.CFG.  These may
not be the optimal setting, but it's surely better than doing nothing
at all.  If you use the FAX options, you'll have to merge this in.

The following also assumes your modem is already properly configured
and working, and you're dialing out OK.

binkley.cfg
-----------
Prefix ATB0DT
Busy |ATB0M0H1|
Answer ATB0A|
ModemTrans 1 ATB1DT/

qnode.cfg (all this goes on ONE line!)
--------------------------------------
MAXBAUD 9600|0 HST 9600|1 H14 9600|1 H16 9600|1 V32t 9600|0 UV32t 9600|0
H21 9600|0 UH21 9600|0 VFC 9600|0 UVFC 9600|0 V34 9600|0

Since the LAST MATCH is the one that's used, they must be listed in
lowest to highest desired connect order.  Recompile your nodelist, and
you should be set.

Note!  Please take time to make sure your nodelist entry is correct.
If it isn't PLEASE notify your NC so he can correct the nodelist!

NODELIST SIZE, Chapter 10^3 (but who's counting?)
by Rob Buckman, Lysistrata Railway Post Office, 1:366/844

   While preparing an article on another subject, my research took me
through the last 12 issues (1120 to 1132) of FidoNews.  The nodelist
size discussion rages just as it has for years.  In those 12 issues,
I saw various ideas all with their particular advantages and
disadvantages.  Then along comes Mr. Garrett in FidoNews 1127 who
suggests dropping the BBS names.

    What would it take for people to stop complaining (somewhat
rightly) about the nodelist size?  A 30 percent reduction? 50 percent?
75 percent?  I ran a test following Mr. Garretts' suggestion which
yielded a 15 percent reduction in my own net's segment with similar
results expected with the entire nodelist.  There were no compilation
problems using XlaxNode or RANode.  Obviously, there won't be a
noticeable depreciation in the compilation time until several nets
adopt the same scheme.  But is 15 percent worth it?  Fifteen percent
translates to 420k in a 2.8meg nodelist.  Could we go farther?

    I did another experiment by removing town names except for the NC
and Hub entries within my own segment. I also left the 2-letter state
abbreviation intact as folks like to know where (roughly, at least)
they are calling.  It yielded identical results.  Another 15 percent
shaved off or [now] 840k in a 2.8meg nodelist, making for a 30 percent
reduction and bringing the total size down to 1.96 meg.  Is 30 percent
worth it?

    Doug McLean (FidoNews 1126) makes some in-depth analysis on the
flags which would trim -- by his calculations -- another 16 percent
for 448k.  Now we're down 46 percent to 1.5megs.    From a technical
standpoint, neither the BBS name or location is necessary to
FidoNews 11-35                 Page:  8                    29 Aug 1994

establish a connection.  Probably, neither do a lot of flags.  Just
putting a single character filler in the BBS name and removing the
town doesn't break the compilers.  Maybe we could make the one
character identifier mean something (operating system? W = Windows,
M = MS-DOS, A= Apple, U =Unix).

    I admit to not having a lot of impetus to try and change the
nodelist.  My system processes the whole thing (using xLaxNode) in
just under 14 minutes.  This includes all 6 FidoNet zones plus a
private network as processed on a 10Mhz 286 AT (remember those?).
Its fast enough for me and I have the space.  I present this
information only as ideas for others for whom size is a problem to
explore.  Good luck!

Project EEMAG

Project EEMAG

Dear FidoNetters and SysOps in zone 2!

Like every country has it's nation-wide and local newspapers, it is
now time for Europe to get it's own electronic magazine. Magazines
within the electronic community are becoming wider in scope. With a
European magazine we hope to ascend the differences between networks,
and move from being a podium for merely the political and
organisational affairs of electronic media users to being a magazine
with only two specifics: It's electronic, and it's European.
Therefore we have started Project EEMAG, which hopefully will end up
in a new magazine.

At the moment we are searching for volunteers who want's to help us
in the making of the magazine. What we are looking for is people who
want to devote some time to it; time to distribute, to write, to seek
writers and to detect potentially interesting texts.

Please drop us a note if You want to take part in the project, if You
have ideas for the magazine or if You just think this is a good idea.
