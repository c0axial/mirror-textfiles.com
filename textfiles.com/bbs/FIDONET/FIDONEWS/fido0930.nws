Editorial: The daily grind

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)


JUST TO KEEP YOU THINKING AND AWAKE --

I have just changed the compression method used to generate FidoNews
once again. The current method is called GARGLE, and only I have a copy.
It's really the best in the world, so you shouldn't mind.

Seriously, it has been changed back to LHARC. In early June I
switched to ZIP from LHARC because my LHARC program failed miserably
when used with CTTY COM2, which I needed to remotely generate FidoNews
while I was in Seattle.

Everyone got mad at me then. Now that you're used to ZIP, I've changed
back to LHARC. Now you can get mad at me *again*. There was a lot less
griping than the last time I pulled this a year ago (for completely
different and less-substantial reasons).

Let's hope that a revision of LHARC allowing CTTY console redirection
comes out before I have to do this all over again...

                        * * * * *

Last week I mentioned something that I thought would generate a
little bit of friction, the idea that FidoNet "regions" are getting a
little too big. That the number of regions should increase, so that
each becomes much smaller.

Imagine how surprised I was when I received one response. And a
rational one at that, dammit. Have I lost my edge?

I was serious though. 1000 nodes in a region is crazy. How can you
expect friendly, hassle-free interactions when the RC has to deal with
1000 nodes?!

I don't want FidoNews to look like PERSONAL DATA COMM MICRO MAGAZINE
(pick your favorite generic computer magazine) that resorts to
repetitive "our annual printer review" saying the same things about
the same old products, year after year.

Here at FidoNews, when the editor is bored, the editorials are boring.
Honesty for a change! And for content, it randomly depends on what
"you the reader" sends in.

FidoNews 9-30                  Page 2                      27 Jul 1992


This issue is informative, but not really "hot". It seems the
argumentative nature of FidoNet people drops off in the summer
(really). It's only when we sit around the terminal (appropriate
word...) for long enough to make us lose our sense(s) of
perspective(s) that we let Sysop A's problems with Sysop B turn into a
"policy war" or something. It is probably a good sign, we get out
during the warm months (of course *everyone* lives well North of the
equator in FidoLand, right?)

I'll shut up now.

        FidoCon '92         "Gateway Networking"
        September 4-6          Summit Hotel
        Dallas, Texas

FidoCon '92 is now just around the corner.  If you get your
registration form mailed before the end of the month, you'll save $10
over the late registration price.

The FIDOCON92 conference should be making its way along the FidoNet
echomail backbone now.  If it's not available in your area, ask your
REC about it.

We have reserved one of our two large conference rooms for vendor
displays, and are still actively soliciting vendors to show their
wares, as well as provide some of our door prizes.

The schedule is beginning to get firmed up.  We hope to have
discussions by the major phone service providers about new technology,
Caller*ID, and how these changes relate to our use of the phone system.
We're working on getting the major modem vendors in attendance, where
they can show their new stuff, as well as discuss the V.32, V.42, and
new V.fast standards.  There will be discussions about echomail cost
sharing, as well as talks on the operation of some of the zone and
network gateways.  And we should have lots of demonstrations of network
software, OS/2 V2.0, Windows/NT, etc.

Vendor space is available for $200 for a 10'x10' area for both days.
Hospitality suites are also available for $100 plus $49 for each of up
to three attached sleeping rooms.  These are per night charges.

If you've got an idea for a discussion session, or know of a vendor
that might be interested in attending, let us hear from you as soon as
possible.

Oh, and don't forget to bring your swimming suit for the net -vs- net
water volleyball tournament!

By Joe Jared of 1:125/1212 (Formerly 103/200)
Recently with the assistance of 102/138 I have obtained almost all of
the Fidonews articles to date.  Part of this was out of boredom, but
there's also a need to keep the history of Fidonet alive, and the best
historical document of Fidonet I've seen to date is Fidonews itself.
Sure there's plenty of ranting and raving, and most of the motivators in
fidonet's growth have flown the coop, but by reading these articles, one
can see how as the net grew, growing pains and would be power mongers
would try to push the will of the net onto lesser beings, and how
fidonet has grown into the gigantic political and technical nightmare
that it is.  Anyway, enough rambling.  For request purposes, the
articles prior to 1992 are available by file request using the following
numbering sequence or by name if you want specific files.

FNews_## where ## is the year's worth of fidonews.  There are a few
stray areas that I'm looking for to complete the set, and if anyone has
the missing pieces or an explaination as to the gaps, either would be
appreciated.

                                SEAmail 1.10
                                 Revision G
                                09 July 1992

Revision G to SEAmail version 1.10 has been released, and incorporates the
following changes:

  * A bug was fixed that caused delivered processes to interfere with file
    requests in the same session.

  * KITTEN now keeps track of how many messages a caller reads or enters.
    This information can be viewed in the REVIEW command, and is accessible
    via the following system macros:

                        Total          Today
                        =====          =====
    Messages read       %MSGSREAD%     %MSGSREADTDY%
    Messages written    %MSGSWROTE%    %MSGSWROTETDY%

  * MAIL now prohibits zero-level users from adding echomail or supergroup
    folders, or from using crash priority or requesting return receipts.

  * The F10 "<R>ead - <S>elect message" display in MAIL now highlights the
    subject text of any message that is marked crash priority.

  * RTS was not being properly managed in some situations.  This should now
    be fixed.

  * The file transfer status box in DIAL and KITTEN now has a somewhat more
FidoNews 9-30                  Page 7                      27 Jul 1992


    informative title.

  * It was detected that the WAZOO session handler was not sending an extra
    TSYNC when processing a ".REQ" file during a DietIFNA session where no
    mail was being picked up.  This has been fixed.

  * The TELL program was always routing as per window S, regardless of what
    routing window is in force at the moment.  This has been fixed.

  * Two new routing directives, DEFAULT and MATCH, have been added.  See
    the updated ROUTE.DOC for details.

  * A bug was discovered that could cause GRPIN to hang under certain
    circumstances when importing messages into an echomail folder.  This
    has now been fixed.


Those with SEAmail 1.10 revision F for MS-DOS can upgrade to revision G by
going to their SEAmail directory and giving the command:

    upgrade sm110g

Those with the OS/2 version should give the command:

    upgrade sm110gp

The Science & Technology Echo Is On The Backbone
David Bloomberg, 1:233/12

"Science is best defined as a careful, disciplined, logical search for
knowledge about any and all aspects of the universe, obtained by
examination of the best available evidence and always subject to
correction and improvement upon discovery of better evidence." -- James
Randi

This definition probably best describes the thoughts and ideals of the
moderators of the SCI&TECH echo.

Some other so-called "science" echos have been "invaded" by psuedo-
science and religion posing as science. Those who are actually
interested in discussing the amazing changes in science and technology
that are occurring all around us are being relegated to the background
in those echos. It seems there are more messages about transcendental
meditation and religion than any actual SCIENCE!

Well, we have a solution. It's the SCI&TECH echo.

You may recall an article about SCI&TECH here in the FidoNews a few
months ago. Since then, we have become a backbone echo. Anybody who is
interested should be able to obtain a feed through their normal backbone
sources. We already span the coasts of the US! This means that even more
people who are interested in discussing science and technology can now
participate.
FidoNews 9-30                  Page 8                      27 Jul 1992


From scientists to students, if you have a question, if you'd like to
share your knowledge, if you want to discuss the latest findings in
scientific journals or the popular press, or if you just want to talk to
others with similar interests, without all the "noise" you may find
elsewhere, SCI&TECH is the place for you.

If you're interested, just call up your regular backbone source!

Fitness Echo

After a few trips to the doctor and discovering that the only reason
I was having back problems was due to the fact I didn't exercise enough,
I decided to start working out again. I soon was so involved with
pumping iron, I started feeling guilty when I didn't make a daily
trip to the gym. I wanted an Echo that dealt with all aspects of
physical fitness, but none were available. So I have decided FIDO
needs to have an echo dedicated to the health and fitness of the
human body.

The "FITNESS" echo is currently available locally in the NET 106 area.
Some topics of the echo are.. aerobics, nutrition, weight control,
weight lifting, body building, running, biking, heart fitness, sports
medicine and home exercise just to name a few. We hope to spread the
echo to the national backbone soon.

If you would like to receive the FITNESS echo, please send netmail
to your NEC or ZEC requesting the "FITNESS" echo. If you can't wait
for it to go nationally, please netmail me at 1:106/5999@Fidonet
and I will be happy to arrange distribution.


The "FITNESS" echo is now available here locally to about 10 sites and
we are hoping to expand to the national backbone soon.

                 OPENDOORS ECHO NOW AVAILABLE!
                 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

OPENDOORS is an internationally distributed echo designed for
discussion of BBS door/utility programming, and in particular,
Brian Pirie's OpenDoors C Library!
FidoNews 9-30                  Page 9                      27 Jul 1992


The OpenDoors door programming toolkit and BBS interface package is
used by Turbo C(++) / Borland C++ programmers, to write doors and
utilities that are compatible with RA, Maximus, QuickBBS and many
other BBS systems.

The OPENDOORS Echo was created by a group of dedicated BBS door and
utility programmers and designers, in order to promote discussions on
BBS utility programming techniques, tasks, standards, and trends.

This echo is not just for BBS door authors!  Discussion of
practically any aspect of BBS programming is encouraged.  Brian
Pirie, the author of OpenDoors is available for tech support, as
are his beta-testers.

The echo is not currently on the FidoNet backbone, but a feed is
available from the following nodes:

Scott Burkett  1:3613/12  9600v.32 Columbus, GA
Mike Gurski    1:261/1062 2400     Baltimore, MD

A New Star Trek Echo - STDSN
By Ray Brown, Moderator
SysOp, SpacePort Miami, 1:135/70


      Greetings and salutations, fellow Trekkers/Trekkies!
I'd like to announce a new echo, called STDSN. This echo is
for discussion of the upcoming new Star Trek television series,
"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine". This new series, which is not yet
in production as of this writing, is still committed to being
shown over the airwaves, starting in January, 1993, and
continuing for at least 22 episodes. This new show will, in most
cases, be seen just before, or just after, "Star Trek: The Next
Generation" (now starting its' Sixth Season) in your area.

     The topic of discussion will be all things that relate to
this new series, including, but not limited to, the actors &
actresses that'll appear, the screenplays, and any "cross-over"
of characters between the new series and the "ST:TNG" series
(some is expected, more is anticipated). Discussion of The
Original Series (TOS) of Star Trek will be off-limits.

     This new echo is currently seen on eight BBS's, with a
request in the works to place it on at least two FidoNet Regions
as Regional Echos. And, if traffic continues to increase, the echo
will be elgible for requesting "Backbone" status in a short
length of time.

FidoNews 9-30                  Page 10                     27 Jul 1992


     But, for now, STDSN is privately distributed on the east side
of the Mississippi by me (1:135/70, North Miami, FL), and on the
west side by Cindy Hill, of 1:104/43 (Denver, CO). Anybody is
welcome to call and request the echo on HOLD for them to poll
any time (except ZMH, of course!) from either location.

     The rules of the echo are f'able from me as STDSN.RUL, if
anyone is interested (and a copy will be sent to Mike Fuchs'
system for inclusion into the EchoList). The echo has been
duly noted as being in the EchoList as of EList.207.

     Thank you, and keep on Trekkin'!!
