Editorial: from here to there

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)


This year's FidoCon was held in Dallas, Texas. I was able to attend
only at the last minute, thanks to help from friends. It was put on by
Ron Bemis, Henry Clark, John Summers and other Dallas/Fort Worth area
sysops. There was a fairly small turnout this year; only two weeks
before was the ONE BBSCON in Denver only 800 miles north, and it was a
national holiday weekend. It was certainly no failure though, it was
fun end to end. (Worst feature: undrinkable  hotel coffee.)

The Dallas FidoNet Mafia contingent, helped by a grant from Computer
Language Research, provided the Hospitality suite, snacks'n'drinks,
the funny noses, kazoos, WOC T-shirts ("Worldwide Opus Consortium's
International Indoor RS-232 Bungie Championships"), "Gay/Lesbian
Sysops in FidoNet" T-shirts, and other technical apparatus necessary
for a proper FidoCon.

I spent nearly the whole FidoCon'92 in the WOC Inn, with brief
snatches of Dallas in between provided by Wynn Wagner. (Moving from
location to location in Dallas means going from refrigerated dry air
to warm damp air and back like nested subroutine calls.) We arrogantly
pretended there was nothing else going on worth bothering with.

I got in a few arguments with the Usual Suspects (which did nothing to
slow down our having fun) then got down to business -- complaining
about each other software and talking about whoever was not
immediately present. The rest of the event from my point of view was
people adding the face to face component to their otherwise-remote
communications.  Which sounds so simple... but if you've ever
attended one, you know how important this is.

The Saturday night banquet was very bizarre. Keep in mind this takes
place in a fairly ordinary hotel, which means other people, fairly
main-stream-y, where "nice" is the overall aesthetic. Well. I didn't
attend the whole banquet (1) I hadn't signed up (2) I was in
interaction overload mode (3) I don't eat meat. Vince & I stayed
behind and had a quiet meal. I was dragged in on the last fifteen
minutes to take part in some to-me-inexplicable ritual. The otherwise
staid room is filled with nuts with kazoos, funny-nose masks, magic
flutes, making bad, loud and frequently incomprehensible jokes and
remarks, (you'd think these people all knew each other or something),
and the only sensible, well-behaved person in the room was the
6-year-old kid of an actual BBS user (hey, remember them?) with a
camcorder reportedly taking blackmail footage, seen wearing both Wynn
Wagner's and Harry Lee's name badges (they thinking it would get the kid
tossed out. Didn't work..  It was everything short of a food fight. The
hotel help was looking a bit strained by it all. (The FidoCon'92
people donated some funds to help cover WOC Inn hospitality suite
expenses.)
FidoNews 9-36                  Page 2                      14 Sep 1992


Outside of FidoCon, Wynn took me to a few touristy places, like the
local gay neighborhood where I got the best caffeine of the trip, but
my favorite was Saturday night, where I got to visit what is closest
to a religious shrine for me -- Dealy Plaza, a major node in
Discordian "history". From the bronze plaque attached to the School
Book Repository Building I made a rubbing (at Wynn's suggestion) of
the word "ALLEGEDLY" in the text describing Oswald's deed on the 6th
floor of that very building, which had been defaced by someone angered
at the implication of that simple word, then carefully repaired.


                            * * * * *

Henry Clark told me they would be writing up a post-FidoCon article
for next week (I'm still here in Dallas, so it's already "next week"
as far as FidoNews goes.)

                            * * * * *

Wynn has more of the his T-shirts; "Gay & Lesbian Sysops in FidoNet"
and the ASCII-ized doggie in white ink on the traditional pink
triangle on a black 100% cotton shirt XL and XXL (inhale). You can get
them for $14US postage-paid from Wynn Wagner, Box 190365, Dallas TX
75219. (This covers his expenses and shipping, and is not a profit
item.)

BBSummer'92 con in Tallinn, Estonia report

Hello all of you out there. Here is a piece of text describing my
visit to Estonia this August, to attend at the yearly now BBSummer
event, some kind of little Fidocon. I will have some lyrical
sidethreads here, though.

One thing I was asked when I said that I will write an article to
Fidonews about the event - "Is it all that important?' To this, I can
respond with one question and one statement. The question is - 'Does
anyone have enough confidence to tell me (or the world) - what IS
important?'. And the statement is - 'Yes, I think that it is
important, because this is what Fidonet is actually for'. For anyone
wishing so, word Fidonet above could be replaced wth Chateaunet,
LIFnet, Fishnet or whatever like that. These nets aren't actually
about the power issues of governing zones and regions, moderating
echoes and everything - they are about PEOPLE, and that seems be the
most difficult thing to recognize to a major part of those very
people. But let's get to the reoprt itself.

The event took place from 21st to 23rd of August in a place called
Vaana Jahiloos (with some national a's in the first word), which in
reality was represented with a small house built of wood with roomy
hall and a kitchen inside and a lawn with flagpole outside. People
started gathering there around midday of the 21st, sipping some beer
and making LOTS of sandwiches (both were in plenty). They also had
several computers set up inside, so some people were sitting there
watching some nifty demos or playing games with great SoundBlaster
support. Total amount of people was estimated around 75, mostly
Estonian, but with three people out Region 2:50 (Russia, me including)
and two special star guests, about whom I'll tell later in here.

So it all went with games and demos and beer and sandwiches, and
what's most important, with talking and getting acquainted and more
talking once again, until approximately 1am. After that, several cars
present had their lights turned on and directed on the flagpole in the
center of the lawn.  This was somewhat improvised meeting of the
special guest star :) Mr. Ron Dwight, Z2C and Mr. Esa Laitinen of
Casino, the Internet gateway. Then the flag of BBSummer was raised,
with words DON'T PANIC sewed in alternating red and white stripes...
All then moved to get some more beer.

I've exchanged quite a few messages with both Ron and Esa before, but
this was my first chance to meet them in person, and I was delighted
to do it.  We had very nice talks there, about everything, from
matters of zone management to computer hardware to some
literature/philosophy talks.

FidoNews 9-36                  Page 4                      14 Sep 1992


I don't really think that there's something more to describe because
it just went along like that until evening of 23rd. Oh yes, I almost
forgot, there was the competitions! Traditional hard disk throwing and
floppy flinging, of course, but also the test who will swap to disks
in drives the fastest way and who'll make more mouse clicks in 45
seconds (btw the record was 402). At night, there was a campfire
outside for those who was still awake and staying ath the site (some
were sleeping in the camping nearby).

All of that was first thought of, and implemented by estonian sysops,
with whom I have a long track of communications and friendship. To say
that I appreciate it would be to say practically nothing but that is
the way with words, they have only a limited meaning. So I'm saying a
BIG 'thank you' for all who've been concerned with the organization of
this year BBSummer and all who've been present there and created such
friendly warm atmosphere. My special thanks for hospitality and care
goes to Sulo Kallas and Peter Marwet of Goodwin BBS, and Madis Kaal of
M.A.S.H. Board #1.

It would be an unforgivable sin for me to forget some words about
ladies present, because they're so rare at sysop meetings anywhere as
well as on the ether. Sadly, I don't remember all the names, but I do
know that the remarkable flag was made by one of the estonian girls.
My personal gratitude also goes to charming Mrs. Daiva Tamulioniene
who was brave enough to spend whole night up at the campfire talking
about some weird networking things and to Ms. Piret Part who was not
only looking absolutely beautiful, but also did care about switching
to English language in presence some dumb guys like me :) who still
cannot get their Estonian far enough for proper understanding.

To finish, I'd like to return to the topic of the first paragraph. I
do wish that tehre would be more such meetings in every part of the
netland, small ones, informal ones, warm ones - this way we'll one day
stop flaming one another in various echoes and just go for one firm
handshake (real, not YOOHOO or EMSI <grin>)

     FLorida establishes Hurricane Relief Center and Fund!


[This article was first distributed throughout FidoNet as
an Echomail message on the largest amateur computer BBS
network in the world! This is something FidoNet can really
do WELL!]

Governor Lawton Chiles announced today a toll-free number
for coordination of hurricane relief to southern Florida
residents and agencies.

1-800-FL-HELP-1 (1-800-354-3571) is the centralized number
for information, pledges, and coordination of delivery of
goods at the FLorida Relief Center. It will be manned 24
hours a day.

The Florida Relief Fund has been establish for collecting
money to be used in South Florida and they even have
provisions for credit card donations to the disaster
relief. Donations of money by check or money order will
also be welcome. Make your check or money order out to:
FLorida Relief Fund. Send it to:

FLorida Relief Fund
P.O. Box 7000
Tallahassee, FLorida 32314 U.S.A.

Credit card donations may be called into the FLorida Relief
Center on either MasterCard or Visa [no, they don't take
American Express].

A staging area for the delivery of goods has been set up in
Palm Beach County to preclude the direct transportation
from everywhere that is seriously clogging the passable
roads into south Dade County. Items received will be
warehoused and transported as needed into the storm strike
zone.

Anyone with goods for the relief effort are requested to
take them to the South Florida Fairgrounds in West Palm
Beach or to send them there by whatever shipping means
available to them.

I have just spoken to the Relief Center and here's the
direct scoop and particulars:

Florida Relief Center
South Florida Fairgrounds
9067 Southern Blvd
West Palm Beach, FLorida 33411 U.S.A.
24 hours telephone - 1-800-354-3571.

The Fairgrounds are accessible from either I-95 or the
Florida Turnpike. From I-95, take the Southern Blvd exit
west and continue west for about 10 miles. From the Florida
Turnpike, take the Okeechobee/West Palm Beach exit west and
continue west about 1 1/2 miles.

FidoNews 9-36                  Page 6                      14 Sep 1992


The exits are well marked, according to the Center
personnel, and signs will direct you after you exit either
highway to the Fairgrounds.

The following list contains the current needs in rough,
priority order:

NO CLOTHING AT THE PRESENT TIME, PLEASE.

Non-perishable food items of all kinds. There is NO
refrigeration in most of the strike zone. Canned and
packeted goods in original containers are welcome.

Baby food and formulas of all kinds and plastic baby
bottles, inserts and nipples.

Bottled water in factory sealed bottles [NO volunteer
filled bottles, please] of gallon or larger sizes. Cases of
water very desirable.

Disposable diapers and baby cleansing cloths; baby powder;
baby ointment.

Insect repellents and sun screens including those for
sensitive skin.

NON-PRESCRIPTION, OTC [over-the-counter] medications of
non-perishable type such as aspirin, acetaminophen [Tylenol,
Panadol, etc.], ibuprofen [Midol, Bayer IB, etc.] in tablets
and liquids for children; cold and cough medicines; allergy
medicines; basic first-aid supplies such as bandages,
dressings, antibacterial ointments, band-aids, rolled gauze,
elastic bandages [ACE, etc.], rubbing alcohol, hydrogen
peroxide, and cotton swabs. NO prescription or perishable
meds, please.

Personal and feminine hygiene products such as: toilet
paper, personal cleansing towels [Softkins, Baby wipes,
WetNaps, etc.]; tampons, sanitary napkins; toothbrushes and
toothpaste; disposable razors; anti-perspirants and
deodorants; bleach.; tissues and paper towels.

Equipment and supplies: NON-electric can openers; generators
up to 300KW [kilowatts]; propane for forklifts and tractors
at the Relief Center and down south; batteries and
flashlights; chainsaws; shovels, rakes, picks; plastic tarps
or large sheets of plastic.

These are just the main things, if you can think of other
things of use, call the Relief Center and see if they are
needed or wanted. They need to keep their space available
for the priority items.

FidoNews 9-36                  Page 7                      14 Sep 1992


The Relief Center is OPEN every day, 24 hours a day. All
convoys from FLorida and the rest of the U.S. and the world
should head for West Palm Beach and avoid direct importation
of goods into the south Florida area. There are security and
logistical problems down there right now that are only
compounded by all the extra traffic. PLEASE take your
donations to the FLorida Relief Center!

Thanks, for all the survivors!

PLEASE PASS THIS MESSAGE TO ALL DATALINK SERVICES
EVERYWHERE!!

Teens In Fidonet...

        As you may have noticed in the latest few editions of
FidoNews, there has been some controversy between teenagers who have
applied for Fidonet nodes and some of the "veteran" Sysops.

        Personally, I had no problems recieving my Fidonet node, and
I am one of the youngest Sysops in Fidonet at 13!

FidoNews 9-36                  Page 8                      14 Sep 1992


        There really aren't any discussion echos for Teenage Sysops.
TOTT_SYSOP was defined as Turn On To Teens Sysop Companion Echo.  I
don't want a companion echo, but a general Teenage Sysop discussion
area.  Since there aren't any, I went ahead and formed one.  If you
would like it, please Areafix it from me at 1:233/24.  The name is
TEENOP.

                Thanks For Your Time...
                [Eddie Thomson]

"Two new HAPPY echoes ... NOT!!!!!!"
From/By: Josh Burke, Tacoma, Washington, 1:138/174


*clap clap* Well done, Tom!

        Announcing two new not-yet backbone distributed echoes for
FidoNET.  These echoes will probably not cater to the average sysop,
but I'm sure some of your users could use these two new echoes.

 FLIRTS_NOOK (name courtesy of TheFlirt@aol.aol.com) is a echo for
those of
 us who are flirtively inclined.  In short, I consider myself a
compulsive
 flirt, meaning that I flirt with anyone of the opposite sex at any
time that
 it may or may not be deemed acceptable.  And this is EXACTLY what
this echo
 is for.  Aliases allowed, real names allowed, anonymous is not
allowed.

 SUICIDE_CHAT is a serious discussion of a dark topic.  So many times
in my
 life it would be nice to be able to talk about it, openly, with other
people
 that feel the same way, so this is my answer to it! :>  Serious messages
 only please.  Aliases, real nyms, and anonymous allowed.

Currently these echoes are available only from 1:138/174, but as we
expand our little chatnetwork, we'll try to get you a feed as local as
possible!

If you would like to join, just netmail me your fido address, session
password and which or both echoes you would like.  Thanks! *flirt
flirt*
