     =================================================================


     Beginning with FidoNews 1340, the distribution archive format will be
     ZIP. Instead of FNEWSDnn.LZH, you will be receiving FNEWSDnn.ZIP via
     the standard FIDONEWS file channels. BE SURE to update your batch
     files and/or script routines to allow for this change of archiver.

     Please note in the Masthead that I've already changed my U.S. mail
     contact address. FidoNews ops will remain at 1:1/23 but the phone
     number will be changing in NODELIST.271. My primary Node will also
     change from 1:374/14 to 1:18/14 on 27 Sep 96. If you wish to put in
     an override on the 27th pending your receipt of your new Nodelist you
     can set 1:1/23 and 1:18/14 to: 1-904-409-7040 in Edgewater_FL. The
     phone company assures me the new number will be functional by 1800 on
     Friday, 27 Sep 96. The old number will have a forwarding info
     recording on it for 3 months for those who aren't too sharp in keeping
     their Nodelists up-to-date.

     These changes should be fairly painless if everyone stays aware of the
     timetable. I will continue to issue these gentle reminders through the
     changeover. [grin]

     Unlike the previous weeks, there was no answer at all from anyone
     about Echolists in other Zones. Does this mean there aren't any?

     I'm happy to report that this week's Humor and Comix are not from my
     archives but from actual contributors! I'd like to see a lot more of
     that in future Issues. Thanks.

     C.B.

     comp.org.fidonet - It's Full of Life!
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindnes@csl.co.uk

     I'm sure quite a few people have noticed the comp.org.fidonet
     newsgroup on Usenet. This is a moderated group, that has never been
     posted into in all the time i've been subscribed to it (about 2-3
     years).

     Wondering what its purpose was i set out asking a couple of questions.
     From what i can gather it used to be used to distribute FidoNews
     articles and the moderator of the group is one of the former editors.
     Anyone else got more information?

     Perhaps the group could be used again to distribute the Snooze, or
     even throw it open for general Fidonet discussion (would be great for
     arranging cross zone feeds and so on). Of course we'd have to find the
     moderator, or does anyone know how the group could be 'unmoderated'?

     Hmmmm...

     Response to "Two Choices: UPGRADE or DIE"
     by Phil Roberts, 1:157/554

     >We need to be progressive, up-to-the-minute with technology.

     We're in agreement here.  :)

     >BinkleyTerm and Maximus just don't cut it in '96.  Today's users
     >(and sysops) want advanced graphics, and easy-to-setup software.

     BinkleyTerm is difficult to set up the first time, but I provide
     sample BINKLEY.CFG and BINK.BAT so new sysops can just copy my setup.
     This method has worked well, and a number of people have used my
     sample batch files for both BinkleyTerm and FrontDoor.

     >And we need to make it easy for people to GET NODE NUMBERS!

     Anyone wanting a node number in my area needs only to download a
     short file called HOWAPPLY.TXT and follow the _simple_ directions.
     While POLICY4 is a must read for new sysops, HOWAPPLY is a simple
     cheat sheet.  This could be implemented in any net in Fidonet.

     >Using mail and news on the Internet is dirt simple with all the new
     >graphical-based software available.  In contrast, the average BBS
     >package used by a FidoNet sysop is quite clumsy and hard to figure
     >out by comparison.  This is not necessary.  Sysops want to hold onto
     >the BBS package they were running back in '85.  This is ridiculous -
     >you don't still use the computer you used in '85, do you?  Then why
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 3                    9 Sep 1996


     >use its software?

     Nope.  I sold my Apple //'s back in 1991.  I'm running the current
     revision of Maximus.  I've been running a BBS since 1988, and changed
     to Maximus in 1995 because of it's incredible versatility.  This is
     my 3rd BBS software, and I've tried many others without putting them
     up for the users.

     >Even up-to-the-microsecond graphical BBS packages
     >like Excalibur for Windows now have Fidonet capability.

     Very user friendly, but these BBS hosts require the user to download a
     dedicated client to use them.  How many BBS clients will a user
     download before tiring of this?

     >There's even a fully Windows-based mailer that's NOT simply an old
     >MS-DOS mailer with a Windows shell wrapped around it.  And how many
     >such systems are in FidoNet?  To my knowledge, ONE -- Myself.

     Would this be Platinum Xpress?  If Hector ever fixes Areafix, Filefix,
     and gets Platinum to reliably connect with other mailers, I'll respect
     this mailer.

     >Even from a Sysop standpoint, joining FidoNet is difficult.  You've
     >got to first figure out how the whole thing works, and there's NOT
     >ONE SINGLE CREDIBLE DOCUMENT ON IT ANYWHERE!

     BIGDUMMY.ARJ is a good file, albeit a few years old.

     >The average person has this "hard-to-use-straight-ugly-ASCII-based"
     >view of what FidoNet is, even if they've never used a FidoNet system.
     >This has to be changed.

     In case you haven't noticed, the *.INI files in your Windows system
     are also text files.  The only thing lacking in the Bink/Max mentality
     is a decent menu-driven setup program.  I go FAR out of my way to
     make my BBS very easy to use.  I'm sure many other sysops do this too.

     >There's plenty of DOS-based ANSI system which use
     >lightbar menus and such, which is light years ahead of where 95% of
     >Fidonet systems are right now.

     My Maximus BBS has RIP emulation, lightbar file tagging in the file
     transfer system, and 7 different user-selectable ANSI menus!  One
     of these ANSI menus uses lightbars.  It can also be ported to
     Windows or OS/2 when the needs of the BBS require it.  Maximus isn't
     married to DOS, and doesn't have to be plain looking.

     >People won't put up with it for long.  Eventually, the only thing
     >the SPAMmers will be able to SPAM to are OTHER SPAMMERS!  People will
     >need somewhere else to talk.  Will it be FidoNet?  It could be.

     Because of Fidonet's message control, the Fidonet message bases are
     smaller and contain a better content than most Usenet newsgroups.
     Users also don't run the risk of spam email every time they post.

     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 4                    9 Sep 1996


     Fidonet does need some rethinking in a number of places, but Bink
     and Max aren't the reasons for the decline in the size of the
     nodelist.  There are easier packages for sysops to install, and
     many sysops take that route.

     The problems with EP2 (ep1eu) in Zone 2
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindnes@csl.co.uk

      > ZEC2 has a lengthy article in this Issue about a new Zone 2 Echopol
      > All those affected please take note. Other Zones might want to pay
      > attention as well for future reference.

     While my support is 100% behind Steve in the creation of a new
     echomail policy for zone 2 this document simply is not in force. I'll
     point out a couple of flaws:

      o Steve publicly announced in a number of echoes that EP1 was
        in force in zone 2, and he would abide by its guidelines in the
        creation of a new policy.

      o 1 week later (or thereabout) he announces his rehash of EP1
        is now the echomail policy. Hang on, what happened to the
        vote of the regions REC's to support a policy change?

      o The changes in 'EP2' are minor. Do a diff on the two and you'll
        find that most of the changes are "national"->"Regional",
        "policy3"->"policy4", "insure"->"ensure" and a lot of ZEC
        references to REC. Why bother with such a minor change?

      o The policy covers the zone 2 echomail backbone and any echo
        the moderator wishes it to cover. Zone 2 does not have a
        echomail backbone (we have regional backbones due to language
        differences). In the wildest imagination less than 10 echoes
        could be considered to be on a 'zone 2 backbone" at the moment
        (ENET.SYSOP...). Don't get me wrong, a zone 2 backbone is a
        good idea (for technical, sysop and other echoes) but you can't
        enforce policy on an entity that does not currently exist.
        Steve has to setup a zone 2 backbone first!

     I didn't wish to take these concerns and observations in Fidonews.
     However my (and others) questions to Steve in ECHOPOL2 were left
     unanswered.

     A Californian point of view:  Comment to Fredrik Bennison
     Fredric Rice (frice@stbbs.com) 1:218/890.0
     The Skeptic Tank (818) 335-9601

     Fredrik (2:205/300.0) brought up a couple of good points in
     the 2/Sep/1996 issue of FidoNews which I would like to briefly
     comment upon.
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 5                    9 Sep 1996


     The first is about NetMail routing success here in Zone 1 at
     times being haphazard.  I'm not so sure there is very much
     of a problem sending and receiving NetMail.  Though I can't
     know if something didn't reach my system without implementing
     checks to find out, my inbound Net Mail folder is always full
     of routed mail awaiting my attention.

     Fredrik, I would suggest that if there are Net coordinators who
     do not accept both inbound and outbound NetMail, it _might_ be
     better to _vote_ them out of the position rather than impose a
     rule that they do so.  (Always assuming there is someone who is
     willing to accept the job, of course.)  I don't have P4 here
     with me (I'm at work sluffing off) yet I'm surprised that there
     isn't already such a rule.  If there isn't, I find it mildly
     distasteful having rules added to this hobby of ours.  Call up
     a vote and "throw the bumbs out" as we say here in the States.

     As for Policy 4 needing revamping, I couldn't agree more.  Our
     shiney new FidoNews editor had been coordinating a serious effort
     to develop Policy 5 for some time now and it looks like inertia
     is keeping the somewhat outdated Policy 4 in force.  And isn't
     there an ECHO forum specifically set up to discuss the eventual
     Policy 5?  If there isn't, that would be a good place to start.

     New Look for the World-Wide-Web Fidonet Resource
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, lkindness@csl.co.uk


     The World-Wide-Web Fidonet Resource (w3fr) has recently been given a
     major overhaul. It has been split up into easier to navigate sub
     sections, been given a major cosmetic job (in response to several
     suggestions regarding the former background pattern) and, as always,
     a couple more links added. So aim your browsers at:

           http://www.scms.rgu.ac.uk/students/cs_yr94/lk/fido.html

     The old, all in one page, version of the w3fr is still available as a
     link off the new page.


     I'm always open to suggestions (and constructive criticism) for new
     links. To get a link added simply send me:

      o Region, Net or Node homepage - Fidonet address, URL, nodelist
        name and common name (ie the country for regions...)

      o Fidonet software support page - Package name, URL, OS(s) supported,
        function (ie editor, tosser, packer, mailer...)

      o Any other link - URL, a short description and any other details.

     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 6                    9 Sep 1996


     It would be great if you could add a link to the w3fr from your own
     personal pages on the web (esp. if i add a link to yours ;) There
     are probably quite a lot of 'nasties' on the pages at the moment,
     spelling mistakes, mistyped URLs, out-of-date URLs and such like.
     These will be ironed out ASAP, if you notice any drop me an email.

     EchoMail...Now What?
     by Zorch Frezberg, 1:205/1701

     These are the words that are the key to most controversy.

     - 9.9  Echomail
     -
     -Echomail is an important and powerful force in FidoNet.  For the
     -purposes of Policy Disputes, echomail is simply a different flavor
     -of netmail, and is therefore covered by Policy.  By its nature,
     -echomail places unique technical and social demands on the net over
     -and above those covered by this version of Policy.  In recognition
     -of this, an echomail policy which extends (and does not contradict)
     -general Policy, maintained by the Echomail Coordinators, and ratified
     -by a process similar to that of this document, is recognized by the
     -FidoNet Coordinators as a valid structure for dispute resolution on
     -matters pertaining to echomail.  At some future date the echomail
     -policy document may be merged with this one.

     In deference to Fredrik Bennison, I would ask where in Policy 4 it
     is that content of a message is grounds for excommunication or other
     actions that have been performed by many a *C or *EC under the guise
     of a Policy Complaint.

     If his interpretation of Policy is upheld, then we could all be
     subject to excommunication for "Excessively Annoying Behavior" by
     *any* complaint we make, should we rub the *C or *EC the wrong way.

     I will submit that any violation or failure to comply with the FTSC
     operational standards would fit in for a Policy Complaint, but the
     matter of _content_ of echomail, as well as netmail, is reserved to
     only a very few and very specific details.

     No software piracy, no criminal activity, and no posting publicly
     something different in echomail than you're willing to post in
     netmail.  And, as to criminal activity, there is always the standard
     of whether or not it is provable as a crime...something so far out of
     the jurisdiction of Fido, I strongly doubt that there will ever be
     a properly adjudicated Policy Complaint that will deal with this.

     But the content of echomail, so long as it meets these criteria, is
     immune from any form of Policy Complaint.  Without breaking these,
     neither netmail *NOR* echomail is subject to Policy Complaint, and
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 7                    9 Sep 1996


     no node can be _legitimately_ excommunicated for such.

     Too many people are willing to restrict your rights and mine, to keep
     us from saying things that might discredit, harm or sully their own
     particular beliefs, and are more than willing to prevent you or I
     from even being able to start competitive echoes or conferences in
     which we can continue without their harrasment.

     It is so simple and easy to eliminate anyone who disagrees with us,
     if we adopt Bennison's concept of echomail...all one needs do is
     declare that it 'offends' and is therefore 'excessively annoying',
     and by Policy Complaint, we remove such an 'annoyance' by means of
     excommunication, unable to start a competing echo without the most
     fortunate luck and massive inconvenience.

     In reality, this hopefully would not happen, and anyone in the *C
     chain who has half a mind for independent thinking would realize this
     was a 'put-up' job and declare the Policy Complaint null and void.

     Unfortunately, there have already been cases where the 'witch-hunt'
     mentality takes over and the entire chain of authority decides it much
     simpler to excommunicate someone than deal with the issues that are
     being brought up, regardless of how relevant and important these may
     be.

     We are a system of communication...good and bad, we do not filter out
     nor censor materials until after they have violated specifically
     defined parameters, all contained within Policy and existing BackBone
     operations procedures...or rather, we should not.

     To try and extend that power to limiting echo access by threat or act
     of excommunication under the pretense of upholding Policy is a
     ghastly and terrible mistake...one in which the ability to speak and
     discuss matters freely is taken from us and put in the hands of a very
     small-minded minority.

     Deranged And Demented

     Dear Fidonews Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Charles Herriot (1:163/110) who
     dragged Doc Logger from a life of depravity in what was
     either a house of Belgian Nuns, or else Bill Clinton's
     campaign headquarters. When his horrible screaming for more
     DDT to spray the GIANT bats which coursed through his vision
     had died down, he was lashed to a keyboard. Unfortunately,
     the following was all that he produced before he lapsed into
     a chant which sounded like "John Denver for President."

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     I think we may be in deeper trouble than I'd imagined. I
     have just emerged from cryogenic storage to discover that
     the deranged and demented policymongers in Zone 2 are
     proposing another version of 'Das Echopol.' What is it with
     these poor sods, don't they have small animals to abuse like
     the rest of us? Quite frankly, these silly gits should be
     inflated with nitrous oxide and have Debbie Boone's "You
     Light Up My Life" played until either their ears bleed, or
     they give up on the notion that you should legislate a
     cooperative effort. They just don't get it. The more rules
     they promulgate, the more time some poor soul has to spend
     adjudicating the inevitable flood of complaints "under
     policy."

     I also noticed that diehards are still flogging the Peefour
     policy horse. I guess it needs to be said at least once a
     year, but PeeFour has as much jurisprudent weight in Fidonet
     as Dan Quayle has brains. Sheesh. PeeFour was promulgated
     without vote, without ratification, and without reason, by
     cloacally impaired dwarves who couldn't grasp the concepts
     which made Fidonet worthwhile.

     Enough piffle about policywankers, on to world news. Visage,
     developments of the last day have me worried. I feel certain
     that the next time I invade my teenmonster's room for
     purposes of restoring order, that Wet Willy Clinton will lob
     cruise missiles at my house. Let me state at the outset that
     Saddam Hussein is despotic, insane, brutal and in need of
     serious attitude judgment (very similar to the Los Angeles
     police department.) But I am having trouble understanding
     why Wet Willy is sending in the Tomahawks over a Kurdish
     dispute which has been raging for a mere 2,000 years. In
     fact, world peace would be helped immeasurably by letting
     Saddam's divisions get mired in a battle with the Kurds
     who'd whup the Republican Guard by breakfast. The Excited
     States certainly have some strange notions about their place
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 9                    9 Sep 1996


     as the gatekeepers for democracy. Say, have you noticed
     whether Kuwaittis have had a democratic election recently?

     To turn to Fidonet navel-gazing. I notice that more and more
     of the Snooz is devoted to those who get a stiffie about
     gating Internet AntFarmMail(tm) into Fidoland. What, they
     don't think we have enough drooling idiocy in our own
     messages and have to import global illiteracy from Internet?
     The simple truth is, Internet newsgroups consist largely of
     cretinous trolls whose flippers flail at the quote key and
     then append monosyllabic grunts to the end. (Imagine reading
     a Ross Perot speech and you get the picture.) Since Fidonet
     was whored to the planetary beings, I don't suppose it
     matters much; but it would be nice if all of the effort
     expended on cross-linking Internet to Fidonet could be
     applied to sending John Denver to Mars - a noble and
     practical solution to at least half of the world's problems.

     I must go Visage, your secretary is wailing like a marmoset
     in heat and this has really nothing at all to do with the
     fact I've been rapid-firing the flare gun at the fridge. She
     just doesn't understand that I am being an International
     statesman and am "putting down a rebellion of cheese curds."
     Kurds, curds - what the hell is the difference? In any
     event, I do not think that your secretary is a well-balanced
     person, Visage, and at the earliest opportunity we should
     send her to Chadron, Nebraska.

     Regards,
     Doc Logger,
     Giant Clam Psychologist,
     Furlang Island, South Pacific

                              FIDONET HISTORY
     =================================================================


     [These examples are part of the continuing series on FidoNet History]

     This was the first Netmail message sent to a potential new Node when I
     was NC135:

     --------------
     [NEWNODE.35Q]

     Attached is an excerpt of the current Policy document governing the
     operation of FidoNet.

     In this file you will find some questions that require response prior
     to your receipt of an official FidoNet Node number.

     Please return the answers to these questions in a message to me as
     soon as possible. Answers received by 1200 on Tuesdays can be
     processed for inclusion in that Friday's Nodelist. Answers received
     after that time will not appear until the following Friday week.

     You are authorized to use the Node number of 135/___ on a temporary
     basis until you have been officially processed into the Nodelist.

     Even though you are assigned a temporary number, you may not request
     Echomail from the NEC (135/142) until your Node number actually
     appears in the weekly Nodelist. Which Friday your Node number appears
     depends entirely on the timeliness of your response to this message.
     Any requests not received by 1200 on Saturday may not appear in the
     following Friday's list but will appear the week after that. The
     Tuesday noon deadline mentioned above is not a guarantee for inclusion
     for that week's Nodelist.

     If you have any questions, you may reach me anytime via Netmail.

     Thank you for your interest in FidoNet.

     TTFN.
     Chris
     Net 135 Coordinator

                                       =====

     This would be the next Netmail sent after the new Node successfully
     passed the direct Netmail test from system to system:

     --------------
     [NEWNODE.135]

     You are assigned Node number 135/__. This will be your identification
     for all FidoNet activities.

     Please send a Session Password to be used between our systems via
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 11                   9 Sep 1996


     Netmail with your acknowledgment of receipt of this message. If your
     mailer software does not support the WaZoo Session password, please
     note that in your reply.

     You will receive two files every week. The Nodelist and the FidoNews.
     The Nodelist will be sent as NODEDIFF.Ann and FidoNews will be sent as
     FNEWSnnn.ARC. These files are currently being distributed from 135/10,
     135/60 and 135/69. Please contact Peter Adenauer, John Sawyer or Tim
     Eagan on those systems for Polling schedule.

     In order for you to properly send and receive mail within this Net, it
     will be necessary for you to adopt and install the following schedule.
     Net 135 operates three windows for Netmail.  0430-0500 is for Local to
     Host traffic.  0500-0600 is for Zone Mail Hour (ZMH).  0600-0630 is
     for Host to Local traffic.  You may operate any other schedules you
     wish as long as they do not interfere with Net 135 ops.  These times
     are Eastern Daylight Savings Time.  When we return to Eastern Standard
     Time, each window will be exactly one hour earlier (0330-0400; 0400-
     0500; 0500-0530). ZMH is for NetMail processing ONLY. No other
     activity is permitted during ZMH.  Operating ZMH for anything except
     NetMail is grounds for immediate excommunication. Ignorance of this
     Policy is no excuse.

     Attached is a file containing FidoNet Policy documents, New Sysop
     information and the schedule of events that take place on this system.
     The Crash events are times to avoid calling as a connect is extremely
     unlikely during an outbound Crash event.  As a FidoNet Node, you are
     completely responsible for reading and abiding by the Policy documents
     with regard to your operations within FidoNet. The New Sysop info is
     provided to assist you in your operations at the BBS level.

     As a Sysop in Net 135, you are eligible to participate in several
     local and Regional Echo conferences. NETSYSOP is a local Net 135 Sysop
     ONLY Echo. It is available from the Echo Host (135/142) or other Net
     135 Nodes.  REGION18 is a Region 18 Echo for users and Sysops. SYSOP18
     is a Sysop ONLY Echo for Region 18 Sysops information. REGION18 and
     SYSOP18 are available from the Echo Host (363/3), the Net 135 Echo
     Coordinator (135/142) or this system.  Normally, you will not access
     the REC from a Net 135 address.  The NEC at 135/142 will supply you
     with your Echomail feeds from the Backbone system or other local
     feeds. You may not request or receive Echomail from the NEC UNTIL your
     Node number appears in the Nodelist.

     As a member of Net 135, you accept responsibility for the activities
     on your Node as they relate to the integrity of the SFLorida Net and
     the FidoNet, at large. Member Nodes of Net 135 are expected to
     maintain a legal operation and to disallow any activity that might
     reflect poorly on the rest of the Net. After six months of established
     operation, you may wish to apply for membership in the South Florida
     System Operators Association and adopt their formal code of BBS
     conduct.

     If the terms of this message are clear and acceptable, you may reply
     via Netmail and I will place you in the update file for addition to
     the next applicable Nodelist. (Note: any applications not processed
     prior to 1200 on Tuesday will probably not make it into that week's
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 12                   9 Sep 1996


     Nodelist and will appear the following week.)

     If these terms are unacceptable, you may apply for an independent Node
     number as a member of Region 18 (S.E.). The Region Coordinator for
     Region 18 is Ben Mann at 1:151/2 in North Carolina. The process is
     basically the same, although you are only required to observe the ZMH
     for Netmail.

     If neither alternative is acceptable, you may operate as a private BBS
     or you may appeal your case to the Zone 1 Coordinator, George Peace,
     1/0, in Harrisburg_PA.

     Thank you for your interest in SFLorida Net, 135.

     TTFN.
     Chris

                                       =====

     This would be a message in response to a new Sysop or user about the
     vagaries of Echomail ops:

     --------------
     [ECHOMAIL.EXP]

      > I am new to this "echo" or "network".  How does one
      > send a message to another BBS?  Can someone show me an
      > example?

     you are entering your message in an Echo conference. to the user,
     entering a message in an Echo is just like entering a message in a
     regular message area. the difference, however, is the scope of
     coverage. a local message is confined to that one system on which it
     was entered.  a message in an Echo is scanned (eventually) by the
     software running the BBS or by a utility and packaged into a form that
     will be sent to another system in a chain of systems participating in
     that particular Echo. the coverage of that message expands
     geometrically as it is retransmitted from system to system to system.
     an Echo may be local (a few systems), national (more systems) or, as
     this one is, international (hundreds of systems all over the world).
     in this Echo, your question has gone from the local system you entered
     it on to many other systems in the U.S., Europe and the Pacific. this
     answer is now following the same route. you will probably receive many
     others.

     since Echos go everywhere and people are paying to get them
     transported, it is very important to keep messages entered into Echos
     on the subject for which they were formed. this International Users
     Echo is relatively wide open subject-wise but many Echos have limited
     or narrow scope. this Echo is for communicating with the rest of the
     world on many subjects and most posts would be allowed without
     comment. it would be inappropriate, for example, to post a message
     about saving the whales in the Hard Drive conference or a 'Hi, are you
     going to that party at Bob's?' message in a national conference where
     Bob is unknown.

     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 13                   9 Sep 1996


     most Echos are moderated by someone and rules are usually posted on a
     regular basis to keep subjects germane and the Echo moving in the
     right direction. the rules for an Echo are often found as the first
     message in that Echo.

     to send a message directly to another system requires using Netmail
     which is a special message area on a FidoNet system that usually
     requires prearranged credit to send non-local messages. credit is
     arranged with the Sysop of that system although some offer Netmail use
     for free and some don't offer it to users at all. having established
     credit for Netmail, one enters a message as usual but also needs to
     know the Netmail address of the recipient as well as their name.
     Netmail addresses are in the form of Zone:Net/Node which is usually
     entered simply by the User as Net/Node. for example, if you wanted to
     send me a Netmail message, you would address it to my name and when
     prompted for my Node number would enter 135/14.  135 represents Net
     135 in Zone 1 which is the SFLorida Net based in Miami_FL_USA. 14 is
     my individual system Node number in that Net.  Netmail is the basis of
     all structure within FidoNet which is grouped geographically into
     Zones, Regions, Nets and Nodes.

      > Also, how are people repeating part of a message?  I
      > see a ">" followed by some text of another message and
      > wondered how this was accomplished.   Does the sender
      > of the message type this in themselves or is there a
      > way to make the system do it.

     quoting a message is accomplished in different ways by different
     software.  the instructions for same are usually in help files
     contained on the system you are using.

     TTFN.

                                       =====

     And finally, this would be a 'baton passing' message to a new NC:

     --------------
     [NEWNC135.MSG]

     Date: 13 Aug 90  03:34:54
     From: Christopher Baker
       To: Alan Criado on 135/142  Merlin's Mailroom in Miami FL
     Subj: stanmsgs.zip net135\n135*.zip d:\file\fnet\new135pk.zip
     ______________________________________________________________________

     here are the files you need to do the NC thing.

     STANMSGS contains a bunch of stuff created over the years to deal with
     standard questions and Node number applications. you can throw out the
     stuff that doesn't pertain to Net 135 ops. you will primarily be using
     UPDATE.135, NEWNODE.35Q and NEWNODE.135.

     NEWNODE.35Q is read into the editor when a first request is received
     but without the full info requested by UPDATE.135. some new systems
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 14                   9 Sep 1996


     will pick up this file and some won't. most of the time, all you get
     is the Sysop name and the system phone number. once that come in, i
     check the next number in sequence and edit in a dummy Node with the
     requesting system's phone number.  i then enter a message to that new
     Node and attach UPDATE.135 for more info.  i insert the new Node
     number in the slot provided in NEWNODE.35Q and send it to the
     requesting system.

     NEWNODE.135 is sent after the UPDATE.135 info comes in and is checked
     for completeness. i insert the new Node number again and attach
     NEW135PK.ZIP which contains a lot of helpful stuff for a new Sysop.

     both NEWNODE.135 and NEWNODE.35Q have been modified for your temporary
     assignment as NC 135.

     there isn't really much to it. the only thing a system needs to
     qualify for a Node number is the ability to send and receive direct
     Netmail. the only reason to deny an application would be to exclude a
     known twit {xxxxx xxxxxx comes to mind} or someone previously
     excommunicated for cause.

     if it looks like a Node is going to be accepted when i send out the
     first packet, i go ahead and put it into the Net segment. the Net
     segment must be sent to the RC at 151/2 by 1200 on Wednesday to make
     the cut for Friday's list. the Net segment must be updated anytime a
     listing changes. it must be ARCed with the password xxxxxx and given
     the extension of .Ann where nn is the last two digits of the julian
     date for the upcoming Friday [just add 7 to the last compiled list].

     this week's list has already been fixed for Friday and i will continue
     to update it as necessary until the final version for .229 is sent in.
     i will then resend the latest copy to you for any adjustments required
     for .236.

     i edit it by hand using a text editor. all the fields must be correct
     and complete with all spaces delineated as underscores [_]. any
     missing or incorrect field will be kicked out by the RC's compiler and
     an error message sent back to the originator.

     it is not as complicated as it sounds. [grin]

     good luck.

     Date: 13 Aug 90  03:39:03

     ______________________________________________________________________

     here is the Net segment as it stands at this moment.

     when ever you do an update, you need to send a copy to Peter Adenauer
     so he can update the SYSOP.135 list. i also forward a copy of new
     applications [completed ones only] to him for addition to the list.

     i do all the processing [ARCing, file sends] in a batchfile. it is

     attached.

     let me know if you have any questions on any of this stuff.

     i will also place a copy of these explanatory messages into
     STANMSGS.ZIP to make it easier for you to get the elected NC going,
     whenever that happens.

     Date: 13 Aug 90  03:58:05

       To: Alan Criado on 135/142  Merlin's Mailroom in Miami FL
     Subj: weekly files
     ______________________________________________________________________

     the Nodelist and Nodediff files are available from RC18 [you must tell
     him to put you into the distribution] or from the source. i get them
     from 1/0 but you may do whatever works best for you. they are
     available from 1/0 after 2330 on Thursday or from 151/2 after 0100 on
     Friday.

     the FidoNews is available from RC18 [i get that from him] or from 1/1.
     it's usually easier to get it from RC18 and is available after 0600 on
     Mondays.

     you must poll for anything being distributed from RC18 or f/r from the
     sources.

     135/10, 135/60, and 135/69 are distribution Nodes for these files and
     are sent both list and diff as well as the news as soon as they come
     in.

     i also send diffs to: 43 [hold], 71, 88, 990, and 18/68. i send news
     to: 43 [hold] and 990. they are all available for f/r and many systems
     call here for it but never asked for formal distribution. i usually
     refer distribution requests to one of the three dist. Nodes to avoid
     loading up this system with full list requests.

     i would advise maintaining this schedule until a new NC is elected and
     then let that person formulate whatever works best for them. keep in
     mind, that an NC is not required to maintain the level of service of a
     previous NC above and beyond the basic requirements of passing on Host
     routed mail and the weekly files.

     most Nets don't get their lists until Saturday or Sunday or their news
     till Wednesday or Thursday. it's always been a point of pride with me
     to get them out as soon as they are released. with a 9600 bps modem,
     that should be even easier. [grin]

     that's all i can think of now.

     TTFN.

     Six Mail Processors Reviewed [IV]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     Half way there!  This is the fourth article in a six-part series, in
     which I take a look at six mail processors and let you know what I
     find.  This week it is the turn of IMail.  A full feature table
     covering all six mail processors will appear in the final article of
     the series.

     IMAIL

         IMail, as has been mentioned in the previous article, is the
     creation of Andreas Klein.  The version on test here is IMail-386
     1.70, which I know is not the latest version by a long way.  However,
     it was not until after testing started that two kind souls (Trevor
     Cook of 2:2502/75 and Kev Baillie of 2:2502/1) dropped off a copy of
     IMail 1.75.  I have also seen versions 1.80 and 1.85 on tear lines in
     various echoes.
         As all the work which surrounds these reviews is a time-consuming
     process (installation, browsing the documentation and the package
     itself, not to mention preparing the package for the speed tests), I
     have been loathe to go through it all again.
         Having said that,  I will make sure that the feature table
     contains the details of the very latest version I have here.  This is
     currently 1.75, but if some kind soul can tell me where I can obtain a
     later version in the UK (or via the Internet), then the feature table
     can be even more up-to-date.
         Bear this in mind when thinking of the features I mention, and
     note that 1.70 isn't that old a release; the executables are dated
     September 1995.
         Now that I've made my excuses, on with the review...

     First Impressions

         My first impressions of this package were very good.  It seemed to
     me, looking over the feature list and the documentation, that I was
     looking at a package with a feature count to rival that of FastEcho.
     On the feature list I have penned on a scrap of paper here the columns
     for both packages look very similar, with little ticks in all the same
     places, and very few crosses in the others.
         The documentation is rather slim though; this package has around
     the same number of pages as that for GEcho, while the program itself
     has features which would justify a tome the size of FastEcho's manual.
     However, as mentioned in the review of FMail, size doesn't always
     matter.  And if you like a bit of humour in your documentation, take a
     look at IMail's disclaimer section.  I'll say no more about it here...
         One thing that strikes me odd, having seen the packages reviewed
     in the first three articles of the series, is the fact that IMail uses
     separate executables for things which the other packages include in
     the main program.  For instance, the areafix manager and the netmail
     packer each have their own executable, and there exists another
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 18                   9 Sep 1996


     executable for compressing packets.
         One of the executables is the normal full-screen setup program,
     which is a feature common to all the programs reviewed this far. The
     on-line help of this program is unrivalled by any of the other
     packages under review.  It is a full help system, with no blank areas
     that I can find, and it includes a master help index allowing the user
     to browse through the various parts of the setup program, and thus to
     find out a bit about the features of the program itself.

     On Further Examination...

         While I'm on the subject of the help program, I did notice a down
     side of this otherwise jolly and wonderful setup program (no sarcasm
     intended, it really is very good).  On certain screens, you are given
     the option of saving (F10) or aborting (ESC), and pressing ESC brings
     up a prompt allowing you to reconsider.
         This in itself is no disadvantage, of course, until you find that
     this prompt appears even when you've made no changes.  This is quite
     annoying when casually browsing through the options, or taking a final
     look at everything to make sure you've set it up correctly.  A minor
     niggle, I know.
         IMail, like FastEcho, provides support for all the really common
     message base standards-- Hudson, *.MSG, JAM and Squish, so if you are
     thinking of moving to IMail from some other mail processor, you have a
     good chance of being able to use your existing message base with IMail
     (unless it's a proprietary message base like PCBoard or WildCat!, of
     course).
         In previous reviews I have mentioned the problem of providing a
     full list of available echoes for your downlinks, even when you don't
     carry them all.  IMail has no description import utility built in, but
     the areafix processor does include a solution of a different sort, the
     %AVAIL command.
         Most mail processors allow you to hold a copy of your uplink's
     area list so they can check that forwarded requests are for valid
     areas, and also for the purpose of filling in area descriptions.
     While the %LIST of most (all?) mail processors shows only areas
     present in your area database, %AVAIL also shows areas in these uplink
     area lists as well, complete with descriptions.
         IMail has the facility to create new message areas on the fly,
     like FastEcho, when messages appear in unknown areas.  This, as has
     been mentioned in earlier articles, allows points to add areas to
     their setup merely by issuing an areafix command and waiting for the
     new mail to arrive.
         Your area list files for other programs can be updated
     automatically as well.  The amusingly-named IMTHINGS external utility
     can export your configuration to a number of other programs.  This is
     a useful feature for putting in batch files for running on a regular
     basis.
         IMail allows 255 area groups, making a change from the normal 26.
     26 groups is enough for most nodes, but large hubs, or nodes active in
     a large number of networks, might need more than 26 in order to give
     all the security they need; IMail provides for this.
         You can also call other programs before messages are processed
     using IMail, in a similar way to FastEcho.  IMail does not include a
     feature to call a process after tossing messages, though.
         One feature which IMail holds exclusively is the automatic posting
     FIDONEWS 13-37               Page 19                   9 Sep 1996


     of echo rules to downlinks fixing in to an echo.  This function relies
     upon the rule file for each echo being present, of course.  Anyone who
     has waited impatiently for echo rules to be posted before making their
     first contribution to an echo will appreciate this feature at their
     uplink's system.
         The speed tests for IMail are among the most complete in the
     packages reviewed, since it supports all the commonly-used message
     base standards.  Although slower than the two smaller packages
     reviewed already, IMail came in slightly quicker than FastEcho.
         IMail tossed 91 messages into a newly-created Hudson message base
     in 11 seconds.  The same messages tossed into new JAM areas took 15
     seconds-- with identical results for Squish and *.MSG areas.
         Bear in mind, though, that the figures given are for the 386
     version of IMail and the 8086 version of FastEcho, so comparing them
     is useless.  More interesting is the comparison between IMail and
     FMail (both tested 386 version), or IMail and GEcho (the version of
     GEcho under test was not a 386/DPMI program).

     Summary

         You may have noticed that this review contains a number of
     references to FastEcho.  While I am not trying to make direct
     comparisons here, the similarities between the packages in the number
     of features make FastEcho a useful package to relate to; to say that
     IMail shares a feature in common with FastEcho prevents me from having
     to repeat the exact nature of that feature at length (for readers who
     have followed the whole series of articles, that is).
         Leaving the differences and similarities with FastEcho aside to
     consider IMail as a package in its own right, it is very clear that
     IMail is a good choice of mail processor for any system from large
     central Fidonet hubs to leaf nodes and points.
         Besides the features mentioned here, it also contains minor
     features of use to systems with downlinks; the sort of thing you
     wouldn't miss if you didn't have in the first place, but which you
     wouldn't want to do without if you got used to them.  If you are
     considering installing a mail processor or replacing your existing
     software, I recommend you download this package and take a closer
     look.
         In the fifth article of this series, I will examine JMail, a
     program by Jason Steck of 1:285/424 (PROZ Software).

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     Back in my RC and NC days, I used to maintain and distribute message
     files specifically aimed at new Sysops. These files were information
     and queries so each side of the equation knew what was going on and
     what was required. They were basic text files clipped from existing
     policy and augmented as needed for local operations.

     I have heard of others making similar files available to their new
     folks.

     The Question of the Week is:

     Do you have FidoNet primer files to share with other Coordinators and
     Sysops that would make joining FidoNet easier to understand and
     accomplish? If so, where are they, where can we get them, what are
     they called, and when are they available?

     As always, send your answers as Netmail, email, .ARTs, or as Echomail
     messages in the FIDONEWS Echo [available on the Zone 1 Backbone].

     Thanks.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     No excuses; I've fallen behind. There's a lot of info still pending
     from last week that I haven't gotten clarified for this week.

     I've done some reorganization; I think I'll be able to process info
     faster in the future. The real hitch is that situations that happen
     in real life don't conform to any predefined structure.

     Phase-out reminder: All I'm looking for with phase-outs is -one-
     node who still uses the package. Hopefully that node know at least
     who the author is, so I can start back-tracking. I'd prefer not to
     have to drop anything, but I do want to start limiting the list to
     current info...

     Phased out this week: Aurora 1.32b

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: DreamBBS 1.05 Deadline for info: 19 Sep 1996.
       Last week: DMG 2.93 Deadline for info: 12 Sep 1996.
