                     KeyChek -- "Agents" for OPUS?

     One of the biggest additions to my OPUS BBS was a mail checking
     program.  Although I've gone through several of these by now,
     and am not satisfied with any one of them, it still strikes me as
     wonderful that upon logging in, I get a message telling which of
     the hundreds of messages OPUS receives every night are meant for
     me.

     Ok, so I'm easily satisifed.  Not quite. I've been thinking of
     how to improve on mail checkers, and have come upon an idea that
     I think is both simple and powerful. It's the concept of a
     keyword checker.

     With KeyCheck, each user would have a set of keywords, say up to
     10 or so. Every night, KeyCheck would go through the message
     base, and search for the presence of the keywords in the To:,
     and Subject: fields, or if specified, in the text of the
     messages.

     With the proliferation of gateway programs like UFGATE and
     GATEWAY, the Fido To: field is now often used as a gateway
     keyword, rendering conventional mailcheckers useless.  With
     KeyCheck, users would still be able to check for their mail, by
     looking for references in the text of the message.

     I have thought about this, and it seems to me that KeyCheck
     ought to be feasible on an ordinary XT PC receiving say, 500
     messages a day.  With the advent of gateways, and the steadily
     increasing FidoNet traffic, it's time we started thinking about
     creating "agents" as part of FidoNet BBS's.

     I am posting this article in order to get a dialog going on the
     features that a KeyCheck program should have, and the
     enhancement of Fido systems with text search in general.

                Universal Mayhem(c) A real killer!

                         Fredric L. Rice
                           (103/503.1)

     Universal  Mayhem  is  finally available for general Network
     consumption.  There are only a  few  SysOps  who  know  what
     Universal  Mayhem,  (UM),  is so I'll give a very brief run-
     down on it here.

     Universal Mayhem is a Doors (tm)  or  Outside  (tm)  program
     which  is  basically  a  shoot-em-up type game in that those
     players with accounts constantly maintain a space ship in  a
     universe and hunt and fight other ships, maintained by other
     players.   Enemy ships are automated to fight back such that
     they are not "sitting ducks."

     Planetary commerce, subspace  communication  between  users,
     the  Galactic  Police,  black  holes,  remote robot sensors;
     these are some of the things that the current version of  UM
     has to offer.  Alliances between ships may be forged in that
     the  two  allied  ships  may  not  fire  at each other If an
     alliance is broken, the Galactic Police get involved.

     If you attack an enemy ship, it will return  fire  with  its
     torpedoes until  they  run  out, (if they ever do).  When no
     more  torpedoes  exist,  the  automated  ship  switches   to
     phasers.   While  the battle is going on, the automated ship
     will attempt evasive which may result in the running  battle
     from  one  side  of  the  universe  to  the  other, with the
     possible destruction of any planets that happen to be in the
     line of fire, (sorry, guys, happens all  the  time).    When
     destruction seems to be unavoidable, the automated ship will
     attempt  a random jump in any direction for the distance its
     class warp drive will permit, (you must buy  higher  classes
     of  warp  drives  and  even sell them to make profits to buy
     other items).

     A top-ten list is maintained, showing the top ten  strongest
     ships and the top ten killers.  You may name the planets, (a
     universe  that  is  8000  by  8000  sectors  will have 64000
     planets).

     It's considered unfriendly to battle a ship into submission,
     board it, then leave it drifting.    It  is  much  nicer  to
     simply  back  off a sector and send them one last torpedo to
     finish them off.

     Subspace messages are sent to the FidoNet BBS system as  one
     of the  mail  areas.  This can be an echo mail area and will
     be used in the future to exchange subspaces messages  across
     "universes."  AREA:MAYHEM as a matter of fact...

     BUGS - - -

     Well, there  are  a  few of these.  They are NOT going to be
     FidoNews 5-35                Page 3                   29 Aug 1988


     fixed, partly because they are not destructive  faults,  and
     most  importantly  because  the  C  version  is  soon  to be
     released.  The C version allows the maintenance  of  command
     files  which  tell  a  players  ship how to act when various
     other ships are active. 'Run-From' this ship if he gets  too
     close, 'Attack' this ship if he signs in, 'Assist' this ship
     if  he  attacks  someone,  'Defend'  this  ship  if  he gets
     attacked.  These are the various commands that the C version
     has.  The C version also has corresponding white  holes  for
     the black  holes  in  the universe.  Entry into a black hole
     causes the exit at a  known  space  in  the  universe  where
     reentry  into the nearest black hole will return a ship back
     to its point of departure.

     DISADVANTAGES - - -

     Universal Mayhem the current version requires a lot of  disk
     space to run.  Some 1 meg or 1.2 meg of disk space to have a
     universe some 8000 by 8000 sectors.  The C version, which is
     soon to be released, will allow a universe of 32000 by 32000
     sectors using  1  meg.  Testing has shown that a universe of
     64000 by 64000 is easily possible if space is available.

     WHERE, WHAT, WHEN - - -

     If  you  are  interested  in  Universal  Mayhem,  The  BASIC
     version,  it  is  downloadable  from Astro-Net (103/503), at
     714-662-2294.  If you wish, send me network mail along  with
     a FidoNet address and I will upload it to your board so long
     as it  is  in  the  mainland  United States.  If you require
     configuration information, send me network mail.

     If you run Universal Mayhem, let  me  know  through  network
     mail  so  that I may mail you the C version when it hits its
     initial release.  I'll mail a floppy free of charge.

              MAYHEM.ARC - (Downloadable)

              Universal  Mayhem,  the   BASIC   version
              Contains  everything  you need, including
              GATEWAY.ARC for the  console  redirection
              required.    A   sample  config  file  is
              enclosed for a universe of 8000 by  8000.
              The  allowable  time  to play and systems
              password is stored in the config file and
              will need modification.

              CUM.ARC -  (Downloadable)  C  Version  of
              Universal  Mayhem  (Document  only)  This
              file contains the documentation for the C
              version of Universal Mayhem.  It  details
              the  functions  in  the  source  code and
              describes what they do.  At the  function
              level     documentation,    a    complete
              description of the game is available.

              CUMCARD.ARC  -  (Downloadable)   Business
              cards  will  be  mailed to SysOps who run
              the C version of Universal Mayhem.   This
              file describes the business cards and how
              to ask  for them.  I will mail cards free
              of charge to all SysOps so that they  are
              distributed  to  their users also free of
              charge.  The cards sport  a  really  neat
              planet  with  a  sword  plunged  into  it
              surrounded with  wheat   stocks.      The
              symbolism  is  described  in  this  file.
              Cards are used  by  players  to  identify
              them  as Mayhemites and will entitle them
              to nothing.

              UMSOURCE.ARC - (By mail only) The  source
              code,  congesting  of  two  files, is not
              made available for general release.  This
              is  because  of   the   FidoNet   message
              interface  function  which  can  be miss-
              used.  Also, Universal Mayhem  represents
              a LOT  of  work which I want to sell.  If
              you would like to obtain the source code,
              send me ten bucks in a check or something
              and I'll mail a floppy.  The source is in
              Digital Researches Compiler BASIC and  is
              some  200K  or so due to the HEAVY use of
              in-line documentation.    The  code   was
              originally  intended for release into the
              Public Domain and as such was  documented
              because    of    the    need   to   allow
              modifications easily.    The  source   is
              copyrighted and may not be redistributed.

              CUMSOURCE.ARC  - (By mail only at a later
              date) The C version, written in  C,  uses
              linked-list  structures  and contains the
              kernel   of   a    psudomulti-    tasking
              environment.    This   is   intended   to
              automate the ships via command files that
              the players maintain.    Because  of  the
              technology involved in the development of
              the  C  version,  the source is not to be
              made available to the Public Domain, (the
              ships can even be made to move as a timed
              event from the FidoNet software).  If you
              are interested in  obtaining  the  source
              for   the  C  version,  I  require  fifty
              dollars for it as a check  or  something.
              I   will  require  a  written  agreement,
              however, acknowledging copyright  holding
              if you want the source to the C version.

     Eventually, C Universal Mayhem will allow the running of and
     the  destruction  of other ships sitting in other universes.
     The way this is to work is through network mail.  A  captain

     on  Astro-Net  may  destroy  a  ship which is captained by a
     player on another node.  At night the data  differences  are
     transmitted  and  both  systems  are  updated to reflect the
     destruction.  This can, of course, be turned off to  seclude
     game play to one universe.

     - - -

     Universal Mayhem is, and as was intended, solely for the use
     of   FidoNet   people   for   the   propagation   of  honest
     bloodletting.  Beta testing has been underway for  the  last
     eight  months  and is available for evaluation at Astro-Net.
     This enables you, the SysOp and user alike, to run the  game
     before spending the time of downloading it.

              MENSA Echo Conference Grows Onto The Backbone
                       by George Falcon, 1:109/648
                    Moderator, MENSA Echo Conference

       For about six months now, I've been keeping the FidoNet
     community aware of the growth of the MENSA Echo Conference
     since I assumed responsibility for it back in February.  I've
     posted the list of systems carrying the conference in the hope
     that those of you interested in participating could find an easy
     link to the conference.
       An easy link is even easier now.  A few weeks ago the MENSA
     Echo Conference went onto the national "backbone" of echomail
     distribution.  At last count, there were 81 systems
     participating, far too many to list here.  The conference is NOT
     restricted to member sysops or users, but is completely open, and
     serves as an interface between the organization and the FidoNet
     community.

     What is MENSA?
          Mensa is an international organization with only one
     requirement for membership - a performance on a standardized
     I.Q. test (or certain alternative tests, such as the CEEB, SAT,
     GRE, LSAT, etc.) in the top 2% of the general population.

     MENSA membership
          American Mensa has over 53,000 members, and another
     15,000 members belong to national Mensas in many countries.
     There are Mensans in 98 countries throughout the world.

     MENSA's purposes
          1) to identify and foster human intelligence for the benefit
            of humanity
          2) to encourage research in the nature, characteristics, and
             uses of intelligence
          3) to provide a stimulating intellectual and social
     environment for its members

     "MENSA" defined
          Mensa is Latin for "table."  We are a round-table society
     that makes no distinctions as to race, color, creed, national
     origin, age, or eco-nomic, educational, or social status.  Only
     intelligence matters.

     MENSA organization
          American Mensa has about 130 Local Groups, located in all
     50 states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  Chances are
     there's a local group nearby.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin

                   Episode 7:  Getting Back Into FidoNet


          Hello, friends  of  old  and  new.    I'm  back.    I was on
     vacation for awhile (There are those who would say that I've been
     on vacation for a LONG while),  but  that doesn't account for the
     length of time I've been away.  My last column was, of course, in
     FidoNews 5-15, way back in  April.    Here I am, over four months
     later, trying to pick up where I  left off.  Well, I guess I have
     some explaining to do.

          I'm sorry for  abandoning  the  newsletter  when  I was just
     getting started on a regular  column;  I'm  sorry for the MASS of
     EchoMail I generated in  response  to  the  'Disincorporate IFNA'
     campaign; I'm sorry I allowed Node 128/31 to die this summer; and
     I'm sorry I can't  attend  FidoCon.    Most  of  all, I'm sorry I
     didn't get my ballots off in time; I have not contributed well to
     FidoNet this year.

          However, EagleTech BBS is up again, with me as its new SysOp
     and such, though at time  of  writing  I'm  still waiting on Node
     reassignment.

          Thank you, FidoNet SysOps,  for  the times past when I was a
     user; thanks again  for  the  short  time  I  was  a co-sysop and
     columnist for FidoNews; and  thanks  in advance for the fun times
     to come.

          Yes, FidoNet is fun; chatting  with the users, and our local
     GENERAL echo in town gets loads of users from time to time when a
     discussion gets underway about  copyright laws or the size of the
     sign outside of town;  and  direct  overnight communications with
     both old friends and new ones  found  here in FidoNet is always a
     treat.  (Hi Geof!  I should be back in the NodeList soon.)

          With the fun comes the  responsibility,  however, to run the
     node with  care;  respecting  other  SysOps'  needs  in  FidoNet;
     working out  tech  problems  with  them;  helping  new  users get
     'smart'  on  telecommunications  basics;  keeping  the  file  and
     message areas clean; and contributing wherever there is a lack of
     true communication in FidoNet.   I haven't gotten involved enough
     with FidoNet to say I've  been  a  help.  I guess it's time for a
     change.

          Well, I didn't vote, so whatever  happens this year, like it
     or not, I have to face up to the fact that I did nothing to avert

     it.  I guess the Net is in y'alls' hands, now. See ya' next week.

          Software Trade: International Medical Software Exchange

     As sysop of a PC-Pursuitable medically related BBS, I'm
     interested in exchanging public domain medical software with
     computer users throughout the U.S. and in other countries as
     well.  I currently have 5 meg of medically related software on-
     line and FREQ-able (contact me via netmail during NMH for my
     operating hours, which are variable).

     I'd be interested in trading software through U.S. mail with
     anyone who has interests similar to mine.  Please contact me via
     netmail to work out the logistics of such a trade.

     NOTICE: Region 18 has a NEW Region Echomail Coordinator.

             Jon Hall at 123/12 has taken over the duties of
             REC for Region 18. This change was not noted in
             this week's Nodelist due to late notice and the
             occurance of FidoCon V. The listing for 1/218
             is NOT correct since it reflects the information
             for the previous REC 18, Jerry Cole at 123/2.

             Please update your system accordingly. The change
     FidoNews 5-35                Page 10                  29 Aug 1988


             in 1/218 should be reflected in Nodelist.246.

             123/12 is set up will ALL of the Echo control
             files from 123/2. The Alternate Hubs in Region 18
             are unaffected as of this writing.

     Thank you.
