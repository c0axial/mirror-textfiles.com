     =================================================================

     Hey! What goes on here? I get back from a week in the Bahamas [my
     first real vacation in YEARS!] and find that some miscreant I never
     heard of has cracked my password files and perpetrated some kind of
     cruel hoax on the world of FidoNet. Can't a guy take a break once in
     awhile? [crikes]

     Anyhoo, reports of my demise are remarkably premature, to coin a
     phrase. [snicker]

     Not only am I not dead, but neither is my wife, my son, nor my dog.
     We are all just fine and the dog says, "Hello, FidoNet." [No, his
     name is Humbert, not Fido {sorry, Tom}.]

     So if you received one of these bogus copies purporting to be FidoNews
     number 1507, please dispose of it with an anti-virus utility at your
     earliest convenience. It is a phony put out by somebody I don't even
     know. This HERE, FidoNews, right here, is the one, the only and the
     original FidoNews 1507 - accept NO SUBSTITUTES!

     The preliminary BS aside, the ZEC1 Election ended this week. I hope
     everyone took the rare opportunity to take a Sysop-wide vote in a
     Zonal election. If you didn't, don't bellyache about the choice the
     ones who did put into office. As is well known, I don't believe in
     Echomail so I made no predictions or editorial preferences. I wonder
     who won?

     This isn't a very big Issue. Not too many folks complaining this
     week. There's another brouhaha over in Zone 2 reflected further down
     but unless there's something coming in late, it's routine.

     On another note, I am retiring as the Editor of FidoNews as of this
     edition. I'm getting pretty busy with various other activities that
     will be taking the needed time away from doing a decent job with this
     effort. I've enjoyed the job and hope you've enjoyed and been annoyed
     at the same time. A newspaper should have no friends as it sez in the
     Banner. [grin]

     To make sure this one has no friends, I am transferring the Editorship
     of FidoNews to Zorch Frezberg as suggested by the counterfeit 1507. I
     think that is darn good idea in a sick, twisted way. [snicker]

     I'll send him all he needs and you send him all he prints.

     I'll be shutting down my FidoNet ops in general, too, for awhile. So
     if anyone wants to get in touch with me, send to the dreaded Internet
     at:

       cbaker84@digital.net

     and i'll get back to you.

     Thanks, for everything.

     Censorship in European FidoNet
     by Wulf Krueger, 2:2437/209

     These are the facts: Ludwig Catta (from now on referred to as
     LC), an online user of several mailboxes in region 2:30
     (Switzerland) participated in a number of echomail areas. Due to
     several violations of the echo rules LC was disconnected from
     many of these echos. LC did not respect this but looked for and
     found new links and since he is an online user it was almost
     impossible to stop him - once disconnected he would simply log
     into another mailbox to continue.

     Therefor the coordinators of R2:30 decided that *all* echomail
     written *by* LC and *all* echomail addressed *to* him was to be
     deleted without any notice. Only *after* this was discovered
     RC2:30 and REC2:30 decided to make this publicly known - two
     weeks after the deletion had begun.

     Here is their "official" statement in full length (but slightly
     reformatted to be FidoNews-compliant):

     Betrifft: Ausschluss des Online-Users Ludwig Catta aus dem Fidonet
               Schweiz (nachfolgend als LC bezeichnet)

     Liebe Region 30 Nodes,

     Nachdem LC hier in der Schweiz mehrmals unangenehm aufgefallen ist,
     indem er in mehreren Echos die Schreibverbote der Moderatoren nicht
     beachtet hat und diese boeswillig durch Boxen-Wechsel umgangen hat,
     haben wir beschlossen, LC im Fidonet Schweiz als "unerwuenschte
     Person" zu bezeichnen.

     Die Gruende fuer diesen Entschluss:
     ----------------------------------
     - Die gesamte Schweiz wurde wegen LC beinahe von der PHOTO.GER
       abgehangt
     - LC ist aus Deutschland und schreibt in Schweizer-Boxen - warum???
     - LC hat immer mehrere Boxen wo der seine Mails absetzt um etwelchen
       Sanktionen der Moderatoren zu entkommen
     - LC hat die gleichen Probleme in vielen deutschen Mailboxen
     - LC ist und bleibt ein Unruhestifter wie wir ihn hier in der Schweiz
       seit 10 Jahren nicht hatten, und auch nicht wollen
     FIDONEWS 15-07               Page 4                   16 Feb 1998


     Die Konsequenz:
     --------------
     - Echomails von und an LC werden hier in der Schweiz nicht mehr
       transportiert
     - Netmails bleiben selbstverstaendlich unangetastet

     mit freundlichen Gruessen

     English translation:

     Concerning: Exclusion of the online-user Ludwig Catta from Fidonet
                 Switzerland (in the following abbreviated as LC)

     Dear Region30 Nodes

     After LC hs been disagreeable conspicuous cause he did not pay
     attention to the disallowance to write form the moderators of
     multiple echos and he malevolently went round all disconnections
     by changing the node, we decided to designate LC as "persona non
     grata" in Fidonet Switzerland (also known as region30).

     The reasons for this resolution:
     --------------------------------
     - Whole Switzerland has been nearly disconnected from PHOTO.GER
       because of LC
     - LC lives in Germany and he writes in Swiss BBS-systems, why?
     - LC is always present in multiple BBS-systems from where he writes
       to escape any sanctions from the moderators.
     - LC has the same problems in a lot of German BBS-systems as well.
     - LC is and stays a troublemaker like we did not have one since ten
       years in Switzerland, and we also not want to have.

     The consequence:
     ----------------
     - Echomail from an to LC will no longer transported here in
       Switzerland.
     - Netmail keeps, of coarse, untouched.

     With compliments

     These are the facts - but why exactly do I feel the urge to
     publish that? Simply because I am shocked at my *own* reaction.

     I always believed that censorship is one the worst threats to
     our community and tried to fight against it. And now when a
     person is concerned that I don't like and that I consider to be
     no major loss I gave up my principles and I supported this
     FIDONEWS 15-07               Page 5                   16 Feb 1998


     "automated censorship". Knowing what the consequences might be
     I agreed with censorship as a possibility to stop LC. This was
     only my first and very emotional reaction without really
     thinking about it but I am ashamed of myself to see how easily I
     accepted censorship.

     FidoNet has always been a melting pot of different believes,
     opinions and philosophies. Till now it has always been possible
     for everyone to speak out aloud what he or she thinks without
     having to fear personal consequences (provided that he or she
     did so with reasonable objectivity).

     If anyone violates our rules we have our policies which enable
     us to react to such misbehaviour. Censorship is definitely *not*
     the right way to deal with such problems if we want to remain a
     network of free speech, of personal freedom and rightfulness.

     If we accept censorship as a legal means to exclude someone from
     FidoNet this will be only the first step towards an
     authoritarian FidoNet with misuse of power and arbitraryness as
     the new rules.

     I was relieved to see that many my fellow sysops whole-heartedly
     *disagreed* with me when I was supporting automated censorship
     and I do strongly believe that most of us don't want such acts
     of arbitraryness in FidoNet.

     Don't make the mistake I made when I accepted censorship because
     the effect seemed to be satisfying - next time it might be you
     or me whose mail will be deleted. I ask you all to speak out
     against censorship in FidoNet, against arbitraryness and against
     that nightmare of a "Brave New" FidoNet.

     Thank you for calling Technical Support. All of our technicians are
     currently busy helping people even less competent than you, so please
     hold for the next available technician. The waiting time is now
     estimated at between fifteen minutes and eternity. In order to
     expedite your call, please punch your 63-digit product identification
     number onto your telephone touch pad, followed by your product serial
     number, which can be found in a secret compartment inside your
     computer where, for security purposes, it is printed in the smallest
     typeface known to mankind. Do that now.

     (Lengthy excerpt from Mahler's "Lugubrious" Symphony in C Minor)

     Thank you again for calling Technical Support. We recommend that you
     sit at your computer, preferably turning it on at some point, and have
     at hand all your floppy disks, CD-ROM disks, computer manuals and
     original packing materials in order to allow the technician to aid you
     in the unlikely event that he ever takes your call. It would also be
     helpful for you to refrain from sobbing while explaining your problem
     to the technician.  Shouting obscene threats will cause you to be
     immediately disconnected and blackballed from further communication
     with Technical Support, not only from ours but that of every other
     electronics-related firm in the industrialized world.

     (Medley of Hootie and the Blowfish hits rendered by the Mormon
     Tabernacle Choir)

     Thank you once again for calling Technical Support. In order to enable
     us to better assist you, it would be helpful to know more about you
     and your equipment. Have you called Technical Support before? If you
     have, please press the numeral "one" on your telephone touchpad. If
     not, press the numeral "two." If you are not sure, using the letters
     on your touchpad, spell out the phrase: "I am confused and despondent
     and quickly losing the will to live." Once you have finished, hang up
     your phone and make arrangements to sell your computer because by the
     time the technician takes your call, it will be obsolete, and you will
     be too senile to use it anyway.

     Thank you for calling Technical Support. Unfortunately, all of our
     technicians just went out for lunch. This means that to the estimated
     waiting time we gave you earlier, you may now add at least another two
     hours.

     (Wayne Newton singing "Danke Schoen" 1,743 times)

     Thank you for calling Technical Support. Before talking to the
     technician about your problem and risking the possibility that you may
     be wasting his valuable time, please ask yourself the following
     questions: If my monitor screen is dark, is it possible I have
     forgotten to plug in my computer or, alternately, that I have been
     suddenly struck blind? Have I exhausted every possible means of help
     before utilizing the sacred, last-resort-only telephone option? Have I
     sent a fax to Fast Fax Technical Support? Have I consulted my manual?
     Have I read the Read-Me notice on the floppy disk? Have I called up my
     know-it-all geek cousin who I can't stand but who can probably fix
     this thing for me in under five minutes? Have I given the central
     processing unit of my computer a good, solid whack? If you can not
     honestly answer "yes" to all these questions, please get off the line
     immediately so that our overworked technicians can help those truly
     desperate customers whose suffering is so much greater than yours.

     (Recording of Tibetan monks performing a six-day chant celebrating the
     reincarnation of one of their recently deceased colleagues into the

     Thank you for calling Technical Support. You may not be aware that
     this week we are featuring a discount on a number of popular CD-ROM
     titles you may wish to purchase, such as the best-selling Porn
     Doubler, which allows you to access erotic material from the Internet
     twice as fast. If you would like to hear all 26,000 titles read to
     you, shout "Yes! Yes!  Yes!" into the telephone now. This will not
     cause you to lose your place in line for Technical Support; in fact it
     may jump you ahead of several other callers.

     (Tape loop of background music from the soundtrack of Johnny Mnemonic

     Thank you for calling Technical Support. Our electronic sensors
     indicate that you are about to slump over and die from a massive
     frustration attack combined with severe dehydration from lack of food
     and water. Before doing so, please take a moment to place your
     telephone receiver back in its base and switch off your computer so as
     not to wear down its internal battery.  As a non-living person, you
     will have no further need of Technical Support and so we regretfully
     must remove you from our list of registered product users. Remember,
     we valued your patronage and were happy to serve your needs. Do not
     hesitate to have your heirs or beneficiaries contact us should any
     further technical problems arise.
