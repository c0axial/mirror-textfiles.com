Editorial: Playing catch-up

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Well, I really do intend to eventually write about the Computers,
Freedom and Privacy Conference I attended in March, where I got that
EFF Pioneer of the Telecommunication Frontier award.

However, I seem to do nothing with FidoNews except work to stand
still. Every week it's another fire to fight.

This week I have apologize to myself, or is that to "you", The Reader.
I, your esteemed (or is that humble I cannot remember) editor, grossly
overreacted to all the flame and noise I received regarding that
recent Issue That Will Remain Unnamed. (In my defense I'll simply say
the intensity at this end was unusual.)

A number of people wrote in to express dismay with my new reluctance
to air these sort of things in the future. I am glad to say I believe
I have come to my senses (if I ever had any is an open question) and I
will simply look at each individual piece far more carefully.

And as I had to point out to one careful reader, I was mainly
apologizing to one of the parties involved as to the lack of process,
rather than for content. That editorial was written in excessive
haste, and hence sloppily (unlike this gem hear XXX here.)

                        * * * * *

I also have a book or two to review, one of which is "The BMUG guide
to Bulletin Boards and beyond", by Bernard Aboba, which is far and
away the best specifically-BBS book I've seen yet. It convers how and
why of BBSing, with specific examples of BBS programs, excellent
descriptions of various networks, including FidoNet, even including
the social and political hows/whys. It's great! It's huge, 500+
full-size pages. Connector pinouts. Modem how-to's. Netiquette. File
transfer details, including dissimilar file system conversions.
Written by a sysop for sysops and users. Histories. Techie junk.
Friendly writing. Until I get around to the abstract, you can contact
BMUG at voice 510-549-2684, US Post 1442A Walnut St #62, Berkeley CA
94709, fax 510-849-9026.

Though I have only been in FidoNet for about 8 months, lately
I have noticed many sysops, not only in my area, replacing their
origin lines with "cutesy" sayings, instead of their board
identification. This, to me, is insensitive not only to the
sysops, but to the users.

I for one, when I look at a _Origin_ line in a message, look
there for one reason: to see where the message originated
from. Now I know that the address is always there, but I know
when *I* started BBSing I had know idea what "89:684/1" meant,
and I know that many of my users have no idea either.

I have seen many instances where users have replied to messages
that may have "local only" interest, and when they were
blasted to bits by the moderator, I looked back at the
original message, and no location was was indicated!

Yes, I know I have no right to tell you what to put in your
origin line, but lets have some common courtesy here! If you
want to put little sayings in your messages use an Offline
Reader like SLMR, or use a Editor with a Random Cookie
feature, but I think the name and city SHOULD be indicated in
the Origin lines... isn't that the point of them?


Heh... I'll shut up now... have a nice day from Victoria BC :)

Controlling Illegal Use of Your Phone Card
By Brian Murrey - KB9BVN
1:231/30

We have had some problems at my place of employment with our traveling
folks getting their phone card numbers lifted.  Well, not actually
lifted, let's just call it "published".  From the details that I have,
one of the victims was making a phone call from a payphone in a busy
airport.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  After he made the phone call,
AT&T security called the keeper of the phones to let us know that 20
phone calls had been charged to it within a one hour period and were
we aware of this.

Well, we weren't.  The victim couldn't remember anything different
about this phone call and couldn't figure out how someone got the
number at all.

It seems that while the victim was making the phone call, a couple of
"kids" looking like they were about to board a plane were shooting
some video around the phone area.  Well guess what.  It seems that the
boys had been taping card numbers all morning all courtesy of the most
excellent zoom lens that can be found on most over the counter
camcorders.

I wish I had more details than that, but this event got me to
thinking.  As a Amateur Radio Operator, I spend a fair amount of time
monitoring (listening) to the shortwave bands.  When I get real board
and need some kicks I tune in the ship to shore frequencies and listen
to people say things like "I miss you", "I love you", "I'm real
drunk." etc etc...but they also say things like..."My calling card
number is......" and I'll bet that while they're way out in the
Gulf enjoying themselves, they don't even know that the whole world
may be listening in.

What's my point?  Well, don't let your phone card out of your sight,
don't read the number off over a radiophone, don't read it off over
cellular phone (Cellular phone is probably the MOST heavily monitored
frequency band in North America), and don't let anyone borrow it even
for a minute.

Oh, BTW, if you are a SWL and are interested in Pirate Radio, then you
need to connect yourself the the FREE_RADIO echo.  You can connect in
at any of the following locations.

231/30, 124/7009, 1/211, or 11/1

FREE_RADIO is for the discussion of pirate transmissions, trading of
QSL information, and it helps to verify what you heard.  Stay tuned to
7415 Khz for all the pirate action. (Well most of it anyway)

                            SEAmail version 1.10
                                 Revision F


Revision F to SEAmail version 1.10 has been released, and incorporates the
following changes:

  * Phone book editing is now more understandable, and includes the ability
    to create and edit mailing lists from phone book entries on the fly.

  * DIAL was not properly invoking the script driver, with the result that
    scripts generally didn't work with DIAL.  This has now been fixed.

  * The OS/2 version of DIAL had some problems with keyboard queueing that
    have now been fixed.

  * KITTEN now handles marking download lists differently if the caller is
    in ANSI mode.  The result should be more pleasing and much easier to
    use.

  * CFGEDIT now allows you to describe your modems in your own words.

  * You can now define a dialup password for use with an address.  The
    dialup password replaces any occurrence of "*P" in DIAL macros.

  * RENUMBER and the GRP* programs can now be told to operate on all
    folders in a given sort block.  For example, a command line reference
    to "BLOCK X" would refer to all folders in sort block "X".

  * KITTEN has a new review function, <T>urkey.  This marks a caller as
    having been reviewed and set the "turkey flag".  When a caller who has
    the turkey flag set calls in, he is sent to a TURKEY.CAT menu instead
    of the CONTROL.CAT menu.  The turkey flag is reset by the <R>eviewed
    command.

  * Some inconsistencies in the use of file date/time stamps have been
    resolved.

  * Some inconsistencies in the use of record locking have been resolved,
    which should lead to better performance on multiline systems.

  * CFGEDIT will now check to see if a new password entry duplicates an
    existing entry, and will merge the entries if so.

  * When configuring a modem, the "Null modem" and "PAD" choices have been
FidoNews 9-18                  Page 5                       4 May 1992


    combined into a single rotary "Modem type".  Likewise, maximum baud
    rate is now a rotary selection.

  * A bug in Caller*ID support in the OS/2 versions has been detected and
    corrected.

  * A new configuration file, EXCLUDE.CFG, has been defined.  It has the
    same format as IGNORE.CFG, but is used to identify phone numbers (such
    as PC Pursuit outdial lines) that cannot be used to identify a caller.
    When calls are received from phone numbers listed in the exclusion
    file, the system will act as if no Caller*ID information had been
    received.

  * Due to how some OS/2 device drivers handle a comm port, there could be
    problems with using a null modem connection.  This has now been fixed.

  * KITTEN now recognizes another special menu, ONESHOT.CAT, which she will
    call once and only once at the start of every session just before
    calling the CONTROL.CAT menu.  The ONESHOT.CAT menu should exit by
    performing a RETURN command.

  * GET, SEND, REQ, and TELL now have a "hold" option to indicate that the
    created message(s) should be held for pickup.  This allows GET and SEND
    to be used with addresses that do not have a published phone number.

  * PACKER should now recover better from having a previous run aborted.

  * GRPIN will now notify a LAN mail server when it generates a pong
    message.

  * There is now a WAZOOZ netmail session handler for OS/2.

  * MAIL2TXT was not correctly translating Caller*ID ports higher than
    COM4.  It is now.

  * NLCOMP was not properly scanning nodelist lines with leading spaces in
    front of a prefix (Zone, Host, et cetera).  This has now been fixed.

  * Many of the documentation files have been updated and improved.


Those with SEAmail 1.10 revision E for MS-DOS can upgrade to revision F by
going to their SEAmail directory and giving the command:

    upgrade sm110f

Those with the OS/2 version should give the command:

    upgrade sm110fp

POST_POLIO ECHO NOW AVAILABLE ON BACKBONE...

During the 1940's and 1950's, hundreds of thousands (and perhaps more)
were struck down with Infantile Paralysis (AKA Polyiomyelitis) during
the widespread epidemics of those years..  Many, like myself, managed
to survive the epidemics with little to show for the ordeal but a
slight limp and some residual weaknesses. Now, almost 45 years after
my successful(?) bout with polio, I am finding my old Polio Symptoms
are returning with a vengance!! AND, I am not alone.. An overwhelming
number of other Polio Survivors have seen, or are in the process of
seeing, their crippling symptoms returning. It is these people, or
more importantly, those who DON'T know what is happening to them,
that we are striving to reach. Post-Polio Syndrome (sequalae) is a
very little-known condition in a medical profession that were taught
that polio was a "Cured" disease.. Diagnosis is difficult, and the
symptoms are frequently attributed to normal Aging or other reasons.

The reverse mis-diagnosis problem is a reality as well.. I attributed
my weaknesses climbing Stairs and walking to PPS.. I almost made a
deadly mistake.. Although my family Dr. did not think I had anything
more serious than overweight and PPS, I searched out a Cardioligist,
underwent a few tests, and ended up with a Quadruple Bypass 3/30/92!!

The Message for Polio Survivors around the World is that this can be
a two-edged Sword: Those who don't know why they are experiencing the
same Polio-like difficulties 35-45 years later NEED to know what is
happening to them.. Those who MAY have PPS, or suspect they do, need
to be aware that it can mask more serious problems, as was my case..

The POST_POLIO Echo has been serving as a medium of communication
between Polio-Survivors and interested parties on ADAnet(tm) for
over 6 months. There have been instances where the Echo may have
saved a life, or at least made substantial contributions to the
quality of life for some.. That is why I have decided to expand
POST_POLIO's scope of availability - The urgency of the message is
obvious.. The subject is timely..

I wish to publicly thank Bill Freeman and the many ADAnet(tm) Folks
for getting POST_POLIO it's initial exposure.. However, I now ask
the FIDONET folks who carry any Medical/Handicapped Echoes to now
consider adding POST_POLIO to their BBS.. The time is ripe...

The POST_POLIO Rules are attached for your Information.

                    ----------------------------------------


FYI: First cut of POST_POLIO CONFERENCE Rules..

FidoNews 9-18                  Page 7                       4 May 1992


Conference Rules are reasonably simple..

PURPOSE: To provide a medium for interactive discussion and
         Information-sharing between past Polio (Infantile
         Paralysis) victims; present Post Polio Sequalae (PPS)
         sufferers; Potential Post-Polio candidates (Those who
         suffered Polio in the 40's and 50's, or at other times);
         Medical Professionals, and ANY other interested parties..

DECORUM: Courtesy and Consideration of others are to be the dominant
         Modes on this Echo. No Flames or griping about Hospitals,
         unprofessional "Professionals", or fellow Echo Members, OK?
         No Profanity or offensive language/subject material either!

SUBJECTS: No limitations except the above..

GENERAL: Feel free to use this Forum to exchange info and names of
         Therapists, Neurologists, Orthopedic personnel, or others
         familiar with Post-Polio Sequalae (Syndrome); to search for
         others associated with Post-Polio in your area; for our
         mutual Support and encouragement, and whatever is needed..
         We DO ask, however, that the echo NOT be used to advertise
         non-approved Medical Equipment nor any Human-Consumables...

We are building a database, which will be accessible on-line here at
SPACECON BBS, of Doctors/Therapists/Neurologists/Etc. who are familiar
with the Post-Polio problems.. We realize that there are all too few
Medical Professionals familiar with Post-Polio, and we are working, at
least locally, to rectify this problem. We solicit your help, and will
appreciate any inputs for the database. Take care, and welcome aboard!

Rights On! 1:374/14

                      A_THEIST Echo Available

A_theism means free of religion in the way a_political means
free of politics or a_sexual means free of sex
characteristics or drives.

With that in mind and ever cognizant of the continued
pressure of religion to intrude itself into our government
and its operations, the A_THEIST Echo is provided to inform
and alarm and hopefully wake up the sleeping and too long
silent majority to the peril on our doorstep.

It is now a Zone 1 Backbone Echo Hosted and Moderated
by Rights On! [1:374/14] and Christopher Baker [card
carrying member of American Atheists, Inc.]. Initial links
may be obtained from your local Backbone source connection.
Zone 3 is being fed through 3:681/857 and Zone 2 through
2:243/11 via a Gate at 1:374/14 until direct links can be
made to those Zones via the international Backbone links.

The Echo is open to anyone who can discuss, without
proselytizing, the extreme desirability of maintaining the
absolute separation of State and church in this country as
provided for in our Constitution.

A sample of the first few messages and the statement of
purpose of the Echo is available as A_THEIST.ZIP from this
system anytime except 0100-0130 ET and Zone 1 ZMH [USR HST
V32 online] if you wish to get an idea of whether to commit
disk space to the Echo. An archive of the past traffic from
the Echo is also available as A_ECHO1.ZIP, A_ECHO2.ZIP, and
A_ECHO3.ZIP, A_ECHO4.ZIP, etc.

It has been on the Backbone for months. Ask your Backbone
connection to get it for you! The complete info is available
in the current ELISTnnn.XXX file available from your NEC or
REC or here. [Request ELIST.]

I hope you will join us or ask your Sysop to request a link
via their regular Backbone connections!

TTFN.
Chris

             SKEPTIC Echo is alive and well!

SKEPTIC is now a Backbone Echo that originally sprang forth
from the San Francisco area. It now originates from Zone 3
in Adelaide, Australia under the Moderatorship of Jackson
Harding at 3:681/857 and is Hubbed into Zones 1 and 2 by
1:374/14.

If any of you or your Sysops are interested in obtaining
this Echo, you or they should contact their regular,
Backbone Echo source! SKEPTIC now appears in FIDONET.NA as
of 2 May 92.

SKEPTIC is devoted to examination and report of paranormal
and fringe-science claims. It has NO official or unofficial
connection to CSICOP {Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal} but has a similar
philosophy. Claims are not rejected on a priori grounds but
rather are investigated by objective and critical inquiry.

The Echo is now fully activated and waiting for those with
an interest in the mission stated above.

Complete information about the Echo may be found in the
current issue of the EList and the ELRules files.

Come and join us in the pursuit of knowledge! [grin]

TTFN.

      Due to the emergence of TriBBS (formerly known as TriTel) as a
premiere BBS program, we have started a FidoNet echo called (what else)
"TRIBBS" in an attempt to be able to offer technical and moral support to
anyone either using or intending to use this fine program.


      I am the moderator, and can be reached at 1:140/12 and the author,
Mark Goodwin, who can be reached at 1:328/104 are active participants, and
so far the echo has spread as far as a node in Africa as well as
throughout Canada and the USA.  We are attempting to get it placed on the
backbone, and by the time you read this, it very well may be there.  We
are both ready and willing to offer any and all support needed by any
TriBBS Sysop.

FidoNews 9-18                  Page 11                      4 May 1992


      Until "TRIBBS" is available on the backbone, it may be received from
either 1:140/12 by a simple netmail request.  Get your NEC to request it
from the backbone, and if it's not there yet, please do not hesitate to
contact myself to arrange delivery.

      We anticipate that this echo will grow as more sysops realize the
advantages and flexibility of the TriBBS software package, plus the
numerous support utilities.

(COMMO) Echo
by Tim Spofford 105/99.0

{Commo} - yes, the curly brackets are program's name - is a small
(around 35k), DV-aware, comms program, written by Fred Brucker, now
in its fourth year of development and distribution. It uses external
file transfer protocols (e.g., DSZ) and runs in a 120 Kb window.  It
is unique, though, because of its extensive use of a powerful macro
language to perform practically any function one could want or need.
In Northern California (where Fred lives) and a few other pockets
around the country, many sysops have been using it for their own
comms for several years now.

The {COMMO} echo - the area tag DOES include the curly brackets -
is, not surprisingly, for {Commo} users and is a forum for
additional development ideas and brainstorming and for the exchange
of macros to perform new and novel functions.  Fred Brucker is a
regular participant.

Backbone status is being sought.  In the meantime, feeds for the
echo can be gotten here, 105/99, at HST & v.32 speeds, or at
125/180, at HST and v.32bis speeds.  The current version of {Commo}
can be file requested (no restrictions) from 105/99 as COMMO5?.ZIP
or with the magicname COMMO (165K).
