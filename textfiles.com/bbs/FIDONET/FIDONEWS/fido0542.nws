          Well here it is the first week of October,  1988.  An I only
     received  two  replies to the SysOp interviews submitted  in  the
     Opus  Gazette  and Fido News.   Don't know if it is me or if  you
     folks  out there are not reading these two fine  newsletters.   I
     felt  kind  of  bad when I picked up this  months  Opus  Gazette.
     There were no articles in it, except the one from the Editor.  So
     here is what I reside to to.   Effective with next months Issue I
     plan on having at least one article in each of the Issues of  the
     OGZT.   Or  until  you folks out there protest enough to make  me
     quit.

          I  have been hearing all the reports about 1.1,  well  I  am
     running  1.03b,  and  do not at this time relish the  thought  of
     having to change over to 1.1.   So to the developers,  here is at
     least  one SysOp who Thanks you for taking your time and  getting
     things  right.   There  are those of us out here who do not  have
     major problems with the OPUS BBS system,  and as I said many many
     Moons ago.  Thanks Wynn!

          I  did  do  a NO NO a couple  of  weeks  ago.   I  installed
     ConfMail  to run in conjunction with the OPUS.   Not because I am
     dissatisfied  with PUREly OPUS,  but because I wanted to see  how
     hard  it would be to install,  and I can tell all of  you  PUREly
     OPus  Sysop.   If I can install ConfMail and have it run with  No
     problems  so far so can the rest of you.   An all this talk about
     why the backbones are doing certain things kind of reminds me  of
     the  months  prior to the AlterNet institution.   Sure there  are
     enough of US Opus BBS to start our OWN Net, but do we really want
     to do that?

          Do  we  want to cut our own throats?   Many of  us  seem  to
     forget  some of us do this for the FUN of it,  and YES this is an
     expensive hobby, and will get more expensive as it goes on.  That
     is why I say all of us should work at making the cost cheaper, vs
     complaining about having rules enforced upon us.   At least we do
     not  have to have a License to operate these things as some  have
     mentioned  in the past.   An I for one am grateful to  the  phone
     company for not making policy with which I could surely not live.

          This  News Letter,  has done it's thing once.   I for one do
     not want to see it happen again.   I do get busy as many of us do
     with other things in my life.   But this hobby of mine takes up a
     good  bit  of it,  and right now is averaging over  $100.00  each
     month.   Of  course the wife no longer complains about the  phone
     bill  when  I throw her cigarette bill and books into  the  pile.
     Anyway,  it  is just a Hobby or that is what I keep  saying.   It
     just has not turned out to be as enjoyable as it use to  be.   So

     if  I do my little part in keeping the OPUS Gazette alive then  I
     guess  I will be able to say I accomplished something this month.
     What can you say you have done?

     An Open Letter To SEA
     =====================

     Joe Lindstrom
     Farpoint Station (1:134/9999)
     Calgary, AB, Canada (403)-248-9999

          I've kinda sat back and washed all the stuff hit the fan (in
     EchoMail  in regards to the SEA vs PKware controversy.  Issue 540
     of FidoNews was, thankfully, a breath of fresh air.  Now  that  I
     know  some  facts,  I'm  willing  to "take sides", but with a few
     reservations.

          I use both ARC and PKPAK/UNPAK here  on  my  system.   After
     reading  your  article in Issue 540, I'm leaning towards favoring
     ARC though.  You stated the facts, and you promised that ARC  may
     be  used  without  charge (though a contribution will be nice) by
     non-commercial users now and in  the  future.   I'm  sure  you'll
     remain  true  to  your  word  on  this.  However... the PKPAK and
     PKUNPAK programs are FASTER, compress BETTER,  and  support  some
     features (like archive comments) that ARC does not.

          I  will continue to use PKPAK and PKUNPAK for now on my BBS,
     though I do use ARC for EchoMail  for  compatibility  sake.   And
     therein  lies the rub: here we have ARC, the "industry standard",
     which appears to me and to most others to be an inferior  product
     (as it relates to PK only, because ARC is really a very wonderful
     product).   After  January  1st,  we'll  be back to ONE choice of
     archiver.

          I have  so  far  resisted  the  temptation  to  send  you  a
     contribution  to  ARC.   Reason:  I have only recently joined the
     MS-DOS world.  I used to run a C-128  based  bulletin  board.   I
     bought  my  XT  compatible  and  jumped  in  right in the heat of
     battle.  There were TWO well-known and  well-supporter  archivers
     and  I  was  having to make a difficult choice.  I instead took a
     wait-and-see attitude, and I have now seen.

          I will send my contribution when a couple of things  happen.
     First  of all, I would like to see ARC perform FASTER.  I realize
     that's gonna be a little difficult, especially when it comes time
     to upgrade ALL versions of ARC for different  computers  (machine
     codes of course differ machine to machine), but it most certainly
     can be done.  Secondly, it must support newer, better compression
     methods  (such  as  SQUASH).  Third, it should have all the bells
     and whistles that PK had (file and archive comments,  etc.),  and
     hopefully a few new ones you can dream up.

          This  is  asking  a lot of you.  After all, you came up with
     the first ARChiver, and you have already given a lot to us.   But
     like  you pointed out, people have formed biased opinions AGAINST
     you.  To win  the  support  back,  and  to  truly  solidify  your
     self-proclaimed  position  as  "the  industry standard", you must
     continue to  be  competitive.   The  above  steps  are  just  the
     beginning in an endless dogfight to stay at the top.

          Thank  you  for  an  informative  explanation  of the events
     leading up to and after the suit.  Thank  you  for  an  excellent
     utility  that  has  saved  millions  of users everywhere a lot of
     time, money, and storage space.  And thank you for ARC 6.00 which
     I know will come as a direct result of this message <grin>!

          By the  way,  there  is  now  a  third-party  ARC-compatible
     archiver/dissolver available for the Commodore 128, which any 128
     owners  (or the folks at SEA) may want to check out.  It comes in
     a package called  "CS-DOS"  (written  by  Chris  Smeets)  and  is
     available for $30 from:

        MORE STORAGE ON YOUR DISK DRIVE
     By Gene Coppola

     Everyone wants to be able to store more files on their disk
     drives whether the drive is a floppy or hard disk drive. There
     are several ways to obtain more storage, some using hardware
     methods and some using software.

     This article will cover several of the software methods available
     to you at little or no cost. The two programs covered are ARC
     produced by SYSTEM ENHANCEMENT ASSOCIATES located in Wayne, New
     Jersey and PKARC produced by PKWARE located in Glendale,
     Wisconsin.

     Both programs have been released as Shareware software. The
     authors expect that you will pay a license fee if you continue
     to use the software after a reasonable trial period.

      The two programs take one or more files and produce one smaller
     file. In some cases, the size of the resulting compressed file
     can be drastically reduced in size. The compression routines
     used in each program vary. The speed and resulting compressed
     file size are determined by the compression method used by each
     author.

      ARC was released before PKARC but the latter is a definite
     improvement in speed over ARC. The author of ARC releases the
     source with ARC in case you desire to examine how the software
     works. PKARC will read and operate on files produced by PKARC or
     ARC. ARC will only operate on files it produces. Both software
     packages have very good documentation and the command menus for
     both programs can be seen by typing the program name at the DOS
     prompt.

     The results reported in this article were produced on a QT/2
     which is an 80386 based 20 Mhz PS/2 compatible computer with 12
     megabytes of RAM. A one megabyte RAM disk was created and all
     operations were then performed in the RAM disk. I ran the tests
     in the RAM disk to produce my results without the disk lag
     associated with floppy or hard disk drives. The times reported
     are the average of ten runs for each test reported. MS-DOS 3.2
     was the operating system in use during the tests. The QT/2
     memory speed is a quick 80ns.

     I tested a variety of different file types and combinations of
     files to see how each program handles different files. PKARC and
     ARC were used for compression, PKXARC and ARCE for decompression.

     CUBIT from Softlogic is also available and from past tests the
     results have been poor. I could not include results from CUBIT
     because the version of CUBIT I own will not run on my system and
     Softlogic has refused to provide me with an updated version of
     CUBIT that will run on an 80386 based system unless I purchase
     the updated version. CUBIT is a Terminate And Stay Resident
     program and takes user memory once loaded. The files it produces
     are not compatible with ARC or PKARC software. It is also more

     Percentage               99                     100

     As you can see from the above chart, PKARC is consistently faster
     than ARC when compressing a file.  PKXARC is also faster than
     ARCE when decompressing a file.

     The average reduction in file size for the five tests is 48% for
     PKARC and 43% for ARC. While the difference of 5% does not seem
     like much, it does add up. The capacity of my hard drive is 110
     megabytes. So the five percent advantage of using PKARC allows
     me to store 5.5 megabytes more on my drive than if I used ARC to
     compress my files.

     The speed advantage of PKARC is the main factor however in my
     choice between the two packages. However the author of PKARC
     includes one more feature that I really like. You can create
     self-extracting files with PKARC.  This is great for people who
     write software and wish to distribute it in this manner. Both
     PKARC and ARC come from the authors in a self-extracting archive
     file.

     The versions of the software tested are the latest available at
     the time this article was written. I used version 5.21 of ARC
     and version 3.6 of PKARC which was released a few days ago and
     contains major improvements over previous versions.

      1.  PKARC is now up to 25% faster. PKXARC is now up to
          10% faster

      2.  You can add 3,095 files to an archive in one sweep.

      3.  Special limited-disk-size handling to enable the update of
          archive files which are larger than 50% of your floppy disk
          storage area.

      4.  Added flexibility to the MOVE option by combining it with
          other update and freshen options.

      5.  A List Files feature has been added to further automate
          the archiving & file reconstruction process.

      6.  Your choice of having PKARC stop when it encounters a "can't
          find" file situation, or having it make a notation on the
          screen and then proceeding to the next step.

      7.  Improved network support.

      8.  The addition of the MORE command for the PKARC verbose file
     FidoNews 5-42                Page 8                   17 Oct 1988


          listing which provides pausing after each screen of
          information.

      9.  The addition of the MORE command for PKXARC which provides
          pausing after each screen of information during the
          "extract file to the screen" process.

     10.  New printer options for PKXARC.

     11.  A new  -n  option which saves time by reconstructing only
          the most recent version of the file to be extracted when
          another same-named file already resides on your disk.

     12.  Additional information about the archiving process is
          displayed which includes the version number and program.

          Here is a small dictionary of file compression terms to help
         explain some of the features of these software packages.

          FILE COMPRESSION is the process of reducing a file's size.
     Sometimes called ARCing or compressing.

          FILE means the SINGLE name that identifies information on
     your floppy disk or hard drive.

          ARCHIVE FILE holds information that has been reduced in
     size for better storage.  Sometimes called an ARC or ARCed file.

          An ARCHIVE FILE can be made up of either one big file OR
     several files bunched together under one file name.

          PKARC is upwardly compatible with all its own upgrades as
     well as with most other file compression programs. You can UNarc
     almost all of the archive files that have been created.

     There may be times when you need to CREATE an archive that is
     compatible to one which can be read by SEA's ARChiving program.
     This means you will use less features to maintain compatibility.

     C:>PKARC  otc   a   OldFile.ARC   *.*
               ___
                |
                This option, which IMMEDIATELY follows the program
                name, will create an archive file that is compatible
                with SEA's ARC.

             Building the New Ark -- An Immodest Proposal

     "The land is being overtaken by the SEA and the cities are going
     to the dogs, or perhaps the KATZ" -- attributed to Nostradomus
     and Yogi Berra

     Pardon my purple prose, but I'm tired of all the bickering.  It
     seems that one of the few things in FidoNet and the computer
     hobby in general which is not getting smaller and faster is
     debate.  In the past few weeks I have read messages, had files
     uploaded and seen FidoNews articles wailing about this or that
     side of the PKWARE vs SEA suit.  I have come to a conclusion on
     the matter, which I quote from an old t-shirt:  "Kill 'em all;
     let God sort them out."

     From the SEA side, I can understand the feeling.  We have heard
     all about the "family business", the piracy and the refusal by
     Phil Katz to respond to simple requests.  If Katz DID steal the
     code from SEA, and then resell an enhanced version, then he
     probably should be drawn and quartered and THEN sued.

     I also understand the PKWARE side of the dilemma, with which
     most average hobbyists sympathize.  If SEA had done what Katz
     did, writing a significantly better file compression system,
     then the whole problem would never have been started.

     I would propose dumping both of these systems and coming up with
     the .ARK file.  The .ARK file would employ the various
     file compression methods which the .ARC file employs (and which,
     if I am not mistaken, SEA did NOT originate).  It would not be
     compatible with the .ARC file, so that the .ARK author would not
     be sued for conspiracy to commit efficiency.  .ARK will be
     considerably faster than PKARC, ARC, et al.  In other words, it
     and it's author will bury everybody else and remain militantly
     FREE for the asking!

     Lest anyone think that the term .ARK is simply a knock-off of
     .ARC, it must be noted that .ARK refers to the Noah's Ark.  What
     more appropriate term could we find for something that would
     house all of our miscellaneous files and carry them safely over
     the sea (with all those catz -- er, cats -- swimming around)?

     Am I serious?  No.  I certainly wouldn't trust a file
     compression program that I wrote.  I do trust both the SEA and
     the PKWARE people!  No one is served best when a superior
     program is barred from the market.  The primary reason for the
     dynamic growth of the IBM compatible computer world is the
     openness adopted by IBM from the outset.  While Apple and others
     twiddled about with proprietary secrets and closed
     architectures, IBM opened the books completely, and while they
     lost some potential profits as a result, they have gained
     immensely more through their openness.  If stuffy Big Blue can
     be this open, why do shareware authors have to fight like cats

     and (SEA)dogs?

     (The author apologizes for the pun-ishment above.  There I go
     again!)

     A CONSULTANTS VIEW

     Currently the best performance v.s price ratio is obtained
     with the SUNTAC 80286 motherboard. This board operates at 4
     speeds the lowest being 6 Mhz and the highest speed being
     15 Mhz.

     Four megabytes of RAM may be installed on the motherboard using
     either 256k 100 n.s. chips or 1 megabit 100 n.s. chips. Memory
     above 1024k (1 megabyte) is available as L.I.M. 4.0 memory.

     The SUNTAC motherboard has two eight bit expansion slots and six
     sixteen bit expansion slots. The board will operate either as a
     one wait state system with 120 n.s. memory chips or a zero wait
     state system with 100 n.s. memory chips installed. A
     clock-calendar is installed on the board.

     This board is compatible with PC-DOS, MS-DOS and OS/2. When using
     PC-DOS you must use GWBASIC instead of IBM's BASICA due to
     copyright restrictions.

     The price of expansion memory chips is very high and no relief is
     in sight in the near future. However the prices of the various
     speeds of 256k memory chips are very close. To avoid having to
     purchase memory in the future if systems are upgraded it is
     suggested you obtain RAM chips with a minimum speed of 120 n.s.
     at this time.

     Once your system requires more memory the suggested option to
     purchase would be an AST Rampage board. This board will serve you
     very well in several ways.

     1) Allows you to use Rampage memory as system memory.
        You can backfill from 64k up with a Rampage board.

     2) Allows you to expand your system with up to two
        megabytes of E.E.M.S. memory which can be used by
        many programs such as Lotus, dBase, Turbo Pascal,
        SAS, word processors and network software.

     3) Many multi-user programs such as Desqview, Windows
        and Concurrent Dos recommend and run much better on
        a Rampage board than any other board including
        Intel's Aboveboard.

     With the advent of the SUNTAC 80286 based motherboard I do not
     recommend the purchase of a Turbo Speed Up board at this time.
     The 80286 based motherboard can be purchased at a price equal to
     and in some cases (Orchid Technology) at a much lower price than
     a Turbo board. Some of the reasons for this decision are
     explained below.

     1) Turbo Speed Up boards do not in most cases increase
        the data transfer rate between disk drives and the
        processor. The SUNTAC motherboard uses a 16 bit bus
        allowing much faster transfer rates.
     FidoNews 5-42                Page 14                  17 Oct 1988


     2) A Turbo card will not increase the transfer rate of
        either the serial or parallel ports. Again an 80286
        based motherboard can make use of the 16 bit bus
        which increases transfer rates.

     3) OS/2 runs on only one of all the available Turbo
        cards currently available. While OS/2 is not
        currently in major use I feel it will be within your
        expected equipment life.

     4) Turbo boards create many problems due to the heat
        generated by the high speed processor and memory on
        the Turbo board.

     5) Some EGA and many VGA display cards will not work
        when Turbo boards have been installed.

     Many of the computers I see still have the old 65 watt power
     supply installed. For a PC with just two floppy drives, one
     display card, and a printer card this is reasonable.

     You must understand that once a system starts to expand with
     hard drives, emulator boards and such, the power requirements
     and cooling requirements increase very dramatically. More
     problems are caused by the lack of proper cooling than any
     other reason.

     For a PC or XT I recommend a minimum of a 150 watt switching
     power supply. For those of you with AT's I suggest a minimum
     of 200 watts. Be sure than any power supply you purchase is
     U.L. listed and approved.

     For special situations there are Turbo Fans which increase the
     cooling by a factor from 120% to 400% over standard power
     supply/fan combinations.

      I recommend either a Seagate 30 megabyte or Seagate 40 megabyte
     hard drive. The 30 Mb would be for PC or XT systems and the 40 Mb
     would be for AT systems. Both are self parking and have proved to
     be very reliable in continued use.

     Until PC-DOS 4.0 is bug free I recommend that PC-DOS 3.3 be used
     on all systems. PC-DOS 3.3 is very stable at this point and
     provides many features not available in previous DOS versions.

     1) Increased environment and shell functions.

     2) Decreased minimum file size. Previous versions of
        DOS have a much larger block size when files are
        saved.

     3) Built in disk cache (type) functions.

     4) Increased speed for hard drive data transfer rates.

     5) Most network software will no longer work with 2.x
     FidoNews 5-42                Page 15                  17 Oct 1988


        versions of PC-DOS. Many new and improved network
        compatible functions have been included in PC-DOS
        3.3 thus making it far superior to prior versions.

     OS/2 has it's own place. However since a minimum of three to
     four megabytes of memory and an 80286 based system is required
     for OS/2 to be of any improvement over PC-DOS 3.3 I recommend
     staying with DOS 3.3 for the time being.

     When considering whether to invest in a network there are many
     factors that must be considered before any purchases are made.
     Here are a few of the many questions you must have answers for
     before you make any purchases.

     1) How many people will currently be accessing the
        network? What are the current minimum and maximum
        numbers?

     2) How many people will be accessing the network within
        the next twelve to eighteen months? What are the
        minimum and maximum numbers for this period of time?

     3) Will electronic mail between users be required
        initially once the network is set up? If not, will
        it be required in the future?

     4) What type of software will you be loading into and
        using on the network. Will the software be stored on
        a server or will each work station have its own
        software?

     5) Are the versions of currently owned software network
        compatible? If not, how much will it cost to upgrade
        to versions that are compatible?

     6) Will you purchase a network site license or
        individual network licenses for your software?

     7) Who will install and service the network and all
        associated hardware and software?

     8) Is someone available who can take day to day
        responsibility for maintaining the network and
        performing daily software backups?

     9) Can I afford the costs involved with obtaining the
        hardware and software for a network and the
        operating costs?

     The most important question has been reserved until last. Do you
     really need a network, or can you make better use of the
     resources currently available?

                DOS and Don'ts: A Word Usage Complaint

     This is something I felt I had to get off my chest after
     reading Brian J. Murrey's piece in FidoNews 539.

     He refers in that piece to "a DOS machine" as a synonym, I
     would presume, for "machine capable of running MS-DOS," or
     "IBM PC compatible."

     While this usage of the term "DOS" is currently fashionable,
     I must nevertheless register my opposition.

     "DOS" is a generic acronym for Disk Operating System, and as
     such refers to a number of such systems.  Apple had DOS 3.2
     and DOS 3.3 for their Apple II line, before releasing ProDOS
     as their new standard.  Disk units for the Commodore 64 come
     with routines in their ROM that are referred to in the
     manuals as "DOS."  The Atari 800's operating system was
     loaded from the system master disk by typing the command
     "DOS."  The Amiga has AmigaDOS.  Many such DOSes were
     already in existence when Microsoft released PC-DOS and its
     nearly-identical twin, MS-DOS.

     Hence, it's incorrect and ambiguous to use the term "DOS" to
     refer to MS-DOS exclusively, except in clearly machine-
     specific contexts.   Here are a few examples of what I mean.

     INCORRECT USAGES: (based on actual examples I've
     encountered in computer magazines, catalogs, and overheard
     conversations among computer people)

     "Different operating systems can have confusing differences.
     For instance, UNIX uses forward slashes to designate
     subdirectories, while DOS uses backward slashes."
     (Wrong:  MS-DOS and PC-DOS use backward slashes; some other
     DOSes, like Apple ProDOS, follow UNIX usage!)

     "Pages 1-5 of this catalog cover Mac software, and pages 6-
     14 cover DOS software."
     (Atari DOS or AmigaDOS?  Actually, the only "DOS software"
     is the system master disk; all other software is
     applications software!)

     "DOS machines are less friendly than Macintoshes."
     (Does this include ProDOS 16 machines?  Actually, there's no
     such thing as a "DOS machine," since the machine is a piece
     of hardware, while the DOS is a piece of software.  What you
     have is a machine capable of running a particular variety of
     DOS.)


     CORRECT USAGES:

     FidoNews 5-42                Page 17                  17 Oct 1988


     "I prefer UNIX to MS-DOS."
     (Refers to a particular operating system by its correct
     name.)

     "This software requires an IBM PC or compatible."
     (Alternate tack: refers to the hardware by its correct
     name.  MS-DOS-compatible and IBM-compatible machines are
     pretty much interchangeable these days, though there are a
     few exceptions such as the DEC Rainbow that run MS-DOS but
     aren't compatible with the IBM PC.  To be precise, it's
     best to say "MS-DOS" when referring to all MS-DOS based
     machines, and "IBM-compatible" when referring to just those
     which can run IBM PC software.)

     (In a magazine clearly identified as IBM-PC-specific): "Here
     are some hints and tips to help you make productive use of
     DOS commands."
     (Here the IBM PC's kind of DOS is presumed unless otherwise
     indicated.)

     (In a magazine clearly identified as Apple II-specific):
     "You may need to convert a file from DOS 3.3 to ProDOS."
     (Here, any references to DOS are presumed to be to Apple's
     DOS, just as such references in IBM-specific publications
     are presumed to be to IBM's.  Thus, the "DOS 3.3" is the
     earlier Apple operating system, not the MS-DOS 3.3 release.
     If the article actually wanted to discuss conversion of
     files from MS-DOS 3.3 to ProDOS, it would have said "You may
     need to convert a file from MS-DOS 3.3 to ProDOS.")


     I know I'm going against the current on this one, and future
     dictionaries will probably end up defining DOS as "the
     operating system devised by Microsoft for the IBM PC," but
     as a long-time computerist, I had to object to what I felt
     was an incorrect usage.  I think this usage stems from the
     arrogance of current computer users who feel that IBM PC's
     are the only real computers.  But, do you want to tell an
     Apple II enthusiast who's been booting up his DOS 3.3 system
     master for the last seven years that he's really not running
     "DOS software"?

     What Another Battle?
     By Gene Coppola

     The following letter came in in last nights netmail!

     Mr. Thom L. Henderson
     System Enhancement Associates, Inc.
     21 New Street
     Wayne, New Jersey  07470

     Dear Mr. Henderson,

     I object to the nature of the actions you and your company have
     been taking against other software vendors, particularly
     shareware companies working in the area of ARC-compatible
     utilities.

     I feel that these actions are without basis and done with malice
     in an attempt to drive your competitors out of business. I don't
     believe that these actions will benefit the PC user community or
     your company in any way in the long term, nor that they will
     advance the state of the art in software.

     Indeed, I feel that their effects on the bulletin board community
     are divisive.  I feel that your actions are wrong. I ask that you
     discontinue all such actions and undo the harm that you have
     already done to the industry.  Further, you should go back to
     spending your efforts and money in a way more advantageous to
     both yourself and the computer industry as a whole--and that is
     in developing new products and improving your existing products
     fairly and openly.

     I was requested to sign it and then upload it to other systems.
     What a bunch of crap this is! Thom Henderson has done more for
     computer users than many people realize! Without ARC we would
     all suffer. Without XLATLIST and other network utilities we
     would be back to updating the nodelist BY HAND!! (Yes I Have
     Been Around That Long!) You can believe me, it was a job just
     making 20 changes a week. Can you IMAGINE what it would be like
     making 100+ changes a week?

     As an author myself, I recognize the value of both a Copyright
     and a Trademark. The laws regarding these items were put in
     place to protect the time and effort people put into their work!

     I feel that Thom is well within his rights to protect his time
     and effort!

              QT/2 A Fantastic Computer At A Great Price
                           By Gene Coppola

     It has been six months since I first reported on the QT/2
     computer system. Many improvements have taken place since then
     and I felt an updated review was in order.

     All QT/2 owners have received a motherboard upgrade as well as
     an additional ROM upgrade. These upgrades were supplied at no
     cost! Each owner received a letter asking us to have our
     motherboard securely packaged and ready for pickup on a specific
     date. U.P.S. delivered the new board and picked up the old one.

     The first improvement has been the ROM updates. These were
     received several weeks ago and have been installed and tested.
     The updates provide for a speed increase of 300 per cent with a
     VGA monitor. The QT/2 motherboard comes with a built in display
     adaptor for Mono, CGA, EGA and VGA displays. The update provides
     for a maximum resolution of 800 x 600 when a VGA monitor is in
     use.

     The second improvement has been in memory management. QT/2
     motherboards come with 12 megabytes of 60ns RAM. The setup
     routine now allows you to assign any portion of this RAM to
     extended or expanded memory. This is a blessing for those of us
     running Oracle, Desqview, OS/2 and Windows 386.

     The third improvement is in OS/2 compatibility. OS/2 is fully
     supported and works very well on the QT/2. The full 12 megabytes
     can now be accessed. Windows 386 now files on the QT/2.

     The fourth improvement is the internal disk controller. Over 120
     different hard drives are now supported. The new controller now
     supports six drives, both floppy and hard drives in any
     combination. Cables are supplied for two hard drives and four
     floppy drives. The controller also supports over 15 different
     external or internal tape drive units.

     The fifth and finest improvement is in the motherboard itself.
     The updated motherboards are rated at 25 Mhz and come with both
     80387 and Wietek co-processor sockets. 12 megabytes of 60ns RAM
     are installed on the motherboard. Both the disk controller and
     display adaptor use 32 bit architecture to provide the fastest
     speeds possible. The motherboard tests out at a speed of 8.1
     MIPS.

     One 32 bit slot is provided on the motherboard for the optional
     memory expansion board. The expansion board comes with 20
     megabytes of 60ns RAM bringing the system total up to 32
     megabytes. This additional RAM and the Wietek co-processor brings
     mini-computer speed and power to you at micro-computer prices.

     For those of you that did not read the first review I will go
     over the major features of this fine system.

     The QT/2 comes with 12 megabytes of 60ns RAM and a 64k 25ns high
     FidoNews 5-42                Page 21                  17 Oct 1988


     speed cache. The main processor is a 25 Mhz 80386 with sockets
     for an 80387 or Wietek co-processor.

     A 40 megabyte Seagate ST-251-1 hard disk drive is included as
     well as a 1.2 Mb floppy and a 360k floppy. Due to the
     proprietary nature of the built in disk controller no
     partitioning software is needed. Running under Dos 3.3 or OS/2
     the QT/2 handles any hard drive up to 300 megabytes as one drive.

     Two serial ports and two parallel ports are built into the
     motherboard. A 220 watt switching power supply is now standard
     equipment.

     The disk controller and display adaptor are built into the
     motherboard. Both are covered above so we will not go into those
     items here.

     A clock/calendar is built into the motherboard. This is backed
     up by a regular nine volt battery that is known to be available
     almost anywhere you go.

     Nine expansion slots are available. One is a 32 bit slot reserved
     for a RAM expansion board. Six slots are 16 bit slots and two are
     8 bit slots. Almost every possible expansion feature is built
     into the motherboard and nine slots seems like a bit of overkill,
     but this is the way the board was designed.

     The QT/2 comes in a heavy duty metal case complete with a key
     lock that secures the case and activates the keyboard. A separate
     lock is supplied to secure the power switch preventing
     unauthorized use of the system.

     The keyboard is an enhanced AT style keyboard with tactile touch
     keys and led indicators for Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock.

     The QT/2 is one of the few computers with a complete MCA style
     bus. This is completely functional and has been tested with many
     of the expansion products now available for PS/2 systems.

     This is truly an exceptional value at $1995.00. An 80386 based
     system with an MCA style bus ready to plug in and run. The hard
     drive comes formatted under DOS 3.3 but can be easily be
     reformatted if desired.

     At this time the motherboard is not available as a separate item,
     but future plans include selling the motherboard as separate
     unit.

     The United States distributor for the QT/2 is A WORLD OF
     COMPUTERS at 151-28 22nd Avenue in Whitestone, New York. The zip
     code is 11357. No phone inquiries please.

     Currently there is a shipping backlog of about 14 to 21 days from
     the day an order with full payment is received.

     All QT/2 systems come with a 13 month warranty covering parts,
     FidoNews 5-42                Page 22                  17 Oct 1988


     labor, shipping and insurance in the event a system must be
     returned for repair.

     SUPERLIB, the finest user library for Quick Basic 4.0 owners
     has been updated and enlarged and now includes support for OS/2.
     New features have been added and old ones improved upon.

     The first and most obvious feature is the size of SUPERLIB! The
     library now has over 120 routines including complete mouse and
     DOS level file control. This is about 60% more than in previous
     versions and puts it on par with the expensive commercial
     libraries. Many of the SUPERLIB routines run under OS/2!

     Many FUNCTIONS have been written in Assembler! This allows you to
     evaluate a subroutine as an expression or assign the result in
     fewer lines of code! This lends itself to a number of advantages,
     ie; the code is smaller, easier to read, and makes more sense. All
     it requires is a simple DECLARE statement at the start of your
     code.

     SUPERLIB now supports complete file access via DOS Functions. In
     so doing, you can completely avoid those annoying runtime errors
     by letting DOS return an error code, rather than an error!

     SUPERLIB now has a considerable number of routines added for
     mouse support, including cursor control, mouse work area
     restrictions, and sensitivity. These have been thoroughly tested
     on the new Microsoft mouse, the Logitech mouse and the Mouse
     Systems mouse. All work fine except the Mouse Systems mouse needs
     an explicit call to set the cursor mask, so we have added one.

     The routines used in SUPERLIB are written mostly in assembler
     and assembled under MASM 5.0.  The few BASIC based routines that
     there are, were written under QuickBASIC 4.0.

     We distribute SUPERLIB in two different ways. The ShareWare
     version provides you with everything you need to call and execute
     the SUPERLIB routines from within the editor/environment. This
     provides an ample opportunity for testing and evaluation. The
     ShareWare disk is available for $10 which includes postage.

     The complete version of SUPERLIB is for those of you who want to
     incorporate SUPERLIB routines in their own .EXE applications. In
     this case, the library of routines and a license to use them in
     such applications is available for $20 which includes postage.

     This breaks down to a cost of less than 14 cents per routine. No
     other user library comes close to our low cost. SUPERLIB comes
     with over 50 popular public domain programs including a screen
     generator that generates Microsoft object files compatible with
     Quick Basic, C, Pascal, Fortran, MASM, Lattice C, Aztec C,
     Clipper and a host of other languages that support .OBJ files.

     SUPERLIB is available from BASIC PROGRAMMERS LIMITED, 2nd Floor,
     110 Hillsboro Avenue, Elmont, New York 11003 and is covered by a
     money back warranty.

                       Survey Time Rolls Around Again!
                                  By Gene Coppola

     Well it is again time to run a survey and see who reads FIDONEWS.
     Last years results were interesting and this year I hope to get
     more responses then last year!

     The idea behind the survey is to try and determine the readership
     of FIDONEWS, where these people live and their age.

     It was suggested that instead of asking people to send a postcard
     that we use netmail instead. After much thought I agree with this
     method. It is easier for most people and much quicker than
     waiting for postcards to get here.

     If you would like to participate please send a netmail message to
     GENE COPPOLA on 1:107/200. Please include your age, and what
     city, state or province and the country you live in.

     The results will be published in a future issue of FIDONEWS.

     SYSOP SUES USER WHO ALLEGEDLY UPLOADED TROJAN PROGRAM

     by Jonathan D. Wallace, Esq. 107/801

     Bill Christison, sysop of a bulletin board system called the
     Santa Fe Message, filed suit in August in New Mexico federal
     court against a user he believed had uploaded a trojan horse
     program to his BBS.

     The program, which purported to compile statistics on BBS usage,
     erased the operating system from Christison's hard disk and
     damaged the file allocation table when he ran it.

     With the aid of the telephone company, Christison was able to
     identify the user (who had called his BBS under a pseudonym as
     Michael Dagg, also of New Mexico.)

     Christison's law suit is the second case involving bulletin board
     systems to have been brought under the Electronic Communications
     Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA).

     Under the ECPA, it is a federal crime to access stored electronic
     communications without authorization and to alter, obtain or
     prevent access to such communications. Penalties include
     imprisonment of up to one year and fines up to $250,000.00.
     The statute also provides for private civil suits such as
     Christison's.

     As of October 7th, Dagg had not yet hired an attorney or
     responded to the complaint, according to Christison's attorney,
     Ann Yalman.

     The ECPA potentially provides a potent tool for sysops who wish
     to defend themselves against malicious users. It is a two-edged
     sword, however: the first case brought under the ECPA involving
     bulletin board systems was Thompson v. Predaina, in which a user
     sued a sysop who allegedly made private files public without
     permission.

                        Computer Viruses I'd Like To See

                               By David Rice
                               (1:103/503.0)

          As  long as folks are going to go through all the time,
     energy, and hassle to write computer viruses, I'd like  some
     custom made,  please.    I  mean, since most computers won't
     practice safe software sharing, I may as well turn  that  to
     some advantage.     I  know  there  are  electronic  condoms
     floating around, such as FluShot+ and C-4, but most computer
     users don't know about  them  (there  was  no  Computer  Sex
     Education in Health Class in High School).

          It  has  occurred to me that one virus could infect the
     OPUS.EXE file to produce a CRASH file in the  Outbound  File
     Area,  which  would  contain the host's BBS.CTL and USER.BBS
     files, to be sent late at night while  the  infected  host's
     SysOp innocently  slept.    Some  fine  folks have done this
     already via "BBS utilities," and  not  viruses;  The  "virus
     approach" is the next step.

          A  nice feature for the infected OPUS.EXE file would be
     instant SysOp access to each and every  caller  who  used  a
     particular password.    This password would be known only to
     the author of the  virus  and  myself,  who  payed  for  the
     genetic engineering  project  in  the  first place.  This is
     much safer than looking for  a  particular  user's  name  to
     assign  SysOp  level,  of  course, and this will insure that
     when the genuine, true, legitimate SysOp discovers the bogus
     one (me), I can always call back under a different  name  to
     reek my havoc, to pillage, to plunder, etc.

          Have  you  ever  considered  the  incalculable damage a
     virus that seeks out LANs could do?  Our LAN here at work is
     hooked up to Chicago via a 9600 baud modem.  Files sent over
     this phone line go not  only  to  the  corporate  data  base
     there,  but  from  there  to  six  other  divisions  in  the
     corporation.  Gee.  Think of the  possibilities!    A  month
     from  now  over  2,000  employees  could come to work in the
     morning, type in LOTUS at their DOS prompt, and get a  warm,
     friendly greeting  from  me instead!  I'll take one of these
     viruses too, please.  Thank you.

          Speaking of spread sheets, there's  another  virus  I'd
     like, if  you  don't  mind.   Let's suppose I worked for the
     Mish Mash Development Corporation, who is in the Spreadsheet
     development industry.    Naturally,  I'd   want   only   OUR
     spreadsheet to  be used.  This virus would infect every file
     on some poor unsuspecting slob's computer,  of  course,  but
     it's  main  function  would  be  to seek out and destroy all
     "Lotus 1-2-3" <tm> and "Quatro"  <tm>  and  "Symphony"  <tm>
     files, thus clearing up space for our "Mish Mash Inna Flash"
     spreadsheet,  which  isn't  nearly  as  nice but at least it
     isn't copy protected.  I suspect the market for  this  virus
     to  be  a  massive  one: I envision the hard disk becoming a
     FidoNews 5-42                Page 27                  17 Oct 1988


     battle ground,  with  "R:Base  System  V"  <tm>  fighting  a
     desperate  struggle  against  "D:BaseIII+" <tm> for complete
     and total hard disk domination.  Rival software could easily
     keep you on your toes, and add much to the wear and tear  of
     your disk  drives.    I'll  take one of these geared against
     "ASTROL95", please  (my  rival  in  the  astrology  software
     market).  Thank you much.

          Perhaps  another virus would cause a subliminal message
     to flash on the screen every few minutes  that  says  "DAVID
     DESERVES  A  PAY  RAISE!"  I  could  deliberately  go to the
     Manager Offices and infect their computers. "Hey,"  I  would
     begin,  blushing  and innocent as a virgin, "I've got a neat
     program here  that  makes  your  computer  run  875.62%  (on
     average) faster!   Let  me  install it for you. . . ."  This
     virus would have an install program to change  the  message.
     In  this way I could sell my services to those who require a
     raise in pay, at a flat rate or a percentage over an  agreed
     upon time  period.   The possibilities are endless with this
     virus: "Vote For ME!" or "SAVE THE DINOSAURS!"  or  "GOD  IS
     DEAD!"  or  "REMOVE  YOUR  BRA!" or "STOP PICKING YOUR NOSE,
     JERK!" My boss might come up with one that says  "QUIT!"  or
     "YOU'RE FIRED!" just to keep my anxiety level high.

          So if you are in the virus engineering business, please
     drop me a line.  Let's talk.

                 Distributed Electronic Voting
         as it aplies to Fidonet elections and plebicites

         By useing the capabilities of public key encryption it
     is relativly simple to provide for verifiable electronic
     voting with simple netmail attached files.  There are a few
     practical considerations which complicate matters but do not
     by any means prevent implementation.

         I will assume a passing familiarity with public key
     encryption techniques.  For further info interested parties
     should refer to past fidonews issues.

         The simplest form of voteing would be a "public forum"
     or "show of hands" type of voting.  The only special
     consideration required is verification of the voter's
     identity and their right to vote such that only registered
     voters vote and they only get one vote each.  For our
     purposes, the nodelist is usually the list of registered
     voters.

         To start with each voter would generate his own public
     key.  These keys are in the form of small (less than 1/2 k)
     files.  The keys should be collected through the regular
     hub-NC-RC-ZC hierarchy.  All public keys should be freely
     available at any level to anyone who wants a copy (of the
     full set or any subset).  This would mean that at the top
     levels the full collection would amount to perhaps 2
     megabytes for 4000 nodes.  Fidonet bounces files of this
     magnitude around the net it seems fairly often in the form
     of echomail.

         NCs and RCs would be responsible for resolvoing any
     discrepancies such as conflicting submisions for a single
     node.  A directly delivered message to the node's phone
     number bypassing all routeing and pick-up situations should
     resolve any such problems.  If there are further questions,
     protocols can be worked out to resolve them.

         Any node should be able to verify their key at any time
     with a digitally signed message from their NC or in extreme
     cases RC or even ZC/IC.

         Once the keys are collected, they would be relativley
     stable.  At least as stable as the nodelist.  Nodes not
     submitting a key could be implying a wish not to vote.  In
     particular, keys need not be changed for subsequent
     elections.

         When a vote is to take place, it would follow the same
     flow of information.  At each level the votes would be
     verified and sumarized so that an RC does not need to
     actually do the full digital signature verification on all
     votes but only needs to sum up the votes from the NCs in his
     region and verify the independant nodes and add them into
     the totals.  The RC would also forward all the actual signed
     FidoNews 5-42                Page 29                  17 Oct 1988


     votes to the ZC for random checks or verification.  Note
     that no one should need to send the whole works in one shot.
     Only the votes from one region would be sent.

         ZCs simply add up the totals from the RCs and if
     required forwards the totals to the IC (and makes available
     the votes themselves to other interested parties such as
     scrutineers).  The ballots themselves can be quite small
     files also, on the order of 100 bytes, depending on the
     exact issues being voted upon.

         Note that this particular plan depends on the vote being
     open as oposed to a secret ballot vote.  Note also that the
     above proposal is a minumum.  For instance, an RC who has a
     very fast machine could verify all the ballots from his
     region.  The reason that full verification is not required
     is that the verification process is rather time consuming
     (pure CPU time that is).  Also the candidates or any
     interested parties could perform spot checks or
     verifications to search for anomalies.

         If it is determined that a secret ballot is required
     then it becomes even more complicated.  Several layers of
     encryption are required and extra record keeping is needed
     for verification or re-counts.  The simplest form would go
     something like this:

         First a returning officer would be appointed.  He would
     create a special public key for the vote and publish it in
     fidonews or somehow make sure all eligible voters got a copy
     of it.  He would also appoint deputies for each region or
     voting district.  The deputies would get copies of the
     special private key.  In normal cases this might be the RC
     unless some conflict of interest is in effect.  Special
     deputies for the nets may also be needed if a NC is not
     suitable but the net level would not have the special
     private keys.  Probably the regional deputies could be
     empowered to apoint net level deputies.  (Zone 2 and 3
     sysops, please excuse me if I gloss over inter-zone
     protocols.  I beleive they can be extrapolated relativly
     simply from this.)

         The voter creates his ballot without personally
     identifying marks and encrypts it with the special public
     key.  The voter then signs the result with his own private
     key and sends the result to his NC.  The NC gathers all the
     ballots which come in before the voting deadline and removes
     the first layer using the public keys of his nodes insuring
     that only registered voters have voted and that they have
     only voted once.  He forwards the results to the RC.  It may
     be desireable to have the NC sign and/or encrypt this stuff.
     The NC must keep the signed ballots in case verification is
     ever asked for.  The NC should NOT show the signed ballots
     to his RC though in order to maintain the secrecy of the
     ballot.  The NC knows who voted but does not know how they
     voted.
     FidoNews 5-42                Page 30                  17 Oct 1988


         The RC should only receive annonymous messages encrypted
     with the special public key.  When the RC de-crypts them he would
     only count proper un-spoiled ballots (without identifying
     marks etc).  The RC then forwards a tally on up the ladder
     in the same manner as the previous example.  The RC should
     be careful to not reveal the corespondance between the
     encrypted ballots he receives and the decrypted ballots that
     he counts.

         This implies a minimal level of trust in the
     coordinators by the voters.  If the RC or NC is deemed
     unsuitable for either of these tasks then alternate election
     officers should be appointed.  If it is estimated that the
     computational burden on the RC's machine would be too great
     then extra deputies could be added to help out.  A CPA or
     somesuch could be hired to do verifications but such a
     person would need considerable computing power or a lot of
     time to do a full verification.  It would be quite feasable
     to verify only the top levels completely and make do with
     spot checks at lowwer levels.

         If the coordinator is not trusted by the voters and no
     acceptable alternate can be agreed upon, the voters can
     either revert to a non-secret ballot or attempt to arrange a
     protocol where no one needs to be trusted.  If they try for
     the latter, and I'm not sure it is possible, it will
     doubtless involve more administration and more computation
     than the plans presented here.  Perhaps they should also
     consider reverting to a primitive style paper vote.

         One major advantage for this system is that it should be
     possible to carry it out much faster than a paper/post
     office type of vote.  The ballots could go out in fnews or
     an echo conference and the results should be tallyable
     within a week.

         This article should demonstrate the feasability of a
     completely electronic voting system.  The security of the
     system is demonstrably quite high and should be technically
     acceptable to anyone who wishes to investigate the details
     further.  It is possible to add even more security at the
     cost of extra computational and orgazizational effort.
     There remains only to work out nameing conventions for the
     various files and archives and a general acceptance of the
     scheme by the fidonet community.  This last may be the most
     difficult.

         Anyone familiar with the PKSCrypt software system for
     public key encryption may notice that I have selfish reasons
     for promoting these concepts.  I will try to partially
     defuse that objection by saying that I am willing to let
     Fidonet sysops use PKSCrypt for Fidonet voteing purposes
     without demanding that they pay the shareware licence fee;
     at least until alternative public key encryption packages
     become available from other sources.  I have prepared a
     document which should allow sufficiently technically

     oriented people to create such software.  That document and
     the PKSCrypt package are available from my system for MANUAL
     download on your first call.  FILE REQUESTS ARE NOT
     SUPPORTED.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                       Episode 13:  The Negative Side


     "IF THIS REALLY WAS A GOOD HOBBY NETWORK YOU'D TALK ABOUT D&D".

     This was a message to me  from  a  user  about my board.  I don't
     happen to have any  message  areas  that  cover  D&D.  Funny that
     should be the  case,  since  my  advertised  specialty  areas are
     EagleTech Software and the national AVIATION EchoMail conference.

     I politely responded,  explaining  that  "Amateur  Hobby Network"
     means that  *I*  have  a  hobby  in  playing  with  computers and
     networking them together.  It  does not necessarily follow that I
     support all hobbies.  Even though  I happen to like D&D and other
     adventure, role-playing and war games.

     Then I get this guy who  calls  in  with  a name whose validity I
     question.  So I left him a  message  AND a custom welcome, asking
     him to verify the name,  with  address  and  phone number.  Seven
     times he logged in, saw the custom  welcome, and hit all the file
     areas and logged off.  I dropped  him  to DISGRACE status, left a
     more clearly worded custom welcome; still he called in about four
     more times, tried to hit the file  areas (the only one allowed at
     DISGRACE level  is  the  FidoNews  Area),  and  logged off.  So I
     TWITted him.  Why didn't he just leave me a message?  I even told
     him how to do it on the custom welcome.

     And the classic  -  "Hacker  calling".    Oh,  that's  TWIT level
     immediately.

     Why is it so hard for people to  say who they really are on BBSs?
     I don't recall ever  having  that  difficulty when *I* was a mere
     user.  And if  ever  there  was  a  strange  person, I definitely
     qualify.  But *I*  never  had  any  problems  using my real name.
     Handles are kind of nice, when  they  apply, but this doesn't cut
     well in EchoMail.  Too many people out there.

     Oh, well,  even  FidoNet  can't  be  all  blessings  and charm, I
     suppose.  I've been blessed,  even  in my troubles with users, in
     that I haven't had any vicious  hackers  trying to crash my board
     or slam my communication links.    I've heard of such, but (knock
     on wood) haven't seen any.

     I guess I'll just overlook the negative side and enjoy my hobby.
