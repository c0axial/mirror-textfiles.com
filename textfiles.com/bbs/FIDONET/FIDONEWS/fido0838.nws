Editorial: More of same

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Another editorial devoted to the FidoNews article
submission policy. So far, all I have heard (even from myself) is all or
nuttin' -- FidoNet/technology related, or wide open, willy nilly include
*.ART. I think there are other possibilities. One is outlined below.


The issue boils down to the very basics of Western Law. We want to
formulate a fair and predictable policy that satisfies the needs of
authors, readers, and lastly, the editor. Fairness here means every
reasonable voice is heard. We're trying to define reasonable, and at the
same time, prevent individual(s) from excluding text for arbitrary
reasons. (Arbitrary to the authors that is.)

--> I subscribe to the theory that it is better to be able to make the
choice yourself, even at the slight expense of getting annoyed or
offended occasionally.

--> A minority claims that receiving "offensive" material is an assault,
that offensive material should not be published in the first place.

If you claim to have such a "right", then I do as well, and if I would
not be offended, then causing the removal of such things before I see
them is *a priori* interfering with my personal affairs, which you have
*no right* to do. *Especially* if you don't agree with me -- if we all
always agreed, there would be no controversy in the first place!

--> If something is excluded, I cannot choose; I am deprived of the
information, good or bad. The choice was made for me.

--> If something is included, you then have the information by which to
choose. And others can exercise their right as well, independent from
yours.

If you are repeatedly offended you can simply cut off the offending
communication channel -- in this case, FidoNews. FidoNews is not the
only
game in town. I have been reviewing other electronic newsletters, and
this is a free country still, you can start your own. I'll even help --
even if I don't like it!


A NEW PROPOSAL:

FidoNews 8-38                  Page 2                      23 Sep 1991


I now propose that the policy remain "wide open". However --

If a particular article generates a cascade of responses, the editor
does two things: (1) chooses one or few of them as representative; (2)
passes them on to the original author, who is asked to write a response
within 2 weeks. The resulting representative response(s), and the
original authors response, are run in one (3rd week?) FidoNews issue.
This is done ONCE ONLY. Interested parties can then pick up the torch
and march with it off the long or short pier of their choice.

I'm sure I'm reinventing the wheel here, it's something we here in
Fidoland seem to do a lot. Hopefully we learn from our mistakes.

European DEMO(FIDO)CRACY or POWER POLITICAL Platforms?

                      Why did I join FidONET?

In August of 1990, I joined FidONet. Why? Because I wanted to belong to
an organized collective group of individuals who shared the same idea's
of communication, irrespective of age, religion, creed, colour, society
or nationality.  I wanted to communicate with like minded people around
the World.  FidONet appealed to me because it held this principle in an
easily accessible, OPEN and financially unrestrictive environment.

This was THE Philosophy  and 'Spirit of FidONet' which has now resulted
in 51 Regions in 6 Zones WORLDWIDE and in excess of 11,000+ BB Systems.

              Policy as DOGMA or CONCEPTUAL Ideology?

Quantitatively speaking we have an immense Network governed by A POLICY
in many respects OPEN, subject to interpretation,  allowing flexibility
and scope for change.  Indeed, since it's inception FidONet has changed
and will continue to change to accomodate different technologies, needs
purposes, attitudes &c.,&c. Throughout Policy 'themes' of expandability
and interpretation are relayed to the SysOp, conveying the message that
little apart from the 'TECHNICAL ROLES' of Coordinators are NOT SUBJECT
to interpretation.This belief that the role of the *C Structure is ONLY
in coordination and NOT GOVERNMENT, forms the backbone of a technically
stable, competant FidONet, continuing a tradition of accessibility  and
CONNECTIVITY for ALL.

           Democracy in OPPOSITION to the *C Structure?

I am in Zone 2. Z2 compromises 26 Regions ideologically, sociologically
(in fact ALL the 'ologically's' you can think of ;) DIFFERENT.

I'm in U.K. Z2 Region 25. Where we have seen a DRAMATIC increase in the
amount of dissent,disatisfaction, anger and finally mutiny resulting in
a resignation, reinstatement / retraction (via Vote of Confidence)  and
finally a firm resignation by a 'democratically' elected R.C. Why? I'll
tell you why. Because, he sought to UNILATERALLY CHANGE U.K. FidONet.
Interfering with NetWork operations, Electronic Mail and the conduct of
BBS Systems within Region. It's not isolated to Region 25. In Region 23
(Denmark), in Region 29 (Belgium) &c.,&c., we see the same by those who
were democratically elected into technical/coordinatorial positions and
NOT into a psuedo-presidential office.

FidoNews 8-38                  Page 5                      23 Sep 1991


A Coordinator is NOT required to provide any sort of 'Leadership' in an
environment where his primary responsibility is one of coordination and
technical/administrative scope. His ONLY RIGHT as coordinator is to TRY
(not unilaterally). Democracy is not the same as 'Autocracy'. In Europe
and the U.K. we've seen a dangerous progression to the latter,resulting
in states of defragmentation and bureaucracy, by these overly political
ambitious, power crazed zealots, who are turning the FidONet philosophy
of communication into ' Power-Platforms' for their mandates on morality
judgement, sociological ideologies, based on a Policy, which *DOES NOT*
allow them these self-adopted (or self-inflicted) priviledges.

We therefore see the  creation of states of anarchy,  in the process as
more ' grunt ' SysOp's rebel against benign dictatorships or autocratic
regimes analogous to the Eastern Block which 'Democratic' Europe fought
against and WON.

               Reconciliation of the FUNDAMENTAL - How?

In coming to a solution to said problems,which are by no means isolated
to European FidO we have to re-examine the role of COORDINATOR as it is
described in Policy and within a DIRECT context to the changing face of
FidONet in the 1990's.  We therefore need to find ( at the very least )
proximate solutions to what apparently seem insoluble problems.

We NEED to ask ourselves some questions:

1) Do we NEED Leaders and/or figurheads ?
2) Do we NEED a Democracy ?
3) Do we NEED a CENTRALIZED government ?
4) Do we NEED to re-examine our DECENTRALIZED autonomy ?
5) Do we NEED to review *C Structure responsibility ?
6) Do we NEED to review Policy ?

In pursuit of these answers,  re-examination of the primary fundamental
philosopy that propels FidONet on continuing success, is a necessity to
establish codes of practice for the *C Structure.  Most importantly the
acceptance that FidONet is a non-commercial, amateur EMail NetWork with
a technical / managerial heirarchy which specifically abstains and DOES
NOT aspire to ANY 'Leadership' heirarchy, existing solely to provide an
End User with an independant EMail resource,to advance their individual
interests and/or pursuits freely and without compromise.

In Closing:

To express this eloquently, I'll end by quoting a fellow  NET253 SysOp
who has captured the idea humourously though pointedly in reference to
the above.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
'But that is no licence to any of us 'fleas' on FidO's back, aspire to
 become the tail that tries to wag the dog'.

We as Members of FidONet have a responsibilty not only to ourselves in
maintaining the ' Spirit of FidONet ' but we owe it to ALL User's that
patronise our Systems' and who *COMMUNICATE* through us, to offer them
those services that we as SysOp's take for granted.  We cannot do this
effectively if our own house is in disarray,due to a small minority of
individuals who insist on propagating the ideals of a strongly led and
controlled - commercially effective NetWork.  We need our *C Structure
to COORDINATE FidONet but we cannot tolerate a *C Structure who's main
aims and objectives are that of CONTROL.

Michael Pereira.

Author's name?!

IF THIS IS TRUE, IT MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF THE
END OF BBS'S AS WE KNOW THEM. I AM ATTEMPTING
TO VERIFY THIS INFORMATION AT THIS TIME. I
FEEL IF ONE STATE GETS AWAY WITH THIS THEN
EVERY STATE WILL ENACT A SIMILAR LAW!

OVERVIEW:

In brief summary, the law which stands, says that a SysOp
that allows the transfer of software from his BBS, is in
violation of the NYS Tax and Finance Law, and is subject
to substantial fines, and penalties.

NYS has begun taxing software based on the "value" of the
software, regardless of the authors asking price, on PD
or FW software. I am adamantly opposed to this taxation, as
SysOps receive no compensation for our efforts!

"Effective September 1, 1991, the sale of all prewritten
software will be subject to New York State and local sales
tax.  The sale of prewritten software includes any transfer
of title or possession, any exchange, barter, rental, lease
or license to use, including merely the right to reproduce.

The only software which will now be considered exempt is
software designed or written to the specification of a
specific purchaser. The medium by which the software is
transferred to the purchaser has no effect on its
taxability."

By: Fred Vobbe, SysOp 1:234/16.
How Caller ID Helped Me.

    The controversial talk over the Caller ID issue has really spawned
some interesting debates in the various echoes.  If you don't know what
Caller ID is, it's a device placed on your telephone line that allows you
to see the number of the person who is calling, before you pick up the
phone.  This is done by a datastream which is sent during the ring-cycle.
I should point out that not all telephone systems have this feature
available.

    In some areas they are treating the issue as taboo, while other telcos
(telephone companies) are offer it willingly to customers.  It is also
received in the same way by customers, clients, and the general public.  In
reading the echoes I have seen everything from lighthearted debate to out
and out war complete with threats.  Why all the excitement over Caller ID?.

    For some people, calling someone and having their number displayed to
person they are calling is quite threatening.  These folks don't want
anyone to know where they are calling from, for whatever reason.  In 25% of
the messages read, by reading the context of the message or noting the type
of tag/origin lines, I always had the feeling that the person doing the
most yelling and screaming against Caller ID had something to hide.  Others
just didn't like the idea of their "privacy" being invaded.  (Hmmmmm, what
about the privacy of the person they are calling?)

    Now if it seems like I am for Caller ID, you have guessed right.  I was
not sold on it until the last 6 months proved to me that the system is an
acceptable utility in todays communications.

    About two years ago, I had a very abusive user on my system.  This
person would leave flames in public areas, slandered the sysops and users,
and log on under several names at a time.  We were finally able to nail him
when we noticed that he logged on using his real name, and another users
password, dropped carrier, and called back immediately using his "abusive"
user name and the same password.  After getting booted from they system, he
made the rounds to other systems kicking and yelling, telling people how
were out to get him.

    A short time afterwards he started his own system, and later installed
a mailer system.  It was then that our real problems surfaced.  For a while
we had a mailer calling us using the node number 1:234/56.  There is no 56
in our net.  The mailer was FREQing our echomail from us using *.MO* *.TU*
*.WE* etc.  The sysop name on the log was blank, as was the boards name.
Later, the board's name came up as "HA!", with sysop name of Fuk Ewe.  I
then passworded the node number 1:234/56 and removed all FREQ access to my
e:\fd\files area.

    The mailer continued to call, and later it assumed the number, name,
and sysop name of my NEC.  Problem was, my NEC was running Binkley and the
mailer calling was FD 199C.  My NEC also ran an HST at 9600 baud, while the
mystery mailer continued to call at 2400 baud.  This nonsense continued for
a while with the system trying to FREQ files, nodelists, anything just to
tie up my system during ZMH.

FidoNews 8-38                  Page 8                      23 Sep 1991


    Then more trouble started when my mail processing was choked at least
eleven times by the mailer dropping off echomail bombs.  The mail was from
some Si-Fi echo and had the origins and seen-bys altered.  It was also
presented to us as the HA! echo.  Later we got real mail bombs, which
unpacked from 12.MSG to 772.MSG, with each message being around 10-18k in
length, (the text being random characters).  This crippled our mail, as
well as brought our system down for up to twelve hours till we could sort
things out.

    Keep in mind that over the past year my NEC/NC could not do anything.
I could not do anything because the bulk of the abuse was happening when I
was sleeping at night or away on business.  I was forced into passwording,
and putting security on my entire system, (which I hated to do because I
always kept my system open so anyone could get anything they wanted at
anytime).  Because my system passed mail to other boards, and hubbed files,
it was killing our productivity.

    It was then that I spoke to a couple friends, one which works for a
telephone company and is experienced in tracing and tracking calls on
digital systems.  The other is a lawyer who worked for a -very- large
corporation and worked directly with the F.C.C. on all the corporations
broadcast interests.   From past history, and their recommendations, I make
the decision to install Caller ID.

    All telephone lines on our system were hooked up, and a message was
generated which after a person calls, the first thing they see is "CALLER
ID ENABLED".  Within 48 hours after the Caller ID box was installed, and
users saw the message, all the shit stopped!  No bogus log-ons leaving
flames in public areas.  No mailers using false numbers dropping off bombs
and requesting 12 meg worth of files.

    Am I happy?  Yes, I think that Caller ID served it's purpose!  For the
money invested in the box, it was well worth getting rid of all the hassles
and unnecessary hours I had to spend cleaning out message bases, and
straightening up my mail.  Anyone with legitimate reasons to call has
nothing to fear, but the ones calling just to trash our board can't call
now because they can be found out.

    As a point of interest, having documented everything in the past couple
of years, (60 disks worth), and having the contacts with some heavy hitters
in the legal world, it is plain to see that should anything start up again
the abusive caller could wind up with a multi- million dollar law suit and
jail time.  Just to defend themselves in a court of law could cost them
every asset they have.

    My local telco was unwilling to tell me what they would do if they
caught the person, and seemed very much apathetic to the matter.  They
refused to discuss any penalty or what they would do.  However, removing
the issue from the local telco and placing it directly into a court of law
with substantial evidence, and using federal telecommunications laws, it is
obvious that I now have a weapon to protect myself from abuse.

FidoNews 8-38                  Page 9                      23 Sep 1991


    I also have to commend at least one software company who has written
software that interfaces with the Caller ID box to provide a database of
callers.  I would hope that other authors of mailer and BBS software take
note of this feature, and write it into their product.

    In conclusion, I know that some people are opposed to Caller ID.  Fine,
you have your right to your opinion.  My writing is not to promote the
device, only to inform those here how I regained a lot of my free time,
sanity, and lost the aggravation of abuse on my system, just because of
-one- abusive user.  I'm not going to debate the issue, but I will shake
the hand of the guy who invented the device.  He provided me with a very
valuable tool to curb abuse on my system.

                  Once upon a long time ago...
                       G. Joseph Peck
          VETLink #1 - Berkshire Veterans' Center, Inc.
           Post Office Box 2056 - Pittsfield, MA 01202
                        (413) 443-6313

Once upon a long time ago "advisors" were sent to a little country
across the sea. Soon thereafter, a US President said "Ask not
what your country can do for YOU... ask what YOU can do for your
country!" Almost immediately, there thronged to military
recruitment centers around the country hordes of young Americans,
eager and willing to do what proud countrymen had done in ages
past: Defend America and her principles - this time in a country
called Viet Nam.

With leaders that often pulled in different directions, objectives
taken only to be quickly abandoned, America super-examining HER
conscience and losing many of her finest, military strength began
to decrease and "Project 100,000" (A Great Society "brainchild"
instituted to get America's disadvantaged youth 'off the streets'
and teach military discipline and skills) was instituted. Soon
that, too, disturbed the conscience of America.

Proud defenders of freedom they, returning soldiers were treated
with less-than-honorable regard as America "punished the warriors"
for doing what their country had asked them to do.

Once upon a long time ago, too, on a cold and quiet Wyoming night,
a computer-using veteran tap-tap-tapped out a message on his
keyboard to another veteran who "understood" and "talked the same
language" into an echo called VIETNAM_VETS. A "bouncing betty" had
taken the legs from that veteran and he was confined to his home
"for the duration".
FidoNews 8-38                  Page 12                     23 Sep 1991


Soon, heavens that once were filled with tears melted into a link
of brotherhood. And that "brotherhood" grew and grew and grew as
more and more veterans discovered they weren't alone in their
nightmares, troubles and successes - and they began to communicate
with one another. Other "echoes" (message bases that were
exchanged with other BBSs and their users) were created as
VIETNAM_VETS discovered the wide range of topics that America's
veterans had in common - or wanted to learn more about... and
VETNet was born.

On Veterans' Day, 1987 (11/11/87) there entered into the computer-
using veterans' world an electronic newsletter that would distill
some of the information from VIETNAM_VETS and the VETNet echoes
and add other articles that all veterans (and their families)
might like to know about. "NamVet" - the electronic newsletter
by, for and about veterans and the issues that concern them -
became a monthly reality!

No "magic wand" was waved, nor was there anyone "behind the
scenes" casting spells or other incantations upon the messages in
VIETNAM_VETS and the VETNet echoes. Almost miraculously, a
"loosening of the chains" began to take place. Veterans, once
solely focused on the "rejection" they endured when they returned
to civilian life, began to communicate about BASIC training,
weaponry used in battle, tracers, dustoffs, medevacs, soldier
"games" and happenings, EARNED veteran benefits that often were
being denied by a cold an' sterile Veterans Administration and
other agencies ... and VETLink #1 - on the scene from almost day
one - increased its efforts to touch ALL veterans.

VETLink #2 (703-471-8010), with SysOp Ray "Frenchy" Moreau at the
Herndon, VA helm, added his efforts, equipment and expertise;
VETLink #3 (314-334-6359) in Cape Girardeau, MO with SysOp Mike
Bryeans continuously added his programming expertise and an awful
lot of needed help; VETLink #4 (301-261-5644) in Shady Side, MD
with SysOp Jim Hildwine added his communications expertise; and
VETLink #5 (201-778-1879) in Passaic, NJ with SysOp Fred Sochacki
"Semper Fidelis"-ing all the way <grin> ... and the VETLink #?
BBS, each carrying the VETNet echoes, important veteran text files
and many issues of NamVet, became truly a LINKing of the proud
VETerans of our nation - with each new VETLink BBS adding a new
and sometimes colorful hue to the word VETERAN. (VETLink's 4 and
5 will soon be adding special and unique echoes to the VETNet
echoes)

Once upon a long time ago on a cold and quiet Wyoming night, a
computer-using veteran tap-tap-tapped out a message on his
keyboard to another veteran who "understood" and "talked the same
language" into an echo called VIETNAM_VETS --

...and his brothers and sisters, in an electronic way, have
answered the call!

FidoNews 8-38                  Page 13                     23 Sep 1991


The MORAL of this story? "Ya ain't alone, brother and sister
veteran! If you wanna talk to a brother/sister veteran or you
need veteran benefit information or want to find out about a
reunion or try to find out about a veteran you've lost contact
with, or anything else veteran-related, pop into the VIETNAM_VETS
echo or call a VETLink near you. If there ISN'T one, think about
BEING one... or ask your friendly SysOp about VETLink!!!"

                       'til next time
                Show a brother or sister veteran
                        That YOU care!!!
       and we might ALL "live happily ever after" <smilez>

                  by Aaron Goldblatt (1:130/32.1@fidonet)
      Development Manager: Will Schlichtman (1:350/59.0@fidonet)
                           September 14, 1991

This week we begin the release of Version 3.2 of the Fort Worth Nodelist
format.  Because it has been completely rewritten and expanded it is
necessary to break into chunks to fit within FidoNews guidelines.  This
was somewhat tricky, so the decision was made to make it as close to 10k
as possible, while not breaking up sections.

Versions 3.0 and 3.1 were never released.  They were developmental
versions only, seen by Aaron Goldblatt and Will Schlichtman in the
development of their Fort Worth Nodelist conversion program.

Certain portions of this document have been deleted.  The whole thing is
an FSC-style document, and much of the verbage that goes into one can be
dropped for FidoNews.  Other portions have been edited slightly for
verbage, but the ideas expressed remain unaltered.

This week we begin with an overview of the nodelist format and its
individual fields.  Next week we will define each field in detail.
The last week we will define the optional files and difference files,
and we will give a numerical analysis of the space savings of the Fort
Worth Format over the St. Louis Format nodelist.

So, without further ado . . .
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
1.0 Overview
------------
This document defines the format and content of the nodelist for the
FidoNet Network (FidoNet) as published each Friday.

The nodelist is published as an ASCII text file named NODELIST.nnn,
where nnn is the day-of-year of the Friday publication date.

One companion file, CITYLIST.nnn, contains optional data which an
individual sysop may choose to use, or may not to. CITYLIST.nnn contains
the city and state (or city and country) location of each node.
This companion file is also an ASCII text file.

NODELIST and CITYLIST SYSLIST contain two kinds of lines, comment lines
and data lines. Each line is terminated with an ASCII CR/LF pair
without extra white space.  The file is terminated with an end-of-file
character (EOF = decimal character value 26).

Comments lines contain a semicolon (;) in the first character position
followed by zero or more alphabetic characters called "interest flags".
The remainder of a comment line (with one exception, treated below) is
free-form ASCII text.  There are five interest flags defined as follows:

     [Several paragraphs have been deleted from the FidoNews article.
     They cover:

           o Comment flags
           o CRC notation
           o CRC checks
           o Definition of "alphanumeric character" as any ASCII
                character between hex 20 and 7E

     All of these items remain unchanged from the St. Louis Nodelist.]


2.0 NODELIST.nnn
----------------
The following discussion is of the 12 individual types of nodelist
entries, first the format for each, second a brief definition of each
field, and then a discussion of how each line and field is used.  In
line definitions, an UPPERCASE character is defined as a static,
unchanging character, and lowercase is defined as a variable field
to be filled with alphanumeric characters.

  2.3 Explanations
  ----------------
  Zone  --
      Begins the definition of a geographic zone and defines its
      coordinator.  All the data lines following a line with the "Z" key
      letter down to, but not including, the next occurrence of a "Z"
      keyword, are regions, networks, and nodes within the defined zone.
      All data lines following a line with the "Z" keyword down to, but
      not including, the next occurrence of a "Z", "R", or "N" keyword,
      are Zone Service Nodes (see Zone Service).

  Region --
      Begins the definition of a geographic region and defines its
      coordinator.  All the data lines following a line with the
      "R" keyword down to,  but not including,  the next occurrence
      of a "Z",  "R",  or "N" keyword, are independent nodes within
      the defined region (see Region Independants).

  Net --
      Begins the definition of a local network and defines its
      coordinator.  All the data lines following a line with the "N"
      keyword down to, but not including, the next occurrence of a "Z",
      "R", or "N" keyword, are local nodes, members of the defined
      local network.

  Hub --
      Begins the definition of a routing subunit within a multilevel
      local network.  The hub is the routing focal point for nodes
      listed below it until the next occurrence of a "Z", "R", "N",
      or "H" keyword.  The hub entry MUST be a redundant entry, with
      a unique number, for one of the nodes listed below it.  This
      is necessary because some nodelist processors eliminate these
      entries in all but the local network.

  Hub Override --
      Same as Hub, except that it allows nets to span area codes using a
      hub-based routing system.  If an area code-based routing system does
      not exist in a given Net, a Net may still span area codes by adding
      a null Hub Override field, in the following format:

       U,NUL,ac

  Phone Override --
      Same as a normal entry (below), except that it allows an individual
      node to exist outside the normal area code of an individual net.

  Normal Entry --
FidoNews 8-38                  Page 17                     23 Sep 1991


      Defines the "standard" member of FidoNet.  All other nodelist lines
      are based on this one.  Any node meeting the minimum requirements
      for membership in FidoNet as defined in FTS-0001 and current
      policy may use this line.

  Private --
      Defines a private node with unlisted number.  Private nodes
      are only allowed as members of local networks.

  Down --
      Defines a node which is not operational.  Mail may NOT be sent to
      it.  This keyword may not be used for longer than a period to be
      defined by FidoNet policy, at which point the node is to be removed
      from the nodelist.

  Keep --
      Defines a node which is temporarily down.  Mail may be sent to
      it and is held by its host or coordinator.

  Zone Service --
      Defines a node which is not part of any Region or Zone.  These may
      be duplicate addresses ONLY.  For example, the FidoNews Editor,
      1:1/1, is a Zone 1 Service node, while NotiFido, 4:4/4, is a Zone 4
      Service node.  The Net number is the same as the Zone number.

  Region Independant --
      Defines a node which is not part of any local area Net, but is still
      part of FidoNet and communicates with the rest of it.

Information On The Animal Rights Conference

When you mention "animal rights" to many people, you immediately start
getting some pretty strange looks from them.  Much of the reason for
this is that the only impression that many people have of those who are
interested in animal rights and welfare is based upon the various
reports which hit the news media.  For the most part, those news reports
have been negative in nature, detailing break-ins at animal research
facilities, attacks on those involved in the production and selling of
meat, and attempts to impede hunters.  The reports generally don't tell
of the people who are involved in working with animal shelters to adopt
out unwanted and abandoned pets.  They generally don't detail the
efforts of those who are working positively towards alternatives to
using animals in medical research.  They don't tell of the many people
FidoNews 8-38                  Page 18                     23 Sep 1991


who volunteer their time and talents to work with injured animals.

The ANIMAL_RIGHTS conference was designed by its originator, Doris
Marsh, to serve as a means of spreading information about the positive
aspects of the animal rights movement.  She explicitly invited those
with differing opinions to come into the conference to discuss both the
pro and con aspects of "animal rights," and that was a pretty bold thing
to do considering the emotional involvement that many people have on
both sides of the issue.

I became involved in the conference virtually by accident.  One of the
callers on my bulletin board was closely involved with animal rights,
and when she said that she was having to call long distance to
participate in the echo, I started looking for it.  Fortunately, it was
on the BackBone, so it was a relatively easy process to pick it up.
What I saw as a favor for a local caller soon turned into an interesting
experience for me.  I started reading the messages, and I started
getting involved with the discussions which were going on.  From the
beginning, it was obvious to me that there were radicals on both sides
of the issue, but I was increasingly impressed with those who were able
to express their interests without giving in to the emotion of the
moment.

In the months I've been involved in the echo, discussions have ranged
from simple announcements of sources for animal rights material to
knock-down drag-out fights regarding the mere concept of attributing
"rights" to animals.  While we always welcome the former, we are working
to discourage the latter because they're always unproductive.  Everyone
is encouraged to speak their minds, to express their thoughts and to
debate the concepts put forward by others in the conference.  The
conference rules have recently been revamped to start restricting the
number of personal attacks and off-topic messages.  Since then, message
traffic has increased considerably, and a great deal of positive
information is being passed back and forth.

Whatever your stand on the issue of animal rights (or animal respect as
I have come to call it recently), you're welcome to participate in the
echo and express yourself.  We want every side of the issue to be
discussed freely and openly, and the primary restrictions are that no
one is to make a personal attack on another participant of the echo and
off-topic messages are to be held to an absolute minimum.

If you're interested in the echo, it can be picked up from the BackBone.
Netmail requests for information may be made to either Doris or myself
as shown below:

Mike Adams, Animal_Rights Moderator at 1:19/10
Doris Marsh, Animal_Rights Co-Moderator at 1:125/20

We're looking forward to increased participation in the conference and
the "polite" discussion of the issues involved in animal rights.
