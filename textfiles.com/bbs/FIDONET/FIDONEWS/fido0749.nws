                     STRETCHING THE TRUTH IN PRINT

     I've said it before... it's my belief that FidoNews should not
     be the vehicle for articles on all sorts of "issues of the
     day."  Apparently the current editor disagrees with me, though,
     and his opinion is the one that counts.

     All right.  Here's some help for those of us who have to sit
     and read all of this and wonder if we are getting straight news
     or pure propaganda, or something in between.  I'm going to ask
     you to spend a few moments of your time and fifteen cents on a
     postcard (maybe a bit more if you're outside of the U.S.A.) to
     request a reprint of some articles that show how media bias can
     creep into news reporting.  It shows, among other things, how
     certain words or phrases can be (and have been) used or avoided
     in order to influence public opinion, all under the guise of
     objective reporting.

     Right about now you may be thinking "I suppose he's going to
     ask me to write to some ultra-conservative group or some
     abortion rights organization to get their slant on media bias"
     (especially if you've read some of my previous comments in
     FidoNews).  But if I did that, you'd immediately dismiss it as
     the writings of some fringe group that you don't agree with
     anyway.  Sorry, but if that's what you were thinking, I'm
     afraid I'm going to disappoint you.  Instead, I'm going to ask
     you to write to that great ultra-conservative(?) publication,
     the (ahem) Los Angeles Times.

     You see, a reporter named David Shaw wrote a series of articles
     for the L.A. Times that detailed how media bias has seeped into
     the reporting of the abortion issue.  Now you may say "my mind
     is already made up on abortion", but that's not what these
     articles are really all about.  Rather, what these articles
     prove is that you can take an issue - really ANY issue - and
     put a slant on your reporting that at first blush seems
     objective enough, but that in reality strongly favors one side
     or another.

     Every student of journalism, and anyone who is now employed (or
     hopes to someday be employed) as an editor, a reporter, or in
     some other capacity in the field of journalism would do well to
     read this report.  Keep in mind that it isn't just the abortion
     issue that's often reported in a biased manner.  Reporters take
     up all sorts of causes, and can inadvertently inject their own
     beliefs and values into what they report.  Editors can edit
     stories to reflect a particular viewpoint, or can decline to
     run stories favorable to one side or the other.  If they can do
     it with the issue of abortion, they can do it with a cause near

          Responses, decentralization, the USA, cards, and koans.

     Wow.

     I wasn't quite expecting this reaction.

     Well, I was in a way: I thought that nobody in Zone 3 would
     comment, because they never read FidoNews, and I was absolutely
     right on that one.

     Instead, I've got someone from Zone 4 telling me how much of a
     reaction my article got down there! And that nice Mr K Bychin
     said some stuff that caught my mind.

                       ______________________________

                       To: all those doods in Zone 1.
                       ______________________________

        (and none of these "it's spelt `dude'" complaints, either:-)

     In Zone 1, I get the distinct impression that the host calls out
     to all of the nodes to do the mail session, right? Wierd. I guess
     you have the option of doing that, since you have free local
     calls. Sure, the "local calls" area is the size of a peanut, but
     they're free, right?

     I think I've just realised why a lot of Z1 nethosts don't like
     the idea of people switching nets. They've got this odd idea that
     they'd have to make another phone call. This had simply never
     occurred to me.

     Here in Zone 3, (and I guess it happens in 2 and 4..infinity as
     well), we have to pay for our phone calls. All of the nodes call
     the host. We have to juggle things a little to avoid conflicts,
     but apart from when new nodes are introduced, we manage to avoid
     each other pretty damn well. I think we also have a better
     relationship with our Host, since he doesn't have to do
     \everything\.

     Oh yeah: here in N680, and many others, we also pay for our
     echomail. My echomail bill works out at about $5 a week, for
     quite a few echoes, which is just about nothing for the pretty
     damn good service we get. Everyone is happy, especially the host,
     who doesn't have an albatross named "phone bill" around his neck.
     This saves him lots of money, which he keeps spending on hardware
     to make the feed more efficient, the silly fool :-).

     FidoNews 7-49                Page 4                    3 Dec 1990


     You might want to consider it, guys. Take some load off your host
     and make the call from your end. It's pretty damn easy: add a
     single event to your control files, and bingo. The call is, no
     doubt, free for you as well, so it's no money off your back.

     Every now and again, estimate your share of the amount of money
     your host is spending on phone bills bringing your favourite
     echoes in, and \send the cash in\. There's some excellent billing
     software out there that figures it all out (at the host's end),
     and makes everything a lot more fair.

     This might, IMHO, make the nethosts feel a little better. It
     might also lead to the dropping of this bloody silly "physical
     location" rule for which net you join, since it's not going to
     add any huge load to the host you switch to.

     Once that's happened, MAYBE FidoNet stands a chance of being
     democratic.

                                    ===

             Decentralization, n: in FidoNet, a damn good idea.

     Ta for the introduction, Vince. As I said, I wasn't quite
     expecting the reaction. No abuse whatsoever. Amazing. :-/

     Back to your idea of lots of domains: if you think the technology
     can handle it, great! You'll have to fix that extremely stupid
     document regulating gateways, though, or all hell will break
     loose. All that needs to be said is "dupe loops are a bad idea,
     and if you're responsible for one, big trouble."

     Technology-wise, I don't think Type 2 is really equipped to
     handle multiple domain work if it's commonplace, at least with
     the current batch of software. For it to be possible, you'd need
     at least for everyone to be running the latest version of the
     software, which is hard enough to do these days.

     [aparrently, there's some *C out there who insists on using a
     not-quite-compatible homebrew mailer, which is creating amazing
     problems with everybody downstream. Of course, they can't switch
     *C, can they? Nor can they vote him out. This is what I'd like to
     see fixed]

     Type 3 software should be seriously looked at. jim's proposal
     needs some modification, but it's basically sound IMHO, and even
     the most lowly Commodore 64 should be able to handle it. The
     wonderful thing about Type 3 would be that we'd be able to drag a
     significant amount of the net up to a respectable level of
     compatibility and effectiveness in a relatively short amount of
     time.

     FidoNews 7-49                Page 5                    3 Dec 1990


     How to introduce it: I'd say you firstly ensure that all Type 3
     software can also handle Type 2 packets and messages. You might
     want to turn that option off, but it'll be there. Then you make
     source for 2<>3 packet/message converters available. Finally, you
     set a date by which all non-leaf nodes MUST convert to Type 3.
     Make it a LONG way in the future, and WELL after we've managed to
     prove that the thing works.

     Setting a date is pretty harsh stuff, but it's (IMHO) the only
     way to work. The non-leaf rule should be pretty obvious: there's
     almost definitely going to be someone running Type 2 software on
     some archaic, uncommon machine, and they won't be good enough at
     programming to port Type 3 over to their machines. All we want to
     do is make sure that they're not routing mail to anyone, since we
     want to make \sure\ that the advantages of Type 3 aren't lost
     because of some diehard Type 2 user stuck in the middle of the
     chain.

     Another method: form another network (entirely type 3), and
     have it slowly take over. You should be able to figure out the
     pros and cons for that one yourself.

     'nuff rambling on this topic. Keep talking, people.

                                    ===

     Tom, you're absolutely correct. The United States government and
     secret services are being absolutely amazingly awful as far as it
     comes to treating your rights, and it's not only in the
     electronic mail arena, either. I'm just glad I'm not in the USA.
     The only thing I can suggest is to get the silent majority up and
     yelling that you want CHANGE. If you don't yell, you should
     expect the rabidly conservative to try and restrict your life to
     the point you can't move. You should also expect them to succeed
     unopposed, since you're all sitting back being quiet.

     I just hope it doesn't happen here in Australia.

                                    ===

     Henry: if you can find a Unix box out there you can play with,
     swap the idle process for one that does your card simulations.
     Also, have it keep track of the maximum and average "$ down"
     amounts. If you can only succeed with $10,000 in your pocket,
     it's no good. I'd love a copy of your source, though.

                                    ===

                                A new koan:

             If you have some ice cream, I will give it to you.

          If you have no ice cream, I will take it away from you.

                          It is an ice cream koan.


                           Thanks for your time.

                            The GhostNET Echo

       Yes, another echo is out, and its called 'GhostNET'.  This new
     echo  is a  serious  attempt at  disscussing  topics relating to
     paranormal  occurences,  Extrasensory Perception, Psychokinesis,
     Psychics,  and  more.  Now that I've got you confused, here  are
     the basic requirements.   It requires  real names and ANSI codes
     are to be stripped.  To recieve this echo, send netmail to Chris
     Mayer  at  1:161/303.  More  details will  be  included  through
     netmail at your request.

                   Killing People Over The Dial-Up Network

     Universal Mayhem  has been  under  heavy  development  since the
     version 2.0 release a  couple of  months ago.  We are,  in fact,
     soon to mail  version 2.3 to every known  Mayhem site as soon as
     some test time  is found.  Known  sites (those  that are  in the
     MAYHEM echo) are:

     128/74 365/47 104/112 151/806  107/540 124/3220 207/204  231/290

     133/110  224/60  100/380 369/26  350/726 102/851  102/833 396/24
     250/726. (8842/0 8842/1 8842/2: my private international nodes).

     If you don't  see your  node listed  when it should  be, now you
     know why you haven't been  getting the echo mail! Give me a call
     and I'll fix it right away.

     There are two known sites  in Germany and  several in Australia;
     only one of which currently receives the MAYHEM echo. The German
     site  that  I  interface  to  is  difficult  to  connect  to and
     generally  requires  many  calls  to  send  a  single  packet. I
     attribute this problem to my long distance carrier line quality.
     Who can say?  Regardless, MAYHEM is now considered international
     in scope.

     There are an estimated 240 sites running Mayhem world-wide. This
     count is computed on the total  File Requests and  File Attaches
     in my log files and the messages and letters received from sites
     I haven't listed above. Israel is running an old 1.5 version and
     will be updated when 2.3 comes out.

     The  several  reported bugs  have been  fixed  though  not fully
     tested. Friendly ships that warp  in  to  assist an  allied ship
     does  not get  fired  on  and  does not  automatically  attack a
     friendly ship anymore.  More importantly, the  export and import
     of ships  (cannon fodder) from other sites finally works and the
     File Attaches now actually works - now that I read the Technical
     document for the message headers attribute field and implemented
     the damn thing.  I should add that Mayhem sites need-not be tied
     to each other to run Mayhem. It's quite acceptable to run Mayhem
     entirely local to a single system.

     There have been  BILLIONS  and  BILLIONS  of  little  fixes  and
     updates  that   are  primarily  'tweakings'  of the  code  after
     suggestions from the various sites were considered. When version
     2.3 is mailed out, a file  briefly listing the updates performed
     will be mail with it.  Speed of  start-up and execution has also
     been worked on and some of the colors made less gaudy.

     FidoNews 7-49                Page 9                    3 Dec 1990


     If you want to try the thing, you can request MAYHEM20.ZIP or it
     would probably  be a better  idea to send  a message  asking for
     version 2.3 when it's tested and  released. If you would like to
     get into the MAYHEM echo,  let me know. I am now down to polling
     all known sites once a week rather than the original three times
     a week  (my wife  threatened to  toss my ass  out along with the
     phone bills if I didn't stop.  I threatened  to stop cooking her
     dinners if I got thrown out -- we compromised.  I'll poll once a
     week and burn a third of her dinners). You can also use the list
     above to find  out what  the closest site that has it is and see
     if it can feed you, of course.

     A Sad Note --  A Software God  here where  I work  has  reported
     seeing  Mayhem version 2.0 being  sold at  a local  swap-meet. I
     have   never   charged   a  cent   for  my   efforts  (I  return
     contributions) and  I don't allow other people to  make money on
     my lost sleep. I  ask that _anyone_ who sees  my work being sold
     to get a name and license  plate number  of the criminal and let
     me know about it; along with any other information  you can come
     up with. Because I don't charge  for the product,  I can't claim
     lost income but I  can sure as  hell launch a  class-action suit
     and  recover  punitive  damages  for  these  people  selling  my
     copywritten software --  it's not  released as  Public Domain or
     into the Public Domain. If I want it sold, I'll do it myself. Be

     NEW ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE: WORLDTLK

     Description and Summary of the WORLDTLK Echo.

     The 'original' UNITEX conference is available now as AreaTag:
     WORLDTLK on the FidoNet backbone.

     The UNITEX echomail conference is changing it's name to WORLDTLK
     and will be revamping its agenda and will include articles from
     other international news agencies and journalists in addition to
     the United Nations Weekly Summaries and other UN news bulletins
     that are of topical interest and concern and have global
     ramifications. All recent UN Resolutions will be posted
     as well as any speeches from Heads of State addressing
     the UN General Assenbly.

     As you will read below, this conference can be both extremely
     informative, from a user or reader's perspective, as well as
     provide a forum and mecahnism for feedback to what has become an
     international and global crisis: The Situation in the Gulf.  The
     United Nations, now more than ever, is taking a very active role
     in World Affairs and this conference can, in a 'real sense' be a
     WORLD TALK forum with a political reality.  It is necessary to
     know what is going on from a source level.  The televison and
     press media can only cover a certain perspective. This
     conference will bring you articles and news covewrage not
     usually seen in our media.

     WORLDTLK is NOT a read-only conference but there are certain
     guidelines and protocols that will be published from time to
     time as Conference Rules.  The WORLDTLK Moderator is Dr. James
     Waldron 1;107/501.  Co-moderators are Esty Dinur and Jeff
     Laranger both at 1:121/99 User postings, especially of the
     journalistic variety, are welcome.  Try to stay on topic with
     the current trend of subject headers.  Inquiries, thoughtful or
     provocative questions, and other related news articles will be
     answered by the WorldTlk Moderators or online readers.

     Postings by other agencies, such as the Wind Energy Forum,
     Audobon or the Sierra Club are certainly welcome on the
     environmental topics, as are postings by World Perspectives on
     the international political scene.

     Articles will range from UN Security Council Resolutions and UN
     Press Releases to international news on the environment, The
     UNCED (UN Conference for Environmental Development), Laws of the
     Sea, Treaty and Boundary Agreements, the Crisis in the Gulf,
     weekly summaries of the UN General Assembly and timely
     publications from other international and independent press
     associations.  The United Nations news will be posted by UNITEX
     Communications.

     Other issues include: current developments and economic trends
     in the European Economic Community (EEC), Human Rights, peaceful
     and safe utilization of atomic energy, reports from the World
     Bank, World Health Organization, Africa, Central & Latin
     America, and several other areas of concern facing the
     developing nations.

     The idea is to present several authoratative views of current
     news crisis and trends via real 'hard news' and professional
     journalism using varying international sources, including news
     briefings from the United Nations and other governmental
     agencies and have a forum for readers to reply to and ask
     questions.  The topics will vary depending on the current world
     political situation, among other things.

     If you are a sysop and are reading this it would be appreciated
     to pass this information on to your readers.  If you want to
     link into WORLDTLK and have echomail link(s) already in place
     for UNITEX, simply change the name from UNITEX to WORLDTLK and
     retain all the links.

     If you are new to this conference, simply add the Areatag:
     WORLDTLK to your areas.bbs and ask for a link from your NEC or
     HEC, as this is a FidoNet backbone confernce.

     If you need more information about the conference or the
     background and history of UNIETX (re: talks or papers UNITEX
     presented at the United Nations), FileReq UNITEX.ZIP from
     1:107/501. In addition, It describes the UNITEX Project that
     began in 1983 as an experimental pilot-project for dissemination
     of specialized information using wide-area network technology.
