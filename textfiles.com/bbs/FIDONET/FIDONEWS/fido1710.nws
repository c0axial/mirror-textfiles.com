                         The Shape of Things to Come

     Just when it seems like Fido is falling apart, forces gather which
     promise new life.  Such is the power I feel coming together in the
     discussions in the echo FN_SYSOP.  It's an unruly discussion,
     spilling over to other echoes and bearing concepts which have been
     argued for years.  It's a debate over whether Fido should revert to
     the anarchy on which it was founded, or the "top-down" authority
     represented by the coordinator structure and embodied in Fido's
     Policy 4.

     Though the debate has raged for years with no particular sweeping
     changes resulting, what seems different this time is that the
     opposing sides seem to be working together rather than just spouting
     rhetoric.  What began as yet another attempt to rewrite policy has
     developed into a discussion on guidelines.  The theory is that the
     guidelines would be non-binding in the sense that individual sysops
     would be able to use the traditional solutions developed in the
     guidelines, but would have the flexibility to work out unique
     solutions between themselves.

     Is there a middle ground between anarchy and authority?  This
     observer doesn't know if this will come to pass... but this
     discussion seems like the best shot in a long time.  Keep talking,
     folks!

     =================================================================


                            Advice on Holding Back

     This was written by Renee Deutel, an 83 year old women, to her
     friend:

     I'm reading more and dusting less.  I'm sitting in the yard and
     admiring the view without fussing about the weeds in the garden.
     I'm spending more time with my family and friends and less time
     working. Whenever possible, life should be a pattern of experiences
     to savor, not to endure.  I'm trying to recognize these moments now
     and cherish them.

     I'm not "saving" anything; we use our good china and crystal for
     every special event such as losing a pound, getting the sink
     unstopped, or the first Amaryllis blossom.  I wear my good blazer to
     the market.  My theory is if I look prosperous, I can shell out
     $28.49 for one small bag of groceries.

     I'm not saving my good perfume for special parties, but wearing it
     for clerks in the hardware store and tellers at the bank. "Someday"
     and "one of these days" are losing their grip on my vocabulary. If
     it's worth seeing or hearing or doing, I want to see and hear and do
     it now.

     I'm not sure what others would've done had they known that they
     wouldn't be here for the tomorrow that we all take for granted.  I
     think they would have called family members and a few close friends.
     They might have called a few former friends to apologize and mend
     fences for past squabbles.  I like to think they would have gone out
     for a Chinese dinner, or for whatever their favorite food was.  I'm
     guessing; I'll never know.

     It's those little things left undone that would make me angry if I
     knew my hours were limited.  Angry because I hadn't written certain
     letters that I intended to write one of these days.  Angry and sorry
     that I didn't tell my husband and parents often enough how much I
     truly love them.

     I'm trying very hard not to put off, hold back, or save anything
     that would add laughter and luster to our lives.  And every morning
     when I open my eyes, tell myself that it is special.  Every day,
     every minute, every breath truly is a gift from God.

     "People say true friends must always hold hands, but true friends
     don't need to hold hands because they know the other hand will
     always be there."

     I don't only believe in miracles.  I rely on them.

                                Fifties Quotes
                                    Ol'WDB

      AMAZING! Here are some quotes from people in the US during the
      1950's.

      1).  "I'll tell you one thing, if things keep going the way they
           are, its' going to be impossible to buy a weeks groceries for
           $20."

      2)   "Have you seen the new cars coming out next year? It won't be
           long when $5000 will only buy a used one."

      3).  "If cigarettes keep going up in price,   I'm going to quit. A
           quarter a pack is ridiculous."

      4).  "Did you hear the post office is thinking about charging dime
           just to mail a letter?"

      5).  "The Government is wanting to get its hands on everything.
           Pretty soon it's going to be impossible to run a family
           business or farm."

      6).  "If they raise the minimum wage to $1, nobody will be able to
           hire outside help at the store."

      7).  "When I first started driving, who would have thought gas
           would someday cost 50 cents a gallon. Guess we'd be better off
           leaving the car in the garage."

      8).  "Kids today are impossible. Those duck tail hair cuts make it
           impossible to stay groomed. Next thing you know, boys will be
           wearing their hair as long as the girls."

      9).  "Also, their music drives me wild. This `Rock Around The
           Clock` thing is nothing but racket."

      10). "I'm afraid to send my kids to the movies any more. Ever since
            they let Clark Gable get by with saying `damn` in `Gone With
            The Wind,it seems every movie has a `hell` or`damn in it."

     11). "Also, it won't be long until couples are sleeping in the same
          bed in the movies. What is this world coming to?"

     12). "Marilyn Monroe is now showing her bra and panties, so
          apparently there are no standards anymore."

     13). "Pretty soon you won't be able to buy a good 10 cent cigar."

     14). "I read the other day where some scientist thinks it's possible
          to put a man on the moon by the end of the of the century. They
     FIDONEWS 17-10               Page 4                    6 Mar 2000


          even have some fellows they call astronauts preparing for it
          down in Texas."

     15). "Did you see where some baseball player just signed a contract
          for $75,000 a year just to play ball? It wouldn't surprise me
          if someday they'll be making more than the president."

     16). "Do you suppose television will ever reach our part of the
           country?"

     17). "I never thought I'd see the day all our kitchen appliances
          would be electric. They are even making electric typewriters
          now."

     18). "It's too bad things are so tough nowadays. I see where a few
          married women are having to work to make ends meet."

     19). "It won't be long before young couples are going to have to
          hire someone to watch their kids so they can both work."

     20). "Marriage doesn't mean a thing anymore, those Hollywood stars
          seem to  be getting divorced at the drop of a hat."

     21). "I'll tell you one thing. If my kid ever talks back to me, they
           won't be able to sit down for a week."

     22). "Did you know the new church in town is allowing women to wear
          slacks to their service?"

      23). "Next thing you know is, the government will start paying us
           not to  grow crops."

      24). "I'm just afraid the Volkswagen car is going to open the door
           to a whole lot of foreign business."

     25). "Thank goodness I won't live to see the day when the Government
          takes half our income in taxes. I sometimes wonder if we are
          electing the best people to congress."

     26). "Why in the world would you want to send your daughter to
          college? Isn't she going to get married? It would be different
          if she could be a doctor or a lawyer."

     27). "I just hate to see the young people smoking. As I tell my
          kids, "Don't take a cigarette from ANYONE. You never know what
          might be in it."

     28). The drive-in restaurant is convenient in nice weather, but I
          seriously  doubt they will ever catch on."

     29). "There is no sense going to Lincoln or Omaha anymore for a
          weekend. It costs nearly $15 a night to stay in a hotel."

     30). "Anymore no one can afford to be sick, $35 a day in the
          hospital is too rich for my blood."

     FIDONEWS 17-10               Page 5                    6 Mar 2000


     31). "If a few idiots want to risk their necks flying across the
           country that's fine, but nothing will ever replace trains."

     32). "I don't know about you but if they raise the price of coffee
          to 15 cents, I'll just have to drink mine at home."

     33). "If they think I'll pay 50 cents for a hair cut, forget it.
          I'll have my wife learn to cut hair."

     34). "We won't be going out much anymore. Our baby sitter informed
          us she wants 50 cents an hour. Kids think money grows on
          trees."

     35). "Cars which dim their lights by sensors, automatic
          transmissions, and who knows what else? Pretty soon they will
          drive themselves."

     No it wasn't so long ago!!!

                             This Weeks Web Page
                                by Frank Vest
                                1:124/6308(.1)

     Got an E-Mail pointing out this web page to me. Thought it was great
     to get a suggestion of a page to add to the links on my page and
     decided to feature the suggested page this week. It was nice to find
     a BBS related web page without having to go search. :)


     What: TheLitterBox
     Where: http://www.thelitterbox.org/

     Here it is:

     This page will fool you. At first glance, it looks like another
     Internet BBS. Of course, that is part of the site. Directly below
     the cartoon picture (drawing) of a cat behind a computer screen is a
     "Login" option. This will take you to a new page to log onto the BBS
     via HTML with options for how you want to participate in the BBS. I
     tried the log in and it didn't work for me. I read on down and found
     that there is a problem with the HTML log in and new users. The
     solution is to login via Telnet and then the HTML will work the next
     time you try it. It did work and I logged in via HTML. The BBS is
     run on BBBS and seems to work well via Telnet and HTML. I didn't get
     into the message areas much, but there are plenty of them from what
     I saw.

     Ok, back to the page itself. I said the page would fool you... Under
     the "Login" option is a couple of links about cats. Being that this
     is a page for the "Litterbox", that would seem right. :) Check out
     "Toby's Memorial". It will touch you in many ways if you are an
     animal lover or sentimental.
     FIDONEWS 17-10               Page 6                    6 Mar 2000


     I'll say again. you will be fooled if you don't look this page over.
     Going on down, you find a section marked "Supporting Memberships and
     Affliliations". At first glance, you might think this is sponsors
     and move on.  !STOP!  Look at the spinning word "Fidonet". Click on
     it. Look the page that comes up over. What a wealth of information!
     From the top, which has both the ASCII and a graphic of the Fidonet
     dog, to the bottom are archives and information about BBSing and
     Fidonet.

     Now, if you ever wade through all the information on the "Fidonet"
     page, go back and try the other links. :)

     On a side note... I'd like to thank the person that pointed me to
     this page and got me to take another look. I had found this page
     before and never got past the assumption that it was "Just a page
     about cats" that had a HTML BBS. I'll not mention a name since it
     was an E-Mail, but... Thank you very much!

     Drop in on this page when you have some time to kill or even if you
     don't. Get past the first impression and look into the page. It's
     worth it!

     With kind regards,

      Frank, flv@texoma.net

     Before going to Europe on business, a man drove his Rolls-Royce to a
     downtown New York City bank and went in to ask for an immediate loan
     of $5,000.

      The loan officer, taken aback, requested collateral and so the man
     said, "Well then, here are the keys to my Rolls-Royce."

      The loan officer promptly had the car driven into the bank's under-
     ground parking for safe keeping, and gave him $5,000.

      Two weeks later, the man walked through the bank's doors, and asked
     to settle up his loan and get his car back.

      "That will be $5,000 in principal, and $15.40 in interest", the
     loan officer said.

      The man wrote out a check and started to walk away.

      "Wait sir", the loan officer said, "while you were gone, I found
     out you are a millionaire. Why in the world would you need to borrow
     $5,000?"

      The man smiled. "Where else could I park my Rolls-Royce in
     Manhattan for two weeks and pay only $15.40?
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Moral of this story is "Don't work for your banker, work with him!"

                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     A man came walking up to the house when he noticed his grandfather
     sitting on the porch, in the rocking chair, with nothing on from the
     waist down.

     "Grandpa, what are you doing?" he exclaimed.  The old man looked off
     in the distance without answering.

     "Grandpa, what are you doing sitting out here with nothing on below
     the waist?" he asked again.

     The old man slowly looked at him and said, "Well, last week I sat
     out here with no shirt on, and I got a stiff neck.  This is your
