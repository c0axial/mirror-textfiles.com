                         Some Thoughts on Standards

     If the FTSC ever publishes a standard  on  how  to  do  echomail,
     ARCmail,  FOSSIL  drivers,  etc.  I'll  pay  attention,  but am I
     supposed to make a big deal out of any random group that meets at
     a wide spot in the road?

     There  are  at  present  something  like three thousand sysops in
     FidoNet.  Probably three hundred of  them  either  now  do,  have
     done,  or  intend  to  do  network  software  -- and nobody knows
     exactly which three hundred.  No,  we don't really intend to keep
     all  three  thousand  (or  even  three hundred) informed of every
     little change that we  may  or  may  not  make  to  every  little
     program,  nor do we expect them to keep us informed.  In  theory,
     at least, this is why you have a standards committee.  We have no
     objection  to  providing input to said committee on any technical
     topic that it may wish to consider,  but I don't see how  SEA  or
     anyone else is bound to do any more than that.

     If  you  let your standards committee do what it was meant to do,
     then you will reap the benefits.  But if you  hobble  it,  thwart
     it,  or forbid it to act,  then you will be (are) at the mercy of
     the natural "market forces" in your network.

     An excellent current example of this is  echomail.  None  of  you
     will  allow  your  standards committee to establish any standards
     relating to echomail.  Thus you are all at the potential mercy of
     any developer who comes up with a new wrinkle, twist,  or feature
     that  might be in demand,  even though it may break your existing
     systems.  An actual example from your past  is  the  whole  Yahoo
     experiment,  which  broke  many  systems in the name of perceived
     features.  Fortunately that is behind you now,  but many  of  you
     have yet to assimilate the lessons of it.

     I've  gotten  a  few  people  upset  by referring to FidoNet as a
     "mature technology".  Those of you who would dearly love to "play
     games" with  the  protocols  (like  the  late,  unlamented  Yahoo
     experiment)  rail at that designation,  but in few (if any) cases
     have I been allowed to explain.  By "mature" I mean that it is no
     longer solely (or even mainly) a province of the hackers.  Few on
     your network either know or care how the stuff  works.  All  they
     care  about  is  that  it does.  And THAT is the true strength of
     your network, if you would only realized it.  A percent or two of
     performance,  or a widget or two that maybe three  out  of  three
     thousand  will  use,  is  of little import compared to the mighty
     throng to whom your network is a powerful tool for COMMUNICATION.
     It is for them that Tom Jennings,  Randy  Bush,  Ben  Baker,  and
     myself saw the need for a standards committee,  because for THEIR

     needs stability is more important than widgets.

              The IEEE Port CD-ROM at 1:107/233  516-757-9469


          As of March 16th 1987, the entire PC-SIG  705 disk library
     of public-domain and shareware programs is on-line at the IEEE
     Port (1:107/233).  This has been done through the sponsorship of
     the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) which
     has provided a Philips CM 100 CD-ROM player and the PC-SIG Disks
     1-705 CD-ROM.

          We have established a somewhat convoluted procedure for
     gaining access to the over  700 directories on the PC-SIG CD-ROM
     disk.  This process is described below and is also readable on-
     line at The IEEE Port.

          The files listed below are file requestable 24hrs from
     1:107/233.  They are the ARCed Tables of Contents of the various
     disks.  Note that because all these files are ARCed you are
     required to first download each of them to your own disk and
     unARC them.  Once you have done this, you may search for
     occurrences of any particular string in the Tables of Contents
     with one of these commands:

                         DFIND "string"
                         FFIND "string" outfile.nam


          where "string" is the value for which you wish to search.
          DFIND will display the results directly on the screen,
          whereas FFIND will write the output of the search to a disk
          file which you may  subsequently search manually with  an
          editor or list program.

                   PC-SIG LIBRARY - Disk Access Procedure
     FidoNews 5-11                Page 4                   14 Mar 1988


          When you log on to the IEEE Port (300/1200/2400) (no pre-
     registration is required) type "F" from the main menu to get to
     the files area.  The procedure to select which particular disk is
     started in area 16 by typing "F".   You will be given a menu that
     looks like this:



      Enter   I - To get information on what files and programs are
                    available.
              D - To get information on addressing a particular disk
                    from the PC-SIG Library and then to select a disk.
              S - I've seen it all before, let's just select a disk!
              C - Explain the use of SEAlink protocol for downloading
                    a disk.

              Q - Quit.

     I highly recommend option "C" for those who do not use SEAlink in
     some form or another.  It will save you a lot of time and typing.

          Since you have the instructions here type "S" to select the
     disk you wish to DL from.  You will be prompted to enter the
     number of the PC-SIG disk you wish to access.  Type the numbers
     as three whole numbers (i.e.  to select disk 49 type "049").  You
     will then be informed that you selection has gone thru and to
     proceed to files area 99.  In order to actually the access the
     PC-SIG disk that you selected you will have to transfer to file
     area 99.  This area does not appear in the list of areas
     maintained by OPUS; that's OK, just use the A99 to go there
     anyway.  Area 99 area will be pointing to the PC-SIG disk you
     select.

          Before OPUS will let you in to area 99 you must enter the
     access code "PCSIG".  Although you won't be able to use the F(ile
     List) command here, you will be able to use the R(aw Directory)
     display to see the names of all the files on the selected disk.
     You may then download any file(s) as you normally would from any
     file area, the only difference being that you will be DLing from
     a subdirectory of the CD-ROM.

          Usually there is a file named DISK###.TXT on each PC-SIG
     disk so if you select disk 694, use the T(ype) command to list
     out DISK694.TXT and get a descriptive file listing of the
     selected disk.

          I run SEAdog 4.11 on top of Opus 1.03a on an original IBM XT
     with 2 ST 225s.  A Zoom Short 2400 baud modem (internal) and a
     Philips CM 100 CD-ROM Player.  If you have any questions or
     suggestions I am reachable at 1:107/233.  As DLing disks from the
     CDROM can be quite expensive over the phone line, I am more than
     willing to fill any disk that is sent to me with whatever disks
     you request.  Please include return postage.

     By Gene Coppola 107/246

         Some VERY Exciting things are happening to GLIB and
     its loyal users!

     I.  What's New

         The first and most obvious is the size of GLIB 1.4!
     The library now has 90 routines available for use including
     COMPLETE mouse and DOS level file control. This is about
     50% more than in GLIB 1.31 and puts it on a par with some
     of the expensive commercial libraries.  And, many of the
     GLIB routines run adequately under OS/2!

     A. FUNCTIONS in Assembler!

         This allows you to evaluate a subroutine as an
     expression or assign the result in fewer lines of code!
     For example:
         OLD:   CALL exist("foo.bar", ExistFlag)
                IF ExistFlag THEN
                  .. <statements>..

         NEW:   IF exist("foo.bar") THEN
                  .. <statements>..

         This lends itself to a number of advantages: code
     is smaller, more easy to read, makes more sense and so
     forth. All it requires is a simple DECLARE statement at
     the start of your code. Even this is made simple with the
     GLIB14.INC file you should have.

     B. DOS Level File Functions:

         GLIB 1.4 now supports complete file access via DOS
     Functions. In so doing, you can completely avoid those
     annoying runtime errors by letting DOS return you an error
     code, rather than an error!

     C. Mouse support.

         We now have a considerable number of routines
     added for mouse support, including cursor control, mouse
     work area restrictions, mouse sensitivity (Mickey Factor).
     These have been tested on the new Micro-soft (dove bar)
     mouse, the Logitech mouse and the Mouse Systems mouse.
         All seem to work fine except the Mouse Systems seemed
     to need a explicit call to set the cursor mask, so we
     have one which is called MSETCSR.

     D. OVER FORTY new routines !!!

     DAYOFYR  -  Gets current day of the year (1- 366).
     DLIGHT   -  Trigger a floppy disk light on.
     FCOPY    -  Copy a file, as quickly as DOS.
     FCREAT   -  Create a new file, returning a File handle.
     FidoNews 5-11                Page 6                   14 Mar 1988


     FEOF     -  Set file pointer to the end of a file.
     FOPEN    -  Open a disk file, getting a DOS file handle.
     FUNIQ    -  Create a unique/temporary file.
     FWRITE   -  Write a string to a file opened with a DOS handle.
     GETCH    -  Allow input from predefined string.
     GET/SET FATTR -  Get, set or reset file attributes.
     GET/SET DRV   -  Get or set the default drive.
     INCR / DECR   -  Replicate 2 TURBO BASIC functions
     INSON/INSOFF  -  Toggle insert state on or off
     KBLOOP   -  Old routine with syntax change.
     LASTDRV  -  Return last logical drive on the system
     LCOUNT   -  Count the number of lines in a file QUICKLY.
     LNAMEF   -  Swap names to last-name-firstformat.
     MCSRINC/MCSRDEC -  Decrement mouse cursor flag
     MCSRON/MCSROFF  -  Mouse cursor on or off.
     MGETXY    -  Get mouse cursor location
     MLONG /MNORM  -  Set / reset mouse Mickey Factor.
     MPRESS    -  Get number of mouse button presses.
     MRELEASE  -  Get number of mouse button releases.
     MSETXY    -  Set mouse cursor location
     MSETXRNG / MSETYRNG: Define/limit mouse work area.
     MTYPE     -  Test for mouse existence.
     PGETCH    -  GETCH with cenetered prompt.
     RINSTR    -  Returns LAST position of a char in a string
     READSCRN      -  Quickly read a string from the CRT
                      at current location
     SYSTIME   -  Return system time as integers.
     TFRMAT    -  Old routine with slight syntax change
     VFNAME    -  Test to see if it is a valid filename.
     VIDOFF    -  Turn CRT off.
     VIDON     -  Turn CRT back on.

         These are just the NEW routines listed above!

     E.  Top QB Libraries Team Up Commercially!!!

         An agreement has been reached between Roy Barrows
     of Project X Development Group and myself to merge our two
     respective QuickBASIC libraries and market them under PROJECT
     X's QBTOOLS/2.1.

         By adding about 80% of the routines in  GLIB (the
     balance being duplicates) to QBTOOLS/2 as well as an
     additional 14 or 15 I wrote up just for the occasion, the
     number of callable routines in QBTOOLS/2.1 soars to
     over 220!

         This is not a decision I made lightly.  There were
     once 4 BBS distributed QB add on libraries and this is the
     last to move to the commercial arena. After very careful
     examination, it became clear that QBTOOLS and Roy ARE the
     type of product and person that I have no compunction
     about becoming associated with. QBTOOLS is quite genuinely
     innovative and Roy is a gifted programmer, one look at
     OSG (Screen Code Generator) will confirm that!

     FidoNews 5-11                Page 7                   14 Mar 1988


         With over 220 routines, at $69.95, QBTOOLS is
     undoubtedly the best value for the dollar in after market
     add on libraries at only .36c per routine!  But money is
     not the only factor, because with QBTOOLS you get 220
     WORKING routines.

         Not only that, but you get a couple of the most
     innovative QB developers utilities including OSG,
     the Object Code Screen Generator, a source code
     formatter and a library manager.

         GLIB release 1.40, to be released Saturday Feb 6,
     1988 will be the final BBS type release of GLIB. About
     70 of the 90 routines including the FieldEditor, have
     already been ported to QBTOOLS/2.1 and I will continue
     to develop routines for the QBTOOLS/2.1 library.

         The only conversion involved is to rename the
     routines into longer more descriptive names characteristic
     of the QBTOOLS/2.1 library. This means GLIB users who pick
     up QBTOOLS/2.1 will suffer a minimum of upgrade shock and
     still benefit from the many, many more routines available
     in QBTOOLS/2.1.  We will also be including an ALIAS file so
     that longtime users of GLIB can use QBTOOLS with the
     new/long names or the old/short names.

         While there will be no further releases of
     InfoSoft's GLIB or DLIB, USERS who register their copy will
     be eligible for a 50% discount on QBTOOLS/2. This offer is
     good only on the 2.xx releases of QBTOOLS since GLIB could
     remain on BBS everywhere forever. We reserve the right to
     alter, modify, extend or revoke this offer upon the release
     of version 3.0. So, once you get QBTOOLS at $39.95, your cost
     plummets to a paltry .18c per routine.  But, you don't
     get the discount by reading this but by registering your copy
     of GLIB 1.4.

         PLEASE!

         o DO NOT attempt to register GLIB with PROJECT X, use
           the mailer enclosed to register GLIB, and your name
           will be forwarded.

         o If you do NOT register GLIB, you do NOT get the
           special 50% discount on QBTOOLS.

         o DO NOT call Project X for GLIB support.  I support
           GLIB via The Information Booth at 316 684 8744.

                   IDEAS FOR A NEW -AND BETTER- FIDONET
                       (Let's make some changes...)

            Time goes by and the FidoNet grows faster every day.
     I don't think that, when creating the Fido Bulletin Board System,
     Tom Jennings knew he was starting something this big.
            I have read lately some articles, where sysops express
     their disagreement regarding the way things are going right now,
     specially with IFNA.
            Some sysops chose to form another, parallel net (like
     Ryugen Fisher, for example), some others just expressed their
     disappointment.
            Thru this article, I want to give you my opinion, and to
     present you a new idea, a new idea that also contains new
     concepts.
            I think something MUST BE DONE, before it is "too late".
            The FidoNet nodelist has already 3000+ members, in all the
     5 continents of the world, in about 30 countries. FidoNet has
     become a totally INTERNATIONAL network, rather than an "American
     one with some nodes overseas".

            THE NEW IDEA I WANT TO PROPOSE IS THE FOLLOWING:

            One "FidoNet Association" is created for each of the 4
     zones (I'm assuming that Latin America will be Zone 4).
            These associations may vary in their internal
     organization, since each zone's requirements and neccesities are
     very different.
            When they are finally established, each designates 3
     members to take part on the International FidoNet Council, that
     is finally formed by those 12 representatives of the 4 zones.
            Each zone has the right to have the Presidency of the
     Council for 6 months a year (each has the right to preside over
     the council once every two years).
            The Council's President must be one of the 4 representatives
     sent by the zone who designates him/her, and has the right to vote
     twice when there is a tied vote.
            The International Council is in charge of various things,
     like designating the International Technical Coordinator, setting
     the technical standards (either directly or by naming a
     "technical committee"), publishing the Net's official newsletter,
     and establishing the Net's basic international rules.
     Comprehensive rules are established by each zone's association.
            The International Council also acts as a "supreme
     tribunal" for interzonal disputes. Any disputes within a zone are
     to be arbitrated by the zone's association.
            The Zonal FidoNet Associations are to be TRANSPARENTLY
     DEMOCRATIC, which ensures the democratic qualities of the
     International FidoNet Council, as well as of the net itself.
            The Zonal Associations have the right to name the
     coordinators for all the networks, regions as well as the zone's.

                 I HOPE YOU'LL HELP SHAPE THIS IDEA:
     FidoNews 5-11                Page 10                  14 Mar 1988


            I personally think this concept still needs to be shaped
     up. The "main idea" puts a special emphasis in democracy,
     as well as on each sysops' right to determine their coordinators,
     authorities and delegates to the main International Council.
            I would like everybody to participate in the development
     of this new idea, to ensure it's representability of all the
     sysop's wishes.
            Please, send mail to node 368/101 (soon-to-be 800/1) with
     your opinions.
            If FidoNet's and IFNA's current authorities consider
     this idea feasible, an echomail conference could be created to
     ensure everybody's participation on the development of this
     new idea.
            Thank you for taking the time to read this article, and
     thanks to IFNA for maintaining a publication where everyone can
     express oneself freely.

     Recently I saw an ad for an LT-286 replacement XT
     motherboard. The price was so low, ($249) that I just
     had to order one.

     I expected to receive a real piece of garbage, but since
     it comes with a 30 day money back warranty, I felt I had
     nothing to lose. The LT-286 is also covered by a 2 year
     warranty as well.

     What I received was a nice surprise. The motherboard
     came packed securely in anti-static plastic, packed with
     peanuts in a heavy shipping container designed to hold
     the motherboard, the manual, and additional memory or
     co-processor chips.

     Upon examination, I found a well designed circuit board
     with no last minute jumpers soldered in. The memory chip
     sockets are placed as far as possible from the 80286
     chip to avoid heat problems.

     This board has been designed to replace the motherboard
     in an XT or clone, and has several features not seen in
     any other replacement board.

     The following VLSI components and subsystems are on the
     motherboard as received and tested.

     1) Intel 80286 microprocessor.
     2) Intel 82284 8Mhz clock generator.
     3) Intel 80287 co-processor (optional).
     4) Intel 8237-5 4 channel DMA controller.
     5) Intel 8255A-5 parallel interface.
     6) Intel 8253-5 timer.
     7) Intel 8259A interrupt controller.
     A) 32k of Read Only Memory, optional to 64k.
     B) One Megabyte of high speed, parity checked RAM.
     C) High performance NO WAIT STATE bus controller.
     D) 16 bit system bus to XT IO bus interface.

     My only complaint with the design is the placement of
     the 80287 chip socket. You will need to remove the
     motherboard to install the 80287 chip at a later date.

     Unlike an XT motherboard, this board has multiple data
     buses. This is the key to understanding the astounding
     speed this board produces. The LT-286 incorporates
     several distinct data buses.

     A) A fast 16-bit bus for the 80286 CPU and 80287 chip.
     B) A fast 16-bit system bus for onboard RAM and EPROM.
     C) A moderately fast 8-bit bus for onboard I/O.
     D) A slow 8-bit expansion bus for offboard I/O.

     The onboard RAM and I/O devices are clocked at the full
     80286 speed using the 16 bit bus. The expansion bus
     interface is clocked at a slower 4.77 Mhz rate. This
     FidoNews 5-11                Page 12                  14 Mar 1988


     zero wait state system runs many times faster than its
     clock speed might suggest to the casual observer who
     naively compares computers by their clock speed.

     My old board (a dual speed NEC V20) was only able to
     accomplish at best a 1.7 on Norton's SI while the LT-286
     registers a 7.7 using the same test.

     Using the new Landmark Speed Test the LT-286 registers
     an 8.8 reflecting the extra speed due to zero wait state
     operation.

     The second reason the LT-286 is so fast is the fact that
     it incorporates a built in disk cache system. When the
     motherboard is fully populated with 1 Megabyte of RAM
     the excess RAM above 640k is used for the disk cache.
     This is a true read/write cache. The only disadvantage
     to this feature is that it takes 8k of main memory. The
     cache can be turned off by changing jumpers on the
     motherboard or by software methods.

     The BIOS is dated September 7, 1987 and displays a
     Copyright by Wave Mate. It is nice to have a recent BIOS
     for a change. It shows that the designers of the LT-286
     are regularly updating their product.

     Before installing the LT-286 make sure you back up any
     hard disks you have installed. Some controllers are very
     sensitive to CPU timing and will require you to format
     again, after you install the LT-286.

     Don't take this statement the wrong way! After I
     installed the board and did a complete format I had no
     problems with the hard disk or the controller.

     Installing the mother board took me about 15 minutes,
     and it should not take you much longer. The longest time
     was spent transferring the RAM chips from my old board.
     The chips sockets on the LT-286 are well designed, but
     it takes considerable effort to insert the RAM chips.
     These sockets certainly will never allow a chip to jar
     loose, and are probably also used in the TEMPEST grade
     system the designers produce.

     The new motherboard was an EXACT fit, and installed with
     no problem what so ever, even though it went into a
     clone and not a pure IBM XT.

     A complete printed manual was included, with an updated
     supplement, but there were no instructions included for
     do-it-yourself installation.

     All the connectors were where they belonged and if you
     inspect the connections BEFORE you remove your board
     you should be able to replace it with no problems. Since
     the LT-286 comes with a 30 day money back warranty and I
     FidoNews 5-11                Page 13                  14 Mar 1988


     run a multi-user bulletin board, the best way to burn in
     this board was to run the BBS on it. So I set up the BBS
     and let it run. I have had no problems to date, and the
     board runs cool and performs well.

     I have had no problem with any software I own. I tested
     the LT-286 with all the standards, including Lotus 123,
     dBase III+, Paradox, Professional Write, and Wordstar.

     Even heavily protected software like PC-TECHNICIAN ran
     with no problems. Due to the fast speed some protected
     software might not run. However since all the major
     software packages are no longer protected, this should
     not present a problem.

     Just to check I installed Lotus from my master disks
     with no problems. dBase III+ also installed with no
     problems. Vault and Prolock protected software installed
     with no problems I could see.

     Customer support is of primary concern, especially to
     someone who might not be comfortable with installing a
     new motherboard. I made up several interesting problems
     and called for technical support. In each case the
     technician was able to diagnose the problem and supply
     the correct answer. Each technician was knowledgeable
     and did not try and rush me off the phone. They spent as
     much time as was needed to work through each problem.

     The LT-286 is a fine product with a good design and good
     technical support. I recommend this to anyone who wants
     to upgrade their PC or XT to a 286 machine.

     In this version their are eight expansion slots which
     are 8-bit slots. This allows you to keep your old
     expansion boards and use them with the LT-286. My Intel
     Above Board, which is notorious for not working with
     high speed systems works quite well. The bus design on
     the LT-286 was designed to allow 8-bit expansion cards
     to perform just like they were still in an 8088 system.

     The LT-286 is really the baby in a fine line of new
     products. Several other motherboards are also available
     with both 8-bit and 16-bit buses, with clock speeds from
     7.2 to 12.5 Mhz.

     I would love to be able to test their top of the line
     16-bit 12.5 Mhz motherboard in my system.

                  Episode 3:  The Programmer's Dictionary


          The  orginal  version of  this  that  I  ever  saw  was in a
     photocopied article from a  magazine  of  some kind.  I therefore
     have no clue as to whom I should be giving credit for the initial
