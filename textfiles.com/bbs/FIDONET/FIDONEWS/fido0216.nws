        are encouraged to submit articles for publication in

        Disclaimer or don't-blame-us:

        The contents of the articles contained here are not our 
        responsibility, nor do we necessarily agree with them; 
        everything here is subject to debate. We publish EVERYTHING

        Multinet Fido is slowly approaching.  The local net hosts 
        and regional coordinators should be receiving a "starter 
        kit" in the mail from St. Louis soon, if you haven't got it 
        already.

        Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker have been busily carving up the 
        country into regions and assigning numbers to them, and I 
        guess they've got it finalized by now.  They also managed to 
        write a couple of articles about all of this, including the 
        promised piece on what it means to be a regional 
        coordinator.

        I wound up in region 13 somehow.  Good thing I'm not 
        superstitious.  Not that it matters much, since I'm really 
        in net 107.  

        You see, the regions only matter to independents.  If I were 
        an independent node, then I'd be in region 13.  But my mail 
        is routed through node 79 in New York, so I'm in his local 
        net, which is net 107.

        If it seems confusing, don't worry about it.  It's mainly 
        just the hosts and coordinators that have to worry about the 
        fine points.  Fido will chug along as always, happily 
        routing mail wherever it belongs, and never bothering the 
        user about how it all works.

        ============================================================
        MIKE HAMILTON                           23 MAY 1985
        SYSOP 313 & 370


        Over the past several months there have been some practices
        which the administrators of the network in southern
        California find very irritating. The item on the top of the
        list is the use of our or any network for commercial
        messages. I don't see why we should stand the cost of the
        messages for someone else's profit. Recently one such node
        was notified that we would no longer receive commercial
        messages, specifically for items for sale. This is
        accomplished by removing them from the accept-from list in
        the routing. This is a drastic step, however repeated
        requetes to stop were not honoured. I'm sure there are
        othere who feel the same way and I would recommend that they
        take the same action. If a commercial user of the network
        wants/needs to advertise then he should follow the same
        practices as the ones in our network and send out messages
        as attached files thus paying the full bill for the
        transmission.


        There have been numerous articles lately in the trade
        magazines and newspapers about software piracy. In
        expressing my opinion on the subject I tend to get pretty
        warm around the collar. I personally resent being called a
        crook before I even purchase software from a vendor. I
        realize this is pretty strong wording but that is exactly
        what is being done with the currect protection schemes. A
        measure I recommend to any one who asks for my opinion
        before purchasing is simply to only buy from those companys
        who do not call you a crook first. If enough people follow
        this advise and stopped buying products like LOTUS 123, the
        companys in question would be forced to use other means to
        protect their products. LOTUS 123 isnot the best package on
        the market but simply using Hollywood type media hype
        promote themselves as being such. Similar to the media
        advertising blitz before the openning of a loosing movie.



        One more item than I'll quit blowing off steam for a while.
        I noticed Tom Jennings articles about the Hays 2400 baud
        modems and it brought to mind a problem I'm having with
        another companys product. I'm sure everyone has seen
        articles advertising CTOS the wordprocessing package in all
        the trade mags and newspappers. We have beena use rof CTOS
        for about 3 years. Last year around June we received a new
        update. The program had a problem in dealing with CIT80
        terminals. After 9 months of asking for help, the previous
        release was patched to correct them problem, an attempt was
        made to installa new version. I said attempt because it
        didn't work. We were told they would be back in a couple of







FIDONEWS     --           03 Jun 85  00:00:54           Page 4

        days to correct the problems. Two months later, after many
        calls, we came to find out the person who was responsible
        for the installation had been sent to Europe. Letters to the
        presidend of the company have gone unanswered. The only
        comments are from the sales representives who keep saying
        give us time. This is all well and good except that a new
        maintenance renewal period is approaching. I would not and
        could not in good concience recommend to anyone the purchase
        of this product, CTOS. There are other wordprocessing
        packages that work on the entire line of DEC computers that
        are fully supported and whose vendors respond to problems in
        a more timely manner.


        Well that is all for now. Hope this will help someone. Any
        responses should be addressed to the SYSOP of #313 or #370.

                       "Compu-peater" a new concept
                       by Dan Taylor, Sysop Fido 411

        I  may have coined a new term "Compu-peating".   As you may 
        have  guessed,  it  is simply adding one  or  perhaps  more 
        computers   in   between  you  and  whatever  system   your 
        ultimately  communicating  with that is at the end  of  the 
        chain.   A  Computer Repeater if you will.   Why you  would 
        ever want to do this, I'll leave up to you.

        I'm sure this concept is not one that everyone can or  will 
        use,  but for those who can benefit from it,  I'll share my 
        experience. 

        I  have  an IBM-PC at home that I use like most  any  other 
        person that has a computer at home.  I have fun with it!  I 
        run a Fido board (411),  I write my mother letters,  I play 
        with BASIC, Turbo Pascal and a number of other things.  One 
        thing  I  really  like doing is calling up  other  bulletin 
        boards and up/downloading files.  I do that alot at and for 
        work too, where I use an IBM-XT.

        Now,  I save my company money on their phone bill by making 
        calls  to bulletin boards at night when I'm home.   I  also 
        benefit  because I can use many of the same  programs  that 
        I'm collecting for my use at work.  Enter the Compu-peater.  
        Here's how I've gotten the concept to work for me.

        I've  installed  2  Hayes 1200B modems in the XT  at  work.  
        With  Fido running on COM2,  that leaves COM1 for  MINITEL.  
        It's  obvious that I have 2 phone lines at work with  which 
        to do this.   I set up Fido at work such that I can use the 
        "0" command to exit to DOS.   I do have WATCHDOG running so 
        as not to leave things in a mess if carrier is lost between 
        home  and  work.   After  calling in to Fido  at  work  and 
        exiting to DOS, I bring up MINITEL.  It looks a bit strange 
        on  my  screen,  because of the  direct  cursor  addressing 
        MINITEL  does.   One thing you have to NOT do is TYPE AHEAD 
        of  any  prompts.   Keep  in mind that you do  not  have  a 
        keyboard  type  ahead buffer to help you  out.   One  thing 
        you'll need to do is patch or just set the Terminal setting 
        in the Compu-peater's MINITEL to NONE.  If you leave it set 
        to  emulate  VT-102,  You won't get any  line  feeds.   But 
        beyond that, it works fine.

        Once MINITEL is up, you should set it's modem to respond to 
        an online escape charactor other than the default of '+++'.  
        I  set  it  to look for  '@@@',  with  the  command  string 
        "ATS2=64".  64  is the decimal value of the ASCII charactor 
        '@'.  That way,  if you call into a system (as I did  while 
        testing  it  out) that won't disconnect the phone when  you 
        say goodbye,  you will have control of the remote MINITEL's 
        modem,  and  can hang up the remote modem's phone  line  by 
        then  using the Hayes command "ATH".   All I can say if you 
        omit this step is "YOU'RE ASKING FOR PROBLEMS".

        I  have tried downloading THROUGH the Compu-peater  from  a

        public  BBS.   I've  found that using  XMODEM,  MODEM7  and 
        TELINK no work so good!  However, KERMIT seems to work just 
        fine.   An  alternative is to simply download to the Compu-
        peater using any of the methods above,  and later, download 
        from it to you.

        Again,  this  may not be for everyone,  but  for  me,  it's 
        become an invaluable tool...

        Any questions or comments may be addressed to me Dan Taylor 
        on Fido 1/411.

               The Duties of a Network or Region Coordinator
                          by Ben Baker -- Fido 76
                         and Ken Kaplan -- Fido 22


             This  article defines the duties of a network or region
        coordinator.

             First,  the  coordinator  accepts  application for, and
        assigns applicants node numbers.   In  the  case  of  region
        coordinators,  the  applicant  should  be located within the
        region.  If he is not, he is  referred  to  the  appropriate
        coordinator.  (A temporary node number, something awful like
        32767 can be assigned to  permit  sending  him  mail.)  When
        applicable, a region coordinator may also refer an applicant
        to a network host.

             Applications will be accepted only  via  FidoNet  mail.
        This  verifies  that  the  applicant's  board  was  at least
        running once.   An  application  must  contain  board  name,
        sysop's  name,  board  phone  number,  sysop's  voice  phone
        number, sysop's mailing address, board's city and  state  if
        different, highest baud rate supported if not 2400 and hours
        of operation.  We recommend that  the  coordinator  place  a
        message  in  his  BULLETIN.BBS file that can not be skipped,
        telling users not to request a node by leaving a message  on
        his board, and that such a message will not be acknowledged.

             The new applicant is assigned a node number.   For  the
        first  month or so, we ask coordinators to assign numbers of
        600 and up to avoid conflicts with nodes still  running  old
        versions  of  Fido.   After  that, any convenient assignment
        scheme may be used, provided  only  that  all  node  numbers
        within the coordinator's region or network are unique.

             Via  FidoNet  mail, the coordinator sends the applicant
        notification of his new node number and instructions on  how
        to  use the '4' command to set up his Fido Net & Node.  This
        step verifys that the phone number is correct, and that  the
        net/node is receiving mail.  He may also provide any special
        routing instructions for his network, if applicable.

             Once notification has  been  successfully  mailed,  the
        coordinator moves the new node entry into the permanent node
        list for his region or area.

             From time to time  the  coordinator  will  receive  and
        process  requests  from  existing nodes for changes to phone
        number, board name, temporary change of status (up or down),
        etc..

             If,  for  unknown reasons, a node stops receiving mail,
        the coordinator will replace his phone number  in  the  node
        list  with  the  -DOWN- flag and make a reasonable effort to
        determine   the   cause   and   necessary   actions.    When
        "dissappearing" nodes fail to reappear within a month or so,
        they may be removed form the node list.

             Once each week, if and only if his  permanent  nodelist
        has  changed,  the  coordinator will send a copy via FidoNet
        file attach to Fido 1/0.  The file will be named  REGION.nnn
        or  NETWORK.nnn,  where nnn is the region or network number.
        Each Friday Fido 1/0 will assemble for  distribution, a  new
        NODELIST,  using  the  most current file from each region or
        network.

             Finally, the coordinator will be  the  first  point  of
        contact  for questions related to Fido and FidoNet.  He will
        make every effort to answer questions and solve problems  in
        a timely manner.  He will be provided a list of "experts" on
        various subjects to whom he may  refer  questions  he  can't
        handle.  Thus the right person to answer any question can be
        found quickly.

             It sounds like a lot to ask, but remember, the  typical
        coordinator  will  be  handling  only  a few to about thirty
        nodes.  Ken Kaplan has been doing  this  and  more  for  300
        nodes!   And  a  new  coordinator  will have all the help he
        needs to set him self up to take care of business.

             If you have any questions you  can  request  help  from
        Fidos 22, 51 or 76.  We look forward to working with you and
        having a sucessful  decentralization  of  the  new  multinet
        Fido.

                Fido #50

                As  many of you know,  Tim Meyers has written a Fido 
        look-alike in Turbo Pascal for CP/M, and has sent it to Doug 
        Good, a remote sysop on Fido #50, and I to look over.  Right 
        now,  all we have is the preliminary version, which is quite 
        bare (no download or upload protocols or  FidoNetting),  and 
        he  has notified me that he will send the new version  soon.  
        Many  of you have asked for a copy of the source  code,  but 
        right now,  as I understand it,  I am not to even give out a 
        compiled  version,  so I will be holding back on that  until 
        Tim  informs me otherwise.   This BBS (called TotoBBS) looks 
        very  Fidoish,  and should start pulling some  CP/M  systems 
        into the net.  Doug has had some problems running TotoBBS on 
        his  Kaypro,  and he thinks it has to do with the fact  that 
        Turbo Pascal dislikes working with BYE.   Anyway, Doug and I 
        had been working on our own BBS in Turbo Pascal for CP/M and 
        MSDOS  before we knew about Tim's BBS,  and we have sort  of 
        taken  it  as  a challenge to make our BBS better  than  his 
        (which could turn out being a chore).   Our first project is 
        to get rid of BYE, so we are looking for a decent I/O driver 
        for CP/M (we already have one for MS-DOS) that will poll for 
        a character at the serial port, and handle buffered I/O.  If 
        you know of one, please mail me some info on where I can get 
        my hands on it.  If there are any features that you think we 
        should include in our BBS,  please tell us,  and we will try 
        to complete this project by the end of the summer.

                        Obtaining a Fido Net Number
                          by Ken Kaplan -- Fido 22


             When several existing Fido Node's make the decision  to 
        form a network,  ie.  several clustered nodes,  the proposed 
        host  must  send  a  FidoNet  mail  message  to  his  Region 
        Coordinator  with  the  following  information  in  order to 
        obtain a Net Number: 

                 (1)  The region number(s), and/or network number(s)
            affected by the  formation  of  the  new  network.   The
            region coordinator will inform Fido 1/0 and the hosts of
            any affected  networks  of  the  formation  of  the  new
            network.

                 (2)  The  name  of  the proposed network.  The name
            should be descriptive of location.  For example SOCALNET
            for  nodes  in  the Southern California Area and MassNet
            for Massachusettes Area.   DOGNET  doesn't  help  others
            know what your interested in or what area of the country
            your group lives in.

                 (3) A copy of the proposed network's nodelist.  The
            nodelist file should be named Frrr-nnn.NET where rrr  is
            the proposed host's current region or net number and nnn
            is his current node number.  This file  should  be  sent
            attached to the message of application for a Net Number.

             When   Fido 1/0  receives  the  above  items  from  the
        Coordinator, the information received will be verified and a
        net number assigned.  A FidoNet mail message will be sent to
        all affected with the assigned net number.

             If there are  any  questions  on  the  above  procedure
        please send a FidoNet mail message to Fido 22, 51 or 76.

                               Fidonet Regions


        The following is a listing of the multinet Fido regions.  
        This only applies to independant nodes.  If you are a part 
        of a local network, then your network will be assigned its 
        own network number.

                  Fido Message Security Loophole
                  by Lloyd Miller, Fido #418

             I  have  discovered  what I believe to be  a  small 
        security loophole for Fido systems who are running  with 
        public access allowed. If a user logs in giving the name 
        "ALL"  that  user can then wreak havok with  the  public 
        message base.  "All" can then proced to kill any message 
        addressed  to "All",  and just by reading "his" mail  it 
        will  be  marked as (RECV'D) and if the sysop  uses  the 
        (undocumented)  "2"  command  then the  sysop  could  be 
        killing the messages himself.
             Of course if you validate users before letting them 
        into  the message section there is no problem with this. 
        Don't go rushing off to make your system (semi)  private 
        quite yet, there is a (fairly) easy solution.
             The  solution to this is simple once you know about 
        it.  Use  sysop.exe to enter a user named  "all"  BEFORE 
        some twit tries it. Set the password to a long string of 
        random  keystrokes  and give the fake user $1 credit  so 
        sysop.exe won't expire the entry in 30 days (or whatever 
        you  use).  For extra security you can give  "All"  twit 
        priv. level so even if the password is found it probably 
        can't be used to spend the $1. Hope you sysops out there 
        see this before any malicious users find it.  (My system 
        has taken care of it of course).
             There  is a possible problem with the $1 credit  in 
        that  the  proposed  user directory utility  will  think 
        "all" is a paid up network user. This is easily repaired 
        at several stages.
             There  is  still  one (very  small)  problem  left. 
        Public  messages  do not have to be addressed to  "all". 
        They  can  be  To:  anyone or everyone  or  hey  you  or 
        whatever your users fee like.  (Tom will claim this is a 
        feature  so  you  can send mail to  someone  who  hasn't 
        registered yet.) About all you can do about this is warn 
        your  users or ignore it till someone gets burned.  Good 
        luck however you treat this warning,  I still think Fido 
        is extremly secure for the amount it does.

                          New Fido Utility Software
           -------------------------------------------------------
           David Purks
           Sysop #456, FIDO-FHLMC

        I have written a new Fido Sysop's user utility that is ready 
        for distribution.  Originally I wrote it because I am forced 
        to work on our Fido from remote a majority of the time.  The 
        old utility is screen oriented and very difficult to work 
        with from remote.  The new version offers a number of 
        enhancements that make it worth using even if you don't do 
        any modifications of the users file from remote.  

        The utility I've written looks and works much like Fido 
        itself and runs 25-30% faster.  From the tests we've run, I 
        think it's pretty much machine independent (works on IBM and 
        Rainbow 100).  

        In order to do the final testing on it, I'd like to hear 
        from people who would be interested in giving the routine a 
        try.  The first 20 or so Sysops that notify me of their 
        interest, I'll Fidomail the routine and documentation to 
        you.  I am especially interested in hearing from Sysops who 
        run Fido on equipment other than IBM & Rainbow.  Give it a 
        try and let me know if you have any problems, sug-gestions, 
        etc.  After the initial distribution, everyone else can pick 
        the routine up from our board in the \FIDODIST area or any 
        where else you can find it.  

        [Editor's note:  It is also available from 1/375]

                                Fidonews Bugs

        In the last issue of Fidonews, it was stated that the "list 
        of nodes in a file" feature no longer works in Fido.

        That turns out to be only partly correct.  It does not work 
        in version 10i due to a program bug, but in version 10j it 
        works as documented.
