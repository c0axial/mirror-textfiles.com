                    And on This Anniversary . . .

     After seeing my article in FidoNews 806 I decided to do it
     again.  Please forgive me but it's an ego thing.  :-)

     This week I'd like to talk about echomail.  Yes, that's
     right, the method by which we communicate about all sorts of
     topics from cooking to politics to C++ to idle chatter.

     If you're like most people you're reading this on Monday
     evening after a day at work, and today is February 18, 1991.
     The date is important in this one instance, for last
     Saturday, as noted in the Interrupt Stack for quite a while,
     was the fifth anniversary of the introduction of echomail by
     a man named Jeff Rush.

     I think it proper that we all take a moment to reflect on
     what the past five years have brought us as a result of
     Mr. Rush's scheme of mail transfer.  The average user can
     talk to people as far away as China and Sweden free of
     charge by just reading and entering a message.  The average
     sysop can do likewise, and also discuss BBS and mailer
     software, mail processors, doorware, and a host of other
     things.  Echomail is primarily a form of communication.
     That is what it was intended for, I think - for people to be
     able to talk to one another using a simple yet powerful
     medium (those of you still trying to get your mail
     processors to pack your mail correctly may differ on the
     simple part, but I think you must admit it is a powerful
     method of communication).  The average message on an
     international echo could travel around the globe in less
     that two days, and a reply could be on its way in less than
     three.  Wow - netmail can't do that by its very nature.

     So just stop and think a moment.  Echomail is not a tool by
     which you may control people ("Do it my way or your feed is
     history!"), and it is not a vehicle for individual
     betterment.  It is a way to talk - to communicate - to
     exchange ideas and information.  And it seems to have become
     the very basis of FidoNet.

     Just stop and think a moment what echomail has done for you.
     That's all I ask.

                 SUPPORT YOUR FAVORITE ONLINE SERVICE?

     [My apologies in advance to those readers located outside of
     the United States of America, because the following editorial
     probably won't be of much interest to you, but there is no
     "Zone 1" or "U.S.A. only" edition of Fidonews.]

     The following item recently appeared in Communications Week, a
     telecommunications trade publication:

     "COALITION PETITIONS FCC - A broad coalition of users and
     providers of enhanced services last week petitioned the FCC to
     declare that regulating enhanced-service providers as if they
     are public utilities is contrary to the public interest.
     Noting that the District of Columbia Public Service Commission
     has tentatively concluded that it has the authority to impose
     tariff requirements and market-entry and -exit rules on
     enhanced-service providers, the 16 petitioners urged the FCC to
     pre-empt any such state regulatory action.  The District
     proceeding is prompting some enhanced-service providers to
     consider restructuring their services 'and possibly restricting
     offerings in the District,' the petitioners said.  Among the
     petitioners were BT Tymnet Inc., the California Bankers
     Clearing House Association, CompuServe Inc., Digital Equipment
     Corp., IBM, the Information Industry Association, MasterCard
     International Inc., McGraw Hill Inc., Prodigy Services Co. and
     Visa U.S.A. Inc." [End of quote.]

     Now, many of us use, or have in the past used enhanced-service
     providers (we sometimes call them "Packet Switching Networks"
     or "Online Services").  And, our first inclination might be
     that we don't really want each of the 50 states setting
     different regulations and requirements for the various
     providers.

     But, there are those of us who remember not so long ago when
     the enhanced-service providers were asking everyone to lobby
     the FCC on their behalf, so that they wouldn't have to pay the
     same types of access charges that voice long distance carriers
     have to pay to local telephone companies.  Telenet (now
     SprintNet) in particular asked all their users, including users
     of their PC Pursuit service, to write the FCC on their behalf.
     The FCC was swamped with letters of protest (as were several
     congressmen), and plans to levy the access charge were dropped.
     And how did the enhanced-service providers reward those who had
     written on their behalf?  Well, in Telenet's case, they changed
     the pricing structure on PC Pursuit so that instead of paying a
     flat rate for monthly service, you paid a higher rate for a
     service with a 30 hour cap... and very few of their promises to
     upgrade equipment in various cities and add new access points
     were kept (we were promised an indial in Sault Ste. Marie,
     Michigan over two years ago.  We're still waiting).  To say
     that a lot of PC Pursuit users felt like they had been shafted
     FidoNews 8-07                Page 4                   18 Feb 1991


     is probably more than just a bit of an understatement!

     Well, there's a pretty good chance that the enhanced-service
     providers may come around asking for your support again.  May I
     offer a suggestion?  Go ahead and write the FCC and urge that
     the enhanced-service providers be subject to Federal regulation
     only in all states in which they offer universal access...
     that is, full access to all their services at the price of a
     local call, from any point within the state, so that those
     living in suburban and rural areas are not disadvantaged.  In
     those states where access is not universal, however, the states
     should have regulatory jurisdiction.

     What's the rationale behind this?  Well, apparently the FCC and
     the Federal government aren't too interested in seeing that the
     enhanced-service providers don't "cherry pick" - that is, offer
     services only in the more lucrative major metropolitan areas
     and medium-size cities, while ignoring the smaller cities and
     rural areas.  However, the state governments would presumably
     be somewhat more responsive to the needs of all their
     residents, including those that live in the outlying areas.

     The concept of "universal service" has been applied to the
     telephone industry for quite some time.  In many areas, even if
     you can't reach an alternate long distance carrier by using
     "dial 1" access, you can get to their switch by using a
     "950-xxxx" access number, which is generally a free call from
     anywhere in a LATA (even if you have to dial a "1" or "0" first
     to make the call go through an older switch).  If the long
     distance carriers can achieve "universal service" (or something
     very close to it) through use of the "950-" numbers, I wonder
     why the enhanced-service providers can't put some of their
     access ports on "950-" numbers, so as to make them available in
     areas outside of the major cities.

     The city that I live in has a population of over fifteen
     thousand, a state university, the headquarters of TWO electric
     power utilities, the headquarters of two banks plus branch
     offices of several other financial institutions, and several
     state and federal offices, all within the local calling area.
     We are also THE major shopping area for folks living within a
     50-mile radius.  If none of the enhanced-service providers are
     interested in providing service here, I can just imagine how
     long the wait will be for those small towns that have only a
     couple of gas stations, a small supermarket, and a dry goods
     store.  If the telephone companies offered service the way the
     packet networks do, I might have to drive 150 miles to make or
     receive a long distance call!

     Those of you who are concerned with the environment
     (specifically, air pollution caused by thousands of automobiles
     stuck in traffic jams), and who have advocated "telecommuting"
     (working at home using a computer and modem) as one possible
     solution should be especially concerned about this.  No one is
     going to pay several dollars an hour in long distance charges
     to work from their home!  So because access to the
     FidoNews 8-07                Page 5                   18 Feb 1991


     packet-switching networks is not often available from the "far
     suburbs" of a city, the workers that have to travel the
     furthest (and use the most gasoline) are forced by economics to
     drive to work even when that work could be done from home.

     So, if you are asked to write to the FCC, please consider
     making your support conditional upon the enhanced-service
     providers showing some "corporate responsibility" and not
     thumbing their collective noses at the smaller cities.  It is
     high time that the enhanced-service providers realized that
     there is life outside the big cities, and that those folks
     deserve access, too.  As it is, folks in some foreign countries
     can access U.S. online services and packet networks for less
     than what it costs folks in some of our own rural areas (in
     many countries you can access the packet network as a local
     call from any telephone exchange in the country!).

     One final note - those of you who only call BBS's and who don't
     subscribe to any of the online services may wonder why you
     should even care about this.  Well, just keep in mind that some
     of those great programs that you've downloaded from your
     favorite BBS (or that your users have uploaded to you, if
     you're a SysOp) may have originally reached your area through a
     packet-switching network or online service.  The more folks
     that can economically access such services, the faster new
     software travels around the world.  Besides, someday YOU may
     have a need to access an online service from somewhere out in
     the boonies!

     As Bruce Gingery noted in his article in FidoNews 806 (Feb 11,
     1991), there is still a general problem with file compression.
     As it is now, there are several different formats being used for
     compressed files within the net that cannot use the standard
     compressed file extensions. (ie. ZIP, PAK, ARC etc)  This holds
     true for nodelists/diffs as well as our beloved friends, the
     mail packets that come.  Bruce mentioned the usage in an
     alternate network of a single character change to make life
     easier for sysops and others looking for files and how to
     decompress it.  Well, that is all well and good, but something
     is still lacking.

     Today, most nodes support compressed mail packets.  This is
     easily determined by looking at the latest nodelist, which will
     give an indication of what nodes do support ArcMail, and which
     do not.  However, time has passed, and ARC is definately not the
     best archiving metheod available for use anymore.  Many sysops
     with considerable echo traffic have realized this and have
     switched to other compression methods for echomail.  All well
     and good for sending mail between known systems, but what about
     others?  Even netmail is starting to move in compressed files,
     with the all too vague extensions.  What decompressor should I
     use for mail from node x?  How about y?  What should I use to
     compress mail for node z?

     Suggestion?  Well, it would seem like the most logical way to
     take care of this situation would be to add a flag to the
     nodelist.  Yes, it means adding to the size of that already huge
     file, but I think it would be worth it. Instead of the MN flag
     (no compression supported), a separate flag could be implemented
     that would define the preferred compression format for that
     node. This flag could then be automatically used by programs
     such as echomail tossers, mailers, and by human users as well.

     So, my question is -- what to do?  This is one suggestion, more
     are welcome...

     Bruce Gingery
     FidoNet 1:310/5.1

              YAPPPI (Yet another packet proposal - part 1)

     Our computer telecommunications has been growing by leaps and
     bounds.  FidoNet is officially part of InterNet, with regular
     gates to everywhere.   I believe I even saw an Origin line from
     Antarctica, as a point from a Zone-3 node not too long ago.

     The growth is not merely geographical, however.  In addition,
     there are STILL greater varieties of the types and forms of com-
     munication.   While true action video mail remains a twinkle in
     the eye of some, the NeXT pastes a "lips" icon to a message for
     far more than the old "sealed with a kiss".  Click the lips, and
     you LISTEN to the digitized accompanying voice mail recording,
     music or whatever digitized sound has been mailed, in CD quality.

     Fax machines, and fax boards get faster and finer.  More and
     more detail is included in high resolution graphics images and
     digitized video, in resolution, in depth of color or graytone,
     desired transparency, as well as overall height and width.  And
     more and more, the computer is THE hub of it all.

     With each new development, from the original swapping of a
     message base, to today's 4-d addressing of all continents,
     FidoNet is the "compatibility" standard because the people
     whose heart is in it, do it best.  And FidoNet has established
     a fairness tradition of accepting the new without dropping those
     who are not yet mechanically able to embrace the new.

     Because of this also, however, we have MANY proposed standards,
     and probably should.  Though we can extend our hands together
     to Tom Jennings, no single person could have brought even the
     readership of this FidoNews together, let alone the uncounted
     users who actually participate in the Networks to which we
     are connected by these keyboards and screens.

     The fast growth has started, and many of the kludges will have
     to fall behind, just as patches on an outfit are lost when that
     portion of the clothing is replaced.   Yet, in the tradition of
     FTS-0001, we can not justly abandon anyone who can now partici-
     pate.

     In the next several weeks, I will attempt to illustrate how
     packets, messages, tick-files, compressed mail and these other
     advances can be smoothly integrated, while leaving the connect-
     ion OPEN for those who cannot quickly move into these advances.
     Already, the sheer bulk of the full NodeList makes it nearly
     impossible for some to "FULLY" participate, but the tree hier-
     archy makes allowances for that, allowing the use of partial
     nodelists by those who cannot support the entire list, and even
     FidoNews 8-07                Page 8                   18 Feb 1991


     more, POINTing as the rest of the network can reasonably presume
     Boss routing for unlisted point systems.

     This proposal IS for two new packet headers, but with a powerful
     difference.  These are equally applicable to packets and the
     single message, and to the free flow of files of all types
     without choking the network on unprocessable problems.  It also
     allows for streamlining of processing, at origin,  in transit
     and at the ultimate leaf destination.

     There has been a tremendous growth of POINT activity, in all
     zones, but, as I have been told, especially in zone two.  In
     recognition of this, these type-4 and type-5 headers allow for
     full 4-d addressing.   With 4-d addressing, the POINT is, of
     course, the ultimate "leaf" in the FidoNet tree structure.
     Full implementation of 4-d addressing allows para-FidoNet
     direct point-to-point communications, as well as Boss Node
     pass-through in Leaf-to-Leaf communications.

     The type-5 header addresses the needed bulk of seen-by and path
     information, so important in shared ECHO and Group mail. The two
     headers are as compatible as possible, both with the type-2 FTS-
     0001 header, as well as with the FTS-0001 .MSG format, and with
     nod to the FSC-0007 type-3 proposal.

     The kludges have grown to fill in what would not fit in the
     header and may amount in quite a few cases, to more kludge than
     message.  Yet, hobbiest dollars have a far greater affinity to
     improvements and new items than the moving of information which
     actually IS useless -- which in the final analysis does NOT
     contribute either to direct information, nor smooth flow.
     Many places now, a text word or entire line takes the place of a
     bit or two, or perhaps 8 bytes.

     Next week, I'll introduce the proposed flagset, and after that,
     the headers which it helps to identify.

             Well, prior to my article of FidoNews 806 concerning my
     perceived degradation of the quality of FidoNews, I had several
     conversations with JonesNose at 321/202 and he suggested that I
     shouldn't air my  concerns in such  a negative manor; that they
     would  be counter productive and would serve to foment hate; in
     deed that I should take my homophobic  attitude with me to hell
     and rot for awhile.

     He told me that my attitude was hateful. He convinced me he was
     right.  He did, in fact, let me know in no uncertain terms what
     kind of person he though I was. He was right again.

     I had asked that the submission be removed because he convinced
     me that I should be more tolerant of gays and not promote hate.
     It wasn't  removed,  it got printed,  I get  to live with it --
     that's not a big problem for me to live with, I'll just send an
     apology  to  everyone  who  sends  me a return on  my hate mail
     because they'll be right too.

     Listen up, FidoNet: I am sorry. I'll never happen again. Vince,
     your  comments  were  eye-opening too.  Rest  assured  I'll not
     clutter your news letter with hate again.

     If anyone wants a personal  voice apology, call me  from 6 p.m.
     to 11 p.m. and I'll apologize.
