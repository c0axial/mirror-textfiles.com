========================================================================
    I have been corresponding with an ex Fidonet sysop from Hong
Kong regarding the doings there, and what "we" should be doing
about them.  Truth is, what CAN we do about them?  Nothing
really.  Ultimately, only the sysops in a particular area can
remedy problems in that area.

    People talk about the "fidogods" as if they have some sort of
power to change things.  I know that personally, about all I can
do is print the articles that come in.  I cannot (and do not
want to) control anything outside my own BBS. It astonishes me
to be included in some mythical group of fidogods.  I have not
even met anyone else that seems to be included in that group,
let alone planned anything with them.  I probably have

had posts from some, but the posts looked exactly the same as
the ones that came from points.  No more no less.

    Here in our own net, I am in the midst of a debate on
whether non-hubs should be allowed to vote in net decisions. As
I gave up being a hub a year or so back, I have been eliminated
suddenly from voting status to a non-entity.  I argue against it
the same as any other sysop in any other net.

    It is time that we started to develope new methods.  The
political shortcomings of fidonet are largely the result of
technological shortcomings.  We are stagnating, and we should be
doing something about it.

Subject: "How to Manage Your Personal Smurfdoms"
From: Cindy Ingersoll (formerly 1:2623/71)
4/26/95

Greetings Editor!

 I dunno if all of what I'd like to express would fit or be fitting
for the Snooze. I imagine even wanting to write the following will get
me in more trouble. But, having no other means to let people know
what's going on here in net2623, I figure I got nothing to loose - my
node number was already yanked, deleted, expunged from the nodelist
like a loose speck of dust off a disk head.  Why? What heinous crime
did I commit? What moral atrocity did I perpetrate??

   I was given 2 days notice, at around 1am, day 1, that my mailer
(Portal of Power) was not FTS-0001 compliant. I immediately replied
asking what exactly is wrong with the mailer, and I will try to fix
it, having no idea where this "non compliance" spiel was coming from,
because for several months now my mailer and the NCs mailer have had
not one problem sending mail, and the NC was the one who installed PoP
for me ITFP. Next day I tried calling the NC voice, no answer, calling
his nodes, no answer. When I finally get a carrier later that
afternoon, I got Yoohoo/2u2 <CLICK-Hangup> everytime it sees 2623/71
calling! Hmm.

  The mailer was not the real issue. Its just the only semi-plausible
excuse this NC has to expunge me from the nodelist. There was a
discussion going on in our local net sysop echo, about CRaPs, local
net rules and elections, and areafix access to requisite fido areas
(or the lack thereof for non-CRaP nodes).

Apparently, even discussing these things was enough to get me kicked out.

 One node asked why there was no elections or net policy. His reward
was removal from that mandatory sysop echo..

  Another node, not in our net, not even sposed to be posting in that
echo, made some harsh comments about the NCs way of responding to us,
FidoNews 12-19                 Page:  3                    08 May 1995

but he was given permission to stay and didn't even suffer one pointed
word in retaliation (even tho the guy pretty much slapped him [the NC]
in the face for being so medievial).. We were called assholes and
bitches for less.

 I think the bulk of the problem lies in the fact that this NC made
more or less a *business* out of reselling his PC feed.

 No one ever denied he had a right to charge whatever fee, but
realistically, considering the number of potential "buyers" of fido
echos, and the explicitly *non profit* nature of fido, $10 a month for
echos is ALOT - and that may be why this NC has only 3-5 paying
members (out of what 40??).  Specially when the same NC offers ALL of
usenet (8000 newsgroups now??) for $20 a month through the same PC
feed used for fido?! And even more, when you can get full Internet
dialup access locally for $10 a month ;^)

  I already know the answer that I'll get tho, "Too bad, if you can't
pay for the toys" which is fine, which is why I went and got feeds out
of state.

  But is bringing these things forward for discussion, and then being
deleted from the nodelist, the norm here in fidonet?  Since when did a
net become the personal smurfdom of any particular NC?? (Or has it
always been like that?? I've only been in the net a few months and boy
it's been, uhh, instructional..) Does investing in equipment to handle
fido mean *buying* ownership of the net/nodelist segment??

 There was alot more involved in this particular incident, a Pee4 was
filed by me, hasn't been resolved yet I spose, at least I have not
heard anything, just got a cc: from the RC, directed to the NC asking
why I was deleted.. No answer yet. I archived the posts, maybee I
should publish them, "How to Manage Your Personal Smurfdom"?

  I guess the only thing I can do is sit and wait, while all my
incoming netmail goes to bitbucket.. Funny, the snooze editor was just
saying something about a woman who went psycho and butchered some one
after being deleted from the nodelist? ;)  Nah couldn't happen :-)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thnaks to Paul Cuni (1:141/515) for my new sig file!

   I am not looking foward to having this shit in your crappy
fidonews. The articles in it are long and drawn out. It's like
reading a Novel to express a simple point. I could go on but
I'd just be wasting my breath like your Newsletter wastes my
bandwidth.
