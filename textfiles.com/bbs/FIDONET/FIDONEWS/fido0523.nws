     It's time to register for "FidoCon '88" the International FidoNet
     Community's Annual conference and telecommunications exhibition.
     It will be held August 24th thru August 28th at the Drawbridge
     Inn & Convention Center - close to the Greater Cincinnati
     International Airport.

     This is your opportunity to market to a select group of computer
     users and buyers.  Please note that we will be drawing from an
     international community of over 3000 telecommunications
     enthusiasts.  In addition to the conference attendees, we will be
     attracting local interest through multi-media advertising aimed
     at the business buyer.  Already we have attendance commitments
     from vendors such as AT&T, US Robotics, DAK Industries, etc.

     In order to get a broad range of exhibitors at this show, we urge
     you to make an early commitment.  Booth space is limited and will
     be assigned on a first come, first serve basis.  We have already
     contacted by mail major modem, computer, and peripheral
     manufacturers as well as telecommunication service and software
     suppliers.

                     FIDOCON 89 -- WHERE'S IT GONNA BE?

     The Membership Services Committee, under the chairmanship of
     Phil Ardussi, has been charged with recommending a site to hold
     FidoCon in August 1989.

     Would you like to host the next FidoCon in your city?  Here is
     your chance.  Send a proposal to the FidoCon Site Selection
     subcommittee to be considered for the honor of hosting FidoCon
     89.

     What do you need to do to host FidoCon in your city?  Planning
     an international conference requires a great deal of work on the
     part of the hosts.  A site must be selected with adequate
     meeting space, accessibility, reasonable price and 1001 other
     details.  To give you an idea of what needs to be done and to
     give the Site Selection Subcommittee some information about your
     city, we need to have the following questionnaire filled out:

     LOCATION:

          1.   What is the mileage from the airport to the host hotel?

          2.   Is shuttle service furnished by the hotel available to
               and from the hotel and airport?

          3.   Are there direct (no connections) flights from the top
               ten largest metropolitan areas to your airport?

     HOTEL FACILITIES:

          1.   Is there a large (150 person) conference room which
               will be available throughout the conference?

          2.   Are there at least three smaller conference rooms which
               will be available for meetings during the conference?

          3.   Will there be display space for vendors?

          4.   Will there be a small private conference room available
               for the host and other committees?

          5.   Will  the hotel guarantee room rate,  not to exceed $80
               for double occupancy?

          6.   Will the host committee prepare a list including price
               ranges and bill of fare for all hotel restaurants in
               advance of the conference?

          7.   Will the hotel provide early committment on prices of
               banquets, receptions, coffee break service, and any
               other food and beverage service to the conference
               sessions?

          8.   Will the host committee be able to obtain corporate
               sponsors to help defray conference expenses?  Who are
     FidoNews 5-23                Page 3                    6 Jun 1988


               they?

          9.   Does the hotel have handicap facilities?

         10.   Is the hotel or convention center willing to provide
               help in the planning of the conference?

     LOCAL SUPPORT:

          1.   There must be an active committee consisting of at
               least five members in the host city at least nine
               months before the conference.  Members of this
               committee should be prepared to spend at least two
               hours per week in the early planning stages and at
               least 8-10 hours per week just before the conference.
               The local chair should work closely with the FidoCon
               subcommittee chair by Net Mail, US Snail, and voice.
               Please furnish the name of the host committee and the
               name and address of the host chairperson.

          2.   Sponsorship of the conference by a local user group
               would be a plus.  Please furnish the name of the
               sponsoring group, if any.

          3.   Will a list of nearby restaurants (all price ranges --
               including fast food) and local entertainment be
               prepared by the local committee?

          4.   Will maps of the area would be provided to attendees?

          5.   What activities for family members should will be
               planned by the local committee?

          6.   Will there be a software swap area set up with
               computers for people to trade disks?  Will any of them
               be equipped with a printer and/or modem? Will disk
               sales (at cost) be included?

          7.   Will there be conference souvenirs, including but not
               limited to T-shirts and hats, available throughout the
               conference?

          8.   Will a special rate on car rentals be available to
               FidoCon attendees?

     OTHER:

          1.   What other events would you suggest for attendees?

          2.   What are the features of your city that make it
               particularly desirable for hosting FidoCon?

     GENERAL COMMENTS: (To be filled in by the prospective hosts)

     Please give a lot of thought to the amount of time and money that
     will be involved in hosting FidoCon.  Then, write up your

     hotel or other facility, forward five copies to the above
     address.

     If you have any questions or problems, please send me NetMail or
     give me a voice call at 303-531-9043.

     that is not connected with one of the prospective host cities
     who wants to help with planning, you are welcome to join the
     Membership Services Site Selection Subcommittee.  Send a NetMail

                            SEGUARO DOWN!

     I will be taking a vacation from 13  June  1988  through  15
     July 1988 somewhere in the great state of Texas. I live in a
     neighborhood which has a multitude of little vandals running
     amok  therefore,  I  must  lock  my system in some cold dark
     storage facility while I'm gone.

     I also need to be listed as DOWN on the nodelist during this
     time  frame.  Please  bear  with  the inconveniance but if I
     don't take a vacation... you know the rest of the story.

     There was a previous article that I submitted  for  FidoNews
     that  addressed  the  KIDS  echo  conference  and how it got
     started and where it's going. I feel that this  article  may
     generate  a  lot of traffic directed toward my system. If it
     seems I am not answering your  messages,  the  above  should
     explain why. I will however be knee deep  in  messages  that
     will  need  to  be  answered when I return and get my system
     running again. That day should be Sunday, 17  JULY  1988.  I
     will  eventually  get  around  to  replying  to  all  of the
     messages.

     There will be more articles submitted in both  the  KidsNews
     and  FidoNews  which  will  keep  everyone up to date on the
     changes, advancements, etc... with the kids echo.  Again,  I
     wish  to  thank  those  of  you  who have taken part in this
     worth while cause for our children. Only in America can this
     happen. Believe me, I have seen the way people live in other
     countries first hand. Eighteen years in  the  military  lets
     you see alot and makes you thankful for what you have.

                    You Can Make a Difference, But ...

                      NO MORE NEW STRUCTURES, PLEASE


     Lately,  we've seen something that seems pretty weird to me, and
     I run a BBS that caters to Dr. Thompson calls "bad craziness."

     This week's FidoNews contains  yet another proposal for a struc-
     ture for a yet another new governing body for the  FidoNet.    I
     haven't been keeping track,  but now there can't be less than  a
     dozen of them kicking around, and they keep on coming.

     Perhaps  the  word  has  reached you by now  that  Robert  Anson
     Heinlein is dead.  Will you read a brief quote,  relevant to the
     subject at hand, from the dean of science fiction as we know it?

            "Democracy can't work.  Mathematicians, peasants, and
         animals,  that's all there is--so democracy,  a   theory
         based on the assumption that mathematicians and peasants
         are equal,  can never work.  Wisdom is not additive; its
         maximum is that of the wisest man in a given group.

            "But  a democratic =form=  of government is okay,  as
         long  as it doesn't work.   Any social organization does
         well  enough if it isn't rigid.   The framework  doesn't
         matter  as  long as there is enough looseness to  permit
         that one man in a multitude to display his genius.  Most
         so-called   social   scientists  seem  to   think   that
         organization  is  everything.   It is  almost  nothing--
         except when it is a straightjacket.  It is the incidence
         of heroes that counts, not the pattern of zeros."

                       Robert Heinlein, _Glory Road_, pp. 261-262

     Why  do so many of you seem to think that if you can just tinker
     with the structure of IFNA,  or something like it,  you can save
     FidoNet?   The =structure= is mostly irrelevant.   We copied one
     that had worked--the one used by the Amateur Radio Relay League.
     We  could  have used any--or almost none.   No matter  what  the
     offices  are,   or how the elections are held,  only  one  thing
     matters:  the people who hold those offices.

     IFNA  exists.    There's a structure in place that can  do  just
     about anything that we'd ever want to do with the FidoNet,  from
     update and rationalize the technical specifications to lobby  on
     our own behalf.  It's a very flexible structure.  It's usable as
     it  is,   so why kill another two years starting all  over  with
     another structure?

     Now,  I'm not Pollyanna.  I  know too bloody well that there are
     big problems with the way things are being done.   I think money
     FidoNews 5-23                Page 7                    6 Jun 1988


     has  been spent unwisely and I think that responsibilities  have
     been neglected and/or mismanaged.

     But  any structure would have  had those same problems,  if  the
     same people were elected.

     Please,   let's not have any more organizational  proposals  for
     FidoNet.  Instead, let's see a lot of people pay their dues, and
     then vote and/or run for office.    Listen,  the work isn't ter-
     ribly  difficult--being a director for IFNA takes  only  a  tiny
     fraction  of the time that the rest of my BBS-related activities
     consume.  And I've tried to make a difference, and to bring some
     sense to the Board.   If more of you who are complaining now had
     been there to back me up, things would have happened very,  very
     differently.

     Make a difference.  Join IFNA.  And =VOTE=.

        Do you use Ommm to pack mail into Arcmail?
        Do you use Confmail to pack Arcmail?
        Do you use ARCmail to make Arcmail?

     Please, if you do, carefully read this article.  There are many
     sysops, some new, some old who are unintentionally abusing
     compressed mail archives (aka Arcmail).

     Just because your system and hundreds of your friends are set
     up to accept arcmail DOES NOT mean that everyone else is. If
     you automatically arcmail ALL outgoing mail, you should CEASE
     immediately.  You should only send arcmail to systems that
     are ready to accept it, want it and are able to process it.

     Just because you run Ommm to pack all messages into ARCmail
     packets does not mean that other systems have the capability to
     un-pack arcmail created in that form.

     Just because you run Confmail to pack your Arcmail does not mean
     that other systems have the capability to un-pack confmail
     generated arcmail.

     If you run Arcmail 1.1 to pack arcmail, that dosen't mean that
     all systems are able to unpack arcmail in that form.

     Unless a system has SPECIFICALLY stated to you that they want
     you to send them arcmail, you should NOT assume that they are
     able to un-pack arcmail.  Furthermore, they may not be able to
     or willing to change their operations just to handle the
     particular version of Arcmail that you are sending.  Check with
     any systems via normal net-mail that you wish to send arcmail to
     to confirm the method they can accept and be quite willing to add
     a new program in order to be able to send arcmail.

     An example:  Board 107/2232 (hopefully fictional board) sends an
     ommm generated arcmail package to me at 2:00am.  At my pre-mail
     event my system looks for arcmail (1.1) from specific systems
     that I am expecting arcmail from.  Arcmail does not expect to
     see a package from 107/2232 so it ignores it, sometimes killing
     it depending on the set-up. (This is true for other methods as
     well).  When mail is checked the next morning, there is nothing
     from 107/2232 and I have no reason to look for mail from that
     board.  The message(s) are lost forever.

     Again.  Do not automatically assume that all systems are capable
     of or willing to accept arcmail packages.  You should only send
     arcmail packages to those systems that you have talked to via
     normal net-mail in the past.  While one method of arcmail can
     un-pack arcmail of another method, if a system is not expecting
     arcmail from a specific system, it may indeed never try to un-pack
     the arcmail.  You should also agree on a specific method in which
     the arcmail will be packed.  There is no real reason why you
     should send one net-mail message to a board via arcmail of any
     form.  The transfer time savings is either non-existent or is
     trivial and besides, if the other system isn't expecting arcmail,
     your message may end up never being read.

     Sysops, thank you for taking the time to see if your system is
     automatically sending everything as arcmail.  Users, please
     alert your sysop to this very crucial problem.  Thank you.

                               BACK TO THE BUSH!
     by Todd Looney, Sysop
     Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla
     143/27, San Jose, CA.

     The  Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla in San Jose, California has  been
     working  like  the dickens to get a trip for  interested  parties
     back  to Vietnam.  Everything has been working out great so  far.
     You don't necessarily have to be a Vietnam veteran to go with us,
     everyone  i  invited!  We expect to have a group of  about  fifty
     people.   If we get more than thirty, the cost factor  as  listed
     below  will decline dramatically so start thinking about it  now.
     We  will not be taking deposits for another couple of months  yet
     so  there is still time.  We are tenatively planning to leave  in
     mid-January.

     The  initial itinerary is in and things  are  starting  to
     really  look  up  for  the "Back to the Bush"  trip  to  back  to
     Vietnam.

     All the amenities are includes as follows:

                            Round trip air fare
                          All hotels and lodging
                           Three meals per day
                  All transportation (Rail/Bus/Boat/Plane)
                  Daily sightseeing tours of your choice
     (there are many tours available in every city, or you are free
                         to go off on your own!)
       Cultural performances sponsored by the Vietnamese government
                      Vietnamese and Cambodian visas
           (yes, you can take a sightseeing tour into Cambodia!)
        English-speaking tour guides and interpreters in every city


     All  you  have  to  furnish  is  your  body,  your  international
     passport, and have your inoculations up to date (ouch!).

     Here's what it looks like so far:

     Day 1     Depart San Francisco via Japan Airlines

     Day 2     Arrive Hong Kong
               (Overnight stay because we will arrive too late to
               depart for SE Asia that evening.  There will be a
               breakfast in Hong Kong before we leave)

     Day 3     Depart Hong Kong for Bangkok, Thailand
               (We will need to stay two nights in Bangkok to get
               all of our visas issued so you will have plenty of
               time for a little R&R!)

     Day 5     Depart Bangkok, Thailand for Hanoi, Vietnam
               (We will stay two days in Hanoi)

     Day 7     Depart Hanoi for Hue City
     FidoNews 5-23                Page 11                   6 Jun 1988


               (We will stay two days in Hue City)

     Day 9     Depart Hue City for Da Nang
               (We will stay two days in Da Nang)

     Day 11    Depart Da Nag for Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon)
               (We will stay two days in Ho Chi Minh City)

     Day 13    Depart Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for Bangkok, Thailand
               (We must stay overnight in Bangkok again to "check out")

     Day 14    Depart Bangkok, Thailand for Hong Kong and
               San Francisco, California, USA!

     That's what I have so far!  I will keep everyone apprised of  any
     changes as they become available.  Looks like this whole trip  is
     going to cost us approximately $2,000.00 each.  I am making every
     attempt to get this price cut down.  After the first 15 seats are
     sold, the price will begin dropping so start saving now,  sign ups
     will  begin in a couple months after everything is finalized.   A
     refundable  deposit  will  be  required  for  reservations.   All
     deposits are refundable, but certain restrictions will apply.

     There's  more  than  six months to get ready for  this  so  start
     saving now!  Don't put it off.  This is a trip of a lifetime!  To
     do this by yourself would bankrupt you so take advantage of  this
     group discount!

     Jake Hargrove
     Fido 301/1
     High Mesa Ranger's

     To the Graduates of 88.

     I know there are many of you out there who are over the age of 18
     and  have  long since forgot what it was like to be a  Senior  in
     High School.   I for one have long since become accustomed to the
     daily grind of getting up and going to work vs going to school.

     I  would  like to take this time to relate a few things to  those
     young  people who within the next few weeks will be walking  down
     the isle and receiving their diploma.

     You are the generation of progress.   You have within your  grasp
     the  ability  to excell where all of the other  generations  have
     come up short.   Many of you are into this world of communicating
     via  modem and computer terminals.   You should not be afraid  to
     take the one giant step for yourself,  as well as for mankind.  I
     beg  of you reach out and touch the fiber optics of reality.   Do
     not let your data sit idle and become someones old program  which
     is  spread  around as FREEWARE,  becuase the orginal  author  has
     either one gone on to bigger or better things.

     If  you  media becomes TRASHED,  then immediately seek out  fresh
     input and output means.   If your console is in  color,  remember
     some  of the rest of us see GREEN.   If your transmission rate is
     faster than some of us can receive, remember to cut your speed to
     match ours and do not leave us all behind.

     You  young people,  maybe our only mode of  expression,  and  our
     graphics  may  not  be in competition with  yours  but,  if  your
     harddisk  needs reformating or upgrading then by all means do so.
     If it is possible,  keep only those things which serve a  purpose
     and  go  on to those which you have a need to acquire.   When  it
     comes  to the end of your string,  and the EOF pounds  deep  into
     your programmed structure start all over again.

     So SENIORS OF 88.   It is now your time to take your place in the
     world of reality.   Never let it be said you could not handle all
     the  pressure  of  the moment.   Do not be afraid to  accept  the
     responsibility for your actions and remember this one thing above
     all.


                WE ARE IN THIS TO HAVE FUN!  IF IT IS NOT FUN
                IT IS NOT WORTH DOING.  WHEN IT BECOMES A PAIN
                TO PERFORM EVEN THE MOST MENIAL TASK IT IS
                TIME FOR YOU TO PURSUE ANOTHER PROGRAM.

     *For you SEAlink fans -- and I wish there were more -- note that
     when someone does an Xmodem upload on Opus, Opus incorrectly
     stores that upload in the logfile (and on the screen) as a
     SEAlink upload. (At least on our system it does).

     For general information, 135/1 has been up and down during the
     day and early evening with some major Hard Drive problems this
     last week. (We won't talk about the 800 users we lost passwords
     for). We will be getting a new drive.  As a result, our stats for
     this week are considerably less than usual.

     Thanks to 380/2 for sending in his download statistics.  If
     there are any other systems interested in having your download
     statistics included in this weekly column, please send me your
     system stats in a similar format via net-mail at 135/1.  The
     complete system report from LogRpt so I can include utilization
     reports would be ideal. If there are filenames that may not
     fully indicate what the file is, please let me know. If there is
     a file you particularly want me to list, let me know. I need to
     have the information by Monday's Net-mail time in order to get
     the stats compiled. Please keep your reports at 7 or 8 days,
     Friday to Friday if possible and no longer than 10 days. (We can
     accept net-mail anytime of the day and are PC-Pursuitable).
