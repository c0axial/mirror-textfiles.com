     Originally by Karl Schinke, Archduke of the ISA

     Well, We have bad news and We have good news.

     First, the bad news.

     While on a windjammer cruise of the West Indies, The Grand
     Wizard, Sir Ben Baker, was stricken with a heart attack.
     Fortunately, the vessel was in harbor at St. Barts, and Sir Ben
     was whisked to the small hospital there, and in short order to
     the Island of Guadalupe to a larger hospital.

     Now the good news.

     Sir Ben was discharged from the hospital this morning, and is
     resting comfortably in a hotel on Guadalupe.

     We tracked him down, brushing the rust off Our French language.
     Many thanks to the staff at the hospital for putting up with Our
     "fractured French".  We spoke with him, and he sounds well and
     in good spirit.  Lady Nora is with him, and they are remaining
     on the island for a while until he's gained enough strength to
     return.

     Our best wishes for speedy recovery go out to him, as We are
     sure do yours.  We will speak with him again in a few days, keep
     you posted.

     Thinking about Others During the Holidays

     Phil Buonomo, 1:107/583@FidoNet 520/583@AlterNet 9:807/1@PNet

     During this holiday season, many of us would like to be in a
     position to help others, but are just too busy, or can't make
     enough time to do the things we'd like.  Here is a very simple
     way that YOU can help someone NOW, and all it'll cost you is a
     postage stamp.

     Don't throw away your used Christmas/Chanuka cards.  They mean a
     lot to the children of St. Jude's Ranch for Children in Boulder
     City, NV.  They have a card-recycling program and would love to
     have your cards.

     Please take advantage of this simple way of helping others.
     Most people throw their used cards in the trash.  To the
     children of St. Jude's, thats the same as throwing money away.
     Please take a moment to take those cards off the wall, put them
     in an envelope, and send them in.  You'll feel better!

     So do some good, please, and help others have a happy holiday!

     Send your used cards to:

      St. Jude's Ranch for Children

          It has been brought to my attention I failed to provide a
     Net/Node Number for the Article about the Computer Information
     Monthly News Magazine, which will be here after refered to as a
     DISKzine.  So I would like to let all of you know the Node # is
     301/1.  The program is now FReq in both ARC and ZIP under the
     title of CIMN.ARC or CIMN.ZIP each month.  This will preclude
     requestors from having to remember which month they would like
     to have.  It will also be available in the previous mentioned
     versions of CIMN-V##.ARC OR CIMN-V##.ZIP for those who will
     be interested in back issues.

     *What  the  Hell is THIS!!!!!
     Jerry Hindle 1:123/7  (just a  user there)

          I believe that those of you who wrote this document need a
     little education in the finer art of politics. The main reason I
     say this is enumerated below on a paragraph by paragraph basis.
     I have cut the first part of the original article off as in it
     there was nothing that really matters since it was mostly
     definitions and such. What is left is what I am making comments
     on.

     Duplicate Message
     -----------------
          Because  of  the  technology  employed   by   some   FidoNet
     Conference   Mail   distribution   systems,    improper   routing
     information or topology can cause multiple  copies  of  the  same
     message  text  to  be  delivered to FidoNet systems.  A duplicate
     message is defined as any message  arriving  at  a  FidoNet  node
     whose  message  body (the text entered by the human originator of
     the message) is identical to the message  body  of  a  previously
     received   message.   Messages   manually  forwarded  to  another
     recipient are not considered duplicates for the purposes of  this
     document.

     *****************************************************************


     While I agree that duplicates are a major headache in echomail, I
     do not see why you seem to think that FidoNet is free of dupes. A
     look at the backbone systems logs will show that this is far from
     true. While you say here that it is up to the other network to
     keep duplicate messages from entering Fidonet, what is Fidonet
     going to do to keep dupes from entering the other network (which
     is a more realistic threat in my view)??????

     Section 3 - Administrative Guidelines
     =====================================

          This section  is  intended  to  outline  the  administrative
     framework  under  which  Other  Networks  may connect to FidoNet.
     FidoNet reserves the right to reject any  Other  Network  Gateway
     application for any reason.

     And just who died and appointed you the ruler of the universe???
     Hummm I for one have no desire to connect to FidoNet for echomail
     (in fact I do not carry a FidoNet address simply because FidoNet
     "decided" that independent nodes had no reason for existence and
     my node number was "abolished". You want me to agree to this crap
     simply so you can talk to me, ha, I can already send mail to any
     node within fidonet and I don't even need a fidonet address for
     that. If you wanna reply I suggest you figure out a way to connect
     to us without all this legalize mumbo-jumbo. Remember we are a
     HOBBY network and if it takes this to run a hobby then I want no
     part of it.

     3.1 - Other Network Connectivity to FidoNet Through "MultiNets"
     ---------------------------------------------------------------
          FidoNet may elect to seek and obtain connectivity to various
     multinet host facilities for the purposes of communicating with a
     wide  range of Other Networks.  Any Other Network that desires to
     communicate  with  FidoNet   may   elect   to   facilitate   such
     communication  via  the multinet.  However,  FidoNet reserves the
     right to refuse to deliver incoming message traffic arriving  via
     such  an  arrangement based upon the guidelines set forth in this
     document.

     Does this mean what I think it means......ie you want more then
     one gateway to any particular network. Well then the reverse is
     true, the other network should have the right to "turn down" this
     request if they feel it is not necessary.

     An Example:

          FidoNet is now gated into Internet via UUCP.  It has  agreed
     to  the  terms  and  conditions  necessary  for membership in and
     connectivity  to  the  Internet  multi-network  "umbrella".   One
     obvious method for achieving connectivity to FidoNet (and a whole
     host  of  other  wide  area networks) is for the Other Network to
     apply to Internet for a gateway.  Under this scenario,  the Other
     Network  is bound by the terms and conditions of Internet just as
     FidoNet is.  In this peer relationship,  the terms and conditions
     stated in this document are used by FidoNet to determine if Other
     Network  message  traffic  arriving at a FidoNet/Internet gateway

     will be accepted into FidoNet.

     I don't see where FidoNet made UUCP sign an agreement to these
     rules....and I bet UUCP would tell FidoNet where to leap if you
     tried it too. In fact UUCP told FidoNet that if they wanted to
     tie in that FidoNet had to abide by "their" rules. I do not see
     FidoNet mandating the seenby,origin,addressing stuff to UUCP....
     why not????? Also if the message meets UUCP standards and FidoNet
     has agreed to accept those standards, then what gives Fidonet the
     right to refuse the message(s)?

     3.2 - Connectivity Only Through Mutually Recognized Gateways
     ------------------------------------------------------------
          While FidoNet has no desire to  inhibit  experimentation  or
     connectivity  between  consenting  systems  it  must maintain the
     technical  and   administrative   integrity   of   its   network.
     Henceforth,  FidoNet  will  not  permit  non-FidoNet addresses to
     appear in any addressing or routing control fields (Some  current
     examples  include:  the  "From"  or  "To" address fields,  the "*
     Origin" lines, the "seen-by" fields, and the "^APath" fields.) of
     any netmail or echomail messages  traveling  on  any  portion  of
     FidoNet's  wide  area  network.  This  restriction applies to all
     present and future FidoNet  nodes.  FidoNet  nodes  who  wish  to
     participate  in Other Networks may do so but must insure that all
     message traffic transmitted to other FidoNet systems contain only
     valid FidoNet addresses in the  addressing  and  routing  control
     fields.  The  FidoNet  coordinators will enforce this requirement
     and are authorized  by  the  International  Coordinator  to  take
     whatever action may be necessary to prevent non-FidoNet addresses
     from  entering Fidonet,  including without limitation,  referring
     the offending nodes to this  document  and  to  the  InterNetwork
     Coordinator  for information on how to establish proper Gateways.
     The sole exception to  this  requirement  is  set  forth  in  the
     following paragraph:


          The exchange of  message  traffic,  on  an  experimental  or
     private  and  closely controlled basis,  between an Other Network
     and a system or systems that happen to be members of  FidoNet  is
     permitted  and  encouraged if such message traffic is confined to
     the consenting FidoNet systems and is not allowed to travel on or
     to any portion of  FidoNet's  wide  area  network  that  has  not
     previously   consented   to   carry  such  traffic  and  if  such
     connectivity  does  not  prohibit  the  FidoNet  system(s)   from
     fulfilling  the  technical  and policy requirements necessary for
     membership in FidoNet.  FidoNet requests that the INC be informed
     of such arrangements so that any unintentional "leakage" of Other
     Network message traffic into FidoNet's wide area network  may  be

     rapidly isolated and corrected.

          The  exchange  of  message traffic between any Other Network
     and FidoNet on any basis other than  the  one  mentioned  in  the
     paragraph  above  shall  only be done through mutually recognized
     and proper Gateways meeting the requirements set  forth  in  this
     document.

     AHA! Here's the real "meat" of the whole thing. Echomail control
     fields. I can understand the TO:/FROM: fields needing changing.
     In fact they are routinely changed by the echomail processors from
     one node to the next. I might also be convinced that the ^APATH
     line might need to be pruned back to just the gateway system. I DO
     NOT HOWEVER SEE ANY NEED TO STRIP THE SEENBYS DOWN since they are
     not used by anyone other then humans. They are not used in any form
     of addressing. They are used to control dupes by some of the echo-
     mail processors however and should be left alone so they can do
     what they were intended to do....specifically control dupes. I
     "might" also see where an Origin Line might need changing, BUT ONLY
     the Net Node number in the () needs changing nothing else. From the
     looks and reading of the above paragraph it appears as though
     FidoNet is scared to admit that "other networks" even exist (we do)
     and that by "sticking your collective heads in the sand" FidoNet
     can "make them go away (we won't).

     3.4 - Application of FidoNet Administrative Policy
     --------------------------------------------------
          For  the  purposes of applying FidoNet policy,  FidoNet will
     view the entire Other Network as a single  FidoNet  "node"  under
     the  control  of  the  individual  named  as  the "Administrative
     Contact / Responsible Party" (or an authorized agent thereof)  in
     the  administrative  agreement  outlined  in paragraph 3.3 above.
     All other systems and their users will be viewed  by  FidoNet  as
     users  on  the  "responsible  party's"  node  for the purposes of
     FidoNet official policy application.


          FidoNet holds the operator of  a  FidoNet  node  responsible
     (from  an  administrative  policy  standpoint) for the actions of
     that node's users,  subordinate "point" systems,  and the "point"
     system's  users.  FidoNet  views single or multiple Other Network
     Gateways as a  single  "boss"  node  under  the  control  of  the
     "responsible  party"  and  will  apply  FidoNet  official  policy
     accordingly.  FidoNet reserves the right to sever links to one or
     more of the Other Network's Gateways  as  its  final  remedy  for
     violations  of  administrative policy.  (see the paragraph titled
     "Points" in the  "Overview"  section  and  the  paragraph  titled
     FidoNews 7-02                Page 8                    8 Jan 1990


     "Responsible  for  All  Traffic Entering FidoNet Via the Node" in
     the "Sysop  Procedures"  section  of  FidoNet's  official  policy
     document, for further information).

     Does the "internetwork coordinator" in FidoNet have the power
     to remove from fidonet any node who refuses to abide by your
     policy??? Nope...They can only file "policy complaints" and
     even at that the past track record of Fidonet is such that
     a policy complaint is fast becoming the local joke. Also if
     a node in another network violates fidonet policy and is
     removed where does the other network policy come into play?
     What happens to a fidonet node that violates the policy in
     the other network? Does that violation carry the same weight
     as a violation of FidoNet policy even though there may be no
     rule against it within FidoNet. If FidoNet truly wants to
     be fair about all this then the same set of rules need to be
     applied to both sides of the equation (even Algebra teachers
     will tell you this).

     3.5 - Supported Message Types
     -----------------------------



          FidoNet  will grant Gateway interconnection for the purposes
     of exchanging messages of the type defined above as "Netmail" and
     optionally for the purposes of exchanging messages  of  the  type
     defined  above  as  "Echomail".  FidoNet  will  not grant Gateway
     interconnection for the purposes of exchanging  "Echomail"  only.
     The ability to generate a private and personal "Netmail" reply to
     an  "Echomail"  message is one of the basic facets of FidoNet and
     cannot be compromised.

     This I agree completely with. EchoMail Only gateways are a true
     waste of time. If they have room for processing echomail then
     they have room for processing a few netmail messages too.....

     ----------------------------------------------
          The granting of Other Network Gateways into FidoNet  is  not
     automatic  nor  is it based solely on the Other Network's ability
     to demonstrate technical compliance with the objectives set forth
     in section 4 below.  Some other criteria include:

     Why are you limiting other networks. After all to get into FidoNet
     to begin with all a node need do is sent a netmail message a be
     able to recieve a reply. Why should you be any harsher on networks
     since you stated earlier that the entire network would be treated
     as a point net off of the gateway system.

     3.8 - Shared Echomail Conferences
     ---------------------------------
          Echomail   conferences   shared  between  networks  must  be
     registered with the appropriate FidoNet echomail coordinator.  It
     is the responsibility of  the  Other  Network  and  its  Echomail
     source(s)  within  FidoNet  to  insure  that  proper  topology is
     observed between the FidoNet / Other Network Gateway(s) and  that
     duplicate  echomail  messages do not enter FidoNet.  It cannot be
     overemphasized that all message traffic emanating from a  Gateway
     must  contain  only  valid  FidoNet  addresses  in  the message's
     addressing and routing fields.  Current examples include, without
     limitation,  the "from" and "to" addresses in the message header,
     the  *ORIGIN  line address,  the SEEN BY addresses and the ^APath
     addresses.

     Now this is pure bull, plain and simple. Dupes are more likely to
     emenate from FidoNet to the other network then from the other net-
     work back to FidoNet. Also as I stated earlier these "rules" are
     for the most part an attempt by fidonet to "stick their head in
     the sand" to make other networks "go away".

     3.9 - Network Integrity
     -----------------------
          In the event that FidoNet determines that  significant  harm
     is  being  caused  to  the  technical  or social integrity of its
     network, it may immediately sever links between the Other Network
     Gateway(s)  and  FidoNet.   FidoNet  will  make  all   reasonable
     attempts  to  contact the "Responsible Party" as soon as possible
     (before the severing of links if possible) to  inform  the  Other
     Network of the problem and to work toward its resolution.

                            END OF QUOTED SECTION
     *****************************************************************

     Social integrity??????  I see that FidoNet has finally adopted
     the "holier then thou" attitude officially. FidoNet could not be
     socially harmed since in order for it to be "socially harmed" it
     would first need to be social, which FidoNet, by simply writing
     this "document" has proved it is not...

     Well, that is all I have to say on this matter. I for one will be
     the absolute first to veto any attempt to "gateway" to fidonet if
     it is to be done under the above referenced document as it is
     published in FidoNews Issue # 651. I feel that, as I stated, if
     FidoNet wants to dictate the entire show....I DON'T NEED IT !!!

     I think some serious thought should be given by FidoNet to write
     a set of rules that are fair and equitable to BOTH sides of the
     gateway(s) and not slanted so much toward this "it's my ball and
     we will play by my rules" attitude that FidoNet seems to have
     adopted of late. This is the end of the eightys....let's make it
     the end of the "me generation" also.....OK?

     PS:  for those who really wish to flame me personally I do have a
     mail system up and running 24hrs a day. The phone number is:

     1-901-683-5410 and it is 9600bps with an HST using SEAdog 4.51a

     if you just wanna flame me in fidonews.....go ahead I really don't
     care. I amy or may not read it. I will read any and all netmail and
     if you are in zone 1 I will even reply via netmail, that is if your
     system allows mail from "unlisted nodes". If your system does not
     allow this feature then you miss out on half of the fun in this
     HOBBY, mail from the unexpected. Bill Paul (sysop of the THINK
     TANK  1:123/7 is simply acting as a system for fidonews to
     contact me should they need to before publication of this article.

                             SIGnet and Other Networks
                             -------------------------


                         (or: Are We Getting Squeezed Out?)




     I've been seeing comments flying around like 'who owns the
     echomail?', 'does anyone OWN the echomail?', 'does a gate have
     to be authorized?', 'can the mail be ported out?', 'does policy
     really mean what it says?'...

     With the proposed InterNetwork GateWay Policy being currently
     tossed about, these questions are flying fast and furious, and
     they seem to be getting a little more furious.

     About 8 months ago, I started a network called SIGnet.  Its
     basic purpose was to bring echomail in that the local FidoNet
     network couldn't.   It was created as a supplement to the
     already existing FidoNet mail flow in my local area.   The
     concept of SIGnet quickly caught on and grew to be nearly 200
     systems within a few months.   The mail flow has been VERY
     tightly controlled and never has there been a single complaint
     about duplicate messages from us yet.   When the year turned
     over, I look at my report and saw that as the SIGnet
     International GateHost, I had passed-on just over 100,000
     echomail messages in less than 3 months.  Out of that, my system
     nabbed about 70 dupes.  Not bad.

     As I see things happening, our sources of echomail are going to
     be drying up rather quickly unless EVERYONE in SIGnet has a
     FidoNet number.   Well, it just so happens that not everyone in
     SIGnet wants one to be in FidoNet, or for that matter, sees a
     need for the extra administrative or technical problems caused
     by being multi-network.

     I fail to see the problems with the current policy regarding
     gating mail.   Policy 4 (v4.07) states in 2.1.3 that a sysop is
     responsible for all traffic entering FidoNet via the node.
     What was wrong with this?    If I choose to gate mail into
     SIGnet from FidoNet and port mail back out, what is the big
     problem?

     A couple of days ago, I met with the local honchos of FidoNet in
     my area to discuss this whole arrangement with echomail.   It
     turned out that we could better each other's arrangments by
     cooperating with each other so long as I, as the gateway system,
     conformed to policy.  The meeting went well and everyone went
     away happy and not feeling compromised.
     FidoNews 7-02                Page 13                   8 Jan 1990


     It seems that this policy is a muscle-flex and will shake off
     the 'other networks'.   Why can't we face the fact that the
     'other networks' are here stay and may not be politically
     motivated?   Some of us aren't!    We can't FidoNet see (like
     the locals here do) that some of the 'other networks' may be
     able to better things and with cooperation, everyone is better
     off?

     Recently there were a couple of incidents whereas there was a
     system in at least 5 different networks that was committing
     questionable acts via his node numbers.   Each network was
     building a case against him and had no idea about the actions of
     the other networks around him.  I proposed at the time, that we
     form a committee of the 'heads' of the 'other networks' to
     address these issues and other inter-network issues.  I have
     gotten favourable response from nearly everyone.  FidoNet
     appears to want to go this one alone.   IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!
     I am planning to continue with the forming of this committee,
     with or without the involvement of FidoNet.   I can only hope
     that we can act together on this.

     Is FidoNet's InterNetwork Policy really for the better of all
     sysops or is FidoNet running with its tail between its legs?
     Only time will tell.   I hope that a vote comes to be on this
     issue and that the sysops of FidoNet realize that you can catch
     more flies with honey than with acid.
