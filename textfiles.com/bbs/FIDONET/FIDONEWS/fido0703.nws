                             The PARALEGAL Echo

     Some of you who have checked the echos that are available on the
     backbone since the first of the year may have noticed the new
     PARALEGAL echo.  This echo is (primarily) for legal assistants,
     paralegals and others who work as support staff for attorneys.

     I've felt that it is important for paralegals to have a place to
     meet and share ideas.  Our concerns are sometimes very much
     different than those of the attorney's we might work for.  This
     may be surprizing, since a paralegal today will do almost
     everything that an attorney does except to represent a client in
     court.  In fact, in a largely "paperwork practice" such as wills
     and estates, an attorney will likely sign on as representation,
     and then turn the whole estate over to the paralegal to
     administer.

     In many areas a paralegal has more experience than an attorney.
     This works out best for everyone as it allows the attorney to do
     what s/he does best, while the paralegal does what s/he does
     best.

     The PARALEGAL echo hopes to bring together those who work in the
     profession to share our problems and experiences.  The echo
     originates from 1:226/180 and is on the backbone.  NetMail to
     either 1:226/70 or 1:226/180 will get to me should you have any
     questions.  I am happy to be the moderator of this echo, and hope
     that all participants will have an enjoyable time.

     Why Does FidoNet Dislike Othernets?
     ===================================

        Perhaps FidoNet doesn't have a problem with Othernets.
     Perhaps certain MEMBERS of FidoNet have problems with Othernets.
     Although I cannot for the life of me think why.

        My name is Joe Lindstrom.  I run "Farpoint Station VHST" BBS
     here in Calgary Alberta Canada.  My node numbers are shown above,
     the last two are administrative numbers denoting my
     responsibilities as Net Echo Coordinator for Net 7500 and as
     Regional Coordinator for Region 75 (Canada + Alaska).

        In FidoNews Issue 651, an article by Tim Pearson of node
     1:286/703 appeared.  It focused on a new document called the
     InterNetwork Gateway Policy.  His article and the Policy itself
     are SEVERELY flawed, and operate on the basis that FidoNet is the
     ONLY TRUE NETWORK and that all others are merely sham,
     fly-by-night operations.  The following appeared near the bottom
     of page 6:

     "The problem is compounded when more than one other network
     attempts to use the same illicit zone number."

        Why is a zone number not used by FidoNet deemed "illicit"?
     Are we members of othernets criminals of some variety?  And if
     so, what is our crime?  Refusal to think of FidoNet as "the only
     way to fly"?

        This policy attempts to "smoke one past us" (sorry, I rented
     "Weekend At Bernie's" last night).  On the surface, it appears to
     openly embrace othernets, and seems to want to implement a policy
     that will further the goal of more open communications between
     FidoNet and othernets.  As anyone here in Calgary can tell you,
     this has been MY fervent goal for quite some time.  As an
     example, I can point to a few "shared" echo conferences between
     FidoNet Net 134 and The Network Net 7500.  We will, hopefully,
     reach an agreement whereby we'll be allowing existing echoes to
     be distributed by the opposite Net.  Obviously, policies
     regarding echo content and particularly a dispute mechanism must
     be in place before we can take that step, but we are working on
     it.  Unfortunately, the Internetwork Gateway Policy threatens to
     throw a monkey wrench into the whole deal.

        In the paragraph "Administrative Objectives", Tim's article
     laments the lack of accountability.  If a user in The Network
     behaves unruly in a FidoNet echo, how does FidoNet correct the
     problem?  The policy's solution is to appoint one person to serve
     as the "official network gateway", to be fully responsible for
     the actions of the members of his network.  Period.  The othernet
     is relegated to the role of glorified POINTNET.  And THAT is why
     we gotta talk about it (to quote Kevin Pollak).
     FidoNews 7-03                Page 3                   15 Jan 1990


        First off, the policy states that "FidoNet reserves the right
     to reject any Other Network Gateway application for any reason."
     This can, and probably will, be applied to networks that are in
     some way "undesirable" to the Internetwork Coordinator.  FidoNet
     and Alternet have been at odds many times, is Alternet to be
     disqualified because of this?  "FOR ANY REASON", it says.

        It gets better.  "Henceforth, FidoNet will not permit
     non-FidoNet addresses to appear in any addressing or routing
     control fields (some current examples include: the 'From' or 'To'
     address fields, the '* Origin' lines, the 'seen-by' fields, and
     the '^APath' fields.) of any netmail or echomail messages
     traveling on any portion of FidoNet's wide area network.

        Excuse me for asking... but who the hell CARES what node
     number is on the PATH line!?  As I recall, the PATH lines show
     the actual path taken by this message, and that REMOVING nodes
     from that path was against echo policy.  How exactly is anyone
     being hurt by this, or by an othernet address appearing anywhere
     else in a message?

        If an othernet address appears, it's probably because the node
     does not have a FidoNet address.  He ain't in your nodelist.  So
     you probably ain't gonna get a reply sent to him directly, no
     matter what scheme these Internetwork Policy makers come up with,
     short of a radical new method of moving the mail.  The policy,
     therefore, outlaws such node numbers, effectively removing such
     nodes from FidoNet echo conferences.  Hey, if they want FidoNet
     echo conferences they should join FidoNet, right?

        After taking great pains to convince us that FidoNet wants to
     impose no policies on members of othernets, it proceeds to do
     just that.  What's the scoop here?

        And here I was, naively believing that this Policy wanted to
     SMOOTH the path of mail between two networks.  Instead, all I see
     are obstacles.  Need I point out that some folks are unable or
     unwilling to join FidoNet?  For example, I'm the NEC for Net 7500
     in The Network (incidentally, for the record, we're Zone 8, and
     have been for a longer period of time than RBBS-NET has).  I feed
     about 25 or so nodes here their mail, owing to the fact that I
     have an HST modem and that I was one of the founding members of
     this network and kinda inherited the job.  Of these, 6 or 7 are
     "private" nodes.  That is, they are listed in the nodelist but do
     not have a dial-in telephone number.  They do not observe the
     ZMH, but rather poll me regularly for my mail.  Essentially, a
     glorified point.  Now, under this plan, these people will have to
     find a willing bossnode in Net 134 if they wish to continue
     getting FidoNet echo conferences.  Why?  Because I have a FidoNet
     node number.  I'm their feed.  I'm soon going to be ineligle to
     feed them because, as a member of both networks, I will not be
     allowed to get FidoNet echomail from my Network feed.  I will be
     expected - nay, required - to get my Fidonet echomail from a
     FidoNet source.  So they'll have to find another feed, and the
     only other HST's in Net 7500 also have dual identities, so this
     alternate feed will have to be a 2400 baud one, thereby
     FidoNews 7-03                Page 4                   15 Jan 1990


     multiplying their costs by a factor of six.  They cannot join
     FidoNet themselves because they can't observe ZMH.  In other
     words, they're screwed.  FidoNet is slipping them the cold steel.

        Here's an interesting paragraph, bottom of page 16:
     "Given the above advantages (of joining BOTH networks), the FTN
     Other Network must provide evidence of overriding technical or
     social considerations, must show cause why these considerations
     justify the establishment of a Gateway instead of merely allowing
     its individual nodes to use the 'dual identity' approach, and
     must satisfy FidoNet that such an arrangement will be mutually
     beneficial."

        Again, we're faced with "join FidoNet, or provide a damned
     good explanation of why we should allow you to participate in our
     echoes via a different source".

        Let me explain something.  Right now, The Network gets a GREAT
     deal of FidoNet echomail.  Messages coming in from FidoNet are
     modified slightly, as are messages going out.  On an outbound
     message, my origin line looks something like this:

     --- ZmailQ V1.10 @8:7500/55.0
      * Origin: Farpoint Station VHST (8:7500/55.0)

     Once it hits our gateway, presently Bob Hoffman at 1:129/34 aka
     8:70/0, it gets changed as follows:

     --- ZmailQ V1.10 @8:7500/55.0 & No-Origin v3.6f
      # Origin: Farpoint Station VHST (8:7500/55.0)
      * Origin: The Network - G Rated Family Oriented (1:129/34.0)

        No fuss, no muss, it works and works well.  If you gotta send
     me a reply, then do so and route it to 129/34.  The fact that I
     COULD get the same echomail from a FidoNet source IS IRRELEVANT.
     Even now, without this new policy, we've been operating under the
     assumption that Bob is responsible for messages generating in The
     Network, and has on occasion had to remove users from FidoNet
     conferences.  I myself have removed users from conferences on two
     occasions, after being asked to do so by the conference
     moderators.  No problem, I understood THAT going in.

        So along comes this new policy which, logically, asks for all
     these things, yet at the same time actively encourages that FTN
     Othernets join FidoNet as an "aka"?  Failure to do so means you
     can't get your FidoNet echomail from your Zone Coordinator (Bob
     Hoffman), so I will soon be left with the choice of either
     resigning my position as NEC of Net 7500 (thereby screwing a lot
     of local nodes) or resigning my FidoNet node number (thereby
     screwing MYSELF and a lot of local nodes).

     FidoNews 7-03                Page 5                   15 Jan 1990


        There was nothing WRONG with the existing setup.  But along
     comes FidoNet, who, like engineers, like to change things.
     Whether they need changing or not.  The result of this Policy is
     that The Network is teetering on the brink of utter collapse.
     Bob Hoffman has issued a letter to all nodes stating that by
     January 15th 1990, all Network nodes must either drop their
     FidoNet aka's or be disconnected from FidoNet mail feeds.  He
     didn't want to make this choice, and in fact has always tried to
     keep his nose OUT of our business.  Network nodes are cutting
     their Network ties and going FidoNet-only.  FidoNet nodes are
     cutting their FidoNet ties and going Network-only.  This whole
     thing is POLARIZING us, not bringing us together!!

        So as a member of The Network and as a member of FidoNet, I
     state that the Internetwork Gateway Policy, in its present form,
     does far more damage to me and you than any previous FidoNet
     policy to date.  It is draconian, restrictive, and shows a desire
     on the part of FidoNet to control all network activities, be they
     FidoNet or Othernet.

        All is not, however, lost.  With a bit of work, and a heap of
     respect for othernets, this policy COULD be reworked into
     something we can live with.  I'm already living with something
     SIMILAR to it.  I would suggest that the authors of this policy
     consult with Bob Hoffman and find out exactly what it is we're
     doing here that works so well, and USE IT.  Don't fix what ain't
     broke.

        Failing that, I strongly urge that the issue be put to a vote
     of all nodes.  A failure to win a clear majority consensus would
     indicate a preference for the status quo.

        Do you really believe FidoNet will go for that, especially
     with the "no vote means vote no" policy used in the IFNA vote?  I
     don't, but maybe they'll surprise me.

        I have been working very hard to tear a few holes in the
     Berlin Wall that seperates us.  Here in Calgary, the issue was
     compounded by the fact that when Net 7500 was formed, it was
     comprised of many "undesirable" nodes (that Net 134 wanted
     nothing to do with).  It is a credit to BOTH Nets that we've
     managed to get a bit of cooperation, and an upcoming vote in Net
     134 will determine how far that cooperation is extended.  I'm
     confident that they will wish to continue with the echo sharing
     we're doing here.  The feeling here is that there are good people
     in both nets, and that your preference of network should be
     viewed the same as your preference for BBS software, mailer,
     etc., that being one of personal preference only.  We should not
     discourage communications just because we happen to use different
     zone numbers.  I sincerely hope that this feeling is prevalent
     throughout FidoNet, because I don't want to leave it.  But if
     leave it I must, then leave it I shall.  It's your choice.

        If you feel as I do, contact your *EC and MAKE YOUR FEELINGS
     KNOWN!  Tell him or her that you feel the Internetwork Gateway
     Policy is restrictive and destructive, and should not be adopted
     in its current form.  It will prevent you from talking to many
     people in othernets, who will simply not stand for this garbage
     and will stop participating in your favorite echo conferences.
     This hurts us ALL, each and every one of us.

     Sincerely,

     [~] Joey Philip Lindstrom, Sysop 1:134/55 & 8:7500/55 [~]

                             99:9100/35

     In the 651 issue of FidoNews, Tim Pearson 1:286/703 presented
     an article regarding the adoption of an InterNetwork Policy.
     Since then I have read several messages about this proposed
     policy and have given consideration to it as well as some of its
     ramifications.

     In the 652 issue of FidoNews, Jack Decker 1:154/9 replied to
     specific points of the document as well as the intent of the
     FidoNet members who have proposed this policy.

     I have also read several messages in various echos which are
     discussing some of the ramifications of this proposed policy.

     Well now it's my turn.

     As you can see from my byline, I am a member of probably the 4
     most commonly recognized FTNs. I joined these nets in an effort
     to be able to communicate more readily with as many SysOps as I
     could here in Austin. In Austin we have an organization named the
     Central Texas SysOps Association (CTSA). The CTSA is a rather
     lame organization whose sole purpose in life seems to be nothing
     more than to bring SysOps together once a month to meet, discuss
     BBS related topics, and go to the local IHOP (International House
     Of Pancakes) for a snack.

     Anyway, not all members of the CTSA are members of FidoNet, but
     they are members of OtherNets. So, to keep in touch via netmail
     and echomail with my fellow local SysOps, I joined all of the
     various nets here in Austin.

     So now I get 4 nodediff/nodelists every week (plus I add in an
     old RBBSNet nodelist just for completeness). When I last watched
     my Parselst batch program run, the statistics claimed just over
     8,000 unique nodes. Hmmmm. Of that number about 6,000 were
     FidoNet. Simple statistics indicate that about %75 are FidoNet,
     and about %25 are OtherNets. In my book, %25 is non-trivial.

     Now, when I run the QSORT program, the statistics tell me that
     there are just somewhat over 4,000 unique SysOps in these nets.
     That seems to indicate that a good percentage of FidoNet SysOps
     desire membership in other networks in addition to FidoNet
     itself. Maybe their reasons are the same as mine, maybe they
     aren't. It doesn't matter what the reasons. It just matters that
     for some reason FidoNet SysOps want to belong to ADDITIONAL
     networks.

     One thing that I noticed in all this is that unless the actual
     zone was duplicated, there was no duplication of net/node
     numbers. (RBBSNet and Network share zone 8, so 8:1/0 was a
     duplicate last I checked). Anway, the point I am trying to make
     here is that there is a very valid argument to combine every
     node number from every net into a single nodelist. The list
     could be broken into blocks, or domains (as some people have
     started calling them).

     The most recent attempt at this was the OPCN. I viewed the OPCN
     as basically a phone book of nodes.

     One of the arguments for the need to implement the InterNet gates
     is that people want to be able to send netmail in response to
     echomail. Also that echo moderators want to be able to have
     control and have accountability on the part of all participants.
     IE: if a message is entered by a node which has a node number
     unknown to a reader, then the node which originated the message
     is not accountable and should be.

     I felt that the OPCN list would satisfy this concern. IE: if all
     nodes in all nets were included in this list, then everyone would
     be able to communicate with everyone else.

     Alas the OPCN was met with tremendous opposition. So it is pretty
     much evident that even though we have the ability to support this
     method of addressing the situation with a single nodelist
     solution, too many people are opposed to it. In my mind it was
     more a political issue rather than a technical (or technological)
     issue.

     So now we are left with having to figure out a way to allow each
     network to maintain it's autonomy. Rather than a single nodelist,
     we have (had) to find a way to get all of the individual nets to
     communicate in a method which was consistent, effective and
     technologically possible, ie: which could be done with current
     software rather than having to develop an entirely new generation
     of software.

     So here comes the the InterNetwork Gateway Policy Committee. I
     truly believe that this committee has the best interests of all
     networks at heart and was endeavoring to develop a method
     whereby all of the nets could communicate in a coherent and
     consistent manner.

     Now, the FidoNews article itself was about 42k characters in
     length. A little utility I have analysed this article and the
     proposed policy and my little utility claims that there are 5092
     words, in 205 sentences, with an average of 24.8 words per
     sentence with an average of 5.3 characters per word yielding a
     document which requires a reader to have an 18th grade education
     to understand properly. Whew!

     Now in all that, I found just 3 sections which I oppose, request
     clarification to, or request modication of. For brevity I am
     just excerpting the pertinent fragments from each article. Here
     we go:

     3.2 - Connectivity Only Through Mutually Recognized Gateways
     ------------------------------------------------------------

     Henceforth,  FidoNet  will  not  permit  non-FidoNet addresses to
     appear in any addressing or routing control fields (Some  current
     examples  include:  the  "From"  or  "To" address fields,  the "*
     Origin" lines, the "seen-by" fields, and the "^APath" fields.) of
     any netmail or echomail messages  traveling  on  any  portion  of
     FidoNet's  wide  area  network.

     ------------------------------------------------------------

     Since SeenBys are non-'active' information as far as the actual
     delivery of the mail is concerned, I feel that including your AKA
     in a SeenBy is acceptible. ie: Suppose you enter an echo
     mail message in a multinet echo such as SYSOP. Suppose a person
     wants to netmail you a reply, but your primary node number is in
     EggNet while his is in Network. Now suppose both of you are also
     members of FidoNet, but it is not your primary network. If the
     AKA's were in the SeenBys, then it would be possible for the
     person who wants to netmail you a reply to do so directly via
     the net common to both of you, FidoNet in this case.

     Also, as moderator of the Telix echo, sometimes I wish to do a
     topography analysis. I have a utility which will read the Origin
     and SeenBy lines of echomail and produce a sorted listing of
     the nodes which the echo traverses. If the node numbers
     subordinate to the internet gate are stripped, then I cannot get
     an accurate topography of the echo.

     3.7 - Other Criteria (FTN Other Networks)
     -----------------------------------------

          Given the above  advantages,  the  FTN  Other  Network  must
     provide    evidence    of    overriding   technical   or   social
     considerations,  must show cause why these considerations justify
     the  establishment  of  a  Gateway instead of merely allowing its
     individual nodes to use the "dual identity"  approach,  and  must
     satisfy  FidoNet  that  such  an  arrangement  will  be  mutually
     beneficial.

     -----------------------------------------

     Now just what the heck is this supposed to mean anyway?
     'Overriding technical or social considerations'?? What kind of
     doublespeak is this? I think that this needs to be eliminated or
     reworded in such a way as to eliminate the complete ambiguity of
     the statement.

     FidoNews 7-03                Page 10                  15 Jan 1990


     4.4 - FidoNet to Other Network Addressing (Netmail)
     ---------------------------------------------------

     FidoNet  netmail arriving at a Gateway with improper
     Other Network addressing information must either be corrected and
     forwarded to the proper Other Network address or returned to  the
     FidoNet  sender  with text inserted notifying the sender that the
     message was undeliverable.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Hmmm. This is interesting. Does FidoNet agree to reciprocate in
     kind? IE: if I send a netmail message to the Zone 3 Zonegate and
     it is of an improper format, will the zonegate notify me?

     Using a US Mail example: If I send a letter to someone, but I
     address it incorrectly, the post office will either forward it if
     possible ie: in the case of them having a forwarding order on
     file, or they will return it to me. Depending on the class of
     mail, sometimes the post office will bill be for returning the
     undeliverable letter back to me.

     The difference between Netmail and US Mail is that when I place
     a stamp on the envelope, I have purchased services from the US
     Postal service. When I make a phone call to a Gateway, I have
     not paid the Gateway for anything. If I make a mistake, it is
     my responsibility. I feel it is unreasonable to require a
     member of an amateur net to incur additional expenses for the
     mistake of another individual.

     I would like to see this section modified in such a way that
     if a Gateway determines a netmail message to be unforwardable,
     that it create a HOLD message for the node which sent the
     erroneous message. If the sending node does not receive a
     reply in a reasonable amount of time, it would be his
     responsibility to contact the Gateway and obtain any HOLD
     messages. This puts the burden on the node which sends the
     undeliverable message.

     I also feel that it is not the responsibility of the Gateway
     to actually deliver the netmail message. All networks have a
     SysOp echo which all members of the network can/should subscribe
     to. I think that the Gateway should merely post a message in this
     echo stating that mail has arrived for node XXX.

     Thank you for your attention and consideration to this matter.

     Regards,
     Steve.

                            Quo Vadis, FidoNet?
                            -------------------

     The recent article by Tim Pearson and accompanying draft Inter-
     network Gateway Policy Document, Fido News 6:51 at 6, prompted me
     to release what is perhaps a diatribe in our local community open
     echo conference.  At the request of some local sysops, I rein-
     serted, my thoughts in the Net 285 sysops conference, and the
     NC 285 asked that I prepare this article for Fido News.  The NC
     indicated that he did not agree with all, or even most, of what I
     had said, but that criticism of any sort was preferable to blindly
     jumping over a cliff (well, he didn't put it /quite/ that way, I
     guess).

     This article will explain what my concerns are and then include a
     slightly edited text of the debate in our local echo.  I speak as
     one involved in telecommunications, as an operator, maintainer, and
     manager, for some twenty-plus years.  The last seven of them have
     been in, among other areas, personal computer communications
     (BBSes).  I apologize in advance for the length of the following,
     but after reviewing it I feel it sums up the debate, in the words
     of some of the participants, much better than I could.

     Please note that the concerns are NOT about the technical issues,
     such as duplicates in echomail, or smooth interoperability with
     other networks.  The real issues are how the current coordinators
     acceded to their positions, how they remain there, the management
     and personal attitudes they represent within and without FidoNet,
     and how subordinate sysops can, or cannot, replace a coordinator
     who has not violated policy, but in whom they no longer have
     confidence.

     Let me say at the outset that I consider the major issue facing
     Fido Net to be one of direction, both in the sense of where the
     network is headed and in the sense of who is heading the network.
     The recent turmoil over POLICY4, followed by the IFNA plebiscite,
     and now by the draft Gateway document, lead me to wonder if very
     many of the operators in FidoNet have given much thought lately to
     the nature and purpose of the network they belong to.  I have also
     wondered if the *C structure has done the same.  (The *C structure
     is a convenient shorthand for coordinators at all levels.  It is
     not pejorative in nature.)

     POLICY 4, in my own mind, started the current difficulties.
     Whether or not it represents sound policy, the *C structure adopted
     it outside of the recognized means.  The IFNA BOD didn't adopt it,
     nor did the network under the established process for amendment
     contained in POLICY 3.  From where I sat (assistant sysop and long-
     time user), the two most controversial changes were mandatory
     FidoNews 7-03                Page 13                  15 Jan 1990


     membership in the local net (instead of being an independent node)
     and the selection of coordinators.  In some cases, the exact number
     is unknown, most sysops in a network were forced into the network
     under POLICY 4.  As a result, they never had any meaningful input
     in the selection of the NC.  (I know this may start a rehash of the
     top-down v. bottom-up debate, but it's a real and valid concern.)

     To repeat what I said at the start of the last paragraph, the
     complaint has absolutely nothing to do with the wisdom of the
     policy changes.  The complaint is about the process of change and
     what it said to many of us about the nature of the *C structure.

     This arguably autocratic bureaucracy now apparently intends to
     force itself onto other networks, both "Fido Technology Networks"
     and others, even as the only legal structure for Fido Net is
     winding up operations.

     This begs the question, what happens next?  Does FidoNet, the
     network, continue as an unincorporated association, governed only
     by control of the nodelist?  How, if at all, can sysops and users,
     the heart of Fido Net, have a voice in its management?  Will the
     degeneration (and confusion) started by alternative networks,
     formed in response to perceived abuses by the *C structure,
     continue?

     As I say below, and as a fellow sysop says below, we need the *C
     structure.  Someone has to insure that the system operates in a
     technically acceptable manner.  Someone has to insure that
     addresses remain specific to the intended system.  Those someones,
     however, have to be responsive, and the sysops and users they serve
     have to perceive them as responsive.  The following discussion
     reflects some of the thoughts expressed recently in our local area.

     My Comments:

     FIDO702.NWS has an interesting non-cataloged article about the
     proposed Internet Gateway Policy which first appeared in
     FIDO651.NWS.

     I say non-cataloged, since the article is on page 4 but does
     not appear in the table of contents.

     While specifically addressed to the *C structure's proposed
     internet gateway policy document, the comments have broader
     applicability.  The same narrow-minded and short-sighted,
     arguably ego-tripping, conduct that led to the proposed
     gateway document may have led to the demise of the International
     Fido Net Associate (IFNA).

     Those of you who follow the "politics" have noted the recent
     vote on the future of IFNA.  The board of directors established
     that 50% of all listed nodes would have to vote "YES"
     to continue the organization.  Not even 50% voted, so even
     though an overwhelming majority of those voting supported the
     reorganization and continuation of IFNA, the vote failed.
     FidoNews 7-03                Page 14                  15 Jan 1990


     The Chairman of the IFNA Board, as required by the resolution
     from the previous meeting and as mandated by the results of
     the vote, has called a special board meeting for later this
     month to WIND UP THE AFFAIRS OF THE ASSOCIATION.  See the last
     page FIDO702.NWS, just following the "current systems"
     listing.

     Hey folks!  It's only a hobby.  Why and how did we get to this
     point?  I hate to think of the potential for abuse in the
     future by the self-appointed and self-perpetuating "*C"
     structure if the board really goes through with this.  Also,
     since IFNA owns the copyright and trademark to "FIDO," and we
     all use it by general permission and license from Tom
     Jennings, what happens legally, if not technically, in the
     future?

     I may just be a doom-sayer, but I see degeneration and anarchy
     if the *C's continue down their present path and no structured
     organization, such as IFNA, exists to stop them.

     It may be too late, but I encourage anyone who cares about the
     future of this HOBBY to contact a valid board member and
     suggest the vote was flawed, that the percentage of those
     voting should be sufficient to do it over in a manner that
     wasn't doomed to apathetic failure from the start.

     It's unfortunate, but there are **STILL** quite a few out
     there who put their own personal needs and interests ahead of
     the collective needs of the network as a whole.  That is the
     mentality that turned Fidonet into Fight-o-net and even though
     it's becoming unfashionable,it still persists.

     Although there were some improprieties that I know of, I don't
     think there was any wide-scale rigging.  Some that I have
     talked to are so p*ssed off at the whole scene that they
     refused to participate.  Also,in years past, the IFNA BOD (a
     term we seldom hear anymore) gained the same reputation that
     the current *C's have.  To some, anarchy was the lesser evil.

     A user commented:

     Will somebody tell me what the big deal is? When I started
     using these BBS'es, you people were doing all kinds of good
     things with your networking and your file transfer. Now all
     I hear is bickering and lawsuits and power-playing. If
     somebody wants to be an ass, just tell him to find somebody
     else's BBS to be an ass on. It's getting to be as bad as CB
     radio. When I call a new BBS I can tell in about 1 minute if
     it will be worth it. If the opening says "Welcome" and tells
     you about all the features, I'll stay and look around. If they
     start off with "Rules, NO this and NO that" then I figure the
     guy is on an ego-trip and just hang the heck up.

     I further commented:

     > ...all sorts of good things with your networking and file
     > transfers and stuff....

     Charlie, the problem is that the structure ("topology" is the
     current buzzword) that makes/lets it happen efficiently is,
     arguably, now controlled by the ego-tripping folks we can't
     seem to work with.  FidoNet is broken down into Zones (North
     America, Australia, Europe, etc.),Regions (Midwest, New
     England, whatever), Nets (Tri-City, here in Omaha)and finally
     Nodes (this BBS).  There are also things called Points, which
     FIDO tolerates but doesn't really like, since they normally
     aren't publicly accessible BBSes.  Current Policy is that the
     lowest form of life in FIDO is the Sysop and associated BBS.
     (Double entendre absolutely intentional.)  Thus, I operate
     more or less at the tolerance of the system as:

          |  |         in the traffic routing.  Their main contri-
          |  |         bution is in the (mis)management of the net)
          |----------- Zone 1 (North America)
     FidoNews 7-03                Page 16                  15 Jan 1990


     Each level above Sysop, i.e., Net, Region, and Zone, have
     Coordinators.The "*C" structure, since they are referred to
     as ZC, RC, and NC.

     The *C structure controls the NODELIST, which is how they get
     their power.  If you aren't in the NODELIST, other systems
     can't route to you and some systems won't accept incoming
     traffic from you.

     The current *C structure, in just enough places and at just
     enough levels, is extremely difficult for many (mere) sysops
     to work with.Imagine, to use your example, if EVERY BBS you
     called started the log-on screen with RULES, RULES, DEMANDS
     and RULES.  You wouldn't have any place to call.  If we are
     to continue to network, we have to comply with the demands of
     the *C structure or find a way around it.

     The battle has been for control of this structure, with the
     incumbents,controlling the NODELIST, wanting "top-down"
     organization, and many local sysops wanting "bottom-up"
     organization.  Several alternative networks have sprung up,
     and at least one attempt to issue an alternative nodelist with
     no rules at all.

     The technical problem is that the *C structure, at the least,
     deconflicts addressing conflicts.  There /is/ a valid reason
     for it to exist, and many, perhaps most, of the *Cs are good
     people, trying hard to do their(volunteer, unpaid) jobs and
     please both their sysops and their 'superior' *Cs.  But it
     doesn't take more than a few misguided RCs, or one or two ZCs,
     to ruin it all.

     The International FidoNet Association has been the legal
     structure for this network of hobbyists.  The recent plebiscite
     was directed by the IFNA Board of Directors to see if the
     association should continue.  At the present, it looks like
     it will cease operations, leaving FIDONET, the network, as an
     unincorporated association of individuals with only"POLICY"
     as rules.  That would make it a virtual fiefdom of the *C
     structure and further anarchy (and probably technical problems
     with the network) will likely follow.

     What does this mean to the average local BBS user?  Not much
     unless you do echomail, such as the CP/M Technical Echo on
     this BBS, or the Genealogy Echo on Friends, or the MJCN Echo
     on Firm Foundation, or the Amiga Echos, or ....  The routing
     for those is difficult enough at present, and it will probably
     get worse.  The NETMAIL, for those who use it, might get all
     messed up.

     Then maybe some of us are doomsayers and the net will continue
     to function perfectly--with sometimes self-appointed czars in
     charge.  Perestroika is succeeding in Eastern Europe, but
     failing in FIDONET Zone 1.

     A sysop replied:

     > The second is a reply from a user (remember them) ...

     We sysops (myself included, sometimes) tend to forget that
     it's really the USERS, and not us who make a BBS what it is.
     Carry this one level upward, and ...  Let's face it, without
     users, we are nothing.  If someone isn't operating his/her
     system to the benefit of the users,he/she might as well just
     pull the plug.  Everybody knows what happens when a sysop
     behaves like a jerk -- word gets out and he soon ends up
     counting his callers on one hand with fingers left over.

     Yes!  I know a lot of damn good people who are *C's in
     Fidonet.  Names such as George Peace, Fred Armantrout,
     Merrilyn Vaughan, and Ted Polczynski (sp?) come to mind
     immediately and there are others.These are people who will do
     almost anything to help another sysop,in his/her net or out
     of it, to keep things running smoothly.  I've had people such
     as these send me test messages (at their own expense)across
     the country to help get two modems talking, and send countless
     dumps and logs to help debug a quirky dupe-loop.  This is what
     a coordinator is supposed to be.  A lot of Fidonet sysops
     speak very highly of their coordinators, and they have good
     reasons for doing so.

     What seems like interminable *C bashing is not without cause,
     how-ever.  From what I have seen it's almost always aimed at
     those who abused their positions.  I would think that the *C's
     would want to apply a bit of peer pressure to those who do not
     operate toward the best interest of their networks.


                                CONCLUSION

     Well folks, there you have it.  My thesis is that the *C structure,
     for what I am sure were, to them, good reasons, has become
     nonsupportive of the network they serve.  They have forced
     managerial changes on the network, to the point where an overwhelm-
     ing majority said "the hell with it" in the IFNA vote.  Sysops who
     really care are joining alternative networks.  In response, the *C
     structure is floating more ideas to consolidate their power over
     whoever is left.

     I sincerely hope I've got it all wrong, but . . . .  I would
     appreciate knowing comments from those of you who have been around
     longer than I, who perhaps can put everything in a better perspec-
     tive.  Until then, Quo Vadis, Fido Net ?
