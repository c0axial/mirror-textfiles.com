     Subj: you know it never goes the way you expect
     ______________________________________________________________________

     the move itself wasn't too traumatic but the ensuing line probs have
     certainly put a crimp in my submissions collection for this week's
     FidoNews.

     i'm now doing a forced crash poll to all regular contributors and
     links just in case. the FidoNews will go out on schedule tomorrow,
     never fear.

     MaBell was late to do the install on Friday [naturally]. there were
     cross-connect probs somewhere down the block at the circuit bank and
     that took a couple more hours. then the movers were late getting here
     and i only just now got the computer room reassembled and wired when i
     discovered that the ready line reported Friday night now has a dead
     short in it somewhere outside the local hookup. [sigh]

     since there aren't any voice line jacks in any room other than the
     kitchen and master bedroom [that's what portable phones are for,
     right?] and they are both at the other end of the house, i had to sift
     thru the debris to find enuf 25' phone lines and inline adapters to
     make a 75' run from the kitchen to this machine. [grin]

     so, i'm crashing on my voice line and MaBell promises [again] that
     this will be cleared up by noon tomorrow [yeah, sure] without fail.
     then i can get incoming. i'm not going to leave the system up on the
     voice line after i get this traffic out in the next hour or so. i'll
     be inmodemcommunicado until tomorrow's line clearing. if they still
     screw it up, i'll ship out FidoNews here on the voice line again on
     time on glidepath. [snicker]

     sorry for the confusion. i hope everyone has their configs shifted
     over to my new Node number for session, Areafix, and Tick; not to
     mention the ZIP archive format for FidoNews starting with 1340.

     thanks.

     TTFN.

     1728, 29 Sep 96 update:

     [the above was sent to my regular contributors and FidoNews links when
      i got the kitchen 'extension' going so i could make some polls. the
      MaBell guy did show up this morning circa 0945. he checked outside
      for awhile and them came in and couldn't figure where the short was.
      he finally took off the jack cover. the previous installer had
     FIDONEWS 13-40               Page 3                   30 Sep 1996


      checked the line for continuity BEFORE he mounted the jack but not
      afterward. the line was working right up till the point where he
      pinned the incoming pair with the MOUNTING SCREW while sticking the
      jack on the wall. [sigh]

      the end result was FidoNews reconnected the normal way. all is well.
      the rest of the move will be in an article next week. [grin]]

     Music in Fidonet
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     From time to time, I will be looking at echo lists from various parts
     of Fidonet around the world, and bringing together echoes which have a
     subject or theme in common.  In this, the first of such articles, I
     have chosen music as the subject, and I will be letting you know about
     various music-related discussion groups which you may have access to.
         Since Fidonews has worldwide distribution, I will try and include
     in the articles echoes from as many different parts of the world as
     possible.  However, I currently only know of echo lists from zones 1
     and 2.  If you know of echo lists from zones 3-6 which I could use,
     then I would be delighted to hear from you.  Now, on with the article
     itself...

         There are a number of echoes dealing with music and computers, and
     these I will tackle first.
         For readers in Germany there is TRACKER.GER, moderated by Michael
     Renzmann of 2:2461/364; the description for this echo is 'so called
     "Trackers" which are used to make music on computers.' Also available
     in Germany is the DEMO.MOD-PLAYER.GER echo, which is about mod player
     software.  The moderator is Andreas Mautsch of 2:2454/524.  Another
     echo dealing with modules is simply called MODULES, moderated by
     Gordon Naldrett of 2:259/102, and is available to UK readers.
         MIDI is one of the first things people think of when music and
     computers is mentioned, and there are a couple of echoes dealing with
     this subject.  First is R34.MIDI for readers in region 34 (Spain).
     The other one is MIDI.UK, which is unsuprisinly for UK users.  This
     one is moderated by Mark Williams of 2:250/239.

         The various types of modern music have quite a number of echoes
     available for fans.  Being mainly a classical fan, I'm counting
     anything written in the 20th century as modern music here :-)
         For users in zone 1 there is 60S_70S_PROGROCK, the 60's/70's
     Progressive Rock Music Echo.  I seem to remember this one being on the
     region 25 backbone some time ago, so it may be available to users
     outside zone 1.
         Another echo for zone 1 users is COUNTRY, which is all about
     country music, as the name suggests.  The moderators are John Cosper,
     1:123/302 and Barbara Douglas, 1:123/38.
         The selection of echoes for modern music available to UK users is
     quite reasonable, with DJ, KERRANG, NEWMUSIC and INDIE being among
     FIDONEWS 13-40               Page 4                   30 Sep 1996


     them.  KERRANG is for discussion of rock/metal music, moderated by
     James Johnson of 2:250/107.127. NEWMUSIC, moderated by Michael Pereira
     of 2:254/98, is for contemporary & non mainstream music. INDIE is a
     new echo, unsuprisingly about Indie music, although since the echo
     hasn't hit the zone 2 echo list yet, I'm not sure who the moderator
     is. DJ is for dance music related chat, DJing tips, record reviews,
     club chat etc.  The moderator is Daniel Shepperd of 2:440/308.
         Users in Germany have the MUSIK.EM.GER echo, which is all about
     electronic & new age music, artists and events, and is moderated by
     Martin Rodenberg, 2:2432/301.5.

         At the other end of the scale, classical music isn't as well
     supported, but I did find some echoes of interest to fans of classical
     music.
         In zone 1, and echo exists which is simply tagged CLASSICAL, and
     entitled 'Classical music discussion.'  It is for discussion all
     aspects of classical music, and since one of the moderators is in
     Germany, this echo should be available there as well.  It is moderated
     by Tom Huber, 1:115/477 and Harald Gerber, 2:2471/1025.
         Also available in Germany is the MUSIK.KLASSIK.GER echo, described
     as 'Klassische Musik etc.'  Another echo called 'KLASSIK.GER' is also
     listed, though its description implies that users are encouraged to
     fix into MUSIK.KLASSIK.GER instead.
         For users in Spain there is R34.MUSICA.CLASICA for classical music
     fans.  It is moderated by Joan Espina (2:343/410.25).
         A new echo in the UK exists, called CLASSICAL_UK, moderated by
     yours truly, and created because no classical music echo has been
     created or imported to the UK backbone.  It is not yet on the
     backbone, but that is only a matter of time; contact me by netmail for
     more information.

         Various echoes exist dealing with issues of musicians themselves.
     First on my list is the German echo MUSIKER.GER, for German musicians.
     It is moderated by Daniel Roesen, 2:2454/95.2.
         There are also musicians' echoes in zone 1, including MUSICIAN,
     MUSICIAN'S_SERVICES, MUSIC_COMP_101 and STUDIO_101.  MUSICIAN,
     described simply as 'Pro/semi-pro/amateur musician's discussion', and
     is moderated by Bob Stephenson of 1:271/560.  Sadly, there is a delete
     warning on this echo, so it may not be available by the time you read
     this.
         MUSICIAN'S_SERVICES is the musician's classified conference,
     moderated by Rick Ashworth of 1:108/90.  It is intended for 'for sale'
     and help wanted messages.  Rick also moderates MUSIC_COMP_101, the
     music composition conference.
         STUDIO_101 is the studio musician's conference, for discussion of
     studio concepts.  It is also moderated by Rick Ashworth.

         Finally we come to a more general set of musical echoes. The
     echoes MUSICA.R34, MUSIK.GER and MUSIC are general music discussion
     areas for Spain, Germany and the UK respectively.
         Other miscellaneous musical echoes include the German echoes
     TANZEN.GER ('Moving to the music'), TEXTE.MUSIK.GER for Songlyrics,
     questions about musicians and lyrics, and the UK echo Q&Q, described
     as 'Quiz and Quote:Music and Film Trivia.'

         That rounds off the article for this week.  Don't worry if I
     FIDONEWS 13-40               Page 5                   30 Sep 1996


     haven't included your echo; the echoes discussed here are merely a
     selection, not a total list, and so I may touch upon the subject of
     music again (especially since I'm in the process of gathering echo
     lists from other zones).
         In future articles I may include things other than echoes, such as
     specialist systems, some relevant requestable files (where this is
     appropriate), and even people in Fidonet with an interest in the
     subject (with their permission, of course).  This would all depend on
     how much time and effort in research is required, a matter to which
     I've given little thought up to now.

     pstewart@furtherdev.com

     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

                  FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, INC. ANNOUNCES
                     INTERMAIL 2.50 GAMMA RELEASE

     SOUTH FLORIDA, Fla.  --- Further Development, Inc., announced
     today a gamma release for the long awaited InterMail v2.50.

     When asked why it's taken so long, Peter Stewart, President and
     author of the popular Fidonet style, frontend mailer said, "We
     honestly thought it would only take a few weeks to complete, but
     rewriting the very core of the editor was a bigger task than
     anticipated...  Still, many of the 'big guys' are even worse than
     us when it comes to making accurate estimates."

     Though v2.50 is not quite complete or ready for final release, the
     remaining work on the editor is negligible at best.  An outcry by long
     standing customers to release some version of InterMail that will be
     able to handle the new ISDN flags setting up in Germany helped decide
     FDI to release a Gamma version to the public.

     "There are really only two things NOT working in this current
     Gamma." said Michele Stewart, CEO and wife of the author.  The new
     message formats in the editor are not fully functional, though the
     previously supported formats (*.Msg and Hudson) work as before,
     and the documentation has not been finalized. "Though it may require
     a little more work on the part of our customers, it's all there."
     said Ms. Stewart.

     The final release will support the message base formats of
     Wildcat 3 and 4, PCBoard 15, Goldbase, Synchronet and JAM. A text
     file listing the changes, additions and fixes is included on disk.

     Some of the new features include being able to sync your system
     clock to Caller-ID or to another mailer, user defined semaphores, 80
     aka's, brand new config program with extensive hypertext help,
     internal support for non-standard com ports, and much more.
     A nodediff processor is now also included.
     FIDONEWS 13-40               Page 6                   30 Sep 1996


     The most important improvement is that the new config program makes
     it much easier to manage the mailer, especially in multi-line setups.
     It also allows a much higher degree of customization and
     personalization than what was previously possible.

     Customers have a choice of purchasing and installing the gamma now
     or waiting for the full release version.

     Subj: Echomail nonsense

     For Publication in FIDONEWS:

     Zone 2 has flexed it geographic muscles and tried to take
     "jurisdiction" over echomail.  Steve Woodmore promulgates a "policy"
     which if it were taken serious would effect ALL OF FIDONET.
     Guys...messages travel all over the world...  Are the international
     conferences subject to woodmorepol.  Are moderators in Zone 3
     replacable by a vote in Zone 2.

     The Z2 echopol is a joke.  Anything but a world wide ratification is a
     joke.  Boppy was a joke.  The obo is a joke.  The faq of the obo's is
     a joke.  Guys...messages travel all over the world...

     Do we have the z2 elist and the obo elist and the backbone number two
     elist.  What if they have different moderators.  Who cut the links.
     All of them, each of them ?  Do they vote...

     I moderate the INTERNATIONAL SYSOP conference.  It and I am not
     subject to any policy unless its approved by 50%+1 of the WORLD RC's
     and then voted affirmatively by 50%+1 of the *C.   GUYS...messages
     travel all over the world....

     Its seems ever little "petty dictator" wants to control something.  My
     suggestion is to use that urge in the bathroom and stop trying to
     promulgate little "policies" which no one takes serious.   Any Z2
     Fidonet member can have a link on my node and it will be SPECIFICALLY
     FREE of woodmorepol.  Guys....messages travel all over the world....

     A policy 4.1C was proposed a few year ago.  It was designed to:

     1. Correct the errors in p4.
     2. Make policy easier to change.
     3. Allow recals of *C's like Woodmore
     4. Set the stage for a world wide p5 which would include echomail.

     The act of adding a AREA to a messages should NOT result in a seperate
     policy.  Worse yet a seperate policy in a geographic area that has no
     rational to the passage of messages.

     The echopol in Z2 is a joke.  Any policy that is not world wide is a
     joke.  I reject them all and invite the policy complaints <grin>.

           IJMC - I am the Very Model of a Modern Teenage Cyberpunk

      For all of you who wait up in the wee hours of the morn (or afternoon
      or evening, depending on local) for the daily IJMC posting, well,
      you've been waiting far too long. Which is another way of saying I
      forgot to send anything out last night so I'm doing it now...oh well.
      If you can't figure out the rhythm for this song, you haven't been
      watching your fair share of Animaniacs. I recommend you do so. You
      know you've seen enough when you start complaining to strangers that
      Warner Brothers hasn't made a new Animaniacs episode in far too long
      (a day can be far too long...).  Lastly, in case you hadn't noticed,
      it is a Monday. Aagh.           -dave

      If you don't get it, you haven't been listening to enough Gilbert
      and Sullivan lately.

      ==========

              I am the Very Model of a Modern Teenage Cyberpunk

      I am the very model of a modern teenage Cyberpunk.
      I rent my own apartment, and it's full of electronic junk.
      I own a VAX, 486, I've even got a PDP.
      I've finished Myst and Doom, but I am stumped by Wing Commander III.

      I'm very well acquainted, too, with matters pornographical.
      I have a list of image sites, both overseas and national.
      So if you want to see a picture of that Anna Nichole Smith,
      I'll fire up my terminal and fetch for you a naughty GIF.

      I'm totally an anarchist.  The government I'd like to wreck,
      Though if they were to get blown up, who'd give to me my welfare
      cheque?
      In short if you need answers that concern your electronic junk,
      I am the very model of a modern teenage Cyberpunk.

      I know the ancient myths about RTM, Pengo, and Mitnick.
      I hack into computers, and I then perform a credit check.
      I scare all my non-hacker friends with tales of cracker thievery,
     FIDONEWS 13-40               Page 11                  30 Sep 1996


      and even though I'm spouting crap, they listen and believe in me.

      I've learned to spot a troll, and I've seen flames about the way I
      spell.
      I've traced badly forged cancels and seen napalm poured on AOL.
      I've laughed at all the newbies and their flailing cries of "You all
      suck!"
      I've been flamed by Carasso, with an anvil I have then been struck.

      I've hung around in alt.tasteless and seen war waged on
      rec.pets.cats.
      I've spent my time in talk.bizarre and used those stupid Relay Chats.
      In short, if you need answers that concern your electronic junk,
      I am the very model of a modern teenage Cyberpunk

      Well postings like "MAKE.MONEY.FAST", I am now somewhat wary at.
      I have been "Global Killfiled" by the Joel Furr Commissariat.
      When rosebud posts a lengthy rant 'bout Microsoft she swears is true,
      I know that she is just another short lived kook without a clue.

      When I have learnt what progress has been made upon the Internet,
      When I know something more than just a smattering of netiquette,
      In short when I can have a world-wide soapbox on which I can stand,
      I've got no time for other things, like beer and trips to Disneyland.

      My life outside the Internet is very, very sad you see.
      I cannot get my spots to fade.  My social life's a tragedy,
      But still if you need answers that concern your electronic junk,
      I am the very model of a modern teenage Cyberpunk.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     When I started maintaining this list, some folks suggested I do away
     with the "Old Info" section. I decided that would be a mistake; it
     serves as a checklist of software that I haven't been able to get info
     about. Moreover, someone wanting it to go away badly enough might be
     willing to do a little research for me... ;-)

     Then I reconsidered. This isn't a history lesson, it's a current
     version list. Including info about software nobody uses is a waste.
     So I started the phase-outs: packages that I suspect aren't being used
     any more, everyone has two weeks to write in.

     Now I'm willing to go one step further. I'm willing to concede that
     there are entire platforms that are no longer of interest to the
     readers of this column. So I'm going to start highlighting them in the
     phase-out section.

     As noted below, I don't think anyone uses Apple CP/M any more.

     P. S. Zealots are encouraged to prove me wrong... ;-)

     Phased out this week: Genesis Deluxe 3.2

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: Apple CP/M Software Deadline: 11 Oct 1996.
       Last week: GSBBS 3.02 Deadline: 4 Oct 1996.
