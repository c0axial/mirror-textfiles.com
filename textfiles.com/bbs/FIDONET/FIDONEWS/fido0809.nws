     Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator Election Interim Results
     George Peace
     1:1/0

     Well, we made it through the election. But that's only half of
     the story. We had so much fun that we're going to do it again.
     Before I go on, I'll present the votes by region:

                Davis   Nissan   Lachan   Walker   Roberts
     Region     -----    -----    -----    -----    -----

       10          5        -        3       10        1
       11          8        -       12        3        -
       12          1        -        2        1        -
       13          7        -        2        1        -
       14          2        1        1        7        1
       15          -        -        1        2        -
       16          9        -        7        4        -
       17          4        5        3        1        -
       18          1       43        -        -        2
       19         35        -        3        4        2

      total       72       49       34       33        6

     I extend my sincere Thanks to all five candidates for your
     continuing efforts on all our behalf.

     According to the parameters of the election, no one candidate
     received more than 50% of votes cast. As a result, Tony Davis and
     Amnon Nissan, the two candidates who received the most votes,
     will slug it out in a runoff election. Eligibility and vote
     collection rules for the runoff remain nearly the same as for the
     first election.

     A maximum of two votes -- NC and NEC -- will be accepted from
     each Zone 1 network. If the NC and NEC of any net are the same
     person only one vote will be accepted for that net. Votes will be
     accepted and tallied by the same good folks as in the first
     election.

     The voting period will begin 7 days after this article appears in
     FidoNews and will extend for 14 days. If this article appears in
     the 4 March issue the voting period will commence on 11 March and
     continue until 25 March. I hope the tallies will be forwarded to
     me in time to be published in the first FidoNews issue following
     my receipt of all votes from the 10 Zone 1 RECs.

     by John Passaniti, Fidonet 1:260/201

     Two years ago, I started the echo conference ICGAL (Issues
     Concerning Gays And Lesbians) by submitting an article to
     Fidonews.  ICGAL was intended to be the Fidonet equivalent of the
     Usenet soc.motss newsgroup, and has largely succeeded.

     ICGAL started with only a handful of systems across the United
     States which I polled.  Response was too large for my system to
     handle, so I put the conference on the Fidonet backbone.  Since
     then, ICGAL has grown larger than I ever expected, reaching into
     Fidonet zones two and three.

     ICGAL (which is now moderated by Robert Bayron) has served many
     purposes during the two years it has existed.  One great benefit
     (for me at least) was finding other gay and lesbian couples.  My
     husband and I had been together for two years at that point, and
     the various advice and insight given by others really helped us
     along (and I'm sure others too).  With that in mind, I'm starting
     a new echo conference.

     COTSS is a new echo conference that has a specific function in
     mind.  COTSS (Couples Of The Same Sex) is for committed gay and
     lesbian couples to talk about their relationships, with the
     problems and solutions they have discovered.

     My intention is to have the conference cover a range of issues,
     from emotional to financial to political to social.  For example,
     I'd like to see a discussion on how "domestic partnership" laws
     will change gay and lesbian relationships.  I'd like to see how
     wills, joint finances, and various other money issues should be
     handled.  I'd want to hear about problems homosexual couples who
     are also parents face.

     COTSS is open to anyone (regardless of sexuality or relationship
     status), but it is intended for committed gay and lesbian couples.
     It isn't a "dating" conference (there are other conferences in
     and out of Fidonet to fill that need).

     COTSS will initially be available through 1:260/228, where
     interested parties should send netmail.  Like ICGAL, I expect
     COTSS to grow, and eventually, if there is enough demand, I'll
     place it on the backbone.

     Thanks,
     John Passaniti, 1:260/201

            YAPPPIII (Yet another packet proposal - part 3)

     Last week, I introduced the 32 bit type-4 flags meanings.  Here
     is the rest of the proposed packet header, and how it relates
     to the type-2 packet currently in standard use, and the type-3
     which was proposed in FSC-0007.TXT.

     The FIRST sixteen bits of every packet or segregated message is
     the header id.  Only the first 8 bits are actually used.  This
     allows superficial compatibility with the FTS-0001, type-2 and
     FSC-0007, type-3 packets.  This is the limit of exact compat-
     ibility, however.   This may be treated in ANY of the following
     manners:
                          C         Pascal        Modula-2
         ID byte    unsigned char   byte          SHORTCARD
     plus waste     unsigned char   byte          SHORTCARD

     or
         ID word         int        integer       INTEGER
     or
         ID word    unsigned int    word          CARDINAL

     with equal facility, as the second 8-bits are predefined as
     a zero, as in current type-2 use (note intel format LL HH)

     The primary difference between the type-4 and type-5 is the
     "Ultimate address" versus the "Echo information" covering
     the packet.

     The "Extra Header Type" in each case, aligns with the Message-
     Type in an FTS-0001 .MSG format.  This allows for simplified
     processing, as a processing program dealing exclusively with
     packets will use the leading packet-type byte or word value to
     identify the packet, and the processing program dealing exclus-
     ively with unpacked messages may jump directly to the MESSAGE
     type identifier.

     All addresses are arranged with bytes in sequential order from
     least to most significant, for numeric longword or reverse byte
     by byte comparison, and the Origin and immediate destination
     addresses are ALSO aligned between the type 4 & 5 headers.

     Message timestamping is maintained in Microsoft format, as in
     MS-DOS directory timestamping, with bit shift compression and
     the 1980 base date offset for the year.  The point-of-origin
     timezone is also included.  In our global FidoNet, with inter-
     zone mailing and conferencing, the time-zone differential may
     be used by BBS or other mail processing software to give a
     display of both WHEN a message was written, and also how old it
     is.   Comparison to a specified time and date may be handled as
     a flag numeric compare in Intel longword format.  When the
     message is tossed, the LOCAL receipt time may be placed to re-
     use a portion of the interim routing address fields to allow
     accurate purging by display duration instead of merely by "how
     old is it?"  In any case, the ZONE of the Interxxxx address
     should be zeroed when a message is tossed.

     When the Type-4 or Type-5 header is used on a message, the link
     fields, forward and backward are pointers to related messages.
     In the message headers within a packet, they are relative offset
     values.  When used on a packet, however, they assume slightly
     different meanings.  The forward link is zeroed unless a packet
     has been deliberately split into smaller packets for transmission
     over noisy lines or unstable datalinks.  More on this later.  The
     NORMAL Type-4 or Type-5 packet has the forward link as a zero.
     The Backward link is a sequential "transaction" number which
     is assigned by each sender from a counter with the immediate
     receiver, allowing for easy detection of any missed trans-
     missions.

     Note that there are 12 bytes of contiguous expansion area in
     each of the headers which do not fully overlap.  This allows
     for careful later implementation of any points which may have
     been missed here.

     More explanations next time.
