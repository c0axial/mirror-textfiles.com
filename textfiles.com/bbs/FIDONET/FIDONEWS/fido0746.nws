                        Ask A Coordinator

     Recently a new participant in the SYSOP echo said "I thought
     this echo was for civil discussions between sysops." SYSOP and
     CIVIL are oxymoron.  Where is a sysop to go when they want to
     get real answers and have discussions where they won't be
     attacked for their personal opinions?  I thought about this for
     a while and came to the conclusion that SYSOP is a lost cause
     and the only thing to do is start a brand new echo where flames
     and personal attacks will not be tolerated.

     Ask A Coordinator, ASK_A_C, is an echo devoted to sysops and
     users who want to ask questions and carry on friendly
     conversation.  Topics include: Policy (current and proposed),
     echomail, software, how the network operates, and many more
     topics.

     ASK_A_C is open to everyone who is willing to converse in a
     friendly manner.  The only people who are not welcome are those
     who flame and attack others (there is an echo for those people
     already.)

     I invite all Coordinators to participate in this open
     discussion forum. I am working to move this echo to backbone as
     soon as possible.  All current and former *C's and *EC's are
     invited to join me in this ground breaking of this echo devoted
     to open the channel of discussion between the coordinator
     structure and the grunt sysops and their users.

     It is the coordinators who keep our network together but it is
     the grunt sysops and their users who benefit from their
     contributions.

     Distribution is being worked on but initially it will be
     available from 1:3603/110 (MO, HST/V42, N3603/R18 echomail hub)
     in Clearwater, Florida and soon after 151/1003 (R18EC).

     Contact Neil Lauritsen (1:3603/110) for a link into ASK_A_C.

     Moderator Kinknet Echoes

                Gateway Policy...

     Well, to be honest, it looks like I probably ought to quit read-
     ing FidosNews again, and wait for the announcements in the Node-
     list, where they are supposed to be posted. It would probably
     result in my blood-pressure staying down much better. Especially
     since they aren't being made there anymore. Sorry for the long
     lead in at the top, but I am speaking on this subject matter on
     much more than one level.

     I've just read Matt Whelan's version of the New GATEWAY LAW that
     the **C's have decided to inflict us with. It's nice to see that
     FidoNet doesn't want to tell the other networks how to operate.
     Now would

                SOMEONE PLEASE TELL THAT TO FIDONET!!!!!

     I'm beginning to think that maybe folks like Jack Decker, Jason
     Steck, The ROUSTER,  and a few of the other so-called rabble
     rousers aren't all that far off base. I am beginning to feel that
     the SS-Elite are moving in on us along with BIG BROTHER!

     First off, what's this contract crap at the end of the Gateway
     policy? Come on! If you aren't telling other networks how to
     operate, what the heck do you call it? This is supposed to be a
     hobby not a business.

     Second, the article immediately following Matt's GATEWAY POLICY,
     by Tony Davis quite calmly announces that "1:1/100@FIDONET will
     accept and deliver domain addressed network netmail to the do-
     mains of:

                 Fidonet
                 Alternet
                 Eggnet
                 Rbbsnet
                 Network
                 Kinknet"

     I find this very interesting. Who died and elected either Tony
     Davis or Matt Whelan GOD? I believe I have to claim that I am
     KinkNet. Or at least I have the right to that claim. After all, I
     started the KinkNet echoes over two years ago, and am the modera-
     tor of the echo conferences tied together under that banner.

     FidoNews 7-46                Page 4                   12 Nov 1990


     KinkNet is not a DOMAIN! KinkNet is nothing more than a group of
     Echoes. KinkNet operates in the DOMAIN of Adult Links (Zone 69) of
     which I am also the Zone Coordinator.
             IT DOES NOT OPERATE WITHIN THE DOMAIN OF FIDONET!!!

     As the moderator of the KinkNet echoes, I have entered into no
     agreement authorizing such a gateway. As the Zone Coordinator of
     Adult Links, likewise I have authorized no such gateway, nor has
     it even been discussed with me. I have further not discussed or
     agreed to Adult Links or KinkNet DOMAIN titles with anyone. I am
     glad to see that FidoNet has not made any decisions for KINKNET
     or Adult Links!

     Hence, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY 1:1/100@FIDONET is not authorized to
     gate any traffic into either KINKNET or Adult Links, until such
     time as an agreement is reached.

     Be it further known, KINKNET is not a DOMAIN! And the word KINK-
     NET may not be used as a DOMAIN tag.

     Speaking as the EggNet Supreme Court Chief Justice, I am not
     aware of any such agreement existing in EggNet either. Should one
     have been reached there would be an applicable 99/1 address.
     There is no such address in the current Egglist. Nor has an
     announcement been made by the EggNet Inter Network Liaison of
     such an agreement. Further, in EggNet in particular, after look-
     ing over the contents of the Gateway Policy, EggNet as a whole
     would have to vote as to whether or not such an agreement could
     be put in place for inter-network operation. No such election is
     currently scheduled.

     Mr. Davis doesn't have either an Adult Links (required by A_LINKS
     policy) or EggNet Address. And Mr. Davis in the past has ex-
     hibited strong ANTI-Other Network ideals. (Circa FidoCon '89).

     Now, someone PLEASE say something to convince me that FIDONET
     isn't out to run the other networks! I wonder, did the rest of
     the networks find out about this scheme the same way I did?

     Jeff Murphy
     1:344/10
     Ephrata, WA, USA

                       LDS_PRIVATE Echo Now Available

     On behalf of it's participants, I wish to announce the existence
     of a private echo for Latter-day Saints (Mormons).  Currently
     all connections are being managed by Charles Simpkinson, 1:347/3
     in Boise, ID.

     Those of you interested in such things will know that the MORMON
     echo already exists on the backbone, and is fairly well used by
     its limited audience.  However, for some time now the echo has
     permitted considerable discussion of religious views - which is
     to say that anti-Mormons are having a field day.

     Some of us had the erroneous idea that MORMON meant just that: a
     forum for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
     Saints to discuss issues of interest to themselves.  We were
     apparently mistaken; most of the "burning questions" raised in
     there deal with issues that are fundamental to our religion, in
     that they question the basic premises upon which the Church is
     built, arguing for example that Joseph Smith was no prophet at
     all, the Book of Mormon a total fraud, etc.  In other echos, we
     call this flaming.  In that one, it was called intellectual
     curiosity or righteous indignation.  <grin>

     The echo has not been placed on the backbone in order to avoid
     the conflicts which come from non-members and apostates.  We
     would probably do so if we could figure out a way to prune the
     tree when one of these worms wanders in ['scuse my French].
     However, the echo is available currently throughout the west
     from various boards.  We invite Latter-day Saints to might wish
     to participate to contact Charles at 1:347/3.

              SGANet - Student Government Global Mail Network
                Now linking student leaders in 32 countries

     SGANet,  started  in  May  1990,  is  a  global  electronic  mail
     discussion  group  for student governments and student leaders to
     use to discuss campus issues, education,  and governance.  SGANet
     is  a  group  of  seven free and open e-mail discussions in which
     student leaders can discuss ideas, share information,  or request
     information with student leaders worldwide.  The practical effect
     of the system is to place the participating  student  leaders  in
     one room.

     SGANet supports the following: free and open discussion areas, an
     automated  directory  of users,  archives of discussions,  and an
     automated group of file libraries with information about  student
     governance, SGAnet, and future plans.

     SGANet, although relatively new, now reaches student associations
     in  32  countries  on  six continents.  Until recently,  our only
     publicity was word of mouth.

     It is our hope  that  SGANet,  in  the  future,  will  provide  a
     reliable,  interactive media which will serve as a foundation for
     meaningful student union  on  the  regional,  national  and  even
     global level. Simone Botti, of Italy, recently initiated a debate
     on  drafting a universal Charter on Student Rights which would be
     drafted later this year when we have reached a sizeable  fraction
     of the universities in the 70 countries served by the Internet.

     SGANet  is  collectively  maintained  by an international team of
     moderators and network liasions.  Moderators  help  us  keep  the
     network  running and work primarily on technical issues.  Network
     liasions help us reach universities in a given  region  and  help
     prospective  users with difficulties ranging from e-mail problems
     to langauge barriers.

     SGANet  can  be   reached   through   the   following   networks:
     BITNET/EARN, the Internet (serves over 70 countries), CompuServe,
     Usenet, and Fidonet.

     SGANet provides the following discussion areas,  and related file
     libraries:

     SGANet@VTVM1.BITNET      (Global discussion)
     SGANet-N@VTVM1.BITNET    (North American universities)
     SGANet-S@VTVM1.BITNET    (South American universities)
     SGANet-E@VTVM1.BITNET    (European Universities)
     SGANet-A@VTVM1.BITNET    (Asian/Australian Universities)
     SGAN-SAV@VTVM1.BITNET    (Student Association of Virginia, USA)
     USGA-L@SIUCVMB.BITNET    (Illinois Universities, USA)
     SGANET-T@VTVM1.BITNET    (Technical discussion group)

     Automatic subscriptions can be taken by sending the following
     message to LISTSERV@VTVM1.BITNET

     SUBscribe (Network name) (Your name, affiliation, country)

     We are  interested  in  making  SGANet,  and  its  five
     regional networks,  available  through  Fidonet.  Our  ultimate
     goal is to provide a forum in which student leaders can  share
     information, and  plan  strategy  worldwide;  and also to make
     the discussions available to as wide an audience as possible.
     If  you  would  be interested  in  joining  SGANet and/or making
     SGANet available to your users contact one of the following:

     Introduction

          FidoNet has been using the Type II style packet for some
     five years or more now with good results.  However, at this
     point, the Type II format has been extended an amazing number of
     ways using the "Kludge" hidden line facility provided by a
     leading ^A (ASCII SOH) on a line of text.  It is my belief that
     the time has come to move to a newer technology for handling
     packets, one that is inherently extensible and easily handled by
     a number of systems.  Such a system should be able to handle
     such varied things as integrated text/graphics and other special
     attributes of messages.  Such a system has been proposed by
     Garth Kidd and is expanded upon here.

     Basic Format

          Essentially, this format would break a message into a
     number of "chunks".  Each chunk would be a maximum of
     4,294,967,306(!) bytes long including its header and may contain
     any type of data.  A chunk header would be 21 bytes long and
     would consist of a 4 byte chunk type tag followed by an 8 byte
     length field.  The length field does *not* include the 12 bytes
     of the chunk header.  Chunks would be unterminated.  In C, a
     chunk structure would look like this:

          struct chunk {
               char type[4];
               char  len[8];  /* 32  bit  length of data field, 8 hex
                                 digits */
               unsigned char data[len]; /* not really, this isn't
                                           legal c, but it gets the
                                           idea across */
          };

          Certain chunk types require that a FidoNet address be
     represented in a 24 byte hex format.  This address would be
     comprised of the domain, zone, net, node, and point expressed as
     the following C structure:

          struct address {
     FidoNews 7-46                Page 9                   12 Nov 1990


               char domain[8];
               char zone[4];
               char net[4];
               char node[4];
               char point[4];
          };

     The domain name is *not* null terminated, it is however, null
     padded to eight characters.  If the first character of the
     domain name is null, then the remainder of the domain field is
     to be considered absent.  This offers a space savings of 7 bytes
     per address when operating in a non-domain aware Network.

          All other fields are 4 hex digits, again, with NO
     terminating nul character.  It was chosen to use an ASCII
     representation of numbers (in hex) to avoid byte ordering
     problems and to enhance portability across 7 bit transport
     layers.

     Chunk Types

          Chunk type names are exactly four characters long, padded
     with spaces if necessary.  Chunk types not recognized by a
     program would be passed along and ignored.  Chunk types that are
     marked with an asterisk (*) must be recognized by a conforming
     installation.  Chunk types marked with a C are considered
     control chunks, while those marked with D are data chunks.
     Unmarked chunks are delimiters or informational.  I would
     propose the following base chunk types:

        * BEGB      A chunk indicating the beginning of a bundle.
                    This chunk may contain optional information
                    identifying the bundle.

          CRTR      Indicates the software and revision level used
                    to create this bundle.  Applies only to entire
                    bundles.

        * PSWD      Password for the entire bundle, or if within
                    "BEGM"/"ENDM" a single message.  If the password
                    in this chunk does not match a predefined
                    password on the receiving system one of two
                    actions occurs.  If the receiving system is the
                    final destination of the bundle or message, the
                    bundle or message is discarded, optionally with
                    a message being sent back to the sender saying so.
                    If the bundle or message is only passing through,
                    it will not be made visible to the sysop of the
                    routing system, regardless of any options that
                    may be set to the contrary.  Obviously, this is
                    lightweight security, but it is better than

                    nothing!

        * BEGM      A chunk indicating the beginning of a message,
                    this chunk may contain optional information
                    identifying the message.

        * ROUT  C   Binary address of next destination for this
                    message or bundle.  In other words, if a message
                    from 123/456 is going to 456/789 but is routed
                    through an intermediary system (say 321/654) this
                    address would be that of the intermediary system.
                    This address would be a two dimensional address in
                    the sender's current zone and domain.  This
                    address would be represented in C as:

                         struct route_address {
                              char net[4];
                              char node[4];
                         };

                    This chunk may be applied to either a single
                    message or an entire bundle.  If the chunk length
                    is 24, then the route address is a full five
                    dimensional address comprising domain, zone and
                    point information as described above in "Basic
                    Formats", otherwise the chunk length is 4 and the
                    address is in the format described above.

        * TO    C   Name and address of receiver in ascii.  The
                    address in this field may be anything, so long
                    as the system at the "ROUT" address can make
                    sense of it.

        * FROM  C   Name and address of sender in ascii.  This
                    may be anything so long as it is possible for
                    the receiver to reply via the address in this
                    field.

        * ATTR  C   Attributes of the message. See Appendix 2 for
                    a complete list of message attributes. Length is
                    8.

        * NUMB      Serial number of this message on originating
                    system. This chunk is fixed as an 8 byte hex
                    word. Length is 8.

        * RPLY      Address and serial number of the message this
                    message is a reply to.  This chunk is a 24 byte
                    hex address followed by a 8 byte hex word.  Length
                    is 32.

        * ATCH  C   Name of a file attached to this message

        * FREQ  C   Name of a file requested from receiving system.
                    This would incorporate the same type of update
                    request logic as is currently used by WaZoo
                    mailers.  A separate "FREQ" chunk is required
                    for each file requested.

        * AREA  C   Echomail only, signifies the echomail area this
                    message belongs to.

        * DOMN  C   Echomail only, list of domains, as 8 byte ASCII
                    strings (null-padded, but not necessarily null-
                    terminated), that have seen this message.

        * ZONE  C   Echomail only, list, as four byte hex words,
                    of zones that have seen this message.  This
                    chunk is cleared each time the message enters a
                    different domain and the name of the domain the
                    message is exiting is added to the "DOMN" chunk.

        * NET   C   Echomail only, list, as four byte hex words,
                    of all nets that have seen this message.  This
                    chunk is cleared upon export to another zone and
                    the exporting node's zone number is added to the
                    "ZONE" chunk.

        * NODE  C   Echomail only, list, as four byte hex words,
                    of all nodes in the current net that have seen
                    this message.  This chunk is cleared each time
                    the message enters a new net and the number of
                    the net the message is exiting is added to the
                    "NET " chunk.

        * PONT  C   Echomail only, list, as four byte hex words,
                    of all point systems that have seen this message.
                    This chunk is cleared upon export to another node
                    and the node number of the exporting system is
                    added to the "NODE" chunk.

        * PATH      List of the systems this message has passed
                    through to reach this system, in order.  This
                    includes all systems in all zones and domains.
                    All addresses would be 24 byte hex as defined
                    in the section "Basic Formats"

        * TEXT  D   The text of the message

          TXAT  D   Text attribute change.  Allows for font changes,
                    underlining, etc.  See Appendix 4 for the basic
                    set of text attributes.

          BITS  D   A bitmap. To be defined (MacPaint? Windows? PCX?
                    TIFF?)

          BITC  D   Bitmap continuation.

          GRPH  D   A vector drawing. To be defined (PostScript?
                    HPGL?)

        * ENDM      A chunk indicating the end of a message.  This
                    chunk may optionally contain information
                    identifying the message it terminates.

        * ENDB      A chunk indicating the end of the bundle,
                    anything after this can be safely ignored.
                    This chunk may optionally contain information
                    identifying the bundle it terminates.

     Other Considerations

          Chunk style packets could not be sent as *.PKT files as
     they are not backward compatible with type II packets.  I
     propose that chunk style packets be called bundles and sent as
     *.BUN files, with compressed bundles sent as *.B??  where ??  is
     the compression method used (see Appendix 1 for extensions).
     Bundle file names should be unique for at least a one week
     cycle, a 32 bit serial number expressed in hexadecimal should
     prove adequate for most applications.

          Experimental chunk types are provided for by the provision
     that unrecognized chunk types be passed through and ignored.
     Systems that know how to use a particular chunk type (say, BITS)
     can, while systems that don't understand it may ignore it.

          Chunks should appear in a bundle in roughly the same order
     as they appear above, with control and informational chunks
     (PATH, ROUT, etc) appearing before data chunks (TEXT, BITS,
     GRPH).

     Control

          Chunk tag name assignments are controlled by Appendix 3 of
     this document.  New chunk tags may be added and old ones revised
     by revision of this document.  Message attribute assignments are
     controlled by Appendix 2 of this document.  New attributes may
     be assigned by revision of this document.  Bundle file
     extensions are controlled by Appendix 1 of this document.  New
     extensions may be defined and old ones revised by revision of
     this document.  Finally, text attributes are controlled by
     Appendix 4 of this document.

     Conclusion

          I doubt I have covered all possible or desirable chunk
     types in this document.  I do believe however, that enough have
     been defined to get started with.  Chunks offer a highly
     flexible, extensible system of bundling mail.  New types of
     chunks may defined as needed to accomodate advances in
     technology and FidoNet.  Additionally, this would further
     separate the application and transport layers of FidoNet,
     yielding less confusion as to their respective roles.

          It may be noticed that this structure is extremely similar
     to the IFF format as used on Amiga computers and introduced by
     Electronic Arts Software. While inspired by IFF, this system has
     been simplified somewhat and changed to be more easily
     transportable between computers using different byte orders and
     processors.  All fields defined in this document are 7 bit ascii
     and should be easily parsed by any system.

     Appendix 1 - Compression Extensions

          Compressed bundles would indicate the type of compression
     used by the following file extensions:

          Extension      Creator
          ---------      -------
          .BUN           Uncompressed
          .BPK           PKZip
          .BLH           LHarc
          .BAR           ARC
          .BDW           DWC
          .BPA           PAK
          .BZO           ZOO
          .BPX           PKXarc

     Appendix 2 - Message Attributes

          Message attributes are expressed as an 8 byte hex word.
     (32 bit binary) Multiple attributes may be ORed together.  The
     following attributes have been assigned.

               0000000000000001         Privileged (sysop or
                                        addressee access only)
               0000000000000010         Encrypted
               0000000000000100         Crash (high priority)
               0000000000001000         Direct (send directly to
                                        recipient system, no routing)
               0000000000010000         Hold for pickup

     Appendix 3 - Defined Chunk Tags

          The following chunk tags are defined in this document:

          BEGB      NET       FROM      TEXT      AREA
          NODE      ATTR      TXAT      ENDB      PSWD
          CRTR      PONT      NUMB      BITS
          BEGM      ZONE      RPLY      BITC
          ROUT      DOMN      ATCH      GRPH
          TO        PATH      FREQ      ENDM

     Appendix 4 - Text Attributes

          The text attribute is a four byte hex word (16 bit binary).
     Multiple attributes may be ORed together.  Attributes are
     toggles.  The following attributes have been assigned:

               00000000       Reset all text attributes
               00000001       Underline
               00000010       Bold
               00000100       Italic
               00001000       Font Change
               00010000       Size Change
               00100000       Color Change

     The font, size and color change attributes are followed by a
     one byte binary word selecting the font, size and color to
     change to.  In the case of changing two or all three of these
     attributes at the same time, the selectors will follow the
     attribute word in the order; font, size, color, with
     unnecessary fields being omitted.

     Paul Knupke, Jr.
     Pointless Perception
     FidoNet 1:3603/110.9
     Eggnet 99:9010/35

                    Why Not? (Because it is too simple?)

     Has anyone considered the simplist method of holding elections in
     Fidonet lately?  How about one vote for each sysop of Fidonet and
     the outcome is decided by who has the most votes or whether
     there are more yes or no votes for implementation of policy.  The
     policy of "no vote = no" has got to stop!

     In the United States of America officials are elected for the
     most part by a minority of the people who are eligible to vote
     because not everyone is interested in politics. Why can't Fidonet
     employ such a simple method to elect the *C and *EC structure and
     to decide if a new policy document will become the law.   Those
     who are interested will vote and those who aren't won't.  Those
     who don't vote have no right to complain about the results of
     their non participation in an election.

     I propose the following election procedure.  Once a year all *C
     positions are put up for reelection by those under the position.
     Before any nominations and elections occur a vote counter would
     be needed.  The vote counter should be outside the net or region
     that the election is taking place.  In the ZC case the current IC
     would ask a non *C sysop within their zone to serve as vote
     counter.

     Nominations would be sent to the vote counter via net mail.  All
     names received before a set date would appear on the ballot.  The
     ballot would be sent to the *C for distibution.

     The nomination and election time frame will be one week (7
     days) each.  If a candidate gets a majority on the first ballot
     they are declared the winner.  If no single candidate gets a
     majority of votes the two highest vote getters will run against
     each other for a runoff election.  The highest vote getter is
     then declared the winner.

     The individual sysops would vote for their Net Coordinator, their
     Regional Coordinator and their Zone coordinator.  No matter how
     many times a sysop's name appears in the nodelist they get one
     vote.

     The time frame I am describing is 4 weeks long.  The first week
     of the month (first through the seventh day) is the nomination
     period.  The second week (eighth day through fourteenth day) is
     the election period.  The third week (fifteenth day through the
     twenty-first day) is to tally votes.  The fourth week (twenty-
     second day through the twenty-eighth day) is the runoff week (if
     necessary.)  The results will be published with in 5 days of the
     ending of the election and runoff.

     FidoNews 7-46                Page 16                  12 Nov 1990


     Elections for the NCs, RCs and ZCs will not occur at the same
     time but about 4 months apart so that the new coordinators will
     be settled into their positions.

     There is one problem with the above procedure that I need to
     address.  What happens if the newly elected coordinator wants to
     run for a higher office.  I propose that if the coordinator wins
     the election for the higher office the runner-up in the previous
     election takes over the lower position.

     The runner up in any *C election would be called the Alternate
     *C.  In the event the current *C decides to not continue as a *C
     or drops out of the network for any reason the A*C would assume
     the position until the next election.

     All *Cs can run for re-election.  A good *C will be re-elected in
     most cases and a unpopular *C will not be.

     In a few weeks I'll be discussing the *EC structure and election
     procedure.  It differs from the *C election method because the
     *EC jobs are a technical job and the *C jobs are mostly
     administrative jobs.

     A View from the Bridge

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9011.11..."
     by The Captain, 1:107/583@FidoNet 520/583@AlterNet 9:807/1@PNet

     You know, it seems a lot of idiots who don't have anything better
     to do have been jumping up and down about what's being published
     in FidoNews.  "IT'S NOT FIDONET RELATED!" they scream in long,
     tedious articles (as opposed to short, tedious columns like
     mine).  Let's ask ourselves a question: What does "Fidonet
     related" MEAN, and just who the u&rz are YOU to judge what should
     get published or not?

     There's a long standing tradition with FidoNews, going back
     almost SEVEN YEARS that if it's sent in, it gets printed.  With
     some folks, its a selling point of joining the network!  Yet
     certain people with narrow minds object to their being "forced"
     to distribute a file which on average is smaller than the usual
     DAILY echomail bundle once a week, simply because it has
     something in it THEY don't care to read.  SO, they make a verbal
     stink about it without doing anything constructive.  Sound
     familiar?  Can YOU say "echomail"?  I thought you could...

     Needless to say I continue to support the policy of "All the News
     that Fits We Print" with FidoNews.  I happen to be directly
     responsible for that being the motto of AlterNet's AlterNews.  If
     someone has something to say that they feel is important enough
     that they'll write up an article and send it on their dime to
     FidoNews, we oughta publish it.  If you don't like that, don't
     read it.  If you're a *C and don't like distributing it, don't be
     a *C.  Nobody's FORCING you.

     The only time I can remember disliking something in FidoNews was
     Tom Jennings's (remember him?  He invented the network...)
     article on gay rights.  I didn't object to his subject matter,
     but felt that his profanity should have been editted before
     publishing.  Other people felt differently, that it should never
     have been published at all.  To those people I remind: "This Is A
     Hobby."  And some day THEY might be the ones who want to have
     something published.
