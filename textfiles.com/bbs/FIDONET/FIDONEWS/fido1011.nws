========================================================================
  Tom warned us.  If you make changes, you will get five
hundred complaints per change.  Well, the first issue went out
and we got our share ... none nasty, all quite reasonable, but
that brings up a new subject.  Just how written in stone should
anything be in a tchnological venue?

  Most of the problems stemmed from truly trivial changes, most
not discernable to the human eye.  It seems that many people
have written programs to slice up, dish out, and chew up
fidonews into different forms.  They trigger on everything from
seventy dashes (not seventy-one, thank you) to the spelling of
the editors' names.

  I do have sympathy with all this but ... echo data are
distributed in a format designed for *computers*, while the
snooze  is formatted for *people*.   Evolution and change,
evolution and change ... perhaps it is a problem that Fidonews
is physically modelled on the newspaper.  That is an obsolete
concept in this era.

  A few questions: Is the journal a medium that stands by
itself?  Is it different from an echo? If so, why don't we have
a specification for electronic journals, and BBS programs that
can format those into readable form?  Last but not least, would
such a specification allow the same explosion of publishing that
the echo has triggered in correspondence?

  There's  a  scattering  of  articles  this week.  The
so-call-id issue is heating up, and is starting to sound like
aliases revisited (it really is, come to think of it ... what am
i going to do the next time i want to log on a BBS and ensure i
won't encounter offers from sysops to come over and fix my
computer?).  There is a good article comparing the costs of new
communications services, but unfortunately only services within
the United States.

Re: Young Fido Sysops
by Pat Winstanley
2:250/113@fidonet
peewee@cix.compulink.co.uk

It's been interesting to follow the experiences of young sysops in
Fidonews, as many of the points they've raised have struck chords
with my own position.

I'm a middle-aged housewife and often receive much the same "Place
the disk in drive A then press [enter]" style comments. I do wish
that such people would begin pitching their help explanations at
their own level, then work down until understanding is reached,
rather than the other way round. In doing so the person receiving the
help will pick up lots of incomprehensible (at the time) background
info which will slot into place later as they progress. The helper
might also discover they have to pitch explanations above their own
level!

A question was raised recently in region 25 (UK) as to whether simply
being able to receive netmail during ZMH is sufficient qualification
to join Fido, given that much of the system is principally concerned
with echoes. While I can see the havoc that can be caused by
irresponsible sysops creating dupe-loops all over the place, I can't
see that a technically competent youngster is any more likely to
create such problems than a technically incompetent adult like me! In
fact probably far less likely.

Fido is becoming used by a wider range of people than the original
"anoraks" who set it all going. Most people now need only a very
limited understanding of the technical aspects to get going, as long
as they know when to stop when problems occur, and where to ask for
help before proceeding.

Having seen mature, technically competent males cause *deliberate*
havoc on various systems I can't see why kids and women should be
discriminated against for age, sex or implied ignorance.

Comment from Tom Chapman
From:Tom Chapman

     I recently read a article in last weeks fidonews written
by Ryan parks 1:232/19, claiming that Lee Busby NC for 1:232
net, said I refused his node number because I didn't think Lee
would approve it. That is entirely false. Lee told me not to
approve it because he was only 13, and that he was not running
twenty four hours a day, and Lee also told me he would back me
FidoNews 10-11                 Page:  4                    14 Mar 1992

100%. I used to have hub 1:232/400, I think that this is real
unfair to bring blame on me without asking myself or Lee exactly
what happened, kind of like not hearing both sides of the
story.. I do not have th Hub anymore because I relocated to a
different town. If you would like more input from me on this
matter you may netmail me at 1:232/10, that is where I pick up
my mail till I get my board back in operation...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Yet Another Message on Caller ID

Chris Farrar
1:246/20 - Windsor, Ontario, Canada

    First, I would like to thank those that have corresponded with me
via netmail regarding the use of Calling Line Identification, generally
refered to as Caller ID.  From the messages received, those supporting
my position are currently in the leading.

    I would now like to address some of the comments by in the latest
edition of Fidonews by Stanton McCandlish.   Mr. McCandlish raises some
interesting points, and I would like to take the time to reply to them.

    He is forgetting that nowhere is it written that he has any right
to be able to call a BBS.  When he calls a BBS, he is agreeing to abide
by the Sysop's rules, and if he doesn't like the rules, he can always
stop calling there.  The BBS won't cease to exist simply because he
can't call it.  As he says "*I* certainly won't be calling your board!"
that is completely within his rights, but he has no right to dictate
terms to the board's Sysop as to what conditions he will and will not
call.

    As for the use of Call Back Verifiers or CBV's, they are subject to
abuse.  I wonder how Mr. McCandlish would like to have some twit call
up a BBS and leave Mr. McCandlish's voice number and enter the CBV at
2 or 3 in the morning.  When the CBV calls back the number presented
by the user, Mr. McCandlish will be woken up, with the Sysop being the
one who will get the blame for waking up everyone that it calls back.

    As to the "legality" issue under FidoNet policy.  Caller ID systems
can be set to allow "blocked" numbers to connect with the mailer, and
let mail sessions be accomplished, while not letting a human who calls
with blocking to connect to the BBS program running beneath the mailer.
The Caller ID system can also be used to simply route the call to NUL,
so that it simply rings into oblivion until the caller times out.
Caller ID is presented between the first and second rings, and waiting
for it to be presented, and then letting the phone ring until time out
does not result in any charges, unless the person has a long distance
company that bills from the moment the number is dialed, including
the time spent ringing.  Also, for Mr. McCandlish's information, in
Region 12, precident has been set for using Bell Canada's "Call Screen"
service to prevent mailers from conneting with systems.  The call
from a "screened" number is routed to a telephone company recording
stating that the party contacted has chosen not to answer calls at
FidoNews 10-11                 Page:  5                    14 Mar 1992

this time.  Also, it has been acceptable for years to password out a
system that you didn't want connecting with you, so there is precident
that is contrary to the writings of Policy4.

    As for his last point regarding the "Bill of Rights", that document
isn't worth the paper it is written on outside United States soverign
territory, and his right to privacy ends when it hits my right to
privacy, and surely I should know who is invading my privacy when the
phone rings?

    And there is a solution.  Mr. McCandlish can always install a
second phone line with only a modem on it for BBSing, which can
present the phone number, as it won't be useful for a telemarketer to
call him back and try to sell him junk.

My Reply to "The Youth of FidoNet"

                 My Reply to "The Youth of FidoNet"

               Submitted by: Joshua Remus 1:2340/130

    I started my BBS on my 15th birthday. Started with many
BBS programs, and agreed with another sysop friend, that I
didn't want to join a network. However, after thinking a lot on
the subject, I decided I wanted to join a network. FidoNet
seemed a logical choice. I'd just like to say, while many of
the messages I've read on this, have said condensed: "No one
cared, thought I was incapable, etc..". I think I found just
the opposite.  The people in my net were VERY helpful, and all
over, had no bias of my age. I'll admit, I do not just ANNOUNCE
my name to all my users, but do run some Teen echoes, and cater
to the younger user.

  I just wanted to clear this up. I don't think I could
have gotten more help. I had some help with Front Door, and the
area sysops (My NC and NEC mainly, but others also!), help me
set up FD, and run FidoNet, then FamilyNet also. I have enjoyed
this all, and would like to be networked in every possible
network, except for the fact of limited income. Other than
that, there's no real difference between me and any other
sysops.  I work on my BBS daily, keep the files updated and
scanned, and keep the BBS running. I register things when I
can, and when not, keep within the legal boundaries. I really
enjoy using computers, and am programming my own door games in
Turbo Pascal.

  I realize some users, might be biased towards me if they
knew my age, but all over, the BBSing community in my area, has
not had these problems. Thank You. That's my two cents.

Reaching Out for Long Distance Savings

Reaching Out for Long Distance Savings:
Looking at Long Distance Plans in the USA

by Phillip M. Dampier
1:2613/228

One almost needs a degree to play pundit in the highly competitive long
distance telephone marketplace these days.  As the battle continues
between AT&T, Sprint, MCI, and dozens of smaller competitors, consumers
stand to gain significant savings on their long distance bills, if they
select the right plan for their needs.

Many Fidonet nodes spend upwards of hundreds of dollars each month on
long distance calling, many of whom are unaware of possible savings
they could enjoy if they signed up for the right long distance plan.

Here are some plans worthy of consideration for Fidonet nodes and their
callers.

AT&T
1-800-222-0300

Reach Out America
Reach Out Half Hour
Simple Savings

AT&T's old standby, Reach Out America (ROA), helped to pioneer deep
discounting in the residential long distance marketplace.  The plan,
first introduced in the 1980's has seen steady declines in price as
residential long distance usage continues to increase.

AT&T has several variations on the current ROA program.  *** PLEASE
NOTE, THE PRICING INFORMATION AND THE HOURS WHEN THE PLAN IS AVAILABLE
IS CURRENTLY AWAITING APPROVAL FROM THE FCC.  PLEASE CONTACT AT&T FOR
THE LATEST INFORMATION BEFORE PLACING CALLS UNDER THE NEW HOURS. ***

The plans discussed below are for out-of-state calls, also known as
"interstate" calls.

ROA Basic  -  This plan costs $7.50 for the first hour of calls placed
between 7pm-7:59am Monday to Friday, all day Saturday, and Sunday until
5pm.  You can call anywhere in the United States for the same rate.  You
will be billed for the entire first hour without regard to whether or
not you used the entire 60 minute allotment.  If you exceed 60 minutes,
each additional minute costs ten cents ($6.00 an hour).

ROA Evening  -  This plan costs $7.80 and includes all of the benefits
of the preceeding plan, but it also provides you with a 20% discount
FidoNews 10-11                 Page:  7                    14 Mar 1992

off all calls placed during the evening hours when the ROA plan is not
in effect (5:00-7:00pm weekdays, Sunday evening 5pm-10pm).

ROA Day  -  This plan is priced at $8.70 and includes a 25% discount
for calls placed during the evening rate period (as defined above) in
addition to giving you a 10% discount off all calls placed during the
day (8am-5pm).

AT&T is currently negotiating with the FCC regarding these changes, and
some revisions may be made in the next week or so.

If you find you don't place at least an hour in long distance calls
each month, AT&T offers an additional variation on Reach Out America:

ROA Half Hour  -  This plan gives you a half hour of long distance
calling at the times stated above for $4.00.  Each additional minute
costs 12 cents.

If you place over $30.00 in out-of-state calls per month, you should
consider AT&T's new Simple Savings program, which gives you a 25%
discount off calls placed to the interstate area code of your choice
based on AT&T's standard rates. All other calls receive a 15% discount.
This plan may be especially suited to those calls placed to locations
in your region that don't qualify for plans like Friends & Family,
described below.  Ask AT&T to give you the current rates for your calls
and figure your discounts.

Finally, AT&T offers a Reach Out plan for many individual states for
calls placed between points within a state (intrastate calls).

MCI
1-800-444-3333

Primetime
Friends & Family

MCI has become AT&T's most troublesome competitor for good reason --
they offer very competitive residential long distance plans which can
save people a great deal of money, if evaluated properly.

MCI offers two plans which are often tied together to realize maximum
savings.

Primetime:  This is MCI's answer to Reach Out America.  It is currently
undergoing revision and I expect to see even lower rates in response to
AT&T's tinkering with its own ROA program.  Primetime includes an hour
of long distance for calls both in and outside of your state for $9.95
for the first hour.  Each additional minute costs ten cents ($6.00 an
hour).  If you are calling only locations outside of your state, MCI
offers an interstate version of Primetime for $8.45.

Friends & Family:  Most people couple the Primetime program with
Friends & Family, MCI's attempt to gain new "dial-1/primary carrier"
customers. With Friends & Family, you switch your primary long distance
carrier to MCI (they will pay to switch you if you ask them).  Then,
FidoNews 10-11                 Page:  8                    14 Mar 1992

you specify up to 20 domestic numbers that also have MCI as their
primary carrier, and any time you call them, you receive a 20% discount
off those calls, bringing the cost down to as low as eight cents per
minute.  MCI also will allow you to choose two international numbers to
receive a 20% discount.  Many select numbers in Canada.

MCI also offers a myriad of residential and commercial class
volume-based discount plans.  Contact MCI for information on plans
applicable in your state.

Sprint
1-800-877-4000

The Most
Sprint Select In State
Sprint Select Out-of-State
Sprint +

Candice Bergen has done for Sprint what Bill Cosby has done for Jell-O.
Recognition means a lot in long distance, especially for third place
Sprint, which has been struggling to find a competitive niche between
MCI and AT&T.

Sprint's programs have generally closely followed whatever AT&T does,
and although their discount programs aren't as radical as MCI, in
several situations, Sprint may save you the most money.

Speaking of "the most," that happens to be the name of Sprint's heavily
promoted discount calling plan for residential customers.  The Most is
based on Sprint's standard dialing rates, which means it is distance
sensitive.  Call cross-country, for example, and you'll pay a great
deal more than calling the state next door.

The Most is also geared to convince customers to become Dial-1
customers of Sprint.  It provides for a 20% discount off all calls
placed to customers who also have Sprint as their primary carrier.

There is no limit, as is provided for in MCI's plan, and Sprint
computes the discount automatically if the number is signed up with
Sprint.  It means you don't have to give the long distance company the
names and numbers of all your friends.  In addition, The Most gives you
a 20% discount off all calls placed to the number you called most
frequently (time wise) during the previous month.  This is of special
interest to those calling commercial locations or mail servers that are
unable or unwilling to change their long distance carrier.  Should you
call a Sprint customer the most during that month, you receive 36% off
those calls.

Sprint also offers a plan along the lines of ROA.  They call it Sprint
Select, and it's provided in two versions -- one for in-state calls and
one for out-of-state calls.  The rates vary from state to state for the
in-state calling plan, but for New York (as an example), calls placed
between 5pm - 7:59am, all day Saturday and Sunday until 5pm cost $7.45
for the first hour, $6.55 each additional hour.

FidoNews 10-11                 Page:  9                    14 Mar 1992

Sprint's out of state plan is priced at $7.70 the first hour, $6.00
each additional hour (10 cents a minute).

Finally, for high volume users, Sprint has a plan called Sprint + which
offers volume discounts.  The discounts are retroactive to dollar one,
which means as you pass each "plateau," increasing discounts apply to
the entire balance.

You need to spend at least $20.00 a month to take advantage of this
plan.

If your calls total less than $100.00 in a month, you receive 10% off
all daytime calls and 20% off all evening and night/weekend calls.

If your calls total between $100-200, you receive a 10% daytime
discount and a 25% evening and night/weekend discount.

If your calls are over $200.00, you receive a 10% daytime discount and
a 30% discount off evening and night/weekend calls.

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

All of these plans may come across as confusing when you try to pick
the one that best meets your needs.

Here are some strengths and weaknesses of each company, to help you out
a little more:

More on caller id
By: Bob Seaborn 1:140/12@fidonet

There was an article in the 03/07/93 issue of Fidonews that
caught my attention and I felt that it requires an answer. It
has to do with Caller-ID, and it's use/abuse.
FidoNews 10-11                 Page: 11                    14 Mar 1992


First, a bit of background. I am a Broadcast Engineer, with
over 40 years of experience in the communications field.
Currently I own a communications consulting and maintenance
business, and one of our current projects is the development of
an economical Caller-ID interface for the MSDOS type  of
computers to aid any sysop in his BBS security. (I can be
reached at 1:140/12 if anyone wants to follow up on this)

        This should be the personal choice of any  sysop
concerned with security of his bbs.

        Exactly my point. If I don't want you calling my bbs
unless I know your phone number, then how can you ask me to let
you in anyway.

        No it's not ludicrous, it's merely one option to

        And call back verifiers is another. But why should I
pay for a long distance call to verify you? Especially when
your telco is capable of telling mine what your phone number is?
Furthermore, with a Caller-ID security system in place, you
would be authorized immediately on your first call, rather than
having to waste long distance time logging onto my bbs, opening
the call-back door, and then having my system (at my expense)
call you back. To me this makes more sense. Before I'm willing
to grant access to my computer, I want to know who the caller
is. That's my right. And having a valid telephone number is my
choice to identify you or anyone else. After all, Darth Vader is
most likely to be an alias, but how about William Smith. There's
probably thousands of William's out there just itching to call,
and I apologize to them all should they feel offended. But
anyone can use a name similar to this, and tell me that they're
calling from, say, Chicago. How many William Smith's are there
FidoNews 10-11                 Page: 12                    14 Mar 1992

in Chicago? And how would you propose that I be able to track
one particular one down should I need to? Assuming that the name
supplied on login was correct in the first place.

        And I don't think I would miss you.  That's not the
point.  I don't give out any user information that I gather in
my users list info without permission, but that's by my choice,
not by any law.  If you want access to my system, then prove
that you are who you say you are. And do it so it doesn't cost
me any extra. Furthermore, while I can try to understand your
reasons to hide your number, my gut feeling is that any time
someone's hiding something, they're up to something. And I
don't want that something affecting me.  Some telco's are
offerin an option that will intecept any "blocked" call and not
allow it to go through, instead giving the calling party a
canned message to the effect that "blocked" calls are not being
accepted by the person being called. I would sure consider that
option when/if SaskTel (my telco) offered that.

        Hey, now wait a minute. I have Caller-ID security in
place on my bbs. That's all. It is *NOT* in place for the
mailer.  Anyone can call here, leave me netmail, deliver
file-attached files, and do a file request, within the limits
that I set up for file-requesting. At no point are you in the
bbs. The Caller-ID security system takes over when you exit
from the mailer and enter the bbs - not before. And the
operation of any bbs that's run behind a mailer is not subject
to any 'policy' controlling access to the bbs.

        If you or anyone else wants more information on how I do
this here, I can be reached  at  1:140/12  netmail,  or
1-306-956-3240 fax, or 1-306-343-1767 voice.  See, I'm not
hiding my phone number from anyone.

        Only to Americans! I'm a Canadian, living in Canada, and
there's no US law that has any effect on me while I remain in
Canada. Just the same as there's no Canadian law that affects
you while you're in the US. However, while I live in area code
306, I constantly get phone calls from the US and overseas, and
more telcos every day are supplying the phone number for my
Caller-ID. I've seen calls from 505, 702, Australia, and so on
within the past few months, so this service becoming more
popular every day with more and more telcos supplying the
Caller-ID data on long distance connects.

Fidonet  1:2613/333
Internet jerry@rochgte.fidonet.org
"Electronic Mail to The White House"

Netmail to President Bill Clinton, Vice-President Al Gore, and their
staffs is now available from Fidonet.  The White House is now busy
establishing electronic-mail accounts on a number of mail networks,
including CompuServe, AmericaOnline, MCIMail, etc.

Members of Fidonet who want to correspond with The White House, can
address a Netmail message to WHITEHOUSE at 1:2613/333.  The writer's
full name and U.S. Postal address should also be included at the
beginning or end of the message.  There is no specific format for
messages at this time.

A spearate echomail conference called WHITEHOUSE is also available at
1:2613/333.  This read-only conference contains daily press releases and
other significant information that is released daily by the White House
Media Relations Department.

The U.S. House of Representatives is also currently working on an
electronic-mail project called ISIS (Integrated Systems and Information
Services).  ISIS will allow representatives to have e-mail access via
the Internet, and thus to a number of other mail networks like Fidonet.
I'll be posting more information about ISIS as the project gets
underway.

FILE_ECHO MESSAGE ECHO
by Kief Morris @1:110/210

File distribution is becoming more and more popular. In the old days,
automated file distribution via Fidonet mailers was the province of a
handful of sysops, a privilege restricted to a limited number of nodes.
This has started to change, especially with the advent of the Filebone,
which allows new FDN's (File Distribution Nets) to have a ready-built
distribution organization, and which allows any sysop to set up the
appropriate software and get a feed of files.

The appeal of this for sysops is obvious. Download directories can be
stocked with the latest files, which have already been checked to weed
out hacks, trojans, and virus infections. This "stocking" takes place
automatically, while the sysop sleeps with visions of 1600+ cps
transfers dancing in their head. Participating in file distribution is
quickly becoming an essential part of operating a serious Fidonet BBS.

What's been lacking until now is a good source of information for
setting up your system to get files from the Filebone and other file
distribution systems. What software do you need? How should you set it
up? How can you fix problems with the setup? How does one link in to the
Filebone or other file distribution systems? Is there better software
out there than what you've been using?

Introducing FILE_ECHO, an echo currently being distributed with plans to
reach the Zone 1 Backbone. This is a support echo for file distribution
software and related utilities. It is also intended to be a source of
information about new programs and utilities. Thirdly, it's a place to
ask basic questions about how one gets connected to FDN's. FILE_ECHO is
a learning ground for sysops new to file moving; a source of information
for sysops already involved in it, but interested in improving their
methods for doing so; and a forum for software authors to get feedback
from the users of their programs.

FILE_ECHO is a sister echo to FILE_REQ, the file announcement/file
search echo already on the Z1 Backbone. It is also hoped to find
reliable gateways to and into Zone 2, as well as other zones.

For information on getting a feed, contact 1:110/210. If you currently
participate in file distribution, especially with the Filebone, mention
who your uplink is, and be sure to let them know you are interested. In
many cases we may be able to arrange a link through existing file
distribution channels, until the echo reaches the backbone.

ENCRYPTED MESSAGE IDENTIFICATION FOR FIDONET
FSC-????

                ENCRYPTED MESSAGE IDENTIFICATION FOR FIDONET
                                *DRAFT I*
                        FIDONET TECHNICAL COMMENT
FidoNews 10-11                 Page: 15                    14 Mar 1992


                           Author :  John Mudge
                           Fido   :  1:352/111
                           Date   :  25FEB1993

ABSTRACT:

The following document proposes a standard for encrypted message
identification for Fidonet and Fidonet-based electronic mail
systems.

The proposed standard will assist in encrypted-message detection.
The standard consists of mandatory and suggested portions; however
the term "mandatory" does not mean that any Fidonet product must
implement this standard; it simply means that those that do claim
to implement this standard must do so in the way described.

STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT:

This FSC suggests a proposed protocol for the Fidonet(R)
community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
improvements.  Distribution of this document is unlimited.

Fido and Fidonet are registered marks of Tom Jennings and Fido
Software.

BACKGROUND:

Currently, Fidonet encrypted messages are not uniquely identified.
A variety of schemes are in place to determine whether a message
received by a Fidonet node has been encrypted, but all of them
involve encryption method specific tests.  Current Fido Policy
(Policy4) prohibits routing encrypted material through systems which
have not given specific prior approval.  This FSC proposes a method
of identifying such traffic, but makes no effort to determine what
action should be taken after the identification.

IFNA KLUDGE LINES:

Fidonet supports a general method for sending additional information
embedded in a message known as the "IFNA kludge line".  This is a
line of text beginning with the ASCII SOH character (^A).  The
characters following SOH are a word indicating the type of kludge
line, and the remainder of the line contains information specific
to that type.  This standard introduces a new type of kludge line,
the ENC.

FORMAT OF A MESSAGE ID - MANDATORY:

The mandatory portion of the ^AENC line shall consist of the Ascii SOH
character immediately followed by the uppercase characters ENC and a
colon and one space.

FORMAT OF A MESSAGE ID - SUGGESTED:

FidoNews 10-11                 Page: 16                    14 Mar 1992

It is suggested, though not required, that the unique part of all
^AENC lines consist of a unique product identifier following the
same format as specified in FSC-0046 for ^APID kludge lines and
identifying the program used for encryption.  This product identifier
will allow message editors to invoke the appropriate decryption
software.

EXAMPLE:

^AENC: PGP2.1
with PGP21 to be replaced with a two digit hex identifier at such
time as a central product registry exists.

IMPLEMENTATIONS:

As of this writing, several products are being written, notably by
Fredric Rice and GK Pace, to implement this proposal.  Examples of
currently available programs are GENMSG V1.30 and PGP-TOSS.

SUMMARY:

As of this date, no public repository exists for encryption/decryption
product registration, but the FTSC is suggested as is the application
form presented in FSC-0022.

I am publishing this information as a Fidonet technical comment in hopes
that other Fidonet products will eventually incorporate all or part of
this standard as well, and that it will eventually form part of a
Fidonet Technical Standard.

CREDITS:

I would like to thank all of the pioneers of Fidonet for making all of
this possible.  The ^AENC proposal is the result of the collective
efforts of many of the participants of the Fido PUBLIC_KEYS echo.  Much
of the wording and structure for this document I stole from authors of
previous FSC authors.  Special thanks go to GK Pace and Fredric Rice for
their ongoing programming efforts in support of public-key encryption
systems.
