     =================================================================

     Friday's Nodelist [227] seems less synchronized than usual but hope
     springs eternal. ZC3 reports Nodelist synch status in his Zone below.

     Zone 5 now has an Internet address. The FTSC address has changed from
     the previous Nugent URL to the mirror URL operated by Adrian Walker
     who is currently attempting to start a new FTSC [see 1432]. These are
     listed in the FidoNet by Internet section and on the FidoNews webpage.
     There is also updated info on the FidoNet Resource page in this Issue.

     An effort is underway to save BBSing as a sport in spite of Internet-
     induced losses of audience. That info also appears below.

     Gregg Jennings offers a Guest Editorial following.

     FidoPeople
     By Gregg Jennings, 1:331/109

     [This is not quite an article; more of a letter to the editor, but not
     in reference to any article, so it's a Guest Editorial!]

     I was writing a friend of mine about a bit of the history of Fido and
     FidoNet, something that I know a little bit about, something that I
     have a unique perspective of, being a Jennings, if you get my meaning.

     And I used a disparaging remark about the. . . well, I'll just say
     that I was complaining about the FidoDissenters and FidoComplainers.

     After I had saved the message, it being a form of electronic mail, I
     realized that I was not quite right in my assessment of FidoPeople.

     In a related issue, that of the FidoDeathKnellers, is that even now in
     Usenet, there are people speaking of the "Death of Usenet", that
     Usenet must "change or die". Pretty eerie ain't it?

     What I'm getting at is that FidoNet is a pretty cool "place", or
     rather, a pretty cool "thing", or even more `rather', a pretty cool
     "implementation of a great idea".

     Many people make FidoNet work, and boy does FidoNet work! It does.  It
     really does. There are more good things than bad, "here".

     Yeah, I'm sick of hearing the complaints! But so what? We have to hear
     all sides and all views. The worst thing would be one of two things:
     all complaints or nothing at all.

     Well, we ain't got all complaints! And we still have something!

     What it boils down to is that there is much good with and within
     FidoNet. I really feel that. I have met, as one can meet "voices" in
     this medium, many good people, good FidoPeople. Yeah there are jerks.
     I've been a jerk, some will say.

     But I grow. I learn. I change. FidoNet grows and changes. And it will
     grow and change because people really do do things.

     We must acknowledge those that came before and will come again and are
     here now. Both the "voices" and the developers.

     So I'm weird! What about you? What is your view?

     So I don't make sense. Or do I? Do you?

     If you don't say it. Nobody will.

     You could be right.

     Subj: Help Keep Local BBS's Viable!!

      * Original to: Al Koller (1:374/3)

     -------------------------------------------------
     Fellow SysOps - The INTERNET has made a serious negative impact on
     Community Dial-Up BBS's, as we are all aware. We have formed a
     movement to re-awaken Community interest in BBS's and the benefits of
     the LOCAL BBS as an adjunct to their Internet adventures.. :-)

              Please help us propagate this positive initiative!!
     =================================================================
     Who We Are:

     The Council for Online Community Alternatives (COCA) was formed in the
     summer of 1997 by a group of dedicated Bulletin Board System (BBS)
     System Operators (SYSOPs) with a common goal....To Keep BBSing Alive!

     COCA membership is free and open to all sysops, regardless of bbs
     software and geographic location.

     Our Mission:

     The mission of the Council for Online Community Alternatives (COCA) is
     to promote BBSes and BBS/Web sites as an "Online Community
     Alternative" to mere internet browsing and to bring awareness to
     computer users of the availability of "Local Community BBS's" in their
     area.

     It has become apparent with the growth of the internet that the role
     of the community based BBS has become unclear and the awareness of
     their existence obscure.

     It is the premise of COCA that in recent years millions of people, who
     never owned computers prior, went out and bought computers to seek out
     the benefits of online communication. The internet was not only widely
     publicized, but has become a business and educational tool, and is
     known to most people in today's modern society across the world.


     Our Goals:

     1) To make the public aware that BBSes are in existence and that the
     vast majority of them address most, if not all, of today's concerns
     with the shortcomings of the internet.

     FIDONEWS 14-33               Page 5                   18 Aug 1997


     The internet has value and a place in today's world. However, it's
     enormity and lack of organization tend to leave countless numbers of
     people yearning for something more.

     2) To make the public aware of the Local Community BBS's in their
     area. Many new computer owners are not aware of the existence of the
     Local BBS. They need to be advised and educated.


     Channels of Communication:

     Communication and education are the keys to making the public aware
     of bbs's.

     COCA maintains a variety of methods to keep communications open
     between it's members:

     1) COCA Listserve (promote@atlsky.com)

     To join send an e-mail to listserve@atlsky.com
     put SUBSCRIBE PROMOTE in the body of the message

     2) COCAnet BBS Network

     COCAnet was started as an effort to archive the listserve messages. It
     has evolved into a 5 conference network to allow members without
     e-mail access to read the listserve messages and have 2-way
     communications with other COCA members. The COCAnet info packet is
     available for download on the COCA Website. COCAnet is available via
     dial-up, telnet, WWW, e-mail and ftp in both QWK and FTSC formats.

     3) PROMOTE_BBS is a new conference on FIDOnet

     This conference is gated to a conference of the same name on COCAnet.
     It has been posted in the FIDOnet ECHOLIST conference and that posting
     is copied below for your information.  For FIDOnet sysops interested
     in carrying the conference on their BBS, please keep this information
     and note that the conference will be listed in the September 1st Elist
     file (ELIST709.TXT):

     4) COCA Web Site - http://coca.home.ml.org

     Our web site consists of many different areas of interest and
     new pages are added all the time.

     Highlights include:

     a) List of Member BBS's
     b) List of Members and their Bio's
     c) Calendar of Events
     d) Web Site Information Update Form

     5) COCA ICQ LIST

     If you are running ICQ add your name to the list at:
     http://cocalist.home.ml.org
     FIDONEWS 14-33               Page 6                   18 Aug 1997


     6) COCA Web Ring

     If you run a bbs on the internet add it to the Web Ring at:
     http://cocalist.home.ml.org

     7) COCA IRC Chat Meetings

     The Steering Committee meets every Wednesday.
     Public Chat Meetings are held alternating Tuesdays/Thursdays
     every other week.  See the Calendar for details.

     Join the effort! Join COCA!! Let's keep Community BBS's viable!

     It's the Human Way
     by Lee Kindness, 2:259/7, wangi@earthling.net

     A response to Steve Woodmore's article titled "A response to lee
     Kindness's Counter proposal InetTM flags" (which didn't contain
     anything relevant to my counter proposal) in FIDONEWS 14-31, 4 Aug
     1997.

      SW> I am a "doer" not a "talker", in other words if I see
      SW> something that I think needs doing, i will try and do
      SW> it, and not just sit Around flapping my lips and trying
      SW> to insult everyone that attempts anything.

     Right, what you're trying to say is that i'm a 'talker' and not
     'doer'. Indeed. I'm quite sure past posts and articles by myself would
     prove otherwise...

     And Steve, you are a 'talker' - the worlds fastest i do believe ;)

      SW> However your petty insults at the beginning are
      SW> indicative of every thing that is wrong in fidonet today,
      SW> you just couldn't write something constructive could you?,
      SW> you just had to have your little dig, didn't you? Next time
      SW> you respond to someone who is trying to improve the network
      SW> for all of us, step out from behind your petty little ego,
      SW> and think of the reasons as to why people do things.

     Yes I took a dig at you but it was part of article which was overall
     very positive. I am a human - I have opinions, I am as petty as the
     next man and I will show it! I'm not a emotionless robot!

     Fidonet is about communication, and communication is personal.  I will
     always voice my opinions and stand up for my views!  No matter how
     petty they may be...

     Anyway Steve, you're hardly they guy to be lecturing me or anyone else
     about pettiness!

                          TRUE STORIES OF FIDONET

     Subject: Mailed from FidoNews homepage
     Date: Wed, 13 Aug 1997 03:33:13 GMT

     Okay ... I'm here at work when I should be home asleep.  So while I'm
     waiting for a program to finish so I can see if it works, I started
     surfing the web.  Somehow I hit a reference to "Fidonet" so I start
     think "hmmm ... I wonder what's happening in that world since I left
     it."

     And I kept trying to remember the names of some of the people I "met"
     through Fidonet.  One guy I recalled was the regional whatever and was
     18/14 before I was 18/14 ... but I couldn't remember his name so I
     started looking for more Fidonet stuff on the Internet.

     I run across a page with FidoNews on it ... boy that brings back
     mem...uhh... wait a minute ... that's the guy - Chris Baker!

     I sort of left the BBS world behind when I moved from Fort Walton
     Beach to Orlando and discovered the Internet.  But some of my BBS past
     remains - the program Oblio which I wrote to help me create and
     maintain my web pages (www.jadebox.com) is based on the interpreter in
     the BBS program, Oratorio, which I wrote and had used to host the
     RSBBS (1:366/14).

     Can you believe that there were only 400 nodes in the nodelist when I
     joined FidoNet?  Can you believe I still recognize several names in
     the current FidoNews?

     Anyway ... it's late.  I should be home and sleeping, so I better go
     before the 16 cans of "Surge" I've consumed today catch up with me
     ....

     Take care ... and ....

     Here's another story you might like to share ....

     I first met Lloyd Wood when I began visiting BBSs over 10 years ago.
     He ran the "Hot Muddy Duck" in Shalimar, Florida.  I lived nearby in
     Fort Walton Beach. Although "Woody" was somewhat older than me and our
     FIDONEWS 14-33               Page 10                  18 Aug 1997


     views on just about every subject were different, we became friends.
     On his BBS or in person, Woody was never shy about stating his
     opinion. But he always did so with an endearing, warm sense of humor.

     I think I talked Woody into joining Fidonet.  He had resisted for a
     while  - I think he just didn't want to have to fight with the
     required software - but, I guess the prospect of a larger audience and
     more conversation got to him and he joined our net as 366/73.

     As you might be able to tell by the node number he chose, Woody was an
     amateur radio enthusiast.  One day he was 50 feet up an antenna mast
     when he suffered a heart attack.  Fortunately, the antenna's site was
     just a block from a hospital and Woody recovered well.

     The experience gave him a new soapbox.  He began preaching the
     benefits of a healthy lifestyle.  I recall that he told me once that
     one ounce of chocolate has the same amount of fat as seventy pounds of
     fish.  I think my reply was something like, "well, I'd rather eat one
     ounce of chocolate than seventy pounds of fish ...."  That's a good
     example of how most of our on-line conversations went.

     About three years ago I moved from Fort Walton beach to Orlando.  I
     retired my BBS (the RSBBS) and joined the Internet crowd.  I also lost
     contact with a lot of my BBS friends including Woody.

     Some time passed and one day I received an e-mail message from Woody.
     He'd gotten connected to the Internet and somehow had found my
     address.  We began exchanging messages and he signed me up to his joke
     mailing list. He also connected me with a few others I had known back
     in my Fidonet days.

     Only a few weeks after we began exchanging e-mail, I heard from a
     mutual friend that Woody had died in his sleep.  Of course, I was
     really saddened - I had lost a friend of many years.  But as I look
     back on it, I'm so happy that e-mail had been able to bring us back
     together, if only for a short time.

     Thanks to BBSs, FidoNet, and the Internet, I - and many others - had
     the pleasure of knowing Lloyd Wood.  73.

     Subj: Nodelist Synchronisation

     G'day Christopher!

     As of nodelist 227 the Zone 3 issue contains:

     Zone 1 = 143
     Zone 2 = 206
     Zone 4 = 220
     Zone 5 = 213
     Zone 6 = 164

     The Zone 2 segment should have been 227 but an error in my new setup
     missed incorporating the difference files I had managed to obtain.

     I still have to obtain a complete segment for Zones 1 and 6 to bring
     them back into sync with what turns up in ZSEGS, but we also need to
     locate and fix whatever is causing the odd file to be lost in the
     ZSEGS file distribution.

     I expect that a working file distribution will correct much of the
     problem.

     Subject: Second good one today...
     From: wsl3@juno.com (William S Lockwood III)

     Internally, Microsoft has been naming its products after cities, with
     names such as "Memphis", and "Cairo".

     If this trend takes off in the software industry as a whole, we may
     see some more cynical names being used ...

     "Bataan" - A team of programmers pull a series of all-nighters and
       drive themselves to the point of collapse in order to meet the
       release date.

     "Stalingrad" - The project turns out to be far more difficult than
       expected. Management responds by assigning more and more programmers
       to the development effort, but it ultimately fails.

     "Dresden" - The company that originally owned the product goes down in
       flames. As part of the liquidation, the product ends up in the hands
       of a competitor, who severely mismanages it.

     "Beirut" - Internal squabbling among the programmers turns the project
       into a basket case. Senior management comes in, kicks some heads,
       and gets the project back on track. But the programmers still hate
       each other.

     "Carthage" - After two previously unsuccessful releases, a third
       version of the product is released. This also fails. The project's
       programmers are dispersed, and the product's name is never spoken
       again.

     "Jerusalem" - The ultimate legacy application. Generations of hacks,
       fixes, patches, different operating systems, and changes of
       management have produced an application that is completely
       unmaintainable.

     "Mumbai" - For reasons best known to themselves, marketing tries to
       sell an existing well-known product under a new name. The typical
       response from customers is a blank stare, followed by "Oh, you mean
       Bombay".

     "Nanking" - After the developers fail to produce a successful product,
       management punishes the guilty and innocent alike with mass
       sackings.

     With Gassho,
     Scott
