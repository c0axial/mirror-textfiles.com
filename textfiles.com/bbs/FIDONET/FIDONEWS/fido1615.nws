     FidoCop - a netmail response
     Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     I'd like to thank the readers of Fidonews who have seen fit to
     correspond with me on the articles I write for Fidonews.  It's
     encouraging to find out there are more than six people reading, so I
     try to reply to each message.  I'd like to share this correspondence
     with Amir Shabashvili of Russia concerning the article last week.
     He disagrees with me, but he's especially polite about it, and
     eloquent in presenting his own point of view.

     ----------- extract of a netmail reply to Mr. Shabashvili -----------

      AS> I think I got you point. let me reply on only sentence from your

      You've got the context right.  From what you describe, I'm doubly
      surprised:

      (1) Surprised that licensing got to be an issue with the user,
      since he didn't have to pay any money to use the advanced version,
      and

      (2) That the developer would insist on licensing which he
      essentially gives away anyway.


      AS> As far as I know, author asked other side to stop unlicensed

      AS> think not.

      Many of the arguments in Fidonet seem driven more by testosterone
      levels than by standards of behavior.  This seems little different.

      AS> (Mac is very exotic computer in 2:R50).

      AS> Behavior like described above lead us to author's copywrite and
      AS> local laws violation (remember,Policy4 told us "2.1.1  <...> and
      AS> do not promote or participate in the distribution of pirated
      AS> copyrighted software or other illegal behavior via FidoNet"), but
      AS> as for me, moral aspect of the problem is more important.

      I view the section of policy which you quote to mean that one
      should not use Fido as a means of carrying on an illegal activity,
      not as an excuse to use Fido as a club to enforce legality.  The
      legal issue is essentially between the user and the developer, and
      uninvolved parties should not be required to enforce anything.


      AS> Of course, we can't judje well, we are not professional lowyers,
      AS> but we not talking about real life, we talking about virtual

      AS> for any problem resolution. Why we can not use it in this case?
      AS> Why we must call a police? Police can't excommunicate someone
      AS> from FidoNet. Better I call my NC/RC:)

      Police can't hang people either.  Better you call your local
      vigilante committee :)

      Why is excommunicating someone from Fido the proper way to handle
      software misuse?  Should the software pirate's voice line be cut?
      Should his children be expelled from school?  Should his driving
      privileges be revoked?

      Problem resolution on Fido should be restricted to the actual
      problems affecting Fido - not to resolve moral issues.

      Certainly we owe software developers our respect and cooperation,
      but the efforts such as file distribution networks which help
      promote their efforts are sufficient.  Acting as enforcers for
      software licensing is going too far.


      AS> I think, coordinators at any level must process formal policy
      AS> complaints dealing with license violation. They must applied such
      AS> complaints from software developers only, not from anyone, but
      AS> they must.

      Let me ask you a question:  what should happen to coordinators who
      don't deal with license violations?  Should they be fired?
      Excommunicated?  Criminally prosecuted?  Keep in mind that these
      coordinators are volunteers who simply may not wish to devote the
      time to all the good causes we could ask of them.


      AS> It is _very_ important case for Russia, because of a lot of
      AS> pirated CD's saled on every corner, and more than 90% of
      AS> installed software isn't legal. In FidoNet too, not 90%, but a

      AS> lot, using cracked software and fake keys is usial!

      AS> We can't quickly change that. But, we must try.

      Why must we try?  I honestly respect your opinion concerning the
      morality of using pirated software... but now we're getting into
      what's sold in the street corners, far afield from what's being
      done in my hobby.  By virtue of my participation in Fidonet, have I
      incurred an obligation to safeguard the financial interests of
      those who write games for children or spreadsheets for bigger
      children?

      Do I someday get to the point where my obligations consume the time
      I once freely gave to others in persuit of my hobby?

     (This is reply on Douglas Myers 1:270/720 article named "FIDOCOP"
     in the first April issue)

     Dear Douglas!

     I think I got you point. let me reply on only sentence from your
     excellent article:
      DM> For Fidonet sysops to act against and individual who has
      DM> possibly broken the law would essentially be an act of
      DM> vigilantism, itself against the law.

     You talking in context of Andreas Klein's letter connected with
     Ward's decision on well-known there in 2:R50 conflict beetween FTN
     software developer and network member who illegally used mailer
     software (Ravel for Mac). (Just for info, Ravel isn't commercial
     or shareware soft, it is free, but licensed software. Ever more,
     there are 2 versions: first - absolutely free, with usial free
     license, and second (advanced), for using it you need to ask author's
     permission and receive (free!) key.)

     As far as I know, author asked other side to stop unlicensed usage of
     his software and got in reply something like "go to hell", + some
     abuse lines in the local pointlist was placed. Do you think, it must
     be normal behavior (except abuse stuff)? I think not.

     I think, the normal would be to stop usage of unlicensed software and
     install free version. There are a lot of free FTN software appears in
     last the years, no problemo with that, ever for Mac (Mac is very
     exotic computer in 2:R50).

     Behavior like described above lead us to author's copywrite and local
     laws violation (remember,Policy4 told us "2.1.1  <...> and do not
     promote or participate in the distribution of pirated copyrighted
     software or other illegal behavior via FidoNet"), but as for me,
     moral aspect of the problem is more important.

     Of cource, we can't judje well, we are not professional lowyers, but
     we not talking about real life, we talking about virtual community,
     where FidoNet policy and common sence are widely used for any problem
     resolution. Why we can not use it in this case? Why we must call a
     police? Police can't excommunicate someone from FidoNet. Better I
     call my NC/RC:)

     I think, coordinators at any level must process formal policy
     complaints dealing with license violation. They must applied such
     complaints from software developers only, not from anyone, but they
     FIDONEWS 16-15               Page 5                   12 Apr 1999


     must.

     It is _very_ important case for Russia, because of a lot of pirated
     CD's saled on every corner, and more than 90% of installed software
     isn't legal. In FidoNet too, not 90%, but a lot, using cracked
     software and fake keys is usial!

     We can't quickly change that. But, we must try.

     Best regards,

     Amirko

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:228/158

     Well, it has been quite a while. Been wondering if I should come
     back. Guess I just did. <grin>

     Everything is out of date. I've got a backlog, but while I catch
     up on old mail, I also want to get new mail as well. So write me.

     There's been some speculation about web page listings and e-mail
     addresses for this list. I do plan to add them to the web version
     of this list within the next couple of weeks. Please send them in.

     Please note the new contact info:
