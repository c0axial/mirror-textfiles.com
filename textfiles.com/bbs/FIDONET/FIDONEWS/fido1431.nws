     Sometimes it seems like complaining is the only exercise some folks in
     FidoNet ever get but I'm sure it's just a by-product of the culture of
     whiners produced by the 'ME' generation. At least we don't have law
     suits going over every imagined slight or superficial wounding as they
     do in the real world. Every cloud has a silver lining? [grin]

     There is at least one real alert in today's Issue for those in the
     U.S.A. Basic privacy is under threat again in the 'land of the free'
     and unless the masses wake up, their next nap may end in a police
     state. Kinda makes one want to check out the next local militia
     meeting. [yikes!]

     I notice the Echomail weenies still don't want to go start their own
     Echomail network instead of trying to convert this one. If we could
     harness all this unproductive flaming energy, we could send Jodie
     Foster to Vega without a machine.

     I haven't seen or heard anything of the results of the Zone 3
     Coordinator election so there is no follow-up this week. Who won?

     Zone 6 needs server assistance and asks for it below. We do get
     constructive material from time to time and are happy to assist.

     Would anyone out there be interested in translated editions of
     FidoNews? Does anyone have or make software that could handle such a
     task?

     =================================================================
                              GUEST EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     From: Ken Wiebe <kwiebe@Mail.Spydernet.Com>
     Subject: Fido decline is not merely a technical issue

     I've been involved with fidonet for many years, first as a BBS user,
     and for the past 7 or 8 years as sysop of the Classical Liberal BBS
     (1:340/47). Your guest editorial in FIDONEWS -- Volume 14, Number 28
     14 July 1997 was right on the money in his assessment of the technical
     aspects related to the decline of fidonet, and the possible uses of
     the internet to reverse that decline. However, there is much more to
     this than the technical considerations. Technical decline has happened
     in fidonet not because of foreign competition from the internet, but
     rather, it is due to rot from within fidonet.

     The last paragraph of your guest editorial asks the crucial question:

     >>>>
     Only one question remains.  The question that remains is this: are
          there enough good people, hackers, developers, visionaries, and
          interest left in the FidoNet to make this new "FidoNet-IP" a
          reality?

     <<<<

     The fact that such people exist is not in doubt. The fact that many of
     them are involved to some extent with fidonet is not in doubt. So the
     question is: Why is this not being done now?

     I suggest that answer to that question lies in the organizational
     makeup of fidonet. Fidonet is a hobbyists network, a network composed
     of people who like the autonomy and the freedom of a hobby network,
     where every sysop is the master of his little domain. In essence, it
     is a tinkerer's dream. Much like the intrepid inventors of the 19th
     century, every fido sysop has his own little tricks, his own
     particular style, and his own way of doing things on his BBS. And that
     is how it should be. That's what makes fidonet an interesting and
     enjoyable hobby.

     However, there is a problem. In order for all the sysops to send mail,
     some order has to be drawn out of the chaos and that led to the
     creation of a fidonet hierarchy for the purposes of establishing
     standards. Nothing wrong with that, so far as it goes, but in recent
     years it has gone well beyond that, to the point that certain fidonet
     personalities have exceeded their legitimate role and now meddle in
     every aspect of fidonet. They have gone as far as threatening to sever
     links to whole nodes as a means of avoiding the embarrassment of
     admitting to some serious errors in judgement.

     A certain amount of 'big-shot-ism' is to be expected in any volunteer
     organization, but when it is allowed to grow beyond being merely
     annoying, to the point where a few people can order Planet Connect
     feed-cuts to whole nodes for non-technical (political) reasons, then
     it is no longer a fun hobby for anyone who is harassed and threatened
     FIDONEWS 14-31               Page 3                    4 Aug 1997


     in that manner. Such treatment was the reason I severed nearly all
     involvement with fidonet, and I do not anticipate re-joining in any
     significant way until this problem is adequately addressed by the net.
     And, I am far from being alone in this assessment of fidonet.

     Nobody with any talent will invest much time and effort in fidonet-
     related developments only to see their efforts sabotaged by a small
     clique of power-drunk oafs. Especially when those power-drunk oafs are
     intent on running the whole show and exercising editorial control of
     fidonet. Who needs that sort of hassle?

     In conclusion, yes, there are technical issues to resolve if fidonet
     is to reverse it's decline... but compared to the organizational
     issues, the technical ones are minor. If we re-structure fidonet to be
     what it was supposed to be, organized anarchy without any kings,
     potentates or fidoghods... then fidonet might actually attract (and
     keep) sufficient good people, hackers, developers and visionaries with
     enough interest in fidonet to make it worthwhile. Or, leave the
     Bodgers, Walkers and Stecks of the world in position to run roughshod
     over people and watch fidonet die.

     It's your net, and it's your choice.

      Protecting the Innocent

     Here in R25 we have just had a problem with a BBS USER exploiting a
     previously unknown hole within the "Blue Wave" mail door.

     This has led to an explosion of obscene "Spams" being posted to almost
     every available echo here in this region.

     As sysops we can only ever be "re-active" and certainly NOT "pro-
     active".

     Because these "Spams" crossed the "pond" into Z1, as ZEC/2 my inbox
     has been full this week of Z1 moderators requesting that the sysops
     who allowed these "Spams" to be posted from their systems be excluded
     from their echoes.

     Well In conjunction with REC25, as ZEC I will make sure that just will
     not be happening.

     Forget it, neither of us will sanction a feed cut against a sysop who
     could not know about this hole.

     I am amazed that some people could even write some of the things that
     they have, I have had one guy telling me to cut access to the whole of
     NET254 (London Net) because one system in NET254 was hit by this
     "spammer".

     Incredible!....

     These sysops were innocently duped by this "Spammer".

     As ZEC and in conjunction with REC25,  we made a decision last week
     that I thought we would never have to make.

     Both of us interfered with and deleted echomail in transit through our
     systems, REC25 removed the "spams" from internal R25 echomail, and I
     removed them from outbound R25 echomail to Z1.

     We did this for several reasons, To protect the innocent sysops who
     were duped from over zealous Z1 moderators, to protect other sysops
     FIDONEWS 14-31               Page 5                    4 Aug 1997


     who have to move the mail from higher phone bills, and to stop this
     "spammers" fun.

     This is (I hope) the only time I will ever have to interfere with In
     transit echomail again, and it is the only action that will be taken
     in regards to these "spams".

     I am not the only route for outbound echomail from R25, and these
     "spams" may well have got out through other routes.

     As a region (R25) we have now done everything possible to minimise
     this problem, so any requests for feeds to cut over this arriving here
     will just go > NULL.

     Welcome to the FLAME mailing list!

     This mailing list is connected to the FLAME discussion group, which
     was formerly part of the Fidonet North American Backbone distribution
     system.  Since it was pulled from the backbone, a group of the
     regulars have dedicated themselves to make it as available as possible
     to anyone, regardless of the tyranny Fidonet hands out at times.  As a
     FIDONEWS 14-31               Page 6                    4 Aug 1997


     result, steve steffler (steve@gen.lcrnet.org) has provided this
     mailing list, which will allow anyone with an internet email address
     (which encompasses a LOT of people) to participate in the FLAME echo.

     What is the FLAME echo?  For years, the FLAME echo has been an
     internationally distributed  Fidonet discussion group where anyone
     could come in and vent their anger or have some fun by insulting (or
     FLAMEing) the other people there, and the occasional uninformed newbie
     that would venture in.  Since the people in charge of the North
     American Fidonet Backbone (an entity which distributes the Fidonet
     content to many points as a commercial service) was getting itself
     flamed to death in the FLAME echo, it decided to play war games, and
     pulled FLAME from the backbone, leaving it with only a few people who
     could access it (those who were connected to it via the Planet Connect
     service - see http://www.pconnect.com).

     Slowly but surely, many Regional Coordinators and just plain good
     hearted individuals who were concerned about echomail censorship
     decided to create their own distribution system to replace the
     dictators in Fidonet.  Thus, the Fidospine and RATBB (Route Around The
     Bastards Backbone) were formed.  FLAME is once again active,
     containing an average of 30-40 new messages a day, and since it is not
     an official entity of Fidonet any longer, the general rules of Fidonet
     do not necessarily apply.  As a result, this mailing list was born, to
     facilitate bringing more FLAMErs into the echo who wouldn't normally
     have access to it.  We are targeting the potential FLAMErs of
     newsgroups like the alt.flame.* hierarchy and exFLAMErs who had their
     connection to FLAME cut when the North American Backbone exercised
     their stupidity.

     The moderator of FLAME is John Clifton, but he has essentially cut
     loose the echo, since he was sick of the way those in power were
     treating himself and it.  His old rules were essentially this:

     1) No excessive swearing, but the occasional four letter word here and
        there is acceptable.

     2) No encoded files (MIME,UUE,etc) are to be posted to the mailing
        list or the echo.

     3) Do not forge your message to make it appear as if you are someone
        else.

     [Help! I need an old copy of the rules, these are all i can remember
     right now!  Email me at steve@gen.lcrnet.org if you have a copy, or
     reply to this message with them.]

     Hello C Baker,

     Could you kindly edit and submit the following either as part of your
     editorial or as a snippet in an upcoming FidoNews. Thanks.

     --- Start

     Calling all Fidonetters who are able to run name servers in Zone 6.

     Currently only Taiwan and Philippines are running name servers for
     nets in the .z6.fidonet.org domain. I would like to call out to
     members in the fidonet community in the remaining regions and nets in
     Zone 6 to run their own name servers. So that I may be able to
     delegate name server records for nets in the remaining Regions. They
     are India, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan &
     Korea.

     Thank you.

     FIDONET NEEDS JUST ONE MORE LITTLE PIECE OF SOFTWARE

     By Pete Snidal, 1:354/910

        Let's face it; whether you use it yourself or not, you have to
     acknowledge that what made Fidonet was the advent of Binkleyterm,
     Squishmail, and Maximus.  There followed a number of "easier" and
     "slicker" programmes, but these pioneers of Fidonet Messaging
     Technology are what gave us this marvelous little network we have
     today.  Well, now, I suggest, if Fidonet is to "meet the challenge of
     the Internet," (gag!  puke!) it's time somebody developed just one
     more piece we can add to the suite.

        I read with great interest the anonymous letter from a sysop about
     the need for compatibility of netmail with internet email.
        This could be the thing which would undoubtedly save Fidonet from
     the (some feel) imminent death by internet.  Personally, I feel that
     there are many things that Fido does better - Fidoechoes are far
     superior to Usenet newsgroups or mailing lists, for instance.  In
     friendliness, ease of use, and just plain inexpense.  Access to
     Fidoechoes doesn't cost the $15 to $30 per month that a user has to
     pay to access the internet and its newsgroups.

        But it is a serious fact that email and netmail have to merge
     somehow.  In the early days of snailmail, it quickly became apparent
     that more than one non-interconnected mail service just didn't cut it
     - that's why governments stepped in.

        In the days of the Fidonet/Internet mailgate(s), it was a little
     better, but this was awkward and little used.  Much better would be
     for each Fidonet node itself to be gated to the internet.

        "Whoa!," you say?  Radical?  Not really.  A mild melding of the
     two systems in this way could well mean the saving of Fidonet, by the
     introduction of a new, super-powerful service we could call Fidonet
     II -  Son of Fidonet.

           If your node had an internet account, here's what could be
     accomplished:

             1)  You could set up to up and down your mail packets each
             day by ftp'ing your hub.  Well, actually, the ftp site which
             your net would have to have set up for the purpose, as many
             have as we speak.  End of LD polling.  End of PConnect.

             2)  If the software existed, why not also have your node
             "poll" your ISP and drop off/pick up all your users email
             a number of times per day?  Hourly would be fine, or, for
             outbound, even Continuous Mail - when a user drops off email,
             as soon as s/he drops carrier, your bbs, with its fancy new
             as-yet-to-be-developed software, dials your isp and exchanges
             email packets.  Your tosser then tosses any incoming email
     FIDONEWS 14-31               Page 10                   4 Aug 1997


             into your netmail area, addressed to the right persons, of
             course, and Bob's yer uncle!

        This kind of setup could be accomplished, if the software existed,
     that is, with single-line systems, for no more than the price of the
     ISP account.  And most sysops already have one of those anyway.  If
     you don't, there should be enough time left over for you to play in
     the web and stuff as a bonus.

        What would be the advantage of Fido thus sullying its pure-hobbyist
     hands with such a system?  Well, first of all, it would allow us to
     offer a much-needed service to a number of prospective users - that of
     inexpensive email.  Email, after all, is what most users of the
     internet use most.  Once the thrill of webbing and ftping has worn
     off, email remains as without doubt the most useful aspect of the net
     for the average person.

     Many people with computers, who are currently IN or Fido unconnected
     would like to have email, but are balking at paying $15.00/mo and up
     for the service.  Some small "off-shoot" providers are already
     offering up email-only accounts for $5.00/mo, and these are going
     over well.  As a local computer consultant, I have had lots of people
     tell me, "I can buy lots of stamps for $15.00 a month."  But I know
     that if I could offer them email service for a more nominal fee
     they'd jump on it.  And your local friendly Fidonet bbs could be the
     place from which to make this offer.

        All we need is the software.  Something which would allow the user
     to post and read email in a message area (such as Netmail) and would
     transparently ship it off and bring in the incoming through an
     invisible (to the user) isp.  We would of course charge the nominal
     fee for this service.  This would be a departure from the laudable no-
     charge aspect of Fidonet - one of which we are most of us justly
     proud, but would be necessary to offset the cost of the ISP.  But
     the rest of Fidonet's many benefits would still be offered for no
     charge to users of the email portion of the node or not.

        This, I believe, is the gimmick which would save Fidonet.

        If the software only existed.  Anybody care enough to write it?

     Calif Senate Public Records Task Force about to trash equal access!!!
     by Tim Pozar pozar@kumr.lns.com

     The following is a missive from Jim Warren.  Jim has lead the

     crusade to get public records out to the public for some years now.
     (What a concept...) He has and is advisor to a number of committees
     crafting legislation for low-cost or free distribution via electronic
     media, primarily computer networks.

     The message below alerts us to the fact that the Executive branch
     of the State of California wants to charge big bucks for distribution
     by any means of public records by anyone other than 503c corps or
     news folks.  This means if you run a BBS that charges for access
     and you distribute this material you could end up being charge some
     hefty amounts.  Please make your voice heard that you want to see
     State and Federal public records available for anyone for low cost
     or free.

      Subject: Calif Senate Pub Rcds Task Force about to trash equal
      access!!!

      [TIME-SENSITIVE!  Please repost and recirculate widely!  NOW!]

      California guv'ment insider hustlers are about to SCREW modern public
      records access!  On August 7th (surprise! -- exactly while the most
      number of citizens are on vacation).

      My apologies for the length of the following, but it is the verbatim
      *KEY* proposal for final adoption by the California Senate Task Force
      on Electronic Access to Public Records, to be recommended for
      inclusion in Senate Bill 74 (by the *former* open-govt advocate, Sen.
      Quentin Kopp [I-San Francisco].

      It will radically revise the equal-access and low-cost principles of
      the state's CPRA - California Public Records Act -- that have been in
      place for decades.

      The Task Force has been dominated by public-agency bureaucrats who
      zealously demand the freedom to charge MUCH MORE than the "direct
      cost of duplication," that has been the limit on public-records
      copying fees for decades!

      And this would totally demolish the equally long-standing principle
      that *access* (as opposed to presumed-paper copies) would be free, in
      the case of remote, online access to already-computerized public
      records!

      IF ENACTED, EVERY wee-profit BBS and ISP THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE PROVIDE
      PUBLIC ACCESS TO PUBLIC RECORDS ALREADY-COMPUTERIZED AT TAX-PAYER
      EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE TO PAY RADICALLY-INCREASED COSTS TO THE AGENCY
      PROVIDING THE RECORDS.

      THIS WILL HAVE A *MONUMENTALLY* CHILLING EFFECT ON MODERN/ONLINE
      PUBLIC ACCESS!
     FIDONEWS 14-31               Page 12                   4 Aug 1997


      Instead of the long-standing principle of charging *only* direct
      copying costs -- now that copying computer records would often cost
      less than the cost of accounting for the pennies it costs to make the
      copy --*now*, powerful bureaucrats who can't find enough money to
      spend want to throw the door wide open, collecting *all* the costs
      for *all* of, "actual cost of providing the record, which may include
      the costs of search, retrieval, review, segregation, and
      duplication."

      There is no prohibition against including in those "actual costs,"
      things such as prorated staff retirement benefits, janitorial
      services, building and equipment depreciation, etc. -- as has already
      been repeatedly *urged* by some bureaucrats.

      "For profit" researchers and writers -- that is, those expecting to
      be *paid* <gasp!> for their independent or free-lance efforts, would
      be forced to pay the same massively-increased costs.

      However, the politically powerful California Newspaper Publishers
      Association has had included an exemption for themselves and anyone
      working for a "a news gathering organization."  [Sec. 1.(1)b., below]

      If you care about *equal* and *duplication-cost-only* access to
      *modern* [computerized] public records in Californica <sic!>, SPEAK
      UP *RIGHT* NOW!

      *  *Especially*, call and write the Editorial-Page Editors of your
      local newspapers.  Pronto!

      *  Call and write your elected so-called state AND city and county
      "representatives" -- and ask them to clearly state their position!

      (Well-paid lobbyists for the Calif cities [League of California
      Cities] and counties [California State Association of Counties] have
      been the most ardent, insistent and zealous -- and effective --
      opponents of free pub rcds access and dup-cost-only pub rcds copies.
      It is the LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE MOST OPPOSED to equal copying-
      cost-only public access!  Increasingly!  All of this decade!)

      (Interestingly, Silicon Valley's Santa Clara County has LED the fight
      for higher fees and monopoly sales of public records for much of this
      decade!)

      *  And let the members of the Senate Electronic Records Task Force),
      below (only *some* of whom are online, know your position -- for what
      little good that may do. (Hey!, they want to make more money from
      their information monopolies!)

     Subject: 1 Last E-records Task Force Meeting

     I'd like to have 1 last meeting to review these 2 drafts (#3 & 4) for
     possible amendments to SB 74.

     Please join us in the CNPA conference room on Thursday, August 7th at
     9:30am.  (1225 8th street, Suite 260, Sacramento, for those who've
     forgotten).  We will adjourn in time for lunch.

     If there is support for either of these drafts or some revised
     version, we will move them forward as amendments.  If not, we will
     simply make available the summary document from our prior meeting
     which indicates areas of consensus and controversy surrounding this
     issue.  This will be our final meeting.  If you cannot come, please
     provide written comments.

     There is no version which includes the additional surcharge on
     commercial users as we discussed at our last meeting because the
     Legislative Counsel opinion suggests it will likely be viewed as a
     tax.  I believe we determined previously not to pursue that option if
     such were the case.

     Thanks to all who have participated in this lengthy process.  Please
     advise me at teri.burns@sen.ca.gov or  (916) 324-6928  if you will be
     attending on 8/7.

     Thanks.

     Amendments to SB 74

     1.  On page 6, line 29 after the word "so.", add:

     Agencies shall provide a copy of  an electronic record in the format
     requested, unless, in light of surrounding circumstances, it is not
     reasonable to do so, provided that the requested format is one which
     FIDONEWS 14-31               Page 14                   4 Aug 1997


     has been used by the agency to create copies for its own use or for
     provision to other agencies. Electronic copies of records shall be
     made promptly available upon payment of fees as follows:

             (1)  Except when the records are requested for a commercial
     purpose, electronic copies of records shall be made available upon
     payment of fees representing the direct cost of duplication or a
     statutory fee.  For purposes of this section, "commercial purpose"
     means any use that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit
     interests of the requester or person on whose behalf the request is
     made.   Commercial purpose does not include any of the following:

             a.  A request made by a 501 (c) (?) nonprofit corporation, so
             long as the information requested is not used for any purpose
             in which the corporation would be required to pay income tax
             under state or federal law.

             b. a request made by a person who, through contract or
             employment, is a publisher, editor or reporter with a news
             gathering organization and makes the request in that capacity
             for a news gathering purpose.

             (2)  For requests in which the information is to be used for
     any commercial purpose, the records shall be made available upon
     payment of the actual cost of providing the record, which may include
     the costs of search, retrieval, review, segregation, and duplication.
     All funds collected by an agency shall be used by the agency
     exclusively for the purposes described in section 6253.1 and for no
     other purpose.  Except as authorized by this section, no other fees
     may be charged for copies of records.

     Nothing in this section pertaining to information maintained in
     electronic form expands, modifies or limits any requirement,
     exemption, or other provision contained elsewhere in this chapter.

     2.  On page 6, line 29, before the word, "Each", add:

     "(c)"

     and reletter the rest of the section.

     3.  On page 7,  line 31, delete:

     "(a) Computerized data shall be provided in a form to be determined
     by the agency."

     In interpreting whether disclosure of a copy of a record in an
     electronic format is reasonable under surrounding circumstances, we
     are mindful of the dictionary definitions of the term "reasonable."
     These definitions consistently indicate that the term reasonable means
     moderate, inexpensive, fair, suitable under the circumstances, and not
     excessive.  Thus, if disclosure of a copy of a record in electronic
     form is consistent with these concepts, the agency would be expected
     to make disclosure in that form.

     Some examples of circumstances in which it would not be reasonable to
     require compliance with the general rule would include the following
     situations:

             * Significant reprogramming or the creation of new software
             would be necessary to fulfill the request; and

             * The task of redacting or segregating exempt from disclosable
             material would be unduly burdensome.

             * Significant reprogramming or the creation of new software
             would be necessary to fulfill the request; and

             * The task of redacting or segregating exempt from disclosable

     A response to lee Kindness's Counter proposal InetTM flags

             "Internet as a transport mechanism for fidonet
                      A proposal for Nodelist flags"

          LK> SW> by Steve Woodmore, 2:440/410 (2:2/200 ZEC/2)
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          LK>Pointless flag waving by the power-hungry Z2EC, Steve what
          LK>relevance has that to a technical specification? You are
          LK>2:440/410, nothing more, nothing less. Anyway, let's move away
          LK>from this pointless hohee and onto something more
          LK>constructive...

     No!, lets just stay here for a minute.

     It seems you fail to understand What the ?EC chain is, and what their
     Perceived (by you) power is.

     Perhaps you would care to explain to everyone, EXACTLY what Power A
     ZEC actually has?

     Everything I do, I do for the good of fidonet, I have spent thousands
     of pounds of my own money on this hobby, I have asked for nothing in
     return except for one thing, that the nodelist stops shrinking and we
     Find ways to encourage people back into fidonet.

     The Internet is with us now, we cannot avoid it.

     So with this in mind I sat down and tried to find a way to depart
     information to nodes as to how they can get connected to fidonet
     through the Internet.

     I am a "doer" not a "talker", in other words if I see something that I
     think needs doing, i will try and do it, and not just sit Around
     flapping my lips and trying to insult everyone that attempts anything.

     I wrote my proposal, and i didn't expect it to be accepted "Ad-Hoc"
     for one minute, however it did do what i expected, its galvanised
     people into thinking about it, talking about it, and coming up with
     ways to implement it.

     The rest of your response was fine, it was well thought out and
     presented and has lots of merit.

     However your petty insults at the beginning are indicative of every
     thing that is wrong in fidonet today, you just couldn't write
     something constructive could you?, you just had to have your little
     dig, didn't you?

     Next time you respond to someone who is trying to improve the network
     for all of us, step out from behind your petty little ego, and think

     of the reasons as to why people do things.

     Power???, don't make me laugh, go and read the relevant policies
     In force for our Zone again, and this time understand them.

     In the beginning, God created the bit. And the bit was a zero.

     On the first day, he toggled the 0 to 1, and the Universe was.
     (In those days, bootstrap loaders were simple, and "active low"
     signals didn't yet exist.)

     On the second day, God's boss wanted a demo, and tried to read the
     bit. This being volatile memory, the bit reverted to a 0. And the
     universe wasn't. God learned the importance of backups and memory
     refresh, and spent the rest of the day (and his first all-nighter)
     reinstalling the universe.

     On the third day, the bit cried "Oh, Lord! If you exist, give me a
     sign!" And God created rev 2.0 of the bit, even better than the
     original prototype. Those in Universe Marketing immediately realized
     that "new and improved" wouldn't do justice to such a grand and
     glorious creation. And so it was dubbed the Most Significant Bit.
     Many bits followed, but only one was so honored.

     On the fourth day, God created a simple ALU with 'add' and 'logical
     shift' instructions. And the original bit discovered that -- by
     performing a single shift instruction -- it could become the Most
     Significant Bit. And God realized the importance of computer security.

     On the fifth day, God created the first mid-life kicker, rev 2.0 of
     the ALU, with wonderful features, and said "Forget that add and shift
     stuff. Go forth and multiply." And God saw that it was good.

     On the sixth day, God got a bit overconfident, and invented pipelines,
     register hazards, optimizing compilers, crosstalk, restartable
     instructions, microinterrupts, race conditions, and propagation
     delays. Historians have used this to convincingly argue that the sixth
     day must have been a Monday.

     On the seventh day, an engineering change introduced Windows into the
     Universe, and it hasn't worked right since.
