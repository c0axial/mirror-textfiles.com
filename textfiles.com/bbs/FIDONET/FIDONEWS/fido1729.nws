                               Echomail Rogues
                                  Doug Myers

     Two villains have been fingered in the current discussion about
     ELIST procedures in the MODERATOR echo:  moderators who don't quite
     get around to updating their echoes, and echomail "rogues" who list
     the echoes in their own names once the listing expires.  Ironically,
     the first villain is perceived to get exactly what he deserves:  a
     moderator who doesn't pay attention the the elist procedures loses
     that listing.  And yet the "rogues" who come along and list the
     expired echoes are perceived as somehow mucking up the system.

     They can't both be villains here!  If the moderator who starts and
     maintains an active echo, but falters on the updating, isn't doing
     his job, then the "rogue" who steps in and does it shouldn't be
     faulted.

     The MODERATOR discussion initially promised to set up a legitimate
     dialog, but has lately fizzled into a round of mutual back patting
     on the status quo.  The status quo may indeed be desirable here...
     but echomail "rogues" are part of that status quo.

     The most prolific of the echomail "rogues" is Bobby Queen.  Yet he
     maintains that he performs a service to Fidonet, rescuing echoes
     for the participants which are in danger of extinction due to the
     lack of action of the original moderators.  On the other hand, Thom
     LaCosta, Echolist Keeper, expresses deep reservations about the
     desirability and usefulness of Bobby's operation.

     These reservations are fine - from such differences of opinion are
     fine dialog derived.  However, the reservations alone are
     insufficient - they must be recognized as an inevitable part of the
     status quo.

     In fact, if the status quo is to be staunchly defended, then the
     echomail "rogues" will inevitably have to be seen, ultimately, as
     heroes of Fido Echomail.

     In remembrance of Teri Chesser
     Andrea Santos, 1:135/382, asantos@santronics.com

     Like many other ladies in Fidonet, I first met Teri Chesser in the
     privately distributed FEMALE_SYSOP echo.  We chatted early, late and
     often about our families, hubbies, current events and, Teri's
     favorite preoccuption, cooking.  She was an avid participant in
     several of the cooking echos and I knew if I ever needed a recipe
     for anything, she was the one to ask.  Couldn't have done the Pasta
     E Fagioli and Wedding Soup without her. ;-)

     We shared a mutual interest in columnist Molly Ivins, who coined the
     name "Shrub" with reference to Presidential Candidate George W.
     Bush.  And whenever I read an Ivins' column from this day on, I'll
     be thinking about Teri and smiling, and wishing she was here this
     coming November.

     Also have Teri to thank for her support with the creation of my
     first Fidonet echo, WHAT'S_HOT!   After bending the ladies' ears a
     bit about my idea for a topical news conference, Teri provided lots
     of encouragement and became one of the first regulars when the
     conference was backboned.  So in memory, my friend, this one will be
     for you!

     Didn't stay in touch as much this year as Gene whisked you away to
     many wonderful places near and far, but I'm so very happy you both
     had this time and the experiences to share.

     My prayers and sympathies to Gene, your daughter Courtney, and the
     rest of the family.  Teri, may you rest in peace, and know you are
     fondly remembered by all you touched in Fidonet.

                              The Veterans Echo

                        What it is and what it isn't.

                               By Todd Sullivan
                               <1:3613/1275/12>


         There have been Veterans groups as long as there have been
     Veterans, some official, some informal, all trying to address the
     needs and concerns of Veterans of Military Service, all with varying
     levels of success.

         With the advent of FidoNet there have emerged Veterans
     Conferences. Most of them have been focussed on a particular
     FIDONEWS 17-29               Page 3                   17 Jul 2000


     conflict, be it WWII, Korea, Viet Nam or, most recently, Desert
     Shield/Storm.  Also included might be various missions to Somalia,
     Bosnia-Hertzogovenia, Panama and Grenada. And those are only the
     missions undertaken by the United States.

         The Veterans Echo, which is Internationally distributed, is not
     meant to be as narrow in scope.  It is meant for ALL Veterans, be
     they American, British, Russian, German, Japanese or whatever
     nationality.  With the shrinkage of FidoNet we have lost various
     conferences, almost to the point of non-existence.  Something needed
     to be done, which prompted the formation of the General Veterans
     Conference, which is EchoListed as VETERANS.

         While it might seem to be just another conference for Veterans,
     this is not meant to be a Veterans Affairs conference, which is
     beyond even the scope of the Internet, at least for the moment.
     There are too many issues for one conference to cover.  Rather, the
     Veterans Echo is meant for discussion of the aspects common to all
     Military Veterans.  This includes Veterans' spouses as well, who are
     just as affected as the Veterans.

         This conference is a place where Veterans may talk about their
     lives before and after their service, their experiences and what
     they now face afterwards.  It is to provide both  moral support and
     /morale/ support for Veterans, giving the sympathetic ears of those
     who understand what those who have not served cannot or will not
     comprehend.  If anyone wishes to point the way to official Veterans
     Organizations, they may.  However, the conference is not affiliated
     with any Government, Government organization or Official Veteran's
     organization.

         The conference is not for re-hashing "What might/could/should
     have beens."  There are plenty of those, I have no doubt.  The
     Veterans Echo is more like the Base Exchange, where one Veteran can
     "shoot the breeze" with others of his or her kind.  Consequently,
     those in active military service obligation will not find this
     conference to their taste, and it is most certainly off limits to
     civilians, who cannot understand the Veteran's life and outlook,
     both of which have been changed forever by military service. Combat
     Veterans obviously face an even greater amount of change.

         The only Conference requirement is that of military service
     followed by a discharge from same, type unimportant.  I personally
     have an Administrative Discharge--General Under Other-Than-Honorable
     Conditions--from the United States Navy.  Branch and Rank do not
     matter, but Officers may find the environment a bit hostile, unless
     they take everything said with a grain or two of salt.  The lives
     led by each are very different, which leads to misunderstandings, at
     the very least.

         The General Veterans Echo is meant to be a place where Veterans
     can be themselves without the interference of those who have never
     experienced the world and life we once lived.  It's meant to be
     friendly, and hopefully fun and informative.  In this way, it is
     meant to help former enemies discover friends they never knew they
     had.

                            When the Well Runs Dry


     You don't miss the water until the well runs dry...then it's "Oh
     dear God"!

     It was one of the hottest days of the dry season.  We had not seen
     rain in almost a month. The crops were dying. Cows had stopped
     giving milk. The creeks and streams were long gone back into the
     earth.  It was a dry season that would bankrupt several farmers
     before it was through. Every day, my husband and his brothers would
     go about the  arduous process of  trying to get water to the fields.
     Lately this process had involved taking a truck to the local water
     rendering plant and filling it up with water. But severe rationing
     had cut  everyone off.  If we didn't see some rain soon... we would
     lose everything.

     It was on this day that I learned the true lesson of sharing and
     witnessed the only miracle I have seen with my own eyes. I was in
     the kitchen making lunch for my husband and his brothers when I saw
     my six-year old son, Billy, walking toward the woods.  He wasn't
     walking with the usual carefree abandon of a youth but with a
     serious purpose.  I could only see his back. He was obviously
     walking with a great effort...trying to be as still as possible.
     Minutes after he disappeared into the woods, he came running out
     again, toward the house. I went back to making sandwiches; thinking
     that whatever task he had been doing was completed.

     Moments later, however, he was once again walking in that slow
     purposeful stride toward the woods. This activity went on for an
     hour: walk carefully to the woods, run back to the house.  Finally I
     couldn't take it any longer and I crept out of the house and
     followed him on his journey (being very careful not to be seen ...as
     he was obviously doing important work and didn't need his Mommy
     checking up on him).

     He was cupping both hands in front of him as he walked; being very
     careful not to spill the water he held in them...maybe two or three
     tablespoons were held in his tiny hands.  I sneaked close as he went
     into the woods. Branches and thorns slapped his little face but he
     did not try to avoid them. He had a much higher purpose.  As I
     leaned  in to spy on him, I saw the most amazing site.

     Several large deer loomed in front of him.  Billy walked right up to
     them. I almost screamed for him to get away. A huge buck with
     elaborate antlers was dangerously close.  But the buck did not
     threaten him...he didn't even move as Billy knelt down. And I saw a
     tiny fawn laying on the ground, obviously suffering from dehydration
     and heat exhaustion, lift its head with great effort to lap up the
     FIDONEWS 17-29               Page 6                   17 Jul 2000


     water cupped in my beautiful boy's hand.

     When the water was gone, Billy jumped up to run back to the house
     and I hid behind a tree.  I followed him back to the house; to a
     spigot that we had shut off the water to. Billy opened it all the
     way up and a small trickle began  to creep out. He knelt there,
     letting the drip drip slowly fill up his makeshift "cup", as the sun
     beat down on his little back.  And it came clear to me. The  trouble
     he had gotten into for playing with the hose the week before. The
     lecture he had received about the importance of not wasting water,
     was the reason he didn't ask me to help him.

     It took several minutes for the drops to fill his hands. When he
     stood up and began the trek back, I was there in front of him. His
     little eyes just filled with tears. "I'm not wasting", was all he
     said.  As he began his walk, I joined  him...with a small pot of
     water from the kitchen. I let him tend to the fawn. I stayed away.
     It was his job.

     I stood on the  edge of the woods watching the most beautiful heart
     I have ever known working so hard to save another life. As the tears
     that rolled down my face  began to hit the ground, they were
     suddenly joined by other drops...and  more drops...and more.  I
     looked up at the sky. It was as if God, himself, was weeping with
     pride.

     Some will probably say that this was all just a huge coincidence.
     No, not this miricle of God's blessing.  To honor the memory of my
     beautiful Billy, who was taken from me much too soon.... but not
     before showing me the true face of God.

                             Home Economics 2000
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     While the first part of the attached might be familiar to some of
     you, there is a new "2000" version right below the classic.

     The following is from an actual 1950's Home Economics textbook
     intended for High School girls, teaching them how to prepare for
     married life.

     1. HAVE DINNER READY: Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a
     delicious meal - on time. This is a way of letting him know that you
     have been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs.
     Most men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a good
     meal are part of the warm welcome needed.

     2.PREPARE YOURSELF: Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed
     when he arrives. Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair
     and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary
     people. Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His boring
     day may need a lift.

     3.CLEAR AWAY CLUTTER: Make one last trip through the main part of
     the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up school
     books, toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your
     husband will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it
     will give you a lift, too.

     4. PREPARE THE CHILDREN. Take a few minutes to wash the children's
     hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if
     necessary, change their clothes. They are little treasures and he
     would like to see them playing the part.

     5. MINIMIZE THE NOISE: At the time of his arrival, eliminate all
     noise of washer, dryer, or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to
     be quiet.  Greet him with a warm smile and kiss, letting him know
     you're glad to see him.

     6. Some Don'ts: Don't greet him with problems or complaints. Don't
     complain if he's late for dinner. Count this as minor compared with
     what he might have gone through that day.

     7. MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair
     or suggest he lay down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink
     ready for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes.
     Speak in a low, soft, soothing and pleasant voice. Allow him to
     relax and unwind.

     8. LISTEN TO HIM: You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the
     moment of his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first.

     FIDONEWS 17-29               Page 8                   17 Jul 2000


     9. MAKE THE EVENING HIS: Never complain if he does not take you out
     to dinner or to other places of entertainment; instead try to
     understand his world of strain and pressure and his need to be home
     and relax.

     10. THE GOAL: try to make your home a place of peace and order where
     your husband can relax.


     The 2000 Version

     1. HAVE DINNER READY: Make reservations ahead of time. If your day
     becomes too hectic just leave him a voice mail message regarding
     where you'd like to eat and at what time. This lets him know that
     your day has been crappy and gives him an opportunity to change your
     mood.

     2. PREPARE YOURSELF: Make sure to change out of your work clothes
     into something comfortable. Who cares if he likes it or not . . .
     after all, it's most likely he is in t-shirt and boxers.

     3. CLEAR AWAY CLUTTER: Yeah right! Tell the kids and your husband if
     they want maid service, they better call one!

     4. PREPARE THE CHILDREN: Send the children to their rooms to watch
     television or play Nintendo.

     5. MINIMIZE THE NOISE: Yell to him over the loud music your kids are
     playing, that this is what you had to put up with while he was gone.
     And mention that it was his decision to buy the kids a new CD player
     in the first place.

     6. SOME Don'ts: Don't greet him with problems and complaints. Let
     him speak first, and then your complaints will get more attention
     and remain fresh in his mind throughout dinner. Don't complain if
     he's late for dinner, simply remind him that the leftovers are in
     the fridge and you left the dishes for him to do.

     7. MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE: Tell him where he can find a blanket if
     he's cold.  This will really show you care.

     8. LISTEN TO HIM: But don't ever let him get the last word.

     9. MAKE THE EVENING HIS: Never complain if he does not take you out
     to dinner or other places of entertainment; go with a friend or go
     shopping (use his credit card). Familiarize him with the phrase
     "Girls' Night Out!"

     10.THE GOAL: Try to keep things amicable without reminding him that
     he only thinks the world revolves around him. Obviously he's wrong,
     it revolves around you.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
