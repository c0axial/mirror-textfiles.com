        Fidonews is published weekly by SEAboard,  Fido  107/7.  You 
        are   encouraged  to  submit  articles  for  publication  in 
        Fidonews.  Article submission standards are contained in the 
        file FIDONEWS.DOC, available from Fido 107/7.  

        Disclaimer or don't-blame-us: 

        The contents of the articles  contained  here  are  not  our 
        responsibility,  nor  do  we  necessarily  agree  with them; 
        everything here is subject to debate.  We publish EVERYTHING 
        received.  





                              Your Fellow Users

        Fidonet is great.  It's wonderful!  We have here our very 
        own private electronic mail system.  So who's using this 
        thing, anyway?

        Well, now you can find out.  The national user list, which 
        has been mentioned before in this newsletter, is now out.  
        About fourty nodes are reporting so far, and the result is 
        looking pretty good.  

        Matt Kanter has been doing a heck of a job, and the first 
        fruits of his labors are now available.  You can download 
        the list from his board, node 107/1, or from 107/7 or 
        100/51.  With any luck, it'll soon be available many other 
        places as well.

        There are two minor problems, though.  One is that not 
        enough nodes are reporting yet.  We encourage all of you 
        sysops out there to please run SHIPUSER once a month and 
        send the output to node 107/7.  It would be really great if 
        we could get most (if not all) Fido boards to contribute.

        The other little matter is that the output file is a bit on 
        the large size, and will probably get larger as more nodes 
        start sending in their data.  Users with fixed disks should 
        be able to handle it, but people with floppy based systems 
        may be out of luck.  One possible solution is to publish the 
        thing.  (You know, physically, on paper.)  Matt was thinking 
        of running off a copy and taking it to one of the many print 
        shops in Manhatten.  Back when we were starting this whole 
        deal Ken Kaplan suggested getting it published monthly like 
        a magazine.  A small problem is that it costs money to do 
        that.  Would you be willing to pay for it?

        Yes, I know.  Why should a sysop send in his data for 
        nothing if someone else is going to make money on it?  A few 
        reasons.  For one, we're not really talking about making 
        anything on it; we're only talking about covering expenses.  
        For another, a verified list of nationwide users like that 
        could help when it comes to lobbying in Washington (yes, 
        politics again).  And last but not least, a national user 
        directory is a darned nice idea all in itself.  I'd like it 
        better if we can keep it on disk, but if we can't it would 
        still be useful.  We have a mail system, we should have a 
        phone book.

        ============================================================
        The Southern California Network (102) has renumbered all the
        nodes in its network. The numbering scheme is simple. We
        have 9 HOSTS so each one is assigned a hundred number group.
        The host is the hundred number and the first number in his
        group (100 & 101 for example). Each local under a host then
        is assigned a number of the hundred group. Following is a
        translate list of old numbers to new numbers indicating
        hosts and other changes.

                    NETWORK COMPARISON OF SOCALNET

        The following is a comparison of the old Network 102 node
        numbering system to the new.  The major changes occur in the
        addition of two new HOSTS for the SIMI VALLEY and SAN
        GABRIEL.

        The following was captured,  from a BBS in Golden, Colorado, 
        on  12/13/84.   Let's not let some thing like this happen in 
        this area!  

        The Telephone company that is refered to, is Mountain Bell.  

        If  you wish to see more about this on-going  battle,  call 
        them at (303) 278-4244.   300/1200 BPS, 8/1/N 



                         THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN..

        BY THE WAY,  IF YOU HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR  INTO  THE  SYSTEM 
        WITHOUT  SEVERE DROP-OUTS OR FOUND THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU 
        CAN'T EVEN MAKE IT IN,  WELL...  THE GUYS WHO BRING YOU THIS 
        WONDERFUL  LINE  QUALITY  STRIKES  AGAIN...!!   GUESS  WHAT?  
        SINCE THEY GOT A  RIFT  FROM  P.U.C.  ABOUT  SNEEKING  IN  A 
        COMPUTER  ACCESS TARRIF WHICH WOULD HAVE GRAND-FATHERED IN A 
        COUPLE OF YEARS,  THE  MOST  RECENT  MANEUVER  SEEMS  TO  BE 
        DEGRADATION  OF  VOICE  GRADE  LINES SO THAT IT WON'T FLATLY 
        PASS 300-3000HZ ANY MORE.  (STRANGE THIS PHENOMENON IS,  YOU 
        SEE,  3 YEARS AGO,  THESE LINES WERE SOOOO PERFECT,  EVEN MY 
        REGULAR VOICE LINE WOULD  PASS  DATA  WITHOUT  A  DROPOUT!!) 
        WELL, WHAT COULD HAVVVVVVVE HAPPENED?  

               NICE  GUYS  THEY  ARE!  WE PAY FOR VOICE GRADE LINES, 
        AND WE CAN'T EVEN BE ASSURRED THAT  THEY  ARE  FLAT.  MODEMS 
        LIKE  TO  HAVE 2225HZ AND WHEN THEY TEST YOUR LINE THEY TEST 
        IT AT 1000HZ.  NOT EVEN LOOKING AT THE HIGH END OF THE VOICE 
        BAND...  

            THERE IS EVEN SPECS ABOUT DELAY, DISTORTION, HUM, NOISE, 
        CURRENT SUPPLY, AND OTHER SPECS.....  

            JUST  WAIT  FOLKS!   MAYBE  YOU  WILL  HAVE  YOUR  LINES 
        DEGRADED  TOO!!  (AND PAY FOR VOICE GRADE AND NOT BE GETTING 
        IT!!) COULD THIS HAPPEN IN AMERICA?  OR SHOULD WE  SAY  W  H 
        Y??  

            THERE  ARE  STANDARD  MODEM TEST LINES AROUND WHERE THEY 
        WILL TELL YOU IF YOU ARE BEING SHORT CHANGED OFF ON THE HIGH 
        FREQUENCIES!  

            IF THIS LINE IS NOT TOTALLY SHUNTED  OUT  ONE  OF  THESE 
        DAYS YOU'LL GET THE NUMBER,  AND WE WILL PETITION AS A GROUP 
        FOR A CLASS ACTION SUIT LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE IN THE BEGINNING 
        WHEN THEY STARTED THE  NONSENSE  WITH  THE  COMPUTER  ACCESS 
        TARRIF!  THIS  TIME  THE  SUIT WILL NOT BE STOPPED,  AND THE 
        OTHER BBS'S AND THEIR SYSOPS WILL  JOIN  IN  ON  THE  PUBLIC 
        CAUSE.  THERE  ARE  MILLIONS  OF  COMPUTER  USERS ACROSS THE 
        COUNTRY WHO WANT DECENT SERVICE  FROM  THE  UTILITIES  WHICH 
        MUST  DEMONSTRATE  TO  THE  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE 'COMMON 
        CARRIERS' AND THAT THEY ARE 'ACTING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST'.  
        DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY 'THEY' STAND TO LOOSE FOR AN  FCC 
        ACTION CITED UPON THEIR HEADS FOR DELIBERATE INTERFERENCE IN 
        PRIVATE MATTERS?

            THERE  ARE  OTHER  COMPANIES ACROSS THE U.S.A.  WHO HAVE 
        NOT HAD THEIR HANDS SLAPPED FOR THE ACCESS TARRIF;  A  CLASS 
        ACTION SUIT BRINGING USERS FROM NATION-WIDE WHO HAVE SIMILAR 
        PROBLEMS  WOULD  BE A PUBLIC BENEFIT,  AND CALL ATTENTION TO 
        THOSE WHO ALLEDGEDLY ACT IN OUR INTEREST.  

           LETS KEEP OUR HOBBY RUNNING!  AND NOT BE STEPPED ON THOSE 
        WHO CAN'T IN MY  OPINION  SEEM  TO  RECOGNIZE  THEIR  COMMON 
        CARRIER STATUS..  

           WE  CHALLENGE THOSE COMMON CARRIERS TO SHOW THAT THEY CAN 
        MAINTAIN SERVICE SINCE THE BREAKUP!  

           THIS IS  OPENING  UP  A  GOOD  MEASURE  OF  COMPETITION'S 
        JUSTIFICATION,  SINCE THE 'OTHER GUY' NOW HAS PLENTY TO BEEF 
        ABOUT.  LETS HEAR IT FOR ENTERPRISE.  THAT IS WHAT  MADE  IT 
        POSSIBLE TO HAVE COMMUNICATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.  

            WRITE  YOUR  CONGRESSMAN,   BEWARE  OF  ACTIONS  AGAINST 
        FREEDOM OF SPEECH, AND LETS HERE IT FOR THE FCC CHIEF OF THE 
        COMMON CARRIER BUREAU WHO IS ALSO PART OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
        DIVISION AND BY THE WAY A COMPUTER USER TOO!  THE FCC GRANTS 
        THE CHARTER TO THOSE WHO CAN  PROVE  THEY  CAN  FUNCTION  AS 
        'COMMON  CARRIER'.  DID  YOU  KNOW  THAT THERE IS AN OBSCURE 
        LITTLE PART OF THE FCC RULES AND  REGULATIONS  WHICH  STATES 
        THAT  TO  COMPLY  WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF HONORING 
        THE CHARTER AUTHORIZING A COMMON CARRIER ITS  OPERATIONS,  A 
        LITTLE PART THAT SAYS THEY MUST FILE A NOTICE TO THE FCC FOR 
        PUBLIC RECORD THAT 'SERVICE IS BEING DEGRADED',  'REDUCED OR 
        IMPARRED',  AN ORIGINAL AND NINE (9) COPIES!!!  I WONDER  IF 
        THAT WAS FILED????  

             NOW  OF  COURSE WE COULD UNDERSTAND A TEMPORARY LACK OF 
        EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE SERVICE DUE TO NATURAL  CAUSES,  LIKE 
        EARTHQUAKES  AND  CONTRACTORS  DIGGING  UP CABLES,  BUT WHAT 
        ABOUT SERVICE THAT ONCE WORKED,  AND REPAIR SAYS THEY  CAN'T 
        FIND OUT WHY IT WON'T WORK ANYMORE???  SOUNDS REALLY ODD...

                             FIRE DEPARTMENTS
                          RELENTLESSLY CONTINUES
                       By Christopher Baker, Sysop,
                          Metro-Fire Fido, 18/14
                      ==============================

                Somewhere, among the countless 25,000+ readers of
        FidoNews, there must be a few computer enthusiasts that are
        also involved with their local Fire departments in some 
        way (other than litigation, that is). Even if it's only to
        buy a ticket to the Fireman's picnic. Perhaps, you have a
        relative in the business? Maybe, you're a vendor of goods
        and/or services to your local smoke-eaters? Or, perish the
        thought, YOU might be one of the men/women in gray/blue/
        black/etc.!?

        However you may be connected, I need your help. It is my
        intention (and fondest hope) to bring together as many
        departments as I can find into a national Fire network. The
        purpose of which will be to share ideas, programs, tips,
        warnings, techniques, etc., and to provide a common forum
        for the dissemination of information to as broad a base as
        possible.

        To begin this Herculean task, I need some input. If you
        belong to or know of or work for a Fire/Rescue department,
        paid or volunteer, that has telecommunication/data equip-
        ment, please give them a copy of this article and urge them
        to contact me through FidoNet or U.S. Mail.

        The results of this preliminary survey will determine the
        direction of my grand design, so don't let this task lan-
        guish, if you can help it. I know most of you are very busy
        with your own operations, but this could be the start of
        something big (where's Steve Allen, when you need him?)!

        Thank you, in advance. I'll be waiting to hear from all
        of you.

           How FidoNet Can Help Fight Against Federal Legislation
                          Restricting BBS Operation

           After reading the article in the July 29th issue of 
        FidoNews by Chip Berlet on the new federal computer laws 
        being proposed I decided to follow up and see how we could 
        pool our resources in order to support the efforts of those 
        individuals or groups that represent the majority of our 
        bona fide BBS users and sysops.  The only formal group that 
        I found was the National Association of Bulletin Board 
        Operators started by Chicago attorney Paul Bernstein who 
        also runs a BBS for lawyers called LAWMUG. This is a 
        relatively new group that currently includes Paul and a 
        number of other Chicago residents. They are against federal 
        efforts restricting bulletin boards and are currently 
        soliciting support via messages on several bulletin boards, 
        as well as the Source.  If you would like more information 
        or would like to send contributions their address is: 

                 National Association of Bulletin Board Operators
                 c/o Paul Bernstein
                 600 N. McClurg Ct.
                 Chicago, Ill. 60611

        I also contacted the office of Senator Paul Tribble and was 
        sent a copy of Senate Bill 1305. For those of you that may 
        not be familiar this is a Bill to "establish criminal 
        penalties for the transmission by computer of obscene 
        matter, or by computer or by other means, of matter 
        pertaining to the sexual exploitation of children, and for 
        other purposes". Exchanging information pertaining to sexual 
        crimes is not prohibited under current law. The problem with 
        this Bill is that it doesn't stop there. Quoting from the 
        Bill "any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy writing, 
        description, picture, or other matter entered, stored, or 
        transmitted by or in a computer" will constitute a crime. 
        I'm no lawyer, but I'm certainly not in favor of 
        governmental efforts that force me to ensure that nothing 
        illegal occurs on my system. With Fido we have all the 
        checks and balences to keep our boards clean without 
        intervention.  The ACLU opposes the Bill because it 
        infringes on First Admendment rights.  I would like to hear 
        the opinion of others on this matter as I may be asked to 
        testify on some of the positive aspects of bulletin boards.  
        (Fido in particular). The hearings are scheduled for late 
        September or early October. If you would like to comment or 
        know more about this matter you can contact:

        Sir:

        This is one of those once upon a time letters......

        Once upon a time, this writer decided to upgrade his IBM-PC 
        with a hard disk option. As prices were dropping almost 
        every week, it became a game to spot the ad that provided 
        the most for your money. Everyone who at one time or another 
        has gone through this drill and is installing a hard disk 
        will tell you that the first concern is to install a 135 
        watt (PC-XT) power supply. This is what I did. The ad's at 
        that time that provided the best deal were PC's LIMITED in 
        Austin Texas. I called and ordered a power supply. In a very 
        short time, the power supply arrived, was installed, and 
        found to be working. Within days, it was noted that the fan 
        on the supply varied in pitch up and down almost to the 
        point of stopping. A letter was sent that asked about this 
        situation and also asked about more information on their 
        hard disk. The letter was hardly in the mail when the fan 
        failed.  The power supply was removed and returned to PC'S 
        LIMITED with a very detailed letter included that described 
        the problem. Three weeks passed with no word. A call to this 
        organizations repair facility was answered with "What is 
        your return authorization number?" My what!?!  

        At this point you should open the 23 July issue of PC 
        Magazine to page 93.  Be careful now as this is a trick 
        question. What is the smallest thing noted in this ad? Give 
        up? It is the 1 1/32x21/32" block with 66 words that spell 
        out the terms and conditions of PC"S LIMITED sales. Read it!  

        I stated my problem and the fact that I had "failed" to 
        request an authorization number. I was willing to bite the 
        bullet and pay the restocking fee. "I'm sorry sir, I can't 
        find your power supply without a number." To date..... Three 
        months have passed. Three (unanswered) letters, Eight, I 
        repeat Eight phone calls with no return calls, and I don't 
        have a power supply or my money.  

        Not to be outdone, I then ordered a power supply from G&L 
        INC, Anaheim,Ca.  This one came in and lo and behold it had 
        the wrong Motherboard connector!  It was a one piece 
        connector meant for a pc clone, not a PC. Five, I repeat 
        Five phone calls later and I have received every excuse 
        under the sun and I still don't have the right connectors.  

        OK fellows, thats it. I work for a large corporation in the 
        United States with a very large, company sponsored Computer 
        Club and a very large Fidonet Bulletin Board. This letter is 
        being submitted to the following: 

                 1.To my club newsletter
                 2.To PC Magazine

            Story originally by Neato Dude.

            This story was graded an A in English class for the  9th
        grade. I hope you like it!

            Steve  Narhar moved for the first time in hours from the
        chair in his bedroom. He had been connected  to  the  bank's
        computer  for  ages  it  seemed,  and now he had cracked the
        access codes, and could do as  he  pleased  with  the  bank.
        "Let's see how much money you got, Mr. First Federal Savings
        and  Loan  of  Los  Angeles."  he  muttered  to himself. His
        fingers raced across his home  computer's  keyboard,  as  he
        entered  the  command  "GO:TOTAL ACCOUNTS:ALL". His computer
        screen told him there was a total of $475,562,271.23 in  the
        accounts. He then selected "TRANSFER:ALL,NARHAR" and watched
        happily as all the money went from the total number into his
        account.  "Another  day,  another  $475,562,271.23" he said,
        turning his computer off and going to bed.

            At the same time, in the  Los  Angeles  bank,  Mr.  Bill
        Kuhar,  bank manager, was using the bank's computer to check
        how things had gone during the business day.  It  was  pitch
        black  outside,  and he wanted to hurry up and finish, so he
        could go home. "Oh look at that, will you just look at that!
        Miss Penny gave Mr. Jupmar $0.13  cents  over  his  balance!
        I'll have to remember to fire her tomorrow. Hired help these
        days,  makes  you wonder. Why, when I was young, I worked 12
        hours a day for 35 cents, never made a mistake,  and..."  he
        grumbled  to  no  one  in  particular,  since the office was
        empty. "WHAT THE..." he gasped, as he saw all his  wondeful,
        glorious  $475,562,271.23 disappear from everyone's accounts
        and into a single account, #82564 STEVE NARHAR. "AAAAARGH!!"
        he cried in anguish, "It's one of those "hackers"  like  you
        read  about  in the newspapers! I'm ruined! Well! We'll just
        have  to  get  this   Narhar!   "   Mr.   Kuhar   keyed   in
        "TRACE:CURRENT",  and settled back to wait for the caller to
        be traced. Two minutes later, the information  came  on  the
        screen.

            NUMBER:(402)856-2741      CITY,STATE:Omaha,     Nebraska
            CONNECTED:5 hours, 36 minutes

            "Omaha,  huh...we'll  just  pay  him  a  visit  tomorrow
        morning. " he said with a fiendish laugh.

            The  next morning, Steve bolted upright from his bed, at
        the sound of a police siren. He threw on a pair of jeans and
        a T-shirt, and ran outside to see  what  the  commotion  was
        about.  A  big,  white  van  pulled up alongside the curb. A
        large, heavyset man leaned out, and asked  him  if  he  knew
        anyone  by the name of Steve Narhar. "You're lookin' at him.







FIDONEWS     --           19 Aug 85  00:02:24           Page 14

        What is it?"

            The man was obviously surprised,  but  quickly  regained
        his  composure. Climbing out of the van, he pointed a pistol
        at Steve's back and whispered, "I would advise you  to  come
        with me now."

            Steve  decided  he  would not like little round holes in
        his body, so he let the man lead him into the  back  of  the
        van.  The  man  walked  around  the  side, and then into the
        driver's seat, and started the  engine.  Tires  squealed  as
        they  roared  away,  and by the direction they were heading,
        Steve could see they were heading for the airport.

            The man  spoke  "I  am  sorry  that  we  have  not  been
        introduced.  My  name  is Mr. Kuhar, the manager of the bank
        you broke into last night." He reached to his face, and took
        off his mustache, and then continued  with  a  thick  accent
        Steve  had  never  heard before. "You are probably wondering
        why you are here. You see, the bank you  so  rudely  invaded
        was  not  a  regular  bank. Oh no, it is more, much more. In
        fact, it's the entire funding for the Soviet  Secret  Police
        operations  for  the western portion of your America. So now
        that you know this, you must not be allowed to tell  others.
        So  of  course, you shall be a prisoner of the Soviet Union,
        and will be held in a Siberian work camp. But  don't  worry.
        You  can spend the rest of your miserable life there, having
        fun mining coal, and meeting other  prisoners.  Better  than
        summmer camp, no?"

            By  this  time, the van had pulled up along side a large
        wide-bodied  jet.  Mr.  Kuhar  dragged  Steve,  kicking  and
        screaming,  into  the  cargo hold of the Air Moscow jet, and
        slid the door shut. It was dark in the cargo hold, cold, and
        above all, extremely  noisy.  The  sound  of  the  screaming
        engines  pounded  his  ears,  and the sinking feeling in his
        stomach told him that the plane was lifting  off.  All  hope
        was  lost,  no  one  would  save him now. After a quick look
        around, he decided he could not  escape  here,  and  he  did
        particulary  want  to  take  a  bath  in  the Pacific Ocean.
        Settling back, he went to sleep for the long plane trip.

            Steve was startled awake by the screech of  the  landing
        gear  and  the  bump  as the plane touched down. Immediately
        after the plane slowed to a halt, two armed guards slid open
        the door, grabbed him by the arms, and led him into the back
        of a waiting limousine. The limousine wisked him  away,  and
        shortly entered a huge, modern looking building of glass and
        steel,  still  on  the  grounds  of the airport. Through the
        heavily tinted glass of the  limousine,  he  could  not  see
        anything,  not  even  the driver. The door was opened as the
        car drew to a halt, and two more guards pulled  him  out  by
        the  arms, and stood him in front of a large oak desk. Steve
        looked around the complex in awe. The entire room, the  size
        of  a football stadium, was completely flled with computers.
        The chair in front of the desk spun around, and in it sat an
        overweight, bald man wearing a black suit. He appeared to be







FIDONEWS     --           19 Aug 85  00:02:27           Page 15

        about sixty years old, and his face looked weatherbeaten.

            The man eyed Steve for a full minute,  taking  in  every
        detail of his fifteen year old self. "So you're the computer
        expert,  eh?"  he  said,  "Kind of young to be breaking into
        Soviet  security  systems.  Well,  enough  of  that.  I   am
        Shaplintine  Mustovacos, and you are Steve Narhar. We have a
        little job we want you to do for us,  if  you  would  be  so
        kind.  And I'm sure you'll be happy to. Since you're such an
        expert, we want you  to  simply  break  into  the  main  CIA
        computer  in  Washington  whenever  we  request.  Before you
        decide if you will do this for us, let me tell you a  little
        joke,  ok?  If  you  don't do this, you get sent to Siberia!
        Hahahahehehoho!! So, tell us, will you, or won't you?"

            "No!" screamed Steve, as he broke one of the guard's jaw
        with his fist. The guard went sprawling  across  the  floor,
        his   automatic  rifle  flying  right  into  Steve's  hands.

            RATARATARATATPOWPOWPOW erupted the gun, bullets spraying
        into the guards and Mustovacos as all three were sent to the
        ground. Steve ran out of the building as fast as  he  could,
        and  onto  the  runway. More guards, hearing the noise, went
        charging to the complex, and opened fire on Steve. He dodged
        the hail of bullets,  and  raced  up  to  a  MiG-25  fighter
        jet,slammed open the cockpit, and leaped in. Luckily, he had
        learned  how to fly a MiG-25 in the Boy Scouts, back home in
        Omaha. Steve sent the jet barreling down the runway at  full
        speed, and took off. Setting the course for Washington D.C.,
        he  armed a heat-seeking missile, in case someone went after
        him. Sure enough, someone did. Over West Germany,  a  Soviet
        MiG-21  intercepter  came  rushing toward him at full speed.
        After locking on  the  missile  to  the  attacking  jet,  he
        released  the  missile.  BOOOOOM!! The missile impacted with
        the jet, and destroyed it with a great  fireball  of  orange
        and  red  flames,  pieces raining on the ground. The problem
        gone, Steve turned his attention to getting  to  Washington.
        He  would  have  to  watch his fuel. Several hours later, he
        touched down safely at Washington National Airport.

            The President gave Steve a formal invitation to  dinner,
        the  Air  Force  was thrilled to have MiG-25 jet to inspect,
        and the CIA shut down the First Federal Savings and Loan  of

                           FIDO <==> UNIX Mail

                                   by
                              Bob Hartman
                           Sysop Fido 101/101
                            The UN*X Gateway
                                  and
                             Home of ROVER


                As some of you have already found out, my board
        (newly named the UN*X Gateway) is capable of taking in mail
        from UNIX systems, and converting it to FidoNet messages.
        If any of you want to receive UNIX mail from anyone, just
        tell that person to send mail to the following system:

                decvax!encore!vaxine!spark!net#!node#!username
        or       ihnp4!encore!vaxine!spark!net#!node#!username

        where net# is your FidoNet net number, node# is your FidoNet
        node#, and username is your user name with all blanks
        converted to underscores.  No special characters are allowed
        in names except for underscore.  This means that single and
        double quotes or anything else is illegal.  REPEAT - NO
        SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN NAMES.  If this rule is not adhered
        to, then somewhere along the line a UNIX system will barf on
        the name, and we may lose our access to the UNIX world.  An
        example of a UNIX address to get to me would be:

                decvax!encore!vaxine!spark!101!101!Bob_Hartman

        to Tom Jennings:

                decvax!encore!vaxine!spark!125!0!Tom_Jennings

        The message will go through a number of UNIX systems,
        finally arriving at my Fido BBS, where it will be converted
        to FidoNet format, and sent to the appropriate destination.
        Anyone wanting to try this out is welcome to.

        The reverse link (Fido->UNIX) is not quite working yet.
        There will be another posting when that is finished.

        From:Robert Hupf

        Because of hardware problems, we have been unable to 
        get the newsletter for some time and I just recently 
        got caught up on them. There was an article in the May 
        6 issue about a disk swapping deal of sending a box of 
        diskettes around, but the board that entered the 
        article (464) is down. I am interested in this and if 
        it's being done or if anyone is still thinking about 
        it. Please either call my board (305-830-8494) or send 
        me a Fidonet message. Thanks!
