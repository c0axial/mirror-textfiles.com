     =================================================================


     Some people believe that disagreement is personal. I've never
     understood that but I do acknowledge the trait exists in some folks.

     There isn't anything personal in my observations from FidoNews 1405
     regarding the substance of Gary Gilmore's 'lard ass' article in that
     Issue. His opinion was aired without fail and without editing. If it
     were personal, here, would it have been published? His article and my
     response are part of the public record. If he finds that unfair,
     that's his problem. Isn't it? The readers can decide between the views
     and send in their own articles.

     While he was railing against the size of FidoNews, I never mentioned
     his own contribution to the size of the Nodelist with 5 separate
     entries for the same telephone number. Now, that might have been
     considered personal, too, but it would just have been a fact like the
     other points I made. [grin]

     Facts are not personal. FidoNews IS for communicating and he is doing
     it again in this Issue. More power to him! He is completely incorrect
     about it being personal at this end. Could he be projecting? Nah. We
     disagree. No big deal. No insults - thinly or thickly veiled. I do get
     the last word in a sense but that, too, is transitory until the next
     Issue comes out. Them's the breaks in the real world.

     I'd like to remind everyone that there is an official FidoNews Echo
     for discussion of FidoNews ops and articles. It is available on the
     Zone 1 Backbone as FIDONEWS and also gets around to other Zones last I
     heard. There you can get some nearly real-time responses rather than
     this 1-2 week lag in the published FidoNews. It has no size
     constraints, either.

     Meanwhile, the motto in the banner sez it all. [chuckle]

     In other news, there is a Guest Editorial in this Issue. It was
     received via the U.S. Mail from a former FidoNet Sysop who still
     follows the doings of FidoNet but has an ongoing problem with local
     Coordinators and does not have a Node number at present. It speaks for
     itself. Any responses will be received by the author when he reads the
     FidoNews containing them. It's a LONG one by Editorial standards. I
     hope that doesn't cause any apoplexy out there. We publish what we
     get the way we get it.

     The WebRing [www.webring.org] is finally back on the new server and
     everyone who has been sending me mail asking about not being able to
     get an answer may now proceed to sign up their FidoNet-related web
     pages again. There are currently 5 sites connected to the ring and
     it's ready for the rest of you. [See 1402 for details.]

     Almost A New Beginning!
     by: V.H.(Clay) Tannacore

     On June the 5th, 1989, "A New Beginning" should have begun.  It
     didn't!  Why?  What went wrong?  Why didn't this "New Beginning"
     resolve the dilemma it was designed to?  Last, but not least, Why
     hasn't there been a New, New Beginning?  Some of these answers may
     never be resolved.  Some are discussed by members of the origination
     in question.  Some . . . Well, no one wants to address them, leastwise
     not in any open forum.  Especially, not where the dreaded "C-Monsters"
     could overhear them.

     What am I babbling about?  Come on folks, you know!  FidoNet and The
     Policy 4 Document.  Who are the "C-Monsters?"  None other then those
     big, bad Regional Coordinators,  Network Coordinators,  Zone
     Coordinators, and assuredly that (now missing) International
     Coordinator.  Those who inhabit the upper echelons of FidoNet.  The
     same "C" structure that for reasons only familiar to themselves, keep
     this prehistoric epitaph alive, and in force.  This opprobrious
     document that system operators (SysOps) around the world are told to
     operate by.  This uncomplicated/complicated instrument with its
     "guidance" pertaining to the operation of FidoNet, and all FidoNets
     subordinate followers.  This same instrument which leaves relatively
     everything up for grabs, with one exception.  The one exclusion being
     how the "C" structure (aka-C-Monsters) is;  1)  appointed  2)  elected
     3)  to perform their duties  4)  to delegate authority  5)  to
     (attempt) operate his/her Net, Region, Zone etc. etc.  The "guidance"
     given in the Policy 4 document to individual Network Coordinators,
     Regional Coordinators, and Zone Coordinators, with very few exceptions
     is so utterly vague and inadequate it may as well be nonexistent.  But
     I'm getting a little ahead of myself, here.  Allow me to continue with
     (my opinion of) what is wrong with the present day FidoNet policies
     and operations.

     Continuing right along, and in the same otiose manner.  Let us examine
     the duties of the Regional Coordinator as per the Policy 4 document.
     In Section 1.2.4 (Region and Regional Coordinators) of this
     superannuated document, there is a total of 102 words.  The first 41
     words explain *what* a Regional Coordinator is.  The next 53 words
     (and I'm being generous here) detail (grimace) the duties of the
     Regional Coordinator(s).  Following this VERY lengthy in depth job
     description are another 8 words.  These words inform all that the RC
     is "appointed" by the Zone Coordinator.  Now, according to Policy 4,
     Section 1.2.4, The Regional Coordinator has one (and only one) duty to
     perform, and that is, and I quote; "maintains the list of independent
     nodes in the region and accepts nodelists from the Network
     Coordinators in the region.  These are compiled to create a regional
     nodelist, which is then sent to the Zone Coordinator."  Unquote!
     WOW!!  Doesn't that sound like a grueling job description to you?  Of
     course we all know that what is described in the Policy 4 document is
     but a fraction of what an RC is expected to do, and on a daily basis,
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 3                   10 Feb 1997


     at that.  Why then does not this (Policy 4) document explain just what
     is expected of the RC, and how this is to be accomplished?  Sure, give
     as much leeway to the person as possible, but by all means "guide"
     him/her in accepted procedures so to avoid a multitude of different
     methods of operations from network to network.  In one word
     "STANDARDIZE" FidoNet, so as to insure a harmonious environment.

     As I have pointed out above.  There are *no* real formal instructions
     to assist anyone in comprehending just what is expected of them,
     except to inform them that a *nodelist* must be compiled.  HELLO!!  I
     bet you didn't know it, but by far the greatest magnitude of the
     SysOps within the FidoNet organization already knew that...  Perhaps
     back in 1988 and 1989 (when this hideous document was formulated) the
     composers of Policy 4 felt that the education level of brother members
     were substandard, or something.  I don't know, personally.  All I can
     remember of that time period is the contemptible power struggle that
     was prevalent within FidoNet.  Not to say that the *power hungry* are
     not still a part of this great organization (FidoNet) but to some
     degree have been restrained in achievement of their goals.  Which I
     consider a *PLUS* for this confederation of ours.

     Now that you have endured all my maunder, and haven't as yet called
     for my lynching.  I assume one of two things;  1) you may think I have
     something here, or  2)  you are in the process of trying to contact
     "Doctor Jack" to see if he makes house calls in South Carolina.  Rest
     easy, what Dr. Jack can't do.  The Veterans Administration (VA)
     Medical Center (aka-Hospital) will.  However, before that time
     arrives, or before some technical computer type figures out how to
     send a nuclear fission apparatus via NetMail.  Let me pass on a few
     (of my) suggestions I have that may possibly be plausible ideas for
     the betterment of FidoNet, and everyone involved.

     First, and foremost, we (meaning you SysOps, and members of FidoNet)
     need desperately to assemble a team of members, who can recast
     (rewrite) the Policy 4 Document, in order to bring it up to present
     day standards, taking into consideration the technology at our
     disposal.

     Second, and almost as significant, clear cut directions and procedures
     *must* be established within the New Policy 4 (or whatever it is
     called) document.  Guide lines must be set for Regional
     Coordinators(Network Coordinators are addressed in a forthcoming
     summary) in order for the orderly operation (day to day) of FidoNet in
     every area of the globe where FidoNet is active.

     Third, (and here a lot of discretion must be employed) Regional
     Coordinators must be made aware that the *users* (without who FidoNet
     is doomed) must have a way of asserting his/her opinions, as well as
     having a way of voicing their grievances directly to the RC, without
     fear of retribution from a local Network Coordinator.

     Fourth, (again discretion and even sophistication must be stressed)
     the Regional Coordinators must *oversee* (without over-overseeing)and
     supervise their Network Coordinators (bearing in mind the voluntary
     nature of the FidoNet NC) so that a well organized, and smooth flowing
     Net is the end result.
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 4                   10 Feb 1997


     Fifth suggestion (and a pet peeve of mine) is for the Regional
     Coordinator(s) to adopt an intelligent formatting scheme for EchoMail
     messages.  Presently no such system is in effect, and the EchoMail
     message bases are in total tumult, with very few exceptions.  Text
     lines are *quoted* by the dozens, even *quoted text* is *quoted* by
     the (mis)user leaving a message that started out at 2Kb of text, with
     the robust size of a Shareware Program (just a tiny bit of
     misrepresentation, here) ready for use on a PC.  Even the blank lines
     of text are being *quoted* adding to the size of the message.  Why
     individual SysOps haven't taken steps to stop this misuse, I'll never
     know.  This practice does nothing but cost money, time, and space, not
     to mention the offensive looking messages echoed over 300 or 400
     different systems throughout the FidoNet areas.

     Sixth (getting tired yet?) suggestion is a simple one.  As every SysOp
     in FidoNet knows, The Internet has lured many, many users from their
     local bulletin boards.  The Internet with all its modernistic lingo,
     with enticing graphics, E-Mail, and Faxing capability etc. etc.  Its
     world wide (WEB) accessibility, its . . . Hey! . .wait on darn minute.
     Isn't this just what FidoNet was supposed to be?  Isn't this *just*
     what FidoNet *is*???  Oh, maybe not all the goodies like graphics, and
     Faxing, etc, but still a great place to communicate, and for free(?).

     Seventh, and last suggestion for this conclave, okay?  The *free*
     assertion above isn't entirely accurate, anymore.  There seems to be a
     growing fascination with *Pay For Use* bulletin boards.  I suppose
     this is the SysOp way of entering into competition with The Internet.
     But, in reality all that is being accomplished is degradation of
     FidoNet along with the principles and ideals it was founded on.  How
     can anyone expect a user to understand that he/she has to *donate*,
     *help support*, or *become a member* of a bulletin board, in order to
     read/write mail or upload/download a file.  Gee, isn't this just what
     he/she has heard about The Internet?  He/She was under the impression
     that a local bulletin board was there as a *hobby* and was free of
     *service charges*.  He/She thought *hobby* was "something a person
     likes to do in his/her spare time," just like Mr. Webster explains it
     in his dictionary.  I know administering to a bulletin board (BBS)
     isn't cheap, not by a long shot, but it is a *hobby*, and should be
     operated that way.  I started running my first BBS, on an Atari 800,
     in 1978, so trust me when I say *I know about operating costs* first
     hand.  It wasn't until 1984 that I got into the IBM and FidoNet
     business, and even then money was considered a collectors item, to me.
     Granted, after your initial costs, the rest was kind of inexpensive,
     unless you wanted a *BIG* 40Meg Hard Drive, with a price tag of
     $400-500.00.  But at no time did I, or anyone else in the Net (with
     the exception of the then NC) ever even think about charging a user a
     fee.  No one except the *software pirates* who kept copyrighted
     software available for download on their system, for their *paying*
     members.  Hmmm!  Could that be the reason so many systems operate on a
     *Pay Per Use* basis?

     As promised, no more *suggestions* or *criticisms*.  I'll let a
     sleeping (puppy) dog lie, for the time being.  However, I hope what I
     have written will incite others to do the same.  Voices *have* to be
     raised if anything is to be done, and rest assured, something has to
     be done.  FidoNet is in danger of a slow death, unless suitable action
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 5                   10 Feb 1997


     is instituted, and extremely soon.  The people who are really involved
     with FidoNet, and who genuinely care about its existence in the
     future will stand up and let their viewpoints be known.  This has to
     be a combined effort if reconstruction is to take place.

     If by chance this article is published in FidoNet and you find it
     creditable.  I implore you to let the editor (Christopher Baker
     1:18/14) know.  Voice your own opinions and suggestions pertaining to
     the inadequacies of the Policy 4 Document.  If you think *making
     waves* is frowned upon within the FidoNet structure, you have been
     misinformed.  On the off chance your reflection is correct, then more
     then ever *CHANGE* is a necessity, and PDQ.

     Zone 2 nodelist flags
     Frank Ellermann, 2:240/5815.1


     This article informs about known differences of FidoNet zone 2
     nodelist flags from FTS-0005.003.  The ultimate sources for these
     informations are the current zone 2 nodelist epilog and the setup
     for flag corrections at Z2C, but it may be difficult to get these
     sources for readers in other zones.


     FTS-0005 flags
     --------------
     The following flags are used as specified in FTS-0005.003:

          CM      Node accepts mail 24 hours a day
          MO      Node does not accept human callers
          LO      Node accepts calls only from valid listed node
                  numbers in the current FidoNet nodelist

          V21     ITU-T V21      300 bps full duplex
          V22     ITU-T V22     1200 bps full duplex

     In zone 2 a value of 1200 in the former "baud rate" field implies
     V22.  Today only two nodes not supporting at least V22bis or ISDN
     still exist in the zone 2 segment, therefore the flags V21 and V22
     are obsolescent.  Both flags should be dropped from FTS-0005.

          V29     ITU-T V29     9600 bps half duplex
          V33     ITU-T V33

     V33 cannot be used in connecting Fido nodes over public dial-up
     lines and is most probably a historical error in FTS-0005.  This
     flag should be removed from FTS-0005 a.s.a.p.  A similar argument
     is applicable on V29, and few nodes flagging V29 today all support
     at least V32.  The next version of FTS-0005 should drop V29.

          V32     ITU-T V32     9600 bps full duplex
     ->   V32B    ITU-T V32bis 14400 bps full duplex (implies V32)
          V34     ITU-T V34    28800 bps full duplex

     FTS-0005 specifies V32b and V42b (capital V and small b), current
     nodelist practice in FidoNet shows all combinations of small and
     capital letters for flags.  This was no problem before FSC-0062
     introduced case-sensitive flags.  In zone 2 all old flags except
     from FSC-0062 flags are upper case, and a NODEDIFF changing this
     convention would be annoying.  The best solution is to stick to

     If a flag directly or indirectly implies other flags, then these
     other flags are not shown in a nodelist entry, because this would
     be redundant.  Unfortunately the rules for redundancies in zone 2
     and FTS-0005 are different.  Zone 2 continued to avoid redundancy
     with most "new" flags, but FTS-0005.003 specified no redundancies
     for "new" flags like ZYX, H16, V32T, or VFC.  "New" flags in this
     context are flags approved by FidoNet International Coordinators
     since 1989, when FTS-0005.TXT, the predecesssor of FTS-0005.003,
     was published.

     For details see the chapter "implications" below, for now only
     note, that in zone 2 H16 implies V42B, ZYX implies V32B and V42B,
     and V32T implies V32B.

     Zone 1 and zone 2 have introduced a user flag Z19 approved by the
     corresponding Zone Coordinator.  User flags are discussed later,
     for now only note, that in zone 2 ZYX is specified as Zyxel 16k8,
     while FTS-0005.003 not knowing Z19 specifies ZYX as generic flag
     for all Zyxel protocol speeds.

     Today there is only one node in FidoNet still flagging MAX, this
     flag is obsolete and should be dropped from FTS-0005. The flags
     HST, H14, and CSP should be marked as obsolescent.

     As mentioned above FTS-0005 specifies V42b (capital V, small b).
     In zone 2 all case-insensitive flags are listed in upper case.

     The next version of FTS-0005 will probably adopt the better V42B
     and MNP definitions of the zone 3 nodelist epilog.  FTS-0005.003
     specifies an implication of V42 by V42B, but the exact meaning of
     the flag MNP is unclear.  Most probably this flag was meant to
     indicate support of MNP 1-4, and in this sense V42B implies MNP.

     In zone 2 MNP is considered as redundant, if V42B is flagged or
     implied by other flags like H16, ZYX, or Z19.

     Valid values for this flag are assigned by the Fido International

     only GUUCP gateways are flagged.

          #20     Zone 6 mail hour (20:00 - 21:00 UTC) w/ Bell 212A

     The variants !01, !02, !08, !09, !18, and !20 indicate missing
     Bell 212A support.  In zone 2 #02 or !02 would be obviously
     redundant.

     Today less than five 1200 modems (V22 or Bell 212A) are listed.
     A future version of FTS-0005 should drop !mn variants together
     with V21 and V22 flags.

     Further most non-CM systems flagging #mn or !mn today probably
     want to show additional online times instead of additional mail
     hours.  As soon as FSC-0062 flags have been approved by the IC
     or adopted as FTS by the FTSC, the following version of FTS-0005
     should mark #mn as obsolescent and recommend the more flexible
     FSC-0062 flags (see below).


     User flags
     ----------
     An example for one of several problems in zone 2 with user flags:

          ...,U,Z19,V110H,V120L,V120H,X75,ENC,NEC

     These flags indicate a modern Zyxel ISDN-modem and two additional
     user flags ENC and NEC.  This possible user flags string contains
     34 characters, but at most 32 characters are allowed in FTS-0005.

          ...,U,Z19,V110L,V110H,X75,ISDNA,ISDNB,ISDNC

     During the period for the replacement of old by new ISDN flags
     (several months !) many nodes listed both old and new flags for
     maximal compatibility, and no problems with nodelist compilers
     or mailers caused by too long user flags strings were reported.

     Therefore the length limit in FTS-0005 is probably unnecessary
     and at least inconsequent:  Other nodelist fields like the system
     name are unlimited, so why only restrict the user flags string ?
     To help developpers an upper limit of e.g. 255 characters for a
     nodelist line and 63 characters for fields 3 to 6 would be more
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 9                   10 Feb 1997


     useful.

     The next problem with user flag strings as specified in FTS-0005
     is their introduction by the letter U with no comma following:

     Nodelist compilers could parse ...,UISDN,USR in user flags ISDN
     and USR.  But USR cannot be approved as "real" flag, because the
     combination ...,USR,UISDN would then be parsed in SR and UISDN.

     Other side effects of the FTS-0005 specification are additional
     difficulties in finding flags.  Almost all flags are separated
     by a comma, only the first user flag can be an exception to this
     simple rule.  If the order of user flags has no meaning, then...

          ...,UV120L,V120H
          ...,UV120H,V120L

     ... are equivalent.  A "simple" solution of this problem could be
     to treat UV120L as synonym for V120L, and UV120H as synonym for
     V120H.  Similar problems show up, if user flags are counted, etc.

     Obviously a nodelist compiler looking for user flags has always
     to consider the case "user flag separated by comma".  In zone 2
     this idea was simply extended to the first user flag:

     All flags are separated by commas.  Flags not yet approved by the
     International Coordinator or the FTSC (i.e. user flags only used
     experimentally or locally) are separated by a new pseudo flag U.

     ->   U       pseudo flag to the left of at least one user flag

     All flags following this pseudo flag U are user flags, all flags
     before this pseudo flag are "real" flags specified in FTS-0005 or
     approved by the International Coordinator.

     Because this definition should be compatible with any reasonable
     software implementation based on FTS-0005.003, and simplifies the
     handling of user flags significantly, a future FTS-0005 version
     will hopefully adopt it.


     Approved zone 2 user flags
     --------------------------
     In zone 2 user flags have to be approved by the Zone Coordinator.
     Currently the following zone 2 user flags exist:

     ->   V110L   ITU-T V.110 19k2 async 'Low'    (former ISDNA)
     ->   V110H   ITU-T V.110 38k4 async 'High'   (former ISDNB)
     ->   V120L   ITU-T V.120 56k6 async, N1 = 259, W = 7, modulo 8
     ->   V120H   ITU-T V.120 64k  async, N1 = 259, W = 7, modulo 8
     ->   X75     ITU-T X.75 SLP (single link procedure),
                  64kbit/s B channel; layer 2 max. framesize N1 = 2048,
                  window size W = 2, frame numbering modulo 8;
                  layer 3 transparent (no packet layer)
     ->   ISDN    Other configuration, used only if none of above fits

     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 10                  10 Feb 1997


     These ISDN flags follow the specification in FSC-0091.

     ->   Tyz     Online time flags as specified in FSC-0062

     The flag Tyz is used by non-CM nodes online not only during ZMH,
     y is a letter indicating the start and z a letter indicating the
     end of the online period as defined below (times in UTC):

          A  0:00,  a  0:30,   B  1:00,  b  1:30,   C  2:00,  c  2:30,
          D  3:00,  d  3:30,   E  4:00,  e  4:30,   F  5:00,  f  5:30,
          G  6:00,  g  6:30,   H  7:00,  h  7:30,   I  8:00,  i  8:30,
          J  9:00,  j  9:30,   K 10:00,  k 10:30,   L 11:00,  l 11:30,
          M 12:00,  m 12:30,   N 13:00,  n 13:30,   O 14:00,  o 14:30,
          P 15:00,  p 15:30,   Q 16:00,  q 16:30,   R 17:00,  r 17:30,
          S 18:00,  s 18:30,   T 19:00,  t 19:30,   U 20:00,  u 20:30,
          V 21:00,  v 21:30,   W 20:00,  w 20:30,   X 23:00,  x 23:30.

     For example TuB shows an online period from 20:30 until 1:00 UTC.

     ->   Z19     Zyxel series 19200 bps (implies ZYX)

     ->   K12     Systems offering all educational K12-conferences
     ->   ENC     The node accepts inbound encrypted mail

     ->   NC      Network Coordinator (only if the NC is not the host)
     ->   NEC     Net Echomail Coordinator    (at most one per net)
     ->   REC     Region Echomail Coordinator (at most one per region)
     ->   ZEC     Zone Echomail Coordinator   (at most one per zone)

     Redundant AKAs used to indicate echomail coordination in zone 2
     are no longer permitted.  One *EC flag is valid for all AKAs of
     a given sysop.


     Flag implications
     -----------------
     Flag implications directly or indirectly specified in FTS-0005:

          HST     => MNP
          H14     => MNP HST
          H16     => MNP HST H14
          V42b    => V42 (MNP ?)
          V32b    => V32

     Flag implications specified in the zone 2 nodelist epilog:

          HST     => MNP
          H14     => HST MNP
     ->   H16     => V42 MNP V42B H14 HST
     ->   V42B    => V42 MNP
     ->   ZYX     => V42 MNP V42B V32B
     ->   Z19     => V42 MNP V42B V32B ZYX
          V32B    => V32
     ->   V32T    => V32 V32B

     ->   V110L   => ISDN
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 11                  10 Feb 1997


     ->   V110H   => ISDN
     ->   V120L   => ISDN
     ->   V120H   => ISDN
     ->   X75     => ISDN

     The latter ISDN flag redundancies are a consequence of FSC-0091.
     Maybe one of the following implications could be added in zone 2:

          VFC     => V32 V32B
          VFC     => V32 V32B MNP V42 V42B

     Flag implications (i.e. not listing redundant flags) have several
     advantages:  Some old nodelist tools are unable to handle too long
     lines.  Old flags like HST, MNP, V42, or V32 vanish automatically,
     if they are implied by H16, V42B, V32B, or better.  Redundancies
     defined globally for the whole nodelist help to avoid flag errors.


     "Baud rate" field
     -----------------
     The former "baud rate" field 7 in the nodelist as specified in
     FTS-0005 is nearly useless today:  Except from a few remaining
     1200 and 2400 nodes almost all nodelist entries show either 9600
     for all modem protocols better than V22bis or 300 for ISDN only
     nodes.  No more V21 or Bell 103 modems are listed today.

     Obscure "baud rate" values 19200 and 38400 specified in FTS-0005
     have not been used in the FidoNet nodelist.  So all a reasonable
     nodelist compiler can do today, is treat 300 as indicator for
     ISDN only, and treat unknown or missing values in field 7 like
     9600.

     A new meaning for field 7 as speed field could be really useful.
     An example is ZYX, if we would have 16800, 19200, 28800, and 33600
     as speed values, then their combination with ZYX is all we need
     technically, Z19 would be unnecessary.  Another example is HST,
     flags H14 and H16 are unnecessary, if HST is combined with 9600,
     14400, 16800, 28800, or 33600.  Variants of PEP could be shown in
     the speed field without new flags.  "Enhanced V32.terbo" could be
     shown by 21600.

     Most important:  V34 may have the famous bug not allowing connects
     from new "V34+", unless the caller disabled symbol rate 3429.  If
     "V34+" is indicated by speed 33600, then an appropriate setup for
     all kinds of V34 connects is possible.

     A future version of FTS-0005 hopefully allows the following speed
     values in field 7:

            300   reserved for ISDN only (for historical reasons)
           1200   V22 or Bell 212A (obsolete)
           2400   implies V22bis
           9600   default, used with V32, HST, H96, PEP, CSP
          12000   rare variant of V32
          14400   used with V32b or HST (obsoleting H14)
          16800   used with ZYX  or HST (obsoleting H16)
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 12                  10 Feb 1997


          19200   used with V32T or ZYX (obsoleting Z19)
          21600   rare variant of V32T (no "H21" needed)
          28800   used with VFC or V34
          33600   used with V34 (no V34+ or V34b needed)
          57600   used with "X2" clients

     The following values should be specified in FTS-0005, because they
     are already used in nodelists of other FTNs:

          empty   no value, useful for Pvt nodes or in point lists
          19200   used with V110L, V32T, or ZYX (obsoleting Z19)
          38400   used with V110H
          57600   used with V120L or "X2"
          64000   used with V120H, X75, or other ISDN equipment

     Allowing more than 12 speed values or allowing ISDN speeds could
     break old software.  Therefore the transition could be done in two
     steps, first add all non-ISDN speeds (ISDN only shown as 300).

     Later remove 300 (ISDN only) and 1200 (obsolete) replacing 300 by
     19200, 38400, 57600, or 64000.

     A reply to "Fidonews, The "lard ass" of newsletters"

     By Tony Dunlap, 1:2220/30

     I was reading the paper the other day and noticed in the want ads a
     Maytag wringer washer for sale for $35.00. There was also an article
     with "Your Twelve Favorite Recipes Using Yogurt" (Not that I'd ever
     eat anything with a name that sounds like something that had already
     been eaten (then disposed of)). Then of course there were the funnies
     (most of which weren't), and the bridge column. I am not interested
     in any of these things, but I at least glance at them (mainly in hope
     of gaining a glimmer of understanding of the deranged minds of people
     who would be interested in such things <g>).

     The point I am trying to make is that Fidonews is for all members of
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 13                  10 Feb 1997


     Fidonet, not just the majority, and if a article is found useful by
     just one member, it belongs there.

     As for it's size, come on! All of last year's Fnews in their
     distrubuted format (LZH and ZIP) will fit on one high density floppy
     (Try to store a year's worth of newspapers in that space!)

     By the way, just for fun I called about the wringer washer...
     It's gone.

     Ooh, ow!  You wound me!
     by Gary Gilmore, 1:2410/400


     Well, it seems that it's ok to write something -for- Fidonews, just
     as long as you don't -talk- about Fidonews.  <sigh>  I thought the
     "editorial" about my article was a little out of line, but thought
     "what the hell, I'll respond".  The Fidonews editor's comments are
     quoted...

      cb> He doesn't say how long he's been around but only refers to
      cb> the output of Tees, the previous Editor as example of FidoNews
      cb> size past.

     Gee, I didn't know that mattered.  I guess it's part of a Fido
     "elite-ism" of "my board is older than yours, so you're not as good
     as me", which I've always found silly.  Heck, I've seen BBS systems
     that have been up for a month that have floored me, and I've seen
     very old BBS systems that were total garbage, so what's the
     difference?  For what it's worth, my BBS has been in constant
     operation since January 9th, 1988.  I've been in Fidonet since 1990.
     (Somewhere around the summer of that year, if I recall right.  My
     system was even a Computer Shopper Magazine "BBS Of The Month" for
     May of 1991.. not that it means a whole lot in the big picture.

     Now, does any of that make my comments more or less valid?  <shrug>
     I don't think so.  We're Fidonet sysops, this is Fidonews, and that
     means this is the place where we can comment.  ...and our comments
     shouldn't be cast aside with editorials trying to make them seem less
     valid than the next persons.

      cb> Since Tees didn't bother to actively edit FidoNews many times,
      cb> it's hardly surprising many of his Issues were miniscule or
      cb> Editorial only phosphor padding.

     Oh geez... now it's "slag the old editor" time.  I find it humorous
     that the term "phosphor padding" is used here, when this past issue
     contains yet more FTSC bulletins to puff up the S'nooze.  Ah well...

      cb> FidoNews has been all sizes the past 13 years from 5K to 157K.

     But I do think the content has varied wildly.  Sometimes great stuff,
     sometimes nothing but dreck.  I know the contributors have the burden
     of making Fidonews what it is, but I still don't think intentionally
     puffing it up makes it better.

      cb> Nobody has to read it; part or all of it.

     Very true, and perhaps the more dry it gets, the less it's read.
     I can't count the times I've said "Did you read <article name> in
     Fidonews?" to some fellow sysops, and they almost always say "Ah, I
     never read that thing".  Too bad.  I do.  All the time.

      cb> The History and Standards series is part of what FidoNet is and

     Sure is!  I don't think it needs to be completely reprinted though,
     since it's already available elsewhere.  Those that really care to
     read it will go get it.  Those that don't are (to quote myself)
     "furiously hitting the page down key" to avoid it, so what's the use?
     Got me.

      cb> going to keep going this way. There are FIVE FSCs in this Issue.
      cb> There are only sixty or so more to go. [grin]

     Thanks for the warning!  I guess it'll be safe to read Fidonews again
     sometime after the next 13 issues if one wants to avoid them. <laugh>

      cb> The software list is also an important part of the FidoNews
      cb> mission and we all are indebted to Peter Popovich for the
      cb> Herculean labors he

     Umm, I do believe that I gave credit -and- thanks to Peter.  What I
     -did- say is that Peter should be given a little break, and only have
     to have a listing ready monthly.  That's all is really needed, since
     software isn't going to change that fast, and if "Brand X" drops
     support this week, waiting for a notice 3 weeks from now won't kill
     anyone.  (And it'll give Peter more time to get good follow up
     information on these packages.)

      cb> the Echomail weenies flee FidoNet

     Echomail weenies?  Hmmm..  I don't know what's wrong with echomail,
     but you seem to not like those that use it, judging by how many times
     you use this phrase in your editorial.

      cb> for the apparently greener pastures of Internet mailing lists,

     Funny this is here, since you're promoting a mailing list version of
     Fidonews. Imagine! <laugh>  Indeed, there's more -Internet- promoting
     of Fidonews (in the Fidonews) than there is of promoting how to get
     it via Fidonet.

      cb> Those who can't, get jobs as critics. I'm doing and teaching.

     Those that can't take criticism shouldn't be editors, I guess.
     Sorry to see you take it so personally, and feel the need to turn to
     thinly veiled insults in order to rebut what I've said, Chris.

     What is a Gateway to/from FidoNet?
     ---- -- - ------- ------- --------

     A gateway is a collection of software and procedures whereby net mail
     and/or echomail may be transferred between FidoNet and another
     computer communications network.  Gateways are bi-directional, as folk
     always want to reply to others' mail.

     Gateways exist now.

       o There are a number of software packages for gating between uucp-
         based systems and FidoNet, the most well-known beingthe UFGATE
         shareware package.  These packages gate both netmail and echomail,
         and are often used to provide FidoNet access to/from Internet via
         the uucp network.  These tend to go through much effort to make
         FidoNet look as much like Internet as possible.  As of this
         writing, about 25 uucp gateways are scattered around FidoNet.

       o Rhodes University has developed a complete system between a Cyber-
         based NOS network and FidoNet.  This system handles both net mail
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 17                  10 Feb 1997


         and echomail, and is also strongly based on the Internet
         standards, and almost views FidoNet as a transport mechanism to
         get to/from Internet.  It is used to gate a fairly localized
         cluster of mainframes to FidoNet at a single point, and has made
         special arrangements for further routing and forwarding of mail.

       o WWIVnet has developed gating software based on the ForDog package
         for the MS-DOS-based WWIV systems, and some other package for the
         Mac-based Tabby systems.  The MS-DOS system uses Binkley or
         another FidoNet mailer handles the protocol transfers to make the
         WWIV system look like a FidoNet system to other FidoNet nodes.
         WWIVnet gates are said to be scattered around the US and Canada.

       o A number of FidoNet-based systems have been developed for various
         flavors of UN*X.  These vary from encapsulated Fido-worlds within
         UN*X (i.e not true gates at all), to FidoNet front ends for UN*X
         mail systems.

       o RBBS-net seems to have developed gateway software for the MS-DOS-
         based BBS network, but I do not know enough to characterize it.

     All of these gateway systems can and are being run in a safe and
     cooperative fashion, and are providing a nice cross-cultural exchange
     with benefits for both sides of the gates.

     At this time, there are also other nets which, because they are based
     on technology similar to FidoNet, are dumping mail onto and taking
     mail off of FidoNet willy nilly, with little thought to the technical,
     administrative, or social consequences.  Often, this is done with good
     intentions, not realizing they are providing a disservice to both
     nets.

     What are the Characteristics of a Good Gateway?
     ---- --- --- --------------- -- - ---- --------

     Like good contracts, good gateways should be fair to both sides.
     There is the need to preserve both the technical and sociopolitical
     integrity of all parties to the transaction.

     Technically, both networks will have specifications and requirements
     for transfer protocols, message and echomail formats, control data
     files, etc.  Beyond the borders of the gateway software, each universe
     should be completely and safely maintained.

       o Messages and echomail should completely conform in format and
         content to the technical specifications of each side of the
         gateway.

       o Addressing of messages and echomail should completely conform to
         that of the network in or through which the messages are traveling
         or resident at all times.

       o A normal user should be able to enter new messages destined for
         the other side of the gate and to reply to gated mail with
         relative ease.

     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 18                  10 Feb 1997


       o If FidoNet uses a network A as an intermediate to get to/from a
         network B, or if network C uses FidoNet to get to/from network D,
         then the inter-net transitions should be auditable, but local
         customs and technalia of the intermediate network may not need
         always be enforced.  Socially, the customs and fashions of each
         network should be maintained in that network.

       o There must be administrative liaison and control between the two
         networks so agreements may be made and enforced and disputes may
         be adjudicated.

       o If the networks being gated overlap geographically, then systems
         should not have to pay significant costs to move mail between the
         two networks when it is between two nodes that are in the same
         general locale.

       o Gating is not simple, technically or administratively.  Unless
         each net anticipates significant use of the gateways, and the
         anticipated gain is seen as greater than the anticipated pain,
         then one side or the other may reasonably decline to do the
         necessary work.

     What Technical Standards Exist?
     ---- --------- --------- ------

     Before we develop new specifications, social protocols, and standards,
     we should see what exists already.

       o FidoNet Technical Standards exist already for the data formats and
         the communication protocols for net mail and echomail.  All
         conforming gateway systems mentioned above conform to these
         standards.  These are named FSC-nnnn, or more recently FTS-nnnn.

       o The SRI-NIC has published standards for message formats and
         communication protocols that are used between a significant number
         of networks that already gate to each other.  These are often
         referred to as the Internet standards and named RFCnnnn or
         IDEAnnnn.

       o The ISO and CCITT have standards for message formats and
         communication protocols which are used between a significant
         number of systems.  These
         are based on X.nnn specifications, eg. X.400.

     Other standards undoubtedly exist and should be investigated by anyone
     desiring to build a gateway system.

     The game of 'my standard is better than yours' has been played for
     decades with no conclusion other then demonstrating the stupidity of
     war.  What matters is that each net's standards are maintained within
     that net.

     What Administrative Standards Exist?
     ---- -------------- --------- ------

     Most networks have formed administrative procedures and guidelines
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 19                  10 Feb 1997


     which regulate if and how other networks may gate to/from them.

     The most notable exception is the uucp/Usenet which, having no
     formalized administrative rules for anything else, imposes none on
     gateways.  Before we recoil in horror, note that uucp/Usenet is three
     to four times the size of FidoNet, is over twice FidoNet's age, and
     has a significantly better signal-to-noise ratio.

     The SRI-NIC provides a procedure for registering Internet domains.  A
     domain is somewhat like what we are considering a network.  This
     Internet registration procedure ensures that the network has

       o administrative responsibility and control, and
       o at least two registered sites which provide address mapping for
         the netowrk being gated.

     FidoNet is a registered domain of Internet.  Our domain is called
     fidonet.org.  The administrative responsibility is the FidoNet IC's.
     The registered 'nameservers' are at lynx.cs.orst.edu and
     k9.cs.orst.edu, both at Oregon State University, though this is
     bending the two nameserver policy a bit.

     DECNET, ARPANET, ... all have applicable standards, but, as they are
     strictly limited to formal commercial relationships, they are of
     little interest here.

     What Administrative Policies are Needed by FidoNet?
     ---- -------------- -------- --- ------ -- --------

     What does FidoNet really need to state in terms of administrative
     requirements on a network wishing to gate to/from FidoNet?

     FidoNet needs a means of ensuring that a formal relationship exists
     which may be used to negotiate technical standards between the two
     nets, internet adjudication of disagreements both technical and
     social, and enforcement of decisions.  Similarly, the other network
     will likely want such assurances as well.  Therefore an agreement
     should be reached stating:

       o who is administratively responsible,

       o who is technically responsible,

       o what technical and administrative documentation exists, and

       o both parties will abide by eachother's rules when in the other's
         house, and

       o how grievances are to be stated and adjudicated.

     In addition, it will be advisable for FidoNet to place some
     requirements on a network wishing to form official gateways.  Some of
     these requirements and their motivations are:

       o If the other network geographically overlaps a significant portion
         of FidoNet, then the other net should be of sufficient size that
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 20                  10 Feb 1997


         gateways can likely be recruited in most areas where the nets
         overlap.  Thus, systems should not have to pay significant costs
         to move mail between two nets that happen to be in the same
         locale.

       o If the other network geographically overlaps a significant portion
         of FidoNet, then there should, at a minimum, be gateways in each
         FidoNet zone where they overlap.

       o If the other network geographically overlaps more than one zone of
         FidoNet, then that net should have its own gateways between the
         zones, and not use FidoNet to move the burden of interzone PTT
         costs.

       o If the other network geographically overlaps a significant number
         of the regions in a FidoNet zone, then there should, at a minimum,
         be gateways in each FidoNet region where they overlap.

       o If the other network is geographically localized, then special
         arrangements may be made whereby there traffic is gated to/from
         FidoNet at one or more places by special arrangement as if the
         other network were a FidoNet node or local network (in the intra-
         FidoNet sense) itself.

       o Gating of net mail, i.e. user-to-user messages, must be
         implemented and easily used.  Gating of Echomail is optional.

       o Mail must be bi-directional.  If someone in the other net can send
         mail to a node/user on FidoNet, then that FidoNet node/user must
         be able to  reply.

       o If echomail is gated, then, unless special circumstances are
         recognized by the responsible administrators, it must be gated bi-
         directionally.

       o If a conference is moderated (in the Usenet sense, similar to
         Dutchie's Conference Mail's moderation or GroupMail) on one
         network, then it should be moderated on all other networks, or at
         least the gateway into the network where it is moderated should
         ensure that correct moderation is done by forwarding or whatever
         is appropriate.

     For inter-net gateway systems in the process of formation, it is
     assumed that some of the above requirements may be waived during a
     startup period at the discretion of the administrative bodies.

     Observe that if FidoNet were to try to take a shortcut which has been
     suggested and simply require Intetnet registration of gating networks,
     then, of the current networks gating to FidoNet correctly (see above),
     only the Rhodes system could conform technically.  Eg. the uucp gating
     packages gate to uucp which has no administrative center and is not
     registered with Internet.  To require Internet registration would
     further neither the goals of Internet, nets wishing to gate to
     FidoNet, nor FidoNet itself.

     What Technical Requirements should FidoNet Place on Gating Systems?
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 21                  10 Feb 1997


     ---- --------- ------------ ------ ------- ----- -- ------ --------

     Each network will have its own specifications for communication
     protocols, data formats, message conventions, addressing, etc.  Though
     more generally used standards are to be preferred, what really matters
     is that each net be self-consistent and integritous and that gateway
     systems maintain that integrity.

     From the FidoNet perspective, the following attributes of a gateway
     system seem to be mandatory.

       o Conformance to FidoNet message format as specified in current
         FidoNet technical standards (eg. currently FSC-0001) must be
         maintained while messages are within FidoNet.

       o Information to assist message comprehension and processing by
         gateway systems and/or other networks may be contained within the
         message body, either hidden behind ^A lines or not.  If such
         information is needed, then conformance to current Internet
         standards (eg. currently RFC822) is recommended.

       o The FidoNet message header must contain valid FidoNet addresses at
         all times the message is on FidoNet.  Valid FidoNet addresses are
         addresses of specific FidoNet nodes in the current FidoNet
         nodelist.

       o The source and/or destination address in the other net should be
         embedded in the text body of the FidoNet message, either hidden
         behind ^A lines or not.  Conformance to current Internet standards
         is recommended where appropriate, but addressing conventions in
         the other net may preclude this.

       o A message must contain sufficient information that the originating
         system and user may be easily determined.

       o A FidoNet sysop and/or normal FidoNet BBS user should be able to
         enter messages destined for users in the other network and reply
         to gated mail using current FidoNet software.

       o If echomail is gated, then the echo messages should conform to all
         current FidoNet standards for echomail.  For example, currently an
         echomail message should:

         - have a correct tear line
         - have an origin line of the proper format with a FidoNet origin
           of the gating FidoNet node
         - have seenbys of only FidoNet nodes
         - have a path line that goes back at least to the gating node

       o If echomail is gated, then an echomail message must contain
         sufficient information that the system and user of origin may be
         trivially determined, whatever net may have originated it.

       o The origin of gated echomail should be determinable in a regular
         way sufficient that the gating software can provide easy
         construction of private net mail replies to echomail messages
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 22                  10 Feb 1997


         which would return to the echo messages's originator through the
         appropriate gateway, which may or may not be different than the
         gateway through which the echo message came.  It is acknowledged
         that this may require  hand editing on the part of the user
         composing the reply.

       o If echomail is gated, and the other net has no equivalent, it may
         use net mail and/or net mail mailing lists.  Messages coming into
         FidoNet from this type of net mail or mailing list should properly
         gate into the appropriate echomail conference, and replies should
         work correctly as well.

     Conclusion
     ----------

     It is hoped that, given a philosophy and guidelines such as those
     outlined in this paper, FidoNet will continue to expand its links to
     other networks to the benefit of FidoNet and networking in general.

     It is hoped that this paper will be of some help to those constructing
     gateways to/from FidoNet, and to the administrators of FidoNet and
     other nets who are considering gating to/from FidoNet.

     This paper, the purported facts contained, and the philosophy espoused
     are the sole responsibility of the author, and are quite likely
     technically incorrect and are undoubtedly morally bankrupt.  Should
     you have constructive correction or criticism, please contact:

     Gateways
     --------

     Gatewaying between Fidonet and other networks seems to be the latest
     feature which hopefully brings more benefits to the users of each
     network.  But there are some real problems with gatewaying and doing
     "transparent" replies.  This proposal should allow for almost totally
     transparent gateways but requires the co-operation of BBS software
     writers to support this following protocol.

     Incoming Messages
     -----------------

     When a message is entered into fidonet from another network it will be
     entering through one machine (say 1/2).  The userid on the other
     network may not match very will with the 2 word 36 character userid on
     Fidonet.  So the following is done to store away the proper userid of
     the sender.

     Two (2) lines are added to the message (usually at the top of the text
     portion hidden by the infamous ^A KLUDGE).

     ^AREPLYADDR .....\r

     which signifies the FULL userid of the person on the other network.
     The first 36 characters or the full userid if less than 36 characters
     long, are stored in the FROM field of the message header.  When
     replies are done they use a second line of the following form.

     ^REPLYTO zone:net/node firstname lastname

     which is used to signify the "userid" which mail destined to this
     other network must be sent to and on which machine that userids
     resides.  Replies are sent to this zone:net/node and userid with the
     first line of the message being changed into 'TO: ....' where .... is
     the FULL userid from the ^AREPLYADDR line.

                              GROUP MAIL SPECIFICATIONS

     Group Message Files

     A Group Message File is a file which contains messages for a
     particular group conference. The file is named as follows:

          <id>.xxx

     Where:
          <id> is the GroupMail ID name
          xxx  is the minute of the month that  the last packet was added
               to the file in base  36 (0..9,A..Z).  The following
               extensions are  NOT used ARC, BAT,  COM, DOC, EXE, PKT,
               TXT. If a packet  is created would normally have this name,
               the minute is "bumped up" one  to avoid using  these names.
               (This is  also the  extension used  by ARCmail).

     Each file can contain several packets of messages. Packets should be
     in the Fido type 2  packet. The packets start  off with a packet
     header. Messages follow  the  packet header.  Each message  starts
     off with  an abbreviated packetized message header. Following the
     header are several variable length fields. The structures is as
     follows:

          struct pkthdrs {              /* packet header structure */
               int ph_onode;            /* Originating node number */
               int ph_dnode;            /* Destination node number */
               int ph_yr,ph_mo,ph_dy;   /* Date packet was assembled */
               int ph_hr,ph_mn,ph_sec;  /* Time packet was assembled */
               int ph_rate;             /* packet baud rate */
               int ph_ver;              /* packet version */
               int ph_onet;             /* Originating net */
               int ph_dnet;             /* destination net */
               int ph_rsvd[17];         /* Reserved for possible future use
               */ };

          struct pktmsgs {              /* packetized message headers */
               int pm_ver;              /* message version */
               int pm_onode;            /* Originating node */
               int pm_dnode;            /* Destination node */
               int pm_onet;             /* Originating net */
               int pm_dnet;             /* Destination net */
               int pm_attr;             /* Message attributes */
               int pm_cost;             /* message cost in cents */
               };

     The variable length data that follows is:
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 25                  10 Feb 1997


          Field Description             Maximum length (in characters)
               Date                          20
               To whom                       36
               Who From                      36
               Subject                       72
               Message text                  8192

     The packet is finished when in place of the packetized message header
     there are two null characters.

     Message Attributes

     Message  headers  contain an  integer  field holding  "message
     attributes." These are bit  values that select various  properties of
     the  message. They are defined as follows:

          #define MSGPRIVATE  0x0001    /* Private message */
          #define MSGCRASH    0x0002    /* Crash priority message */
          #define MSGREAD     0x0004    /* Read by addressee */
          #define MSGSENT     0x0008    /* Sent okay */
          #define MSGFILE     0x0010    /* file attached */
          #define MSGFWD      0x0020    /* being forwarded */
          #define MSGORPHAN   0x0040    /* Unknown destination */
          #define MSGKILL     0x0080    /* Kill after mailing */
          #define MSGLOCAL    0x0100    /* True if message entered here */
          #define MSGHOLD     0x0200    /* true if hold for pickup */
          #define MSGX2       0x0400    /* reserved -- sent */
          #define MSGFREQ     0x0800    /* Requesting a file */
          #define MSGRREQ     0x1000    /* Return Receipt requested */
          #define MSGRRCT     0x2000    /* Return Receipt */
          #define MSGAREQ     0x4000    /* Request audit trail */
          #define MSGUREQ     0x8000    /* Requesting a file update */

     The following attribute bits are included in the packetized message
     header.

          MSGPRIVATE     MSGFILE   MSGCRASH  MSGX2     MSGRREQ
          MSGRRCT        MSGAREQ

     All other attributes are masked off and are not sent to other systems.

     Packet files names are as follows:

          ddhhmmss.PKT

     Where:
          dd   is the day of the month the packet was created
          hh   is the hour (24 hour clock) the packet was created
          mm   is the minute the packet was created
          ss   is the second the packet was created

     For example if a GroupMail file in the conference SAMPLE is  created
     on the 22nd of a month at 08:15 the Groupmail name would be
     SAMPLE.NPR.

               21 full days                  8.25 hours

          x  1440 minutes per day       x      60 minutes per hour
          -------                       ---------
            30240 minutes                     495 minutes
          +   495 minutes in today
          -------
            30735 minutes into the month     Convert to base 36: NPR

     Note that at most there are 44640 minutes in a month and this naming
     scheme has the capability  to handle up to  46656 file names. The
     remaining names (2015 files or an average of 65 files per day) may be
     used for distributing other files in a conference (anything over YG0,
     hint if it starts with Z it makes it easy  to identify, still leaves
     1296 different files or average of 41 files per day).

     Disk Directories

     GroupMail  uses two  special directories for  distributing it's
     files. The first of  these directories contains  what I will  be
     calling a  group date file  and any unprocessed,  inbound group files.
     The Group Date  File is a zero length file in the format:

          <id>.!

     Where:
          <id> is the Group conference name

     When new files  are update requested, the  mailer should only obtain
     those files whose time/date stamps are later than this file's
     time/date stamp (or any unprocessed group files with a later time/date
     stamp).

     This directory will be referred to as the Group Inbound Directory.

     If a  system is holding  any conferences for  others to update
     request, it will need another directory. This directory  holds all
     processed Group Mail Files.  These files  can be  held for  up to  31
     days.  After a  file whose conference is  being held for  others is
     processed,  it should be  moved to this directory. This  move MUST
     leave the  time/date stamp as it  was. If a system deviates this for
     ANY reason WOE unto they who wrote  the Group Mail processor.  This
     directory  will  be  referred  to as  the  Group  Holding Directory.

     Message files

     In theory  (and  almost always  in practice)  you can  store the
     processed messages in  any format  you desire.  New messages  must be
     put into  your network mail area as a message your mailer can handle
     and send  properly to other Fido compatible  bulletin board
     systems/mailers.  The structure of  a Fido message is as follows:

          struct msghdrs {              /* Message header structure */
               char m_from[36];         /* Who from */
               char m_to[36];           /* to whom */
               char m_subj[72];         /* subject of message */
               char m_date[20];         /* Date of message */
               int  m_times;            /* Number of times read */
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 27                  10 Feb 1997


               int  m_dnode;            /* Destination node */
               int  m_onode;            /* Originating node */
               int  m_cost;             /* Cost of message in cents */
               int  m_onet;             /* Originating net */
               int  m_dnet;             /* Destination net */
               int  m_caca;             /* extra space */
               int  unsigned m_rep;     /* Thread to previous */
               int  m_attr;             /* Message attributes */
               int  m_up;               /* Thread to next */
               };

     The header is followed by the text of the message. This text is stored
     as a string of characters ending  with a null. The  text may or may
     not contain carriage returns, each  of which may or may not be
     followed by a linefeed.  Any of  these carriage returns may be "soft."
     If the high order bit (0x80) of the carriage  return is set,  then it
     is a  soft return. Line  feeds and soft returns should be ignored.

     More on the actual messages later on.

     Processing inbound messages

     For conferences where you are NOT the top star

     Unprocessed  Group  Message Files  are in  the  Group Inbound
     Directory. A processor should go through  all Group Message Files
     which  are conferences that the  system actually caries  (as opposed
     to  just passing  through for other  systems). The  file's name
     should  be used  to determine  for which conference  these messages
     are  destined. While  most processors  have the first line  of text
     read as  ^AAREA:<id> (no  spaces), this  is meant  for compatibility
     to those systems which do not yet have GROUP capabilities. In short,
     YOU  CAN NOT  DEPEND ON IT  BEING THERE,  so USE  THE FILENAME.  The
     packets should  be extracted from the archived  message file, put into
     your message  base. The packet files  should then be  deleted.
     Messages put into your message base from these Group  Message Files
     should be marked in  some way so  that they are not processed as
     newly entered messages. SEA's GROUP utility uses the  message sent
     flag for  this purpose and we  recommend the use of the same flag
     wherever possible.

     After  all Group  Message Files have  been processed, the  Group Date
     Files should have their time/date stamp changed  to that of the most
     recent  file processed. Any Group  Message Files  for conferences
     being  held for  other systems should be moved to the Group Holding
     Directory so other systems can request these files.  When the Group
     Message File is moved,  the time/date stamp on the file MUST NOT be
     changed. Group Message Files  for conferences not being held for
     others should be deleted.

     It is also desirable  at this time to delete any Group  Message Files
     which are over one month old, or whatever period of time  less than
     one month the system operator of that board desires.

     For conferences where you ARE the top star

     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 28                  10 Feb 1997


     You  should check for  any new netmail  messages whose  ^AAREA:<id>
     line is "your" conference ID. These  messages should be imported into
     your message base with  the message sent  flag (or your  own
     equivalent) turned  OFF. At such a time as you "PACK" new Group
     Message Files you should turn the  sent flag ON.

     Processing new outbound messages

     For conferences where you ARE NOT the top star

     Your  group  processor should  scan through  all  group conferences
     on the system and  locate any  messages which  have been  entered.
     These  messages should be prepared to be sent  out via network mail.
     The first line  of the network mail message should read:

          ^AAREA:<id>

     Where:
          <id> is the Group conference name

     There should be no spaces in  this area, although your processor
     should  be tolerant of any spaces if they are present.

     The message should be "from" your address and addressed to your upward
     link in  the  conference. In  addition  the  message  should  be
     marked  to  be deleted/killed after being sent.

     You should also  check to  see if any  messages in  your netmail area
     from other systems are for a GroupMail conference (either one you
     carry, or pass on to other systems). Any of  these messages should be
     readdressed to  your upward link in the conference. Under no
     circumstances should you change the from fields, they should contain
     the address  of the person who entered the message into the
     conference.

     For conferences where you ARE the top star

     Messages should  be "copied" from your  message base into a  properly
     named Group Message File. This  Group Message File must have a
     correct time/date stamp and  be in  your Group  Holding Directory.
     Once a  message has  been copied into a  Group Message File, it is
     necessary to mark it  so the same message is not placed into another
     Group Message File. SEA's GROUP uses the message sent flag  for this
     purpose and  we recommend the  use of the  same flag whenever
     possible.

     I think that's it.  Everything else is handled by your  mailer. In
     order to get new  Group Mail  messages, you do  a file  update request
     of  the GROUP conference name (<id>.*)  with the  update pointing to
     your Group  Inbound Directory. Your mailer  will then get any new
     Group Message Files from your upward link in  the conference. As new
     Group Message Files are  processed, those who are obtaining their
     conferences from you will perform file update requests from your Group
     Holding Directory.

     -----------------------------------------------------

     Plato:
     For the greater good.

     Karl Marx:
     It was a historical inevitability.

     Thomas de Torquemada:
     Give me ten minutes with the chicken and I'll find out.

     Timothy Leary:
     Because that's the only kind of trip the Establishment would
     let it take.

     Douglas Adams:

     Oliver North:
     National Security was at stake.

     Carl Jung:
     The confluence of events in the cultural gestalt necessitated
     that individual chickens cross roads at this historical
     juncture, and therefore synchronicitously brought such
     occurrences into being.

     Jean-Paul Sartre:
     In order to act in good faith and be true to itself, the
     chicken found it necessary to cross the road.

     Ludwig Wittgenstein:
     The possibility of "crossing" was encoded into the objects
     "chicken" and "road," and circumstances came into being which
     caused the actualization of this potential  occurrence.

     Albert Einstein:
     Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road crossed the
     chicken depends upon your frame of reference.

     Ernest Hemingway:

     We are not sure which side of the road the chicken was on, but
     it was moving very fast.

     David Hume:
     Out of custom and habit.

     Saddam Hussein:
     This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite
     justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

     Jack Nicholson:
     'cause it (censored) wanted to.  That's the (censored) reason.

     Pyrrho the Skeptic:
     What road?

     Ronald Reagan:
     I forget.

     John Sununu:
     The Air Force was only too happy to provide the transportation,

     opportunity.

     The Sphinx:
     You tell me.

     Sappho:
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 33                  10 Feb 1997


     Due to the loveliness of the hen on the other side, more fair
     than all of Hellas' fine armies.

     Henry David Thoreau:
     To live deliberately ... and suck all the marrow out of life.

     Mark Twain:
     The news of its crossing has been greatly exaggerated.

     Stephen Jay Gould:
     It is possible that there is a sociobiological explanation for
     it, but we have been deluged in recent years with
     sociobiological stories despite the fact that we have little
     direct evidence about the genetics of behavior, and we do not
     know how to obtain it for the specific behaviors that figure
     most prominently in sociobiological speculation.

     Joseph Stalin:
     I don't care.  Catch it.  Crack its eggs to make my omelette.

     Captain James T. Kirk:
     To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

     Machiavelli:
     So that its subjects will view it with admiration, as a chicken
     which has the daring and courage to boldly cross the road, but
     also with fear, for whom among them has the strength to contend
     with such a paragon of avian virtue?  In such a manner is the
     princely chicken's dominion maintained.

     Hippocrates:
     Because of an excess of pleghm in its pancreas.

     Peter Hutton:
     Because it was cheaper for the company on the other side of
     the road.

     Patrick Beauvillard:
     Sheeken? What Sheeken?

     Sacha Mateescu:
     A chicken resource of that particular skillset was needed on
     the other side of the road.

     Andersen Consultant:
     Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was threatening
     its dominant market position. The chicken was faced with
     significant challenges to create and develop the competencies
     required for the newly competitive market.  Andersen
     Consulting, in a partnering relationship with the client,
     helped the chicken by rethinking its physical distribution
     strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry
     Integration Model (PIM) Andersen helped the chicken use its
     skills, methodologies, knowledge capital and experiences to
     align the chicken's people, processes and technology in support
     of its overall strategy within a Program Management framework.
     FIDONEWS 14-06               Page 34                  10 Feb 1997


     Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road
     analysts and best chickens along with Andersen consultants with
     deep skills in the transportation industry to engage in a
     two-day itinerary of meetings in order to leverage their
     personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit, and to
     enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve
     the implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting
     and implementing an enterprise-wide value framework across the
     continuum of poultry cross-median processes.  The meeting was
     held in a park like setting enabling and creating an impactful
     environment which was strategically based, industry-focused,
     and built upon a consistent, clear, and unified market message
     and aligned with the chicken's mission, vision, and core
     values. This was conducive towards the creation of a total
     business integration solution. Andersen Consulting helped the
     chicken change to become more successful.
