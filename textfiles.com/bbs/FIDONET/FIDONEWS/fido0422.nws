     This  should  be  an interesting issue.  Most of you are probably
     aware of the current controversy surrounding the creation and use
     of the EchoChop utility by yours truly.

     In this issue we have a pair of  articles  about  EchoChop.  One,
     written  by  myself,  argues  against it.  The other,  written by
     David Garrett (a noted opponent of EchoChop),  argues in favor of
     it.  At best this will be illuminating, and at worst it may serve
     to illustrate that no issue ever truly resolves itself into black
     and white, but only into shades of grey.

     For,  opposed  as  we  are,  we  both  do  realize that there are
     multiple sides to the issue.  While we  have  come  to  different
     conclusions,  both  of  us  are quite capable of appreciating the
     other  side.  I personally feel that no one is able to rationally
     resolve any question unless that person is able to  see  it  from
     more than one viewpoint.  Remember, your opponent never thinks of
     himself as wrong.

                          Echomail Censorship: Con


     Censorship of echomail is a dangerous and  deadly  precedent.  By
     and  large  FidoNet  operates  on  trust,  and trust is a fragile
     thing.  If it is abused,  then our entire  network  can  fall  to
     pieces about our ears.

     Echomail  already carries about it a strong scent of anarchy.  No
     one really knows what conferences exist and who carries them  (in
     spite  of  the  valiant efforts of Tom Kenney to track them).  By
     its very nature echomail is not subject to any  sort  of  central
     control,  which  is  one  of its greatest strengths.  But if this
     anarchy is carried to extremes, if any given sysop along the path
     is allowed unlimited discretion regarding echomail content,  then
     the entire structure becomes anarchical to the point of collapse.
     It  only works,  when it does work,  because those who promote it
     have dedicated themselves to a higher purpose.

     Just as the various  coordinators  of  FidoNet  mail  in  general
     concern  themselves  only  with  the movement of messages and not
     their content, so have the various nodes of the echomail backbone
     dedicated themselves to the broadcast of messages without  regard
     to content.  Theirs is not to judge,  but to distribute.  This is
     the burden they knowingly accepted, and this burden they are free
     to lay down at any time if they are less than willing to abide by
     all of the consequences.

     One of the basic tenets of FidoNet is that any sysop is  free  to
     do  pretty much as he or she wishes on his or her own board,  but
     that no sysop may dictate  to  any  other  sysop.  Censorship  of
     echomail is contrary to this ethic.

     We are not children here.  There is no need for any "Big Brother"
     to dictate tastes and choices to sysops at large.  All sysops are
     presumed  able to make their own decisions.  They should be given
     the opportunity to do so.

     David Garrett, 103/504

                          Echomail Censorship: Pro

     Regulation of echomail content is long overdue.  Those opposed to
     echomail regulation base their opposition on one of three primary
     arguments,  namely,  censorship,  violation of trust, or that the
     time is not right to open this "can of  worms".  These  arguments
     must  be  evaluated against Fidonet's controlling philosophy that
     all sysops have the right to control their own board so  long  as
     it  does  not  adversely  effect  other  sysops.  It  is becoming
     obvious that echomail must be cleansed of the defamatory messages
     which so frequently consume our time and disk space.

     When the arguments against echomail censorship  are  stripped  of
     their  emotional  appeal,  then  these arguments become much less
     persuasive.  An objective evaluation of the  competing  interests
     involved  leads  to  the  an  obvious  conclusion  in  support of
     echomail censorship.

     At the very heart of this hobby, for most of us, is the desire to
     run our own independent  Bulletin  Board  over  which  the  Sysop
     reigns  supreme.  Sysops  defiantly maintain the right to control
     the nature of the files and messages on their individual  boards.
     Should  a  sysop  not  wish  to  receive  echomail  on particular
     subjects or from particular individuals,  he is  entirely  within
     his  rights  to  do  so.  If  a  node wishes to receive an edited
     version of an echomail area then this is  also  well  within  the
     sysop's  rights  so  long  as he can find an echo feed which will
     accommodate him.  Conversely,  should an unadulterated version be
     desired then the sysop is under no compulsion to receive echomail
     from  any  particular  source  and  is  free  to find a link that
     satisfies his own  desires.  Echomail  censorship  (echochop)  is
     consistent  with this philosophy.  As Sysops we have the right to
     decide what to receive  and  what  expenses  to  incur.  A  sysop
     should  not be required to receive echomail that he does not want
     nor should he be required to incur costs  in  obtaining  echomail
     that  he  has  no  desire  to  read and which will be immediately
     deleted.

     It has become apparent that there is an extreme need to  be  able
     to in someway limit the number of defamatory messages which often
     consume  the echomail areas.  These messages act like a cancerous
     growth in the echomail areas quickly choking  out  the  enjoyment
     that  we  all seek to gain by participation in echomail.  Initial
     attempts at ignoring the offending messages as well  as  requests
     to  stop  entering  them  have  been  futile.  The  situation has
     reached  the   point   where   numerous   sysops   have   stopped
     participating in echomail altogether as a result of the offensive
     character  of  certain  echomail  areas.  Obviously,  when things
     deteriorate to the point that participation is  discouraged  then
     something  must be done.  Echochop is an acceptable solution.  It
     does not go so far as to completely censor  the  offending  nodes
     but  rather  merely  seeks  to  reach an acceptable middle ground
     where those sysops that have been driven from the area can  still
     feel   free  to  participate  without  risking  the  exposure  to
     FidoNews 4-22                Page 4                    8 Jun 1987


     offensive  material.  As  such  echochop  seeks  to  protect  the
     interests  of  all individuals since it gives an option as to the
     content of the messages received.

     In evaluating the allegation that  echomail  violates  the  trust
     upon  which  Fidonet  is  based,  it is obvious that there exists
     different levels of  "trust"  within  Fidonet.  In  this  writers
     opinion, "trust" as it relates to echomail is much different than
     "trust"  as it relates to netmail.  In the case of netmail,  both
     the sender and  recipient  trust  the  nodes  in  the  stream  of
     distribution to not delete the mail.  However, echomail is a much
     different   form   of   communication   and   should  be  treated
     differently.  Echomail is  primarily  an  open  discussion  forum
     where   the   intent  to  communicate  with  any  one  particular
     individual is not as critical as participating in the  discussion
     with  the  group  as  a  whole.  As such,  the sender of echomail
     generally  is  not  that  concerned  that  the  mail  reach   any
     particular  recipient  and hence does not place the same level of
     trust on the delivery process.  With regards  to  the  recipient,
     there  exists an element of trust with the feed that recipient is
     receiving and an unadulterated version of the  conference.  Where
     as  in  the case of net 107,  the filtering is occurring with the
     knowledge and consent of the recipient then  this  trust  is  not
     being  violated.  As  such  echochop  does  not  violate anyone's
     "trust" in the echomail system.

     The allegation of censorship is simply without merit.  Censorship
     does not occur merely by creating two conferences from one.  This
     is particularly true where both conferences are made available to
     all recipients.  This situation is analogous to television  where
     one  has  the  ability  to  selectively  view  desired  programs.
     Additionally,  since there is not any effect on  the  ability  to
     process  replies the net result is that there is not an effect of
     censorship on the echomail area.

     With regards to not opening the "can of  worms"  at  the  present
     time,  it  becomes  obvious  that this argument looses its appeal
     under careful consideration.  With  the  continual  rise  in  the
     number of nodes in Fidonet it is much better to deal with growing
     pains such as the current censorship issue at the present time as
     opposed  to later when the number of nodes has risen to the point
     of where there is no possibility of reaching a consensus.

     One must also keep in mind the fact that  the  only  real  effect
     that  the  filtering  of  the  sysop  area  has  is to change the
     location of where the messages are removed from a given  echomail
     conference.  Obviously,  if  a  downstream  node does not wish to
     read any messages from another individual then he  won't  do  so.
     By allowing the offensive messages to be segregated upstream then
     a  more cost effective allocation of resources occurs in that the
     downstream node does not  have  to  receive  mail  that  will  be
     deleted anyway.  This does not adversely effect the sender of the
     message since it would not have been read anyway.

     In  conclusion,  Echochop  (censorship)  appears  to be the least
     restrictive method of protecting  the  interests  of  the  sysops

     participating  in  echomail.  It  does not violate anyone's trust
     but rather allows sysops  to  be  selective  as  to  the  message
     content of their message areas.

          The day "full  compatibility"  became  a  myth!  The  MS-DOS
     standard  is  still intact,  but IBM has joined the rest of us in
     being  not  quite  hardware  compatible.   Actually,   they  made
     themselves a lot less compatible than many of us have been.

          The Model 30,  IBM's new "low-end" product still uses PC and
     XT compatible expansion boards,  but that's about where it stops.
     Our understanding is that most monitors won't work (the PC and XT
     used digital monitors while  all  the  new  products  use  analog
     units).  Previous  units  used 5-1/4" drives,  while the Model 30
     (and the Convertible) use 760Kb 3-1/2" units... and the remainder
     of the new models use 1.44Mb 3- 1/2" drives!

          Remember the Tandy 1000 and  2000  "non-standard"  keyboards
     with  12  function  keys  across the top (IBM had ten keys on the
     left end of the keyboard) and our separate cursor keypad??? Guess
     what.  IBM now supplies their  Enhanced  Keyboard  on  all  units
     with...  yep,  twelve function keys across the top and a separate
     cursor keypad.

          So, the bottom line is that IBM currently has at least three
     hardware  configurations  which  are  not   compatible...   their
     original   PC,   XT,   and  AT...   the  new  Model  30  and  the
     convertible... and the new Models 50, 60, and 80.

          IBM is offering improved graphics on  all  models,  but  the
     Model  30 is a subset of what's available on the 50,  60,  and 80
     series.  Product literature I've seen indicates that if you  want
     the new graphics on your PC or XT (or compatible),  IBM will have
     an expansion board.

                            RAINBOWFEST CHICAGO

          April 11 and 12 at the Hyatt Regency  Woodfield,  were  wild
     days  for  CoCo enthusiasts!  One hears about devoted Apple fans,
     Commodore devotees  and  others,  but  I've  never  seen  a  more
     enthusiastic and dedicated group of computer buffs anywhere. Fran
     McGehee  (who  is responsible for PR on our Color Computer) and I
     flew to Chicago for  the  show.  We  shared  the  hotel  courtesy
     shuttle  from  the  airport with a doctor from South Carolina who
     had flown in for the show.  He owned one of the  original  silver
     CoCos.

          I  saw our doctor friend several more times during the show.
     As of our last meeting,  he hadn't succumbed to the temptation to
     pick up a new CoCo 3,  but CoCo 2s,  3s,  monitors,  software and
     accessories were being carried out of the place in what at  times
     looked like a bucket brigade.

          When the room became almost too crowded to move in, I looked

     at  the  registration line outside the door,  and it was still at
     least three abreast around the corner,  a hundred or so feet down
     the  hall.  A  new  addition  this year,  was CoCo Cat in person,
     greeting show attendees.

          At the CoCo Community Breakfast  on  Saturday  morning,  the
     room was packed.  Dr. Marty Goodman gave a very entertaining talk
     on how he happened to get into the Color Computer  business,  and
     on the history (or rumored history) of the Color Computer.

          All  in  all,  it was a great show,  and Lonnie Falk and his
     crew are to be complimented on an outstanding effort.

                           ONE THOUSAND MAGAZINE

          There's a new Tandy-specific magazine  that  I  don't  think
     I've  told you about.  It is devoted exclusively to owners of the
     Tandy 1000 family of computers.  It's called "One Thousand",  and
     it's published by Jeff Thurston and Michael Sakacsi. They've been
     around for about a year now,  and report their intention to go on
     newsstands soon.

          The 58-page April issue made the offer  to  sendsubscription
     information  and  a  sample  issue  to  any  Tandy 1000 owner who
     requests it.  The address is Thursak Publishing, Inc., 2153 Muren

                              READER RESPONSE

          Robert Sullivan, president of the New England Coconuts club,
     recently sent some requests and suggestions that I would like  to
     address.

          Mr.   Sullivan  complemented  us  on  information  like  the
     software compatibility data in the January '87  issue.  He  hopes
     that  type  of  information  will  be  made  available to stores.
     Actually,  I took it from a monthly memo to the stores issued  by
     our computer merchandising department, so es, they have it.

          He  feels  that  I  may have spent too much time recently on
     industry issues like the errors in PC Magazine's  review  of  the
     1000 EX and SX.  He suggests that the magazine's "letters" column
     is  the  appropriate  place  for that type of response.  That's a
     valid point.  I did write.  I had  dinner  with  PC  editor  Bill
     Machrone  and  executive  editors Paul Sommerson and Bill Howard,
     just three nights ago in New York,  and he  tells  me  my  letter
     should appear very shortly.

          The  reason  I have also addressed some of those issues here
     is that  every  time  something  like  that  happens,  I  receive
     anywhere  from  2  or  3  to more than a dozen letters from Tandy
     owners,  calling it to my attention and saying they hope we  will
     register  a strong objection.  My interpretation of those letters
     was that Tandy owners take real pride  in  their  computers,  and
     want  to  know  that  we make a strong effort to refute published

     misinformation.  It's all part of the "behind  the  scenes"  non-
     technical  information we hoped to provide by this newsletter.  I
     would  welcome  other  comments,   since  I  want  to  keep  this
     publication valuable to you.

          Mr.  Sullivan  asked  for an overview of what happens with a
     software product between the time a developer gives it to us  and
     the time it reaches the stores for sale. I'll provide that below.

          He  was especially interested in the story behind OS-9 Level
     II.  He asks why, at Princeton Rainbowfest last Fall,  developers
     were using OS-9 Lv II, before most of you could even get CoCo 3s.

          Simple...  early  versions  of  the  CoCo 3 were supplied to
     applications developers,  along with early copies of OS-9 Lv  II,
     to  encourage  them to begin development of applications programs
     using OS-9 Lv II.  Unfortunately,  early  hardware  and  software
     isn't  always  "bug  free",  and so developers' ability to get an
     early start can be hampered until "final"  versions  reach  them.
     Those early versions are what you saw at Rainbowfest.

          He  also  asks  what  is  and  is not allowed in Radio Shack
     stores and Plus  Computer  Centers  in  relation  to  Tandy  User
     Groups.  The  answer  is  we allow our stores to post notices for
     Tandy-specific clubs,  listing the  club  name,  contact  person,
     along with times,  dates and places of regular meetings.  In most
     stores,  we can post a single  letter-size  leaflet,  but  please
     don't ask us to distribute a quantity of leaflets or newsletters.
     Stores are not allowed to offer their location for meetings,  due
     to insurance restrictions.

                            SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

          It's been quite a while since I've written about this issue,
     and Mr.  Sullivan's question reminded me that it's probably  time
     to  do  it  again.  We've  learned  a lot in our ten years in the
     computer business,  so the problem isn't of the magnitude it  was
     even  5  or  6  years ago.  But when delays happen,  it's a major
     irritation to those of you who are waiting for a product.  Here's
     a simplified overview of what happens to a new software product.

          I  think  most  of  you  know that now,  Tandy relies almost
     entirely  on  third-party,  name-brand  software  suppliers.   We
     develop (in house) only three applications products...  Scripsit,
     Quartet, and DeskMate.

          The  question  specifically related to third-party software.
     First  of  all,  we  have  to  divide  those  products  into  two
     categories. Number one is "strategic" software...  those items we
     sell in our stores.  Second is "express order" software, which is
     not stocked,  but is electronically special ordered for you,  and
     normally shipped to your store within 24 hours.

          Most  new  software  enters  our catalog through the express
     order system.  When we decide to carry an item,  it is tested  by
     our quality assurance people, but not to the extent a "strategic"
     FidoNews 4-22                Page 10                   8 Jun 1987


     product  is.  Since  the  original intent of express order was to
     offer  market-proven  programs,   those  products  have   already
     achieved  a  high  degree  of  market acceptance by the time they
     reach us.  We don't feel it's necessary to go over them  in  such
     great detail.  Express order products are supported by the author
     or publisher.  "EOS" products generally reach the market quickly,
     unless our testing uncovers a serious defect or problem.

          Strategic products... like OS-9 Lv II... are another matter.
     When the vendor delivers to us,  the work has just begun.  It  is
     not  unusual for the software to undergo several hundred hours of
     exhaustive  testing.   Our  software  engineers  have  to  become
     thoroughly   familiar   with   it.   Vendors  make  the  required
     corrections, retest,  and return the package so we can resume our
     testing.  Fixing  one  software  problem  has been known to cause
     others.  The  test  and  correct  process  goes  on  until  we're
     comfortable  with  the  product's  performance.   hat's  the  way
     software is developed.

          Editors go over the manuals to try to make  them  as  easily
     understandable as possible, often making extensive changes.  Once
     the manual is edited, it goes out for typesetting.  That can take
     weeks  on  an  extensive  manual.   The  typeset  pages  must  be
     proofread,  and corrections made.  Then printing can take several
     weeks.  Disks must be mastered,  and the masters retested, before
     mass production can be started.

          When manuals are printed and master disks  are  approved,  a
     few sample packages are assembled for final approval,  and almost
     immediately production  begins.  When  the  plant  ships  to  our
     warehouses  our incoming Quality Assurance personnel must inspect
     and approve the packages.  Then they go into warehouse inventory,
     available  for  shipment  to  stores.  Depending  on  how initial
     distribution is planned,  the time from warehouse stock to  store
     shelves is 1 to 3 weeks, including shipping.

          It sounds complex, and it is.  We'd like nothing better than
     to build and ship, without delays,  but we can't do it and supply
     a quality product.

          If  all our plans went like clockwork,  you wouldn't see the
     delays.  If it took two years to bring  the  product  to  market,
     you'd simply see the ads when it was ready, and walk into a store
     and  take a copy home.  We try to plan it that way.  Magazine and
     newspaper ads are not normally placed until  product  is  in  the
     warehouse.  Sometimes,  ongoing  testing uncovers a problem after
     that time, and we suspend shipments until it's fixed.

          Catalogs are another matter. They have very long lead times.
     Our August catalog is committed  in  April.  If  we  aren't  very
     confident of delivery, we don't include the product.  But if only
     one new product out of 2 dozen is delayed,  you and we forget the
     twenty-three that went according to plan,  and that one becomes a
     major problem to us all.  We just aren't  willing  to  deliver  a
     product with a known problem, in order to make a deadline.

          Specifically,  in  the case of OS-9 Lv II,  remember that it
     took 3 years to develop  OS-9.  With  Tandy's  backing,  the  new
     windowing  system  included  in  Lv II was developed in about one
     year. My software gurus tell me that the windowing portion of OS-
     9 Lv II is actually more code than OS-9 itself,  and  the  Lv  II
     manual is 1,200 pages!

          If   you   haven't  been  intimately  involved  in  software
     development,  it's hard to fathom the procedure.  The bottom line
     is  that  Tandy tries very hard to produce quality software.  Our
     normal policy is not to announce products until you can walk  out
     of  a  store  with  them.  If in a specific instance that doesn't
     happen, you can be assured of two things.  One,  there was a good
     reason;  and two,  a lot of folks are under considerable pressure
     to correct the situation.

          Thanks,  Mr.  Sullivan,  for providing several subjects that
     should be of considerably widespread interest.

                          TIP TO HARD CARD OWNERS

          Our  technical  support  people  have  found that there is a
     significant possibility of damage to your system if you transport
     it with a 20Mb hard disk card installed. We strongly suggest that
     if you ship or  transport  it,  you  emove  the  card  first.  We
     recommend you save the hard card carton, in case you have to ship
     it anywhere at a later date.

          See you next month.

          Well, I  seem to  have gotten  past the thirteenth column in
     one piece. I finally had some time this past week to take  a look
     over some  of the  stuff that  had been building up in my pile of
     "things that I should look at  real  soon  now."  While  this may
     sound great, I didn't have the time to do any in depth testing of
     any of the products.  I  plan  to  keep  exercising  most  of the
     programs  and  will  keep  you  updated  on  anything  new I find
     out. First up is Dennis Baer's Structured Programming Language.

     -- The Structure Programming Language (Pledge of $50-$100) --

          SPL is not currently meant to  be a  stand alone programming
     language. It works with a BASIC interpreter or compiler. While it
     resembles Pascal, it has  many  of  the  functions  you  may have
     become  accustomed  to  in  BASIC. Overall I'm not that impressed
     with it and don't  think I'll  be using  it much.  I do  think it
     could have  a great  use as  a preprocessor  for a BASIC compiler
     (or even an interpreter).  If more  people started  off using SPL
     instead  of  straight  BASIC,  it  would  help  avoid some of the
     problems I've seen with  a few  self-taught programmers.  I don't
     mean to  downplay BASIC,  I've used it myself. The problem is too
     many people place too much importance on it. I've run  into quite
     a few  "programmers" who  have had  severe problems  in trying to
     learn any new languages or write what I would consider acceptable
     code (and  I'm not that picky) because of the bad habits they had
     picked up from BASIC. I think SPL could  help stop  some of these
     problems. Anyway, enough of my preaching.

          Since  SPL  translates  its'  code  into  BASIC,  just about
     everyone should be able  to run  it (most  people have  BASIC for
     their  MS-DOS  machines  compliments  of Microsoft). The language
     itself is structured enough to meet with my approval, although it
     could use  better support  on nesting (it currently has a maximum
     of 10 nested statements)  and recursion.  Procedures are declared
     pretty much as they are in Pascal, so I felt right at home. While
     there wasn't that many different variable types allowed,  I found
     them adequate  for simple  use (real, integer, string, and arrays
     of all types). I would have liked to seen data structures as well
     (it would have been a nice addition to the regular BASIC variable
     types), hopefully the next release will  have them.  The language
     isn't that  bad, my  only real  complaint is  that its' generated
     code runs so slow under GW-BASIC. This could probably be improved
     by  using  a  BASIC  compiler,  but  I  haven't  gotten around to
     purchasing one yet. I'd recommend it to someone just learning how
     to program.  The extra steps involved in running a program should
     also help to acquaint a person with the real world  (text editor,
     compiler, source level debugger, etc.). Since SPL has many of the
     FidoNews 4-22                Page 13                   8 Jun 1987


     functions in BASIC, you get the  flexibility of  BASIC (even full
     screen functions) without picking up many of BASIC's "bad habits"
     (GOTOs, needing line number, etc.).

     -- MacPaint pictures, READMAC, and more --

          When the Apple Macintosh  was first  introduced, many  of us
     cringed at  the included drawing program (MacPaint). Not only was
     it very easy to impress  your  friends  with  the  then beautiful
     pictures, it  was easy  to use.  In short  order scanners for the
     Macintosh were feeding their output into MacPaint. This left many
     of us  PC users feeling mean and nasty (I remember when PC owners
     snarled at the  mention  of  the  Macintosh).  There  weren't any
     inexpensive mice  or drawing programs for the PC and even if they
     appeared overnight on the marketplace, the Mac people still had a
     jump on us. The PC world did respond, and you can now get quality
     mice for a PC for about $100. Many of the mice even come packaged
     with a  paint program  and/or mice menu software. The problem was
     there still wasn't any way to bring the MacPaint pictures over to
     our PCs (and help us PC users catch up quick).

          These problems  were overcome over a year ago with a program
     called READMAC. It allowed  an  IBM  PC  with  a  CGA  adapter to
     display and print a MacPaint format picture. In short order there
     were READMAC programs for  Hercules monochrome  adapters (the EGA
     adapters would  have worked with the original READMAC). I've seen
     programs to convert a MacPaint picture to a PC Paint  Plus format
     picture,  but  not  in  the  Public Domain. The program I saw was
     copyrighted by MicroTex (who makes many  of the  scanners for PCs
     and  Macs).  If  anyone  has  a  public  domain  equivalent,  I'd
     appreciate it if you could pass the news of it onto me (and where
     I can  file request  it). The  part I  like is  that a conversion
     program would allow me  to  bring  these  scanned  images  into a
     DeskTop Publishing System like Ventura Publisher.

          While  this  may  not  sound  like  much,  I've seen several
     hundred scanned (or drawn) MacPaint pictures.  Everything from an
     Escher  style  print  to  Clint  Eastwood as Dirty Harry. In many
     instances I don't need to find (or buy)  a scanner.  I can merely
     dig up  the MacPaint  picture that has already been scanned. This
     could be a big boom for  us  Bulletin  Boards  as  many companies
     would start  taking us  seriously. After all, when you've got the
     files that they're looking for, they will take you seriously!

          The original idea of  READMAC has  already been  copied many
     times. I've  come across a very quick READMAC type program for an
     EGA card. It has many features that could not be implemented on a
     CGA  card  (or  herc  card  for  that  matter) and only lacks the
     ability to print the picture. The program is called EGAMAC and is
     from Large  Scale Computing  (the suggested  contribution is $5).
     First off this is the fastest MacPaint reader I've ever seen, and
     speed means a lot to me as I do not have a 10 mhz AT. The program
     uses the high resolution modes of an EGA adapter and displays the
     picture  without  ANY  distortion  (as  far  as  I  can tell). In
     addition it allows you to look at the inverse of  the picture and
     allows you  to set the background color. If this wasn't enough it
     FidoNews 4-22                Page 14                   8 Jun 1987


     also allows  you  to  change  to  pictures  characteristics. This
     doesn't mean  that you  can change the picture, it just means the
     colors used. You can shade it with any  of 3  different levels on
     Red,  Green,  and  Blue.  This  was  very convenient for me, as I
     didn't enjoy looking at everything in black and white. Of course,
     it does  invite some patented weirdness when trying it out, but I
     found it a nice change of pace from  being serious.  I'd heartily
     recommend  anyone  with  an  EGA  system to take a look over this
     software and send in at least a ten dollar contribution. Software
     of  this  quality  is  getting  hard  to  find and we all need to
     support those few people still writing it!

     -- Winding Down --

          I just came across an update  to Hack  (I had  3.5 and found
     3.6) and  have been  busy looking  for changes.  I haven't really
     noticed any differences, but  they might  have been  at the lower
     levels. I  have yet  to get  past the  tenth level, but I'm still
     working at it. Since I  was  "busy"  looking  over  this "update"
     (I've been  told 3.6  has been  out for  awhile) I  didn't have a
     chance to look over  any of  the newer  games sitting  around (as
     opposed to  an update  of an  older game).  I still like Hack and
     think it is one of the better Public  Domain games  available for
     PCs. Since it has no graphics it should run on any system with an
     ANSI.SYS driver (DEC Rainbows have it built into the machine). In
     case you  missed my  comments on  awhile back, it's a Dungeon and
     Dragons type program. You attempt to recover the Amulet of Yendor
     out of  a Dungeon, you start off with a trusty companion (a small
     dog, who does grow) and  the  minimal  amount  of  provisions and
     equipment. Along  the way  you'll find deadly monsters, "playful"
     sprites, and a few shop keepers.

          The best book I've come across is "Assembly  Language Primer
     for the  IBM PC  & XT"  by Robert Lafore of The Waite Group (list
     price $24.95). It is  a beginning  book on  assembly language for
     our beloved  PCs. I had bought the Microsoft Macro Assembler some
     weeks ago for a program that had come  across Usenet.  Part of it
     was in assembler, and I really wanted to have it running. Since I
     had bought the assembler,  I  finally  decided  to  learn  how to
     program in assembly language. This book has taught me a lot about
     8088 assembly language and seems to  cover the  necessary topics.
     You  can  enter  all  of  the  sample  programs through the DEBUG
     program included with MS-DOS, so don't worry if you don't  own an
     assembler. Robert Lafore has a wonderful writing style that works
     well with what would otherwise be  a dry  subject. Throughout the
     book you  find subtle  humor to  help carry you through the tough
     subjects introduced. I won't go into  assembly language  here, as
     I've found  it is a tough subject (for me at least). This book is
     one of most well  written computer  texts I've  ever come across.
     Even  if  you  aren't  interested  in  assembly language, I would
     recommend buying this book in order  to have  a good  standard of
     what computer books SHOULD be like.

          This paragraph  is for  an unknown  individual who sent me a
     package with no return  address.  The  enclosed  note  was signed
     "Ender Wiggin." Well Ender, how about letting me know who you are
     FidoNews 4-22                Page 15                   8 Jun 1987


     (and what's with the "four fighter  starship?"). I'm  hoping this
     will drag  my shy  friend out of the woodwork. If you know who he
     or she is, please drop me a line as I am getting VERY curious!

          That ties it up for this  week. I'll  get around  to some of
     the other  programs that  have been piling up next week. As it is
     this may get into Thom a little late (please excuse any errors as
     I  was  rushed).  I  encourage  you to write to me (electronic or
     otherwise) and  let me  know you  views on  anything I've written
     about (or  something you  think I  should). Below  you'll find my
     FidoNet address, Usenet address,  and US  Mail address.  I try to
     answer  all  the  mail  that  I  receive.  People sending me mail
     through FidoNet should route my mail through 157/0  or 157/1 (I'm
     a private node in the matrix).

     These  ballots  will  be counted by myself since with 200 members
     the charges for a CPA would be very high.  Hard  copies  will  be
     made  available  to  anyone wishing to insure that their vote was
     included.
