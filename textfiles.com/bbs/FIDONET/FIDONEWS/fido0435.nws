     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                          What's IFNA Done for Me?


     IFNA  (the  International  FidoNet  Association)  has   been   in
     existance  for  over  a  year  now.  In  that  time,  what has it
     accomplished that's worth anything?  Offhand it doesn't look like
     much has happened.  Oh, there's been lots of talk about what IFNA
     could do someday, or what it might do if we want, but what has it
     actually done so far?  Not much, by all appearances.


     But there's more than meets the eye.  Here are  few  things  that
     IFNA does for us right now:

      1) Non-profit  status.  This  was  the  main impetus for forming
         IFNA in the first place.  People sent in money to  help  with
         the  expenses,  but  it  showed up on Ken Kaplan's income tax
         return as extra income, and the expenses were not deductible.
         Yes,  I know that our tax-exempt status has not been approved
         yet, but in the meanwhile we have a sort of "provisional" tax
         exempt status,  until the IRS makes up its mind.  (This could
         actually work against Ken if the IRS turns us down.  The  IRS
         has  a nasty habit of deciding that it never was exempt after
         all,  and  then  demanding  back  taxes  with  penalties  and
         interest.)

      2) Limited  liability  on  nodelist  compilation.  This  is more
         important than it sounds.  Suppose someone sends  in  a  node
         list  update  that has someone's voice number in it?  Before,
         the guy who publishes the list (first Tom Jennings, later Ken
         Kaplan,  and now Ben Baker) could have been  held  personally
         liable  for  damages.  Now  it's  IFNA  that bears the brunt.
         IFNA could possibly be destroyed by such a  lawsuit,  but  at
         least Ben won't loose his house.

      3) Limited  liability on FidoNews.  This one is near and dear to
         my heart.  I don't always have time to look over the articles
         before they are published,  so it's  not  that  unlikely  for
         something  legally  actionable to slip through.  Twice that I
         know of someone sent in an article that contained copyrighted
         material.  One I caught in time,  the other slipped  through.
         Then  there's always the possibility that a submitted article
         could result in  a  lawsuit  for  libel.  I  like  publishing
         FidoNews,  but if you don't mind I'd really rather not put my
         own neck on a chopping block.

      4) Accountability.  This is probably the single  most  important
         thing  that  IFNA  does for sysops.  Prior to IFNA becoming a
         membership organization,  there was  no  accountability.  The
         people  at the top could do whatever they wanted,  and nobody
         had anything to  say  about  it.  But  now  IFNA  provides  a
         structure  where  the  people  at  the  very top are directly
     FidoNews 4-35                Page 2                   14 Sep 1987


         accountable to the sysops.

      5) Orderly changes in management.  This especially is  something
         that is not readily apparent,  but is quite important.  There
         never used to be any mechanism for the people at the  top  to
         be  replaced  in an orderly fashion.  Now there is,  and it's
         even happened.  Ken  Kaplan  used  to  be  the  International
         Coordinator  and  the  President  of  IFNA.  One of the first
         things the  new  board  did  was  to  replace  him  in  those
         positions, making Ben Baker the International Coordinator and
         Don Daniels the President of IFNA.

     So  what  has  IFNA  done  for me lately?  A few things.  Nothing
     flashy, nothing broad and obvious,  just a few things that really
     needed to be done.

             Need Volunteers For Membership Services Committee
             -------------------------------------------------
                          Phil Ardussi    1:157/1


          IFNA  By  Laws  state,  "The  Membership  Services Committee
     performs studies and  makes  recommendations  to  the  Board, and
     acts  as  advisor  to  the  President,    with regard to services
     provided to individual  members,  other  than    publications and
     including, but not limited to the ANNUAL MEETING."

          We will need several sub committees.  One of them is to make
     recommendations to the Board of Directors no later  than 12/31/87
     on the  site(s) for the next FidoCon.

          Another   subcommittee,   already   established,   will   be
     responsible for keeping  the membership  roster.   This important
     job will be done by Norm Henke,  157/200.

          Moreover,  I  believe  we  should  also  be  responsible and
     accountable for the  distribution of software sold  in connection
     with IFNA membership.

          Other  areas  will  probably include membership development,
     membership  communications, and  other jobs  which might  come to
     your mind as you read  this and think about our responsibility.

          I need  to hear from you no later than 9/9/87 if you wish to
     serve.  If your  response  is positive,  please at  the same time
     set up an EchoMail conference  for your board only called MEMSER.
     We will use that for communicating  and    I  will  serve  as the
     center of the star topology.

          Suggestions,   comments,   anyone?    Volunteers  gratefully
     accepted.

                          FCC ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE

     The threat to FidoNet of additional access charges to value added
     carriers as proposed by the FCC in Docket No.  87-215 is real.  A
     large  number  of  us  use such services as GTE's PC Pursuit.  An
     additional $5.00 an hour charge there will price it  out  of  the
     range of most FidoNet sysops.

     What  can  we do about this threat?  There is the usual method of
     writing letters to the FCC Commissioners, as well as Senators and
     Representatives.  A better solution exists.  Let's use the  tools
     of  FidoNet  itself to fight our battle.  On the COSUG BBS system
     (128/13),  we have established  an  FCC  EchoMail  conference  to
     discuss  how the actions of the FCC and other regulatory agencies
     affect the world of data communications.

     Any  node  may  participate  in  the  conference  as  long as the
     following ground rules are observed:

     1. Keep   the   discussion   topics    on    the    subject    of
        telecommunications regulation.

     2. No  flames or personal attacks will be tolerated.  Discuss the
        issues, not the personalities.

     3. All messages entered into this area will be forwarded  to  the
        FCC  as  well  as  Representatives  and  Senators  involved in
        Telecommunications  policy.  If  you  ask  that  a  particular
        message  not  be  forwarded  to  the  FCC or that your name be
        witheld, that request will be honored.

     4. Any node forwarding this conference to  other  nodes  may  not
        alter  the  contents  of any of the messages.  You can do what
        you want with the area after you have forwarded it.

     We invite all of you  to  participate  in  the  FCC  Echo.  Since
     FidoNet  has  telecommunications  power distributed among all BBS
     sysops and users,  we are a very real threat to the  bureaucratic
     mind  that  wants  to run everything from Washington.  Let's keep
     the power of communication away from centralized  authority,  and
     use our combined effort to defeat the FCC.

     There  are  several nodes around the country already carrying the
     FCC EchoMail Conference,  including some of the  backbone  nodes.
     If  you  are  not  able  to  get the conference from your regular
     EchoMail connection, send a message to me at 128/13 and we'll get
     you connected.

     Gene Coppola
     The Big Gulp, 107/246

              MegaList: A Sysop's Answer To Finding Utilities

     Chris was in one of his more creative moods the other  day;  he's
     finally  written  a  system  that I've wanted for quite some time
     now: MegaList.

     The "MegaList" is an alphabetized file listing that combines  the
     files from ALL PARTICIPATING Fido/Opus systems.

     If  you've ever needed a file,  but didn't know where to find it,
     the MegaList is a good place to look;  scan down the list for the
     file  you  need,  and listed next to it are the BBSs that have it
     online.

     The MegaList is available for download  or  SEAdog  file  request
     from 135/68 or 107/246. The following files are online now:

        MEGALIST.ARC/TXT    The National (unfiltered) MegaList
        MEGA-ARC.ARC/TXT    The National ARChive MegaList
        ML-UPD.ARC          MegaList Update Software (Latest)

     YOUR  system  can be added to the NATIONAL MegaList if you simply
     run the update program,  ML-UPD.  This  program  will  create  an
     update  file  based  on  YOUR  system  information  and FILES.BBS
     contents.  This data is then ARCed and Net-mailed to  135/68  for
     central collection.  The NATIONAL MegaList is updated each day at
     6:15AM and posted for download or file request.

     Placing  your  system  in  the  MegaList will let the rest of the
     world know what's on your system without everyone having to  call
     and  look.  The  ML-UPD  program is easy and only takes about 1-2
     minutes to run.  All you must do is send  a  MegaList  update  to
     Miami  at least once every 45 days,  and you will be in the daily
     MegaList update.

     This software is great for regions and nets as well.  We here  in
     net  107  have started our own Megalist called (FILES107.ARC from
     107/246) which contains all the  latest  software  for  OPUS/Fido
     sysops.  While  this  is  primarily  for  Net 107 Sysops,  we can
     incorporate our files into the national MegaList as well.

     In the case of Net 107,  participating systems send 107/246 there
     updates  who  then  uses  the  ML-COL software to prepare our own
     MegaList.

     I think this is a GREAT concept which should be  put  to  use  by
     every Net and or Region.  Imagine if you,  a complete list of all
     the software on every Fido/Opus system !

     September 5, 1987

     We are trying to collect the facts about the shareware
     phenomenon, so we have written the attached questionnaire.  We
     desperately need to hear from as many shareware authors and
     publishers as we can.

     IF YOU ARE A SHAREWARE AUTHOR OR PUBLISHER, YOU CAN HELP BY
     PRINTING THE ENCLOSED QUESTIONNAIRE TO PAPER AND ANSWERING ALL
     OUR QUESTIONS AND MAILING US THE RESULTS.  WE WILL SEND THE
     TABULATED RESULTS TO ANY ADDRESS YOU REQUEST, AND WE WILL PAY
     THE POSTAGE.

     IF YOU ARE A SHAREWARE USER, YOU CAN HELP BY COPYING THIS FILE
     TO AS MANY BULLETIN BOARDS AS YOU CAN. IF YOU SEND US A STAMPED
     (2 OZ.), ADDRESSED ENVELOPE, WE WILL SEND YOU THE TABULATED
     RESULTS.  MARK THE ENVELOPE "SHAREWARE."

     After we have received the answers to our questions, we will
     send the tabulated results to every shareware author or
     publisher we have heard from, and every shareware user who sends
     us a stamped (assume 2 oz.), addressed envelope.

     We will also offer the results in the FidoNet newsletter, and we
     will encourage circulation on bulletin boards.

     If we have received at least 200 questionnaires by December 15,
     1987, we will use our vacation to tabulate the results and start
     mailing them out.  But it will never be too late to write us.

     As soon as we have collected these facts Jay Mendell will
     tabulate the results and send you or anyone you designate a
     summary copy Later, Dave Georgoff will add material on
     the theory of marketing channels and send our article to
     a scholarly journal in the marketing field.

     So, if you answer our questionnaire, you will very quickly
     receive the direct benefit of comparing yourself with our other
     respondents (this should help you make better business
     decisions), and you will help marketing professors understand
     FidoNews 4-35                Page 7                   14 Sep 1987


     what shareware means to their field.

     A project like this depends on our hearing from as many authors
     and publishers of shareware as possible.  We really do need your
     answers.  Remember, you will soon be reading the tabulated
     answers others have given to these questions.

     Following the ethics of university researchers, We will treat
     the information you give us as strictly confidential.  We will
     never identify you by name or violate your confidences by
     writing about you in a way that might permit others to identify
     you.  In fact, we wil never actually be sure who you are, since
     we are not asking for your own name, just the name and address
     of someone we can mail the tabulated results to.

     Although the questionnaire is long, many of the questions can be
     answered with a checkmark.

     If you want to communicate with us electronically, direct a
     message to JAY MENDELL at FidoNet node 135/6 or jay@ankh.UUCP
     on usenet.  Jay checks his net mail daily.


     PART ONE:  PLEASE TELL US HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME AND MAKE A
     LIVING.

     1.      We want to know if you are involved fulltime or part-
     time in authoring or publishing shareware.  Please tell us how
     you (the principal author or publisher)  divide your time
     between the development of shareware and other income producing
     activities.

     2.      During the last year, what percentage of your income
     came from each of the items below?  These figures should add up

                                Dale Lovell

          I'm going  to use  this first  paragraph to bring my initial
     FidoCon report to a close. Sorry it took  so long,  but I've been
     busy catching up at work for the two days I missed while I was at
     the convention. But, even if it had taken  a month  to get things
     back to  "normal" it  would have  been worth it! For those of you
     who were unable to attend, I know I missed meeting  you. While in
     some ways  this electronic medium is superior to meetings and get
     togethers, being able to  associate  a  face  with  a  name makes
     everything seem  a little bit more real. The electronic medium is
     also missing much that is present  in face-to-face conversations.
     Differences and problems seem to quickly fade once you physically
     meet and talk to someone. For  those of  you I  missed at FidoCon
     and those  who couldn't  make it, I hope to have a chance to meet
     you at next year's FidoCon. Enough with that for now, and on with
     the column.

     -- Fast Forward (Mark Williams Co., List $69.95) --

          In a  past issue  someone else  examined several of the disk
     cache programs available  today.  After  reading  the  article, I
     decided to  start looking  at a  few and  see for myself how well
     they worked.  I'm starting  off with  Fast Forward  because on my
     weekly trip  to my  local dealer,  I came  across it (he had just
     gotten his first shipment in a few days  earlier). While  this is
     not the  most scientific  of methods, it was the most convenient.
     For those of you who missed  the article  on caches  I'll briefly
     describe how  they work. Normally every time you read information
     off a drive; the  program  tells  the  computer  to  go  get this
     information, the  computer proceeds to turn on the drive and move
     the heads to the proper position and read the information off the
     disk. If  a little  while later you go and get the same data, the
     computer follows  the  identical  procedure.  In  many  cases the
     computer has  to get several pieces of information, most programs
     and data  files use  more than  one section  of the  disk and the
     computer then  has to  move the  heads around as it finds all the
     individual parts of a program or  file. Many  FidoNet sysops have
     discovered that  a directory is treated as a file and at 800 plus
     messages being normal in some of  the echomail  conferences (with
     each message  being a  separate file), the directory can become a
     "little" fragmented. Before the  computer can  read a  message it
     has to  search through  the directory and find out where the file
     starts (with the computer taking several  tries just  to find out
     where the  file starts).  The end result with the larger echomail
     conferences is  that  the  disk  drive  starts  to  sound  like a
     drowning cat.

          A cache  is a  memory resident  program that can help remove
     this problem. A cache keeps the most recent disk data  in RAM (in
     FidoNews 4-35                Page 21                  14 Sep 1987


     my case  a little  over the  last 100K of data). When the program
     tells the computer to get this data, a  cache checks  and sees if
     it already  has the  data in  RAM. If it does, there is no delay.
     The computer never deals with the physically slow  drive. Instead
     it merely  retrieves the data out of the cache memory. Most cache
     programs allow you to  control how  much memory  is used  for the
     cache and  you can  "customize" it  for your particular purposes.
     For instance whether you want the floppy drives to be  cached, do
     you want  the program  to use  expanded memory, and of course how
     much RAM to use.

          Fast  Forward  has  done   very  well   in  the  performance
     department.  I  know  it's  cut  at  least  20%  off  my echomail
     processing time (I echo over 25 different conferences  to half of
     my local  net). My only disappointment has been that it can't use
     my  AT  extended  memory,   only  Lotus/Intel/Microsoft  expanded
     memory. It  installed in  minutes just  by copying  the files and
     running an  install program  to tell  it about  my higher logical
     drives (E:).  I also didn't want it caching the floppy drives and
     wanted to use Alt-F  as the  hot key  for the  on-line menu. Fast
     Forward also  gave me  three different options on what to do with
     data being written to  the hard  drive. The  first option  is the
     safest and  it always  writes the data to the hard drive (as well
     as saving it in the cache). Option two was to store everything in
     the cache  until the cache filled up and than dump to the disk. I
     wasn't quite ready to trust  this  option  because  if  there's a
     power  failure  or  a  system  crash,  you literally lose all the
     information that was in the cache. The last option is  a comprise
     between the  two, it  will dump the cache to disk every couple of
     minutes and you control length of time. I was willing to try this
     out and it did work very well. My problem is that I'm not willing
     to trust everything to a cache that wasn't a write  through cache
     (option  1).  I'm  not  sure  what would happen if something went
     wrong before it had a chance to  update  a  FAT  table  or  a new
     directory entry, and I don't want to find out.

          Any sysops  out there  would be  well advised to find a good
     cache program. As echomail traffic increases you'll have more and
     more message  files in every conference. A good cache program can
     save your hard drive a lot of wear and tear. The small investment
     could help  keep an  expensive piece  of equipment working, and I
     know what it feels like to lose a hard drive  (suffice to  say it
     wasn't  a  pretty  sight).  Fast  Forward was more than up to the
     tasks I tried it  on  (echomail  processing,  indexing databases,
     etc.) and I'm very satisfied with it. My only complaints are that
     it  doesn't  use  AT  extended  RAM  and  won't   work  with  RLL
     controllers. Both of these drawbacks are going to be corrected in
     an upcoming version.

     -- The Norton On-Line Programmer's Guides (prices vary) --

          Peter Norton Computing has brought us another great utility.
     This time  it's aimed primarily at programmers, although it could
     be used for a variety  of  purposes.  They're  online  guides for
     languages  and  such.  They're  currently  available  for  BASIC,
     Pascal, C, and Assembler. I purchased  a twin  pack of  the C and
     FidoNews 4-35                Page 22                  14 Sep 1987


     Assembler  guides  and  got  four  disks. One disk was the Norton
     Instant Access program, you'll  find  this  disk  in  all  of the
     packages and can even buy it separately from Norton Computing. My
     other disks included one disk with the Assembler database and two
     more disks  with C databases, one for Microsoft C and another for
     Turbo C. The individual databases are available for $50 (the same
     price as  the Instant Access program). Dealer's are being shipped
     packages which contain the retrieval program and one database and
     there are  two twin  packs like I purchased (C and Assembler, and
     Pascal and Assembler). The guides I've got are very complete. The
     manuals on my shelf are finally being given a rest. The assembler
     guide is more  complete  in  some  ways  than  the  appendices in
     "Advanced MS-DOS"  by Ray Duncan for Bios and DOS function calls.
     In short I'm very impressed with Norton's On-Line Guides.

          There are several options  available to  you in  the Guides.
     Among them  a choice  between a half-screen and full screen mode.
     In the half screen mode the guide will pop-up on  the section the
     cursor isn't,  or if  the cursor's  near the  top then the guides
     will pop up near the bottom.  This helps  to assure  that you can
     work around  the guide.  Hot key selection is another choice that
     I'm glad to see in Norton's Guides. Too many of today's Terminate
     and Stay  Resident programs  don't allow  you to select their hot
     key and as a result you're  forced to  choose between  two useful
     utilities. You're  also able  to select  the database you wish to
     use, so you can keep several  on-line at  any point  in time. The
     database  itself  is  stored  on  your  hard  drive with only the
     retrieval program being resident in  memory.  You  also  have the
     capability  of  creating  your  own  databases  (I'm working on a
     reference for SEAdog so I can  finally  leave  the  manual  on my
     shelf). There's  also a search capability for the database, so if
     you know what something does you  should be  able to  get all the
     information on it.

          The C reference has been useful since I usually remember the
     function, but not the calling procedures.  In addition  to a full
     description of  each function,  you also get a small sample piece
     of code. While most of the descriptions aren't as complete as the
     original C  manuals, it's  been a  lot easier  to keep the Norton
     Guides on-line rather than having  manuals  stacked  all  over my
     desk. The  assembler guides  are also  very nice. While they only
     cover the 8088 instruction  set,  I  haven't  even  mastered 8088
     assembly language yet so it should be some time before I need the
     instruction sets for the 80286  and  80386.  In  addition  to the
     databases  supplied,  you  can  create your own databases. Norton
     Computing makes it relatively  easy to  do by  including the same
     utilities they  used to create the databases. Let me know how you
     feel about that SEAdog reference and I'll let  everyone know when
     it's  done.  Overall  I  am  very impressed with Norton's On-Line
     Guides and heartily recommend it  to  anyone  who  programs (just
     make sure to get the databases for the languages you use).

     -- Winding down... --

          I came  across a good book this past week that actually fits
     in well with the rest of this column. It's "Supercharging  C with
     FidoNews 4-35                Page 23                  14 Sep 1987


     Assembly Language"  by Harry  R. Chesley  and Mitchell Waite (The
     Waite Group/Addison-Wesley, list $22.95). This book can help many
     of you bridge the gap between being a passable C programmer and a
     professional  quality  C/Assembler  programmer.  C  and  Assembly
     language  really  do  fit  together very well and Supercharging C
     helps explain how to  optimize  your  C  programs  using assembly
     language.  Chesley  and  Waite  go  over how to access all of the
     peripherals we so depend  on from  both the  ROM BIOS  and direct
     hardware  manipulation  of  the  devices.   They even "develop" a
     histogram program to help find out where the bottlenecks are in a
     program. Even  if you've  never learned  about assembly language,
     but are  programming in  C for  MS-DOS machines,  read this book.
     After trying  some of  the problems  and exercises in the book, I
     can realize  how  much  I  was  limiting  (and  slowing  down) my
     programs by  using some  generic functions  instead of creating a
     few  well  written,  specific  assembly  functions.  For  those C
     programmer's  out  there  who  are  just  a  little curious about
     assembly  language,  there's  an  appendix  in  the  back  titled
     "Appendix A  C Programmers' Assembly Language Introduction." Just
     what some of my friends are  going to  need, won't  they be happy
     and surprised at me!

          Sorry for  my little  vacation here.  It feels  strange in a
     way, I finally lived up to  the Irregular  part of  the title! As
     always I welcome your comments and suggestions. Below you'll find
     several different addresses for  me.  For  those  of  you sending
     FidoNet Netmail,  all my  inbound mail  has to  be routed through
     157/1 (157/0) as I'm a private node in the nodelist.  Next week's
     column should start catching up on the great stuff I brought back
     from FidoCon as well as a new game.

                 O r i g i n :  A n g e v i n   E m p i r e

                        Issue #2: Users? What Users?
                         Aaron Priven  (1:161/1154)

        Sometimes I feel like I'm living in the movie  TRON.  Remember
     that?  'Programs'  in  the  system  were  told that there weren't
     really any users,  that there was never really  anything  like  a
     user, and not to worry about them.  That reminds me of FidoNet.

        Now, I'm not saying that nobody cares about the users.  But at
     no  level  in  the structure are the users consulted.  There's no
     place for us to get our views heard, except through our sysop(s).
     We're not allowed on the INFA echomail, or the sysop echomail, or
     the private Net echomails.  Now I realize there ought to be  some
     private  sysopy things ("How to Kill a System" comes to mind) but
     *surely* there is no reason why the majority of these conferences
     should be hidden from the ordinary users (unless you're trying to
     conceal the fact that sysops have tempers!).  I myself  have  had
     access  to  many of these areas (thanks to a temporary condition,
     and very nice sysops) and have not once found anything  that  had
     to  remain  secret.  It  was  never once considered that any user
     might have an interesting idea or a  better  way  to  do  things.
     Maybe they won't -- but you could ask, you know?

        And  node-to-node mail -- talk about sysop-only.  I have never
     heard yet of a sysop who  actually  made  an  honest  attempt  to
     figure  the  costs  of  mail  and  attempted  to  deal  with  the
     completely unused 'credit' and 'debit' parts of  Fido/Opus.  Many
     boards  won't even let a user *try* to enter a message -- even to
     send to a local (no-cost) board! (Reasoning for us doing so: lost
     passwords,  "why are you  down".)  And  file  requests  and  file
     attaches?  Don't  even  think  about it!  Enough to make a novice
     weep.

        Users are accorded no place in the scheme of  things.  There's
     not a user-accessible Netinfo Echomail; there's not an IFNA body;
     not  a  drop  of mention in POLICY3.DOC (except that it's none of
     the FidoNet's business what the sysops do locally,  which is  not
     relevant here), nothing.  There's no room for the rest of us.  We
     don't even belong to Fidonet -- we're just the users!

        I  really don't know what to do about it,  since in a material
     sense the network really *does* belong to the  sysops.  And  even
     in other senses,  too:  many of the participants in the echomails
     are sysops,  of course (the Old Frog comes to mind).  But not all
     are.  I'm  not (yet),  for one,  although my participation is not
     all that important (except to me).  I  don't  think  any  of  the
     professional  sf  writers on SF and SFFAN conferences are sysops.
     Most of the professional programmers  in  ECPROG  and  the  other
     programming echomails are not sysops.  There's a lot of users out
     there! Don't lock us out!

        (Another column on a similar subject follows next week.)
