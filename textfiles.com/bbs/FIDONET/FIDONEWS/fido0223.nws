                          User Unsupported Software

        Last week I wrote about the high cost of marketing a 
        software package.  This week I'll write about an 
        alternative.

        You are all familiar with it -- it's called user supported 
        software.  It's more commonly referred to as "freeware", but 
        that name has been trademarked (as has almost every other 
        variant of {something}ware).  But "user supported software" 
        is a clumsy term, so I'll be lazy and call it freeware.

        The freeware concept is an ingenious idea.  The author is 
        able to sell his wares without the immense gamble of a 
        normal commercial offering, and can thus offer quality 
        products at a low cost.  The user benefits from the low 
        costs, and is in addition able to extensively "test drive" a 
        program before purchasing it.  Everyone benefits!

        Well, not quite.  The user benefits from copious quantities 
        of "free" software, and a small handful of authors make a 
        decent buck.  The sad truth is that most freeware vendors 
        receive little if anything for their trouble.

        Let's face it.  If you have a freeware product that you are 
        still using after a couple of weeks, you are out of the 
        "test drive" category.  If you haven't sent in a donation, 
        then you are effectively a software pirate.  The author may 
        say it's okay (since he can't really do anything anyway), 
        but you are still deriving benefits from his work without 
        providing any compensation.

        I see freeware as an attempt to open a new marketing 
        channel.  When viewed that way, a freeware product is no 
        different than a product sold at your local computer store.  
        In either case it is wrong to use the product without paying 
        for it.  The penalties differ, however.

        For stealing a product offered through standard commercial 
        channels you might find yourself being sued by large 
        corporations, though this is unlikely if you are stealing on 
        a small scale.

        But for stealing a freeware product the penalty is much more 
        subtle, and much more severe.  If people use freeware 
        products without paying for them, then the entire freeware 
        concept will cease to be valid.  The good authors will have 
        to go find something else to do (probably working for the 
        large corporations), and low cost quality software will 
        become a thing of the past.  Also no more "test drives"; 
        you'll have to shell out the bucks if you want to try 
        something out.

        So how about it?  You know what you're using that you 
        haven't paid for yet.  Send in the donations, and let's keep 
        the freeware concept alive.

                         A FIDO BBS WITH A MISSION
                                   11/499



        USER :      "I've  been  a  computer  user both at home and
        work  for  several  years now. Recently my vision has begun
        to  fail  and  reading  the  CRT  is  getting more and more
        difficult. Anyone have any suggestions ?"

        SYSOP:      "Yes  there  are  a  few  articles in the rehab
        file  section  that  might  be  of interest to you. You can
        download  these  files  or  just use the T)ype command they
        are  store  in  ASCII. If you don't find an answer here let
        me  know. For about $18.00 we can sign-on through DIALOG or
        BRS  and access the Abledata (National Rehab. Info. Center)
        where  listings  of  over 8000+ commercial products for the
        disabled have been stored."

        USER :      "I  read  your  articles  and  found  some good
        leads will let you know what happens."

        USER :      "Wow  I  just ordered the PC-Talker program and
        a  Vortrax  synthesizer  today.  The  total  solution to my
        problem  ... for under $700.00. The price was so reasonable
        that my employer picked up the tab."


              This  dialog  is an example of what a new BBS forming
        in  South  Bend Indiana is all about. The System is know as
        Care-Net.  Care-Net (Computer Aided REhabilitation NETwork)
        is  a  member  of  FIDO Network #11 Node 499. The system is
        run   by   a  husband  and  wife  team,  Marlin  and  Kathy
        Sheffield.   They   are   not   new  to  rehabilitation  or
        computers.  Kathy  has  been an employee of Council For The
        Retarded  for  the  past  eight  years.  Kathy works at the
        community  sheltered  workshop  known  as Logan Industries.
        Kathy  has  served  as  Work  Adjustment  Supervisor,  Work
        Evaluator,  and  now as Rehabilitation Director. Kathy is a
        member  of the National Association Of Disability Examiners
        and  is  CC-WAVE certified as a work evaluator. Marlin also
        worked  at  the  sheltered  workshop  for  about  4  years;
        currently  he  is the Manager of Information Services for a
        metal  stamping  and fabricating firm. He has been involved
        in   programming   micro-computers   personally  and  as  a
        consultant  for  some  8  years  now.  Perhaps,  as  much a
        motivation  as  any,  is  the  fact  that the couple is the
        rather   proud   foster   parents  of  two  developmentally
        disabled teenagers.

              The  goals  of  the  BBS are described by the systems
        editorial as :

          Care-NET is a non-profit effort to utilize a computerized

          message exchange with the following goals :

            o       A Forum Between Inconvenienced Citizens.

            o       A Tool To Encourage Dialogue Between Consumers
                    Of Rehabilitation Service And The Professionals
                    Providing These Services.

            o       A Medium For Health Care And Rehabilitation
                    Professionals To Share Information, Resources
                    Ideas and Develop Joint or Regional Projects.

            o       A Free Alternative To TTY Services -Private as
                    Well As Public Messaging Is Supported.

            o       A Link To The Rest Of The Telecomputing World.
                    We will maintain a library of public domain 
                    programs available for downloading or uploading
                    by any computer enthusiasts. We will also post
                    your ideas for needed software to aid
                    rehabilitation efforts. Hopefully some of the
                    computer wizards can help contribute to the
                    cause.

              The  sysops  are  willing  and  excited about sharing
        information  with  others  who  are  willing or already are
        running   similar   bulletin  boards.  This  networking  of
        similar  services  was the primary reason for the selection
        of Fido software.

              For  such  an  ambitious  project to succeed regional
        input  is needed. If you have articles to contribute or are
        in  need  of  information  please give Care-Net a call. The
        system  is  on-line from 10PM to 5PM on weekdays (19 hours)
        and  from  10PM  to  9AM  on  weekends.  The Sheffields are
        running  the BBS on their Leading Edge Computer and  single
        phone  line.  They  are looking forward to trying to add an
        additional  phone  line  and  machine  so Care-Net can be a
        twenty-four  hour  a  day  seven  day a week service. (This
        author  is  frankly a little puzzled about how they plan to
        do  this  since the system charges no access fees, does not
        require  or  even  request  subscriptions, and claims to be
        funded  only by free will contributions. I hope their faith
        in  the goodness of the computer community is not aimed too
        high.)  The  system  is a closed but free system and is not
        limited  only  to rehabilitation and social service issues.
        You  are required to log on the system and complete a brief
        questionnaire  before full access to the system is granted.
        Your  status  is upgraded usually within 24 hours. Give the
        Sheffield's  and their project of love 'CARE-NET' a call at
        1-219-233-1261 (300/1200 baud). Or drop them a line or seek
        more information or express your support by writting :

         Fido V10j Documentation correction.

         Lloyd Miller, Calgary_Fido, #17/418

         If anyone has tried the "previously undocumented" feature 
        decribed in the V10I.doc update they probably had trouble 
        getting it to work if they followed the documentation. It 
        states that you should a file called QNEWUSER.BBS! This is 
        obviously wrong because that file is used for new users not 
        for users who forgot their password. The correct file name 
        is QNOPWD.BBS, which is logical and you could probably 
        guessed it your self.

        I have set up the file to display the following message 
        since I have an open board and got tired of calling users 
        who couln't remember their password to tell them what they 
        should have known anyway.

        "The penalty for forgetting your password is - you cannot 
        log in for 30 days. See you then, Bye."

        Of course all I do is use the "O)ld" command from the sysop 
        utility to delete users after 30 days so when they come back 
        they will be able to log in and enter a new password.

                         Running Fido with MultiLink
                          Allen Miller, Fido 108/0

             This brief document is an attempt to describe how to 
        use MultiLink (by Software Link) to run 2 Fido's on one PC.  
        The reader should be able to use this information to 
        determine how to run Fido as a background task while being 
        able to run other programs in the foreground.  Software Link 
        is located at 8601 Dunwoody Place, Atlanta, Georgia, 30338.  
        Their policy, when I bought MultiLink, was to allow a 30 day 
        trial period.  MultiLink is copy protected.  

             I said I would do this a long time ago, and I apologize 
        for its tardiness.  

             Accompanying this document should be 4 files: 
        AUTOEXEC.BAT, AUTOEXE1.BAT, FUP1.BAT and FUP2.BAT.  These 
        are commented batch files that I use on my system.  For 
        those of you that are interested, Fido 108/0 at 513/579-2587 
        runs on an IBM AT with a 20 meg internal drive and a 35 meg 
        external Tallgrass drive, 2 Hayes 2400 baud modems and is 
        supported by phone service providing 'hunt' when an incoming 
        call encounters a busy on line number 1.  I am currently 
        running DOS 3.0 and MultiLink 3.01.  

             MultiLink has several parameters that may be set via 
        the MLUTIL utility program.  This will allow the operator to 
        modify keyboard loop polling, allocation of cycles between 
        partitions, relative priority between partitions, resource 
        (COM port) allocation and others.  I have experimented with 
        this and found an arrangement that is good for me that you 
        will see in the .BAT files.  

             Please feel free to contact me if you find that this 
        collection is not enough help to get you going or get out of 
        trouble.  I have been running Fido with MultiLink since 
        December, 1984, and both have run flawlessly.

                                 News Flash!

             Memphis, Tennessee abandons tradition!  Fido Nodes 
        proliferate as Memphis makes bold move into network 
        telecommunications!  


        Seriously folks, we Memphians are proud to join your ranks.  
        Historically, we've had one private board operating Fido 
        software for over seven months.  In the two weeks preceding 
        the adoption of the net/node format, another board opened up 
        augmenting that sysop's local service, non-Fido bulletin 
        board system.  Currently, the City on the Mississippi River, 
        sports four different nodes, each with different 
        personalities.  Several more are being discussed.  Already a 
        local Fido Users' Group (FUG) is being formed to coordinate 
        support for sysops in the acquistion of FIDONEWS, NODELISTS, 
        FIDO software updates and general files.  Our users base 
        spans a wide range of occupations, ages and interests.  
        Among our endevours thusfar is one which might be of some 
        interest.  Collaborative writing projects have too often 
        become either very disjointed or overly restrictive 
        creatively.  Our "project" has been set up to maximize both 
        creativity and cohesiveness and, thusfar, has been very 
        successful in both regards.  We are considering uploading it 
        to the Fido Newsletter as an experiment in reader 
        interaction, where readers would be able to help determine 
        plot lines and character development by providing 
        suggestions in feedback to project staff and contributors.  
        We intend to get beyond a Writers Guide, Prologue and four 
        Chapters before making a decision in this regard.  A Readers 
        Guide would also be published to provide procedures for the 
        interactive feedback.  In essence, we are, as with this 
        article, attempting to introduce our new net in order to 
        develop contacts for our users to establish Fido-mail 
        correspondence with.  


        One topic, which has produced a lot of message traffic 
        locally, has been that of sysop and user rights and 
        responsibilities.  We would be very interested in hearing 
        from any other node's sysop or user in this regard.  
        Specifically, we are curious about the types of rules 
        established, levels of compliance, ratio of "active" users 
        to "lurkers" and any distinctions made between local usage 
        and networking.  Generally, we'd like to profit from your 
        experience and guidance.  


        Again, we'd like to express our joy in joining the ranks of 
        networking Fido systems and look forward to establishing our 
        community as vibrant, contributing members of the Fido 
        Fraternity.

        Fido 437/ in net 107


        For about eight months in Bryan/College
        Station has had a computer service called
        Fun-net.  What is Fun-net? Good question
        Fun-net is simillar to the C.B. option on
        compuserve.  up to 16 people can be on at
        one time with lines coming in from
        Houston and Austin.  The operator of this
        system Capt K operates a company out of
        Houston T.x. called FYI systems. Capt K
        said that "FYI means nothing as a company
        name but Normally it is an acronym for
        `For Your Information'".  I asked Capt K
        where he got the idea for Fun-net he said
        that "Fun-net is a spin off of
        Roundtable... The first of interactive
        computer entertainment networks, Which
        was designed and developed by one Jim
        Penny.... Clear Lake City Texas." Capt K
        said that there is one basic version that
        has been in exsistence for about one
        year.  When asked if fun-net was outside
        of Tx he said "Not yet... There are plans
        to put it in other cities and states...
        At the moment there are only five in
        exsistence...All in Texas.  Fun-net works
        only on the TRS-80 Model 4 with an
        additional outboarded cpu... The first
        time I asked him how much it cost he said
        "I don't know how much Fun-net cost
        yet...So far it's just been my house and
        3 cars" after a little prodding he said
        that "it cost 10k plus instalment.  When
        asked if if was to be developed for other
        Computer he said "Its not planned for
        any other hardware and it takes a modem
        for each incoming line." I think with a
        little prodding (and money) you might be
        able to get Capt K. to give you the
        source.

        A few Ideas about the rewrite of FIDO.

        by

        Paul Kelly and Jim Lynn  
        13/11          13/384  


             When  in  the  course  of  human  events,   it  becomes 
        necessary  for  two  or more FIDO Sysops to sit  around  and 
        discuss the operations of a FIDO-BBS,  the topic (BS) always 
        turns  to the impending re-write of FIDO as a Public  Domain 
        system.   After all of the pros and cons have been beaten to 
        a  pulp,  the simple fact emerges that no one is quite  sure 
        just what they want in FIDO.   When last the Sysops of  FIDO 
        #13/384 (PITTBULL) and  FIDO #13/11 (PITTSBURGH'S SANYO FIDO 
        BOARD)  got  together  (through the  keyboards),  two  major 
        points  of discussion arose.   The first was the subject  of 
        compatability     with    existing    FIDO     systems/mail-
        communications.  The second topic was that of the ability to 
        customize   one's own board to allow expanded  functions  on 
        that particular board.

             One of the current plus points of Fido at this time  is 
        due  to the fact that there is in reality,  only ONE correct 
        version  of Fido,  that being the latest revision issued  by 
        Tom  Jennings.  This allows a person to log into almost  any 
        Fido board in existence and enter commands that have  become 
        familiar  and expect consistent results.   Rather than  feel 
        like a stranger when entering a `new' board,  one can almost 
        feel  as at home as when dialing into the local home  board; 
        something  like  putting  on an old pair of  well  broken-in 
        shoes, everything seems to fit.

             At  the  same time,  with Fido being  a  public  domain 
        program,  written  to  play  to a general audience  that  is 
        growing  at rate beyond anyone's dreams,  many  groups  feel 
        that  while  Fido  is well designed to handle  the  original 
        goals,  there  could be an acceptable means for  customizing 
        their  own board to better suit the particular interests  of 
        their users.   This could be anything from allowing a search 
        through  the  FILES.BBS  of  an  area  to  list  only  newly 
        available  files  since their last  log-in,  to  allowing  a 
        continuously  running  "forum" type conversation  where  the 
        messages would simply be added into one file and accessed as 
        a  whole rather than tracking through messages and  threaded 
        replies.

             A  case  in  point is occuring on the  PITTBULL  system 
        which has become a  standard meeting place for several local 
        special  interest groups.   The board has added  a  separate 
        area  for  each of these groups,  and within each group  are 
        designated   individuals  who  are  `in  charge'   of   that 
        particular  area  of  the board.   They assume the  task  of 
        testing  uploaded  files,  editing  the  FILES.BBS  display, 
        monitoring  messages and generally acting as  an  "assistant  
        sysop" within that particular area.







FIDONEWS     --           22 Jul 85  00:01:09           Page 14


             Within  these  local  areas,   we  feel  there  is  the 
        possibility  of customizing the type of displays and type of 
        functions  to meet the needs of this group to allow  quicker 
        access  to  the type of operation that  the  group  desires.  
        This  we envision as some type of a customizable overlay  to 
        allow,  from  within this area only,  access to a variety of 
        external routines which could for example: 

             A)  Provide a database type program  which would  allow 
        better  facilities  for searching and retrieving  files  and 
        messages relating to certain subjects than could possibly be 
        provided within Fido.

             B)  Allow conferences between users on multi-line  Fido  
        systems. 

             C) Display  mail waiting  for a user when the user logs 
        on.

             D)  Show  a list of files uploaded or  newly  available 
        since  the last time a user was in the files area.

             E)   Allow  the  user with proper  clearance  to  "run" 
        programs  from  within FIDO such as adventure games  or  any 
        program which is a "line-output" type.

             And yet,  by far the majority of Fido boards across the 
        country would not have a need of this type,  hence the  idea 
        of  an overlay to Fido,  utilizing Fido's device drivers and 
        privilege determination, and allowing a return to `standard' 
        Fido  operation  for  the user on  exiting  these  specially 
        `operator configured' areas.

             A rewrite is comparible to re-inventing the wheel,  and 
        the  wheel  we now are re-inventing would not  require  that 
        much  extra  work  to function in a way which  may  be  more 
        flexible for certain applications.

             We all know what Fido looks like from the outside,  and 
        once source is written to provide similar action to THE Fido 
        we have come to know and love (or hate, or accept), there is 
        such a great possibility that chaos will erupt.   In witness 
        to  this,  look  at the thousands of versions of  RBBS  that 
        exist, with none being compatible with any other.

             We  feel that what  should be recommended is  that  the 
        "code  committee" guard the material during the re-write  in 
        order to prevent a "leak" of the souce code for the new FIDO 
        and   only  release  compiled  versions  to  guarantee   the 
        existence of only one current version of FIDO,  in a fashion 
        very  similar  to the current situation.   The  `hooks'  for 
        overlays  and the format that they must conform to could  be 
        distributed.   This  would provide with fair certainty  that 
        there  would be no pirated or customized FIDO's which  would 
        lead  to  a situation like the RBBS "net-work"  where  every 
        board in existence is different.







FIDONEWS     --           22 Jul 85  00:01:12           Page 15


             In this manner,  the work that goes into the `new' Fido 
        source  code is still available for later groups to work  on 
        and  modify if the original re-write group becomes unable to 
        handle  the  task,  and yet the code is  not  available  for 
        casual  perusal  and modification at the whim of  a  curious 
        passerby with the intent of creating a back door entrance or 
        other obvious detrimental effect.

             Fido  can remain the viable and compatible  `operation' 
        that  it  always has been,  and with some  changes,  it  may 
        become  the  ONLY RBBS system to exist.   People  that  feel 
        `handicapped'  due to not having source code to `operate  on 
        and  patch' would need no longer yearn to get at the innards 
        of our standard and compatible Wonder Dog.  Change and patch 
        your  overlay  to you hearts desire,  make it as  unique  or 
        complex or fancy as you wish, without begining the ruination 
        of the friend that has caused us to come together as such  a 
        large group of enthusiasts.

             We  encourage  other  operators to submit  their  views 
        toward  our suggestions.   Maybe we can draft  some  optimum 
        goals  to  obtain  towards   having a  system  that  remains 
        totally  compatible and  yet as flexible as it needs to  be, 
        without  the  fear  of negating the  efforts  to  remain  an 
        integrous network that have already been put forth so well.

        SAUNTERING SYSOPS BATMAN...

                Picture a bus load of Fido Sysops with a printed 
        text file as a guide scooting north on the Garden State 
        Parkway.  That's what we had on our hands when Dan North, 
        Comm Sig Chair; Bob Klahn (Fido Coordinator); Jim 
        Goldschneider; Joel Garrett; Gwen and Van Olmstead dog 
        tracked to a Fido Sysop conference a couple weeks ago.  You 
        thought we only traveled at 300/1200/2400 baud?  Not so.  We 
        also move at sub-warp speeds.  We were answering the call of 
        Thom Henderson (Node #107/7 on the national list) who fidoed 
        an invitation to all Net 107 Sysops to join him on his boat 
        for a day of sun, suds, surf and sysoping.  Spouses and all.  
        I, for one, relished the opportunity to bring Spouse Gwen 
        along.  She is a distant observer of most of this PC junk 
        and she could burn her bronze body while the Sysops lamented 
        the routing system bugs and generally yapped about kennel 
        business.  

                Dogbreath Klahn, (he started the name himself), our 
        leader dog, called to inform me that the directions that 
        were Netmailed to him were wrong.  "Thom's message says 
        these directions are to his boat.  They are the same 
        directions he sent last time--those were to his house!"  Not 
        to worry.  We called Thom Henderson on the conference line 
        and we were promised a correction.  

                With the location all co-ordinated we could go on to 
        coordinate other things.  Irene, Thom's POSSLQ (Person of 
        Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters), did not relish 
        providing more than relish for the whole of Net 107 so there 
        was food to co-ordinate.  Do Fido's eat dogs?  What do they 
        woof down?  Where should the pack congregate?  What doggone 
        time do we leave?  

                I drove the van.  It seemed fitting.  It's Gwen's 
        Van.  She has several, counting me, my son and the Toyota.  
        She let us use it.  That was nice.  Her van isn't like 
        home...it's better.  Graphic equalizer, ice maker and refrig 
        at hand make two-hour drives almost pleasant, even if the 
        directions don't lead you where you wanted to go.  We made 
        it anyhow.  To Thom's barkentine.  

                Actually, it wasn't a barkentine.  Thom and Irene 
        own a cabin catamaran.  The nicest thing on two hulls!  Big 
        areas to sun and lots of cabin space.  Computer nuts should 
        have gadgets and the Hendersons did.  Binoculars with the 
        compass headings visible in the eyepiece make it much easier 
        to spot the nudist colony at 193 degrees magnetic.  He 
        showed us all sorts of electronic navigational gadgets. 
        Among the neatest was their friend Mike.  We let Mike sail 
        us across the bay.  Mike is an electronic helmsman.  He 
        sailed just fine.  

                The day was warm enough and we got a chance to toss 
        the hook and go swimming in the bay.  I stepped on a crab 
        but I didn't tarry long enough for it to retaliate.

        Besides, nobody was working hard that day.  The most labor 
        done had something to do with pop tabs on cans.  After 
        enough sailing and swimming was done to satisfy the interest 
        of all, we headed for the marina and made fast.  Then we got 
        down to real business.  

                Like all good computer related stuff, Fido would be 
        lost without sufficient jargon to confuse the user and 
        observer alike.  We convened long enough to get some of the 
        conventions adopted.  Some definitions:  

        1. Dogyard, kennel, puppy palace all refer to the Fido 
           environment.  "Thanks for stopping by my dogyard."  
           "Appreciate you sniffing around the kennel."  

        2. A bone is free credit on the users' behalf to be used for 
           long distance communication by FidoNet.  "Thanks for 
           throwing me the bone."  

        3. Fido programs do not have bugs but rather fleas.  

        4. Barking dogs are those who use the Yelp command too 
           frequently.  

        5. Routing codes mean your message goes through Africa to 
           save phone charges.  

        6. Almost anything can be paid for by credit on one's board.  

        7. No right thinking Sysop will accept payment for anything 
           by means of credit on a Fido.  

        8. Veterinarian--what Bob Klahn does if you give him Sysop 
           privs.  

        9. Although dognames may be used to refer to sysops (e.g. 
           Dogbreath, Edifido, K-9, Diversifido [should be my 
           board]) there are no laws on the books with respect to 
           the practice.  In short, it's not Dogma!

        The following text is from the Sex Story board RAUNCH that I
        have been running on my boards for the last 7 months.  It
        originally ran on my Fido at college, Hell Central, where it
        got off to a slow, diversified start.  Now on my board at
        home (which doesn't have the hardware to make my being in
        the net feasible) it continues to expand in characters and
        realism, although the number of contributors has lessend.
        Below are the first four entries; you will notice that they
        are more juvenile than subsequent entries will be, but I
        believe the quality is well above that of most story board,
        sex story boards to say the least.  Hope you enjoy it, and
        if you want, give the board a call and contribute.

             Now many  would call  me a  peeping Tom, but my name is
        Mark, and  am only  an admirer...really.  Anyway, I couldn't
        believe it yesterday.  I'm not bad looking, but hunting down
        females around here is quite a chore.  For that reason I was
        really surprised  when the  Wheelers moved next door.  There
        used to be a older couple, but they headed off to Florida or
        something... Anyway, I was my usual interested self and wan-
        dered next door to check out what was going on.  There was a
        little obnoxious  kid running  around, just  like my younger
        brother.  This wasn't a good sign.  But I looked in the door
        and politely  knocked.   Mrs. Wheeler appeared, holding some
        books I guess she was putting them away  at the time.  Being
        the neighborly  sort I  offered my aid in moving them in and
        she graciously accepted.
             I was  getting curious  as to the make-up of their fam-
        ily, only  seeing the mother and the little kid named Scott.
        After about  ten minutes  a sleek  new corvette came rolling
        into the  driveway.   Mr. Wheeler  got out  of the passenger
        seat.   He wasn't  THAT old, but was definitely middle-aged.
        But what  got my  eyes popping  out of their sockets was the
        image exiting  from the  driver seat.   Never,  and  I  mean
        NEVER, had  I seen  such a  vision...not in  any of the many
        sexpot mags  I had  hidden away in my closet (shhhh....), or
        anything around here.  I wish I had a chance to get a better
        look at  that time,  but she  headed right inside blocked by
        the car.   I  knew I  would have  a better  opportunity if I
        played my cards right.
             Mrs. Wheeler  said that  her number  one  daughter  was
        named Rachel.   "Number  one?" I  thought..."could there  be
        more?"   I inquired  to this,  and Mrs.  Wheeler  said  that
        daughter number two was named Stacy.

             About an  hour later  we finished up.  I was both hyper
        to see  Rachel and  use the  restroom  facilities.    I  had
        learned that Stacy was with her grandparents until they were
        all moved  in.   She is  16 like  me, while Rachel is 18.  I
        wandered towards  the bathroom,  and, upon  seeing the  door
        locked, knocked.  It was then that I saw Rachel up-close for
        the first  time...well, only  her face, but it was enough to
        send me off into my wild dream land.  Her face was perfectly

        shaped, with  long brown hair, soul-piercing eyes, and full,
        waiting lips.  I can't even remember what she said, as I was
        too caught  up in  my imagination.  I remember wandering off
        and Mrs.  Wheeler inviting  me to  dinner once they were all
        set in, but the next thing I knew I was in my bed.
             I woke  up to  my mom's  shakings...it was dinner time.
        Being a  saturday, I  knew I could stay up without the usual
        parental pestering,  and spy  on my new voluptuous dream.  I
        rushed through  dinner, and  wandered around aimlessly until
        about 10.   It  was ripe  time for spying...especially since
        the Wheelers  were just  moved in  and would like to hit the
        sack after a long day.
             I circled their house until I saw Rachel in her room on
        the first  floor.   This was  a stroke  of luck, putting the
        "kids"  upstairs,   so  I   wouldn't  have  to  do  as  much
        maneuvering.   Rachel was  on her bed, back turned to be.  I
        was really  getting pumped  up just  thinking about  her.  A
        half an  hour passed in what appeared to be an eternity when
        she got  up and  walked to her dresser to get her nightgown.
        She then lifted her blouse high.  "Damn," I whispered, since
        her stance  blocked her  reflection  in  the  mirror.    She
        turned, and  undid her  bra.    "Gasp,"  could  be  my  only
        utterance, as  beautiful, round,  full, HUGE tits swung into
        view.   I had  to catch  my breath, and by the time I turned
        back she was slipping on her gown.  I managed to get a quick
        glimpse at  her smooth, long legs, and was once again on the
        ground.  I quickly ran home.  This was enough excitement for
        one night!

             After that  sight, I  couldn't wait  to see  the  other
        daughter.  Sure enough, after a couple of days, she arrived.
        This was  a sight worth waiting for.  Picture the ideal slut
        that every  man has  in his  head.   She was it.  Long blond
        hair,red lips,  too much  eye makeup, and the biggest set of
        knockers I  had ever seen on such a petite frame.  They were
        stuffed into  a sheer  tank top that left no doubt about the
        absence of  a bra.   Below  this was  a pair of cutoffs that
        revealed the  bottom third  of a pair of perfect ass cheeks,
        and a few wisps of dark curly hair.
             No sooner  had she  climbed from  the corvette than her
        father hustled  her into  the house.   From  the look on his
        face I  could tell that he didn't approve of her appearance.
        That didn't  matter I sure did.  I knew that when the dinner
        invitation came  I would  be there.  I also hoped to get her
        over for a swim in our pool.
             
             The next  day Mrs.  Wheeler invited  me over.  It was a
        good deal since my parents were going to a small party for a
        couple of  hours and  I'll take home cooking over TV dinners
        anyday.   But the absence of my parents made the prospect of
        getting Stacy  over for a swim even better, and would possi-
        bly allow me to get a BETTER view of the 16-year old dream.
             I certainly  had spent  much of  this first week fanta-
        sizing about  the Wheeler  girls, so  much that I was really
        being distracted  in school.   Not  that it  mattered  since
        school is just there, but my friends were getting to wonder-
        ing what  was going on and I didn't want them to learn of my

        "find" as of yet.
             At 6:30 I walked over to Wheelers.  The little brat was
        there with  is big  wheel and proceeded to roll over my toes
        before I  practically leaped  through the  door.   Stacy was
        there  and   introduced  herself.     My   earlier  observa-
        tions/wishes were  re-invoked and  she usually  gave me that
        certain stare  and squeezed her huge chest together with her
        arms and  she blinked  her eyes like an innocent.  This girl
        was not!   And  she still had that tank top that was driving
        me crazy.
             It was  near dinner so I sat down and Stacy sat next to
        me.   Mr. Wheeler  seemed to keep an eye on us all the time,
        and his presence combined with my nervousness made my speech
        very weird.   We  talked a bit about where they used to live
        and all  the people  around here,  and about  school (ugh!).
        The dinner  was great,  but I was hoping the desert would be
        better.   I helped  clear the table and then walked into the
        family room to sit by Stacy and struck up a conversation.
