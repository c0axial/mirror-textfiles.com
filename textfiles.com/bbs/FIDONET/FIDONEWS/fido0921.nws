Editorial: Lost not found

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Yay! The VERSIONS EDITOR was not lost at sea. Routed mail has been
consistently lost, bidirectionally. My my, won't that make a nice
investigative article! An article on How-To send in your updates to
the list (not included cuz the current one is so old) enclosed.

From other parts of (my) universe come these reports --

I'm still recovering from all the problems I've generated with
FidoNews.

Flames from the INTERUSER flap still lap at my ankles.

The 9-19 editorial still generates responses. (Let's save me some
trouble: I said the riots were inevitable ie. predictable, not that I
thought they were "good". It's not the same thing.) One response
appears here. Q: Why didn't I run "your" response? A: temperature.
Case closed.

Questions as to what I want to do *if* I grow up continue to plague
me.

My ancient car needs a new steering box and windshield.

Our house has been invaded by these weird hovering flying things. They
are not house flies. San Francisco has always had them, but this year
there are thousands. They occupy any large-volume of still air. I am
certain they are having acrobatic 3-D group sex (they must hurry, else
they fall to the floor. How depressing.)

Please don't flame me. Not only will it make me sad, you won't get a
satisfying rapid-response because I am going to Seattle to visit
someone I love for the month of June, and will generate FidoNews from
afar via my Tandy 200. (Let's hope the LAN stays up!)

             THE FIDONEWS VERSION LIST IS CHANGING AGAIN
             -------------------------------------------

Like I didn't have enough to do. Alas, it's time to once again take on
yet another task. This one is a bit more complicated than many other
aspects of FidoNet, at least from an administrative standpoint. The
FidoNews software version list is being rehashed, rebuilt,
restructured, and re anything else you can think of.

 There are numerous problems which need be considered. One of the
largest the mere fact that much of the software currently listed is
not supported by folks reachable via FidoNet or even other FTN
channels, so updates regarding these software packages seem to come
from less than 100% reliable sources. Update information should,
whenever possible, be submitted directly by the author, and software
authors ought to keep in mind the version list when updating or
releasing their software. I even came across several programs in the
old version list that are no longer supported by the original
publisher, and because of this it doesn't make much sense to continue
to list it.

 Of course with every new list keeper there's a new procedure for data
submission and revision. It was my conclusion that this process was
traditionally dealt with completely manually, and there was no way I
was going to keep that tradition going - there are just too many
programs out there, and too much room for error.

 So, I drafted specs on a new method of version list data submission
whereby software authors and/or their representatives could submit new
items and/or updates and know that they would be processed as
submitted, and receive a receipt of their submission. In addition, the
version list output will be significantly different than it has been
in the past. This is one aspect of the project that hasn't gotten as
much attention yet as the data collection process has, so some
experimentation, along with the collection of opinions of the authors
and/or readers themselves, will eventually bring us a regular
publication routine.

     So how does this all work now?  Simple, actually.

                       S. ShareWare

*   U)nknown will automatically be assigned to all software
    during conversion from the existing Version List files
    unless currently listed as Commercial. Since most of
    these categories are new ones, authors should update the
    listings for their software.

Much of the information on presently listed software would
be considered incomplete based on these new standards.
Authors of software who find that their listings are
incomplete should make every effort to update their listings
as soon as possible for the benefit of those who might rely
on the Version List's information.  Also, past practice has
maintained listings for software not directly related to or
written by members of FidoNet.  Submisssion and update data
will be accepted by third parties for this software until
such time as a more reliable updating method is devised.
FidoNews 9-21                  Page 5                      25 May 1992


Submissions received which fail to meet the above technical
standards will not be processed.  All submissions, whether
accepted or not, will be automatically acknowledged via
netmail if the submission was properly addressed.

Because the traditional method of weekly publication of an
abbreviated version of the complete versions list in every
issue of FidoNews seems very tedious and only serves to
weaken the publication's possible importance and usefulness,
a new publication method will be adopted.

The FidoNews version list will be published as an weekly,
rotating, incremental reference list.  This means that more
information per software product will be published in every
issue, but the software category being published from week
to week will change.  Initially some of the experimentation
with this publication method may cause some minor confusion,
but hopefully that confusion will clear up rather quickly,
or at least soon after the editor's does.  However, the
initial publication of the list will be a complete one.
This will allow authors to update their information quickly,
before the next publication of their software's information.

In addition, authors of listed software may find that having
their software available at the Version List editor's system
may help make their programs more available to those who may
be interested in them.  As will be determined by the
response rate, if enough authors of any given software
products find any added value by having the system which
updates the Versions List maintain the LATEST and greatest
published version of their programs, they can directly
submit a redistributable copy of their product, or its
information file if the software cannot be made available
due to its primary distribution method.  These submissions
should include netmail authorizing redistribution.

The submitted programs and information files will be made
available for 24 hour file request by anyone at all, and
downloadable on the system maintaining the versions listing.
Software and/or information files available via this channel
will be noted as such within the published version list.

This comprehensive version listing, accompanied by the
software and/or information file relating to the software
could pose as a valuable resource to those who have trouble
finding what they are looking for as well as to the authors
of the software used by FidoNet.  New software versions will
always replace older ones.  No replaced version will remain
available once replaced with a newer release.

The complete Version List will be available for FTN file
request and download on at least 1:107/323@FidoNet, HST/V32,
reachable at 1-908-247-8252.  If other systems duplex the
file library, their addresses and telephone numbers will be
publised along with the Version List.  The magic request
filename for the complete Version List will be VER-LIST.
FidoNews 9-21                  Page 6                      25 May 1992


Other listings will be published as well.  These listings
will be formatted in different ways and cross-referenced to
each other somehow.  Details on this needs some work yet,
and announcements will be made as the report generators are
completed and the files become available.

If any author remains with questions regarding the Version
List, s/he should feel free to contact the version list
editor, Fabian Gordon, at 1:107/323@FidoNet.

If any author or reader of the Version List feels additional
data fields should be maintained or if a new report format
is in order, contact should be made with the editor at the
same address.  All suggestions will be considered.

If you know of any program which has been updated but not
reflected on the Version List, please contact the author.
DO NOT contact the Version List editor yourself.

Well, it took a while to get this whole procedure ready, but
I suspect it was worth the wait considering the scope and
diversity of the Version List and its information.  I most
certainly hope you find the information presented in a
coherent and useable format.

Editorial Reply
by Richard Bash
1:215/357


     The May 11, 1992 issue of Fido News (Volume 9, Number 19)
contained an editorial by Tom Jennings regarding the recent riots
in Los Angeles and San Francisco. I would like the opportunity to
reply to that editorial and suggest a different point a view.

     Mr. Jennings stated that: "It was a rebellion, not merely a
`riot'. Poor people rebelled; many of the poor people there were
black. It is not a coincidence that black people are the poor
ones. This has been enforced by whatever means are necessary and
at hand."

     I take exception to Mr. Jennings comments in this regard. It
was not "poor people" who "rebelled" but the demonstrative act of
mob hysteria at work precipitated by the criminal actions of
several members of an agreed underclass. To rebel does not mean
that one burns down over 5,273 buildings, including local grocery
stores, laundromats, and other facilities that support the people
living in the affected area. That was a brazen criminal act. That
was stupidity by anyone's call. Mr. Jennings conveniently ignores
or fails to address the fact that the greater percentage of "poor
people" living in the area did not "rebel" but stayed in their
FidoNews 9-21                  Page 8                      25 May 1992


homes, fearful of harm from this mindless mob. Mr. Jennings and I
agree that this was not a racial based riot.

     I am dismayed that Mr. Jennings, along with a majority of
the media representatives (electronic or print), have neglected
to mention that those four Los Angeles police officers did not
start the incident by seeking out Mr. Rodney King. They met Mr.
King as the end result of a 100-plus mph car chase. It never seems
to be reported that Mr. King, to the satisfaction of the jury,
assaulted the police officers and refused to submit to arrest.
Common sense dictates, and the California Penal Code instructs,
that one submit to an arrest and fight their battles later, not
in the streets, but in the court room. Mr Jennings and his media
colleagues fail to mention that the other two gentlemen who were
in the car with Mr. King were not harmed in any way; they
submitted to the arrest.

     Mr. Jennings stated: "The jury was tampered with, in the
usual legal manner of tossing out anyone who has an opinion,
skill or shows intelligence. The jury was told explicitly, and
illegally, that they could not `vote their conscience' but only
look at the law. This not only undermines the U.S. legal system,
but all of the good parts of the last few hundred years of
Western Law." That is a wholly unfounded, civically irresponsible
charge. Mr Jennings is reminded that the judge in a case is the
trier of law and the jury the trier of facts. Mr. Jennings is
reminded that the jury's instructions from the judge were to
examine the facts and, if they found that the defendants had met
the requirements of the legally defined charges filed by the
prosecution in the case, to find the officers guilty. Mr.
Jennings is reminded that the prosecution failed to make its case
and convince the jury that the charges leveled against the
officers, which required the legal definition of "intent," were
proven by the facts in the case "beyond a reasonable doubt and to
a moral certainty." It is suggested to Mr. Jennings that there is
every reason to believe that the prosecution, representing as it
does the interests of the State of California and its citizenry,
simply "blew it." Mr. Jennings is reminded that in crucial cases
in Southern California, under the jurisdiction of District
Attorney Ira Reiner, that this not the first time a possibly
inept prosecution was presented (viz., the McMartin trial among
others). I would encourage Mr. Jennings and his media colleagues
to consider that ineptitude on the part of the Bradley
administration and the prosecutor's office resulted in the
verdict and to lay the fault where it belongs: at the feet of the
mayor's office.

     Mr. Jennings rightfully (but rather crudely) displays his
disgust for the rioting in Los Angeles and San Francisco. But to
editorialize on this incident without providing a balanced view
is inciteful at the very least and possibly irresponsible
journalism.

FidoNews 9-21                  Page 9                      25 May 1992


     This is an international communications forum. Mr. Jennings
needs to be reminded that his portrayal of America is tendentious
at best and that there are millions of "normal" Americans in this
country who are not in the least sympathetic with the actions of
rioters, looters and criminals. Mr. Jennings "proof" is hearsay
at the very least and an insult to the readership. We expect
better from a man of Mr. Jenning's stature, talent and ability to
access facts.

     In closing, I wish to declare that I am not now nor have I
ever been a law enforcement officer. Like Mr. Jennings I harbor
feelings that the Los Angeles Police Department is poorly led and
perhaps poorly instructed but they remain the last line of
defense between civilized humanity and the gang members and other
criminal elements who displayed their reprehensible conduct. But
that in no way excuses either the use of excessive force, assault
under the color of authority or the criminal acts of the
underclass. It is hoped that should Mr. Jennings seek to
editorialize on such events in the future that he will do so with
factual, non-profane, intelligent and well-thought-out statements
so that he may better represent the class of people to whom he
addresses his remarks: we are not the same ignorant rabble that
Mr. Jennings discusses in his editorial. Thank you for your
attention.

OK I'm the editor so I suppose I get the last word in... :-) For 200
years US. juries have had the right and obligation to judge the law as
well as the defendant. Why do so many people insist this cannot be so?
(It's hardly partisan; Klan and Nazi murderers of 5 North Carolina
civil-rights protesters got off in 1979 because of it.) Contact FIJA

I ran Mr. Bash's response because, though we obviously strongly
disagree (ahem!) it isn't a flame. I received probably 20 replies to
that particular editorial; surprisingly (to me) it was about 50/50
agree/disagree. Most of the disagreement kind were flames.

Let's consider the case closed, and proceed onward to the next
conflagration. *)

As the time grows closer to November 6th the clouds of controversy and
concern loom not only in the Republican and Democratic campaign
committees but in The Senate, The House and most vocally in the Press.
Who and what is the major topic of this controversy and concern?
Henry Ross Perot.  The un-politician, the man who is not "running" for
President.

Who is this multi-billionaire?  Most of us know him by his reputation
as a hard driving, no BS, get the job done successful businessman from
Texas, who has made a fair chunk of his fortune in businesses related
to the computer industry.  But few, if any of the general American
public really know "who" H. Ross Perot is.  Not since Harry S. Truman
and "Stormin'" Norman has a major media figure taken such a hardline
stance against the "we have a right to know", muck-raking, stab and
jab attitudes of what the Press considers pertinent.

What does he stand for?  What does he stand against?  What does he
think about the state of this nations health care, the trade deficit,
AIDS, military spending, and on and on.  Issues that each of the
"candidates" says that he has the answers for.  Is it the issues that
the American people want to know about or is it the fact that maybe
someone will do their best for this country and be straight with it's
people.

The fact that the bulk of his support is not from the independents and
the dissidents who in the past have supported the "third-party"
candidates is evidence of a message.  A message that the American
people are sending to ALL politicians.  That message is that they are
tired of the way the job is being done or not being done, they are
tired or broken "promises", and outright lies.  Is it time for a
change?  Is it time for America to once again stand tall and proud in
the world community?  Is it time to dig out those values that once
made us number one, wash out the greed, corruption, and pork-barreling
to see if we can once again hold our flag and our heads high in the
world?

Look at the picture of America that is being painted for the rest of
the world.  A country that sacrifices lives in a war for petro-
dollars, politicians and businessmen who engage in Japan bashing over
automobiles, an administration that has a revolving door support
policy for third world nations, and an out of control internal
economy.  A country which denounces human-rights violations in other
parts of the world, yet itself sets free men who brutally and
unnecessarily beat its own citizens.  A country where a city's police
force turns its back while mob violence destroys businesses and homes,
injures and kills people.  Turned their back!

While Americas homeless and indigent starve on our streets, while AIDS
patents die waiting for a cure, while educational funds are slashed,
Congress gives itself a raise and kites checks.  Is this the type of
country we expect the rest of the world to look up to, one that is
unable make it's own system work.  Is this the role model we present
to eastern block countries struggling for a democratic style of
FidoNews 9-21                  Page 11                     25 May 1992


government?  Is the legacy that we choose to leave our children.

Maybe Ross Perot doesn't have all the answers.  But it appears that he
has one big answer and that answer is change.  There are a lot of
people out there who do not want to see this or any other type of
change happen and yet many more who will welcome any change.  Daily,
this is becoming a bigger (if not the biggest) issue.  This promises
to be one of the most controversial if not historical presidential
elections of our times.  As the fractures in our two-party system grow
larger the possibility of a constitutional crisis looms heavily on the
horizon.

Have you given any thought to your vote?  Are you satisfied with the
status quo?  Are you still trying to decide?  Do you have an opinion?
There is a place to learn, to make a stand, to take issue, or to just
keep up to date.  The Echo Conference PEROT_4_PRESIDENT.  It's a
question and it's a statement.  Use it to share what you know, ask
about what you don't know, or just state your opinion.  Be part of the
problem, be part of the solution, or be a bystander whatever you
choose, just be there or be left out in the rain.

MetroNet World HQ, 2:2400/17@fidonet.org, 8:240/3@metronet

                    MetroNet reaches the United States!
                    -----------------------------------

Founded May '91 in Nuremberg MetroNet soon spread all over Germany.
The  first
nodes all were located in my region.  Later nodes in Berlin and
Hannover
followed. A few days ago the first node outside of Germany joined the
network!
His name is Bruce Meyer and his system is located in Columbia, South
Carolina.
His system (Remote System 232) will be the coordination site for the
USA.

The structure of MetroNet is a little bit different to the FidoNet
structure.
Not by technical means, it works the same way as FidoNet does, but the
coordination of network numbers and hub systems slightly differs:

Every country gets a NET NUMBER. There only is ONE zone number for
MetroNet
worldwide: Zone 8. Net coordinators therefore also are coordinators
for  their
country. The net number for the US is 100. Germany's net number is
240.
A hub system for a region would get a number like 100 or 200. Every
FidoNews 9-21                  Page 12                     25 May 1992


downlink
of 8:100/100 would get a node number between 8:100/101 and 8:100/199.

network coordinator for net 8:100 and MetroNet HQ for the United
States:

   Bruce Meyer     1:367/106@fidonet.org   8:100/1@metronet

network coordinator for net 8:240 and MetroNet HQ for Germany:

   Joerg Dassler   2:2400/10@fidonet.org   8:240/1@metronet

The really NEW thing about MetroNet is the fact that most areas are
GERMAN.
As far as I know MetroNet is the FIRST german network to be spread in
the  US!

I know that there are many users and sysops in the states, who can
speak
german ... so maybe this is a way to inform them about MetroNet.

Of course there will be many english areas - that's just a question of
time
and depends on how many users want to run areas in MetroNet.

So, if you are in the US and you are interested in becoming a hub
system  for
your state or city or if you are interested in a MetroNet node number
or if
you are interested in running an area or if you just have any
questions  about
MetroNet send a netmail to Bruce Meyer, 1:376/106@fidonet.org !

Wenn Du in Deutschland bist und Interesse hast ein Hub System fuer
Dein
Bundesland zu werden oder Interesse an einer MetroNet Nodenummer hast
oder
Interesse hast Moderator einer Area zu werden oder ganz einfach ein
paar
Fragen zu MetroNet hast, schreibe einfach eine Netmail an
Clifton Cartwright, 2:2400/17@fidonet.org!

If you are somewhere else in the world and you are interested in
becoming
a coordinator for your country or if you have any questions about
MetroNet
send a netmail to Clifton Cartwright 2:2400/17@fidonet.org !

I hope that you will join us, too!

See ya,
Clifton

Sysop of Void Where Prohibited, 1:19/141


OK_SYSOP is an Oklahoma-specific echo devoted to inter-net sysop
communications.

It's like your local sysop chat echo, only for ALL Oklahoma sysops.

Access is not restricted to Fidonet sysops, either; anybody who is the
primary sysop of a BBS in Oklahoma is allowed to join up, either through
carrying the echo or posting on it from another BBS.

Co-sysops and users are not allowed.

If you live in Oklahoma, and are interested in OK_SYSOP, you can get it
from one of the following places:

1) It is available on the region 19 backbone.  You will have to convince
your NEC to add it manually, however.

2) You can arrange a feed with anybody who has it already; please be
careful to avoid dupes and to keep non-Okies and non-sysops out.

3) Contact the moderator at 1:19/141.

4) Contact John Souvestre at 1:396/1, or Remus Williams at 1:106/167,
and ask for a feed.  They will likely refer you to another system, but
you'll end up with a feed somehow.

The moderator is Shawn McMahon.  Echo rules available on request; the
rules ARE on-topic for discussion in the echo.

RF4SALE Echo... Revisited
by Bill Weinel 1:151/121.0

Thanks to a gracious donation of time, energy, and money by Dave
Skinner (1:105/711), RF4SALE is now available to all in zone 1 on
a delivered basis (yes Charlotte, that's a FREE delivered basis.)
[Please note that this offer is good only until Dave comes to his
senses or gets buried under the heap of extra phone bill pages.
...whichever occurs first :)]

FidoNews 9-21                  Page 14                     25 May 1992


"So what is RF4SALE" you ask? Well in case you missed the initial
announcement a few Fidonews issues back, allow me to reiterate
briefly.

RF4SALE is a good all purpose for sale echo catering specifically
to the RF (that's Radio Frequency) enthusiast.

The RF4SALE echo is for the buying and selling of RF gear of all
types (ie: RF Test gear, 2-way gear, Ham radio gear, Scanners,
Receivers, and etc.). If it's related to radio and you want to sell
it, RF4SALE is the place.

Since I have already posted the rules once, I'll ask you to refer
to back to Fidonews 916 for a complete listing.

So, if you are looking for a good RF related sale echo, RF4SALE may
be what your after.  We're not on the backbone, however the echo is
available from 1:151/121 or 1:151/1003 via HST/DS, or from 1:105/711
at v32b.  Just drop me a netmail if you wish to pick it up and I'll
aid you in finding a feed.

Bill Weinel,  Coordinator RF For-Sale echo.
