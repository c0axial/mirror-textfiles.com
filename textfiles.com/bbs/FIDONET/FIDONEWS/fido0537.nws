     I believe you have missed the point.  There are a couple of
     problems that lead to "self destructiveness" as a sympton.  Most
     of them are related to echomail. One sysop used the words "hiding
     behind a policy complaint".  A policy complaint is a clean
     mechanism for resolving disputes.  It sure as hell beats the
     general means of dispute "resolution" in this day of echomail:
     he who shouts loudest wins.  A policy complaint would result in
     resolution.  All blathering in echomail accomplishes is leaving
     the IMPRESSION that one side or the other is right, depending on
     who you agree with, PROPAGATING the problem.

     The frustrating part of all this is just how many sysops have
     taken the time to read Policy3?  How many who bitch about IFNA
     have really taken the time to read the documents that form the
     legal "paper chain" we are bound by?  Is FidoNet collectively
     self destructive, or is it more an issue of people trying to
     operate a complex system without RTFM?  It's certainly not fair
     to say that only the people in FidoNet don't RTFM.

     This is the basic problem.  Layered on top of it is "sysop
     turnover".  Fully 50% of the sysops who are here now were not
     here a year ago, and this will probably continue for a couple of
     years.  I am continually amazed (unfairly) by questions like:
     Who is Tom Jennings?  Which was written first, Opus or Fido?
     (Clear evidence that people don't RTFM.)

     Most of these new sysops have a fundamentally different
     experience in entering the net.  In the "old days", things were
     really much more difficult than they are now at a technical
     level.  At a social level, this unified the net - everyone who
     was here had gone through a relatively difficult, common "rite
     of passage" to get their node number.  Now, there is a plethora
     of choices to get yourself up and running, and it's getting
     closer and closer to "plug and play".  As Vince says, the network
     has changed from a common effort to a consumer support system.

     Since there was no echomail, disputes occurred far less often,
     and were usually quite local in scope.  They were generally
     resolved that way.  Nowadays, even AFTER a dispute has been
     FidoNews 5-37                Page 2                   12 Sep 1988


     resolved according to Policy locally, it can still be carried
     on in echomail internationally.

     The formal social mechanisms of FidoNet have two major drawbacks:
     there is no clear means defined for alteration of the one
     document we agree we operate under (Policy3), and they were put
     in place before echomail was the force it is today.  (When
     Policy3 was drafted, there were about 1000 nodes, and echomail
     was just beginning.  Now there are 3500+, most of which are
     connected to one conference or another.)

     New sysops come in with their own expectations of what FidoNet is
     or should be.  These expectations may or may not be valid, but
     they are often contradictory with the stated goals of the
     mechanisms in place (the TJ contract, the IFNA Articles of
     Incorporation and Bylaws, and Policy3.)  Since there is no clear
     means to change the mechanisms, people go shovel dung in
     echomail.  Echomail is almost like interactive TV - it CAN be a
     tremendous force for good ... but it also tends to oversimplify
     issues and polarize audiences.  Words can be distorted and taken
     out of context, and reacted to on that basis by people
     originally not involved in the discussion.  More and more, people
     take positions AGAINST this or that as opposed to FOR something.

     Further compounding these problems is the fact that at this time,
     it is not clear whether a Policy complaint can be made and upheld
     on the basis of echomail.  Those complaints that have been made
     and upheld upon appeal involved explicitly illegal behaviour.
     Some decisions have been made at lower levels involving
     "annoying behaviour", but to the best of my knowledge, none has
     been appealed all the way up the chain.  Annoying is a real
     tough call. There are a lot of people in the net who annoy the
     hell out of me.  But they also make me think.  And I have a
     simple option with someone annoying me in echomail - stop reading
     it.  But that leaves new sysops with a skewed perception of the
     net.

     One problem that an RC in particular faces is that we're
     generally encouraged not to file policy complaints against sysops
     in our regions.  (NC's are similiary discouraged from filing
     complaints agains nodes in their own net.) A problem an EchoMail
     coordinator has is that in taking the position, he basically
     agrees to provide all kinds of riff raff with the soapbox to
     criticize the services he is generally paying for.  The *EC
     structure is in an even more difficult position, because there
     is no written policy for it, and recent events have halted
     progress toward same.

     This reveals a problem anyone who has been here for a while has
     experienced.  That is that one gets sick to death of reading
     messages from people asking questions for the Nth time, very
     often in a very adversarial manner.  Eventually, they stop
     answering.  It really gets frustrating when new sysops come in
     and EXPECT all this stuff, EXPECT that the *C structure is
     supposed to help them get set up (we're not), EXPECT they should
     be able to get echomail, EXPECT to get a new version of Opus for
     FidoNews 5-37                Page 3                   12 Sep 1988


     free, etc.  There are a lot of people in the net, and even a
     couple in this conference, who expect a lot for nothing.  That's
     the question your psychology student should be looking into.
     TANSTAAFL.

     There's a lot of work to be done.  It's not clearly defined, and
     no one is going to say "Here - go do this".  Look at what Bob
     Gorrill and Kenyon Karl are doing - they find needs, and address
     them.  Kenyon is a very good example of this: he spent a lot of
     time bitching about this or that - now he's just DOING THINGS TO
     SOLVE PROBLEMS.  I did a lot of complaining when I first got
     involved with echomail (and indeed, with the net).  Look where
     it got me.  The primary question is always: Are you a part of the
     problem, or a part of the solution?  We have enough problems.  We
     need more solutions, and more people working toward them.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                       Episode 9:  A User's Viewpoint


     "So does the international  mail  area  go  through BBS to BBS or
     just to one person?"

     This was a user in (C)hat mode one night.  I winced.  It was like
     asking, "Well, what's this Network Mail thing, anyway?"-The heart
     of FidoNet, Network mail at  NMH,  and this user, who was experi-
     enced in the echos, was  just  getting  around to actually seeing
     that netmail existed.

     Well, this is understandable.   Today, in FidoNet, it's the echos
     that appeal to the users.    A  subject  -- and LOTS of people to
     talk with about it!  Wow!    And  you're in WHICH state?  Hey!  I
     visited there once!  Well, I tried this... -- and so on.

     Okay, echomail has its appeal.   I'd personally love to subscribe
     to well into dozens of  conferences.    But then I'd spend ALL my
     time at the BBS instead  of  only  90%  of it.  No, you can't get
     into everything.  Not in my case.  It'd be all too easy to forget
     the outside world.  I know -- I've been there.

     I personally have a thing  for  netmail.  Direct, cheap, reliable
     communications with  other  computer  weenies I know?  Can't beat
     it!  I sent a 4-page letter to  Ohio  once; got my reply the next
     morning.  The board charged me  18  cents and the phone call cost
     14.  Amazing what an amateur  network  of  BBSs can do.  Like get
     4000 BBSs BSing all hours of the night.  That's MY fascination.

     The average user today doesn't care much about netmail.  In fact,
     around here, most probably don't  even know what it is.  It's not
     ADVERTISED much.    Hey,  look!    A  STAR  TREK echo! -- and the
     netmail area never even gets looked at.

     Those that do inquire get  turned  off  as  soon as they find out
     it's going to cost them.  But, if you don't have friends that use
     BBSs in other areas  of  the  country,  netmail doesn't hold much
     value for you.  It's rather a limited conversation media.

     Of course, the majority of the  users  I see seem to think that a
     BBS is designed strictly around  offering software for free.  Oh,
     I carry some file areas, but I try to emphasize the message areas
     in the NEWUSER files.  Every  once  in awhile it sparks a user to
     check out mail instead of files, and of course it's echomail they
     go after.  But at least they're into E-Mail, and THAT's FidoNet.

     New Fire Service Related Echo - FireHouse Cooking

     I have started a new Echo for those of us who participate in
     FireNet. It is called FireHouse Cooking and the Echo label is
     FHCOOK. It is available from this system at 1:135/14 and I
     expect it will also be available from FireNet Leader at
     1:128/16 once they've heard about it in FireNet Echo.

     If you would like to participate in FH Cooking, send NetMail
     to me at 1:135/14. FH Cooking is all about the greatest
     improvisational cooks in the world - the ones who cook huge
     meals for hungry FireFighters and Paramedics! It is geared
     to the LARGE recipe and LARGE appetite. Anyone interested in
     cooking for more than ten people at a time or providing
     insight into same are welcome to attend.

     Thanks.
