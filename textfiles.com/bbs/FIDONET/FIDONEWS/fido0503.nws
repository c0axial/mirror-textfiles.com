     =================================================================


                          Why all the Hoopla?


          Yup, I am part of the "enemy". I find that all the  hoopla
     and ado about AlterNet  is just  what  it  sounds like, a   bunch
     of  noise. I "joined" AlterNet to keep in touch with some people
     I had typed messages to over the last 3 years (I have been around
     that long, yes) and the instant it became known I was immediately
     shunned by some people with whom I had  been communicating simply
     because I chose to also talk to others in another network.  Never
     mind my reasons  for joining AlterNet, hang me cause  I  joined
     it. Never  mind that  my  reasons   were   neither  political nor
     anti-IFNA, simply tie the noose  tighter  because  I  "defected".
     This alone is reason enough for any sane person to leave.  People
     who will not  listen to  any  reason why.  This attitude has been
     the major factor in my decision to also  "take  my  ball  and  go
     home". I hold no hatred  or ill  feelings  for anyone in FidoNet.
     In fact I wish FidoNet luck and  continued  growth.  I  forsee  a
     lot  of problems in that everyone wants  to make IFNA a toothless
     tiger (which it is now, so I guess they have suceeded).  I wanted
     IFNA  to  be  one  thing and one thing  only.  A  governing  body
     elected  by the "line sysops" who would  have  the  authority  to
     take whatever action necessary to remedy sticky  problems  in the
     net.

          AlterNet  would  have  no  need for being if everybody would
     sit  back  and  remember   one   simple   premise   of   FidoNet,
     co-operation  plain  and simple. So maybe you do not like the way
     something is done, big deal! Is is going to kill  you  to  simply
     forget  it  and continue on? Is is going to do you bodily harm to
     say "Ok there has got to be a  better  way  BUT  until  that  way
     comes  along  then  this  is  "as  good  as  it gets" (to quote a
     commercial). I think not.

          As I stated before my reasons were not political in  nature.
     While  I  disagree  with the way IFNA is now, I have NEVER said a
     word against it since right now this is "as good as it  gets".  I
     am  a  firm  beleiver  in  the  old addage of not bad-mouthing an
     organization as long as I am a member of  that  group.  Outsiders
     may  bad-mouth  away,  but  insiders should always show a "united
     front" and not bite the hand that feeds them. Yes you  are  being
     fed.  You  are  having  your "habit" of telecommunications fed by
     FidoNet. Yet with all the "good things"  FidoNet  has  done  over
     the  past  few years, this latest item in the "bad things" column
     has overshadowed everything else in my mind.

          Look back, who ran the net in  1984/85?    Ken  Kaplan,  Ben
     Baker,  Thom  Henderson,  Tom  Jennings, and others. These people
     poured everything they had into FidoNet only to have it  turn  on
     them and bite them.

          Tom  Jennings  gave  us  the  means (via FIDO <tm>?) to even
     have a FidoNet in the first place. He made it PD even  though  he
     didn't  have  to,  he did. Now there are almost 2500 nodes in the
     net. Back when it was still just Fido and SEADOG there were  1200
     nodes  in the net (or there-abouts). Shareware was the "rage" but
     shareware didn't work. Tom now SELLS  Fido  software.  It  is  no
     longer  the  free  bbs  of the future. It is now the finely tuned
     commercial package he markets to "make a few dollars"

          Ben Baker wrote the nodelist format for us. The same  format
     that,  for  the  most  part is exactly the same as it was in 1984
     when it all started. Ben automated the process.  I  can  remember
     when  FidoNet  nodelists  would have to be "updated" by hand. Try
     that with the  current  nodelist  (and  bring  your  lunch).  Ben
     didn't charge a dime for his software either. And still doesn't.

          Ken  Kaplan  ran the net from St Louis simply because TJ was
     so busy upgrading Fido. Ken made sure  new  nodes  were  welcomed
     into  FidoNet, he answered a LOT of the questions about how to do
     this and how to do that or who to contact to  find  out  how.  He
     was  in  essence  every  help  node all rolled into one. He built
     this net (along with the others) from the ground up.  And  he  is
     still active it it, though maybe not as much as before.

          Thom  Henderson  was  the publicity arm of FidoNet. He wrote
     the  news  (mostly  himself)  for  about  a  year  or  more   and
     distributed  this  sometimes monsterous file from his offices. He
     dedicated a machine (back then not  a  cheap  item)  strictly  to
     news  and  distribution of same. He dedicated a business line (in
     NJ again not a cheap item) to a hobby. and most of  all  he  gave
     of his time, as did all the others who made FidoNet great.

          Without  these individuals there simply would be NO FIDONET.
     There would be no echomail, no electronic email outside of a  pay
     service  like CompuServe <tm> or the Source <tm> etc. There would
     be far less telecommunications junkies  in  this  world  and  far
     more  money  in ma bells pockets from all the long distance calls
     to "log onto a bbs"

          Now if associating with these great folks  (and  not  all  of
     them  are  in  AlterNet)  is  treason or selfishness, then I am a
     traitor. I am selfish.  And  YES  I  am  in  AlterNet  for  these
     reasons.

          If  you  find  this  offensive  then  look  at  the  FidoNet
     nodelist   and  locate  the  various Coordinators and help nodes.
     Would you say they  are "trying  to  help?"  Would  you  say  the
     Echo  coordinators are "trying to help?" Would you even go so far
     as to say that the various help nodes are selfless to a fault.  I
     would.

          Now  I  guess  I will simply have to do as you say and "take
     my ball and go home", right? You tell me  what  I  should  do.  I
     want  to  maintain  contact  with my "electronic" friends in BOTH
     nets, however those in FidoNet are  slamming  me  for  trying.  I
     want  to  maintain meaningful discussions on a variety of topics.

     Not don my Nomex undies and crank up the  flamethrowers.  I  want
     to  have  FUN,  not  wonder  who I will offend next by stating my
     position. Tough decision, you bet it is. I would be giving  up  a
     lot  to  dump  either  of  the "nets", yet like most of the other
     AlterNet sysops, I too am a burnout, I too am 1 flame  away  from
     "pulling  the  plug" and I too am tired of all the fighting, name
     calling, and back-stabbing going on. If I have to  give  up  some
     friends  simply  because  they will not assiciate with me because
     of who I am friends with, I will give them up. Therefore  FidoNet
     be  forwarned  that  I will dump FidoNet and all it's BS if I get
     just  one  more  flame.  That  is  the  reason for the "anonymous
     writer" theme behind this. Not because I want to hide  who  I  am
     but because I do not want to quit.

     Gateways to the future:
     Concerning FidoNet, Usenet, and the Future of Public Access
     Wide Area Networking              -- Doug Thompson, 221/162


          It's New Years (actually a little past) and the time for a
     review of the past 365 days and some forecasts for the next.

          I initially sat down to write this the week *before* the
     Alternet announcement in Fidonews. That event, it seems, has
     suddenly eclipsed most other discussions and brought a number of
     major issues into sharp relief. I suppose thanks is due the
     Alternet folks -- and I can't help wonder if this might not be
     part of their intent?

          The very fact of a having a choice of a technically similar
     alternate network provides an impetus for FidoNet to come to
     grips with what it is, and what it is not. In an area of such
     phenomenal growth as wide area computer networking, we must
     wrestle just as seriously with what we are to become, and what we
     wish not to become.

          There are three things I want to talk about:

          1) Growth -- the Future
          2) Usenet Gateways
          3) Expanded public Services
          4) Our Financial Base

          1) Growth rates

          First some numbers.  The oldest nodelist I have is from May
     2, 1986. That's 19 months ago. (from time of writing, Dec. 86)

     May 2        1986      789
     June 19      1987     1523 + 13 mos
     Dec 18       1987     2275 + 6 mos

     Avg monthly growth rate May '86 June 87=   56.46 nodes per month
     Avg monthly growth rate June - Dec   86=  125.33 nodes per month

          Over the past 6 mos FidoNet has grown at the rate of 125.33
     nodes per month. If this rate continues for the next year, we
     will see nearly 4,000 nodes in FidoNet by next Christmas. The
     limited stats here also suggest that the rate of growth more than
     doubled between May of 86 and December of 87. If that increase in
     the rate of growth continues, we could conceivably find ourselves
     with five or six thousand nodes by next Christmas.

          FidoNet seems to be doubling in size roughly every year. If
     anyone has more thorough stats drop me a line!

          Tom Jennings' hobby in 1984 has grown beyond what I imagine
     were his wildest expectations at the time. It seems to be an idea
     whose time has come, and is being more widely recognized as a
     good idea all the time.

         -- Rapid growth means most of us are relative newcomers --

          Growth of this pace inevitably causes strains, and we see
     lots of those in FidoNet. Having had some academic training in
     history, I grew accustomed to looking at the "flow" of events
     over the years rather than simply isolated snapshots. Among other
     things shown by these stats is that at least half the sysops in
     FidoNet have been participating less than 18 months.  Given that
     there is a drop-out rate as well as a growth rate, it may be that
     about half have been participating less than one year and about
     75% less than two.  That makes the vast majority of us relative
     newcomers, and our view of FidoNet is short enough to be called a
     snapshot.  But let's try to develop some snapshots into a movie.
     The figures in use here are rough approximations.  We do seem to
     have an exponential growth curve though. At current growth rates,
     by 1990, we could well have 30,000 nodes!

          I am not saying this *will* happen for certain, but I am
     persuaded at the moment that it is likely to happen. Forces which
     will encourage continued growth include:

          - declining costs and increasing capabilities of hardware
          - better and more user friendly software and interfaces
            which help non-experts jump in.
          - recent expansion into new countries and new continents.
          - self-propulsion: e-mail's value increases with the number
            of people you can reach. The bigger the net becomes the
            more the incentive to join.
          - Gateways to other networks making FidoNet an access point
            to many other and larger networks.
          - faster modems which reduce phone bills, making
            communication cheaper.

          I want to think about the implications of some of these
     things.  Rapid growth means that we will continue to have a
     majority of sysops with relatively brief experience in the net.
     We will remain "amateur" in more ways than one.

          I want to think about what it means to move from a hobbyist
     playing with an idea that society at large doesn't understand to
     the role of an operator in a world-wide computer network which
     more and more people will be depending on as an important channel
     of communication.

          I want to think about the economics of this: who is going to
     be carrying the cost of this international communication, and who
     might become interested to try to build a private business around
     the idea?


          2) Usenet Gateways

          During 1987 a number of FidoNet systems installed software
     which enables the exchange of mail and echoes with another and
     much larger computer network, Usenet.

     FidoNews 5-03                Page 6                   18 Jan 1988


          Usenet consists of about 10,000 machines around the world.
     Technically, Usenet is very similar to Fidonet and therefore
     gateways are not all that difficult.  There are vast differences
     in the character of the two nets however.

          Hardware in Usenet tends to be large computers owned by
     universities or businesses. While there are a small number of AT
     class IBM micros involved, for the most part the machines are DEC
     Vax minis.  Owners are commercial or educational institutions and
     the operators are employees of those institutions. The users are
     usually members of those institutions.

          Unlike FidoNet, the communication work of these computers is
     often a very small part of the computer's purpose.  The computers
     usually have other reasons to exist, and the communication work
     is incidental. To the extent that the owners support Usenet
     participation, they do so because of a perceived benefit for
     their employees and/or students.

          There is a lot of overlap in the type of people attracted to
     the two nets, and a great commonality of purpose. The major
     difference is that while the typical FidoNet sysop is an
     owner-operator who is really accountable to no one (except to be
     able to receive mail), the typical Usenet system administrator is
     an employee of an institution responsible to the accountants and
     managers for the system use.  He is also very much more
     responsible to his users, they pay him to keep the news and mail
     flowing.

          In these respects there is quite a difference, FidoNet
     consisting of "free-agents", paying their own way, and Usenet
     consisting of "corporation men" who do it as a job (although they
     may well greatly enjoy it). Where a FidoNet sysop pays for his
     mail (usually) a Usenet user or operator is rarely personally
     charged.  The institution absorbs the costs as part of the
     overhead.

          Another major difference is that Usenent is big. Some 10,000
     machines, the smallest of which are on par with the largest
     FidoNet systems. Usenet also has gateways to other networks,
     including ArpaNet, Bitnet, CSNet, and other national and regional
     networks around the world. The total number of users who have
     access to e-mail on all these networks is very hard to estimate,
     but I am pretty sure it is in the millions when you consider all
     the nets to which Usenet gateways.

          Accustomed to gatewaying to other networks, Usenet sites
     generally seem reasonably receptive to installing FidoNet
     gateways.  The perception generally seems to be that the value of
     Usenet increases in proportion to the number of e-mail addresses
     that can be reached. Fidonet represents some tens of thousands of
     addressable users, and is therefore worthwhile.

          My experience in "grovelling" for a news and mail feed from
     a Usenet site at a local university illustrates some other issues
     which are probably of general relevance. I was aided in my effort
     FidoNews 5-03                Page 7                   18 Jan 1988


     by the fact that I personally knew some of the Usenet operators
     and had other campus affiliations. The major concerns of the
     Usenet people were financial and technical. "How much is this
     going to cost us?" They wanted to know what kind of controls, if
     any, there would be on e-mail sent to them for forwarding, on
     their dime.  The second concern was technical reliability; "will
     your gateway cause us any hassles?"

          After providing much in the way of personal guarantees, a
     gateway was approved, although it was clearly pointed out that
     the approval could be suspended at any time. This raised a number
     of concerns for me. The first had to do with accounting. If mail
     was going to be moving through my system in both directions, I
     had to keep track of how much it was costing me, and how much it
     was costing the Usenet host. The second concern was my users. If
     I gave them access to Usenet newsgroups, what kind of problems
     might arise?

          There were two concerns about the users. I suppose we've all
     had problems of naive users not understanding that an echo area
     is not for private messages to local users. And most of us have
     experienced the twit problem, a user who is needlessly abusive
     and enters inappropriate messages. Should such material get into
     Usenet, I would receive the flak. I found myself in the
     uncomfortable situation of being personally responsible to tens
     of thousands of Usenet readers for whatever anyone might do on my
     system, as well as being responsible for any errors I might make
     :-).

          Dealing with Usenet differs from dealing with FidoNet both
     in scale, and in the level of professionalism expected. Usenet
     operators are professionals. In dealing with Fidonet they expect
     a similar professional attitude. Expensive errors are costing not
     just a few dollars of *personal* money, but corporate or
     institutional money.  An inconvenience can effect hundreds or
     thousands of people on whose approval the Usenet administrator's
     *job* depends.

          Running a gateway stretches the definition of hobby to the
     limit.

          Another very critical difference between FidoNet and Usenet
     is revealed here, the users. FidoNet is accessible to virtually
     anyone with a terminal and modem. Usenet is only accessible to
     the public at a very few "public access Usenet" sites. My first
     networking experience was in Usenet. I was so keen on it, I
     wanted to extend the capability to everyone, and became
     interested in creating a public access system. FidoNet nodes
     running gateway software appeared to be the cheapest way to
     establish public access to Usenet.  A relatively friendly user
     interface existed in Fido and Opus BBS systems, PD software was
     available, and the hardware needed was affordable.

          3) Financing

          Some serious difficulties are revealed in opening access to
     FidoNews 5-03                Page 8                   18 Jan 1988


     the public. Usenet is free. However, "free", in this context
     simply means that someone else pays for it.  Presently no device
     exists to charge back to the user the cost of services rendered.
     This is not because systems cannot charge users on a per message
     or per hour basis, but because the costs of any given message may
     be borne by hundreds, even thousands of different systems.  A
     large circulation newsgroup may end up occupying clusters on
     10,000 or more hard-disks, and be telephoned to sites all over
     the world.  As in FidoNet, Usenet sites do not generally charge
     each other for service.  At the moment this is quite workable.
     However, each Usenet site has a ceiling, a ceiling on funds and
     cpu cycles and disk space for the network.  General public access
     could, if it did become popular, come to swamp the network.  This
     will not happen tomorrow.  But, if network growth continues, it
     is a real possibility.

          Long term growth and general public access can only be
     accommodated through a system of financing that allows for some
     cost recovery when providing telecommunication services to
     others.  At the moment, extending services costs money. There is
     thus a financial *disincentive* to expanding services. If there
     were even the slightest financial *incentive*, and the money to
     buy new boxes, service could be expected to expand more rapidly.

          I would like to be in a position to "buy into" usenet,
     rather than beg into it. I'd like to advertise my tiny "public
     access" system and let it reach capacity. I'd like to be able to
     earn enough money from that user public to buy more machines and
     install more phone lines and bigger hard-disks. I'd like to know
     that in using the services of other systems, in Usenent and in
     FidoNet I was paying my way *and* making a financial contribution
     to those other services, and not stuck in a dependency
     relationship where every message was transferred as a favour.

          In short I'd like to see the system opened up, and service
     expanded. This cannot happen under current financing arrangements,
     where every expansion is a financial burden which must be
     limited.

          Reciprocity is basically the name of the network game. Each
     independent node or site in both networks provides value to
     others.  Some pay more than others, but it is in all our best
     interests to keep the connections open as best we can. The
     network's value *is* a function of how many people you can reach
     .  .  .  up to the saturation point.

          That saturation point worries me. With continued growth,
     traffic volume in echo mail (newsgroups in Usenent) will come to
     exceed the storage and throughput capacity of all but the largest
     systems.  Newsgroups also seem to have a maximum participation
     rate.  When the traffic volume in a newsgroup reaches hundreds of
     messages per day, it is impossible to keep up without some new
     kind of sophisticated "screening" software. The best one to date
     is the moderated "Digest". In this model, a moderator receives
     all submissions, and compiles them into a digest which is very
     similar in appearance and size to FidoNews. Unlike FidoNews,
     FidoNews 5-03                Page 9                   18 Jan 1988


     Usenet moderators usually cull inappropriate material (and often
     announce that they have done so).

          Optimizing the use of resources, and sharing the cost burden
     of expanded resources, can do much to increase the network
     capacity with minimum resource allocation. The price of that
     cooperation is a certain amount of autonomy.  A site cannot
     participate in a wide area cost-sharing plan to operate and
     manage collective resources without sacrificing a little
     autonomy.  Without that cooperation, however, many economies
     cannot be realized.  With it, the cost of inter-continental
     e-mail should drop to a few pennies per message.  The fee is
     nearly insignificant to the individual user.  The cost to
     individual gateway and zonegate systems, though, is crushing.

          I am not the first one to point out that continued growth
     will require centralized "network" services, rather than simply
     "site" services. Large machines with large disks and fast modems
     could be subsidized by the respective networks as store and
     forward facilities for mail. The use of leased lines and batched
     processing could bring the cost of reliable net-mail down to the
     vanishing point. But achieving those savings requires consider-
     able capital and a lot of labour.

          Individual sites could then subscribe directly, or groups of
     sites in a geographic area could pool their resources for a
     routed link to a central machine.

          In this manner, a skeletal device would be created whereby
     the actual costs of providing efficient services could be
     recovered.  It seems obvious that the funding and labour
     necessary to expand facilities to meet ever-increasing demand
     will exceed the capacity of individual site and node operators.
     There would also be a great deal more incentive for operators at
     every level to provide better service if the bulk of the costs
     were being borne by a large group of users, rather than the
     individual operator himself.

          One other fringe benefit -- based on the experience of
     Usenet -- an employee responsible to the net for his job is
     likely to provide a consistently high level of professionalism in
     network services.

          It would appear that the next few years will require us to
     solve these problems one way or another. The only alternative
     would seem to be to attempt to create a device to carefully limit
     the size of the network, and restrict access to a select few.
     While any particular network *could* do this, the public demand
     for electronic mail is unlikely to abate until virtually every
     phone line in the world has a telecommunication computer attached
     to it.

          Read that last sentence again.

          A question which concerns me greatly is that of addressing
     the issue of *organizing* and *financing* a public access e-mail
     FidoNews 5-03                Page 10                  18 Jan 1988


     network.  There appear to be two possible routes.

          One is commercial. Where there is a public demand, there
     will be businesses which attempt to meet that demand. The other,
     already foreshadowed to some degree in both Usenent and Fidonet,
     is the idea of a publicly owned, cooperatively managed,
     self-financing network.  The latter differs from the former in a
     number of ways.  While the end-product of the two might be quite
     similar, the public system is owned by the public, and its owners
     control it. Instead of subscribers, or customers, the user is a
     participant -- a citizen of the net, if you will -- rather than a
     customer of a service industry.

          A public network could provide a huge scope for volunteer
     participation. In doing so it would encourage innovation and
     reduce overall network expenses. Both these attributes would not
     only preserve some of the flavour of the amateur e-mail network
     we have grown to know and love, but would enable a public network
     to provide service at a cost well below that which a commercial
     enterprise would have to charge.

          The days of FidoNet being a small, exclusive club of
     dedicated hobbyists are numbered. The network is too good, too
     popular, too successful. Many who are not computer buffs in any
     real way now want in in order to *communicate*.

          It seems to me rather clear that some years down the line
     there will be an international wide-area networking system which
     is accessible to anyone for a fee. Either the present telecom
     using public will create it and keep it under public ownership
     (while keeping fees to a minimum) or private enterprise will
     provide it as a consumer service (maximizing profit, of course).


          -- Public vs. Private is not the same as Fee vs. Free --


          Why would a public, co-operatively owned system be better
     than a commercial one? This slips over into political philosophy,
     but there are a few things worth considering.

          1.) Because it doesn't have to earn a profit, it should be
     able to provide cheaper service.

          2.) Being already owned by the general public, it should be
     freer of government regulation than a strictly commercial
     enterprise.

          3.) Adverse government regulations will be less likely when
     the owners of the telecom utility and the voting public are
     precisely the same people.

          4.) Public control of network policy is much more likely to
     be meaningful under public ownership.

          5.) The user, rather than being a consumer whose only power
     FidoNews 5-03                Page 11                  18 Jan 1988


     is to not subscribe, becomes a full and equal participant, as
     active as s/he cares to be.

          6.) Continued dependence on a large amount of voluntarism
     could well not only encourage innovation and development but keep
     user fees absurdly low.

          7.) As the network grows in size, its influence in the
     computer industry and over government regulation nationally and
     internationally will also grow. In an age when high technology
     and regulatory decision-making is more and more removed from the
     ordinary life of the ordinary citizen, this would counter-balance
     present tendancies toward technological elitism and dependence on
     government "experts" to tell us what's good for us. The end-user
     would have a much larger influence.

          I guess my bias is out of the bag now :-)

          I am *very* much aware that many different perspectives
     exist on the large number of specific matters this paper touches
     upon.  My view is only one, and I'm not sure it is even the best.
     Too many of the discussions on these matters I've read and
     participated in seem to occur without an historical overview. I
     hope this paper can contribute to our thinking about where we are
     going in terms beyond simply "more of the same". The character of
     the network will inevitably change with growth, and with changing
     technology.  We do not have the luxury of choosing to keep things
     just as they are.  Events will overtake us and change our network
     whatever we choose to do, or not do.

          If a commercial service comes along, for instance, that
     offers access to news and e-mail cheaper than FidoNet itself,
     (distinctly possible) what point will there be to an amateur
     e-mail network?

          There is no such thing as "free" e-mail. There is only
     e-mail which you get someone else to pay for, or e-mail which you
     pay for yourself. Currently, the costs in FidoNet are very un-
     evenly distributed, and we depend not only on large volunteer
     efforts, but on large volunteer financial contributions. A big
     network, paid for only by a few of its most important links, does
     not strike me as having much potential

          I cannot begin to take the space to address each of the many
     reservations I can already hear being expressed. I can offer some
     points of departure for discussion, though.

          An International FidoNet co-op, funded by its members, could
     do two things almost immediately: it could provide cheap central-
     ized services such as echo-mail and software backbones and zone-
     gates.  It could begin to build an organizational infrastructure
     to reflect the will of the membership and influence the future of
     wide-area telecommunication.

          The latter involves many, many aspects, and could include
     such things as negotiations with other networks and standard-
     FidoNews 5-03                Page 12                  18 Jan 1988


     ization of gateway structures to assure universal access,
     negotiation with hardware manufacturers concerning standards and
     bulk discounts, establishing policies to prevent discrimination,
     injustice, and abuse, provide legal advocacy and defence in the
     murky waters of BBS liability, promote the expansion of network
     links to new parts of the world, sponsor public education efforts
     to promote intelligent use of e-mail and tele-conferencing,
     sponsor promising research in new areas, coordinate research
     internationally, liase with commerical and educational institu-
     tions where mutual benefit might accrue, study ways in which
     network services might be "sold" to subsidize cheap private
     correspondence, work toward international telecommunication
     standards and freedom of communication in other parts of the
     world .  .  .  etc.  etc.  etc.  And all in the name of the
     public, the public good, and the public's access to information,
     rather than solely in the name of profit, control, and restric-
     tion.

          There are some who would say that IFNA, with its elected
     Board, and wide-ranging, though largely undefined responsibility
     for the net could be that International Network Co-Op. I guess
     I'm one.

          We're riding a fast-rolling snowball here in FidoNet today.
     It's been five years since Tom Jennings' first preposterous
     experiments, and nine years since Usenent's first two sites made
     that first phone call. The snowflake has become a large snowball
     accelerating down the hill. What may be less apparent is that
     this snowball is on its way to becoming an avalanche.

          As we debate these matters I would really like people to
     devote 1% of their thought to where we might be in ten, twenty or
     thirty years.

          Forgive me for taking so long, if you have grown bored, and
     forgive me for leaving so much out, if you are still interested.
     In future weeks I hope to take time to probe some of the issues
     touched on here in greater detail (depending on the response to
     this piece).

     Larry A. DiGioia
     Sysop NEVERBOARD 129/17, Alternet 522/2



                     ALTERNET: It might have worked...

        When I first saw the announcements for ALTERNET, I was
     overjoyed. This was what I had been waiting for. A network
     devoted to the "hobbyist spirit." Devoid of all of the silly
     politics and petty bickering that has become a part of our
     present network... I particularly admire the PEOPLE who took
     the initiative and declared their independence. Because after
     all, what is a network except a group of PEOPLE?

        I looked forward to seeing all my friends, both locally and
     nationally, in the new network. In fact, I did see some of them
     in the alternet nodelists that started trickling out. My old NC,
     a person who has helped me a lot these past years and whose
     opinion I have always respected, was also among the first to
     "jump on the bandwagon."

        I never in a million years expected that a group of sysops,
     most of whom spend THOUSANDS of dollars on hardware and phone
     bills, would go COMPLETELY BONKERS over a proposed $20 a year
     membership fee.

        OK, fine. They didn't have to join. That was the choice:
     ALTERNET is an ALTERNATIVE. They were free to stick with the
     existing network, and not worry themselves to death about what
     some of us others CHOSE to join. But no-o-o-o-o....  Then the
     great, unseen network people started getting together on the
     subject. They too, objected to the fee. These are the people
     who run multi-line systems with multiple 9600 modems... I guess
     they had pictures of ALTERNET coordinators driving off into the
     sunset in Cadillacs bought with the poor, unsuspecting sysop's
     hard-earned $20.

        So, what do they do? Why of course, refuse echomail feeds to
     anyone on the ALTERNET nodelist! What this really comes down to,
     of course, is the same old thing: personality conflicts. It
     isn't really the $20 that most people object to; it's the PEOPLE
     in ALTERNET. Many have had the honesty to come out and say as
     much.

        So, we are being persecuted. The "powers that be" (and don't
     think for a minute that I mean the IFNA) have decided that they
     will do their best to prevent their old partners-in-argument
     from doing something new, simple and exciting. Unfortunately,
     they have the power to succeed, by the time-honored methods of
     misinformation, character assasination and innuendo. They have
     succeeded in shaping "popular opinion" to their own opinions.

        None of this would matter to me if the callers to my board
     had not gotten used to the excellent conversation and exchanges
     of help and information that is provided by the wonderful links
     FidoNews 5-03                Page 14                  18 Jan 1988


     of echomail. But you see, even if ALTERNET were composed of "the
     cream of the BBS community," (which some might say it is,) it
     would still not provide my callers with the variety of help and
     discussion that the "old boy" network does now. And I no longer
     have the choice to keep "the best of both worlds."  So, sadly, I
     must say goodbye to the pioneering people such as Thom, Ryugen,
     and all the others who bring a breath of fresh air to this world
     of ours. I wish them all the best of luck, in the pursuit of
     something even better than we have now.

     WHAT IS OZONE.EXE
     =================

     OZONE is a crude but useful utility designed to make the
     incorporation of the Anetlist into the Nodelist.

     Using Xlatlist 2.85 you can add nodes from the Anetlist
     into the nodelist using the OZONE statement in the control
     file you use with Xlatlist.

     However, as the Anetlist gets larger, this will mean
     adding new entries by hand. So OZONE.EXE was born to help
     in making this task easier.

     OZONE.EXE will read the Anetlist and produce a straight
     text file you can add to the Xlatlist.ctl file. It saves
     you from typing in new OZONE statements each week.


     HOW DO I RUN OZONE.EXE
     ======================

     Simply type OZONE ANETLIST.XXX with XXX being the number
     of the Anetlist you wish to process. The resulting text
     file will be produced and called OZONE.LST in the same
     directory.

     Please be sure OZONE.EXE and ANETLIST.XXX are in the SAME
     directory. OZONE does not in any way alter either the
     Anetlist or the Nodelist.


     WHERE CAN I GET OZONE.EXE
     =========================

     You can either file request it from 107/246 or download
     it from that same board. The request name is OZONE and
     will be honored at all times except NMH and the hour
     before and after NMH.


     DO I HAVE TO PAY TO USE OZONE.EXE
     =================================

     No payment is required. This utility will only be
     used for a short period of time so no payment is required
     or expected.

     Here are the latest patches for Quick Basic 4.0. The
     first one is to eliminate the DTR problem encountered
     when running a Quick Basic program.

     DEBUG BCOM40.LIB

     -D 100 L 5
     xxxx:0100

     Take the first <3> numbers of 'xxxx' and add 85.

     Example:  if you had something like  114F:0100  then
     you would add 85 to 114 and get 199.

     The new number you come up with will be 'yyy'.

     -S yyy0:0 FFFF 83 C2 04 32 C0

     DEBUG will now give TWO locations where these bytes
     are located. Lets call the first address  xxxx:yyyy

     -U xxxx:yyyy L 6

     You should see three lines. The  'xxxx:yyyy' should be
     represented by an 'XOR AL AL'

     -A xxxx:yyyy
     xxxx:yyyy MOV AL, 1  (hit enter here)

     Now repeat the process with the other number.  (starting
     at the U command) After you have done that, be sure to
     save the file:

     -W
     Writing xxxx bytes
     -Q

     And there you have it!

     Here is the recipe to remove the HALT which
     QuickBASIC executes when an unrecoverable error is

     QB. However this may serve as a guide for future
     versions of QB.

     Once you have done this now comes the fun part of re-

     this next patch is for you. This patch takes effect
     immediately and requires no re-compilation of your
