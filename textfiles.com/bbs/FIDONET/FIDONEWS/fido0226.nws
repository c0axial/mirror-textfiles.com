        We may be getting some power soon.  I'm hearing rumors that 
        a "FidoPAC" is in its first stages of birth.

        For those of you who are unfamiliar with politics (as I 
        pretty much am myself), a PAC is a Political Action 
        Committee.  I gather that they lobby for specific issues, 
        make campaign contributions, and so forth.

        With this in mind, a FidoPAC sounds like a pretty good idea.  
        It's sure as taxes (literally) that the guys in Washigton 
        are going to be passing laws which affect us.  It's only 
        common sense that we should try to provide our input into 
        that lawmaking process.

        There's a small catch, though.  Anything like this takes 
        both manpower and money; mainly money.  Now don't scream, 
        we're not talking hugh amounts.  True, an effective PAC 
        needs a fair sized war chest, but divided out among us all 
        it shouldn't be that much.

        And no, this is not an appeal for money.  I just want to get

        you used to the idea.  Whenever things start moving on this 
        I'm sure you'll hear about it.  So start thinking about it 
        now, and be ready to unlimber your checkbook when the time 
        comes.

        The real question, of course, is how effective anything like 
        this can be.  I think it can be pretty powerful; especially 
        if backed up by a strong show of support from the user 
        community.  This, too, may get easier.

        We are all of us so used to keying in our messages on boards 
        or on the net that it becomes a real nuisance to have to 
        actually print something out and put a stamp on it.  But I'm 
        also told that a Senator may soon be setting up a Fido of 
        his own.  This means you could express your support merely 
        by entering a message as usual.  In fact, if we ever do get 
        any politicos on the net I'd suggest that all sysops donate 
        phone charges by setting the message cost to zero.

        I know I'm horrible about writing letters, but pretty good 
        about sending netmail.  I'm sure many or most of you are the 
        same way.  I'd so much like to get a congresscritter on the 
        net that I'd donate a copy of our mail system to them if 
        they'd promise to use it.

        So things may start happening soon.  Someone somewhere found 
        an organizer for this sort of thing, which is what we need 
        the most right now.  Just be ready to do your part once the 
        ball starts rolling.

                                  NEWS
        ============================================================
        From: David Horowitz (Fido 107/2)

        More on software piracy...

        Yes, yet another person has decided to put there  two  cents
        into  this issue.  Now before you Control-C, lets just set a
        few facts straight...

        Software piracy is STEALING!  Yes, a crime.  Now as far as I
        know  no one has gone to jail yet, but it is no less a crime
        than walking out of your office with a typewriter.

        If you walked into your  local  department  store  with  the
        intent  of  purchasing  a TV.  Color, 25", stereo, and cable
        ready.  You ask the salesman "how much?".  Common  question,
        right?    He  says,  "Eleven Hundred Forty Nine Fifty".  You
        say, "Are you crazy?".  We all know that a state of the  art
        TV  is  expensive,  but  we  don't steal it because we can't
        afford it, now do we?

        Now, a little more on why software costs what it does...

        Let's take a look  at  what  it  might  cost  to  develop  a
        program.    Since  Lotus is the hot issue on price, and they
        probably have spent more than most, we will use it.   Now  I
        do  not  know exactly what things cost, but I hope these are
        fair estimates.

        Initial Idea.  The cost is  time.    Now  time  can  not  be
        measured  in  dollars  per say, but what about the fact that
        while you are thinking about it you  are  not  earning  any-
        thing.    Now  I know that the inventor of Lotus 123 got the
        idea in college.  He wrote a marketing paper on it.   Got  a
        "B"  on  it  too, why?  He professor said that the paper was
        good but would not sell.  And that the  author  did  not  do
        enough marketing research.  Now that's a laugh.

        Development.  How long?  For a program like  lotus  I  would
        have  to  say  one  year  at  a  minimum.  Now here come the
        megabucks...

        A staff of programmers.  Making $30,000+ a year.  So, to  be
        fair  lets  say  6  programmers.   That's $180,000.  Now you
        can't just let 6 programmers do what  they  want,  you  need
        managers.    Systems Analysts, or what ever you want to call
        them.  They earn  more.    So,  two  at  $45,000.    Another
        $90,000.

        Ok now you have spent  $270,000.    You  need  to  test  the
        product,  and then debug it.  You need to hire testers.  Now
        Lotus 123 was thought to be used by financial experts.  They
        would  have to test it.  They earn on the order of $25,000 -
        $30,000 a year.  So, two  for  two  months,  that's  $9,000.
        Now,  they  are  sure to find bugs.  Another three months of







FIDONEWS     --           12 Aug 85  00:01:56           Page 4

        work easy.  Buy now you might have put some of the man power
        on  another  project,  so 2 programmers, and one manager for
        two months...  $17,500.

        Now lets just total up to see what it might cost to  develop
        Lotus  123.   Now remember at this point the inventor has no
        guarantee that the product will ever sell, and in fact  only
        received  a  'B'  on his paper, because a supposed marketing
        expert said it would not ever sell...  $296,500.

        Nearly Three hundred thousand dollars!  And not one penny in
        return.   A substantial risk, I don't think there can be any
        argument here.

        Now as already stated, your investment  is  just  beginning.
        You  have  to market your product.  Now I can not even begin
        to imagine how much money went to promote 123.   I  remember
        prime  time  TV  adds.  They cost a bundle!  So, lets pick a
        number that no one would  argue  over.    Another  $500,000.
        Remember  full  page magazine adds cost too.  And Lotus went
        on an advertizing blitz for a while.

        Ok, So, Lotus Development spent nearly one millon dollars to
        develop  this  program.   They put a price of $500.00 on it,
        how many copies did they have to sell to break even.   2,000
        copies.   Now I think you might even agree that my estimates
        on development  are  quite  fair,  and  I  did  not  include
        packaging!

        True Lotus sold  more  than  2,000  copies,  but  could  you
        guarantee  this,  would  YOU  put  up the millon dollars?  I
        think the profits they are making are very fair, it  is  the
        American Dream!

        A Short History of Adventure Games
        ----------------------------------

            415-982-4591  (voice)

             You probably realize that there is a whole class or 
        genre of computer games called "adventure games." The genre, 
        of course, was itself based on role-playing games, 
        particularly Dungeons and Dragons, a game developed in 1974 
        by Gary Gygax, who formed TSR.  

             The grandfather of all adventure games was called 
        simply "ADVENTURE," and took place in "Collossal Cave." It 
        was written by Will Crowther and Don Woods on a DEC PDP-10 
        in FORTRAN. To win the game, one had to capture a bird, 
        dispose of a nasty snake, avoid a dwarf's pointy knives, and 
        figure out what toll a troll wanted to cross a bridge, among 
        many other hazards; the rewards were many but usually had to 
        be sacrificed in order to obtain some other goal.  

             The game was quite successful -- partly because it was 
        virtually the only game available and partly because it was 
        free -- and was quickly copied onto many large timesharing 
        systems at universities and companies.  Many hours were 
        spent translating the game so it could run on many 
        mainframes and microcomputers. Other programmers wrote 
        extensions into the game, adding new rooms, hazards, and 
        treasures.  There are now two popular versions: very few 
        people ever solve the entire original 350- or 375-point 
        Adventure, although a few have even conquered the 550-point 
        extended version.  

             While some programmers were satisfied by solving, 
        translating, or adding to the original Adventure, others saw 
        an opportunity for new games, on microcomputers as well as 
        mainframes. Some -- like Scott Adams at Adventure 
        International -- chose to add graphics to their adventures.  
        Some had very limited vocabularies and tight, simple 
        grammers like the original adventure: you could "EAT BIRD" 
        or "ATTACK TROLL," nothing more complex. Other programmers 
        sought more natural language and more powerful and complex 
        features: Infocom's Zork trilogy -- a variant on the 
        original Adventure -- and that company's many follow-up text 
        adventures (they, and others, accurately call their works 
        "interactive fiction") use a complex vocabulary and permit 
        very long and complex sentences.

             On the earliest microcomputers -- like the S-100 
        machines, the TRS-80 Model I and the Apple II -- adventure 
        games were the first programs to be made available because 
        they used only text and were written in standard languages, 
        usually BASIC, and were thus easiest to translate.  

             Several efforts have been made to write "adventure game 
        generators," programs which would ask for input detailing 
        the arrangement of an adventure and then generate a BASIC 
        program for the scenario.  Unfortunately, these generators 
        too often were not complex enough to generate powerful 
        adventures, or were too complex to use for someone who 
        didn't want to learn a programming language in the first 
        place.  

        --------------     
        Enter G.A.G.S. 
        --------------     
        The Generic Adventure Game System* was written in an 
        effort to make writing an adventure game as simple as 
        possible, while still permitting a great deal of 
        flexibility. It *cannot* be used to write an adventure game 
        with as many complex features as Infocom's. To do so would 
        require developing a complete adventure game programming 
        language, as Infocom has done, and would require adventure-
        game writers to learn a very complex set of rules.  

             [Note: developing ANY playable, enjoyable adventure 
        game takes time.  You need to set up a map, and then type in 
        the valid movements from room to room and the full text 
        descriptions for each room, noun, and creature.  While using 
        G.A.G.S. is far less complex than writing an adventure game 
        from scratch in Pascal or any other language, it will still 
        take you many hours to write a game using G.A.G.S.] 

             There are two clear advantages to the Generic Adventure 
        Game System (G.A.G.S.). First, G.A.G.S. uses a standard-
        format ASCII text file for its data, and the adventure game 
        can be modified simply by editing the data file with any 
        text editor. Debugging the game involves playing it: as 
        problems are discovered, the text file can be edited and the 
        game re-played. Once a basic game is developed, it can be 
        extended by adding new rooms or special features (much the 
        same way Adventure was enhanced).  

             Second, G.A.G.S. is infinitely expandable because the 
        complete Turbo Pascal* source code is available. If you 
        decide that another verb should be available, you can add 
        it. If you think the parser is too simple, you can try to 
        patch it -- or completely re-write it. By modifying the 
        source code, you can add new features to the game which 
        aren't available in the basic system. (Of course, modifying 
        the source code could lead to week-long debugging sessions 
        while you try to figure out why this particular procedure is 
        infinitely recursive or why the disk is reformatted whenever 
        you try to move east.) The GAGS manual explains how the 
        source code was written and why, and suggests a number of

        modifications that can be made.  

        -------------------
        How to Get G.A.G.S.
        -------------------
             The Generic Adventure Game System (G.A.G.S.) is 
        currently in beta-test. Version 1.0 will be available on 
        September 1, 1985, and will be distributed as "Shareware" 
        (or "User-Supported Software"). Users may freely copy and 
        share the program, but are asked to become registered users 
        by sending $15 to the author, thus encouraging the author to 
        release updates and new software as Shareware -- as well as 
        obtaining limited techincal telephone support.  

             Copies of G.A.G.S. will be sent to many users' groups 
        and computer bulletin-board systems. The complete G.A.G.S. 
        disk will also be available for $10 from the author. 
        (California residents must add appropriate sales tax.) The 
        complete source code to G.A.G.S. will be available to 
        registered users for $25.  

             G.A.G.S. requires a 8088- or 8086-based computer, MS-
        DOS 2.1 and 256K bytes of memory.  It is available from the 
        author only on 5-1/4-inch disks.

        Further Reading
        ---------------
        Several books are available on writing your own adventure 
        game: 

        Tim Hartnell, "Creating Adventure Games on Your Home 
        Computer" (in Microsoft BASIC), Ballantine/Random House, 
        1984.

        in (UCSD) Pascal," TAB Books, 1984.  

        Frank DaCosta, "Writing BASIC Adventure Programs for the 
        TRS-80" (Model I/III/IV), TAB Books, 1982.  


        Another adventure-game generator program is available for 
        free.  Pete Levy has posted a copy of the "Levy Adventure 
        Development System" (LADS) on the Games SIG on CompuServe 
        (GO GAM-310). It's written in BASIC for the TRS-80 Model I 
        and III.

                This is an update to an article published in the
        FIDONEWS about a month ago.  In that article I stated that
        I was working on a Fido clone, and was starting with the
        message area.  Well, the message area is now complete, and
        can be used from the console just like Fido in test mode.
        The current version is now called ROVERMSG instead of ROVER.
        This is because the full emulation system is going to be
        called ROVER, but I could see no reason why I should not
        continue to have the message base be a standalone program.
        Anyway, for those of you who have been using ROVER, the
        current version is 1.6 (August 8, 1985), please call my
        board and download the latest version.  Thanks to all
        of you who have helped in the debugging process.

                Now on to more specifics.  ROVERMSG now is a more
        or less full emulation of the Fido message system.  The
        only differences have to do with parsing of input at
        certain points.  Since the ROVERMSG parser is very small
        and simple, it cannot do some of the things that Fido does.
        The differences are minimal, and probably will not be
        noticed by 99% of its users.  The good news is that I have
        added some functionality where it was needed most.  I allow
        command line arguments to be set in an environment variable
        so that a long command line does not have to be typed each
        time the program is run.  I also allow the user to use his
        favorite editor to edit messages, rather than the simple
        Fido line editor (although that also exists in ROVERMSG).
        Basically, at this point ROVERMSG is finished and I am
        working on the rest of ROVER.

                Work on the rest of ROVER is also proceeding
        smoothly.  Currently all of the menus can be reached, but
        most of the options do nothing yet.  Also, there is no
        support for using the COM ports.  I am very interested in
        hearing from people that have public domain code for all
        of the different file transfer protocols for the file area.
        If anyone could send me the code for XMODEM, YMODEM, MODEM7,
        KERMIT, TELINK, etc. I would really appreciate it.  Please,
        if you FidoNet it to me, try to make the name of the file
        something original (I would hate to have one person's
        XMODEM.C get overwritten by another).  I am particularly
        interested in code that is written in C, but I will take
        ASM or PASCAL also.

                Finally, anyone interested in beta-testing the
        full-blown ROVER from the console (use it like in test mode

        and see if it does what you expect), please contact me.  The
        beta-testers for ROVERMSG have done a GREAT job, and if any
        of you would like to continue testing ROVER, just let me
        know.

        Sam was your average 15 year old American
        teenager, except for one thing, he had a
        computer and a nack to get into things he
        wasn't supposed to get into.  He would charge
        his peers to get into the schools computer and
        change grades. $10 for a D, $15 for a C, $20
        for a B, $25 for an A and $100 a shot for
        credit changes.  He did have on policy though,
        he would not look at someones grades unless he
        was paid for it and said they wanted it
        changed.
        One day sam went to far! He dropped the credir
        rating of his english teacher because she
        flunked him on purpose becasue he wasn't one
        of her favorites. After he did this he swithed
        his grade and went to bed.  The next morning
        he heard the front door bell.
        "OPEN UP it's the FBI" came a demanding voice.
        "oh well" sighed sam "they got me"
        He opend the door to find his best friend
        standing in the doorway.
        "Whatcha trying to do?" yelled Sam "give me a
        heartatack!?!"
        "nahhhh" replied Bob "Just came over to tell
        you that my mom said out English 1 teacher was
        in the store and couldn't buy a dress because
        her credit ratings had been slashed" bob
        continued
        "hmmmmm wonder who could have done that?" Sam
        replied stupidly
        "When are you gonna give this crap up?!?"
        asked Bob
        "In time" sighed Sam "in time"
        "I just hope the she doesn't put 1 and 1
        together and get Sam Sulivan!" stated Bob
        "She won't! she has no more brains that a
        donkey!"said Sam hotly
        "Maybe, but I wouldn't be to sure." Bob said
        solemly
        Sure enough that afternoon the password to the
        banks computer didn't work and the five
        O'clock news a small blurb about the fact that
        the banks computer had been broken into. Sam
        wolfed down his dinner and ran to Bob's house
        and asked what he sould do.
        "Welllllll" said Bob " lay off for awhile,
        let things blow over." Sam did this for about
        two weeks but ended up getting back into it.
        A student at his school heard about his
        service and paid him $50 to change two grades
        from B's to A's.  Well as you can guess Sam
        was caught.   At 18 the only thing he does
        with his computer is his homework and
        programing.  He does no more hacking.  He
        wishes that he would have never started but
        now it is to late.  Now in his spare time he
        tries to explain to young hackers what their

        doing might be fun, but it is dangerous and
        there are high risks.
        This story isn't true but it has probably
        happened a hundred times all ready.  If you
        know of someone doing this please stop them
        now, and explain to them what they are doing

             Some observations on long distance phone services

             Those of you who actually read the  nodelist  distribu-
        tions  may  have noticed that the phone number for the Wash-
        A-RUG FIDO (109/483) was recently changed to (703) 359-6549.
        The  reasons  behind the change may cause you to think twice
        before chosing an alternative long distance service.

             The both phone lines are provided by Hadron Inc.  (they
        pay  for my computer habits). The original line went through
        the office PBX system (no big deal) and  was  working  fine.
        At least that is what I thought, until I saw the first phone
        bill.

             Our PBX make use of a computerized call routing scheme.
        In  theory,  it  will select the lowest cost carrier for all
        long distance calls.  It also seems that  the  service  used
        for  all  calls  west  of  the Mississippi is SBS.  Again it
        would appear to be no big deal.  FIDO bundles  up  the  mes-
        sages  to  save time and money, and the routing optimization
        further reduces the costs.  Right?  Well, that  was  what  I
        thought.  Seems that "Murphy" (never forget him!) was out to
        prove otherwise.  For a few nights last month, FIDO  109/483
        was  unable to connect to FIDO 100/22 to deliver a file.  No
        big deal, FIDONET tries to connect 20 times and  then  gives
        up till the next night.  All told, total of 40 attempts over
        2 night, with only one connect that lasted 45  seconds.   No
        big deal.  WRONG!  Seems that SBS is unable to differentiate
        a call that completes from a call  that  does  not  connect.
        That  means 40 calls at $0.30 each!  If you extend that over
        a month or so, you can see that the nonconnecting calls  can
        wind up being more expensive than the one that get through.

             So, I got another phone line for Wash-A-RUG.  It is  an
        external  AT&T long-line, with no call optimization to muddy
        the waters.  As a side benefit, the new line  has  consider-
        ably  less  noise  on  it.   The  old  number still answers,
        although the amount of noise introduced by the call forward-
        ing is horrendous.

             The moral to the story? Check out your alternative long
        distance  services  carefully.  And NEVER forget that Murphy
        is out there, lurking in the shadows, just waiting to prove

                    "If anything can go wrong, it will"

             For those of you that use [*shudder*] Wordstar on your
        PCs, here are a few suggestions having to do with editing
        and printing Fido-format documents (those following the
        standard format of Fidonews and the various manuals).
             This comes as a result of my trials and tribulations
        experienced in downloading and printing the entire to-date
        library  of Fidonews and the Fido manual...  and my attempts 
        to  gather them into an easily handled format  - loose  leaf 
        binders.
             I don't know how the format that Fidonews (and manuals) 
        use was arrived at,  but I assume that it was in order to be 
        able to quickly use the DOS "TYPE" command to scan or print.
             Indeed, this works out rather well, except for two
        things that can't be done easily : format the page so that
        the punch holes don't chew up words, and print using printer
        control commands like doublestrike, LQ mode, etc.
             The following was arrived at using Wordstar vers. 3.3
        and an Epson FX-80 printer. It allows me to print documents
        on continuous feed paper and leave room on the left for
        punch holes.
             Start Wordstar and call in the document to edit it. 
        Make sure your cursor is at the beginning of file, usually
        on the "F" in the word Fidonews on page one (if that's what
        you're working with). Now put in any print-control commands
        you might want.
             Next set your margins. I use left= column 5 , right=
        column 85. It's important to maintain the 80 column
        difference between the two... you might want to set each one
        proportionally higher or lower depending on how much room
        you want to leave on the left... I would think, though that
        with the left at more than 10 you'd start to lose text off
        the right side of the page.
             Now just do a ^QQB to start continuous paragraph
        reformatting, and hit the number 1 after it starts to speed
        it up. When it gets to the end of the file, hit the space
        bar to stop, and save it with ^KD... you can even be doing
        all this while you're printing the last one - but don't set
        the reformat speed faster than 5 or so, or the printer slows
        down.

                           CopyX is now available

        CopyX.com is a comprehensive, user friendly Fido maintenance 
        utility featuring pop-up windows,  designed  to  reduce  the 
        amount of time required to maintain files.bbs 

        The COPY function employed within the program allow files to 
        be  moved  from  one  disk.  or subdirectory to another with 
        overwrite protection.  This is nothing special  about  this, 
        but  what  makes  CopyX.com  special is that it allow you to 
        enter the file description and after the file is  copied  it 
        appends  files.bbs with the file name and description.  Then 
        prompts you to delete to original.  For example  to  copy  a 
        file from your upload area to your sysop area you would: 

        1-enter file name      >copyxdmo.com
        2-give the file path   >b:\bbs\sysop
        3-describe f       >Demo of CopyX the ultimate sysop utility
        4-delete original      >y

        That's it,  the file is now in the sysop area, the files.bbs 
        listing has been updated, and the original has been removed.  
        Time required 30 - 45 sec. Not bad ah ?  
         
        When using  the  file  compare  function,  CopyX  will  read 
        through files.bbs and compare it to the directory listing if 
        it  finds  any  `missing' files it prompts you to remove the 
        line from files.bbs (y/n)  .  If  files  are  found  in  the 
        directory  that  are  not  in  files.bbs you can add them by 
        pressing a single key, then entering the description.  Other 
        options are skipping  the  file  or  deleting  it  from  the 
        directory.  
         
        To  round  out  the package a separate function allow you to 
        scroll through files.bbs a line at a  time,  deleting  files 
        (and  description)  or  adding/changing there description as 
        you go.  

        Additional   supporting  functions  include  displaying  the 
        directory,  listing files.bbs (or any other text  file)  and 
        changing drives.  
         
        CopyX  is  currently being distributed in two versions.  The 
        first CopyXdmo is a demonstration version in which users are 
        encouraged to distribute freely to their friends  and  other 
        bbs  operators.  I hope that it will be available on all the 
        major fido BBSs.  The demo version is identical to the  real 
        version except that it will not save data to files.bbs.  
         
        This  program can save you hours of work.  If you value your 
        time at more then $ .50 per hour, you need this program.  To 
        order send $25.00 to the address listed below.

        It is with great sorrow that we must announce the death of 
        Andrew Fluegelman.  

        We have almost no details at this time, except for 
        confirmation of his death, apparently by suicide.  We had 
        hoped to get someone closer to the scene to provide some 
        details, and we tried to find someone who knew him to write 
        a proper obituary, but as yet we have failed.

        We never knew Mr. Fluegelman, or even very much about him.  
        We do know that he has exerted a profound influence on the 
        personal computer marketplace.  He is probably best known as 
        the author of PC-Talk, which is probably the single most 
        popular communications program for the IBM-PC.

        But he is also the first person to distribute a major 
        program using the freeware concept.  In fact, the very term 
        "Freeware" is a trademark of The Headlands Press, the 
        company he founded.

        Personal computer users everywhere owe a debt of gratitude 
        to Andrew Fluegelman, and he will be sorely missed.
