                               Goodbye, George
                                  Doug Myers

     You don't have to hit me over the head with a two by four!  It only
     takes me a week or so to finally get the message!

     So earlier this week I got netmail from George Peace telling me that
     he could no longer provide the dial-up connection for file and echo
     connections.  At first it didn't occur to me that I had a problem,
     as I was doing the bulk of my traffic with my NC - I transferred
     FIDONEWS and another file area, BFDS, directly with George to get
     them on the Filebone as rapidly and reliably as possible, but picked
     up all the file areas I don't source through my NC.  Similiarly with
     echomail.  In fact, I'd never done echomail with George until just
     recently, when he allowed me a direct connection to his area manager
     as a favor so I could resolve a problem getting regional echoes.

     But then it occurred to me that my NC was also using George's
     dial-up modem to get the net feed, so I wrote George back and asked
     if my NC was also affected.  It was starting to occur to me that I
     might have to adjust to the situation.  That same day, I wrote a
     note in the FIDONEWS echo letting folks know that I'd need to change
     where I introduce FIDONEWS into the Filebone, as George was shutting
     down his dial up line.

     Apparantly, I touched off a spat of rumors which reached back to
     George:  He wrote back to me the next day that John and I would be
     affected, but only the two of us... and wanted to know if I knew
     anything about the rumors that he was shutting down.  <sigh>  I sent
     him a copy of what I'd written in the Fidonews echo and apologized
     if it touched off any rumors.

     Then the rumors started hitting me.  At first the folks in the
     FIDONEWS echo asked me if George was shutting down (or expressed
     disbelief that he was doing so), so I spent my time "revealing" to
     them that George's changes were only going to affect me and my NC.
     Then folks started telling me I was wrong, and that he was actually
     shutting down all Fido traffic.

     "Mon," I thought, "these rumors are really getting out of control!"

     I'm not sure when I first found out that they weren't rumors.  John
     Souvestre patiently explained things to me in netmail, including a
     copy of a message George had posted... George really was leaving
     Fido.  Before I saw John's message, though, David Moufarrege called
     me to see how FIDONEWS would be distributed once George shut down...
     and I was telling him that George wasn't really shutting down, that
     it was just a rumor.  But somewhere in the conversation, I could
     feel the two by four looming in the background, and figured I'd
     better shut up so as not to invite it...

     Durn... I didn't want to see George Peace go.  He's done nothing but
     FIDONEWS 16-49               Page 2                    6 Dec 1999


     good for me since I've known him.  I especially didn't want to give
     him any grief...

     George, may you find every happiness in your time after Fido.
     You've left some good people behind, and I'm confident they'll pick
     up any slack which is felt from your system missing.  But you'll be
     missed...

                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================

     from David Hallford, 1:208/103

     Hi Douglas!

        In a previous editorial you mentioned something about the FTSC.
     Here is a copy of FTA-1001.002 which is the Charter for the FTSC.
     It's pretty much plain language, but if you have any questions
     please feel free to ask. I may not have an answer <g>, but I can ask
     the other Standing Members.
        I have to admit that the list of members sometimes makes me feel
     inadequate. Folks like Mats Wallin, Joaquim Homrighausen, and now
     Harald Harms and CHarles Cruden make me wonder what I am doing on
     that list.
         The conversation level, however, is pretty decent and I have
     learned a lot in my 1st year on the committee.

                                           with warm regards,
                                                  Dave

     ECHOMAIL TERRORISM
     by David Hallford 1:208/103

          There is a new breed of terrorist here in Fidonet - the
     EchoMail Terrorist. You probably know some of them. You know, the
     ones who only write in echomail and will never respond to your
     netmail. Ever wonder why? They're cowards. What they write in
     echomail is not covered by P4 at least here in Zone 1 (and the ZC
     who made that ruling is now the IC so it is logical to assume that
     it covers all of Fidonet).
          Most of us are in a quandry about what to do with these folks.
     Some (like me) choose to no longer participate in echomail. Some
     choose to leave Fidonet. Many go to either the Internet or to other
     FTN networks.
          Through our inaction these terrorists are in fact now running
     Fidonet. What can we do? Force the issue! If a moderator allows
     these actions in their echo - start another echo and ban the
     terrorist from it on day one! Before the "free speech' people get up
     in arms - these terrorists have no rights in an echo except those
     granted by the moderator so it is the moderators right to "refuse
     service". If these terrorists can't play nice then don't let them on
     the playground.
          It really is that simple - let the old echos die a natural
     death and refuse to allow terrorists in the new echos.
          Maybe then they can overcome their aversion to netmail and
     'step up to the plate' like everyone else instead of cowardly hiding
     in the echos.

     Latency of Echomail, and why we need
     * By Joe Jared, 1:103/301 joejared@osirusoft.com

     A couple weeks ago, I started campaigning heavily to improve
     thruput on the fidonet backbone.  With George Peace leaving
     fidonet, latency will be a major issue, as nets find that
     their feeds for echomail have dried out.  It also means that
     many of us at different levels of the backbone will have
     additional work to do, and unfortunately, that latency will
     increase.  Currently, many of the FTP server hubs have
     scheduled events that occur once an hour, or once every 1/2
     hour.  Depending on your position, this can translate to as
     much as an hour for each hop along the backbone, and
     ultimately producing lags of a day or more.  Until this
     problem is minimized at the top level hubs, we will
     experience slower traffic, which also translates to less
     messages.  If it's not addressed promptly we will also see a
     loss of nodes, nets and possibly be watching one of the
     single worst disasters for fidonet, as people scramble to
     get their feed switched.  Finding a new feed for echomail
     isn't difficult, but finding one that is responsive to your
     FIDONEWS 16-49               Page 7                    6 Dec 1999


     needs may be.  For this reason, I have added yet another
     field to the list I have been maintaining, which will
     reflect also the responsiveness of the hub.  Anyone may be
     added to this list just by asking, regardless of their
     affiliations.  For purpose of definition, Latency is defined
     as the time in minutes that it takes for incomming mail to
     be processed AND enroute to the next level.  If this process
     occurs immediately after the mail is received, then latency
     is 0. For a scheduled event, the time between events is what
     I'm looking for.

     Ex-Soviet Fido Is Alive And Kicking

     Modern netters think now of a Fido as of a dying net. The amount of
     nodes decreases, echos either dry out or became the part of a
     Usenet, Internet has kicked Fido out. Perhaps that is true in Zone1.
     Why shall a new user get a point and use some obsolete FTN soft if
     he can get cheap unlimited Internet access?

     But here, in the countries of the former Soviet Union (the so-called
     "Zone 7") the situation is vice versa. The number of nodes
     increases, echomail traffic is fat, you can often meet a person, who
     says "Ha, I-net? I don't need it actually. I'm a Fido point and
     that's enough for me". Fido is even small for some, so they create
     dozens of local FTNs - "X-net", "DoomNet", "21-Century Net", etc...
     What causes such a great development?

     Initially it is high internet prices. Full unlimited access costs
     something about $70 per month. And that's very expensive here. Why
     pay so much for an account if you can get a point number for some
     bottles of beer. (Though according to the policy, Fido membership is
     free, it's a common tradition here to buy some beers to your node
     when you are getting a number.) So a fresh point can pick out any
     echo he want - Region 2:50 backbone will satisfy all tastes. You can
     have the most exotic hobby and be sure that there certainly is a
     corresponding echo.

     The problem is that "Zone 7" is mostly Russian-languge Fido. So
     international echos are not very popular. For example, Fidonews are
     read by a small quantity of nodes. That needs to be solved somehow -
     we must feel ourselves really a part of an Earthwide friends
     network.

     Just a Christmas Thought...

     'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
     HE LIVED ALL ALONE,
     IN A ONE BEDROOM HOUSE MADE OF
     PLASTER AND STONE.

     I HAD COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY
     WITH PRESENTS TO GIVE,
     AND TO SEE JUST WHO
     IN THIS HOME DID LIVE.

     I LOOKED ALL ABOUT,
     A STRANGE SIGHT I DID SEE,
     NO TINSEL, NO PRESENTS,
     NOT EVEN A TREE.

     NO STOCKING BY MANTLE,
     JUST BOOTS FILLED WITH SAND,
     ON THE WALL HUNG PICTURES
     OF FAR DISTANT LANDS.

     WITH MEDALS AND BADGES,
     AWARDS OF ALL KINDS,
     A SOBER THOUGHT
     CAME THROUGH MY MIND.

     FOR THIS HOUSE WAS DIFFERENT,
     IT WAS DARK AND DREARY,
     I FOUND THE HOME OF A SOLDIER,
     ONCE I COULD SEE CLEARLY.

     THE SOLDIER LAY SLEEPING,
     SILENT, ALONE,
     CURLED UP ON THE FLOOR
     IN THIS ONE BEDROOM HOME.

     THE FACE WAS SO GENTLE,
     THE ROOM IN SUCH DISORDER,
     NOT HOW I PICTURED
     A UNITED STATES SOLDIER.

     WAS THIS THE HERO OF WHOM I'D JUST READ?
     CURLED UP ON A PONCHO, THE FLOOR FOR A BED?
     I REALIZED THE FAMILIES
     THAT I SAW THIS NIGHT,
     OWED THEIR LIVES TO THESE SOLDIERS
     WHO WERE WILLING TO FIGHT.

     SOON ROUND THE WORLD,
     THE CHILDREN WOULD PLAY,
     FIDONEWS 16-49               Page 9                    6 Dec 1999


     AND GROWNUPS WOULD CELEBRATE
     A BRIGHT CHRISTMAS DAY.

     THEY ALL ENJOYED FREEDOM
     EACH MONTH OF THE YEAR,
     BECAUSE OF THE SOLDIERS,
     LIKE THE ONE LYING HERE.

     I COULDN'T HELP WONDER
     HOW MANY LAY ALONE,
     ON A COLD CHRISTMAS EVE
     IN A LAND FAR FROM HOME.

     THE VERY THOUGHT
     BROUGHT A TEAR TO MY EYE,
     I DROPPED TO MY KNEES
     AND STARTED TO CRY.

     THE SOLDIER AWAKENED
     AND I HEARD A ROUGH VOICE,
     "SANTA DON'T CRY,
     THIS LIFE IS MY CHOICE;

     I FIGHT FOR FREEDOM,
     I DON'T ASK FOR MORE,
     MY LIFE IS MY GOD,
     MY COUNTRY, MY CORPS."

     THE SOLDIER ROLLED OVER
     AND DRIFTED TO SLEEP,
     I COULDN'T CONTROL IT,
     I CONTINUED TO WEEP.

     I KEPT WATCH FOR HOURS,
     SO SILENT AND STILL
     AND WE BOTH SHIVERED
     FROM THE COLD NIGHT'S CHILL.

     I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
     ON THAT COLD, DARK, NIGHT,
     THIS GUARDIAN OF HONOR
     SO WILLING TO FIGHT.

     THEN THE SOLDIER ROLLED OVER,
     WITH A VOICE SOFT AND PURE,
     WHISPERED, "CARRY ON SANTA,
     IT'S CHRISTMAS DAY, ALL IS SECURE."

     ONE LOOK AT MY WATCH,
     AND I KNEW HE WAS RIGHT.
     "MERRY CHRISTMAS MY FRIEND,
     AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT."

     This poem was written by a Marine stationed in Okinawa Japan.  The
     following is his request. I think it is reasonable.....

     PLEASE.

     Would you do me the kind favor of sending this to as many people as
     you can? Christmas will be coming soon and some credit is due to our
     U.S. service men and women for our being able to celebrate these
     festivities.

     Let's try in this small way to pay a tiny bit of what we owe. Make
     people stop and think of our heroes, living and dead, who sacrificed
     themselves for us. Please, do your small part to plant this small
     seed.

                                 Race Horses
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     Charlie was a regular visitor at the racetrack. One afternoon he
     noticed an unusual site. Right before the first race, a Catholic
     Priest visited one of the horses in the stable area and gave it  a
     blessing. Charlie watched the horse race very carefully, and sure
     enough, the blessed horse came in first!

     Charlie followed the Priest before the next race. Again, the Priest
     went to the stables and blessed another horse. Charlie quickly put
     two dollars on that horse and won close to fifty bucks!

     The Priest kept blessing horses and Charlie kept betting on them and
     they won!

     The last race of the day was the biggest and Charlie saw the Priest
     with that horse, also! He quickly went to his bank and  withdrew his
     life's savings of $20,000, went back to the racetrack and  put it
     all on that horse!

     He watched the race in certain anticipation of leaving a
     millionaire! The horse was last to cross the line and Charlie was
     dead  broke!

     He couldn't believe what happened so he went looking for the Priest.
     He found the man and asked "What happened to that last horse you
     blessed? Because your blessing didn't work, I've lost all of my
     money!"

     The Priest said, "That's the trouble with you Protestants, you can't
     tell the difference between a blessing and the Last Rites!"
