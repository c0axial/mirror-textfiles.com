                          The Two Faces of Users

       There seem to be two general classes of BBS users out there.

       One  group is into long-distance BBSing,  calling boards all
       over the country.  The discussions are generally (though not
       always) technically oriented.  Systems frequented tend to be
       one or two established BBS packages,  such as Fido or  RBBS.
       Users tend to share files a great deal, and the most popular
       boards  are  those  with  a  large selection of downloadable
       files.  Almost everyone  has  either  an  IBM-PC  or  a  DEC
       Rainbow,  and  anyone  who doesn't have a 1200 baud modem is
       trying hard to get one.

       The other group tends to stick  with  local  boards,  rarely
       making toll calls.  Discussions range far and wide, covering
       hacking,  phreaking,  fantasy  and  RPG,  and  "war boards".
       Almost any sort of BBS system will do,  and many seem to  be
       "home  grown".  Users have almost total disregard for files,
       and many popular boards have no downloadable files  at  all.
       People   use  a  mixed  bag  of  hardware,   mostly  Apples,
       Commodores,  and TRS-80s,  and the 300  baud  modem  is  the
       universal standard.

       One  obvious  difference  is that the long distance crowd is
       spending alot more money on this.  They have  more  powerful
       machines,  faster  modems,  and heftier phone bills than the
       local crowd does.  Perhaps they are  the  "serious  computer
       users",  while  the  local  callers  are  the  "recreational
       computer users".

       So which group are we in?  I'd say most Fido sysops  are  in
       the  former group,  and perhaps most users as well.  Our own
       board has several users in each group,  though they all tend
       to  stay  in  separate  subboards  (Fido is handy that way).
       We've come to expect that some of our most frequent  callers
       won't  really understand the whole "message area" idea,  and
       why should they?  After all,  they spend their time  calling
       dozens  of  other  boards,  each of which works differently.
       Most of our "general" callers understand how the board works
       quite well, since they mainly talk to other Fido boards.

       I guess I'd class myself in the long-distance crowd.  I have
       an IBM-XT, a 1200 baud modem, and my phone bill is delivered
       with a forklift.  I'm much more  into  shooting  the  breeze
       with  another  techie  than  I am into fantasy games,  and I
       can't see why anybody would join in on a war board.  I guess
       I'm glad I've  found  a  niche  among  fellow  techies  like
       myself.

       But, boy, they sure do seem to have fun.

               Rover, Rovermsg, Renum, and the UN*X Gateway
                                    by
                               Bob Hartman
                            Sysop Fido 132/101
                             The UN*X Gateway
                            and Home of Rover


            Ok, I  have been receiving enough FidoNet mail to choke
       a horse  lately.   This article  is simply an update to keep
       people (especially  other sysops)  up to  date  on  what  is
       happening with  my many ongoing projects.  Let me start with
       the stuff  that people  are most  interested in  - the  UN*X
       Gateway  itself.     The   software  seems   to  be  working
       flawlessly, and  it has  been in  use now  for a  couple  of
       months.   My Fido BBS can send mail destined for remote UNIX
       systems, and  accept mail  from  remote  UNIX  systems,  and
       forward it  to the  appropriate Fido  nodes, I  also receive
       many  of  the  USENET  newsgroups,  including  net.micro.pc,
       net.lang.c, net.games.hack,  and a  few more.   Since I have
       received many  requests to  repeat the information on how to
       use the gateway, here it is:

            To send from Fido to a UNIX host:

                 Send a  FidoNet message  to node  132/101 and make
                 the recipient  be 'Usenet'  instead of  a person's
                 name.  This keys my software that this is destined
                 for a  UNIX system.   The  subject can be anything
                 that you  want it  to be, and it will be placed in
                 the outgoing  message.  Now comes the tricky part,
                 the first  line of  the message  MUST be  the UNIX
                 host  path   to  take   to  get   to  the  message
                 destination.   If you don't know what I am talking
                 about, then  don't  use  the  gateway.    A  quick
                 example is  to get  to my  UNIX address  the first
                 line would  be "vaxine!rch",  to get to someone at
                 microsoft it  might be "decvax!microsoft!someone".
                 Anyway, that is the general idea.

            To send from UNIX to a Fido node:

                 Send a mail message addressed to:
                 vaxine!spark!net!node!user
                 where net  is the  FidoNet net number, node is the
                 FidoNet node  number, and  user is the user who is
                 supposed to  receive the  message.   The user name
                 should have  all blanks  converted  to  underscore
                 characters.   An example  to get  to me  would  be
                 vaxine!spark!132!101!Bob_Hartman.    The  messages
                 are sent as private FidoNet messages.

            For sysops  interested in  receiving USENET  newsgroups
            messages:


       Fidonews                   Page  3                9 Dec 1985





                 You must  contact me  and tell me which newsgroups
                 you would  like to  receive.   I currently forward
                 net.micro.pc, and  net.lang.c, but I am willing to
                 forward others if asked nicely.  The only catch is
                 that you  must be  willing to  poll my node to get
                 the messages.   I  simply ARC  all of the messages
                 once a  week (after  deleting those  that are more
                 than a  week old), and send out the archive.  When
                 you receive  the file,  simply delete  all the old
                 messages from the message area, and un-ARC the new
                 ones.  They are already in Fido message format, so
                 you have an instant message base!

       So much  for the  UN*X Gateway.   If you have any questions,
       feel free to send me FidoNet mail and ask them.

       As for  Rover, that project seems to be on hold for a little
       while.   Rovermsg seems  to be  pretty complete  (at least I
       haven't received  too many  complaints lately),  and I  will
       probably release  another update  to it  in the near future.
       The rest  of Rover  is on  hold until I complete some of the
       consulting projects  that I  have been working on, since the
       consulting projects  generate a  lot  more  money  (although
       Rovermsg has  generated some money - sysops are a lot better
       about sending  money for freeware than I thought!).  Anyway,
       to recap, Rovermsg is a standalone Fido message base reader.
       It was  designed to  be used  in place  of Fido  in /T mode.
       Since I generally only read messages in /T mode, Rovermsg is
       a total  replacement.   It also has some additional features
       that make  it much  nicer to  use.  For example, you can use
       your favorite  word processor/editor to create messages, you
       can also  change messages  that have already been saved, you
       can exit  to DOS  temporarily, and  some others that are too
       numerous to  mention.  Anyway, if you want a copy, it can be
       downloaded from my board, and probably countless others also
       (at last count there were 100+ sysops using Rovermsg).

       Finally, my  standalone  message  base  renumbering  program
       (RENUM) is  at version  1.5.   It can be used to do whatever
       can be  done with  the  Fido  '8'  command  for  renumbering
       messages.   It can  kill old  messages, and  it can renumber
       messages.   The new  version now  properly handles  messages
       created by  SEAdog (at  least I  think it does, how about it
       Thom?).

       Anyway, that  is the  status of  the UN*X  Gateway, and  the
       software that  I have been responsible for creating.  I hope
       that this helped answer some questions.

       The Associated Press reported today (10/17) that a  ring  of
       juvenile  computer  hackers  (their  term) broke into a data
       base containing financial records of Chase  Manhattan  Bank,
       according to the FBI.

       No  arrests were made Wednesday,  but the FBI spokesman said
       more  than  40  agents  armed  with   23   search   warrants
       confiscated computers,  keyboards,  modems and software from
       the youths' homes Tuesday.

       The investigation,  which began in July,  is continuing.  An
       affidavit  filed  in San Diego U.S.  District Court says the
       juveniles gained entry  via  their  home  computers  to  the
       records  of  Interactive Data Corporation in Waltham,  Mass.
       The database is used by 25,000 subscribers.

       The  affidavit  says  some  records  were  modified   and/or
       destroyed  and  on  July  22  and  23 an unauthorized person
       gained access to an account which could transfer funds.

       There were 40 attempts to penetrate the  system  in  August.
       Four  attempts were made on Aug.  14,  all from computers in
       San Diego County.  Attempts to break into  the  system  were
       observed as recently as Oct. 9, according to the affidavit.

       The  AP  also  reported  that  Ronald Mark Austin,  21,  was
       sentenced in Los Angeles Wednesday to three years  probation
       plus  being  ordered to serve 600 hours of community service
       "not to involve computers in any shape."

       Austin,  a  former UCLA student,  was convicted of 12 felony
       counts of malicious accessing of a computer system in  June.
       Austin reportedly taught himself to use a $200 home computer
       when he couldn't get into an overbooked computer course.  He
       said he didn't know he was breaking the law.

       Prosecutors said he  broker  into  more  than  200  computer
       accounts  through  ARPANET.  Among  them  were  the  Defense
       Dept., the Rand Corp. and UCLA.

             THE NEW KAYPRO PC: TOPPING THE DESK AND THE REST

            The KAYPRO PC combines features and value to meet and
       exceed "IBM compatibility." As a complete desktop business
       associate, it commands a place above the others.

            Envision an accurate picture of the KAYPRO PC.  First,
       clear your memory of the angular grey machine that is so
       characteristically Kaypro.  Next, paint a beige beauty with
       eggshell trim, whose profile closely resembles that of the
       KAYPRO 286i.  Finally, visualize an external 12-inch
       diagonal monitor displaying no-nonsense output in eye-
       soothing green.  Handsome, no.


       Strong Internal Control

            Looks can only take you so far in the computing world;
       intelligence is the real key to success.  Although the
       KAYPRO PC breaks tradition with its striking countenance, it
       still maintains the Kaypro hallmark of superior computer
       intellect.

            Analytical power is provided by an 8088 cpu, operating
       at a timely 4.77 MHz.  An extra socket accepts an 8087 math
       co-processor, providing more calculating users with an easy
       upgrade for their number-crunching pleasure.  The 8087
       option permits business and research operations to be
       executed by a single computer.

            The KAYPRO PC's short-term memory begins with a
       standard 256K RAM, expandable to 640K by plugging 256K DRAM
       chips into the multifunction board.  Accessing the board
       requires hood removal via a simple four-screw procedure.

            Long-term memory?  The KAYPRO PC has total recall from
       two double-sided, double-density disk drives totalling 768K
       storage.  While we're on the subject of memory, 1986 will
       introduce a mega-memory version of the KAYPRO PC, the KAYPRO
       PC-10, with one 360K diskette drive and a 10 megabyte hard
       disk.

            The best administrators exchange information with
       external sources.  The KAYPRO PC is no exception.  A serial
       and a parallel port are compatible with all peripherals
       produced for the giant IBM after-market.  The KAYPRO PC can
       make all the right connections for successful import/export
       of data.

            The KAYPRO PC becomes a more versatile personality by
       utilizing its nine expansion slots.  Three slots contain a
       multivideo card (capable of monochrome, color graphics, or
       composite video display output), multifunction card, and a
       CPU card.  The remaining six slots can accommodate luxuries
       like a networking card, digital to analog converter,
       internal modem, and more.

            Even with numerous hardware additions, the KAYPRO PC

       won't get caught with its power down.  The 132 watt power
       supply can be jumpered to operate on 110 or 240 volts (60/50
       cycles).


       Human Relations Expert

            IBM compatibility is terrific, but what about user
       compatibility?  Can the KAYPRO PC relate?

            In addition to displaying a professional character, the
       KAYPRO PC also has the common touch.  Dance your digits
       across our IBM PC AT-style keyboard with easy to reach
       RETURN, SHIFT, and CTRL keys.  Forget the other guys with
       IBM PC XT-design keyboards; why stifle typing speed while
       promoting premature arthritis

            It is clearly seen that the 12" diagonal monitor won't
       advance CRT-induced myopia.  The crisp character set is
       brilliantly displayed in shades of monochrome green.  Sit
       back, relax, and stop squinting; the KAYPRO PC is a visual
       communications expert.

            The KAYPRO PC is not abuser friendly.  A keyswitch has
       been included to lock out all unauthorized keyboard input.
       Take your byte out of computer crime and rest assured of
       tamper-proof files.


       Programmed for Performance

            Complementing its impressive list of attributes, the
       KAYPRO PC has proven programs for immediate business
       success.

            Disciplined under MS-DOS, the KAYPRO PC includes GW-
       BASIC as its programming language.  BASIC is probably the
       most widely used and easiest to learn of all programming
       languages.  Furthermore, if you already use a library of
       programs written in BASIC-A (IBM's verion), GW-BASIC is
       BASIC-A compatible.

            Plan to cut costs for all typing assignments with
       WordStar, a professional word processing program.  This all-
       purpose industrial-strength program can manipulate
       everything from memos to manuscipts.  Teamed with MailMerge
       (a terrific file merging program), it can generate hundreds
       of form letters from a mailing database.  Time consuming?
       Not really.  Remember, the KAYPRO PC is willing to work
       nights so you don't have to.

            Not implying that there will be operator errors, but
       the KAYPRO PC and company can act as dutiful copy editors.
       CorrectStar checks for spelling errors, while StarIndex
       creates reference material such as indexes, tables of
       contents, and lists of illustrations, etc.  These gems take
       the drudgery out of word processing.

            The KAYPRO PC software entourage also includes MITE, an
       expert telecommunications translator.  Programmable auto-
       dial, protocol, file transfer, modem type, and numerous
       other options make unlimited electronic correspondence a
       snap.  There may not be a more sophisticated
       telcommunications program on the market today.

            And last, the KAYPRO PC acts as your personal assistant
       through PolyWindows K-Desk.  This memory-resident program
       provides instant access to a document editor, file card
       library, calendar, appointment book, calculator, telephone
       list with dialer, puzzle, key redefinition, and alternate
       file access.  The only thing it can't do is make coffee.

            If you need a professional business associate and
       consultant, then bring the new KAYPRO PC on board.  For only
       $1595, it's a small price to pay for success.

                          The PC's Space Program
                              by Gene Plantz


          I've often wanted just a bit  more  room  on  a  start-up
       floppy disk to store more of my favorite programs.  Before I
       installed  my  hard  disk,   I  attempted  to  transfer  the
       utilities  that  I used most frequently to my start-up disk.
       Invariably,  I'd need a tad more room.  By not  placing  the
       desired utilities on that basic disk, I wasted time swapping
       disks when I needed a stray utility program.

          This   cumbersome   process   is   no  longer  necessary.
       Spacemaker, from Realia, lets you compress the .COM and .EXE
       files of your favorite programs to  conserve  space  on  the
       disk.  After  the  files  are  compressed,  you  can run the
       programs as you normally would.

          Spacemaker is designed not for novices but for active  PC
       users  who  have  more floppies - and less free space - than
       they'd like.  Programming expertise can help  you  make  the
       most  of  the  utility but it is not essential.  The program
       works on just about any  .COM  or  .EXE  file  that  can  be
       executed  from  the  DOS  prompt.  Application programs,  of
       course, require at least one of the two files to function.

          Spacemaker can also convert .EXE files to .COM  files  if
       the   compressed  version  takes  up  less  than  64K.   The
       advantage of doing so is that loading and directory searches
       are generally faster for .COM files than for .EXE files.  To
       make the  conversion  from  .EXE  to  .COM  files,  you  use
       Spacemaker  as  you  would  the  DOS  utility EXE2BIN (which
       performs a function  similar  to  Spacemaker's  but,  unlike
       Spacemaker, alters the file's logical format.).COM files are
       understood  by the computer at its most basic level and thus
       differ from files written in source code,  which is far more
       accessible.  The  computer  always  loads  .COM files into a
       specific location in memory..EXE files,  which can be loaded
       anywhere  in  RAM depending on how much memory is used,  are
       capable of supporting bigger programs.  Functionally the two
       are the same; the difference is in how DOS handles them.

          Other file compression programs are on  the  market,  but
       none  allows  you  to leave the program compressed and still
       use it;  most file compression  programs  require  that  you
       reconstitute the program before running it.  HOW THE PROGRAM
       WORKS:  Spacemaker  reads  your  .COM  and .EXE files,  then
       produces fresh .COM or .EXE files that retain  the  original
       files'  information.  The program compresses binary zeros as
       ti reformats the file.  The result is a smaller file that is
       equivalent in every way to the original program file  except
       that superfluous disk space has been eliminated.

          The   Spacemaker   process  actually  adds  code  to  the
       beginning of  a  program  file.  This  code  is  called  the
       "loader."  It reconstructs the program file in memory to its
       precompression form.  This loader routine uses little  space
       and  is  hardly noticeable when the program is running.  The


       Fidonews                   Page  9                9 Dec 1985





       routine is designed to work when the program is loaded under
       DOS  (via  COMMAND.COM).   This  means  that  virtually  any
       program  you  initiate  from  the  DOS  command  prompt is a
       candidate for compression.

         You start Spacemaker by providing the  program  with  file
       specifications,  such  as  the names of the input and output
       files.  If anything is missing the program will ask you  for
       the  necessary  information.  To  compress  a  program,  you
       simply give the command SPACEMKR INFILE OUTFILE, with INFILE
       representing  the  name  of  the  input  file  and   OUTFILE
       representing the name of the output file.

          You  must  use  a different name for the output file than
       you've used for the input file.  Spacemaker does  not  alter
       the  input  file  in  any  way.  Under the program's default
       settings, .EXE files are input and .COM files are output.

       SPACE TO SPARE:  The program's results are noteworthy.  When
       I  ran  Spacemaker  with  the  PC-DOS  LINK.EXE  program,  I
       recorded a 22 percent savings in disk space -  about  10K  -
       upon  completion  of  compression.   The  program  file  now
       requires less disk space than it  formerly  did,  and  being
       smaller, it also loads faster than before compression.  I've
       used  the  compressed LINK program for four months without a
       hitch.

          Although Spacemaker is best suited to help  you  get  the
       most from floppies, it also enables hard disk users to store
       more files and reduce program load time.  My hard disk,  for
       instance,  contains roughly 700 files.  Using Spacemaker,  I
       compressed  17 .COM files and 25 .EXE files.  The .COM files
       used  an  average  of  8  percent   less   space   following
       compression; savings for the .EXE files averaged 15 percent.
       Crunching these 42 files freed up slightly more than 500K.

          Ironically,  some  files grew slightly after compression.
       My bulletin board programs,  written in Compiled BASIC  were
       larger  following  compression.  If the program code doesn't
       contain many groups of binary zeros,  there won't be much to
       compress.  Unfortunately, there is no way to tell in advance
       whether  a  file  will benefit from the compression process.
       Other Compiled  BASIC  programs  have  realized  significant
       space savings from Spacemaker's efforts.

       TO  COMPRESS OR NOT TO COMPRESS:  As these examples suggest,
       Spacemaker is easy to use and the results can be impressive.
       The only difficulty is  in  determining  what  you  can  and
       cannot compress.

          A few programs that start from the DOS prompt - including
       the  word  processing  program MultiMate - did not run after
       compression.  And compression will prevent some  .COM  files
       from  running,  including  1-2-3 utilities like FILEMGR.COM.
       But of the hundreds of programs that I compressed,  only ten
       or   so   failed   to  run  properly  after  compression  by
       Spacemaker.

          Discussions with the utility's  author  revealed  that  a
       problem  could  occur if a program's developers use a linker
       program other than the standard DOS LINK.  The rule is, if a
       .COM or .EXE file is loaded by a program other than DOS, you
       should not attempt to compress it.  If you do,  you'll  lock
       up your system, lose any new data, and need to reboot.

          The  documentation  for  Spacemaker includes sufficiently
       detailed explanations of what the program does  and  how  it
       works.  The  manual  is  concise and particularly insightful
       for the technically inclined.

          I found it interesting that  the  files  that  Spacemaker
       compresses   are  hard  to  debug.   Conceivably,   software
       developers  could  use  the  program  as  a  copy-protection
       technique   that  avoids  unconventional  disk  formats  yet
       "hides" code from those who know  how  to  use  DOS's  DEBUG
       feature to disassemble programs.

          Overall,  I  found Spacemaker to be an effective means of
       getting more from less.  Active PC users can,  with  minimal
       effort, save both space and time.

                           Why I Buy Mail Order

       By Fred Povey
       CKCS Board Member

               Imagine that you are about to buy  a  new  car.  One
       dealer  will  sell you the car you want for $10,000 and will
       throw in a free driver education course. Another dealer will
       sell you the same car for $7,000, but leaves it up to you to
       learn how to drive it. Which dealer would you buy from?

               Of course, if you already know how to drive, as most
       car buyers do, the answer is easy.  In the early 1900s, when
       the  automobile  was as new as personal computers are today,
       the decision might not have been so  easy.  You  might  have
       been  willing  to  pay  extra for someone to spend time with
       you, showing you how to run the car.

               Today,  with personal computers still not as  simple
       to  use as they will be someday,  you may find it worthwhile
       to pay full retail price in order to get advice and  support
       from  a  computer dealer.  But you should know that when you
       pay full retail price,  you are buying  two  things  --  the
       product,  and support for the product.  If you need only the
       product, and can support yourself, mail-order can save you a
       lot of money.

               I have been working with computers for 12 years,  so
       I  already knew something about them when I bought my system
       four years ago.  By buying mail-order,  I saved enough money
       to buy a disk drive. Since then I have bought other hardware
       and software,  nearly all by mail-order, and have been well-
       satisfied. That doesn't mean I haven't had problems. But the
       minor ones I solved myself,  and the few major ones I solved
       the same way a dealer would -- calling the vendor.

               Price  is  not the only reason I buy mail-order.  No
       computer store this side of Silicon Valley can offer you the
       range of hardware and software available  to  you  by  mail.
       While you might not be surprised if the local dealer doesn't
       stock  the  LISP interpreter you want,  you may have just as
       much trouble finding more common products, because some have
       minimum-order requirements that are too steep for your local
       dealer.

               That's understandable.  But often,  the  reason  you
       can't  find  what you want at the dealer's is that he hasn't
       kept up with what's available,  or that  he  gets  a  better
       markup  on other products.  If you keep up with the products
       yourself,  and find that dealers can't answer your questions
       anyway, you may as well save money and buy mail-order.

               This may sound like a slam at dealers, but it isn't.
       True,  many  dealers could do a better job of keeping up and


       Fidonews                   Page 12                9 Dec 1985





       of supporting customers.  But you don't  necessarily  expect
       your grocer to know about gourmet foods,  and it makes sense
       for a computer dealer to concentrate on selling Lotus  1-2-3
       or Appleworks,  where he can make money, instead of learning
       how to answer your questions about assembly language.

               On the other hand,  you can't have it both ways.  If
       you buy mail-order, don't expect a retail dealer to bail you
       out  of a bad purchase unless you plan to buy something from
       him.  Send your  friends  to  dealers  unless  you  plan  to
       support them, or unless they can support themselves.

               Mail-order is not without its risks,  but the way to
       minimize them is to do your homework. Read magazine reviews,
       talk to other users,  and find out who the reliable  vendors
       and mail-order dealers are. Whenever possible, pay by credit
       card;  you  have  much better legal protection against fraud
       then if you pay by cash or check.

               I hope I've made it clear that mail-order isn't  for
       everyone. The discounts are good, but they are essentially a
       reward to you for doing your own research, your own training
       and  your own installation.  If you enjoy doing that anyway,
       mail-order may be the ticket for you.

       Allen Miller, 108/10

                  USRobotics Courier 2400 Baud Modem

            I run a Fido electronic bulletin board at (513)-
       579-2587 and would like to take this opportunity to record
       some of my impressions of the USRobotics Courier 2400 baud
       modem.  Let me qualify my comments as those of someone that
       uses modems a lot but is not up on the technical or
       engineering side of the little boxes.  I had previously used
       Hayes 1200 Smartmodems and Hayes 2400 Smartmodems.  While I
       always liked the widespread acceptance and compatibility of
       the Hayes 1200, I finally chose to try the Courier after
       many compatibility difficulties experienced with the Hayes
       2400.  Currently, the Courier list price is $200 lower than
       the Hayes price.

            The Courier is noteworthy upon first removing it from
       the box.  It has a plastic case that is a little cheaper
       looking than the aluminum type case of the Hayes.  If you
       turn it upside down and look at the bottom you will only
       find everything you ever wanted to know about your modem.
       There is a small window exposing the DIP switches making
       them easy to access and change.  Adjacent to the window is
       complete notations on the function of each switch.  Also on
       the bottom of the modem is complete notation on the entire
       set of AT modem commands, special dialing commands and the
       Sn storage registers. There is a slide type variable volume
       control near the front of the modem that takes the volume
       from 100% down to 0%.

            If all that information on the bottom of the case were
       not enough, there are HELP commands that can be entered from
       the keyboard of your terminal program (like AT$) that will
       give you all that reference information on your screen.
       Just imagine that.

            Operationally, the Courier modem functions at 2400,
       1200 and 300 bauds without any of the non-intuitive tricks
       need to, say, initialize the Hayes 2400 nonvolatile memory
       to autoanswer a Fido system at 2400.  Since installing the
       Couriers on my Fido system, I have had several users leave
       messages saying that they had not been able to sign on my
       system before and all of a sudden they were able to sign on.

                              Rainbow Corner
                                    by
                               Ted Needleman


       The folks at Hardcopy are real  nice  to  me,  but  they  do
       insist  that  occasionally  I  let some of the other writers
       have some editorial  space.  This  translates  into  Rainbow
       Corner  having  a  finite  length  (usually about 900 words)
       rather than the verbose meanderings that I am truly  capable
       of.  Now  that  the  Rainbow  Corner  Fido  is  actually  in
       existence,  it struck me that  I  have  the  opportunity  to
       exercise  these  uncontrollable urges to run off at the word
       processor.  Welcome  to  the  first  of  my  Rainbow  Corner
       Ramblings.  This  will  be  an irregular feature here at the
       fido,  and will be completely unpublicized.  The only people
       who  will  get  to  read  this  trash,  are  those  who  are
       adventurous enough to call and explore.  Future  "Ramblings"
       depend  entirely  on  1>  the  response to this one (leave a
       message to the sysop) 2> whether or not I have something  to
       say and 3> the phase of the moon.

       This  first "column" concerns DEC's immanent announcement of
       the PC500.  This machine,  describe in a text file elsewhere
       on  the  board,  is DEC's IBM-AT compatible.  It sure sounds
       great to me,  but considering the drubbing DEC got the  last
       time  around  in the retail market,  I can't help but wonder
       how they are going to  sell  it?  Maybe  telemarketing?  DEC
       Direct?  After  all,  DEC has closed most of their "Business
       Centers".

       Actually,  secret  documents,  obtained  at  great  personal
       expense and cost,  show that Digital has come up with a plan
       unique in the industry.  If you  REALLY  want  a  PC500  bad
       enough,  DEC may let you adopt one!  The way this works,  is
       that you make an  application  to  DEC,  spelling  out  your
       qualifications  to  be  a  "PC  Parent".  This  application,
       together with a  processing  fee  of  about  seven  thousand
       dollars,  goes  to  "Adoption  Central".  If  DEC's  initial
       processing doesn't disqualify  you,  they  send  a  "special
       investigator"  out  to  your  office  or home (i.e.- the "PC
       Domicile") to verify that it is a proper place to  bring  up
       your  PC500.   It  must  be  clean,  well  lit,  comfortable
       temperature,  and not have  excessive  static.  Furthermore,
       you  must  be sufficiently financially responsible to insure
       that "PEECEE" gets fed only the best in diskettes (i.e.- DEC
       Brand).  If you can't provide your new arrival with  a  room
       of its own, don't bother to apply.

       Of  course,  not everyone will be able to meet the stringent
       requirements DEC will establish  to  permit  adoption  of  a
       PC500.  But  there  is at least one consolation.  If,  after
       six or seven months, Digital can't make up their minds about
       you,  or turns you down,  they WILL send you a Cabbage Patch
       Kid.

       That's it for this time around, see you on the phone line.
