     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     Some write a lot and some don't.  Is it important that your editor
     writes more or less in the editorial?  What does it matter, if he
     writes anything at all.  What matters, that you write article(s) for
     FidoNews, as that makes the newsletter, not what I utter, good or
     bad. ;-)

     Two notices were received about BBS's being available via Telnet.
     Should a reader be interested in keeping such a list, please let
     me know, as it might be a good idea keeping a list to be included
     in FidoNews.

     Thanks to Colin Turner, for sending us the FTSC2000 details.

     Hope to see more news from the FTSC in future.

     Happy reading,

     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Fido's Ugly Duckling with the Funny Web Feet
     Douglas Myers   1:270/720   doug@mdtnbbs.com

     I got some feedback this week from a strange duck who used to hang
     around the local net.  He didn't leave us like I'd thought... he
     just moved for a job.  But he doesn't walk a straight nodeline
     following Mother Fido like the rest of us ducklings any more - he's
     put on some Web feet.

     He wrote to let me know that sysops aren't threatening to put up
     HTML-based bbses as I'd reported... he's doing it now.  And some of
     the other creatures with Web feet are seeing a BBS for the first
     time, and they're impressed.

     He's not alone, of course.  Though few BBSes are completely
     HTML-based right now, access through telenet has been with us for
     some time.  This community is growing and talking about
     interconnecting through networks a bit kinder to Web feet... and
     there is a growing perception that Mother Fido is getting old and
     won't be able to lead her ducklings off the familiar paths she can
     still see.

     To you ugly ducklings out there, I send my wish that Maw Fido
     consents to have her cataracts removed soon.  Removed so that she
     can see that the pond opens into a big river... removed so that she
     can know that her ugly ducklings have grown to become graceful swans.

     FTSC2000 - FidoNet Technical Standards Committee Year 2000 program.
     By Colin Turner 2:443/13 ct@piglets.com


     Have you checked the year 2000 compliance of your hardware and
     software yet?

     Have you told us the results?

     If the answer is no, please read on.

     Recently Group Y of the FTSC (FidoNet Technical Standards Committee)
     released a package of tests to help nodes and points examine the
     compliance of their hardware and software with the change fast
     approaching in the year 2000.

     This has already been announced in FTSC_PUBLIC, and a reasonable
     number of nodes have requested the test package either over FidoNet
     as a file request or from the web site, but not enough.

     This article has two purposes, firstly to inform the wider FidoNet
     community about this, and also to remind you that we need your help.
     FidoNet is (at least in theory) a co-operative venture, and
     participation from all nodes and points is greatly appreciated.

     The changeover date is fast approaching, and it isn't realistic
     (or even possible) for a small group like a subset of the FTSC to
     check all existing software.

     If you are a developer, download the test set, check out your
     software. We want to hear from you if its compliant, we want to hear
     from you even if it's not compliant and you have a release date for a
     compliant version. We even want to hear if it's not compliant and
     will no longer be developed. It's in your interests to use this
     opportunity to tell your users you are on top of the problem, or no
     longer want to deal with your software.

     This responsibility does not fall on the developers alone. If you are
     an "ordinary" node or point and feel that you have a moderate
     technical understanding, then you can also help. Check the software
     that is running on your system, it's in your interests to determine
     if you need to change it or ask for upgrades from the author. Don't
     just test the software, please send us the results, so that other
     nodes and points can benefit from your findings.

     If you are a FidoNet user who does not feel capable of testing your
     software, then there are still ways you can help. Ask your software
     author if they have checked the software for compliance, ask if they
     have submitted the results to us. Tell other people about our project,
     and include the contact details below on your web page if you have
     one.
     FIDONEWS 15-37               Page 4                   14 Sep 1998


     It is the ambition of this project to build a database of software in
     use in FidoNet (and other compatible networks) in all platforms. It's
     even more important on obscure platforms where variety of software is
     sorely limited. We want to be able to post results in FidoNews to
     keep you posted of test findings by ourselves, developers and other
     FidoNet users.

     This group is interested in working with anyone who wants to
     constructively deal with the year 2000 problems in FidoNet Technology
     Networks, if you want to participate, please contact us.

     For information, please file request (from 2:443/13 or 2:443/14):

     FTSC2000

     For the tests sets themselves, in various compression formats, please
     file request:

     FTSC2000ARC             (ARC compression);
     FTSC2000ZIP             (ZIP compression);

                                 NET HUMOR
     =================================================================


     Recently, the Overseer of Backbone Operations announced that the
     backbone would cease the practice of automatically deleting
     low-traffic echos.  This action did not meet with wide approval from
     the ZHUBS and RHUBS, and these folks are meeting right now to
     discuss the issue.  While final details of a new plan are yet to be
     announced, there has been considerable compromise.  All are agreed
     that the following echos should not be restored to the backbone for
     any reason:

     Z&Z&Z&Z         This now sleepy echo was once the gathering place
                     the various identies of Zorch, rumored to have been
                     the head of one of the most powerful voting blocks
                     ever seen on Fido.  Dropped by the Elist Robot when
                     the moderator failed to produce evidence that he
                     existed.

     HORNY14         This echo stands as an empty tribute to the fourteen
                     year olds who once dominated the chat echos as the
                     carrier pigeon once dominated the skies of North
                     America.  The plaintive wails of lonely hearts
                     attempting contact with their adolescent peers of
                     the opposite sex are but a memory, commemorated only
                     by their intellectual heirs, the fifty-ish crowd who
                     preserve their traditions.

     P5              Designated the public conference for continued
                     policy improvement, the echo just never caught on.

     ELC             Designated the ElfLord Contact conference, this echo
                     fell into disuse in 1989 at a time when the ElfLords
                     scribed their collective wisdom onto great stone
                     tablets which still stand at the entrance to
                     Fidonet.

     FTSC_DOCS       This echo is for the release of new documents by the
                     Fidonet Technical Standards Committee.  Dropped by
                     the NAB due to no volume.

     BIBLE_THUMPER   This write-only echo accounted for 21.6% of all
                     backbone traffic when it was removed from the elist.
                     The moderator was discovered to have no valid Fido
                     address, and evidence indicates that he was probably
                     a fictitious character who frequented the DISNEY
                     echo.

     Z1C_INPUT       Another popular write-only echo, the idea was that
                     end-nodes could write to the Z1C without being
                     burdened by replies.  Dropped at the moderator's
                     request because it duplicated the function of the
                     Z1C echo.

     FIDONEWS 15-37               Page 6                   14 Sep 1998


     NMAD            The Naked Mother's Against Dyslexia echo was
                     accidentally unlisted in 1997 when the
                     organization's founder discovered that her autopost
                     robot had failed.  She attempted a manual update,
                     thus creating the DAMN conference. Ironically, 2000
                     naked mothers who had tried to areafix the NMAD
                     conference previously found themselves
                     auto-connected within two hours of DAMN's addition
                     to the backbone.

     SUPER-BATCH     Bitching does strange things to the eyes, and the
                     batch file writers found that they had to retreat to
                     the BATPOWER conference when two blurry-eyed
                     super-bitches found their way into their now defunct
                     conference.  The @echo off @ffectionados hope that a
                     BITCHPOWER movement is not in the offing.

     Greetings from Sunny Clearwater, Fla. (USA)

     I was reading an article in fido news where a poster has lost access
     to fidonet.

     My suggestion is to put fidonet bbs's accessable via the internet in
     fido news.

     Mine is accessable either by Telnet or Http, Features the complete
     Zone-1 backbone.na & no conferences, Fido news is avalible as a
     bulleton, or can be downloaded from the file areas. Nodediffs &
     Nodelists are also avalible.
     This bbs is a free service to the fidonet community at
     bbs.docsplace.org

     If anyone needs a telnet terminal program, I recommend Netterm which
     is avalible at http://www.tucows.com
