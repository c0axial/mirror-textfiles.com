     The program that  generates the nodelist,  MAKENL has reached its
     limits in  the generation of  the nodelist.  To  procure a little
     time  till the  program can  be  updated the  following TEMPORARY
     changes  are   being  made   to  the   nodelist  by   the  Region
     Coordinators.


     (1)  All Echomail/Software  Distribution Coordination  nodes have
     been removed from the nodelist.  If more room is needed, the rest
     of the help/administrative nodes will  be removed from the Zone 1
     Administrative area.

     (2) All private  nodes will be removed  from the nodelist.  These
     nodes are  encouraged to  hook into the  net as  point systems to
     their  network hosts.   Private nodes  can be  added to  your own
     nodelist by setting up a private network listing in XLATLIST.

     (3) If necessary, the Zone Coordinators might have to temporarily
     remove  the  other  Zones from  their  nodelist  generation.  For
     example  Zone  1  would  only  receive  a  nodelist  with  Zone 1
     included.  Zone 2 and 3 would have to be added manually.  If this
     happens,  I will  be making  the Zone  nodelists available  on my
     system for file request, for  those that need direct connections,
     vs via the zonegates.

     (4) A TEMPORARY hold in the  issuance of any new node numbers.  I
     hope this will only be in effect for one week till I can evaluate
     how much growth room we have.


     We hope to have the problem solved within the next few weeks with
     appropriate software.   Please bear  with us.   We will  have the
     situation corrected in the sortest possible time.

          RAM-SOFT BBS Echomail Survey Results


     In an effort to determine how Echomail was used by and
     deemed a worthy part of our FidoNet BBS by our users and to
     justify the system downtime to process the mail, we recently
     ran a survey on our BBS. (All callers had to answer Yes or No
     to answering the survey before they could utilize the bulletin
     board).  This article is an overview and some editorial comments
     on the results and some thoughts for those of you who are sysops
     that carry echomail.

     If the editor of FidoNews does not consider it to be too much
     material, a complete copy of the results are elsewhere in this
     this newsletter.  Details on obtaining the results from 135/1
     are listed below.

     As a point of information to help you better understand the
     results, our board has been carrying echomail since it was first
     available so neither our system is new to echomail nor our
     users are new to echomail although some of the areas we carry
     are new.  We carry eight public echomail areas: COMM,CECHO,DBASE,
     TECH,WINDMILL,ECPROG,PASCAL and WORDPERFECT and one private
     echomail area.  At the time the survey started we had around
     600 users, about 45 were new to the board within the last month.
     We have been operating a FidoNet bulletin board since March of
     1986.

     It should be noted that only about 10% (55) of our users even
     bothered to answer the survey indicating to me that echomail is
     not too important to them.  It should be mentioned also that we
     average, according to LogRpt statistics, 250 files a week
     downloaded and as such we are much more of a file oriented board
     than a message oriented board.  We are however a board with many
     long distance or PC-Pursuit users and had at least 5 long
     distance users answer the survey and that should give a broader
     perspective than had only South Florida users answered.  Only
     two sysops responded. (Neither of the RAM-SOFT sysops answered).

     The results were somewhat surprising in some areas and others
     quite predictable.  Of the answers, 76% read echomail while
     24% percent do not read echomail.  24% of the respondents
     read an average of 2 message areas, while 22% read 3 areas.
     Only 3% read all eight conferences we carry.

     The most surprising results came in the hypothetical question:
     'What if we charged access to be able to read echomail?'  A
     surprising number, 55% said that they would be more than happy
     to pay for the privilige.  An even more surprising answer came
     when we asked the hypothetical question: 'What if we only made
     echomail available to donating members?'  65% said that they
     would donate.

     The number of people who considered echomail to be important on
     a bulletin board was 95% yet 36% of those could not give a
     coherent reason why it is important.  (Reasons like 'Because
     FidoNews 5-18                Page 3                    2 May 1988


     good bbs important' count as non-coherent as did 'because it's
     important').  The majority of those giving an answer (20%) said
     that echomail expands communications while the second largest
     group (18%) said it was a good source of information.  Three
     people said the reason was because local message sections are
     dull and one person said that echomail was the reason BBS's
     existed.  Approximately 67% would carry echomail if they ran a
     bulletin board.

     It was interesting that 38% of the respondents had never entered
     or replied to echomail.  In the rating of conferences on a 1-5
     scale, the majority (ranging from 53% to 82%) of the respondents
     rated the conferences with a 0.  When the 1-5 scale answers are
     added together they did not come very close to the number of
     people who rated the conference areas with a 0. TECH-Net was
     rated the best with 20% giving it a 5 and 16% giving it a 4.
     ECPROG was second highest with 11% giving it a 5 and 18% a 4.
     The WordPerfect conference would be dropped by 31% if they had
     to.  Eighteen percent would drop dBase if they had to with one
     user commenting that he would not support an archaic database
     system if he were a sysop.

     What exactly are the users saying?  Only they know for sure but
     some ideas can be gained from this survey.  It seems as though
     users have come to expect that bulletin boards must have at
     least two or three echomail areas to be considered a 'good'
     bulletin board but cannot give a good solid reason as to why a
     board should have echomail.  Are they saying that the same
     sysops or authors who told us the 'it's a new protocol, it must
     be good' for downloads story have made echomail a necessity
     without any solid reason?  The fact that the majority could not
     give a good reason for why they thought echomail important makes
     me as a sysop think that they are just going along with the
     crowd - they see everyone with echomail, therefore it must be
     important. I would argue that if the sysops put forth as much
     effort in establishing their local message areas as they did in
     arguing over the IFNA, collecting files, debating fastest
     protocols and other 'trivial' matters, there would be little real
     demand BY THE USERS for national echomail as it currently
     exists.

     The results could also indicate that we at RAM-SOFT have a very
     poor selection of conferences.  Granted, Windmill, WordPerfect
     and dBase are not the most popular of conferences but we have
     our reasons for carrying them.  Specifically, we use Dutchie, a
     very good mailer program and support multiple Dutchie points and
     like the support that Windmill offers us and them. Overall
     though, I feel we carry a good, but small selection of
     conferences that are relative to the computer programmer and
     serious computer hobbyists and that our board has.

     Given that most users only read two or three conferences
     indicates to me that the users do not really care for a large
     number of conferences.  Perhaps the users would rather call
     two or three boards to get 5 or 6 conferences instead of calling
     one system that carries a large amount of conferences.
     FidoNews 5-18                Page 4                    2 May 1988


     The fact that so many people would not rate the conferences with
     anything higher than a 0 indicates that the level of quality on
     these conferences is in serious, if not fatal shape.  One could
     argue that the users are saying that echomail should be routed
     through a small group of boards that monitor messages to see that
     they remain on the related topics but that would be countered
     with the paranoid who would say 'Don't censor echomail -- it's
     a violation of my 1st amendment rights.' (It wouldn't be).  As
     long as the idea that good boards must carry echomail conferences
     and boards must make it available to all, there will always be
     a fairly large amount of garbage.  Perhaps the users are telling
     us sysops to keep echomail alive but get some conferences that
     stick to the subject and actually are worth reading and
     participating in.  I hate to see what the comments would be if
     we carried 15 or 20 sections.

     How can we as sysops have conferences that stick more to the
     topic and are relative to the users?  The users may have
     answered that by saying that they are willing to pay (either
     flat-out or by donating) for the privilege of reading and
     entering echomail.  Those that argue that echomail has no
     security because anyone can logon to a system and enter messages
     should be pleased at this idea.  Of course those users (and
     sysops) who are leeches would argue foul but probably couldn't
     justify why they shouldn't have to support echomail in some
     way.  If only donating users have the ability to enter or read
     messages, then the sysop will know who has abused the privilige
     and take appropriate actions.  The users are telling sysops that
     they are willing to help foot the phone bill.  Unfortunately
     though, as long as some sysops, especially those with WATS lines
     or business/government backing (or even 9600's) continue to
     offer echomail to non-donating/non-privilege users and/or
     sysops spread the idea that non-echomail systems are poorer
     systems, there will probably never be echomail that the majority
     of users consider superior or excellent.

     In summary, the users seem to be saying that they want
     echomail, even if they don't know why.  They are more
     comfortable with a smaller number of conferences and don't
     consider many of the conferences to be of much quality.  The
     willingness to pay either a flat charge or by donating to be able
     to read messages is the hardest to interpret.  Perhaps they are
     tired of waiting for someone to take the active, visible hand
     that is necessary to keep echomail conferences on the subject.
     Perhaps they are saying they don't mind spending money on their
     hobby.

     Overall, I'm not convinced that the large numbers of echomail
     subjects that exist, at least at a national level, is worth
     the tremendous expense and time involved to process it.  A
     'globaly' available message area (echomail) is a great idea and
     worth exploring but I believe only under tight (self-designed)
     regulatory efforts.  Why should users even bother to weed
     through all the junk that is present in these conferences?
     Most systems, including ours are too busy for and do not allow
     enough online time for users to be able to read every message
     FidoNews 5-18                Page 5                    2 May 1988


     that comes into the system.  You almost have to be either a
     sysop or a point to reap the full benefit of echomail.  That
     might be the reasons sysops don't like to hear that echomail
     might not be all that great. Perhaps local echomail if there
     is a strong active network host or perhaps selective or regional
     echomail that has a limited number of boards per conferences is
     something to consider.

     Comments on this survey and results of your own *surveys* (not
     opinions) are welcome via net-mail at 1:135/1.

     I might also add that at this time we have no concrete plans
     to change the echomail conferences we carry or the way in
     which we allow users to participate.

     The complete results of the survey, if not present in this
     newsletter, are available from the RAM-SOFT Archive Library
     BBS, 1:135/1 by file requesting ESURVEY.TXT (No file requests
     08:30 - 10:30 UTC).  It may also be obtained by first time
     callers in file area 12(INFO). If you can do standard
     IFNA/FidoNet file requests, we would prefer that you obtain the
     file that way as we do require users to answer several questions
     before being allowed on to the system and would prefer not have
     a bunch of new callers unless you plan to be a part of the
     RAM-SOFT BBS.

     Results from the survey on Echomail taken during three
     weeks in April, 1988 on RAM-SOFT Archive Library BBS, Miami, FL.

     Questions are exact questions.  When text answers were required
     from those questioned, only a paraphrase of those answers is
     given here and only answers of a similar nature or interesting
     comments are included.

     A total of 55 individuals answered the survey, aproximately 10%
     of the total number of users on the day the survey began.
     Neither of the sysops of RAM-SOFT participated in the survey.

     Question#:
     1: Do you read ANY Conference mail areas(Y/N)?
                                     Yes: 42 (76%)
                                      No: 13 (24%)

     (if yes) How many individual areas do you read:

     3: If you ran a bulletin board and had to pay the phone bill,
        would your bulletin board carry any conferences(Y/N)
                                   Yes:  37  (67%)
                                    No:  18  (33%)

     4: Have you ever entered a message or replied to a message
        in an echomail conference(Y/N):

                                    No:  21  (38%)

     5: IF we charged access to echomail areas (one fee for all
        areas), would you pay for this privilige(Y/N)?
                                   Yes: 30   (55%)
                                    No: 25   (45%)

     6: As opposed to charging for access, IF we made echomail
       areas only available to donating users, would you donate(Y/N)
                                   Yes: 36   (65%)
                                    No: 19   (35%)

     The Think Tank
     OPUS 1:123/7

                            Life After Samantha


          That's the title of an article I just read in the May issue
     of YANKEE Magazine.  The article tells the story of Jane Smith,
     mother of Samantha.  I'm sure you all remember Samantha - she's
     the 11-year old Maine girl who wrote a letter to Yuri Andropov
     expressing concern about Russia and the United States getting
     into a nuclear war.  She subsequently visited Russia, in July of
     1983.  Unfortunately, she and her father were killed in a plane
     crash in 1985.  After her death, she became somewhat of a folk
     hero in Russia.  The Soviet Union named an asteroid, a flower, a
     mountain, and a cruise ship after Samantha.  Her portrait greets
     visitors at the gate to Samantha Smith Alley.

          Apparently, things are not going so well in the United
     States.  Jane Smith began The Samantha Smith Center "to foster
     international understanding in the spirit of Samantha".  The
     Center's projects include an international newsletter for
     children, bringing American situation comedies to the Soviet
     Union, and hosting Soviet children in American summer camps.
     However, for various reasons, the foundation is in need of funds.
     For one thing, the initial founders, who raised $100,000 to get
     the Center started, wanted Mrs. Smith to move the Center to New
     York.  When they refused, and remained in Hallowell Maine, they
     lost some of that support.  In addition, Mrs. Smith's television
     appearances have generated more questions and requests for
     information than financial support.  According to Mrs. Smith, at
     least half the calls they receive are from people wanting the
     Center to help THEM start a similar exchange.  While Mrs. Smith
     agrees that this is wonderful, it also means that there are that
     many more centers competing for the same funding.

          There are other reasons why the center is in financial
     distress, too many to list here.  A magazine for young people
     failed; a movie which Columbia pictures planned to co-produce
     with the Soviets appears to have been abandoned; an exchange
     which gave ten Soviet teenagers almost a week in a Maine summer
     camp (the first time the Soviets had sent their kids to an
     American camp) depleted the center's funds.  The list goes on...

          But I suppose by now you've discovered what this is all
     leading up to.  Send money!  Can we allow the Samantha Smith
     Center to fail and still sleep at night?  I can't, not if my few
     dollars, combined with a few dollars from others, can keep it
     going.  How many FidoNet systems do we have right now, 3,000+?
     And how many users are on those 3,000 systems?  If we each sent
     one dollar, I suspect it would make a difference.  It would also
     bring us all together in a small way, and help us feel better the
     next time we see a "computer phreaker" article in our local
     newspaper (why don't they ever print the good stuff?).  Even if
     the center fails, at least we'll know we tried.  Please, send a
     FidoNews 5-18                Page 9                    2 May 1988


     dollar or two to this worthy cause!  I have no idea if it is tax
     deductible, nor do I care; my check will be in tomorrow's mail.
     If you'd like to know whether your contribution is tax deductible
     (or if you want more information, or if you think this is some
     sort of prank), I'll provide the center's phone number at the end
     of this article.  Let's send a buck or two and do something good
     for the world!  SysOps, if you have a minute, please post this
     article on your bulletin board, or at least refer your callers to
     this issue of FidoNews.  We all know that (alas) it is mostly
     SysOps who read FidoNews, let's spread the word even further!

          I have no idea if I have violated any copyright laws in this
     article.  Brief passages from YANKEE Magazine have been quoted
     verbatim, as have quotes by Mrs. Smith.  Perhaps foolishly, I did
     not want to take the time to wait for permission from YANKEE
     before writing this article.  In any event, if an apology to
     YANKEE Magazine and/or Mrs. Jane Smith will keep me out of jail,
     please consider it done!

          Now, let's get out our checkbooks or wallets and send a
     dollar or two.  I'm not a writer (did you guess?), so maybe I
     haven't stated a very strong case, but let's keep a young girl's
     dream alive, shall we?  For a much better article by Mel Allen,
     pick up a copy of YANKEE Magazine, May 1988.  Maybe THAT one will
     help loosen those purse strings!

     I would encourage any other systems that run LogRpt on a weekly
     basis *OR* can send me data in a similar format (minus the area
     names) and would like their stats included in this list, please
     drop a net-mail note along with your system's download data
     to 1:135/1.  If using LogRpt, don't use paths in the output all
     I want is filenames and total downloads.  If any thing is of
     particular interest or you have changed a filename, mention
     that.  I MUST have the report by Monday's net-mail time in order
     to get the stats edited.  This should give you Saturday and
     Sunday to get the previous 7/8 days together. If the report is
     longer than 10 days, I don't think it will be possible to
     include it.  (We can accept net-mail anytime of the day and
     are PC-Pursuitable).
