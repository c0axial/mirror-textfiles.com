Editorial: That's not funny!

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

This is the Funny Issue of FidoNews. Ha ha. OK, it was short notice,
announced only last week. But I did get two very funny things. The
second one will probably generate some ill will unintentionally from
people with (1) no sense of humor and (2) people who will take it
seriously.

A lot of this issue is decidedly not funny, though it's not a response
to my call for funny things from sourpusses. It's also a largish
issue. It may also be the last "fun" FidoNews for a long time. Stay
tuned. But this is another story.

GRIPE MODE ON:

With the odd address of 1:1/1 I get every damned screwed up message in
the world. Will the person with the TICKTALK program stop sending me
TIC announcements about files received at 96:1/1!!! I've had it -- I
am going to simply start embarrassing people in public here until the
offender start checking their installations and stop the constant flow
of nonsense mail. I don't mind one-time screwups, it's the week after
week deluge caused simply by not watching what you are doing.

GRIPE MODE OFF:

It's funny how life goes. I've been working at being a full-time
computer dropout (burnout is more like it) for about five years now.
My income has plunged to what most people would consider the poverty
line. Quite voluntarily. I've cut my overhead to amazingly low levels.
It's not that I don't like money (I'll take all I can get like anyone
else) it's just that I can't do the computer-programmer thing any
more. No longer do companies want employees; they want you to live
their life, quite literally. Attend company social events, work 60
hrs/week, etc etc. All on their terms.  (At Apple, my last "real job",
I was told about "team playing" whenever I did something unusual. If
you didn't attend the mandatory baseball game visits, bowling etc you
got vibed out. I quit.)

The line between "work" and "life" has been blurry since 1980 for me,
but this past year it's taken on a decidedly strange texture. I used
to get paid to make other people money and products; I can no longer
do that. It literally was making me sick. My allergies and asthma was
getting worse, and I was angry and stressed out all the time. Jobs
literally steal your time, energy and life. My asthma is now gone --
gone -- when all the meat-mechanics said I would take their
debilitating drugs all my life. Lying ignorant arrogant scum.
Solution? Remove all the stress and bad influences from my life.
Sounds like a pat response, but it's hard and was a very radical
(look it up) move. It took six years. I'd never go back!

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 2                      10 Aug 1992


But now in between occasional software and radio jobs, I spend an
incredible amount of time doing... I really don't know what to call
it. It's not technical, ie. pure programming. It's not managerial, no
one works for me. FidoNet stuff, like FidoNews. Too many things at our
house (an intentional community of six to eight plus inner-circle).
Volunteering for the Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference.
Speaking to a bunch of diverse groups about FidoNet, BBSing and BBS
networking. Firefighting and handholding and instigating and informing
people and nebulous projects in FidoLand (about 20 hours a week's
worth of messaging, easy). Getting my local non-techie friends
connected to the world of computers and telecommunications. Trying to
get started managing and expanding a local internet network. Take
care of filling orders for my various publications (net income: $25/month).

It's a lot of work. I had convinced myself that I was getting out from
all this CRAP computerism. It was driving me crazy. A brief look
around and it's obvious I am not doing that. I have managed to get rid
of my "previous life" so I guess I did the right thing. (Only I got
rid of all my income-producing jobs too! Oh well, can't have
everything.) It merely turned into something else. I guess I don't
mind.

It is worth it I guess. I don't like being considered a repository of
ancient history (most of my speaking things are about FidoNet, most
of which consists of history) -- I'm not that old dammit, and I
haven't felt any older than when I was 20. It's very weird. While the
idiocy and flaming drives me nuts, and the idiocy pushes my patience
sometimes, it is usually worth it in some non-tangible way.

The bottom line is I'm "online" now an absolute minimum of four hours
a day. About half my traffic is through the internet. As soon as I can
find a tape interface card (Everex EV831) I'm going to install unix on
my 386 box, and get a direct internet feed (part of a larger project,
partly in exchange for services from me...) Don't worry, I will still
run a DOS BBS and do FidoNews as always. Networks are no longer a toy
or hobby, it is an absolutely indispensible part of life. It's both
good and bad. The creepy people who want to control your choices for
their own ends are in FidoNet too, and "regular ole sysops" can no
longer sit back and just play techie games, no matter what
justification you might have. The price of freedom is eternal
vigilance.


This has been a year for change, in my life and the world. I think the
Fidonet is about to undergo a rather rapid and violent change --
hopefully for the better long-term. We'll see...

Welcome to the FidoNet Olympics
by Dave Bealer (1:261/1129)

   The echoes are kind of quiet these days.  Maybe everyone is glued
to the Olympics Triplecast.  For those of us that aren't, why not have
our own Olympics on FidoNet?  Here is a summary of suggested events:


}} Local BBS Events {{

>> 14.4K Protocol Negotiation <<
The winner is the first user who can stay awake during the entire
protocol negotiation sequence between a V.32bis modem and a tin can.

>> 110-step Registration Hurdles <<
The gold medal goes to the user who completes the "simple"
registration procedure in the shortest time.  Contestants are advised
not to wear glasses or contacts while competing in this event, as they
might interfere with the online laser retina scan.

>> Modern Hexadecimalon <<
Competitors attempt to break 16 different FidoNet policies and/or
draconian local sysop rules in a single logon session.

>> Download Ratio Balance Beam <<
Users attempt daring massive downloads without (hopefully) losing
their download privileges.

>> Door Exercises <<
The gold goes to the user who can enter and play the most door games
in a 45 minute logon session.

>> Echolocation <<
The winner is the user who can find the echo he is looking for in the
fewest BBS accesses.


}} Echomail Events {{

>> Verbal Gymnastics <<
You won't believe how these competitors can twist and turn the English
language into almost unrecognizable shapes.

>> Greco-Roman Thread Wrestling <<
Wrestling for control over the direction an echo conference thread will
take.  Moderators are ineligible for this event.

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 4                      10 Aug 1992


>> Marathon Messaging <<
Contestants enter 75 messages in a single echo in one session.  Each
message must have at least three lines and at least one line must be
original (not quoted).  The one who enters the 75 messages in the
shortest time wins.  Penalties will be assessed for each message which
actually pertains to the topic of the echo.  The use of offline readers
is prohibited.

>> Power Quoting <<
The winner will have made the longest continual quotation with the
shortest vaguely pertinent reply.  The current world record is 382
lines of quotes with a five word reply.

>> Tagline Topping <<
Medals are awarded in the following categories: Annoying, Childish,
Funny, Gross and Stupid.  There is also a special all-around medal for
the tagline which best combines all five attributes.

>> Volley Message <<
The gold medal goes to the first pair of correspondents who nest their
quotes so deeply that the leading initials force the message text off
the screen entirely.

>> Platform Diving <<
Each contestant ascends to the soapbox and attempts to make insulting
comments about everyone and everything in FidoNet.  Timing is critical,
as the competitor must dive off the platform before his/her access to
the net is revoked.

>> Heavyweight Ego Lifting <<
In this event the posturing which procedes the lift can be more
important than the lift itself.

>> Full Contact Flaming <<
What would a FidoNet Olympics be without its symbol, the flame?


}} Sysop Events {{

>> 5 MB Packet Toss <<
The gold medal goes to the Sysop whose system can dearchive, toss, sort,
link and julienne a 5 MB mail packet in the shortest time.

>> Echo Looping <<
The winner is the Sysop who can cause the most dup-loops in the most
different echoes in one day of operation.

>> Synchronized Polling <<
The winning Sysop pair will be the one whose systems synchronize
their polls to each other the longest (without getting through).

After the events are over everyone will be hanging out at the Olympic
Village BBS, chatting online about the competitors who failed their
drug tests.  And we won't have parted with $125 for the privilege.

Editorial: RC's Resign

Due to technicalogical advances in modem speeds and call
connect rates, the RCs are no long necessary as a buffer
between the many networks and the ZC.  All 400 or so nets in
Zone 1 will henceforth send their nodelist segments directly
to the ZC's system.

Further, the reduced levels of appeal for policy complaints
will insure a more timely response to such conflicts, and
help to promote a more congenial atmosphere in which to
pay long distance bills for echomail.

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 6                      10 Aug 1992


Most importantly, FidoCon will revert to once every 6 months
because it will be such a snap for the ZC to decide on the
venue by himself.

The editors of FidoCon News wish to applaud these policy
changes and we support the candidacies of these leaders in
the upcoming election season.  Be sure to attend the special
elections and policy seminar at this year's FidoCon.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Tax Games and Fidocon '92

It's always tax time and speaking of tax evasions, your entire
trip to Fidocon '92 is at least tax free under the rules for
business travel expenses.  You can deduct the cost of this
conference as one of many items : sales expense, professional
organization, subscriptions... the list is endless.

Over on Schedule E, there's a section 179 where you can deduct
the cost of computer equipment up to $25000 dollars.  Around
here that's plenty, I think, per year.  Use some of it to buy
neat stuff at Fidocon '92.  There must be plenty of businesses
that don't use it all, and you could find one if you didn't
have one yourself.  You start adding up sales tax, and tax on
non-income and it gets to be a healthy chunk.

A Day in the Life

Hi.  I'm Albert Witsbang and I run The Brick BBS at 19/187.  I
wanted to write and tell you what a normal 16 year old sysop
thinks is good and bad about FidoCon '92.

First of all, no way will my folks let me go.  Not only the
cost but the attendance by so many adults of questionable
moral standing.  They think I'll come home and be sick for a
week and miss school.

But of course, I can dream about going, and if I was there, I'd
certainly want to meet the founders, the movers and shakers of
Fidonet.  They would let me drink all the beer I wanted.  I'd
be free to do as I pleased and act all grown up.

Maybe I'll steal Dad's Buick and a credit card and come anyway.
But then, I'd get caught and probably lose my teen line, thus
ending my Fidonet membership ( well maybe I could sneak online
for ZMH ).  It's so cool to have a Fidonet node number.

Well, Mom's yelling for me to come to dinner, so I'll get this
routed off to 1/1.  Can't call direct or Dad will ground me for
the toll charge.  After dinner, I'll go over to Peanut's house
and check out his new copy of Alley Cat for OS/2.

Micromanagement in FidoNet
By: Erik VanRiper, erik@pdnfido.fidonet.org

After reading this past weeks FidoNews, and reading Pablo K's article,
along
with Tom's "editorial", I have to agree with Pablo.

Not to take sides, but one of the major reasons I left FidoNet was the
amazing
layer of micro-managment that exists in the upper echelons of FidoNet.  I
was
shocked and amazed at the blatent abuse of power here in Net 107 (of which
I
only reside in, but do not partake in), right on through to the *[E]C level
of Region 13.

I STILL get about 5 calls a week from local people asking "what should I
do..."
or "how can I..." or "do I have to..." about simple Net operations,
EchoMail,
and Netmail in particular.  I additionally receive a few (2 or 3) calls a
week
from FidoNetters around the globe wishing solutions to their problems.

In the ways that I disagree with Pablo, I will no go into, as I have
already
strayed from my original thoughts (probably for the better).  But, the main
thing that I see WRONG with FidoNet today is this:

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 9                      10 Aug 1992


*C's do not know/care what they are doing.

They hold positions of respect, and coordination.  For the most part, this
is
not being done at all, or correctly.  These people that have been elected
(or
appointed) are not educated, and are not educating their nodes in the finer
art of FidoNet.  This is a big problem.

Several years ago, I started the Programmers Distribution Network.  That
File
Distribution Network was meant to share information pertaining to an
important aspect of FidoNet - Development.  In some respects, it succeeded.
In other areas, it failed.

Maybe instead of offering up another layer of "government" in FidoNet,
FidoNet
should look into "testing" those that want to hold / continue to hold
positions
in FidoNet.  Maybe being a bit more democratic about the way these people
achieve power would be a change for the better.  Maybe I will come back to
FidoNet and find it a much nicer place to be when I was there.

The one lasting thing about my computer that I am having a hard time
giving up
(for personal reasons, and technical ones as well) is my domain.  You see,
I
now run a free Public Access Unix system.  But, I need a way to get mail
out
to the rest of the world (like this message).  So, until the technical
problems
are worked out, my computer still remains (in theory) a part of FidoNet.
That
will change.

My heart, however, will always be in FidoNet, and that will NEVER change.

Good Luck.

/* Erik */

Democracy in FidoNet?

I read with interest a recent article in FidoNews, by a sysop in Zone 1
(Pablo Kleinman) commenting on how there were elections in Zone 2 for
RC positions.

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 10                     10 Aug 1992


This precedent has, however, been recently been broken in the recent
selection of the RC for Region 25 - the UK, and I feel compelled to
tell the other sysops across FidoNet of the 'happenings' within our
region, I will attempt not to draw conclusions - despite my own strong
point of view - and will instead leave you to decide.

Paul Blitz, the most popular candidate in the election in Region 25,
resigned, and chose Stephen Cole - the NC for 251 and also second
elect - to become caretaker RC until a proper election could be
arranged and take place.

The expected election, was, however, not to take place. Ron Dwight -
Z2C, decided instead that he would place Noel Bradford - NC and NEC
in Net 257 into the position of RC.

This action has provoked a great deal of angry response in Region 25,
exacerbated by the new RC's refusal to read the regional administration
echo, and directly resultant from this at least two sysops have left
FidoNet - and a number, including myself, are seriously considering it.
Various reasons were put forward for the choice of Noel Bradford as RC
(who has previously stood for the position of RC in elections and
consistently been one of the less popular candidates), including that
Noel's unpopularity would be to his advantage as RC, and also - since he
was chosen by the ZC rather than elected by the Region as a whole - he

   ... have no problem what-so-ever with me being a teenager,
but, referring back to my friend, he was trying to get help
setting up a BBS program and got absolutely no response, even
though five sysops in the net were running it, and he is certain
the message went out.

   I read Andrew Grays's article from issue 931, and enjoyed it.
I must also say, at the begining, that I quite agree with him
... there is no justification for age discrimination.  But on
the matter outlined above, I am afraid that I have little
sympathy.

   Let me outline my own experiences.  I am 45 years old, and
have been a computer professional all my adult life.  When I got
involved in BBSing to the point that I decided to put up a board,
I first downloaded POLICY4 and read it.  It seemed quite clear;
the test of competancy required for fido is to get a board up
and running to the point that you can apply for a node number by
E-mail, and receive the number back the same way.

   Next step.  I downloaded several software systems, and about
10 megabytes of documentation.  I read it all.  I then set up a
board, tested it, and asked for a node number.  I received it.
At no time was I in touch with anybody in fido via any
technology but electronic. I was never asked for my age, nor
would any member of fido have any means of knowing my age.

   That was about two years back. Since then, I have been asked
on several occasions to assist someone in setting up a board.
The first two times, I did just that. I set them up a board. On
both occasions, after I spent some seven or eight hours setting
them up and teaching them the basics, they lasted less than a month.

   I have come to the conclusion, over time, that the way I did
it was the best.  It took me over a month to get things the way
that I wanted.  At the end, however, I understood how it all
worked, and did not need to annoy others with rather basic
questions. The other persons in the net also were not put to the
annoyance of setting up links and routing files to a board that
was run by a sysop of marginal competence and dedication, nor
the annoyance of removing those same links a month later.

   Currently, I view giving a potential sysop excessive help as
a disservice to both the net and the sysop.  That reluctance has
nothing to do with age discrimination, but is based on the
knowledge that "there is no royal road to learning". One has to
gain knowledge by oneself, it cannot be handed to you.

   In conclusion, the paragraph of Andrew's that I quoted at the
beginning of this article ends thusly:

   "He finally figured it out on his own a couple weeks later."

   Exactly.

Problems with getting node numbers
By: Rob Butler @ 1:124/3109 on August 7th 1992

  After reading Andrew Gray's article about teenagers having
difficulties with getting nodenumbers assigned (FNEWS931), I was
reminded of the situation here in net 124.

  It was near on a year and a half ago that I applied for a net number
here in 1:124.  At the time, I was 19, and had already been a sysop for
two years, and had been in Fido for a year (over in net 393, about 40
miles away.)  It was the end of the semester, so I moved back to the
1:124 area in anticipation of getting up again soon.  I sent a netmail
message to 124/1, as well as sending email from on his board itself.
Well, two weeks passed, and I hadn't heard anything, so I repeated the
same procedure, netmail and email.  Another two weeks, and still
nothing.  I again repeated the same, as well as leaving email to a few
of the local hubs (there are seven or eight here in the area).  After
a week, I still hadn't heard anything, so I began raising a serious
stink dropping off at least one netmail and one email to each of the
hubs in the area, and after about a week, received a rather rushed
phone call from 124/3000, as well as a netmail apology from 124/1.

  I figured that I had merely been overlooked (as was the case from the
contents of the netmail apology I received.)  However, over the course
of the next two months, I heard similar stories from other people that
had had their own share of problems getting a node number assigned.
But, by that time I was already entrenched into Fido again, and was
starting school in the fall again, and just let the subject slide.

  Recently (within the last month or so) one of the local hubs was
ushered into the 124/1 place as the last person resigned (which by the
way, no one I have talked to so far had any choice over who was
"elected".)  I didn't think much about it, since I have my own
administrative duties in three other networks I distribute.  However, my
point (Sean Peoples), who I have been feeding since last December,
recently decided that he too wanted to get a "full" Fido address.  In
the last few weeks (four to be exact) I've heard him complain about
124/1 and the inability to get his node number assigned.  This person is
also a teenager (16 to be exact.)  So far, he has sent four requests for a
node number.

  So, it appears that not only is there a "discrimination" of sorts
against teenagers in Fidonet, but that it is also happening across
several parts of zone 1.  My question is "why?"

                              Region 19

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 13                     10 Aug 1992


In response to comments made by Pablo Klineman and tomj last week I did
some crude analysis (by hand) of the Region 1:19 segment of
NODELIST.213.  I chose R19 because that's where I am, and that's the area
with which I'm most familiar. BTW, El Paso is in Region 19. :)

For those of you not familiar with the region structure in Zone 1, it's
pretty simple.  Each region is a geographic region of the United States
and/or Canada.  There are 10 distinct regions, numbered 10 through 19.

Region 19 includes just four states: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and
Louisiana.  The RC is Henry Clark, in Dallas, Texas.  Nice guy.

I found that there are 47 nets in Region 19, including Net 19, the
regional independent nodes.  I didn't have the patience to sit and count
individual sysops, so I just went with addresses.  In the 47 nets there
are a total of 1459 addresses (including /0s, hubs, and other duplicate
nodes), an average of 31 addresses per net.  Not bad, for one of the
largest regions in FidoNet.

How does this relate to division of the region, as suggested by tomj?
Or, if we take the idea one step farther, what about division of some of
the larger nets? Well, let's jump a little deeper with our
pencil-and-paper calculations.

<keyboardinmouthmode := TRUE>

Here's the address-per-net breakdown by net.  It's given in faithful
net/node notation, where the net is the net number, and the "node"
number is the number of addresses.

         19/38       388/38      3804/7
         106/156     389/15      3805/22
         117/32      390/18      3806/16
         124/170     391/33      3807/16
         130/87      392/8       3808/12
         147/115     393/9       3809/4
         160/94      394/7       3810/4
         170/94      395/19      3811/17
         380/15      396/42      3812/10
         381/29      397/21      3813/11
         382/118     398/4       3814/8
         383/20      399/13      3815/6
         384/14      3800/15     3816/9
         385/12      3801/9      3817/17
         386/8       3802/12     3818/7
         387/93      3803/9      3819/5

Remember, we're talking total number of addresses, not total number of
sysops. But the nets I'm going to use as my examples are so large/small
that it doesn't really make much difference.

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 14                     10 Aug 1992


I'm going to focus on four nets in particular:  106, 124, 130 (Houston,
Dallas, and Fort Worth, Texas, respectively), and 3809 (El Dorado,
Arkansas).  I picked these four for three principal reasons:

     o 106, 124, and 130 together could almost carry any regional
           election if every node voted the same way
     o 3809 is, by contrast to the other three, tiny
     o I know 124 and 130 best 'cause that's where I live

There's a definite advantage to big nets: cost.  In Dallas and Fort
Worth, the vast majority of inbound backbone echomail flows through one
system. Mail fund contribution is voluntary, and cooperation is good
enough that a dedicated mail system has been set up built from donated
parts and money.  Overall participation is poor, but it gets the job
done for both nets.  Both nets share echomail because of favorable
local dialing conditions.

There's a big disadvantage, too: personal relationships.  Lemme 'splain.

Take a look at 106.  106 has 156 individual addresses in it.  It's not
as large as 124, but serves as a better example because there is no
nodelisted Hub structure in 106 like there is in 124.

Let's say the net wanted to have a meeting of some sort, to decide in
person some bit of net business; say, they want to elect an NC.

You need to rent a small auditorium to accommodate 150 people at such a
meeting.  How many are you going to know on a first-name basis on sight?
You're going to need name tags, or you're going to have to like repeating
your name an awful lot.  The election of an NC can get done, of course,
but it's a little unwieldy.  [The last two NCs of 124, though, were
elected at pizza parties, so I dunno if any of this makes any
difference.]

FidoNet was started to enhance personal communication, to provide a
means for people to talk to one another and get to be friends.  Can you
do that easily with 150 strangers in a room?

Now let's say that Net 3809 needs to elect a new NC.  There are three
members of that net (remember, the figures above are addresses, not
sysops).  They can set up a time and date, and meet at a restaurant and
discuss any net business over a pizza and pitcher of beer (food and
nectre of the FidoGods!).

Which would you prefer?  I'd go for the pizza and a Coke (I'm not old
enough to drink beer). :)

Back when I first became a point in 130, three or four years ago, I
could recognize the names of the sysops in 130 on sight.  If you gave me
the name of a guy, I could tell you whether or not he's a sysop or not.
I liked it -- it was a mid-sized net, and mail sharing with Dallas made
things run (fairly) smoothly.

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 15                     10 Aug 1992


There are almost 100 addresses in 130.  A few months ago we started
assigning 3-digit addresses (Dallas, by contrast, has had 4-digit
addresses for as long as I can remember).  It came as quite a jolt to me
when Dewey Thiessen, NC at the time, said he was doing it because we
were running out of two-digit addresses.  I hadn't realized the net was
that large.

Now, when I look at the nodelist, I don't recognize half of the names on
it.  I used to make it a point to call each BBS as it was added to the
list and say "Hello, my name is...welcome to FidoNet, the monthly pizza
party is at...the local sysop's echos are...if you need help, just ask!"
I don't do that anymore -- I can't recognize new sysops from old ones
anymore.

I don't know a lot of the sysop's names anymore, and I don't like that
feeling.  I wonder if Tracy Perry (N124C) feels the same way about
Dallas...

There's another drawback to large nets.  Ever tried to conduct a
net-wide poll?  If you have more than a few nodes, hub-routing is a
must, and book-keeping is a nightmare.  In the last NC election
conducted in Net 130, 21 nodes voted (famous last words: "I'm just
wondering what I did to get 17 people mad at me!").  That can be done
with paper and pencil.  Wanna try running something like that in Dallas?
Voter turnout is likely to be no better, but in the off-chance that a
large percentage of the net votes, it can become a big problem very
quickly. Such polls can be done, no doubt, through good use of the hub
system, but why not break everything down to small enough chunks where
people can know each other as names and faces again instead of just
numbers?

And there's a third drawback: information distribution.  I was on
vacation at the time, but I can just imagine the problem of keeping
everyone up to date on the status of the last Great Zone 1 Missing
Linefeed Flap (a missing linefeed in a NODEDIFF broke about a quarter of
the systems in North America, resulting in a REAL MESS).  With three or
four solutions to the problem floating around, information distribution
becomes critical -- otherwise you could wind up distributing an entire
nodelist.  Not a good thing.

In large nets, where many sysops either don't carry or don't read the
sysop informational echos (NET130-type thing...every net has at least
one), such distribution has to be by netmail, again, unwieldy at best.
In places like El Dorado, Arkansas, all that needs to be done is pick up
the phone and say, "Hey, John, the NODEDIFF broke my system.  Here's
what you do!"  (* BTW -- I'm not picking on the Z1C or anybody else by
bringing up this event...it just serves the purpose as an example. *)

In short:  While we're at breaking up regions and rearranging the
structure of the Zone (something that I don't think will come about
anyway), we should consider breaking up some of the bigger nets, too.
106, 124 and 130 come to mind...  Mail distribution between nets can
still be cooperative (the 124-130 arrangement is proof that it CAN be
done), and is highly desirable if two nets are within local calling
distance.  But smaller nets make for a more personable, friendly
atmosphere.  Geographic divisions can still exist, of course, but the
FidoNews 9-32                  Page 16                     10 Aug 1992


old long-distance divisions of nets need to fall by the wayside to make
for better management of information, mail, and people. And make way for
better communication.

Which is why FidoNet was brought into existence in the first place.

Network Quoting Manners
From: Allen Prunty on 1:2320/110

I would like All sysops to consider posting this on their bulletin
boards for your users to see.  It seems as if 90% of all messages
that you read in the echos are mostly quotes nowdays.

Quoting is wonderful for jarring some scatterbrain like me
into remembering what the heck the message is refferring to.
but in many cases over-quoting is not that necessary since
most BBS's have message threading/linking capabilities anyways.

It's my pet peave to be reading a message that scrolls something
like 20/30 lines of quotes from five messages back including origin
lines from all quoted messages only to see at the bottom a two
word reply like "Yeah Right".  Some users simply take it for
granted that the net is free.  Sorry  -- NOT!!! ---

Here's a bulletin I have cooked up about Quoting.

-=-=-=-

Quoting with manners

1.  Please do not quote origin lines from other systems.  It is not
    necessary and causes sysops around the world to pay more long-
    distance charges for their echomail.

2.  Please quote only what is necessary to jarr the memory of the
    recipient.  There is no need to quote entire messages since
    most BBS's have a thread feature which allows you to trace
    back older messages.

3.  If possible... try to re-format the quotes to look neat.  This
    is easily done with offline mail readers.

Please remember... when you abuse the quoting features of some
BBS programs, sysops around the world will pay for the echos.
If everyone in the FIDO network would use the quoting features
more sparingly... the cost to import echomail would drop.

by Donald Tees
Ex-Libris BBS, Windrush Farm, 1:221/192 (Ontario, Canada)

    One of the more vexing problems of a BBS is what to do when
on holidays.  No one really wants to announce over a network
"my house is empty for two weeks, do not worry if the BBS
does not respond". That problem is even worse if the BBS is a
hub and others rely on it being operational.

    Recently, I installed a computer at the 6700 foot mark in a
mine.  Getting to it takes five hours --- and costs several
hundred dollars worth of man hours.  The problem is similar, and
our solution may be of interest to the rest of the net.

    We built a box containing a real cheap 1200 baud modem. The
only requirement of the modem is that it have a ring LED.
Fastened to the LED is one bit of a single board promable
microchip.  The microchip controls, through a second bit, an
optically isolated 10 amp AC circuit.  The PC is plugged into
that.

    When we detect that the PC is hung for any reason, we dial a
combination into the the second line attached to the cheap
modem. The combination is a programmed ring combination --- let
it ring 3 times, hang up, wait, dial and let it ring 5 times,
hangup, wait, etc.  The correct combination lock cuts power to
the PC, waits thirty seconds, then turns power back on.  The
reset cures about 95% of all problems without a service call.

     Now I recognize that using a modem is overkill, but one
must remember that a purchased modem also carries the right to
plug it into the telephone line.  It also comes with a power
supply, and is cheaper to buy than to build.

  If there are hardware gurus in your net, such a box can be a
easily built and lent out to sysops. The RC a can be given the
combination, and your home voice line used to trigger the unit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

                       Binary Nodelist AGAIN...

  Another suggested binary nodelist format:

Number,Namelen,Name,Sysoplen,Sysop,Phone#,ModemType,Flags,[#/!xx,Gxxx,
Uxxx],

Fields are not delimted.  Neither are lines.  All integers are
unsigned unless stated otherwise.  All 16-bit integers are given in
Intel format (LSB first)
  Number is a 16-bit integer giving the node, net, region, or zone
number.  Namelen is a 8-bit integer giving the number of characters in
the name of the system.  Sysoplen is an 8-bit integer giving the
number of characters in the sysop's name.  Name and Sysop are the
system name and sysop name respectively.  Phone# is the phone number
in BCD(*), with dashes or plusses translated to $A, and a $F
FidoNews 9-32                  Page 18                     10 Aug 1992


terminating the string.  ModemType is a byte giving the type of modem
as stated below:

First nibble is BPS        Second nibble is modem flag
     0 =   300             0 = No flag
     1 =  1200             1 = V.21 if baud=300, MNP otherwise
     2 =  2400             2 = V.22 if baud=1200, V.42 otherwise
     3 =  4800             3 = V.29          10 = HST 16800
     4 =  9600             4 = V.32          11 = MAX
     5 = 14400             5 = V.32bis       12 = CSP
     6 = 16800             6 = V.33          13 = PEP

     8 = 38400             8 = HST 9600      15 = H96
     9 = 115200            9 = HST 14400

 The BPS rate as given in the first nibble is the effective speed as
rated by the manufacturer under best-case circumstances.  This
includes compression at max possible compression.
  Flags is a 3-byte string which is a bitmap as given below:

   Bit:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
Byte 1: MO  CM  RE  LO  PVT DWN HUB RGN
Byte 2: ZON NET ERR HLD Uxx Gxx #xx !xx
Byte 3: <---Reserved---><--FREQ Abil-->

MO means that the system is for Mail Only
CM means that the system can recieve Mail 23hrs a day
RE means ????????????????????????????????????????????
LO means that the system only accepts mail from systems in the
   nodelist.
PVT means that the system is private, in which case the phone number
    (which in a St. Louis nodelist would be given as "-Unlisted-") is
    given as simply a $FF.
DWN means that the system is Down
HUB means that the system is a mail hub
RGN means that the system is the start of a Region
ZON means that the system is the start of a Zone
NET means that the system is the start of a Network
ERR means that the system's entry is incorrect.  Software should check
    to see if the address of the system it is running on has this flag
    asserted, and if so, notify the operator.
HLD means that mail for this system should be Held
Uxx means that there is a Uxxx field
Gxx means that there is a Gxxx field
#xx means that there is a #xx field.  THIS CANNOT BE USED WITH !xx
!xx means that there is a !xx field.  THIS CANNOT BE USED WITH #xx
Bits 0-3 of byte 3 are reserved

  The #/!xx field is a list of the zones whose mail hours the system
supports, in BCD, 2 zones to a byte, terminated with a $F.

  Gxxx is the Gateway field and is given as a string, the first byte
of which is the length of the rest of the string.

  Uxxx is the user information field and is given as the Gxxx field
is.

A suggested index format would be to store the byte offsets of the
beginning of each record but I leave that to the individual software
developer.

(*) BCD, for those of you not familiar with the term, is a way of
putting decimal numbers into binary.  Instead of converting the whole
number to binary, the first digit is converted to a 4-bit binary code,
and then the second digit is also.  The two 4-bit codes are then
combined to make a byte.  Since there are only ten digits, codes 10
thru 16 are free for control codes.

              LE_CLUB - The FidoNet Veterans Club
              -----------------------------------

     Le_Club is a social echomail conference that aims to bring
together FidoNet oldtimers. The echo is not restricted in any way,
except that it is only open to FidoNet sysops, and not to BBS
users. Still, it is recommended for those that have been in the
network for at least two years, although the more novice sysops are
welcome to come, see, and participate.

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 20                     10 Aug 1992


     Le_Club is a species of electronic FidoNet "con." It is the
place to talk about how each of us got started in the network, to
remember how things were back then and, why not, to talk about the
future each of us envisions for our dear FidoNet. It is also the
place to socialize with other "names" we have seen for long but
with whom we were never in touch, and of course, to simply talk
about the weather, share happy experiences as well as tales of dupe
loops, bombing runs and why not, thunderstorms messing around with
the phone equipment. :)

     There is absolutely no room in Le_Club for politics or flames.
Many of us have had differences with others -ranging from small
discussions to full-fledged flame wars- throughout the years, but
we MUST leave them out of the echo. In addition to this, Le Club is
not a technical echo, there is the conference NET_DEV that is more
appropriate for technical matters.

     There will be no moderator in Le_Club, other than the persons
in charge of periodically posting the echo's guidelines and
participation statistics, also known as the hosts or "Logkeepers."
By getting linked to Le_Club, you are committing yourself to being
friendly towards everybody, and to refrain from starting hapless
episodes. We believe it is still possible.

Rights On! 1:374/14

                      A_THEIST Echo Available

A_theism means free of religion in the way a_political means
free of politics or a_sexual means free of sex
characteristics or drives.

With that in mind and ever cognizant of the continued
pressure of religion to intrude itself into our government
and its operations, the A_THEIST Echo is provided to inform
and alarm and hopefully wake up the sleeping and too long
silent majority to the peril on our doorstep.

It is now a Zone 1 Backbone Echo Hosted and Moderated
by Rights On! [1:374/14] and Christopher Baker [card
carrying member of American Atheists, Inc.]. Initial links
may be obtained from your local Backbone source connection.
Zone 3 is being fed through 3:681/857 and Zone 2 through
2:241/6001 via a Gate at 1:374/14 until direct links can be
made to those Zones via the international Backbone links.
The Zone 3 Hub sends it into Zone 6.

FidoNews 9-32                  Page 21                     10 Aug 1992


The Echo is open to anyone who can discuss, without
proselytizing, the extreme desirability of maintaining the
absolute separation of State and church in this country as
provided for in our Constitution.

A sample of the first few messages and the statement of
purpose of the Echo is available as A_THEIST.ZIP from this
system anytime except 0100-0130 ET and Zone 1 ZMH [USR HST
V32 online] if you wish to get an idea of whether to commit
disk space to the Echo. An archive of the past traffic from
the Echo is also available as A_ECHO1.ZIP, A_ECHO2.ZIP, and
A_ECHO3.ZIP, A_ECHO4.ZIP, etc.

It has been on the Backbone for months. Ask your Backbone
connection to get it for you! The complete info is available
in the current ELISTnnn.XXX file available from your NEC or
REC or here. [Request ELIST.]

I hope you will join us or ask your Sysop to request a link
via their regular Backbone connections!

        The National Fidonet Dungeons and Dragons Gaming Echo

Introducing the DNDGAME echo for the playing of Advanced Dungeons and
Dragons familly roleplaying games!

Similar to the ADND echo, DNDGAME is also for roleplaying game
playing, but where ADND allows discussion, DNDGAME discussions are
allowed only in the sister echo, DND.  Another difference is that the
ADND echo has a waiting list for running games.  DNDGAME is not a
full echo, yet!

This echo is brand new and is not distributed on the backbone at this
time.  We are looking for a few good GMs and players along with some
kindly Sysops to help up get this echo running!

For distribution information, please contact Rob Richter at 1:292/49.

             HOLYSMOKE Echo is ready and waiting!

HOLYSMOKE is now a Backbone Echo that originally sprang
forth from Out in the Styx of Oregon. It is carried on the
Zone 1 Backbone and sent into Zones 2, 3, and 6 via
2:241/6001 and 3:681/857. HOLYSMOKE is Moderated by
Frederick Leff on 1:152/20. It is Hubbed out of Zone 1
by 1:374/14.

If any of you or your Sysops are interested in obtaining
this Echo, you or they should contact their regular,
Backbone Echo source! HOLYSMOKE now appears in FIDONET.NA
as of 26 Jul 92.

HOLYSMOKE is an Echo for debating the merits/demerits of
religions of all kinds in a friendly but contentious way.
It is open to anyone who cares to argue or cajole without
proselytizing or personal attacks. Wear your NOMEX undies!

The Echo is now fully activated and waiting for those with
an interest in fire or brimstone or a bucket of cold water.
The complete rules are posted regularly in the Echo and are
available in the current ELRUL archive published at 1:1/201.

Come and join us in the great debate!

CISANet and TQOTD_SUPPORT Echo
by Cal Gardner, 1:247/99

    Are you tired of the same old online games?  Do you think your
users
are ready for a change?  ISA, Inter-Stellar Annihalation is
door software
written by Eddie Karsai and James Hargrave of British
Columbia, Canada.
This is the hottest in Inter-BBS software.  For
those of you unaware of
the multiple features of doors written with
the Inter-BBS capabilities,
you are in for a surprise.  This
relativly new game ISA, allows you to
many things against players on
other boards through Fido compatable
messages.  This was the key to
create CISANet.  So far, the net has
rapidly grown.  CISANet allows
you to add boards to your ISA game accross
Canada and the United

States through the marvels of message routing.  And
it all works
fast and very efficient.  If you are interested in joining
CISANet
or just wondering what ISA is all about, freq the following files

from 247/99:

    ISA_005.ARJ (ISA) and CISANET.ZIP.

    Now also available from 247/99 for users of The Quote of The Day.
An
echo has been created for users of TQOTD.  If you are interested
in
receiving this echo, send NETmail to me at 1:247/99.

  Medieval Echo, Coming Soon to a Backbone Near You -- IF You Help Us!

 The MEDIEVAL echo, established in 1988, is about the arts, sciences,
 politics, attitudes, lifestyles, religions, other beliefs, etc. of the
 medieval era, aka the Middle Ages, and of the various societies devoted
 to its study and re-creation or re-enactment, such as the Society for
 Creative Anachronism, Markland Medieval Mercenary Militia, Great Dark
 Horde, Kingdom of Acre, Regia Anglorum, etc.  The main emphasis is on
 Europe, but other cultures are studied too.

 You're now probably thinking it's a bunch of stuffy academes discussing
 dry history lessons, right?  No!  Sometimes there is discussion of who
 did what when where why, but usually it is how-to instructions on a
 wide variety of skills, recreational event announcements and reports,
 songs, stories, poems, and other on-topic chat.

 There are now about two hundred boards in it, all over the USA and
 Canada plus sometimes Australia and Europe.  This includes Fidonet and
 some other FTNs, plus GT-Net (where it is known as "Life in the Current
 Middle Ages") and sometimes WWIVnet (the gate is currently down, but
 when it is up we link with their "Known World Herald" echo).  Traffic
 is typically about 20 to 40 messages a day.

 I would like to put MEDIEVAL on the backbone, including outside of Z1.
 If it is of interest to you, PLEASE ask your NEC to ask the REC to ask
 the ZEC to put it on the backbone (or whatever your regional procedure
 may be).  The DEADLINE (already extended) is August 15, so your sysop

 requests should be in about a week earlier, so HURRY!  If it doesn't
 work, you can still contact me to find a feed....

 For more information, freq MED_AD.ARC, MED_TOP.ARC, MED_LST.ARC, and
 MED_RUL.ARC, which are the ad, topology (link) map, participating BBS
 list, and (draft) rules, here at 1:109/120.0, any time outside Z1MH.
