     It seems longer than that,  somehow.  Call it 31,536,000 seconds.
     That feels more like it.

     That's  how long I've been editing FidoNews.  Not long,  I guess.
     FidoNet has been around lots longer than that.  Even FidoNews has
     been around more than a year.  Tom  Jennings  ran  it  for  quite
     awhile before I took over.

         A digression,  for the newer readers out there.  Tom Jennings
         would  get busy,  and sometimes the newsletter would be a day
         or two late, so he called himself the "Chief Procrastinator".
         Sometimes when a highly regarded college professor retires he
         is given the title  "Professor  Emeritus",  meaning  that  he
         isn't  still  a  professor,  but  he is still honored as one.
         Hence, Tom Jennings became our Chief Procrastinator Emeritus.

     FidoNet has grown a lot in the past year.  A year ago we only had
     about two hundred nodes.  The latest node list  shows  over  nine
     hundred.  Even  leaving out the nodes that are down and the known
     duplicates, we still have well over seven hundred nodes.  We went
     from one monolithic net to the present multinet  design,  with  a
     great hue and cry at the time,  but we've settled down now into a
     stronger and more powerful net than ever before.  We've also seen
     the birth of IFNA, which is still in its infant stage,  but which
     holds great promise for the future of FidoNet.

     The newsletter has grown, too.  When I first started doing this a
     year  ago,  I had to scramble for articles to publish each issue.
     Now I can publish an issue with at least a  reasonable  certainty
     that I'll have enough for the next week.

     There's more yet to come.  The new method  of  distributing  node
     lists  is  going  to save on everyone's phone bill,  while at the
     same time making it a little harder for a new sysop to figure out
     what's going on.  People are writing new utilities  and  add-ons,
     such  as  Outside and Server,  that add new functions to existing
     boards.  And  whole  new  FidoNet  compatible  systems,  such  as
     Colossus and SEAdog,  are coming out.  There's even a new wrinkle
     in network mail,  called Echomail,  that will greatly expand  the
     whole meaning of FidoNet, if it doesn't break it first.

     More people join in on our net every day,  adding their voices to
     our  mighty  throng.  THAT  is the true strength of FidoNet:  our
     wide diversity in backgrounds, hardware, and viewpoint.  We are a
     large and growing community of computer enthusiasts,  pooling our
     knowledge.  We have everything to gain, and nothing to lose.

     the problem with this new disease,  is the public nervousness due
     to the lack of understanding on how the disease  is  transmitted.

                          CommoLore Magazine


         Get ready for CommoLore Magazine from your local  FIDO  sysop
     this  April 5,  1986.  Yes,  that's right.  It's electronic,  for
     Commodorians (though not limited to them),  and available through
     FidoNet at no charge.  In fact,  IBM users may also be interested
     to read it for information about the Amiga,  the latest  IBM  and
     Apple challenger.

         CommoLore  is  a  revolutionary magazine because it is one of
     the first Commodore-orientated magazines to be available  through
     telecommunications,  specifically  FidoNet  although  it  will be
     available  for  direct  downloading.  It  consists  of  articles,
     reviews,  letters,  answers to commonly asked questions, and many
     other things.

         There are reviews of  new  products,  games,  utilities,  and
     books.  New languages for your C=64 and C=128 will be the subject
     of  some  articles,  as  well  as telecommunications,  education,
     games,  and others.  Plus there's  information  on  the  new  and
     powerful  Amiga.   We'll  also  be  covering  the  new  Commodore
     Information Service- QuantumLink.  In the premiere issue,  one of
     the  many  things  we  will  be reviewing is the Write Now!  Word
     Processor from Cardco,  along with Spell Now!,  Paint  Now!,  and
     Graph Now!.  Yes,  you probably haven't heard of it,  but we will
     be  extending  upon  things  such  as  its  large  text   buffer,
     conversion  to  ASCII  directly  to disk exactly as if it were on
     paper (great for writing electronic  magazines).  As  of  now  we
     have several columns that will be touched upon each month such as
     languages for the Commodore, telecommunications, and others.

         How can you get in on this magazine?  Well, CommoLore accepts
     virtually  any  articles  from  free-lance  authors.   If  you're
     interested in submitting an article or writing a column,  give us
     a call at the number below or write to us via Fido at the address
     below.  If  you  would  like to write an article,  send us a Fido
     FidoLetter before March 15, 1986 (for the premiere issue).  If we
     accept your article or request to write a  column,  the  deadline
     for the premiere issue is March 30,  1986.  The premiere issue is
     released April 5,  1986.  To author a column,  you must agree  to
     write  for three consecutive issues,  articles are not restricted
     to this.  CommoLore will also  publish  reprints  of  User  Group
     articles,  etcetera, if you'd like.  Commodore User Groups:  Send
     us any information you would like and we will  print  it  in  the
     CommoLore's User Group Update.  We do, however, reserve the right
     to reject any articles or postpone them until successive issues.

         The CommoLore publication will be available, for downloading,
     bimonthly  from  Uticom  Fido  BBS  120/5 at no charge or through
     FidoNet (with a paid subscription).  At 2400 baud the time  spent
     is  short.  What?  You'd  like  a copy but aren't near a FIDO BBS
     that has it?  Simply call us up and download  it  or  send  us  a
     check  as  described below under HOW TO SUBSCRIBE.  The CommoLore
     Magazine may be copied and distributed freely.  In  fact,  please

     distribute  it  to  every  BBS,  everywhere.  All  we ask is it's
     copied and distributed as a whole.

     RESULTS of a SPACE SHUTTLE RELATED QUESTIONNAIRE
     by Rick Pellicciotti
        1717 Denison
        Memphis, TN 38111
        (901) 362-7926
        FidoNet Mail through 123/7, The Think Tank



     In the aftermath of the Space  Shuttle  Challenger  accident  and
     amid  much controversy,  I decided to do a public opinion survey.
     I am active on several computer bulletin boards in my  area,  and
     on  several  of  them,  many  people  expressed  their  views and
     feelings quite eloquently.  What better place to survey?

     The bulletin board that is most popular in this area is a  system
     called  "Fido" written by Tom Jennings of San Francisco.  When he
     wrote his system,  he provided the facility for the operators  of
     the  program  to  place  a questionnaire on-line for the users to
     answer.  With the cooperation to several of the system  operators
     in  town,  I  wrote  a  questionnaire  which they placed on their
     systems  the  week  of  February  22nd  through  March  2nd.  The
     questionnaire   was   setup  so  that  the  respondents  remained
     anonymous,  not even the system operator could tell who  answered
     the questionnaire.


     The following is the analysis of the survey:


     Number of respondents: 57

     The  seven  questions are listed below with the results following
     each question.  An asterisk flags the top response.

     Question #1:
     Do you feel that manned space flight should continue?
       YES:*87.7%  NO: 3.5%  UNDECIDED: 8.8%

     Question #2:
     Do you feel that "proven" technology should  be  turned  over  to
     private industry and NASA limited to research and development?
       YES: 10.5%  NO:*68.4%  UNDECIDED: 21.1%

     Question #3:
     Do  you  want  the  U.S.  Government  to  build a replacement for
     Challenger?
       YES:*63.2%  NO: 19.3%  UNDECIDED: 17.5%

     Question #4:
     Would you be in favor of a one dollar earmark on your income  tax
     return for building a new Shuttle?
       YES:*64.9%  NO: 22.8%  UNDECIDED: 12.3%

     Question #5:
     What would you name a new Shuttle if it were built?

     Fidonews                     Page 7                   31 Mar 1986


     Question #6: Multiple choice; 1 = Highest, 5 = Lowest
     My confidence level in NASA's management is:
       VERY HIGH: 15.8%
       HIGH     :*43.9%
       AVERAGE  : 19.3%
       LOW      : 14.0%
       VERY LOW :  7.0%

     Question #7: Multiple Choice; 1 = Highest, 5 = Lowest
     My confidence level in the Shuttle itself is:
       VERY HIGH: 33.3%
       HIGH     :*38.6%
       AVERAGE  : 14.0%
       LOW      : 12.3%
       VERY LOW :  1.8

     SUMMARY:
     Clearly,  the respondents believe that manned space flight should
     go on.  All were given a chance to enter their  comments  at  the
     end  of  the questionnaire.  Those comments,  ranged from extreme
     cautiousness to energetic drive to  continue.  Many  expressed  a
     desire  to  fly  on  the  Shuttle themselves,  a testimony to the
     validity of the "Citizen in Space" concept.

     Most people who answered the questionnaire felt that NASA  should
     continue  to  be  in  charge of using space.  Many commented that
     industry should work with NASA in a  "joint-venture"  atmosphere,
     with  industry  providing  the  product  and  NASA  providing the
     transportation.

     On replacing the Challenger with a new Shuttle,  a majority  were
     in  favor  of  expanding  the  fleet.  A few questioned wether we
     should build another Shuttle like the ones we have,  or  build  a
     second  generation  shuttle  utilizing  knowledge gained from the
     existing vehicles.

     A large majority favored earmarking one dollar  of  their  income
     tax  for financing a new orbiter.  Many suggested that one dollar
     would not be enough, and they would like the figure to be five or
     ten dollars.  Clearly,  this would not be enough money to build a
     new  Shuttle,  but would make a good start.  A few suggested that
     private industry should finance a new Shuttle if they were  going
     to  use  it.  Here  a  lease-back  arrangement with NASA could be
     made.

     Naming the new Shuttle.  Unfortunately,  NO OPINION came  out  as
     the top answer here.  Perhaps because each of us were affected by
     the  accident  a  different  way,  many  suggestions  dealt  with
     patriotism,  courage  and  remembrance.  CHALLENGER  II  came  in
     second,  not  particularly my favorite as I feel the "II" reminds
     us too much of the "I"  we  lost.  Some  names  worth  mentioning
     were:  "Phoenix", "Explorer", "Spirit of America" and "Courageous
     7".  Some people were tasteless  enough  to  suggest  "Zippo"  or
     "Boondoggle".

     The questionnaire ran over the week of the public hearings by the
     Presidential Committee.  Although confidence in NASA's management
     remained  HIGH  there  were  quite  a  few more AVERAGEs and LOWs

     recorded late in the week as opposed to the first few days of the
     survey.  Confidence in the Shuttle system itself was HIGH on  the
     average,  as  the news media seemed to focus on NASA's management
     decisions rather than the hardware.

     COMMENTS:
     This is my first attempt at anything like  this.  I'm  sure  that
     someone  with  a  background  in statistical analysis and polling
     would have done a much different and possibly better  job.  These
     were  questions  that  I  was asking myself,  and I found that my
     answers and beliefs ran pretty much in agreement with the  public
     at large.

     A couple of people questioned my position about the space program
     based  on reading the questionnaire.  I am steadfastly supportive
     of the space program,  and very much want  to  see  it  continue.
     Hopefully,   documentation   like  this  will  help  to  convince
     Washington that manned space flight should continue  as  soon  as
     this  problem  is fixed.  I intend to forward the results of this
     survey  to  my  Senator,  and  the  National  Space  Society.   I
     encourage  each of you to write to the President and Congress and
     let them know how you feel.  I'm sure the result will be a  safer
     space program that will continue to benefit us all.

     I  would  like  to  thank  all  of  those who participated in the
     survey.  Most took it very seriously and responded to the best of
     their ability.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  Mr.  Bill  Paul,
     operator  of  "Think  Tank",  and  Mr.  Earl  Bates,  operator of
     "Grapevine",  for allowing me to run my  questionnaire  on  their
     systems.  Your comments are welcome.

                               SYSREPT UPDATE
                               --------------

     Many  (most?)  FIDO  Sysops are using a utility called SYSREPT to
     generate management statistics documenting their  systems  usage.
     SYSREPT  reads the SYSOP.LOG file created by FIDO and provides an
     analysis of callers,  times,  durations,  file activity,  and the
     like.  Many Sysops have automated SYSREPTs operation and directed
     the  management  reports  into  files  so  that their callers can
     easily determine new  uploads,  popular  downloads,  and  overall
     system utilization.

     However,  SYSREPT  stopped working when version 11q was released.
     The format of the SYSOP.LOG file was altered.  As  versions  11r,
     11s, and now 11t, were released the SYSOP.LOG file maintained its
     new format which is incompatible with SYSREPT.

     As the author of SYSREPT, I have been receiving network mail from
     all  over the country asking for an updated version that will run
     with 11t.  However,  I need help in understanding the new  format
     of the SYSOP.LOG file before a new version of SYSREPT can be con-
     sidered.  For example, this is a normal entry:

         ---------------------------------
         = DL ibm_file\arc512.doc   1  OK
         ---------------------------------

     This I understand too,

         ----------------------------------
         = DL ibm_file\fidodoc.arc  * limit
         ----------------------------------

     And this is fine also:

         ----------------------------------
         = DL ibm_file\serpent.arc  ERROR
         ----------------------------------

     But,  can someone explain the following examples which were taken
     directly from our SYSOP.LOG:

         ----------------------------------------------------------------
         = DL ibm_file\arc512.doc ibm_file\turbo.arc = DL ibm_file\turbo
         = DL ibm_file\arc512.doc  1 OK
         ----------------------------------------------------------------

     or perhaps this one:

         ----------------------------------------------------------------
         = DL app_file\ERROR TXT  1 OK
         = UL app_file\D&D
         = DL C:\FIDO\FIDO_NWS\FIDO308.NWS
         + 8 times, 41 min
         ----------------------------------------------------------------
     Fidonews                     Page 10                  31 Mar 1986


     Was the upload successful or not?  Was the Fido308  download  OK?
     Without  a  comma  between  the file name and the result (like in
     version 11a) it is very difficult to parse the result codes  when
     the file name contains spaces.

     Or, how about this gem:
         ----------------------------------------------------
         = DL ibm_file\pango.exe ERROR
         = DL ibm_file\pango.exe 1 OK
          ERROR
         = DL ibm_file\pango.exe ERROR
         ----------------------------------------------------

     These  are just a few examples.  The old version of the SYSOP.LOG
     displayed EXACTLY the same information but the  format  was  much
     easier  to  work with.  I have more "horror" stories collected in
     SYSOP.LOGs that others have sent in efforts to help me decode the
     new LOG format.

     I've been in communications with  Fido's  author,  Tom  Jennings,
     regarding  these problems.  Although sympathetic,  he can neither
     tell me how to interpret the new SYSOP.LOG  format  nor  will  he
     indicate that the old SYSOP.LOG format would be restored.

     Therefore,  I  must  sadly  inform  all  of the Sysops (and their
     users) that we must learn  to  live  without  the  file  activity
     reports from SYSREPT until one of three things happen:

         1. I figure out how to interpret the current SYSOP.LOG,

         2. A  new  version of FIDO is released with the old SYSOP.LOG
            format restored, or

         3. A new  version  of  FIDO  is  released  with  a  new,  but
            interpretable, SYSOP.LOG format.

     From my standpoint,  option #1 is the best choice.  If anyone can
     help, please send FIDOMAIL to me at:

                             Notes from Abroad


     I ordered two USRobotics modems a short while ago, one for me and
     one for Henk Wevers.  The modems subsequently arrived about three
     weeks later and I had to import them into the UK.  I had  to  pay
     about  50  pounds  for  air freight and then about 150 pounds for
     import duty and VAT.  I then sent Henk's modem to Holland,  and I
     believe he had to pay VAT again.

     Even  so  it  is still a very good deal,  and the modem itself is
     superb!  It needs a 110 volt power supply and also an adaptor  to
     enable  it  to  plug  into  the  UK telephone socket.  I had both
     modems on the same line but this caused several problems.  I  had
     two Fido's set up; both running from the same COM port.  I made a
     special  lead  up  that  "daisy chained" the connections from the
     original modem.  This seemed to  work  OK  sometimes,  but  other
     times not so good.

     If  I had a caller at 300 baud (V21) both modems would go on line
     at the same time and both would be trying to pick up the incoming
     carrier.  My Duplex (CCITT) modem would hook onto the  V21  tones
     and  after about 30 seconds the USR would drop out as it couldn't
     detect  a  valid  carrier.   Unfortunately  the   USR   sometimes
     connected  as well.  There could be a couple of reasons for this,
     but  I  never  found  out  why  for  sure.  I  suspect  that  the
     originating  modem's  carrier  was slightly off tone and made the
     USR think that the incoming call was at Bell tones.  Of course it
     tried to connect but the other modem had already seized the line.
     This caused some form of feedback loop and the USR tried to latch
     onto what was in fact garbage.  If it kicked in and  thought  the
     incoming  call  was  1200  it  would  try to phase shift until it
     connected.  This caused enormous amounts of line  noise  for  the
     caller and sometimes even made him drop out.

     I think this problem is not caused by the USR but by the incoming
     modem  not  transmitting  an  accurate  carrier.  If  the USR was
     malfunctioning it would do so all the time!  The second  possible
     cause of the problem could simply be line noise.

     As  I still wanted use the USR I decided to use my other line for
     callers at 1200, & 2400.  This caused several other problems, but
     it seems to be working OK.

     I believe that several other Country coordinators are thinking of
     buying the USR modem.  When this happens we will run our own mail
     slot to exchange mail and files at  2400.  Until  then,  I  would
     like an updated list of all new Fido's,  and I would also like to
     know if anyone else in Europe was running  at  1200,  2400  every
     night like myself.

                             The Rainbow Corner
                              by Ted Needleman


     As I write this, it is now the second week in October.  My "Great
     Free Software Offer" has been out about two weeks, and boy, did I
     ever get a response!  So far, I've returned over 120 disks, and I
     haven't gotten to the post  office  in  a  few  days.  I've  been
     really  gratified  by  your  response  and  your kind words.  One
     gentleman even enclosed a five dollar bill (yes, I returned it!)

     I appreciate the thanks I've received, but to a large extent they
     are misdirected.  All I've done is download  some  software,  and
     dump it onto the disks you've sent in.  The people who are really
     deserving  of  your  appreciation  are those who have allowed the
     fruits of their labor and creativity to be freely distributed.  A
     piece of software such as Tom Jennings' FIDO or Larry  Campbell's
     LCTerm takes literally hundreds of hours of work to develop,  and
     considerable time to update and support.  While neither of  these
     programs  are  in the public domain,  the authors DO allow you to
     copy and use them for noncommercial  use.  You  just  can't  sell
     them,  or  include them in your own "for sale" software.  Much of
     the software  available  on  FIDO  boards  is  subject  to  these
     restrictions.  And  when  you consider that LCTerm is as good (or
     better) than many  commercial  packages  selling  for  a  hundred
     dollars or more, this restriction is not at all unreasonable.

     So,  considering  the effort involved,  why do they do it?  There
     are probably as many reasons as there are packages.  Many of  the
     people  who  allow  you to use the result of their labor are just
     nice,  generous folk.  They've created something that  they  have
     found  useful,  and  figure maybe someone else might also find it
     helpful, so they share it.  For some, it's ego.  Programming is a
     creative process,  and a well designed and implemented  piece  of
     software  IS  a work of art.  And,  like many artists,  there are
     people who are justifiably proud of their creation,  and want  to
     show it off.

     Whatever  drives these people,  they are actively involved in the
     user community.  Have you found the FIDO bulletin boards  useful?
     Then  sign  on  to Tom Jennings' board (415-864-1418) and leave a
     "Thank You" message.  How about LCTerm?  Drop  Larry  Campbell  a
     note  at The Boston Software Works,  120 Fulton St.,  Boston,  MA
     02109) and tell him.  The  same  holds  true  for  any  piece  of
     software   you've   received  for  free.   Take  a  look  at  the
     documentation.  If it lists the author's name and  address,  drop
     them  a  note.  Everybody  appreciates  a pat on the back now and
     then.

     By the way,  Larry co-founded The Boston Software  Works  earlier
     this year,  and they have some very interesting sounding products
     coming out,  including LCTerm for  the  IBM-PC.  As  they  become
     available,  I'm  looking  forward  to seeing them and letting you
     know about them here in the "Corner".

     As long as I'm on the subject  of  involvement,  let  me  take  a
     moment  to  talk  about  user's groups.  If there's one near you,
     join it.  I've mentioned user's groups before,  as a place to get
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  31 Mar 1986


     help, but they're also a good place for you to get involved.  All
     of  us  have a responsibility to not just take,  but to sometimes
     "put a little back".  Chances are that somewhere along  the  way,
     someone  has  helped  you out.  You can even the score by helping
     someone else.  Even if you don't have the  answers  to  another's
     problems,  you  can at least help duplicate disks for the group's
     library.

     Enough moralizing, you get the idea.

     Speaking of user's groups,  one of the largest Rainbow groups  in
     the  country is The Washington Area Rainbow User's Group (WASH-A-
     RUG).  Their newsletter, edited by Carolyn Mack,  is outstanding!
     At the time this is being written, the newsletter is free, though
     they are considering charging for it.  Doesn't matter though.  It
     will  still  be  worth  whatever they ask.  Write Carolyn at 6415
     Adelphi Road, University Park,  MD 20782,  or leave a message for
     her on the WASH-A-RUG FIDO board (703/359-6179).  Carolyn does an
     excellent  job  of editing the newsletter,  and she's going to be
     doing an article on user's groups for an  upcoming  Hardcopy,  so
     keep your eyes peeled for it.

     Progress Report...Emulate-84, the Rainbow/IBM emulator, has still
     not shown up here.  I hesitate to use the word "vaporware", maybe
     they just keep running into problems.  The "IDrive", mentioned in
     the  last  couple  of  "Corners",  IS  going into production.  It
     should be available by the time you read this at a price of about
     $400.  I have been using mine for about a month and a  half,  and
     love  it.  It's  available from Suitable Solutions,  467 Saratoga
     Avenue, Suite 319, San Jose, CA 95129, phone 408/725-8944.

     So far,  no takers of the "Rainbow  Rumormonger"  buttons.  There
     must  be someone out there who wants one bad enough to "spill the
     beans" - come on and write in!

     Rumormonger Happenings...  I keep hearing about 2 new DEC micros,
     the PC-XX (said to be IBM compatible),  and the VAXmate  (an  MS-
     DOS/VMS system).  I'd like to hear more,  and as always,  promise
     to keep the identity secret  of  anyone  who  requests  anonymity
     (Deep-DEC?)...This  mornings' mail had a press release for a high
     speed tape backup unit for the Rainbow 100+.  Backs up the 10 meg
     disk in 18 minutes and costs $1190.  I'm going to try to get  one
     to  review,  and if successful,  will report the results here....
     Half-height 20 megabyte hard disks  for  the  Rainbow  have  been
     announced by DEC.  The RCD-31 is available both as the first hard
     disk  on  your Rainbow,  or as an upgrade for an existing 5 or 10
     megabyte drive.

                    NO NONSENSE BUSINESS WORD PROCESSING
                     New MS-DOS Dac Easy-Word Under $50

                                Mike Guffey

     It has been said often that many of us "fall in  love"  with  the
     first  word processing (WP) software that we use.  While this may
     not be the case for all of us,  it can certainly be said that the
     first  WP  software  we use gives us certain expectations for all
     future word processing.  This is the case whether we start with a
     "good" or "bad" program.  There  are  pros  and  cons  for  every
     commercial package on the market.

     Every  now  and  then  someone asks us for a recommendation of WP
     software.  And the wiser of us will  hesitate  before  suggesting
     our own preference and ask, "what kind of word processing will it
     be  used for?" This is an important consideration,  especially if
     the person asking the question is either new to  word  processing
     or  new  to  computing.  Few of us would wish the agonies we went
     through  on  others.   And  since  many  of   the   full-featured
     commercial  packages  cost  several  hundred  dollars,  the issue
     deserves serious thought,  lest  we  give  hasty,  ill-considered
     advice.

     There  are  many good WP products on the market under $100.  Most
     of them reside in the  realm  of  the  Public  Domain  and/or  as
     ShareWare.   For   many  reasons  those  types  of  software  are
     repugnant or undesirable to the business user.  And  whether  the
     Public  Domain is ignored by design or ignorance,  there has long
     been a gap in the spectrum of  commercial  WP  software  for  the
     business  user.  That  gap  has  been in the area of inexpensive,
     easy to learn and use programs.  Large (i.e.  expensive) programs
     almost  all claim their fundamentals can be learned quickly.  And
     this is true to some extent.  But full-featured programs  require
     a  significant  investment of both time and energy to prove their
     worth and pay their way.

     Many seeking WP software for their business are seeking  no  more
     than  a  program  to write business correspondence and to perform
     light-duty office chores.  Something on the order  of  a  "smart"
     typewriter, only better.  A product that can be learned or taught
     quickly  when  someone  moves to the desk with the computer (that
     does the accounting but sits idle much of the time).  Or  perhaps
     a  program  to  do  away  with  the expensive and kludgy "memory-
     writing"  monster  electric  typewriters.   Or,  better  yet,  to
     eliminate the need to hire expensive word-processing temporaries.

     DAC's  new  WP software is an excellent product to fill the needs
     of any business user needing an easily used tool  rather  than  a
     master-technician's  polished,  matched,  and  balanced  complete
     toolset.  EASY-WORD's greatest strength maybe  that  it  was  not
     designed  to do "everything" WP software can do.  What some would
     call limitations will be for others "just enough".  It is  not  a
     "full-featured" product, but it is surprisingly versatile for its
     low  price.  It  works  better  in  the  creation of text than in
     editing it,  but it can perform both functions well  for  average
     office use.

     The  program  requires at least two disk drives and 256k RAM.  It
     will work  best  in  combination  with  a  hard  disk  and/or  an
     electronic  RAMdisk  (if  the  system  RAM  capacity  is  512k or
     better).  But,  like the program  itself,  the  minimum  hardware
     configuration  is  "just  enough".  It  supports  a wide array of
     printers and (because of this) the installation process is  short
     and  sweet.  Its  use  presumes  a  basic  knowledge  of the Disk
     Operating  System  but   an   above   average   knowledge   (i.e.
     subdirectories and pathnames) will greatly enhance its utility.

     DAC  Easy-Word can be learned or taught in a few minutes.  It has
     online help available for all of its features.  Because of  this,
     there  is no requirement to learn complex combinations of control
     characters to get started.  It uses function  keys  which  change
     definition  as  different  tasks  are  performed.  (Their current
     definition is always displayed at  the  bottom  of  the  screen).
     There  are also 20 <ALT-key> functions,  all of which are related
     to  their  function  (i.e.  <ALT-C>  =  center  text,  <ALT-J>  =
     justification,  et  cetera).  The  program  can initially be used
     without  the  ^<ALT  key>  combinations  and  memorization  isn't
     necessary  since  online explanation is always available.  It has
     been designed with inexperienced computer users or computo-phobes
     in  mind.  But  it  doesn't  underestimate  the  intelligence  of
     potential experienced users, either.

     In  spite  of the fact that it is a basic level program,  it also
     sports some advanced  features  which  meet  or  exceed  industry
     standards  for  "full  featured"  WP  software.  In  addition  to
     search/replace   and   cut/paste   functions,   it   allows   the
     manipulation of up to 4 documents onscreen, via windows.  It also
     incorporates  a  database  oriented feature called DAC file which
     can be used separately or merged into documents.  (It is  similar
     to  mailmerge  functions of other WP software,  but the syntax is
     easier to learn/use and onscreen help is better.)

     Some  of  Easy-Word's  nicest  features  are in the area of print
     functions.  It supports over fifty printers and can be configured
     to support up to three printers on  separate  ports.  Because  of
     this,   there   is  no  complicated  printer-driver  installation
     procedure.  It will also support the following features for  most
     printers (without having to know the particular control codes for
     each printer):

             ITALICS | BOLD AND  EMPHASIZED | UNDERLINE
             ELITE AND PICA | EXPANDED AND DOUBLE WIDTH
             NEAR LETTER QUALITY | SUPER AND SUB SCRIPT
                             COMPRESSED

     The  various  type  and  print  styles  are embedded with control
     characters, as with most WP software.

     Experienced computer users familiar with the power and options of
     full-blown WP  software  may  not  care  much  for  some  of  the
     limitations  of  Easy-Word.  Cursor movement options are limited.
     (There is no single command to jump to the beginning or end of  a
     line.)  Formatting   and   justification   are   predefined   and
     alternatives  must  be  defined at the beginning of each session.
     (Some users may not care for the default values of a 10-character
     Fidonews                     Page 16                  31 Mar 1986


     margin and a 60-character line length.)  Users  experienced  with
     using  strings of control characters to perform functions such as
     SAVE & RESUME  or  SEARCH  &  REPLACE  may  be  put  off  by  the
     combination  of  keystrokes that Easy Word needs to perform these
     functions.  But in keeping the syntax simple  and  by  increasing
     the  friendliness of the environment,  this product will probably
     reach a market previously untapped by WP software publishers.

     There  are  only two serious limitations of Easy Word and neither
     may be of real importance to the average  business  user.  First,
     the  editing  of  documents  prepared  by  other  WP  software is
     difficult. This is because the documents created by Easy Word use
     non-standard control characters to  delimit  ends  of  paragraphs
     and,  in  some  cases,  blank spaces.  Documents created by other
     software which do not have the special characters don't sit  well
     with  the  automatic  justification of Easy Word.  (The documents
     created by  Easy  Word  are  more  easily  handled  by  other  WP
     software,  but  some  minor  problems  will  be encountered.) The
     second limitation is that the DELete function will not work  when
     automatic justification is turned off.  For most office use, this
     is  not  a  problem  and  there are ways around it (but they will
     probably never be discovered by casual users).  While the lack of
     these features keep the overall ease of use  high,  they  may  be
     enough reason to consider a more expensive product.

     The initial offering of Dac's Easy Word is at $49.95 and includes
     spell-checking  software.   As  of  early  December  it  had  not
     appeared in the laundry-list ads of discount  mail  order  firms,
     but  discount  software  stores  (such as the DFW area BABBAGE'S)
     were discounting its price by 15%.  (This is the best way to  buy
     it in the DFW area and will save purchasers nearly $15.)

     DAC Easy Word is an excellent value considering its price and the
     market to which it is geared.  For casual home use there are less
     expensive  Public  Domain/ShareWare products,  but these lack the
     slick,  well prepared online and hardcopy documentation that  DAC
     provides.

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+  "ARC"  archives  -  10  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296

                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
             Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
             DSBackup
             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

                       SEAdog Electronic Mail System
                      Special Offer for FidoNet Sysops


     System Enhancement Associates, the makers of the popular ARC file
     archive utility,  are proud to announce the release of the SEAdog
     electronic mail system.

     SEAdog  is  a  PC-based  electronic  mail  system  which is fully
     FidoNet compatible.  In addition  to  all  the  functionality  of
     FidoNet mail, SEAdog adds the following:

     o   User directory support, for automatic lookup of node numbers

     o   Return receipts

     o   Audit trails

     o   Message forwarding, with or without a retained copy

     o   Twenty four hour mail reception

     o   High priority mail for immediate delivery

     o   The ability to request files and updates of files from  other

     o   No route files needed!

     o   A full screen user interface that our beta test sites fell in
         love with!

     SEAdog  is  NOT a bulletin board system,  but it can be used as a
     "front end" for Fido (version 11q or later),  allowing you to add
     the full functionality of SEAdog to your existing system.

     SEAdog normally sells for $100/node, but for a limited time only
     we are offering SEAdog to registered FidoNet sysops for only $35!
     Orders may be placed by sending a check or money order to:

                       System Enhancement Associates

     Or by calling (201) 473-5153 (VISA and MasterCard accepted).


     NOTE: The response to this offer has exceeded  our  expectations,
           and  we  are out of manuals.  Our printer swears we'll have
           more manuals later this week.  We apologize for the delay.
