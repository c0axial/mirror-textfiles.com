       ============================================================

       This week's guest editorial is by Ken Kaplan,  the  National
       FidoNet Coordinator.


                          FidoNet Administration



       FidoNet has been growing by leaps and bounds.  It's not only
       growing  in  this  country,  but in other countries as well.
       Administering the net has grown to be an enormous task.

       So far we've been able to keep up,  but it looks  like  that
       will  be  harder  and  harder as time goes by.  The time has
       come when we need someone full time to keep up with it  all.
       The  cost  of  phone  calls alone has gotten large enough to
       make my company complain, not to mention the sheer amount of
       time I spend daily on FidoNet administration.

       I don't intend to make anyone do anything they don't want to
       do.  FidoNet is and always has been  a  voluntary  thing;  I
       don't  propose  to change that.  But there is so much that I
       can do, and should do,  that I am not at present able to do,
       that  would  make  FidoNet  better  for all of us.  I simply
       don't have the time to do the things I'd like!  There are so
       many services that I could provide,  if only I had the  time
       to   do   them.   We   should   be  advertising  FidoNet  to
       unsophisticated users.  We should be providing more  support
       to  the  beginning sysop.  We should be compiling a stack of
       ready answers to common questions.  We should be compiling a
       list  of  services  that  FidoNet  sysops  can  provide   to
       commercial  users  (for  a  price,  of course!) We should be
       getting involved in legislation that affects sysops.

       There are so many things that we should be doing, but nobody
       has the time!  It is all I  can  do  just  to  maintain  the
       national  net,  and  I see so much more that I could do,  if
       only I could spend the time on it.  I'm an amateur,  same as
       you.  I've  been  doing this in my spare time,  same as you.
       But I've just about reached the  limit  of  what  I  can  do
       without offending my company.

       I'd  like  to be able to spend all my time on making FidoNet
       better for all of us,  but I need your help.  What I have in
       mind  is  something  like freeware.  If you can see your way
       clear  to  send  some  money  to  help  out,   I'll  greatly
       appreciate it.  At the very least,  it'll help to pay for my
       phone bills.  If we're lucky,  enough people will  help  out
       enough  so that I can spend all my time working on improving
       FidoNet.  If enough money comes in,  then  I  can  think  of
       several solid, worthwhile services I can provide that you'll
       really  appreciate.

       Fido's #115/100 and #115/500

       I  have heard many complaints from sysops concerning the dis-
       tributed documentation for  Fido  Version  11.  The  problem
       does  not lie in the huge size of the file,  but in the over-
       printing used to produce bold and underlined characters.  It
       can take hours to print, if your printer can even handle it.
       (A surprisingly high number cannot) So,  I have created  two
       modified  versions of the documentation that do not use this
       tedious overprinting process, and put them in archive format
       for distribution as follows:

       FIDODOC1.ARC is the original documentation with overprinting
       via backspacing.  It is about 300Kb long when un-ARC'ed.

       FIDODOC2.ARC is a modified version that  uses  escape  codes
       for  bold  and  underline,  as  used  by DEC LA50/LA100 type
       printers.  It is about 250Kb long when un-ARC'ed.

       FIDODOC3.ARC contains no bold or underlining by  any  means.
       It is about 246Kb long when un-ARC'ed.

       These  files  are available on Sit-Ubu_Sit Fido #115/500 and
       at Illini Data RB Fido #115/100 (the  latter  requires  good
       VT100  emulation).  Possibly  elsewhere by the time you read
       this.

       PC Techniques
       108/62

       My board seems to  have  an  affliction  that  can  best  be
       described  as 'Fidorot' or 'Fido dulldrums'.  It seemed like
       an excellent idea to bring up a Fido system of  my  own.  My
       company  was  willing to provide the resources and I had the
       time and interest to  undertake  SYSOP  duties.  There  were
       only  a few Fido nodes in my area and it seemed as if it was
       getting harder to gain access to them.  I even came up  with
       what  I  thought  was  a unique idea for a theme.  But after
       less than three months in operation,  my board seems to have
       stagnated!

       There  haven't  been any new ideas lately.  The frequency of
       calls is dwindling.  Nothing new has  been  uploaded.  There
       hasn't been any Fido mail for days. I NEED HELP!

       Please  help  this  board to survive!  I'll listen to ideas,
       comments,  suggestions or any kind of help.  Please take the
       time to Fido mail your favorite freeware program,  new SYSOP
       utilities,  an article that you read last  week,  games,  or
       anything  of  interest  or  controversy  to  keep this board
       alive.

       This board needs a quick injection of activity.  If you like
       phoning  Fidos  in  other  places,   how  about  trying   PC
       Techniques!  We're  online from 6pm - 6am Weekdays and 24hrs
       Weekends at (513) 891-1947.

                 Miscellaneous Things That Need to be Said

       Well once again I've somehow managed to  find  the  time  to
       write  another  one of my amazing articles for FidoNews.  My
       main problem is that I've  found  this  amazing  institution
       called  Private  High School,  and for some reason they feel
       I'm a Senior and that they should be able to take all of  my
       time.  By the way, this institution is called Allen Academy,
       and if any Alumni is out there send money  or  it  won't  be
       around any longer.  Anyway I'm glad that someone created the
       index, it was just what Fnews needed.

       I  believe that I own the world's oldest IBM Pc.  The mother
       board came with 48k (in 16k chips).  Of course we  upgraded,
       but  our  BIOS is so old it won't except the 640k we put in.
       In fact we can't install a hard disk of any measurable size.

       I have a complaint!  The last time I looked at the  nodelist
       Bill Smith was the Sysop of Elite Software!  Well, I hate to
       say  this  but  Bill  doesn't sysop the board,  I do.  Would
       someone fix this please?

       I don't know how many people out there use  Volkswriter  but
       if  you  don't use it you should.  It spells now and is real
       nice.

       Oh,  yeah.  Every one that reads this is invited to my  19th
       birthday  which  is on the 23rd of May.  And if you want you
       can stick around and go to Commencement ball (24th)  and  on
       the 25th you can stick around and see if I actually graduate
       this year.

            : SOME THOUGHTS ON RUNNING A "NON-TECHNICAL" FIDO :
            +-------------------------------------------------+

           I've been running WeirdBase since March of 1984, and in
       those scant few months,  it has grown into the one  of  the
       most-popular  BBS  in  St.   Louis.  Along  the  way,  I've
       learned a few things that I think are worth passing  along.
       Most  of these come under the heading of,  "I wish somebody
       had told ME that!"


       LESSON NUMBER ONE:  THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHOSE
                           COMPUTERS DON'T RUN MS-DOS.

           And furthermore,  a  lot  of  them  have  something  to
       contribute!  What does this mean?  To start with,  it means
       that you should lose your copy of SQ.EXE,  and only use ARC
       and  LU  to  open things up,  not box them in.  Hundreds of
       Apple //, Macintosh, CP/M,  TI,  and Atari users will thank
       you.  Put  yourself in their shoes for a minute - would you
       call back to a BBS where  roughly  half  of  the  text  was
       restricted to people with a different computer?


       LESSON NUMBER TWO:  THE FIDO GENERIC ON-LINE HELP SUCKS.

           Maybe it's adequate for technical users and  as a quick
       reference,  but  otherwise  it's  just  blatantly  useless.
       Nowhere in the on-line help does it tell a new user what  a
       Message  Area  IS,  or  what  the  difference is between an
       upload and a download,  or what the difference  is  between
       the  E)ditorial  and  the B)ulletin,  or what he can change
       with the C)hange menu,  or any of the myriad topics that  a
       newcomer  to Fido needs to know.  Technical users will,  of
       course,  download the Fido Users Guide  from  some  system,
       memorize  it,  and  never  look  back.  Non-technical users
       can't or won't DO it that way.  The '?' command is  a  good
       place  to  put  a  few screens'-worth of good on-line help.
       Tip: make it specific to your board!  When you describe the
       A)rea-change command,  tell them what the other A)reas  are
       used for, and so forth.


       LESSON NUMBER THREE:  KEEP THE MESSAGE AREAS SMALL.

           There  are  several good reasons for this one,  and not
       the least of them is that each message takes up  4  kb.  At
       that  rate,  once  you  hit  a  thousand  messages,  you're
       starting to hurt for disk space.

           But the most important reason is that nobody  wants  to
       read  more  than  about 60 messages before jumping into the
       conversation.  When you consider how many 300  baud  modems
       are  still  out  there,  and  what some people pay in long-


       Fidonews                   Page  7               20 Jan 1986





       distance costs, you can see why.

           But what can you do for people who don't call  in  very
       often?  See my next tip ...


       LESSON NUMBER FOUR:  DON'T THROW ANYTHING AWAY.

           I have a long-standing complaint about bulletin boards.
       While  they  are  a  great  way to collect a lot of written
       material  in  a  hurry,   a  very   convenient   means   of
       correspondence,   they   are  completely  without  history.
       Outside of CompuServe,  where you can occasionally  find  a
       file  'something.THD',  old  messages  go to the same place
       where your lap goes when you stand up.

           On WeirdBase,  I have a sloppily-hacked-together IBM PC
       BASIC  utility  to  print  out  messages,  which  I  use in
       conjunction with  PC-Write  2.4  to  maintain  The  Message
       Archive.   The   Message   Archive   is   a  collection  of
       conversation files,  from all of the  areas  on  WeirdBase,
       separated  by  topic,   each  with  around  ten  to  thirty
       messages.  For example (excuse the truncated subjects) ...

           Any new user, or anyone who's been gone for awhile, can
       go to Files Area 1 and with the F)iles  and  T)ype  command
       locate   and   read  ONLY  the  messages  in  which  he  is
       interested,  then switch to the Message Area indicated  (in
       my FILES.BBS comments I show the range of dates,  number of
       messages,  and the message area for your replies) to  catch
       up on this week's contributions and reply.


       LESSON NUMBER FIVE:  STICK TO SUBJECTS THAT YOU KNOW

           Look  - no matter how fanatical your users are,  expect
       that (especially if you're just getting started)  somewhere
       between  20% to 50% of the messages on your board are going
       to have to be written by the sysop.  Users (quite  rightly,
       I  think) expect the sysop to reply to their comments,  and
       to lead off new conversations.

           I've been in science fiction fandom since I was a small
       child,  I'm  a  Neopagan  Witch,  I'm  a  gamer,  I'm  into
       political  philosophy and Libertarianism.  Wanna guess what
       the first couple of message areas on WeirdBase are?  That's
       right, after #1 (general), science fiction books and fandom


       Fidonews                   Page  8               20 Jan 1986





       is in #2,  science fiction TV and movies in #3  (I  got  so
       many  Dr.  Who  fans  that  they  needed  their  own area),
       Neopagan Witchcraft in #4,  gaming in #5,  and civil rights
       in #6.  That's what I know,  so that's what conversations I
       started.  Fortunately,  these aren't uncommon interests  in
       the St. Louis modem community.

           But I've tried several times to get conversations going
       on  subjects  I  knew  less  well  but  was interested in -
       BadFilms,  Punk Rock,  and so forth  -  and  each  time  it
       fizzled.  SOMEBODY has to take charge of a message area and
       keep it moving, or it fades away.


       LESSON NUMBER SIX:  ... BUT KEEP IT LEGAL!

           This  almost shouldn't have to be said.  For one thing,
       you won't last long on the FidoNet if you're  heavily  into
       illegal  activities  -  I  doubt if many Pirate Boards will
       ever even see this article.

           Here's the list of things that I've been avoiding  like
       the  plague:  phone  numbers  of Pirate Boards or any other
       information on hacking, phreaking,  pirating,  or crashing;
       any advice or suggestions on criminal activities;  anything
       to would be classed as "pornography" by St. Louis community
       standards (for example, ASCII nudes).

           By cracking down hard on people who do such things, and
       by  having  a  very supportive cast of regulars,  I've been
       able to get away with running a completely open  board,  no
       validation whatsoever (knock on wood!).  The people who are
       into   those   activities   leave  VERY  quickly  for  more
       hospitable boards.

           By the way,  I decided a long time ago  that  I  wasn't
       going to have much of any software to download.  There were
       three  reasons,  and  I  still stand by them.  First,  they
       discourage people with other machines.  Second, they really
       aren't that appropriate to a  non-technical,  conversation-
       oriented BBS.  Third, I didn't want the hassle of having to
       figure  out  what really was and wasn't public domain.  You
       might want to think about  these  reasons,  too.  Remember,
       there  are  lots  of  other  boards  from  which people can
       download software.


       LESSON SEVEN:  BE FLEXIBLE!

           If a message area isn't getting any new messages, don't
       let  it just sit there and rot - clean it out,  archive the
       mess (see Lesson Four),  and start something new!  In fact,
       an  empty  message area probably looks better than one that
       is stagnant.  And if worse comes to worse,  you can  always
       raise it to Sysop privilege,  so it doesn't even show up on
       the A)rea list, until you're ready to unveil it.

           On my board, I reserved area 9 for FidoNet, so I've got


       Fidonews                   Page  9               20 Jan 1986





       two areas just for experimentation.  At  the  moment  we're
       using  Area  7  in  a  group-writing  project,  and storing
       personal autobiographical messages in Area 8 -  but  that's
       very  subject to change.  In fact,  that's why a few months
       ago I re-built the whole board so  that  my  message  areas
       were  M!AREA1  through  M!AREA9,  and  my  file  areas were
       F!AREA1 through F!AREA9.  It encourages me to  think  about
       them in different ways.

           Star  Tzard (normally on 125/433,  lately on 100/22 and
       100/523) tells me that his favorite metaphor for BBSing  is
       the  Electronic  Cocktail  Party,  but I prefer to think of
       WeirdBase as the Electronic Science  Fiction  Convention  -
       with  nine  different function rooms,  and an ever-rotating
       schedule,  and everything caught on "videotape" so that you
       can review it later ...  What more could anyone want?

                      Some more thoughts on shareware

       A  thought  on shareware.  After reading several articles in
       FIDONEWS on the topic, I can't help but get my two cents in.
       Our office uses several shareware programs.  Among them, the
       PC Write, File, Calc series,  Pibterm,  and AUTOMENU v 3.01.
       Several utilities such as ARC are used, too.

       I  guess  what caught my attention was mention in an article
       about the personal check for Fido from an  employee  at  MCI
       who had set a Fido up for use in PC Pursuit advertising.

       Many  shareware authors make it easy for institutions to pay
       for their products by including a formal  invoice  or  order
       form.  Others,  perhaps out of a desire not to appear pushy,
       do not.  It is impossible for my  institution,  under  state
       law, to send a check to a vendor without an invoice.

       I  guess  the  bottom  line  of  this is -- Authors,  please
       include an invoice with your documentation or in  the  ASCII
       that  appears  on screen when your program is called without
       parameters, i.e.  ARC.  This will make it possible for those
       of us who wish to compensate you for your work to do so.

       I  hope this hasn't been offensive;  it is just not possible
       for some institutional users to pay  for  items  without  an
       invoice.

                               PRINTER CARE

                              Carol Bluestein


       Most  people read their printer manual,  plug in the printer
       and never  think  anything  more  about  it.  I  did,  until
       trouble developed.  It is a very helpless feeling to realize
       that something is going wrong and the trouble is electronic.
       Most  of  my work is on my disks and I need that information
       printed out.  Oh well.  The printer needed  attention  so  I
       took it in for service.

       My printer was not printing a line of dots.  I now know that
       this  means  that one of the pins was inoperable.  The print
       head was replaced and everything was  okay  until  the  line
       feed action was not consistent.  Lines were being skipped or
       printed at 8 lines per inch instead of 6 lines per inch, all
       without  my explicit direction,  and a different pin was out
       of commission.  I took it back to be fixed.  I wound up with
       a new printer board and a second new print head.

       Everything seemed to be okay,  until  another  pin  went.  I
       found this all very frustrating.  I had had this printer for
       10  months  with  no  problems,  and now it couldn't seem to
       operate for two months straight.

       This time the service people couldn't  find  anything  wrong
       with  the electronics.  It turned out to be something fairly
       simple.  The pin had gotten clogged with ink.

       There is a way to fix this problem,  and you can  do  it  at
       home.  First  remove  the  print head.  Take out the ribbon,
       and look down at the print head.  There  is  a  metal  lever
       that  swings  out and unlocks the print head.  Lift the head
       out.  When the head is free,  you will  notice  that  it  is
       still attached to the printer board by a plastic cable which
       has  a clear plastic tab just underneath it.  Never pull the
       cable itself; always use the tab.  Pull it horizontally, and
       the print head and cable  will  pull  free  of  the  printer
       board.  Now,  look  at the print head and find the pins (the
       part that is up against the ribbon).

       Take some WD-40,  and either spray it directly  on  the  pin
       heads or on a tooth brush,  and then carefully brush the pin
       head to clear out the clogging ink.  If you  want,  you  can
       then place some lubricating oil behind the pin heads,  where
       you can see their shafts.  To replace the print  head,  just
       reverse the procedure,  remembering to handle the cable only
       by the clear tab.

       And one more item.  Be careful when you use multi-forms  and
       textured   or  heavy  paper  in  your  dot  matrix  printer.
       Printing occurs when the pins strike the  ribbon,  which  in


       Fidonews                   Page 13               20 Jan 1986





       turn strikes the paper.  If you don't make the adjustment on
       the position of the print head in relation to the paper, and
       you  are  too close,  the thickness of the paper(s) can snag
       the pins.  There is a  lever  which  adjusts  the  pin  head
       distance  from  the platen.  If you are using thick paper or
       multi-forms, make the adjustment.

       I sincerely hope that this saves you time and money.

                 C R I T I Q U E :  P   C    P U R S U I T


       This article is a short  critique  of  GTE's  long  distance
       communications  service called PC Pursuit.  I have attempted
       to provide a maximum amount  of  information  in  a  minimum
       amount of space.  This document was written on 25 Oct 85.


       What is PC Pursuit?
       ===================

       It  is  a  data only communications service provided by GTE.
       It is  available  only  during  evenings  and  on  weekends,
       corresponding  to the times when reduced long distance voice
       phone charges are in effect.  It is  available  only  in  12
       major  cities.  The  service  allows a subscriber to make an
       unlimited number of calls to any of the twelve cities.  Each
       call is supposedly limited to one hour  in  length;  I  have
       made  a few calls longer than one hour and have not been cut
       off.  You can call  at  300  or  1200  baud.  Voice  is  not
       supported.


       How much does it cost?
       ======================

       $25  to  sign  up and $25/mo.  The first month's charges are
       prorated based on the day of the month you subscribe.  There
       is no (zero) charge for connect time,  number of  calls,  or
       for using 1200 Baud.  $25/mo is all GTE charges for ,as they
       say,  "all you can eat." GTE will bill your Visa  or  Master
       Card,  or send you invoices monthly.  Depending on what your
       local call telephone charges are,  your local phone  company
       may charge you for each connection -- see next section.


       How does it work?
       =================

       It  works  quite  well,  subject to the "problems" described
       below.  Each of the 12 cities has a local PC Pursuit  access
       number.  You call this number,  and a modem answers.  (In my
       case, this "local" number is a Zone 2 call and costs me $.07
       on weekday evenings,  $.04 on weekends.) The network answers
       and  asks  you  what  city  you want to call.  (I have never
       received a busy signal from the local  number.)  You  answer
       with  one  of  the  twelve city names.  It asks you what the
       local number is you want to call (in  the  requested  city).
       You provide the number.  It asks you if you want to proceed,
       or  respecify  city/phone number.  Your specify proceed.  It
       asks you to hang up and wait for a call back.  It hangs  up.
       Within  about 30 seconds it calls you back.  You must have a
       modem capable of answering;  when your modem answers you get
       a  series of messages stating (1) your request is on the GTE
       network, (2) your call is being made, (3) your connection is
       complete,  or busy,  or no  answer.  If  complete,  you  are
       automatically connected to the other number,  just as if you


       Fidonews                   Page 15               20 Jan 1986





       called using normal long  distance.  Otherwise  the  network
       hangs up, and you can start again.


       What are the problems?
       ======================

       The  biggest  one  is  that  a  1200  baud connection has an
       effective data rate of about 600 baud.  This  is  caused  by
       the  extra  computer  processing  done  by  the  PC  Pursuit
       network.  I have not tried 300  baud.  Occasionally  I  have
       gotten  a  message  to the effect that there are no circuits
       open to the requested city;  when this happens  the  network
       hangs  up after saying "Please try again later." Also,  on a
       very few occasions I have gotten a  very  noisy  connection,
       and  also  lost  the  connection  during  an upload/download
       operation.  In general,  except for the slow  data  rate,  I
       feel  the  service  is  at  least  as  good  as  normal long
       distance.


       What are the upcoming improvements?
       ===================================

       They will support 2400 baud sometime  during  1986.  In  the
       last  few  weeks  the network has occasionally redialed busy
       numbers 10 times.  They will  implement  auto  redial  "real
       soon  now";  I suspect they are trying it out on a few lines
       first.


       How do I get more information &/or sign up?
       ===========================================

       Call the  PC  Pursuit  information  number,  1-800-835-3001.
       It's  busy a lot.  When you get on you'll have 10 minutes on
       a stripped down Fido system.  The Files  section  has  files
       giving  the 12 cities,  access numbers,  availability times,
       etc.  You can download all of this data.  You can also  sign
       up online; that's what I did.

       I  hope  this  answers  more questions than it raises.  I've
       been using PC Pursuit since early September and,  except for
       the slow data rate, I really like it.

                              Rainbow Corner
                           by Theodore Needleman

       Finally,  a chance to catch up a bit on  Reader  mail.  This
       week's  seems  to  fall  into two categories.  More positive
       comments  and  encouragement  on  Project   Transport,   and
       questions  which,  surprisingly enough,  are all pretty much
       about the same topic.

       Project Transport looks more and more likely.  I'm currently
       giving  some  thought  about  how to identify those software
       packages to be tested,  and will probably use some  software
       guides,  such as QUE Book's as a start.  Several of you have
       already reported some IBM packages which  will  run  on  the
       Rainbow, and I will be listing these in a couple of weeks.

       I   still  haven't  received  the  IBM  emulator  package  I
       mentioned last week.  If it does show up, (and if it works),
       I'll  not only report to you on it,  but try to make it part
       of the project.

       This week's questions all seem to be about  the  feasibility
       of   using   IBM   peripherals  (RAM  memory,   hard  disks,
       multifunction boards, etc.) with the Rainbow.  There are two
       factors to be considered when discussing  this  possibility,
       neither  of  which  offer  much encouragement.  The first of
       these  is  hardware  incompatibility.  IBM  peripherals  are
       designed  for a bus environment.  All of the IBM's expansion
       slots lie on this bus,  allowing any card to be placed  into
       any slot.  The Rainbow does not use a bus structure (strange
       when  you  consider DEC invented the bus concept).  Instead,
       there are areas on the Rainbow  motherboard  where  specific
       expansion boards can be plugged in.  The connectors in these
       areas contain just the particular signals that are used with
       the  specific  board that belongs in that area.  Even if you
       could fit a disk controller board in the area  reserved  for
       the  graphics expansion,  it wouldn't work.  Add to this the
       fact that IBM type cards  connect  through  fingers  on  the
       card,  while DEC cards use a plug and socket scheme.  So you
       can't just "plug in" an IBM type card.  Beside the  hardware
       incompatibilities,  there  are  also  quite  a  few software
       problems.  Because IBM peripherals are used on a  bus,  they
       must contain some method of decoding when the signals on the
       bus  are  destined  for  them,  rather than some other card.
       Complicating things even further,  the organization  of  the
       memory  (memory  map) is different from the Rainbow,  as are
       the screen addressing and  graphics,  and  the  BIOS  (Basic
       Input Output System).

       As  you can see,  it is no easy job to use an IBM type board
       with a Rainbow, though, at least in theory,  it can be done.
       What  is  needed  is an interface.  This would plug into the
       various Rainbow connectors,  and the IBM type  boards  would
       plug  into  the interface.  Once this was accomplished,  the
       "BOX" would convert Rainbow signals into something  the  IBM
       peripherals could understand,  and vice-a-versa.  There is a
       similar type of equipment (at  least  in  concept)  used  in
       communications  called  a  PROTOCOL  CONVERTER.  In fact,  I


       Fidonews                   Page 17               20 Jan 1986





       recently came across a rumor that DEC has commissioned  such
       a  device  from  a  third  party  OEM.  I wouldn't hold your
       breath though,  I hear lots of rumors,  most  of  which  are
       wishful  thinking.  Even  if  this one turns out to be true,
       with DEC's marketing track record,  it  will  probably  cost
       more to buy than a fully configured IBM-PC!  If anyone could
       bring out a device like this for between $500 and $750, they
       would make a lot of money in very little time.

       Last  week  I  promised  to  spend  more time on the FIDONET
       system.  FIDO is a public access bulletin board system (BBS)
       that was written several years  ago  by  Tom  Jennings.  Tom
       lives  in  San Francisco,  and though I've never met him (or
       even talked to him) I have a lot of admiration for  him  and
       his  work.  He  put FIDO into the public domain,  and it has
       become the most used micro-based BBS in the world.  The FIDO
       BBS is an extremely  user-friendly  system  to  the  dial-in
       caller and most have a similar structure. There are two main
       areas - a Message Area,  and a File Area.  Each area usually
       has several (or many) sub areas.  On most FIDO  boards,  for
       example,  the  Message  Area  has sub areas for FIDONET Mail
       (more on this in a moment),  answers  to  questions  to  the
       SYSOP  (System  Operator) a "general" message area where you
       can leave messages for other users of the board, and several
       specialized message areas that depend on the orientation  of
       the board and/or inclination of the SYSOP.

       So  far,  the  FIDO  "system"  sounds (and is) great.  But I
       haven't  discussed  the  most  remarkable  thing  about  it.
       Almost  every  FIDO BBS is networked with the others (that's
       why it's called FIDONET).  Each individual BBS is a node  in
       the network.  and,  as of this writing, there are 306 nodes!
       This means that you can send mail,  in the form of  messages
       or programs, to (and from) any node in the network.  The way
       this  works is that the message is left in a special area of
       the board (the FIDOMAIL area mentioned  before)  along  with
       routing  instructions.  Sometime  during  the  early morning
       (from 2AM to 5AM),  with each board having its own  assigned
       time,  FIDO  collects  all  messages to a single node into a
       packet,  dials up those boards where a message or packet  is
       destined,  and  delivers  (transmits)  the  FIDOMAIL.   It's
       really quite remarkable when you think of it.  Every  night,
       while  most  of  us are sleeping,  all of these messages are
       zipping around the country (and world).  There is  generally
       a charge for using FIDOMAIL, albeit a very reasonable one to
       help  cover  the phone bill.  If you are interested in using
       this feature of FIDONET,  check with the SYSOP of the  board
       you use.

       Next  week,  I'll  discuss the process of up and downloading
       software, review some public domain software,  and give some
       more DEC-oriented FIDO board numbers.  See you then!

                                  Relax!
                             ARC 4.52 Is Ours


       There's a great deal  of  confusion  out  there  about  what
       version  of ARC is the "correct" one.  Is it 4.52,  or 4.50?
       Since this all started because of a mistake I made,  then  I
       should explain.

       The  "official" current version of ARC is 4.50.  That's what
       we have on our board, and that's the one we support.

       However,  we're still working on it,  as we  have  been  all
       along. (After all, four major versions in less than a year!)

       At one point,  not all that long ago,  I logged onto a board
       and saw that the sysop had version  4.3,  or  some  such.  I
       thought  he  would  appreciate  the  latest  version,  so  I
       uploaded it.  By mistake I uploaded an internal  development
       version, numbered 4.52.  Needless to say, I'll try not to do
       that again!

       At this point, I'm no longer sure just how 4.52 differs from
       4.50,  except  that you'd have to look long and hard to find
       it.  It also shouldn't do any harm  for  you  to  use  4.52,
       except insofar as it's creating headaches for us.


       I'm amazed,  and deeply gratified,  at the storm of messages
       we've received from concerned sysops and users.  Our  thanks
       to you all, and I apologize for all the confusion.
