                              From the Editor's Desk
                                by Warren D. Bonner

     Today I start a new job.  A job that was very unexpectedly given to
     me, primarily because I was one of the columnist in FidoNews before
     the untimely passing of our dear friend and editor, Doug Myers.  Doug
     was a unique individual, driven to present  the "snooze" in a manner
     that all Fido sysops would find enlightening; well covered in depth,
     succinct, serious, and funny, as the subject demanded.  He never ran
     from the truth, rather grasped it as a spear  to defend any concept
     that was pertinent to the story line.   I was reminded that I don't
     have to fill Doug's shoes, as that would not be possible; but to
     pursue the truth with the same diligence that he did.  To that end I
     dedicate myself.

     The learning how to use the software that formats all articles for
     reproduction in so many different editors is a trip you don't want to
     take.  It is a cloister of batch  files that have not kept pace with
     technical advances in over a decade.   My programming abilities are
     less than adequate.  Therefore,  I have prevailed on Joe Jared to make
     the antiquated MakeNews software more friendly and hopefully more
     usable.  This brings me to mention also, that I have named him as
     co-moderator of FidoNews.

     Although my health  has been a possible detriment  to my being the
     editor, I am happy to report that all is much improved over a year
     ago.  In conclusion I ask your patience with two "shorties" in four
     days to get the "Snooze" back on track. Ol'wdb

                             Makenews needs an enema
                             By Joe Jared, 1:103/301

     After a cursory analysis of the software used to produce fidonews, a
     few things become obvious.  First, it desperately needs to be
     replaced, and requires too much hand holding.  Secondly, and
     obviously, since it was originally written by System Enhancement
     associates (the authors of ARCA) , and since they were unwilling to
     adapt pkzip to the program, another individual patched the 1989
     executable to execute ZIP A instead of arca in order to use pkzip.
     That has been the extent of the development of makenews over the past
     11 years.  Given that this program was designed around the time that
     the SEA VS. PKWARE litigation was just finalizing the result is
     totally unsurprising.  From a purely software perspective, Makenews in
     its entirely will be replaced with something significantly more
     friendly over the next couple of weeks.  To everyone who has performed
     the task in the past decade, kudos.  Your task was difficult at best,
     and given the finicky nature of the software, you were the automation
     instead of the software.

                                   FTSC MEMBERS
                                by David Hallford

      The Fidonet Technical Standards Committee Standing Members are
      elected bi-annually. Roughly 50% each year. Sometimes this seems like
      a magical process that Fidonet Nodes are left in the dark about.

      What do you do if you think a current member of the FTSC is the
      wrong (for any reason) person to be on the committee?

      Using me as an example: You think Dave Hallford is a power hungry
      [illegitimate child] who is using his position on the Committee to
      try and consolidate his position in Fidonet so he can eventually take
      over. You know he is up for re-election this year, but have no idea
      how to register your protest.

      From FTA-1001
      ===========
       Standing members may be nominated Fidonet-wide by all of the
       following methods:

       1. Any RC or REC.
       2. A nominating committee established for the purpose by the FTSC.
       3. A nominating committee established for the purpose by the ZCC.


       Standing members are appointed on the basis of a vote by all RCs and
       RECs who are nodelisted as holding those positions at the time the
       nominations are published. A successful candidate must receive
       approval by a majority of votes.

       ========

     Currently the RC/REC method is used for nominations and elections. So
     if you think someone is not doing their job or is improperly using
     their position contact your RC or REC and let them discuss it with
     other RC's and REC's.

      After all - The FTSC is *your* committee.

                               Loss of Good Friends
                         By Bobby Queen,wizards@shelby.net

     Well folks I hate to have to write an article like this for the snooze
     but I guess its necessary.  This year has been particularly hard for
     FidoNet.  First we lost quite a few with apparent y2k problems, then
     others started leaving due to lack of callers on their BBS's and then
     the big problem with us losing some good friends due to death. :(  I
     have lost 2 real good friends in a short period of time this year.
     Both Kent Anderson and Douglas Myers had become good friends in a
     short period.  Both had become regular email pals and I considered
     both of them good friends.  Unlike friends you can visit with and
     spend time with in person these friends are sometimes more important
     to those of us who are unable to work and spend most of our days
     working on our computers.  I have already missed their emails and
     their short notes full of wit and support.  Both of them are going to
     be missed in FidoNet and although some others may come along and take
     their place in the echos they can never take their place in our
     hearts.

                          Famous Quotes

     Ah, yes, divorce......., from the Latin word meaning
     to rip out a man's genitals through his wallet.
      --Robin Williams

     Women complain about premenstrual syndrome, but I
     think of it as the only time of the month that I can be myself.
      --Roseanne

     Women need a reason to have sex. Men just need a place.
     --Billy Crystal

     You can say any foolish thing to a dog, and the dog will give you a
     look that says, "My God, you're right! I never would've thought of
     that!" --Sean Connery

     According to a new survey, women say they feel more comfortable
     undressing in front of men than they do undressing in front of other
     women.  They say that women are too judgmental, where, of course, men
     are just grateful. --Robert DeNiro

     I am not the boss of my house.  I don't know how I lost it.  I don't
     know when I lost it. I don't think I ever had it. But I've seen the
     boss's job and I don't want it. --Bill Cosby

     In the last couple of weeks I have seen the ads for the Wonder Bra.
     Is that really a problem in this country?  Men not paying enough
     attention to women's breasts? --Hugh Grant

     We have women in the military, but they don't put us in the front
     lines.  They don't know if we can fight or if we can kill.  I think we
     can.  All the general has to do is walk over to the women and say,
     "You see the enemy over there?  They say you look fat in those
     uniforms." --Elayne Boosler

     There's a new medical crisis.  Doctors are reporting that many men are
     having allergic reactions to latex condoms.  They say they cause
     severe swelling.  So what's the problem? --Dustin Hoffman

     When the sun comes up, I have morals again. --Elizabeth Taylor

     There's very little advice in men's magazines, because men don't think
     there's a lot they don't know.  Women do.  Women want to learn. Men
     think, "I know what I'm doing, just show me somebody naked.
     --Jerry Seinfield

     If you can't beat them, arrange to have them beaten.
      --George Clooney

     Instead of getting married again, I'm going to find a woman I don't
     like and just give her a house. --Rod Stewart

     The problem with the designated driver program, it's not a desirable
     job.  But if you ever get sucked into doing it, have fun with it.  At
     the end of the night, drop them off at the wrong house. --Jeff Bridges

     See, the problem is that God gives men a brain and a penis, and only
     enough blood to run one at a time. --Robin Williams

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
