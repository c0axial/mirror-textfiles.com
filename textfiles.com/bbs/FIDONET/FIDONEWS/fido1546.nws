     Greetings,

     Sorry, but I really do not have much time this evening to write
     as I'm preparing for a business trip.

     One item which I'm totally disgusted with, is this EchoList/ELIST
     issue.

     More on this next week.

     Have a good one.

     If one were to stand with one ear to the Z1C echo and one to the
     BACKBONE echo... and if one were to listen very carefully, then on a
     quiet day one can hear the drama played out by the Stars.  Actually,
     you probably don't need a hearing aid right now as the Northwestern
     Star moves into its ascendancy and the Southern Star threatens to go
     Supernova...

     The latest drama is about the lifeblood of Fidonet... echomail.  It
     opens in a small monastery somewhere in the Southern Star, where
     Brother John is dutifully installing the inscriptions of the new
     Northwestern Star to the Holy Writings.  Brother John is wary,
     though, when he discovers that the new star is supported by a
     FidoSpine rather than the North American Backbone found in all the
     faithful.

     The good Friar is wise to the ways of an ancient people who, as the
     legend goes, thrive on the very lifeblood of Fidonet.  Suspecting
     that Count Bob may not be One Of Us, the monk unveils the Mirror of
     BoFaq... and finds that Count Bob casts no reflection upon it.

     The lastest installment closes on a cliffhanger, as Brother John
     calls upon the OBO Almighty to expose the Count to the light of day
     and drive him forever from the land.  But the Count escapes to the
     darkness of his own castle, revealing that a secret pact has
     actually given him posession of the North American Backbone to be
     forever the Bride of Fidospine.

     Fans of Gothic Apocalypse should find this tale interesting.  We
     at Fidonews give it "two thumbs up" and wait with bated breath for
     the consummation.

     Dear EditorBeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (1:163/110) in the
     faint hopes that it will actually find its way into the
     Snooz on the fifth attempt. All appropriate small furry
     animals have been sacrificed as appeasements to the gods so
     that they can instill His Henkness with a vague
     understanding of what the word "editing" means.

     Roll da flic, Henk....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     I know that you have probably been as amused as I have with
     the news that Billy Clinton is wagging the dog in another
     effort to distract the public. For this month's diversion,
     he has chosen to make sabre-rattling noises in the direction
     of Iraq. If CNN's Christian Amanpour would take the golf
     balls out of her mouth I might be able to understand what
     she is saying, but I think the gist of it is that US air
     forces are slated to bomb Iraq back into the Stone Age,
     which is apparently a different Stone Age from the last one
     they were allegedly bombed into.

     As you know, I am not the least bit cynical and fully
     believe that the Americans are engaging in another live-fire
     test over Baghdad for reasons that have everything to do
     with "keeping the world safe for democracy" and other piffle
     foisted on the gullible public by the State Department. I
     must have missed it, but I haven't quite seen any democratic
     elections in Kuwait recently - that bastion of personal
     freedom which the Western world so nobly defended. One can
     only hope that the good companies of France, who never met a
     moral issue that wasn't flexible, will garner the usual
     profits by selling arms to both sides in the conflict.

     You'll be so pleased to learn that Satti's lonely November
     thought was a petulant rant to Lynn Gipson who had stated
     the obvious - that Satti was about as useful as dimorphisms
     on a nun. The rattling of poor Satti's thought was made more
     amusing by the fact that he claimed to be running Fidonet
     through a series of netmail responses. The good news is that
     Satti's term of office is over in March and one hopes that
     the various RCs in Zone1 will find someone with vital life
     signs to take over the role.

     I see that Zone 2 has opened the floodgates to AntFarmMail
     by allowing IP addresses into the nodelist. Under the
     well-intentioned guise of opening up communications to a
     wider spectrum of users, they have put the kiss of death on
     Fidonet. Their argument is about as specious as suggesting
     FIDONEWS 15-46               Page 4                   16 Nov 1998


     that Windows has made for more efficient usage of computers.
     The good news is that the new addressing will give Lisa
     Gronke, The Ministry of Fidonet Antiquities & Echomail
     Regularity, more things to talk about as she follows arcane
     paths and echomail routing schemes. The perpetual debates
     between Bob Seaborn and John Souvestre can now be seamlessly
     merged with the alt.guinea.pig.conspiracy newsgroup.

     For those Luddites who still read printed text, this week's
     recommendation is Nick Hornby's "High Fidelity." Hornby
     gives away a great many "guy team" secrets but the book is
     intelligently funny. Check it out.

     I must go, Visage. Your secretary has booked me to speak at
     this year's Swamp Swine Magazine Annual Awards dinner. The
     only award we won was for "outstanding fiction in petty cash
     vouchers" which was given in recognition of the fact that no
     one had ever claimed a brace of water buffalo as "research
     assistants." Your secretary is not a well woman, Visage, and
     the fact that she has taken up smoking cigars and winking at
     me is proof positive of that.

     Regards,
     Doc Logger,
     Furlang Island,
     South Pacific

                         NO ZEC NEED APPLY IN ZONE 1

     The Regional Echomail Coordinator's Council has emerged from months
     of secluded deliberations.  Their action on the Zone Coordinator's
     charge to determine the method of election of their chairperson
     is... no action.  The RECC has decided that it doesn't need a ZEC.

     Supporters of this resolution point out that echomail flows just
     fine despite the lack of a ZEC for the recent past.  Pundits point
     out that the same arguement can be applied to the RECC.  In the
     meantime, the RECC waits - ready to spring into inaction - while the
     ZC reviews their resolution to come to no decision.

     And no ZEC need apply...


                              UNREQUESTING ECHOS

     The R13EC has introduced a new variation to the process of adding
     echoes to the North American Backbone.  Normally, an echo is
     elisted, and then the moderator requests addition to the NAB.  If
     two REC's subsequently request the echo for their region, it is then
     carried by the BACKBONE, available to all.

     In an interesting maneuver recently, the R13EC "unrequested" two of
     the echoes under consideration.  It's not clear at this point
     whether this action cancels a "request" or if the action is strictly
     symbolic.  It's not even clear what was wrong with the echos, as the
     R13EC tells us that the original unrequestor has not provided
     further information.

     This looks like a prime candidate for WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING, but just
     in case the idea catches on, here are some other echos for future
     unrequesting:

     CPLUSPLUSPLUS   Assertiveness training for Fidonet Coordinators.
                     Unrequested by programmers everywhere.

     AERHEAD         Aerobic exercises for sinus disorders.  Unrequested
                     by the blonde lobby.

     ECHOLAW         Discussion of the principles of sound propagation in

                     mountainous terrain.  Unrequested by just about
                     everyone.
