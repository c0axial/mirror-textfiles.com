     Bill Vanglahn 1:1/90@Fidonet

         As the deadline for the biggest savings to attend this
     year's convention draws near (April 1), I wanted to clear up a
     few questions.

     Q. EXACTLY where is Fidocon being held?

     A. Fidocon '90 will be held at the Quality Inn Sportsplex in
        Lyndhurst, N.J. The hotel is approximately 8 minutes from New
        York City, and about 10 minutes from Newark International
        Airport. It is located on NJ Route 17, near the intersection
        of NJ Route 3 and the New Jersey Turnpike.

     Q. The price of $350.00 is a LOT of money!

     A. Yes, it is! But, compared to the prices from San Jose
        (Fidocon '89), it works out to be LESS. The price of $350.00
        (valid through April 1) includes hotel, meals, reception
        party, and the cost of the conference. Last year, people paid
        well over $400.00, for the same period of time (4 days).


     Q. I want to bring my spouse (and/or kids). How much would it
        cost for them?

     A. For you and your family to attend, the cost for a member your
        family is $175.00 per person, before April 1. The price
        increases to $225.00 after that. This price includes hotel
        room and meals.

        The latest information is ALWAYS available by file requesting
     the magic name FIDOCON from 1:1/90.

                      PRODUCT CHANGE ANNOUNCEMENT

     "Menu Master" has been sold.  Effective March 17, 1990, Dale
     Barnes of Montgomery, AL, is now the owner.  All current
     registered users will be supported.  A new updated version
     in currently in beta testing and will be released when ready
     with new docs.  All registrations should now be sent to the
     address below.  Once registered, you will receive your key
     via netmail.

     I believe Menu Master is a great package.  It allows you to
     create new menus for QuickBBS systems.  The upcoming version
     will also support Remote Access BBS systems.  You can change
     any menu or all menus quickly and easily.  It is menu driven
     which makes it a cinch to use and it also supports a mouse.
     Your ideas and registration will help me continue improving
     this product.  I would like to encourage you to register
     Menu Master.

     All registration and any bugs, problems or enhancements
     should be sent to:

      Dale Barnes             OR   Netmail to FidoNet 1:375/11

     A View from the Bridge

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9003.24"

     This week, I thought I'd take a moment to respond to some
     hatemail.  Thankfully, I don't get much, but Fredric Rice called
     all the way from Florida just to put me down, and I thought he
     deserved a reply.  Well, since he's not in the nodelist, and in
     case there are others out there who might think the same way,
     Fredrick, this column's for YOU:

     Explain, if you would, what racial prejudice and private clubs
     have to do with refusal to accept a system access request from a
     node that's not in your network.

     Is it possible you didn't get a high school diploma? Perhaps you
     have spent too much time learning about Jesus and ignored the
     real-world scientific methodologies expounded to normal children.

     BTW, just for the record, I take exception to your opinion.

     Because the basis of "if you're not one of 'my kind' I don't
     want to know you" is the same root of both evils.

      > Is it possible you didn't get a high school diploma?

     No.  Is it possible for you to express an opinion without
     flaming others?

      > ignored the real- world scientific methodologies expounded to

     I would respond to this, but frankly I don't see any
     logic/point/basis to this comment at all.

      > BTW, just for the record, I take exception to your opinion.

     And I disagree with yours.  But you don't see me taking you down
     on your own board because of it, do you?

     Have a nice day!

     Am I Indexes ? --

     7-10 The Death of Shareware and Other Good News -- viewpoint.
     7-10 The Big Mistake -- file archive comments.
     7-10 Big Blue Subterfuge -- dangers of cooperative processing.
     7-10 Honey Learns MSGED -- dangers of cooperative processing.
     7-11 In CASE You Wondered -- viewpoint on CASE tools.
     7-11 BBS For Sale -- nostalgic look at old front end.
     7-11 The Salesmanship Club -- dangers of cooperative processing.
     7-11 Danish for Honey -- foreign language processing.
     7-12 The Art of Deception -- high and low level languages.
     7-12 "Plug Away" -- machine generated messages.
     7-12 Interface 90 -- viewpoint on OSI.
     7-12 Tax Time, Honey -- working overseas.
     7-13 Am I Indexes ? -- global information indexing.
     7-13 Compuserve Blues -- problems with messages.
     7-13 The Big Trip -- rest and relaxation.
     7-13 Counting Carlsbergs -- little known facts.

     Since everybody is going to be back indexing the world in the
     90's, I figured I'd get a head start now.

     I suppose in about 4 years, indexes and indexing services will
     have grown so large, that they too will need indexing, leading
     to the Index Behemoth Corp.'s buy out of World Index and Media
     Production Systems by 1997.  This will leave only one major
     player who in fact, knows where anything is that you need.

     While you're at it, think about that nodelist...  Oh, and "Am I
     Indexes ?"  Yes, Plain-O-Dexes.


     Compuserve Blues --

     What's FIDONET got that Compuserve doesn't ?  The list is
     endless.  I am especially disappointed in the horrible message
     gathering facilities, now that CIS has become so active.  No
     archived message facility means you pull messages for later
     reading in LOG mode, straight ASCII transfer.

     I tried out the PC MAGazine forums, first the editorial forum,
     and then the programming forum.  What a pain in the butt.  At
     2400 bps ( really ) I saw no other way than to turn on SCROLL
     and start logging the messages.  It took an hour to pull off 4
     days worth of messages out of two forums.  ( Grabbing calculator
     ) that's almost 90 bucks per month!  Is it worth it, NO!  I'm
     thinking this is close to the cost of ALL echomail traffic for
     our net per month.  No comparison at all...

     I can see reducing online time by selecting specific threads;
     this amounts to a terrible guess as to suitability.  Something
     has to change.  I'll still use it to get the FILES though
     <grin>.


     The Big Trip --

     Well, it's travel time again for the Clark family.  We are off
     to Santa Barbara to visit my sister.  She's this hot EW
     programmer ( that's E-lec-tronic War-fare ).  Remember the
     Stark, the ship with the hole blown in the side by Iraq ( how
     embarrassing ).  My sister's system was the one to stop that
     missile, if it had been turned on.

     My four-year-old and I will hit Dizzy-land and pay a call on
     old Mickey.  ( Gawd, I hope his suit has been recently dry
     cleaned. ) A little golf, some work type effort in Thousand
     Oaks ( gotta pay for it you know ), and just some general
     stress relieving.  Sort of an OPUS-FAM for the brain.


     Counting Carlsbergs --

     Here's a little known counting method employed by Danes.  They
     count by 20s ( we call it a score, Danes call it a 'snes' (
     long e ).  Not only do Danes count by 20s, they use a sort of
     clock language.

     Like we say "half past five", Danes refer to that as "half till
     six".  Now we get to the counting and the Danish words for 50,
     60 :  it's "half till three twenties" and "three twenties" (
     you got it? ).  70 and 80 are "half till four twenties" and
     "four twenties", and 90 is "half till five twenties".

     Even more unbelievable is that a hundred is, in fact, called a
     hundrede ( long u ).  And a thousand, well it's 'tusind' ( long
     u ), but considering that Danes cannot make any of the dozen or
     so 'TH' sounds, this is probably OK.

     The 'ones' digits, you asked.  Yes, BEFORE the tens digits.  As
     in "five and half till five twenties", all that for 95.

     So now you know why Honey always quotes todays shopping bill in
     Danish;  I fall asleep before she finishes.
