                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     This is the final week in balloting in the IFNA election.

     This  election  is our  best  chance  at  Democracy.    It's  not
     necessary for IFNA to "win" this election for Democracy to become
     a  reality.  Just by voting,  one  way  or  the  other,  you  are
     endorsing a democratic process.

     The outcome of the vote  will determine if we want IFNA to be our
     democratically  chosen  organization.    But the  actual  process
     itself will determine whether or not we  want  one  in  the first
     place.

     If you haven't voted yet, do so --  this week.  December 1 is the
     voting deadline.  If you don't want IFNA, then  by all means vote
     NO.  If you are in favor of IFNA, vote  YES.    But if you really
     want a say in how things happen in FidoNet, then VOTE.

                 A NO vote is not a vote against Democracy
     Glen Johnson
     1:269/101


     I read with great interest Phil Buonomo's appeal to the masses in
     Fidonews 647, and  I wanted to comment on a couple of things that
     could be misconstrued by the network membership at large.

     First of all Phil  says that he doesn't believe that Fidonet will
     ever have democracy if the  IFNA referendum is defeated.  Phil is
     certainly entitled to his opinion, but  sysops  should be acutely
     aware that a NO vote in this  referendum  is  NOT  a vote against
     democracy.  It is a vote against the continued existance of IFNA,
     and that's ALL it is.  If the referendum  fails,  it  means  that
     IFNA has no control over Fidonet, for there will BE  no IFNA.  It
     doesn't mean that Fidonet can't be democratic.

     Secondly, he alluded to a case of vote tampering, and that the NC
     of  that  net is no longer in Fidonet.  Both of those  statements
     are  somewhat  true  in the sense that there was an allegation of
     vote "fixing"  if  you  will,  and  that  that NC is no longer in
     Fidonet.  The way Phil phrased his comment though, could lead one
     to assume that the  latter was a consequence of the former.  Such
     is not the case.  I know the NC he refers to and I can assure you
     that this NC resigned of his  own  free  will  for  personal  and
     economical  reasons.    He was also somewhat  disillusioned  with
     Fidonet "politics" and has joined another network.   He  was  not
     removed by the RC, nor asked to resign as a result of anything to
     do with the referendum.  It was 100% his own  doing  and  his own
     decision.

     The  IFNA referendum is important.  Its passage or rejection will
     have a  profound effect on Fidonet.  As an NC, I've tried to make
     it crystal clear to the members of my net that they are voting on
     the referendum as published previously in Fidonews, nothing more,
     nothing less.  A YES  vote  is a vote for the continued existance
     of IFNA, a NO vote is  a vote for the dissolution of IFNA.  It is
     NOT a vote for or against democracy,  for  or  against  a  policy
     document or set of bylaws, for or against  a  person, network, or
     group of people.  Plain and simple, if you  vote  NO,  that means
     you don't want IFNA around running the show.  It is by no means a
     gesture of anti- democratic sentiment.

     I am distressed by the barrage of statements made by an  enormous
     number  of  people saying things that deviate from this.  I don't
     like to  see  statements  like  "A  NO  vote  is  a  vote against
     democracy" or "A  YES  vote  is  a  vote to take over and control
     Fidonet".  Neither is true, and we need to keep the focus on WHAT
     it is we're voting for or against.

     If you have any question  whatsoever  about  what  it  is  you're
     voting on, I urge you to  re-read  the  proposal  in Fidonews 644
     beginning on Page 11.  If you  support  this  proposal, vote YES.
     If you don't support it, or are suspect  of  it,  you  owe  it to
     yourself to vote NO, and if you DO vote that way, don't feel that
     you've  voted  against democracy in Fidonet, because you haven't.
     You have voted to dissolve IFNA.  Period.

                          ----------------------

     [Continued from previous issue.]

     ================================================================


                    Setup for BinkleyTerm, version 2.30
                   -------------------------------------


     Use the following settings in the Binkley configuration file:

         ; Rev3
         Baud 19200                  [Or 38400]
         AutoBaud
         ; SlowModem
         Init |ATZ|~~ATB0E0H0M0Q0V1S2=255&K1&M4&N0|
         Prefix |ATB1&K0&M4&N0DT
         ; Suffix
         Busy |ATH1M0|~v
         Answer ATA|
         ; PreDial
         PreInit |v``^``

     Yes, use AutoBaud.  The FOSSIL will take care of locking the
     serial port.

     The Init string starts off by resetting the modem.  A good
     practice, in general.  The modem will not auto-answer, rather
     Binkley will tell it when to answer.  The modem is set to answer
     either HST or V.32 calls (B0), whichever the caller chooses.  It
     also follows the compression wishes of the caller (&K1).

     The dialing prefix attempts a HST connection first, then V.32
     (B1).  It also disables compression (&K0).

     Both of these strings reset the modem to ARQ (&M4), variable
     link (&N0) in case a specific phone number contains other
     instructions.


     ================================================================


                        Setup for BNU, version 1.70
     FidoNews 6-48                Page 5                   27 Nov 1989


                       -----------------------------


     Install BNU with the following switch:

         /L:0=19200  [L:0 = com1, L:1 = com2, etc.]   [Or 38400]

     You can also adjust size of the receive and transmit buffers,
     which default to 1K, with these switches (shown at 4K each):

         /R:4096
         /T:4096

     BNU also offers another switch:

         /Z:x

     where x is a number from 0 to 5.  This switch controls the
     configuration of the 16550a's FIFOs.  The default (0) is to not
     interrupt till the FIFO is nearly full.  If you find that you
     are losing characters increase x till the problem stops.  This
     will keep your interrupt overhead as low as possible, within the
     bounds of the interrupt latency that your system can handle.


     ================================================================


                      Setup for DSZ, version 10/24/89
                     ---------------------------------


     ZModem works great with the HST!  Here are typical command lines
     for receive:

             DSZ port 1 handshake on rz -rr

     and send:

             DSZ port 1 handshake on sz -Z -rr filename.ext


     ================================================================


                       Setup for Opus, version 1.03b
                      -------------------------------


     Opus does not allow 38400 bps, so 19200 bps must be used.  Note
     that if you are running a mailer program ahead of Opus, this
     program is the one which will set the modem speed, so it doesn't
     really matter what you put here for Opus.

     FidoNews 6-48                Page 6                   27 Nov 1989


     Use the following settings in the Opus parameter file:

         Baud 19200
         Modem Init |~~~~ATZ|        [continued on next line]
                    ~~~~~~~~ATB0E0H0M0Q0V1S0=1S2=255&K1&M4&N0|~~~~
         Modem Steady
         Modem Dial Prefix |~~~~ATB1&K0&M4&N0DT
         Modem Dial Suffix |~~~~
         Modem Busy |~~~~v~~~~^~~~~ATH1M0|~~~~~~~~v~~~~
         Mask HandShaking Xon
         Mask HandShaking Cts

     Please note that the "~" delay character in Opus is not a fixed
     amount of time.  It depends on the speed of the machine.  Thus,
     for a faster machine you will need more "~" characters.  The
     number shown above are for a 10 MHz, 0 wait, 80286.

     The Init string starts off by resetting the modem.  A good
     practice, in general.  The modem will not auto-answer, rather
     Binkley will tell it when to answer.  The modem is set to answer
     either HST or V.32 calls (B0), whichever the caller chooses.  It
     also follows the compression wishes of the caller (&K1).

     The dialing prefix attempts a HST connection first, then V.32
     (B1).  It also disables compression (&K0).

     Both of these strings reset the modem to ARQ (&M4), variable
     link (&N0) in case a specific phone number contains other
     instructions.


     ================================================================


                     Setup for OpusComm, version 5.31
                    ----------------------------------


     Configure OpusComm by running OCom_Cfg with the following switch:

         L1=19200            [L1 = com1, L2 = com2]    [Or 38400]

     You can also adjust size of the receive and transmit buffers,
     which default to 4K, with this switch (shown at 4K each):

         S1=4096,4096        [S1 = com1, S2 = com2]

                   Setup for ProComm Plus, version 1.1b
                  --------------------------------------


     ProComm Plus does not allow 38400 bps in the dialing directory,
     so 19200 bps must be used.  Also, ProComm Plus does not support
     the 16550a.

     Dialing Directory - Entries:

         Set all entries to 19200.

     The default is to call at 14400 bps with ARQ enabled.  The first
     time you call a new number (ex: 555-1212) wait till you see the
     CONNECT message then look at the ARQ light on the modem.  If the
     light is on then suffix the phone number with "-A" (ex:
     555-1212-A).  If the light is out then suffix the phone number
     with "-B" (ex: 555-1212-B).  Disabling ARQ will speed up the
     connection by about 5 seconds.  The "-A" suffix does nothing,
     functionally, but lets you know that you have determined that
     this phone number does have ARQ and makes your directory entries
     line up.  Note:  To connect at 9600 bps ARQ must be enabled.

     The "-C", "-D", and "-E" suffixes (use only 1 at a time) will
     limit the modem to 300, 1200, or 2400 bps, respectively.  This
     is handy for testing and diagnosing problems.  Ex: 555-1212-BD.
     This would force a troublesome 2400 bps modem to connect at 1200
     bps.

     Note:  When connecting with ARQ the connect message will include
     "/ARQ" (ex: CONNECT 2400/ARQ).  ProComm Plus ignores the "/ARQ"
     but the software at the other end may not.  The result may be
     that you can connect to the other modem, but the other CPU will
     not recognize its modem's connect message.  By disabling ARQ
     ("-B") and calling back you should be able to get through.  When
     you do, tell the other person that he either needs to change his
     software to recognize his ARQ connect message, or he needs to
     disable the ARQ part of the connect message.  If he has an HST,
     the "&A0" command will do this.


     ================================================================


                      Setup for QModem, version 4.1b
                     --------------------------------


     Start up Qmodem.  Press Alt-N to bring up the configuration
     menu.

     Select (M)odem, (C)ommunication Parameters.  Change (A) Default
     Baud Rate to 19200.

     Go back to the main configuration menu.  Select (O)ption,
     (T)oggles.  Change (C)TS Signal to ON.  You may also want to
     change CTS When (W)riting to ON; consult the Qmodem
     documentation for more details on this option.  Change (R)edial
     Sets Baud to OFF (so that the bps rate will be fixed at whatever
     you have in the dialing directory [usually 19200]).

     FidoNews 6-48                Page 9                   27 Nov 1989


     Be sure to save the new settings before exiting the
     configuration menu.

     Bring up the dialing directory (Alt-D).

     Set up some dialing suffixes as shown in the ProComm Plus
     section.

     Change the dialing directory entries for all HST-equipped boards
     to 19200 bps. You should also change the bps rate to 19200 for
     all low-speed MNP connections (in case the other modem has MNP
     level 5, then you can take advantage of the modems' data
     compression feature).  You may want to go ahead and change all
     entries to 19200 bps, although this is not necessary.  To force
     a connection at a lower bps rate, set the dialing directory
     appropriately (rather than using dialing suffixes).  As needed,
     add dialing suffixes to the phone numbers to set ARQ mode and
     data compression mode.  If you've changed all entries to 19200
     bps add suffixes to force a lower connection rate as necessary.

     Ifna - Why Apathy Will Win
     By Steve Townsley
     2:256/117

     About 2 years ago I wrote a short article in FidoNews criticising
     the insular nature of Ifna. My main criticism was that North
     American SysOps (Zone 1) had decided to set-up an international
     association without even asking non-US SysOps whether one was
     neccessary.

     This was not a flame against Ifna. In fact having listened to Don
     Daniels (the then Ifna President) at Eurocon in 1988 I am
     convinced of the sincere wishes of all Ifna 'believers' to create
     a useful organisation.

     What I worry about in the current Ifna ballot is the same thing I
     have always worried about:- the assumption by Zone 1 SysOps that
     every SysOp in every Zone shares the same goals for FidoNet, and
     the same ideas about how it should be organised. This conception
     that everyone of FidoNet as a whole is a mistaken one and runs
     through all Ifna documentation.

     Bluntly a ballot will tell you less about Ifna now than it might
     have done on day one. This is partly because the networks outside
     the United States are more mature and partly because US SysOps
     have always had the grand idea that a corporation in Missouri (or
     wherever) can represent the divers needs of FidoNet.

     Happily I know some US SysOps - particularly those involved with
     international Echomail know how diverse FidoNet is.

     So now that I have you in the mood to make a proposal... I am
     going to refuse to do so!

     It is not for me, or anyone else, to tell a Zone, a Region or a
     network how to organise. The glue that binds FidoNet together is
     FidoNews, the Nodelist, the National Mail Hour, and the
     capability of netmail. Elusive concepts like representation,
     democracy and other things do not unite every SysOp.

     If Ifna is to be meaningful it must take on a role more suited to
     an international organisation. Defining standards, distributing
     the nodelist, FidoNews, resolving disputes. It's funding must
     come from appropriate other organisations like, for example a
     North American FidoNet Association or a European FidoNet
     Association.

     In a sentence, Ifna's best role is as a co-ordinator, an
     organisation created by other organisations to maintain the
     network as a whole.

     FidoNews 6-48                Page 12                  27 Nov 1989


     The current ballot seeks to change Ifna from representing some US
     SysOps (by virtue of paying the subscription) to representing all
     SysOps by declaration. Neither of these solutions is satisfactory
     and FidoNet will be hit by a wave of apathy. The resolution
     itself speaks of a cry from SysOps for democracy. That may be
     true but it must be democracy of a human scale. It is no good
     giving a SysOp the right to vote for a corporation based in
     Missouri if he needs the support of an organisation to help him
     with mailing his Host in southern Italy.

     WARNING: The same mistake is going to be made again.

     If you want to change Ifna in the United States create an
     American FidoNet Association based on your principles, your
     policies, your ideas. Then explore ways of co-operation with
     other associations, zones or regions. Out of this will emerge an
     international association responding to mutual needs.
