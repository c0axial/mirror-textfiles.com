     Keeping Echomail in perspective
     * By Joe Jared (1:103/301) joejared@osirusoft.com

     In order to understand the failure of echomail we must also
     look at the success of Usenet newsgroups.  Our audience of
     10 years ago has gone to newsgroups, and fidonet's survival
     is dependent on finding new ways of doing things.

     A few statistics about the delivery of echomail.  Between a
     few of the major distribution systems there are close to 800
     echoes, roughly speaking.  All totaled, about 3 megabytes of
     uncompressed mail flow through the backbone.  Of these
     echoes, close to 200 of these echoes have had zero traffic
     in the past 30 days, and some have had no traffic in months.
     In my own logs, the following are the top 10 areas:


                                    EchoMail Traffic
                                    ================
                            Period: 1999-10-26 to 1999-11-21

     AREA NAME                  TOTAL AVERAGE   TRAFFIC
     REC.ARTS.COMICS.STRIPS      1958      72     2.37% !
     POLITICS                    2162      80     2.62%
     REC.AQUARIA.MARINE.REEFS    2207      81     2.68% !
     HOLYSMOKE                   2339      86     2.84%
     REC.AUTOS.TECH              2779     102     3.37% !
     COMP.DCOM.XDSL              2922     108     3.54% !
     COMP.LANG.C                 3541     131     4.29% !
     REC.RADIO.CB                3919     145     4.75% !
     REC.MOTORCYCLES             5639     208     6.84% !
     REC.AUTOS.SPORT.NASCAR      6020     222     7.30% !

     Note that there is no central theme to the above list,
     except that political and religious discussions were the
     only things that were able to make it into the top 10 areas.
     Looking at my nightly logs from my own news server confirms
     that the top listed gated newsgroups are also reflected in
     the list. There is no bias, and occasional posts in
     1backbone also reflect this fact.

     Excluding newsgroups, for the usenet impaired, and simply
     going with echoes, the "winners" last month in volume
     were...

     Given the above statistics, I personally am left to wonder
     what would happen if we collectively spent as much energy
     improving fidonet as we did fighting with each other.  If
     something isn't done to reduce or eliminate unnecessary
     control and bickering, we will likely become a network of
     administrators, with nothing to administer.  As we are now,
     we're truely unimportant in the big scheme of mail movers,
     excluding the fact that this is just a hobby.

     In our prime, it wasn't uncommon to see 10000+ messages per
     day. We've shrunk, and yet Usenet distribution has increased
     to well over 20GB/day and when including binaries, over
     60GB+/day.

     In one area, I see our network becoming more anarchistic
     each day, which contrary to the stigma of the word, is a
     good thing.  When people get truely sick of the bickering
     and groping for power, alternatives are available. The
     fidonet via internet list is primarily intended to provide
     these alternatives, and one I have found to work well for
     many. The war isn't over mind you, as suspicions of Jim
     Balcom's known Z1B bias becomes more visible.  What neither
     Jim, the NAB, nor the Z1B appear to realize is that none of
     them individually are all that important.  The ONLY
     important thing about echomail is that it gets distributed
     efficiently, and with few incidents.  The personalities
     behind the tossers don't mean squat to downlink systems,
     except when they find a message from one of the
     personalities.

     FidoNews is supposed to be a newsletter of the whole Fido, but it
     looks like it's only American. So... Here's a short article on
     current evevts in 2:463.

     Comod Disconnects Mod For Unwarranted Moderation.

     Ruslan Kondratskiy, the comoderator of KIEV.TALKS, got his power
     together with another comod Al Yatsenko, and the moderator Juliy
     Chirkov  on June'99 election. In some months, Juliy Chirkov had to
     quit Fido and appointed Al Yatsenko a temporary moderator. Ruslan
     agreed with the fact of the appointment, but doubted Al's full
     power. Still the echo lived its life, Ruslan put moderatorials, Al
     just supervised a bit. But a lot of people started complaining on
     FIDONEWS 16-48               Page 3                   29 Nov 1999


     Ruslan's activity to NE463C, because Comod started punishing for
     "numerous crossposts" or "non-permitted forward". NE463C promised to
     start new elections. Meanwhile, Al, the officially appointed
     "temporary moderator", published a moderatorial letter, proclaiming
     amnesty for all, punished by Ruslan. Then the Comod... put
     moderatorial [!] (disconnection) to Al for "unwarranted moderation".
     The Mod answered by putting [!] to Ruslan. Echo couldn't stop
     laughing. The conflict was solved by Vadim Serkov, the NE463C, who
     took KIEV.TALKS under his personal control till the elections.

                  God's Work

     In the beginning there was Aristotle,
     And objects at rest tended to remain at rest,
     And objects in motion tended to come to rest,
     And God saw that is was boring.
     Then God created Newton,
     And objects at rest tended to remain at rest,
     And objects in motion tended to remain in motion,
     And energy was conserved, and momentum was conserved,
          and matter was conserved,
     And God saw that is was conservative.

     Then God created Einstein,
     And everything was relative,
     And fast things became short,
     And straight things became curved,
     And the universe was filled with inertial frames,
     And God saw that it was relatively general,

          but some saw it as especially relative.

     Then God created Fidonet,
     And there was the principle,
     And the principle was Policy 4.07,
     And all things were quantified,
     But some things were still relative,
     And God saw that it was confusing.

     Then God created an Election Guide,
     As an election would/should unify,
     And he would have peace in theory,
     And all would be as one, rosy and merry.
     But it was the seventh day and God rested!

     Meanwhile the old Elflords did their work,
     Screaming Pee Four forever more,

          We will reign no matter the pain,
          The nominations , the seconds, the acceptances...
          Don't really mean a damn thing,
          not until Old policy 4.07 is finally slain!!!

                        Fidonews is American-Oriented

     This week's Echo Talk column is drawn from FIDONEWS, the echo to
     talk about this newsletter.  The author, Jodi Crisp, wasn't the
     first one to comment on the subject (as can be seen from the quotes
     she included), but her message drew the most response... including
     one from Andrei Besedin who's article appears in this issue.

     I have found that Fidonews does seem to be very America -oriented. I
     found it interesting to read about a bit of the political stuff, but
     after a while it did go on a bit- i mean, maybe it's interesting to
     who it is relevant to, but it would be nice to see articles from
     other countries sometimes at least.

     Though Fidonews isn't intended to be Zone 1 oriented, I've got to
     admit that this is the result.  I can think of several reasons for
     this:  Fidonews was started here at a time when the other zones
     didn't exist; not all countries speak English as a first language...
     But there's one premptive reason for the Zone 1 orientation - there
     just aren't too many contributions to the Snooze from other zones.
     Even when Henk Wolsink published from Zone 6, I was often the sole
     contributor... and I just don't have the sophistication to supply an
     international orientation.  I've never lived outside the states of
     Pennsylvania and New Jersey in the Eastern United States.

     But then, my own lack of international orientation is easily
     overcome... all it takes is input from sysops in other zones.  As a
     matter of fact, I've tried soliciting from other zones, but without
     much success.  I kinda hope Jodi takes up the invitation expressed
     in the FIDONEWS echo to write some articles herself.  I have a
     feeling her "Love and other grievous bodily harm" is a more powerful
     incentive than any *I* could offer :)

       A guy arrives at the pearly gates, waiting to be admitted. St.
       Peter is reading through the Big Book to see if the guy's name is
       written in it. After several minutes, St. Peter closes the book,
       furrows his brow, and says, "I'm sorry, I don't see your name
       written in the Book."

       "How current is your copy?" he asks.

       "I get a download every ten minutes." St. Peter replies, "Why do
       you ask?"

       "I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I was always the stubborn type.
       It was not until my death was imminent that I cried out to God,
       so my name probably hasn't arrived to your copy yet."

       "I'm glad to hear that, "Pete says, "but while we're waiting for
       the update to come through, can you tell me about a really good
       deed that you did in your life?"

       The guys thinks for a moment and says, "Hmmm, well there was this
       one time when I was driving down a road and I saw a group of
       biker gang members harassing this poor girl.  I slowed down, and
       sure enough, there they were, about 20 of them harassing this
       poor woman.  Infuriated, I got out my car, grabbed a tire iron
       out of my trunk, and walked up to the leader of the gang. He was
       a huge guy; 6-foot-4, 260 pounds, with a studded leather jacket
       and a chain running from his nose to his ears.  As I walked up to
       the leader, the bikers formed a circle around me and told me to
       get lost or I'd be next."

       "So I ripped the leader's chain out of his face and smashed him
       over the head with the tire iron.  Then I turned around and
       yelled to the rest of them, 'Leave this poor innocent girl alone!
       You're all a bunch of SICK, deranged animals! Go home before I
       really teach you a lesson in PAIN!'"

       St. Peter, duly impressed, says "Wow!  When did this happen"

       "About three minutes ago."

     King Arthur was in Merlin's laboratory where the good wizard was
     showing him his latest invention. It was a chastity belt, except it
     FIDONEWS 16-48               Page 11                  29 Nov 1999


     had a rather large hole in the most obvious place.

     "Why this is no good, Merlin!" the king exclaimed, "Just look at
     this opening.  How is this supposed to protect m'lady, the Queen?"

     "Ah, sire, just observe," said Merlin.

     He then selected his most worn out wand, one that he was going to
     discard anyway. He inserted it in the gaping aperture of the
     chastity belt whereupon a small guillotine blade came down and cut
     it neatly in two.

     "Merlin, you are a genius!" exclaimed the grateful monarch. "Now I
     can leave, knowing that my Queen is fully protected." After putting
     Guinevere in the device, King Arthur then set out upon his Quest.

     Several years passed until he returned to Camelot. Immediately he
     assembled all of his knights in the courtyard and had them drop
     their trousers for an informal 'short arm' inspection.  Sure enough,
     each and every one of them was either amputated or damaged in some
     way. All of them, except Sir Galahad.

     "Sir Galahad," exclaimed King Arthur."My one and only true knight.
     Only  you among all the nobles have been  true to me. What is it in
     my power to grant you? Name it and it is yours!"

     But, alas, Sir Galahad was speechless.
