Editorial: (I'm about to) snooze...

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Before I get started, a quick note; I've updated the FidoNews info
and masthead junk buried at the end of the newsletter. I changed the
how-to-get info, and upgraded the copyright notice a bit.

                            * * * * *

I just got back Sunday night, FidoNews night from Denver, where I
attended the ONE BBSCON put on by BOARDWATCH MAGAZINE and e-Soft Inc
(makers of TBBS). ONE BBSCON was a combination of trade show and
conference for the BBS world, and ran from Thursday through Sunday. It
took place in a Stouffers Hotel, the kind that causes severe culture
shock and fish-out-of-water syndrome for your poor editor.

Also this same weekend a few miles away was the IBECC show, put on by
some of the people who did last year's FidoCon.  Alas, I never made it
there due to overload and scheduling on my part. Due to the vagaries
of hotel/conference scheduling and conflicts beyond anyone's control,
it was far less successful than ONE BBSCON.

The event was a whirlwind of activity, keeping all participants
excited and exhausted. The large room comprising the trade show
portion was interesting and busy; all of the Usual Suspects (and
others) were displaying their wares. Modem deals were everywhere to be
found. The show room was packed every day all day. There seemed to be
about 1000 attendees.

There were many dozens of conferences or seminars, arranged into
paralell "tracks". In my usual response to sensory overload, I
withdrew and took part in very little of it; I believe I attended
three (3) conferences. Most of my time was spent talking to
participants and conference-goers, which as far as I'm concerned was
more interesting and more important.

I would like to say more, but it's 11PM, and I am more than exhausted;
I can barely stay awake. I got off the plane mere hours ago. This will
have to do for now. Hopefully people who attended will write about
their experiences, and send them in to FidoNews.

My thanks to Jack Rickard of BOARDWATCH for getting me to the BBSCON,
and to everyone who took part.

Subj: Possible idea for Fidonet sysops

* Extending the local calling area of a BBS

I saw this message in the UseNet comp.dcom.telecom conference, and
thought the idea about using call-forwarding to extend the access to
a BBS might be something that some Fidonet sysops could put to good
use.  If you agree, please feel free to publish this in Fidonews:

It is mostly distance based.  Each prefix has a set of prefixes which
are local from it (out here, one prefix away is local, further away is
toll).

There is a BBS in Long Beach which gives free memberships to anyone
donating a phone number.  People who have a second line used for
dialing out give the phone number to the BBS by setting up call
forwarding on the out-dial line to a number as specified by the BBS.
They can then continue to use the line for out-dialing.  By chaining
these numbers together, the BBS gets numbers in a variety of prefixes,
thus offering local calling to a wide area.

The number I use to call this BBS forwards three times, each hop is
local, but the end-to-end call would be a high (intra-LATA) toll for
me.  It does take several seconds to set up the call, though.

Opinions are personal; facts are suspect; I speak only for myself

[Note from Jack:  You want to be sure that the lines used for the
call-forwarding have unmeasured service, otherwise the owner of the
line will get charged for each forwarded call!  Since some telephone
companies (particularly some in countries outside the U.S., but also
some in the U.S.) don't offer any flat-rate service, this method
would not be cost-effective in some areas.]

SHAREWARE BLUES
by Surya Lovejoy, 2:440/74.1

With a few honourable exceptions, shareware seems to be a concept
which promises rather more than it delivers - to authors and users
alike.  Authors because only a small percentage of users pay the
registration fee, users because said authors cannot or will not offer
the degree of support expected by those who *do* pay the fee.

A case in point. As one of a mere handful of Mac-based Fidonet users
in the UK, I was delighted to come across MacWoof, a Point package for
the Mac. Despite a few quirks, it's a very nice package. I immediately
sent off my registration fee. Currency commissions and charges,
together with a poor exchange rate, made the true cost nearly double
the nominal fee, but I still considered it a fair price.

Time went by, and my registered copy never arrived. This caused me no
hardship, since the evaluation copy is fully-functional, and contains
no time limit on use. I shrugged it off as a little disappointing, in
that I had paid my money and hadn't received the promised goods, but
of no real consequence.

I then discovered a problem with the package. It claims to support 4D
addressing, but doesn't in fact: if requires the use of a Fakenet to
send Netmail, and even then sends messages with the wrong return
address; it lists the fakenet instead of the proper Fidonet address.
Which means that people replying to your netmails end up sending them
into oblivion somewhere in the dusty corners of your boss.

I've been fortunate in that I have a sysop with an implacable nature
and a seemingly bottomless reserve of patience. He rounds up my
replies before they are consigned to the bit bucket, edits the address
and forwards them to me. But it's frustrating. It shouldn't be
necessary.

FidoNews 9-33                  Page 5                      17 Aug 1992


We've both written endless netmails to the author of MacWoof, my sysop
crashing them direct to his BBS to be sure of delivery, and polling
his system daily for a reply. All transatlantic calls, and all to no
avail.

I don't want to turn this into an attack on a particular author; it is
possible that there is some explanation for his apparent disinterest.
But it does point to the fragile nature of the shareware contract. I
paid my registration fee partly as a matter of principle - a desire to
play fair and to honour the trust shareware authors have for the great
computer-using public - and partly from the selfish motive that doing
so would entitle me to at least a minimum level of product support.
The lack of such support has left me feeling cheated. Worse, it has
provided me with a potential justification not to register future
packages: I kept my part of the bargain, and got nothing in return.
This is, of course, nonsense. I've got a software package I like and
use on a daily basis. But it leaves me with a sour taste, in much the
same way as shareware authors must feel when they come across users
who have no intention of paying the registration fee.

The irony is that, had I not been promised support in the
documentation, I would have been perfectly happy to pay the
registration fee and receive nothing more than the author's blessing
to continue using the package. But the fact remains that I *was*
promised more, and didn't get it.

Perhaps the time has come for a more realistic look at the nature of
the shareware 'contract.' For authors to invite people to use the
package with or without payment (they will anyway, and 'time-bombs'
merely provide a challenge along the way), simply adding that a
donation would be welcomed if users would like to express their
appreciation for the author's work.  And for users to expect nothing
in return but the satisfaction of knowing that they are rewarding the
author for a job well done. As James Russel Lowell once observed,
"there is no good arguing with the inevitable; the only argument
available with an east wind is to put on your overcoat."

SUBJ: Problem with Numbers in NET 124

Allow me to preface this by stating I am the NC of NET 124.  I feel
that the article posted by Mr. Butler needed to be rebutted due to
it's inaccuracies.

In FIDO932.NWS, Rob Butler stated a belief of discriminatory pratices
in NET 124 based upon age.  He based this upon the fact that when HE
joined into NET 124, after sending messages to 1:124/1 (whoever that
might be, but it sure isn't the correct place according to POLICY4),
he had a difficult time getting a number isssued.  If the address that
he gave was correct, then it is no wonder, as it was NOT where he
needed to send it.

FidoNews 9-33                  Page 6                      17 Aug 1992


As for his POINT who sent in a request, he fails to mention the fact
that the point used NODELIST.361 of 1991 to send in his request. That
in and of itself isn't "so" bad, but he didn't even send it to the
correct location using this nodelist.  Finally the point got his
request to the correct destination, my board.  At this time, I already
had several request pending.  As a quality control measure, with each
request that I receive I make sure that the requesting system meets
the minimum standards as outlined in POLICY4, namely having a mailer
online during ZMH.  I allow two days to make a connect with a netmail
message advising them that their application has been received and
upon receipt of said netmail that their application will be processed
to a HUB for issuance of a node number.  I've been running anywhere
from 10-15 requests a week for the past several weeks, and it doesn't
take a rocket scientist to figure up that 13 requests * 2 days = 26
days.

During the time I had Mr. Butler's POINT set up for delivery, I could
not get a connect with him, therefore the request was not processed at
that time.  Later I WAS able to make a connect and in the first week
of August Sean's application was passed on to a HUB for issuance of a
node number since in NET 124 each individual HUB is responsible for
upkeep of their nodelist segment.

NET 124 currently has approximately 160 nodes in it, and comprises the
Dallas metroplex, which takes in a LARGE area.  With school out, there
are a proportionately larger number of BBS's going online, with the
associated increase in requests for node numbers, something that Mr.
Butler is apparently not aware of to have been involved in a network
for so long.

As for the below quote:

"the last few weeks (four to be exact) I've heard him complain about"
"124/1 and the inability to get his node number assigned.  This person"
"is also a teenager (16 to be exact.)  So far, he has sent four"
"requests for a node number."

Mr. Butler fails to state that at least one, if not TWO of the
requests never reached the correct location.  The first request went
to the OLD NC as listed in Sean's outdated nodelist, the second
request went to the NEC of NET 124.  Seans first inquiry into his node
number status was 10 days after I finally got his request, and that
was the last contact I have had from him.

As far as Mr. Butler's allegations of age discriminations, I reviewed,
and re-reviewed the messages sent by Sean, and could not find where he
stated his age in there anywhere.  I also could detect no ESP
emanations that indicated he was 16yoa <grin>, which I guess, I should
have been able to if Mr. Butler's statements about age discrimination
are correct, since there was no other way of my knowing what the
individuals age was.

FidoNews 9-33                  Page 7                      17 Aug 1992


Personally I don't care if the individual that is requesting a node
number is 3 years old, but he/she WILL meet the minimum requirements
outlined in POLICY4 and have an operational mailer online during ZMH.
If the requestee can't do that, then they WILL NOT get a node number,
and will have to re-request it again.

It is a little unrealistic upon the part of an individual to look at
"recommended times" in a document written in 1989 and expect them to
apply 3 years later, looking at the past and current growth of the
nodelist.

In ending, I can state without any qualms, that age has NOTHING to do
with whether you are issued a node number or not in NET 124, but
technical competence does.

              LE_CLUB - The FidoNet Veterans Club
              -----------------------------------

     Le_Club is a social echomail conference that aims to bring
together FidoNet oldtimers. The echo is not restricted in any way,
except that it is only open to FidoNet sysops, and not to BBS
users. Still, it is recommended for those that have been in the
network for at least two years, although the more novice sysops are
welcome to come, see, and participate.

     Le_Club is a species of electronic FidoNet "con." It is the
place to talk about how each of us got started in the network, to
remember how things were back then and, why not, to talk about the
future each of us envisions for our dear FidoNet. It is also the
place to socialize with other "names" we have seen for long but
with whom we were never in touch, and of course, to simply talk
about the weather, share happy experiences as well as tales of dupe
loops, bombing runs and why not, thunderstorms messing around with
the phone equipment. :)

     There is absolutely no room in Le_Club for politics or flames.
Many of us have had differences with others -ranging from small
discussions to full-fledged flame wars- throughout the years, but
we MUST leave them out of the echo. In addition to this, Le Club is
not a technical echo, there is the conference NET_DEV that is more
appropriate for technical matters.

     There will be no moderator in Le_Club, other than the persons
in charge of periodically posting the echo's guidelines and
participation statistics, also known as the hosts or "Logkeepers."
By getting linked to Le_Club, you are committing yourself to being
friendly towards everybody, and to refrain from starting hapless
episodes. We believe it is still possible.

Two new (and unrelated) echos: PCMAIL and POEMS
By Bill Smith, Sysop Esprit Descalier, 236/28

There are two new echos available from 1:236/28: PCMAIL and POEMS.

POEMS is an echo for the electronic publishing of poetry.  It is
primarily for those who like to write or read poetry.  All articles
should be copyright by the author or have explicit permission from
the copyright holder for distribution.  All topics of poetry are
welcome although sexually explicit poetry is discouraged.

Critiques, commentary and other articles that are not poems are
considered off-topic but if there is a demand, a companion echo
could be created for such things.   The moderator is
'Bill Smith At 236/28'.  Contact him via Netmail if you wish to
establish a feed.

PCMAIL is an echo devoted to the discussion of confidential (Private)
Computer MAIL.  Topics include the technology needed to guarantee
that messages are read only by sender and recipient (and no sysops)
and the issue of preventing such confidential mail from being used
for illegal purposes.  Other topics include the development of
SequreNet, a secure Fidonet Technology Network Zone, the use of
non-traditional media for transmitting messages such as surface
mail, and applications of this technology to commercial
applications.

PCMAIL is available to both BBS users and Sysops and may be
requested from Bill Smith At 236/28 via Netmail.

POEMS and PCMAIL may not be gatewayed to other FTN zones or other
networks except those of the standard Fidonet zones.

Rush-Fan Echo

The Rush Fan echo is looking for a few more participants to get things
flowing again.  This echo concentrates solely on the rock-band RUSH--
its music, philosophy and popularity in the online world.  The echo
is currently being seen by approximately twenty BBS's in Fidonet and
we hope you would consider joining in on the action.

FidoNews 9-33                  Page 9                      17 Aug 1992


All I ask is that you poll my system once every week or two to pick
up the mail packets in the echo on hold for you.  To get started and
to join others in the online community interested in RUSH, contact
me netmail at 1:141/885 or 1:141/1885 or on my system, Cygnus X-I,
located in Southington, CT (203-628-9702 or 203-620-0757).
