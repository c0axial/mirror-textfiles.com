     Greetings

     Did some 'surfing' the WWW in particular fidonet.org and some of it's
     links.  I'm supprised how many of them are out of date or just don't
     work.  Please keep us up to date with any changes. Thanks.

     This issue is in a way, a major mishap and thats an understatement.

     My Linux machine decided to say goodbye and with a few articles on
     it, which I cannot retrieve, it will have to wait until I can replace
     it.  It appears, the power supply is the faulty part.

     So, my apologies for not placing your article.

     For those celebrating Christmas, may you have peace, and happy
     holidays.  Whatever you are going to do, don't drink and drive -
     please arive alive!

     Happy reading,

     -----------------------------
     SYNOPSIS:

     FidoNews is the newsletter of the FidoNet computer network,
     for both its Sysops and users.  It is passed to its readers
     electronically via the FidoNet and other computer networks
     and to non-network readers as well as to the InterNet.

     This document intends to tell you how to write and submit
     articles for publication in FidoNews.  Much of it describes
     the technical specifications which an article must meet in
     order to be included in the newsletter, as well as broad
     (very) guidelines on content.  (Of course you realize
     articles can be submitted only electronically.)

     Please read this document carefully.

     The article you save might be your own.


     -----------------------------
     INTRODUCTION:

     FidoNews was originally founded in early 1984 to include
     all parts of the lives of its member Sysops and users,
     which of course means not just technical matters.  We do
     not have fixed goals of maximum distribution or maximum
     readership (i.e. lowest common denominator) but only to
     meet the needs of our individual network members.  The
     success of this venture has always been contentious at
     best (ahem).

     In any case the grand experiment continues.

     Over fifteen years later and roughly 20,000 Nodes in the
     FIDONEWS 15-51               Page 3                   21 Dec 1998


     network, the editorial policy, or lack of one, of FidoNews
     has shown to best fit our ever-changing and unpredictable
     needs.


     -----------------------------
     SUBJECT MATTER:

     Articles on any subject of interest to FidoNet members and
     users are welcome and encouraged, not necessarily of a
     technical nature, though priority may be, but not
     necessarily, given to articles of importance to the FidoNet,
     its technology and its uses; other networks such as uucp and
     the Internet; social aspects of communications; ethical
     issues; other related matters.


     -----------------------------
     ARTICLE LENGTH:

     Try to keep articles short.  The longer it is, the less
     likely people are to read it.  Consider splitting long
     articles (more than five pages) into smaller articles to
     be run serially.

     Exceptions will be made at the whim of the editors.

     For practical reasons, we will attempt to keep FidoNews to
     a "reasonable size", which is of course a highly subjective
     and variable thing.  As of Mar 1998, the goal is to keep
     each issue under 100,000 bytes.  Decisions regarding content
     may be made based upon this, though in general it shouldn't
     be an issue.

     As above, exceptions will be made at the whim of the
     editors.


     -----------------------------
     WRITING GUIDELINES:

     We are not all professional writers, nor is that even a
     goal for the FidoNews -- we want real communication to and
     from real people; even at the expense of so-called "good
     writing", which is frequently a tool to exclude.

     There are, however, a few minimum requirements for any
     successful writing, even for the lowly FidoNews:

     * The subject discussed must be clear to people other
       than the author!  Don't assume that people will pick
       up the context from your writing.  Tell them
       _explicitly_.

     * Why are you writing this?  It may _seem_ obvious --
       "Review of the new Acme 75-baud Modem" -- but it's
     FIDONEWS 15-51               Page 4                   21 Dec 1998


       not.  Are you the manufacturer? An irate customer?
       Let us know your point of view.

     * Who *are* you?  A good question!  Anonymity is
       acceptable, though most people want to take credit
       for their work.  Include full contact information
       including NetMail and E-Mail addresses, where such
       is feasible.

     * Articles submitted via Netmail or E-Mail must
       contain all the technically required lines and
       delimiters in the BODY of the message.  This
       includes the *[title] line and the 70 character
       width requirement.  To indicate the filename type for
       one of these message submissions, place the
       FILENAME.TYP in the SUBJ: line of your E-Mail,
       NetMail, or EchoMail.  Those that require extra
       editing may be delayed from appearing in FidoNews.

     * Articles will appear when space becomes available,
       not necessarily the "next" issue.  If your article
       is of a time-critical nature, please say so when you
       submit it; the editor still has final say.

     * The editor reserves the right to request changes
       from an author to meet these "standards", which you
       have to admit are pretty loose. It is not the intent
       for this to be a mechanism to refuse articles the
       editor does not like, but simply to keep the
       contents intelligible.

     * If we have a backlog of articles, we may get fussier
       about things.  Historically, this has not been a
       serious problem.


     -----------------------------
     SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

     TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

     If all that hasn't scared you away, the next step is to
     create a text file which contains the text of your article.
     The resulting file should be sent or uploaded to "Editor",
     | FidoNet address 5:5/23, or to "editor@fidonews.org".

     The "physical" location (and phone number) of FidoNews
     varies, and hence must be found elsewhere, such as
     within a recent copy of FidoNews itself.

     Filenames must follow the MSDOS standard:

         FILENAME.TYP

         a 1 to 8 character file name (A - Z, 0 - 9)
         a period,
     FIDONEWS 15-51               Page 5                   21 Dec 1998


         a 0 to 3 character file type (A - Z, 0 - 9)


     File types are used to distinguish types of submissions, as
     follows:

         .LET Letters to the Editor.
         .ART An article, commentary, open letter, or
              general news item.
         .GUE Want to write a Guest Editorial?
              Place [*Name & Node on line 1]
         .RTX Need to make a Retraction of a previous
              article or notice?
         .COL Want to become a regular contributor
              with your own column?
         .ANS Answers to the Question of the Week.
         .BIO FidoNet biographies - tell us your
              personal story.
         .TRU True stories of FidoNet.
         .HIS FidoNet history - got an anecdote
              to share?
         .REV Reviews of related product, services,
              or programs.
         .JOK Net humor in print.
         .FIC FidoNet (computer related) short fiction.
         .CMX Comics in ASCII.
              [watch those lines at 70 columns!]
              [.CMX that are political will be
               renamed to .GUE]
         .PRF Want to Proofread? Get a cookie for
              spotting errors.
         .AD  Advertising FREE services or events.
         .SAL "For Sale"
         .WAN "Wanted"
         .NOT A notice for the back of the issue.
              Keep them short.
         .INT Internet addresses for FidoNet-related
              Web Pages of general interest.

     If your file doesn't have one of the above extensions, then
     it will lay around taking up disk space until someone takes
     a look at it and realizes what it is.

     Maybe.

     The name of the file is up to you, though you should use a
     name which is not likely to be "stepped on" by someone
     else -- the system will not guarantee file names are unique.
     For example, FNEWS.ART is probably not a good name for an
     article.


     -----------------------------
     CHARACTER SETS:

     The character by character contents of the file itself must
     FIDONEWS 15-51               Page 6                   21 Dec 1998


     meet the following standards or it cannot be published in
     FidoNews.

     The FidoNews staff WILL NOT be responsible for making file
     contents conform to these standards.

     * FLUSH LEFT MARGIN:  Please do not put a "left margin"
       on your articles.  Have the text start at the very
       first column.

     * RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 70 OR LESS:  Less is tolerable,
       more is definitely not.  If your cursor is resting at
       column 71 when your line is ended, you're okay.  But,
       *one* character past that, even with trailing spaces
       and MAKENEWS will barf on your submission.

       If your submission is physically rejected, the Editor
       will have to fix it manually or send it back for
       reformatting.

     * RAGGED-RIGHT TEXT:  Word-Star style "justification"
       (inserting spaces into sentences so that a paragraph
       is perfectly rectangular) is extremely hard to read,
       and consumes needless space.  Please don't use it!

     * NO FUNNY CHARACTERS:  This includes formfeeds, returns
       without linefeeds, linefeeds without returns, tabs and
       other oddities.

       The only control codes (character codes 0 through 31
       decimal) allowed are carriage return (CR) and
       linefeed (LF).  The only exception is:  Control-Z
       "end of file" terminator characters are tolerated.
       Not required.

     * NO GRAPHICS CHARACTERS:  Believe it or not, not
       everyone in the world has an IBM PC.  Please restrict
       yourself to printable ASCII characters in the range
       20 hex to 7E hex (space to tilde).

     * LINES TERMINATED:  Each line in the article should
       be terminated with a 'newline' -- either the MSDOS
       standard (CR/LF) or the unix standard (LF only).


     -----------------------------
     SUBMISSION FORMAT:

     Below is a sample article properly formatted.  Features of
     it are discussed further below.

     --article file example begins below this line--
     *A Sample Article [this is in LINE 1 starting at COLUMN 1]

     This is My Title
     by Joe Schmoe, [Netmail/email address]
     FIDONEWS 15-51               Page 7                   21 Dec 1998


     And here is my article. Note that it is flush left (zero indent).
     Also note that the right margin is at column seventy so that it
     won't overflow "most" text windows. Each line has a newline. Note
     the *'ed first line. My article will be listed in the table of
     contents exactly as it appears after the * above.

     Figure 1.                       Table 1.
             +-------+               ========
             | A Box |                 Alpha
             +-------+                 Bravo

     Note that we am not using any funny-o characters. This ensures
     that the final article will look the same to every user, no
     matter what sort of hardware he has.

     This is the last sentence of our article.

     --article file example ends above this line--


     The FIRST line of text is the Table of Contents line.  It MUST
     begin with an asterisk * as shown above.  NO BLANK lines above
     title line are permitted.  If you do not follow this instruction
     exactly, the article will not be listed in the Table of Contents.
     This Table of Contents listing method works for all submission
     file types.

     * Everything that follows the *'ed line will appear in
       the body of the newsletter.  The *'ed line will be
       stripped out of your article text so if you want it
       repeated as your title in the article BE SURE to REPEAT
       it on a second line without the *.

     * Next should be the title or name of your article,
       your name, and contact information (network
       address(es), Postal Service address, etc).  Try to
       keep it to one or two lines each.

     * Put a blank line between paragraphs.  Paragraphs that
       all run together are very difficult to read, and may
       be rejected.

     * If you want to put in a table or a figure, go right
       ahead.  We do not rearrange text if you follow these
       submission guidelines, so your table or figure should
       remain exactly as you entered it. Try to limit them
       to ones that make the communication CLEARER.

     * Don't put a lot of blank space at the top or bottom.
       The FidoNews-generator programs will visually
       separate articles automatically.

     * Please check for basic errors in spelling, grammar,
       and punctuation. We're not publishing a textbook, but
       you don't want it to embarrass yourself do you?

     FIDONEWS 15-51               Page 8                   21 Dec 1998


     * Don't use FidoNews to grind your personal axes
       against other FidoNet members.  An article presenting
       a side of an internal dispute is one thing.  An
       article defaming or perseverating over several
       Issues is another.  Articles that merely quote
       endlessly from other sources to no particular effect
       are also not a good idea.

     * Don't republish copyrighted material from other
       sources WITHOUT the permission of those sources.
       Include the permission in such articles.

     * Remember that FidoNews is no better or worse than
       the articles submitted to it. If you want FidoNews
       to be a useful newsletter, get involved and submit
       useful articles. It's up to YOU to make it work.


     -----------------------------
     SUBMISSION DEADLINES:

     FidoNews is published on Monday of every week.

     | To assure the best possible chance of being published in
     | this week's issue, the deadline for file submission to
     | the FidoNews Editor via FILE-ATTACH is at 0800 UTC/GMT
     | on the previous Saturday.

     | The deadline for submissions via NetMail, E-Mail, or in
     | the FIDONEWS Echo is 1800 UTC/GMT the previous
     | Friday.

     Submissions which miss the deadlines will be processed the
     following week.  Submission by deadline is not a guarantee
     of appearance in that week's FidoNews but it is likely
     depending on volume of submissions.

     As well, submissions may be missed due to changes in the
     personal schedule of the FidoNews Editor, but should be
     published in the following issue.
