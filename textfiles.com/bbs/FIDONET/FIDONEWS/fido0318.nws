     We get some odd customers in the shareware business.

     I don't mean the private individuals who make donations.  They're
     a blessing.  There's nothing  quite  like  being  appreciated.  I
     remember one letter; the guy went on for pages about how he liked
     our  product,  apologizing  profusely  that  he couldn't send any
     more.

     Some of the companies are a bit off-the-wall,  though.  Not  all,
     by  any  means.  Most  companies are pretty good about it.  Well,
     the ones who pay at all are generally pretty  good.  I  gather  a
     lot of companies simply don't understand shareware yet, but we're
     getting there.

     But there's that small percentage that kind of makes you wonder.

     I  got  a call just the other day from one of them.  It seems his
     company was one subsidiary of a large conglomerate, and he wanted
     to use our program in his project.  His problem was that each  of
     the subsidiaries is organized as a separate company in a separate
     location.  For example, he worked for one outfit in New York, but
     there's  another  outfit  in California that has a different name
     and is organized as a different company,  but both are  owned  by
     the same conglomerate.  Are you with me so far?

     Now,  he had heard of our "unlimited site license", and he wanted
     to know if we would consider the two companies (along with  about
     another twenty all over the world) to be one "site".

     The  American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines
     a site as "The place or plot of land where something was, is,  or
     is  to be located." I would tend to feel that it's pushing things
     a bit to consider the entire inhabited surface of  the  Earth  as
     ONE plot of land.

     I'm sure he felt he was trying to do the right thing.  After all,
     he  could  have just used it,  and to Hell with us.  We're hardly
     going to go out and sue twenty companies around the world  for  a
     few  hundred  bucks  apiece.  No,  he  saw  his  legal  and moral
     obligations,  and wanted to do what was  right.  He  just  didn't
     want  to  spend  any money on it.  I tried to explain to him that
     spreading any "normal" commercial package that widely would  cost
     far more.  His attitude was "Well, yes, but..."

     What can I say?  People like that are ASKING for copy protection.
     They  have  no one to blame but themselves if they get stuck with
     it.

     Juan E. Jimenez, Micro Consulting Associates
     DataFlex Fido / Modem Help West
     103/511 - 1/110

        +---------------------------------------------------------+
        | How to get your IBM-PC/AT running DOS 3.2 to write 720k |
        | of data onto a 360k disk using 1.2 meg disk drives...   |
        +---------------------------------------------------------+


     Sanford Zelkovitz,  Sysop of Fido 103/506 and president of  Alpha
     Computer  Service,  has  come  up with a way to squeeze 720k into
     those 360k disks which you  can  now  get  for  around  $0.69  in
     quantity. The solution is in the form of a program he has written
     called  INTRCPT.COM.  The  program  is memory resident and allows
     you to write 720k of data onto a DS/DD diskette using the 1.2 meg
     drives.

     There are some limitations to the program:

        (1) You must be using an IBM-PC/AT

        (2) You must be running IBM PC-DOS version 3.2

        (3) You must have at least one 1.2 meg drive

     The program works in conjunction with a program distributed  with
     PC-DOS   3.2  called  "DRIVER.SYS".   Complete  instructions  are
     included in the release ARChive, including full MASM source code.
     You  can  obtain  the  file  from  my   Fido   at   714-675-7106,
     300/1200/2400, 24 hrs;  or from any other Net 103 Fido in the NET
     103 area code.

     I have tested the program with Norton's NU,  DSBACKUP and  a  few
     other programs, and it works like a champ!  The only program that
     we know it will NOT work with is DISKCOPY.COM.

     Dann Porter, 148/2

                           A Question of Privacy


       As responsible SysOps, we have all,  from time to time,  had to
     delete a message or two for a variety of reasons.  How often have
     you  "killed" a message that made reference to copying or trading
     commercial  software?   Or  zapped  some   feeble-minded   user's
     profanity-riddled  effort  at discussing the current debate topic
     on your board?  All part of the job, right?

       Now think back to the last message you  performed  a  bitectomy
     on.  Was  it  a PUBLIC notice or a PRIVATE one?  Maybe you didn't
     even pay attention to that detail.  I'm sure no one would dispute
     our right to erase a PUBLIC message that falls into the  category
     of "unacceptable", but what about PRIVATE ones?

       Do  we  have the right to impose our moral or ethical standards
     on users that we are offering a service to?  A  service  that  we
     promote  as being PRIVATE.  I can't help but make a comparison to
     the  postal  service  or  voice  communications  over  the   same
     telephone  lines that BBS's utilize.  I can almost hear the Civil
     Liberties people screaming all the way up here.

       If FidoNet is going to be considered a legitimate competitor to
     the other E-Mail services that are available, we must ensure that
     a high standard of  privacy  is  maintained.  The  scope  of  our
     responsibility  should  not  include  being  a  censor of private
     communications between two citizens.  In fact,  whether  we  even
     have the right to READ messages flagged as PRIVATE is in doubt in
     my  mind.  I realize that this would be difficult to avoid in our
     day to day maintenance of Fido,  but it  is  something  to  think
     about.

       There  are  other  implications  that should be considered when
     dealing with an international network,  but I'll leave  that  for
     future  dissertations.  I  believe  this is a relevant issue that
     deserves some serious thought by all concerned.  Any comments  or
     criticisms  are  most welcome....after all,  we are talking about
     Free Speech here.

     Richard Polunsky, 106/2

                            FIDO UTILITY CATALOG


     PURPOSE:

     To assist existing and new Fido sysops  in  finding  programs  to
     make their task a little easier.

     NOTES:

     I  have  not  tested all utilities on this list;  indeed,  I have
     obtained only two-thirds of them.  I have attempted to list  both
     the  utility  name  and  the  filename  by  which  it is commonly
     distributed.  This format does not allow for multiple authors  to
     be listed, so I have shown only the first author in such cases.

     REVISIONS:

     The current list will be kept on the I.T.C. BBS, node 106/2, with
     file attach path D:\FIDO\FIDOCATU.ARC.  List updates will be done
     depending on the quantity of changes; the first update is planned
     for May 1, and new editions will be announced in FidoNews.

     ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

     Henk  Wevers  also did a utility catalog;  his appeared in a back
     issue of Fidonews, and I liked his format so much I adopted it.

     Dave Reinsel, Kurt Reisler,  and Rich Kaleta who provided me with
     my initial set of utilities and helped me get running.

     And  all those sysops and users who keep on writing utilities for
     the Fido system.

                          User Group Presentations
                                     By
                              Jim Butterfield


             Most  observers  classify  computer  users   into   three
     generation groups:  beginners, intermediates and experts.  It's a
     little  like  the  school   grading   system.   When   you   have
     successfully mastered grade 1,  you may move on to grade 2 and so
     on.

             There's some justification for this scheme.  Obviously, a
     user must learn fundamentals before proceeding  to  more  complex
     areas.  If  you don't know how to turn the machine on,  you can't
     run it.  The first stages seem quite clear.

             A number of questions arise about such a  scheme.  Should
     the  various  groups  be  segregated,  so that a beginner may not
     participate in "expert" subjects  and  vice-versa?  Should  clubs
     and  user  groups  promote  themselves  from  beginner  clubs  to
     advanced clubs as members gain experience?  And are the lines  of
     demarcation really that clear?

             I  can recall being at a TPUG meeting where presentations
     were under way.  Some presentations are exciting and interesting;
     whereas  others  are  ...   well,   not  quite  so  exciting  and
     interesting.  At the time,  a younger member was outlining how to
     scratch files.  Until just before that time,  the poor fellow had
     to buy a new disk every time he filled one up; he didn't know how
     to  remove  the  files  he  didn't  need  any more.  To him,  the
     discovery of the  fact  that  files  could  be  scratched  was  a
     marvellous  and novel thing.  And perhaps that was true for a few
     of the attendees.

             I was standing near a clever young man who had written  a
     good  number of programs.  "I won't come to any more meeting," he
     said.  "I know all this stuff and these presentations do  nothing
     for me."

             I didn't know what to reply.  Certainly, if he hoped that
     every  meeting would be on an advanced technical plane,  he would
     be doomed to disappointment.  I wondered: is this the only reason
     that members attend meetings?  To obtain  technical  advancement?
     Surely  there  must be other reasons.  What about social aspects?
     How about swapping notes  on  the  performance  of  programs  and
     peripherals?  And  surely there is pleasure in showing others how
     to do something new, even if the information flows only one way.

             It seems to me that there will be some members  who  will
     never  be  satisfied with a program.  They want to be entertained
     and educated in the same way they would expect if they went to  a
     movie,  theatre  or trade school.  The fact is that clubs are not
     Fidonews                     Page 11                   5 May 1986


     made up of professional entertainers; they use volunteer help and
     must do  the  best  they  can.  The  same  is  true  of  software
     distributed by clubs: most is not professional work but is simply
     contributed programs written by members.

             There  is  a need to police presentations (and software),
     of course.  I'm all in favor of  the  beginner's  "show-and-tell"
     presentation.  There may be information of interest to others, it
     may  entertain  and  it  will  be  good  for  the  member to gain
     presentation skills.  But there's a limit.  A member who has used
     the  sound  features  of  a  computer  to  make the sound of duck
     quacking has a good two-minute presentation to  make  which  will
     inform  and  entertain.  A  half-hour  speech on the same subject
     would be tiresome to all ... the presenter would be a dead duck.

             Magazines,  newsletters and clubs  often  make  a  simple
     mistake.  They  think  that  everyone  has  been  around from the
     beginning and remembers everything that has happened.  Some of us
     start late --magazines have new readers, clubs have new members -
     - and don't know things that may have gone  before.  Some  of  us
     forget.  The  idea  that we never need to repeat a simple concept
     but can go on to the next one in sequence can be deadly.  One  of
     the  great  killer  phrases in articles and speeches is:  "As you
     know ..."

             That's part of the fallacy of "advanced groups."  There's
     always  something  simple and apparently obvious that many of the
     group members don't know.  There's the programmer who writes nice
     graphics animations but who has  never  discovered  that  holding
     down  SHIFT  and  then pressing RETURN takes you to the next line
     without "actioning" the previous line on the screen.  There's the
     student who joins an advance machine language  course  who  knows
     how to write a binary multiplication routine but cannot clear the
     computer's screen.

             I  don't  mind  users grouping together to study advanced
     topics -- I'm all in favor of it -- but I hope that no group gets
     the idea that "dumb people can't join in."  There  are  beginners
     who  would like to listen in just to see if they can catch any of
     it,  or learn a few good buzzwords with which  to  impress  their
     friends.  Some  may want to go to ask advice;  for example,  what
     would be a good study route to catch up with  the  more  advanced
     users?

             I have this vision of an expert-level group in which most
     of the members might be scared to ask a question.  After all,  it
     might be a DUMB question and then they'd be  kicked  out  of  the
     group?

             Personally,  I find that others tell me a great deal that
     I don't know.  I gasp with astonishment when Mike Todd plugs some
     custom hardware into a 4040 disk and displays the contents  of  a
     disk  track  --  every bit mapped out for inspection.  I'm amazed
     when I get a phone call from Tulsa asking:  "How  come  typing  a
     line  number  of  350800  causes  the computer to crash?" And I'm
     impressed when random POKEing by an English  schoolboy  turns  up
     Fidonews                     Page 12                   5 May 1986


     the  fact that (on the VIC 20 and Commodore 64) POKE 22,35 causes
     programs to list without line numbers.

             I support the idea of special interest groups -- some  of
     which  have  "level"  implications.  But  any  club  should still
     provide a  forum  for  intermingling  of  users  at  all  levels.
     Beginners can ask questions.  Experts can show off the knowledge.
     People  with  missions can go after the specific information they
     need.

             When you can do it,  it'b best  to  appeal  to  a  cross-
     section  of  levels.  Even  if  you're taling about an elementary
     concept,  you can often dress it up within an  interest  program.
     Sometimes  you  can  demonstrate  the  concept in an amusing way.
     Remember -- computers are fun!  If you have a chance  to  make  a
     presentation, try to keep the idea of fun in there somewhere.

                             Notes from Abroad


     I contacted another major UK modem manufacturer  since  the  last
     newsletter  that  firm  is called Steebek Systems.  If you should
     see their adverts for their new "Quattro" modem  don't  rush  out
     and  buy  one.  I  have had one on test for a couple of weeks now
     and it's not much good.  It's billed as (Quote) V22bis, V22, V23,
     & V21 with auto speed detection and Hayes compatibility.  It  has
     the  extended  Hayes command set,  the one that Tom Jennings gave
     such a slagging off in the Hayes  2400.  The  truth  is  that  it
     won't answer at any speed other than 300 (V21) and once connected
     it  has the annoying (intolerable) habit of dropping the line for
     no readily apparent  reason.  I  think  it  doesn't  have  enough
     filtering  on the CD line which causes it to bomb out if there is
     any line noise.

     It doesn't have speed conversion either (for 1200/75 on  IBM)  so
     thats  another  problem.  I think we have two distinct classes of
     modem in the market as potential "Fido  Compatible"  modems.  The
     first  class  I  call the "hybrid" smartmodem.  The Quattro falls
     into this class.  I call it "hybrid" because it seems to me  that
     modems of this type (Case, Racal etc.) are a "pseudo-smartmodem".
     I  don't  think  that  any so called "smartmodem" should have any
     switches on the front panel.  The Quattro has  six!!!  Modems  of
     this  type  appear to be a half-hearted attempt to break into the
     smartmodem market,  they are normally very  similar  to  existing
     models  and  are  hoping to capture non-suspecting customers that
     "flexibility" means the added confusion of switches to cater  for
     the  customer  who  hasn't  yet adjusted to the "true smartmodem"
     concept.  I suggest that any so-called smartmodem that  has  such
     attributes should be shunned like the plague.  I hope someone can
     prove me wrong but I doubt it.

     The  other class is the true smartmodem,  ie:  Dataflex,  Miracle
     Technology  WS3000.   The  manufacturers  of  these  modems   are
     relatively  new  to  the  modem  scene and don't have to cater to
     existing customers requirements.  This type of modem is  the  one
     to  go  for.  They  are  also  the  ones  set to take over in the
     relatively new PC marketplace in Europe.  Already this modem  has
     established itself as the only modem to go for in the USA;  as is
     the practice in Europe;  we are in the same position as  the  USA
     was about three years ago.

     The  "hybrid"  modem  will  probably continue to be bought by the
     ignorant and uninformed but the street wise modem buyer  will  go
     for the latter type every time.

     Chico is one of those small cities that is 100+  miles away from
     the more cosmopolitan  computer user areas. One of the drawbacks
     of this is that we don't  have anywhere near  the access  to new
     Public Domain programs as a lot of you probably do.

     We're looking for Fidos that have rich  Atari, Apple, and  Tandy
     CoCo resources  we can tap into  somehow.  If  you feel that the
     Fido you are using serves these areas well,   will you please do
     us a great  favor  and  send a  list of  files available on your
     board  and how we can get in touch with you to arrange access to

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 300+  "ARC"  archives  -  10  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 17 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:

             IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
             Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
             DSBackup
             Fastback
             Plain  ol' files (add $50,  though,  it's a lot  of
             work and takes more diskettes...)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

                       SEAdog Electronic Mail System
                      Special Offer for FidoNet Sysops


     System Enhancement Associates, the makers of the popular ARC file
     archive utility,  are proud to announce the release of the SEAdog
     electronic mail system.

     SEAdog  is  a  PC-based  electronic  mail  system  which is fully
     FidoNet compatible.  In addition  to  all  the  functionality  of
     FidoNet mail, SEAdog adds the following:

     o   User directory support, for automatic lookup of node numbers

     o   Return receipts

     o   Audit trails

     o   Message forwarding, with or without a retained copy

     o   Twenty four hour mail reception

     o   High priority mail for immediate delivery

     o   The ability to request files and updates of files from  other
         SEAdog systems.

     o   No route files needed!

     o   A full screen user interface that our beta test sites fell in
         love with!

     SEAdog  is  NOT a bulletin board system,  but it can be used as a
     "front end" for Fido (version 11q or later),  allowing you to add
     the full functionality of SEAdog to your existing system.

     SEAdog normally sells for $100/node, but for a limited time only
     we are offering SEAdog to registered FidoNet sysops for only $50!
     Orders may be placed by sending a check or money order to:

                       System Enhancement Associates
                       21 New Street, Wayne NJ 07470

     Or by calling (201) 473-5153 (VISA and MasterCard accepted).

                            Sysop: Franz Hirner

     BAVUG I is as Fido BBS dedicated  to  the  Victor  9000  Computer
     located  in  Oakland,   California.   BAVUG  has  several  Victor
     specific programs available for download as well as material  for
     other MS-DOS systems.  Also,  we are building a reference section
     on the Victor 9000 that will be valuable to all Victor users  and
     programmers.

     Allen  Morris  is presently working on a shareware Disk Processor

     (defragmenter) for the Victor.  The first BETA VERSION is running
     (well almost). The IBM version is available now.

     Next we would like to develop a program similar to  MULTIJOB  for
     the  Victor.  Any  tips  or  source  for such a program for other
     machines would be appreciated.

     Come on by,  but please after 6:00PM  Pacific  Time  if  you  are
     calling on weekdays.
