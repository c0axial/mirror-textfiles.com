                            The Problems of Scale

        We have a problem here.  Fidonet is just a bit too large  to 
        handle easily.  

        Oh,  not  for  day-to-day mail.  We're well enough organized 
        now that I think we could handle ten times as many nodes for 
        most purposes.  After all,  a "busy"  node  doesn't  usually 
        send mail to more than a dozen other nodes a night,  while a 
        "typical" node more likely sends one or two messages a week.  
        We're in a fair-sized net with a decent amount  of  traffic, 
        and  so  far our inbound and outbound hosts haven't had much 
        trouble keeping up.  

        The problem comes when you want to get something to everyone 
        on the whole system.  Yes,  I know such "bombing  runs"  are 
        frowned  on,  but there are one or two legitimate cases.  In 
        fact, exactly two: the node list and the newsletter.  

        In both cases, it's desirable to get a largish file (3-5 min 
        transfer time at 1200 baud) out to every single node in  one

        night, and it just hasn't been working very well.  

        It wouldn't be hard to do, with the proper organization.  In 
        fact,  the  structure  to do it is already in place.  All we 
        have to do is define  a  couple  of  additional  duties  for 
        regional coordinators and network hosts.  

        Right  now,  we're  trying  to  distribute the newsletter by 
        mailing it to each inbound host.  That  worked  more-or-less 
        okay  for  about  two  weeks.  The problem is that new hosts 
        keep popping up.  We're now up around forty hosts,  which is 
        about  the  limit  that  can  be  reached  by  two  machines 
        operating send-only and working flat out  for  an  hour,  IF 
        almost everyone answers on the first call!  

        However,  there  are  only  ten  regional coordinators,  and 
        nobody expects to add any more.  

        So my idea  is  this:  Every  Monday  morning  all  regional 
        coordinators run a special mail event for a half hour before 
        the  national  mail  event,  during  which  we  mail 'em the 
        newsletter.  Then,  using Robot  or  some  other  convenient 
        means, each coordinator mails it to each inbound host in his 
        region  during  the  national mail hour.  After that,  hosts 
        pass it along using their normal channels for  getting  mail 
        to the locals.  

        The node list would work the same way,  of course, except on 
        Friday morning instead of Monday morning.  

        If we do it this way, then with a high degree of reliability 
        everyone should always get the latest copy of the node  list 
        and the newsletter on the day it is published,  and we can't 
        do much better than that!

                                  NEWS
        ============================================================
        From Robert Lederman
             Met-Chem BBS 16/42


                          PROGRAMMING QUERY
                          ===========-=====

        Thanks to everyone for the enthusiastic response I received
        to SHUFFLE and READQUES, the Fido sysop utilities I
        described in Fido234.nws.

        I am working on an enhanced version of SHUFFLE.  Most
        notably, it will support full-screen viewing of file areas
        and relocation of FILES.BBS entries to a specified spot in
        the target file areas.

        Since this new version will require partial-screen
        scrolling, I need to use IBM ROM BIOS functions for local
        operation, or ANSI functions for remote operation, chosen
        by command line switch.    In the process I have learned
        that different communications packages interpret "VT100"
        emulation differently.

        If you want your communications package supported in the
        next version of SHUFFLE, please let me know what codes it
        needs to be sent to:

            a) define top and bottom lines of the screen 
               to be scrolled.   (Most packages recognize
               "ESC [ Top ; Bottom r").
            b) scroll the region upwards.
            c) scroll the region downwards.

        In addition, I would like to recompile both SHUFFLE and
        READQUES for operation on non-IBM MS-DOS machines.  I am
        soliciting $10-$20 contributions to buy a generic MS-DOS
        Pascal compiler.  In return you will be FidoMailed or US
        Mailed the latest versions of both utilities.  Please send
        notes and contributions to:

                 Robert Lederman
                 7001 Yale Station
                 New Haven, CT 06520

        Finally, if you can accurately describe the system calls
        required to scroll a defined part of your non-IBM display, I
        will try to accomodate you as well.

        For comments and to get the latest versions of SHUFFLE (1.4
        on the way) and READQUES (1.1e), call Met-Chem BBS, FidoNet
        16/42, 203/281-7287, 1200/2400 baud, 24 hours.

        Thanks,
        Robert

        Submitted by Mike Johnson FIDO SYSOP 19/329, 19/0
        originally captured from IBM VIDEOTEXT in Boca Raton.
        Commentary is by Wilson Jones a user of my bbs.



        IBM Videotext released the following information to The 
        Product Centers: 



                      ** DOS BACKUP COMMAND CAUTION **


        The DOS BACKUP command may not always work properly.  For 
        critical back-ups, use the COPY command to copy your key 
        files onto diskettes.  Remember that a file COPY'd to a 
        diskette must fit on one diskette.  

        The BACKUP command seems to malfunction if a BUFFERS= or 
        FILES= command has been given or is present in a CONFIG.SYS 
        file.  Several program packages (such as dBASEIII) require 
        that additional buffers and files be specified.  The effect 
        of the problem is to make your backup diskette unusable.  If 
        you use BACKUP, be sure to attempt a RESTORE on another 
        machine while your data is still available.  



        A hint, if you are going to use BACKUP; Restart your system 
        with an original DOS diskette in your "A" drive immediately 
        before doing BACKUP.  This will reload DOS with the default 
        values for BUFFERS and FILES.  




        Commentary: 
        There have been problems with the IBM DOS BACKUP command for 
        as long as there has been a BACKUP command.  IBM has made 
        fixes and replacements available for the BACKUP command in 
        all versions of DOS except 3.1, yet the problems persist.  
        This presents us with a serious catch-22; we cannot 
        effectively use the computers without creating large files 
        but we have no inherent way in DOS to safely back them up.  
        Our alternatives are to purchase specialized backup software 
        or hardware that operates outside of or around DOS, or 
        continue to backup with the IBM DOS BACKUP command and pray 
        that it works.  

        The desired solution is for IBM/Microsoft to fix this 
        problem and fix it now.  How long do you think it would take 
        IBM to fix a problem like this on a System/36, System/38, 
        4300, 303X or 308X computer system?  About 24 hours, 
        maybe...

        There seems to be a prevailing attitude by manufacturers, 
        dealers and servicers in the PC marketplace that if you have 
        a PC, you must be doing nothing but playing games, and if 
        the operating system doesn't work as advertised, well, so 
        what, you're on the leading edge of technology, how can you 
        expect anything to work?  This attitude will only persist as 
        long as we, the users, allow it to persist.  

        If you agree with this, do something about it; write a 
        letter to the following people: 


            John Opel, Chairman,
            IBM Corporation,
            Armonk, New York.


            Bill Gates, Chairman,
            Microsoft Corporation,
            Bellvue, Washington.

                       A List of Ripped-Off "Freeware"
                          by Tom Neff [76656,2536]

                           Updated Oct 17th, 1985

        These are illegally copied programs being distributed as 
        "public domain" on various IBM PC bulletin boards across the 
        country.  Most of them are commercial pirate jobs, although 
        a few of them are legitimate freeware or user supported 
        programs that have been hacked up by people with 
        warped minds.  The category of each one is listed.

        Remember, Sysops: if it looks like a superb game or disk 
        utility, and it doesn't have the author's name and address 
        on it, together with explicit permission to distribute the 
        program, it is probably NOT really public domain!  If we 
        don't want to see the BBS community smothered under 
        hysterical regulations, we've got to work together to fight 
        that trend.  A great way to start is by keeping an eye on 
        our download libraries, and giving these files "the BOOT!" 

                                 CATEGORIES:

                PIRATED  - Either removed from a commercially 
                           published package (and converted to a DOS 
                           .COM file if necessary), or else a beta 
                           test copy of a commercial program under 
                           development, sneaked into distribution by 
                           a disgruntled employee or dishonest beta 
                           tester.  Sometimes the program in 
                           question never made it to market, 
                           possibly because of the pre-pirating!  

                HACKED   - An unlawfully modified copy of a 
                           legitimate freeware or user supported 
                           program. Some pirated programs have also 
                           been hacked.  It is illegal to distribute 
                           a modified copy of someone else's work 
                           without their permission.  If the author 
                           has obtained that permission, it should 
                           be mentioned in the program display or 
                           documentation.  

                *TROJAN* - BEWARE!! These programs are launched into 
                           the BBS file network by people with the 
                           LSD-in-the-reservoir mentality, and cause 
                           some form of damage to your system if 
                           you're unwary enough to run them.  It is 
                           IMPERATIVE that you let me know about any 
                           new examples of these that you find.

                         Falling Back - Batch Style

        This is in response to the articles in the last few FidoNews 
        issues regarding the change from Daylight Savings Time.  I 
        agree with David Kaplan when he says that the individual 
        boards need to stick with the time being used in their area.  
        I rely heavily on the system clock and it's nice to have it 
        accurate.  However, this can be handled even for those who 
        can't get to their machines on the weekend without having to 
        resort to changing the clocks on Friday.

        at our call;  let's use them.  What follows is an outline of 
        what I intend to set up to handle the time change.  I don't 
        know if I'm going to be near my machine that weekend or not, 
        but even if I am here I'll probably forget to change the 
        clock.  After all, I forget every six months, this time will 
        be no different.  

        What is needed is 1 external event and 3 short batch files.  

        Set your external event for the day and time when you want 
        to set your clock back (I'm going to take advantage of being 
        in the Eastern time zone and change the clock at the 
        scheduled time, Sunday 0300) and insert this line in the 
        appropriate place in your GOBBS file: 

            ...
            IF ERRORLEVEL <error code you picked> FALLBACK
            ...

        Then set up these three batch files:

        Fallback.Bat is a 2 line batch file:

            TIME <the new time>
            SUICIDE

        Suicide.Bat is needed to make sure the clock isn't changed 
        when the scheduled time comes back around cause Fido will 
        exit again: 

            COPY WAITAMIN.BAT FALLBACK.BAT
            WAITAMIN

        Waitamin.Bat is one last 2 liner:

            <do something for a minute so Fido doesn't exit to DOS 
             right away> 
            GOBBS


        The only real problem with this method is that it will exit 
        to DOS again when the scheduled time comes back around in an 
        hour.  Suicide.Bat takes care of making sure the time 
        doesn't get changed again when this happens.  The delay in 
        Waitamin.Bat can be anything that will eat up the 1 minute

            All right, I will ask, what happened to the newsletter?  
        I was under the impression that this was a FIDO newsletter 
        and there would be articles and tips pertaining to BBS's and 
        the like.   Unfortunately, it has started to look like the 
        creative writing magazine that we used to publish in Junior 
        High school.  Don't get me wrong, if the "creative" writers 
        want to continue to contribute their drivel (whoops... 
        sorry... umm.... how about "Artistic Drivel"?), that's fine, 
        but how about if we limit the articles in the newsletter to 
        Fido or at least computer related articles, and we can have 
        another newsletter for the rest.  (At least that way I won't 
        have to waste my money downloading that one.) 
            
            Since I want to see computer related articles published, 
        I figured I would give a list of my FAVORITE software 
        packages.  I have been consulting on micros for over 9 years 
        and have had to try to find these packages for my customers.  
        I would be curious to see what other users think of these 
        selections.  
            
            UTILITY PROGRAMS:  Most of the best directory programs 
        are freeware.  My favorite are ND (Stands for nice directory 
        and it is certainly the most powerful), FDIR (which lists in 
        extension order) and D (very similar to SDIR but faster and 
        more options).  Everyone need norton utilities unless they 
        NEVER erase a file accidentally.  
            
            COMM PROGRAMS:  CROSSTALK is very flexible (which means 
        it takes a while to learn) but QMODEM is free and has 
        spiffier screen displays.  (Sorry, not free, a $20.00 
        contribution is requested and I plan to send my 20.00.  It 
        is a very polished package.  
            
            DATABASE:  I am not sure why everyone likes DBASE?  I 
        find it powerful but I have to do too much of the work 
        myself.  Any self-respecting database program should be able 
        to easily set up custom screens, eliminate dup keys and set 
        up rules for input.  RBASE is better but the 2 best I have 
        found are INFORMIX (A well kept secret!  Very popular in the 
        UNIX market but almost unknown in DOS.  It might have the 
        BEST custom screen input program and a very powerful report 
        writer.) and REVELATION.  You can do ANYTHING with either of 
        these and both are very fast.  If you like "C" then INFORMIX 
        is for you, otherwise R-BASIC which is included with 
        REVELATION allows you to write custom code.  
            
            WORD PROCESSING:  This is very subjective but I find 
        WordPerfect my favorite.  It is fast and powerful.  I like 
        Display Write 3 but the menus are too slow.  
            
            TEXT EDITORS:  If you need one, PMATE with its macro 
        capability is my favorite.  I have not used many others and 
        would like to hear what other programmers use.  
            
            GAME:  The Ancient Art of War.  The manual alone is 







FIDONEWS     --           21 Oct 85  03:02:40           Page 12

        almost worth the price.  
            

        There are a lot of other programs that I use and like alot, 
        (like ThinkTank, LMI Forth, etc.)  but I figure I can't 
        offer an opinion on these because I have not used their 
        competitors.)   I hope that no one writes back telling me 
        how great their favorite program is unless they have 
        compared it to others.

        Yet More Adventures of Luke Vaxhacker            Episode n+4

            Ok,  like,  remember  we left our heros in the detention 
        priority level?  Well, they're still there...  

            Luke quickly located the interface card and followed the 
        cables to a sound-proof enclosure.  He lifted  the  lid  and 
        peered at the mechanism inside.  

            "Aren't  you  a  little  slow for ECL?" printed princess 
        LPA0: 

            "Wha..?  Oh,  the Docksiders," stammered Luke.  He  took 
        off  his  shoes (for industry) and explained,  "I've come to 
        relocate you. I'm Luke Vaxhacker." 

            Suddenly,  forms started bursting around them.  "They've 
        blocked this queue!" shouted Solo.  "There's only one return 
        from this stack!" 

            "OVER HERE!" printed LPA0:  with  overstrikes.  "THROUGH 
        THIS  LOOPHOLE!"  Luke  and  the princess disappeared into a 
        nearby feature.  

            "Gritch, gritch," mumbled Two Bacco, obviously reluctant 
        to trust an Administrative oversight.  

            "I don't care how crufty it is!"  shouted  Con,  pushing 
        the Bookie toward the crock. "DPB yourself in there NOW!" 

            With one last blast that reprogrammed two flunkies,  Con 
        joined them.  The "Feature" landed them right in the  middle 
        of  the garbage collection data.  Pieces of code that hadn't 
        been used in weeks floated past in a pool of decaying bits.  

            "Bletch!" was Con's first comment. "Bletch, bletch," was 
        his second.  The Bookie looked as if  he  had  just  paid  a 







FIDONEWS     --           21 Oct 85  03:02:42           Page 14

        longshot,  and  the  odds  in  this  situation  weren't much 
        better.  

            Luke was tolling the garbage when  he  stumbled  upon  a 
        book  with  the  words  "Don't  Panic"  inscribed  in large, 
        friendly letters on the cover.  "This can't possibly help us 
        now," he said as he tossed the book away.  

            The  Bookie  was  about  to  lay  odds  on  it when Luke 
        suddenly  disappeared.   He  popped  up  across  the   pool, 
        shouting,  "This  is no feature!  It's a bug!!" and promptly 
        vanished again.  

            Con and the princess were about  to  panic()  when  Luke 
        reappeared. "What happened?" they asked in parallel.  

            "I  don't  know,"  gasped Luke.  "The bug just dissolved 
        automagically.  Maybe it hit a breakpoint..." 

            "I don't think so," said Con.  "Look  how  the  pool  is 
        shrinking. I've got a bad feeling about this..." 

            The princess was the first to realize what was going on.  
        "They've   implemented  a  new  compaction  algorithm!"  she 
        exclaimed.  

            Luke remembered the pipe he had open to 3CPU. "Shut down 
        garbage collection below recursion level 5!" he shouted.  

            Back in the control room,  RS232  searched  the  process 
        table for the lisp interpreter.  "Hurry," sent 3CPU. "Hurry, 
        hurry," added his other  two  processors.  RS232  found  the 
        interpreter,  interrupted  it,  and  altered the stack frame 
        they'd fallen into to allow a normal return.  

        ------------------------------------------------------------

            Some months later...  

            Luke was feeling rather bored.  3CPU  could  get  to  be 
        rather  irritating,  and  RS232  didn't  really speak Luke's 
        language.  Suddenly, Luke felt someone's eyes boring through 
        the back of his skull.  He turned slowly, to see... nothing.  
        A quiet voice came from somewhere in front of him.  

            "Grasshopper,  the carrier is strong within  you."  Luke 
        froze,  which was a good thing since his legs were insisting 
        that he run but they weren't likely to be  particular  about 
        direction.  Luke  guessed  that  his odds of getting lost in 
        the dense tree structures were pretty  good.  Unfortunately, 
        the Bookie wasn't available.  

            "Yes.  Very strong, but the modulation is yet weak.  His 
        network   interface   is  totally  undeveloped."  the  voice 
        continued.  A small furry creature walked out of  the  woods 
        as  Luke  stared on.  Luke's stomach had now joined the rest 
        of his body in loud complaints.  Whatever was peering at him 







FIDONEWS     --           21 Oct 85  03:02:44           Page 15

        was certainly small and furry,  but Luke was quite sure that 
        it didn't come from Alpha Centauri.  

            "Well,  well,"  said the creature as is rolled it's eyes 
        at Luke.  "Frobozz, y'know.  Morning,  name's modem.  What's 
        your  game?  Adventure?  D&D?  Or  are you just one of those 
        Apple-pong types that hang around the store demonstrations?" 
        Luke closed his eyes.  Perhaps if he  couldn't  see  it,  it 
        wouldn't notice him.  

            "H'mm,"  muttered  the  creature.  "Must use a different 
        protocol. @@@H @@ @($@@@H )"@G$ @#@@G' (o% @@@@@%%H(b ?" 

            "No, no," stammered Luke.  "I don't speak EBCDIC.  I was 
        sent  here  to  become  a  UNIX wizard.  Must have the wrong 
        address." 

            "Right address," said the creature.  "I'm a UNIX wizard.  
        Device  drivers a speciality.  Or do you prefer playing with 
        virtual memory?" 

            Luke eyed the creature  cautiously.  If  this  was  what 
        happened  to  system  wizards  after  years  of  late  night 
        crashes,  Luke wasn't sure he wanted anything to do with it.  
        He  felt a strange affection for the familiar microcomputers 
        of his home.  And wasn't virtual memory something  that  you 
        got from drinking too much Coke?
