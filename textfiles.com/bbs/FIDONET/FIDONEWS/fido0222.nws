        Fido #437 in net #117



        Remeber the days when the only people we
        really had to worry about where the Apple
        pirates?  Now we (the users of Fido) must
        be on The lookout for are own type pulling
        cute stunts! Starting about three issues
        back we had a message yelling help we've
        been robbed someone has taken a newly
        written program and put a a new name on it
        and called it "Public Domain". Another
        goodie is the idiot who wrote a program
        that does a "kill *.*". The only one that
        really makes me mad is the one that states
        "All Atari games such as Stargate, Robtron
        etc are pirated!" this made me a slight
        bit mad! Why? Because I got Stargate from
        my friend who got it from a board in
        Austin.  Oh well It looks like we are all
        subjects of life.  I would like to know
        what motivates these people that do this!
        Did a sysop make them mad?  Did a company
        make them mad?  I just wish they would
        keep their trash off of the public boards
        so America won't lose part of it's dream
        "Freedom".   Starting now it's going to be
        alot harder to run a Fido or anything else
        unless you're already running a pirate
        board. Now on the subject of pirate boards
        I have called some of the local ae lines
        in my city and asked one pirate what he
        thought of Public Boards and said "I think
        there childish" This my friends comes from
        the sysop (so they call their selves) of
        two pirate boards and also a High school
        dropout.  Who in this case is being
        childish? There is another pirate sysop in
        the local area whom I went to school with
        and he uses the public boards because he
        can't find a comm program he wants.  He
        wants an Apple version of Modem7 I guess
        he can't find something pirated that works
        just as well!   I don't think that public
        boards will ever be done away with or
        completely safe from computer rapscallion
        But the longer we stick together the
        better off we will be.

                        PROGRAMMING HINTS

        For all MSDOS/PCDOS systems

        I have always had the complaint  that  you  could  not  goto
        another  batch  file  and  return  where you left off in the
        first one.  Well  lo  and  behold  while  poking  around  on
        someone's  computer  the  other  day  I  found a file called
        BAT_NEST that gave the following hint.  From the first batch
        file issue the commmand

                COMMAND /c batchfile

        this will open and process the batch file indicated.    When
        it  is  done processing will continue at the next line after
        the COMMAND line in the first file.  This can continue for 7
        levels  of batch files.  I've tried it as far as four levels
        and it works great.

        One  word  of  caution,  you  remain  logged  on   to    the
        drive/directory where the origional batch file resides.

        FOR DEC RAINBOW SYSTEMS

        In an earlier article I described the process  necessary  to
        get COMMAND.COM to reside successfully in RAMDISk.  Recently
        I purchased DOIT and had problems  with  installing  it  and
        dropping  to  another  lever of COMMAND.COM.  After removing
        the COMSPEC program from the AUTOEXEC.BAT  everything  works
        smoothly.    Turns out DEC finally did a good deed and fixed
        the SET COMSPEC=??????????  command  in  2.11  MSDOS.    The
        system  even  seems  to  be  a  little  faster in program to
        program switching.  So anyone who has upgraded to  2.11  and
        uses COMMAND.COM from ramdisk I would recommend removing the
        COMSPEC program from the AUTOEXEC.BAT and from  the  system.
        Leave in the SET COMSPEC=?????.

        From:  Bob Hartman, Sysop 101/10101

                This is simply a request for information.  I
        am simply wondering how many Fido Sysops would like a
        utility that emulated the Fido message system.  This
        would be a standalone program separate from Fido (and
        hence much smaller), that could be used to peruse the
        different message bases, and reply to messages in any
        of them.  I know that a program called READMSG exists,
        but that is really just a simple program that you can
        use once you change directories to the proper place,
        and you know what messages you are interested in, etc.
        What I am proposing is a Fido emulator.

                Currently I am working on such a beast (I sort
        of needed most of it to implement my link to USENET
        anyway).  With a little bit more massaging for the case
        of the FidoNet message area, it will be complete.  If you
        are interested in this program, send me a FidoNet message,
        and when it is complete I will send a copy to you to test.
        It is written using all DOS calls only, so it should run
        on any machine, but who knows...I only have an IBM PC, so
        someone else will have to let me know what happens on a
        Rainbow, or other system.

                Now for the logical conclusion to this article...
        Since I have written the message base section of Fido in
        C (MANX Aztec C-86 version 3.20c), is anyone interested in
        helping write the rest of Fido in C?  Bob Briggs (the sysop
        from 15/464) was going to help me out, but he has to sell
        off his PC, and will no longer be a Fido node.  I know that
        there are apparently versions of Fido that are written in
        Turbo Pascal, but the version that I am working on will be
        in C.  Since MANX makes a line of compilers that covers
        almost all machines and operating systems, I am using them
        for the development.  I have been assured that if it runs
        under one MANX compiler, and uses no system specific calls,
        then it will run under another MANX compiler.  If this is
        so, then suddenly Fido can blossom to CPM systems, as well
        as other types of hardware.  We shall see...

                         Life and times, of a PIRATE    


        After reading views on piracy  and  copy protection, I 
        couldn't help but get my two cents worth in. Being an 
        experienced computer user of more than 8 years, and 
        programmer  who has been fortunate enough to have his ware's 
        marketed. I feel I've enough experience to converse on this 
        matter. Since I have purchased alot of software, and have 
        also pirated alot of software. First, I have to say I have 
        paid much money for software that isn't worth the media it's 
        saved on. All these beautiful ads! and nice write ups really 
        grab us, and shake us until the money falls out of our 
        pockets. "I have to have it!" we murmur, while hoping the 
        wife didn't over hear. Two weeks later, we rush the freshly 
        packaged disk into our machines, just to find its utter 
        trash.  

        True we should check out what we buy, but those of us who 
        live in the more rural parts of the country don't have the 
        computer stores that stock all the latest software packages.  
        Second, MOST software is WAY over priced. as someone said in 
        a recent newsletter, "The price of a wordstar wouldn't buy 
        his  services for a day" let alone the months is takes to 
        write a WORDSTAR. Well we're talking about more than one 
        sale here. And 300.00 for Wordstar is quite ridiculous! I 
        for one would NEVER pay such a price for software of ANY 
        kind. (At least not for anything I've seen on the market) 
        These software companies put these way out prices on this 
        software because the large corporations don't blink an eye 
        at spending several thousand on a handful of wordstar, or 
        symphony packages. But us small business, and hobbiest's 
        types flip at the thought.   This is why "I PIRATE".  

        I've heard quotes that we pirates would still pirate even if 
        the price was right. Not at all true! I have just about 
        every piece of software imaginable for my machine. Which I 
        need since I spend hours at it, and I get bored with things 
        easily and want to move on and see what else is new. When I 
        get tired of a package, I toss it in the box, never to boot 
        it again. (Imagine 300.00 a shot for this habit!) The reason 
        I say its not true, is I was given a FREE copy of Borland's 
        TURBO PASCAL. This I learned and toyed with for about 6 
        months, before I found it to be a truly astounding piece of 
        work. With the disk already in use, I ordered from Borland, 
        an "ORIGINAL" (perish the though!). And found the 39.95 tag 
        to be VARY FAIR! Even the 3.0 version with its 69.95 price 
        tag.  

        Another good example is, I had read and seen ads for the 
        newly released "GEM" operating system by digitial research.  
        I've pirated their stuff before, I have Concurrent PC-DOS, 
        that I was impressed with, and ALMOST BOUGHT after seeing it 
        demo'ed, I wanted it, but the 395.00 just couldn't be 
        justified. (If it was 89.95 Digitial Research would have 
        made the sale!) I finally found a freebee, played with for 







FIDONEWS     --           15 Jul 85  00:00:52           Page 6

        about 2 weeks, until I found its many short comings, (thank 
        god I didn't pay it's 300.00+ price tag! ) Then tossed it 
        too in the bone pile, and haven't booted it since. But GEM 
        was another story! A fellow pirate called and said he just 
        got a good chunk of the entire GEM package, which included 
        the GEM OS, the GEM PAINT, WRITE, copies of the doc etc. I 
        asked him to ship it out to me. Later the next day, I 
        stopped into the computer store, and low and behold they had 
        GEM too! I watched a brief demo, and asked the price. (ready 
        to hear the typical $$$) But no! $49.95 the salesman said!  
        Even though I KNEW I had it coming any day in the mail, I 
        BOUGHT the package because it was their when i wanted it, I 
        thought it looked like fun, and I'd rather have the more 
        colorful, original, documentation. This fair pricing was for 
        the OS ONLY! after seeing that the supporting PAINT, WRITE, 
        and others were near 200.00 each, I declined on those!  
        (again if they were 49.00 each I'd have taken one of each 
        without hesitation) I waited and received them in the mail 
        for free. But Digital, again, LOST THE SALE!  

        Games too are over priced. Another example, I pirate every 
        game I can find, since none have held my attention for over 
        a couple hours. And I`m not about to pay 39.00 for 2 hours 
        worth of fun. Until a store was going out of business! They 
        offered my AtariSoft games, at 9.95 each! and I bought 
        THREE! (the only 3 I didn't already have) Oh there was one 
        exception. The MS flight simulator! Even though I already 
        owned a pirated copy, I did order one mail order for 29.00.  
        This was because it is worth the price, as is Sub Logics 
        flight simulator called "JET" which is due out any day. I 
        have already placed an order for, since I've seen it at a 
        recent computer show.  

        So If I was a software company I would do what I could to 
        cut costs, and lower prices, and above all DUMP THE 
        PROTECTION! It doesn't hinder piracy at all, we still copy 
        everything we want, and crack the rest.  But it would be 
        nice to buy ZAXXON at 14.95 already in file form for hard 
        disk storage, rather than having to break it down myself.  
        True not all piracy would be stopped, Kids would still run 
        around trading games, but the piracy what would continue 
        would be software that the pirates would not purchase 
        normally anyway! Even freeware can be over priced, I've seen 
        requests for 50.00+ for something that's not worth a dime, 
        although the idea is promising. But I can honestly say I 
        have only paid for one piece of freeware...  John Friels  
        QMODEM! He's asked 10.00 (for the 1st version) which was 
        refreshing, since I would have paid up to 79.95 for it.  

        A good example of pricing again... I read about Borlands 
        SIDEKICK when it was new, I was hot for it! I found it at 
        the store, but they only had the "UNPROTECTED VERSION" which 
        for some reason was double the price of the protected 
        version. ( QUITE UNFAIR!  even for Borland) Well I wasn't 
        about to pay 89.00 for a program that sells for 49.00 with 
        protection! And since the store didn't stock the protected 
        49.95 version (I couldn't get it to crack it) AGAIN This

        time, Borland would have made the sale!) But they had to be 
        greedy and charge us more, just so we could use it from our 
        hard drives. As it turned out, I got a pirated copy, played 
        with it for a week, then tossed it in the bone pile, never 
        to be booted again.  

        So in closing, you can all voice your opinions on whats in 
        the mind of a software pirate, but the above insight is 
        coming from a pirate, which is not the thoughts of one, but 
        of 99 percent of the software traders that I deal with. You 
        can say what you want but...  

        PIRACY IS DUE TO SOFTWARE OVER PRICING!  

        Thank you for letting me set the record straight

                             USERS HAVE RIGHTS TOO

                             Radio Free FIDO 123/5

                             
                 Having been a sysop myself a  few  years  ago,  I  can 
        understand  how  a  sysop may feel.  Users will EXPECT that his 
        board is up  and  running.  They  will  EXPECT  that  they  can 
        download  everything  and contribute nothing,  if they so wish.  
        They EXPECT that they have the right to  drop  carrier  in  the 
        middle of their session, or tie the board up for hours. 

                 As  I  said,  users  EXPECT.  Maybe I'd better add the 
        word SOME in front of the word "users".  Infact,  a great  many 
        users  express  a great desire to not only use the board but to 
        help it grow.  I say more power to them. 

                 Now,  back to being a sysop.  If I wish to dedicate my 
        computer,  phone line and personal time to run a board,  then I 
        should be able to DICTATE what is permitted on my board.  After 
        all,  I'm the guy paying the bills  to  run  this  contraption.  
        It's  MY hobby!  If I don't want you to post the latest patches 
        to break Symphony's copy protection,  that's my  business,  not 
        yours. 

                 So it's pretty much agreed and understood that a sysop 
        can  do  whatever he or she pretty damn well pleases.  On their 
        board.  Anytime they want.  And no explanations  needed,  thank 
        you very much. 

                 However,  don't  users  have a FEW rights too?  A user 
        doesn't have many rights on a local BBS;  we've agreed he is at 
        the mercy of the sysop.  But,  let's consider for a moment what 
        would happen if a BBS was also a local host system for FIDONET.  
        Does this sysop have the right to censor  any  private  FIDONET 
        messages? 

                 Let's  give  an  example.  I am a sysop of a FIDO that 
        happens to also be the local  host  system  for  my  area.  All 
        FIDOMAIL  passes  through  my  board.  Now,  I also have strict 
        rules that govern my BBS.  I own a computer store, and will not 
        allow any messages to be posted  that  would  directly  compete 
        with services my store provides.  So far,  so good.  I'm within 
        my rights as a sysop to censor all messages for this  material. 
        After all, I'm not going to help my competition. 

                 Now,  here comes the problem (you knew there had to be 
        a problem,  Life's just a bowl of cereal).  A friend of a  user 
        sends  FIDOMAIL  from  his  node  in New York state telling his 
        friend of an exceptional hard disk drive deal. 10 megabytes for 
        $250.00 complete!  So,  he sends his friend FIDOMAIL  and  pays 
        his  money  to do so.  Money is deducted from his account,  and 
        all is well. 

                 That is, until that message hits my BBS.  This message 
        competes  with my business.  So,  therefore,  I will delete it.

        It will not be passed through my system,  since I too sell hard 
        disk  upgrade  kits.  I'd  be  shooting  myself in the foot.  I 
        delete the message, and no one knows anything. 

                 The question here is,  doesn't the user expect to have 
        the  right  to  receive  FIDOMAIL?  Isn't this particular sysop 
        imposing HIS set of rules upon the entire local FIDO community, 
        since he is a local host system?  Doesn't the  first  amendment 
        operate in this case? 
               
                 To make a similar example;  I am a Shiite working as a 
        mailman for the Postal Service.  Do I have the  right  to  deny 
        mail delivery to a Christian based on my religious beliefs?  Of 
        course not!

                 But  what about this sysop?  Does he have the right to 
        censor FIDOMAIL, even if it's a private message? 

                 My own thoughts say that the sysop  has  NO  right  to 
        censor FIDOMAIL.  If he has problems with any potential message 
        being routed through his system,  other than those that promote 
        illegal activity,  he shouldn't volunteer to be a host  system.  
        Let  some  other board handle the duties,  or remain outside of 
        FIDONET altogether.

                 Radio Free FIDO was founded on a belief that it is the 
        users who make the board, and it's up to us to continue to keep 
        it's  quality  high.  We've  formed  a  FIDO Users Group (FUG). 
        We're all a bunch of Fuggers.  The sysop guides the board,  and 
        lends  a  hand  when  needed.  We're  fortunate  to have such a 
        sponsor.  I can't  help  but  feel  the  boiling  blood  of  my 
        revolutionary  ancestors  when  the  word  "censor"  is spoken.  
        Thoughts? 
               
                 To  sum up my position,  I appeal to anyone who cannot 
        allow free flow of FIDOMAIL traffic through his system  to  NOT 
        consider becoming a host system.  To do so would go against the 
        grain of the FIDONET community, and prostitute the dream of Tom 
        Jennings.  LONG LIVE FIDONET.

                              Gnawing the Bone

        Mind if I talk a bit more about software piracy?  Thank you.

        We have an article this week about piracy, as seen from the 
        pirate's point of view.  I appreciate his viewpoint, and I'm 
        glad he wrote to tell us how he feels.  I'd just like to say 
        a few things about how it looks from my side of the fence.

        First of all, let's explode a myth.  Copy protection doesn't 
        add all that much to the cost of making software.  The 
        outfit that does our disk duplication adds copy protection 
        for a very modest fee.  Of course, you can go out and lay 
        down a bundle for Prolok if you want, but it's your own 
        fault if you do.  Copy protection is software, just like any 
        other.  It doesn't cost anything to add a few lines of code 
        to a program, and it doesn't cost much to add a key to a 
        disk.

        So what does cost?  Well, disks don't grow on trees, for one 
        thing.  And it does cost a bit for disk duplication (you can 
        spend an afternoon making 200 copies on your PC if you want, 
        but I won't).  You also need a manual, or nobody will be 
        able to use your product.  This can get very expensive if 
        you want professional typesetting, but let's assume that you 
        are willing to settle for a cruder, "home-grown" look, so 
        you'll run it off on your printer and call it "camera 
        ready".

        Then of course you'll need some sort of packeging.  Silk 
        screened binders and printed boxes are expensive, so let's 
        settle for the ubiquitous vinyl folder (now you know why 
        it's so common).

        Don't forget that all this doesn't come prepackaged.  What 
        you'll get is a box of folders, a box of disks, and a stack 
        of manuals.  Be prepared to spend a couple of afternoons 
        putting it all together.

        By now you've already spent a fair chunk of cash out of your 
        own pocket.  (Don't forget that, for a professional 
        offering, you should expect to spend ten times as long on 
        debugging, polishing things up, putting in on-line help, and 
        so forth.  Once you've sent the master disk out for 
        duplication it is too late to fix any bugs.)  Assuming you 
        were putting together a run of a hundred, with all the 
        software fitting on one disk and with a modest manual, 
        you've probably spent on the order of three or four hundred 
        bucks.  You may think that your troubles are over.  Hardly!

        What you've bought for your money is a stack of packages 
        piled on your kitchen table.  Now you've got to get someone 
        to buy them.  You could take out ads in a few of the trade 
        journals, but be prepared to spend upwards of $50,000 doing 
        it for a month.  You can mail out review copies to all the 
        magazines, but they get hundreds of packages a month and 
        will probably never even open yours.  You might get someone 
        else to distribute it for you, but that's hard to do if you 
        don't have a proven track record for marketable software 
        (the old chicken-and-egg problem).  You can probably find a 
        few local software stores who are willing to carry it on 
        consignment, but don't expect to sell more than a half dozen 
        copies that way.  

        So you are now in the realm of MARKETING, and that takes big 
        bucks.  So you mortgage the house, the car, the wife and 
        kids, and spend it all on advertising in the whistful hope 
        that your package will catch on and be a success.  Or 
        perhaps you go find some venture capital, hire a marketing 
        consultant, and lose control over your own product.  

        Is this dream of being a major software company overnight 
        starting to tarnish a bit?  Wait, it gets worse!  

        So say you "over" price your product at $100.  If your 
        initial run sells out completely you will gross ten grand, 
        which is not enough to cover your advertising costs, not to 
        mention paying the mortgage and putting food on the table 
        while you pursue your dream.  

        I'm told that a "hot" product sells ten thousand copies in 
        this business.  Granted, Lotus and Borland both do better, 
        but not much of anybody else.  A more reasonable figure for 
        a typical package is probably under a thousand, but let's 
        think big.  Ten thousand copies at a "reasonable" cost of 
        thirty bucks a piece comes out to $300,000.  Looks like a 
        lot of money, doesn't it?  Now figure you spent, oh, half 
        that much on marketing costs.  Another thirty grand goes to 
        physical costs (disks, jackets, manuals; we'll ignore the 
        high school kids you hired to help put it all together).  
        Unexpected costs (there are ALWAYS unexpected costs) will 
        take a big chunk, but let's call it twenty grand to make the 
        numbers simpler.  Your net is then $100,000.  Uncle Sam will 
        gladly help himself to half of that, leaving you with 
        $50,000 for yourself.  

        Now consider that this is only true if your product is a 
        bona-fide winner.  If it falls flat on its face (which it 
        easily could, through no fault of your own), then you are 
        out a couple of hundred grand, and get nothing.

        It's a gamble, no two ways about it.  You put everything on 
        the line in the slim hope that you'll come up with a winner.

        I've been writing and selling software for a long time now.  
        I do this stuff for a living.  I, too, have the dream of

        coming up with a winner, something that everyone will want 
        and use.  Now people are coming along and telling me that I 
        charge too much, that I should shoot the works and gamble 
        everything I own for peanuts.  Nuts is right!  Why should I 
        take that risk if the payoff isn't worth it?
