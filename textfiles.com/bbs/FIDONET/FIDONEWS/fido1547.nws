                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     Greetings,

     What a week it was.  Travelled to much, thank you!

     On the subject of being disgusted, remember? :-)

     Take this scenario:

     The moderator of 'X' echo, has the password to amend and/or change
     it's entry and whatever it needs to do, in order to keep said echo
     on the backbone.  Great, nothing difficult about that.

     A new moderator is appointed and takes over the duties of said echo.
     He/she does not have the password in order to sent the update, but
     the update is politely done by the ex-moderator.  Great, still not
     difficult.

     The new moderator wants to update the details (or whatever) him/her-
     self but without the said password, is unable to do so.  Now what?
     So how does the newly appointed moderator obtain the current
     password?  One of two ways, as I see it.  Great, nothing difficult
     about that.

     The new moderator contacts the ex-moderator and request said password
     with no results.   However, the list keeper ofcourse, knows the said
     password by means of looking it up in the database, or such similar
     setup and could pass it on to the newly appointed moderator OR, do
     the changes for said moderator.

     Whats the moral of the story?  Let me explain as I see it:

     The list keeper has NO right to -

        a. supply the new moderator the current password or
        b. change the password or
        c. change details of the echo with permission of the password
            holder. ie. Ex-moderator in the above scenario.

     BUT, the details have been changed, now what?

     What it means, is that the list keeping system is no longer 'secure'
     and can be changed at will by any one and sundry.

     This is a sad state affairs for FidoNet, since echomail is one item,
     which keeps FidoNet allive and well!

     Secrecy has been violated!  Get rid of the echolist keeping system.
     It's useless with what has happened recently!
     Great, so what is so difficult keeping a password secret?

     I know, there will be readers who will e-mail/netmail me about the
     bove, but remember, if the shoe fits, wear it.

     Should commercial advertising be allowed in FidoNews?  YES and NO.

     Let me explain YES and NO.

     YES - if it is related to BBS's and/or FidoNet or both, I will allow
     it.
     NO - if it has nothing to do with either of the above, simple.

     If you have a new version or new product which does something for
     BBS's or FidoNet, it can be advertised in FidoNews.

     If you have a web site which promotes FidoNet, it may advertised
     in FidoNews.  If said web site promotes porno, stay away, it will not
     be allowed in FidoNews.  I'm sure you get my meaning. ;-)

     Happy reading,

     Interaction - Douglas Myers

                                 INTERACTION
                                 Doug  Myers

     I'd like to welcome Bob Satti back to the Z1C echo.  Bob, you're
     actually giving better than you're getting right now - keep up the
     interaction.  What's important about your interaction is the
     debunking effect it has.  Folks really want to know what's going on
     with Fido, and the imagination will readily supply any details
     necessary to fill in the picture.  When you are remote, the echoes
     fill with stories of vast conspiracies, awesome power struggles, and
     plots to keep the proletariat sysops firmly ground beneath the heel.

     On the other hand, it was kinda good for this individual - who isn't
     otherwise "in the know" - to hear that Bob Kohl's denials just
     weren't that important to you, that every message that crosses your
     system isn't made public because it's just too damned much trouble,
     and that "noted" isn't really a ritual damnation.

     As for our own behavior... well, I can't control it any more than
     you control all things in Fidonet.

     Clay Tannacore will continue to believe you when you say Kohl
     resigned, then have doubts when Kohl denies it.  Perhaps you could
     dig up the archives to satisfy him, but you'll continue to be in the
     position of having the authority to do what you want so long as you
     justify it to him and don't set any precedents.

     Lynn Gypson will continue to want more input than you have to give.
     She's not a troublemaker, but she does think you have more time and
     resources than any one guy could muster in a lifetime.

     Darrell Slater will continue to ask you to resign.  There's nothing
     you can do about it - you're at the top of a structure he doesn't
     believe in and empowered by a policy he doesn't think is legitimate.
     You would need to fire the RCC and void Policy 4 to satisfy him, and
     I doubt that this is within your power.

     And folks will continue to demand leadership while insisting that
     you're no more than a nodelist clerk.  It's the nature of the family.

     Small things make up a lot

     by Adriano Garcia*, from Uberaba/MG, Brazil (1:396/45.19)

     Since my last article on FidoNews (in fact it was a guest editorial)
     I've been getting a lot of feedback of Fido folks discussing the
     issues of promoting the net and the BBSing hobby in general. So
     I decided to repeat the great effort - and pleasure - of writing
     an article discussing the trends that go with this hobby of ours.

     There is a lot of discouraged people out there. And there's plenty
     of reasons for that and one have just to read the sysop conferences
     to find them out. Every single good cause that is brought up is
     carefully taken down by old fashioned rivalry. Now that I've given
     up on talking about the ever renewing fights between sysops, now
     I'm taking a broader view to encompass promoting BBSes in general.

     Not long ago, I've subscribed to the PROMOTE_BBS echo. When I did
     it, I thought that BBSing really needs to be promoted if we want
     to keep it alive for ourselves in the future. I won't dare to say
     that we have to keep it to ours sons and grandsons because I'm
     still 24 <g> and also because, in this ever changing world of
     online connection, it just may be to 'dreamy' now.

     Now back to the real world. When I got my first packet of
     PROMOTE_BBS (in fact a rescanned one), all I could see was a bunch
     of new ideas brought down by people discussing - guess? - elections
     for a so-called entity designed to help promoting BBSes. Now what?
     Do we need to setup a political chain just to say what we have to
     do to promote the system we know so well? How would it work on
     a local situation? Will that lonely sysop from Troy, PA, have to
     wait for a decision from a Board of Directors to start a local
     campaign according to the objectives of the council?

     Why do we have to centralize and build up a chain of command? Why
     don't people just get together on local chapters to promote the
     system on the local level and start a forum to discuss and
     share their experiences?

     Somebody told me once that humans are political by nature. Maybe he
     told me that because politics replaced physical violence with the
     violence of words. I cannot understand what is the difference between
     killing somebody with words or with a gun. They both simbolize the
     same kind of action.

     As happens with pennies and relationships, small pieces make up
     a lot sometimes, mainly because they are so small that they aren't
     accounted for until they become big things. But, many times, big
     things are also very hard to face and when they get bigger they
     are harder to ignore and destroy.

     With this kind of actions between people that were supposed to be
     allies, we are just creating those small things that will keep many
     away from BBSing and from FidoNet.

     ECHOLADE - refreshing echomail.  Hans Mangold explains the Exodus

     In this response to Bob Short, Hans Mangold counters the theory that
     the style of posting in FN_SYSOP is responsible for the exodus of
     Fidonet Sysops.

                                   -- -- --

      BS> If the majority of departing fido sysops feel as I do about the
      BS> sort of BS that goes on in this echo (and a few others, to be
      BS> fair),  I'd wager this was a contributing factor in their
      BS> decision to leave the net.

     Bob, please -- whatever happens in this echo, Z1C, or elsewhere,
     makes little difference.  Open your eyes and look at the traffic in
     the once popular echoes, like Genealogy, once 550 and more messages
     per day, now 2.3 (yes, two-point-three).  And that was/is a well
     moderated echo!

     My BBS was once upon a time the busiest in our entire Region; heck,
     I'm sure there were times (days, weeks) when more echomail from BBS
     callers originated here than anywhere else in Zone 1.  Today, Nov.
     17, 1998, my system is the only BBS left in our city.  With all of
     the promotions I've done here, including feature articles in the
     Daily Newspaper, Fido was/is very well known around here -- but the
     thousands of people who once enjoyed Fido locally prefer the
     internet today.  As Yogi Berra would have said: if people don't want
     to call my BBS, there's nothing I can do to stop them.

     Even having an "exclusive" in our fair city now, I'm down to two or
     three BBS callers per day, four on a rainy day.  That is the reason
     many SysOps pull the plug -- not seeing any purpose anymore to all
     of the work that goes into running a system.

     So, please, don't bother blaming FN_SYSOP for the decline in Fidonet
     -- BBS callers don't have access and SysOps suit themselves -- some
     participate, others just lurk, and the majority doesn't waste HD
     space for the traffic.  The most recent FN_SYSOP moderator election
     produced 57 votes.  57 -- for an _international_ sysop echo.  Think
     about it.  The annual election was a chance for change -- 10 votes
     FIDONEWS 15-47               Page 6                   23 Nov 1998


     were cast for the former moderator, and 47 for other candidates --
     only 47 wanted change!  =If= your philosophy had any merit, e.g.
     blaming FN_SYSOP for disappearing nodes, I'm sure more than 47 out
     of (almost) 20,000 nodes would have sent a clear signal.  Instead,
     the signal was one of "who cares about FN_SYSOP".....   :-(

     No use crying over spilled milk and lingering in the past.  Surely
     Fidonet will sort itself out as time progresses; some of us have
     Fido in our blood and we'll stick around for a long time to come --
     for our own pleasure more so than for the pleasure of (non-existent)
     BBS callers.  Others see it as a waste of time and will drop out --
     I mean, Fido once upon a time was a great resource for technical
     information.  Now, look at it -- once popular echoes like HS_MODEMS
     (with Rick Collins as excellent moderator) don't have one single
     message for =weeks=.  Not a pretty picture all around, and no easy
     solutions.

     Sysops have always come and gone in the past; only difference today
     is that it is no longer the ambition of every kid with a PC in town
     to become a sysop when ICQ has so much more to offer to the "instant
     society".  The state of FN_SYSOP has little influence on existing
     nodes; guess Randy Bush was right after all.

     FTSC Elections
     by Goran Eriksson, 2:201/505, get@get.pp.se

     Odinn Sorensen has informed us that he wants step down as FTSC
     Administrator as soon as another person is ready to take over that
     office.

     Furthermore, a number of FTSC Standing Members have resigned.

     To fill these vacancies, there will be two separate elections:

     1. An election for new Standing Members.

        Number of positions to be filled:
           Not a definite number. According to FTA-1001 the FTSC shall
           have no less than 7 and no more than 30 members. Therefore a
           minimum of 0 and a maximum of 11 new Standing Members may be
           appointed.
        Eligibility for appointment:
           See FTA-1001.
        Nominations:
           Special nominating committees are not planned at this time.
           Anyone wishing to be nominated or wishing to nominate someone
           should therefore contact a FidoNet RC or REC of their own
     FIDONEWS 15-47               Page 7                   23 Nov 1998


           choice, soliciting support for the nomination. The nomination
           period starts immediately and ends on 1998-12-10 at 24:00 UTC.
           RC's and REC's wishing to nominate someone should do so to the
           election administrator. RC's and REC's are encouraged to send
           their nominations by crash mail. If they choose to use routed
           netmail they do so on their own risk. RC's and REC's may
           nominate multiple candidates. As well from inside their
           respective regions as from outside. The election administrator
           shall no later than 1998-12-11 at 24:00 UTC publish a list of
           the received valid nominations in the FTSC_PUBLIC echomail
           conference. The election administrator shall also send a copy
           of this list to each nodelisted RC and REC.
        Votes:
           Only votes from nodelisted RC's and REC's will be accepted
           provided that they are received by the election administrator
           no earlier than 1998-12-11 at 00:00 UTC and no later than
           1998-12-31 at 24:00 UTC. RC's and REC's are encouraged to send
           their votes by crash mail. If they choose to use routed netmail
           they do so on their own risk. Votes for Standing Members should
           indicate what candidates each voter is supporting. Only those
           candidates obtaining support from more than 50 % of the total
           number of RC's and REC's casting valid votes will be considered
           successfull. Successfull candidates will be appointed according
           to the total number of supportive votes they have received. The
           one with the highest number of supportive votes will be
           appointed first etc. If more than one successfull candidate
           compete for the last Standing Member position to be filled
           (making the total number of FTSC members equal to 30) with the
           same number of supportive votes, the ZCC will be requested to
           appoint theat Standing Member from among theses competing
           successfull candidates. If the ZCC has not communicated it's
           decision in the FTSC_PUBLIC echomail conference before
           1999-01-31 at 24:00 UTC, that last position will remain
           unfilled.
        Results:
           The election administrator shall publish the election result in
           the FTSC_PUBLIC echomail conference no later than on 1999-01-07
           at 24:00 UTC. In case of a tie about the last position to be

       3.1 FTSC Administrator
       ----------------------

       The FTSC administrator is appointed for a four year renewable term.

       To be eligible for appointment, an individual must be a Fidonet
       node, be actively involved in Fidonet, though not necessarily in a
       programming context, and should have proven organizational skills.
       A candidate need not be a member of the FTSC. It is recommended
       that a successful candidate not carry any *C or *EC
       responsibilities during the term of office.

       A candidate for FTSC Administrator may be nominated by any Standing
       Member.

       The FTSC Administrator is appointed on the basis of a vote by all
       Standing Members who are defined by the then-current edition of
       FTA-1003 (FTSC Membership List). A successful candidate must
       receive approval by at least a plurality of votes.

       Publication of the nominations and the voting procedure shall take
       place openly in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo, and voting shall close three
       weeks after publication of the vote. Votes shall be by netmail
       ballot to an independent enumerator.

       Responsibilities:

       1. Ensuring FTSC Mandate is adhered to.
       2. Facilitating communications links between members.
       3. Maintaining document distribution links.
       4. Coordinating all membership nominations and voting.
       5. Developing Working Groups as required.
       6. Ensuring that the FTSC seeks, accepts and responds to public
          input.
       7. Assigning FSP numbers to new Standards Proposals.


       3.2 FTSC Standing Members
       -------------------------

       FTSC members are appointed for a two year renewable term.  [50 % of
       appointments on initial formation of the FTSC shall be for a 3 year
       renewable term, to ensure continuity of the Committee on expiry of
       the terms.]

       To be selected as a FTSC member, an individual must be a Fidonet
       node, and should be actively involved in Fidonet. Examples include
       having put out a Fidonet-related product or having updated a
       product in the preceding two years, or having experience as a
       Coordinator, Echomail Coordinator or mail or file Hub.

       Standing members may be nominated Fidonet-wide by all of the
       following methods:

       1. Any RC or REC.
       2. A nominating committee established for the purpose by the FTSC.
     FIDONEWS 15-47               Page 10                  23 Nov 1998


       3. A nominating committee established for the purpose by the ZCC.

       A nominating committee may not consist of any current member or
       officer of the FTSC.

       Standing members are appointed on the basis of a vote by all RCs
       and RECs who are nodelisted as holding those positions at the time
       the nominations are published. A successful candidate must receive
       approval by a majority of votes.

       Publication of the nomination and the voting procedure, and posting
       of RC and REC votes, shall take place openly in the FTSC_PUBLIC
       echo, and voting shall close three weeks after publication of the
       vote.

       Santronics Software Announces the purchase of Mustang Software's,

     software products have been in the market for over 12 years with a
     solid reputation for excellent engineering and reliable design.  To
     date Mustang's products have accumulated over 50,000 licensed
     customers worldwide.

     "Wildcat! was an outstanding foundation for the creation of a great
     company," said Jim Harrer, president and chief executive officer of
     Mustang Software.  "Based on the rapid growth of the Internet Message
     Center as the leading e-mail management solution, the time has come to
     transition Wildcat!  Santronics will provide the support and
     development necessary to continue the strong Wildcat! tradition for
     present and future customers worldwide."

     flagship product, Platinum Xpress (PX). PX is an popular add-on module
     to the WINServer system.  Santronics is a qualified and knowledgeable
     developer of WINServer software and the current Wildcat! customer base

     wants to tell the world that WINServer is an ideal solution for the
     Internet with features unique to the market," said Mr. Santos.

     Santronics plans to integrate the company's current Silver Xpress
     Offline Mail System with the Offline Xpress for Windows version
     (OLX/Win).  The end result will be a powerful new "all purpose"
     offline Mail Reader for Windows.  Silver Xpress will remain available
     as a DOS based offline mail reader.

     What's Not Happening - Zorch Frezberg, Trustee

        | There isn't always something happening on Fidonet, but |
        | there's always something which isn't happening.  This  |
        | column is dedicated to the lost causes which make Fido |
        | what it isn't today.  Published semi-occasionally...   |
        `-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --'
          Douglas Myers        1:270/720        doug@mdtnbbs.com

     IN ZORCH WE TRUST...

     While most Fidonet echoes are considered the property of their
     listed moderator for administrative purposes, most moderators
     consider themselves stewards of their echo for the participants.
     FN_SYSOP takes this concept one step further, explicitly naming the
     Fidonet Sysops as owners of the echo, and mandating an annual
     election of the moderator.  The sysops of FN_SYSOP recently elected
     Rob Ferrara as the new moderator, replacing Zorch Frezberg as the
     previous moderator.

     That's what happened... now for what didn't happen.

     One of the major responsibilities of a moderator is to maintain an
     accurate listing with the Echolist Robot.  Rob was never given the
     password to accomplish this himself... instead, Zorch Frezberg
     updated the listing, but retained the password unto himself.
     Realizing that he was locked out of the future capability of
     discharging his obligation without the password, Rob Ferrara
     corresponded with Thom LaCosta (the Echolist Robot Keeper)
     explaining the situation and requesting that the password be changed
     to one of his choosing. Thom, considering the recent election as
     sufficient proof that Rob is the legitimate moderator, made that
     change.

     Thom immediately came under fire for this gross application of common
     sense.  Zorch Frezberg revealed a secret "trusteeship," - previously
     unknown to all but himself, Bob Moravsik, and Bob Kohl - which
     mandated that Zorch should retain the password in trust for Rob.
     Complicating this claim is the fact that such an arrangement is not
     written into the echo rules and that no such trusteeship was known
     to the sysops of the echo either before or during the vote.
     Nonetheless, Thom LaCosta is characterized as dishonest by Zorch,
     Bob, and Bob for changing the password and thwarting the (as yet
     unrevealed) purpose of the "trusteeship."

     Is there any substance to the claim that the password should be held
     in trust?  Apparently, such an arrangement existed in the past.
     FN_SYSOP was on the backbone for years before it became common to
     elist echoes.  In the initial years when FN_SYSOP was listed, the
     moderator then didn't wish to maintain the listing, so it was
     FIDONEWS 15-47               Page 15                  23 Nov 1998


     handled by another individual.  It's further apparent that Bob
     Morasvik held the password through the terms of several moderators
     without revealing it to them, but then losing it after he revealed
     it to another individual.  Ironically, no other individual held the
     password while Zorch Frezberg was moderator.

     But did these arrangements constitute a trust?  There's no record of
     the matter ever being discussed among the sysops, presumably the
     group who would grant such a trust.  There's certainly nothing
     written in the echo rules or any other public record.  Furthermore,
     the sysops in the echo seem to overwhelmingly reject the idea that
     the password should be withheld from the elected moderator.

     And Rob Ferrara is adamant that he only share the password with an
     individual of his choosing.  A cursory look at those who are
     advocating the "trusteeship" would seem to lend credibility to his
     attitude:

     Zorch Frezberg - Zorch is the moderator who was just voted out of
     office, which might hint at a lack of trust by the sysops in the
     echo.  Zorch is accused of several irregularities in the past two
     years, including the filing of a frivolous policy complaint and
     voting multiple times in the last ZEC election (admittedly, this
     latter is unproven - or at least unpersued, but widely believed).
     Is this the kind of person the sysops would want as a "trustee?"

     Bob Morasvik - Bob is widely known for his "legal" assumption of
     echoes.  His past practice is to target echoes which are about to
     expire from the elist, and then flood the robot with elist entries
     in the hope that the current moderator will fail to update in time.
     Among his "successes" are the administrative echoes in his region,
     now unused as the regional officers were forced to list alternate
     echoes for regional conversation.  Is this "trustee" material?

     Bob Kohl - This Bob resigned under pressure as Regional Coordinator.
     He is most remembered for revealing in-transit netmail and driving
     one of the nets in his region to relocate to another region.  He was
     removed as Zone Echomail Coordinator by the Zone Coordinator at the
     request of the Regional Echomail Coordinators.  Is this "trustee"
     material?

     The above three individuals are still demanding that Thom LaCosta
     re-establish the old password and endorse the "trusteeship," but so
     far this is still What's Not Happening.
