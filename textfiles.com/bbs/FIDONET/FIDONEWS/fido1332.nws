     FidoNews is moving right along. Submissions are becoming stable and
     steady. The format has settled in and folks are even sending in new
     dates for the calendar. [grin]

     Regarding submissions - if you want to have an article title appear
     in the Table of Contents of the Issue, you MUST put the title line
     on the FIRST LINE at the FIRST COLUMN of your text. I will adjust
     ARTSPEC.DOC to make this more clear. If the asterisk line appears
     ANYWHERE else in your text, it will be treated as part of the text
     and will neither be added to the Table of Contents nor stripped out.

     The FidoNews public-key has been removed from direct publishing in the
     Issues due to concerns expressed by ZC1. The public-key continues to
     be available by file-request for FNEWSKEY or download from this
     system. I have requested a ZCC ruling about its future inclusion in
     the FidoNews. Nothing beats the weekly distribution of FidoNews as a
     transport mechanism to most of FidoNet.

     Please note that the FidoNet Software Listing section begins its
     second incarnation in today's Issue. These listings will now be
     coordinated by Peter Popovich at 1:363/264. Send your corrections,
     additions, and updates directly to him via Netmail. He is beginning
     his task by repeating the last version listing that appeared in
     FidoNews back in 1992. Obviously, this means MOST if not all of the
     listings are hideously out-of-date. If you have personal knowledge of
     current versions of any of these listed programs OR of NEW programs
     not listed, please let Peter know ASAP and he will verify and adjust
     the listing. This will be a cooperative project that will take time
     to get up and running 100%. Your assistance is actively solicited.

     The Reviews column of Damian Walker is not ready yet while he's
     tracking down a couple more updates to test. It should be appearing
     next week or the week thereafter.

     Once again, EVERYBODY who reads FidoNews is ENCOURAGED to throw their
     two cents [or ten bucks] into this forum. The FIDONEWS Echo is flowing
     over the Stars and we're still waiting for Planet Connect to update
     their configuration to get it out to everyone else. If you don't have
     Netmail or email access, you can still contribute via FIDONEWS Echo
     once we get that going everywhere.

     I hope you're enjoying the renovated FidoNews as much I am. [grin]

     C.B.

      NOTE: I got several responses to last week's Question of the Week
            about archives of ALL the FidoNews issues ever published. My
            thanks to all who pointed me to obtaining a complete set. They
            are now available here for file-request or download as listed
            in the Masthead at the end of every Issue.

     Creating Network Wide Bulletins [I]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     My article in FidoNews last week made mention of network-wide
     bulletins made possible by document server software.  Starting this
     week I will elaborate on the idea, with a two-part tutorial on how to
     offer your own bulletin to other Fidonet systems and users.
         I shall concentrate on three pieces of software for the purposes
     of this article.  These are NetMgr 1.00.g4, FDInt 1.00 and InfoMail
     1.11.
         NetMgr is a popular general-purpose netmail tool written by Gerard
     van Essen of 2:281/527. It is configured using a text file, and is
     capable of acting as much more than a document server.  Needless to
     say, I will be concentrating on its abilities as a document server for
     this article.
         FDInt is a utility for FrontDoor sysops, written by Colin Turner
     of 2:443/13. Again, it is a general purpose tool, of which the
     document server is only a small part.
         InfoMail needs no introduction for regular readers of FidoNews, as
     it has been advertised in issue 1329.  It is my own creation, and it
     is a dedicated document server for sysops using a *.MSG netmail area.
         Please accept my apologies for the lack of coverage of other
     platforms, as it is impossible for me to test the methods described in
     this article with any program that doesn't run on a DOS PC.  I am also
     limited to software which I have found locally, or on the Internet. If
     you know of any other software with document server capabilities, be
     sure to let FidoNews readers know about it.
         Full information is available in the documentation which comes
     with the software, and I will not attempt to duplicate that
     information here.  The purpose of this article is as much to show you
     what is involved in producing network-wide bulletins as to show you
     how to use the software for this purpose.

         Now we move on to the business of the day, that of setting up a
     bulletin.  Before you start, you really need to know what information
     you want to offer, and indeed, if a bulletin is the best way to do it.
         A few ideas spring to mind as ideal uses for a document server,
     some of which I may have mentioned in my article in FidoNews 1329.
     Echo information and rules, BBS adverts, electronic magazines and
     details of local events are good examples.
         Once you have in mind exactly what information it is that you want
     to share with other Fidonet users, you can make a start on setting up
     the bulletin.

         The first thing you need to do is to install the software you
     intend to use, and to supply general configuration details to the
     program.  The procedure is quite different for each of the pieces of
     software this article covers, and so I will touch on the subject only
     briefly here.  Refer to the documentation for more details.
         To set up NetMgr, you need to create its configuration file.  This
     is a standard text file which you will create using your favourite
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 3                    5 Aug 1996


     text editor.  The file should be called NETMGR.CFG, and you need to
     place the following line somewhere in the file:

             Home <address>
             HudsonPath <path>
             ScanDir <area>

     If you are using a *.MSG area for your netmail, <area> should simply
     be the directory containing the *.MSG's.  If you are using Squish,
     directory should be preceded by $; if you are using JAM, precede the
     area path with !, and if you are using a Hudson message board, <area>
     should be a # followed by the Hudson message board.
         <Address> is simply your netmail address.  You can give as many
     Home commands as you have AKA addresses.  This is all you need for the
     initial installation of NetMgr, although you will have to add your
     bulletins (see later) before the setup is of any use as a document
     server.
         <Path> is the path to your Hudson message base.  This is only
     necessary if you use a Hudson area for your netmail.
         FDInt uses a proprietary setup program which is run automatically
     when you first install the software (it comes as an EXE file).
     Afterwards you run:

         FDISETUP

     at the command line.  FDINT takes much of its general configuration
     from FrontDoor's setup file, so installation takes minimal effort.
         First, you need to set up the name(s) which FDInt will respond to
     in its capacity as a document server.  You can access this option from
     the Names and Commands menu, Server Names option.  For example, you
     could have users address their document requests to 'DocServ'.
         If you wish, bulletins may be split into groups.  In this case,
     group names may be specified using the Groups option on the Names and
     Commands menu.
         InfoMail does not automatically interface with FrontDoor or any
     other mailer, so you will have to spoon feed it with a little more
     information.  Like FDInt, it uses a proprietary setup program to
     access its configuration.  To set up InfoMail, use the following
     command:

         INFOMAIL -S

     The screen which appears contains five fields.  You need to specify
     your netmail directory (the Netmail field): this is the full path to
     your *.MSG netmail directory.  InfoMail can only respond to one name,
     and this is defined in the 'Name' field.  You can leave this as
     'InfoMail' or change it to something else such as 'DocServ'.
         The last mandatory piece of information is the netmail address for
     InfoMail; this defaults to 2:2502/666 which will hardly be useful for
     your own system.  You would usually put your own primary netmail
     address in here.  The current release of InfoMail does not support
     multiple AKA's directly; see the documentation for ways to get around
     this.
         If you want, you can also specify in the remaining fields global
     header and footer files for the bulletins InfoMail posts; these will
     be short sections of text placed at the top and bottom of the body of
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 4                    5 Aug 1996


     every outgoing bulletin.

         Once the general configuration has been done, you will want to set
     up the entry for the bulletin itself.  Again, this procedure is
     different for each piece of software, but before examining the methods
     in detail, let us sketch out some details of the document record, for
     example purposes.
         There should be some way of identifying the bulletin from the
     user's point of view, as all the software under consideration allows
     multiple bulletins to be hosted.  This would be the document Tag.
     NetMgr, as you will see, allows documents to be requested in whatever
     way you please, but both FDInt and InfoMail use a specific name and
     address in the 'To:' field and a document tag on the subject line, so
     for the purposes of this article I will standardise on this method,
     and use the tag 'MyDoc'.
         Next, we need to know where the text file is, which will contain
     the actual text of the bulletin.  In these examples I will use the
     filename 'C:\BULLETIN\MYDOC.TXT'.  Now for the technical details.
         Using NetMgr you specify a mask for each bulletin, and the mask
     contains details of how NetMgr will identify a message as a document
     request, as well as how it identifies the bulletin.  Assuming we want
     the bulletin to be posted when a user posts a message to 'DocServ' at
     your address with the subject 'MyDoc', you would add the following to
     your NETMGR.CFG file:

         Mask *,*,DocServ,@myaka,MyDoc,*

     The first, second and sixth fields are the originating name and
     address, and the attributes of the inbound message, and don't concern
     us here.
         The third field is the name we want NetMgr to answer to; it is the
     equivalent of the global features of FDInt and InfoMail, but has the
     advantage that you can specify a different user name for each
     bulletin, as well as a different subject tag.
         The fourth field is the address which bulletin requests must be
     sent to; as with the previous field, it is a global setting in FDInt
     and InfoMail which can vary from bulletin to bulletin in NetMgr.
         The final field is the document tag; NetMgr will examine the
     subject line of the message and identify a subject of 'MyDoc' as a
     request for our document.
         To get this far with FDInt and InfoMail is much more simple if a
     little less versatile.  The 'to' user name and address have already
     been specified in the global setup, so we just have to add the
     document tag.
         Using FDInt, make sure you are in FDISETUP, and access the
     Document Manager from the main menu.  Here you can hit INS and enter
     the document name 'MyDoc' in the 'Tag' field.
         Using InfoMail, you must be in the document list editor,
     accessible from the command line using:

         INFOMAIL -L

     When the document list appears, currently empty, you can add a new
     document by selecting the empty entry.  The document list window will
     disappear, being replaced by the document record window.  Here you can
     enter 'MyDoc' against the 'Document' field.
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 5                    5 Aug 1996


         Next, to the text filename itself.  In NetMgr, you post the
     bulletin file using the EMPTYBOUNCE action, a command which is placed
     on the line beneath the mask.  For our document, it would look like
     this:

         Action EmptyBounce @myaka C:\BULLETIN\MYDOC.TXT
         Action Delete

     The second line is needed in order to remove the bulletin request
     message from the netmail area; otherwise NetMgr will continue to post
     the bulletin again and again, each time it is run.
         In FDInt, the bulletin filename is specified as part of the
     document record in the document manager, specifically the 'Path'
     field.  In InfoMail, the 'File' field in the document record window
     exists for a similar purpose.  You should enter C:\BULLETIN\MYDOC.TXT
     in the appropriate field.
         This is all that is actually necessary for the document record,
     but there are some extra features in each of the programs which you
     might like to take advantage of.
         NetMgr and InfoMail contain features which allow documents to be
     updated by remote users.  This allows you to set up a document for a
     point or user who cannot run a document server themselves, or who
     would like users to have a faster turnaround time by hosting the
     document at their uplink's system.
         Assume that we want the document MyDoc to be updateable by the
     following method: The user posts a message to 'DocServ Update' at your
     system, with the document tag 'MyDoc' and a password (eg. 'Secret') on
     the subject line.  In NetMgr you would achieve this by adding the
     following mask and actions to your NETMGR.CFG file:

             Mask *, *, DocServ Update, @myaka, MyDoc Secret, *
             Action File C:\BULLETIN\MYDOC.TXT
             Action Delete

         In InfoMail you would get the same result by specifying Secret as
     the update password in the 'Password' field of the document record
     window; InfoMail takes any message to its normal request name, plus '
     Update', as a document update, and takes the password as the second
     word on the subject line.
         Needless to say, NetMgr is much more versatile in this respect, as
     you can specify any way you like of identifying document updates.  It
     has the disadvantage, though, that the message header is included in
     the updated document-- therefore the update password is quite useless.
     In this case, you could utilise the first two fields of the document
     mask to limit updates to a single user, and do away with the password.
         As another feature, both FDInt and InfoMail create document lists.
     FDInt sends out a document list when the word 'List' is encountered on
     the subject line.  InfoMail sends out a document list whenever a user
     requests a document which doesn't exist (including List, if you do not
     host a document of that name).
         There are a few details in the document record which concern the
     creation of document lists.  In FDInt the 'Invisible' field will
     prevent a document from being listed if set to 'Yes'.  The 'Listed'
     field in InfoMail has the opposite effect; setting it to 'No' prevents
     the document from being listed.  FDInt has another field,
     'Description', the value of which will be displayed alongside the
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 6                    5 Aug 1996


     document tag in a document list.

     Now the bulletins are fully set up as far as the document server
     software is concerned, but the most important part of the setup, the
     document file itself, is not yet present.
         To avoid taking over issue 1332 of FidoNews entirely, I will round
     off this week's article here.  Next week's article will deal with the
     writing of the bulletin itself, and will cover both the technical
     aspects of netmail bulletins and some non-technical hints on the art
     of bulletin writing.

     A GNU Fido?
     by Gregg Jennings, 1:331/109

     Our new Snooze Editor had asked (in FidoNews Vol. 13 Num. 29):

        Are there any reports from the FTSC [FidoNet Technical
        Standards Committee] on the state of our Standards?
        Updates to our practices? Presumably, software authors
        are still at it and things have changed in the last
        couple years, yes?

     David Rye, 1:3649/10, wrote an article in FidoNews Vol. 13 Num. 31,
     "A Call For Programmers Of A New Common BBS Interface", in which he
     summed up with the following:

        Anyone that has an interest in trying to develop new
        software with a published data format that will allow
        the point and click, graphic based BBS is more than
        welcome to contact me at my FidoNet address of 1:3649/10.

     His article was another ponderance about what can be done to improve
     FidoNet.  We have all heard many death knells before, and, as David,
     many people have (and will have) ideas about actually doing something.

     So perhaps now more ideas about things to do will be coming in.

     As these ideas are brought forth I would like people to ponder
     David's statement: "new software with a published data format".

     I do not think that a published data format alone will do what he
     and others may suggest to improve FidoNet.  To me any new
     developments in software must make the source code freely
     available to do some real good.

     We already HAVE published data formats.  We already HAVE software.
     What we NEED is source code.  Freely available source code.

     Implementing new programs and formats is a fairly long process.
     This implementation process is directly related to the number
     of programmers involved.  With one it is the slowest, with several
     it is faster, with everyone it may not necessarily be fastest
     though without some sort of coordination.

     Here is an example:

     One programmer writes a new program and distributes it to
     testers as an executable and documentation.  People use it and
     return ideas and bug reports.  The programmer makes changes and
     the loop continues.

     After a while the program is good enough for worldwide distribution.
     Then the programmer has a lifestyle change and leaves FidoNet and
     improvements can no longer be made.

     Some other programmer then takes over with a newer idea and the
     process repeats.  Sometimes this process takes years.  And we
     are stuck with a slowly improving, if improving at all, network.

     Even if the original programmer passes on the source code to someone
     else, or there are a few programmers involved, the process is still
     slow and can still stagnant.

     Here is another example:

     One programmer writes a new program and distributes it to testers
     as source.  People use it and return improvements and bug fixes.
     The programmer keeps track of this and keeps all coordinated during
     this process.

     After a while the program is good enough for worldwide distribution.
     No matter what the original programmer(s) do, as long as there is a
     way to coordinate improvements and bug fixes (like via an ECHO),
     there is continual and constant on going improvements and enhancements
     in the network for as long as there are people using it.


     This is an AMATEUR (hobbyist) NON-COMMERCIAL network.  I think we
     all agree on this.  Yes, even the original Fido/FidoNet software was
     shareware.  But this shareware process is what is holding back
     progress and growth.

     To me, the idea of, "here's a better way slash improvement slash
     enhancement slash cool thing -- but everyone has to gimmee 25 bucks
     to use it -- and if I die (or get pissed) too bad" is the biggest
     log in the current log-jam of progress within FidoNet.

     I propose that people developing software seriously think about
     distributing their code under the GNU GPL or Artistic License
     or some variation.  I am a software developer and I know that there
     are GigaBytes of source code throughout the world that is
     distributed freely.  Why should a hobbyist network not do this?

     Now I'm not saying that everyone should give up their current
     source code to everything that is now running FidoNet.  Many
     people worked long and hard and the want of a little bit of
     compensation is fine.  But before anyone thinks FidoNet can grow
     and improve, remember that without the availability of the source
     code, any growth and improvement may just be a spurt and nothing
     more.

     Iron Butterfly Member Disappears After Allegedly Working on
     Faster-Than-Light Communication - Is He In A Godda Da Vida?

     By Fredric Rice (frice@stbbs.com)
     The Skeptic Tank (818) 335-9601

     Originally appeared in:
     Skeptic Magazine, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1996.


     Here's a story that is so fragmented, so contradictory, so strange
     and bizarre I eventually had to tape all the bits and pieces of the
     story to my office walls to try to create some kind of a big picture.

     The story is growing and I can't help but think of the possibility
     that all of this information on the wall will eventually form the
     basis of a legend among must-believers;  a legend not quite as
     powerful as the Kennedy assanation conspiracy, true, yet a legend
     which should last for decades -- if not forever among believers.

     I'm going to offer you what I've been able to learn about this story
     as well as my own conjectures.

     Philip Taylor Kramer, one-time bassist for the rock group Iron
     Butterfly, disappeared on February 12'th, 1996, and hasn't been seen
     or heard from since.  Among the computer networks, news of his
     disappearance created only a minor flurry of comments by rock music
     fans yet for the most part his disappearance remained of little
     interest.  Until, that is, the rumors came down from both reliable
     and dubious sources that Kramer was working on a faster-than-light
     communications system just before his disappearance.  In various
     paranormal and so-called "advanced science" discussion groups, the
     possibility that he had been abducted by a super secret agency of
     the United States, the Russians, or aliens from another planet
     began.  A dozen "real reasons" for his alleged abduction have risen
     to the top of the conjecture heap and all of them are, well,
     imaginative.

     I observed the growing rumors and the widening conspiracy yet I
     didn't think much of it -- until KTLA News here in Los Angeles ran a
     short five minute report on his disappearance and confirmed that
     Kramer had indeed been working on a faster-than-light communications
     system.  KTLA reported that Representative James A. Traficant Jr. of
     Ohio was concerned about Kramer's disappearance due to the fact that
     Kramer held nuclear-oriented security clearances tied to the MX
     Missile project and due to the type of mathematical research Kramer
     was working on.

     Though several tabloid papers covered this strange story, eventually
     reliable sources started to investigate and report.  On May 5'th, the
     San Diego Union Tribune ran a lengthy story covering the
     disappearance.  As I had expected, the story also covered the growing
     claims of conspiracy and possible abduction by mysterious agencies.
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 9                    5 Aug 1996


     Ron Bushy, Iron Butterfly's co-founder, was supposed to have been
     working with Kramer to schedule an Iron Butterfly reunion tour at the
     time of his disappearance.  When the Union Tribune talked with Bushy
     about Kramer's disappearance, Bushy said "I honestly believe that he
     has been abducted by our government or an agency that is part of it
     or maybe a foreign government or a company."  [Reference 1]

     The reason for this suggestion was the fact that just days before
     his disappeared, Kramer and his father believed they had worked out
     a mathematical breakthrough which would allow the nearly
     instantaneous transmission of matter which would also revolutionize
     the communications industry.  "We're talking 'Beam me up Scotty'
     time,"  Bushy said.

     The research deals with a mathematical representation describing
     faster-than-light communication employing gravitational waves and
     magnetic particles.  Current research on the detection of gravity
     waves consists of hugely massive aluminum or niobium cylinders,
     sitting inside of superconducting tubs of liquid nitrogen deep
     underground, and the only events capable of producing gravity waves
     of a high enough intensity to be detected by such devices is a
     supernova, the collapse of a black hole, or the creation of the
     universe.  Contemporary research also suggests that using the Earth
     itself in conjunction with a distant spacecraft might also be used
     to detect these extremely weak waves.  [reference 2]  How such a
     technology can be used to transmit matter or communicate over any
     distance instantaneously hasn't been covered in any of the articles
     I've found and nothing in any faster-than-light conjecture books I
     have on hand talk about it.

     The headlines of some of the articles I've found are kind of
     interesting and guarantee to provoke the purchase of the publication.
     "Alien Abductions?  Two Rockers Lost in Space" is a story in a
     publication by an organization called "Addicted To Noise" -- ATN --
     which covered the disappearance of Richey Edwards and Philip
     Kramer -- two rock stars who share a great many similarities in
     their disappearances.

     Many web pages on Internet which offer comment on Kramer's
     disappearance also carry attention-grabbing titles and offer
     mysterious conjectures.  Several comment upon how the story of
     Kramer's disappearance is worthy of something one expects to see on
     "The X-Files," the FOX Network's very popular science fiction
     series.  Some speculate upon the meaning of the title and words of
     Iron Butterfly's highly successful song "In a godda da vida," the
     meaning of which is widely known among music fans as being a
     drunkenly slurred reference to the Christian "Garden of Eden" myth.
     Even KTLA's News anchor mistakenly stated that the song's contents
     and title remains a mystery.  If mankind can learn the "true
     meaning" of Iron Butterfly's most famous song, several New Agers
     have suggested, we'll find out what "really happened" to Philip
     Kramer.

     Some of the newspaper accounts conflict slightly with others.
     Various report that Kramer either did or did not make an
     appointment to pick up an associate at the Los Angeles Airport
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 10                   5 Aug 1996


     yet a $3.00 bill for 45 minutes of LAX parking was received by the
     Kramer residence 10 days after his disappearance containing a
     receipt with Kramer's IOU written on it.  Kramer, it seems, didn't
     have the cash on hand for parking or -- it is considered by some --
     he didn't wish to waste three dollars on parking knowing in advance
     that he was going to disappear and wanted to save his money.  Being
     a computer executive, Kramer would have known how easily credit
     cards and checking account transactions can be tracked and, if one
     wishes to go underground, hanging onto three dollars when one can
     write an IOU instead makes good sense.

     What's interesting is that Kramer _didn't_ pick up his associate.
     Something must have happened to him at the airport while he was
     waiting.  It seems that he went to the airport parking lot,
     receiving a parking stub, and started waiting in the arrival
     terminal for his associate to arrive.  Sometime during his wait,
     something prompted him to simply walk back to his green van, leave
     an IOU for his 45 minutes of parking, then drive off into oblivion.
     As he was driving away, he made a series of strange telephone calls
     to friends and family expressing his love.  It seems that the last
     call he made was to 911, "This is a Philip Taylor Kramer and I'm
     going to kill myself."

     I have asked myself, if a man is going to kill himself, why would he
     leave an IOU for three dollars unless he seriously just didn't have
     it on him?  A successful computer executive, I would think, would
     always have at least a small amount of cash.  If Kramer was intent
     upon making himself disappear, planting the suggestion that he was
     going to kill himself might have been an attempt to make the
     police who would later investigate his disappearance suppose that he
     was successful.  Kramer's wife also might not stand to get legal
     issues resolved until years after Kramer's disappearance made him
     legally dead so the claim of suicide might also have been out of a
     desire to help his wife.  His van hasn't been found.  If he did kill
     himself, his van might have been stolen and stripped down just hours
     or days after his suicide.  At this point, all anyone seems to be
     doing is employing conjecture, myself included.

     What is in agreement is that Kramer's mental stability was slipping.
     Just days before he disappeared, he stated that the Earth was going
     to end due to a supernova; that his father, a Professor of
     engineering at Youngstown University in Ohio, was really a god; that
     Jennifer, his wife, was really Mother Earth.  As they were looking
     for a new home several days before his disappearance, he told his
     wife that he was frightened that people were going to come for him.
     "Honey, we're going to have to live behind walls.  Honey, people are
     going to want to get at me."

     Perhaps Kramer actually believed that he had stumbled upon an
     astounding breakthrough.  The paranoia expressed tends to make me
     think that perhaps Philip Kramer disappeared to try to protect his
     wife and family from what he believed were dangerous government
     agencies who would eventually come after him after news of his
     breakthrough became known to them.  That leads me to think that, if
     he is still alive and simply in hiding, he will eventually resurface
     and perhaps try to either start a laboratory of his own to develope
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 11                   5 Aug 1996


     his breakthrough else find a laboratory he feels he can trust and
     sign on with them.

     For us skeptics, though, what might be more interesting was Kramer's
     growing involvement and belief in New Age mysticism.  The Union
     Tribune reported that Kramer had read "The Celestine Prophecy" -- a
     best-selling book about a middle aged man who sets out to find the
     "nine insights" of life.  Kramer asked his wife to only eat "colors
     of the spectrum," asking that she not wear black clothes or eat meat.
     This book also factors greatly in must-believers' conjectures among
     the computer networks.  Perhaps, some suggest, the mathematical
     breakthrough that Kramer and his father developed caused Kramer
     (and the van he was driving) to "vibrate" out of visibility, just as
     happens in the "Celestine Prophecy."  This inability to discern
     reality from fiction has manifested itself repeatedly since I started
     paying attention to this case.  Stories from popular fiction -- like
     "The X-Files," are being used to "explain" Kramer's disappearance.

     Kathy Kramer, Philip Kramer's sister, has been getting unsolicited
     letters from self-professed "psychics" pin-pointing her brother's
     location using map-dowsing -- the "psychic" lays out a map and
     suspends an object from a chain or string and, depending upon the
     movement of the object, one pretends to discern where the missing
     person or object is.  One such "lead" which came through the mail was
     from Austria and it stated that her brother was the victim of an
     accident yet was alive and being worshipped as a deity among the
     Pechanga Indians on a reservation outside of Los Angeles.  Kathy
     Kramer went to talk with the tribe's council yet they knew nothing
     about her missing brother.

     This brings us back to Representative James A. Traficant Jr.  He
     has twice asked for a federal investigation, citing Kramer's
     reported mathematical breakthrough and his work with the MX missile
     as cause for national security concerns.  Traficant states in his
     request to the FBI that it's not unlikely that the research Kramer
     was working on was such that a foreign power might have "abducted,
     apprehended, compromised, or somehow brainwashed" Kramer.  He even
     suggests that it's possible domestic agencies could use Kramer's
     "extraordinary knowledge for nefarious purposes."  The FBI, for its
     part, at first rejected the suggestion for an inquiry yet has
     reversed itself, stating "It's a known fact there are rouge nations
     like Iran working on nuclear weapons who could use someone with
     Taylor Kramer's knowledge to make long-range missiles.  Just because
     it's a remote possibility doesn't mean you shouldn't investigate it."

     Because of Traficant's request, some believers in either the alien
     abduction theory or the foreign/domestic government kidnapping theory
     have suggested that Traficant will be the next to disappear if he
     doesn't stop asking questions.

     The "fact" that Kramer has finally created a "Star Trek transporter"
     doesn't seem to be worthy of debate by some of the believers I've
     talked with, interestingly enough.  To "prove" the "undeniable fact"
     that Kramer successfully created a matter transmitter, I've been told
     that the electrostatic photocopier is a "case in point."  When I
     express my ignorance at how this proves Kramer developed a matter
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 12                   5 Aug 1996


     transporting technology, I'm usually ignored or told to "stop acting
     stupid."  Doubtless there are connections between these two amazingly
     useful technologies, yet I can't help but question how the obvious
     existence of photocopiers proves the existence of matter
     transmitters.  Perhaps the existence of one amazing machine is
     "proof" that any amazing machine one might dream up is possible.

     So what about faster-than-light communications?  Dr. Milton A.
     Rothman, former professor of physics at Trenton State College and
     former research physicist at the Princeton Plasma Physics
     Laboratory, covers the reasons why physicists don't expect to find
     undiscovered forces allowing anti-gravity devices, faster-than-light
     transportation and communication devices, and ESP, in his book
     "The Science Gap:  Dispelling the Myths and Understanding the
     Reality of Science."  Dr. Rothman states that for such things to be
     possible, a new particle responsible for carrying a new force would
     have to be discovered yet were such a particle to actually exist, it
     would have been inferred by experimentation long before now.
     Dr. Rothman states, "The conclusion to which we are forced --
     unsatisfactory as it might be to many -- is that we cannot depend
     upon the discovery of new and radically different kinds of forces in
     the future to help us go faster than light, to hold vehicles
     suspended in midair, to make objects move by directing thoughts at
     them, or to transmit messages telepathically.  We must make do with
     the forces that exist."  [Reference 3]

     Dr. Rothman also covers must-believer's arguments to the contrary
     when it is suggested that science has been wrong before and thus the
     possibility of faster-than-light star travel or communication is
     still possible.  (What New Agers disdainfully call "the conventional
     wisdom.")  "What makes this argument invalid is the fact that
     it is based upon a myth.  The idea that all theories are temporary is
     simply not true, even though it is believed by a great many people.
     The reason is, as we have shown, that we do know some things for a
     certainty."

     Several things are certain in Philip Kramer's case.  Kramer obviously
     believed that his mathematical breakthrough was going to put his life
     and the lives of his family in danger.  It's also certain that if
     Kramer ever surfaces, either dead or alive, the conspiracy theories
     and conjecture as to the "true story" will continue for a long, long
     time.

     Points thinking about FidoNet
     by Frederik Retsema, [2:280/901.35]

     Assume, you are new to FidoNet. You don't know anything particular
     about it, only that a friend of yours is (he calls it) point, and
     that he likes that. He shows you the way he gets his mail and what
     he and other people write.
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 15                   5 Aug 1996


     You like it, you become a point yourself and get interested in the
     way BBS-es (woeps... corrected... nodes) exchange mail. You listen
     to what the nodes tell, trying to understand why the situation in
     your part of FidoNet, Holland (woeps... corrected... region 28) is
     the way it is.

     And then... Something happens. You think you have a solution to the
     problems. A way to solve some unwanted situation. You put this very
     logical and simple plan into an echomailarea and... stand corrected
     because the situation was a little more difficult than you thought.

     This happened about four or five times to me. I still like it to
     think with people about the best way to solve problems in region
     28. I still like to think about advantages and disadvantages of
     some solutions to this situation.

     There is a problem, though.

     It appears to me that many discussions about FidoNet are in the
     sysop-only-areas. Areas that are not readable (not to be spoken
     about writable) for points. And that's a pitty, because most
     writers in the general available areas about FidoNet _can_ read
     these areas. And know more about the situation than I do. Which is
     a drawback when wanting to make usable suggestions for the given
     situation.

     Examples of wanted information that was/is not available for
     points are for example: the names of the candidates of NEC-elections
     in my net and the way these persons act upon eachother, information
     from the RC/REC about the situation in my region, pro's and con's of
     the ENC-flag in zone 2, decisions and other information of the
     echomaildistributors, etc.

     A solution to this problem would be to make sysop-areas read-only
     for points. In this way points would at least be able to read what
     the real problems of the current situation are. In this way the
     points can think about _real_ solutions to these problems which
     makes them more valuable to FidoNet. Why should a point not be able
     to find good solutions to the given FidoNet-problems ?

     Let's be honoust: if the information in these net- and region-
     sysop-areas were _that_ secret that points shouldn't know about
     them, you wouldn't tell the other x-hundred nodes who can read in it
     too. There's no reason to beleave that nodes are better persons than
     points or users are. And so there's no reason to beleave that
     points will mess up the situation more than some nodes do now
     already ;-).

     The last time I tried to gain access to a more or less node-only area
     was this winter. This discussion lasted 6 months, but some nodes just
     wanted to keep their privileges. Some of them just didn't see that
     points (and users) _are_ part of FidoNet and that the policy is just
     a little outdated on this point.

     Because, let's face it, FidoNet is _not_ defined by the nodelist, but
     FidoNet consists of private- and public mailservices to nodes, points
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 16                   5 Aug 1996


     and users. And why would people that are part of these mail-services
     not be a part of FidoNet ?!

     Some people just don't seem to see that the role of a node to a point
     is not really different to the role of a hub to a node or a host to
     a hub. For netmail only ZMH and the missing possibility of unrouted
     netmailrouting to the point or user are different, but that is
     something the point him/herself is choosing for. That's none of the
     business of the sender of whatever kind of message. For the way
     echomail of points and users are treated there are no differences at
     all.

     Well, I'll be corrected here. Because of some out-dated policy,
     because nodes want to keep their privileges, because some nodes do
     not trust points and/or users and think the only thing points and
     users want is free and fast net- and echomail on their costs, because
     they think it _does_ make a difference whether or not one can send
     mail without any system between sender and receiver or because they
     see some points with real big mouthes comming up and they try to do
     anything to annoy them, hoping them to leave FidoNet.

     After 6 months of discussing this subject I'll stop here and now.
     That is, as a point. I'm a node since last Friday. That seems for now
     the only possible way to gain access to the same information about
     FidoNet that FidoNet nodes have.

     Sad, but true...

     Hello All!

     A few days ago, some folks asked questions about the history of
     fidonet.  Well John Madill is working with Infinite Technologies and I
     got the story straight from him.    I re-post it here with his
     permission.

     Hey, John Madill was famous in San Jose about two weeks ago.  He made
     the front page of our Computing section in the San Jose Mercury News
     (it's nice to have a newspaper that has a whole section each week
     dedicated to Computing).  Anyway, it spoke of the inception of FidoNet
     but didn't give any specific information on where you could find out
     more.  How about it.

     Well, Scott, thanks for that nice intro! <g>  If it's the same article
     that appeared here (by Steve Snow, Knight Ridder), I could comment
     that I only had 1 small mention, and it basically stated that I was a
     "co-worker", but thanks for using up my 15 minutes of fame! <g>

     Back in the early 80's, I was working at a ComputerLand in Baltimore
     (not Boston ... Tom Jennings was living in San Francisco, but he was
     working for Phoenix Technologies in Boston.)  For those of you that
     care to remember, way back then there was a product that was
     introduced called the IBM PC ... which everyone wanted, but was in
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 18                   5 Aug 1996


     short supply.  As an alternative, we were trying very hard to sell DEC
     Rainbows, which weren't exactly IBM compatible.

     Since I had purchased a Rainbow myself (really *smart* move ... NOT),
     and had an interest in BBSes and telecommunications, I started
     searching for a BBS and Telecomm software for the DEC.  After visiting
     *many* BBSes and asking for help, I was beginning to fear that I'd
     have to write the stuff myself.  Fortunately, someone recommended that
     I call a board in SF called "Fido's BBS".

     Trivia:  The name Fido came from the mishmash of 68000 hardware that
     Tom was using to run the BBS on ... a real mongrel.  How many 68000
     systems did you ever hear of that had DOS as the operating system?
     Since Tom did implementations of DOS for Phoenix, he wrote a version
     for that system.

     Anyways ... I called Tom, we talked, and I found out that he actually
     did the original BIOS and DOS for the DEC Rainbow, and converted his
     comm programs (TelLink & MiniTel) to run on the DEC so he could port
     stuff over to the Rainbow.

     Now, I had a comm program.  One of the things that we decided to do
     was to convert Fido's BBS to run on the DEC.  Only one small problem:
     I had the DEC, and Tom didn't.  We were stuck ... had to work
     together.

     As a result of this, we ended up working together to enhance Fido, and
     spent a lot of time "Yelling at the Sysop" ... chatting thru the
     keyboards back and forth.  (This is NOT a recommended means of
     communicating via long distance, especially when we could have hung
     up, and called via voice.)

     After many gigantic telephone bills, we pretty much agreed that there
     *might* be a better way.  The problem was that I'd call his BBS to
     leave a message, and he'd see me there, so we'd chat ... or vice-
     versa.  Since the key was to deposit e-mail at another BBS, the
     solution seemed obvious.  Make Fido call the other Fido ... deliver
     mail, and hang up.

     There were only 2 Fidos at that time, Tom's and Mine, so although we
     figured we add in a couple of more, we didn't think we'd need much
     sophistication for addressing ... just add in a "FidoNet" message
     area, secure it, and assign node numbers.  Ask the user for the Node
     number, let the FidoNet module look up the phone number, and call off
     peak to save $.

     Well, word got around pretty fast, and nodes started springing up all
     over.  That's when we got interested in the routing ... allowing the
     creation of centralized hubs, and piggy backing mail to nodes within a
     local call to a single node thru that node.  We actually started
     dreaming one day of linking coast to coast only thru local phone
     calls!  (I wonder if you can do that today?)

     Tom took on the responsibility of dishing out the node numbers - this
     was the only way we could eliminate duplicates - an since we only
     allocated 3 positions for node numbers (nnn), soon we had a *big*
     FIDONEWS 13-32               Page 19                   5 Aug 1996


     problem.  We had close to 1000 nodes and growing.  Now what?  We took
     the opportunity to alter the Nodelist format so that we had regions
     and nodes within regions ... (region-node), divided the USA into
     regions, and appointed Sysops as "region leaders" who could give out
     node numbers and maintain the nodelist for that region.  These lists
     were then distributed, and merged together at each site by add-in
     nodelist generators.

     Another stage in development was when we went international.  We
     decided to add in Zones (Zone-Region-Node) *before* we ran out of
     Regions.

     This was pretty cool ... for a while ... and then IFNA got formed.
     The International FidoNet Association ... oh boy!  Enter politics.
     For those of you that have never been there, you really don't know
     what missed.

     Mandates that the entire structure, protocol, and operation be
     documented ... and distributed ... all from people that had nothing to
     do with the design, creation or maintenance of the FidoNet software.
     Another demand by IFNA was that no changes could be made to the
     FidoNet system without approval by the Technical committee.  A lot of
     really neat things came out of the members (not committees) ... like
     Echos, which are similar to Discussion lists (library@infinite and
     library@novell) and listservers on the internet.  We also saw the
     creation of the internet gateway to FidoNet.

     People got upset ... alternate nets got created (AlterNet, etc.), and
     people left.  What started as a grass-roots communications network
     grew rapidly out of control due to internal political struggles.

     I got disillusioned, and resigned from zone 1, region 2, node number
     2.

     (I still love e-mail, though! <g>)

     P.S.  Anyone out there know where Tom Jennings is?  Perhaps we need to
     get his expertise involved with MHS!

     Well that's it folks.   Hope it answers some questions.

                            HOT NEWS

                    THE FIRST FIDONET NEWSLETTER

             Well, it finally got done ... FidoNews, the FidoNet Users
     Group newsletter is real. It will be published once a week, possibly
     once every two weeks if it gets busy.

             There will be at least three regular "features": the node
     list, Fido list, and the route list. Hopefully there will be more
     interesting things later. Now you have a reason to get FidoNews.

             I, Tom Jennings, am apparently the editor. I do NOT wish to
     be editor; the last thing I need is something else to do.  See the
     HELP WANTED section. (Not kidding)

            We (ahem) are also looking for a publisher; I will do that
     for a while at least. A freebie outgoing host would be nice.  Not a
     short term problem, though, like finding an Editor in Chief is.

             *All* articles, etc are user submitted; anything and
     everything, as per usual Fidonet protocols (Which isn't saying much
     ..) Ideas, problems, questions, tips, programs, hardware, etc etc
     are all welcome. See the ARTICLE article.  (sic)

            Distribution is still up in the air; it will be mailed to at
     least six hosts across the country. For now, it is available on #1
     and #51. Possibly elsewhere in this thing you'll find an article on
     distribution.

             Oh yeah, I did mention that ... I hereby declare all Fido
     users and sysops members of the FidoNet Users Group.  Sounds pretty
     stupid, huh? Well ... If there are 100 Fido systems around the
     country, and each has at least 100 users, that's 10,000 people.  Any
     group that large has advantages, if nothing other than letters to
     the editor of your favorite magazine.  This is just a brainstorm at
     this point, but is something to keep in mind.

              To make this fake club at least appear real, I am trying to
     decide whether or not to have bumper stickers made. This will be 3
     3/4" X 8 1/2" white vinyl, with black artwork, will have the
     requisite doggie, the words "FidoNet Bulletin Board Network" and
     "Fido Node #" on it, and a place for a phone number, and blank
     space. These will cost $165.00 for 500 stickers, or about $230.00
     for 1000. I'll pay part of it ($40.00?) but no more; if I get
     promises to buy say $125.00's worth, I'll have them made, and sell
     them at cost.  (They cost about 34 cents each; plus 20 cents
     postage, plus envelopes, etc, call it a buck a piece.)

             The real reason for this is so I can have one, but I don't
     want to spend $165 for it!

                  ARTICLE SUBMISSION

             The format of this thing is totally ad hoc; please make
     recommendations as to formats, sections needed, liked, or hated,
     columns you'd like to see, or see removed, anything at all.  If you
     want to submit something regularly, we can start a column for you.

             You are ENCOURAGED to send things in for the newsletter.
     ANYTHING is fit for the newsletter, such as a description of your
     board, problems found, questions, jokes, fixes, horror stories about
     wrong FidoNet numbers, things for sale, etc etc etc.

                SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

             An article should have your name, node number (if
     applicable), followed by the text. Text can be any ASCII derivative;
     WordStar, soft paragraphs, 8th bit set, etc are all OK.

             Articles can be uploaded at either Fido #1 or #51, into the
     NEWS File Area, or by sending it by FidoNet. There is a convention
     for naming the files, so that the newsletter can be published
     automatically.

                  HOW THIS IS PUBLISHED

             This is a totally electronic newsletter; articles are
     written of course by users and sysops, but all other parts and
     procedures are machine generated.

             For each newsletter, the Editor (that's me folks) does the
     date and volume of the title page (tough job), and whatever
     editorial there may be.

             Articles are checked out for being readable (ie.  more or
     less English language), and bum copies (bad uploads, etc) are
     deleted.

             The lists generated by FidoNet Admin (St. Louis) such as the
     node list, Fido list, and the route list, come in via FidoNet during
     the week.

             On the day the newsletter is to be published, Fido #1 runs
     the text formatter (as a schedule) to produce the newsletter, using
     all the articles, the node and Fido lists.  The completed newsletter
     is then copied into the NEWS file area.  All of the article
     submissions are saved as last week's news, and deleted to make room
     for next weeks.

             Some canned messages are copied into Fido 1's mail area,
     which file attaches the newsletter to the distribution points.  This
     completes the FidoNews Newsletter publication.  FIDO SECURITY -Tom
     Jennings

             Fido is pretty secure, but there have been a few instances
     where callers gave themselves SYSOP privileges, and ran amok ...
     the cure is quite simple.

             NEVER NEVER NEVER have your "main" Fido directory available
     as a download or upload area. Always make sure there is no path that
     can reach your .BBS files. It is OK to have it as a SYSOP only area,
     never let it be accessed by NORMAL users.

             If it is available, all someone has to do is get a copy of
     SYSOP.EXE, run it, and make a USER.BBS with them as SYSOP privilege.
     After uploading this file, they call back in, with the new name, and
     bingo! they are in control.

             A nastier version of this is to download your current user
     list, use SYSOP.EXE to upgrade them (or two, or three ... in case
     you find one of them) the upload it.

             If this happens to you, delete USER.BBS *immediately*.  Fix
     it so that the Fido area is not available to users, and then you

     will be safe.

             Better do it quick, now that it's all documented here.

     Subj: FIDONEWS echo

     Hey Chris,

     First let me thank you for taking over the editing of FIDONEWS!  Your
     efforts and changes to our "rag" have made it, once again, something
     worth reading and with the "History" section, something worth saving!

     Now, to the point(s) of my message...

     Is the FIDONEWS echo going to be carried on Planet Connect?  If so,
     when?

     Also, this may be more than you want to do, but I thought it might be
     of use...

     The version of FIDONEWS is published with the "next page" printer
     control codes in place.  I would love to automate a process where the
     FIDONEWS is incorporated as a bulletin on my system, processing
     updates as they come in.  The control code causes a problem, though.
     I see 2 solutions, having a program to strip the code before posting
     it as a bulletin or dual versions of FIDONEWS.

     If you know how I could *easily* strip the page codes in a batch file
     automatically, then I'll try that. <g>

     Thanks again and keep up the excellent work!

     Kerry Grissett

     P.S.
     You may post this in FIDONEWS if you see fit.

     _____________________________________________________________________

     Where are all the *Cs?  Philip Dampiere (R13C) seems to have

     disappeared.  It's time for replacements.  Bob Satti doesn't seem
     inclined to do anything about the situation either, so how do we go
     about replacing him?

     In the meantime, I'm a node without a net.  The fellow who 'took over'
     as our N2623C insists on removing my node, just 'cos he don't like
     me'.  That's pretty much the expected in this region. I've been trying
     to resolve the situation, but the NC refuses to discuss the issue, no
     replies from the RC.  I've been given a temporary node # in another
     net, until such time as R13
     and South Jersey's net 2623 have *Cs that follow fidonet policy & do
     not delete nodes on their whim.

          The Top 5 Reasons Dogs Don't Use Computers

      20> Can't stick their heads out of Windows '95.

      13> Keep bruising noses trying to catch that MPEG frisbee.

      12> Not at all fooled by Chuckwagon Screen Saver.

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     Back in the dim time when I was NC135 in Miami_FL, we used to have an
     annual picnic for all the Sysops and Users. We had a barbecue and
     games related to computing like floppy disk throwing. One year, we
     even had a hard disk toss. [grin]

     So, the Question of the Week is:

     Do you have local FidoNet parties and what do you do there?

     Send your answers in as .ART submissions or Netmail or email to the
     addresses listed in the FidoNews Information section.

     Thanks.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     This column will once again become a regular feature of Fidonews.

     Upon suggestion from ARTSPEC.DOC, I'll write a smidge about myself:
     Hi. I'm Peter Popovich. I first read Fidonews around 1986. I actually
     used to print the darn thing out and read it thoroughly even though I
     wasn't running a Fido-compatible BBS at the time. I've only been a
     node for two years, but I do remember the "good old days".

     About two weeks ago, I opened my big mouth and agreed that reviving
     this column would be a good idea. The result: I got "volunteered" to
     write it. Critics beware: Our esteemed editor has a talent for
     turning suggestions for improvement into offers to write columns. ;-)

     When I accepted the inevitable, Chris forwarded me a copy of the most
     recent versions list -- 4 1/2 years old! Rather than tracking down
     authors for each of the hundreds of programs below, I figured I'd run
     the last list verbatim and use it as a starting point. Hopefully the
     rather limited readership will start making noises to authors and the
     authors will write in with updates. The added benefit is that it will
     help encourage active reading of the good ol' Snooze. ;-)

     I expect the format to change slightly in the coming weeks. For those
     packages I hear from authors for, I'm considering adding one Fidonet
     address for contact and one magic name for FREQ at that site --
     hopefully I can keep it down to one line per program:

     Program Name   Version S? Contact Name      Node        Magic Name
     ----------------------------------------------------------------
     NNNNNNNNNNNNNN VVVVVVV X  FFFFFFFFLLLLLLLL  X:XXXX/XXXX MMMMMMMM

     (S: Shareware, freeware, crippleware, etc. -- I'm still thinking
     about how best to classify this. I may modify the flags used in the
     old format as well.)

     One additional note: Articles submitted directly to the Fidonews
     Editor don't get forwarded to me; I don't see them until they're
     published. If you want your entry changed in a timely fashion, you
     are encouraged to send me notice of an update directly. I'll be happy
     to put blurbs about new versions in a leading section (no vaporware,
     please). As always, authors are encouraged to submit articles as
     well.

     Constructive criticism on format and procedure is welcome.


     Updates and suggestions should be sent to: Peter Popovich, 1:363/264
