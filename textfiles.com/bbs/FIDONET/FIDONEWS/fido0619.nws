     =================================================================


               It's time to speak out on Freedom of the Press

     As many of  you  have no doubt noticed, FidoNews isn't a rigidly
     controlled publication.  Its content often has little or nothing
     to do with the day-in,  day-out  nonsense  involved  in  being a
     member of FidoNet.  There are  articles  and discussions of some
     amazingly varied topics, reflecting the similarly  varied tastes
     of the five thousand member nodes of FidoNet.

     I  personally  believe  that it is  a  major  strength  of  this
     publication that any member of FidoNet is  allowed to contribute
     to a publication that is made available to every other member of
     FidoNet.  It is, quite literally, a free and  open  public forum
     in which any of us can share anything we consider important with
     anyone else.

     Of  course, there is a "down" side to this openness.   The  down
     side  is this:  not every issue of FidoNews will be of  interest
     to  everyone  in  FidoNet.  In some cases, there might be one or
     two issues  in  succession  that  in some individuals' opinions,
     would have been  better  off unpublished.  I'm sorry to disagree
     with those people, but this is the price that you pay for having
     your  own  turn  with FidoNews when YOU  want  it.    There  are
     sometimes  excesses,  but we'll gradually learn how to  minimize
     them without hurting the open policy.

     There  now appear to be  some  rumblings  in  the  coordinators'
     structure to the effect that FidoNews has  too  low of a "signal
     to  noise ratio" and that perhaps the  *C's  might  want  to  do
     something about  it.  This is apparently largely due to the fact
     that readership isn't  what  it  used  to be, and many NC's have
     been resisting the idea of carrying FidoNews, which is currently
     mandated by Fidonet Policy.

     I can't resist the temptation to suggest that indeed we have had
     the  same problem with the *C structure.  How  about  some  more
     signal  and  less  noise  from  them?    Whatever  happened, for
     example, to the promised WEEKLY update from the coordinators via
     the "RegComm -  Communications from RegCon" column?  Well, to be
     fair, it only claimed  to  be a "weekly" update in the January 2
     and January 9 columns.  The January 16 column billed itself as a
     "regular" column.  Of course, it  was  the  last  one submitted.
     When humans get that "regular" they usually need an enema.

     Look, maybe as  an individual you don't always like what appears
     in FidoNews.  But  this  is  YOUR  publication.  YOU decide what
     appears in it through YOUR  submissions.   If you don't like the
     signal to noise ratio, submit something with a high signal level
     and its presence in the  newsletter  will  help  keep that ratio
     closer to where you'd like it.

     At  this  point,  then,  FidoNews  seems  to have reached a very
     important cusp.  We need this open and widely distributed forum.
     The *C's want something that stays a bit closer to the center of
     things.  As yet  there has been no real concensus among the *C's
     on any course of action,  and  this means that the time is right
     for you to be heard on  this  issue.  If you agree that FidoNews
     should belong to ALL of us, then  you had damned well better get
     off your gluteus maximus and write a note  to  your  coordinator
     saying just that.

     Then, while you're in  a  writing  mood, how about submitting an
     article?

                              Echo "CHIPS" In
                             for disABLED User

          It  was  a cold day last February 16th in upstate New  York,
     otherwise known as the Adirondacks of New York  state,  USA.   It
     was  also a time when the RONDACK Echo was becoming more  active.
     You  know,  those wintery months when the hacks come in to  play,
     where it's warm.   For those in the more temperate regions of the
     world,  I'm talking about a "heat wave" where the temperature got
     up  to  zero farenheit.   An article in the newspaper about a  14
     year  old  boy  who  is  suffering  from  Ehlers-Danlos  Syndrome
     appears,  with a big picture of him sitting at his computer, with
     a smile as wide as his 13 inch screen.

          The article quotes his mother as saying that her son, Louis,
     gets  his kicks by using the computer to play games and  discover
     ways to make the computer work for him.  The article touched alot
     of people that day, including the users of the RONDACK Echo.

          Knowing the potential value echomail could be to Louis,  one
     of  the  Rondack'ers,  aka Brothers / Sisters found out  that  he
     didn't have a modem.   Well...  that day, a message was posted in
     the RONDACK Echo asking for volunteers to pitch in to purchase  a
     modem to give to the potential Rondack'r.   The response from the
     users was great and by the time midnight came around, on the same
     day, the modem was nearly half paid for.

          Arrangements had been made with the local Independent Living
     Center  to  act as recipient of donations for  the  modem.   This
     whole  experience was new to the local Independent Living  Center
     and  they  welcomed  the opportunity to help us  out  in  helping
     others  in  need.   Consequently,  they have established an  open
     account for the sole use of accumulating funds to be used in  the
     purchase  of  telecommunications  equipment  and  other  computer
     hardware  that  can be disbursed to persons within their  service
     area who can benefit from its use.  In addition, some of the echo
     participants  have offered their time and expertise in helping  a
     new user get setup, including training.

          The  whole experience also converted some "lurkers"  to  the
     official  "Un-lurker"  status of the echo.   It was good  to  see
     evidence of an echo working together to help someone.  A pleasant
     change from what you read in some echos.  We are not a charitable
     echo,  just  an echo with charitable users.   Not unlike  you,  I
     suspect.  Mmmm, is this a challenge?  Yes, why not?  I would love
     to  challenge  any  other "echo" to DO something  to  help  those
     around  you.   Let  the  public know about the good  things  that
     FidoNet is capable of,  and what its users are doing.  If you are
     already  involved in a project like this,  then please  share  it
     with us.  I'm sure we would benefit from your experience.

                          Policy4:  A Perspective

     The new version of FidoNet policy has been released for a vote by
     the coordinator structure, the results of which will be announced
     in the June 9 nodediff.  The new policy document has been
     discussed at length in the REGCON echomail conference, and
     represents my best attempt to capture the consensus of the
     Regional Coordinators who participate in that forum.  In this
     FidoNews article, I am expressing my impressions of the document,
     with some indication of how the consensus was reached.  I am but
     one of the contributors, but with perhaps a unique perspective.

     Rather than publishing the full text of the final draft of
     Policy4 in FidoNews, I will discuss the changes between what was
     published previously and the final version.  The full policy file
     will be distributed through the coordinator structure, and is
     available for file request from the RC's using the "magic name"
     of POLICY4.

     I want to emphasize that the opinions expressed in this article
     are my own.  If you have questions about Policy4, get a copy and
     read it.  It speaks rather well for itself.  I have not been
     given any authority to speak for the FidoNet coordinator
     structure, and I don't pretend to do so.


     Section 1.2 -- Organization, and Organization
     ------- ---    ------------- --- ------------

     The original Policy4 had two sections on each level of FidoNet.
     For example, there was a section describing a network, and
     another describing a network coordinator.  These have been
     consolidated; for example, there is now a single section which
     describes networks and network coordinators.  Virtually all the
     same words are still there, just organized differently.

     Top-Down Organization
     -------- ------------

     The summary of FidoNet organization, now section 1.2.8, was
     clarified.  Two exceptions to the strict top-down organization of
     FidoNet have been introduced by Policy4:  (1)  Decisions of the
     IC can be reversed by the Zone Coordinator Council, and (2)
     Decisions of a ZC can be reversed by a majority of the Regional
     Coordinators in that zone.

     This was done to provide a check-and-balance at the highest level
     of FidoNet.  In a sense, this mechanism has always existed; under
     Policy3 if a majority of the RC's decided not to support the ZC
     then the effect would be the same.  This procedure is formal in
     Policy4, with the RC's as a check on the actions of ZC's, and the
     ZC's as a check on the actions of the IC.  Hopefully, none of
     this will ever be invoked.
     FidoNews 6-19                Page 6                    8 May 1989


     The appeal process for standard policy complaints is not changed
     with Policy4.  If you complain to your NC, and don't like the
     decision, you still appeal to the RC.

     There have been vocal calls for democracy in FidoNet.  The
     changes which have been implemented are a step in that direction,
     although a smaller step than some would prefer.  The vast
     majority of FidoNet sysops are satisfied with the way that the
     network is organized, and if they are not then the procedure
     exists with Policy4 to get it changed.

     Geography
     ---------

     Policy4 is quite specific that network membership is based upon
     technical factors, not social factors.  This is entirely
     appropriate for a mail network, and this issue is one in which
     agreement was close to unanimous in the RC group.  Networks exist
     primarily for the good of FidoNet, not for the members of that
     particular network.  When the basic organization of FidoNet is
     compromised, then the integrity of the network is compromised.
     You don't get more basic than this.

     Excessively Annoying Behavior
     ----------- -------- --------

     The attempt to define annoying behavior which appeared in the
     initial draft was expanded in the final draft to include the
     distinction between annoying and EXCESSIVELY annoying.  The
     guidelines are still vague, as well they should be, but the
     intent was to reduce the quivering from new sysops who are afraid
     that they will be lynched if they make the smallest error.

     Commercial Use of FidoNet
     ---------- --- -- -------

     In order to protect the coordinator structure from potential
     lawsuits, and to clarify the fact that NC's are not generally
     thrilled with subsidizing commercial operations by forwarding
     commercial mail, specific prohibitions on the use of FidoNet for
     strictly commercial purposes have been added.  This is a
     difficult issue, as information interchange between vendors and
     users is an activity which benefits both, whereas strictly
     commercial use of a volunteer, amateur network is not
     appropriate.

     Protocol
     --------

     It was made clear that the minimum requirement for compatibility
     with FidoNet protocol as defined in the FTSC standard FTS-0001 is
     not optional.  More capability is fine, but basic FidoNet
     standard is required.

     EchoMail During ZMH
     -------- ------ ---
     FidoNews 6-19                Page 7                    8 May 1989


     In the sense that there was quite a bit of spirited discussion,
     this issue was the opposite of the geographic-network issue.  It
     was decided to go with the wording "Echomail should not be trans-
     ferred during ZMH."  Some RC's wanted the wording stronger; some
     wanted no prohibition at all.  The bottom line is simple -- if
     your coordinator can't get through to you during ZMH, chances are
     good that your nodelist entry will disappear.  Somehow, the risk
     doesn't seem worth the reward.

     Voice Telephone
     ----- ---------

     It was decided to require a voice telephone as a part of the
     information sent when requesting a node number.  In spite of a
     desire not to obligate the coordinator to use the voice number to
     contact the individual in the case of problems, the consensus was
     that requiring a voice telephone number was actually in the best
     interests of the person requesting a node number, and certainly
     was not unreasonable.  After all, why should we issue a node
     number with less information than we require to validate a user
     on our systems?

     Dual Majority
     ---- --------

     The dual majority idea (in which a majority of NC's and a
     separate majority of RC's is required to pass a policy change) is
     scrapped.  The requirement is now simply a majority of the votes
     cast.

     Language
     --------

     There are zero occurences of the words "he", "her", "his", and
     "hers" except in the case histories.

     General Comments
     ------- --------

     With obvious bias, I can say that I feel that Policy4 is a
     distinct improvement over Policy3, and should be adopted.  The
     changes from Policy3 are not dramatic, but we are overdue in
     bringing our policy document up to date with the way that FidoNet
     operates today.  It is perhaps unfortunate that we need such a
     large amount of verbiage to define things which should be
     obvious, but experience shows that this is indeed the case.

     I doubt that any one individual will agree 100% with everything
     in Policy4.  We had some spirited discussions in REGCON, and not
     everyone got everything they wanted.  I hope that the document
     does not look like it was written by committee, and that it will
     serve us as well as previous versions of FidoNet policy have
     served.

     I am not trying to take credit for Policy4.  In fact, this is the
     first time I have admitted in an open forum that I had anything
     at all to do with it.  It is sad that any time you do anything in
     FidoNet, you open yourself up to personal attack by persons who
     disagree with some aspect of what you've done.

     I would like to thank several other folks who made significant
     contributions to Policy4, but (a) I don't know all of them, and
     (b) I'm not sure that they would appreciate my mention of their
     name, because of the problem of hate mail.  I will, therefore,
     content myself with two specific names.  Policy4 obviously owes a
     great deal to Policy3, and Thom Henderson's work in that area is
     well known.  The first six drafts of Policy4 were coordinated by
     Harry Lee, so things were well under way when I took over the
     task.

     The real credit goes to the Regional Coordinators who participate
     in REGCON.  The development of Policy4 is a powerful illustration
     that it is possible to do useful work using echomail.  We had a
     couple of discussions on a voice conference facility, but the
     major part of the work was done in REGCON.  Zone 3 was repre-
     sented, but not zone 2, much to my disappointment.  I want to
     thank all the RC's who provided their insight; it really is a
     joint creation, and all I did was act as listener.

           Are you a Fidonet "BURNOUT". Find out with this quiz.
           Heres an example:

           14. When some jerk jumps into a conference half way
               through and calls you a "Lilly-Livered Two-Faced
               Low-Down Four-Flushing Side-Windin' Crocker-Crocker"
               do you..
               a. Ignore him
               b. Laugh and him and then Ignore him
               c. Send a reply through the conference calling him a
                  "Stupid Git-Faced Half-Baked Broken-Down Lump of
                   Slimey Gnu Vomit"

     WINEO (WINEO.ARC 1K)
           Clever little program. Place it anywhere on a hard disk
           and all the other files near it will try to move as far
           away from it as they can. Thus clearing vast amounts of
           disk space around the WINEO.YUK file. Exactly WHY you'd
           want to do this is beyond me!


     More Great New Hermitware on the way. Look for these exiting
     titles on a Bulletin Board near you....

     MIXIT.ARC    190K  Realistic Cake Mixing Simulation.
     NUKE_EM.ARC  489K  "Fun" Nuclear War Game.
     ROULETTE.ARC 120K  Just like Russian Roulette. Will rub out a

     "Oh no! I've been morfed!!")


     I hope  this  make  for  more  "colorful  communicating".   Just
     remember the quote from Alex Bell (no relationship to the famous
     Bell) "Anything that can  be  said  in  a few words, isn't worth
     saying and should be forgotten".    Don't  blame me I didn't say
     it.

     ParaNet Leads The Information Society!

     On October  14, 1988, 'UFO Cover-Up?  Live' made it's television
     debut.  During  the program callers were asked to vote by phone.
     Surprisingly, over 60% of  the  people  that  called in reported
     that they believe in the existence of UFOs.  Of that percentage,
     several people had reported that they had spotted a UFO.

     Although  the  UFOlogical community found that  program  to  be,
     generally,  in  bad  taste,  with  it's poor  treatment  of  the
     subject,  many  people  who  have  had  an  experience  find  it
     extremely  frustrating  when attempting to get information about
     the subject.

     ParaNet was founded three years ago by Jim Speiser to provide an
     electronic  outlet  for    the  latest  up  to  the  minute  UFO
     information,  sightings, investigative findings  and  any  other
     information  which is related to  the  phenomenon.    The  first
     ParaNet system was located in Phoenix, Arizona.  Jim worked hard
     to get factual information out to the  public  and  the users of
     ParaNet  have  grown  to  over  2000  worldwide.     Since  it's
     beginning,  ParaNet has grown to over 18 online systems  located
     throughout  the  United  States,  Canada, the United Kingdom and
     Australia.   All  ParaNet systems are on Fido and are accessible
     by computer and  modem.    The  systems  carry a wide variety of
     files,  over  5  megs,  that  detail  reports,  sightings,  news
     clippings and articles contributed to  ParaNet by users and well
     known  authors and investigators.  ParaNet  has  earned  a  high
     degree of respectability among top research people and published
     authors such as Dr.  Bruce Maccabee, a  Navy Physicist, and Phil
     Imbrogno,  author of Night Siege.  These and many  other  people
     use ParaNet and provide the users with an interface to  what  is
     currently  going  on in the community.  In addition, we are  now
     interfaced with UFO  Magazine  in  Los Angeles, California.  The
     publisher  and  editor,  Vicki   Cooper  maintains  an  echomail
     conference  called  Ask UFO which  allows  users  to  ask  Vicki
     questions  concerning  the  phenomenon.  Recently,  ParaNet  has
     started a SIG on Compuserve in the  ISSUES Forum area 7 which is
     designed to give them more accessibility to people  who  want to
     know what is going on.

     ParaNet has a goal of getting a BBS in  every  major city around
     the country.  We are looking for sysops who have  an interest in
     the  subject  and  the  paranormal  in  general.   We provide an
     exciting forum  and  welcome  serious  inquiries.    There is no
     obligation to joining  ParaNet,  nor  do you have to devote your
     system  to  it.   Michael  Corbin,  the  new  Administrator  and
     Director invite you to explore  the  world  of  ParaNet.  For an
     application, send net mail to Michael  Corbin  at  1:104/422 and
     request that an application and information packet  be  sent  to
     you.  This is your chance to become  part  of  one  of  the most
     exciting and informative news organizations to ever come to  the
     world of the electronic bulletin board system.

     The Veterinarian's Corner
     Excerpts from the ANIMED GroupMail Conference

     by Don Thomson, 1:102/1005

     (From an ongoing conversation in ANIMED):

       Well...

     I don't have really good news. "xxxx" has cancer of the lymph
     nodes, called lymphosarcoma.  He has a type called multicentric
     lymphosarcoma, which just basically means that all of his lymph
     nodes appear to be involved.  This is probably the most common
     type, and stage that this disease is diagnosed.  Sadly, there is
     no ultimate cure for this disease.  Ultimately this will kill
     him.  I'm sorry.

       On the positive side....

     The disease while incurable, can be brought into remission, that
     is completely free from apparent disease in about 85-90% of the
     cases in which chemotherapy is used.  In most cases the pets are
     happy and healthy in all respects during treatment - no
     vommiting, no hair loss, no diarrhea etc that the words
     chemotherapy always tends to bring to mind.    Remissions
     generally can be maintained for a period of between 3 months and
     30 months.  In terms of biological equivalents, 3 months of
     cancer remission in the dog is comparable to 15 months in man.
     An average lifespan of a dog with multicentric lymphosarcoma
     UNTREATED is 1-3 months.  Treated an average survival is 9-12
     months.  I have had one patient of mine do well for 1 1/2 years.
     On the other hand, I have had a few cases that did not respond to
     treatment at all, but like I said, we are able to induce
     remission in at least 85% of the patients treated.  There are
     other less aggressive treatments, mainly classified as
     'paliative', which slow the progress of the disease, but rarely,
     if ever, induce remission. These have few side effects, but
     generally are effective for less than 4-5 months.

     There are reported cases of prolonged remission greater than 3
     years, which we consider a 'cure', but these cases are rare.  The
     most successful case I know of was in remission for 3 years.

     The following  is the third in a series of four columns Fred Grosby
     (a federal government  employee, and a user on "The Falcon's Rock")
     has written.  He  deserves  all  the  credit  for  writing them.  I
     suggested that he upload them  to  my  system,  because  I  enjoyed
     reading them in our local Mensa  newsletter, Capital M.  I hope you
     enjoy reading them, too.  The archive  of all four is available for
     file request from 1:109/501 as BSOUTH.ZIP.

     Notes From Bureaucracy South (Part 3)
     By Fred Grosby, a user on 1:109/501

     Five  years ago, we got our first desktop  computers.    They  were
     weird-looking  things,  with  murky screens and clunky disk drives.
     They  came with graphics printers that could not be driven  by  any
     software known  to  humankind  and  the  most  incompatible  modems
     available.  Definitely not State Of The Art.  Still, they were what
     we had, so we found lots of useful things to do with them.

     Over the years, we  have  upgraded  those old clunkers to make them
     work better.  We have  added  hard  disk  drives  and  more memory.
     We've upgraded the software, too, replacing the semi-obsolete stuff
     that came with the hardware with  the  latest  upgrades.    We even
     found a way to get those incompatible  graphics  printers  to print
     graphics.  Still, even with all of our  upgrades,  our systems were
     still not State Of The Art.  So the  Computer HArdware and software
     Modernization  Project  (CHAMP)  task force was formed, and studies
     were conducted, and bids were let, and $8 million of your tax money
     was obligated, and  today  we  are proud users of our new, State Of
     The Art CHAMP micros.

     I know that this  stuff  is  State  Of The Art because starting six
     months before the first installment  showed up the CHAMP people put
     out a barrage of propaganda that  told  me  so.   Of course, I also
     have the evidence of my own eyes.    There  it is, printed right on
     the back of our new high-end monitors:   UL  Pending.    I've never
     seen that before.  Every piece of electronic equipment  that I have
     ever seen has been UL Listed.  These are UL  Pending.  Folks, these
     monitors  are  so  State  Of The Art that Underwriters Laboratories
     hasn't even  had time to approve them yet.  Still, I kind of worry.
     What if that  monitor  would have failed some critical Underwriters
     Laboratories test?  What if the thing blows up in my face?  I guess
     that there are some risks  involved in being on the cutting edge of
     technology.

     The video circuit board is also  State Of The Art.  That's what the
     guy who replaced the one in my computer told me.  Damn thing turned
     my monitor into a psychedelic display.  So  I  asked  him, if these
     things are State Of The Art, how come mine  only  lasted two weeks?
     Well, he said, this was a big job, and the contractor had delivered
     a lot of equipment, and with that much equipment you have to expect
     a failure or two.  Maybe he meant that when you use  State  Of  The
     Art,  UL  Pending  equipment,  you have to expect a failure or two.
     Well, with  all  due  respect  to  this  guy, no, I do not expect a
     failure or two.  The failures are never expected.

     The computer that  I  use  has failed three times, and twice it has
     FidoNews 6-19                Page 17                   8 May 1989


     been the fault of  the bocaboards.  Bocaboards are State Of The Art
     circuit boards that control the  input  and output ports for things
     like printers and modems.  What makes them State Of The Art is that
     you  set the configuration of the board  with  a  software  program
     instead of with little dip switches, so that  the  configuration of
     the board can be changed from within a program.  Well, that's OK, I
     guess, although why you would want to change ports in the middle of
     the  stream  is  beyond me.  The problem is, the settings  must  be
     maintained  in  the  bocaboard's  internal  memory  even  when  the
     computer is switched off.   That is done with batteries.  Batteries
     that  drain.   Batteries that  die,  with  regularity  and  without
     warning.  Arrrrrrgh!  The repair woman claims that the contacts lie
     at such an angle that they actually  short  out the batteries.  The
     last time she replaced the batteries on my bocaboards, she bent the
     contacts so that would not happen again.  Sure.

     The  bocaboards in my computer have developed a new  trick.    They
     just sort of go on strike.  I start the  computer.   No bocaboards.
     No ports.  No printer.  No modem.  No nothing.   I run the software
     program.  The software says that everything is working fine.  I run
     my application  again.    No problem.  A couple of days later, I go
     through it all again.  This happened the day after one of the CHAMP
     people came through and did a quality check on the computers in our
     office.  Quality check, indeed!

     Not only are our CHAMP  micros  State  Of  The  Art,  they are User
     Friendly.  This means that the  systems  came  to us all set up and
     ready to go, with a swell menu  system  that fires up your software
     at the push of a key.  Well,  they  did  forget  a couple of little
     things.    Like  setting  the  communications  software to use  the
     correct  serial  port.  Or setting the new word processor  to  work
     with the new printers.  Or giving us the manuals so we could figure
     out  how to do it ourselves.  I guess that when a  system  is  User
     Friendly you don't need manuals.

     We also got some new word processing software that is both State Of
     The  Art  and  User  Friendly.  It will do all sorts of neat stuff,
     most of  which  we  have  no use for whatsoever.  Unfortunately, it
     will not do  something  that we really need it to do.  I guess that
     makes it, well, Nearly Perfect.  What Nearly Perfect will not do is
     Print Pause.  To accommodate  our archaic filing system, we need to
     print file information on the copies  of a document, but not on the
     original.  With our old word processing  software, you could put in
     a  print  pause  and  terminate  printing before the  original  got
     adulterated.    Nearly Perfect would not do this when  we  got  it.
     Panic  ensued.   After much consultation, the Nearly Perfect people
     came up  with  a  solution  that  involves  hitting  a function key
     combination, going into  a  menu,  saying you want to print, saying
     what you want to  print,  saying  how much of it you want to print,
     and then telling the thing  to  start  printing, damnit!  For every
     document,  whether  you actually use Print  Pause  or  not.    User
     Friendly.

     As  if  all of this wasn't enough,  in  a  few  weeks,  or  months,
     or...well, one of these days they are going  to  hook  all  of  our
     computers  together into Local Area Networks, which is supposed  to
     FidoNews 6-19                Page 18                   8 May 1989


     be the ultimate in State Of The Art.  What  they are going to do is
     wire our computers up to central file servers.  Then they're  going
     to take all of the software off of our computers and put  it on the
     file servers, turning  our  nice,  State  Of The Art microcomputers
     into dumb remote terminals.    This doesn't sound like State Of The
     Art to me, but the CHAMP people know what they are doing, I guess.

     They sent me to a  training course on the Local Area Network.  They
     had sixteen computers hooked up to  file  server, and we got to try
     it  out.   I learned two things.    I  learned  that  when  sixteen
     terminals  all try to access the same software  all  at  once,  the
     whole system slows right down, to about the speed of one of our old
     clunkers.  And I learned that when the file server  crashes, nobody
     can get anything done.  And it is "when", not "if."  You  see,  our
     building has power problems, and occasionally we get a surge.  Now,
     all of our micros have surge protectors, so they just shrug it off.
     The file servers,  however,  have  State Of The Art uninterruptable
     power supplies.  That's  fine,  except  that when that power supply
     gets  hit with a surge,  it's  response  is  to  drop  all  of  the
     terminals  off the network and shut  the  file  server  down.    No
     server, no software, no work.

     The specter of having all of our software trapped in some dead file
     server  has  led to the formation of a  small  band  known  as  The
     Software Squirrels.  We are squirreling away copies of our software
     in  out-of-the-way  places,  against  the day when the file servers
     crap out.  Somebody suggested that this might violate some rule  or
     other,  but that is not the issue.  Survival is the issue,  and  we
     will do what we must.  I do not intend to be held hostage by a file
     server, State Of The Art or not.

     Back in  a  little  cubbyhole  between  two  cubicles is one of our
     original computers.   It  is  one  of the rarest of the breed, with
     it's color monitor and built-in hard disk.  All day, every day, for
     five years, that old clunker  turned out useful work of every sort.
     We don't use it for much  any  more,  but when we need it, it still
     gets the job done.  It has  the best monitor in the place, a simple
     print pause, and no batteries anywhere.  And  it  has  never broken
     down.  Not once.

     Soon enough, that old clunker will be gone.   A  CHAMP  micro  will
     take it's place, and some contractor will show up and take it away,
     to be sold for scrap.  I'll be sorry to see  it  go.  It has been a
     good  and loyal friend, and although the new computer that replaces
     it will be faster, it will not necessarily be better.  God knows it
     will not be  as  reliable.    But  it will be State Of The Art, and
     that's what counts here at Bureaucracy South.

                     A Public Service Announcement
                         Recognizing Our Roots

     FidoNet has come an awfully long way in a very short period
     of time.  Anymore, file requests, ARCmail, Zmodem mail
     transfers, crash mail capability, EchoMail, update requests,
     zones, points, multiple networks and so on are considered 'de
     rigueur.'

     It's important to recognize and realize our roots as a
     network.  When was the last time you ever unpacked a copy of
     Fido 11w and took a look?  Have you EVER examined a copy of
     Fido 11w?  Fido 11w, for those that don't know, was the last
     version of the Fido BBS (written by the venerable Tom
     Jennings) to be released for free non-commercial use.  If you
     take a look at Fido 11w, then compare its features to that of
     your sleek, modern mailer, you'll be truly amazed at what's
     happened to the network in just a couple of years.

     Fact is, compliance with the Fido Technical Standards
     Committee document FSC-0001 is still considered the "bare
     minimum" to be admitted to the network.  Fido 11w is a perfect
     example of a to-the-letter implementation of FSC-0001 - no
     more, no less.

     My printed copy of FSC-0001 is dated April 25, 1987, and
     though there are later revisions, the document hasn't changed
     a great deal.  The spec does not provide technical information
     on file requests, multiple zones, multiple networks, Zmodem
     mail transfers, SEAlink mail transfers, ARCmail, crash mail,
     update requests, EchoMail or any of the other niceties to
     which we've grown accustomed.  (Some of them are casually
     mentioned in the text, but not expanded upon on a technical
     level.)

     Although it's healthy and necessary for technology to grow,
     and it's nice for us to be here to see it all happen, it's
     necessary to recognize what it was that got us here.

     It's fun to talk about 3.8 liter V-6 supercharged engines
     under the hoods of our new sports cars with their digital
     dashes, trip computers, power windows and high-wattage car
     stereos.  But a complete appreciation for that technology
     cannot be had without knowledge of such history makers as the
     Ford Model T.

     And so it is with FidoNet.  We owe a lot to people like Thom
     Henderson, Jeff Rush, Wynn Wagner, Vince Perriello, Joaquim
     Homrighausen, Bob Hartman, and many, many others too numerous
     to mention.  But the fact of the matter is, if it weren't for
     Tom Jennings toying around with a new idea to economically
     keep in touch with friends by computer, we wouldn't all be
     here playing around with a nifty piece of technology that's
     within reach of so many.

     Appreciate your roots.  A message brought to you by your local

     =================================================================
                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================

     From:   Daniel Tobias of 380/7.0
     To:     Fidonews Editor of 1/1.0
     Subj:   My Submission in This Issue [Fidonews V. 6, Nr. 18]

     Thank  you  for  publishing  my  submission    regarding    drug
     legalization.  Since it has been nearly  two months since I sent
     it, I had feared it had run afoul  of  the new, tighter FidoNews
     policy,  or  had  been  lost  in the shuffle at  the  change  of
     editors.

     However,  in  the  interim  since  submission, I have changed my
     FidoNet  address, so those who try to contact me at the  address
     given  in  the  article  won't  get  through.  My new address is
     1:380/7.   My  new  system,  Dan's  Den,  is  reachable at (318)
     424-9260.  One  of the primary subjects of interest supported by
     this  system is libertarianism,  the  philosophy  of  individual
     liberty.

     Please  inform  your readers of  my  new  address  so  that  any
     responses to my article can be properly directed.

     Subj:   Galactic Hacker Party Announcement for FIDONEWS

                           GALACTIC HACKER PARTY
                       2nd, 3rd, 4th of August 1989
                       PARADISO, AMSTERDAM, HOLLAND

     During the  summer  of 1989 the world as we know it will go into
     overload.  An  interstellar  particle  stream  of hackers, phone
     phreaks, radioactivists and assorted  technological  subversives
     will be fusing their energies  into  a  media  melt-down  as the
     global village plugs into Amsterdam for  three electrifying days
     of information interchange and electronic capers.

     Aided  by the advanced communications technology to  which  they
     are accustomed, the hacker forces will discuss strategies,  play
     games,  and  generally  have  a  good  time.    Free  access  to
     permanently  open on-line facilities will enable them to keep in
     touch with home base -- wherever that is.

     Those  who  rightly  fear  the threat of information tyranny and
     want to  learn what they can do about it are urgently invited to
     interface in Amsterdam  in  August.  There will be much to learn
     from people who know.    Celebrity  guests with something to say
     will be present in body or electronic spirit.

     The  Force must be nurtured.    If  you  are  refused  transport
     because your laptop looks like a  bomb,  cut  off  behind  enemy
     lines, or unable to attend for any other reason, then join us on
     the  networks.   Other hacker groups are requested  to  organize
     similar  gatherings  to  coincide  with  ours.   We can  provide
     low-cost   international  communications  links    during    the
     conference.

     New Echo Mail Processor For QuickBBS

     The Mojave Group is pleased to announce the release of the Zzyzx
     Integrated Mail Processor for QuickBBS (ZMailQ).

     ZMail  is  a    replacement  for  echogen/qecho,  mailscan,  and
     mailtoss.  It is fully zone capable and is point aware.

     ZMail uses an intelligent  disk  an  memory management algorithm
     that allows it to unpack  large quantities in minimal disk space
     and  memory  overhead.    In testing  ZMail  has  been  able  to
     completely process a 3Mg mail packet in  1.7Mg  of  disk  space,
     while forwarding to 3 other systems.  If  ZMail  can not process
     an entire packet in one pass it can save  it's location and pick
     up  after  the  system  has  had a chance to send  some  of  the
     outbound messages.

     ZMail generates a log of all activity.

     ZMail  will  create  a  traffic report detailing what echo areas
     have received traffic and what the average daily message traffic
     is.

     ZMail will not  count  "Passthrough" areas against the 200 board
     limit of QuickBBS.

     ZMail will allow the  sysop  to  determine  how  many  duplicate
     signatures to keep.  Thus  reducing  the  amount  of  disk space
     required for the program.

     ZMail imports SEEN-BY and PATH lines.

     ZMail uses a Closest-Address Algorithim to determine the systems
     address for outbound mail.

     ZMail comes on a disk with a  printed  manual  and  tech support
     available.

     Currently  ZMailQ is selling for $10/per copy.   We  will  begin
     shipping  on  May  5th.    The  price for the  program  will  be
     increased  to  $20  on  May  19th.    To get your  copy  at  the
     introductory price please send a check or money order to:

     The Mojave Group
     7735 Osceola St.
     Westminster, CO  80030
