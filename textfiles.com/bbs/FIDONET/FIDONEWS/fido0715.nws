                      Fidocon '90 Information Update

     The Fidocon '90 Committee continues to work to  make  this year's
     convention  one  of  the  best  ever.  We have  already  received
     registrations  from as far away as Holland, and as close  as  our
     own backyard.

     One of our main goals  in planning the event was to allow Fidocon
     to be part of a family  vacation.  New Jersey has a great variety
     of  summertime  activities,  as  well  as the  proximity  of  the
     convention site to New York City.

     We have  gotten  many  requests for family plans, and we are more
     than happy to  accommodate!    Therefore,  the  following plan is
     added to the Fidocon  '90  schedule (Note:  These prices are ONLY
     in effect until 5/1/90):

     1) For a participant and spouse, the cost for BOTH will be
     $620.00. This includes conference registration for the
     registrant, and hotel and meals for both you and your spouse.

     2) For each child attending the conference (accompanied by either
     a plan A or the above spouse plan participant), add $75.00 to the
     cost. This will include hotel and meals.

     *** Discount Deadline Extended ***

     Because  of  some  confusion,  and problems associated with  "tax
     time", we have extended the deadline for discounted registration.
     Instead  of  the  deadline  being 4/1/90, we are extending it  to
     5/1/90.   Any registrations postmarked by midnight on May 1, 1990
     may register at the discounted rate.

     *** Deposits for Fidocon! ***

     As I  said  before, we are (sometimes painfully) aware that it is
     tax time.   If  you plan to attend the conference, but your funds
     are low right now,  don't fret!  We will accept a $100.00 deposit
     (nonrefundable) toward your registration.   This  will  lock  you
     into the discounted rate, and give  you until July 1, 1990 to pay
     the balance.This, of course, only applies to  plans  A  through F
     and the family plans.

     *** Any ideas? ***

     FidoNews 7-15                Page 2                    9 Apr 1990


     If you have any ideas on things you would like to see or do at
     the convention, drop us a note at 1/90. We WANT to hear from you!

     WELCOME TO FIDOCON OZ! 1990......


     FidoCon  Oz!    1990  is  the  First  Conference  of  Fidonet  in
     Australia, hosted this year in Melbourne.

     As this is the first such  conference,  the Fidocon Committee has
     decided not to have an overall theme to the event, but to cover a
     reasonably wide range of topics of interest which  can  hopefully
     be developed further in future FidoCons.

     From the conference programme, you will see that we have tried to
     assemble an array of first-class speakers, each an expert in  his
     own field ranging from software and hardware, through to computer
     fraud and viruses.

     With the  inclusion  of a panel discussion and workshops, we wish
     to encourage all registrants to participate and have their say on
     matters which are of  concern  to them.  Our hope is that through
     this discussion and the workshops, FidoNet as a whole can benefit
     into the future.

     We also hope that many of the issues raised during the conference
     will become the beginnings of positive ideas  which  can be acted
     upon and developed - and that future FidoCons  in  Australia  can
     then take these ideas, review them and then develop them further.

     We have also included several social functions and a small amount
     of free-time so that registrants from all over Australia can meet
     and get to know each other - to put real people to what may only,
     until now, have been disembodied names in echomail.

     Finally, this entire conference will be situated in a venue which
     could  not   be  better.    The  Victorian  headquarters  of  the
     Australian Institute of  Management  is  a first-class conference
     venue with all the necessary facilities within a modern building,
     located only minutes away from the city centre of Melbourne.

     The venue and the programme  are  excellent.  As a first, FidoCon
     Oz!  1990 will be a  milestone  in  the  history  of  FidoNet  in
     Australia.   Be part of what promises  to  be  a  most  memorable
     event!

     (A) DOES AUSTRALIA NEED AN A.F.N.A.?
         Chairman:- Simon Blears
         - with the demise of I.F.N.A., is there a need in Australia
         to create a organization with an awareness of our local
         situation?

     (B) HIGH SPEED MODEMS/MULTI-TASKING
         Chairman:- Gordon Castle
         - the emphasis is on doing more and doing it faster. Modems
         and multi-tasking are both getting more sophisticated.

     (C) MAILER SOFTWARE & MAIL MANAGEMENT
         Chairman:- Joaquim Homrighausen
         - a great opportunity for Sysops to meet and discuss items of
         interest with the author of FrontDoor and Tosscan himself.

     (D) OPUS VER 1.10 - EVALUATION & FEEDBACK
         Chairman:- Bill Bolton
         - the long awaited upgrade has arrived. Express your opinion,
         ask questions and exchange tips with others.

     (E) NEW/PROSPECTIVE SYSOPS
         Chairman:- Simon Walsh
         - thinking of starting a BBS? Find out exactly what is

     If you  intend  arranging  your own accomodation for FidoCon OZ!,
     then you can disregard this file.

     You will notice that the Registration Form allows you to indicate
     your preferences for accomodation.    If  you have indicated that
     you would like us to  arrange a billet for you, please understand
     that we CANNOT guarantee to find one.  So make sure that you have
     ALSO indicated your preferences for hotel/motel accomodation.

     Upon  receipt  of  your  completed  Registration  Form  and  full
     payment, we will make a booking for you  and we will confirm that
     booking    in   writing  when  we  acknowledge  receipt  of  your
     registration.

     If you have indicated on the Registration Form that you  wish  us
     to book TWIN/SHARE accomodation, then:-

     (a) if  you have also indicated the name of the person with  whom
         you wish  to  share, then the accomodation will NOT be booked
         until that other person ALSO registers.

     (b) if you have not indicated a name of anyone with whom you wish
         to share, then the FidoCon OZ!  Committee will "match up" the
         accomodation as registrations are received.

     PLEASE NOTE:  The organizers of  FIDOCON  OZ!   undertake to make
     and confirm accomodation ONLY.  Your registration  fee  does  NOT

     A View from the Bridge

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9003.30"

     When I was a young boy, I used to like to watch Star Trek (I
     still do, though I don't have as much time for it as I used to),
     and I was always impressed with the technological advances they
     demonstrated on the show.  Push a button, and food was instantly
     prepared.  They had little t.v.s that you could carry around
     your neck on a strap.  Other things.  I always wished I was born
     just 100 years into the future to see all these marvelous things
     and grow up in that technologically advanced civilization.  (Of
     course, I also wished that I'd been born 60 years before I was
     to witness the 'exciting times' of the early 20th century.)

     Just the other day, I was using my microwave oven.  As I used
     the touch-sensitive keypad, I reflected on how it wasn't long
     ago that these machines used dials, just like a kitchen timer.
     Then I realized that it wasn't long ago that we didn't even have
     microwave ovens.

     It came to me in a flash that I was born at just the RIGHT time.
     In my short lifetime, I've seen men land on the moon (I still
     have a laquered copy of the NY Daily News issue of that day), a
     president of the United States resign.  I've seen the effects of
     an oil gluttonous nation, and the development of nuclear power.
     I've seen the creation of digital watches, now the norm (and
     driving into Manhatten to buy one for $150.00 that used 24 hour
     time just before I joined the Air Force).  I've witnessed and
     participated in the birth of the personal (it used to be 'home')
     computer, and how its changed, and continues to change, our lives.

     Some things haven't changed too much.  Cars are still cars, they
     don't fly, aren't electric, and still pollute.  The phone,
     though finally starting to show some progress towards its
     potential as an information processing device, is still a phone.
     Even with the advancement of cellular technology, we still don't
     have Dick Tracy "2-way wrist tv's".

     Some things have gotten worse.  The US Space Program is at its
     worst point since the days of Sputnik.  If you have a few
     minutes, please write your congressman, and ask him to vote some
     life into NASA.

     The bottom line, however, is that it appears that I have lived
     the ancient chinese curse.  I truly was born in interesting times!

     Henry Clark
     124/6120


     It's Alive ( or is it ? ) --

     Did you ever see 'Rosemary's Baby' The Exhibit at the state
     fair.  It had that wonderful droning carny voice, on a
     continuous tape, blaring out of a bullhorn speaker...

     "Rose..mary's..baby.  Half..man, half..devil. And..It's..
     A..live, or..is..it?"  I never actually paid to see it, too
     much fun listening to the tape.

     I used to work on 6800 line controllers attached to PDPs.
     Tandem still uses them.  DEC has the same thing, only they use
     LSI/11s.  Now I have one for my PC. It's got a Hitachi 6309 ( 4
     Mhz ) and all the bell and whistle chips like DMAs, VIAs and of
     course double channel USRTs.  It's strappable as to PC port
     address, IRQ line and PC memory address.

     It has NO ROMs.  Normally a 6309 will RESET through address
     FFFE, but some fancy circuitry on this baby remaps that address
     down to 0FFE for 35 milliseconds.  0FFE happens to be the last
     two bytes of some dual addressable RAM that the PC can see
     starting at C400:0.  This gives the PC the opportunity to write
     boot strap code in there before resetting the 6309.

     Norton SI sees the memory and calls it 'extra ram'.  Contention
     ( ie.  both processors writing to the same byte ) is handled by
     the RAM chip itself.  I've got a ton of code for various line
     protocols that will run in the 6309.  Lot's of work here now,
     maybe a FOSSIL is in order.  3270 ? Nah.  T1 ? All right!


     OPUS 2.00 --

     Speaking of Opus, you surely have noticed the latest release,
     version 1.10.  I applaud all the development team for a job
     well done.  It would appear that the most noticeable work was
     performed on the user interfaces.  There's a new menu system
     and expanded privilege checking levels.  My sources tell me
     the next version will have something even better.

     What's the worst thing about running an Opus system ?  Right,
     those damn message files.  I, for one, run 8k clusters and
     those echo subdirectories get big, fast.  I know of several
     folks working on a MESSAGE FOSSIL, which will allow Opus to
     make generic message function calls, independent of the storage
     mechanism.  One guy might run a .msg file fossil and get
     basically what we have today.  Another might run a database
     fossil and have all the message data stored in a single huge
     file.

     FidoNews 7-15                Page 18                   9 Apr 1990


     The message fossil would handle calls like 'read next header',
     'change area' and 'read message body'.  The functions provided
     by fossils would be the same, the way they read and write
     messages might all be different.  You might run a Dbase message
     fossil, and I might run one too, but your's stores the message
     body as sets of 1K rows, and mine stores them line by line.

     I think the migration will be somewhat eased by a first release
     of a basic .msg fossil, such that your message readers and echo
     mail tosser/scanners will work as before.  After that, you
     would expect to see new fossils released as those utilities
     began to use the fossil functions.  Times are a changin'...


     Phantom City --

     Phantom City, The Double Round Trip, The Back Date : no, these
     are not new AIDS prevention techniques, they are ways to cheat
     the airlines and their stupid pricing policies.

     The Phantom City :  Dallas to San Francisco to Dallas.  You
     need 600 bucks.  Wait, Dal-SF-Dal-Kansas City is only 500.
     Why ? SF to Kansas City is cheaper ( builds market share in
     KC ). Pack light, carry your bags and get off for good in
     Dallas. It's against the rules, you save 100 bucks.

     The Double Round Trip : Chicago to Miami to Chicago.  You need
     to fly out Monday and return Friday.  Business travel, high
     traffic, 600 bucks.  Wait, Saturday to Friday, and Monday to
     Sunday total is 550.  Use the 2nd ticket first half, and 1st
     ticket second half.  Why ?  It's much cheaper to fly off days
     and stay across a Saturday. It's against the rules, you save 50
     bucks.

     The Back Date : Anywhere to Anywhere next week.  Too late for 2
     week advance booking.  Not really.  Hand written tickets have
     one week delayed computer entry leeway.  Most travel agents
     will do it.  If yours won't, another will.  It's against the
     rules, you can save a bunch.

     These techniques are not recommended.  You can be denied
     boarding if caught ( unless you raise a big stink and make up a
     plausible excuse ).  What they do point out is the idiocy of
     current pricing tactics by the airlines.  Airlines are also
     aware of these techniques, watch for a new rule limiting carry
     on bags to ONE and probably not a garment bag.


     Honey's New Computer --

     Hey, that Danish keyboard and print really did work.  Honey
     wants a computer for her desk.  I offered her my old ( circa
     1985 ) Compaq Portable 286, with the EGA external monitor.  I
     even threw in a laser printer.  She didn't byte.

     FidoNews 7-15                Page 19                   9 Apr 1990


     Seems she has been reading a little;  knows that old 286 is dog
     meat, VGA is where it's at, etc. ad nauseum.  She will take the
     hand-me-down if I don't replace it.  Otherwise, she wants the
     new one.

     Oh, and another 95 bucks per month for some kind of travel
     agent comm line to a reservation system.  Thanks a lot.  No,
     wait, maybe two new computers...  AH HA HA HA
