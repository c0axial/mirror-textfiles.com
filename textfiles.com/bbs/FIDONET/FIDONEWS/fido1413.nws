     =================================================================


     I inadvertently stirred up some panic last week with the news that
     1:13/10 was down and the FidoNet - Internet gate was closed. Cancel
     that panic. [grin]

     1:13/10 IS down but I have been informed of hundreds of alternates
     in action as we read. Burt Juda still operates the FidoNet DNS and
     although those linked to him for such transfers thru 1:13/10 are now
     traffickless, those linked to one of the other Gates should still be
     moving mail. I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't been a registered
     user of that particular linkage.

     There is an article down the pages that applies to the 1:13/10 ops
     ONLY! It has been updated since it was pre-published in several of
     the major Sysop Echos. The updated version will likewise appear in
     those Echos to clear up any excitement and misapprehension.

     On FidoNews, there is now a Letters to the Editor Section. It is the
     first Section that appears after the Editorial info areas. There you
     may rant or rail or wax poetic to me, as Editor, or the rest of
     FidoNet if you're not in the mood to send your stuff in as an article
     [.ART].

     The new extension for this area is: .LET and the first one appears in
     today's Issue at the suggestion of that writer. An updated ARTSPEC has
     already been hatched into the FIDONEWS and SDS SOFTDIST file echos as
     well as being copied into the FIDONEWS Echo and placed on the FidoNews
     webpage.

     [Just happened: The addition of the .LET file extension created a
      conflict for MAKENEWS so the extension for retractions has just been
      changed to .RTX and the ARTSPEC doc and .ZIP rehatched.]

     On another front, any news on the IC election?

     Letter to the Editor: Comments on Fidonews
     by Dave Aronson, Sysop of Air 'n Sun, 1:109/120.0

     Okay, Chris, you asked a while back for comments on the changes in
     Fidonews...  you got it.

     Firstly, something I've always disliked about Fidonews.  In fact, I
     have the same bone to pick with lots of shareware authors who do this
     in their .doc files.  This is an electronic publication, so WHY is it
     formatted for printing ON PAPER?  Gimme plain ASCII text, with no
     formfeeds or page numbering (tho LINE numbering could be useful!) or
     other junk that's utterly useless for viewing online.  Of all such
     bogosities, especially, NO LEFT MARGINS!!!  This thing is being
     shipped and stored all over the world, plus there are a gazillion
     trivial little programs out there to *add* a left margin (and even
     to break into pages and number the pages), so why make us ship and
     store all that useless empty space?  Restricting the RIGHT margin to
     column 70 is fine --that won't force fugly rewrap on most systems, and
     gives those who WANT to print it out, some room for a margin.  But
     forcing a LEFT margin on us all???  That might even force fugly rewrap
     on some BBS systems notorious for not liking text over 72 columns
     wide....

     Secondly, this huge conglomeration of stuff that's essentially the
     same from week to week.  Mostly, that's the lists, like of Fidonet
     compatible software or of web pages about Fidonet.  That could be far
     more efficiently replaced by a list of CHANGES from last week, and
     maybe a reference to where we could freq a list.  (Yes, FREQ, not
     ftp, or browse a @#$%^&* web page!)  Then there's the boilerplate junk
     at the end.  Come on, do we really need all that every week?  Again,
     just give us the bare bones and tell us how to get the whole megillah.
     To placate those whining "but freqing is sooooo expensive!", perhaps a
     "docserver" could be setup, whereby someone would email a given name
     at a given node, and be emailed back a copy of the document, all of
     which could take place via cheap netmail routing.  The latest version
     of NetMgr claims to be able to do this, and at the moment, I am trying
     it; send email to "docserv" (w/o quotes) at 1:109/120.0, with subject
     line including the word(s) "description", "echolist", "gunflyer",
     and/or "jewishflyer" (again, w/o quotes), to try it out --it should
     get you one emailed document back per such message.

     Thirdly, I dunno about you, but I suspect that the vast majority of
     even the regular readers have been skipping past the reposted Fidonet
     Technical Standards.  I sure have, aside from an occasional brief
     skimming of the first couple screens!  Stuff like that is why so many
     call it "da Snooze"!  Once again, a summary, plus an announcement of
     where such things could be freqed or docserved (or, <sigh>, ftped or
     browsed) would be a lot more efficient.  Perhaps instead if someone
     who has taken the time to read and understand this stuff could post a
     brief "review" of each of the standards in turn, including their
     significance to Fidonet's modern operation, IMHO that could be QUITE

     "newsworthy".

     Fourthly, I suggest a new "extension", .LET, specifically for "Letters
     to the Editor".

     Fifthly... where's all the smart folks, er, articles at?  B-)  Yeah,I
     know, I know... some more ASCII art is on the way!

     Sorry about that.
     I should have spread the word further than I did.

     13/10 as known and loved in the past is dead.

     During an equipment move, the equipment decided enough was enough and
     refused to restart when plugged back in.
     Sort of like a fatal heart attack.

     At the same time, Burt's personal machine also went south and didn't
     return.

     The gateway machine is/was owned by Burt's employer, and the decided
     to not replace the computer, so 13/10 had nothing to run on.

     The good news is that we are working on a replacement for the gateway
     and should have it back up in two or 3 weeks.
     It will not be physically located where it was, nor will Burt be
     running it, but it will be the gateway again for internet<>fidonet
     Email.
     He is, however, very involved in getting the gateway back in action

     The usegroups may become available in the future, but that is not
     certain.

     I will keep everyone up to date as things develop.

     No, but Burt called me voice when the crash happened, and I sent out a
     few messages about it.

     > 13/10 as known and loved in the past is dead.

      CB> what happens to fidonet.org mail in the meantime?

     Unfortunately all mail that went through the gateway is being
     returned.

     We are trying to get everything setup so that fidonet.org remains as
     an entity and get the mail flow back to normal.

     In the meantime, it is like a bridge collapse:  nothing gets from one
     side of the river to the other until the bridge is rebuilt.

     Steven Reinen, 107/700 has a dedicated connect to the internet and
     Burt is working with him to get everything moved over to his system.

     > I will keep everyone up to date as things develop.

     Why not?

     I can get to Burt voice, and I dug up Steven as a replacement for the
     gateway ** accidently, I must admit ** and I am the new NC here in net
     107.

     And being retired, I have the time to keep up with everything.

     You may publish this response, since I am not good at writing "formal"

     okay. i didn't see any. did you tell ZC1? he was unaware of it until i
     asked him last week.

     that explains a failure i had last week.

     thanks. a condensed version of the conversation will appear in
     FidoNews 1413 next Monday. an Echomail version will appear in FIDONEWS
     Echo today and will be cross-posted to several major Sysop Echos for
     information to all in the meantime.

     Impressed and Encouraged!
     By: Clay Tannacore  (1:372/136)

     I have just recently completed reading FIDONEWS (1412), dated 24 March
     97.  In a guest editorial by a FidoNet SysOp named Carl Hultay
     (1:259/546) I believe I detected the traits of the old "comrade in
     arms" attitude that at one time was prevalent in the FidoNet
     community.  It is possible that I misunderstood his rationalization,
     but I don't think so.  I positively think I have found someone within
     the association that literally cares about the imminent problems of
     FidoNet.  While I can not agree with his introspection regarding the
     forecast for FidoNet, I applaud his tenacity.  It is heart warming to
     hear (read) a fellow Fido-Nut (OOPS) SysOp, at least proclaim his
     convictions as to the forthcoming future of our brotherhood.

     I can relate to his predicaments concerning the "death of hardware",
     and the instinctive feeling of doom, when you are faced with the loss
     of a BBS.  I (like many thousands before me) have had to endure
     similar conditions, on a number of occasions.  I sympathize with him
     regarding the loss of users, especially due to financial obstacles,
     and especially due to the death of a family member (the computer, and
     accessories. . .[g] )  However, what disturbs me the most, is his
     reference to the "loss of users."  For this gentleman to believe that
     he will again be able to boast of a user base near one thousand (or
     maybe more) without admitting that MANY radical changes will have to
     be contrived in the way FidoNet is operated, is a very discouraging
     supposition.  At present there are just to many opposing forces in
     FidoNet, for a restoration to a position once held by this
     organization.  To many "I want" attitudes , as well as to many "I
     gotta' have more power" points of view.  Nothing will ever be the
     same, not in FidoNet's present mode.

     Mr. Hultay speaks of the "commercialism" associated with The Internet.
     What he has apparently dismissed in his attempt to disallow the
     thought of a FidoNet "doomsday", is that FidoNet is no longer an
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 11                  31 Mar 1997


     association completely dominated by hobbyist, but has partially
     fallen into The Internet  like, "Profit For Me" temperament.  Many,
     many bulletin boards systems are at the present time directly
     competitive with the Internet, in that they conclude that a "pay-for-
     use" system is the way to go.  "If the Internet can do it, then so
     can I" is something that has become an everyday behavior, a behavior
     which if it is not discontinued, will eventually bring down FidoNet.

     Mr. Hultay goes on to explain his feelings when his computer (hard
     drive) developed a *brain fart*, and pooped out.  He states that it
     was at that this in his life that, "I knew that I was a true SysOp.  I
     could not give up.  I *WANTED* my BBS." Mister, if that was your
     *TRUE* sentiment at the time.  I SALUTE YOU!  However, I believe my
     old professor (psychology 101) might take exception to that.  I tend
     to believe he would more than likely classify you as (in direct
     English) a Hilter-like-wannabe. . .[g]  Of course, you have to take
     into consideration that Professor Freedmen, pulled a Dr. Jack, and
     blew his own brains out about 10 years ago!  Another predominate trait
     that FidoNet SysOps seem to have acquired over the last eight or ten
     years is the *power for me* temperament.  For some reason there seems
     to be a growing number of SysOps that feel compelled to attain as much
     power, or influence (ability to intimidate) as possible over their
     users.  Why?  I have no idea, except to say what everyone else who has
     studied this formidable swing in human nature says, that it is a "sign
     of our times."  Of course, this is probably of bunch of horse hockey!
     Whatever the reason, it is not exclusive of SysOps alone within the
     FidoNet community.  We have an abundance of Network Coordinators with
     the same, or like, philosophy, not to leave out a number of Regional
     Coordinators who have become "Hooked On Power", and they think it
     "Works For Them."   Consequently we have a network that will become a
     little known fleck in history, if  "we" do not recognize the problems,
     and do something about it.

     Brothers, I beseech you to take a very close look at FidoNet as it is
     today.  Then try to visualize it five or ten years from now.  Look
     into the prospective for FidoNet, if present conditions prevail, and
     try to visualize it with all these problems confronted, and corrected.
     I'll tell you right now, I can see a FidoNet similar to the early
     years, when Tom Jennings and a few more (caring and dedicated) people
     produced a telecommunications system unequaled from its conception to
     the present day.  The Internet you say is bigger and has many more
     features.  Maybe!  Just keep in mind the *GRANDFATHER* who led the
     way for The Internet, and is still *BIGGER* than that inception.
     FidoNet was the trailblazer for all the nets which subsequently
     evolved from it, and with the dedication of those who care about it.
     It will be again!  We can not allow the "me first" people who care for
     nothing but their own personal gratification to prevail.  We can not
     tolerate those who would bring nothing but hopelessness within the
     net, to remain.  These people *must* be identified by those who care,
     and be weeded out.

     By now, most of you people are sick and tired of hearing (reading) me
     complain about what is faulty with FidoNet.  Some would even like to
     *see* me get off the pot, and make some useful suggestions for the
     betterment of it.  So would I!  I could sit hear on my duff, day in
     and day out spreading my philosophy and criticisms.  Chastising the
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 12                  31 Mar 1997


     *C structure, the SysOps, and most of all, that piece of garbage that
     is referred to as POLICY 4.  I could do all that, and never add to the
     prosperousness of the Net.  The trouble is, *I* could do all these
     things, but nothing would be gained.  NOTHING at all!  Nothing that
     is, without *Y*O*U* making a contribution.  I (we) need input of
     everyone who cares one tiny bit about the future of our association.
     You (the members) SysOps out there who have been sitting on your
     opinions, for all these many years, and you Regional Coordinators who
     *have* opinions for your regions upward movement.  The Network
     Coordinators, who *know* what is wrong within their individual
     regions, but are to damned worried about their positions as NC to
     voice those conceptions for fear of retaliation.  Those users out
     there who read FIDONEWS, who would like to be a part of FidoNet, but
     because of the antiquated rules, procedures and the general *cut
     throat* mentality that is so obviously prevalent, have been reluctant
     to join.  Now is the time to voice your opinions.  Join in this
     endeavor with those who truly care.  Let your voice be heard, by those
     who must *listen* if FidoNet is to have a reincarnation.  Remember,
     there is safety in numbers, and more importantly, a greater pool of
     intellect to draw upon.  With many voices, there comes many
     suggestions, and with those many suggestions comes many intelligent
     and significant recommendations which leads to a aggrandized
     membership, and a more equable association.

     If anyone out there has any hesitancy in believing that I intend to
     accelerate the demise of those who have been responsible for the
     shortcomings of FidoNet, let them be assured I fully intend to raise
     enough hell to either cause sufficient change in the way FidoNet
     operates, or find myself without a node number, again.

     If there are any inhabitants out there who consider themselves *real*
     FidoNet people, and would like to join in this crusade, by all means
     send me some mail (FidoNet, not Internet [gag]) with your suggestions.
     I am particularly interested in those who have suggestions pertaining
     to a *NEW* POLICY document.  Those who have any complaints about the
     monitory provisos dictated by EchoMail Coordinators.  Anyone who is
     infuriated with the multitude of Bulletin Boards (BBS) which indulge
     in the practice of charging users for access.  Anyone who has ever had
     (what you consider) an unfair decision rendered by your NC, or RC, or
     both, let me know.  Let *us* right a wrong that has been going on much
     to long.  Do you have any suggestions concerning the EchoMail Policies
     in the different Nets you have been associated with?  How about a
     *REAL* EchoMail POLICY for FidoNet, itself?  Any ideas on how to
     better the present procedures or policies?  Do you know of any person
     who is a part of the *C structure of FidoNet (also including SysOps)
     who have allowed his/her personal opinion of you (or someone else) to
     influence a rendering of a fair and impartial decision?  Have you (or
     anyone you know) ever been denied a reasonable appeal process by
     anyone in the position to deny it (NC, RC, SysOp, ZC, et al).  These
     are all questions that must be taken under consideration when
     attempting to reestablish a network such as FidoNet.

     I realize with all the criticism I have expressed in this wonderful
     outlet (FIDONEWS - Thanks, Chris Baker) concerning FidoNet.  I have
     irritated the hell out of the *good-old-boy-network* who in all
     likelihood will now attempt the FidoNetSqueeze.  It may even work!
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 13                  31 Mar 1997


     But, who cares?  I've said my piece, expressed my opinions, got others
     to take a closer look at what is going on.  I have actually received a
     few positive responses to the articles printed in FIDONEWS, shocking
     isn't it?  Look folks, I'm not the only one with the desire to better
     this organization, there are many out there who would like to be proud
     of FidoNet, again.  Perhaps some of these people are worried about
     what sort of retribution would be forthcoming if they were to speak
     out, or maybe they are just being a little overly circumspect than is
     absolutely necessary.  Or perhaps their reluctance is justified in
     light of what has been a trend in FidoNet, of late.  Whatever the
     reason, I believe this open challenge and solicitation for help, just
     may instigate these people to finally stand up and have their
     convictions noted.

     These security bugs are really starting to bug me -- seriously!  IMHO,
     this one is very disturbing, as it has the very definite potential to
     compromise security for an entire network.

     I do apologize in advance that this message is lengthy, because it
     requires some technical explanation of what SMB is, and how it relates
     to the latest (and perhaps greatest) security problem.  I also
     included the Wired news site article (at the bottom of this message)
     that explains it in plainer language.

     THE SECURITY PROBLEM:  If you are running either Win95, Win97, or NT,
     and use either MS IE 3.xx, Netscape 3.xx, or Netscape Communicator
     4.0, there is now yet another bug (a whopping SIX security bugs for IE
     this month! and I think the second one for Netscape) THAT WILL SEND
     OUT YOUR WINDOWS LOGIN NAME AND PASSWORD TO A REMOTE SERVER which can
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 14                  31 Mar 1997


     capture it!  And for most network users, their Windows login name and
     password are also their network login name and password, which of
     course puts the entire network at risk for break-ins.  For example, a
     person's Win95 login name and password is often the same for their
     Novell Netware and MS Windows NT server.  Cute, huh?

     First, let me explain briefly what the SMB protocol is, because it is
     key to the security flaw -- then the rest of the message will make
     more sense.  I compiled the following information from several web
     sites that did a good job of describing it:

     It has to do with embedding a link (e.g., an image link) in the web
     page to an SMB server rather than the normal HTTP server.  SMB, which
     stands for Server Message Block, is a protocol for sharing files,
     printers, serial ports, and communications abstractions such as named
     pipes and mail slots between computers.  It is a higher level protocol
     which can be transported over TCP/IP, NetBEUI and IPX/SPX.  If TCP/IP
     or NetBEUI is in use, then the NetBIOS API is being used.  If SMB is
     used over TCP/IP or NetBEUI, then NetBIOS names must be used in a
     number of cases.  NetBIOS names are usually the name of the computer
     that is running NetBIOS.  (In many instances, the computer names are
     referenced by the "\\" prefix to designate a different computer on the
     network -- this is an important aspect of the security flaw -- read
     on.)

     For more info about SMB and its security problems, you can go to:

     http://samba.anu.edu.au/cifs/docs/what-is-smb.html    (Describes SMB)
     http://www.sur.fr.net/ftp/supports/96/netbios-3.html  (re: Security
     Problems)

     (I'm sure there are a lot of other great SMB sites too, but these were
     among the first two I found using Alta-Vista when researching this.)

     Okay, enough of the SMB explanations.  Now that you know what SMB is,
     here's how the security flaw/bug works:

     In a web page, the webmaster can insert a link reference uses a
     combination of the "file://" URL command followed by the "\\"
     reference that Win 95, 97, and NT use to refer to and access other
     servers (as I mentioned above).  Then, because your browser sees this
     link (e.g., an image tag) as a reference to a different server (the
     SMB server), Win95, 97 & NT automatically send your Windows login name
     and password to the remote server to log in (the "\\" makes it think
     that the other PC is part of its network), ALL BEHIND THE SCENES, so
     the user has no idea whatsoever that this is happening!!!  Basically
     the guy discovered this security flaw by combining different things
     that were in the previous IE bug reports this month -- very clever.
     The article below tells network administrators how to block this on
     their firewall setup, to block access to the SMB server.  It appears
     that the rest of us using Win 95, 97 and NT are just out of luck for
     now.

     The article posted at the end of this message is from the Wired news
     site, at:

     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 15                  31 Mar 1997


     http://www.wired.com/news/technology/story/2702.html

     The web site referred to in the article is authored by the guy who
     discovered the bug, and gives a lot more info about it, as well as
     demonstrating the bug in real time to you.

     WARNING!!! IF YOU GO TO THE FOLLOWING WEB SITE USING WIN95, 97, OR NT,
     IT *WILL* MOST LIKELY CAPTURE YOUR LOGIN NAME AND PASSWORD, AND THE
     SITE POSTS A TABLE SHOWING THE LAST 10 CAPTURED LOGIN NAMES, PASSWORDS
     (but only shows the beginning of the password for your protection),
     HOST NAME AND IP ADDRESS, SO YOU CAN SEE IF YOU ARE VULNERABLE, AND
     THEN TELLS YOU TO CHANGE YOUR LOGIN AND PASSWORD ASAP TO PROTECT
     YOURSELF!  I used my standalone Win 3.1 laptop with no problem (hey,
     right now Win 3.1 apps are more secure on the Net, IMHO -- so don't
     knock it <g>).  BTW, the "bug" web site mentions that "Notice that the
     most common account & password I get is 'Administrator' ".  So it's
     capturing administrator logins and passwords as network administrators
     hear about the bug and visit his site -- full access, good grief.  If
     any of you would like to read the full text from the site without
     going there, send me an e-mail and I will send it to you, since my Win
     3.1 laptop system does not support that security flaw.

     http://www.wired.com/news/technology/story/2702.html
                Another Windows Networking Bug Discovered by Toxic

                11:56am  21.Mar.97.PST Yet another security-related browser
     bug has been uncovered, the sixth to affect Microsoft Internet
     Explorer this month. This latest bug, in the file sharing protocol
     of both Windows 95 and Windows NT, allows someone to set up a rogue
     Web site that obtains your username and Windows network password.

                Windows NT users of all versions of Microsoft Internet
     Explorer and many versions of Netscape are vulnerable to this attack
     - which is not addressed by Microsoft's 12 March browser fix.

                As with the rash of recent Internet Explorer security bugs
     and holes, Aaron Spangler, the bug's discoverer, has created a
     Web page to demonstrate the vulnerability.

                "My bug is twofold," said Spangler, a systems administrator
     at the University of Washington. "It takes advantage of two exploits.
     The elegance lies in putting the two together to come up with grabbing
     people's passwords. That's a pretty scary thing," he said. Spangler
     has captured more than 940 passwords, many from administrator accounts
     using weak passwords such as "horse" and "dog."

                Spangler said both bugs have affected IE for some time. He
     first tried contacting both Microsoft and Netscape on 13 March, and
     created his Web page the next day. He says he received a note from
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 16                  31 Mar 1997


     Microsoft saying that they were working on the bug.  "But every time I
     send any more email they don't respond," he says.  "They're completely
     ignoring me. It's frustrating."

                Netscape sent an auto-generated response to his email, but
     has not contacted him since, he said.

                The attack relies on the file structure of the Windows
     operating system, and the behavior of a browser when it encounters a
     URL that begins with the "file://" scheme. When Windows sees a file:
     URL, it attempts to read the specified file from the user's local hard
     disk. For example, file://C:\temp\foo.html will open C:\temp\foo.html
     from your local hard drive.

                However, the Windows file system is designed such that
     filenames that begin with a double backslash actually reside on
     another machine. If you take these two factors and combine them, you
     realize that the file in the example above could also be referenced as
     a URL, as in file://\\bar.wired.com\temp\foo.html.

                When a user attempts to access a file through this method,
     his Windows machine will connect to the specified server -
     bar.wired.com in the above example. The server will then attempt to
     authenticate the user by asking for a username and password. Windows
     will automatically send the information entered by a user when they
     logged into their own Windows network, which is what most users do
     when they first boot their machine. Windows will only prompt the user
     for a password if the values entered at startup are not accepted by
     the remote server.

                Spangler's demo page contains an "<IMG>" tag that
     references an image stored on his SMB server instead of his Web
     server.  When you load his page, your browser will attempt to load
     the image. It will connect to Spangler's Windows file server, and when
     requested, automatically send your username and password. You will
     receive the image, and Spangler will receive your password. Everything
     appears perfectly normal to the Web surfer.

                Spangler says the fix is really trivial. "All [Netscape and
     Microsoft] have to do is make it so their Web browser will not accept
     URLs that come from an SMB server. It's a little statement that they
     can put in their code," he said.

                Network administrators can protect users on their network
     by blocking TCP port 139 on their outgoing firewall (port 139 is the
     SMB port). An outgoing firewall configured in this manner will not
     allow traffic from a protected network to reach port 139 of any
     machine on an outside, untrusted network, and will thus thwart this
     kind of attack.

                "Microsoft is checking into all bug reports and taking them
     very seriously," said a Microsoft spokesperson. "If it is something
     [engineers] need to change, they will do something about it."

                Netscape could not be reached for comment.

     Purpose:
     --------

     This document is a proposal for a FIDO standard.

     This document describes a method of allowing international and other
     non-standard ASCII characters to be transferred via a network and
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 19                  31 Mar 1997


     interpreted by the receiving systems.  It also allows for expansion to
     multiple character sets and character sets that require more than one
     byte storage space per character.  Further the capability to include
     style and font changes are part of this proposal.

     This proposal is based on the ISO standard character sets.  It defines
     a mechanism to switch between all of the defined ISO sets.  Further it
     defines switches that allow style and font changes.  The FSC-0054
     standard also coexists with the extensions of the ISO LATIN-1
     characters set as defined in FSC-0051.  FSC-0054 and FSC-0054 use the
     same identifier (CHRS: LATIN-1 2) to indicate the LATIN-1 character
     set.  FSC-0051 (draft 3 and above) defines the codes unused in LATIN-1
     for additional characters.  At present these are the numeric super and
     subscripts as well as Polish characters.

     History
     -------

     All in all the author is aware of 6 initial proposals for including
     additional characters in FIDO messages, most of them did not get the
     critical mass to achieve widespread use.  Three of them actually
     managed to get FSC numbers.  FSC-0054 and FSC-0051 effectively merged
     as of this document.  FSC-0054 is backwardly compatible to FSC-0050.
     Another standard that was used in Denmark is no longer in discussion.

     The initial proposal was FSC-0050.  It had several drawbacks, most
     notably it was too limiting and it was based around a particular
     hardware platform.  Because of its implementation in Opus, FSC-0054
     tries to recognize the messages produced by that system.  There are
     several incompatible "flavors" of FSC-0050 floating around, so FSC-
     0054 can not always produce perfect results when translating FSC-0050
     messages.  Implementations that allow for FSC-0050 can use the same
     code for FSC-0054 but may need to generate different kludges and will
     need to be expanded a to make full use of the extra features.

     A second proposal FSC-0051 had the advantage of hardware independence
     but lacked (on its own) expandability as it only allows for roman
     characters (ie: western languages).  Because the FSC-0051 and FSC-0054
     methods both contain the LATIN-1 character set as the base set for
     western countries the authors agreed on a common identifier to allow
     the two systems to coexist.  FSC-0051 allows you to add Polish
     characters to the Latin-1 character set without necessitating
     compliance to FSC-0054 Level 3.  FSC-0051 is mainly used in Sweden.

     The system described in this document gives the maximum in capability
     without breaking the FIDO message format.  It allows hardware
     independence and internationalization of FIDO software.

     To further enhance the capabilities of FIDO beyond what is described
     here a new message document format must be defined.  The author
     suggests this be done in connection with a type-3 format and that the
     Open Document Architecture (ODA) be included as the standard for that
     format.  ODA is the agreed standard for commercial mail systems and is
     being implemented by X.400 messaging systems.  Conformance to that
     standard would allow transfer between FIDO and other nets without
     translation.  ODA contains formatted text as well as graphics and

     sound.

     Pros and Cons:
     --------------

     Any form of non standard ASCII extension to the present messages
     must respect the following criteria.

     It should:
       o  be simple
       o  be backwards compatible
       o  be expandable
       o  be transparent
       o  allow for multiple levels of support
       o  allow for translation to the least common denominator

     Earlier proposals had several problems:

       1) They inserted non ASCII characters in the PRESENT stream of
          messages.

       2) They did not allow for an easy to read "standard ASCII" represen-
          tation on areas that do not support their special encoding
          scheme.

       3) They increased the size of messages by a larger amount than is
          necessary.

       4) They were hardware dependant.

       5) The implementation sample were too slow to be effective (a minor
           point).

       6) They limited the possibilities.
          They only allowed for a limited amount of graphic or other
          special purpose characters.  They did not allow for character
          sets that require storage space that are larger than one byte per
          character.  They were not expandable.

     The advantages of the system proposed here are:

     It does not have any of the failings of the prior systems (points 1-
     5).

       1) It does not insert any non ASCII characters in the present
          stream of messages.

       2) It allows for an easy to read standard ASCII representation.

       3) It does not increase message size.  It only includes the charset
          kludge in messages that use non-ascii characters (e.g.: Kanji).

       4) The presented algorithm is efficient.

       5) The presented algorithm is efficient.

     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 21                  31 Mar 1997


       6) It support ALL international characters as well as graphic and
          other special characters.  It allows for character sets that
          require storage space that is greater than one byte per
          character.  It allows for future expansion.

       7) It allows for a simple method of converting non-standard
          characters to standard ASCII in present systems.

       8) It allows for character set coherence in message areas without
          double processing.

       9) It allows multiple levels of compliance.

       10) It concerns itself with gateway filtering of messages.

       11) The implementation allows non "charset kludge" aware programs
           to display and edit messages.

       12) It concerns itself with network representation as well as
           local storage.

     The present system:
     -------------------

     The present system "normally" only uses standard ASCII, unless an
     echomail conference moderator explicitly allows non ASCII characters.
     If a user does not conform to this and writes non standard ASCII in
     a message, then other users with different systems get garbage on
     their screens.  This can be (and in some areas is) a major problem.

     At present there is no way to display non Roman characters in FIDO
     messages.

     The proposed system:
     --------------------

     The proposed system will be able to help with messages that do NOT
     have the CHARSET kludge in them on an area by area basis.  However
     manual intervention by the user will allow it to translate the alien
     codes to the local ASCII extensions.  It will also allow editors to
     more easily make standard ASCII representations of extended character
     sets.  Which hopefully will make more users conform to standard ASCII.

     For messages with the charset kludge the method described below
     allows using extended character sets.  There are multiple levels of
     support:

     Level 0: STANDARD message (no charset kludge).  This method adds an
              option to convert non standard ASCII to ASCII.  Level 0 is
              straight forward: don't change anything, except remapping non
              standard ASCII to ASCII.

              This should be the initial default for any CHARSET message
              writer.

     Level 1: INTERNATIONALIZATION, accents and other language specific
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 22                  31 Mar 1997


              characters are supported.  This is needed for echomail areas
              that go through gateways to other systems that have a limited
              character set.  Level 1 can be supported by ALL types of
              computers!  It translates the standard US ASCII codes to the
              foreign ISO codes and back.

              Most software only needs to READ this type of message.  This
              is easily done with the sample implementation that is
              available via SDS.  Most software should directly support
              level 2.

     Level 2: Support for Level 1 plus EXTENDED CHARACTERS, included are
              graphic characters and special characters from other
              character sets such as Greek (for mathematical discussions
              for example).  This is intended to allow the different
              personal computer, workstation, mini and mainframe users to
              converse in text mode.

              The default for level 2 messages should be the LATIN-1
              character set.  It is still compatible with the present
              stream of messages.

              This is the most common level of support for most software.
              It is also what the sample implementation concerns itself
              with most.

     Level 3: Support for MULTIPLE CHARACTER SETS.  This requires a greater
              effort in implementation.  Level 3 is (of course) not
              backwards compatible.

              It is easiest to support level 3 if you use a pixel based
              display, it is probably not worth implementing on a text only
              display.  For example: if you have an X-Windows, Microsoft
              Windows, Macintosh or similar display then you should have no
              trouble implementing level 3.

     Level 4: Support for 16 BIT CHARACTER SETS.  Software authors
              that support products that are intended for use in Asia
              should concern themselves with this specification.

     The implementation algorithm which has been developed is a pop-in
     module that allows present message editor/display programs to offer
     Level 2 support for the 5 most popular systems (ASCII, IBM, APPLE, ISO
     Latin-1, VT100).  The Atari now uses the IBM character set, the Amiga
     and the VT200 displays use the ISO Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) character set.
     This implementation is also usable as a filter for fast translation of
     messages in gateway software or for a packet translator.  See the
     notes at the end of this document for further details.

     Levels 1 & 2:

     Levels 1 and 2 are based on a remapping system. The following must
     be supported:

       o  Level 1: remapping of non standard ASCII foreign characters,
          remaps characters that are less than decimal 128.
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 23                  31 Mar 1997


       o  Level 2: additional remapping of special characters and
          graphic characters, remaps characters over decimal 127
          (i.e.: characters with the most significant bit set).
       o  [optional] a style mechanism (bold, underline...)
       o  [optional] font switching (times, helvetica...)

     Characters below decimal 32 are reserved for special use (e.g.: the
     SOH character is used for message kludges).

     Note: Basically a lot of international message areas contain a certain
     amount of messages with international characters.  These characters
     have the same codes on all systems, they are most likely known to you
     through your printer manual, VT100 foreign symbols, or as IBM
     codepages.  The only reason these codes are not displayed correctly
     is that your message reader can not know which of these character
     sets is used.  Levels 1 and 2 will mark the message with an ID that
     will let your message reader change the environment in such a way that
     the characters are displayed correctly.

     The style mechanism and the font switching are fully transparent and
     backwards compatible.  Style changes are easy to support, even VT100
     and Hercules (on IBM-PCs) displays support underline and boldfaced
     characters.

     Remapping of foreign codes may take one of two forms selected by the
     user:

       1) remap to character set supported by this system
       2) remap to ASCII

     Level 1 remaps 98% on all systems, Level 2 remaps with a "best
     match" algorithm.  It may be that results are not perfect but they
     should be recognizable.  See the Technical Description below for some
     examples.

     Levels 3 & 4:

     Levels 3 and 4 require additional support that is non trivial.
     However, it is not as complicated as it might seem at first. The
     following must be supported:

       o  a character set switching mechanism,
       o  multiple character sets (Roman, Greek, Cyrillic...),
       o  character set remapping (fairly simple),
       o  [optional] transliteration (not simple),

     Transliteration (converting words and symbols to another representa-
     tion or language) is an optional feature that is supported by some
     operating systems (OS/2 and Macintosh as well as some UNIX systems).
     Transliteration is not really part of this proposed standard but is
     mentioned to bring the technical possibility to mind.  If your
     operating system supports it then transliteration is usually just a
     simple function call, if it doesn't then forget it.

     Levels 5 & 6:

     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 24                  31 Mar 1997


     Do not exist and are not (presently) proposed.  I was thinking about
     B&W bitmaps for level 5 and color graphics for level 6, however that
     is not suitable for Fido messages until ISDN becomes the standard
     medium of transport.  The physical (not logical) limit of 25000 bps
     on regular telephone systems is just not fast enough to allow the
     cost effective transfer of such large data amounts for a privately
     operating individual.  Even supposing a 10 to 1 compression of
     graphics, would not be nearly enough (color pictures could still
     easily be larger than 2 megabytes).

     Technical Description
     ---------------------

     This description gives a complete specification of levels 0 through 4.
     If you have needs that go beyond the specification of levels 3 and 4
     as they are put forward here then please write the author.

     As mentioned before the proposed method for levels 0 through 2 relies
     on remapping.  Remapping is fairly straight forward on almost all
     hardware plat- forms.  It is easiest on graphically oriented systems
     such as the UNIX X-Windows, Apple machines, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST
     and IBM Presentation Manager or Windows systems.  But even on text
     only displays such as IBM DOS, VT100 and Commodore 64 machines the
     most used characters are fairly easily available.  Helpful in this
     endeavor is that the foreign characters and additional special
     characters are often the same on different hardware platforms, even if
     they do not have the same ordinal value.  Examples are the ISO
     characters such as the English pound symbol and other common symbols
     such as the international quotes ("<<" and ">>") or the Yen symbol.

     The proposed remapper remaps non standard ASCII characters to the
     character set options of the present system.  Remapping may be one
     character to one character, one character to two characters or one
     character to multiple characters.  The latter requires extra
     implementation effort.

     Example:
       The uppercase "A" with the accent grave "`" above it, will remap on
       all systems that support at least the ISO foreign characters or
       similar character sets.  It will remap to the uppercase "A" in
       standard ASCII.  The user could be allowed the option to view an
       approximation of the original by displaying the "A" followed by the
       "`", but this choice is left to the implementor.

     The following two kludges are proposed (<charset_kludge> and <char-
     set_change>).  The kludge syntax is described in BNF below, comments
     are in curly brackets, terminal symbols are in double quotes.

     Case is important.

       <charset_kludge> ::= "^aCHARSET:" <charset_param>
                            | "^aCHRS:" <charset_param>

     FSC-0054 only writes the CHRS kludge, but for backwards
     compatibility with older methods allows CHARSET as a valid kludge.

     Note: up to the end of the charset kludge, all characters must be
     standard ASCII.  Keywords are in English.

       <charset_param> ::= <level_1_opt> "1" | <level_2_opt> "2" |
                           <level_3_opt> "3" | <level_4_opt> "4"

       <level_1_opt> ::=   "DUTCH" | "FINNISH" | "FRENCH"
                           | "CANADIAN" | "GERMAN" | "ITALIAN"
                           | "NORWEG"  | "PORTU" | "SPANISH"
                           | "SWEDISH" | "SWISS" | "UK"

     Note: <level_1_opt> represents the 12 different ISO international
     replacement characters.  An 8 character limit applies, more charac-
     ters may be used by the kludge, but only the above must match.


       <level_2_opt> ::=   "LATIN-1"
                           | "ASCII" | "IBMPC" | "MAC" | "VT100"

     <level_2_opt> strings may not exceed 8 characters in length.

     The Amiga and the VT200, etc. use LATIN-1 extended characters. The
     LATIN-1 kludge is the same as in FSC-0051.  The LATIN-1 kludge is used
     for the transport medium in the Network.  The others are primarily for
     local storage.

     Note: the other level 2 options can be useful in translating incoming
     messages as well.  Example: an IBM system hosts Echomail areas that
     concern themselves with Amiga and Macintosh computers, even though the
     messages do not have a kludge the local system could translate them
     using FSC-0054 to make the extended codes of these machines readable
     to his local machine. VT100 is included for local translation of PC
     graphics for non-PC based clients. It should not appear on the
     network.

       <level_3_opt> ::=   "Latin-1" | "Latin-2" | "Latin-3" | "Latin-4"
                           | "Latin-5" | "Arabic" | "Cyrillic" | "Greek"
                           | "Hebrew" | "Katakana

     Includes international character sets that can be displayed using not
     more than 224 (=256-32) characters, this consists of about 25 language
     sets.  The above are the most common.  If you are writing a product
     that requires one of the others please contact the me.

     Latin-1 is included because in level 3 you can switch character sets,
     in other words you can switch languages.  This is often the case in
     foreign languages, especially in technical discussions.  In Japanese
     for instance it would not be unusual to see characters from 4
     different character sets.

       <level_4_opt> ::=  " | "Hanzi" | "Kanji" | "Korean" | "UNICODE"

     Hanzi is also known as Chinese, Kanji as Japanese.  Level 4 Options
     are
     16 bit characters sets.  This does not mean that messages are twice as
     large.  In Japanese for example most words are represented with
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 26                  31 Mar 1997


     Katakana (8-bit) with the occasional Kanji character (16-bit) thrown
     in.

     For your reference, the ISO character sets are defined in the
     standards document ISO 8859.  Further Arabic is 8859-6, Cyrillic is
     8859-5, Greek is 8859-7, Hebrew is 8859-8, Latin-5 is 8859-9, Latin-4
     is 8859-4, Latin-3 is 8859-3, Latin-2 is 8859-2, Latin-1 is 8859-1,
     Katakana is JISX0201.1776-0.  For the level 4 options below Hanzi is
     GB2312.1980-0, Kanji is JISX0208.1983-0, Korean is KSC5601.1987-0.
     Unicode is not yet an international standard, it is included for
     future compatibility.  Your system software will support it if it
     passes ISO committee boards.

     When you implement foreign character sets be sure you conform to the
     standards!  Several vendors have taken it upon themselves to define
     their own standards, partially this was done because no firm standards
     had been set at that date.  Most vendors are correcting their
     character mappings to conform (e.g.: see Microsoft's conversion to
     Latin-1 in Windows away from the IBM-PC character set).  I do not have
     all the documents in machine readable form, if you want to get
     references I suggest you go to your local library.  Don't wait until
     the last minute though as it is likely that your librarian will need
     to order some of the documents.

     Note: <level_3_opt> and <level_4_opt> strings "imply" additional
     changes.  Example the Arabic and Hebrew languages are written from
     right to left.  Some character sets may be the same but character
     ordering is different.  Character widths may vary to a large extent
     (including zero width characters).

       <charset_change>::= "^aCHRC:" <switch>

     Note: use of the charset change kludge REQUIRES the charset kludge at
     the beginning of the message.  Also message readers supporting this
     kludge do not display a new-line if this kludge is encountered.

       <switch> ::=        <level_2_switch> | <level_3_switch>
                           <level_4_switch>

       <level_2_switch>::= "D" {default, see below for explanation}
                           | "F " <font_change> | "S " <style_change>

     The string "^aCHRC:D" is a resetting mechanism that turns on the
     default settings of the message displayer/editor, whatever they may
     be.  This string must be recognized by software that evaluates the
     style and font change switch.

     The It is assumed that the user is seeing some font that has a
     reasonable size suitable for his viewing needs.  Most printed texts
     are displayed in a serif 12 point, proportional font with no added
     style.  Most default settings come close to this representation.  On
     text only displays non-proportional fonts are the norm, however as
     no rule for the ordering of the displayed characters can be made, an
     assumption of a non homogeneous character display can be made.  In
     other words, one should not assume that characters are displayed in
     a fixed way, that's why we are have the <font_descrip> below.
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 27                  31 Mar 1997


       <level_3_switch>::= <level_2_switch> | "L " <level_3_opt>
                           | "C " <set_change>

     The character set change option can't be use in level 2 because of
     unsatisfactory display results on text only display hardware.  If you
     want to change the character set (not just font or style) then you
     must support level 3.

       <level_4_switch>::= <level_2_switch> | <level_3_switch>
                           | "L " <level_4_opt>

       <font_change> ::=   <font_descrip> " " <font_family>

       <font_family> ::=   NULL | {any number of fonts family names,
                           examples: Times, Bookman or Helvetica}

     The font families can be just about any text string, of course if you
     have an esoteric font then it is unlikely that the recipient has it as
     well (especially in echomail).  It is suggested that the author
     recommends that the user use commonly available fonts.  Even if a
     particular font is not available to the reader the font descriptor
     will approximate the display of the original message.

       <font_descrip> ::=  <font_descrip1>
                           | <font_descrip1> <font_descrip1>

       <font_descrip1> ::= "S" {serif} | "N" {sans-serif}
                           | "P" {proportional} | "O" {other}

     Note: font_family can be null, but font_descriptor must be there.

       <style_change> ::=  <style_change> <style_change>
                           | "b" {Bold}      | "i" {Italic}
                           | "u" {Underline} | "C" {All caps}
                           | "U" {double underline}
                           | "n" {Narrow also known as Condensed}
                           | "w" {Wide also known as Extended}
                           | "s" {Subscript} | "S" {Superscript}
                           | "O" {Outline}   | "h" {Shadow}

     Note: you may approximate different styles.  For example if you can
     only do underline then you can approximate double underline with
     underline.  Please do not approximate "All caps"!  All caps shows the
     All uppercase letters as large uppercase letters and all lower case
     letters as small uppercase letters.  If you simply convert all letters
     to uppercase you will misrepresent the intended style.

     Examples:
     ---------

     Double quoted characters are message text.

       1) "^aCHRS: GERMAN 1"
            Means text contains German characters, but still uses 7 bit
            character representation.

     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 28                  31 Mar 1997


       2) "^aCHRS: IBMPC 2"
            Means the text contains IBM PC graphic or extended characters.
            This would normally only appear in locally held messages.

       3) "^aCHRS: LATIN-1 2"
          "^aCHRC:u"
          "Hi Joe,"
          "^aCHRC:D"
            Means the text contains LATIN-1 extended characters (not
            displayed in this example) and that "Hi Joe," is underlined.
            Also the "^aCHRC:" kludges do not result in new lines on
            message readers that support these kludges.
            The "CHRS: LATIN-1 2" is compatible with FSC-0051.

       4) "^aCHRS: ASCII 2"
            Means the text is standard ASCII, but hidden style and/or font
            changes are contained therein.

       5) "^aCHRS: Roman 3"
            Means that a level three editor has created this text.  An
            editor (with the roman character set, that's ours by the way)
            that does not understand level 3 will only be able to read
            this text if the string "^aCHRC:L xxx" (with xxx being
            something other than Roman) is not contained in the text.
            Actually this should not happen as the Roman font is the
            default and the above kludge implies that another language
            character set is used somewhere in the text.

     Summary:
     --------

     Level 0:
       This is the initial default mode for CHARSET software.

       No additional work required.  However an implementor of CHARSET
       should include the following feature: remap non standard ASCII to
       ASCII.  This is Level 2 to ASCII remapping and is trivial to do.

       No kludge is required.  No special handling is required.  The
       messages are just as they always are, with a little less
       non standard ASCII.

     Level 1:
       This is similar to the optional Level 0 remapping but allows the
       use of foreign characters which are found in the ISO character
       sets.  Unfortunately the ISO foreign character sets are not
       complete.  I decided to restrict the Level 1 to this subset to
       assure that compatibility with virtually all hardware is guaranteed.

       The "^aCHRS: cccccccc 1" kludge is required.  One of two things can
       happen:

            (a) the message is entirely in ASCII (no kludge),
                everybody can read it.
            (b) the message contains ISO codes,
                 - the user has an older reader and does not have these
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 29                  31 Mar 1997


                 codes as his default codes, he gets a few garbage
                 characters (this is often the case at present).
                 - the user has an older reader and has these codes as his
                 default, he sees the message properly displayed (e.g.:
                 user has an IBM is reading a Swedish area, as he has the
                 Swedish codepage loaded; he will see things properly).
                 - the user has an editor that supports the charset
                 kludge, he sees the message properly displayed.

     Level 2:
       Remaps characters above decimal 127 up to decimal 255 to the "best
       match" character(s) available on the present system.  On graphic
       based systems the use of a different font (e.g.: an IBM-PC font
       on an Amiga) would give perfect display results.  For keyboard
       entry the remapper is required to convert the local codes to the
       codes required by the intended target.

       Example:  An Amiga user is reading an IBM echomail area.  The IBM
                 specific character set is allowed on this echo area.  For
                 best results a IBM character set font might be used to
                 display messages in the area.  Perhaps the software just
                 remaps the IBM characters to the appropriate Amiga
                 characters.  When the Amiga user enters text he may (a)
                 enter standard ASCII, (b) enter standard ASCII with Level
                 1 extensions, (c) enter characters in the IBM extended
                 character set.

       The software may optionally support font changing and style
       changes.  Font changes could be easiest to implement on graphically
       oriented systems, text displays could change the color of text.

       The "^aCHRS: xxxxx 2" kludge is required.

     Level 3 & 4:
       The message is probably unreadable unless you have a level 3 (or
       level 4) editor.  They are required for true international software
       however.

     Implementation Sample:
     ----------------------

     An easy and fast way to implement such a remapper is to use a look-
     up table mechanism.  The implementation described here is based on
     an expandable, data driven structure.  The following routines
     describe the READ routines.

     Function Charset_Kludge_Detected (Ptr_To_Text, Level)
     {This function implements the basic level 2 requirement}

       If our character set then
            print (Text)

       If Level = 1 then
            For each character in text
                 output( lookup_table [character] )

     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 30                  31 Mar 1997


       If Level = 2 then
            If supported character set then
                 For each character in text
                      If Kludge then
                           skip it
                           {we are not supporting style and font changes
                           here}
                      If character > 127 then
                           output( lookup_table [character] )

       If level = 3 then
            exit with error
            {we are being lazy here}

     End of Function Charset_Kludge_Detected.

     Function Output (character)
     {this is the core of the implementation.
      It is also usable in slightly modified form as the write subroutine}

       define:
            lookup_table =
                 array [0...127 x 2] of type byte
                 { = array [127 elements] x [2 elements] }
                 {see below for exact definition}

       case lookup_table [character][0] of

            0...1:
                 { we have a single character replacement }
                 { IMPORTANT: graphic characters must have a
                   single character match }
                 print (lookup_table [character][1])

            32...127:
                 If lookup_table [character][1] >= 32 then
                      { we have a two character replacement }
                      { Examples: ae, oe, <<, Pt, pi, >=, etc. }
                      print (lookup_table [character][0])
                      print (lookup_table [character][0])
                 Else
                      { reserved for implementors use,
                        e.g.: more than two character replacement? }

            1...31:
                 { reserved for FSC use }

       end of case

     End of Function Output.

     Lookup Table
     ------------

     The lookup_tables are external (described below) files and have the
     following format:
     FIDONEWS 14-13               Page 31                  31 Mar 1997


     4 bytes:         identification
     2 bytes:         module version number
     2 byte:          level
     8 bytes:         reserved for future use (should be zero)
     8 bytes:         from charset
     8 bytes:         to charset
     256 bytes:       lookup table

     The identification is usually 0 (= FTSC set), numbers less than 65536
     are reserved for FSC use.  Implementation specific modules should use
     a timestamp (always the same number after it has been generated once)
     to mark them as non-standard modules.

     Module version number starts at zero and works upwards.  The first
     official release is "1".  The early sample implementations have
     version number "0".

     Level is the charset kludge level this module is intended for.

     From charset, is the character set this module translates from.  To
     charset, is the character set this module translates to.  Both are in
     C format (no leading length byte and filled up with zeros).

     The lookup table is a 127 element table with two bytes per element.
     The following rules apply:

       first byte = 0 or
       first byte = 1:
            second byte = 0: no output
            second byte > 0: second byte is output
       first byte < 32: reserved for FSC use
       first byte > 31:
            second byte > 31: output first & second byte
            second byte < 32: implementation specific switch useable by
                              programmer

     If the first byte is 1 in the lookup table, that is a marker to
     tell you that this character does not translate to the destination
     character set.  A "?" should be in the second byte.  Characters that
     are approximated with another character do NOT have a 1 as the first
     byte, they have a 0 in the first byte, or a printable character if it
     is a two character approximation.

     Note that you require two tables for each type of character set
     supported.  One to translate the alien characters to the local format
     and one to translate the local characters to the alien format.

     The advantage of this module system, is that additional "modules" can
     be added easily at a later date.  Example: the implementor of an
     Atari message editor has the following lookup tables: ASCII (requi-
     red), IBMPC, MAC and LATIN-1.  The user wants to take part in a UNIX
     echomail that allows VT100 codes, so he gets himself the required
     tables and binds them into the lookup table file.  The editor will
     now support the additional translations as it knows its capabilities
     by looking up the level and the kludge identifier in the lookup table
     file.  No code changing was needed.

     External Mapping Files
     ----------------------

     The lookup tables above are held in external files (READMAPS.DAT and
     WRITMAPS.DAT).  These files have the following format:

     1 byte:         machine architecture identifier
     3 bytes:        filler (should be zero)
     8 bytes:        charset this mapping file is for.
     Lookup tables:  described above

     The machine architecture identifier can have one of three values:
     0 = Sparc & 680x0
     1 = 80x86 & VAX
     2 = PDP-11
     these values reflect the byte ordering of those machines.

     The lookup tables should be ordered in the following way:
             o Sort by level (lowest first)
             o READMAPS.DAT:
                - sort by "from set"
                - each from can have 2 tables, the first is to the
                  local characterset, the second is to ASCII
             o WRITEMAPS.DAT:
                - sort by "to set"
     This allows fast binary tree searches to be done.

     The appropriate sort code (in C) is given below:

     int compare_read(r1, r2)
     CHARREC *r1,
             *r2;
     {
         /* sort by level first */
         if (r1->level < r2->level)
             return(-1);
         if (r1->level > r2->level)
             return(1);
         /* ASCII comes after local set (this is only for the read_maps) */
         if(strncmp(r1->from_set, r2->from_set, 8) == 0)
         {
             if (strcmp(r1->to_set, "ASCII") == 0)
                 return (1);
             if (strcmp(r2->to_set, "ASCII") == 0)
                 return(-1);
         }
         /* else sort alpha */
         return(strncmp(r1->from_set, r2->from_set, 8));
     }

     int compare_write(r1, r2)
     CHARREC *r1,
             *r2;
     {
         /* sort by level first */
         if (r1->level < r2->level)

             return(-1);
         if (r1->level > r2->level)
             return(1);
         /* if from_set is the same sort the to_set */ if(strncmp(r1-
         >from_set, r2->from_set, 8) == 0)
             return (strncmp(r1->to_set, r2->to_set, 8));
         /* else sort alpha */
         return(strncmp(r1->from_set, r2->from_set, 8));
     }

     Together with this document there should be a sample implementation
     containing:

       A complete set of level 1 maps.
       A complete set of level 2 maps (IBM, MAC, VT100 and LATIN-1).
       IBM, Mac and ASCII sample messages containing level 2 kludges, a
       German language level 1 message, a sample message reader and a
       sample message writer.  A module checker and a mapping file creator.

     If you want the latest version (or the sample implementation is not
     included with this document) you can file request at 2:243/100 with
     the magic name CHARSET , 1:1/20 has a copy as well.  The file is also
     distributed via SDS.

     Thanks to Ronald Bruintjes in the Netherlands, an FTP by mail OpusInfo
     facility is now available for the current Opus 1.73 files which are
     available at http://www.suburbia.com.au/~trev.

     Usage: send mail to ftpmail@deimos.nl. In the body of the message
     include the command GET [filename]. Do not include paths nor
     wildcards. If the file is available, it will be sent back to you via
     email in uuencoded form.

     A magic filename is available for OPUSINFO. This will send you the
     Opus 1.79 feature list. When Opus 1.79 is released, OPUS179 will send
     you the Opus 1.79 release files.

     TREV.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions

     Awk! I didn't realize how far behind I've gotten. Events in my
     personal life have conspired to keep me away from the keyboard
     during my recreational time. Heck, I'm late for a meeting right
     this very second.
