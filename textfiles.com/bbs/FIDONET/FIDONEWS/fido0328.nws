         When using ECHOMAIL, it is necessary to run TOSSMAIL against
     the incoming mail in your mail area in order to move ECHOMAIL
     messages to their appropriate areas.  TOSSMAIL 1.30 searches for
     mail which contains your Net/Node number as indicated in
     MAIL.SYS.  This presents no problem if you are a standard node.
     But, if you are a Hub and/or a Host, it is possible that senders
     have used one or more different (alias) Net/Node addresses than
     that given as the primary in MAIL.SYS.  Such messages will NOT
     be relocated by TOSSMAIL 1.30.

         NODEFIX addresses this situation by changing the Net/Node
     numbers of appropriate messages to a common value as specified
     by the user.


         NODEFIX.ARC, which includes NODEFIX.EXE and accompanying
     documentation, is available for downloading from:

                          SPEEDING UP BATCH FILES

                                Bob Unferth
                                Wilmette, IL

     Batch files make life a lot easier, but they are very slow.  Even
     when using batch files in RAM  disks,  execution  time  is  quite
     noticeable.  It  reminds me of the time when a batch file meant a
     batch of cards.  The techniques described here  reduce  the  time
     required  to  execute  batch  file  by  as  much  as  an order of
     magnitude.

     Execution time is closely related to the number of  lines  rather
     than the number of characters.  To save time put as many commands
     on one line as possible.  Some ways to do this:

     1. Instead of using a lot of lines for remarks, put what you have
        to say in a file  and  issue  the  batch  command  TYPE  FILE.
        TYPing  a file takes less than 30% as long as echoing the same
        information from a batch file.

     2. Instead of using a lot of lines to issue commands, put all the
        commands in a FOR subcommand.  For instance, your autoexec.bat
        file might start out:

            fastdisk
            parint
            scrnsave
            spool 7
            sk
            c:

        Instead, just say:

            for %%f in (fastdisk parint scrnsave spool:7 sk c:) do %%f

        This reduces six lines to one.  In DOS 2.1,  but not  in  3.0,
        you  can eliminate spaces and slightly decrease execution time
        like this:

            for %%fin(fastdisk parint scrnsave spool:7 sk c:)do%%f

        Note the colon between spool and 7.  You can't have any spaces
        within the parentheses except to denote the beginning of a new
        command.

     3. When  copying files use the FOR subcommand and wild cards like
        this:

            for %%fin(print v sp)docopy a:%%f???.*

        The FOR subcommand does not  support  wild  cards  within  the
     Fidonews                     Page 4                   21 Jul 1986


        parentheses.

        How much time the FOR subcommand will save, if any, depends on
        how  the  disk  buffers are used while the subcommand is being
        executed.  DOS remembers the  entire  subcommand.  It  doesn't
        have  to  go back to disk to read more of the subcommand as it
        goes along.  But DOS doesn't  remember  the  contents  of  the
        batch  file unless it is held in disk buffers.  Whether or not
        the disk buffers keep the contents of the batch  file  depends
        on what you're doing between batch commands.

     4. The  IF  subcommand  supports conditional commands and the FOR
        subcommand.  For instance,  you might want to see  if  a  file
        exists  and,  if it does,  to run several programs and then to
        return to the menu; or, if it doesn't to display a message and
        return to the menu.  A batch file for  this  task  might  look
        like this:

            If exist myufile goto programs
            echo File does not exist.  Try again.
            d:menu
            :programs
            myprog.ram
            second.prg
            third
            d:menu

        But it will run faster like this:

            If exist myfile for %%fin(myprog.ram second.prg d:menu)do%%f
            for %%fin(echo d:menu)do%%f File does not exist.  Try again,

     5. When a command processor or another  batch  file  is  invoked,
        batch processing for the first batch is terminated.  You don't
        need  to exit the batch file.  For example,  in the batch file
        fragment below,  the command GOTO  GETOUT  (and  probably  the
        label :GETOUT) is unnecessary and will increase execution time
        in some cases:

               ..
            command c:
            goto to getout
               ..
               ..
            :getout.

     6. A  fast  way  to  get  out of the middle of a batch file is to
        issue a command for another batch  file,  say  a  file  called
        exit.  EXIT  can contain only the command REM or just a dot or
        better yet nothing.  A file that contains nothing doesn't take
        up any disk space.  You can create such a  file  with  another
        batch file, say autoexec.bat, by inserting this command:

            for %%fin(echo rem)do%%f >d:exit.bat

        The  rem  part  of the command can be any command that doesn't
     Fidonews                     Page 5                   21 Jul 1986


        look for parameters on the command line, e.g.  cls or pause or
        sk.

     7. Of course,  running batch files from a RAM disk is a big help.
        It's sometimes worth transferring control to a batch file that
        has been copied onto your RAM  disk.  The  time  required  for
        handling  the  batch  operations  in a RAM disk is less than a
        third of that required for a floppy.

     8. Putting an end-of-file marker (ASCII 26 or Control Z)  on  the
        same line and immediately after the last command, will prevent
        annoying multiple prompts at the end of batch processing.

                THE NEXT STEP -- RESEARCH SELECTED COMPANIES


          When this initial phase of your research effort is finished,
     you'll find yourself already well ahead of the game.  Unlike most
     of your competitors in the job market,  you will have achieved  a
     clear   idea  where  you're  going  and  what  you're  trying  to
     accomplish.  You have established  for  yourself  a  well-defined
     area  --  a  specific  industry  (or  industries)  -- on which to
     concentrate your search.  (You may of course,  wish to narrow the
     focus  even  more,  to  a  specific  geographic area.) And in the
     process, you've learned a good deal about the industry and are in
     a position to begin researching specific employers and  to  start
     making   all-important  personal  contacts  with  people  in  the
     industry.  Furthermore,  you're now able to talk knowledgeably to
     industry  officials  about a subject that interests them greatly:
     their industry.  And your knowledge will  progressively  increase
     and become more detailed as you continue your search.

          The  second  and  final  phase  of  your research focuses on
     SPECIFIC COMPANIES within your selected industry.  Your immediate
     task here is to compile a list of employers -- as lengthy a  list
     as  possible  --  which  appear to have suitable opportunities in
     your field.  After you have compiled this list you will  then  do
     some  additional  work  to determine which department within each
     listed  company  hires  people  in  your  field   and   who   the
     department's  hiring  official  is.  Most  major  industries have
     industry directories -- often published by the industry trade  or
     professional  association  --  which provide company listings and
     officer  names   and   titles.   Trade   journals   and   company
     stockholder's  reports  may also help.  Or you may wish to simply
     call the personnel or public relations office  of  a  company  to
     obtain the needed information.

          TRADE JOURNALS AND INDUSTRY PERIODICALS.  These publications
     often  contain  news about current recruitment needs and plans of
     major companies;  in addition,  nearly  all  of  them  include  a
     "Positions Available" classified section.

          CORPORATE  DIRECTORIES.  Although it is not recommended that
     such  directories  be  used  for   indiscriminate   "scatter-gun"
     mailings, corporate directories can be very useful in helping you
     to  identify  firms  which may have current opportunities in your
     field.  But before you mail your cover letter  and  resume  to  a
     listed  company,  make  an effort to determine its current hiring
     needs (through additional library research or by  contacting  the
     firm  directly).  Then slant your cover letter in such a way that
     any relevant interests or accomplishments  are  highlighted.  The
     best  corporate  directories  are:  THE COLLEGE PLACEMENT COUNCIL
     ANNUAL, the S & P REGISTER, and DUN'S MILLION DOLLAR DIRECTORY.

          SMALL BUSINESS  AND  ASSOCIATION  REFERENCE  MATERIALS.  Two
     important  areas  often  overlooked  by  job  seekers  are  small
     Fidonews                     Page 8                   21 Jul 1986


     businesses  and   trade/professional   associations.   A   "small
     business,"   incidentally,   need   not  be  particularly  small.
     Companies with sales under $25 million are considered to fit  the
     usual  definition.  A  good  starting  point in researching these
     firms is the INC.  500 DIRECTORY (published  by  INC.  Magazine),
     which  lists and profiles the 500 fastest-growing small companies
     nationwide.  Another very good source is  so  obvious  you  might
     overlook  it  --  the  yellow-pages  telephone  directories (many
     libraries maintain yellow-pages directories for  all  major  U.S.
     cities).  As  for  associations,  your  best  source  of  company
     information is the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ASSOCIATIONS,  also  available
     at most libraries.

          MISCELLANEOUS  INFORMATION  SOURCES.  In  the course of your
     research,  you'll uncover many additional information sources  on
     your  own.  Here  are  a  few  additional  ones  that  have  wide
     applicability.  O'DWYERS DIRECTORY  OF  PUBLIC  RELATIONS  FIRMS;
     THOMAS' REGISTER OF AMERICAN CORPORATIONS;  EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS,
     THE IRREVERENT GUIDE  TO  CORPORATE  AMERICA.  (The  last  source
     mentioned, EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS, contains major company histories
     and  profiles  that  are  especially  useful in preparing for job
     interviews.)

     HUMAN FACTOR.

     Justin Norman, System Operator
     Northwest Super Fido (#105/2)




                   Are there any large Fidos out there?

         I recently started to look into a larger and more powerful MS
     or PC-DOS based machine to run my Fido on, and also run some
     other applications.  I have noticed that the IBM PC/AT or clones
     are the most leader.  So what I want you to do is if you own a
     computer system or systems that meat or exceed the following
     specs to please send me more information.

      System must have at least:
         A 6Mhz processor
         512Kb of Random Access Memory
         CRT controller of some type

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 550+ "ARC"  archives  -  20+  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 28 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...  Over
     55 DS/DD diskettes!!

     This collection is the result of more than 15 months of intensive
     downloads  from  just  about 150 or more BBS's and other sources,
     all of which have been examined,  indexed and archived  for  your
     convenience.  Starting  a  Bulletin Board System?  Want to add on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To order the library,  send  $100  (personal  or  company  check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No  profit  is  made  from  the  sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is  applied  entirely  to
     the  cost  of  downloading  the  software  over  the phone lines,
     running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and  inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software yourself through the use of  a  computer  with  a  modem
     using  commercial phone access would cost you much more than what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:
           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
           - Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
           - DSBackup
           - Fastback
           - ACS INTRCPT 720k format
           - Plain  ol' files (add $50)

     Add $30 if you want  the  library  on  1.2  meg  AT  disks  (more
     expensive  disks).  There  are  no  shipping or handling charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     Diplomacy Game F1 has been running for almost six bloody weeks
     on The Diplomat, which puts the game at the end of 1902.  It's
     been quite a fracas.  Russia, Germany and Turkey have almost
     eliminated Austria with a brutal combination of blitzing armies,
     propaganda, espionage, and deceit.  It has been a good time!

     For those that missed out on joining Game F1, we are now taking
     applications for players in the next game, F2.  Turns will be due
     weekly and diplomatic messages are your responsibility.  For more
     information contact Bryny at 124/109.

     Hallo allemaal, er zijn nogal wat problemen met de mogelijkheden
     van de commodore computers in Fido.

     1e. Uploaden. Dit gaat niet met de Teletron 1200 en de Multimodem
         64.

     2e. Downloaden. Dit gaat ook niet met deze modems.  Een aantal
         leden heeft me al meerdere malen gevraagt wat we (ze) daaraan
         kunnen doen.

     Heeft een van jullie een oplossing, of is er misschien dan toch
     een modem die deze problemen niet heeft.

     Ik zelf zit met 2 nieuwe programma's die ik graag in mijn node
     zou willen hebben. Bijde van commodore gebruikers.De programma's
     waren gemaakt voor het Micro-Master toernooi en ik mag ze als
     Publik-Domain gebruiken.  Dus als iemand er iets op weet, laat
     het mij dan weten.

     Vriendelijke groeten Loek Jansen  Sysop Rozenburg 1.

     SPLTNEWS - A New Fido Sysop Utility

     SPLTNEWS  is  a  program designed to allow  Fido  BBS  users
     easier  access  to the information contained in  the  weekly
     FidoNews "publication".  When used in conjunction with SEND-
     MAIL (written by Jeff Rush at the Rising Star Fido  124/15),
     it  allows  each  page of the the FidoNews  document  to  be
     entered  as  a message into a specific  message  area.   The
     users  may  then "browse" through the news by entering  that
     message area and reading the messages.  A particular article
     in  the  table of contents may be accessed  by entering  its
     page  number as a  message  number.  Casual readers may read
     each page by  just pressing return at the message prompt.

     Sample command line syntax:

     SPLTNEWS FIDO325.NWS

     This  example will create  PAGE.001,  PAGE.002, PAGE.003...
     in  the current  directory  -  one for  each  page  in  the
     original document.
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  21 Jul 1986


     The format of a PAGE.nnn file is thus:

     MSG:  0  DATE: 30 JUNE 1986    -- date from 1st line
     FROM: FidoNews Splitter
     TO: Everyone
     SUB: FidoNews Page n           -- the actual page number
     *
     *                              -- the actual text
     *                              -- from page n
     *
     END

     This is the format required by SENDMAIL.

     Although this program was written for use with FidoNews,  it
     may also be used to split other types of files.  The program
     and C source code are available on Fido 158/104.  The author
     will  respond  to  comments  and  suggestions  by   FidoMail.
     Please address any correspondence to Jim Fullton.
