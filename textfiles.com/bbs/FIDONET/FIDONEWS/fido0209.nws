        Disclaimer or dont-blame-me:

        The contents of the articles contained here are not my 
        responsibility, nor do I necessarily agree with them; 
        everything here is subject to debate. I publish EVERYTHING 
        received.  

        You can take this to mean anything you want, but hopefully 
        as an invitation to comment, make suggestions, or write 
        articles of your own.  

                             ARTICLE SUBMISSION

        All articles you see in this issue are written by users and 
        sysops, and have one way or another managed to consume disk 
        space on Fido #375. In order to get rid of them, and free up 
        my precious disk space, I include them here, then quickly 
        delete them. Then they are YOUR problem.  

        EDITORIAL CONTENT:

        Totally up to you; I publish anything at all. Articles are 
        generally Fido or BBS related; this is by no means a 
        decision on my part, nor a requirement.  

        FOR SALE, WANTED, NOTICES:

        Pretty much self explanatory. Commercial ads are welcomed, 
        if of reasonable length.  

        SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE:

        Manage to get a copy of your article to Fido #375, 
        preferably by Fidonet mail, or by uploading.  The name of 
        the file you send MUST have one of the following extensions: 

            .ART      An article
            .SAL      A "For Sale" notice
            .WAN      A "Wanted" item

        ARTICLE FORMAT: VERY IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!

        The requirements are a little tighter in this department, 
        due to purely practical constraints.  I cannot devote hours 
        to converting every text format in the world to the one I 
        use.  

        1.  NO LEFT MARGINS! Flush left please.  We will do the 
            indenting at our end, thank you.  

        2.  RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 60 OR LESS! Less is OK, more is 
            definitely not. This includes fancy boxes, dotted lines, 
            etc.  

        3.  NO FUNNY CHARACTERS!  This includes formfeeds and other 
            oddities.  

        4.  NO GRAPHIC CHARACTERS! Believe it or not, not every one 
            in the world has an IBM PC. My computer understands 
            printable characters from 20 hex to 7e hex. (Space to 
            tilde) This is ASCII; "American Standard Code for 
            Information Interchange". We are "Interchanging 
            Information". Everything else is GARBAGE. ASCII is 
            universal; Graphics are not.  

        5.  TOTAL ARTICLE LENGTH: Up to you; note, however, that I 
            will probably avoid publishing dictionaries, bibles 
            translated into NAPLPS, and ASCII encoded LANDSAT 
            pictures of Russian wheat farms.  

        6.  WHERE ON EARTH IS THIS ARTICLE FROM? Well ... good 
            question! A good idea to identify yourself somewhere, 
            unless you wish to remain anonymous. Thats okay too, but 
            I may balk at publishing rude or otherwise racy 
            submissions.  

        7.  You don't need to put in separator lines at the top or 
            bottom.  They are added automatically when Fidonews is 
            assembled.  

        Any article that doesn't meet the above criteria will get 
        bounced, and will not be published until someone gets around 
        to fixing it.  I might go over it and fix it up in time for 
        the next issue, or I might ask you to try again, or I might 
        just forget about it.  In any event, you must meet these 
        standards if you expect your article to be published 
        promptly.

                            Progress and Changes

        My first issue seems to have gone off well.  The automation 
        all worked as planned (it should have, it was only tested 
        about three thousand times).  The distribution went okay, 
        except that I seem to be sending to about three more nodes 
        than are possible in one mail slot.  (Something is definetly 
        going to have to be done about distribution.  You'll be 
        hearing more about this.)

        My major goal at this point is a weekly publication 
        schedule, but that requires twice as much material.  I can't 
        write it all myself, and wouldn't want to if I could.  I am 
        sure that you want to hear from many diverse viewpoints, not 
        just from me.  I urge you all, if you have an idea for an 
        article, write it and send it in!  All I ask is that you 
        follow the guidelines given above.  If you're new to 
        Fidonet, don't let that stop you.  New blood and new ideas 
        are vital to any group that wants to stay healthy and 
        active, and Fidonet is no exception.  If you're an "old 
        hand", don't let that stop you either.  There are plenty of 
        people out there who are interested in what you have to say.  


        So if you have anything to say, write an article and send it 
        in.  If you want to write a regular (or semi-regular) 
        column, just say the word.

        ============================================================
        Tom Jennings Fido #1

                Kent Leonard brought up the point "What did we learn
        from the PacBell/Tom Tcimpidis case?" (If you dont know,
        PacBell dropped all the charges for lack of evidence.)

                Well, they dropped the case for lack of evidence. My
        guess is that they were trying to or needed to show a
        pattern of abuse, not just toss him in jail over one single
        offending message. Apparently they didnt find a "pattern of
        abuse", just one (or a few? I dont know) offensive messages.

                Moral: Use the "2" command a lot. If you purge
        messages over 30 days (or whatever) old, then at the worst
        you will have a message that gets missed around no longer
        than 30 days (or whatever). 

                Probably my (sysop) habits are like most others; I
        read all messages, by reading the new ones once a week or
        so, and use "2" to purge 'em over 30 days. If I miss one,
        well, such is life. It will evaporate in 30 days anyways.

                In the midst of the flap this past fall I called
        PacBel's security dept and asked. (Why didnt anyone think of
        that earlier?) Of course they would not make an "official"
        comment, no names pleez, but basically I was told: "We dont
        go after BBS's. We only go after complaints, and then only
        if it might affect PacBel revenues. We are too busy
        following up serious problems to deal with BBS's."

                And in any case, don't go play ostrich if you
        suspect trouble! It doesnt help you, nor anyone else.
        Paranoia never does any good. It tees me off to hear of
        people "hiding" when the slightest trouble happens. The old
        "together we stand ..." is based on a real truth. We live in
        an age of huge bureaucracies and anal-retentive bean
        counters whose job it is to keep track of obscure and
        useless details. Together we have some power, however small.
        If we all hide and go away at the least sign of trouble, we
        are totally powerless. No one is going to shoot you, and you
        aren't important enough to show up on any watergate type hit
        list, so don't be paranoid.

                           Creating FIDO Source 
                                    by
                    Robert Briggs, SYSOP, FIDO node 464
                            


             I,  at  least,  am  willing to take on Tom  Jennings'  







FIDONEWS     --           14 Apr 85  11:46:00           Page 5

        challenge  to create source public domain source code  for 
        FIDO.   Therefore,  I  am creating a special section on my 
        board  for FIDO internal use only ,  devoted  to  handling 
        source  code  for a FIDO re-write.   This section will  be 
        available to anyone who sends me a FIDO-NET message - just 
        leave your log on name and desired password in the message.

             There  are  some ground rules that I  feel should  be 
        observed.   The  source should be able to be  compiled  by 
        either Lattice 'C',  Microsoft 'C' (about the same thing), 
        or  CIi-C86.   That  means that any features  peculiar  to 
        either  compiler  will  have to be stuck in a  library  of 
        routines   and  they  have  to  be  duplicated  for   both 
        compilers.   Since  I  am the author of the  CHEAPWARE  c-
        function  libraries,  this is "right up my alley",  so  to 
        speak.   

             FIDO  uses  both  interrupt driven send  and  receive 
        routines.   I   have have only the interrupt  driven  send 
        routines  available for both compilers.   I  will put  the 
        code  up on the board and let people somewhat more skilled 
        in assembly language "hack" on it.   FIDO also  implements 
        several  protocalls,  such  as KERMIT and TELELINK that  I  
        know nothing about.   I am sure that there is a WIZ or two 
        out there that could write something.   Please note that I  
        am  not  offering  to  write  FIDO,   just  take  on   the 
        responsibility of keeping track of a multitude of routines 
        that need to be done before we even have a good start on a 
        re-write.   This is no small job,  imagine several hundred 
        people submitting changes and ideas....

             Anyway,  everyones feed-back,  comments, suggestions, 
        gripes, etc. are welcome at my node.  One thing that I  do 
        insist  on,  the SYSOP must be able to sign onto the local 
        terminal  just like a remote user,  and without having  to 
        take FIDO down.   I have implemented a rudimentary version 
        of this feature, and a (extremely) rough copy of a program 
        that answers the phone, sends the file WELCOME.DAT out the 
        modem, and then asks for the users name.  Not much I  will 
        admit, but a start. 

             Please  respond  to the  programmers  technical  BBS, 
        Pro_Tech_BBS,  node 464.  The number is (801) 264-8290.  I 
        would  like  to currently limit access to the  section  to 
        those who can send me FIDO-NET mail.   Others later?  It's 
        all  up to the FIDO network SYSOPs.   I would hate to have 
        to cancel this whole thing for lack of  interest,  knowing 
        full  well that TOM gets many requests for info about  the 
        source code.  Must be some interest out there somewhere...

        Yes!  The NodeBook project is still going strong!  Many 
        sysops have participated but I need more input.  For some 
        reason the flow of listings came to a halt sometime around 
        April 6th.  Before that I received listings of up to six per 
        day.  I am all caught up with the compiling of all entries 
        and I'm waiting for more...  

        I am using the following format for NodeBook entries.  
        Please send your listing according to this format.  I have 
        received all kinds of formats imaginable which makes the 
        data entry part of the project a bit difficult.  Here is a 
        sample listing:

        Robert is looking for more options of interfacing
        FIDO with other types of systems, such as ATARI,
        TRS-80, TI, COMMODORE and ways of switching any
        existing BBS to interface with FIDONET without
        having to use the FIDO software as a whole.

        So, everything within the <+>'s is the listing of Roberts' 
        board.  Could you submit your entry exactly the same way as 
        the above form?  I have learned much about the task of data 
        entry and which format is the easiest to enter.  The one 
        which needs the least modification is the way to go.  My 
        article in the last March issue of FIDONEWS asked for a 
        summary in an A), B), C) etc. fashion.  That was a mistake.  
        Again, please submit your listing in the format shown above.  

        To all of you who did send their listings, thank you for all 
        the praise <blush> you included and your quick response.  I 
        have deceided to compile listings for 1) IBM 2) DEC 3) SANYO 
        4) MISC.  Don't get upset about the MISCELLANEOUS part.  I

        use and sell machines that fit that description (LEADING

        FIDO Demonstration        Allen Miller, Sysop Fido 85


             I recently was asked to give a presentation of the Fido
        bulletin board system for the Cincinnati IBM PC User's Group
        meeting.  I planned to do a 'live' demonstration by accessing
        Fido from a PC at the meeting while dislplaying the session
        on the club's pair of 25" RGB monitors.

             In doing my homework before the meeting, I found that
        the large meeting room used by our club did not have any
        telephone service.  I needed to be able to have one PC (the
        terminal) access another PC (Fido) without the aid of a
        phone line, dial tone, etc.  The following will document my
        experience and hopefully be of benefit to someone else along
        the way.

             I found 2 methods to have one PC access the second PC.
        The method which I chose made use of a Null Modem cable and
        no modems.  The second method, used a modular telephone
        extension cable and 2 modems.

        NULL MODEM CABLE
        ================

             A Null Modem cable consists of a special wiring
        configuration and RS-232 connectors (female) at both ends.
        The pin configuration is shown below:

                  Fido                     Terminal
                  ----                     --------
                    2 -----------------------  3
                    3 -----------------------  2
                    4 -----------------------  4
                    5 -----------------------  5
                    6 -----------------------  6
                    7 -----------------------  7
                    8 ----------------------- 20
                   22 ----------------------- 22

             Notice that the end with pin 8 wired is the Fido end.

             Using the Null Modem cable, the following steps will
        enable the termial to access Fido.







FIDONEWS     --           14 Apr 85  11:46:13           Page 8


        1.   Set the Fido command line modem mask with 255/V.

        2.   Start Fido.

        3.   Activate communications software on terminal.  Hitting
             <enter> should bring up the Fido sign on screen, the
             same as if you had called by phone.

        4.   The only thing which I could not get to work was having
             Fido automatically recycle and wait for new caller
             after the session was completed.

        TWO MODEM SETUP
        ===============

             For those of you not able to manufacture or obtain a
        Null Modem cable, there is another way.  Connect the modems
        of the 2 PC's using a modular telephone extension cord.
        With the hardware in place, do the following:

        1.   Set the Fido command line modem mask with 255/V.

        2.   Use a FIDOMDM.BBS, modem initialization file, with the
             Hayes modem command ATA as the last entry.

        3.   Start Fido.

        4.   Activate communications software on terminal.

        5.   From keyboard of terminal, give the Hayes modem command
             ATD.  You should now be able to 'wake' Fido up by
             hitting the <enter> key.

        After reading Tom Jennings article  in  the last Fidonews, I
        agreed with him that because of the  rapid expansion one man
        could  no  longer  maintain  Fido  and provide the necessary
        improvements along with the bug fixes. Since Tom's source is
        proprietary, we must start from  the  beginning so I propose
        an effort  to produce  a  public  domain  fido  with  source
        developed by and for SYSOPS. Tom has agreed to help with the
        Fidonet portion as his time allows but we must not depend on
        him and learn to understand the software  ourselves. I would
        like him to publish a document that specifies functions with
        arguments and a description  of what they do,  none  of  his

        source need be made public only functions and descriptions.

        Hopefully there are enough of us that program in "C" that we
        could put together a project team to do this, I already have
        several volunteers from a  net mailing I sent  out.  I  have
        received  responses  from  Tom,  Jim Ryan,  Ken Shackleford,
        Howard  Ekman,  Mike Elkins, Thom Henderson and Daniel Doman
        so far, I  believe that there may be more out there and alot
        of excellant programmers.

        My ideas, basic design leans to 1 menu area (kinda like pup)
        that allows message categorys and file categorys,  a  switch
        for 1200/2400 baud operation only, and a  multiple  bulletin
        message area(like RBBS), and above all  enhancements for use
        in a network environment  to allow several  phones lines and
        machines if desired.  I would also retain everything current
        in Fido now(even kermit no matter what a kludge it is people
        use it).  However starting from scratch we should be able to
        cut down on  the size  of the program with careful design at
        least I would  hope  so,  I am not as bold as Tom so my idea
        would be to keep it under 128k in size.(If possible at all)

        These are just my basic ideas for improvement and  to  allow
        some outside creativity to slip in(not that Tom isn't great)
        One final thing  on the bbs a USENET  tiein for  UNIX people
        would not hurt my  feelings  at  all.  But I am not sure how
        they would feel about us.

        The final thoughts that I have are a network of  Fido SYSOPS
        that can answer questions and  relieve the strain on Tom ( I
        want to go to 2400 before  we get the  PD project finished).
        He gets  numerous questions  everyday from  new sysops  that
        have been  answered  time and again.  An article  on the 100
        most frequently asked questions would  not hurt, but I would
        be willing to answer  questions on  what I can and I am sure
        that  there are  more experienced  sysops than me that would
        also volunteer to help.

        Okay guys and gals, it is up to you I will  be workin on the
        workin design basically we will try to get a fido equivalent
        workin  in the form I described then add any enhancements we
        can agree on(or if we dont agree  at least you will have the
        source to make your own changes...so there).   Send any  and
        all ideas for improvements or enhancements to me at Fido 329
        and the team will look at them, also dont get  excited about
        getting anything anytime  soon cause it ain't  gonna happen,
        this is strictly a spare time  project as we can  parcel out
        the work to volunteers.  Complaints, comments and critisisms
        can be funneled through my bbs at 918-493-2137. THANKS

        David Heron Space Coast Fido Node #457
        Titusville,Florida and The John F. Kennedy Space Center
        April 12,1985

        After 5 previous delays and one this morning, the shuttle 
        Discovery and its crew finally left the ground. The delay 







FIDONEWS     --           14 Apr 85  11:46:22           Page 10

        this morning was caused by a cargo ship that drifted into 
        the safety zone in the Atlantic Ocean east of Kennedy Space 
        Center.  

        When the next launch window opened at 8:45 A.M. EST, it 
        looked like rain might delay the shuttle until the 
        thirteenth. But at the last moment the launch control crew 
        decided to get the bird up before Atlantis arrived and the 
        parking lot was full.  

        Rising into the heavily clouded sky, Discovery performed 
        perfectly as she has on past missions. The only complaint 
        was a rise in air pressure caused by the launch systems. 
        Ground control quickly stated the rise was perfectally fine 
        and that the crew had no worry.  

        One crew member, Utah Sen. Jake Garn, has been the brunt of 
        jokes in the comic strip Doonesbury. As one report has it, 
        the launch crew put up a large sign that said "Barf, JAKE, 
        Barf!". So much for the higher intellect of the launch 
        crews.

        IBM XT Instructions:

        1.  Turn off the system unit, and disconnect the power 
            cables, monitor and keyboard cables and any cables that 
            may be connected to expansion boards.  Remove the 







FIDONEWS     --           14 Apr 85  11:46:26           Page 11

            monitor and the keyboard.  Place the system unit in a 
            convenient work area.  

        2.  Take off the cover from the system unit by removing the 
            5 screws on the back (4 corners and top center), slide 
            the cover forward and tip up to remove completely.  

        3.  Take out any boards installed in the expansion slots by 
            removing the hold down screw at the rear of the chassis, 
            and pulling the card straight up.  

        4.  The floppy disk drives will have to be removed to gain 
            access to portions of the mother board.  This is done by 
            removing the screws on the left side of the drive(s).  
            Gently slide the drive(s) out of the unit far enough to 
            get at the cables plugged into the back of them.  Making 
            note of where each cable goes, remove the data and power 
            cables by gently pulling them away from the drive.  When 
            the cable are off, remove the drive(s) from the chassis 
            and set them aside.  

        5.  Refer to figure 1 and locate the jumper block labeled E2 
            on the mother board.  It is located near the edge of the 
            board near the power supply.  

        6.  A jumper has to be installed between pads 1 and 2 on E2.  
            This can be done without removing the mother board using 
            a short piece of wire.  Hold the wire with a pair of 
            needle nose pliers and heat up one of the pads with a 
            soldering iron.  When the solder melts, push the wire 
            into the pad and remove the soldering iron.  Do the same 
            thing with the other end of the wire and pad.  

        7.  Refer to figure 1 and locate the IC socket labeled U84 
            on the mother board.  This will be an empty socket near 
            the front of the board, underneath where the floppies 
            were mounted.  Install the 74LS158 chip in this socket 
            making sure pin 1 (marked with a dot or notch) is 
            pointing away from the front panel.  

        8.  Remove the 64k RAM chips in the rows labeled BANK 0 and 
            BANK 1 (9 in each bank) on the mother board using an IC 
            puller.  If you currently only have 128k of memory on 
            the mother board (BANK's 2 and 3 empty) you can move 
            these chips to those banks.  Be careful not to damage 
            the pins when removing them (you can sell them to a 
            friend whose machine has amnesia).  

        9.  Install the 256k RAM chips in the now empty sockets of 
            BANK 0 and BANK 1 making sure they are installed 
            correctly with pin 1 pointing away from the front panel.  
            You should now have 2 banks (0 and 1) of 256k RAM chips, 
            and 2 banks (2 and 3) of 64k RAM chips, giving you a 
            total of 640k.  

        10. Refer to figure 1 and locate the switch block, SW1 on 
            the mother board.  Make sure that switch positions 3 and

            4 are in the OFF position.  

        10. Re-install the floppy drive(s) by sliding them into the 
            front panel about half way and reconnect the data and 
            power cables in the same locations they came off of.  
            Push the drive(s) the rest of the way in and anchor them 
            with the screws removed earlier.  

        11. Re-install the your expansion boards (minus any memory 
            boards that used to be in the system) in the reverse 
            order of when you took them out.  

        12. Put the cover back on, re-connect the cables and install 
            your monitor and keyboard.

        Thom Henderson, Fido 375
        System Enhancement Associates

                             Public Domain Fido

        I agree that we should have a public domain source for a 
        version of Fido.  The reasons are legion, and stated 
        elsewhere, so I won't repeat them.  A great deal of talent 
        has been volunteered for the effort, so I am sure that 
        something can be done.  I'll just toss a few thoughts into 
        the pot.

        It's not necessary to duplicate the existing Fido source.  
        Some (including, I think, Tom Jennings) would argue that 







FIDONEWS     --           14 Apr 85  11:46:37           Page 13

        it's not even desirable.  So we don't need functional specs 
        for the existing system.  Instead, we should first decide 
        what we want the result to look like and act like, and then 
        break it down into functional parts which individuals can 
        tackle on their own.  A few such functional parts come to 
        mind immediatly:

        1)  Fido and Fidonet are obviously different, even though 
            they must work in concert, and may even share many of 
            the same subroutines.

        2)  The message area can, by and large, be treated 
            separately.  At least, much of what it does would be 
            done nowhere else.

        3)  File transfer protocols can be dealt with in almost 
            total isolation from everything else.

        4)  Certain low-level functions, such as conversing with the 
            comm port, watching for the start/end of a scheduled 
            event, and so forth, can and should be designed and 
            implemented before anything else.

        We will also need to choose a common language to write this 
        in.  I personally vote for Computer Innovations C-86, for 
        the following reasons:

        1)  It's the language I write in, so I'm biased.

        2)  Their library has good low-level support, allowing an 
            easy, standard interface to the hardware and the 
            operating system.

        3)  They are on the net, making them more eaily available 
            for questions and assistance (I am presuming, of course, 
            that they are willing to participate.)

        Someone, or some group, somewhere, is going to have to 
        oversee all of this effort.  At a minimum, this will include 
        putting together the initial system design, writing up the 
        functional specs for the various parts, doling out the specs 
        to the people who will do the writing, coordinating 
        everyone's efforts, and assembling and tailoring the 
        "finished" parts as they come in.  I'm not at all sure how 
        to go about finding someone who has the ability, experience 
        managing large projects, AND the time to spend.

        I have personally been long of the opinion that any task 
        which CAN be done by one person, SHOULD be.  I suspect that 
        this may be such a case.  I therefore offer an alternative 
        proposal:

        1)  Whoever can should write up technical specs on how the 
            various parts function (such as how does Kermit work, 
            how does CRC checking work, etc.)   Much of this has 
            been done already, but it needs to be gathered together 
            and disseminated.







FIDONEWS     --           14 Apr 85  11:46:42           Page 14


        2)  Everyone who feels able and has time should go ahead and 
            try writing his/her own version of Fido.

        3)  People should start sharing function libraries for Fido 
            tasks.  (ie. I've got a Kermit routine, does anyone have 
            a Telink routine? [example only])

        4)  THEN, bright people everywhere can start looking at the 
            various sources and combining the best aspects of each.

        Given the (inherently) disorganized nature of the Fido 
        community, I suspect that an approach such as this has the 
        best chance of success.

        A *Brand new* "BABY BLUE" Z80 card for the IBM PC.  I bought
        this sucker a long time ago as a security blanket before I
