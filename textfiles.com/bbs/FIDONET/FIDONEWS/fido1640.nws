     =================================================================

                           New Zone 1 Coordinator!

     I kinda missed this piece of news myself until I got some crash
     netmail from David Mouffarege:  as of last Friday's nodediff, he's
     listed as the Zone 1 Coordinator!  Congratulations, Dave... we're
     happy that the (almost) three month wait is over, and looking
     forward to seeing you in action.

     A special thanks to Bob Satti for continuing in the position while
     Dave addressed the personal problems which prevented a more timely
     assumption of the position.

                                    Notice

     You may be wondering why the new Z1C would be interested in
     crashing mail to Fidonet's newest pundit.  Well, as one of his first
     official acts, he added the traditional 1:1/23 (Fidonews Editor)
     to this week's NODEDIFF with my BBS listed.  I'd be wary of using it
     right away for two reasons:

     1.  I doubt that netmail routing is set up everywhere yet.  Zone
     hubs are hereby requested to route it towards George Peace, and
     George is requested to route it to John Bixler, my uplink.
     1:270/100 > 1:270/911 > 1:1/23 would follow my normal netmail
     pattern.

     2.  My Telegard BBS package doesn't seem to have the capability of
     grabbing netmail addressed to "Editor" and putting it in my mail
     package.  Unfortunately, the only thing I had which would override
     this was a utility called NETMANAGER, which I removed because the
     evaluation period had expired.  If readers of the newsletter want to
     use this new address, please use "Douglas Myers" as the name rather
     than the listed "Editor."

     =================================================================


                              Fidonews Web Site

     Jim Barchuk, the Webmaster at fidonet.org, informed me last week
     that he'd switched the email address "editor@fidonet.org" to forward
     all email to my "DougM@paonline" address.  Readers of Fidonews are
     welcome to use either address.  I logged onto fidonet.org last week,
     and was pleasantly surprised to find that it's much more than a
     place to read Fidonews.  It contains links to other Fidonet web
     sites, links to software authors, and a search engine.  There's even
     a link to let you write me a letter or send an article :)

     I asked Jim in email about the history of fidonet.org, and got this
     brief reply:

     ----------
     It was about three years ago that I decided to do 'Fidonews in HTML'
     as a learning experience. The original site was
     http://www.geocities.com/Athens/6894/. Chris Baker was editor. I
     asked him what he thought about copyright permission, and he wrote
     to Tom Jennings who gave the 'OK.' That site was limited to 1M. All
     it had was the current issue from week to week.

     When I put up my own server naturally I installed fidonews.org here.
     I could easily do lots more fun things like email forwarding for
     editor@, majordomo mailing list distribution, site search engine,
     and BBS search engine.
     ----------

     Check it out!


     -----------------------------------------------------------------

                            What Web Page is this?

     I guess it's time for a shameless plug for my Web Page. Ok, it's not
     an official Fidonet page and isn't sanctioned by Fidonet or any of
     that stuff. It is, in my humble opinion, a good Fidonet page.

                                What's on it?

     Lots of things. You'll find a nice Ansi train that I converted to
     .gif format, some dogs (Fido type, of course), some eyes, a search
     engine and, of course, links.

                                   Links!?!

     Of course. That's what Web Pages are for, isn't it? :)  There are
     links here. Links to Fidonet Zones, Regions, Nets, Nodes, Support,
     Strange and Wonderful Places and other stuff. If you look hard
     enough, you'll even find a picture of me and my family. :)

                                  Who am I?

     Guess I should introduce myself. I'm 1:124/6308(.1 if you wish).
     Ok... That's not what you wanted to hear. :)  I'm Frank Vest and I
     run Collin County Station BBs in McKinney, Texas U.S.A.  I'm also
     the current NC of Net124 and a Fidonet nut..... Or is that Fidonut
     net?? Either way, I love Fidonet! :)

                              Why did I do this?

     Simple answer... I love Fidonet. Most of what I know about computers
     comes from the great people in Fidonet. It's just a small way to
     give back. Besides, I had the Web space and nothing to do with it.
     :)

                          Oh Yes! The Page address.

          Now that you've read all the dribble, here's the address:

                            http://texoma.net/~flv

     You'll see a spinning world when the page comes up. Click on it and
     you'll be transported to the wonderland of Fidonet and other
     wonderful places.

     If you have a page that is related to Fidonet or support of Fidonet,
     let me know about it. I'll look your page over and add a link to it.
     If you like my page, please add a link to it on your page.

     Happy modeming to all,

      Frank Vest - Collin County Station BBs
