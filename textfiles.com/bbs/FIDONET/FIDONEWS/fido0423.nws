                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                         Is IFNA Stealing FidoNet?

     There's been some talk  about  how  IFNA  is  trying  to  "steal"
     FidoNet,  and even FidoNews for that matter.  Hey, serious stuff!
     Is it true?  And just what is this IFNA thing, anyway?

     FidoNet was originally created by Tom Jennings.  But  managing  a
     network is a hassle, and a far cry from the happy hacking that TJ
     was really into, so he turned it over to Ken Kaplan.  Ken ran the
     net  quite  well  for a long time.  Many of us still remember the
     days  when  the  way  you got a node number was you asked Ken for
     one.  In a similar manner TJ started FidoNews and  published  the
     first  few issues.  But that too turned into a boring drudgery of
     daily details, so he gave it to me and I've run it since.

     So who ran FidoNet?  It looks to me like Ken Kaplan did.  Oh,  he
     had  help.  Ben Baker worked out most of the technical details of
     making it actually operate,  and I  chipped  in  with  my  thumb-
     fingered  assistance  and  loud voice.  Later when we established
     multinet operation we off-loaded a lot of work on a hierarchy  of
     network and regional coordinators,  and we found guys overseas to
     fob work off onto.  But mainly Ken ran it.

     That works fine for a small group,  but it starts to hit problems
     when  you get big enough.  For example,  what if Ken decides he's
     tired of it?  Who takes over?  When the  whole  net  consists  of
     fifty  people  who all know each other it's no big deal.  Someone
     will  step  forward  and do it sooner or later.  But when the net
     has over a thousand sysops most of whom have  never  met,  making
     sure that everything will keep running becomes a major concern.

     Here's another example: Ken's done a fine job so far, but what if
     we  someday  decide  that  he needs to be replaced?  How do we do
     that?   The  FidoNet  Policy  and  Procedures  Guide,  version  3
     (Policy3)  says in effect that Ken Kaplan is the Lord of FidoNet,
     not subject to veto by anyone.  Read the section titled "Problems
     with the International  Coordinator".  It  says  you  have  three
     choices.  Live with it, drop out, or start your own net.  It says
     that because there's no mechanism for replacing the International
     Coordinator.  There never has  been.  Ken  has  always  been  The
     Boss, and we've never had a problem.

     So  for  those  reasons  (among  others)  Ken Kaplan felt that we
     needed some sort of formal organization to be in charge,  and the
     rest  of  We Who Ran Things agreed,  so we set up IFNA.  From day
     one IFNA was created to be the organization  that  runs  FidoNet,
     and that's what it is today.

     Did  IFNA steal FidoNet?  Heck,  no!  The people who were already
     running FidoNet  created  IFNA  to  handle  it.  Did  IFNA  steal
     FidoNews  from the sysops?  Again,  no,  because the sysops never
     owned FidoNews in the first place --  I  did.  Do  I  think  IFNA
     FidoNews 4-23                Page 2                   15 Jun 1987


     should own FidoNews?  Take a look at the banner on the title page
     of this issue,  or any issue for over a year,  and I think you'll
     be able to figure out my answer.

     So given that IFNA is running  FidoNet,  is  that  good  or  bad?
     Well,  it kind of depends on what IFNA does with it.  The interim
     board of directors is the same people who  were  running  it  all
     along,  so  for  now  it hardly matters.  We'd do the same things
     whether we called ourselves  IFNA  or  not.  After  August  it'll
     matter,  because the new board of directors will be elected then.
     At that point IFNA will cease to be a tight little oligarchy  and
     will  be (one hopes) representative of its membership.  From then
     on it's up to you.
