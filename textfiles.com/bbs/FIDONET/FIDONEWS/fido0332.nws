                              What a Weekend!


     Now that I've been back home a few days,  I think I've  recovered
     enough to write about the conference.  I had planned on borrowing
     a  PC  on  Sunday and writing something for last weeks newsletter
     about it,  but I was so exhausted from three nights of less  than
     five  hours  sleep per (often MUCH less) that I just wasn't up to
     it.  Last weeks newsletter got delayed anyway due to yet  another
     modem glitch, so it's probably just as well.

     All  in  all  I'd say it went pretty well.  I certainly would not
     have missed it for anything!  It was a  bit  long  to  substitute
     caffeine for sleep, but it was worth it.

     There  were quite a lot of rough edges.  Nobody involved had ever
     run a conference before,  and it did show once in  awhile.  Also,
     the whole thing got started so late that we didn't get first call
     on  the  rooms.  We were constantly being pushed out by the hotel
     management to make room for a wedding reception,  or  some  such.
     Still, COSUG did a masterful job.

     Also,  COSUG got most of it either on tape,  videotape,  or both.
     They volunteered in a moment of weakness to transcribe it all for
     a series of FidoNews columns, and I mercilessly pounced,  so keep
     your eyes on this newsletter in the coming weeks.

     But  many people recovered even faster than I did.  I got home to
     find no less than four articles about the conference waiting  for
     me.  I'm including them in this issue, along with anything else I
     may  get  before  the  deadline.  As  you'll see,  quite a lot of
     controversy got stirred up.  Also,  quite a few solid points were
     made.

     It says I'm the editor,  so I guess I'll be editorial and express
     some opinions.  Here are my thoughts about what happened that was
     the most significant:

     1) Randy Bush presented  the  report  of  the  FidoNet  Technical
        Standards Committee.  This is a group that has been engaged in
        documenting  what  FidoNet  is  and  how  it  works.  Not  the
        politics -- just the stuff that goes over the phone line.  You
        know, technical stuff.  This will have, I predict,  long range
        impact  for many years to come.  Expect to see a whole crop of
        FidoNet compatible software coming down the pike.  Two cases I
        know of:  Bob Hartman (who recovered VERY fast) took only  two
        days  to  come up with a primitive FidoNet mailer based on the
        spec,  so we know it works.  And Phil Becker (author of  TBBS)
        was seen floating around,  and now has a copy of the specs, so
        you can probably expect TBBS to  start  doing  netmail  before
        long.

     2) A  great  many  people  expressed  concern  that Ken Kaplan is
        becoming too remote from the day-to-day hurly burly of being a
        sysop.  I don't  really  see  how  that  could  be,  but  he's
        certainly going to be more accessible in the future.  Step one
        of this is:

     3) An echomail conference is being established for IFNA business.
        Mike Hamilton will be coordinating it,  and since in any given
        group Mikey will be representative of the dissident  elements,
        it will certainly be an open (and active) conference.  Contact
        Mikey at 103/501 if you want to link into the free-for-all.

     4) We  absolutely MUST do this again!  At least four nets offered
        to sponsor next year's conference.  Even COSUG offered  to  do
        it again (they must be real gluttons for punishment!)

     All in all,  it was an interesting and stimulating experience.  I
     have no doubt that you'll be reading a great deal about it in the
     weeks to come.  One word of caution, though:  Please keep in mind
     that  you are hearing second hand reports,  and in many cases you
     are hearing about things that were suggested or  discussed.  Most
     of what got discussed will never actually take place.

                          A Colorado Springs Diary


     I can't believe that it has been 4 days  since  I  returned  from
     Colorado  Springs.  In  that time I have not yet seen any mention
     about what happened out there.  Perhaps this is due to normal lag
     time,  but  perhaps  it is just that no one has taken the bull by
     the horns and set it down in writing.  Well,  I guess I'll do  it
     if  no one else will.  This will probably turn out to be a couple
     of messages long,  so bear with me as we go through the 4 days of
     the birth of IFNA.

     Thursday 8/14/86:

     This was the first day of  the  conference,  and  it  was  pretty
     strange  to  see the looks on the faces of all of the people when
     they met each other.  It was kind of a game to see whether or not
     the person you were meeting looked the same as you  had  pictured
     them.  There  was a general BS session,  a large party at the SEA
     (Thom Henderson) suite,  complete with some munchies  and  drinks
     (right here and now I would like to thank everyone at SEA for the
     hospitality  they  gave  all weekend long!),  there was the usual
     announcements about who was there, who would be talking, etc.  It
     was a small prelude to what was in the future.  Most of the early
     attendees made it a late night,  but those who started IFNA  made
     it a 4am night!

     Friday 8/15/86:

     The  first real day of the conference!  The entire IFNA entourage
     was introduced  (Ken  Kaplan,  Ben  Baker,  Thom  Henderson,  Tom
     Jennings,  and  Henk  Wevers).  There  was an interesting talk by
     Allen Miller about running multiple Fidos  on  one  system  using
     MultiLink.  USRobotics  made  a  presentation on 9600 baud modems
     (which was pretty disappointing  to  me  -  it  seems  that  each
     manufacturer  has  its own standard,  and a Hayes for example may
     not talk to a USR).  Henk Wevers from the Netherlands,  and Frank
     Thornley from the UK spoke about communications in Europe (I must
     admit  that  I  missed  that  one).  Tom  Jennings  gave us all a
     preview of Fido version 12 (just a talk,  not  a  demo).  If  you
     thought that switching from nodes to net/nodes was bad,  wait for
     version 12 when we switch to  zone:net/node!!!  The  new  version
     has a lot of bugs fixed,  and can support a much larger number of
     nodes.  It is now also configured the same way that SEAdog  is  -
     with  a  config  file  instead  of  those  cryptic  command  line
     switches.  After the evening dinner,  Ezra Shapiro ("formerly" of
     BYTE  magazine - he still does some stuff for them I guess) spoke
     about  the  microcomputer  industry  in  general.  It  was  quite
     interesting.

     Personally during this day I jumped over the fence in terms of my
     involvement  with  IFNA.  I  went to the conference as a speaker,
     but mostly I went to represent my network as just another  sysop.
     During  the  day I met with Randy Bush and got a sneak preview of
     the IFNA documentation of the FidoNet mail  protocol.  Ben  Baker
     half  jokingly asked if when I received the document I would take
     Rovermsg from being a message system to being the full Fido clone
     that I had started out to write.  Well, needless to say I thought
     about it and decided that I probably would.  That was probably  a
     mistake,  but  the  next thing I knew I was on the Fido Standards
     Committee,  and was told I would  be  the  "document  tester"  by
     actually implementing the stuff.  Now  all  of  a  sudden  I  was
     almost an integral part of IFNA, and I had to look at things from
     a slightly different perspective.

     Another  major milestone during the day was when it became public
     knowledge that there were IFNA membership forms being  circulated
     and  that  it would cost $25 to be a VOTING member of IFNA.  Note
     that it says VOTING member.

     Saturday 8/16/86:

     There were several talks this day.  The first was by  Andy  Foray
     (I  hope  I  got  that  right)  from SEA on the internals of ARC.
     Since he had to run a little bit overtime  I  guess  people  were
     very  interested.  Next  came  my talk on the UNIX Gateway that I
     run.  Then was probably the most interesting talk of the weekend,
     Dave Hughes spoke about the NAPLPS graphics environment.  I don't
     really want to talk too much about it,  but if you are interested
     in graphics, you should probably read up on NAPLPS.  Well, all of
     that happened before lunch, then the S**T hit the fan!

     The  lunch  time  meeting  was  supposed  to  be the first annual
     business meeting for a new  non-profit  organization  called  the
     International  FidoNet  Association  (IFNA).  Well it was quite a
     fiasco.  I don't think that anyone had any idea  about  what  was
     going  to unfold.  As a little bit of background,  it was not yet
     clear what the $25 paid the day  before  was  actually  going  to
     cover.  It  was  unclear what constituted an IFNA member.  It was
     unclear what the goals of IFNA were.  In general, there were only
     5-6 people who knew anything,  and they were all at  the  podium,
     not  in  the  audience.  Well,  George  Wing from COSUG (who is a
     lawyer) tried to explain what the IFNA Articles of  Incorporation
     said  (there are three board members Ken Kaplan,  Ben Baker,  and
     Thom Henderson - only because those are the  only  addresses  Ken
     had  when  he  went to the lawyer to draw up the papers).  George
     did not expect that anything  would  go  differently  from  other
     start-up  meetings  where  in  general  the  membership  is asked
     whether this is ok,  and everyone says yes.  Well in this case he
     did  the  usual thing,  asking for those that were for this,  and
     those that were against.  The aye's won.  In theory IFNA was  now
     born.  Then  many people wanted to have discussion on the matter.
     The term "railroaded" came up many times.  Since we were about to
     get kicked out of the lunch room,  it was decided that  the  vote
     was  null  and  void,  and that the meeting would continue in the
     afternoon sessions.  Basically the only thing resolved  was  that
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   25 Aug 1986


     it  became obvious that the opposition was not a lone individual,
     but a fairly sizable group of sysops (the aye's barely won in the
     first "railroaded" vote).

     In order to give people a chance to settle down,  Randy Bush then
     spoke (as scheduled) on the Fido Standards Committee.  It was the
     first  time  that  many  of  the sysops realized that there was a
     movement to document everything.  It was interesting,  and I  can
     say  from  personal involvement that Randy has been doing a great
     job.  He should get  a  medal  for  what  he  has  been  able  to
     accomplish.  I  nominate him for the First Annual Fido Citizen of
     the Year!

     After Randy spoke it was time for the S**T hitting the  fan  part
     II.  To keep people under control, Ezra Shapiro volunteered to be
     the chairperson for the meeting (he did an excellent job,  and is
     first runner-up to Randy for Fido Citizen of  the  Year,  he  may
     have won it except he is no longer a sysop).  This meeting lasted
     for  a couple of hours with everyone speaking their piece on what
     they thought of IFNA.  It was an extremely emotional session, and
     it is very hard for me to remember the  details.  Suffice  it  to
     say  that  in the end the vote was to have the Board of Directors
     that are  on  the  original  Articles  of  Incorporation  be  the
     temporary  board until January 1,  1987.  Their task is to create
     the by-laws for  IFNA.  This  will  include  what  constitutes  a
     member, who can vote, what the IFNA goals are, etc.  Basically on
     January  1,  they  are supposed to have ready for a general vote,
     what some people thought should have been ready for this meeting.
     I would just like to say that Ezra Shapiro summed it up  best  by
     closing  the  session  with  a  statement that said (as near as I
     remember it) "I just want to go on the record as saying  that  if
     these 3 guys [Ken Kaplan, Ben Baker, and Thom Henderson] f**k up,
     I  am  going  to be the first to jump all over them.  It would be
     the downfall of the net, and that can't be allowed to happen".  I
     am sure that I shouldn't have used quotes,  but whoever  has  the
     tape  recording  of  the  meeting  can transcribe what was really
     said.

     After all of the excitement of the day,  the evening was spent at
     the  Flying  W Ranch where a good time was had by all.  Then came
     wind-down time where individuals met and  discussed  things  that
     had not yet been said, etc.  Again the SEAdog suite was the prime
     meeting  place.  It  was really the final time that you could get
     together with anyone that was at the conference.  Sunday 8/17/86:

     The morning had a trip on the Cog Railway up to the top of Pike's
     Peak.  It was a good trip,  and it was nice to  really  see  what
     Colorado  had  to offer.  Most of us had spent 3 straight days in
     the Hilton talking,  although my wife has since informed me  that
     Colorado  Springs  was a very interesting place - I'll have to go
     back some time.

     General Comments and Personal Observations:

     First and foremost I guess I would like to say that this  meeting
     showed  that  FidoNet  is alive (although not quite as well as it
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   25 Aug 1986


     could be).  Those sysops that did  not  attend  should  be  quite
     disappointed.  Next  year  we should all attend.  The 10% turnout
     for this one was probably larger than expected,  but with  enough
     advance  warning and preparation we should probably shoot for 50%
     next year.  We all have a personal stake in this thing.

     Secondly I would like to clarify what I believe is  the  position
     IFNA  is  taking  on the nodelist.  It was clear from the meeting
     that the major cost of running IFNA is NOT  the  distribution  of
     the  nodelist.  I repeat,  the major cost is NOT the distribution
     of the nodelist.  The major cost is in phone calls  dealing  with
     people  who  want  to know more about Fido,  and in answering the
     mail people send to inquire about Fido.  Since the preparation of
     the nodelists is semi-automatic,  and regional coordinators  POLL
     IFNA  for  it,  the  cost  of distribution is not what is hurting
     them.  Anyway,  after spending about 1 1/2  hours  of  a  2  hour
     flight from Colorado Springs to St. Louis talking with Ken Kaplan
     and  his  wife  Sally,  I think that what is "official" policy is
     that it will not cost anyone to be in the nodelist!  It will cost
     a sysop,  or anyone else $25 to be a VOTING member of IFNA.  This
     will   entitle   you   to   vote  on  future  directions  of  the
     organization, and also to use additional IFNA services (which are
     many and varied and will be  implemented  as  time/money  allow).
     According  to  Ken,  the  only way that money will be charged for
     entry  into  the  nodelist  will  be  if  it  becomes  absolutely
     necessary  to  slow  the  growth  of  the  network  for technical
     reasons.  This is based on the assumption that enough people will
     join IFNA based on their "extra services".  If this  is  not  the
     case,  then  to  generate the revenue required to keep Ken,  Ben,
     etc.  from going broke helping people,  it may come to paying  to
     get  into the nodelist.  I may be naive,  but it seems to me that
     $25 to be a voting member is a good deal.  I certainly have asked
     $25 worth of questions since becoming a Fido  sysop  (I  couldn't
     have   created   RENUM  or  ROVERMSG  without  asking  a  lot  of
     questions).

     A final observation:  Ken,  Ben and Thom are supposed to start an
     Echomail  conference  dealing with what should be in the IFNA by-
     laws.  I haven't seen it started yet, so how about getting on the
     stick guys.  If we don't start now while things are fresh in  our
     minds we may lose a lot of input.

     Here is the text of a message from Butch Walker  (161/1)  to  Tom
     Jennings regarding the Conference:


     Tom-

     You  probably noticed that I wasn't in Colorado Springs.  [grin].
     I have only heard from 2 attendee's so far,  but what I heard was
     not  encouraging.  I was very upset to hear that proxy votes were
     not accepted for those of us who could not attend.  It  seems  to
     me that the deck was stacked from the beginning,  or am I missing
     something?

     Let me say,  that I have no problem with you charging  for  Fido,
     but  I  would  like  some  more information along that line.  For
     example, what will the cost be,  what constitutes a version,  how
     often will the documentation change,  etc.  One of the advantages
     of the current system is that  a  potential  Sysop  can  download
     things,  get  his system setup and running and then apply to join
     the net.  If you are going to start charging for the software and
     there will be no downloadable docs how does the new sysop come on
     line?  Also if IFNA is going to start charging for the  nodelist,
     do  I start charging for helping a new node come on line?  I mean
     what the hell,  let's  all  get  greedy.  Maybe  I  should  start
     charging for my services as a host?

     What  is IFNA going to do with the bucks it collects?  What can I
     and the members of  my  net  expect  in  return  other  than  the
     nodelist,  which  is automated and without myself and the rest of
     the hosts sending in our updates  wouldn't  exist  anyway.  Am  I
     going  to  be  reimbursed  for  my  costs in putting the nodelist
     together?  Or how about my costs to mail  my  changes  in  or  to
     download  the  nodelist  and  distribute it each week?  I mean if
     someone is going to make bucks off of my efforts, shouldn't I get
     a piece of the pie?  Are either you  or  IFNA  going  to  provide
     local  support  for  my  nodes  when they need help or run into a
     problem,  how about to the brand new Sysop that wants to come  on
     line  and  join the net?  Is IFNA going to hold his hand by phone
     to get him on line the way I and some of my Hubs do  now?  Do  we
     maybe get a commission for the memberships we sell?

     I  will carbon copy this to Ken.  I would appreciate some answers
     to the above questions.  After all we have  an  excellent  medium
     here for exchanging information,  ideas, discussion and gathering
     votes.  What a novel idea, electronic communication!

     Here  is the text of a message from Josh Gordon (161/93) to Butch
     Walker regarding the Conference:

     Butch:

     The article was interesting and about what I  expected.  I'm  not
     particularly concerned about the actual charges;  it represents a
     small portion of my phone bill,  at any rate (though  that  might
     not hold true for everyone),  and wouldn't hurt me.  The politics
     are also not surprising;  the lack of a published agenda and  the
     manipulation  and  secrecy by the folks with a vested interest is
     the offensive part,  and I'm more than willing to write that  off
     as  small  group dynamics in a semi-anarchist organization (i.e.,
     FidoNet Sysops,  as opposed to the inner  core  of  IFNA  czars).
     However,  we  have certain defenses against this.  IFNA (being by
     definition a non-profit corporation) has to have certain  things:
     a  set of by-laws is the most important.  We (Fidonet sysops) are
     the interested class, and it would be hard for the Comintern (oh,
     sorry, the IFNA board) to do much of anything without most of the
     Sysops agreeing.  If they act heavy-handed enough, piss on them--
     we can have our own goddamn network  without  ANYTHING  on  their
     part.  We don't need them at all unless we WANT them.  So far the
     services have been merely providing a nodelist; I've seen nothing
     else.  (Am  I  missing something?) And most of the tools and such
     have been written by people working from pure love,  without  any
     vested interests (except to get a nice tool for themselves.)

     I think a period of reflection is called for now.  I am more than
     willing  to  pay  TJ  $20  for Fido and even another $19.95 for a
     manual--in fact,  I would have been happy to  pay  $19.95  for  a
     manual  in  the  first place,  rather than have to fool with that
     obnoxiously formatted one that was published in the  first  place
     (it  ate  up at least 2/5 of an hour of my time getting it right,
     and my time is worth $50/hour minimum, so...) And $25/yr for IFNA
     is also no big deal;  nodes that don't want to  pay  that  amount
     essentially would have to get all their mail routed through their
     hubs or hosts,  and if they expected file transfers,  they'd have
     to tell the source of the transfer all the relevant info so  that
     the  source  could  make  a special entry in their xlatgen.ctl or
     whatever.  So it's not the potential  disaster  that  Shackleford
     implies. (I'm sure there will be a lot of loud screaming from the
     Mikeys of the world. Tough.)

     A  few  thoughts.  If  all of the Fidos in the world joined IFNA,
     they would have $25,000 to mess around  with  every  year.  As  a
     non-profit organization,  they'd have to do something appropriate
     with that money.  None of it should  be  spent  for  salaries  or
     anything  like that;  that's inappropriate,  and would be grounds
     for people to say "screw them".  However,  if the money was  used
     to  cover  phone bills of the hosts,  then it would make a LOT of
     sense.  Hosts are paying a disproportionate share of the load, as
     far as I can see;  if there are (say) 100 hosts, then they'd each
     get  $250/yr relief for their phone bills.  That's about the only
     useful thing I can see such a large amount of money used for.

     You might want to stick this letter in SYSOP or NET.  I'll  leave

     it up to you. I'm ambivalent about the whole thing.  I sure don't
     need the political headaches of taking an activist stance on this
     issue.  But  the most important thing is maintaining FidoNet as a
     viable mode of communication;  if the consensus  really  is  that
     $25/yr  will keep the net up,  then I'll happily pay it.  Keyword
     is CONSENSUS.  Changing from an open,  free  system  to  a  semi-
     controlled  system  in  midstream is fraught with peril.  (On the
     other hand, it might filter out the Mikeys and Traceys and Dobyns
     of the world.  Sadly,  it might ALSO filter out the Shacklefords.
     Oh well.)

     Grey Mist

                             Conference Report


     Hoo boy!  I'm tired!  Lots has happened in the past few  days,  I
     toured  Garden  of  the Gods,  went driving through the mountains
     (them suckers are bigger than Texas Hill Country,  a little)  and
     took a train ride up Pike's Peak.  I also found out that Echomail
     is a Fidonet Household word,  we  had  60-70  boards  represented
     there  and  during  my presentation I asked how many were running
     Echomail.  95% of them are!  (where do I begin?) The first night,
     things went well, I had arrived Wednesday night and played around
     until  the  first  session Thursday night.  My wife had made me a
     shirt with a  BIG  bullseye  on  it  and  the  words  "Echomail",
     "Creator"  on  it.  I  wore that into the meeting and quietly sat
     down near the front. I started hearing whispers and comments from
     behind,  some people laughing.  Thom Henderson  gave  an  opening
     speech  about  Fidonet  and  such,  and mentioned message traffic
     going up but didn't say why.  One guy  shouted  "Echomail!"  from
     the audience. They called for a round of applause for the success
     of Fido (Tom Jenning didn't show until Friday).  As it died down,
     someone  hollered,  "How about a round of applause for the author
     of Echomail?" Thom and the other people glanced  around  puzzled,
     and  then everyone around me started pointing at me and clapping.
     I slowly stood up and turned around to everyone and when I turned
     my back to the speaker podium,  I thought Ben Baker and Thom were
     going  to die!  They started making bow and arrow gestures at me.
     And so it went. Everyone seemed to want to talk to me, everywhere
     I went someone had a question or suggestion.  Pretty neat,  I had
     no  idea of the impact of Echomail.  I figured maybe 30-40% would
     have even heard of it,  which I thought was pretty good.  I got a
     slew  of  notes  for  improvements  in Echomail and a much better
     understanding of how it is used.  Some people NEED  to  host-rout
     Echomail, for example.

     My presentation of Echomail was shared with Rob Barker, author of
     an Editorial in SYSOP about the quality of messages and such.  He
     spoke  about  avoiding messages which mean nothing out of context
     of other messages, personal mail and such.

     Tom Jennings spoke about Fido v12,  due out the end of September,
     I  believe.  It is a major rework with area-specific capabilities
     lists,  'zones' to support growth of  the  nodelist  (1:124/206),
     1=USA, 2=UK.  It will also come with a professionally done manual
     for  $35  or  so,  cost  undetermined.  No  other  docs  will  be
     available,  you pay or you don't have docs.  There are  no  plans
     for charging for v12 itself, although a very firm distinction was
     made  between  IFNA  and  Fido Software Inc.  Tom Jennings is the
     sole owner,  officer,  etc.  of Fido Software,  Inc and may do or
     charge  anything  he  wishes.  If  he  wishes  to charge IFNA for
     additional code, then he may. IFNA will not be charging for v12.

     Everything went  smoothly  until  Saturday...  Then  things  blew
     apart!  Mikey  was  causing  troubling everytime I turned around.
     At the Business Meeting/Luncheon,  IFNA attempted to railroad us.
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  25 Aug 1986


     Now,  such  railroading  was  meant  in  good  intentions.  (I.E.
     Railroading is the performance of some act for or to someone else
     without their permission or control.  It says nothing  about  the
     act being good or bad for either party).

     George  Wing  waved the Articles of Confederation that Ken Kaplan
     had already filed to form IFNA and asked for a  confirming  vote.
     No discussion as to what IFNA meant, its rules, etc.  Oh, and the
     day  before,  we  were  offered  membership forms for $25 to join
     IFNA. If you did not pay, you can't vote in the business meeting.
     But at the luncheon, everyone was hollering and banging on tables
     and such.  Mikey wanted discussion,  wanted  to  know  what  IFNA
     intended to do,  etc.  George was flustered, Thom got quite angry
     etc.  George kept saying, "This is just Business BS, lets approve
     it and get on with the more important things.  We have  to  leave
     this  room in 35 minutes,  we don't have TIME to discuss it.  Its
     just lawyer BS,  you don't care about it." He was  shouted  down.
     He  had  called  for a vote without stating WHO could vote,  when
     asked he said,  "Well,  only those who  have  paid".  That  upset
     other people who wanted to pay,  but wanted to FIND OUT WHAT IFNA
     WAS FIRST.  Tom Jennings stated  that  these  people  (Ken,  Ben,
     etc.) had been running Fidonet for 2.5 years, and that they could
     keep  on  running  it.  Mikey wanted to expel Ken Kaplan from the
     Board of Directors (Ken Kaplan, Ben Baker and Thom Henderson,  3-
     member  board).  It  was suggested that they expand the board and
     George, etc.  just said, "Look.  Lets just confirm this paper and
     we  can change it later.  Once the paper is filed,  we can change
     any of the terms,  etc.  Its just a formality.",  but the problem
     was  the  paper didn't tell who could vote,  how to make changes,
     etc.  Without a framework for graceful  change,  relying  on  the
     good  will of the officers,  no one wanted to accept it.  And the
     officers were offended that no one would simply pay $25 and trust
     them to use the money/power with no strings.

     Anyway,  the meeting time went by without agreement and we had to
     adjourn  into the upstairs bar,  and clear the agenda of the rest
     of the day.  Tempers were flairing and things  were  pretty  bad.
     We tried to discuss in the bar and people still were interrupting
     and  hollering.  So  we  broke again and when we came back,  Ezra
     Shapiro of Byte was voted to be Chairman and to keep order.  Then
     we basically ran a VERY controlled meeting with votes  disallowed
     and  let  everyone who wanted to get up and make a speech and ask
     questions in an orderly fashion.  Facts  were  not  disputed  and
     such,  opinions  were allowed to be expressed without response to
     get the feelings out on  the  table.  After  1-2  hours  of  this
     blood-letting,  people  began  to change and stand up and confirm
     IFNA,  thanking them for running  Fidonet  this  well  for  these
     years.  Everyone  began  to have a better understanding of things
     and feelings.

     The three officers as INTERIM officers, with the power to draw up
     bylaws and a list of IFNA goals,  until Jan 1,  at which time  we
     will  have an election.  Until then,  an IFNA Echomail conference
     will be set up (initially in SYSOP) to discuss all the issues, so
     as to allow more time for discussion and to bring in those people
     who couldn't make the conference.  Everyone felt  better  and  we
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  25 Aug 1986


     went to the Flying W Ranch!

     The  $25 we paid was considered a contribution,  not a membership
     fee.  Anyone could ask for it back, but no one did that I saw.

     (Whew) It was all very exciting and yet very tiring too.  I would
     like to discuss this in the  next  SYSOP  PICNIC  (which  I  just
     missed).   John  Summers  was  there  as  was  a  friend  of  the
     Wintermute Creator from net 124.  (Durn!  Sorry, I can't think of
     his  name).  Three  sysops  were  from College Station,  and Jeff
     (Wintermute Creator) from Austin was there.  Overall,  Texas  was
     well represented.

     From 130/1, The AmERICan BBS, Sysop Eric Ewanco

         I have written a new utility that I  hope  many  Fido  sysops
     will  find of use.  I am engaged in EchoMail,  and I noticed many
     messages on there about message security in FidoNet.  I had  also
     thought  about  and read what others had to say about the lack of
     privacy in EchoMail.  Private messages in EchoMail  are  useless;
     not  only  can  all Sysops read them,  but even if they couldn't,
     they can ASCII dump the file.  So I wrote a  utility  to  encrypt
     Fido  form  messages  so  that  only  the  person  with the right
     decryption key can read them.

         The messages are encrypted in  this  fashion.  All  printable
     characters excluding the space are encrypted into other printable
     characters  excluding the space;  this is the range '!' (0x21) to
     '~' (0x7e).  Thus,  no message utility should barf due to strange
     non-printable  codes.  Hard  and  soft  carriage  returns are not
     encrypted. Originally, I encrypted spaces too, but found problems
     with SEAdog first with word wrapping and changed it.  The key can
     be as long as will fit on the command line and must contain  only
     the characters mentioned above,  lest the chars be encrypted into
     chars out of that range. You may use underscores for spaces. Case
     is sensitive. The parts of the message encrypted are the body and
     subject.

         MSGCRYPT is naturally compatible with EchoMail.  To do  this,
     the  encrypted  text  is  bracketed  with a start and end header.
     When decrypted,  any lines before the start marker and after  the
     end  marker  are not decrypted.  This goes ONLY for the body;  no
     such markers exist in the subject. The subject is only touched as
     far as I know  in  SEAdog  when  you  reply,  and  that's  before
     encryption.

         The encryption technique used in MSGCRYPT is not complicated,
     nor as simple as an XOR. The key is scanned and rescanned as many
     times  as  possible  to  relate one character of the key with one
     character of the message.  These are converted to be based to  0,
     then added and modulated to be within range.  A checksum of the 1
     compliments of the characters in the key  to  up  that  point  is
     made,  modulated, add to the current sum, which is then modulated
     and based to 33 again. This is the encrypted character.  It seems
     to be foolproof.

         MSGCRYPT is now undergoing beta testing;  but by the time you
     read this,  it will probably be released.  It  is  available  for
     SEAdog pickup as MSGCRYPT.ARC on 130/3; if you don't have SEAdog,
     drop me a note and I'll file attach and hold a message for you to
     poll.

         MSGCRYPT  will  be  distributed  under  the  same pretense as
     XLATLIST, ARC, LISTGEN, FIDO, etc.  etc.  etc.  Free to hobbiests
     (we're  all  freeloaders,  I  know)  but  a  small charge will be
     required of non-public users,  although I will trust them to  pay
     it  and not push anyone.  If you aren't required to pay for Fido,
     you won't be required to pay for MSGCRYPT.  I hope  many  of  you
     will have a use for this utility from 130/3.

     From node 130/3, The AmERICan BBS, Sysop Eric Ewanco

         I am 16 years old,  and I run a  very  respectable  board.  I
     recently  had a Commodore 64 user on (I know,  I usually feel the
     same way), a 14 year old woman,  and I got to know her well.  She
     told me that she had written some poems and I asked to read them.
     I  thought  that they were so good that I'd share them with a few
     thousand others,  and FidoNews provided the perfect way.  So here
     they are; two poems by Lorri Leigh Culp of Burleson, Texas.

                    DREAMS

         Once in a lifetime
         You have a dream
         The kind of man you've always
           wanted,
         The one you've never seen.

         You think of him
         You dream of him
         All you can do is stare
         He's the guy you've always wanted
         But now ... he isn't there.

           Dreams can carry you
           Dreams can kill
           Dreams can hurt
           'Til you get your fill

         You're in that fantasy
         No one can break
         Until that vital moment
         You some how wake

         They tear you apart
          inside out
         They say it was just a dream
         They tell you to forget
         But nothing can change what you
           think you have seen

         Picture yourself in a dream of
            mirrors
         Wondering where to turn.
         Picture yourself in a room of
            roses

         And wondering who will get burned.

         Seeing youself alone in the
            darkness
         Wondering what you'll see;
         Seeing youself in a room of
           sunlight
         Wondering what you'll be.


            Illusions are wonderful
            Illusions are great
            Illusions can make you wonder
            Is this my fate??

            Illusions are fantasies
            Illusions are real
            Illusions are touching
            What you can not feel.

         Picture yourself in a room with
           someone
         Fantasies on your mind;
         Picture yourself in a room alone
         And wondering what you'll find.

         Someone is there watching and
            waiting
         Waiting for you to arrive;
         But as you look back, deep in
           in your mind
         There are only signs of goodbye.

                Seagate - do you REALLY want their product?


     By now almost everyone who knows me knows  I  love  Seagate  disc
     drives  -  they are small,  relatively inexpensive,  low in power
     demand and easy on your mind because they are as  reliable  as  a
     pet rock.

     Did you ever wonder what happens if you need a part?

     My experience is that if you need a part there are lots of people
     who will sell you a whole drive, but NOBODY will sell you a small
     part.

     I  recently  bought a second ST-225 for my PC clone.  I bought it
     from someone I knew who had upgraded and had a nearly new  ST-225
     that  he  no longer needed.  I was glad to get it,  and the day I
     brought it home,  I took the case off the PC and installed it.  I
     made  an  error  or two,  which the vendor of my clone cheerfully
     helped me correct. The drive came up and ran.  I was happy.  Then
     one  day I cut power to the PC because of an electrical storm and
     the drive did not come up.  In the process of isolating the fault
     (which  turned  out  not  to be the drive),  on the advice of the
     Seagate folks I removed some terminating resistor packs from  the
     PC  board  on the drives.  Did not help any,  so I put everything
     back together and took the PC to the clone vendor,  who helped me
     isolate  a  problem to the controller,  and replaced the resistor
     pack that I had damaged with one from an in-stock  drive,  asking
     me to get him another.

     Well, I HAD HAD another, but it was on my desk and the cat got up
     there  and  it disappeared.  I thought "Well,  it is a small part
     that can't cost more than a buck or two,  we'll call Seagate  and
     see who sells them".

     So  I  called  Seagate and talked to a number of pleasant people,
     and was reassured that Hamilton-Avnet would sell me parts,  so  I
     called  a  Hamilton-Avnet  near  me and described the part to the
     nice person on the phone,  who told me that he would sell me  all
     the  disk  drives  at $350 each I wanted but would sell no parts.
     Further discussion ensued, and soon I was told that since I was a
     person and not a business he couldn't even sell me a  drive,  and
     he had no idea where I could get parts.

     I  called  Seagate back and was told that there must have been an
     error in understanding,  and that Hamilton-Avnet was the official
     distributor.  So  I  called Hamilton-Avnet in Pittsburgh with the
     same tale.  They were a bit nicer - they tried to find  the  part
     and  could  not,  but  said they could probably deal with me if I
     could get the Seagate part number.

     So I called Seagate back (sound familiar?) and explained what had
     transpired to another nice young lady,  who  recommended  that  I
     Fidonews                     Page 19                  25 Aug 1986


     call  the  repair facility that Seagate has in Florida.  I did so
     and was advised that the small parts would not be available  from
     anyone  but  Seagate since "Seagate has a monopoly on their small
     parts",  but I could buy them from the repair facility if  I  did
     not mind the $50 minimum order policy,  or they could sell me all
     the disk drives I wanted at $350 per.

     I was not then and am not now interested in paying 100 times  the
     value  of a part,  but may have to do that as I am honor bound to
     replace the part that was loaned to me.  Seagate's reputation for
     reliability is unparalleled and within the limits of my knowledge
     and experience the reputation is well founded.  It does not do my
     impression of the firm any good to  learn  that  no  matter  what
     breaks  if I can find the part at all it will cost me fifty bucks
     for another one.  I understand that there are costs involved with
     everything,  but I can remember a time when a vendor would simply
     throw a few such small parts in an envelope and send them out and
     mark it up to good will.  A firm in West Germany  has  done  that
     several times when I needed small parts for a model railroad.

     I  am willing to pay a reasonable amount,  and even put up with a
     certain amount of BS for being foolish enough to have  encroached
     on  the  sacred  body  of a disk drive,  although after almost 20
     years in hardware and software support for such firms as  Univac,
     Memorex  and Control Data I am more qualified than many so-called
     technicians I know.

     I STILL think that Seagate has the  best  disc  drive  going.  My
     opinion of that will probably not change.

     However, I'll never buy another one. Non-availability of parts is
     unconscionable.   Ridiculous   costs  and  open  admission  of  a
     monopolistic  policy  as  regards  parts  source  should  not  be
     tolerated.  Seagate  is  entitled  to a profit.  I am entitled to
     serviceability.  Counting all parts I could see,  there are  over
     120 discrete components. At $50 a crack, that is $6000 for a $350
     disc  drive.  And  yet I do not need another drive;  I have 2 and
     that is all I need.

     Perhaps this silliness was caused by some lower  level  personnel
     at  Seagate  flexing their muscle,  I do not know.  I hope that a
     monopolistic practice and a denial of parts  to  users  does  not
     represent the official policy of Seagate.

     Until I know for certain, I'll buy no more Seagate drives.

     I  encourage  all  of  you out in Fido-Land to consider doing the
     same.  If anyone asks why, show them this article.  If any of you
     know  anyone within the Seagate organization,  show them this and
     see what the reaction is - and please let me know via FidoMail at
     109/628.

     And if anyone has a spare terminating resistor pack for  a  price
     more reasonable that $50, I'll take it - my friend needs it.
