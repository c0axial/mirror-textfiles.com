                      Yes, Virginia, There is a Fidonet
                                  Doug Myers

     If the young girl who questioned whether there is a Santa Clause
     were around today, she might wonder if there's really a Fidonet.
     Her shiny new computer connects her to the World Wide Web at a
     moment's notice, but there is no place to click on Fido.  But her
     folks talk about a place where they laughed and played... is it just
     legend?

     Dear Virginia,

     So long as there are folks who can see with their imagination,
     there's a Fidonet.  The world you can see is a thing of beauty
     indeed, but sometimes you can miss the beauty when it's placed
     before your very eyes and you don't need to do anything to see it.
     The truest beauty is that of your mind, but it takes some work on
     your part to see it.

     Clicking on a web site is a fine way to see a car you want to buy,
     but to see a person, you need more than a picture.  You need to work
     at getting to know them.

     Fidonet is a place where you talk with only words.  The only picture
     you see of the people you talk with are the pictures they paint in
     your imagination with the words they write.  Though a photo of these
     folks may be beautiful indeed, the photo can seldom match the
     glimpse you'll get of their true beauty inside.

     More important, the beauty inside you will show as you become
     practiced at writing with them.  Though you may think you're
     ordinary, you'll find that the beauty of your imagination is beyond
     compare with the mere image of your skin.

     It's a mystery, perhaps, why written words can convey images more
     vivid than the camera hooked to your monitor... but maybe that's the
     reason people still read books even though cinema stories have been
     around for a long time.  Fidonet is the place where only written
     words are used, and yet some have never found a more vivid way to
     talk.

     Yes, Virginia... there is a Fidonet :)

                               Ol'WDB's Column

     Friendship is a strange thing...

      We find ourselves telling each other the deepest details of our
     lives...things we don't even share with our families. But what is a
     friend? A confidant? A lover? A shoulder to cry on? An ear to
     listen? A heart to feel? A friend is all of these things and more.
     No matter where we met, no matter how long we've been together...I
     call you a friend. A word so small, yet so large in feeling, a word
     filled with emotion, a word overflowing with love.

     Truly great things come in small packages. Once the package of
     friendship has been opened, it can never be closed. It is a constant
     book always waiting...waiting to be read...and enjoyed. We may have
     our disagreements...we may have our disappointments...we may
     argue...we may concern one another...friendship is a unique bond
     that lasts through all tribulations. A part of each of us goes into
     our friendships...our humor...our experiences...our tears.
     Friendships are foundations...necessary for life...and love.

     Friends...you and me...You brought another friend and then there
     were three...we started our group...our circle of friends...there is
     no beginning...there is no end. Even though I don't speak to you all
     everyday...or even as often as I would like to...You have all
     crossed my path of life, and mind... in one way or another...some of
     you I've only bumped into...some have walked a while with me... and
     some of you will continue to walk with me...

     But DON'T EVER THINK FOR A SECOND that since we aren't in constant
     contact...that I don't think of you all...almost everyday.  That
     memory puts a smile on my face and coffee in my cup as the sun rises
     each day. Thank you.

                                The Old Couple
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     The little old couple walked slowly into McDonalds that cold winter
     evening. He looked out of place amid the young families and young
     couples eating there that night.  Some of the customers looked
     admiringly at them. You could tell what the admirers were thinking.
     "Look, there is a couple who has been through a lot together,
     probably for 60 years or more!"

     The little old man walked right up to the cash register, placed his
     order with no hesitation and then paid for their meal.  The couple
     took a table near the back wall and started taking food off of the
     tray. There was one hamburger, one order of French fries and one
     drink. The little old man unwrapped the plain hamburger and
     carefully cut it in half.  He placed one half in front of his wife.
     Then he carefully counted out the French fries, divided them in two
     piles and neatly placed one pile in front of his wife.  He took a
     sip of the drink, his wife took a sip and then set the cup down
     between them.

     As the man began to eat his few bites of hamburger the crowd began
     to get restless. Again you could tell what they were thinking. "That
     poor old couple.  All they can afford is one meal for the two of
     them.  As the man began to eat his French fries one young man stood
     and came over to the old couples table.  He politely offered to buy
     another meal for the old couple to eat.  The old man replied that
     they were just fine. They were used to sharing everything.

     Then the crowd noticed that the little old lady hadn't eaten a bite.
     She just sat there watching her husband eat and occasionally taking
     turns sipping the drink.

     Again the young man came over and begged them to let him buy them
     something to eat. This time the lady explained that no, they were
     used to sharing everything together. As the little old man finished
     eating and was wiping his face neatly with a napkin the young man
     could stand it no longer. Again he came over to their table and
     offered to buy some food. After being politely refused again he
     finally asked a question of the little old lady.

     "Ma'am, why aren't you eating.  You said that you share everything.
     What is it that you are waiting for?"

     She answered, "the teeth".

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
