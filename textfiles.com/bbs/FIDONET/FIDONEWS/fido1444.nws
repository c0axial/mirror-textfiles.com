     I seem to have screwed up Gregg's story last week when taking his 66
     columns to 70. Sorry about that, Gregg. I made sure continuity
     remained when converting this week's from 66 to 70. You might just
     set your w/p to 70 and avoid future reformatting. [grin]

     I apologize for the late compilation of this week's Issue. It was my
     mother's birthday and all my LD lines were out for some odd reason. We
     had a tornado up the road yesterday and it may have taken out part of
     the trunks or the local switching. I always run polls to several
     Nodes before doing the FidoNews in case there are any last minute
     submissions or messages so it took awhile to get through.

     Who won the World Series? Oh, yeah, those redoubtable FLorida Marlins!
     Remember you heard it here first!

     Is it too soon to call the teams for the SuperBowl? Jacksonville
     Jaguars versus Dallas Cowboys? Maybe even those Detroit Lions will
     sneak in. [snicker]

     Nothing new otherwise.

     Hi, Christopher

     I am searching in various BBSes near my home, but I cannot find
     FidoNews.  I was a user of Ge-Link (2:332/243) BBS, now gone :-(, can
     you help me to find the recent issues of your newsletter on another
     BBS?

     I'm not point, and I'm not able to do any FReq at all.
     Many Hopeful Thanks :-))))

     I messed up!
     by Gregg Jennings, 1:331/109

     Dear FidoEditor;

     My piece, A BBS Story, was published in the last issue. Beyond the
     "role reversal" of the two characters midway in the story (blame is on
     Samuel Adams* Gregg, that's what I'd do), the story got wordwrapped by
     your software.

     Usually I read the instructions. I kept the right margin at less than
     70 (I used 66 for some bizarre reason...), but your software
     reformatted the lines, even merging a couple of lines.

     Just wanted to point that out (trying to save some face you see).

     (That was a lame attempt to draw attention away from me. Blame it on
     the Editor! Just kidding of course.)

     MY APOLOGIES to the good FidoPeople for making such a dumb mistake in
     my story, re: the two guys suddenly taking up opposite roles.
     Hopefully, if there was any point to the story it was not lost.

     (I don't feel too dumb... At least not enough to not ever submit an
     article again. You all have been warned!)

     * (footnote) "Samuel Adams" is a brand of beer, very good by the way.
     I don't know how widely marketed it is, hence this footnote.

     VOTE REQUIREMENTS
     =================

     Fidonews 1441 detailed the nomination process for the position of
     FTSC Administrator.  Nominations have now closed, and 2 eligible
     candidates are standing for election.  FTA-1001 provides for the
     following voting process for the FTSC Administrator:

     === Cut ===
       The FTSC Administrator is appointed on the basis of a vote by all
       Standing Members who are defined by the then-current edition of
       FTA-0003 (FTSC Membership List).  A successful candidate must
       receive approval by at least a plurality of votes.

       Publication of the nominations and the voting procedure shall
       take place openly in the FTSC_PUBLIC echo, and voting shall close
       three weeks after publication of the vote.  Votes shall be by
       netmail ballot to an independent enumerator.

       Plurality:   more votes than any other candidate, but less than
                    a majority.
     === Cut ===

     VOTING PROCEDURE
     ================

     FTSC Standing Members, and therefore eligible to vote, are as shown

     Bulletin Boards are online world's good old days

     1997, issue of the Montreal Gazette.  Forwarded to Fidonews by

     "Thanks to everyone who helped with my BBS article. Let's hope it
     helps the hobby. Every little bit helps.  "  --  Mark Stachiew, The
     Gazette

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

     Back in the Stone Age of computers, before Bill Gates had made his
     first million and the Internet had yet to see its first "spam"
     message, computer users talked with each other via Bulletin Board
     Systems (BBSes).

     While the World Wide Web has taken a bite out of the number of BBSes,
     they never really went away and now the old-timers who still use them
     are banding together to tell cyberspace newcomers what they're
     missing.

     A BBS is basically a computer sitting in someone's home running
     software which allows it to answer incoming calls. Other computer
     users call the BBS to exchange messages, play games and download
     computer programs. It really is an electronic bulletin board.

     They are usually free to call since the system is being run as a hobby
     by someone who is donating time and computer. No fancy browsers or
     hardware are required. The lowliest computer with a modem and terminal
     program will be enough to connect to a BBS.

     Longtime users of BBSes remain nostalgic about the early days of the
     FIDONEWS 14-44               Page 7                    3 Nov 1997


     1980s when the first home computers gave birth to the first fledgling
     bulletin boards. In those days BBS callers used glacially-slow 300
     baud modems with acoustic couplers that had to be fit over telephone
     handsets and looked like rubber earmuffs. They endured these hardships
     because of the magic that BBSes created. It was a new form of
     communication which allowed people to make contact with total
     strangers which sometimes developed into lifelong friendships.

     Lynda McCormick knows all about how BBSes bring people together. She
     runs one of the oldest ones in Montreal. McBBS has been in continuous
     operation since 1984 and people who called on the first day are still
     calling 13 years later. "Some of the old-time users will still call in
     long distance when they've moved away," she says. "Not on a regular
     basis, but it's fantastic to hear from them and hear how life is
     treating them now in Toronto, London, Ontario, Seattle, or L.A."

     McCormick is still enthusiastic about BBSing and is creating an online
     BBSing Museum with electronic ephemera from BBSes which have long
     since vanished into the ether. "The BBS scene in Montreal has been a
     very rich one with many characters, personalities and a few very
     hilarious stories," she says. "I for one would like to see it
     preserved and cherished as it should be, and not simply swept away and
     forgotten."

     One local BBS operator, Steve Monteith, has maintained a list of
     Montreal bulletin boards (www.vir.com/~capt_xerox/bbslist.html) for
     nearly 12 years. Looking over archives of the list demonstrate how
     much damage the Web has done to BBSing in this city. In 1989, Montreal
     boasted 175 computer bulletin boards. That number grew steadily,
     peaking at 482 in 1995 which is about the time that the Web began to
     blossom. Since then the number of BBSes has plummeted to 221. At that
     rate of decline they could be extinct in two years.

     So do BBSes have a future? The people who still use them think so.
     They persist because they create a sense of community among their
     users and because callers usually live in the same town, so they are
     able to get together offline where friendships are formed. That can be
     difficult on the Internet where you could be exchanging E-mail with
     someone in Zimbabwe or Kuala Lumpur.

     Monteith notes a few other advantages of the local BBS over the
     Internet. You won't get unwanted E-mail (spam) and BBSes are rarely
     commercial. "You can read through whole message bases, and not see an
     advertisement and you can be quite sure that your name on a BBS isn't
     going to be sold to some mailing list."

     An international grass-roots organization has sprung up to spread the
     word about BBSes. The Council for Online Community Alternatives(http:/
     /coca.home.ml.org) aims to promote BBSes as an alternative to the
     Internet and to build awareness among computer users that BBSes are
     available in their communities. They maintain that in recent years
     millions of people have rushed out to buy computers thinking their
     only online alternative was the Internet, oblivious to the existence
     of local BBSes.

     COCA likes to point out some of the advantages of BBSes. For example,
     FIDONEWS 14-44               Page 8                    3 Nov 1997


     at peak times the busy Internet can slow to a crawl. That isn't a
     problem on a BBS since there is usually only one user connected at a
     time so your new fast modem will actually work at full speed. Unlike
     most discussion groups on the Internet, the ones on BBSes are usually
     moderated and ill-tempered "flame" wars are less common. And
     pornography is much rarer on BBSes.

     BBSes are becoming more sophisticated. Many local BBSes now offer
     Internet E-mail and access to select Usenet newsgroups. Some have lots
     of downloadable files while others use flashy terminal programs which
     give them a graphical interface which is almost as easy to use as a
     Web browser. Some bulletin boards are even directly accessible over
     the Web, usually via telnet. You can find a list of other Internet
     BBSes at http://dkeep.com/sbi.html .

     I'd like to Start With a question from a Vladimir Gaitanoff from
     Russia.  The question is What software does he need to FREQ via the
     Internet?  I don't know so if anyone can help netmail or eMail the
     answer to me or Vladimir on vg@divo.ru .

     Secondly Astrowars has got a new address which is:

     Astrowar@2:258/69.69 .

     Here is the astrowar rules and info:

      What is AstroWar?

             AstroWar is a play-by-email game of space conquest.  What's so
             special about this particular game? From the player's view,
             it's simple and fun.  From the game moderator or sysop's view,
             it's fully automatic, adaptable, expandable, portable and
             free!  Bear with me while I justify some of these claims...

             It's simple:  The rules and construction of this game are as
             simple as I could make them.  There is just one type of
             planet, and one type of ship.  Each planet just has a single
             statistic: production, which decides how many ships it
             produces each turn.  Ships are just single faceless, nameless
             units which are used in greater or lesser numbers in order to
             overwhelm, hold back or discourage an enemy.

             It's fun:  How can I justify this?  Well, I can't really since
             it's just my opinion, but most of the players in the beta test
             games find it quite entertaining.  Its simplicity means that
             you won't spend much time learning the rules, and you'll be
             playing properly and developing your strategies almost
             immediately. It's hardly worth setting up a practice game.

             Playing the Game

             Getting Started

             AstroWar is a simple game of space conquest, usually played by
             email.  The simplicity of the rules mean that the time taken
             to learn the game is extremely short.  However, it may take
             just as long to develop a winning strategy as it does for more
             complex games.

             Let's take a look at the game rules before we go into details
             of how to play.  The map consists of a number of planets
             spread across a galactic map.  The number of planets and the
             size of the map are defined by the person running the game.
     FIDONEWS 14-44               Page 10                   3 Nov 1997


             There is only one type of planet, although each planet has a
             production rating.  This production rating reflects the number
             of ships that planet produces each turn, when it is owned by a
             player.  Neutral planets do not produce any ships.

             Ships are not treated individually in AstroWar.  There is only
             one type of ship, the variation being in the number of ships
             you send to the planets you are attacking.  Ships are sent in
             fleets of one or more ships, and each fleet's mission is
             decided by the number of ships sent, and the ownership of the
             planet the ships are being sent to.

             Part of the game's attraction lies in the high level of
             secrecy.  In some games, you can see the entire map when you
             start the game, and sometimes you can see where other empires
             are.  Some games are very open, and allow you to see as much
             detail about other players' empires as those players can see.

             This is not the case with AstroWar.  When you start playing
             AstroWar, you only see full details of your homeworld, and the
             positions of nearby planets.  To get more information, you
             must scout the planets you can see, and you must start to
             expand before you see planets further away.

             But I'm getting ahead of myself here, for before any of this
             becomes apparent you must first join a game.  In order to join
             a game, you must submit a 'join' request.  With this join
             request you give a name which will be used to identify your
             empire.  Your empire name can be up to 15 characters long.

             Upon successfully joining a game, you will receive
             confirmation that your request to join has been accepted.
             With this you will be given the name of your homeworld, that
             homeworld's details, and a map of nearby planets to get you
             started.  Note that homeworld planets always have a production
             of 15 ships per turn.

             There are a few cases in which a join request might fail.
             Firstly, you might choose an empire name which is already in
             use.  This is unlikely, but possible.  Another case in which a
             request to join might be rejected is when the game is full,
             i.e.  there are no planets which have not already been scouted
             or taken.  In the former case, just try to join again, with a
             different name.  In the latter case there's nothing you can
             do, except wait for the game to finish and re-start, or find
             another game.

             Scouting, Conquering and Redeployment

             The first thing you will want to do when you start a new game
             is scout one or more of the planets which were shown on your
             first map.  To scout a planet, simply send a single ship to
             it.  When the ship arrives, you will receive details about the
             production and ownership of that planet, along with the number
             of ships currently in orbit.  The scout ship will then turn
             around and begin the return journey.
     FIDONEWS 14-44               Page 11                   3 Nov 1997


             Once you have received details about some of the nearby
             planets, you should start making your attacks.  A fleet of 2
             or more ships sent to a neutral or enemy planet constitutes
             and attack force.  Generally, you should send more ships than
             are already in orbit around a planet if you wish to take it.
             However, you can send your attacks in two or more 'waves' if
             you don't have enough ships to take the planet straight away.
             The first arrivals will reduce the enemy's numbers, so that
             the later fleets have an easier job of taking the planet.  If
             a fleet takes a planet, it is disbanded, and the ships take up
             orbit around the planet.

             You can start making attacks before you scout, but this is not
             always a good idea, particularly if you are joining a game
             which has already been running for a number of turns.  For all
             you know, an attack fleet sent out 'blind' might be travelling
             towards a planet belonging to a relatively powerful empire,
             and this is not a good way to gain allies.

             Once you have more than one planet, you may want to start
             redistributing your forces, for more effective attacks or
             defense.  Sending any number of ships from one of your planets
             to another is a normal fleet movement.  When the fleet
             arrives, it will be disbanded and the ships will join those in
             orbit around the planet.

             -A Note About Fleet Movements---------------------------------
             A fleet does not start to move towards its destination until
             the turn after it is launched.  So, for instance, if you
             launch a fleet from one planet to a planet four squares away,
             it will still be four squares away on its first turn; only in
             the next turn will it start to move.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

             Requesting Details About Your Empire

             Although the reports you receive from scouting, attacking and
             fleet movements tell you everything you need to know about
             your planets, there are times when you will want reminding
             about various aspects of your empire.  There are a couple of
             reports which you can request from AstroWar, whenever you need
             them.

             The planet list contains a list of all your planets, together
             with a reminder of the planets' positions, their production
             ratings and the number of ships in orbit around them.  Only
             your own planets are included in this list; if you want up-to-
             date information about enemy or neutral planets you must scout
             them.

             -Turn Phases--------------------------------------------------
                 --There are four phases to each AstroWar turn: Fleet
                 movement, Order processing, Ship production and Victory
                 checking, executed in that order.  Bear this order in mind
                 when submitting orders; for example, a planet report (a
                 response to a 'planet list' order) will not take into
     FIDONEWS 14-44               Page 12                   3 Nov 1997


                 account the ship production which comes later in that
                 turn.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

             The fleet list contains a list of all your fleets, with a
             reminder of their planets of origin and their destinations.
             The list also contains the number of ships in the fleets, and
             their distances from their objectives.  You can use the
             distance figure to work out how long it will be before a fleet
             arrives.

             As your empire expands, you will want to be able to see more
             of the map.  This information isn't given to you
             automatically, you must request it using the map order.  When
             you submit a map order, you must give the name of a planet
             around which the map will be centred.  You can only centre a
             map around a planet you own, so in order to begin mapping the
             entire galaxy you must start expanding your empire.

             The Message System

             In order that you can communicate with other empires, to form
             alliances, make threats or gloat over victories, there is a
             message system which passes free-form messages between
             players.

             To write to another empire, simply submit a 'write' order,
             along with the name of the empire you wish to send to, and the
             text of the message.  Next turn, that empire will receive that
             message with the your empire name identified as the writer (in
             order that he or she can reply).

             It is also possible to write a general announcement to all
             empires.  This is not always a good idea.  Usually your empire
             will be unknown to others until they see your planets, or
             receive a message from you.  Secrecy itself may often be a
             useful weapon, but writing a message to all will immediately
             reveal your existence to everyone else in the game.  Later on
             in the game, if your empire becomes powerful, you could
             perhaps use this facility as a propaganda tool.

             Finally, it is also possible to write messages to the system,
             and receive messages from the system.  Although this has no
             use in the standard game, it is there as a way of
             communicating with add-ons.  Add-ons can scan for messages to
             the system and interpret their contents as extended orders to
             access features in that add-on.  Similarly, replies or
             information generated by add-ons will be addressed as coming
             from 'the system'.

             Winning the Game

             The standard victory conditions dictate that the empire who
             owns everybody else's homeworlds wins the game.  This is a
             change from the usual condition of conquering all of everyone
             else's planets, since that condition usually results in a
     FIDONEWS 14-44               Page 13                   3 Nov 1997


             tedious end game where the eventual victor has to mop up the
             remains of defeated empires.

             One problem is that enemy homeworlds are not identified.  You
             can assume that, in a normal game, all the homeworlds will
             have a production of 15 ships per turn.  However, not all
             planets with this production are homeworlds.  You just have to
             hunt out all the non-neutral planets with 15 production until
             you are awarded victory.

             When victory is awarded to a player, a report is sent out to
             everyone saying who the winner is.  However, the game must be
             manually stopped and restarted by the person running the game,
             so it is possible that a few turns may go by with the
             'victory' message being sent out.

             It is quite possible that victory conditions in a game have
             been disabled, making it 'open-ended'.  This means that the
             game will continue indefinitely. Our Games is Open-Ended.

             Resigning Your Position

             Once your position has become unworkable, or you want to quit
             the game for some other reason like lack of time, there is a
             'resign' command you can use.  Resigning from a game will
             cause all your planets to revert to neutral status, and will
             make all in-transit fleets wink out of existence.

             If you are going to have to stop playing a game, it's polite
             to resign properly.  If you just let your fleets build up
             uselessly, it will get in the way of legitimate players and
             ruin their enjoyment of the game.

             Orders

             This section gives a list of orders understood by the order
             processing phase of turn processing. To send an order send a
             netmail TO: Astrowar@2:258/69.69 with the SUBJECT:GAME1 and in
             the main body type one off the commands:

                 join <empire>       A join order, or join request, asking
                                     that a player be added to the game
                                     with the empire name <empire>.

                 send <n> <o> <d>    A send order.  Orders a launch of <n>

     Diary of an AOL user

     July 18 - I just tried to connect to America Online. I've heard it is
     the best online service I can get. They even included a free disk! I'd
     better hold onto it in case they don't ever send me another one! I
     can't connect. I don't know what is wrong.

     July 19 - Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs a
     modem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he
     think I am?

     July 22 - I bought the modem. I couldn't figure out where it goes. It
     wouldn't fit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused.

     July 23 - I finally got the modem in and hooked it up. That nine year
     old next door did it for me. But it still won't work. I can't get
     online.

     July 25 - That nine year old kid next door hooked me up to America
     Online.  He's so smart. I told the kid he was a prodigy. But he says
     that's just another service. What a modest kid. He's so smart and he
     does these services for people. Anyway he's smarter than the jerks who
     sold me the modem. They didn't even tell me about communications
     software. Bet they didn't know. And why do they put two telephone jack
     holes in the back of a modem when you only need one? And why do they
     have one labeled phone when you are not suppose to hook it to the
     phone jack on the wall? I thought the dial tone sounded funny!  Boy,
     are modem makers dumb! But the kid figured it out by the sound.

     July 26 - What's the internet? I thought I was on America Online. Not
     this internet thing. I'm confused.

     July 27 - The nine year old kid next door showed me how to use this
     America Online stuff. I told him he must be a genius. He says that he
     is compared to me. Maybe he's not so modest after all.

     July 28 - I tried to use chat today. I tried to talk into my computer
     but nothing happened.  Maybe I need to buy a microphone.

     July 29 - I found this thing called usenet. I got out of it because
     FIDONEWS 14-44               Page 17                   3 Nov 1997


     I'm connected to America Online not usenet.

     July 30 - These people in this usenet thing keep using capital
     letters.  How do they do that? I never figured out how to type capital
     letters. Maybe they have a different type of keyboard.

     JULY 31 - I CALLED THE COMPUTER MAKER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO COMPLAIN
     ABOUT NOT HAVING A CAPITOL LETTER KEY. THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID IT
     WAS THIS CAPS LOCK KEY.  WHY DIDN'T THEY SPELL IT OUT? I TOLD HIM I
     GOT A CHEAP KEYBOARD AND WANTED A BETTER ONE. AND ONE OF MY SHIFT KEYS
     ISN'T THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER. HE SAID THAT'S A STANDARD. I TOLD
     HIM I DIDN'T WANT A STANDARD KEYBOARD BUT ANOTHER BRAND.  I MUST HAVE
     HAD AN IMPORTANT COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HEARD HIM TELL THE OTHER SUPPORT
     GUYS TO LISTEN IN ON OUR CONVERSATION.

     AUGUST 1 - I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT
     IT CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS
     ABOUT THE INTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON.

     AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS
     JOKE ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER
     SIDE! HA! HA! I WASN'T SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE
     TIMES.

     AUGUST 3 - I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. I DIDN'T KNOW
     SPIDERS GREW THAT LARGE.

     AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS
     RUDE. I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO
     REC.HUMOR.ORACLE. I WASN'T SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22
     MORE TIMES.

     AUGUST 5 - SOMEONE TOLD ME TO READ THE FAQ. GEEZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO
     USE PROFANITY.

     AUGUST 6 - SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME TO STOP SHOUTING IN ALL MY MESSAGES.
     WHAT A STUPID JERK.  I'M NOT SHOUTING!  I'M NOT EVEN TALKING!  JUST
     TYPING!  HOW CAN THEY LET THESE RUDE JERKS GO ON THE INTERNET?

     August 7 - Why have a Caps Lock key if you're not suppose to use it?
     Its probably an extra feature that costs more money.

     August 8 - I just read this post called make money fast. I'm so
     excited.  I'm going to make lots of money. I followed his instructions
     and posted it to every newsgroup I could find.

     August 9 - I just made my signature file. Its only 6 pages long. I
     will have to work on it some more.

     August 10 - I just looked at a group called alt.AOL.sucks. I read a
     few posts and I really believe that AOL should be wiped off the face
     of the earth. I wonder what an AOL is.

     August 11 - I was asking where to find some information about
     something.  Some guy told me to check out ftp.netcom.com. I've looked
     and looked but I can't find that group.
     FIDONEWS 14-44               Page 18                   3 Nov 1997


     August 12 - I sent a post to every usenet group on the Internet asking
     where the ftp.netcom.com is.  Hopefully someone will help. I can't ask
     the kid next door. His parents said that when he comes back from my
     house he's laughing so hard he can't eat or sleep or do his homework.
     So they won't let him come over anymore. I do have a great sense of
     humor. I don't know why the rec.humor group didn't like my chicken
     joke. Maybe they only like dirty stuff. Some people sent me posts
     about my 56 posts of the joke and they used bad words.

     August 13 - I sent another post to every usenet group on the Internet
     asking where the ftp.netcom.com is. I had forgot yesterday to include
     my new signature file which is only 8 pages long. I know everyone will
     want to read my favorite poem so I included it. I'm also going to add
     that short story I like.

     August 14 - America Online is a local call! So, since I do not have to
     call long distance, I decided to just leave it on so I won't get
     anymore busy signals!

     August 24 - My computer froze up a few days ago. Since I could not
     choose "Shut down", I left it alone, waiting for it to unfreeze. Today
     my wife unplugged it so she could vacuum, and now it works!

     August 25 - America Online canceled my account, saying my Visa card
     would not accept the bill. They say the bill was for three hundred
     dollars.  I can't figure it out?

     August 26 - America Online must want me to join up again, because they
     sent me another disk in the mail today! I will call later!
