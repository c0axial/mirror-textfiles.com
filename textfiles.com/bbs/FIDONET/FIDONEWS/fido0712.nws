     You Love State Socialism (You just don't know it)
     Tom Jennings 1:125/111

     The essay below speaks for itself. It's not an exercise in
     commie-bashing, in case you were wondering. Taken from a book of
     essays written by Miklos Haraszti, a Hungarian dissident, it is
     on the surface a harsh criticism of state socialism, told in
     terms of western capitalism.

     (The manuscript for the book was smuggled out of Hungary, to be
     published first in France as "L'artiste d'Etat" then as "The
     Velvet Prison: Artists Under State Socialism" in the U.S. (Basic
     Books Inc, New York).)

                              *  *  *

     "Outside the capitalist corporation's walls there is still an
     ideal free market where total freedom of opinion and speech, the
     right to assembly, and the freedom to organize flourish. Everyone
     goes his own way and can become a proud and independent artist,
     free of censorship. But inside the company it is a different
     story. There; the employee must reckon with a microcosm of
     socialism. His human rights are severely circumscribed -- except
     of course, his right to work. He cannot go outside the walls,
     cannot wander at will around the factory, cannot say, write or
     organize whatever he wants. In these matters, it is the firm's
     interests, conveyed by its owners and managers, that determine
     right from wrong within the corporate culture. The employee may
     love his work, but he cannot do what he likes *unless* his ideas
     have first been approved by his superiors. His skills have no
     value in themselves; they exists to sustain the fiscal health of
     the corporation. His relations with other members of the company
     are not strictly private; they are defined by the hierarchy of
     professional skills. If he does not live for his work, the
     company will let him go. As long as there are other corporations
     for whom he can work, he is all right, even if he is fired. He
     could even, if he wishes, leave of his own accord!

     "How is this (admittedly simplified) state of affairs different
     from state socialism? Only one aspect is truly different: the
     existence of other companies. Under socialism it is the same
     giant firm everywhere.

     "Suppose that the company for which you work buys and sells art.
     The board of directors, faithful to the owner's wishes, seeks
     free and independent art. Anyone can come in from the street. If
     his art is marketable, the whole company will work for him; no
     one will intervene in his business. If his artistic freedom is
     curtailed, he can threaten to leave the company and look for
     another, or he can choose to become self-employed.

     FidoNews 7-12                Page 6                   19 Mar 1990


     "Now consider the free artist who is asked by the company to
     paint a portrait of the owner, or to create a sculpture that
     symbolizes the company's ideals, or simply say something nice
     about the firm on television. The money he is paid is not a part
     of profits; it is renumeration for having complied with the ideas
     of the firm's management. Creative freedom has undergone a subtle
     change: the more successfully the artist has identified himself
     and his ideas with the interests of management, the more creative
     freedom he can retain. He has become a *directed artist*. He has
     become a company artist.

     "How is this state of affairs different from socialism? Only to
     the extent that, under capitalism, the artist is free to resign
     and go to another company. On our part of the world artists can
     only find employment with the artistic department of the national
     company or with one if its branches. All artists are the firm's
     employees, and their colleagues (the other employees in other
     departments and branches) are their audience.

     "The distinction between directed and free artists, between
     directed and free art, disappears at a stroke. The artists'
     existential uncertainty is over. A steady paycheck is assured.
     The rent will be paid, food on the table, and a roof overhead.
     But artists' creative freedom is also over. Nevertheless they
     have gained a great deal: by becoming state employees they are
     given special attention. Their position is not competitive but
     hierarchical: they gain a measure of control over the consumers
     of their art in exchange for being controlled themselves by the
     coordinating authority of the state. The company's neutrality in
     the thorny question of aesthetics is over.

     "The ethics of state socialism resemble the ethics of a large
     company. Its discipline and freedom are like those of the
     company's workers. Further, if you will imagine the greatest
     possible "industrial democracy" that such a concern might achieve
     within the constraints of its corporate culture, you will have
     arrived at an almost exact model of freedom in today's modern
     socialist society.

     "Is it censorship that guarantees that the employees of Twentieth
     Century Fox will create movies that serve the interests of the
     entire company? Do relationships within the film studio require
     censoring? Is the unavoidable process of creative compromise and
     self-correction properly called censorship? Voluntary discipline,
     identification, and devotion are essential elements in the
     professional's acceptance of the company as his own/ Is this not
     freedom? After all, didn't someone once observe that freedom is
     simply the recognition of necessity?

     "It does not matter whether the answer is yes or no: we know what
     this is all about. This form of censorship is far more effective
     than a negative, externally imposed restriction of private
     freedom. It is quite irresistible when it bathes the employees of
     the socialist supermonopoly -- the nation -- in its amniotic
     warmth. Don't forget: under socialism, there are no longer any
     owners."

     DADS ECHO
     by Bob Hirschfeld, Moderator
     (Sysop of National Congress for Men BBS 114/74 (602) 840 4752 )

     The National Congress for Men, a coalition of Fathers Rights and
     Divorce Reform organizations founded in 1981, is sponsoring the
     new DADS ECHO. NCM, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, has an
     elected board of directors, holds annual national conventions,
     provides resources for DADS nationwide, and is active in lobbying
     Congress and state legislatures regarding parental access and
     support issues.

     DADS Echo is primarily focused on the relationship between DADS
     and their children. This is not limited to any category of DAD;
     that is, happily (or unhappily) married DADS, unwed DADS,
     Divorced DADS, adoptive DADS.....and women who sympathize with
     them and the needs of children for relationships with BOTH
     parents, are welcome to participate.

     Messages on DADS ECHO deal with DADS' difficulties in dealing
     with or preserving "The Promise of Fatherhood". As such, messages
     dealing with all aspects of Fathers' Rights as they relate to
     children, are fair game. That is: Divorce upsets the
     relationship; the relationship includes a financial
     responsibility as well as a psychological/emotional bond;
     allegations of child abuse (true or false) can adversely impact
     the father-child relationship, etc.

     Subjects that the DADS Echo is especially intended to address
     differ from the focus of other Fidonet Echos:

     *** Parenting Skills
     *** Role Reversal, Gender Stereotyping: "Superdads" and "Mr. Mom"
     *** Homemaking Skills: the Father's viewpoint
     *** Psychological Bonding between fathers and children
     *** Recreation involving fathers and children
     *** Scouting (Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Indian Guides, Campfire)
     *** Dealing with problem children at various ages
     *** Dealing with government agencies regarding children
     *** Prenatal and Delivery-Room participation by DADS
     *** The Father's relationship with his unborn child
     *** Historical perspective of Fathers and Paternal Status
     *** Strengthening the nuclear family
     *** Sex Education of children
     *** Education generally; the father's participation
     *** Care of infants
     *** Self Esteem, Transactional Analysis of Relationships, etc.
     *** DADS special problems raising children alone
     *** Distance isolation between DADS and children
     *** Parental Alienation Syndrome
     *** Dealing with 3rd-party interference in father-child relations
     *** Teaching DAD'S values to the child
     *** Father-bashing in the legislatures and courts
     *** Experience-sharing between DADS who've been there
     *** Discipline of children; what is reasonable, who does it?
     *** Resources available to DADS
     FidoNews 7-12                Page 9                   19 Mar 1990


     *** Nearly-adult teenagers: leaving the nest
     *** Effect of divorced dads new female relationships on children
     *** Step-parenting
     *** AND MUCH MORE

     Moderator Bob Hirschfeld is an attorney in Phoenix, AZ who
     specializes in representing Fathers in contested custody cases. A
     long-time Fathers Rights activist and NCM board member, he
     published "Single Dads Lifestyle" magazine between 1978 and 1983

     DADS initially is distributed by direct polling of the NCM BBS,
     114/74, and at this writing reaches Texas and Tennessee as well
     as area 114 (Arizona) distribution. Once there is enough
     coverage, it is intended that permission to place DADS on the
     backbone will be obtained.

     There are other Echos available for "flaming", such as LAW,
     FEMINISM, MENS_ISSUES, RIGHTS (Men's Rights). Please use this
     Echo for constructive, topical messages. If you're a divorced
     Dad, you're probably legitimately angry about some aspect of how
     the system treats you. But you're sharing this Echo, hopefully,
     with happily married DADS, or DADS for whom the anger has
     subsided and the challenge of promoting/maintaining the
     father/child bond is now of major importance. Keep that in mind,
     please.

     at 114/74, so that DADS can be picked up by you via subsequent
     periodic polling. In genuine hardship situations, NCM may be
     willing to bear the long distance cost to your BBS initially
     until backbone status is obtained. This Echo offers hope to
     Fathers separated or alienated from their children, and practical
     help to that great majority of responsible Dads who want to
     continue and improve their relationships with their children.
     Therefore, please consider providing this echo to users of your
     local BBS.

     PATERNALLY and FRATERNALLY,
     BOB HIRSCHFELD, MODERATOR, DADS ECHO 114/74 (602) 840 4752

     The Art of Deception --

     SQL and C.  What do they have in common ?  SQL is the 4-GL
     language for database manipulation.  C is the 3-GL language of
     systems and applications programmers.  Both provide a
     convenient means of deceiving management, and especially IM
     departments.

     C is really ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE in disguise.  Management doesn't
     want you coding in assembler, but C is OK because it's a 3-GL
     language.  SQL is how user's maintain programming control over
     their database systems; while IM thinks it's in control because
     it has control of the 3-GL languages.  SQL is an effective tool
     because our databases are organized for SQL.

     We get away with these white lies because a) management and IM
     really don't know what's going on;  b) the user community is
     really pretty sharp; c) both a and b.


     "Plug Away" --

     I'll steal this SNL theme for a while.  I have completed,
     somewhat, a new Call Statistics Reporter utility, it's called
     CallStat, and you can get the program and source by f'req. :
     namely CFL.ZIP.

     I needed something to tell me how well I was doing in my attempt
     to slow down Bink's call timer.  I was making over 400 calls
     per day.  I know you do, but I don't.

     Any way, it's got some bells and whistles, writes message
     format reports, and tells you about individual nodes, and hours
     in the day. Net 124 has a Machine echo, specifically for those
     computer generated kinds of info that vaguely interests the
     human members of the network.

     So far I've seen :

     TICKET V1.20    RFP 2.03        ANALYZE V1.1
     QMLog v0.03     QUPDN v4.0      CallStat v3.3

     FidoNews 7-12                Page 11                  19 Mar 1990


     Ron Bemis has a large suite of utilities under the ANALYZE
     moniker, and credit for the Machine echo goes to him.  I am
     looking forward to the computer reading of these echoes for
     some kind of consolation reporting.

     This is the network, in and of itself.


     Interface 90 --

     Dallas, TX.  What happened to OSI ?  The Interface 90 expo was
     dotted with conferences on OSI, yet there was only 1 vendor with
     an OSI product.  I find this somewhat misleading.  IBM spends
     more on OSI research than all other players combined.  I find
     this totally misleading.

     One could argue that OSI is very active, but the big players
     have taken over and that's that.  Another point of view is that
     OSI itself is free ( it's CCITT and it's public domain ).  A
     company can't make money selling OSI, just like you wouldn't
     normally pay for breathing air.  You to sell completely
     vertical applications, off the shelf.

     This alone has brought the cost of direct OSI connects down to
     the point that the 'PAD' facilities are not cost effective.

     I think it's very revealing to find the big manufactures with
     the big OSI networks forcing it's suppliers to use OSI
     protocols for all communications, including filling orders.  If
     you can't 'talk' to me, you can't *talk* to me.  Look out for
     'old-boy'-ism.



     Tax Time, Honey --

     Do you know the Number 1 tax shelter for the past 9 years ?
     Sure, it's the Foreign Earned Income Deduction.  This is HOT.

     If you earn income while physically present in a foreign
     country, and you stay out of country 330 days out of 365, the
     IRS gives you a whopping $ 75,000 deduction.  Notice the words
     "physically present".

     This is a bunch different than the bona fide residence criteria.
     You don't want to become a resident of a foreign country
     because then you will surely have to pay income tax there, and
     that's a whole lot more expensive than here.

     The earnings can come from anywhere.  So here's what you do :
     get a 1 year project, buy a laptop, and see the world.  Don't
     stay in any one country too long, and send completed works back
     via modem.
