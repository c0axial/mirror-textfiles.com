   We seem to be into spring again, with the snooze being quite
slim as a result.  It must be that fact that the students in
Fidonet all head off to summer jobs; we always have a dearth
of articles at this time of year.

   Since there is little to fight about at the moment, here is
the snooze.  ;<)

Downpour of Media Cliches Threatens To Flood Nation
By Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon
Media Beat

We interrupt this newspaper for a special bulletin! A media flood
warning is now in effect for the entire United States.

A torrential January storm continues to dump large quantities of media
cliches on the American public. And the floodwaters are still rising.

But there's nothing natural about the current downpour of political
cliches. In recent years a lot of work has gone into seeding the
clouds. The new speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, has described his
goal as "reshaping the entire nation through the news media."

You can assume that the media climate is backing up the sewers when the
same cliche appears on the covers of the country's two biggest news
weeklies. That's what happened with the Jan. 9 editions of Time
magazine ("Exclusive: How Gingrich plans to pull off his revolution")
and Newsweek ("Gingrich's Revolution").

Which brings us to the most popular -- and possibly weirdest -- media
cliche of the year so far:

"Revolution"

The news media can't seem to stop using the word "revolution" to
describe the activities of Gingrich and fellow Republicans. Our Nexis
computer search found that -- during the first 10 days of this year --
U.S. newspapers used "revolution" in over 270 articles while reporting
on Gingrich.

No longer able to utilize the worn-out description of Gingrich as a
"bomb-throwing backbencher," the news media now insist that he is
leading a "revolution."

If the Republicans are igniting a "revolution," it must be the first
one in world history aimed at giving the entrenched interests that run
the country still more entrenched power.

FidoNews 12-21                 Page:  3                    22 May 1995

Since when is it a "revolution" to make things even more cushy for the
wealthy and powerful, while making the rest of us even more vulnerable
to their prerogatives?

"Big government"

We keep being told that the Republicans are sworn foes of "big
government,"  determined  to  downsize  and  eliminate  federal
bureaucracies. Our computerized search found references to Gingrich and
"big government" in 61 newspaper articles during the first 10 days of
January.

But news reports on "big government" virtually ignore the most costly
and wasteful federal bureaucracy -- the Defense Department -- spending
$270 billion this year on the military (almost as much as the amount
spent by the rest of the world combined). President Clinton has urged a
hefty increase, and the new GOP majority in Congress wants to hike the
department's budget even more.

A rarely mentioned fact is that the Pentagon purchases two-thirds of
the U.S. government's goods and services. And it issues 70 percent of
all federal paychecks.

But when was the last time you heard a media outlet mention the
Pentagon in a discussion of deplorable "big government"?

And when was the last time you saw a tough national news report on the
F-22  fighter jet, which moves forward even though the General
Accounting Office concluded that it is now unneeded and should be put
off? The jets are to be assembled by Lockheed, adjacent to Gingrich's
congressional district in Georgia.

"Middle class"

This one is an old standby, but it has gained renewed currency in
recent weeks as the Republican and Democratic parties battle to don the
mantle of champion for the "middle class." But who, precisely, is part
of the "middle class"?

To hear many politicians -- and journalists -- tell it, the "middle
class" is just about anyone who isn't below the official poverty line
and doesn't qualify as a millionaire.

Reporting from Southern California in 1993, under the headline "GOP
Blitz Against Budget Puts Democrats on Defensive", the New York Times
explained on its front page that President Clinton was not offering
much to "people earning more than $115,000, which is middle class in
this high-cost region." Six figures a year, and part of the beleaguered
middle class.

"Reform"

Of all the cosmetic buzzwords applied by American journalists and
pundits, none is more opaque than "reform." It means, simply, a
favorable gloss for any change of government policy in any direction --
FidoNews 12-21                 Page:  4                    22 May 1995

even if it involves the undoing of genuine reforms.

Our forecast for this political season calls for continued rhetorical
downpours, heavy at times, with only occasional periods of clarity.

But don't despair -- and don't worry about carrying a rhetoric-proof
umbrella. Once you decode the main cliches, the torrents of media
blather will roll off you like water off a duck's back.

Here is the latest information about our upcoming Information Warfare
Conference;
please redistribute this information widely:

                  InfoWarCon '95
               September 7-8, 1995

                  Arlington, VA

CONFERENCE OVERVIEW

The Information Warfare Conference (InfoWarCon 95) is our third
international conference dedicated to the exchange of ideas,
policies, tactics, weapons, methodologies and defensive posture
of Information Warfare on a local, national, and global basis.

InfoWarCon will bring together international experts from a broad
range of disciplines to discuss and integrate concepts in this
rapidly evolving field.  Attendees will intensely interact with
the speakers and presenters as well as each other to increase each
other's understanding of the interrelatedness of the topics.

While there are many interpretations of Information Warfare by
different groups, the current working definition we employ is:

"Information Warfare is the use of information and information systems
as weapons in a conflict where information and information systems
are the targets".

Information Warfare is broken down into three categories, and
InfoWarCon speakers and attendees will interactively examine them all:

Class I:  Personal Privacy.  "In CyberSpace, You Are Guilty Until
Proven Innocent." The mass psychology of information.  Privacy
FidoNews 12-21                 Page:  5                    22 May 1995

versus stability and law enforcement.

Class II: Industrial and Economic Espionage.  Domestic and international
ramifications and postures in a globally networked, competitive society.

Class III: Global Information Warfare.  Nation-state versus Nation-state
as an alternative to conventional warfare, the military perspective and
terrorism.

DAY I: Thursday, September 7, 1995

7:00 - 7:45    Continental Breakfast

7:45 - 8:00    Introductory Remarks:
                 - Peter Tippett, NCSA
                 - Robert Steele, OSS
                 - Winn Schwartau, Interpact

8:00 - 8:30    Keynote Address (TBD)

                Morning Plenaries

"What Is Information Warfare?"

There is no consensus as to what Information Warfare means; everyone
has  a different definition and application which often suits specific
agendas.   The morning sessions are to provide attendees with a current
review of what Information Warfare means to different people.

8:30 - 9:30    "The Government Perspective"

How do the various military services see Information Warfare as
fitting within their needs and mission?  Moving information rapidly
and efficiently to the modern soldier provides key battlefield
advantage. How does lethal versus non-lethal warfare fit into their
models?

9:30 - 10:30   "The Commercial View"

The commercial sector sees Information Warfare from a different
perspective.  Business survival is top on the list.  How do private
sector leaders view Information Warfare from both a defensive and
offensive standpoint?  Government attendees will be especially
interested  in this session.

10:30 - 11:00   Morning Coffee Break

11:00 - 12:00   Breakout Sessions I

        Class I  "Anti-Privacy Technology"

This will be a hands-on demonstration of how to breach personal privacy,

bug and eavesdrop on individuals and corporations.  Attendees will see
how easy it is to violate privacy, and how hard it is to detect such
violations.

        Class II: "Industrial and Economic Espionage - An Update"

What's new in the world or private spying?  Front line experts will
what's better and what's worse.  Who's spying on whom?  What are they
looking for?  What are their techniques and tools?  What can you do
to protect your organization from being a victim?

           Moderator: Jim Settle
                        Former head of Natl. Computer Crime Squad, FBI

                     - Larry Watson, DECA, FBI

        Class III  "Magnetic Weapon Systems: Risks and Defenses"

The first half will present an overview of the risks of HERF Guns,
EMP/T  Bombs and Magnetic Pulse Cannons (MPC).  The attendee will
learn how easy  they are to build, and why increasingly sophisticated
magnetic weapons  will become a choice weapon for terrorists.  The
second half will describe fundamental approaches to defensive postures
against such Class  3 Denial of Service Assaults.

        - Don White, EMC

12:00 - 13:30   Working Lunch

        Luncheon Speech 12:30 - 13:00  (TBD)

13:30 - 14:30 Breakout Sessions I

         Class I   "Well Managed Propaganda"

The media is a powerful filter by which citizens and the government
collect most of their information.  Was the media a puppet of the US
in the Gulf War?  Does aggressive PR makes media policy?  How can the
media  be used, or protect itself from being used?  What do journalists
have to say about their apparent control over what people hear and see?

        Moderated by:  Neil Munro, Senior Editor, Washington Technology

Class II     "Should the US Spy on the World?"

The US has been the target of economic and indutrial espionage by
military allies and 'friendly' competitors such as France, Japan,
Korea, Israel, Germany, Taiwan among others.  With an estimated
intelligence budget of $30 Billion and arguably the most proliferate
and advanced technologies, should we turn our spying 'eyes' on our
global neighbors for the benefit of American economic security?  Or,
are Mom and Apple Pie Americans above that?

Class III    "Practicing Defensive Information Warfare"
               Military lessons for the private sector

This exciting session will show 'real time' security testing with an
active Internet connection.  The military has developed an arsonal of
tools for penetration and monitoring and alerting users about
intrusions. Commercial attendees will learn what life is like without
these mechanisms, and how much more secure they can be with them -
with a low increase in overhead.  What steps are required to build a
defensive posture, and just how much defense is enough?

14:30 - 15:00  Afternoon Coffee Break

FidoNews 12-21                 Page:  8                    22 May 1995

       Afternoon Plenaries

15:00 - 15:30    "Denial of Service on Information Systems"

Confidentiality Availability and Integrity, two of the three
pinions of security have been technically solved with advanced
encryption techniques.  The third aspect, Availability remains
unsolved because of daunting technical problems.  What do DOS
attacks look like? From the  Civil-Cyber Disobedience to Accidental
Acts God or Man, a failure of key  system components can trigger a
domino-like chain of collapses.  This  sessions examines the
vulnerability of current US infrastructures and the  application
such techniques in offensive military applications.

15:30 - 16:00   "Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism"

Terrorist attacks against the US are now occurring on our home ground.
What can the modern terrorist do which will meet his goals of sowing
fear and distrust?  Key infrastructures such as power grids,
communications and transportation systems are attractive targets for
the terrorist minded Information Warrior. What are we doing in planned
response?

16:00-17:00     "What Is the Role of Government in defending  National

                    Economies?"

As evolving global conditions shift competitive value from military
might to economic advantage, how should we redefine national security?
The threats to the private sector increase and become more likely
targets in information warfare of all three classes.  What is, and what
should the  role of the military be in defending US interests both
domestically and abroad?  This session will provide plenty of time for
audience  involvement.

17:00 - 19:00    Cocktail Reception

Most speakers will be available for more intimate groups chats,and
authors will be available to sign books.  Great opportunity to pursue
those ideas with people from different disciplines.

19:00 - 21:00    Birds of a Feather Dinners

"Dutch" dinners give attendees the chance to dig into more and more
depth  in areas of their particular interest.

  * * * * *

    DAY II: Friday, September 8, 1995

7:00 - 8:00   Continental Breakfast

8:00 - 8:30    Keynote II (TBD)

8:30 - 9:00      "Defending the Financial Infrastructure"
FidoNews 12-21                 Page:  9                    22 May 1995


Not only the US is concerned.  The world's financial infrastructure are
inextricably linked.  If one portion is hurt, the rippling effect is
immediate.  Trillions and trillions of dollars are trade every day.
What can Information Warriors do to the global spider-web of electronic
money, and what defenses are in place?

9:00 - 9:30      "PsyOps"

The military and intelligence community have practiced Psychological
Operations against adversaries for decades.  How is this done, and how
well does it work?  Does PsyOps also have a place in commercial
ventures?

9:30 - 10:00     "CORE WARS:
                  Practicing Information Warfare in Cyberspace"

The Core War was invented by A.K. Dewdney from the University of
Western  Ontario, Canada.  As fought today on the Internet, Core Wars
represent  the purest intellectual tests of pure strategy, tactics and
capability.   Battalions of software programs must genetically breed
themselves for combat knowing that they will go up against fierce
competition.  Video examples will be used to portray how Core Wars is
a working model for Information Warriors on the front lines.
        Chair:
                 Stuart Rosenberg, University of Cologne, Germany
                        Jo Seiler, University of Cologne, Germany

10:00 - 10:30    "Security By Obscurity: Point-Counterpoint"

Should the threats and details of potential vulnerabilities and actual
events be guarded under the shrouds of official government secrecy or
corporate policy of denial?  Or is open disclosure the best route for
education, awareness and defense?  How can one defend against the
unknown?  Strong arguments exist for all views.

10:30 - 11:00  Morning Coffee Break

11:00 - 12:00    Breakout Sessions I

        Class I    "An Electronic Bill of Rights"
                    Defining Privacy In Cyberspace

How do we as a nation balance the privacy rights of the individual
against the legitimate needs of the state, and in sync with the
policies  of our global trading partners?  The views from three
differing positions  will stimulate a healthy audience-panelist
dialogue.

          Moderated by:   Andrew Grosso, Former Asst. US Attorney
                          Scott Charney, DOJ Computer Crime Unit

        Class II:  "The 'Third Wave' Approach to Managing
                     Information Warfare: Building a Commercial War
                      Room"

Maximizing the flow and control of informations key to competitiveness-

whether it be on the battlefield or in the marketplace.  An innovative
tool and approach to planning and managing information in these very
intense, time-sensitive environment is the advent of "war rooms."
These are dynamic facilities which are optimized to channel the
collection, analysis and dissemination of information.  'War rooms'
can be static or field-portable and vary in ergonomic layout and
technical capability.

This session will provide case studies on the use of war rooms in
government and industry.  State of the art automated war rooms will be
described which feature the projection of computer-generated
information.

Tools and practices for knowledge discovery, processing and
dissemination will help you understand how you go about planning and
building a competitive intelligence War Room?

               Robert Beckman, Alta Analytics, Inc.

        Class III "International Cooperation"

All countries have an interest in stability, but rising nationalism
often transcends the greater good.  While most countries are becoming
militarily allied, we all remain competitively aggressive.  25% of
the world's population control 75% of the wealth (The Haves) while
nearly 4 billion people share the remaining 25% (The Have-Nots). Where
is the balance, and at what point does Information Warfare become
openly hostile?  In an electronically border-less world, how do we
collectively avoid getting to that point?

12:00 - 13:30  Working Lunch

12:30 - 13:00    Luncheon Speech

What are the organizing principles for information security and the
design basis of information systems and networks?  The DII is
mandated to  provide information services to the war-fighter.  The
NII initiative is  enhancing the economic posture of the US.  The
infrastructures are  inter-related and the loss of either
capability  could have devastating  effect on the economy and
security of the United States. The GII will  necessarily find
similar challenges where all nations must develop a  viable means
of cooperation.  This presentation outlines high level  approaches
to successful implementation.

13:30 - 14:30    Breakout Sessions

        Class I  "The Legal Consequences:
                  The Lawyers Are Coming, The Lawyers Are Coming."

FidoNews 12-21                 Page: 11                    22 May 1995

What are the legal rights of Cyber-citizens in the US and how do those
relate to the laws in other countries?  What is the real criminal and
civil recourse and remedies to combat industrial espionage?  How do we
legally handle non-physically violent attacks against the interest of
the US on our own soil or overseas?  Get the views of the experts.

              Moderated by:   Daniel Kuehl, PhD, Professor
                              National Defense University
                              Scott Charney, DOJ Computer Crime Unit

        Class II  "Defending Against the Internet"

The chaotic ravages of the Internet constantly knock at the doors of
anyone or any company is connected.  What do you have to do to protect
your information resources?  What have others done?  Is it enough and
what does the future bode?
        Chair: Kermit Beseke,  President, Secure Computing Corp.
               John Nagengast, NSA, Deputy Chief of Network Security

        Class III "The First Information War"

The military is attempting to build a global network where intelligence
information from the field is fed back to a War Room, analyzed,
decisions made, and then instructions sent back to the theater: almost
in real time.  How well does this work, and how far from reality is the
Pentagon's dream?

14:30-15:00       Afternoon Coffee Break

15:00 - 15:30     "Who Are The Information Warriors?"

Who are the bad guys?  Who has the capability and the motivation to
wage  any of the Three Classes of Information Warfare?  It's time to
name names.

15:30 - 16:00    "Hackers: National Resources or Criminal Kids "
                                    DEBATE

Germany uses professional hackers for their domestic industrial and
economic advantage.  What about the US?  The kindest words ever uttered
by Mich Kabay, Ph.D., about hackers is, "Amoral, sociopathic scum."
Robert Steele, President of Open Source Solutions, Inc. sees them as
national
resources, to be cultivated as a tool for US economic security. Do they
have a value in the protection of the US infrastructure, or can their
specific expertise be found elsewhere?  After short opening statements,
the audience will be encourage to ask provocative questions.

16:00 - 17:00     "The Future of Information Warfare"

Where do we go from here?  After two intensive days of interaction,
learning and listening, what's the next step?  What do industry and
the government have to do to better understand each other?  What steps
can each take to improve individual, corporate and national defensive
postures?

Dear Madam Emilia,

i was wondering if the electronic medium will provide a similar boon
to the power of the individual as did the printing press?  For
example, it is now possible to become relatively famous within
electronic culture by merely having somethings noteworthy to say,
and access to minimal hardware.  In e-space, imagination is more
influential than money.  Grapevine culture has more tendrils than
the old boys' network has bucks.  ?  .  Would you vote for someone
whom you have never seen on television or in conglommerate
newspapers to be president/prime minister/prima donna?

Yes.

Is there already an agreed upon quasi-standard for the interactivity
of web pages?  It would be nice if that realm were more human.  If
there were such a standard then sysadmins would have fewer headaches,
but what if it all becomes like a huge mail-order catalogue instead
of cosy wonderplay?

Humph.  windoze for e-mail.

  [while being in a sad and frazzled state, one might mention
  that the Rev. Visage has completely disappeared, much to the
  alarm and anxiety of his addicted fans]

Message Trackers!
By Carl Morris (1:285/302)

For more than the umpteenth time I have received mail marked
"The  following  message  was flagged as undeliverable at
1:260/1@fidonet. > 1:260/447 .... Address unknown".  These
messages are created by Message Trackers. In most cases Message
Trackers are software by the same name that checks the current
nodelist (at the site of the tracker mind you) and returns any
mail for addresses not in the nodelist.

While it may be usefull that the sender gets an acknowlegdement
that the address doesn't exist, its just short of pissing me
off! Appearently my Regional runs Message Tracker. Anything I
send to knew nodes or ones about to die often gets returned with
the above message.  I do not feel it is the regional's
responsibility.  I usually am just beating the nodelist by a
single day. In some instances I have started to wonder if the
regional updated his nodelist ....  I would stronger like
messages to get clear to the host or hub of these questionable
nodes before my message is returned. It might be nice to know
when the posibility of not getting a reply is likely, but it
many cases Message Trackers are just wasting the dime to send me
back my message.

In some instances, Nets and Regionals are using Message Trackers
FidoNews 12-21                 Page: 15                    22 May 1995

to return Netmails that are to nodes in their location that are
not on their CPR! Since when in hell has a node been required
to take part in a CPR of an entire region to receive routed
netmail! I will not stand for this. The regional or network
host spent twice as much money to handle my message because he
was so arrogant as to return it! Who do we have as regionals
and network hosts!?

As I can nolonger call LD, I must route EVERYTHING, even this
submission has been routed (and probably returned ;).

I noticed in the recent FIDOSTAT that someone has created some
"REMOVE_??????" echoes.  If these people are the same ones who
are using Message trackers for CPR purposes, I strongly suggest
they be thrown out and replacements elected.

Until next time, they'll just continue to return my messages!
Carl Morris
