                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

                        Credit Where Credit Is Due

     Almost unnoticed  in  the  past  week, there has been a change in
     Zone 1.   Steve  Bonine has stepped aside as Zone Coordinator and
     George Peace, his elected replacement, has assumed the position.

     Almost unnoticed.  That's  as it should be.  And it's part of the
     legacy Steve leaves us that it happened in just this manner.

     When he accepted the job, Steve had made it abundantly clear that
     he was only going to keep it for a year.   There were a few times
     when  events  nearly  led  him  to  reconsider and leave earlier.
     I for one am grateful that he stayed the course.

     During Steve's tenure, a system of electing Regional Coordinators
     has been evolving, and several Regions have held elections either
     to  replace  their   Coordinators  or  to  confirm  their  public
     acceptance.  This very real step towards Democracy in FidoNet has
     indeed worked quite well.  Steve  was never certain that Democracy
     could in fact work, but he devoted  a  lot of energy to give it a
     chance.

     Often  in FidoNet, people react to others who  don't  agree  with
     them  by  stooping  to  personal  attacks.  As one  of  the  most
     influential (and exposed) members of FidoNet, Steve had to accept
     more of that particular kind of traffic than perhaps anyone else.
     Nevertheless,  he  continued to  communicate  honestly  with  the
     people of FidoNet and did  not  become  hostile or stop trying to
     understand what the other parties were  trying  to  get across to
     him.  In a very real sense,  he  was  able to serve as Z1C and at
     the  same time, retain the perspective of an  individual  FidoNet
     sysop.   I have nothing but respect for  the  mental  powers  and
     emotional stability that made such a thing possible.

     Thank you, Steve.  Congratulations, George.  You have a tough act
     to follow.

     Donn Bly (1:236/7)
     Region 11 RC Election Coordinator

     Region 11 is electing a new RC.  The old RC, John Summers, has
     accepted a job in another region.  In an attempt to get the rules
     for the election out to as many region 11 sysops as possible, and
     since there are probably quite a few of you who are interested in
     how we are running things here in Region 11, we are posting the
     election rules here.

     ---------------------------
     Region 11 RC Election Rules
     ---------------------------

     1. All sysops listed as members of region 11 in FidoNet nodelist
     138 for 1990 are eligible to vote. Eligibility is by sysop, not
     system, and no single individual may cast more than one vote.
     Only sysops actually listed in the nodelist may cast a vote.

     2. All sysops listed as members of region 11 running a public
     system in FidoNet nodelist 138 for the year 1990 are eligible to
     run in this election. Current net coordinators may nominate
     themselves.  Non-NC's must be nominated by a region 11 NC, not
     necessarily their NC, and I must receive the nomination from the
     NC making the nomination. Please send all nominations to 1:236/7.
     All coordinators are urged to nominate any qualified candidate
     who requests such nomination.

     3. Each person nominated, and the NC in question if the nominee
     is not an NC, will receive a net mail message from me confirming
     that I have received the nomination. This note will either
     confirm the nomination is valid, or if it is not valid, will
     state the reason.  If you do not receive such a message within 72
     hours of sending it to me, please inform me immediately so the
     nomination can be resubmitted.

     4. Nominations will be accepted until 18:00 EST June 2, 1990.
     Nominations received after the cutoff point will be rejected
     regardless of reason.

     5. The ballot of valid candidates will be sent to all nodes in
     region 11 (as listed in FidoNet nodelist 138) and will be posted
     in the REGION11 echomail area as soon as possible after 18:00
     EST, June 2, 1990. (These messages will be sent via host-routed
     netmail.)

     6. The period for campaigning by each candidate will extend from
     the time they receive my confirmation of their nomination until
     the end of the voting period.

     7. The period of voting will extend from 18:00 EST, June 2, 1990,
     to 18:00 EST, June 16, 1990. Each sysop should net mail his
     completed ballot to FidoNet 1:236/7. Each ballot received will be
     noted in a receipt sent by me via host-routed netmail.  (The
     receipt will not contain the name of the candidate for whom you
     voted.) If you do not receive a confirmation of your vote within
     FidoNews 7-22                Page 5                   28 May 1990


     72 hours, please contact me via net mail immediately. No ballots
     will be accepted after the deadline for any reason.

     8. Each ballot received at 1:236/7 may contain exactly one vote
     for one accepted candidate. Write-in votes and otherwise invalid
     ballots will be returned along with their reason for rejection to
     the sender. Each voter should also enter onto the ballot an eight
     (8) character alphanumeric codeword by which the voter wishes to
     be identified when the votes are made public. No ballot will be
     accepted without this codeword. Abstention will be a not be a
     valid option on the ballot, and all ballots not containing a vote
     for one of the listed candidates will be rejected. Once a valid
     ballot has been received from a eligible voter, no further
     ballots will be accepted from that voter.

     9. At 18:00 EST, June 16, 1990, the votes will be counted and the
     winner will be made known to the zone 1 coordinator and placed in
     the REGION11 echomail area. The winner is the candidate receiving
     the majority of votes cast.

     10. In the case that there is no candidate with a majority of
     votes cast, a run-off will be conducted between the candidates
     with the two highest numbers of votes. In the event of a tie for
     the highest number of votes, all candidates with that number of
     votes will participate in the run-off election. In the event of a
     single candidate with the highest number of votes and a tie for
     second highest number of votes, the candidate with the highest
     number of votes and all candidates with the second highest number
     of votes will participate in the run-off.

     11. In the event a run-off is necessary, the period of voting
     will run from 18:00 EST, June 16, 1990 to 18:00 EST, June 23,
     1990.  The ballot of valid candidates will be sent to all
     eligible nodes in region 11 (as listed in FidoNet nodelist 138)
     and will be posted in the REGION11 echomail area as soon as
     possible.

     12. The winner of the run-off will be made known to the zone 1
     coordinator and announced in the REGION11 echomail area. Should
     the first run-off election result in no candidate receiving a
     majority of the votes cast, then run-off elections will be held
     every seven days until a candidate receives a majority of the
     votes cast. Rule 10 above will determine who is eligible to
     participate in each run-off.

     13. The vote tallies for each candidate will be made public at
     the end of the main voting period, and, if necessary, the end of
     the runoff voting period(s). A list of all nodes voting, and a
     list of all codewords, together with the candidate for whom each
     codeword voted, will be posted in the REGION11 conference and
     made available for download or file-request from 1:236/7 as
     R11VOTE.TXT. Under no conditions will the true identity of the
     person represented by any codeword be made public. I will archive
     all nominations, receipts for and rejections of nominations,
     ballots received, and receipts for and rejections of ballots,
     together with the vote totals into an encrypted archive to be
     FidoNews 7-22                Page 6                   28 May 1990


     kept for at least one year by me, Donn Bly.  This archive, along
     with its encryption key will be turned over to the current (at
     the time I receive the request) FidoNet zone 1 coordinator upon
     my receiving a signed written request that I do so. Under no
     circumstances whatever will it ever be turned over to anyone
     else.

     14. After the election is over, a period for comments about the
     election will be opened.  During this period suggestions on how
     to run the next RC election will be taken and considered.  A
     modified set of rules (if any such modifications are deemed
     necessary) will be drafted and submitted to the new RC for use in
     the next election.  This topic will be discussed in more detail
     at a later time.


     Donn Bly (1:236/7)
     Region 11 RC Election Coordinator

     These rules originally written by Rick Moore, 1:115/333, and
     reflect modifications by Steve Bonine, Peter Hru, and Donn Bly.

     Pizza Party --

     Here in Net 124/130 land, we have a monthly Pizza Party.  We
     alternate the location, so everybody has to drive a long ways
     most of the time.  We talk about problems and features and
     whatever the mood suits.

     On this occasion, we discussed the pending US Robotics HST's
     V.42bis upgrade, relative merits of building your own PC and
     the fine art of dealing with policemen who have pulled you over
     on traffic violations.  Of course, with 20 people showing up,
     you don't get hear everything, but quite often the words CONFIG
     and USER float across the room.

     It's neat to meet the faces behind the names you read.  Funny,
     you don't hear any flames.

     I ate and drank mightily, noting the Apple Strudel Pizza, and
     Cinnamon Toast Pizza.  Actually I hadn't eaten in 3 days, so
     this was the Pizza Party that SAVED MY LIFE !


     Free Spaghetti --

     You know those solicitous letters with the postage paid return
     envelopes.  I got one from a 'RECOVERY' company; they said they
     had found 169 bucks that the state of Texas owes me, and would
     show me how to get it for 29 bucks.  I was so outraged, I
     included a strand of spaghetti in the envelope !

     The other night, I get a phone call about it.  No mention of
     the spaghetti, but since I denied having sent it back, he said
     he'd send another letter.  <smirk>  I got it today, so I
     stuffed everything back in and also a STOP SMOKING solicitation
     postcard.

     I wonder how many times this will work ?!


     Computer Underground --

     Every heard of this?  I hadn't, until someone uploaded several
     newsletters to MY BBS.  I started looking at the latest issue,
     and frankly, I don't know what to think.  There's some bunch
     trying to SUE THE FBI because their E-mail was wrongfully
     confiscated in a search for missing body parts at a cryogenics
     company.  HOLY WRATH OF KHAN, BATMAN ! Right, Boy Wonder, it's
     LAWYER CITY.

     Some other issues list out dozens of E-mail Networks that seem
     a bit on the shady side, I never heard of any of 'em.  Adding
     to my concerns was the BIG BUST here in Plano, where they
     nailed a bunch of modem users passing around Telco auth codes
     and such.  It's getting downright dangerous to own a modem.
     Southwest Bell was reportedly checking BBS listings !

     So what would you do ?  I didn't know the guy that uploaded the
     newsletters, so I moved them offline.  Paranoia ? Probably.
     These people have the right idea with a completely wrong
     approach...  sort of a Kent State mentality.


     Thank God It's Monday --

     I had one of those wonderful weekends, where nothing was
     planned, and I could just loaf around and get some rest. HA.
     Saturday morning, I get called to work, the accounting
     adjustments have not arrived over our backbone network.  At
     noon, I get the request to write a program to stuff the numbers
     into our database.  I told them, "I have a computer conference
     at 1", which of course, was my life saving Pizza Party.  About
     4 I get home and someone's over looking to buy the old car.
     After two hours, they don't even buy it.

     About 6, my boss calls, and I tell them, "I'm about half done".
     Honey comes in and tells me we're leaving at 6:30 for a
     surprise anniversary party;  sure surprised me.  I get home at
     10 and call my boss, "I'm testing it now".  Get everyone off to
     bed, it's 11 and I finally sit down to start.  Didn't have one
     line of code written.

     At midnight I'm compiling the program in San Angelo;  this is
     PC Anywhere from home to office, and IRMA from office to the
     mainframe.  Fortunately, I only had one bug. Unfortunately, at
     1 AM the database goes down for maintenance.  At 2:30 it's back
     up, and I start the adjustments, and at 4 it's finally done.

     You know, I used to could stay up all night, easy.  Now, it
     hurts.  I have no idea why...
