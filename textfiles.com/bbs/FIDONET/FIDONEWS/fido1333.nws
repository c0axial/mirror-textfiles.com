     jim barchuk of 1:141/355 [jbarchuk@worldnet.att.net] has moved the
     FidoNews into the world of Internet HTML access. He has an article
     in this Issue describing access information. I've checked it out and
     it's cool. [grin]

     Thanks, jim, for the effort!

     The FidoNews public-key is not working here so please throw out any
     copies you may have of it produced prior to 10 Aug 96. I messed up the
     password somehow and cannot access it or revoke it. A new public-key
     is now available here that does work. My apologies to all who have
     previously freqed it or tried to send in articles using it. If you
     have already added the old one to your personal keyring, USE the -d
     DISABLE feature to disable the old one before adding in the new one.
     DO NOT delete it from your keyring! Disabling the old one will keep
     a bad copy of the old one from getting into your keyring in the future
     from some other keyring contents you might add.

     See the Masthead info section for details on obtaining the FidoNews
     public-key. It is also published regularly in the FIDONEWS Echo and
     the PKEY_DROP Echo.

     Zone 3 has a new Zone Coordinator in David Nugent but we still do not
     have an updated Zone 3 section in our Nodelist in Zone 1. Does Zone 3
     show updated in Zones 2? 4? 5? 6? ZC3: do you want to tell us what's
     new down there?

       NOTE: FIDONEWS Echo is now moving over the Planet Connect part of
             the Zone 1 Backbone. Everyone should be able to get a link
             to that Echo as soon as you read this.

     Creating Network Wide Bulletins [II]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     This article continues my two-part tutorial on creating network-wide
     bulletins accessible from other Fidonet systems via netmail.
         Last week's article covered the technical aspects of setting up
     your choice of three pieces of software, Netmgr, FDInt or InfoMail.
     This week I will take a look at the bulletin text file itself.
     Needless to say, this article will be better read after that in
     FidoNews 1332.

         Now that our bulletin is set up in the document server software,
     it is time to enter the bulletin itself.  All three pieces of software
     deal with straight text files, so you will create the bulletin using
     your regular text editor.
         First, let's look at the technical aspects of bulletin writing,
     such as limits imposed by the document server software.  InfoMail
     limits bulletins to 16k, whilst FDInt allows larger bulletins, but
     gives the option to split messages above a size which you may specify.
     NetMgr mentions no message size limits.
         Both InfoMail and the registered version of NetMgr allow you to
     include macros in your bulletin text, allowing you to personalise a
     bulletin; the actual text of the posted message will change based upon
     the bulletin and the requesting user's name and address.  The
     following table gives the macros:

         Macro Purpose                               NetMgr  InfoMail
         ------------------------------------------------------------
         Name which the request was addressed to     %to     {I}
         As above, but only the first name           %fto    -
         Name of the user who posted the request     %from   {N}
         As above, but only the first name           %ffrom  {F}
         As above, but only the last name            -       {L}
         Subject of the original message [1]         %subj   {D}
         Subject of the outgoing message [1]         %subj   {S}
         Requesting user's address                   %orig   {U}
         Document server's address                   %dest   {A}
         Time the message was written                %time   -
         Year the message was written                %year   -
         Month the message was written               %mon    -
         Day of the month the message was written    %day    -
         Day of the week the message was written     %dow    -
         Number of bulletin accesses                 -       {C}
         Program name and version (document server)  -       {P}
         ------------------------------------------------------------
      [1] NetMgr uses the same subject on inbound and outbound messages.

     So, to make your posted bulletins more friendly and personalised, you
     could include "Hi %ffrom!" or "Hi {F}!" at the top of your bulletin,
     or you can make use of the other macros in the table.
         As an added feature, InfoMail allows you to specify the minimum
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 3                   12 Aug 1996


     length of an expanded macro by including a number in the brace {}
     characters.  For example, {D16} would give the document name, expanded
     to 16 characters.  This is useful for including macros in tables or
     other forms of formatted text.
         Be careful to ensure that the message text does not include brace
     characters {} if you are using InfoMail, or that if it does, the
     document list editor has macros set to 'no' for that particular
     document (this prevents macros from being expanded and leaves brace
     characters in the bulletin text alone).
         If you take a look at a stored netmail message (or an echomail
     message for that matter), you will see that not every line is marked
     by a carriage return.  This is because Fidonet messages are
     reformatted by your message reader in real time, so the message can be
     displayed in the best way to suit your screen.  Only a paragraph needs
     to end with a carriage return.
         This is particularly useful for GUI-based systems with
     proportional fonts.  You can take advantage of this capability in your
     own bulletins, by only adding a linefeed at the end of a paragraph.
     This looks a little ugly in most text editors, but it will look much
     better to the recipient of your bulletin.  It also solves the problem
     of expanded macros, which can cause ugly reformatting of a message if
     they cause the remote message editor's line length to be exceeded.
     This tip applies to all three document servers.

         Now for the less technical aspects of bulletin writing.  The first
     point is in line with message size limits.  Although InfoMail is the
     only program here which limits messages, there are some mail
     processors which also have a limit.
         Even if you are using NetMgr or FDInt, you may encounter problems
     if outgoing bulletins exceed the maximum size that can be handled by
     your uplink's mail processor, or the mail processor of some other
     system along the bulletin's route.  Bear in mind costs when creating
     your bulletin as well; other systems might object to routing large
     netmails, especially if the number of requests for a large bulletin is
     high.
         Publicity for your bulletin is a matter for some thought, and I
     covered the issue tentatively in my more general article in FidoNews
     1330.  In my own bulletins I now include a little section at the end,
     which gives details of who maintains the bulletin, who to address
     comments and suggestions to, and how to obtain more information on the
     same subject-- including bulletins by myself and others.

         Further, more general, advice could be offered on bulletin
     writing, such as presentation and clarity, but that is beyond both the
     scope of this article and my level of experience as an amateur writer,
     so I'll leave such things to your own judgement or to other sources.
         From this tutorial you should have a better idea of what creating
     a bulletin involves.  For the sysop, it need not be much more complex
     than offering local bulletins to the users of that sysop's BBS.  Even
     for points, the procedure is no great difficulty.
         If you do take up the challenge of offering bulletins via netmail,
     I strongly suggest you let us know about it in FidoNews, or if you
     don't think that the bulletin is of wide enough interest, let me know
     via netmail.

     Some Final Notes

         I have tried to make sure the information in this tutorial is
     complete and correct, but in the event of any ambiguity or plain
     stupid mistakes, I take no responsibility :-)  If you don't want your
     computer faithfully crashmailing bulletins to all and sundry around
     the world, make sure you test your setup!
         On a more general and less negative note, I remind anyone wishing
     to access a bulletin via routed netmail to include something in the
     message body, even if the message body is ignored by the document
     server.  As Colin Turner reminds us in the documentation for FDInt,
     some systems along the route may delete empty netmails.

     Hmmm... Would you believe FidoNews in HyperText format?

     ====

     Why Not!? [G]

     Think about it... Margins, proportional font, hyperlinks. :)

     Would this be FidoHyperNewsText? "I don't think so, Tim".

     I will not be doing 'back issues', and it may take me a day or two to
     mark up current issues as I receive them, but it sure Looks Good.

     For a sample, see:

     http://www.geocities.com/Athens/6894/

     ...and 'follow the links'. Use the 'HTTP', -not- the 'FTP' link.

     As there are quite a handful of files involved, each issue resides in
     it's own subdirectory, such as '1332'.

     All back issues of FidoNews are available via:

     http://www.geocities.com/Athens/6894/

     Files are in individual -text- format for casual online reading,
     unlike fidonet.org and sstar.com which offer compressed/bulk files.

     Available are HTTP/web browser interface and FTP/no frills interface.

     ====

     A few limitations:

     1) This is a somewhat 'part time' site, available appx. 8AM-11PM EST,
     (-0500 GMT). Why? Right now I don't trust this sucker to run too
     unattended, and I don't want to push AT&T Worldnet 'unlimited access'
     -too- hard. :)

     2) Presently limited to 14k4 bandwidth of my modem, but I don't think
     anyone can read quite that fast. :)

     3) Above, I wrote 'via:'. The files do not -reside- at Geocities, but
     on my home server, linked via dynamic IP. This means you -can't-
     -bookmark- the server itself because the address is liable to change
     at any time. But bookmarking the Geocities page is fine.

     ====

     New features coming as soon as I work out some CGI details:

     1) Search engine; look for names/topics.

     2) Online article editor; write and mail your article.

     Any other frills anyone would like to see, feel free to ask. Yeah, I
     know, 28k8 would be nice. :)

     Addicted to Fidonet, but not the Internet.

     Well, seeing some people have been lamenting about the apparent
     decline of Fidonet, I thought I might write about as close I as I can
     get to the opposite, by writing briefly about how I got into modeming,
     and the advantages I see in Fidonet over the Internet. BTW no
     disrespect meant to those people.

     Yes, everyone time seems to fly everywhere. Don't tell me if I'm
     wrong, but my brother tells me that Einstein once said that when one
     is moving, time moves (albeit an very immeasurable amount) faster.
     Maybe I should stay still all my life! ;-) Maybe that's why time seems
     to be faster since I discovered Fidonet.

     Anyway, I can't quite remember when I got onto Fidonet. I recall I got
     suckered into buying a 2400 modem for NZ$125 in Oct. '94. Then I found
     a copy of a respected Wellington BBS list compiled by a local sysop
     and started my BBSing on an ancient comms program, both left over when
     a friend of mine brought around his modem.

     No more than about a year later, after getting hold of a better comms
     program, I discovered Fidonet, as accidental as Charles Goodyear when
     he discovered the process for vulcanised rubber. After discovering an
     unusual program that craved .QWK files my new comms program apparently
     installed, I logged onto a local BBS, and off it went.

     OK. Enough about myself. Back to the subject I was meant to write
     about... :)

     IMHO, one 'thing' about Echomail from my teen view on life is (and has
     been repeated trillions of times no doubt) that it has a more
     refreshing atmosphere than the Internet's Usenet. While I'm still
     stuck with a 2400 modem, which gets a bit of a problem if you haven't
     downloaded mail for more than a week. Please don't flood my mailbox
     with "CORRECTION!" but from what I understand it's a bit hard to reply
     to postings on Usenet, because as far as I'm aware you don't have a
     "TO:" line, making it I guess all that harder to follow a discussion.
     At least that's all I understood when I used Usenet for a few times.

     Earlier this year as the local freenet (WCC City Net) was due to
     close, Fidonews came to my attention while viewing the new files list.
     Great publication, and I've learnt a lot since I file-requested my
     first 'copy'. Naturally, this is my first article writing something
     for Fidonews. I am willing to admit I've never read an Internet e-zine
     so I can't speak on that, but because we're (no offence intended to
     anyone BTW) smaller, we can have one newsletter/magazine/e-zine that
     can cover more easily quite a lot of items, and with a few extras like
     the Calendar, and the ASCII Comix, other than an e-zine that has the
     opportunity to cover at least ten million 'things' on the Internet.

     I'm definitely not trying to bump up sysops' phone bills by the size
     of our 80s national debt, let alone sending unnecessary netmail but I
     myself am surprised by the speed of Fidonet. For example, I had a
     NetMail from 1:270 at exactly Wed Jul 31 at 0628UTC, arriving in Zone
     3 at 1358, arriving in N.Z. on Aug 01 at 0415. Got to my favourite BBS
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 7                   12 Aug 1996


     no more than twelve hours later at 1617. That's around 34 1/2 hours,
     and IMHO because I check my mail once every couple days, that's no
     problem for me, though I guess some people need virtually instant
     e-mail. But for some people, and I hope there's some people like me,
     don't usually need this sort of urgency, as is kind of available on
     the Internet. But it does help when you need it.

     I still use that Internet e-mail box primarily for sending mail to
     relations because they have no idea what Fidonet is. Here may be a
     place for more awareness. Personally, I like the idea of Fido-to-
     Internet gateways, but equally if people keep abusing the gateways as
     some people have been telling me has happened, I don't blame the
     gateway operators for closing them. If people stay away from Fidonet,
     my quick guess would be maybe we need to set up a more stable gateway
     for Internet mail and guard against abuse, like ftpmail, et cetera.
     Unfortunately, I guess I must mention costs. But with more Internet
     Service Providers offering Fidonet access and BBS operators offering
     apparently low-cost Internet mailboxes, my point may become an
     unnecessary one.

     If somehow we can capitalise on these points, I think we might just
     have something great here. I guess that is what my personal opinion is
     of Fidonet, especially Echomail, is at the moment. Fidonet itself may
     be appearing to decline in popularity looking at the Zone2-view
     nodelist stats in each Fidonews issue, but that definitely doesn't
     matter. Internet has WWW in graphics, Internet has telnet, but we
     still have our advantages, which we can use to our advantage.

     How time flies in a year--maybe it's time for me to make it go by
     faster by thinking about a new modem. ;-) Hope this long article
     didn't put anyone off. Unfortunately my favourite BBS (GenBOARD/2)
     doesn't appear to carry the Fidonews echo, so I won't hear much of the
     discussion on this (maybe an article in reply in a future issue?), but
     this is the positive side I see of Fidonet at the moment.

     Thanks everyone,
     Jonathan.

     Fido - A Revolution?

     By Damian Stamm
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 9                   12 Aug 1996


     1:273/406

         A lot has been made in the past couple of weeks about the future
     of Fidonet.  Interestingly enough, this was a topic in the past
     Fidonews' prior to going to detention for a couple of months.

         However, the latest articles have clearly been more upbeat.  After
     reading several messages of "unless we do something Fido will die"
     back in May, we are finally seeing people come through with solutions
     and ideas.

         But is anyone going to do anything about it?  Will the people who
     can best coordinate such an effort, the Z1C and ZEC, care enough to
     put together such a plan?  How will they be implimented?  Are we doing
     nothing more than advancing our state of CTS?

         Certainly I was one who was published, worried about the future of
     Fidonet and how the technology we are using today may cause us to
     eventually fall to the hands of the Internet.  The person I most
     criticized, Z1C Bob Satti (referred amorously throughout the article
     as B.S.) did not take too kindly to the article.  But dear Robert, the
     message was not just about attacking you personally for no good
     reason.  It's about doing something, ANYTHING, to help advance
     Fidonet, other than sit there, read PC's and vote in favor of the RC
     who votes for you (in this wonderful Cuban voting procedure we have in
     Fidonet), and spend your time worrying about petty things such as
     whether the Fidonews has a PGP signature because of a totally
     insignificant section of P4.

         But it is time to move forward.  There have been several issues
     brought up, one most interestingly being a standard graphical BBS that
     Fidonet would use, updated message technology, and other ideas that
     would help move Fidonet forward.  Such a procedure would require
     massive amounts of work with people around Fidonet, something that
     hasn't been done since Tom Jennings creating Fido BBS.

         In my opinion, the best people to take on such a task would be the
     Z1C and the ZEC, Bruce Bodger.  To gather a group of people around the
     country, those who would be most qualified to take on such a task, and
     to produce totally new software and technical standards for Fidonet.
     If that means leaving someone who runs a TRS-80 with a 300 baud modem
     out of the dark, SO BE IT.  It's about damn time we started moving
     forward instead of worrying about some poor schmuck who is so out of
     date because he won't upgrade.  I have heard repeatedly, beit in
     Fidonews or the regional echo, how the *.msg format could easily be
     replaces with a faster, more efficient technical standard.  Why don't
     we?

         To do so would revolutionize and re-energize Fidonet.  I agree
     with Gregg Jennings in the past Fidonews that the source code be made
     freely available, and make the new software freeware so that EVERYONE
     can enjoy it, and that more hobby-sysops will join the network.  This
     can only benefit Fido.

         To see the Z*'s put together some commission to take on such a
     task would be a great positive for Fidonet.  I hope I get a response
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 10                  12 Aug 1996


     from Bruce (the only one who has the balls to stay in touch with the
     sysops of Fidonet,) in the ZEC echo, which I carry, or via netmail.
     It is my belief that they are the ones who have the resources, and the
     knowledge, as well as the position, to best impliment this idea.  If
     Bob Satti answers, that would be more than welcome too, as much of a
     suprise it would be.

         Let's see what happens - and hopefully, Fido will be around for at
     least another 12 years.

     A view from Russia: Fidonet is alive - a community of friends.

     By Mikhail Ramendik,
     2:5020/230.4, ramen@pccross.msk.su

     In several issues of Fidonews, a certain topic is constantly
     discussed. It is whether Fidonet will live or not, and if it will,
     how it is going to compete with the Internet. Some of the proposed
     'solutions' are, I believe, simply destructive and can result in real
     death of Fidonet.

     First of all, what IS Fidonet? Damian Walker has listed many options
     in Fidonews #31, but IMHO he has missed the main one - as a Russian
     saying goes, 'failed to notice the elephant'. He proposes various
     USES of Fidonet rather than describing what it IS - which means that
     it IS simply a certain technology (Fido Technology Net - FTN) and a
     global nodelist.

     Of course, FTN is a good technology (we'll return to this later) and
     Fidonet certainly has the advantage of the global nodelist, making
     crashmail possible. It is true that the technology has certain uses
     (but some of them, like document/FAQ distribution by routed mail, are
     simply not for Fidonet and cause great flame by overloaded hubs). But
     all of the uses can be done via the Internet; one can make in
     Internet BBS (what else is Compuserve anyway?). So some are inclined
     to look at Fidonet as an 'amateur, free-of-charge Internet'.

     To me this resembles calling the ham radio community an 'amateur CNN'.

     Now look at the header of the very snoozie I'm writing for. It does
     not say 'The newsletter of the FidoNet networking system', but 'of
     the FidoNet BBS *community*'. (BTW to the Editor: why not remove the
     long-obsolete 'BBS'?)

     WE ARE A COMMUNITY! Not just a set of wirez and warez: the Internet
     is much better at this. But if two Internetters (not writing to same
     newsgroups) from the same town meet, they have nothing in common. But
     if I, a Fidonetter from Russia, ever happen to meet a Fidonetter from
     Africa or Australia, it will probably be a good beering and hours of
     pleasant net-talk.

     And we have the near perfect technology for a community. From fixed
     links to personal echomail, FTN makes the thing that those who know
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 11                  12 Aug 1996


     each other, trust each other, talk to each other (personally or
     electronically) love to use. The archived mail bundles may be
     transferred not only by modem, but by everything from LAN to floppies
     - enabling friends to overcome troubles.

     And if some people want to make a community of their own, usually
     smaller and with rules different from Fidonet - FTN is good for them
     too, just number your own zone and go ahead. If within Fidonet you
     want an echo of your own just for the few who are interested, you can
     do it without the troubles of a mailing list. A filebone - just
     install AllFix. I can not think of anything friends would want that
     FTN does not provide.

     And what about the Internet? It *is* wirez and warez. It is a good,
     low-cost communication system. It might mostly replace routed
     netmail, but who cares - in fact, I would like a standard FTN message
     kludge for the email address to reply there if needed. But it will
     never be, and is not intended to be, a community like us.

     It has all the methods to transfer files (UUencode if you can't
     afford FTP). It has speed and reliability far above that of
     long-distance calls. We should not compete with it, but use it! In
     fact, VMODEM has provided an excellent way for such use, and I know
     of several IP FTN links feeding independent nodes and even nets in
     remote Russian towns. But even without VMODEM, just via UUE and FTP,
     we can take great advantage of the Internet's capability - while
     using the same FTN, and therefore being able to revert to phone calls
     in an hour or two if necessary.

     Now I think I have made my point. But there is a trend which may
     destroy the community. It is the promotion of 'cheaper than the
     Internet' Fidonet communication to commercial and such users.

     The Net should be, of course, open for everyone who wishes to join us.
     But it should be because one wants to be in the community, not
     because one wants cheaper email. We MUST NOT promote the Net semi-
     commercially! We MUST NOT give out or sell 'BBS user starter
     diskettes' of the kind that will make the user think it's a free
     Compuserve! Otherwise, we will become just another set of wirez and
     warez. And the Internet, with prices falling, will completely
     eliminate us.

     Let us remain friends!

                       SEARCH FOR DATA-CAPABLE
                          FIRE DEPARTMENTS
                       RELENTLESSLY CONTINUES
                    By Christopher Baker, Sysop,
                       Metro-Fire Fido, 18/14
                   ==============================

             Somewhere, among the countless 25,000+ readers of FidoNews,
     there must be a few computer enthusiasts that are also involved with
     their local Fire departments in some way (other than litigation, that
     is). Even if it's only to buy a ticket to the Fireman's picnic.
     Perhaps, you have a relative in the business? Maybe, you're a vendor
     of goods and/or services to your local smoke-eaters? Or, perish the
     thought, YOU might be one of the men/women in gray/blue/black/etc.!?

     However you may be connected, I need your help. It is my intention
     (and fondest hope) to bring together as many departments as I can find
     into a national Fire network. The purpose of which will be to share
     ideas, programs, tips, warnings, techniques, etc., and to provide a
     common forum for the dissemination of information to as broad a base
     as possible.

     To begin this Herculean task, I need some input. If you belong to or
     know of or work for a Fire/Rescue department, paid or volunteer, that
     has telecommunication/data equipment, please give them a copy of this
     article and urge them to contact me through FidoNet or U.S. Mail.

     Send FidoMail to: Sysop, Fido 18/14. If you wish to sign-on as a user
     of the board, make the message PRIVATE and include your sign-on name
     (no handles, please), your City and State, the name and address and
     phone number of your department, and the password you would like to
     use. Please be sure to make the message PRIVATE when including
     password information. All FidoMail requests for access will be
     granted within 24 hours (usually, except for requests received on
     Monday and Tuesday - my days off).

     If you wish to send information via U.S. Mail, send to:

     The results of this preliminary survey will determine the direction of
     my grand design, so don't let this task languish, if you can help it.
     I know most of you are very busy with your own operations, but this
     could be the start of something big (where's Steve Allen, when you
     need him?)!

     Thank you, in advance. I'll be waiting to hear from all
     of you.

                       THE CONTINUING STORY OF
                       LINKING FIRE DEPARTMENT

                           (What a Dream!)
                    By Christopher Baker, Sysop,
                       Metro-Fire Fido, 18/14
                   ==============================

     Our primary function, in the beginning, will be to assemble as many
     depts as possible into a sub-net or a number of sub-nets to establish
     a base for communication between depts across the country that would
     not otherwise be aware of each other. While that is being accomplished
     and once it is in force, our function will be to provide net
     coordination and a central locus for collection and dissemination of
     information of interest to all.

     As you may or may not know, fire department operations bear little
     resemblance to any other form of endeavor. This uniqueness begs (it
     seems to me) for a common mode of communication to share ideas and
     experiences as well as computer programs specific to fire dept ops.
     For example, we have a dept of 1200+ members. We are writing a
     specific program to automate the calling of overtime, which is now
     done manually, that will automatically sort, file, compare
     qualifications and produce an updated listing of who is next eligible
     and qualified for overtime. With this many people and with all the
     different levels and types of qualifications, calling overtime is a
     genuine pain!  Programs of this type could be shared with other
     depts via the sub-net we are proposing. I also hope to get a tie-in to
     the F.E.M.A. and National Fire Academy systems for bulletins and other
     info.

     Metro-Dade Fire & Rescue is in the process of setting up an
     administrative data network consisting of this 3270 set-up and a
     number of IBM ATs. This network will handle the daily, routine
     paperwork and allow for individual site E-mail and program
     development. This network will operate outside of the Dade County Data
     Processing system and be exclusively for the use of our Dept. The
     program development will be managed by a central office but the
     programming efforts will come largely from volunteers from within the
     Dept who work at it in their spare time or time allotted from their
     normal duties for this purpose.

     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 14                  12 Aug 1996


     The in-house AT network should develop some interesting applications
     for this Dept that may be of use or interest to other depts,
     regardless of size. These developments would be available to other
     depts through the Fido sub-net I propose.

     This is, generally, what I have in mind at present for the Fire Net. I
     hope this information will be of assistance to those of you trying to
     convince your departments that computers and data links are the future
     and are beneficial for all concerned.

     I appreciate the many responses to my article.   If I can be of
     further assistance to you, please do not hesitate to ask. FidoMail
     sent on Mondays & Tuesdays is not processed until Wednesday (Mon-
     Tue=my days off), otherwise any mail will be replied to on the next
     FidoMail day.

                   ==============================
                     WE'VE CHANGED OUR NET/NODE
                       BUT NOT OUR STRUGGLE!
                    By Christopher Baker, Sysop,
                      Metro-Fire Fido, 135/14
                   ==============================


     This is just to let everyone know that Metro-Fire Fido has moved to a
     new net/node location in your trusty nodelist.

     We are now part the Miami Area Network, Net 135. This too is
     temporary, since we intend to form a Special Interest Region for Fire
     Departments. Several departments are now studying the possibilities of
     linking up with Fido and FidoNet. As soon as one or two more come
     together, I will be applying for a Region number assignment.

     You in FidoLand can continue to assist me in my endeavor by passing
     these articles to anyone you know in any Fire Department anywhere.
     (See also FidoNews 227 & 229.)

     As an update, Metro-Fire Fido now has two doctors on-line for
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 15                  12 Aug 1996


     questions and answers related to EMS, Trauma Networks, Hyperbaric
     Medicine, Diving Trauma, and General surgery and other medical
     questions. We are looking for an Expert-in-Residence to take up the
     gauntlet of Hazardous Materials, Water Rescue, Apparatus, Training,
     Safety, and any other areas of interest to the Fire/Rescue Services.

     Please feel free to lend your support/assistance/expertise or to
     contribute information to our system. Verification for access to our
     system can be made by FidoMail or call xxx-xxx-xxxx and leave
     information to the Sysop. The board runs in the private mode from 2230
     Sunday till 1800 Friday and in the semi-private mode from 1800 Friday
     till 2230 Sunday.

     *FireNet IS a Reality!

                          FireNet Meets Echomail
                                    and
                          The Dream is Realized!


     I have been writing articles for FidoNews since early 1985. One of my
     goals, through these articles, has been to unite Fire and Rescue
     Departments through FidoNet and generate some kind of meaningful
     exchange of information. It has not been easy to get departments to
     join in for one reason or another.

     Many departments, only now, are becoming capable of supporting Fido
     systems. Those that can are beginning to understand the potential.
     Many others are unaware that Fido exists. It is my intention to keep
     at it until EVERYONE knows about Fido, et al, and the possibilities
     for mass communication of vital data (e.g.  Hazardous Material
     warnings, equipment updates, program availability, conference notices,
     new services, etc.) within the Fire/EMS community.

     Toward that end, a NEW Echomail conference has been established.  The
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 16                  12 Aug 1996


     FireNet Echo, hosted by Colorado's FireNet Leader (128/16), is a
     reality and available to any Node who wants to hook in.

     This Echo is available from 128/16 in the West and from 135/14 in the
     East. It encompasses the following Nodes: 128/16, 135/14, 104/610,
     138/411, and 17/38. (Colorado's FireNet Leader, Metro-Fire Fido,
     DIVE_LINK, The Dalmatian and 65' North, respectively.)

     Anyone with an interest in the technical aspects of the Fire/EMS
     services is welcome to participate in this Echo. At the moment, we are
     discussing HazMat databases, hydraulic friction loss, wilderness
     Search & Rescue, and a new CHEMTREC service via modem to registered
     subscribers.

     If you or someone you know is involved in Fire or EMS, paid or
     volunteer, and has a PC and a modem and a desire to become part of a
     new idea in inter-departmental communications, please give them a copy
     of this article and have them call me or send Net mail to 135/14. If
     anyone would like an ARC containing all of my previous Fire-related
     articles to spread around to their local departments, let me know via
     Net mail and I will file-attach it to you as soon as I receive your
     request. (GET FIRENET.ARC)

     If you prefer the U.S. Mail (and who would?), send requests to:

                             Christopher Baker

     I would be happy to assist any department or organization in setting
     up a Fido system. Join us!

     *FireNet Revisited

     Christopher Baker
     MetroFire - 135/14

                   FireNet Echo Recap for the Neophyte

     Those of you new to FidoNet may have heard of FireNet but may not be
     sure what FireNet is or what it does. Herein lies a brief synopsis.

     Shortly after getting into FidoNet back in early 1985, it occurred to
     me that the FidoNet structure was such that it could lend itself very
     well all sorts of spin-off sub-nets.  Having set up this system for
     the fire department I work for (Metro-Dade Fire & Rescue in greater
     Miami) as an experiment, I began to toy with the idea that a private
     Net could be created that would allow direct and convenient message
     communication between participating departments. The software was
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 17                  12 Aug 1996


     readily available, operated on most standard machines and modems, and
     could be configured specifically for fire department use.

     I began to write articles for FidoNews on the subject and began
     contacting other departments and fire service types who might be
     cajoled into participating in such a venture.

     At that time, special interest Nets existed in FidoNet (since
     abandoned as redundant) so I applied for and received the number Net
     911 (now operating as a private Net) and started gathering interested
     systems.

     It wasn't until the advent of Jeff Rush's famous Echomail programs
     that the real potential of the original idea began to emerge. Woody
     Wood and Chuck Sanders of the Colorado Springs Fire Department and I
     began to exchange ideas and plans and Woody and Chuck got Echomail
     installed on their system and began to link-in other FidoNet systems.
     Echomail was much easier to hook into for established systems and
     gave a new dimension to the original concept of a sub-Net or private
     Nodelist. For one thing, Echomail allowed users to participate without
     having to set up a system, first.  All anyone had to do was find a
     system carrying FireNet and enter messages. This is how many
     departments first became aware of the Echo. Many of those departments
     went on to set up full-fledged FidoNet systems.

     FireNet is now carried on the Echomail Backbone and has many
     participating systems and even more users. A detailed account of the
     structure of FireNet is in the works and will be related in this forum
     by Chuck and Woody in a future article.

     Basically, FireNet is an Echo conference devoted to the Fire, EMS
     (Emergency Medical Services) and Public Safety sector. We discuss
     equipment, procedures, service related software, hazardous materials,
     service related legislation and other topics directly related to the
     Fire Services. It has been a valuable tool in communication and
     dissemination of bulletins and warnings.

     FireNet is available to anyone who has an interest in the Fire/ Rescue
     Services. It is available from the Host and western Hub (FireNet
     Leader, 128/16), from the eastern Hub (MetroFire, 135/14), or from the
     Echo Backbone. It is a moderated conference that anyone may read or
     post Fire/Rescue Service messages of international interest. A list of
     the systems carrying FireNet will appear in the Sanders/Wood article
     soon to be published.

     If you get a link into FireNet from the Backbone or your Regional Echo
     Coordinator, please let Woody or Chuck know about it by sending a
     Netmail message to 128/16. We are trying to compile a current list of
     participating systems.

     Try it. You'll like it. If you'd like to take a look at the Echo, you
     can call MetroFire at xxx-xxx-xxxx or FireNet Leader at xxx-xxx-xxxx
     or St. Joe's Hospital at xxx-xxx-xxxx or SoundingBoard at xxx-xxx-xxxx
     for starters.

     If you have any questions or comments, you may send them to me via
     FIDONEWS 13-33               Page 18                  12 Aug 1996


     Netmail to 135/14. I'll be happy to assist you in convincing YOUR
     department to set up a system and get into the FireNet Echo. For a
     complete ARC of all my previous FireNet articles and other FireNet
     material, you may GET via SEAdog or other Bark request type program
     the file FIRENET.ARC or just FIRENET. If you are unable to GET it, I
     will send it upon receipt of a Netmail request.

     FireNet. It's here. It works and it's growing.

                     READING COMPREHENSION

     Read the following carefully and answer the questions below.

       In addition to the obvious effects of solar activity on the upper
     atmosphere, some scientists contend that it also affects the weather.
     These contentions, however, are for the most part unconfirmed and some
     are very dubious.  Even further afield, a British researcher on
     epidemiology claimed last year that "the periods of world dominance of
     successive major subtypes of influenza A virus have synchronized
     closely with the periodicity of sunspots." Correlations of biomedical
     phenomenon with solar activity, such as this one, are generally not
     taken seriously by most Western scientists.  Many researchers in the
     Soviet Union, however, do believe in such possibilities, including
     even a correlation of sunspots with outbreaks of plague-spreading
     rodents in central Asia.

     1.  In what language is the British researcher speaking?
         a. Japanese   b. Urdu   c. Bengali   d. British   e. Media

         a. Hawaii   b. John Ford's longest film   c. nothing   d. correct

     3.  A conclusion that could be drawn from this passage is
         a. Russian scientists are idiots and Russia is full of rats
         b. The sun has sunspots
         c. Don't ask a question of a British researcher if you want an
            answer
         d. all of the above

     weighs 70 pounds, what is the probability that Juan can get anything
     he wants from Grover?

     pawnbroker gives him eleven dollars for it and then sells it for a
     hundred and twenty-five.
         What was the relative rate of mark-up in the watch in relation to
     half of its worth, if the worth is calculated at three-quarters the

                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     There is only one FidoNews [tm] but I hear there may be other local
     newsletters published in other Zones.

     The Question of the Week is:

     Do you publish [read] a locally produced Fidonews and why and when
     can we see one here?

     Answers may be made via Netmail, email, or as submissions to FidoNews.

     Thanks.

     C.B.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     Hello again from sunny Orlando, where things are odd, except when
     they're even. I got about 6 netmails with info for updates, more than
     I expected for my first week. Most of the info I got is summarized
     below.

     While I'm overjoyed to see the response -- at least 6 people actually
     noticed the column -- a lot of the messages raised more questions than
     they answered. I want to provide complete info in my updates, but
     that means I have to get complete info from submitters or I have to
     go search out the info. To help ease this, I'm including a form below.

     Most important: Where possible, I plan to verify everything with the
     author. Don't assume I know who wrote what. Being sure you include
     the author's name and node number can save me as much as an hour per
     package. Multiply by 100 packages and you can understand why I'm
     interested in getting complete info the first time... ;-)

     A bit of insight: My goal is to see this column again become a
     recognized standard. Hopefully, authors will issue updates directly
     as a matter of habit. I'll be happy to return the favor by including
     a leading blurb about their new releases.

     A note about ifmail: Eugene Crosser writes ifmail, but doesn't run
     CM; publishing his node in the list would be inappropriate. Pablo
     Saratxga maintains a set of patches to the ifmail source, called 'tx'.
     Pablo was kind enough to offer to keep the vanilla ifmail source up
     for FREQ so I could list it as well. Kudos, Pablo.
