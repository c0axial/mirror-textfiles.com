  There is an article in today's snooze that I am embarassed
to print. Why? because it is nothing more that a string of foul
mouthed, small minded insults against somebody that has worked
hard for fidonet for many years. It is somewhat typical of this
net, and one of the reasons fidonet is falling apart.

  Mr. Juda recently took down his internet gate.  He removed
it specifically because of the harrassment by a small group of
cyber terrorists. The fact is, though, that he ran that gate
for years on his own nickle, and on his own time. What thanks
does he get? An idiot that will not sign his name (C.I.A is
probably as good an alias as any for this well known braggart)
goes on a name calling spree and brags about how much better a
job s/he would have done if only they had been given a chance.

  Well, there were all the chances in the world. Still are.
Talk is cheap, and indicative of the mind that created it.

  Whatever fights Mr. Juda and C.I.A have had in the past are
irrelevant.  There was a lot of work done by Mr. Juda on our
behalf, and he deserves, at the very least, a thank you.  He
does not deserve to go out the door with some cyber-boor
shouting insults.

   So, Mr. Juda, thank you.  I do not  know  you,  and  I  have
never  corresponded  with you.  However, I have used the service
you provided, and you  deserve  the  thanks  of  at  least  this
fidonetter.

Internet Killed The Fidonet Star...
Is this the beginning of the end?

by Ronald Hass (2:240/5311.25 and rhass@rzbd.fh-hamburg.de)

Since spring 1995 the Internet began to boom. Articles concerning the
subject popped up in FidoNews whereas subjects concerning Fidonet
became rare.

Since summer 1995 the FidoNews began to drip across Fidonet. Every
other week it didn't reach my boss node. Then came three issues
together, two of them late. We got used to it.

Since fall 1995 FidoNews ceased to come at all. To keep the archive
of my boss node up to date I FTPed them via the Internet every week
and uploaded them. What a weird idea: I had to use the Internet to
get the major publication of the Fidonet!

Was it worth the effort? Reading the issues became pretty boring as
nothing of interest was submitted anymore. Where have all the authors
gone that felt commitment to their hobby? Where have all the
arguments gone about Steve Winter and Bob Germer, "four letter words"
in FidoNews, ANSI art, etc.?

When I FTPed the last issue of 1995 my heart jumped when I saw the
size of the file. Something had changed! There must be quite a bit of
articles in it, maybe the engaged authors came back!

I unpacked the file and sent it to the printer as I have done it all
the years. Usually I read the Snooze in the train when heading home
after work. This time I couldn't wait to see what's in there...

A mere outcry from the editors! Nothing had been submitted this week!
Don and/or Sylvia (never really found out who was writing the
editorial) had posted a chat log from just before Christmas from
their BBS to fill the gap. The essence of this "article" was the
essence of Fidonet!

To calm myself down I thought the reason might be the holiday season.
Everybody is busy with Christmas, nobody has time to write. It's going
to change with the first issue of 1996.

In fact it didn't. I don't want to review any articles in the first
two issues of 1996. Fact is that the third issue was an empty one
again. Sylvia obviously was fed up with the job of editoring nothing
and quit her job. This was the one and only nevertheless
important information contained in FidoNews 13-03. Did anybody
notice?

How long will it take until Don gets the same feeling? I don't blame
him.

Fidonet is breaking apart. Netmail is even more unreliable these days
than it has ever been. I get the impression that echomail in certain
FidoNews 13-05                 Page:  4                    29 Jan 1996

echoes is not routed worldwide properly anymore. SysOps seem to stick
to local communities. When their systems are of the bigger kind they
HAVE TO offer Internet access these days to their - in the
meantime mostly paying - "customers". The interest in keeping up a
worldwide functioning Fidonet is ceasing.

WWW is offering glossy magazines like www.hotwired.com. Who needs
FidoNews? Internet E-mail IS reliable. Who needs Fido Netmail?

BBSes decay to support centers where you call for the latest printer
driver or to chat with other users in your local community. And even
here the Internet offers glossy alternatives like "Internet Relay
Chat" and FTP sites like ftp.xxx.com which often are cared for far
better than the corresponding BBS. CompuServe, AOL and all the others
are close at hand. The same modem that served you for years as your
feed to the Fidonet now takes you to the data highway and connects
you even to The White House. Did they ever offer a Fido node?

I am afraid we have to accept this development if we like it or not.

I want to thank Donald and Sylvia for the good work they have done
during the past years. I read every issue of the Snooze within the
last four years and enjoyed it. I shall keep up to it to the last bit
even if it hurts.

I want to thank Tom Jennings for the whole of it. I still enjoy what
is left of Fidonet although the lights slowly go out.

And I want to thank everybody in Fidonet to whom I had contact even
if it was just reading. I derived a lot of pleasure and knowledge
from it.

Last but not least I want to thank my Fido boss at 2:240/5311. He was
and still is my mentor for years and introduced me to the wonders
of "modeming".

I wonder if somebody's left to read this...

Cheers to everybody,
Ron

The Modem Problem
by David de Regt

        Hello, all, I'm David de Regt, SysOp of Gargoyle Heaven at
(203)454-9841.  I'm new at this, so if the answer is just under my
nose, don't be surprised.  I run Frontdoor 2.12 Shareware and it
always connects at 2400 when sending mail.  It runs the BBS at 14400,
but anything to do with mail, it sends it at 240 CPS(2400 speed).
Does anyone have any tips to fix this?  I need HELP!!!  If so, send
them to 1:141/245.

** The Free Ride is Over! ***
BY C.I.A. CASINO NETWORK (1:2623/58)

 I, for one, say Good Riddance, Burt. If "The Gatekeeper" does not
 wish to act as a *real* Internet Email Gateway, get out of the way
 and let US do it! Your anal twit filtering and restrictions
 hampered communication.. It's not bad enough netmail/email has to
 rely on the feeble routing structure, but then to have every message
 sniffed for acceptibility, is ridiculous.

 I know I'll hear the whines and cries about how hard, expensive,
 etc, your job is/was... I'll hear the standard cop-out "You don't
 like it, do it yourself" - which is exactly what I plan to do...
 It's very incredibly simple, install linux, get a cheep SLIP, YOU
 GOT FULL USENET for the cost of yer SLIP!

 As far as personal email, thats relatively simple too, under a Unix,
 like BSD <gag> or Linux. Again, through a cheep SLIP account, this
 time, you need only have an ISP who assigns your slip in their hosts
 file - my system was, for example, fbn.<deleted>.com, I could get
 email as root@fbn, or any user name.... I am currently waiting for
 another company to open, one a little less anal than the one I was
 on..

You leeched off the IEEE long enough. For a $30 a month SLIP
acct, I can blow yer lame gateway a-way, friend... No, I have no
interest in pandering to the entire globe - anyone who is a
local call may be offered the service... *I* have no desire to
port usenet to fido - Unix is superior to DOS, and Usenet is
superior to FTS.

That really made me realise how incredibly anal your policies
were, was not so much the volume control, by disallowing
uuencode and mailing lists, but you admitted to me in UFGATE a
few months ago, August or so perhaps, that you had been
(unbeknowst to yourself) "accidently" deleting the  ENTIRE
fidonet domain's incoming email JUST TO TWIT ONE PERSON - Brent
Hamm!! (No, I didn't save the msg, so you're safe from me, but I
do recall sending copies to Alan Boritz and ... Bob Moravsik,
who I wouldn't be surprised to find still have the msg ;)

Enjoy your retirement, old man.. Internet is ready to fill your
void. Thank you for finally moving out of the way for it to do
that :)
