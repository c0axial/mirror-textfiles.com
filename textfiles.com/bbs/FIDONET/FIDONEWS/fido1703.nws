                             Is the Doggie Dead?
                                  Doug Myers

     "Is the doggie dead?" asks Roy Reed in email this week.  I'm at a
     loss to answer him.  Roy has never put up a BBS, but is a strong
     contributor to many echoes.  I formed a friendship with Roy in the
     BATPOWER echo, where we still enjoy trading techniques for writing
     old DOS batch files.  Ever since I've known Roy, he's been searching
     for a BBS... they keep closing down around him.  I believe that all
     the BBSes local to him shut down, and he's been teleneting to get
     Fido over the last year or so.  I'm not sure what prompted his
     question this time... he may have lost another BBS to Y2K issues or
     he may have just noticed a decline in traffic in his favorite
     echoes.

     But the Doggie will suffer at least a limp paw if Roy can't connect.
     He perches in the BATPOWER echo and watches the questions coming in.
     He's written some of the durndest batch solutions to sysop and user
     problems that I've ever seen, lending a lot of credibility that
     Fidonet is the place to be for help.


     Is the doggie dying?" asks Kent Anderson in his article in this
     issue.  Kent isn't in the Fidonet nodelist as he points off of Gary
     Craine's system, but Kent is, by any measure, a Big Man On Campus
     due to his moderator activities.  Kent spells out the dramatic
     decline in listed nodes over the past few years, and wonders aloud
     what it all means.

     I wonder what Fidonet would be like if Kent hadn't been around to
     guide the echoes he has.  Certainly he's conducive to the doggie's
     health and well-being.


     "Will the doggie survive?" asked John Boyer as 1999 drew to a close.
     John has run a BBS since the 80's, though it's been on auto-pilot
     for many years.  John sent me netmail in December thanking me for
     being a reliable hub for him, and telling me that his mailer,
     tosser, bbs, and computer were not Y2K compliant, so he'd be
     shutting down on December 31st.  I don't know if his nodelist
     segment has been deleted yet as I haven't gotten nodediffs since the
     new year started, but we're down one.


     "Is the doggie still barking?" asks Paulette Matthews when I phoned
     her regarding her system.  It stopped responding a couple of weeks
     ago, and I just wanted to see if she could use some help.  Her BBS
     was an old Renegade version (the last one which supported the 8088).
     After she upgraded her mother board, though, it was impractical to
     upgrade her Renegade package without destroying the user data base,
     so she continued running the old version.  Now the BBS won't
     FIDONEWS 17-03               Page 2                   17 Jan 2000


     initialize and needs replaced.  My guess is that she probably needs
     the patched version of Squish, too.

     I haven't removed her nodelist segment yet... I'm still a cosysop
     there from the old days, and I'm overdue to pay her family a visit.
     It won't be the first time I visited with disks in hand.  We'll
     avoid losing one, anyway.


     So how is the doggie's health?  I've related the condition of a few
     of the folks I know, only one of which is actually gone.  Sitting
     here, I see some sluggishness in echomail, but I don't know whether
     it's over Y2K problems or the aftermath of George Peace
     disconnecting from Fido.  One netmail from zone 2 took about sixteen
     days to get here... but is that a sign that things are fouled up or
     a sign that they're clearing?  I don't really know the state of the
     doggie... I guess it depends on how we all pull together.

                    The Sad State of Today's Fidonet

                             Kent Anderson
                      1:382.92.6, kand@jump.net

     For this week's Nodelist.014, statistics show that only 2,877 nodes
     remain in Zone 1, which comprises the USA and Canada. If we peer
     more deeply into the list, we find that there are nodes that are:

     Administrative    37
     Hosts            215
     Hubs             268
     Down              99
     Pvt              183
     Mail Only        390

     This means that in the entire United States and Canada, there are
     only 1,685 nodes which appear to be BBS's serving users and
     providing BBS services. The number is dropping by forty to fifty
     nodes each week. If one considers that only three and a half years
     ago, there were over 17,000 Zone 1 Nodes, with a proportionate
     number being full BBS's, it presents a very sad picture for the
     devotee of echomail and other more local services provided by such
     systems.

     The amount of echomail appearing in all echoes seems to drop each
     week as users are stranded with no point to pickup the messages.

     'tis a sad, sad case and it does not appear to have any end except
     that which appears inevitable.

     I surely hope that that band I hear in the background is not
     practising a funeral dirge.

     During a period of abnormal echo activity (I was actually getting
     echoes here briefly), I came across this fine offer in the Zone 1
     Coordinator Conference.  Extracted from echomail from Joe Nicholson
     to Clay Tannacore, here it is:

     --------------------

      Don't wait for Y2K!
        Time is already running out!
           Move quick on this deal!

     Hello fellow patriots, militia members, Clinton loathers, UN
     despisers, 2nd Amendment touters, NWO fighters, black-helicopter
     monitors, and other conspiracy theorists.

     As you may or may not know Y2K is coming, along with (suposedly):
     1) martial law (or marshall law for some of you)
     2) suspension of the Constitution
     3) misuse of Executive Orders to give overarching power to FEMA
     4) targetting of "militia/patriot" members for false charges by
        (insert name of law enforcement agency here)
     5) introduction of UN troops already training in secret bases to
         enforce the aforementioned martial law
     6) establishment of the New World Order in the form of the One
        World Government

     But, as is the case with almost all such grandiose doom and gloom
     predictions....

     IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!

     So before you hunker in your bunker, turn on your shortwave radios
     and light your already short fuses, time to invest in the future.

     Put a down payment on an excuse, alibi, rationale, or other means to
     explain away why your paranoid rants turn out to be DEAD BANG WRONG!

     There are loads to choose from!  Popular ones include:

     1) Our "knowledge" of the conspiracy ensured that it did not happen
        because "they" knew we'd be ready.
     2) Nothing happened on 1/1/00 so we will get complacent. But 1/2/00,
     FIDONEWS 17-03               Page 6                   17 Jan 2000


        look out!
     3) The UN troops were ready to march in and take over, but the tanks
        were driven by men who REFUSED to ask for directions and instead
        invaded Canada.
     4) When we said Clinton was going to declare Martial Law, we meant
        he'd declare the CBS show the best of the season!
     5) That crazy Pope Gregory reset the calendar and threw us for a
        loop. (Leads into the classic "Papist Plot" conspiracy extension
        pack. Sold seperately.)
     6) Sure it didn't happen at y2k, but we are TOTALLY ready for y3k!
     7) The takeover/martial law et. al. really DID happen. This is just
        the dream, or are we the dreamer? (Lewis Caroll collection
        available now at www.WackJobConspirayMetaphors.com)
     8) The entire armed plot couldn't stop giggling when Clinton said
        he'd declare himself "dictator".
     9) The UN realized that it wouldn't be able to set up a One World
        Government lead by a guy named "Kofi".

     and finally

     10) WE WERE WRONG FOR CRYING WOLF!

     Others available. Call for pricing.

     Yes, you too can be the envy of your militia cell as you explain
     away the last 18 months (or longer) of paranoid rants that never
     came to fruition.  Dazzle your fellow "patriots"!  Amaze "common law
     grand juries" for hours!

     Best of all, there is a 0% money back guarentee.  If there really IS
     all this crap crashing down on January 1, 2000, this company and its
     employees will marched off to the "UN concentration camps".  But YOU
     will have the warm, fuzzy feeling of knowing you are right as you
     drive a Ryder truck full of explosives into the UN Secretariat
     building. Isn't that just as good as money? (Especially if you
     figure the Federal Reserve Notes are not "real' money, and the US is
     bankrupt, and you can redeem your "straw man" just by following....)

     So contact us today!  Special for the Holidays:  Buy one excuse for
     Y2K not becoming the harbinger of the Apocalypse and we'll throw in
     one of the following lame explinations at NO extra charge!

     1) "Really, honey. This naked woman walked into our bedroom and said
        'Sleep with me or I'll die.'"
     2) "It wasn't me. It was the dog."
     3) "No I am not bitchy because of PMS!  Why do you think it is PMS?
     Do you think every opinionated woman has PMS?  Where the hell is my
     frying pan?" (Note: three day waiting period on acquiring this one)
     4) "That was the dog too."

     Hurry, supplies are limited!

     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.

     I would not normally forward an item as below but I happen to know

     this one is true.  I read the entire story of these two friends in a
     Readers Digest magazine. It made me think of the various incidences
     in Fidonet over the past few years, which made me feel close to
     friends in Fidonet I have never personally met.

     Fidonet is a very special place.  It is benevolent to every one
     equally... at least initially.  It is a place you can visit with
     friends and foes alike.

     It is nonviolent by it's very nature...physically; but it can be as
     devastating mentally when misused and abused by malcontents.
     Sometimes we may inadvertently jump to a wrong conclusion simply
     because we are in a bad mood, bad hair-day, or whatever.
     Nonetheless we read into some comment in some echo, that which in
     another time would have gotten a snicker or a snort, of humor or `so
     what'; and make it into something NOT!

     Which brings me to reality about the sensitivities of the
     personalities in our electronic echoes under the umbrella of
     Fidonet.  Perhaps the healing of all wounds would be the salvation
     of Fidonet if Fido-friends can forgive each others perceived
     shortcomings and enjoy the friendliness generated.

     ---I think this article is worth your time---8<--------------------

     One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my
     class was walking home from school. His name was Kyle. It looked
     like he was carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, "Why
     would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday? He must really be
     a nerd."

     I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my
     friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.

     As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They ran
     at him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so
     he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land
     in the grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this
     terrible sadness in his eyes. My heart went out to him. So, I jogged
     over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, I saw
     a tear in his eye.

     As I handed him his glasses, I said, "Those guys are jerks. They
     really should get lives."

     He looked at me and said, "Hey thanks!" There was a big smile on his
     face.

     It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude. I helped him
     pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As it turned out,
     he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen him before. He
     said he had gone to private school before now. I would have never
     hung out with a private school kid before.

     We talked all the way home, and I carried his books. He turned out
     to be a pretty cool kid. I asked him if he wanted to play football
     FIDONEWS 17-03               Page 12                  17 Jan 2000


     on Saturday with me and my friends. He said yes.

     We hung all weekend and the more I got to know Kyle, the more I
     liked him. And my friends thought the same of him. Monday morning
     came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of books again. I
     stopped him and said, "Darn boy, you are gonna really build some
     serious muscles with this pile of books everyday!" He just laughed
     and handed me half the books.

     Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we
     were seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on
     Georgetown, and I was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be
     friends, that the miles would never be a problem. He was going to be
     a doctor, and I was going for business on a football scholarship.

     Kyle was valedictorian of our class. I teased him all the time about
     being a nerd. He had to prepare a speech for graduation. I was so
     glad it wasn't me having to get up there and speak.

     Graduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He was one of those
     guys that really found himself during high school. He filled out and
     actually looked good in glasses. He had more dates than me and all
     the girls loved him!

     Boy, sometimes I was jealous. Today was one of those days. I could
     see that he was nervous about his speech. So, I smacked him on the
     back and said, "Hey, big guy, you'll be great!" He looked at me with
     one of those looks (the really grateful one) and smiled. "Thanks,"
     he said.

     As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began.
     "Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through
     those tough years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe
     a coach . . . , but mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of
     you that being a friend to someone is the best gift you can give
     them. I am going to tell you a story."

     I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of
     the first day we met. He had planned to kill himself over the
     weekend. He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his mom
     wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home. He
     looked hard at me and gave me a little smile. "Thankfully, I was
     saved. My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable."

     I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy
     told us all about his weakest moment. I saw his mom and dad looking
     at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not until that moment
     did I realize its depth.

     Never underestimate the power of your actions. With one small
     gesture you can change a person's life. For better or for worse.
     God puts us all in each other's lives to impact one another in some
     way.

     Each day of your life is a gift! Don't forget to say, "Thank you!"

     Jesus and Moses

     Jesus and Moses were playing golf one day on Earth. The course they
     were on had a particularly difficult hole, and Moses expressed his
     doubts that Jesus could make the shot over the water.

     "Ah no, Moses, I think I can do it," explained Jesus. "I've seen
     Arnold Palmer make this shot, and if Arnold Palmer can do it, then
     so can I."

     Moses rolled his eyes and let Jesus try. Sure enough, the ball
     splashed into the water. Moses parted the water for Jesus, who went
     in to retrieve his ball. Jesus, however, was not ready to give up.

     "I know I can do this, Moses -- I've seen Arnold Palmer do it, and
     if he can do it, then so can I."  True to form, however, Jesus' ball
     ended up back in the water. Moses parted the water, and Jesus went
     in to retrieve the ball.

     "Look, Jesus," said Moses. "Try again if you like, but I'm not
     parting the water for you again."

     "Fair enough, Moses," said Jesus. "But you know, I've seen Arnold
     Palmer make this shot, and if Arnold Palmer can do it, then so can
     I."  Once again, Jesus' ball was in the water. Jesus proceeded to
     walk upon the water to get it.

     Another group of golfers came up behind Moses and saw Jesus walking
     on the water.

     "Holy Cow!" one of them said to Moses. "Who does that guy think he
     is, Jesus Christ?"

     "No," said Moses, rolling his eyes. "He thinks he's Arnold Palmer."
