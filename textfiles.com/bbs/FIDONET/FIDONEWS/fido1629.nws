     Greetings,

     Yes, thanks very much.  I'm feeling just about 100% again. :-)
     This flu is something else, believe me. But don't ask me what it
     was, I'm no doctor. ;-)

     However, on with the show.

     According to Doug's article, there is a new Z1C. Great. Soon we will
     see an official announcement in FidoNews, or will we?

     In order to determine how many of you read the Snooze, either by when
     you receive this copy, reading it on-line at your nearest BBS in the
     FIDONEWS echo or at http://www.fidonews.org or by whatever means, is
     it possible to let me know, by sending me either a Netmail at
     5:7104/2 or e-mail me at hwolsink@catpe.alt.za  --  I'll appriciate
     your reply.  Thanks in advance.

     And as usually, happy reading,

                        The Slippery Slope of Control
                           Douglas Myers, 1:270/720
                          douglas.myers@k12.ftn.org

     Mike O'Conner, Region 12 Coordinator, is possibly one of the most
     respected coordinators in Fidonet.  He was widely perceived as a
     critic of "control" politics when he allowed Region 10 "refugee"
     nodes to join Region 12 rather than put up with the control politics
     which were at issue in Region 10 at the time.  It's ironic that
     today he faces the criticism of his own region over a control issue.

     MIke is under fire for not accurately reporting his region's choice
     of candidate in the Z1C election.  During this last week in the Z1C
     election process, Net Coordinators polled their nets to determine
     the sysops' choice for Z1C.  This information was to be relayed to
     the RC who would then vote in accordance with his region's wishes in
     the closed election.

     Region 12's choice for Z1C was me, followed by David Moufarrege.
     MIke, however, waited until most of the RC votes were in and took
     note that I didn't have sufficient support to win the election, and
     that David was the only candidate who could win on the first ballot.
     So he cast the deciding vote for David.

     Ross Cassell, Election Coordinator, responded to a netmail protest
     from Region 12.  In this response, Ross ruled that Mike's vote would
     not be overturned. Though he conceded that Mike was answerable to
     his region for his actions, he pointed out that the elections rules
     did not have a provision for forcing an RC to vote in accordance
     with his region's wishes.  He also pointed out that a reversal of
     this vote was unlikely to produce a different winner.

     Under Ross' scenario, had Mike actually reported the R12 vote
     accurately, it would have forced a decision by Bob Satti to break
     the tie for second place between Dallas Hinton and me, and then a
     runoff between David and the survivor in second place.  Ross feels
     that David would have picked up one of the votes from the regions
     whose candidate was eliminated, thus giving him the majority he
     needed on the second round.


     As a Region 13 sysop, I'll certainly have no say in the upcoming
     Region 12 RC election... and I certainly have no authority over the
     Z1C Election Coordinator.  However, as an "aggrieved party," I'll
     claim my traditional Fidonet right to add my two cents to the
     discussion :)

     Strangely, I've got no anger towards Mike O'Conner.  All he took
     which may have been mine is a bit of fleeting "score."  I believe
     that I'd have needed to carry at least one other region which went
     to David in order to mount a meaningful second round challenge.  I

     almost sympathize with Mike... he was placed in an untenable
     position.  The RCs were concerned about the consequences of a direct
     sysop election and retained their traditional control over the final
     results.  Though they made a pledge to represent the will of their
     regions, is it so surprising that one of their rank yielded to the
     temptation of control at the last moment?

     Nor do I have a quarrel with the election coordinator.  It was clear
     from the start that the RCs would have ultimate control over the
     final selection of the Z1C, and I doubt that the vote could or
     should be overturned now.

     I would argue instead that the RCs learn from this experience and
     apply it to the next election.  Consider that the time has come for
     a direct count of the sysops' vote.  Consider that the expected
     pandemonium and degeneration of the election process during the
     period when sysop voting was happening never materialized.  Consider
     that the most significant breach of the election process, though it
     may have been well-meant, came from among your number.

     Consider that the representative method of voting had an unintended
     (and, as yet, unanalyzed) consequence:  that some of the most
     interested and qualified sysops did not vote in this election.  I'm
     referring mostly to the net coordinators who mostly seemed to
     suppress their own voice in favor of shepherding their net's vote.
     It seemed to me that most of the nets where detailed information was
     supplied were small nets, three and four nodes... so these net
     coordinators may have been as much as 25% of the eligible voters.  I
     don't know if NCs counted themselves into the voting tally they
     reported, but I suspect that NCs suppressed their own vote when it
     would have overturned the results from the rest of their nodes.  I
     have no way of proving this and I doubt that it materially affected
     the actual election results in the current election... but it can't
     be good to have as much as 25% of the electorate involved in the
     mechanics of the election.

     Finally, my condolences to David Moufarrege.  You won this election
     convincingly, you ran a clean campaign, and you deserve to assume
     the Z1C position without the stigma which this election blemish will
     attach to you.  It's unfair and deplorable, but some will use this
     to question the legitimacy of your election... to deny you your
     mandate.  Some will forget, or choose to ignore, that you actually
     were the choice of the sysops in this election.  I'd like to take
     this opportunity to remind them.

     Let's all not forget that this is the closest which Zone 1 has ever
     come to a direct sysop election for Z1C.  Though it may not have
     been perfect, the election was a success in that the sysops of Zone
     1 had a real voice in the ZC selection.
