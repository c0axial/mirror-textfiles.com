Editorial: Controvery Central

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

More interesting and enlightening articles this week on the subject of
aliases and user-verification. I hope everyone reads them; I have. I
hope the discussion continues!!!


David French is no longer able to do the FidoNews Program Versions
list. It's being transferred to someone else, and should be complete
in a week or two or three. I think the new process will be better
than the old one David inherited. Watch this space for Important
Announcements.


On another subject, last week there was an article about a sysop
getting poor treatment at the hands of fellow sysops; turns out there
were other sides to the story, as always; the original author has
apologized and all involved are on their way to straightening it all
out. Everyone involved has been quite civilized.

I've received three rather lengthy articles elaborating on this, which
I am going to decline to run here, because it has become rather
personal. The down side of this is, FidoNews will have presented one
side of a story that has many sides. Also, the story is of interest
only to the people involved.

So if you are interested, you can filerequest from FidoNews! (1:1/1)
or manually download (415-863-2739/HST) the file "MELODY", which
contains the three articles.

I hope this satisfies the need to provide the information to those
involved, allow others to see what's going on, and yet avoid
embroiling the FidoNews in a local controversy.


And last but not least, one of the articles about aliases directly
addresses the issue of women BBS callers and how they are frequently
treated in our male-dominated network.

I thought I would personalize the issue of handles and alias
use.  I make no pretense to speak to issues outside those faced
on my board, and have no answers except for this board.

Karma *VS* Dogma is a single line, CM, no fees board.  All
users are voice valdiated by myself for reasons which will be
come clear.  KVD was designed to be a safe board for people who
did not otherwise have a local FIDO board.  Except for echos I
want and a couple that have been brought in as klutz fodder,
all echos are unique in my net and area.

This is not a gay board, but I do carry all of the Fido gay
echos, and import Women to KVD.  This is not gender issue
board, though I do carry GENDER and have carried others.  I
happen to be a Taoist hence I carry a couple of Pagannet echos.
I do not pass through any echo, all replys are send back the
way they come to ensure complience with policy.

KVD also carries a great many of the 12 step recovery echo
where handles and abreveated names are common.  I carry SIP_SAA
as a key secured area for members of that fellowship.  There
are a fairly large number of physical/mental recovery echos.

As is probably well known some of the users of this board are
open to abuse and attack because of who or what they are.  Gays
and lesbians, people with transgender issues, and believers in
spiritual traditions other than the normal three are often
attacked, and in some cases have been severely injured and
killed.  If membership in certain 12 step programs were to
become public knowledge there can be damage to a persons
personal and business life.

For these reasons KVD is primarily an alias board.  Real names
must be given to the sysop at logon, and I verify these in my
validation calls, as I check for the age of the callers.  All
considerations other than security and safety are secondary.

At the present time Katty Kornor is also carried here.  Using
what ever method they felt proper the moderators have declared
their echo to be real names only.  Even though they have
explained why, I still fail to understand.  Several times I
have considered dropping it because of this.  Maximus makes it
easy by putting in a real name kludge, though some problems
crop up at times.

FidoNews 9-10                  Page 3                       9 Mar 1992


This has caused a conflict that seems to have no answer.  How a
board where people can log on and talk to others in a
supporting environment can also have echos that automatically
break their anonymous standing is something I have not worked
out yet.  I may have to drop KK and Xpress it from 1:290/627 or
290/4 for my personal use.

I would hope that moderators would remember that use of an
alias can be an important part of dealing with reality.  This
board has been used by 12 steppers and young gays and lesbians
as a way to discuss things with others in the same spot, and in
a couple of instances may have been part of what convinced a
suicidal person to try something else first.

An alias does not mean someone is trying to hide from you or
from reality, it may in fact be one of the few ways someone in
a world of hurt can reach out for help.

Ex-Libris BBS, Windrush Farm, 1:221/192 (Ontario, Canada)

    Two articles  form  FNEWS909  struck  both  raw  nerves  and
bemusement  at  the  same  time ... at least from this sysop.  I
refer to the extremely well done article  on  privacy,  and  the
annoyance  expressed  by  Mr.  Cosby over the net's treatment of
"Melody".

    Why bemusement? Because the ban on aliases is  the  silliest
damn  thing that I have ever seen.  The average sysop has a name
typed in over a modem and a  telephone  number.   The  telephone
number  may be checked, but probably at the most to see if there
is a modem at the other end  of  it.   Why  on  earth  does  the
die-hard  anti-alias person assume that John Smith is not really
Janet Smith.  I would be tremendously surprised if 1%  of  users
are sex-checked or identity-checked by their sysops.

    The  reason  that  fidonet  is 99% women is simple. The node
list is laden with anti-women  bigots.   Most  women  cannot  be
bothered  with  the  hassle  of  hate mail, obscene phone calls,
being treated as idiots,  etc.   Being  reasonably  intelligent,
they  therefore  use  men's  names  when BBSing.  At a guess, at
least twenty percent of the persons on an echo are aliased.

    Incidentally,  to  those of you that doubt this, the reverse
can be done by those men that choose to educate themselves.  Log
into  a  few  boards as a woman, and post normally.  You will be
astonished.  Better yet, log in as both male  and  female,  then
compare the treatment accorded you.

FidoNews 9-10                  Page 4                       9 Mar 1992


    Practically,  there is no ban on an alias on Fido.  There is
only a ban on poorly chosen names.

    As to the problems of Melody ... she  has  my  sympathy  and
support.   That  a  woman  needs  to  pretend masculinity to use
fidonet is both scandalous and puerile.

                         Attending IBECC '92
                         -------------------

IBECC '92 is an intensive THREE-DAY conference. Sessions planned include:
"Introduction to BBSing" (What is a BBS, and How Do I Use It?), "BBSes and
the Law" (The Legal Rights and Responsibilities of BBS Operators and
Users), "Safe Computing" (The Detection and Prevention of Computer
Infection), "Rumor Control 1992" (Knowing the Difference Between Fact and
Fiction, and Taking Action Where Needed), "Why Kelly CAN Read" (An
Exploration into Education and the Computer), "NREN" (The National
SuperComputer Highway and How it Will Affect Us All), "Staying Alive"
(BBSing, Electronic Communication and the Homebound / Physically
Challenged), and "Security? What's That?" (The What, Why, and How of
Keeping Your Data and Information Safe).

Should you attend? If you have an interest in electronic communications,
bulletin boards, telecommuting, security or safe computing, yes. If you
would like to understand what a "hacker" is, and is not, and what you can
do to protect your electronic privacy, yes. If your children make more use
of your modem or computer than you do, yes.  In fact, unless you have
absolutely no interest in using your computer for interacting with the
world, you should be there!

So that the conference will retain its personal and informal atmosphere,
attendance at IBECC '92 is strictly limited.

                            What Is IBECC?
                            --------------

IBECC is a Non-Profit Educational, Scientific, Literary and Charitable
Society (IRS 501(c)(3) applied for).  Incorporated in Colorado, IBECC's
purposes include the promotion of national and international electronic
communications, the advancement of telecommunications and
teleconferencing, the improvement of communications between electronic
networks, education in the uses, requirements, and security of online
services, and general support of the electronic community.

A non-profit organization, IBECC is much MORE than just another `trade
show' -- it is a year-round clearing house for ideas, news, and relevant
information.  IBECC represents the interests and concerns of not only the
professional, but the hobbyist and home user as well.
FidoNews 9-10                  Page 6                       9 Mar 1992


IBECC is primarily Volunteer-Run.  Membership (currently $25.00/year
individual, $100.00/year corporate) pays for the IBECC Newsletter and
electronic Bulletin Board System (BBS), telephones, support and
information services, etc. - not salaries.  The founders of IBECC, who are
all handicapped, are extensively involved in computer networks and
electronic communications, and also run several BBSes in the Denver area.

SysOp, The Graphics WorkShop BBS, 1:123/57 (Memphis TN)

I would like to send a quick word out to all of you that have
installed my on-line GIF file viewer door.  There is a new release
available, version 1.20.

Version 1.20 provides significant enhancements over versions 1.00 and
1.10.  The file search method used is much improved.  New user screens
that provide better information about the GIFs selected for preview
are now in place as well.  Error detection and handling are greatly
enhanced too.  I strongly urge anyone running version 1.00 or 1.10
to upgrade to the new version.

Many thanks to all of you that have FREQed and installed OLVIEW.  I
had no idea that this crazy idea would be of interest to so many
people.

Birth of the Battetech Echo.
by Mark Wandrey
The 1st Circuit BBS
1:231/340 in Magnificent Indianapolis Indiana
317-545-7340

The Battletech echo is now available for private distribution from
1:231/340, the 1st Circuit BBS. For those who are unfamiliar with
Battletech, it is a game of miniature combat placed in the far future.
There are also a line of Role Playing products created for the same
universe as well as a number (more than 12) novels writen for the same
universe.

This new echo is to provide an outlet for discussions on Battletech the
game and the universe that FASA has created around it. Moderated by
Mark Wandrey, topics can include anything from rules questions to talk
about the newest novel that ROC may have published. Only conversations
about other game systems and companies are off topic.

The Battletech echo will be Elisted as BATTLETECH, and will only be
available from 1:231/340 until such time as a network of systems is
established or it goes national backbone.

If you are interested in carrying this echo, contact 1:231/340 via Net
Mail or, call Mark Wandrey at 317-547-1100 and ask for extension #302.

Rush-Fan Echo Started

Hi All! When I began my BBS system back in 1990, Cygnus X-I, I didn't
realize how many SySops in Fido-land (and elsewhere) shared a common
interest in both the music and philosophy of the rock-band "RUSH".
After being in Fido (and several other nets) along with semi-frequent
calls to online information services such as Prodigy and Compuserve,
I noticed quite a few BBS's and commercial conferences sharing in
discussions about the band, its social and political views and lyrics
FidoNews 9-10                  Page 9                       9 Mar 1992


and other items of interest to the die-hard Rush fan.

I have decided therefore to open-up a "Rush-Conference" based here in
Southington Connecticut. The topic of discussion in this echo will be
anything and everything to do with the band and of course, its
prominent lyrics.  Since this would be considered a 'specialized'
echo, those of you running some kind of Rush-themed system (and I
have seen many out there with names such as "2112", "Madrigal",
"Reverse Polarity" etc) or those of you just interested in the group,
I urge you to send me netmail and I will turn you on for the echo.
All participants in the echo will be asked to poll my system once a
week or once every several weeks as the load will most-likely not be
that great.

If you wish to get started with the echo (the more the merrier!) please
send me netmail at 1:141/885 or 1:141/1800 or contact me on my BBS
in CT at 203-628-9702. The conference tag is RUSH_FAN.


----------------------------------------------------------------------


BRIT_CAR is a Zone One Backbone echo devoted to the discussion of
the various vehicles produced in the United Kingdom and exported
into North America.  The purpose of the echo includes:

    - trouble shooting;
    - provide a forum for the many British car clubs in North
      America to announce events etc.;
    - to act as a forum for various owners to locate parts and
      suppliers;
    - provide a forum for those with an interest in British
      automotives to discuss their various concerns and to act
      as a platform for a greater desimination of knowledge.

Messages of a technical nature from the UseNet British-cars mailing
list are regularly crossposted into the echo.

Additionally, this conference supplements the current backbone
conference devoted to various automobiles.  The current conference
is mainly aimed at North American vehicles, which bear little
resemblence to anything produced in the UK.  British cars tend
to be either specialised and bear little resemblence to anything
else (ie Jaguars), have a great commonality (Mini's, MG's etc),
or be a mesh of British and American technology (TR-8, Sunbeam
Tiger etc.). Furthermore, it would be of benefit to those British
car owners to be able to discuss their vehicles without wading
through the traffic of American car owners discussing how Corvettes
are better than Mustangs which are better than...

New echo: FIDO_MOD

Why?
Because great efforts are being taken by several control freaks to
undermine moderator ownership of backbone FidoNet Echos and the current
"moderator" echos are being moderated by the aforementioned and so the
discussion/expose of their efforts has been declared "off-topic".

How?  At this time FIDO_MOD can be picked up from 1:3641/238

Who?
Open to all.

Huh?
If the principle that a moderator owns their echo can be sucessfully
undermined, then no moderator's echo is safe.  The premise that "those
paying to distribute the backbone deserve editorial control above
moderators" could ruin FidoNet.
