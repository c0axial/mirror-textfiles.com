                Everything You ever wanted in an Echomail
                  Processor but were afraid to ask for!

     by Philip J. Buonomo

     (1:107/583) or
     (7:520/583) or
     (9:807/1)

     What would the 'dream' echomail processor be like?  Well, what
     causes most of the problems for sysops who want to process
     echomail nowadays?  Hmmm, how about DUPES, lost messages,
     flaming, off-topic messages, lack of moderator control, relative
     slowness of processing time, MEGA-bytes of disk space being taken
     up by SOMEONE ELSE'S ARCmail...

     The list goes on...

     At FIDOcon '88, Butch Walker used a phrase several times that
     caught my attention when talking to the software developers.  He
     said (paraphrased), "We'll tell you what we want, then you guys
     can write it."

     Well, here's what I would like to see.  How about an echomail
     processor that can guarantee NO dupes?  And get RID of those
     SEEN-BY, PATH, EID, etc. lines!  They just take up desperately
     needed disk space.  (And who wants to look at 'em?)

     While we're at it, why should I have to keep (in multiple
     ARChives) copies of THE SAME CONFERENCES simply because they're
     going to different systems?  This seems like the biggest waste of
     disk space going!

     And speaking of wasted disk space, why do we ALWAYS have to read
     those FLAMES and off-topic messages that seem to proliferate thru
     the echos?  Those don't just waste disk space, they cost MONEY,
     as in phone bills sending that 'stuff' (insert four letter word
     here) around the country!  My 'dream' echomail processor will
     HAVE to have some way to give the moderator COMPLETE control over
     message content.

     And another thing...  I want my dream echomail processor to be
     completely controlled from my end.  I'm TIRED of having to wait
     DAYS for some other sysop to have to link me into a conference
     just because he's too lazy or too technically naive to set it up
     for me!

     There should be some way to password/protect conferences that are
     secure.  Let's face it, without full control by the moderator,
     ANYone can get ANY echo if they really want it!

     My dream echomail processor would also be the FASTEST available.
     FidoNews 5-50                Page 2                   12 Dec 1988


     I want it to be able to process a 2 meg 'star bundle' and make it
     available for others in SECONDS (yes, under 60, not 60 thousand).

     I also want my dream processor to handle the necessary control
     file for me (yes, I want a maximum of ONE), because I can't be
     bothered setting up AREAS.BBS or ECHO.CTL or any of that
     nonsense.  I want to type something like "Add the TREK
     conference", and expect to GET it next mail event!

     And of course, my dream processor shouldn't CARE what's in a
     message's Origin line, or tear line, or should even NEED any of
     those! (Who was it that said that God wanted to create hot air so
     he invented politicians?  ;-)

     This processor would have had to go thru extensive beta testing,
     too.  I'm tired of 'new' programs that appear on the market and
     screw up my system for WEEKS.

     And of course, it would have to be able to work with ANY BBS
     software package available today that's already doing echomail.

     Science fiction, right?

     Still, wouldn't all that be swell?

     (Music: "When you wish upon a star...")

     You know what?

     Sometimes dreams come true!

     INTRODUCING GROUPMAIL, a REVOLUTIONARY way of processing
     conferences!

     No, all that is NOT science fiction!  Its here now, and it WORKS!

     GROUPmail is the method by which ECHOmail should have worked in
     the first place.

     Here's a bit of history:

     Echomail was invented by Jeff Rush as a conferencing system for
     FidoNet mail systems (basically the Fido BBS program itself, at
     that time).  His programs became very popular, to the point where
     almost all systems in the public amateur network were using it.
     Later, Bob Hartman wrote his Confmail system, which was faster
     than the original echomail programs, but which worked in
     essentially the same manner.

     Over time, as more and more systems tied into more and bigger
     echomail conferences, several problems surfaced.  For instance,
     maintaining a good topology that will not cause duplicate
     messages requires a high degree of knowledge and cooperation
     between the various systems, and the continual unpacking,
     recreation, and repacking of messages requires a great deal of
     computer resources.  Operating even a small echomail distribution
     system (by today's standards) requires many megabytes of disk
     space, much processor time, and quite a lot of human intervention
     and maintenance.

     Group mail has none of these problems, because it takes a
     fundamentally different approach to conference distribution.


     This basic difference can be summed up as follows:

     With echomail, you tell your system where to SEND a conference.

     With group mail, you tell your system where to GET a conference.


     Echomail was based on the Fido network mail mechanism, and works
     by creating network mail messages to other systems.  As enhanced
     by ARCmail (and as later incorporated into Confmail), it uses the
     "file attach" mechanism to ship mail archives to other systems.
     Group mail instead uses the "file update request" mechanism to
     obtain mail archives from other systems.

     Group mail is a "star-based topology", meaning that several
     systems connect to one central (or "star") system.  This star
     system may in turn be one of several that connect to a higher
     level star.  The topology may be (and probably will be) different
     for every conference.

     The topmost star system in any given conference is the "top
     star".  A person using that system may then be the "moderator" of
     that conference.  All messages flow upward to the top star, and
     FidoNews 5-50                Page 4                   12 Dec 1988


     then back down to the conference participants.

     Since all messages MUST flow thru the top star before being
     distributed to the participating nodes, the moderator has
     COMPLETE control over the content of ALL the messages in the
     conference.  He can remove FLAMES, or off-topic messages BEFORE
     they are distributed.

     In any given conference, any star other than the top star is a
     "middle star".

     For any given conference that you connect to, if you are not the
     top star then there is one system that you obtain the conference
     from. That person is your "uplink".

     Watch how this saves disk space:

     Suppose, for example, that you are a middle-star receiving two
     megabytes a day which you then pass on to fifty local systems.
     How much disk space do you need?

     With echomail the answer is 100 megabytes!  In fact, to allow for
     occasional glitches in distribution, you'll need more like 200
     megabytes. With group mail you need two megabytes for every day
     of traffic you retain. If you retain group mail archives for
     three days, you'll need six megabytes.

     How long will it take you to process those two megabytes?  If
     you're running echomail, I don't even want to think about it!
     But with group mail it will take on the order of three seconds.

     One aspect of echomail that is conspicuously absent from group
     mail are the "vanity lines" (the tear line and the origin line at
     the end of each message).  Group mail does not require an origin
     line because the original address is preserved in the message
     header.  Also, group mail does not use SEEN-BY lines or PATH
     lines, so without an origin line there's no need to stick in a
     tear line.

     However, some folks really like those little taglines advertising
     their system, so the developers made it possible to stick them in.

     Whew! Enough for now!  Let me just summarize by saying that all
     that I described in the first part of this article is available
     NOW.  All you have to do is File REQuest from my system (or any
     of my friends who also have a copy).

     If you want to see the state of the art in GROUP Message
     Conferencing, just pickup a copy of GROUP201.ARC from my system,
     1:107/583 (in FIDOnet), 7:520/583 (in the Alliance), or 9:807/1
     (in Phoenix/Net).  Or you could just call 1-201-935-1485 and d/l
     it directly.  However you get it, GET IT, and ENJOY! (Yes, its
     SHAREWARE, NOT FREEWARE...)

     Thanks for your kind attention!

              Recommendations on Current IFNA Bylaws Ballot


     As the author of several of the proposed bylaws changes, a
     Director of IFNA, and a member of the Bylaws committee that has
     been working on these proposals, it is my belief that at the
     present time I am as familiar with the bylaws and IFNA's needs as
     anyone else.  Accordingly, I have decided to provide the
     following list of recommendations.  Please note that this
     information is MY OWN and does not necessarily reflect any
     "official" view of those bodies referred to above.

     Normally I'd prefer to take a more positive approach and indicate
     which items to vote FOR.  But as the majority of the proposed
     changes are positive, I'll concentrate on the negative.


     NAY Votes Recommended
     =====================

     DEF.01 - It is suggested that the term "IFNA Network" be kept to
     refer to that entire group of Networks that communicate utilizing
     the FidoNet protocol and that have entered into agreement with
     IFNA (see the NEW amendment on Agreements near the end of the
     list).  Also, please read my article on IFNA direction for more
     detail regarding this viewpoint.

     DEF.02 - I originally wrote this amendment to bring the bylaws
     into closer agreement with the contract that IFNA has with Tom
     Jennings.  However, with the spread of other nets and the
     awarding of IFNA's 501c3 status, I now recommend against this
     amendment.  Again, see my article on IFNA direction.

     DEF.04 - The International Coordinator is a FidoNet position.
     Eventually, it is quite possible that OtherNets, all
     communicating in the total FidoNet-protocol community, will also
     have their own "International Coordinators."  Hence, it makes
     sense to omit this definition.  The reference to the "election"
     of an IC certainly has had no bearing in practice to date.
     Eventually, this may all be subject to negotiated agreements
     between IFNA and Network entities.

     01.02 - This is an attempt to enfranchise ALL members of FidoNet
     as members of IFNA.  If FidoNet provides its own internal
     democratic processes to cover its own operation and IFNA
     restricts itself to the overall FidoNet protocol-using community,
     there is no need for this.  In addition, agreeements between IFNA
     and all network entities may address this matter if it is needed.

     01.03 - The same points made in the previous paragraph apply
     against this amendment as well.

     01.04 - Again, another attempt at the same thing.  By making
     FidoNews 5-50                Page 7                   12 Dec 1988


     membership in IFNA not be associated with any internal net
     matters, the need for every sysop in a net to have voting rights
     for operational matters no longer applies to IFNA.

     01.05 - This amendment made some good attempts to work out a
     compromise whereby all sysops could have a vote on operational
     matters.  However, despite its attempts to reduce costs, IFNA
     would still have to bear a burden of administrative overhead
     which is unfair.  In any event, it and the three amendments that
     precede it, are no longer relevant if we go the route of
     establishing formal agreements between IFNA and network entities.

     24.02 - I am very much in favor of International Representation
     in IFNA.  However, I suggest voting against this proposal because
     it gives an unfair advantage to the Southern Pacific area.  With
     approximately 5% of the total nodes, they would have roughly 20%
     of the Divisional Directors.  This situation wherein the
     percentages of constituents within the respective divisions is
     constantly changing is a good reason to vote FOR 24.08, as
     changing these ratios through by-laws amendment is impractical.
     For instance, Europe has twice as many nodes as Division 12;
     therefore IT should be considered as the one with an additional
     representative, not zone 12.

     24.06 - I have seen figures idicating that roughly 92 nodes exist
     in AlterNet and GoodEggNet combined that are not also in FidoNet.
     This is approximately 2% of the entire community.  But Divisional
     Directors are to represent roughly 9% of the community each.
     Representation for nodes that cannot be represented through
     existing means should be a matter of negotiated agreement between
     IFNA and their network administration(s).

     24.07 - See previous paragraph.

     29 - This bylaw change, by REMOVING a provision, is an attempt to
     separate IFNA from FidoNet operation.  As it appears that that is
     already an accepted direction and as it is a possibility that the
     VP-TC might still be responsible for a Nodelist of the overall
     IFNA Network (i.e., that network comprised of ALL FidoNet-
     compatible technology that has entered into agreement with IFNA)
     there is no compelling reason to remove this requirement at the
     present time.

     39 - This amendment removes the right to establish policy of
     FidoNews from the IFNA Board of Directors, meaning such policy
     could only be changed by the membership of IFNA as a whole.  This
     certainly seems to limit our flexibility, should there ever be an
     instance where changes become necessary.  It should be obvious
     that even if the BoD ever did change policy in some unpopular
     way, as unlikely as that may be, the membership would still have
     the right to reverse them during the next election.  So far, the
     Board has shown no desire to change current policies, indeed, it
     has reaffirmed them.  Therefore, why should we reduce our
     flexibility?

     IMPORTANT YEAS
     ==============

     To end this article on a positive note, I should like to make the
     following points on some proposals for which I feel a "YEA" is
     especially important.

     24.08 - As FidoNet grows, the ratios of Divisional representation
     to the number of constituents should remain constant across all
     Divisions.  As can be seen from all the amendments trying to make
     adjustments, the present method of change is one which is
     cumbersome at best.  The Board of Directors should be given the
     responsibility to maintain equal repesentation for all, so this
     amendment should be accepted.  However, there is a problem with
     this amendment in that guidelines are not provided to the BoD to
     ensure that they do such modifications within those bounds.  This
     amendment, if accepted now, will be worked on by the By-laws
     committee so that such direction is included on the next ballot.

     35.02 - This is an important protection to minority interests.

     40.02 - As can be seen from this ballot, our bylaws are in
     considerable need of work.  To considerable extent, IFNA has
     fallen into trouble on numerous occasions because the bylaws were
     too inflexible, unclear, or impractical to follow.  This
     amendment is a workable compromise between giving the Board the
     power to do what is necessary for IFNA to get its work done in
     timely fashion, and for protection and direction from the
     membership.

     NEW-02 - This amendment provides IFNA with separation from
     operational concerns, but directs it to provide various
     services
     such that those Nets will wish to become associated with IFNA.
     By
     providing formal agreements between IFNA and each network entity,
     it can be assured that both side's interests are protected and it
     can be a tremendous force toward reducing some of the squabbles
     we have experienced.

     NEW-03 - Note that the Grievance procedure applies ONLY to
     internal IFNA matters and to such network entities as CHOOSE to
     adopt it as part of a formal agreement.  It is NOT being shoved
     down anyone's throat; but it is there if the need is felt by
     sysops of any particular net.  It also serves as the basis for
     conflict resolution BETWEEN nets which have opted to subscribe to
     its principles.

     NEW-04 - The States (and countries) are generally very backward
     when it comes to including new technologies in business methods.
     There really is no legal basis for doing business through such
     means as EchoMail because the law has yet to catch up.  We need
     this bylaw to serve as a mandate for our use of such
     technological advances, both as a protection against question,
     and as a means to optimize our limited and scattered resources.

                    Problems Between IFNA And FidoNet
                       ...and a Potential Solution

     For much of the last couple years I have heard a great deal to
     the effect that IFNA doesn't listen to the sysops of the net.
     I've always had cause to doubt this because during my term as
     President, whether I agreed or not, I always tried to listen to
     what sysops at all levels had to say and allowed their thoughts
     to at least simmer in the back of my consciousness.  Quite a few
     of the Directors with whom I interacted also demonstrated this
     trait.  To some degree this must have worked because in the last
     few months I have beeen hearing to greater degree that IFNA
     should not pay as much attention to what sysops have to say and
     that we should just get on with what we have to do.

     This points out the first problem.  The officials of IFNA
     definitely consider themselves to be REPRESENTATIVES of the
     sysops and users of FidoNet.  After all, the reason they joined
     IFNA in the first place was to promote FidoNet; not some abstract
     idea.  They all feel that it is their duty to represent, as best
     they can, the wishes of their constituents.  You would think
     then, that more would have been done by IFNA, but that brings us
     to the second problem.

     As representatives of BOTH the membership of IFNA and also of the
     Sysops and users of FidoNet, the directors are subject to too
     many contradicting viewpoints.  These contradictions have a
     paralyzing effect on the directors who all feel strongly their
     responsibilities to both sides.  Contributing to this paralysis
     is the fact that only a small percentage of all FidoNet sysops
     have actually joined IFNA.  By withholding their direct support,
     these sysops send a message to the directors that they do not
     support whatever it is that IFNA may be attempting to do.  The
     result is that IFNA directors find it difficult to feel a mandate
     to make any major moves.

     However it isn't even that simple; even within the membership of
     IFNA, there are factions who feel strongly that IFNA is the
     official head of FidoNet, while others feel just as strongly that
     it should be more of a stand-alone service organization.  IFNA at
     least has mechanisms whereby it can poll its membership to see
     what the majority want and to work toward that.  But this still
     isn't good enough because there is no existing mechanism in place
     whereby the majority will of FidoNet as a whole may be easily
     determined.  What usually serves as the will of FidoNet tends to
     be just the expression of a few individual voices.

     There are several very real problems subject to this dichotomy
     that is IFNA at present.  What is IFNA to be?  A service-only
     organization, or the last word in FidoNet administration?

     It is because IFNA has tried to be both, that so little progress
     FidoNews 5-50                Page 11                  12 Dec 1988


     has been made.  Imagine a train trying to head in both directions
     at once and then judge how much progress it can be expected to
     achieve.  This dual-identity is the major problem that has
     created so much ill-feeling between IFNA and sysops in the past
     and that has resulted in so little positive results.

     There have been quite a few problems identified besides this main
     one of IFNA's primary direction.  Should all members of FidoNet
     automatically be members of IFNA?  Is it right that sysops have
     to "purchase" their right to vote on FidoNet issues by joining
     IFNA?  Is IFNA responsible to just traditional FidoNet or does it
     also have a responsibility towards OtherNets?  What is to be done
     when there is a problem with the IC?  What are the rights of our
     Users?  What if the *C structure does not appear to be providing
     sufficient levels of complaint resolution and protection of
     individual rights?  How can we reconcile the existence of so many
     commercial nodes in a supposedly amateur network?  What if IFNA
     did not exist at all - how would sysops expect to have any
     democratic voice in the governing of FidoNet?  In fact, how can
     they have any even with IFNA, if there are no formally accepted
     means for their wishes to be communicated from IFNA to the *C
     structure?

     When IFNA was formed, there only was one net, FidoNet, which
     primarily existed in North America (yes, there were some nodes
     overseas, but they were hardly the force that should be reckoned
     with today).  As a result, it made sense for there to be an
     organization that allowed for pooling and sharing of resources,
     provided corporate protection and U.S. tax shelters for these
     resources, and which also gave all sysops an opportunity to
     particpate in FidoNet operation and administration through
     democratic processes.

     Fortunately or unfortunately, times have changed.  The network
     has expanded considerably and matured in many areas.  We now have
     multiple Nets participating under an overall FidoNet protocol.
     FidoNet has grown considerably overseas and operations there, due
     to differences in their political and technical environments,
     require somewhat different solutions than what may be ideal here
     in North America.  IFNA has finally been authorized by the IRS to
     proceed as a 501c3 charitable organization, which presents a
     great many new concerns in terms of opportunities as well as
     limitations.

     How then do we find a soution that will address all these
     problems and questions?

     I'm not sure that there is any ideal solution that provides ALL
     the answers to every need.  The right path has to be one that
     follows a line of mutually acceptable compromise through a wide
     range of variables.  We are, for the most part, traveling in
     uncharted territories; it is likely that what may even appear
     right for the majority today may prove to need adjustment
     tomorrow.

     The following then is a plan that is not espoused to be perfect;
     FidoNews 5-50                Page 12                  12 Dec 1988


     it is assumed that there are details that will need to be changed
     as we look deeper into specific areas and as we attempt to
     implement particular aspects.  No doubt it will NOT be every
     thing that you expect IFNA/FidoNet/OtherNets to be or have.  But
     when you consider its points, please do so in light of the
     following questions?  Does it offer opportunities for us to
     progress in the general manner we ALL want?  Is it better to
     follow this path than to stay where we are now?


     The Plan

     To best understand how this should be approached, let's first
     look at the IFNA Articles of Association:

       "IV. The purposes for which our corporation is formed are the
            following:

            A) the promotion of interest in telecommunications and
               experimentation;
            B) the establishment of telecommunication networks to
               provide publicly accessable and publicly available
               electronic communications;
            C) the furtherance of the public welfare;
            D) the advancement of telecommunications art the
               fostering of education in the field of electronic
               communication;
            E) the promotion and conduct of research and development
               to further the development of electronic communication;
            F) the dissemination of technical, educational, and
               scientific information relating to electronic
               communication;
            G) the printing and publishing of documents, books,
               magazines, newspapers and pamphlets necessary or
               incidental to any of the above purposes..."

     No where in the above is IFNA encouraged to operate or even
     administrate any individual network.  Lets look into the IFNA
     Bylaws:

       "IFNA NETWORK: The current set of systems which have been
       certified as FidoNet compatible and conform to policies
       established by the Board of Directors."

       "29. The Vice President - Technical Coordinator shall:
            a) be responsible for maintenance and distribution of the
               master NODELIST;
            b) creation and distribution of the weekly update file
               for the master NODELIST;
            c) ensuring the smooth operation of the IFNA NETWORK as
               prescribed by the Board of Directors; ..."

     These are the only statements in the Bylaws that really have any
     bearing on what IFNA might be required to do relative to FidoNet.

     Notice that they speak of the "IFNA NETWORK".  Once it was very
     FidoNews 5-50                Page 13                  12 Dec 1988


     easy to assume that that was "FidoNet" but is that still the
     case?  Doesn't "IFNA NETWORK" include AlterNet, EggNet or
     AnyOtherNet running FidoNet protocol, assuming that both sides
     wish that to be the case?  The Articles call for IFNA's
     "establishment of telecommunication network*S*..." [emphasis
     added]; it seems clear that it is part of IFNA's mission to
     assist in the establishment and promotion of such OtherNets.

     One other document comes into play here.  It is the contract that
     was signed by Tom Jennings and IFNA:

       "...To ensure the orderly growth of the publically available
       and accessible electronic Bulletin Board Network Systems, which
       have come to be known by TJ's "FidoNet" Trademark, utilizing
       the products and services of TJ, as well as to assist in the
       maintenance of the standards governing membership in "FidoNet",
       TJ delegated, first to specific individuals and now solely to
       IFNA, specific responsibilities, namely: to maintain, publish
       and distribute the weekly updated listing of authorized
       Bulletin Board Systems, hereafter "FidoNet Nodelist"; to assist
       with the maintenance and expansion of the standards for the
       products and services authorized to be associated with TJ's
       marks; ... and to assist with the controlling and policing of
       TJ's marks..."

     This contract also predated the appearance of multiple networks
     utilizing the FidoNet protocol.  But from the document, it can be
     seen that the intent was for IFNA to represent TJ's interests in
     terms of all "publically... accessible...Network Systems, which
     have come to be known by..."FidoNet"...". [It is probably
     appropriate to state here that TJ is on record as stating that he
     wishes to modify the agreement to meet various needs that have
     evolved.] I know from discussions with Tom that he encourages the
     concept of individual nets pursuing their own ideas of
     innovation, while being able to maintain a common basis for
     inter-communication.

     Now, it should be clear from the documents above, that IFNA's
     EXPLICIT requirement in terms of administration of any particular
     network (with the exception of the phrase "ensuring the smooth
     operation of the IFNA NETWORK") ends with that of producing a
     master nodelist.  However, in the past, a wide range of
     additional tasks have been inferred, based on this one stated
     requirement and the traditional tasks related to it.  As for the
     phrase, "ensuring the smooth operation of the IFNA NETWORK" this
     plan assumes that that has to refer to the complete,
     FidoNet-based inter-network, as opposed to any individual pieces
     per se.

     This plan calls for IFNA to do EXACTLY that which it's
     controlling documents call for it to do, but no more, in a direct
     sense, relative to administration of any one net.  Indeed, there
     is a very strong likelihood that should IFNA continue to maintain
     any attempts to further a special relationship with traditional
     FidoNet, it would put two major elements into jeopardy:

     FidoNews 5-50                Page 14                  12 Dec 1988


       o  IFNA's Position as FidoNet Protocol Protector for All - In
          order to assure that IFNA maintains its responsibility for
          the overall "IFNA NETWORK", it must do so equitably for all
          comers.

       o  IFNA's 501c3 Status - In order to maintain its right to this
          privilege, IFNA must ensure that its actions match those
          purposes called for in the Articles of Association which it
          submitted to gain this right.

     So, if IFNA is not going to attempt to respond, again in a direct
     sense, to calls for it to provide democratic and improved
     jurisprudence and other administrative processes WITHIN
     traditional FidoNet, who is going to fill this need?  The answer
     must be that either the basic existing *C structure be expanded
     to better address these requirements, or that an additional
     organization be formed that will address them.

     Either of these approaches could provide the necessary base for
     such action and it is not a matter for IFNA to directly declare
     which should be chosen nor how it should be implemented.  There
     are certain advantages to both:

       o  Expanding the *C structure is the easiest and quickest way
          to progress.  There already is the existing operational
          structure; it just needs to provide mechanisms whereby the
          voices of ALL sysops within FidoNet may be better heard and
          satisfied.  In the past, the *Cs have maintained that it is
          far better to work from a basis whereby *Cs are APPOINTED
          instead of elected by democratic process.  There has always
          been a very good reason for this approach: the technical
          aspects of getting the mail through have outweighed all
          others.  However, this is one area in which the network has
          certainly matured.  There are now many competent sysops who
          can assure that the requirements of this function are met;
          and, there are now more and more important issues of
          administration that need to be dealt with for which the
          input of the constituent sysops is required.

       o  Forming a new organization (or more than one) also makes
          sense when considered in various lights.  Establishing
          present Zone 1 FidoNet as a TRUE hobbyist network, instead
          of one that just plays lip service to this ideal, could
          result in the split-off of those nodes that are commercially
          oriented into their own Net.  We have already seen the
          formation of several special interest networks; it is only
          likely that this will continue and we should not only
          provide for this, but also encourage it (instead of the
          impossible attempt to make FidoNet all things to all
          people).

     In fact, there is no reason why both of the above approaches
     could not be undertaken; maintain the existing *C structure in
     traditional FidoNet, while centering it on hobbyist activity
     only.  Concurrently, encourage the establishment of additional
     networks that address other needs.
     FidoNews 5-50                Page 15                  12 Dec 1988


     The key to this approach, of course, is that communication links
     be established and maintained between all these networks.
     Without a doubt, that is a primary thrust of IFNA's Articles of
     Association and a basis for its 501c3 position.  IFNA needs to
     concentrate on these matters instead of being dragged down into
     intra-FidoNet operational squabbles.

     Once there is a division of responsibility between IFNA, which is
     limited to general policy-making, umbrella financial, tax, and
     representational support, and inter-net connections, and FidoNet
     (and all OtherNets), which are responsible for all of their own
     internal needs, quite a few of our persistent problems go away:

       o  Service vs.  Operate? - These arguments become moot when
          clear lines of responsibility are established.

       o  Who should join IFNA? - Under this approach there is no
          reason for anyone to "HAVE" to join IFNA; it becomes an
          all-volunteer organization as it should be to meet
          requirements of it's 501c3 charter.

       o  No one has to "buy" their vote - As all sysops, by virtue of
          their appearance in its Nodelist, would automatically be
          members of the new FidoNet organization their vote on
          operational issues would be assured.

       o  "Freeloaders" could not control of other's donations -
          Because those who have demanded a right to vote on Net
          operational concerns would have that outside of IFNA there
          is no question of them voting on and controlling the
          disposition of funds and resources which they have not
          contributed.

       o  Differences in intra-Zone operational requirements may be
          better resolved by the Zones themselves.  Europe seems on
          the way to establishing its own FidoNet Association.  There
          is no reason why it should not be self-governing, although
          it will be in everyone's best interests for Zone 2 FidoNet
          to enter into agreement with IFNA to maintain various
          universal standards of operation.

       o  IFNA won't appear to be shoved down any Net's throat - With
          sufficient operating distance established between IFNA and
          the individual Nets there is room for both sides to maneuver
          - and for the Nets and IFNA to approach each other out of
          mutual desire to effect standards of operation and to share
          in the promotion of FidoNet.

       o  Policy vs.  Procedure - Under such an approach, IFNA becomes
          clearly responsible for establishing high-level policies
          that are then endorsed by the *C structure and the general
          sysop body.  The *Cs retain responsibility for implementing
          these policies through various procedures and for adding
          detail necessary to address requirements at the various
          levels within the heirarchy.

     Problems

     Naturally, there are a few hurdles before such a plan can come to
     full fruition.  The Bylaws of IFNA will need quite a few changes.
     Some of these changes are already on the ballot that IFNA members
     should be casting by the middle of January.  Of particular note
     are Docket items NEW-02 and NEW-03 which, respectively, establish
     a procedure whereby IFNA is to interact with Network Operational
     Entities, and provide for the establishment of a Grievance
     Procedure that has jurisdiction internally to IFNA and between
     IFNA and such Nets as choose to subscribe to it.  You should vote
     YEA on these two issues to get a start on this plan.  (Note that
     this plan presently negates the need for docket numbers DEF.01,
     DEF.02, DEF.04, 24.06, 24.07, and 29.  It is recommended that you
     vote NAY on these proposals).

     The question of the make-up of the IFNA Board of Directors is one
     which may likely have to be revised.  It is possible that IFNA
     Directors, in addition to being elected by IFNA members, may be
     augmented by representatives who serve from constituent Networks,
     according to such agreements as may be established between IFNA
     and those Nets.  The present scheme which divides North America
     into various regional segments may well be better suited for the
     operational organization of Zone1 FidoNet.  This point typifies
     the fact that details will have to be worked out as we progress.

     Provisions in the Bylaws and the contract with TJ will also have
     to be included to allow for the existence and support of multiple
     Networks and Nodelists.

     But the biggest problem remains the fact that FidoNet does not
     have an existing operational infrastructure that is formally
     responsible to the sysops of the net or that operates on
     universal administrative principles and procedures.  How do we
     get the *C structure (including EchoMail Coordinators) to
     integrate democratic processes into their operations?  Realize,
     that this is not a simple question.  Democracy needs to be in
     place to provide for expression of choice on various matters of
     policy and administration.  But certain operational aspects may
     always need to be reserved.  After all, in a hobbyist environment
     no one can actually be compelled to perform tasks designed to
     benefit others, particularly if they involve any expense.
     Really, beyond just the plain encouragement of peer pressure, the
     only power a hobbyist group may actually be able to invoke is
     that to enjoin.  And the nature of FidoNet makes even that power
     very tenuous in some areas.


     Who Must Do What?

     In order to get this plan rolling IFNA must do the following:

       o  Establish various necessary universal policies of
          administration and operation.  IFNA's Articles, Bylaws, and
          contract with TJ all call upon IFNA to be responsible for
          defining policy.  IFNA needs to take up this responsibility
     FidoNews 5-50                Page 17                  12 Dec 1988


          at the universal level, while leaving local details and
          aspects of procedure to the *C structure.

       o  Concentrate on establishing the technical requirements for
          inter-Network communications.

       o  Begin work on establishing the bases upon which all Nets may
          enter into formal agreements with IFNA.

       o  Get working on changing its Bylaws where necessary.

       o  Continue work on most of its other services such as
          standards, certification, and its own administration.

      The *C structure must:

       o  Concentrate on Procedure more than actual Policy.  Granted,
          the *C structure is responsible for detailed policy making
          at levels below the universal, but it should demand that
          IFNA provide them a satisfactory basis from which to work.

       o  Make allowances in its present methods of administration and
          operation for more direct responsiveness to sysops at all
          levels.

       o  Establish, or assist in causing to be established, formal
          procedures for such matters as voting, grievance resolution,
          and other operational concerns at all levels within their
          heirarchy.

       o  Broaden involvement in these and other aspects of Net
          administration.  Most *Cs have a great deal to do under the
          present conditions and it is often demonstrated that it is
          too much to expect of any volunteer.  By creating more
          positions and extending involvement to more sysops, we
          ensure a much broader base of expertise to step in and take
          over in times of need.

     Sysops must:

       o  Press and assist the *C structure in accomplishing the
          above.  In particular, if you wish to have your voice heard
          relative to Net matters, then make sure it is!
          (Constructively, of course!)  And insist that there be a
          more formal way for this to happen so we don't have to rely
          on the often torrid environment of EchoMail.

       o  If you wish to see IFNA do something for you, join it and
          pitch in through vocal encouragement, moral support, or
          direct action.

       o  Take responsibility for all the actions ascribed to the
          above.  We all know "Rome wasn't built in a day."  Each of
          us have our pet projects that we hope will be worked on and
          it is easy to become impatient when we see little progress.
          The key to progress here is to make sure that we've each put

          our own house in order to as great a degree possible; and
          then to help those who are responsible for what we feel we
          need, perhaps by just taking on some unrelated aspect of
          their burden to allow them the time to get to that what
          which we seek.

     With Sysops taking responsibility for this entire process, the
     *Cs increasing the franchise of all sysops at all heirarchial
     levels, and IFNA establishing the high-level political and
     technical inter- connections in a manner which is less intrusive
     than serving, there is a great chance that FidoNet can soon
     become a force far greater than it even is today.

        New Medical Echo: MEDLIT -- Medical Literature Discussions

     Richard Kaplan
     Medical Software Exchange
     FidoNet: 1:135/3
     Internet: medsoft.UUCP
     (305) 325-8709


     I am organizing a new echo (MEDLIT) which will include
     discussions of current papers in popular medical journals such as
     JAMA and NEJM.   I think electronic publishing ultimately could
     revolutionize the way medical information is disseminated by
     minimizing publication delays and providing for efficient
     discussion of controversial theories, including direct
     communication with authors.  Perhaps FidoNet can in some way
     contribute to this vision.

     Think of MEDLIT as an electronic letters-to-the-editor section of
     your favorite medical journal.  If the echo is of high enough
     quality and has enough participation, I would be willing to
     compile the messages periodically and submit them to the editors
     of the appropriate journals, similar to the publication of the
     "Best of Bix" in Byte magazine at one time.

     Let me know if you would like to link into this echo or if you
     have any suggestions about organizing it.  I am PC-PURSUITABLE,
     but if you do not use PC PURSUIT then I will try to link you in
     locally as the distribution list grows.
