     =================================================================

     Greeting,

     A very happy 1999 to you all!  One year to go and 2000 is upon us.

     And then?  Most of the PC's break down, because either it's not
     Y2K compliant or the software used will see to it's downfall.
     What a thought.  Yes, I agree and it's not a nice thought at all.
     Or is it? :-)

     A question was raised about the naming of FidoNews and I suggested
     we go as follows: FNEWnnnn.ZIP, this issue being FNEW1601.ZIP

     However, since I have not discussed this with those who rely on
     receiving FidoNews and their system automattically processing it,
     such as fidonews.org, it might not be in the interest to change it
     as suggested above, but rather carry on with the naming as used.

     Happy reading,

     North American Backbone Echo Changes [Nov-Dec]
     by Lisa Gronke, 1:105/9
     lisa@psg.com

     Summary of backbone echo changes during Nov & Dec.

     Brought to you courtesy of (unix) diff.

     As noted last month, the North American Backbone changed the format
     of its areafix compatible lists. Backbone.na now lists all NAB
     backbone echos. The backbone.no list no longer exists. Echos that
     are in jeopardy because of low traffic or an expired Elist entry are
     listed in Section 3 of the weekly backstat.na.

     When Thom LaCosta took over the Elist function last summer, he merged
     all unrefreshed entries from Adrian's Elist, using the merge date as
     the refresh date in his database. The result was to give unaware
     moderators an extra five months 'til expiry. Effectively no echos
     have been placed in jeopardy for lack of an Elist entry since
     June '98. These echos are expiring now, and I expect a large number
     of unrefreshed echos to be dropped from the January EList and added
     to Section 3 of backstat.na. I _think_ those echos will be removed
     from backbone.na after three months if they remain un-Elisted, but
     only time will tell for sure.

     The North American Backbone also made it harder to get into, and
     easier to get out of, jeopardy for Low traffic. I am told that Low
     traffic echos will not be removed from backbone.na, so Low traffic
     jeopardy doesn't mean much.

     The net result is that the number of backbone echos is growing,
     although the number of backbone messages continues to shrink.

     FTSC Nominations
     by Goran Eriksson, 2:201/505, get@get.pp.se

     When working with the preparations for the FTSC elections just
     concluded, it struck me how foreign the nomination process prescribed
     by FTA-1001 is to me.

     In my neck of the woods, the normal thing would be for candidates in
     FTSC elections to nominate themselves and present themselves and their
     merits. The electorate would be trusted to make a sound choice between
     the candidates based on that information and on other information
     available to each member of the electorate.

     Certainly, formal nomination procedures like those prescribed by
     FTA-1001 are sometimes used also around here.

     In other cases, the nomination procedure may formally be open, but you
     don't stand any real chance if you're not recommended by the appointed
     nomination committee.

     In an organization like the FTSC as well as the FidoNet as a whole,
     the norm would however be that anyone may nominate anyone. Even
     her-/himself. Seconded nominations may occur but are not required.


     I therefore suggest that FTA-1001 is changed accordingly.
     FIDONEWS 16-01               Page 5                    4 Jan 1999


     You're invited to take part in the discussion about this suggestion in
     the FTSC_PUBLIC echomail conference. That's where the FTSC has to seek
     consensus for changes like these.

                         Searching but not finding

                       It's not a game to many of us


          I am writing this article in hopes it will generate some
     thought and be distributed to folks who can make a difference in the
     future of the net and search technologies.  If you are such a person,
     sit back and relax, I'd like to converse with you about this for a few
     moments in a totally nonthreatening way.  you might even be glad I
     did.

          LEt's take your typical day, and mine.  WE've gotta get the
     FIDONEWS 16-01               Page 7                    4 Jan 1999


     kids off to school, during our work day we've got to research for
     upcoming projects and network with coworkers to do our daily tasks.
     Yes, we've also got to do lots of research, whether it's on which
     model of furnace to get for the house or is this a safe toy for
     Junior.  The internet was gonna make this easier for us, right?

          At this point you're uttering the great words of modern search
     technology, such as yahoo, excite and so on.  WEll, all that's fine
     but we're missing the boat.

     During one of those average days you want to order a piece of
     equipment you need.  YOu want to make that call when you're not on
     your boss's dime which limits your available time to do this.  So,
     you're going to do some research.  Ah yes, the supplier has a web
     site, and somewhere on that web site is a price list for products
     they sell, and another of used merchandise they have in stock.
     WEll, no big deal, right?  We're gonna go there and grab those two
     lists which are common garden variety zip files, download 'em,
     unzip 'em and either print 'em out or read them.

          Not so fast!  well, we get there, but we can't quite remember
     under which link we found it before.  LEt's wander around for
     awhile.  Hmmm, here's a neat one, a midi file downloads and plays
     while a dancing bear tells you about something you really don't
     want.  THe text scrolls across the screen so fast you couldn't read
     it if you tried, but let's back up, our link didn't seem to be
     there.  Let's try another.  Still not there.  Where's that darned
     file?  A coworker reminds you that you're going to be late for your
     lunch appointment with the prospective client if you don't get a
     move on, so you log off and grab your coat.  AH well, maybe later
     this afternoon.  Oops, can't get outside on the net now, can't
     connect, whatevver.  NO luck.

          We had it but we lost it!  Remember when the internet was a
     collection of machines in the halls of academia, technology
     companies and the military?  My first contacts with the internet
     were in the later years of this period, through something called
     fidonet.  It was a gateway connection, no binary files could be
     transferred, but a guy could get a lot of work done.

          Under the strategies employed in those halcyon days of the
     net, I might get the price lists in the above example via ftp.
     REmember Ftp?  Simple to use, allowed anonymous log-ins, didn't
     care if your browser doesn't have the latest plug-ins.  IT worked
     for everybody, worked well too.  I might ftp the file, or I might
     use a doccument or database search tool such as wais to narrow down
     my search to items I knew I wanted.  I can have a price quote of
     those items via email using something akin to wais.  I send out my
     email, meanwhile go have my lunch with my coworker and the
     prospect, come back and get other work done.  When checking my
     email later my request has  made it through the queue, I find.  The
     results of my search are now sitting in my email in-box for my
     perusal.  No muss, no fuss, no strain, but the gain I sought when
     I was playing with my browser like I was channel surfing between
     football games.  I don't  want to channel surf I want to get what
     I want and leave.  If I'm in the mood for browsing, the web or my
     FIDONEWS 16-01               Page 8                    4 Jan 1999


     public library both work fine, but if I really want to find it, my
     public library has the edge.  It can accomodate me there too with the
     Dewey Decimal system and knowledgeable librarians.


          Yes, I lament the loss of some of the old standard
          internet search tools, Archie and wais to
     name but two.  Consider the FIdonet gateway I spoke of earlier.
     SEarch tools such as those I mention could be used from gateway
     connections to the net such as Fidonet.  Not so with the newer
     breed of search engine and information retrieval which is the www.
     Here's another example of the search from hell.  This one was
     saved, though, by a knowledgeable librarian who figured out
     four11.com just wasn't getting us where we wanted to go.  Yes, the
     web has opened up the internet to the masses, and there
     are many web search tools to choose from which offer the same
     functionality.  Or do they?

          Sometimes using modern search strategies you just can't get
     there from here.  A few months ago, I wanted to look up an alleged
     bail bondsman from the Kansas City Missouri area.  He had contacted
     me looking for one of my daughters as she'd helped out a boyfriend
     once.  I had a phone number and wanted to cross reference it with
     listed bail bonding agencies in the area, so off to my local
     library I went hoping to browse their cdrom telephone directory.
     AS I'm a blind person, I scheduled time with my reader to accomplish
     this. Much to my surprise, the Library's telephone directories
     cd had disappeared in favor of an internet workstation.
     (Great!  another one for patrons to use.)  But now, on with our
     search.

     The librarian  punches up four11.com for my reader.  WE try to find
     a way to just browse listings for the area, but it wants to know if
     we want to buy a computer, we want to find people or whatever.  WE
     enter "Bail Bond" as a string but it burps on that.  SO much for
     four11.com or similar strategies.  WHat a joke!
     After wasting twenty minutes we're still not finished and we have
     other things to do with our afternoon.

     An emailable wais server, on the other hand would have given us
     just what we need.  With a hardcopy telephone directory or Boolean
     logic and the old text search engines we would have been able to
     retrieve our information and be on our way.  one can narrow one's
     search terms and get the
     information sought.  In the phone directory search example, the
     librarian finally figured out we couldn't get there from here and
     offered us a hardcopy Kansas City area phone directory.  Within its
     pages was what we sought, and we verified the legitimacy of the
     individual and moved on  It took us exactly three minutes from the
     time the physical phone directory was placed at our disposal.  .


     SO now I'm to the place where I'm going to ask you to do something.
     If you're an average net citizen like me, demand that search
     engine providers provide an offline search capability.
     which usually would mean an emailable interface.  Offline
     FIDONEWS 16-01               Page 9                    4 Jan 1999


     searching saves you time.  It also saves other
     net citizens trouble.  Sure, your request is queued up behind those
     who got there before you, but you're using less resources to
     accomplish the job than you would online browsing complex web
     pages.    You don't get the seeming instant gratification you get
     from a web search, but how many times did you really need the
     information you sought right now?  While you were clicking away to
     get your search started, wouldn't you rather have sent your request
     out over the net and gone to have a cup of coffee or a snack?
     Maybe you would have had time to help Junior with that math
     problem.

          If you're a system administrator or operator in a network such
     as Fidonet, demand such services be placed at your disposal by the
     companies with whom you do business as an alternative to all the
     glitz.
     .  Your users can benefit from
     them as can you yourself.  Value added is a big buzzword today, and
     for the bbs operator hobbyist, it isn't gratifying without callers.
     Callers will call when they feel they derive a benefit, and these
     tools are definitely a benefit when they're understood.  A little
     education makes them quite understandable.  Try it, your users will
     like it!  Just tell 'em a little bit about how to use it.  They'll
     do the rest.
     I know, I was such a bbs operator for awhile.   The internet
     hadn't yet come to town, and users were using the mail gateway and a
     few search tools I made them aware of.
     They were quite happy to find they could do this with their
     older hardware and software, especially since full net access
     had yet to come to my community.

     If you're someone in a position to choose what software options
     will be available for users of search technologies, consider these
     simple options from the earlier days of the net.  They use less
     resources but are just as useful.  For your
     users who are intimidated, explain to them how these systems work.
     YOu'll find converts aplenty when they realize how much faster it
     really is for them.
     Platform dependency isn't an issue with these search engine
     strategies either.  The old apple II, the commodore models,
     anything that can use email and a terminal program can access them
     if it has a net connection somehow.  SOme still use
     email services through gateways from bbs networks and the like.
     FOr  those folks and the developing nations' citizens such
     strategies give them full access to the resources that make the
     internet what it is.


     FInally, thanks for taking the time to read this.  YOu are free to
     distribute it to any interested party or appropriate usenet forum
