     A Final Word on IFNA Voting

                     520/583@AlterNet

     Well, it all comes down to this.

     Six months ago, I was tired of hearing/reading about the abuses
     of some misguided *C's.  While the great majority of them were
     good folks, we had no guarantees that the nodes would have their
     say under Policy 4.  That's when I had the idea of instilling
     democracy through the legitimacy of IFNA.  I campaigned for
     director seats, went to FidoCon, and forced the issue.  What we
     came out with was a network wide election to determine the
     legitimacy of IFNA.

     Quite simply, if this vote fails, if less than 50% of the
     network votes FOR IFNA, I don't believe we'll see democracy in
     FidoNet at all.  All other major proposals to replace Policy 4
     are based on a vote of the *C structure, not on a vote of the
     nodes like the IFNA vote.  That means that any new policies will
     be decided by the people that're going to lose their guaranteed
     positions under any new policies.  This vote decides policies by
     YOUR vote.  But if it fails, the sysops have only themselves to
     blame.  IFNA will dissolve and FidoNet will be back at Policy 4,
     with the *C's holding all the cards again.  Frankly, I'm
     satisfied that we had the election.  In my opinion, no one will
     be able to say that FidoNet "never had" a chance at democracy
     again.

     If you haven't voted yet, I urge you to read thru the draft
     policy and bylaws published in this issue (if all goes well...).
     The new IFNA calls for network wide votes for the Board of
     Directors.  It guarantees seats on the board for zones outside
     the US, and gives a minimum of 2 seats out of 8 to SOMEONE other
     than the north americans.  It gives any zone a maximum of three
     seats, so that the masses may also be represented.  It calls for
     election of *C members all the way up to the ZC, and since YOU
     elect the BoD, you in essence elect the IC, as well.

     Most importantly, the draft policy eliminates the "excessively
     annoying" clause that's been such a thorn in the side of FidoNet
     for so many years.  Non-technical policy complaints would be a
     thing of the past.  If you can send/receive mail during ZMH, and
     don't interfere with the technical operations of others, you're
     in.  And if you're in the nodelist, you're a full voting member
     of IFNA.

     Some people have said that this was all a "power grab", that we
     intend to dictate to FidoNet what it can/cannot do.  To them I
     ask, if that were so, why are we holding a network wide
     election, something Policy 4 and the *C's never did?  Why is the
     entire BoD going to be reseated by next FidoCon?  Why are we
     giving the sysops of FidoNet a chance to vote on accepting or
     rejecting the proposed policy and bylaws.  Some might think that
     those types are interested in maintaining the power of the *C's,
     but thats for others to decide.

     As for the *C's let me say one thing.  I've had my doubts about
     some of them in the past, but most have conducted this election
     in the spirit in which it was intended.  Only one case of
     'election rigging' has reached the election committee, and the
     NC who violated that trust we spoke so much about in September
     is no longer in FidoNet.  I think that speaks a lot about the
     *C's in general, that they are willing to police themselves when
     necessary.  I would like to thank the *C structure and Matt
     Whelan and Steve Bonine especially, for carrying out this
     election.  Unless there's massive reports of voter fraud at the
     last minute, I feel they've done a great job.

     As a last word, I would just ask that if you haven't voted yet,
     that you please do so.  It would be nice if we could show the
     world that when it counts, sysops are NOT apathetic.  This
     election could become a shining example of what people can do
     when they put their minds to it.

     Let's tear down that "Berlin Wall".  Let's have a democratic
     IFNA.

     Thank you for your time.

                           HST (DS) Setup Notes
                          ----------------------

                             November 12, 1989


     This note describes how to set up the U S Robotics Courier HST
     (14.4K bps), or HST Dual Standard, modem and various IBM-type PC
     communications programs and FOSSILs, including:

             BinkleyTerm 2.30
             BNU 1.70
             DSZ 10/24/89
             Opus 1.03b
             OpusComm 5.31
             ProComm Plus 1.1b
             QModem 4.1b
             X00 1.20c

     The first section has some miscellaneous information about
     running a high speed modem.  The next section covers the setup
     for the HST itself.  The remaining sections cover the various
     communications programs and FOSSILs.

     If you have any questions, suggestions, or setup information for
     other programs, please contact us on the New Orleans Tech BBS,
     FidoNet 1:396/1, 504-885-5928.  On this board you will also find
     a current version of this file under the name HST_SET.ZIP.


     ================================================================


                    General Notes on High Speed Modems
                   ------------------------------------


     The RS-232C cable connecting the modem to the computer's serial
     port should have at least the following pins connected:  1, 2,
     3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 20.  Get an Ohm Meter, Multimeter, or
     other form of continuity tester and check your cable.  Some
     connectors have pins which are looped back, and are not
     connected to the connector at the other end of the cable.

     To get the "most" out of your HST you will have to set the
     computer-to-modem speed higher than the modem-to-modem speed.
     This is called "locking" the serial port, since it won't be
     operating at the same speed as the modem itself is.  Why is this
     necessary?

     FidoNews 6-47                Page 4                   20 Nov 1989


     For a few reasons:  Most computer serial ports don't operate at
     14400 bps, the basic speed of the HST.  Thus the computer has to
     operate at a higher speed.  Because of this, however, the
     computer and the modem have to be able to "handshake" to prevent
     overrun, and loss of data.  Hardware handshaking, using the RTS
     and CTS lines (in the cable mentioned above) does the job.
     Avoid software handshaking, as it is protocol sensitive.

     Another reason is that the HST does not need to send the start
     and stops bit which make up part of the the asynchronous data
     from/to the computer.  This means that for every 10 bits of
     computer-to-modem data, there is only 8 bits of modem-to-modem
     data.

     Given that each of these represents one character, the cps
     (characters per second) rating of both links is the same.  When
     talking about bps (bits per second) however, this means that the
     computer-to-modem link needs to be 25% faster to keep up with
     the modem-to-modem link, even though both are at the same cps
     rate!

     Now you can see how it is possible to get more that 100%
     throughput with an HST.  Now let's talk about data compression.
     This adds about 5% overhead to the data you are sending.  So, if
     the data is already compressed, with PKZip for example, then you
     will probably just end up losing the 5%.  If you are sending
     ASCII text however, the HST's compression will buy you about
     50-100% improvement.

     The HST allows you to set up compression in one of 3 ways:
     Always on, always off, and do what the other end wants.  In
     general, the calling modem should be set to match the type of
     transfers it expects to be doing.  The answering modem should
     allow the caller to choose whether he wants compression or not.

     Transfers using compression, at 14400 bps, should generally lock
     the serial port at 38400 bps.  19200 bps probably won't be fast
     enough to allow the modem to run at full speed, depending on the
     type of file being compressed.

     In general, unless you expect to be doing lots of transfers
     using compression, it is our opinion that locking the serial
     port at 19200 bps is a better way to go.  It is less demanding
     of the computer, thus reducing the changes of losing data in
     marginal cases.  For transferring previously compressed data,
     where the modem is not doing the compression, 19200 bps will
     suffice, as the maximum rate you will be able to achieve will
     approximately 1650 cps, or 16500 bps on the computer-to-modem
     link.  [Note:  1650 cps is 14400 bps, plus 25% due to start/stop
     bit stripping, minus about 8% for modem-to-modem overhead.]

     FidoNews 6-47                Page 5                   20 Nov 1989


     For the rest of this note we will assume that you want to lock
     the serial port at 19200 bps.  If you want to lock at 38400 bps
     instead, just change the "19200"s to "38400"s.

     Some communications programs and most FOSSILs allow you to
     specify the size of the receive and/or transmit buffers.  The
     best size will depend on many factors, and may require a bit of
     testing on your part.  For starters however, we recommend that
     you make the transmit buffer 1K and the receiver buffer 2K.  If
     you are running under a multi-tasking operating system then you
     might want to start with both set to 4K.

     One thing that you will notice when running a high speed modem
     is that all file protocols are not created equal!  Protocols
     which require an "Ack" for every block sent do not perform well.
     Thus you will want to avoid XModem, for example.  YModem does
     better because it uses a larger block size.

     Streaming protocols, such as ZModem, work fine.  However, avoid
     protocols like YModem-G, which use error detection, but no error
     recovery, simply aborting the transfer upon an error.  Although
     the modem-to-modem transfer is guaranteed by a 16 bit CRC used
     by the modems themselves, errors can still occur between the
     computer and the modem at either end.  In some situations it is
     not uncommon to lose an occasional character (see below).  It is
     not worth this chance for a less than 1% speed advantage.

     We highly recommend replacing the serial interface chip (UART),
     a 8250 or 16450, with a 16550a.  This chip contains a 16
     character FIFO, as opposed to a double buffer.  If your
     communications program makes use of the FIFO, it will allow you
     longer interrupt latency and/or less interrupt overhead.

     Various manufacturers make versions of the 16550a.  National
     Semiconductor was the first.  Their full part number for the
     40-pin DIP is NS16550AN.

     In all the cases that follow we recommend installing a 16550a.
     In some of the cases alternatives are also presented.

     Some computers (particularly 4.77 MHz, 8088 machines) are not
     fast enough to support 19200 or 38400 bps.  If you have this
     type of computer, you can use 9600 bps instead, but this will
     not give you the HST's full speed.

     Certain disk controllers, with 1:1 track buffers, can cause
     problems.  Perstor disk controllers can also cause problems.  We
     understand that Perstor has a BIOS upgrade which helps.

     If you are running a program that makes heavy use of extended
     memory, like a RAM Disk or a Cache, you may lose characters.
     This is mainly a problem on 286 machines.  With some programs,
     like VDisk, reducing the sector size and/or the number of
     sectors transferred at a time will help.

     FidoNews 6-47                Page 6                   20 Nov 1989


     Certain TSRs interfere with communications programs.  If you
     find that you are having trouble, one thing that you should try
     is to reboot with only the bare essentials in your Config.Sys
     and AutoExec.Bat.  If this makes a difference, then you get to
     play detective.

     If you are running DesqView with EEMS or EMS 4.0 memory which
     only has only 1 (or no) alternate map register then you should
     run the communications program in window #1.  Newer AST memory
     boards have multiple registers.  On 386s, using QEMM, you can
     specify how many registers to provide (default is 8).

     Under OS/2, running a communications program in the DOS
     compatibility box at 9600 bps or above, you will probably lose
     characters, unless you have a 16550a and a program that makes
     use of it.  All of the communications programs and FOSSILs
     described in this note will work fine except for ProComm Plus.
     Or, you could always get a communications program written for
     OS/2.

     At the end of this note there is a list of some distributors who
     sell the 16550a.

                  Setup for U S Robotics Courier HST (DS)
                 -----------------------------------------


     First, check to make sure that you have current ROMs.  Use the
     I7 command.  Compare the version and release dates with these:

         Supervisor date   08/25/89 or 09/29/89
         Supervisor rev      1.1    or   1.2

         IOP date          12/19/88 or 05/17/89 / 08/08/89 / 09/20/89
         IOP rev             1.0    or   1.0    /   1.1    /   1.2

         DSP date          09/18/89
         DSP rev              2

     If any of your ROMs are older, call USR's tech support at
     1-800-982-5151 and get current versions.  USR claims that both
     versions of the Supervisor, and all four versions of the IOP are
     functionally equivalent.  If you find that you are having
     problems connecting with "low cost" 2400 bps modems, make sure
     that you have the current ROMs, especially the DSP!

     Also, if you have an old manual, be sure to get the April 1989
     Addendum.  The DIP switch setting supplement is not very
     accurate, however.

     FidoNews 6-47                Page 7                   20 Nov 1989


     Check the DIP Switches at the rear of the HST.  Please note that
     USR has changed the factory default settings, so check them all:

         1 - Up      [Necessary - Data Terminal Ready follows pin 20]
         2 - Up      [Probably - Most programs use the verbal codes]
         3 - Down    [Probably - Enables result codes]
         4 - Up      [Your choice - Local Echo, confuses some prog's]
         5 - Down    [Probably - Auto Answer disabled]
         6 - Up      [Necessary - Carrier Detect follows signal]
         7 - Up      [Probably - Both originate and answer results]
         8 - Down    [Necessary - Enables command mode]
         9 - Down    [Probably - Escape code maintains connection]
        10 - Up      [Necessary - Power up to NRAM settings]
        11 - Up      [Probably - Normal, see manual]

     Note:  We consider it bad form for a communications program to
     expect the modem to auto-answer the phone.  This allows a modem
     to continue answering the phone after the program has crashed.
     Certainly, any program which demands this anyway should make it
     part of its modem init string, and not expect the modem to
     power-up in that mode.

     The following assumes a locked line rate between the computer
     and the modem.  Also, the settings favor dialing out and
     transferring previously compressed data, because this is the
     most common case and because a BBS can take care of any
     differences in its modem init string.

     Start by setting your communications program to 19200 bps, N81
     (no parity, 8 bits per character, 1 stop bit).  Reset the HST to
     factory defaults (&F command), then change the following:

     John Roberts
     FidoNet 1:385/49

     We've had some very good response to the IFNA Bylaws and
     IFNA/FidoNet Policy drafts so far, and I want to thank everyone
     who has contributed with their comments and observations so far.

     Once again with Vince's help, the current versions of both
     proposals should appear in this issue of FidoNews.  Changed
     paragraphs in both documents are annotated by a "|" character in
     the second column for clarity.

     If you'd like to request copies of the current version of these
     drafts, they're available as I_POLICY.ARC and I_BYLAWS.ARC from
     1:385/49 (XP/9600/HST/V32) and should also be available for
     request from 1:104/424 (XA/2400) and 1:107/583 (XP/9600/HST/V32)
     as well.

     Also, after the drafts you should find the general format for
     submission of proposed appendices.  This information may be
     requested from 1:385/49 as I_POLAPP.FMT.

     And finally, it's certainly not too late for changes.  We're all
     still listening!





     You may well notice that I said "the current version" above.
     That's because these are both Draft documents at this time, and
     while I feel they're pretty solid overall, it's quite likely that
     there will be further changes before the due date for the final
     proposals to be submitted for vote.

     The point is that they're not carved in stone, and it's
     absolutely not too late for you to be heard if there's something
     you feel strongly about.  As a matter of fact, I'd sincerely like
     to hear your opinions.  If you're not interested in establishing
     a link to the IFNA_POL conference, by all means send me netmail.
     While I can't promise a personal reply to each and every message
     that comes in, I will promise to make sure that your opinions go
     before the committee for consideration.

     The IFNA_POL conference itself is still active and available for
     your comments and discussion, and will remain so as long as
     necessary.  The primary EchoMail link for the conference is Fabian
     Gordon at 1:107/323, and it's available in GroupMail format from
     both myself at 1:385/49 and Phil Buonomo at 1:107/583.

     Getting back to the documents themselves, in particular the
     Policy document, you'll notice that a lot of things simply aren't
     covered.  This is the way it was designed.  We've put into the
     basic policy only the things that we feel are absolutely
     necessary to the operation of the network.  The idea is that you,
     the "grunt sysop" (hasn't anyone got a better term for that?),
     FidoNews 6-47                Page 10                  20 Nov 1989


     are the one who should make the decisions on the details of how
     you want your network to operate, and that you should have a vote
     on each and every item that affects your operation within the
     network.

     Thus the modular approach.  Details such as geographic
     boundaries, selection of coordinators, complaint and grievance
     procedures and other such things that have historically been such
     large points of contention will be added to the basic document as
     Appendices.  Each of these will be voted on separately to and
     independent of the basic policy and each other, and there may
     well be more than one choice for each major issue on the ballot
     along with "none of the above", which will also be a valid choice
     in this sort of election based on preference.

     I'm going to be presumptuous for a moment and ask you for two
     favors, even though I've never met or even corresponded with most
     of you before.  The first is related directly to the two
     documents I've been speechifying about, while the second is much
     more general.

     First, when reading these proposals, try not to read anything
     into them that isn't there.  Take them at face value - that's the
     way we've written them.  There's no "hidden agenda" or hidden
     anything else there, just an honest effort by a few people to put
     the control of FidoNet back into the hands of the sysops of
     FidoNet itself.

     Second, when you're given the opportunity to make your voice
     heard, whether by making comments and suggestions or by casting a
     vote in an election, take the few minutes needed to do so.  If
     you don't, then no one can know what your feelings and opinions
     are on whatever issues may be at hand.  I'm not talking just
     about FidoNet here, but about many of the other aspects of life
     as well.  Communication is a two-way process.  It's been said so
     often that it's rather cliche, but that hasn't made it any less
     true.

     Thanks!

      |      shall be known as At-Large directors.  No Zone may have
      |      more than 3 directors representing it on the Board.  The
      |      Directors shall be elected from the membership during the

             specified, at the time of its receipt by the president or
             secretary.  The acceptance of a resignation shall not be
             necessary to make it effective.

         Section 3. VACANCIES.

             If the office of any director, member of a committee or
             other officer becomes vacant, the remaining directors in

             appoint any qualified person to fill such vacancy, and to
             hold office for the unexpired term and until his
             successor shall be duly chosen.

         Section 4. REMOVAL.

             Any director or directors may be removed either for or
             without cause at any time by the affirmative vote of the
             members or holders of a majority of all the membership
             votes of those entitled to vote, at a special meeting of
             the members called for the purpose, and the vacancies
             thus created may be filled, at the meeting held for the
             purpose of removal, by the affirmative vote of the
             members or holders of a majority of all the membership
             votes of those entitled to vote.

         Section 5. INCREASE IN NUMBER.

             The number of directors may be increased by amendment of
             these Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
             directors, though less than a quorum, by the affirmative
             vote of the majority of the members, at the annual
             meeting or by a special meeting called for that purpose,
             and by like vote the additional directors may be chosen
             at such meeting to hold office until the next annual
             election and until their successors are elected and
             qualify.

         Section 6. COMPENSATION.

             Directors shall not receive any stated salary for their
             services as directors or as members of committees, but by
             resolution of the Board a fixed fee and expenses of
             attendance may be allowed for attendance at each meeting.
             Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude
             any director from serving the corporation in any other
             capacity as an officer, agent or otherwise, and receiving
             compensation therefore.

             meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee
             thereof, may be taken without a meeting, if prior to such
             action a written consent thereto is signed by all members
             of the Board, or of such committee as the case may be,
             and such written consent is filed with the minutes of

             shall execute bonds, mortgages, and other contracts in
             behalf of the corporation, and shall cause the seal to be

             such surety as the Board shall prescribe.

         Section 7. SECRETARY.

             integrity of the network and for publishing the list of
             nodes which bears the trademark of this corporation, and
             for establishing new zones in that nodelist at the

     John Roberts
     FidoNet 1:385/49

     The following information is provided for those who have
     expressed an interest in developing proposals for appendices to
     the IFNA/FidoNet Policy document.  It's a bit rough, but should
     be close enough to get you in the ballpark so that your proposals
     will conform to the same format as others under development.

     Each proposal should be generated in straight ASCII text, each
     line terminated with a carriage return/line feed sequence, and
     the file terminated with the ^Z end of file marker, left margin
     set to column 1 and the right margin set to column 65, normally
     spaced (right margin *not* justified).

     The proposal should begin with a blank line, followed by a
     centered title block in the same format as the following sample:

                      Appendix xxx (Proposed)(Draft)
                                   to
                           IFNA/FidoNet Policy

                             January 1, 1980

                        GENERAL SUBJECT OF APPENDIX
                        ===========================

     The "xxx" in the first line will be the proposal identifier.
     Either use "xxx" here or leave blank, as these sequence numbers
     will be assigned by the chairman or secretary of the Bylaws and
     Rules committee upon receipt of your proposal.  The word
     "(Proposed)" should always appear.  The word "(Draft)" should
     appear if your proposal is not in its final form and may be
     followed by a version number, i.e., "(Draft v1.03)" or similar.

     The date shown should be the date of submission of your proposal.

     The subject line should be very brief, yet descriptive enough to
     reflect the primary issue your proposal addresses, and be
     followed by one blank line.

     The remainder of the document should continue in standard outline
     format with four-space indentation as used in the basic Policy
     document:

     I. FIRST MAJOR HEADING/PARAGRAPH

         A. First degree subheading/paragraph

             1. Second degree subheading/subparagraph

     FidoNews 6-47                Page 21                  20 Nov 1989


                 a. Third degree subheading/subparagraph

                     i. Fourth degree subheading/subparagraph

     Each heading/paragraph and subheading/paragraph should be
     separated by a single blank line.

     As a minimum, each proposed appendix should contain the following
     sections:

     I. PURPOSE

         This section should consist of a brief synopsis of your
         proposal.

     II. GENERAL

         This section should contain any general statements or other
         information that you feel are necessary to understanding your
         proposal.

     III. DEFINITIONS

         This section would contain definitions of any unusual terms
         that may be necessary for the understanding of your proposal.
         If only common terms are used, this section is not required.

     Section IV (or III if definitions are not necessary) would then
     be the start of the "meat" of your proposal, and would continue
     as long as necessary.  Keep in mind that your proposal should
     primarily address policy - responsibilities and requirements -
     rather than procedures to meet those responsibilities and
     requirements.

     The last numbered section of your proposal should be:

     (?). RATIFICATION

         This section would detail any special requirements required
         for implementation of the appendix should it be ratified,
         such as providing for the removal of the "Proposed" and
         "Draft" designations in the title block, phase-in periods and
         procedures, and possibly even removal of the "RATIFICATION"
         section itself after the appendix is ratified.

     The proposal should end with a trailer, with information similar
     to the header, in a format similar to:

            --------------------------------------------------
            IFNA/FidoNet Policy Appendix xxx (Proposed)(Draft)
              Developed by:  IFNA Bylaws and Rules Committee
     FidoNews 6-47                Page 22                  20 Nov 1989


                Drafted by:  John Roberts, FidoNet 1:385/49
                              Ratified (date)
                                   *end*

     Here again, the "xxx" would be the sequence number as assigned by
     the committee, and a draft "version" may be included if desired.
     "Developed by" could be "The Policy5.DEM working group", "The
     Zone 1 FidoNet RC's", etc, and "Drafted by" would be the
     individual responsible for presenting and maintaining the current
     version of the proposal prior to ratification.  The ratification
     date would be filled in by the committee should the proposal be
     ratified.

     As I said when I started out, this description is a bit rough -
     but I hope it should suffice to get anyone wanting to present and
     Appendix proposal going in the right direction.

                              prepared by the
                        Bylaws and Rules Committee
                                  of the
                     International FidoNet Association

                             November 18, 1989

     I. PURPOSE

         This document prescribes the responsibilities of any given
         system to be listed in the IFNA nodelist, the
         responsibilities of coordinators at various levels within the
         network, and the requirements for ratification and future
         modification of this document and/or its appendices.

         There shall be no other mandatory requirements for FidoNet
         membership above and beyond those directly stipulated or for
         which specific allowance is made within this document and/or
         its appendices.

     II. GENERAL

         FidoNet is dedicated to the exchange of information among the
         general public, and as such no one may be denied a node
         address based on race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation,
         philosophy, software used, or affiliation with any other
         network.

         The usage of the personal pronouns "he" and "his" within this
         document shall be considered to be gender neutral and equally
         applicable to members of either sex.

         This document and its Appendices are prepared in English, and
         translation to other languages is expressly encouraged.  This
         is not to be construed as a direct endorsement of any given
         language as the official language of FidoNet.

     III. DEFINITIONS

         NODE:  The smallest subdivision of the network, defined as a
         single system operating within the network.  The
         responsibilities of a node are defined in the section NODE
         RESPONSIBILITIES within this document.

     FidoNews 6-47                Page 24                  20 Nov 1989


         NET:  A group of nodes, usually established within a specific
         geographic area, associated with each other by choice for
         administrative purposes and to facilitate mail transfer.

         REGION:  A group of nets and nodes that are not part of any
         net, usually in a specific geographic area, associated with
         each other for administrative purposes.

         ZONE:  A group of regions, usually in a specific geographic
         area, associated with each other for administrative purposes
         and to facilitate mail transfer.

         SYSOP:  For the purpose of this document, the single
         individual with primary responsibility for the operation of
         any given node or nodes.

         COORDINATOR:  A sysop at any given level who is designated
         certain technical responsibilities commensurate to the
         administration of the level of which he is a part.  Specific
         responsibilities of coordinators at any given level are
         defined in the section COORDINATOR RESPONSIBILITIES within
         this document.

         NODELIST:  The listing of node information that reflects
         current addressing, routing, capability, compatibility, and
         other technical information pertaining to nodes within the
         network.  The nodelist is essentially the "phone book" that
         nodes use to communicate with each other.

         ZONE MAIL HOUR:  A one hour period of time set aside for and
         dedicated to the processing of mail within a given zone, as
         designated by the coordinator of that zone.  Specifically, a
         node must operate in a "mail only" mode, performing no other
         task other than the sending and receipt of mail during such a
         designated hour.

         LOCAL MAIL SCHEDULE(S):  Additional mail period(s) as may be
         necessary within any given local net for the processing and
         distribution of mail within that net, as designated by the
         coordinator of that net.

     IV. NODE RESPONSIBILITIES

         To obtain and retain a listing in the nodelist, the sysop of
         any NODE shall be responsible for:

      |  A.  Compliance with the minimum FidoNet mail session
      |      standards as defined by the FidoNet Technical Standards
      |      Committee and approved by the IFNA Board of Directors so
      |      as to be able to send and receive mail within the
      |      network.

     FidoNews 6-47                Page 25                  20 Nov 1989


         B.  Adherence to mail hours and schedules, specifically that
             his node must properly observe zone mail hour as defined
             by the coordinator of the zone of which the node is a
             part, and any applicable mandatory local mail schedules
             as defined by any local policy or other supplement to
             this document.

         C.  Utilizing the most current nodelist available for the
             operation of his node.

     V. COORDINATOR RESPONSIBILITIES

         A.  The coordinator of a NET shall be responsible for:

             1.  Gathering, maintaining, and compiling the most
                 current information as reasonably possible concerning
                 the status of nodes within the net of which he is a
                 part, and forwarding such information to the
                 coordinator of the region of which such net is a part
                 in a timely manner to ensure its inclusion in the
                 nodelist.

             2.  The assignment of node addresses to individual nodes
                 within the net of which he is a part.

             3.  Ensuring the distribution of weekly nodelist updates
                 to the members of the net of which he is a part.

             4.  Ensuring the distribution of weekly issues of the
                 network newsletter to the members of the net of which
                 he is a part.

     A VISIT FROM MY DAISY MAID

     'Twas four in the morning, when all through the house,
     Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
     The pictures weren't hung in the front hall with care,
     And We knew that our Daisy Maid soon would be there.

     The children weren't nestled all snug in their beds,
     For visions of the vacuum roared loud in their heads.
     And Mamma in her kercheif, and I in my cap,
     Had just been awoken from our short August nap,

     When down in the kitchen, there arose such a clatter,
     I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
     Downstairs to the kitchen, I flew like a flash,
     Flung open the door and heard a loud *CRASH!*

     And then, where the worst of the blue molds did grow,
     My flahlight revealed some black gunk below..
     When what to my half-open eyes should appear,
     But a bag full of cleaners and a maid who was queer.

     She cackled and hunched as she scrubbed 'tween the bricks,
     I knew in a moment she MUST be a witch.
     More rapid than eagles, her cleaners they came,
     As she whistled and shouted and called them by name;

     "Now Freedom! Now Tilex! Now, Windex and Lysol!
     On Comet! On Old Dutch! On endust and Pine Sol!
     From the leaves on the porch to the spots on the wall!
     Now scrub away! Scrub away! Clean away all!"

     As dead plants that before the wild leaf-blower fly,
     When they met with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
     So up the the housetop, the cleaners they flew,
     With a vacuum, a mop, and my Daisy Maid too!

     And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof,
     The washing and scrubbing of my maid - what a goof!
     As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
     Down the chimney my Daisy Maid came with a bound!

     She was dressed all in mauve, from her head to her foot,
     And her clothes (from the 60's) were covered with soot!
     A bundle or rags she had flung on her back..
     She looked like a bag lady opening her sack!

     FidoNews 6-47                Page 32                  20 Nov 1989


     Her eyes did not twinkle, and so I was wary..
     Her arms her like hoses, her legs were all hairy!
     Her small little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
     And the beard on her chin was as white as the snow!

     The stump of a pipe she held tight in her teeth,
     And the smoke! It encircled her head like a wreath!
     She had a fat face, and a six storey belly,
     That shook when she cleaned like a bowl of old jelly!

     She was ugly and fat, a right scary old elf,
     And I screamed when I saw her, inspite of myself!
     A wink of her eye, and a twist of her head,
     Soon gave me to know I had PLENTY to dread.

     She spoke not a word, but went right to her work,
     And scrubbed as if mocking a cleanliness jerk!
     And laying a finger by the wart on her nose,
     And nodding her head, up the vacuum she rose!

     The cleaners, they broke a large hole in my roof,
     And soon they were followed by that crazy maid goof!
     But I heard her exclaim as she flew out of sight...
     "Happy Cleaning to All!!! I'll be back Thursday night!"

     PAM!

                  Problems With New ChicagoLand Area Code


     Effective November 11, the telephone area code for Chicago
     suburbs changed to 708.  The change was reflected in the nodelist
     update which was distributed November 10.  Although the cutover
     has gone smoothly in the Chicago area, there are certain areas
     outside of Chicago which are unable to use the new 708 code.
     Problems have been reported from California and Texas.

     If you are having problems reaching suburban Chicago numbers, try
     a temporary override to the old 312- number or host routing (the
     NC for net 115 remains in area-code 312).
