     It appears that sometime this  weekend  my  system in Connecticut
     decided  to  take  a break from its  busy  schedules  and,  well,
     "crash" might be the right word.

     Now  this  may  not  seem like too big  a  deal,  except  that  I
     currently  spend  most  of my time (and in fact  reside)  in  New
     Hampshire, where I am now employed.  And I was  unable  to get my
     sister on the phone to go see what my little toy  computer system
     was up to until today.

     That's not good.  I was really proud of the fact that  I  got the
     FidoNews out  by  midnight  every Sunday.  I guess that's the way
     things go.   But  I  apologize to anyone who is inconvenienced in
     any way by this delay.

     I'm also setting up a backup strategy.  I have arranged to have a
     system which is regularly maintained  (meaning its SysOp actually
     can and usually does reach out and physically touch it every day)
     set up as a routing point for  FidoNews  submissions and F.Req's.
     So there will be a change in the  1:1/1 listing, specifically for
     the purpose of assuring that I get stuff for  FidoNews on time to
     produce  it every week --- and also to assure that  you  will  be
     able to get that file when you call.

     I don't expect this situation to repeat itself.  I'm truly  sorry
     it even happened once.

                A MODERATED ECHOMAIL CONFERENCE PROCESSOR
                                  -or-
                           MY TWO BITS' WORTH

     This article describes a proposed improvement to echomail that
     would require only minor modifications to existing software
     (but if you want a greater programming challenge, I will make
     some additional suggestions later).

     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

     A little over a year ago, an alternative to echomail was
     introduced called "GroupMail".  The original GroupMail program
     was designed and released by System Enhancements Associates
     (SEA), Inc.

     GroupMail offered some advantages over echomail, but also had
     some drawbacks.  Some of the advantages included fact that
     SEEN-BY's did not need to be included in the messages
     (considerably reducing the size of messages as transmitted),
     that the possibility of generating duplicate messages was
     reduced to nil (as long as the conference wasn't ported to or
     from echomail!), and that conferences could be fully moderated.

     Some of the disadvantages were that conferences could be fully
     moderated (some saw this as "censorship"), a separate GroupMail
     processor was needed (meaning you had to run two separate
     conference mail processors if you wanted to run both GroupMail
     and Echomail), conferences were sent via a "File Update
     Request" mechanism that some software didn't support, one or
     more small packets were sent for each conference (rather than
     one large packet containing all conferences - this increased
     connect time required to obtain conferences), and GroupMail
     packets could only be sent in ARCed format (a more efficient
     archiving method, such as ZIP or LHARC could not be used).
     Because of these and other factors, GroupMail gained wide
     acceptance only in Alternet, and then only in Alternet within
     the United States.

     One of the reasons that GroupMail may not have gained
     acceptance was that it was created by System Enhancement
     Associates.  At the time of GroupMail's introduction (right
     after the conclusion of the infamous SEA vs. PKWare lawsuit),
     several sysops in Fidonet expressed a low opinion of SEA... and
     a number of sysops felt so strongly anti-SEA that they refused
     to use any SEA products, or even carry SEA products on their
     boards for downloading.  This anti-SEA sentiment probably
     caused some sysops to refuse to even consider using GroupMail.

     FidoNews 7-04                Page 3                   29 Jan 1990


     A larger problem, however, was that GroupMail processors were
     not available for all the various types of hardware
     configurations that are now participating in Fidonet-technology
     networks.  Thus, in some cases, GroupMail had to be converted
     to standard echomail in order to provide feeds to those
     systems.  For some reason, this conversion process didn't
     always work perfectly, with the result that many duplicate
     messages were generated at the points where these conversions
     took place.  Since GroupMail processors were created with the
     assumption that duplicate messages could not occur, no dupe
     checking was performed by GroupMail processors.  Some sysops
     abandoned the use of GroupMail due to the number of dupes
     created in the GroupMail-Echomail conversion.

     Now, suppose that you could have all the advantages of
     GroupMail with none of the disadvantages?  Would you like to
     get conferences without nine or ten lines of SEEN-BY's in each
     message?  Would you like to get these as part of your regular
     echomail delivery, and not have to run additional software
     (beyond what you use with normal echomail) to handle these
     conferences?

     Would you like to participate in moderated conferences, where
     the moderator actually has the power to keep the "twits" from
     posting messages?  (I'll have more to say about conference
     moderation vs. "censorship" later).

     My proposal (which I'll call "moderated echomail"), in its most
     basic form,  makes two very minor changes to the way echomail
     is currently handled:

     1) TWO BITS are reserved in each message header to indicate
     whether a message is true echomail, upbound to the moderator's
     system, downbound from the moderator's system, or local only.

     2) Echomail processors are modified slightly as shown below.

     THE ADDED TWO BITS

     The first question is, where do we put these two bits, and what
     are they used for?  Consider a typical message header, which
     includes the following information:

          MsgHType = Record
           fromUser      : array[1..36] of Char;
           toUser        : array[1..36] of Char;
           Subject       : array[1..72] of Char;
           datetime      : array[1..20] of Char;
           timesRead     : Word;
           DestNode      : integer;
           OrigNode      : integer;
     FidoNews 7-04                Page 4                   29 Jan 1990


           Cost          : Word;
           origNet       : integer;
           Destnet       : integer;
           DestZone      : integer;
           Origzone      : integer;
           filler        : Array[1..4] of char;
           Backlink      : Word;
           Attribute     : Word;
           FwrdLink      : Word;
          end;

     Note that the above header record structure is as used by Henk
     Weavers in Dutchie, and includes integers (2 bytes each) for
     originating and destination Zone information followed by four
     bytes of "filler".  Originally, these eight bytes were supposed
     to be used for two 32-bit timestamps showing when the user
     originally wrote the message, and when the message arrived
     on-line (?) but it appears that hardly anyone ever actually
     used them in that manner.  Unfortunately, we can't count on the
     four "filler" bytes being set in any particular manner and
     there's always the possibility that someone may actually be
     putting a timestamp there.

     However, note the "Cost" field above.  Virtually no one uses it
     in any case, but it's totally meaningless in an echomail
     message.  Therefore, I propose that top two bits of the second
     byte of this cost field be reassigned for use in echomail
     messages only (this would NOT change the specification for
     netmail at all):

     Instead of:         Cost          : Word;

     We'd use:           Filler        : Char;
                         EchoMsgType   : Char;

     Where the echo message type would be defined as follows:

          Bits 5-0      Reserved for future use
          Bits 7-6      Used as follows:

                                                Bit 6      Bit 7
                                                -----      -----
     Regular Echomail                             0          0
     Moderated echomail upbound to moderator      1          0
     Moderated echomail downbound from moderator  0          1
     Local message                                1          1

     Note that the above scheme gives us compatibility with existing
     echomail, because most echomail processors now simply stuff a
     zero byte into this field.  So if we are connecting with a
     board that doesn't know about this new scheme, we'll still be
     able to do regular echomail with them.

     FidoNews 7-04                Page 5                   29 Jan 1990


     A bit of explanation about the four possible message types that
     can be indicated by this scheme:

     Regular echomail is what we're all getting now.  It's totally
     unchanged from the present system of echomail distribution.

     Moderated echomail upbound travels only in an upbound direction
     to the moderator's system.  When a message is entered locally,
     Bit 6 is set and from there on the message travels upstream
     only, and only to one system (your feed for the conference).

     Moderated echomail downbound travels only in a downbound
     direction to systems that you feed.  It is never sent back
     upstream to the moderator's system (that would cause dupes).

     Local messages never leave the board on which they're posted.
     They are simply ignored by the echomail processor.  This would
     allow the Sysop of a board to post a message to users of a
     particular echo (a notice that the echo feed will be
     interrupted, or perhaps a permanent post of the conference
     rules) without that message being exported to any other board.

     MODIFICATIONS TO THE CONFERENCE MAIL PROCESSOR

     In the following discussion, I'm going to use a sample fragment
     of an AREAS.BBS file, as currently used by ConfMail and several
     other programs.  All node numbers used as examples are picked
     at random for example purposes only.

     Lets say that you're getting the FOR-SALE conference from 123/4
     and feeding it to 398/2, 321/7, and 234/999.  Your entry in the
     AREAS.BBS file would look something like this:

     D:\MSG\FOR-SALE FOR-SALE 123/4 398/2 321/7 234/999

     Now, if the FOR-SALE conference remained as regular echomail,
     the above line could remain exactly as shown above with a
     moderated echomail processor.  It would be treated exactly as
     it is today.

     But, suppose that it became a moderated conference.  In that
     case you might use something like the following:

     D:\MSG\FOR-SALE FOR-SALE -u123/4 -d398/2 321/7 -e234/999

     As you see, switches have been added to indicate that various
     nodes are to be treated differently.  While each author of an
     echomail processor might use a different method to achieve the
     same result, I would suggest that a typical echomail processor
     might allow the following switches (note that the use of ANY of
     these switches [with the possible exception of -a or -p]
     indicates that the conference is moderated echomail as opposed
     to regular echomail):

     FidoNews 7-04                Page 6                   29 Jan 1990


     -a  My address - if used, overrides the defaults in CONFIG.DOG
     or MAIL.SYS (or whatever).  Use this address when adding an
     ORIGIN line or adding to a PATH line in messages in this
     conference (if more than one address follows this switch, use
     the first in the ORIGIN line but insert all into the PATH line.
     Normally there should never need to be more than one address
     following this line, but multiple addresses should be allowed
     for coping with unusual circumstances).

     -d  Addresses following are "downlinks" (nodes you feed the
     conference to).  You may or may not have one or more of these
     (unless you're a moderator, then you must have at least one of
     these).

     -e  Feed the conference to these systems as regular echomail.
     This switch should not be used unless absolutely necessary, in
     order to feed a conference to nodes incapable of running any
     moderated echomail processors.

     -m  This switch is NOT followed by a net/node, but is used to
     indicate that YOU are the moderator for this conference.  This
     is mutually exclusive with -u.  You must have at least one node
     listed under a -d switch (if you're a moderator, then you've
     got to have "downlinks" to feed the conference to!).

     -p  This switch is NOT followed by a net/node, but is used to
     indicate that this conference is "passthru" (not carried on
     your system, but passed through to other systems).

     -u  Only ONE address is allowed to follow this switch, and that
     is the address of your "uplink" (your feed) for this
     conference.

     -x  This switch is NOT followed by a net/node, and is only
     valid when the -m switch is also used.  It indicates that
     messages in this conference should be exported any time the
     "export" function of the moderated echomail processor is
     invoked (normally, messages in conference areas where you are
     the moderator would NOT be exported unless a special command
     line switch is used, in order to give you time to review the
     messages first.  This switch overrides that, and indicates that
     the messages should be exported any time messages are exported
     from the areas that you do not moderate).

     The moderated echomail processor should consider any of the
     following an error (to aid in dupe message elimination and
     detecting improper setup):

     * A -d or -e switch is used but a -m or -u is not
     * A -m switch is used but no -d switch is used
     * A -x switch is used but no -m switch is used
     * More than one node is listed after a -u switch
     * The same net/node number appears twice in the line

     FidoNews 7-04                Page 7                   29 Jan 1990


     Please note that the above listing of switches is just an
     example of one possible implementation.  Various software
     authors may (and probably will) choose to do things in a
     slightly different manner.

     Now lets consider how the moderated echomail processor should
     handle various situations that may occur.

     The first caveat is that any duplicate message checking built
     into the echomail processor should be used with moderated
     echomail, but keep in mind that moderated echomail WILL pass
     through some systems twice (once in the upbound direction and
     again in the downbound direction...  but note that only a very
     small percentage of the total echo traffic will be passed
     upbound in most cases).  So if you are checksumming parts of
     the message header when checking for dupes, be sure to include
     the Echo Message Type byte in your calculations (or keep the
     data for previously seen upbound messages separate from the
     data for previously seen downbound messages).  Please note that
     the participants of the NET_DEV (Network Software Developers')
     echo conference have been trying to forge an agreement on some
     type of standardized message ID kludge line that would be used
     for duplicate message checking, so you may want to check in
     that echo conference (or with the Fidonet Technical Standards
     Committee) to determine if any agreement has been reached in
     this regard.

     Also, a moderated echomail processor should never attach
     SEEN-BY lines to a moderated echomail message EXCEPT when
     echoing that message to an "echomail only" node as specified by
     the "-e" switch.  In that case, it should attach a SEEN-BY line
     containing its own address (including any AKA's specified in
     the CONFIG.DOG or MAIL.SYS file, and/or specified by the "-a"
     switch).

     A moderated echomail processor should ALWAYS use a Zone number
     in PATH line statements (in fact, full four-dimensional
     Zone:Net/Node.Point addressing should be permitted in the
     PATH).  It should not be necessary, however, to repeat
     redundant information.  For example, a message originating on
     1:123/4, going to 1:444/2, then to 1:444/4 and finally to
     1:448/7 might have a PATH line that looks like this:

     ^aPATH: 1:234/4 444/2 4 448/7

     The above rule (that the Zone MUST be used) becomes important
     when you consider the next duplicate message elimination
     feature:

     A moderated echomail processor should NEVER send a message to a
     node that already appears in the PATH line, under any
     circumstances!  In order for this to be effective, two
     assumptions are made in regard to the PATH line:

     FidoNews 7-04                Page 8                   29 Jan 1990


     1) It contains full Zone:Net/Node[.Point] addressing
     information

     2) The moderator's system strips the path line (and starts a
     new one) before releasing messages to the downbound stream
     (note that if this is objectionable, the old PATH line could be
     preserved but the kludge line token changed to ^aUPTH to keep
     the upbound path line separated from the downbound one).

     Let's consider what happens when upbound messages arrive at the
     moderator's system.  First, the normal dupe checking is
     performed.  Second, messages are verified as being "good" (okay
     to toss into the downbound stream) by the following tests:

     1) Does the message have the "upbound" bit set?  A message
     should never arrive on the moderator's system with only the
     "downbound" bit set (if one does, it's probably a dupe and
     should not be sent back out!).

     2) Is the message flagged as regular echomail?  If so, then are
     any nodes in the AREAS.BBS file flagged with the /e switch?  If
     not, it's a bad message, otherwise one of the nodes in the PATH
     line should match one of the nodes flagged with the /e switch
     (see below).

     If the incoming messages meet the above tests, the moderated
     echomail processor should change the EchoMsgType flag to
     "Moderated echomail downbound" and strip the existing PATH line
     from the message (or rename it to ^aUPTH as mentioned above).
     A new PATH Line should be started containing the Moderator's
     address.  The message should then be tossed to the appropriate
     message area.  Depending on how the system is set up, these
     messages could be tossed to the downlinks immediately, or could
     be held until the moderator has a chance to review the messages
     and cull out any inappropriate ones (this would probably be
     controlled by a command line or control file option of the
     conference mail processor).  In any event, these messages would
     be tossed in the same manner as a downbound message sent by any
     other node (see below).

     At systems OTHER THAN the moderator's system, the following
     tests would be performed on incoming messages:  First, normal
     dupe checking would be performed.  Then, the EchoMsgType flag
     would be tested, and action would be taken according to the
     results of that test:

     1) If the message is upbound, any SEEN-BY lines would be
     stripped, the system's address would be added to the PATH line,
     and the message would be sent ONLY to the uplink (feed) for
     that conference.  After it has been packed to the uplink, the
     message should then be removed from the message area (it will
     come back as a downbound message from the moderator's system).

     FidoNews 7-04                Page 9                   29 Jan 1990


     2) If the message is downbound, any SEEN-BY lines would be
     stripped, the system's address would be added to the PATH line,
     and the message would be sent ONLY to the downlinks (nodes you
     feed) for that conference.  Note that there are two types of
     nodes you might be feeding:  Those that take the conference as
     moderated conference mail (specified by the -d switch) and
     those that take the conference as regular echomail (specified
     by the -e switch).  In the case of nodes that receive the
     conference as regular echomail, a SEEN-BY line will have to be
     added containing the system's own address (including any AKA's
     specified in the CONFIG.DOG or MAIL.SYS file, and/or specified
     by the "-a" switch).

     3) If the message is flagged as regular echomail, but is going
     into a moderated conference area, then one of the nodes listed
     in the PATH line (not necessarily the last one) should be the
     same as one of the nodes specified with the "-e" switch in the
     AREAS.BBS file.  The search should begin with the LAST node in
     the PATH line and compared to ALL of the nodes specified with
     the "-e" switch.  If the LAST node in the PATH line doesn't
     match, then the NEXT TO LAST node should be compared, and so on
     until the entire PATH line has been searched (in a reverse
     direction).  If a match is found, then the message is assumed
     to be "good" and the EchoMsgType flag should be changed to
     indicate that the message is upbound, the SEEN-BY line(s)
     should be stripped, and it should be further handled as any
     other upbound message (as indicated in #1 above).

     The only other consideration is what happens when someone
     leaves a message locally, via the BBS or a message editor.
     These messages should be flagged as upbound, and have an ORIGIN
     line and a PATH line appended (if necessary) and then handled
     as in #1 above.  Keep in mind that some BBS programs may append
     their own ORIGIN, PATH, or SEEN-BY lines which may have to be
     stripped or checked for validity.

     Please note that there are a couple of peculiarities of this
     scheme:

     First, you can convert a conference from moderated echomail to
     regular echomail, in order to provide a feed to those nodes
     incapable of handling moderated echomail.  But you simply can't
     convert a non-moderated (regular Echomail) conference to a
     moderated one at any downstream point.  If you receive the
     conference as non-moderated, you have to pass it along that
     way.  This makes sense if you stop and think about it.

     Second, if you convert a moderated conference to regular
     echomail, the nodes receiving a feed from you will eventually
     get back a second copy of any message originating on their
     system (or on the system of anyone else that they in turn echo
     the conference to).  Therefore, they should be prepared to
     accept the occasional dupe of their own messages when it comes
     back downstream through your system (normally, their dupe
     killer will automatically kill it for them).  It would be
     possible to watch for these messages to come back downstream
     FidoNews 7-04                Page 10                  29 Jan 1990


     and kill them automatically, but that would require a lot of
     code and a lot of effort (translation:  I can't think of a good
     way to do it).

     For this reason, it's a good idea to convert moderated
     conferences to echomail only for "leaf nodes" (nodes that run
     conferences on their own systems but don't feed them to anyone
     else) under your system.  If "least cost routing"
     considerations make it necessary for nodes that you feed as
     echomail to in turn feed the conference to someone else, you
     should keep a close eye on the topology to make sure that they
     aren't feeding the conference back into the network at some
     other point (the dupe checking and security measures built into
     this scheme make it very unlikely that they could cause a
     serious dupe problem, but they could still be running up
     someone's phone bill or increasing the amount of time someone
     is spending processing echomail).

     The above is the basic proposal.  Next week I'll discuss an
     optional addition (an improvement, I hope!) to the above
     scheme.

       BULLETFAX <tm> from NUNTIUS

       Attention Bulletin Board Operators!

       BulletFax - A NEW service for your users!

       BulletFax turns your BBS into a FAX server!

       BulletFax is a "demand publishing" tool for Bulletin Board
     Systems. Callers now have the ability to retrieve documentation
     from a BBS that can include extensive graphics.  That
     documentation is then printed out at the callers fax machine.
     There is no need to download a document, load into a word
     processor or graphics editor and then print out.  The Fax
     machine in essence becomes a "remote graphics printer".

       With BulletFax, a caller can access an unlimited document
     base of information limited only by the size of your hard drive.
     BulletFax is particularly well suited for the maintainance and
     delivery of large technical document bases or large catalogs of
     product or price information in the commercial environment.

       Complete text string search facilities are avaiable in
     BulletFax. Searches can be made against either file names or
     abstracts created when the documents are loaded into the system.

          APPLICATIONS ? Well, for starters, how about -

          Price Sheets        ...    Brochures       ...
          Catalogs            ...    Stock Info    ...
          Technical Drawings  ...    Advertisements  ...
          Coupons             ...    Graphics     ...

       BulletFax is designed with the BBS system operator in mind.
     It is easy to install, and documents may be located anywhere on
     the system. If you run a BBS, you will find BulletFax easy to
     configure.

       Extensive security is built into BulletFax, including password
     protection and document security protection. Complete call
     transactions are maintained, as well as user record logs.
     BulletFax may be configured as simply as to allow anyone to fax
     documents back to their fax, to as complex as running a fully
     secured system where users must be verified before document access
     is given.

     FidoNews 7-04                Page 16                  29 Jan 1990


       Documents may be grouped together in different security levels.
     There is also a hidden SysOp document function available.

       BulletFax can be configured in two ways. With two lines..one for
     the bbs and one for the fax card, faxes are transmitted as soon as
     the request is made WHILE THE CALLER IS STILL ON LINE.
     With a single line the fax transmission begins as soon as the
     caller logs off the BBS.

       BulletFax uses the Intel Connection Co-Processor. With the
     additional use of the Intel 2400b option card, your BBS can be
     configured to receive fax transmissions as well.
     The use of the 2400b option card also saves on valuable slot space
     inside your PC if you use internal modems.  Faxable files are stored
     on the system in simple ASCII format or in .PCX .DCX file formats.

       BulletFax will work with any BBS system that has "Doorway"
     capability (drop to dos). It will work with single line versions
     of programs like TBBS, FIDO, OPUS, RBBS, Wildcat!, and WWIV.

       BulletFax also comes bundled with a registered copy of Marshall
     Dudley's DOORWAY program, which you will find useful for your other
     Drop To Dos functions.

     Nuntius Corporation

     Nuntius is a software development firm and complete value added
     reseller of computer related fax systems.  Nuntius has acted as
     consultants to many Fortune 500 companies on the strategic use of
     fax throughout the entire enterprise. Nuntius is developing a number
     of fax related products for the OS/2 operating system.

     Nuntius BulletFax<tm>

     Nuntius is currently developing a stand alone version of BulletFax
     that will not require the use of a BBS.  In addition Nuntius is
     developing techniques for the use of Bullet-Fax in Multi-Line BBS
     systems. Call for further information and details.

                    Computer Information Monthly News!
                                 CIMN(sm)

                           Copyright 1989, 1990

          Beyond  my wildest expectations,  that is the only way I can
     describe  the  interest  in the DISKazine  I  have  created.   At
     present  there are approximately 50 different places  around  the
     United  States  and Canada who are/have file requested the  file.
     In  addition to this I forwarded a diskette with both  Black  and
     White  and the Color program to the Software Distribution Network
     coordinator.

         I  have also received numerous request on how to get  a  copy
     without going through the file request route or from places where
     FReq  is  not practical.   In reply to those who  are  interested
     because  in  some  cases  you have not left a  return  address  I
     provide the following.

     Computer  Information  Monthly News may be  obtained  by  sending
     $1.00 US, for one months issue to:

                  High Mesa Publishing
                  13 Osage Drive
                  Los Lunas, NM  87031

          I  must  inform  you  the CIMN program  itself  is  strictly
     FREEWARE, you are not being required to pay for the program.  The
     $1.00 will be used to purchase:

                  a.  Diskette      1 ea.                  .50
                  b.  Stamps        1 ea.  Some cases 2.   .25
                  c.  Labels        2 ea.                  .10
                  d.  Envelope      1 ea.                  .10

          I realize the above does not come to exaclty one dollar, but
     I  feel that sending change through the mail is a waste  of  your
     time  and  mine.   An since you may want to receive the  next  12
     issues of the magazine you may send the amount necessary to cover
     the number of issues you would like to receive.

          Again  I  would like to Thank those of you who have  FReq'ed
     the  file and remind everyone it can be file requested  23  hours
     per day.  The file names to request are:

                 CIMN.ARC OR ZIP..........COLOR VERSION
                 CIMNBW.ARC OR ZIP........BLACK & WHITE VERSION
