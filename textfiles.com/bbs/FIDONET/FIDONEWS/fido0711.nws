     Brice Fleckenstein
     Sysop, 1:231/190


     And now, by popular demand, we introduce:

     AREA: BASIC - the BASIC Echomail Conference

     (My cat is with me as I type this....)


     The Purpose of the BASIC Echo
     -----------------------------

     This conference was created in responce to the constant
     fustration expressed in the QUIK_BAS echo that there was no
     viable place to discuss all of the various OTHER BASIC variants
     out there, from the original Dartmouth to the current crop of
     non-MicroSoft Compiled BASICs. I saw a need, so I set out to
     fill it.


     Valid postings in the BASIC Echo
     --------------------------------

     Valid messages for this conference should deal with programming
     tricks, features, "how to", problem reports, interesting
     applications, interaction with other products, and other such
     related topics.
     Product reviews and comparisons are also appropriate topics of
     discussion, but "This BASIC is better than this other BASIC"
     flames will NOT be permitted.


     Who should be reading the BASIC Echo
     ------------------------------------

     Anyone who programs in BASIC, or any potential BASIC programmer,
     should access the BASIC echo.


     Addressing the question: Who died and left YOU boss?
     ----------------------------------------------------

     Someone had to be Moderator. I elected myself, as nobody else
     seemed more willing to start an echo like this.


     My qualifications
     -----------------

     FidoNews 7-11                Page 6                   12 Mar 1990


     I first learned to program on a DEC PDP-11/70, in BASIC+ under
     RSTS/E. I have since programmed in BASIC+2 on various other
     PDP-11's, MBASIC on several CP/M machines, Level I and II BASICs
     on the TRS-80 models 1/3/4, Commodore's BASIC 2.0 and the BLITZ!
     Compiled BASIC on Commodore C64's, Commodore BASIC 7.0 and the
     Abacus Basic-128 compiler on C128's, BASICA/GWBASIC and Turbo
     BASIC and Quick BASIC on various IBM XT/AT Clones. I've also
     "played" with about 10 other BASIC dialects not listed here over
     the years.
     Just to keep things balanced, I've also programmed in a few
     FORTRAN dialects, COBOL, 6502/6510/8502 assembler, MACRO-11,
     TECO, MASM, JRT Pascal, Z80 assemblers, and played around in
     another 5 - 10 other languages.


     Getting a feed
     --------------

     Send Net Mail to "Sysop" at 1:231/190, and I'll put you in the
     distribution list. I'm going to be HOLDing for all of you for
     now, as I can't afford the outgoing calls. Once the message
     traffic builds up, I plan to link BASIC into the Backbone.


     The Rules
     ---------

     Here, I blatantly cribbed from Vince's BinkleyTerm Code of
     Conduct - basically, the rules are simple. Stay on the subject,
     leave the politics and the flamethrowers at home, and have an
     enjoyable and (hopefully) informative time.


     What about the QUIK_BAS echo?
     -----------------------------

     QUIK_BAS is a usefull and informative echo - it does what it's
     intended to do, which is to discuss MicroSoft's QuickBASIC and
     it's close relatives BASICA/GWBASIC and BASCOM. (I'm not sure
     where Basmark's UNIX ports of QuickBASIC fall, as the question
     hasn't come up yet.) I intend to continue to be a participant
     and carry QUIK_BAS. I just wanted a forem where I could talk
     about the OTHER dialects of BASIC I use or have used in the
     past - and several other folks expressed the same desire.
     BASIC is not intended to supplant QUIK_BAS - it's intended to
     reduce the off-base traffic there by providing a PROPER forem
     for some of the valid but off-topic QUIK_BAS traffic.



     If any of you have ANY other questions about the BASIC echo,
     feel free to send me mail.

                     Digital Electronics Circuit Echo

     I love getting at the root of things. By the same token, I love
     getting as much out of my computer as possible. That is probably
     why I program mostly in assembly language.

     Lately I came to the realization that assembly language is still
     pretty high level for my personal preference. :-) At any rate, I
     started playing with my old love, electronics, more specifically
     digital electronics. I will probably not be satisfied until I
     design my own microchips.

     At this point I have more questions than answers, so I started
     looking for an echo where I could ask them without being
     considered weird. I could not find it, so I decided to start
     one.

     By the time you are reading this, DIGITRON should be readily
     available at the backbone. The echo will deal with all aspects
     of digital electronics. By that I do not mean "How do I put a
     hard disk controller in my computer", but more something along
     the line of "How do I design a hard disk controller".

     The echo is not restricted but should attract those who like
     keeping thier computer without a cover and close to their
     soldering pencil. If you subscribe to Circuit Cellar Ink or to
     Micro Cornucopia, you are the kind of person this echo has been
     designed for.

                          FL_LIVING Echo


     We have a local Echo [FLA_CUISINE] that has changed names
     and content and become Extralocal that you and your Users
     may be interested in.

     FL_LIVING is Hosted and Moderated by Barbara O'Keefe at
     1:135/54 and is dedicated to the discussion of all aspects
     of Florida Living including but not limited to: dining;
     recipes; weather; housing; regional specialties; tourist
     information; entertainment; fishing forecasts; real estate
     info; or anything else you can think of in the State of
     Florida!

     This Echo is not restricted to Florida systems and ALL
     Region 18 AND FidoNet systems EVERYWHERE are invited to
     participate. This Echo may be of interest to anyone
     considering moving or retiring to Florida or those just
     interested in the Sunshine State. [grin]

     If participation picks up, it may become available on the
     Backbone. It should be available at REC18 by the time you
     read this.

     In the meantime, contact Barbara O'Keefe at 1:135/54 or me
     at 1:135/14 for a link. We hope that more Florida systems
     will join in so we can get the perspective of the middle
     and northern parts as well as the southern viewpoint.

     That's the general idea. [grin]

     The Echo label is FL_LIVING. In addition, Florida systems
     should have their Florida city in their origin line so
     everyone knows what part of Florida you are talking about
     and if you mention a specific place or area, you should
     define it as if people outside your immediate area are
     reading it [as they will be]. This ain't a 'local' Echo
     anymore! [grin]

     TTFN.

                               Aaaarrrgh!


     All environments where people don't stay in personal contact
     have the same disease, misinformation. Unfortunately, some
     people in FidoNet and OtherNet(probably tm) has always taken
     it upon themselves to uphold the BIRS (Bullshit Information
     Retrieval System). I usually don't give a damn about rumors,
     but enuf is enuf.

     I didn't really feel like writing this article until I spoke
     to a local SysOp over the phone. He had read in the Wildcat!
     conference that "Yes, Joaquim is in Australia" and this was
     supposed to be on "good authority". Someone else claims that
     I'm going to Australia to work on RemoteAccess full-time, that
     I stole source code from Adam Hudson's QuickBBS, and that I
     put it in RemoteAccess. I don't know who's spreading these
     rumors, and I don't really care - unfortunately, other people
     seem to believe them.

     I'm moving to Australia on the 12th of March. I've always
     wanted to see Australia and I was (am) getting bored down
     here in Miami. Whether or not my Australian Adventure(tm)
     :-) will be a permanent thing, I don't know. This does have
     some impact on things I'm involved in at the moment.

     1) I have No, Nada, Zip, Zilch, Njet, Inga, Nix intention of
     quitting the development of FrontDoor, TosScan and/or AirMail,
     my pet project. I know this is hard for some people (no names)
     to swallow, but: while(!believe_me), read_fact(1);

     2) FrontDoor 1.99c has been released by the time you read this.
     And is hopefully working like it should. My main concern is (of
     course) whether or not it talks properly to SEAdogs so Phil
     Buonomo doesn't have to start his FDECHO polution again.

     2a) There will ALWAYS (read it again to make sure you get it),
     be a free for noncommercial use version of FrontDoor.

     3) TosScan 1.10 will go into beta testing two or so weeks after
     I've arrived in Australia and found all the bars in town (hmm,
     that could take three weeks I guess..). Whether or not I'll be
     able to add TBBS/PCBoard support for 1.10 is something I don't
     know at the moment. But they're included in my plans at least.

     4) Both FrontDoor and TosScan (and most likely AirMail) will be
     available for OS/2 and Xenix towards the end of 1990 hopefully.

     5) I will be polling 1:260/340 once or twice per day as well as
     picking up some echomail (FDECHO, etc.) from his system. I also
     have a private system listed in Net-260 (1:260/20) which will
     be routed via 1:260/340 (which is the host system). So mail
     will always reach me in or less than a day.

     6) People who have ordered the commercial version of FrontDoor
     will be receiving it in the near future. That's my top priority
     when I get down under.

     7) Before spreading rumors, read 1-6.

     8) See 7.

     Too all FrontDoor and TosScan users, and the KoolDudes(tm),
     hang in there.. it only gets better. To all the others, have
     no illusions, I'm not even getting close to a burn-out. It's
     party time!


     Thanks for your attention,

                               MSGID / REPLY
                 A proposal for unique message identifiers
                          and reply chain linkage

                               INITIAL DRAFT
                               06 March 1990

                                 jim nutt
                             1:114/30@fidonet
        From a message originally posted in the NET_DEV conference

     The following is a brief description of the proposed standard for
     generating msgid/reply 'kludge'  lines in a message.  Msgids have
     a  number  of  uses    besides  simply  being  a  unique  message
     identifier.  They can be  used for dupe killing and reply linkage
     as well.

     MSGID

     A MSGID line consists of the  string  ^AMSGID:    followed  by  a
     space, the address of the originating system  and a serial number
     unique to that message on the originating system.  i.e:

                ^MSGID: zone:net/node.point@domain serialno

     It is not the intent to limit the  address  field of the msgid to
     fidonet    style   addresses,  they  are  used  here  simply  for
     illustration, messages  originating  from  other types of systems
     should use an address appropriate to the originating system.  The
     serial  number  may be  anything  the  developer's  little  heart
     desires, AS LONG AS IT IS UNIQUE, NO TWO MESSAGES ON A SYSTEM MAY
     SHARE A SERIAL NUMBER!!  The  serial  number is formatted as an 8
     character hexadecimal integer, i.e.  a 32  bit  word.  since this
     yields in the neighborhood of 4 billion unique  numbers,  I don't
     think it will be a limit for most systems.    A common choice for
     the  serial  number  is  the number of seconds since 1  jan  1970
     00:00:00  gmt,  this  is  unique  on  a  single  user  system and
     relatively easy to  generate.    A  more  elaborate  system  will
     doubtless be necessary in the case of a multi-user system.

     REPLY

     A REPLY line looks similiar to a MSGID line, and is in fact, very
     close.  REPLY lines are  generated  using  the  MSGID line of the
     message being replied to.  The ^AMSGID:  string in the MSGID line
     is replaced with ^AREPLY:  and then  written  to  the text of the
     new message.  i.e.:

             ^AREPLY: msgid of original message

     Again, this is very simple and as non-compute intense as possible

     FidoNews 7-11                Page 13                  12 Mar 1990


     GENERAL

     For best results, MSGID and REPLY lines should  be  the first two
     lines of the message after extended addressing lines (FMPT, TOPT,
     INTL,  DOMAIN), with MSGID appearing above REPLY.  This makes  it
     unlikely  that  a MSGID will be damaged by something that doesn't
     destroy the  binary  message header as well.  As mentioned above,
     it doesn't really  matter  what  method is used in generating the
     serial number, as long  as it produces an eight digit hexadecimal
     number UNIQUE TO THE ORIGINATING SYSTEM.  Finally, a MSGID SHOULD
     BE GENERATED ONLY AT MESSAGE CREATION,  IT  SHOULD NEVER, EVER BE
     STRIPPED FROM A MESSAGE NOR SHOULD ONE  BE  ADDED  TO  A  MESSAGE
     PASSING  THROUGH A SYSTEM (whew, all those caps  wore  me  out!).
     This  is  essential  for  a  msgid  to  be useful,  without  this
     restriction, msgids are useless or worse.

     RATIONALE

     Finally,  what you've all been waiting for (I'm entering this  in
     sixty  line mode and the top has scrolled off...) WHY you  should
     use msgid and reply kludge lines.  Good question and one that has
     several answers, which I will cover one by one...

     1) They  eliminate  the  need for origin lines.  A msgid contains
        all the information an origin line  is  technically there for.
        It is in a safer place than  an  origin  line  and  much  less
        likely to be truncated or destroyed while leaving  the rest of
        the message intact.

     2) Is  related  to  1)  above, a msgid makes private  replies  to
        echomail via netmail  a trivial process, you know exactly what
        system originated the message  without  worrying about parsing
        out the origin line (and we all know how much fun THAT is..)

     3) True reply linkage is possible  in  echomail  because you know
        exactly which message the reply is to.  You just  look  for  a
        message  whose msgid matches the reply in the current message.
        And you  already  have  a  database of msgids for dupe killing
        (more  later).   This  also  lets  you  track  replies  ACROSS
        echomail  conferences....    some   fascinating  possibilities
        there, eh?

     4) Annoying messages can be tracked  more  accurately.    Because
        msgids are a 'hidden'  line and therefore not normally visible
        or creatable by your average  user, they are considerably more
        difficult to forge than an origin  line  (forging  which  is a
        trivial task).  Admittedly this isn't going  to  stop  a  twit
        sysop, but that 8 digit serial number is going to be a problem
        for him...  If he copies one that already  exists, the message
        will  be  killed as a dupe, if he makes one  up,  chances  are
        fairly good that that will be a dupe as well, so  it does make
     FidoNews 7-11                Page 14                  12 Mar 1990


        forgery a bit more difficult.

     5) Accurate dupe killing  is possible.  By maintaining a database
        of  msgids  one  can easily check to see if  a  message  is  a
        duplicate  of  one already entered.  If it is stipulated  that
        msgids must  be sequential, it becomes, once again, trivial...
        simply store the  highest  serial  number that has come from a
        particular address, any messages  that  come  in with a serial
        number lower than that can be assumed dupes and killed.

     6) Tracking of dupe generators is  possible.    Since  msgids are
        never stripped and never added, the only  msgid  on  a message
        should be the one of the originating system...

     7) Simplicity.   MSGID and REPLY kludgelines are very  simple  to
        generate, they require no complex calculations and are easy to
        parse.   And they give you all the benefits above.  So why NOT
        use them?


     FINALLY

     Your questions and comments are  welcome and will be responded to
     as time permits.  This is  only  the  initial  draft, there are a
     number of proposed extensions to this specification already.

     In CASE You Wondered --

     "CASE enters mid-life crises."  No I didn't read it, I just
     wanted some continuity.  Hopefully, Computer Aided Software
     Engineering has been sufficiently exposed for the HOAX it
     really is.  It's one of those "You haven't come a long way
     enough yet baby" industries.

     The trouble with CASE programs is that you could spend as much
     time learning the tool and using it as you could spend just
     writing the required programs.  The unfortunate thing about
     software generation tools is that they are so terribly
     imperfect.  You spend too much time fixing at the source level.

     The 'life cycle' documenter style tools are generally worthless.
     You really think your executives look at that stuff ?

     The worst part is that even when they work, CASE tools are
     bereft of learning potential.  The methodologies are lost in
     the tool implementation.  CASE is a waste of time.


     BBS For Sale --

     A way back, ( Mr. Wizard ), I wrote a line protocol drivers for
     banks and airlines that ran in a Motorola 6800.  My pride and
     joy was a 600 line front-end to a Big Blue bookkeeping system.

     Due to line tariffs imposed by the Danish government run Data
     Network, a minimum 5 second line charge was the driving factor
     in network operation.  Now bank transactions tend to be pretty
     short and sweet, so the connect rates peaked in the 100 per
     second range.  The system had 1500 users.

     Well, now after 8 years the system has been replaced by Big
     Blue's own hardware and 2 man years worth of custom software.
     My little mail system handled well over 3 BILLION CALLS; now
     it's gone.

     The hardware was sold to Air Canada, to add to their existing
     reservation system.  Ah, Winnipeg in the spring...

     The Salesmanship Club --

     "Just don't say NO".  Have you noticed the layered approach to
     Big Blue's sales force?  I have proof of TECHNICAL SALES,
     Management Sales and Executive Sales.  There are probably more.

     In my profession, I see a lot of Technical Salespersons.  If
     they think they are losing you, they call up Management Sales
     who talks to your boss.  If you have explained to your boss why
     Big Blue's latest box won't help, and he passes this on to
     Management Sales, then here comes Executive Sales.

     The most efficient method to employ is to keep Technical Sales
     happy by never, repeat NEVER, mentioning that you are not 100%
     for their proposal.  Some good leader lines include :  We are
     analyzing our software to determine the best method for
     porting;  We are discussing a merger with Department B and need
     a better definition of storage requirements;  We are awaiting
     your announcement on <insert appropriate vaporware here>.  You
     get the picture.


     Danish for Honey --

     Honey wants to write momma a letter on WHOSE machine ?

     Let's see now, KEYBDA for the keyboard : oh no, where's the
     slash key ?  OK now how do I set the screen fonts ?  Darn. Well
     let's print it, anyway.  Oops, let's try this character set.

     "Look, real Danish characters!" <whew>

     "I want a typewriter."
