     FidoCon '90 Update (7/1):

     If you plan on attending and staying for meals or at the hotel,
     we MUST know whether you're coming by July 1st (that's THIS
     WEEK), as that is our cut-off date for notifying the hotel of
     our 'final' numbers.  If you register after that, we cannot
     guarantee you a room or a meal ticket.  If necessary, send
     crashmail to 1:1/90@FidoNet.

     Chris Irwin has announced a gigantic give-away at FidoCon!  One
     of the prizes at the conference will be a D'Bridge license for
     each member of the lucky winner's net!

     Rumor has it that not only US Robotics will be participating,
     but modem manufacturers Telebit, Unicom, and MicroCom may also
     be there!  Stay tuned for further details.

     Zone 1 Coordinator George Peace will be attending and he's
     invited the other amateur networks to participate in a "network
     summit".  Details will follow as they become available.

     One of the things that's truly amazing about this conference is
     the fact that people are coming all the way from Europe, Canada,
     and Australia just to attend.  This sort of thing makes all the
     work and effort putting on the conference worthwhile.

     Chris Bahr of PC-MAGnet will be making an appearance.

     We are in the process of mailing out the Conference packets to
     all registered attendees.  It contains directions to the hotel,
     a map of the area, and a tenative seminar schedule.

     For our adventurous attendees, we have added an optional trip to
     Six Flag's Great Adventure theme park in Jackson, NJ for $30/person.

     And now for the BIG announcement!  For a grand prize, we will be
     giving away a "Sysop's Dream" computer system complete with a multi-
     line Continuous mail TBBS/TIMS bbs package (courtesy of eSoft).

     [Those who registered before 5/1 will be given 3 changes in the
     drawings, while those registering before 6/1 will be given 2. If
     you register before July 2nd, publication date of this FidoNews,
     you can also participate in our prize drawings.]

     Please use the updated registration form you'll find in this
     issue of Fidonews.  It's headed FIDOCON '90 REGISTRATION FORM.
     Also, please note that the prices listed only apply to those who
     pre-register using the appropriate form.  We regret a typo in
     last week's form, the spousal plan is $620, not $670.

     Every year thousands of children are sexually abused by adults.
     I want to do something about it.

     This summer, I am again participating in BRAKE THE CYCLE, a bike
     ride from San Jose, California to Washington D.C.  to raise
     support and funds for local and national treatment and training
     agencies that work with these abused children and their
     families.  We are calling the ride "Brake the Cycle", to
     illustrate our cause: breaking the cycle of child sexual abuse.

     Two years ago, "Brake the Cycle" 1988 raised over $30,000.00 for
     this cause.  We also delivered a statement signed by 15,000
     people such as yourself to our Representatives in Washington
     D.C.  with the message that our communities want child abuse
     stopped.  "Brake the Cycle" 1990 hopes to do the same, and with
     your help we can.

     If you would like to be a partner in my effort to take positive
     steps towards breaking the cycle of child sexual abuse, there
     are several ways you can participate.  First, sign the
     "Statement of Concern" that we are taking to Washington D.C.
     Second, make a pledge to the ride itself.  Donations are tax
     deductible, and 100% of the funds go directly to local and
     national treatment agencies.  Third, be a direct contributor to
     the ride expenses.  The other riders and I are donating our
     time, energy and personal funds to this project, and it would be
     a great benefit to have help with the expenses.  These
     contributions also are tax deductible.

     After you have had time to consider this opportunity, please
     fill out the form and return it to me at the address provided.

     Sincerely,
     /s/ Cathrine J.  Foote

     BRAKE THE CYCLE
     National Ride to Stop Child Sexual Abuse
     Project of Childsong Inc.
     =================================================================

                           STATEMENT OF CONCERN

     Yes, I want to help break the cycle of child sexual abuse.  Every
     family and every community needs to be aware of this problem and
     take steps to prevent it.

     Studies show that reports of child abuse in our county are
     increasing.  One girl in four and one boy in seven in the United
     States will be molested before his or her 18th birthday.

     Proper treatment needs to be made available to abused children and
     their families.  Public awareness can prevent this crime from being
     committed.  I gladly add my name to this statement of concern
     urging the institution and people of the United States to provide
     these funds and the human resources necessary to stop child sexual
     abuse.

                   Is our Echo Mail Broken?
              And How long has it been this way?


      I think it almost goes with out saying that over 3/4 of the
      Network is bonded together by echos. So when there is a problem
      it is rather upsetting. After a while everybody starts to
      notice and wants to fix it or to see it fixed. *If* possible.

      This is NOT a political article. I do thouth like voting and
      believe it ought to be mandantory that Coordinators
      periodocally allow voting for the chair they hold. Not just
      when it suits thier fancy, but yearly. I also firmly believe
      there should be no Gods as System Operators OR Coordinators.
      And Thou being a coordinator be a thankless job when done right
      they have my extreme thanks. In fact when I think of it -- the
      Cooperative state - it is truely amazing. But the other side of
      the coin is -- that when done irresponsibly it can be a mess
      which almost seems to strecth to infinity. Who do i contact?
      Just how persistant should I get? What does it mean when I get
      no responces? What can i do? Who Cares?  I even, for awhile,
      thought about the worst ..Mebbe I will get my link cut for
      even talking about it.  Etc...


      I live in Region 18. I am very fortunate because I have two
      Echo sources. So if something is broke and i get no responce
      about getting it fixed, I can go get it from an alternative
      source in another Region. There are many here thou that are
      not as fortunate. This problem has been going on since at
      least a couple of years ago and I do wonder how widespread
      it is.

      I was told two years ago the DND echo was booming in Region 13
      yet not a message ever appeared in Region 18. That started me
      looking! Recently I switched feeds on the IFNA conference (one
      i wanted *before* the vote took place). it went immediately
      from 0 messages to as many as 20 messages a week. It was a bit
      late for getting involved so i turned it off. Another was
      RC_MODELS, The first day I changed feeds i recieved 1 message
      (from reading it I could tell it was a responce to another in
      the echo). Yet in Region 18 not a message filtered in. A Local
      SysOp I supply mail with wanted STARGAZE. Ok, I turn it on from
      my Region 18 source - weeks go by and not a single message. The
      SysOp asks me "what is going on, I read in the ELIST that
      traffic should be 10 messages a week minimum". I tell him post
      a "test" message. He posts, meanwhile the user who wanted it
      calls the Moderators board. The test message is there and even
      responces yet none make it back to Region 18!? An update is
      that the new feed has more messages but when the User calls
      the Moderators Board There is even MORE messages there and

      some of them Unseen. Why are echos like CAD-CAM called CAD_CAM
      in some Areas and Regions? We have the CHESS Echo Moderator
      right outside of our local calling area. My NEC tells me a very
      unusual story about the Echo Telemate which was not linked.
      Lately I have heard of a SysOp calling asking if he could read
      on the Moderators board. The SysOp then asked if he could pick
      up directly from the Moderator's System. They said messages are
      NOT making it to thier Region. Are we heading Back to "the Old
      Days" - Remember when folks called the Moderator and Picked up
      the Echo. Can YOU afford it! Why do we bother to have a Back-
      Bone if it isn't going to work?


      This has been plauging me. What can *I* do about it?? I thought
      of writing the EC ..mebbe the ZC  ...is there any guarentees it
      will be fixed ...or not keep happening again and again. How
      many other places does this happen and no one talks about it?
      How many Echos are broke?? Are links that sensitive? Is some
      one Lying? Is the Mail being Censored? I pick up LD and
      recently when my source asked folks who are picking up there
      for a donation, most of us chipped in a few bucks. Thou WE
      call Ld to pick up the echos... Hell, I even send some in!
      It bothers me that my Source does not respond to my NetMail.
      It bothers me even more that it happens to more than one echo.
      What causes this and what can be done about it? After all this
      Network is part of all of us. It is OUR Network(s). Aint see
      no reason than belonging other than to "share" the Mail!

      I know somebody is going to scream "We need more rules.." Any
      one with the sence of at least a rusty nail will know that
      this is obviously a bunch of %^&# and Rules and Regulations
      are NOT the answer! What is happening is the large echos which
      are very popular are linked but the small specialty echos are
      sorta haphazardly put together ...after all less SysOps would
      notice it and those that do can be easily ignored. ..Well
      think about it ...mebbe they ALL are Broken? how can we tell?
      I have seen local echos go straight to hell when echo
      distribution is done in a irresponsible manner. Just because
      someone has an Echo listed in thier Areas.BBS doesn't mean
      they are linked ..Even If they do have other Net/Nodes listed!!
      I had the pleasure of my Net Coordinator cutting me off with
      out even a word. There were actually two local Echos. Who's to
      say this hasn't happened somewhere on a Regional Level. Could
      it be that someone just cut a link and forgot about it.

      All this really didnt matter when echomail was first
      transmitted. But we do exspect everyone upstream to be honest
      about the links ...right?  Infact we depend on the integerity
      of the BackBone Echo Mail Systems and our fellow NetWork
      members. Mebbe it hasnt been working for a long time. Our
      Software can not tell if upstream is together! Take one echo
     FidoNews 7-27                Page 8                    2 Jul 1990


      for instance. Notes could be compared on the path and seenbys
      from different parts of the country but that is not to
      guarentee that there are at least a dozen broken links
      somewhere inbetween. Anybody got any ideas on a Utility which
      can help out? Our software is not really designed that way. I
      was talking to a friend in GT Net. Since Gt's Software is so
      much different things are done differently. He told me he can
      send sort of test message that reports routing status back to
      him. It is part of the EchoMail Software. ..Gawd, I wish I was
      a Software writer... This problem is part ALL of our problem!
      After all, What fun is it belonging to a NetWork who boasts
      sharing Free Information that doesn't get sent to active
      participants. Are we sewing the mouth shut on our guest
      speakers?

          The R&R Echo is an offshoot from the dBase and Clipper
     echos, where discussions concering the use of "Report Writer"
     software for dBase was building.  The R&R echo is dedicated to
     discussing the use and implimentation of report writing software
     used by many dBase/Foxbase/DBXL, etc., programmers.  This covers
     both commercial and shareware versions and can be of immence
     help to those using these programs.  The echo is open to any
     individual with interest in this type of software.

          The RA_UTIL Echo is dedicated to discussions concerning the
     many "external" programs being written for the Remote Access BBS
     software package.  The participants include many of the authors
     of such programs and the discussions range from "problem solving"
     to what is coming in the future.  The echo is open to anyone who
     has interest in the external programs written for Remote Access
     and "authors" wishing to discuss and support their programs.

     Donn Bly (1:236/7)
     Region 11 RC Election Coordinator

     Region 11 has elected a new RC.  A few weeks ago we posted the
     election rules here, and now we are posting the final results.

     Region 11 RC Election Report
     ----------------------------

     The following is the final tabulation of all votes received by me
     as of the close of the polls on June 30, 1990 at 18:00 EST.  To
     the best of my knowledge these results are accurate and complete.

     If there is a question about the validity of vote, please get in
     touch with me IMMEDIATELY via netmail or voice call.  My home
     voice number is (219) 925-3474.

     If you voted, and your password is not listed under the candidate
     for which you voted, or your node number is not listed below,
     please contact me IMMEDIATELY.

     So that I did not have to return as many ballots, I relaxed the
     rules slightly -- the outcome of the election is not effected.  I
     decided to allow for codewords up to 9 characters instead of 8,
     and I allowed non-alphanumeric characters as well as
     alphanumeric. I also received a request to allow both upper and
     lower case, so when I rewrote the software for the non-
     alphanumerics I made allowances for that too.

     As the documentation below shows, the winner of the RC11 Election
     is Mark Lynch.

     The first salvo of voting achieved the following results:

     Candidates                   Number Of Votes
     --------------------------   ---------------
     Mark Lynch                      58 (39.5%)
     George Kasica                   27 (18.4%)
     Ed Almasy                       25 (17.0%)
     Bill Huther                     23 (15.6%)
     Martin Essenburg                14 ( 9.5%)

     Because no one candidate received a majority of the votes, a run-
     off election was held between the two candidates that received
     the most votes.  The full results of the run-off election are as
     follows:

     Candidates                   Number Of Votes
     --------------------------   ---------------
     Mark Lynch                     109 (72.7%)
     George Kasica                   41 (27.3%)

     The full results of the first vote should be available from your
     NC (if you are in Region 11), and were posted in the REGION11
     conference, just as these results will.

     As mentioned in the original rules that I posted, a period for
     commenting on the election process has been opened.  I have not
     decided how long it will remain open as I have no idea how many
     people have suggestions and how long it will take.  If you do
     have any comment, suggestions, etc. I will gratefully accept any
     netmail on the subject at 1:236/7.  If there are enough people
     interested in it, an echo may be started to handle the traffic.

     I wish to take this opportunity to thank all who were involved in
     this process:  Steve Bonine for commissioning it as one of his
     final acts as ZC, John Summers for being RC until he had to move
     out of the Region, Rick Moore for acting as interim RC until this
     vote was completed, the candidates who stepped forward and
     offered their services to an often-unthankful network, and George
     Peace, our ZC, who has said that he will accept the results of
     this election as final and appoint the winner to the RC11
     position.

                   The Labor and Union News Conference
                   -----------------------------------

     "The average weekly wage in 1979 was $189.32.  In 1988,
     compensating for inflation, it was $168.10, a fall of
     11.2 percent."  --  Quote from journalist David Bacon

        I pulled that out of my quotes file because I thought it
     would be a good introduction to this article.  It's a truly
     startling statistic because we all sadly know that grocery
     prices haven't dropped 11.2 percent after inflation!

        Over the same time period quoted above, we've seen a
     definite drop in union membership in this country.  There are
     many reasons for this, the changing economy and labor force
     for one, but one of the biggest reasons has been the corporate
     offensive against organized labor launched in the Reagan years
     and now continuing under the Bush administration.

        We've seen company after company launch efforts to bust
     their unions and to shift health care costs onto workers
     causing many of the strikes that get reported in the
     corporate-owned mass media.

        While workers still have the right to strike, the companies
     now force strikes, like the current Greyhound strike that is
     going on now, in order to replace strikers with permanent
     replacement workers -- better known as scabs.  Of course it's
     still illegal to fire striking workers, but it's not illegal to
     permanently replace strikers with scabs.  Nice little catch-22
     there, huh?

        And all this effects far more than unionized workers.  It
     effects our entire economy and, in particular, all working
     people.  In any given profession, unionized workers tend to
     be better paid than non-unionized workers.  If the unions
     are suffering and are being forced to take wage and benefit
     cuts, then eventually all workers will be in the same boat.

        What's the above paragraphs leading up to?  I'm glad you
     asked.

        I'd like to inform you of an echomail conference devoted
     to working-class issues.  The conference focuses on labor and
     union news -- things you normally wouldn't hear about in our
     normal corporate-owned mass media.  The daily newspaper always
     has a large "business" section devoted to that tiny percentage
     of people who own enough stock in a company to effect the
     company's operation, but it never has a "labor" section
     devoted to the vast majority of people in this country -- the
     working class.

     FidoNews 7-27                Page 14                   2 Jul 1990


        The conference's area name is, appropriately enough,
     LABOR_CONFERENCE, and it currently is not distributed on the
     echomail backbone.  It has its own distribution system (if you
     could really call it a "system").

        The conference's moderator is William Bowles at 1:107/607
     and Bill can let you know where to find a link into the echo.

        The echo consists mainly of news items from various sources
     and has a little conversation.  The news tends to be very
     interesting and informative and comes from such sources as
     union newsletters, and other labor-oriented writers.  Hopefully
     we'll increase the conversation end of the echo with more
     links and with more participating systems.

        Solidarity forever and have a good day.

        Hope to see you in the LABOR_CONFERENCE echo!

              MLM (MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING) ECHO AVAILABILITY

     A few weeks ago I wrote up an article for FidoNews describing
     the MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) Echo.  This conference has been
     picking up a bit lately, but I still occasionally hear from
     folks who are having difficulty finding links to it.

     An inspection of messages entered in the last week or so
     reveals the following net/nodes listed in the PATH lines:

     102/2 102/803 103/501 124/3207 124/3220 124/4115 13/13 157/200
     236/13 236/7 238/101 265/7 270/101 270/116 343/11 343/300

     It's quite possible that more nodes may be carrying the
     conference, but no messages have been entered from those nodes
     so they do not appear in the PATH lines.  The conference SHOULD
     be available from any backbone feed, since it is carried on the
     Eastern Star.  If you absolutely cannot get a feed through your
     regional backbone node, you may wish to see if you can get a
     feed from one of the nodes listed above (but PLEASE check with
     your Regional Echomail Coordinator first, so that "dupe loops"
     can be avoided!).

     If you (or any of your users) are involved in Multi-Level
     Marketing, or if you have an interest in the topic, you are
     invited to link in.  As far as I am aware, there are no links
     to nodes outside of Zone 1 at present, although I did receive
     one request from a sysop in Australia (Kurt Johannessen at
     3:713/610) who wanted the echo via a HST feed.  If anyone who
     has an HST (and who is familiar with the requirements for
     sending an echo to another Zone) can provide a feed, your help
     would be appreciated (please send netmail to Kurt directly).

     For those who missed the original announcement, I will just
     repeat a couple of paragraphs from it:  We have started a new
     echo called MLM, the echo for those involved or interested in
     Multi-Level Marketing (sometimes also known as "network
     marketing").  For those of you who are not familiar with the
     phrase "Multi-Level Marketing", this is the method by which a
     large number of products and services are sold nowadays.  Some
     of the better-known firms in this field are Amway (home care
     and other products), and A.J. Williams (insurance), but there
     are literally hundreds of firms that utilize this method of
     marketing their products.

     We expect that those who participate in the MLM echo will agree
     that Multi-Level Marketing is a valid and responsible method of
     marketing products.  HOWEVER, we also recognize that there are
     irresponsible people who try to use MLM as a "cover" for
     illegal pyramid schemes, but that does not detract from the
     fact that MLM itself is a very valid method of selling products
     or services direct to the customer, that has been utilized for
     years.  Those who disagree, or who feel that _all_ MLM activity
     FidoNews 7-27                Page 16                   2 Jul 1990


     is a scam of some type, should not be participating in this
     echo.

     Everyone else is welcome and if your are interested in the
     topic, please link in to the MLM conference!

     Incest Survivors Newsletter

     By:  John Casselli
          Managing Editor, SIPIS Newsletter
          Assistant Sysop
          Vietnam Veterans Valhalla BBS
          1:143/27  300/1200/9600 HST
          (408) 298-2740

     I am writing to announce a couple of important events which I am
     quite proud of.  As a member of Parents United, Inc.  (PU), and
     AMACU (Adults Molested as Children, Inc), a component of PU, in
     San Jose, California, I have become quite involved in trying to
     break the cycle of child sexual abuse in this country.  The
     statistics are astounding.  This disease is in a rampage and has
     struck nearly every, if not all, families in this country.  I am
     convinced that public awareness - education - is the key to
     breaking this cycle.  It CAN prevent this crime from being
     committed.  To this end, I have created and am now proud to
     announce the first issue of SIPIS (Singleness in Purpose -
     Incest Survivors), named after a SIP echo conference if the same
     name (I hope they don't mind stealing their name but it gets the
     point across in a no-nonsense fashion).

     SIPIS is a newsletter written *by*, *about* and *for* incest
     survivors and others who are interested in trying to do
     something to prevent this from happening to other children.  One
     in four girls and one in seven boys will be molested before they
     reach the age of eighteen in this country alone, and that is
     intolerable.  Only *you* can make a difference by making your
     feelings known, and getting involved.  SIPIS is file requestable
     (HST 14.4) from 1:143/27 at (408) 298-2740 anytime but NMH under
     the magic filename SIPIS.

     I am also looking for people who want to become part of this
     *first* electronically compiled and distributed newsletter on
     the subject of child sexual abuse.  You can help in several
     ways.  First, by participating in the SIP_INCEST echo
     conference, also available from the Vietnam Veterans Valhalla if
     you cannot find it locally.  Second, by contributing articles

     this vitally important newsletter is up to those of you who
     care.  To give you an idea of what the market for such a
     publication is, the Vietnam Veterans Valhalla was *inundated*
     with requests for the first newsletter during the first week
     after it's release.  There were 327 File requests, and another

                      VIETNAM VETERANS' VALHALLA

                          BBS (408) 298-2740

     "In the jungles of 'Nam, some of us were scared and wary, but we
      pulled one another along and were able to depend on each other.
                         That has never changed.
     Today, free of the criticisms and misunderstandings many veterans
       have endured, the Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla is a ray of hope,
        and a reminder that the lessons learned at such a high price
             shall not be forgotten, nor the errors repeated!!!"


     The Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla bulletin board started back when
     "Fido" was the only BBS software available for hobbyists and the
     like.  Since that time over 40,000 calls have been made to our
     system which indicates to us that there is an expansive need for
     such a service as we provide.   The Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla is
     back online again after being down for a year.   We have a new
     computer and a HST 14.4 modem from USR to make long distance
     calling a little less painful.

     When the Valhalla started back in early 1986, the only other
     veteran-related conferencing service was through CompuServe.
     Since then veteran-related BBS systems have sprung up all over
     the world and we help each other to grow through a kind of
     unofficial "VetNet".  For a complete list of BBS systems
     comprising the VetNet, simply file request the magic filename
     VETNET from the Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla, 1:143/27.

     Also through this VetNet we disseminate what has become one of
     the most popular backbone echo's available, the International
     Vietnam Veterans EchoConference (IVVEC), titled VIETNAM_VETS.
     Although the conference originated here at the Vietnam Veterans'
     Valhalla, it is Co-moderated by G. Joseph Peck, President of
     Berkshire Vet Center in Pittsfield, MA, who also sysops VETLink
     #1, 1:321/203, (413-443-6313, 300/1200/2400/9600 bauds).

     Together, Joe Peck and I created and manage a monthly publication
     dedicated to Vietnam Veterans called the "NAM VET Newsletter".
     During my absence, Joe and others have built the NAM VET into the
     pillar of information it is today.   The NAM VET has grown from a
     tiny newsletter into a 100 page per month publication of vital
     importance to Vietnam veterans and non-veterans alike.  Topics of
     interest addressed in each issue, and their section editors are:

     The NAM VET Newsletter is available through file request at any
     of the BBS systems listed above using the magic filename NAMVET.
     (At least I think that they all use that magic filename, if not,
     please excuse my error, I did *not* check with them first.  Best
     to request FILES from their systems first to get a list of
     available files.  I believe the International Vietnam Veterans'
     EchoConference (IVVEC) is available for viewing at all of these
     systems as well.

     The Vietnam Veterans' Valhalla also has a collection of veteran-
     related text files for you to read.  Just file request the magic
     filename FILES to get a complete list of those files which are
     available on this system.

     The Valhalla has taken on a different perspective this year from
     when you might last have been on that system.  It has expanded
     the scope of its services to include overall RECOVERY, and hosts
     a wide variety of such topic-related echo conferences and files.

     I certainly hope to be "seeing" you at the Vietnam Veterans'
     Valhalla soon.  And please be sure to leave me a note when you
     stop by.

     FidoCon '91 -- The New Beginning
     Zone 1 Region Coordinators
     Zone 1 Zone Coordinator

     The Region Coordinators of FidoNet Zone 1 continue to respect the
     results of the "IFNA dissolution referendum".

     We also  respect Tom  Jennings' revocation of IFNA's right to use
     trademarks and logos registered to Fido Software (FidoNet and the
     Fido  logo).   Tom  Jennings   has  granted  the  Zone  1  Region
     Coordinators  the  right  of  continued  use  of  the  Registered
     Trademarks.

     The vote  to dissolve  IFNA  as  well  as  the  [IFNA]  trademark
     revocation make  the 1990  Zone 1  FidoCon  event  the  last  one
     possible by  authority of  IFNA. But  FidoCon, a  celebration  of
     FidoNet History and Tradition, will continue.

     The FidoNet Zone 1 Region Coordinators (RCs) invite you to submit
     proposals to  sponsor and  host the  Zone 1 FidoCon '91, "The New
     Beginning". Please  submit your individual or Net proposal to any
     Zone 1 RC before July 18. A committee of Zone 1 RCs will select a
     primary and  backup site from proposals submitted. Please contact
     any Zone 1 RC for information and assistance with your proposal.

     Each year, several excellent proposals are eliminated through the
     selection process. 1990 was no exception. Those dormant proposals
     are some  of the  ones we  hope you will resubmit for 1991. Let's
     not let all that good effort be wasted. We're asking you to "show
     us what you've got" so we can evaluate a variety of completed and
     in-progress proposals  and make  a selection  without  geographic
     bias.

     The primary  and backup  sites of  the Zone 1 FidoCon '91 will be
     announced in FidoNews on Monday, July 30, 1990.

     Start thinking about your FidoCon '92 proposal. It's not that far
     off.

     The Big Demo --

     One of the large Long Distance phone companies is coming in for
     a demo of two big switches, which I have a small part in.  One
     system is a 45 megabit digital switch, bandwidth suitable for
     video switching.  Now why does that interest them ?  Running on
     a little laptop buried in a cabinet somewhere is a program I
     wrote which commands the switch routing processor to route the
     video signals differently.  For the demo, it changes the
     routing between a camera, a VCR, a CD player and a test pattern
     generator to eight TV monitors.

     The other system is a 1.54 megabit digital switch, bandwidth
     suitable for voice channel switching.  Carried on the channel
     is 4 kilobits of statistical data, which is gathered by my
     programs on PC and displayed in fancy colors on the screen.
     The significant part is that these two systems are standing
     side by side, and customer came in to see both.

     The business of long distance ( read nonlocal ) carriers will
     change depending upon the restrictions placed on your local
     carrier in terms of "who can transport what".  What we are
     looking at is the ability to 'dial' into any video source,
     similar to the way we dial into voice and data sources.


     Buried Cable --

     The phone companies are going to take over the cable TV
     operations in this country and I'll tell you why.  A review of
     the history of these natural monopolies would have to start
     with the baby boom of the '60s.

     All these young'uns have finally gotten their houses built and
     the housing market is starting to fall off, simply because
     there are fewer buyers out there.  I can see no possibility of
     this trend changing for at least 20 years, probably more like
     30.  This falloff leaves the phone companies with little room
     for expansion, so they have to look elsewhere for new business.

     The phone company expansion that did occur was in the areas of
     buried cable and local switching equipment.  They were quite
     peeved to see the cable TV companies burying their cable along
     the same lines.  Cable TV has quite a way to go before they
     have saturated the market.  Everyone has a phone, only about
     17% of households have cable TV connections.  Add to this the
     fact that phone companies have buried twisted pair, and cable
     TV companies have buried coax.
     FidoNews 7-27                Page 26                   2 Jul 1990


     Now we have optical fiber.  No one disputes it's superiority
     over copper.  The dispute is over who gets to bury the optical
     fiber cable in your back yard.  When you finally do get fiber,
     you have all the bandwidth you need on the one cable for both
     phone, data ( ISDN style ), television and anything else you
     can think of.  And you will only need ONE fiber.  Even if 20
     years from now, something better comes along, YOU will not
     need any extra bandwidth.

     In exchange for the privilege of being your only
     communications company, you extract certain restrictions from a
     natural monopoly.  You get to force reduced profits and specify
     minimum levels of service. ( Sounds a lot like echomail, doesn't
     it ? )

     Who's going to win the opportunity to dig up your yard ( again
     ) ?  I believe it will be the phone companies, because they
     have the better administrative systems and more financial
     resources.  They are waging this battle in congress right now.

     Our systems will become the terminals of a worldwide network
     which carries all communications traffic.  The regional
     carriers will provide the administrative services and local
     routing.  The long distance carriers will provide the backbone
     services.  Network television will operate similar to the 1-800
     toll free number.  Pay channels on your TV will be billed the
     same as pay phone calls.  This trend will become worldwide.

                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================

     Well,   Vince,   you asked for opinions  concerning  the  subject
     article.  I have heard a lot of complaints about lack of interest
     in network issues, so I will respond.

     When I first scanned issue 7.23  of FidoNews, I  skipped over the
     High Mesa Publishing (HMP)  article without a thought.  I  am not
     very  sensitive  to  the no solicitations  clause  in  Policy  4.
     Therefore,  I never thought about the article.  After reading Jim
     Dailey's letter, and your response, I decided to reread and think
     about the text.

     Publication of solicitious material is a two-edged sword.  On one
     hand, it alerts possible consumers (many of us in FidoNet will be
     interested)   to  the product.   On the other hand,   it  sets  a
     precedent  for further solicitations.   I  would not like to  see
     FidoNews become a weekly trading paper similar to those available
     locally.

     From the first perspective,  I  see nothing offensive in the  HMP
     article.   The material is clearly of interest to FidoNet  sysops
     and users.   In fact,  there may be many FidoNet participants who
     will  provide text for inclusion in the diskazine and  disk-based
     books.  I think this is a good use for FidoNews.

     From the second point of view, how will you determine whether the
     next  solicitation  is appropriate for publication?   As  I  said
     before,  FidoNews is not a weekly trader's paper.   I  doubt that
     any of us want it to become one, too.

     One   possible  solution  is  to  charge  for  advertising   from
     commercial ventures.  If the submission requirements and fees are
     set  appropriately,  then inclusion of commercial  advertisements
     would  pay for distribution of FidoNews.   Of course,  I  have no
     idea how you would distribute any money received.

     To summarize,  this is a thin line to walk.  I  would like to see
     similar material, because I am interested in such things.  If you
     can control this,  everything will be fine.   Furthermore,   this
     case is very clear.   If the next one is similar, then you should
     publish it as well.   However,  what will you do when an  article
     appears  which  treats  a  subject not so  obviously  of  general
     interest?  I would not like to see advertisements for deodorant!
