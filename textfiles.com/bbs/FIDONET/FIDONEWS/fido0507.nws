        Aaron Priven
        Fidonet (1:125/1154)

                       Automatic Routing of Gateways

        This was originally a message to Doug Thompson that I just
     kept writing and writing and writing.... eventually i realized
     it might be better as an article than as a message. So here it
     is.

        (In this article, "nets" are Fidonet Networks, that is,
     Fidonet routing units like 125 and 109. "Networks" are separate
     entities like Usenet and Bitnet. Also, all examples are from
     Zone 1, and many the San Francisco Bay Area in particular; this
     is only because I'm familiar with it. Please, no national
     centrism is implied! -- I just don't know very much about the
     setup of Europe or Oceania in Fidonet.)

        After thinking it over, these are my ideas to implement
     gateways from Fidonet to other networks, as far as Fidonet is
     concerned.

        Basically, what I want to do is this: just as the Echo
     Backbone has special node numbers, and so has the Software
     Backbone, gateways to other nets would also have special node
     numbers. These numbers would be derived from an assigned
     "network" number plus another number indicating the geographical
     unit that a to/from node was in.

        The question is: why put special numbers in the nodelist?
     They're *other* networks, aren't they? Can't they just do it for
     themselves? The answer to that is complex. Communication *is*
     any network; without communication, there literally is no
     network. Increasing communication, by adding people to the list
     with whom you can communicate, will only widen and improve the
     basis of what the conversations end up being. It should be a
     primary goal of any network to improve communications. As such,
     while gateways with other networks may not seem likely to better
     any one particular network, by "giving away" the information
     that that network has, in reality both networks, all gatewayed
     networks, improve by the gatewaying.

        The reason for the numbers being derived, rather than being
     selected at random, is twofold. First of all, it's aesthetic; I
     like numbers that work out that way. Second of all, like net
     routing to the "xxx/0" node, it allows for automatic routing to
     that gateway. You simply send to "Usenet", and the computer
     knows where that is.

        There are many ways to assign automatic numbers. One may do
     it by net and region, either requiring that the net or region
     FidoNews 5-07                Page 2                   15 Feb 1988


     set aside a particular number for gateways (anything/999 will
     always be the local Usenet gateway, for example) or by having
     the NC or RC act as an outbound host for gatewayed mail (just
     so far as the gateway). The problem with this is getting every
     NC in Fidonet to do any one thing; I imagine it's hard enough
     just getting Donald Dodell, Henk Wevers, and Bill Bolton to
     agree. I believe it must be done netwide, and thus via the
     nodelist.

        For example, it would be perfectly possible to have one
     gateway per region with this formula:

     <zone>/<two-digit_network><two-digit_region>

        So if Usenet were assigned a gateway number of 50, the Usenet
     gateway for Zone 1 Region 10 would be 1/5010. The problem here
     is that Region 10, and most other regions, are really too big to
     only have one Usenet gateway. Should someone in Quebec call a
     Usenet gateway in Indiana when might be available right there in
     Quebec? I really don't think so.

        Therefore, the units have to be smaller. To my mind, the
     obvious conclusion is to do it by net. (Independent nodes, of
     course, would continue to do it by region.) It could be done
     smaller than that, but most of the time if nets are split, then
     the split is small enough that it can be plugged in manually.

        The next step, then, is to use this formula:

     <zone>/<one-digit_network><three-digit_region>

     So, if Usenet were assigned the gateway number of 7, the Usenet
     gateway for Zone 1 Region 10 would be 1/7010, and the Usenet
     gateway for net 161 would be 1/7161.

        There are quite a few problems here. First of all, it assumes
     that we'll never have more than nine networks. I don't know if
     any networks besides Usenet would even consider a gateway (I'll
     discuss Alternet later); perhaps there will be only one. It is
     possible that Bitnet or ARPAnet will offer us gateways. Or,
     perhaps other incompatible microcomputer networks -- the GT-
     Powercomm network and PunterNet come to mind -- will one day
     have gateways. It very possible that someday we may reach nine
     or ten gateways.

        Furthermore, even if there were only one or two gateways, it
     is still taking away a tremendous number of Zone 1 special
     nodes. (I mean by that not that it will take the actual numbers,
     but it will take up all ten-thousand of the 7000 numbers even if
     there are only a few gateways.) Right now, Zone 1 special nodes
     are used in four ways: the software backbone, the echomail
     backbone, Fidonet compatible software help nodes, and various
     IFNA and Fidonet offices (the IC, the ZoneGates, and also
     positions like the FTSC chair and the IFNA membership chairman).
     Yet they have not lived up to their potential. They do not list
     help nodes for many products that could use them, including
     FidoNews 5-07                Page 3                   15 Feb 1988


     SEAdog (except in Oceania!), Confmail and the rest of Bob
     Hartman's software, US Robotics and Telebit, and many other
     products. (This is not a complaint, I'm only pointing-out a
     possibility.) They do not list the members, or even the chairmen
     of the various IFNA committees. They do not include even all the
     members of the IFNA Board of Directors! (Is it any wonder that
     we have to ask who they are?) When the Zone 1 special nodes are
     used to the extent that they could and should be, there will be
     much less room for manipulation.

        It seems, therefore, that we've run out of options. We just
     can't use Zone 1 (or Zone 2 or Zone 3) special nodes because
     there simply aren't enough. I think the only reasonable solution
     left is to grant special units to gateways to other networks.

        Thus, which units should we use? I've already shown that
     single-digit numbers, and thus zones, are not feasible. I think
     the ideal solution would be to use special net numbers for
     gateways, for several reasons. First of all, these special nets
     would be directly under the zone and not in a separate region,
     thus listing the gateway nodes right under the 1/x special
     nodes. Second, there are a lot of network numbers available;
     only 100 are currently used in Zone 1, and since there is
     already a precedent for not having nets assigned exactly in
     numerical sequence (unlike, say, 1/x nodes, where all 1/2xx
     nodes are Echomail Backbone hubs, and all 1/3xx nodes are
     Software Backbone hubs) there is little reason why all of them
     couldn't be used. The problem with using nets is, however,
     clear: all messages to nets are routed via the network host.
     That is what nets are for, of course, but for situations like
     this it's simply not the right thing to do. We'll have to use
     regions, which do not route.

        There are several drawbacks to using regions, but they simply
     cannot be helped. The first one is that regions have been
     assigned starting from 10, and thus will not be listed right
     after the 1/x nodes; it sounds unimportant but it does ruin the
     continuity of the nodelist. Second of all, direct representation
     of one region per gateway would place a large overhead on the
     region numbers, and ignores the good use that can be made of the
     fourth digit in each node number.

        I would suggest that other networks be given gateway numbers
     of two digits, and the following formulae be used: for the
     region number,

     9 + <tens_digit_gateway_number>

     and for the node number,

     <units_digit_gateway_number> + <geographic_unit_involved>.

     If Usenet were given a gateway number of 11, then the Usenet
     gateway for Region 10 independents would be 91/1010. If Bitnet
     were given 0, then the Bitnet gateway for Net 125 would be
     90/125. (It is perfectly possible with this scheme to have a
     FidoNews 5-07                Page 4                   15 Feb 1988


     gateway number of 0 or of 10; you simply leave out the first
     digit in the node number). This is really very simple.

        I would suggest that gateway numbers be assigned first not
     with 0 or 1, but with 89, and go backwards. (This would make
     Region 10's gateway 98/9010, and so forth.) This would ensure
     that Region 99 is still available in the event another special
     region is needed, and that Regions 90 through probably 96 would
     be available for regular or special use.

        It is true that these numbers would take away some of the
     possibilities of new regions. Nevertheless, at this writing
     there are only 16 regions in Zone 2, and less in each of the
     other zones. While regions will no doubt continue to be added in
     Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and it is likely that
     at some future time some regions elsewhere will be added or
     split, it is also likely that at such a time as that many
     regions are needed, a new zone will be needed as well --
     doubling the number of possible regions.

        (These 90-99 numbers could well be used for other things
     besides gateways. It would be possible to use special region
     numbers for other special functions we may develop in the
     future, should we need new region numbers.)

        The way the messages would be routed is as follows. First,
     the re-routing program will look in its configuration file for a
     manual setting of the gateway node. (This is in case one has
     more than one gateway per net.) Then, the person looks for the
     node matching the gateway number and the net. For example, Net
     125 nodes would look for 98/9125 if the gateway number were 89.
     If there was no node 98/9125, then it would look for 98/9010,
     since Net 125 is in Region 10. If there were no 98/9010, it
     would look for 98/9000. Numbers like 98/0001 and 98/0005 are
     administrative numbers, indicating the persons in charge of
     running the gateways (this might not be used, but more likely
     would be those in charge of keeping the standards for gateway
     software).

                                 *   *   *

        I haven't discussed Alternet in the my article, although the
     thoughts leading up to this article did include them. I don't
     think it's much of a secret that I dislike Alternet because it
     hurts communication; it necessitates things like special
     gateways and funny 9x/xxxx numbers; barriers to communication,
     which is exactly what in an ideal situation we do NOT need in a
     communications network! (I like that word, communication.)
     Nevertheless, in an apolitical spirit, I have to admit that
     Alternet (despite its origin) is indeed a separate network than
     Fidonet and (so long as there are enough nodes in Alternet to
     justify it) should be treated in the Fido nodelist the same way
     as any other network.

        That includes, however, the inconvenience of being another
     network. If they want to be included in the Fido nodelist, then
     FidoNews 5-07                Page 5                   15 Feb 1988


     they must be part of Fidonet. Fido's Zone 4 will be used for
     Latin America, Asia, or Africa, not for any special-interest
     group; what's best for the organization of Fidonet is clear
     organizational lines, and that would be completely destroyed by
     the actual granting of a zone to Alternet and the inclusion of
     Alternet in the Fido nodelist. The difference between actual
     inclusion and the granting of gateways is clear: special
     treatment. Alternet should be given no special treatment
     whatsoever.

     From: Gene Coppola
     Quick BBS Help Node 1/114

        Quick BBS  by itself  is one heck of a program. Adding Binkley
     as the mail processor  or front  end if  you will,  turns a great
     program into  a super program. While this article is designed for
     the Quick BBS sysop,  anyone  who  desires  to  use  Binkley will
     profit from reading this.

        The topics  covered are  the ones I receive the most questions
     about on the Quick BBS Help Node.

        The first question people ask is how do I get Quick BBS to run
     under Binkley?  There are several ways to doit, but the one I use
     and find most applicable is the  EXIT method.  This frees  up the
     most RAM  and allows  me to  run almost  any RBBS or PcBoard door
     from Quick BBS.

        You have to add the following line to your binkley.cfg file to
     start this process:

        BBS EXIT

        This tells  Binkley to  exit when  a human  caller is detected
     with the Errorlevel set to the callers Baud  Rate divided  by 10.
     An  example  would  be  if  a  caller  comes in at 2400 baud then
     Binkley will exit with the Errorlevel  set  to  24,  ready  to be
     trapped by the batch file used to run Binkley.

        Now in  the batch file you use to run Binkley you will need to
     add the following statements to  trap  the  Errorlevel  and start
     QuickBBS when a human calls.

        If ErrorLevel  24 Goto Baud2400
        If ErrorLevel  12 Goto Baud1200
        If ErrorLevel   3 Goto Baud300

        Those three  lines will  trap 2400,  1200 and 300 baud callers
     and send them to the appropriate routine in  the batch  file. The
     three routines these lines call are listed below.

        :Baud2400              ; Procedure Name
        C:                     ; Change To Drive C
        Cd\AAAAAAAA            ; Change To Quick BBS Sub
        QuickBBS -b2400 -E0    ; Call Quick BBS Pass Baud
        Goto AfterQuick

        :Baud1200
        C:
        Cd\AAAAAAAA
        QuickBBS -B1200 -E0
        Goto AfterQuick

        :Baud300
        C:
        Cd\AAAAAAAA
     FidoNews 5-07                Page 7                   15 Feb 1988


        QuickBBS -B300 -E0
        Goto Start

        You might  notice that  in the  Baud2400 and Baud1200 routines
     the last command is  Goto AfterQuick  and in  the Baud300 routine
     the last command is Goto Start.

        This is because I do not accept 300 Baud callers on my system,
     so once QuickBBS has informed the caller of this and  logged them
     off,  I  do  not  have  to worry about processing any messages or
     netmail and can go right back to start Binkley up again.

        Okay so now Binkley  can  answer  the  phone,  detect  a human
     caller and  pass control to Quick BBS. Once the caller has logged
     off, my  batch file  goes the  routine named  AfterQuick which is
     listed below.

        :AfterQuick   ; Procedure Name
        C:            ; Make Sure I Am On C Drive
        cd \AAAAAAAA  ; Change To Quick BBS Sub Directory
        echoscan      ; Move EchoMail To Message Area
        mailscan      ; Move NetMail To Message Area
        D:            ; Change Back To Drive D
        cd \BINK      ; Change To Binkley Sub Directory
        Goto Bundle   ; Goto Message Processing Routine

        Okay, so  what is  Bundle? How  does Binkley  or Quick BBS now
     process the mail? Well, it took  me quite  a while  to completely
     understand this  with help from experts such as Bob Hartman, Rick
     Siegel, Doug Boone, Baba  Buhler, Mike  Janke, and  many more, to
     whom I say THANK YOU!

        OMMM  is  the  program  that  processes  the messages and sets
     things rolling for delivery.  What  I  could  not  grasp  was the
     UNIQUE things  that OMMM  allows you  to do. Just like most other
     Sysops, I was used to the  three tiered  mail schedule  we use in
     Net 107. Basically, it works like this.

        From  one  hour  before  National Mail to one-half hour before
     National Mail,  we  send  all  outgoing  mail  (non-echo)  to our
     local Hubs.

        From one half hour before NMH to NMH our Hubs send the mail to
     our Outbound gateway.

        During NMH each  node  is  responsible  to  send  EchoMail and
     messages with Attaches directly to the destination.

        From NMH  to one  half hour after NMH we send and receive from
     nodes in Net 107, while the Igate processes the mail and sends it
     to the Hubs.

        From one  half hour  after NMH to one hour after NMH the nodes
     are usually quite, waiting to receive mail from their Hubs.

        Even though I ran SEAdog as a front end, I never thought about

     processing mail any way other than above.

        Now with Binkley as my front end, mail processing has changed.
     Since my Hub accepts CM and mail outside  of National  Mail Hour,
     Binkley and  OMMM make  it very easy for me to send outbound mail
     to my Hub during the day. The Hub is a LOCAL call, so it does not
     cost anything to make the call during the day.

        So in my Day Time Schedule in OMMM.CTL (Schedule D) I send all
     non-echo outbound mail to my Hub.  Since there  are several nodes
     in  the  local  area,  I  send  any  mail  to  them directly thus
     lightening the load on my Hub somewhat.

        I also HOLD echomail for several Sysops who desire to Poll me,
     so I  have HOLD statements in this schedule as well. Here is what
     my OMMM.CTL looks like.

     SCHED D

        UNHOLD ALL          ; Remove Hold From All Packets

        ONEHOLD 129/34      ; -+
        ONEHOLD 135/68      ;  |
        ONEHOLD 104/24      ;   +-->  Hold For  People Who  Poll Me
        ONEHOLD 170/211     ;  |
        ONEHOLD 135/4       ; -+

        ONECM 107/211   ; -+
        ONECM 107/233   ; \ - ARC And Send Direct
        ONECM 107/238   ; / - Bypassing Hub
        ONECM 107/269   ; -+


        ROUTE 107/200 107/ALL ; Route All Remaining 107 Mail
                              ; To My Hub.

        (Author's Note: It might not be the best but it works!)

        Here  is  what  the  schedule  event looks like in the Binkley
     configuration file.

     Event All   06:00 23:59 L C B   E1=10 E2=30 E3=50 A=180
     Event All   00:00 02:59 L C B   E1=10 E2=30 E3=50 A=180

        Okay, now my day time mail is being  handled. Note  that there
     are  2  events  above.  This  is because Binkley cannot handle an
     event that crosses the midnight hour. So one  event is  from 6:00
     am to 11:59 pm and the next is from midnight until 2:59 am.

        The three  flags I  have set are L which enables local mail, C
     for Crash Mail and B which allows BBS access.

        E1 is set to Errorlevel 10, which sets  the SCHED  variable to
     SCHED D. When the event starts it goes to SCHED D in OMMM.CTL and
     processes the mail as above.

     FidoNews 5-07                Page 9                   15 Feb 1988


        From 3:00 am to  3:59  am  I  poll  various  nodes  to  get my
     echomail.

        From 04:00 to 05:00 (NMH) I use SCHED M which is show below.

     SCHED M

         UNHOLD ALL       ; Removes Holds From All Packets

         ONEHOLD 135/4    ;
         ONEHOLD 129/34   ;
         ONEHOLD 135/68   ; Hold EchoMail For Pickup
         ONEHOLD 170/211  ;
         ONEHOLD 104/24   ;

        Here is the event line for this schedule.

     Event All   04:00 05:00 N     E1=11 E2=30 E3=50 A=180

        E1 is  set to Errorlevel 11 which sets the schedule to SCHED M
     which is my NMH schedule.

        I hope you are beginning to understand this. Basically you set
     each schedule to handle the mail the way you want it done.

        So far,  I have  not touched  on the command line for OMMM but
     will now cover that.

        All of  my  events  call  the  procedure  named  :BUNDLE which
     basically starts  OMMM on its way. Here is what BUNDLE looks like
     in my batch file.

        :Bundle
        Ommm -s%sched% -hd:\zzzznet\outbound  -cd:\Bink\ommm.ctl     -
     Id:\Bink\binkley.PRM -Md:\zzzznet -n -d -z
        Goto Start

        This breaks down as follows:

        -s%sched% is  the SCHED  variable set by the various events as
     the day goes by.

        -hd:\zzzznet\outbound is the holding  area  for  messages once
     they have  been processed. This is WHERE they seem todisappear to
     after OMMM has processed them. This is also where Binkley EXPECTS
     to find them.

        -c:\Bink\ommm.ctl is  the COMPLETE  path and  file name of the
     control file for OMMM.

        -Id:\Bink\binkley.PRM is the COMPLETE  path and  file name for
     the Binkley PRM file.

        -Md:\zzzznet is  the directory  where Quick  BBS and any other
     utility stores messages WAITING to be processed.

     FidoNews 5-07                Page 10                  15 Feb 1988


        Once OMMM has processed the mail, the batch file goes  back to
     the start and runs Binkley again.

        E3 in the Binkley.cfg file is a special flag. This is what you
     want to occur when CRASH  Mail  is  received.  I  have  listed my
     procedure below.

     :Unpackmail        ; Procedure Name
      C:                ; Change To Drive C
      Cd\AAAAAAAA       ; Change To Quick BBS Sub Directory
      echogen -U -T     ; Unarc and Toss All Echomail
      ARCMAIL  FROM  ALL    ;  Just  In  Case Echogen Misses Something
      ECHOTOSS          ; Same As Line Above
      MailToss 2        ; Toss NetMail Into Quick BBS Board 2
      D:                ; Change Back To Drive D
      Cd \Bink          ; Change To Binkley Sub Directory
      Goto Bundle       ; Ah, Here Is Bundle Again

        Bundle is called at the end to process the mail again. Echogen
     produces the  echomail for the nodes I feed. If any EchoMail came
     in the CRASH mail, Echogen sends it to the nodes I feed  and then
     tosses it  into the  appropriate message  boards in the Quick BBS
     message file.

        So, as you can see, running OMMM to  process the  mail is done
     after any  mail comes  in, and  again at  the start  of every new
     event. By setting the  SCHED variable  to the  proper schedule in
     OMMM.CTL you determine how the mail is to be handled.

        You will  notice the  following lines  at the  top of my batch
     file to run Binkley.

        Set BINKLEY=D:\BINK\
        If %Sched%!==! goto day_route

        The first line sets the Dos variable BINKLEY equal to the PATH
     where the Binkley files are stored. This is QUITE important, so I
     set it here as well as in my AUTOEXEC.BAT file  upon system start
     up.

        The second  line covers unexpected mistakes on my part. If, in
     my all night editing sessions  I  screw  up  and  leave  an event
     unscheduled, it  reverts to the day time mail schedule which ONLY
     sends local mail. I learned this lesson the hard way.

        I hope  that explains  a little  more about  how Binkley works
     with  Quick  BBS.  I  have  enclosed  my  complete batch file and
     configuration at the end of this article to  help you  along your
     way.

        As the  Quick BBS HELP node I keep a complete set of Quick BBS
     and Binkley files on-line. These are available to new callers for
     download on  the FIRST call. Here is the latest list of Quick BBS
     and associated files that go along with Quick BBS.

     future. I  have seen it, and it runs very nicely. I would love to
     Beta test (Hint) on my system.

        Quick BBS version 2.0 is going into Beta  test very  soon, and
     we are all looking forward to seeing it.

        Each system may appear different  to  you,  as  the  menus and
     basically  the  entire  presentation  is  designed  by the Sysop,
     similar to TBBS.

        Ansi graphics are used in many systems and  the color displays
     can be very nice.

        Unlike other  systems Quick  BBS does not write a message file
     for each individual message. Messages  are  stored  in  one large
     file with the header and other message info in another file. This
     alone has been the cause for many Opus and Fido  Sysops to switch
     over to  Quick BBS.  Lots of disk space and directory entries are
     saved in this manner and the search through  the message  base is
     extremely fast!

        Currently Echogen  1.05 handles  mail just like Confmail does.
     It will Toss and Scan mail and is extremely fast.

        Quick  BBS  handles  most  popular  file   transfer  protocols
     including Zmodem and Ymodem.

        You  can  exit  Quick  BBS  while  on-line  in  one of several
     methods. One method is  a spawn  to Dos  to run  another program.
     Another method is an actual exit from Quick BBS and then a return
     with the special -R command. These two features allow you  to run
     large programs with no problems.

        A FOSSIL  driver is required to run Quick BBS. At this time we
     recommend either X00V_106 or  X00V_108  depending  upon  which of
     those  two  perform  best  on  your  system.  Both will work with
     Binkley with no problems.

        Well that's about it for now.  Here are  the files  I promised
     you earlier.

                       The Great Earthquake Hoax
                             Fredric Rice
                               (103/503)

        Original  reference   material  may   be  found  at  Griffith
     Observatory,  located  at  2800  East   Observatorty  Road,  Los
     Angeles,  California.  90027.  Request  back  issue  of Griffith
     Observer, January, 1975, page 14, for  Edward K. L. Upton,  "The
     Great Earthquake Hoax".  Direct  requests to Dr.  Edwin C. Krupp
     and staff. You may aquire subscriptions to the Griffith Observer
     through the same  address.  It  provides  a  great  quantity  of
     understandable  information concerning  astronomy,  (And is well
     worth the price!)
                          --------------------
        The word  "Scientist", as defined  in  the common dictionary,
     describes a person who is  "expert in science".  It further goes
     on to say that "Science" is  defined as  "systematized knowledge
     or a branch  of it".  "Expert" has  been described  as "X", (the
     unknown factor), and "Spert", (a drip under pressure).

        A scientist would then be  a person  who specializes in drips
     under pressure. At least this seems to be the  case with some of
     the so-called "Scientist" that "pop up" every now and then.

        Related here, in the form  of  a  question,  is  the  actuall
     account of an  incident that many  of you will  remember. Do you
     remember way back in  1982  when the San  Andreas Fault gave way
     and California slipped into the contenential shelf?

        If any of you  were quick  enough to  buy Nevada  beach front
     property after reading  "The  Jupiter  Effect", written  by John
     Gribbon and Stephen  Plagemann, you would no doubt remember that
     fatefull day as the day your newly aquired property became beach
     front indeed.

        Let's explore the outer edges  of known science and see if we
     can  understand how  these  two  great  scientist  were  able to
     extrapolate the end of California from mounds of research papers
     and data.
                            --------------------
        In September  of  1975,  two  scientist,  one  who associated
     within the NASA  circle, the other  who  works for a  scientific
     journal, wrote a book  that would  inform the general California
     public about the up-comming destruction of the state.

        The train of events for the discovery of this information was
     a staggering amount of hypotheses. For each of these hypotheses,
     a  detailed  examination with supportive  data  and  graphs  was
     offered.

        1) Within the text of this book, they  say  that sunspots are
           created by tidal forces generated by the planets.  They go
           further  to  state  that  sunspot activity  increases when
           planets are grouped along one side of the sun.

        Can they be serious?  Do they  do their  homework? Well,  the
     FidoNews 5-07                Page 18                  15 Feb 1988


     answer would have to  be no. Tidal  forces are  additive when on
     opposite  sides of  the  sun  also.  This  would  seem to  be an
     assumption on  the part of the authors that  the pull of gravity
     would be additive when on the  same  side  and cancel eachothers
     pull out when on opposite sides of the sun.

        2) The solar wind produces changes in the air flow pattern in
           the Earths atmosphere.  Further,  the  changes  that  take
           place  tend  to  slow  down  the  rotation  of  the Earth,
           increasing the  length  of  the  day  by  about one  0.001
           second.

        Well, in fact, this is true. We must agree that the effect of
     solar particles  and  the accumulation  of  meteroic  dust  does
     contribute to the  lengthening  of the day.  The rotation of the
     Earth is not constant and  in fact will  speed up  and slow down
     for a variety of reasons.

        3) Fault lines are put under additional strain when the Earth
           is slowed down.  The deceleration of the massive  Earth is
           great enough to cause major damage to the Earths crust.

        It's a good thing the Earth doesn't have  tecktonic plates or
     we would all be in trouble! When  in fact, we do  have tecktonic
     plates that  cause  the  faults  the  authors talk  about. These
     plates move in all directions, (California will be at the  North
     Pole some day). The  theory  that the  Earth decelerates quickly
     enough to cause increased strain to the  Earths crust has not be
     demonstrated  yet.  At  least  to   subscribed  knowledge,  such
     evidence does not yet exist.

        4) When Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus join the others planets in
           1982 there  will  be  a  greater  tidal  pull  on  the sun
           triggering massive  solar eruptions.  These eruptions will
           change the air flow pattern of Earth,  causing fault lines
           to break, and all of California will be history.

        Actually, the authors do  not go  on to  say  that California
     will be history.  What they actually talk  about is  the massive
     damage and  loss  of  life  that  will  occure when the  big one
     finally hits.

        The authors  don't know about  Alaska, Chile, or  Japan where
     other major faults can be found.  Why would  San  Andreas be the
     only fault to be affected by the Jupiter Effect?

        California is a nice place.  I have lived on  the Californian
     beach for over 28  years,  and  even  spent  some  time  in  Los
     Angeles! I was born  in southern  California  at  an undisclosed
     year, but I am forced to admit that  the  people  are  a  little
     quick to  accept  any  "scientific"  observation  or device that
     makes the six  o'clock news.  That and the earthquakes that take
     place from  time  to  time  add  up  to an  underlying fear that
     someday the big one will come.

        It  would  have  been  better for  everyone concerned  if the
     FidoNews 5-07                Page 19                  15 Feb 1988


     authors had  published their scientific  data  in a  comic book.
     This type of  sensationalization of  a planetary "alignment" was
     childish and  gives  the  rest  of  the  scientific  community a
     black eye.
                           --------------------
        It is up to the scientist  of the community  to suppress this
     type of nonesense  and psuedo-sciences such as astrology and tea
     leaf reading. Unfortunatly, respectable scientist don't have the
     visability that the  authors of "Jupiter" do. You might remember
     the revelations  about the  origin of humans in the Von Danakain
     Theory or  "Chariots of the Gods!".  Many  graphs,  charts,  and
     photographs prove points which the layman or  uninformed are not
     trained to understand.

        Carl Segan has  stated that  just  because  he  is  a  highly
     visable scientist, you shouldn't take his  word as an authority.
     This is a good message to  take with you on your way to the book
     store.
                           --------------------
     Additional Information:

     1) The actual "Alignment" that took place in 1982 was not a true
        alignment in the proper sence. The planets  grouped along 100
        degrees  of the ecliptic when they are usually further apart.
        In  this sense, it could be said that an alignment was taking
        place.

     2) The solar tide  is affected  by  the  planets  by  about  one
        milimeter. This is about the thickness of a dime.
                            --------------------
      Additional Reading:

     1) The Jupiter Effect. Don't wast your money if you can't borrow
        a copy of this book.  The library in your area  might have it
        so ask them first.
