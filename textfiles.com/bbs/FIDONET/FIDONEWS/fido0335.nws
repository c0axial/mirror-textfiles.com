     This week's guest editorial is by Ian Shirado.

                      THE DAY FIDONEWS DIDN'T COME OUT


     I'd woken up early that morning, as I always did on Mondays,  and
     gone down to the computer.  Flipping it on, I dialed Rob's board;
     commonly  known  as Illini Data.  Rob's was the best DEC oriented
     board around,  sure,  but at the moment that  wasn't  why  I  was
     calling.  Far from it.  Today was Monday, and the latest FidoNews
     would be up today.

     I log on as quickly as possible with a brand new terminal program
     that uses macros.  (I figure this thing will cut at least 10% off
     the time it takes to sign on and other mundane chores.) I flip to
     file area 9, text files,  and Raw display for "FNEWS*.*".  Wait a
     minute.   Something  screwy  here.   Wasn't  229  the  last  one?
     Something tells me today isn't going to be  an  ordinary  day.  I
     log  off  even  quicker  than  I logged on,  by dropping carrier.
     (Normally,  I don't do that,  but I'm getting a  little  anxious.
     Nervous  people  are  entitled to do strange things.) I dial up a
     few other boards.  When the newsletter is nowhere to be found,  I
     start  to  panic.  In  a frenzy,  I use the last resort -- I call
     SEAboard itself.  Busy.  I sweat out the next  twenty-four  hours
     by  calling  back  every 5 minutes,  it seems.  Finally,  Tuesday
     night,  I connect!  The bulletins sweep by and  --  wait,  what's
     this?  "FidoNews  did  not  come  out  this week due to a systems
     failure." Or something like that.

     I log  off.  I  don't  feel  devestated,  no.  Rather,  relieved,
     because at least now I know the reason.  But it makes me stop and
     think.

     Am  I  abnormal?  No.  Just a junkie.  I've talked to other users
     and sysops who say their palms itch and hair  falls  out  if  the
     newsletter  doesn't arrive on time.  But these symptoms can apply
     to just about anything.

     Stop and think a minute.  What would YOU  do  if  the  newsletter
     didn't  come?  Some  of  you  are  lucky enough to have someone's
     voice number to call and find out what the deal is.  But  60%  of
     all  sysops,  and  just  about 99% of all users,  don't have this
     reassurance.  Let me take the example a little bit further.  What
     would you do is you woke up, logged onto your board (assuming you
     are a sysop) and found that there was  no  new  FidoMail.  Zilch.
     NO  NEW  MESSAGES AT ALL.  Maybe you get a slight queasy feeling.
     But you have faith,  so you wait until the next morning to  check
     again.  STILL NO NEW MESSAGES.  By now,  your skin is chalk white
     and you feel like a victim of St.  Vitus' Dance.  Could it be the
     way you smell?  Or maybe your modem blew a circuit?  Yeah, that's
     gotta  be  it!  But taking the example further still,  what would
     you do if (God In Heaven Forbid) the NODELIST failed to arrive?

     The point I am trying to  make  here  is  that  pretty  much  all
     members  of the human race find it easy to fall into habits.  And
     when you have FidoMail expected every  night,  FidoNews  expected
     every  Monday,  and  the nodelist every Friday,  it's pretty darn
     easy to expect them to BE THERE, as a law of nature.  It's just a
     subset  of  the  old  "Immersed-in-computers-so-deeply-you-can't-
     react-to-people-around-you"  syndrome.  I'm  not saying any of us
     have this (even though it's quite likely),  but next time there's
     an electronic delay (and there will be), keep this in mind.


     Inspired  by (what else?) the failure of FidoNews for the week of
     August 4th.

     =================================================================

     Jim Kay
      109/612 (sysop)

     I wish to register a loud complaint.  I realize that Fido
     is a volunteer organization and that means the operators
     have many other, more pressing things to do, like earn a
     living.  However, when an article appears in Fidonews
     inviting sysops to join an Echomail conferance, I think
     the submitters should have the courtesy to respond to
     people who accept the offer.

     Fidonews 332 contains three such offers.  The editorial
     indicates on page 3 that an echomail conferance is set up
     for IFNA business.  I have sent two inquires to 103/501,
     asking to join.  There has been no response at all.

     The notices section on pages 20 and 21 contains two more
     offers.  One for C programmers (103/511 - 124/108) and
     one for Sci Fi (150/900).  Similarly, there has been no
     response from either of them.

     Shame on all of you!

     I will partially withdraw my complaint against the C
     programmers conferance because they at least put in the
     name of the conferance.  That makes it possible to just
     start sending messages.  Unfortunately, they didn't tell
     exactly which node to send messages to. 0 for 3 stinks.

     Ken Shackelford
     133/0 in Atlanta

                 IFNA You Don't Pay, THENA You Don't Play!


     I am sure that most of you,  by this late date,  have heard about
     the  Colorado Conference of last month,  and some of the most un-
     fortunate things that have come to pass since that time.  Many of
     you, no doubt,  have read my "review" of the conference doings in
     the  NET 161 "Nooseletter" (NET161.A0A from 161/1).  In short,  I
     stated what were my unrefined  views  of  what  happened  at  the
     conference,  FROM  MY  POINT  OF  VIEW.  I have received numerous
     notes from many of you that have read  the  document,  some  from
     those  of  you  that attended the conference as I did,  that were
     with very little exception supportive of  my  review  and  of  my
     feelings  about IFNA at the time.  Most of you shared my concerns
     about Fido and FidoNet,  and were quick to tell me  so.  I  thank
     all of you who replied either directly or indirectly,  and I also
     thank the NET 161 Sysops for allowing me to use  the  Nooseletter
     as a forum for bringing into the open many of the issues that are
     now  affecting  us.  The  Nooseletter  surely  has  not made me a
     favorite topic of discussion in St.  Louis  (grin),  but  it  did
     serve  to get their attention!  They now know that we "exist" out
     here.  Before that,  we probably just seemed like names  on  some
     printout  called NODELIST.A??  or something.  What St.  Louis NOW
     knows is that there are some very real human being out here,  and
     that  we're  all very much concerned about what's going on.  If I
     helped in some small way with my  Nooseletter  article  to  cause
     this, then I am very satisfied.

     OK,  so  I  have stirred up the waters a bit,  and gotten alot of
     good folks "concerned" over what the guys in St.  Louis  "appear"
     to be doing to us.  This has,  in turned,  sparked quite a bit of
     controversy (most of it very healthy).  At this  stage,  we  have
     probably  all  formed some initial opinions about IFNA,  and have
     reasons that we can support as to  whether  we  even  need  IFNA.
     Much  of what I have been reading in the various EchoMail confer-
     ences comes down to the following key gripes:

     (1) If you don't pay IFNA $25,  then you won't get into the  IFNA
         nodelist (no PAY no PLAY).

     (2) Only IFNA "members" can vote on FidoNet issues.

     (3) Only  Fido  Sysops  that pay the $25 fee can "vote" on issues
         that affect ALL Fido Sysops.

     (4) IFNA is trying to make Fido/FidoNet a BUSINESS rather than  a
         HOBBY.

     (5) The guys in St.  Louis have gotten greedy, and see FidoNet as
         a way to make money for themselves.

     (6) The IFNA "in group" is doing things behind our backs  and  is
         making decisions without our input.
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   15 Sep 1986


     (7) The  conference  was rigged to force us all to accept IFNA as
         our "god", and the St. Louis Sysops as our "lords".

     (8) Ken, Ben, Thom Henderson,  and Tom Jennings are trying to get
         "rich" off of OUR efforts.

     (9) Who really OWNS the nodelist!

     (10) Various and sundry other "flames"....


     Do  we  NEED  an  IFNA?  You'll hear all sorts of answers on THIS
     issue,  but I'll give only my opinion here.  And that is  -  YES.
     We need SOMETHING.  If IFNA will do it for us,  then by all means
     let's have it.  But is HAS to be OUR organization.  It can  NEVER
     be  something that's only for a select few.  Otherwise,  we don't
     need it,  we won't have  it,  and  we'll  NOT  support  it.  Fair
     enough???

     Are there any facts to support the above allegations,  and a host
     of others that are not listed above?  Well, to be honest, some of
     the statements listed above ARE with merit.  For example,  a  BIG
     mistake  was  made  by  IFNA when it did not inform us before the
     conference that it had incorporated,  and that it  had  plans  to
     drastically  change  the way we deal with FidoNet and the guys up
     in St. Louis.  This could have been handled ALOT better by simply
     publishing the agenda and a set of  initial  goals  to  get  IFNA
     started.  By  the time the conference rolled around,  much of the
     initial discussion could have already taken place,  and we  would
     have  been  ready to get at the work to be done.  Of course,  Ken
     Kaplan and Ben Baker REALIZE this mistake now.  If they had it to
     do over again,  I think it would have been done differently  than
     it was.  Hindsight, as they say, is most always 20-20.

     No  pay,  no play?  That is,  if you don't pay the $25 fee,  then
     will you NOT get listed in the  nodelist?  Well,  from  what  was
     ORIGINALLY said in Colorado, this was to have been the case!  But
     since then,  there has been so much controversy over  this  point
     that  I  -think-  that the policy now is that everyone will be in
     the nodelist without charge for  the  time  being.  This  is,  of
     course,  subject to change at some later date, but for now we can
     all breathe a little easier!  I am against  any  fee  that  would
     restrict  the  growth of the network.  I find the fee to get into
     the nodelist EXTREMELY nasty.  But right now,  it's a moot point.
     Thus,  until it BECOMES an issue, there really is nothing to take
     issue with.

     How many of you are aware that the $25 fee being charged  at  the
     conference  was NOT authorized by IFNA?  According to Ken Kaplan,
     there was never any agreement that a fee should be charged to get
     membership into IFNA started.  Turns out that it was some of  the
     COSUG  (Colorado  Springs PC User's Group) that initiated the fee
     and began taking up collections for it.  Ken Kaplan and IFNA were
     NOT at fault for this ...  HOWEVER, they were DEFINITELY at fault
     for  not  stopping  it when they discovered what had happened and
     not returning everyone's money right then and  there.  Also,  the
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   15 Sep 1986


     business of "no pay,  no vote" was NOT Ken Kaplan's statement but
     that of George Wing, the conference Coordinator.  Now,  I as much
     as  ANYONE  appreciates  all  of the hard work that the COSUG put
     into getting the conference off  the  ground.  Without  them,  it
     would  have  never  happened.  But  since  George was NOT an IFNA
     board member, he really should NOT have made a statement that has
     come back time and again to "haunt" the IFNA officers.  Yes, they
     screwed up again by NOT putting a stop to the collection  of  the
     fee,  and  for  not "correcting" George on the voting thing.  But
     from my information,  they are not really guilty  of  plotting  a
     conspiracy against us.

     Is  IFNA trying to turn the FidoNet HOBBY into a BUSINESS?  Well,
     you'll get mixed reactions on THAT issue.  I think that they  are
     and  I am most sorry to see that happen.  We have enjoyed running
     Fido boards and participating in FidoNet for several  years  now,
     and  it has been a most rewarding and satisfying hobby,  at least
     for me.  I hate to think that now we have to all become a part of
     a BUSINESS.  Ken Kaplan makes several good and valid cases as  to
     why  we  must  let  FidoNet  grow and become a non-profit entity.
     Some of his reasons are most compelling.  But  at  least,  in  MY
     opinion,  much  of what I have heard in regard to some IFNA goals
     is just not needed.  We do NOT yet have an "official" document to
     look at that will give us the actual  goals  and  aspirations  of
     IFNA.  Until we get that (being worked on now,  even as I speak),
     then we cannot properly address these  questions.  I'll  hold  my
     final  judgment  until I see the docs.  Ken has very kindly asked
     me to be a part of the Bylaws Rules Committee,  and I have  given
     my  acceptance.  I  hope  to be able to make a very positive con-
     tribution to the process.

     I don't think that the guys in St.  Louis have necessarily gotten
     "greedy".  I  am not sure that I completely agree with everything
     they have told me,  but then that's not to be  expected.  We  all
     have  very  different  points  of view on things,  so it would be
     astonding if we all agreed!  One of the things that both Ken  and
     Ben  have said that they want is an office,  staffed perhaps by a
     part-time employee.  This employee of the IFNA corporation  would
     take  care of answering correspondence,  and other administrative
     functions.  This could be a good thing in the  long  run,  as  it
     would free Ken and Ben up from such administration,  so that they
     could work on maintaining FidoNet.  I have no problem with  this,
     AS LONG AS they provide to all of us,  on demand,  a complete and
     accurate accounting of how all monies are spent.  Such  a  report
     MUST  appear  in FidoNews at least quarterly (yeah,  some will no
     doubt argue that this is too often,  but unless Ken and  Ben  are
     VERY  forthcoming  on  THIS  issue,  there is bound to be ALOT of
     mistrust,  and we don't need THAT).  Income  generated  from  our
     fees could be most "tempting",  even to a Saint.  It is therefore
     incumbent upon US,  the People,  to keep careful tabs on how  our
     monies  are  spent,  and on what.  One of the things that I heard
     Ken mention today on the phone was that We (all nodes) would  get
     ONE time to vote, as a group, on the Bylaws of the IFNA Corp.  If
     the Bylaws were approved, then they would possibly stipulate that
     out  of each Region (or other "unit") we would "elect" someone to
     represent our interests on our behalf to IFNA.  Sort of like  the
     Fidonews                     Page 8                   15 Sep 1986


     U.S.  Senate.  We'd  be  able to tell our representatives what we
     want,  and THEY'D take the message back to  the  IFNA  board  for
     appropriate  action.  We'd  be  dealing with ELECTED OFFICIALS of
     IFNA.  This could be a good thing for us all.  Now,  this is just
     TALK,  so  don't  hold either Ken Kaplan or myself to this.  It's
     just ONE of the things being discussed at this  time,  and  we'll
     see how it eventually evolves!

     Most  everyone  I  have  talked to seems to perceive that to be a
     part of IFNA,  you have to be on good terms with the "in"  group.
     I don't THINK this is true;  I could be wrong,  of course,  but I
     would rather hope that Ken and Ben,  both very respectable  guys,
     would  not  try and "play favorites" in the net.  It would surely
     come back to haunt them if they did,  I can guarantee you of THAT
     fact!  I  personally have seen no evidence of favoritism going on
     within FidoNet.  The people that are perceived as "favorites" are
     usually the ones that are doing all of the  work.  When  was  the
     last time YOU volunteered to do something for FidoNet?  Heck when
     was the last time -I- volunteered, to be perfectly honest.  Well,
     I  HAVE  done  so  in  the  past  by becoming the first Region 18
     Coordinator,  and later moving on to set up Network 133  in  good
     old  Atlanta.  Up  until my "famous" NET 161 Nooseletter article,
     most of you probably never even HEARD of me.  And,  as it just so
     happens,  I volunteered to be on the Bylaws Rules Committee.  Ken
     needed people to do it,  so I jumped in.  I may fall flat  on  my
     face,  but at least I'm trying.  How 'bout the rest of you?  Come
     on and get involved ...  you ALL have a stake in this thing,  and
     if  you  DON'T speak out and participate,  then you'll not have a
     right to COMPLAIN.  I think that if you ask,  there will be  more
     than enough work of the FidoNet to go around such that you'll get
     your  piece of it.  From my perception,  the "in" group is ALL of
     us that pitch in and help.  This article for FidoNews is one way.
     Speak out and make your opinions KNOWN.  That's the only true way
     to effect change, folks.  How 'bout it?

     Do I think of the guys in St.  Louis as "gods".  Heck,  no.  They
     are  flesh  and  blood mortals like the rest of us,  and prone to
     make mistakes.  Their handling of the conference only  serves  to
     re-enforce that fact.  This was their first conference,  and they
     screwed up.  Should we nail them  to  a  cross  for  that?  Well,
     maybe,  given  the  nature of some of the blunders.  But lets not
     stone them until we know for sure that they're  out  to  put  the
     screws  to  us for the sake of doing it.  I have seen no evidence
     as of yet that they are trying to "subjugate" us.  Heck,  if  any
     of  us  don't  like what IFNA is doing,  then let's start our own
     nodelist.  Nothing says we HAVE to use the  IFNA  nodelist,  does
     it?  You  wanna  different  nodelist?  Then somebody out there go
     start one.  Maybe that's not such a  bad  idea,  either.  Whoever
     DOES start one,  though, is going to find it a very difficult and
     tiring job.  I am all in favor of helping Ken and Ben to  recover
     some  of  their  out  of pocket expenses via contributions - they
     deserve at least that.  I propose that we ALL give the IFNA  guys
     the benefit of the doubt now,  at least until the Bylaws come out
     and we can all study them.  If, at that time,  we don't like what
     we see, then we can tell IFNA to kiss off, and start our own net.
     How  about  that?  But before we do anything like that,  lets try
     Fidonews                     Page 9                   15 Sep 1986


     and work with Ken and Ben, and see what they REALLY have in mind.
     After all, all we have so far is SPECULATION and RUMOR.  Yes, the
     Colorado Calamity is over and done with,  so let's put it  behind
     us and move on.  We may ALL be pleasantly surprised!!

     Who  is  going  to  get  rich off of IFNA?  Ken and Ben?  I don't
     THINK so (I might be wrong,  but I just don't see it).  How about
     Thom  Henderson?  No,  he's already got a business to worry about
     right now (one of the partners of System Enhancement  Associates)
     so I can't see Thom making out like a bandit on this.  Well,  how
     about TJ?  Poor ol' Tom Jennings.  If anyone in  the  IFNA  group
     DESERVES to make money out of this thing, it's TJ.  Wasn't it Tom
     Jennings  that  GAVE us Fido to start with?  Over the years,  Tom
     has nursed the code along and enhanced it (almost to  death).  He
     has  worked  HARD  to  make  Fido what it is today,  and asked so
     little in return.  And probably has GOTTEN so little.  If  anyone
     deserves  to  make money off of IFNA,  it's TJ.  I hope he'll get
     SOMETHING.  Alot has been said  about  Fido  distribution  rights
     having  been  "sold" to IFNA,  such that if any of us want to get
     Fido,  we'll have to "buy" it from IFNA.  I don't  have  any  in-
     formation  on this,  so I can't state anything in that areas as a
     "fact".  But would it be such a terrible thing if IFNA  -did-sell
     it  on Tom's behalf?  Maybe for something like $25 to Fido Sysops
     for a mojor release,  with free updates?  So that  TJ  would  get
     something  out  of  all  of this that we are trying to protect so
     fiercely?  As a professional programmer,  TJ is entitled,  in  my
     book, to reap some reward for all that he is done, and I'd be the
     first  in  line  to give him his due.  Mind you,  the cost that I
     stated above is just MY idea,  and NOT an IFNA policy.  I do  not
     KNOW how IFNA will be distributing Fido software, if in fact they
     really are or will be in the future.

     Who "owns" the nodelist?  Boy, have I heard THAT one tossed about
     lately.  As most of you know,  IFNA has put a copyright notice on
     the nodeist recently,  which says that the  nodelist  is  THEIRS.
     From  what  facts  I  have,  this was not done with the intent of
     putting the screws to us.  The reason this was done  was  because
     some  bozo  in Austrailia was SELLING the nodelist!  This was not
     fair,  since he did not compile the blasted thing,  and therefore
     had  no  right  to  sell  it  to  anyone.  But since it was not a
     copyrighted  work,   there  was  no  way  to  prevent  him   from
     continuing.  By  placing  the  copyright  notice on the nodelist,
     IFNA did, if nothing else, make it clear that the work was not to
     be sold by anyone without IFNA's explicit permission  to  do  so.
     In  effect,  the INTENTION here was not to rob us,  but rather to
     PROTECT us.  Now,  this protection can be a  double  edged  sword
     that  "cuts"  both  ways.  On the one hand,  IFNA has effectively
     stopped the pirating of OUR nodelist.  But  on  the  OTHER  hand,
     IFNA has said that the nodelist belongs to THEM - NOT US.  Now, I
     understand  and  appreciate the good intentions,  and see them as
     exactly that.  But in doing this,  I personally  feel  that  IFNA
     over extended themselves into OUR domain.  When I put together my
     NET  133  nodelist,  which  will  eventually become a PART of the
     national nodelist, it is ME doing the "work";  not St.  Louis.  I
     am the person who is creating the list,  verifying the phone num-
     bers,  and sedning the list on up the ladder so that  it  can  be
     Fidonews                     Page 10                  15 Sep 1986


     made available to the rest of you.  Is it fair for Ken Kaplan and
     Ben  Baker  to put THEIR copyright on my work?  I don't think so,
     to be honest.  Again, I -understand- why they did it, but I think
     in this instance it's a case of shooting  off  your  big  toe  in
     order  to  get rid of a corn!  I have alot of very mixed feelings
     on this issue,  and would appreciate input from the rest  of  you
     out there.  Do I,  as a Net Coordinator, have the right, even the
     DUTY,  to copyright MY part of the nodelist?  IFNA certainly  can
     copyright  the  COLLECTION  of  parts,  but  each  PART should be
     separately copyrighted to protect the work  all  of  the  various
     coordinators  do to produce the nodelist as we know it.  But then
     this is MY opinion - you may certain differ with that.

     There is one more perception that I'd  like  to  address.  That's
     the  belief  that IFNA is doing things behind our backs,  with no
     regard for what WE think.  Well,  to a degree that HAS been  true
     in the past.  I am not going to defend IFNA, neither for the sake
     of  just  "defending  them,  nor  for any past mistakes they have
     made.  But they do seem to be willing to change,  and make  their
     inner  workings  more of a public forum.  Recently,  we have seen
     the emergence of the IFNA EchoMail  Conference.  It  is  in  this
     conference  that Ken and Ben are MOST accessible,  and where they
     reply to all serious non-flame messages.  A  cool,  rational  ex-
     change  of  information.  I applaud them for taking part in this,
     and for making IFNA more accessible to the rest of  us.  I  still
     think  that there is alot going on that we don't know about,  but
     at least this is a START.  And we  have  to  start  SOMEPLACE.  I
     hope that as the true facts about IFNA come to be generally known
     to   all,   we'll  have  even  more  avenues  of  discussion  and
     participation available to us.

     Anyhow,  these are just some of my  views  in  the  wake  of  the
     Colorado  Conference,  and  the Nooseletter.  Most of the "shock"
     has finally worn off now,  and it seems  that  we're  slowly  but
     surely  beginning  to come to terms with change.  None of this is
     anything that we expected, for sure.  But it's here and now,  and
     we're  going  to have to deal with it.  Some of the things that I
     have heard are IFNA goals are indeed  desirable;  some  are  not.
     And again,  this is MY opinion, and may not necessarily be yours.
     But since I am here to offer my opinion, let me summarize:

     A - We let Ken and Ben get on with things,  and go ahead and  set
         up IFNA as they have started to do.

     B - We  await the results of the Bylaws Rules Committee,  and see
         just what it is that IFNA is really supposed to be.

     C - With the facts in hand as of 1/1/87, we decide whether or not
         we want to be a part of IFNA.  Many of us will  elect  to  do
         so;  many of us will not.  We can decide,  based on something
         called INFORMATION at that time.

     D - We all remain calm,  and not fly off the handle at others who
         have  differing opinions.  Even I have been guilty as of late
         of that.

     E - We continue to enjoy our HOBBY.


     We all have to remember that IFNA is what WE make of  it.  If  we
     don't  like it,  we don't have to join it.  We can vote the board
     out of office come election time,  or just set up our own network
     and forget about IFNA.  It is WE that have the power; not Ken and
     Ben.  If they have any power at all,  it is that which we give to
     them.  We should ALWAYS be mindful of that.  It is my belief that
     until Ken and Ben disappoint us, we should stand behind them now,
     and see where we can take this thing called IFNA.  Who knows?  We
     might end up even liking it!



     That's it for me this week, and I invite your reply!

     Jason Patterson, 155/201, Fido Australia

     Hi.  I would like to ask a favor of you for my city.  Our city is
     facing a problem at the moment and so is the region we're located
     in.  The  problem  is  this.  Australia is going to celebrate its
     bicentenary in 1988.  There  will  be  a  tall  ships  race  from
     Adalaide  to  Melbourne  in  that year but they won't be wieghing
     anchor at Portland Victoria.  You  see  Portland  was  the  FIRST
     permanent  settlement in Victoria and these ships will be sailing
     right by us, they will be only 3 miles off shore.  Melbourne will
     be stealing history from us.

     What  I'd  like  you to do for me and my city is to write or call
     any relevent authorities who are participating in  this  race  to
     allow at least ONE tall ship to dock here.

     I beleive the NAVY and the COAST GAURD are participating in this.
     So if you can help please send a message to me on this board.  If
     somthing  won't be done the citizens of Prtland might cecede from
     the rest of Australia.  It might happen but then again its just a
     possibility.

     If  the  ships  do  past  this  city  it  would  be  like the U.S
     celebrating two hundred years without the statue of liberty.

     From: Region 19 Coordinators
     Subject: Attention all nodes in Region 19!

     1) Region 19 EchoMail Conference
     --------------------------------
          We  have  a fairly large region here,  with  a  lot  of
     boards.  As  coordinators for the region,  Mark and I get to
     hear  a lot of complaints (and at least a few  compliments!)
     but  that's about the extent of our communications with  the
     rest  of  the region.  Many of you probably aren't aware  of
     what's going on in other areas of the region, either.
          We'd like to propose a regional echo conference so that
     we  can start communicating with each other about topics  of
     mutual  concern.  The state of Fido is undergoing  political
     upheaval and re-organization.  As coordinators, we have some
     input into the process,  and we'd like you to share with  us
     your comments and ideas.
           But  that's just part of it!  Most of us are under the
     dominion of South Western Bell, the phone company that HATES
     modemmers. We in Oklahoma City haven't had any real problems
     with them recently,  but considering their attitudes towards
     us,  something is bound to break sometime.  We need to  band
     together for our own protection.
          Those are only two of the reasons for a regional  echo;
     I'll  bet  there are lots of you out there who can think  of
     many  other  issues concerning this region  that  should  be
     addressed.
          Setting  this thing up is going to be  complicated.  We
     already  have  our hands full with moderating another  echo,
     and  with the usual regional chores.  I would like  to  hear
     from  some  volunteers,  preferably  (but  not  necessarily)
     sysops  who already have some experience with  EchoMail.  We
     will do everything we can to help you get it started.

     2) A Regional Newsletter
     ------------------------
          I've  been  wanting to start a regional newsletter  for
     awhile  now,  and we're starting to hear from others  around
     the  region who are interested,  too.  If we can make a  re-
     gional echo fly,  there may not be as much need for it,  but
     it's still a good idea.  One of the problems with an echo is
     that all the messages don't always reach all the boards,  or
     when  they  do,  they aren't always in a coherent  order.  A
     newsletter  can summarize the most important topics and  can
     be more easily distributed.
          It  seems  like  the simplest way to spread  it  around
     would  be  for us to attach it to the nodelist or  the  Fido
     newsletter,  which most of you poll us for already.  Not all
     of  the hosts do,  though;  some get it from other  sources.
     Those would have to make alternate arrangements.
          It  is because of them  that I'm making this  announce-
     ment  in  the national newsletter;  I want to be  sure  that
     everyone knows about it.

     quickly as possible.

     As convenient as it would be, remember no  one  can  dictate
     how to make the connections, we can only recommend.

                What Does FidoNet Mean in a Small City?


     I've been  reading through  the messages  on the Echoes regarding
     the Conference in Colorado and the  possible futures  for FidoNet
     and the  International Fido  Net Association.   I get the feeling
     that to a lot of the  people involved  have a  feeling of,  "If I
     don't get my way then I'll just get (RBBS, Collie, whatever, pick
     one) and tell IFNA to take a flying  leap! I  certainly would un-
     derstand their  feelings a little more if there were any evidence
     that there was anything that has actually happened  that can't be
     attributed simply to disorganization and ignorance. Before we get
     in too big of a rush to break up FidoNet I'd like to express what
     FidoNet and  the enhancements  we've seen  in the last few months
     mean to me and my users.

     Chico is a small city of 35,000 for four months  a year  and then
     the State  University opens and the population jumps to something
     like 52,000. That means that we are still  too small  to have ac-
     cess to  Sprint or  MCI or any of the discount phone services. It
     also means that we don't have TeleNet, so  no PC  Pursuit. For us
     to keep  up with  the latest  information on  our hobby/fetish we
     have been individually calling boards 100-2000 miles away  to get
     programs, read  messages and so on. The straight Fido Software is
     a very good board, for  file  transfers  its  probably  the best-
     that's  around,  (or  it  would  be with YMODEM! hint, hint). The
     person who ran the local Fido  (#447)  didn't  keep  up  with the
     NODELIST or  FidoNews. When  I uploaded  FidoNews as  a user he'd
     promptly delete and tell me it was supposed  to be  just for SYS-
     OPs.

     Then a  few months  ago I  became the  SYSOP. Three  of the first
     things I did was to update the NODELIST,  start posting FidoNews,
     and place  an advertisement  in this electronic newsletter asking
     who out there had access to files for Commodore, Apple, and Atari
     computers and  I got  some good answers. It turned out that there
     were some Fidos out  there that  had really  impressive libraries
     and SYSOPs  who were willing to help. Local people who had never-
     thought of sending messages  to other  Fidos saw  the possibility
     that by  making arrangements to send disks back and forth through
     the mail as well as using FidoNet's abilities and SERVER we could
     remain current. FidoNet had POSSIBILITIES!

     But  the  real  change  came  when Randy Bush (122/6) forwarded a
     message about starting a Commodore  Echo  group,  did  I  want to
     participate? I  asked my users and the answer was yes. So I star-
     ted in the Commodore Echo, and later with the help  of Butch Wal-
     ker (161/1) and Jim Ewald (161/8) I was also able to get into the
     TECH and SYSOP Echoes.  Suddenly the local aficionados sat up and
     saw that Fido had arrived. Here was a local board that was giving
     the user almost as good of service as  the $8/hour  people. Other
     local users  who had  other interests  looked it over and decided
     Fidonews                     Page 17                  15 Sep 1986


     that they'd like to get into some of the other Echo groups that I
     just couldn't  support and they started up their own Fido just to
     become involved in their specialties.

     I may not have made the point through all of this but  FidoNet is
     the  *ONLY*  way  any  of  this could have happened for us. We're
     years away from access to PC Pursuit or any of  the services that
     those of you that live in metropolitan areas can use. Its a great
     equalizer, a few dedicated people can  make it  work to  give the
     same service that you take for granted.

     And although  I've been talking about small towns in a geographic
     sense you should also realize that FidoNet does serve and  can do
     even more  to serve  the people  who live in other kinds of small
     worlds, the small world of a body that has more  limitations than
     most of us, the small world of predjudice and fear.  The computer
     doesn't judge anyone on their ability to walk or hear, it doesn't
     care about  the color  of someone's  skin or their sexual prefer-
     ence, you aren't going  to catch  any diseases  from reading mes-
     sages from  someone who's  sick. How  many of you who went to the
     Conference were surprised at how little the people  you had "met"
     through FidoNet  didn't look  anything like  the mental image you
     had of that person?

     I do want to continue to be a  part of  FidoNet, I'd  be happy to
     contribute as  much as  I can. I just hope that the dreamers' vi-
     sions aren't so grandiose that there's no room left for  the hob-
     byist and beginners among us.  I do appreciate ALL the people who
     have make this system work and all the writers who've created the
     system and the fabulous extensions.

                                                   Thank You

     =================================================================


     Eric Ewanco, 130/3, The AmERICan BBS, Fort Worth TX

          I would like to add public encryption and DES encryption in
     my MSGCRYPT program, but do not have the descriptions of the
     algorithms needed. I will pay $10 for up to a total of four good
     submissions of either the DES algorithm or a relatively secure
     public key encryption algorithm. Documents must be clear and
     understandable to one without a college math education, but has
     a good understanding of math and algorithms. The descriptions
     must be clear and complete, covering complete encryption given
     an ASCII key and a stream of data to an encrypted stream of
     data, and corresponding decryption algorithm; and, if necessary,
     the construction of a key for public key encryption. Source
     code, preferably C or Pascal, would be appreciated, but not
     required. Submissions may be from published material, or may be
     written by yourself. I don't care about copyrights. I will
     respect yours if you write something and declare it copyrighted,
     though.
          Payment will be made to those submissions that allow me to
     implement the described algorithm in its entirety. If I must use
     two submissions to complete my understanding of either
     algorithm, each will be paid; in other words, up to four people
     will be paid, two submitting DES, two public key. If one person
     submits both, and both are accepted, s/he will be paid double.
     Any questions, refer to 130/3. Submit via file attach or send
     to:
      Eric Ewanco
      7633 Beckwood Drive
      Fort Worth, TX 76112-6051

     Thank you.

     collection is the result of more than 15 months of intensive
     downloads  from  just about  150  or  more  BBS's  and other
     sources,  all  of  which  have  been  examined, indexed  and

     Note:  No  profit is made from the sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is applied  entirely

     lines,  running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and
     inspecting,   cataloguing,  archiving  and  maintaining  the
     files. Obtaining this software yourself through the use of a
     computer with a modem using commercial  phone  access  would
     cost you much more than what we charge for the service...

     charges.  California residents add 6% tax.
