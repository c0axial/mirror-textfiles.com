========================================================================
HeY! Your mother wears combat boots!

i don't mean that as a flame; i am a sho fetishist.

Along a similar vein, [i like the word "vein" better than 'thread' for
echos, or maybe ''tendril''] i want to apologize to someone except i
can't remember exactly to whom.  it was someone who was explaining
how free trade was a joke in chat mode.  if you are reading this,
i'm sorry i told you i had pressed a print screen button instead of
asking if i may.

i'm only realizing now that there's a difference in dimensions of
understanding of traded images (conversation, argument?) if i think
of listening and adding and giving back, as being different from
list<en>ing from a point of view.  dis-course or discourse?

Don was telling me a story about his uncle's guitar case.  He used
to watch it, while he was a kid.  It accumulated travel stickers
before his eyes, because his uncle travelled a lot and would take
the case with him and show up at his family's place sometimes.  I
liked the image because it reminded me of echos:  colourful images
sticking to leather.  Fosh at water resourses  has a great guitar
case too.

i don't really like it that the Heritage Front didn't get a node
number in 1 250, i hate the Heritage Front, but if they had a BBS i
could tell them that, is i didn't get arrested for giving them hate
literature.  The same deal allowing the evil "them" to get e-listed
is the one that allows me to tell them they are bugging me.  To
diminish or decrement the quality of freedom in any manner is to
erase the power of the individual.  God is supposed to have said
love _each_ other.  All of the American Ra-ra textbooks say that
same thing, and it seems like a good idea to me, for one.  Maybe
other countries' text books have similar ideas, but unfortunately i
have a limited knowledge of what stuff is like elsewhere, and on the
net [for me, The "net" means Fidonet, ra-ra] there is no sense of
borders.

BTW, i meant the Heritage Front that is a fascist=type org around
Kitchener.  i'm late for everything.  this renders me politically
powerless.  there was a meeting and protestors showed up and i missed
it, and wish i hadn't.  the flyer they sent around was too stupid to
be believed. Maybe it isn't as sinister as i hear, communication of
the quality of that flyer...

{chorus?}

[argument?]

Remember that BBS in Tenessee, i think it was, that was having a
hard time for "disseminating" aids info?  I'm really mad at myself
FidoNews 12-07                 Page:  3                    13 Feb 1995

for not following up on that.  Fortunately, this is only Friday.
Sigh.  I still haven't called the Cuban Embassy to see if the "get
Fidonet to Cuba" is real.  Would they tell me?  If there were
already Fido Nodes in Cuba it would be easier to find out.  I can't
even find a country prefix in the telephone book to look Cuban nodes
up in the nodelist.  If anyone has a line into Cuba, will you please
drop me a note?  What is this, Italy II?

Controlling information makes information dangerous.

   I do not enjoy the expression "information superhighway" because it
connotes linearity, duality, and crashes and speed limits.  Bletch.

   Web is nice.  Flow is nice.  Political slogans are roadsigns.  i
like taking pictures of the backs of billboards, so i can think
about the structures holding them up.

   i like echo descriptions because they're like trying to find a
book in a library with a catalogue,  i read the ones which appeal to
me, in bits, here and there, and sometimes whole books.  But i try
to be careful becuase the experience of "editing" this newsletter
has made me wary,  i want to turn it into a 'zine, and i was judging
the Rev. Steve Winter.  For all i know, Steve Winter could have a
beautiful guitar case.  i do not trust my perceptive abilities.  the
act of doubting allows me to consider more possibilities.

Skepticism YEaH!

Someone wrote to ask about an article which was either not printed
or had parts edited out and i gave a stupid reply and now i can't
find the message to respond to it again.  ouch.  if you are reading
this, i was confused about the issue when i replied and i am sorry.
i hope you write again.

while i'm on a role, i wish i had never "added" titles to articles
which came in as net mail, picking the first line and guessing part
of it was a title.  I should have put "untitled", or the writer's
name in the index and left articles as close to the original as
possible.

Anne Walker's "Six Months Rent" by Black Moss Press describes
colours, if that is useful to anyone.

Happy Valentines' Day, dear Fidonet I LOVE YOU!

Dear Editorbeings;

Please indicate that the following article is submitted by
Charles Herriot (1:163/110) who has almost recovered from
the "Close Cover Before Striking: Train Truffle Pigs In Your
Own Home" courses which he took in an effort to become a
productive member of society. Roll da' flic, Sylvia....

Swamp Swine Magazine,
Shuckmagosh, Ohio

Dear Reverend Visage,

I see that you have emerged from 40 fathoms long enough to
endorse a candidate in the Region12 RC election. "Thar she
blows!" shouted many a stalwart lad as they rowed their
longboats in pursuit. I assure you that no more than a few
of the whalers were making reference to your scantily clad
companion.

Speaking of our Regional Coordinator election, we are
obviously waiting for more hours of sunlight to fall on this
part of the world so that the current RC's solar powered
neuron can recharge enough to create a second thought in as
many months which will get the process underway. After
announcing that Tony "GMD Posterchild" Bearman would be our
returning officer, we have heard no further news. One fears
that Tony is relying upon the dubious mailer of Rick "Smart
like hockey puck" Johnston to communicate with our region.

Swamp Swine Magazine has engaged the polling and bookmaking
firm of Dubois, Shrunkel, Andjerson to track the progress of
the election. Gomer Dubois works for mere zoo kee knees.

In last month's Snooz, Donald reminded me that there are
thousands of NCs and NECs who do their job well without
becoming recklessly intoxicated with their self-assumed
powers. I agree with Don that most of them deserve our
thanks and our gratitude. If I had any pretensions to
balanced reporting, I'd be writing warm puppy stories about
NCs who serve with distinction. Unfortunately, good *Cs
don't make for interesting copy. Mercifully, the Fidogod
landscape is populated with enough savage trolls to provide
fodder for my quixotic tilting at windmills.

I have always believed that Fidonet should be a happy
anarchy. In that respect, the appointment or election of
various Fidogods should be effected from the bottom up,
instead of the Peefour-enshrined Divine Rights of Kings. I
believe that Fidogods should be granted no more power than
that biologically bestowed on bread mold. It puzzles me that
FidoNews 12-07                 Page:  5                    13 Feb 1995

the Excited States, with its fine tradition of
individuality, should be the cauldron where a totalist
structure, such as the one defined in Peefour, is tolerated.
At the very least, the Fidogods should be accountable for
the decisions that they make. To flog my favourite deceased
equine; to have someone like Bob "Bob" Satti render a policy
decision which is stupendously illogical, and then for him
to feel that the only explanation required is a few
monosyllabic grunts appended to a message; leads one to the
conclusion that he feels no responsibility towards the sysop
peasantry. Being one of the "revolting peasants", I am
thankful that the Snooz provides a medium wherein I can
assert that the emperor has no clothes.

I have another serious problem which requires immediate
attention. As you know, I chose very long odds and placed
our entire portfolio on a bet that Dan Quayle would be the
next President of the Excited States. To my horror, they
inflated Danny sufficiently for him to announce that he had
abandoned his pursuit. To cover off our losses, I placed yet
another bet and I will need help from both Snooz readers.
The nature of the bet was as follows: I asserted that Easter
Island has stone carvings which depict a peculiarly female
part of the anatomy. If anyone in Fidoland has information
which would support this claim, I'd appreciate receiving
netmail.

I must go Visage, your secretary has run amok with a salad
shooter. Her molten rage really has nothing to do with the
fact that fourteen feet of snow fell last night and her car
has eloped with a polar bear of easy virtue. As the good and
decent people that we are, we ought to send her to Holland
which is apparently plagued by "wet and unstable dykes."

New Uses of FidoNet or other big network node
by S.C.Martin Wong
(6:700/760.0@fidonet.org.martin.wong@hkmhbr.mhbrgrp.hk)

In Hong Kong, AKA is a big problem of every message-oriented BBS
because Hong Kong have a lot of Chinese language networks. If these
networks can supply different types servicefor every BBS users. Then
this is not a big problem but Hong Kong Chinese language networks
most supply same type services Different users is using different
networks. Oh! Dear! My God! How to solve this problem?
FidoNews 12-07                 Page:  6                    13 Feb 1995


Some system operator thought a good method to solve this problem.
This method is using other big networks node to transfer some
special echomail area's mail. In United State, K12 network is a good
example. In Hong Kong this method is using to transfer some idol
areas, special areas and Internet newsgroup echomail.

Discussion on Vivian Lai echo is a idol echomail area using this
method to exchange area's echomail. I think no network will accept
this echo in their official backbone because this echo is very
special idol echomail area. In Hong Kong no network will set up the
idol echo. Then we use FidoNet node to transfer this echo mail.now,
Hong Kong and Macau have about 30 members of FidoNet is connecting
this echo. In future, this echo will be UseNet newsgroup. You can
read this echo mail either FidoNet or InterNet!

Now, Hong Kong and Macau have 7 idol echos and 1 special political
echos is using this method to transfer their echomail. Some echos is
using more than 1 networks node system, some echos is using 2 or 3
networks node system! In my view, this is a good method to use your
AKA!

Everyone know network resource is limited. We use this method, we
can break the limit of AKA because this method will not spend any
AKA when you setting up or connecting every new echo. Then you can
connect another new network, supply more mail service to every users!

Another features of this method is you can supply some special echo
to your BBS users. Then users can use different type of service.
This can help Fido-type BBS development.

The most important points in this method is this method can fight
back any side effect of power struggle in a big network! For
example, in FidoNet Hong Kong is battling, more 600 nodes was
quitted. Discussion on Vivian Lai echo and discussion of Winnie Lau
echo can continue operating! This is a miracle! Why this type echo
can fight back any side effect of power struggle in a big netword
because node is not most important factor in this type echo. The
most important factor in this type echo is user and BBS! Then you
know why this type echo have enough ability to resist any bad effect
in a big network power struggle!

I think this method is a good method to set up your new echomail in
Hong Kong or countries which network is usually in war! I hope this
method can help you break the AKA limit like MS-windows help you
break MS-DOS 640KB limit!

Subject: File 3--Beta-testers : EFF-Austin Law Enforcement Incidence
Database

CALL FOR "BETA" TESTERS

             EFF-Austin Law Enforcement Incidence Database
                           January 24th, 1995

EFF-Austin is interested in creating and maintaining a database of
search and seizures involving BBS systems / Internet sites.

The intention of such a database is to:

provide a status of recent incidences of government search and
  seizures.  A file is to be opened for each raid, and then tracked as
  it's case winds it's way through the legal system.  Ex: what is the
  last we heard about the Rusty N Edie BBS case?

provide a historical record of past seizures.  People new to the Net,
  for example, need to know about the Steve Jackson Games case, and
  other important cases.

track certain trends and trouble areas for civil libertarians, such
  as computers that are seized and never returned, people who are
  raided and never indicted, and the "downsizing" of draconian tactics,
  where those who are likely to cart stuff out the door are not the
  FBI, but rather state or local law enforcement.

provide primary and secondary documentation sources for journalists,
  students, activists, law enforcement, and anyone else interested in
  these issues.

track incidences that don't generate media coverage.

                      SCHEDULE FOR IMPLEMENTATION
                              (tentative)

February --     Beta-testing : fields, forms, and designing a database
                               application accessible via gopher/Web.
                               This is about six weeks.

March   --      Start data entry on huge backlog of cases. Initial
                estimate : 150 to 200 cases to-date.

        --      Public "un-veiling" during 1995 CFP.  Important to
                have a sizeable chunk done (50 to 70 or so). Also want
                to create a "Top 10 List" of important cases.

               WHAT WE NEED NOW IN TERMS OF BETA-TESTERS

We have taken an initial stab at designing a report format that we
think will cover all the bases, do what we want it to do, and be useful.
FidoNews 12-07                 Page:  8                    13 Feb 1995


We want feedback from :

People most likely to use the database (journalists, activists,
  students, law enforcement officials, lawyers, etc.) to examine the
  reports, make suggestions, and provide feedback on what information
  you would want from such a database.

People experienced in designing databases accessible via the
  Internet.  This should be accessible via gopher and the World Wide
  Web, though we haven't selected a database engine yet.

Since EFF-Austin is a non-profit, volunteer-run organization, we will
need assistance from the entire online community in order to make this
work.  Anyone is eligible to contribute input or participate; you don't
need to live in Austin or be a member of EFF-Austin.

Send e-mail to bladex@bga.com if you have any questions, comments, or
want to join the project.

[FROM CUD 7/11/FILES 2 AND 5]

Subject: File 2--UofMich student expelled for "obscene"
         story on Net (fwd)

               ---------- Forwarded message ----------
From--jgull@umich.edu (Jason Gull)
Date--4 Feb 1995 20:14:29 GMT

The local (Ann Arbor, MI) paper ran a  story  yesterday  regarding  a
sophomore  at  the  University  of  Michigan  (whose name is Baker, I
believe) who was expelled yesterday (or Thursday) as a  result  of  a
story he "transmitted on the Internet."

The  story  the student wrote apparently involved the brutal rape and
torture of a woman.  The name of the woman in the story is  also  the
name of another student on campus, which seems to have been the spark
that got the kid kicked out.  The story seems to have been in one  of
the  alt.sex USENET groups, because according to the paper, the story
was first brought to the attention  of  University  officials  by  an
alumnus  -- an attorney in Moscow who just happened to spot the story
on USENET.  The irony of the fact  that  this  morality-policeman  in
Moscow  was scouring the alt.sex groups is apparently lost on the Ann
Arbor News.

What is truly frightening, and deserving  of  more  coverage  in  the
news,  is that the FBI is now investigating this kid, and an agent in
the local FBI office has officially stated that they're contemplating
federal   obscenity   charges  against  him.   Remember,  this  isn't
pictures/video he's accused of sending, it's purely text.   (Raunchy,
disgusting text, I'm sure, but plain 'ol ASCII).

From--Emmanuel@critical.demon.co.uk (Emmanuel Ohajah)
Subject--Internet Censorship in Africa

Dear All,

Back  in  June  1994 I wrote an article (Computer Weekly June 16 1994
Computer privacy, Highway patrol) which  was  very  critical  of  the
creeping  censorship  and  government control of computer networks in
the UK and USA

Since then I have been told that IT  experts  in  Africa  wishing  to
develop  computer networks, set up internet connections or even use a
telecommunications provider other that the  state  PTT  face  similar
obstacles  from their respective governments. What's more phone calls
are routinely monitored and satillite  access  is  restricted  or  at
least discouraged.

A  visiting  civil  rights  lawyer from Cameroon suggested to me that
many African governments do  not  want  to  see  a  proliferation  of
communications  mediums  because they will be unable to keep track of
their subjects.

I am not sure if this is true but I would appreciate details  of  any
overzealous   African  government  attempts  at  monitoring  internet
traffic or censorship of electronic communications.

If any African governments have  given  any  justifications  for  the
control  or  censorship of electronic communications please speed the
details to me!

Thanks in advance. Emmanuel Ohajah  If  you  would  like  to  see  my
article    and    other    research    then   please   mail   me   at

LINE QUALITY STANDARDS

Andrew Freeman
3:620/243
Canberra, Australia

I been in touch with AUSTEL on standards for lines - they have
produced a draft standard on this matter for Standards Australia which
is open for comment until 27 Feb 95. The reference for it is TSO27 -
to access you ring 1 800 029 955 in Australia, or +61 6 2498990 from
overseas (there is a charge for this document).

Ken Bell, the AUSTEL expert who drafted the standard indicated to
me that there is no standard required of Telecom in relation to
data transfer on Telecom voice lines at present.

I would be interested in having BBS user's from around Australia,
and more generally the world, support my preliminary view that
the final standard (the draft mainly relates to voice communications
standards) should:
 * include an element on voice line quality requirements for
   data transfer;
 * include a specific baud rate requirement - the ambit claim might
be for line to be of such a quality as to be able to consistently
maintain 14,400 bps, with 2,400 bps being a minimum requirement (in a
FidoNews 12-07                 Page: 12                    13 Feb 1995

context where most modern modems can progressively lower the speed to
2,400 bps, if %E1 is in the initialisation string, if line noise too

Subject: Letter to the Editors

Dear Editors,

I would like to see the FidoNET Policy on "Commercial Use" clarified.

FidoNET echos are not using this policy consistently.  Some echos
point to the policy and state "No commercial posts are allowed here
according to FidoNET Policy 1.3.6".  Yet other echos, especially those
based on a specific software, allow some commercial posting.

The FidoNET Forefathers, set policy on the principle of what is and is
not "Annoying".  Commercial posts are not annoying when they adhere to
Section 1.3.6;

    "FidoNET provides a convenient and effective means for companies
     and users to exchange information, to the mutual benefit of all."
.

A commercial Press Release in echo where users would find that
information of interest should be allowed.  This would include current
pricing and were to *call* for further information.  In this way the
echo is not tied up with taking orders, special price quotes, or doing
follow-ups on the order.  Which by policy is clearly annoying and not
allowed.

Many echos already allow private users to post information/price on
what they have "For Sale".  How does this differ from the commercial
user posting a Press Release/Product Information?  Both commercial and
private users should be allowed to *equally* take advantage of the
opportunities to promote their own business interest.

LINE QUALITY STANDARDS

Andrew Freeman
3:620/243
Canberra, Australia

I been in touch with AUSTEL on standards for lines - they have
produced a draft standard on this matter for Standards Australia which
is open for comment until 27 Feb 95. The reference for it is TSO27 - to
access you ring 1 800 029 955 in Australia, or +61 6 2498990 from
overseas (there is a charge for this document).

Ken Bell, the AUSTEL expert who drafted the standard indicated to
me that there is no standard required of Telecom in relation to
data transfer on Telecom voice lines at present.

I would be interested in having BBS user's from around Australia,
and more generally the world, support my
preliminary view that the final standard (the draft mainly relates to
voice communications standards) should:
 * include an element on voice line quality requirements for data
   transfer;
 * include a specific baud rate requirement - the ambit claim might be
for line to be of such a quality as to be able to consistently maintain
14,400 bps, with 2,400 bps being a minimum requirement (in a context
where most modern modems can progressively lower the speed to 2,400 bps,
if %E1 is in the initialisation string, if line noise too high, even
just obtaining the last element of the above would be a significant
improvement over the current situation).

Complaint's Filed with RC, & ZC Never Responded to within specified
time n Policy4 guidlines.

Need outside help.

By: Bob Ross
1:314/15

Please Help !!!!

Why is it that when the little guy is told to read the policy4
guidlines and follow them, that the people telling us to read
FidoNews 12-07                 Page: 15                    13 Feb 1995

them can't seem to read them either.

I have sent request's to the RC Region 15, Marv. Carson, first
was November, second was December, third was Janurary,and again
Feburary. According to Policy4 there is supose to be a responce
in 30 days.

I sent a complaint to the current RC Marv Carson about one of
his nodes 1:15/66, that no longer has a phone but still remains
listed in the node list after after being informed of this three
weeks ago. I asked that my listing be changed, and I be reistated
as a valid node or requested a Regional number since the current
NC is in the county jail serving a jail term.

Every time I send a message requesting that he step in and make
a judgment in this matter I get a message back that makes no
sence at all to do with what I sent him, or receive no responce
or being ignored to voice calls. Every time I have called voice
I am told that he is on vacation. I requested that my listing in
the node list be changed, he would reply the he didn't know I was
in the node list and never reply again to any of the previous
messages and complint's I sent him more than once. I have even
offered to re-send them again if he wanted with no reply.

I was excommunicated for talking to a user on the phone about
fileing legal carges agains't 1:15/66, he filed a complaint to
the then NC and I was removed from the node list. Then the NC
droped out and removed himself from the node list. I have been
told by the RC 1:15/0 Marv Carson, to get in touch with the NC.
I have told him the NC is in county jail, and his son is supose
to be running the net.

How can one be excommunicated from a net for talking to someone
on the phone when what I told him was true. There have been class
six felony charges filed agains't that node. Even with this proof
in hand I still can not get reinstated.

Any one know why.

Any help in this matter would help.

CaveNet -- for Cave-Related Conferences

by Bruce Bowman 1:231/710
CaveNet Echoes Available

I'm not going to waste a lot of hard drive space here -- if you are
interested in some cave-related echoes, consider connecting with the
CaveNet conferences.

CaveNet is gated into Fido by me (Bruce Bowman) at 1:231/710. There
is no distribution system, nor is it on the backbone. Until traffic

increases, you will have to poll me for mail. Several of the echoes
are gated to Internet mailing lists, as indicated by the * below.
If interested, send me netmail giving me a session password and what
echoes you want to carry. There are currently no file echoes.

1) I do NOT have areafix or an equivalent set up, so if you send me
a message of this nature it will be ignored. I can do a rescan
for you if you ask me to.
2) I currently make a mail run every Tuesday, so it would be best to
poll me on Wednesday -- your mail will be waiting on hold for you.
3) Please poll at least once a week.
4) Do not hub the mail to others without prior approval, or your
feed will be cut.
5) Don't be a jerk -- flamefests are mercilessly stifled.

If traffic increases, so will the frequency of mail exchanges, and
we might even get on the backbone. See the latest echolist in the
CN_* section for more information. That is all...

Is Fido becoming atheist-only?

A Russian reader amazed by atheism in snooze
by Mikhail Ramendik, 2:5020/261.10,ramen@pccross.msk.su

In many articles in the recent issues of FidoNews, there are ads of
anti-religious echo conferences and even open flame against
Christianity.

Well, perhaps in the American custom it is okay. Reading it here in
Russia, I wondered if the Net was entirely overtaken by active
atheists, or the Christian sysops were simply too lazy to answer.

The 'last bite' that made me write this was an article 'from Michael
Johnson' in No.5. The word 'f&^k' was actually used without special
characters, not only preventing SysOps from reading the snoozie to
their girlfriends, but openly insulting all the community!

Too bad I can not get a reliable feed of the z1 backbone here.
FidoNews 12-07                 Page: 17                    13 Feb 1995

Otherwise I'd answer all the atheistic nonsense, because we
have heard it here from the Communist government for 75 years!
Atheism is indeed the source of communism, and communism acknowledges
this. So there is probably nothing the atheists can invent to attack
Christianity that the Russians do not know very well. Oh, if only
I had the feed...

So I'd like to know - is FidoNet officially atheist-only? If not, is
religious discussion in the snooze okay? If yes, I'll be answering the
atheists there. For we in Russia have seen the consequences of atheism.
75 years of technical stagnation, millions of martyred people, and a
world war - this is what we paid for atheism! And personally I do not
want my fellow Fidonetters to pay the same price.
