     This week I finally broke down and changed ARTSPEC.DOC to reflect
     the way that things actually happen around the newsroom these
     days. I hope this helps make things clearer, without losing all
     of the flavor of Thom's document.

     I'm publishing it here in its entirety as the fastest means of
     distributing it. Obviously, it will also be available from 1:1/1
     as ARTSPEC.DOC.

     Cheers,

     FidoNews is the user group newsletter of the users of the
     FidoNet(R) remote bulletin board network.  As of this writing it
     has an estimated readership of over two hundred thousand people
     worldwide.  In keeping with the nature of FidoNet, FidoNews is
     an electronic newsletter which is passed from node to node over
     the network.  All of the articles which appear in FidoNews are
     written or submitted by users of FidoNet. FidoNews is very much
     an electronic newsletter by, of, and for Fido users and sysops.
     This document describes the technical aspects of submitting an
     article to FidoNews.

     INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

     FidoNews is assembled in a completely manual process each week.
     Every Sunday evening the Editor runs a special utility called
     MAKENEWS, which puts together the various articles which have
     been received and generates the latest issue. The resulting file
     is sent out using HATCH to 1:1/0, who passes it on to the Region
     1 Coordinators using the TICK program. It is also placed in the
     download/file request area of FidoNet node 1:1/1, both in
     compressed form (FNEWSxxx.LZH) and uncompressed form
     (FIDOxxx.NWS).

     In practice, the primary purpose of the MAKENEWS utility is to
     scan the articles which have been submitted for any technical
     disqualifications.  If MAKENEWS finds an article which does not
     meet its technical specs, then a message is logged and that
     article is not included in the newsletter.  At this point the
     article must be modified by hand until it passes the technical
     requirements.  Since this is dependent on the availability of
     human resources, then an article which fails to meet the specs
     may be delayed indefinitely, or even cancelled entirely.

     It's important to note here that the FidoNews Editor is not
     responsible for such cleanup. Although on occasion he or she may
     in fact undertake to do so, there are no guarantees that a
     non-conforming article will ever be published in FidoNews, nor
     is it necessarily the responsibility of the Editor to even
     correspond with the author of non-conforming material.

     Much of this document is intended to describe the technical
     specifications which an article must meet in order to be
     included in the newsletter. Please read it carefully. The
     article you save might be your own.


     SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE

     The first step, of course, is to create a file which contains the
     text of your article.  You should then send the file via FidoNet
     mail to node 1:1/1.

     Filename extensions are used to distinguish types of submissions,
     as follows:

     FidoNews 7-42                Page 3                   15 Oct 1990


         .ART      An article, commentary, open letter, or general
                   news item.

         .COL      A column, or other regular feature.

         .LET      Letters to the Editor.

         .SAL      A "For Sale" advertisement.

         .WAN      A "Wanted" advertisement.

         .NOT      A notice for the back of the issue.

     If your file doesn't have one of the above extensions, then it
     will lay around taking up disk space until some human takes a
     look at it and realizes what it is.

     The name of the file is up to you, though you should use a name
     which is not likely to be "stepped on" by someone else.  For
     example, FNEWS.ART is probably not a good name for an article.


     If you are writing a regular feature, such as a column or a
     series of articles, you can put a number at the end of the name,
     and submit several in a batch.  For example, you could send in a
     set of five files, named:

          MYWORD1.COL
          MYWORD2.COL
          MYWORD3.COL
          MYWORD4.COL
          MYWORD5.COL

     These would be used one at a time in sequence.  MYWORD1.COL would
     be printed the first week, MYWORD2.COL the second, and so on.


     TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

     This section describes the technical requirements which an
     article must pass before the MAKENEWS utility will include it in
     FidoNews.  If your file does not meet these criteria, then,
     again, it will languish on the disk until some human happens to
     notice, and fixes it.

     These constraints are for purely practical reasons.  There are
     roughly a million different word processors out there, all with
     their own different formats.  We simply do not have the time to
     convert them all to the format we use.

     1. FLUSH LEFT MARGIN:  The finished FidoNews is indented five
     FidoNews 7-42                Page 4                   15 Oct 1990


        columns. We do that here.  If your submission is also
        indented, then your indent will be added to ours.  So please
        set your left margin all the way at the edge of the screen.

     2. RIGHT MARGIN AT COLUMN 65 OR LESS:  Less is tolerable, more is
        definitely not.

     3. NO FUNNY CHARACTERS:  This includes formfeeds, returns without
        linefeeds, linefeeds without returns, tabs and other oddities.

     4. NO GRAPHICS CHARACTERS:  Believe it or not, not everyone in
        the world has an IBM PC.  Please restrict yourself to
        printable ASCII characters in the range 20 hex to 7E hex
        (space to tilde).

        However, if you are using PC-Write to create your file, then
        feel free to use the "hard space", "hard hyphen", and "soft
        hyphen" characters.  MAKENEWS understands them, and will
        handle them properly.

     5. TOTAL ARTICLE LENGTH:  Well, there IS an upper limit, but
        we're not going to say what it is, because:

        a) it's pretty big,
        b) it changes from time to time, and
        c) we override it now and then, as the circumstances merit.

        Advertisements and notices are an exception.  Since we don't
        charge for ads, we feel justified in limiting them.  The
        maximum length of an advertisement is rather small (never more
        than one page).

     6. WHERE IS THIS ARTICLE FROM:  A good question!  You can submit
        an article anonymously if you want to, but most folks start
        out by stating their name and node number. You are encouraged
        to do so, as any article which requires verification will be
        automatically discarded if the author/submitter cannot be
        reached.

     If you want your article to be listed in the table of contents,
     then you should start it with a "content line".  This is just a
     normal line, except that it is the FIRST line of your file, and
     it begins with an asterisk ("*").  Here's an example of a
     content line:

         * My Word!


     EXAMPLE

     Here's a sample of what a typical submission might look like:

     FidoNews 7-42                Page 5                   15 Oct 1990


     * A Sample Article
     FidoNews Editor
     FidoNet 1:1/1

                              This Is My Title


     And here is my article.  Note that it is flush left (zero
     indent).  Also note that the right margin is at column sixty
     five, so that the result will look good when the formatter sets
     it up.  We also started the file with a content line, so my
     article will be listed in the table of contents.

         Figure 1.               Table 1.
         +-------+               ========
         | A Box |               Alfa
         +-------+               Bravo

     Note that we am not using any funny characters.  This ensures
     that the final article will look the same to every user, no
     matter what sort of hardware he has.

     This is the last sentence of our article.


     And that's all there is to it!  You should be able to get a file
     like this out of any word processor.


     FORMATTING ADVICE

     There are certain things you should do to improve the general
     appearance of your article when it is published.  After all, two
     hundred thousand of your fellow users will be looking at it.  You
     want it to look good, don't you?

     You may have noticed that FidoNews articles are separated by
     dashed lines.  These are inserted by MAKENEWS, so you shouldn't
     add them yourself.  If you put a dashed line at the top and/or
     bottom of your article, then it will appear right next to the
     dashed line MAKENEWS inserts.  Since your line is almost certain
     to be a different length, then the result will not look very
     good.

     You should also put a blank line between paragraphs.  This sets
     them off better than just indenting the first line, and makes
     you article easier to read.

     You should not, however, put a lot of blank space at the top or
     bottom of your article.  MAKENEWS works hard to make sure that
     the articles are well separated to the eye, so any space you add
     at the ends will just waste paper when someone prints out the
     news.

     FidoNews 7-42                Page 6                   15 Oct 1990


     If you want to put in a table or a figure, go right ahead.
     MAKENEWS does not rearrange text, so your table or figure will
     remain exactly as you entered it.

     If you want to justify the right margin, please feel free.  You
     may also leave it ragged if you wish.  An even right margin
     looks neater, while a ragged margin makes for text that is
     easier to read.  We've been told that an even right margin is
     really just a gimmick, since typesetters don't really do it that
     way, but you decide for yourself.


     OTHER ADVICE

     The biggest thing we see, the thing that irks us most, is when
     someone submits an article that is full of basic errors in
     spelling, grammar, and/or punctuation.  Please remember, two
     hundred thousand people will be reading what you write.  Please,
     for your own sake, use a dictionary when you're not sure how a
     word is spelled.  Or, if you're not good at grammar, get a
     friend to help you write your article.  We ain't the Literary
     Digest here, and our standards are pretty (very) lax.  If you're
     willing to write it, we'll put it in.  It's just that it's in
     your own best interest to come off looking good.


     EDITORIAL CONTENT

     We suppose we should say something about article content.
     Basically, it's up to you.  As we've stated many times, FidoNews
     isn't ours, it's yours.  We will publish anything we receive
     that doesn't seem to cause any legal quandaries for us.  Most
     articles tend to be related in some way to personal computing,
     but that is by no means a requirement on our part.


     WHEN WILL YOUR ARTICLE APPEAR

     A good question indeed, and almost impossible to answer.

     First of all, whether an article is published or not is MOSTLY
     dependent on whether it meets the criteria mentioned above. If
     they do not, then you're subject to the whim of the Editor.
     That's usually OK, but everyone has their bad days. You may
     never see your badly formatted article in FidoNews.

     As for timing: At one time, the editorial staff attempted to keep
     the size of the newsletter reasonably consistent by delaying
     publication of some articles from weeks of heavy submissions,
     printing them a week or so later. When the week or so of low
     submission volume came along, the newsletter was filled out with
     material that had been submitted the week or so before. This
     became extremely difficult during some protracted periods of
     extremely high volumes of submissions, and we dropped the policy
     entirely when sufficient people objected.

     FidoNews 7-42                Page 7                   15 Oct 1990


     By and large, everything submitted by Saturday night will make
     the FidoNews sent out Sunday night. Often, submissions received
     as late as sometime Sunday afternoon will make their way into
     that week's edition.

     There are good and bad aspects to this policy of printing stuff
     right away. What's good about it is that everyone can time their
     stuff to be published at the time they consider most
     appropriate. What's bad about it is that articles seem to arrive
     here in "spurts".  We might get two articles one week, and then
     twenty the next.  Because we print everything received in each
     cycle, it's entirely possible, and even somewhat likely, that
     you could get a fifty page newsletter one week, and a two page
     newsletter the next.


     YOUR TURN

     That's enough from us for now. Now it's YOUR turn to sit down
     and write that article you're thinking about!  Best wishes, and
     good luck!

     Press Release - Distribute Everywhere - The Brigadoon Weyr Group

     There's a new improved consortium of telecommunications
     enthusiasts in the works, recalling the good old days of
     Dada, Discordianism, searching for the Truth, hippie communes,
     and guerilla ontology, and it is known as...

                       The Brigadoon Weyr Group

     The Brigadoon Weyr Group is open to any computer system that is

     the hobby of telecommunicating for the fun of it; whatever is

     systems is welcome to join. The Brigadoon Weyr Group will
     remain very unstructured; it is up to the people linking to

     and enjoy the same fun you mere mortals are enjoying, without
     the responsibility and awesome power of network topology handling.

     The Brigadoon Weyr Group is devoted to the weirder things in
     life -- fringe groups, nonstandard religions, Elvis searchers,
     cult movies, bad audio and video, and certified maniacs and
     politicians.  It is the goal of The Brigadoon Weyr Group in its
     "psychological experiment to allow us to complete a doctorate in
     psychology" mode to allow the weird, the odd, the huddled

     espouse their varied belief systems. It is a network of losers,
     winners, dreamers, screamers.

     Feel free to pick up any or all of these echos -- via negotia-
     tions with the system of your choice.  The ONLY thing we
     requests of Brigadoon Weyr postings is that they follow common-
     sense rules of echo procedure, whatever those are.  The big
     things are staying on topic in the specific base, and allowing
     access to BW_PARACITY to people strong or old enough to handle it.

     We make no distinctions as to age, background, religion, sex,
     gender, et cetera.  We are an Equal Opportunity Network, limited
     solely by the ability to move echomail around in a reasonably
     good manner.  Problems with offending nodes will be dealt with
     via the path structure of the network until it reaches The
     Brigadoon Weyr Group Central (1:325/101) where we will deal with
     it as need be.

     A rough topology map will be compiled monthly to give The
     Brigadoon Weyr Group users an idea of who gets the net from
     whom, and for new users to have an idea where to plug in.

     In closing, I point out that we are all of us doing this as a
     hobby, and will tolerate no politics or powerplays.  I hope to
     keep The Brigadoon Weyr Group open and free for all by dealing
     with problems as they arise. It is my hope that official
     regulations and policies will not be needed, to the enjoyment
     and betterment of all concerned.

     *CADNet* has been in operation since June 1990 and is an
     Exciting New Distribution Network For CAD/CAD-CAM and AutoCAD
     Support Utilities, Newsletters and Shareware Programs. We are
     Not Directly Affiliated with AutoDesk or any other Commercial
     CAD Software Companies.  Many of us are Users though. Through
     the Network we can share the latest in AutoLisp, shareware
     programs and utilities for AutoCAD, drawings, slides libraries,
     fonts and shape files, and electronic CAD magazines. We can
     stay in touch directly with a *CADNet* Member specific Echo
     Conference called CAD_NET.
     As a SysOp the first thing you will need to do is find a direct
     link into the Network. As the Network grows it will become
     easier to do. I apologize in advance if it is going to be an
     additional long distance connect. But, it will be well worth
     it to be able to share CAD support files among others.

     First of all you will need to get TICK by Barry Geller (latest
     Version TICK200.LZH). Tick is the utility used to "Echo" files
     among the Network. If you do not have a linkup point you may
     link with The DawgByte at up to 14.4 USR HST @ FidoNet 1:116/29.
     Should you need to Drop a note to the Dawg Byte's RAID (RAID is
     an AreaFix for File Echos - Dawg Byte Does run a "OpenSystem"

     As a member of *CADNet* you may pick up from any it's members
     that will allow "connection" into the Network. But first please
     take time out and get your info into *CADNet* headquarters so we
     have a current membership list at all times also be sure to
     introduce yourself in the CAD_NET echo conference. This confer-

     In FidoNews 7-40, we are treated to  someones opinion about the
     media motivated circus: Abortion.  The debate still rages on in
     every city, and now, in FidoNews. The other debate, if FidoNews
     should print _everything_ it receives, has been discussed a lot
     in the past four or five years. We also got a lot of ecological
     enlightenment in the past month.

     When I wrote directly to  1:3800/6.0 about wasting SysOps money
     by distributing hate through FidoNews, I was informed in return
     mail that the SysOp simply  submitted the article uploaded by a
     user. Basically, the SysOp refused responsibility for it.

     To my mind,  FidoNews  should  be  technically  motivated,  not
     politically,  economically,  and not  repeating what  the media
     chooses to hand to the public; We get enough of that every day.

     I would like to submit  to the FidoNet community  at large that
     a debate be opened in the newly created FidoNews echo NEWSCHAT,
     currently available from 1:369/21 or  1:135/36.  If provided on
     the  backbone, all  SysOps could offer comments and suggestions
     to what exactly FidoNews is  about and after  a peroid of time,
     take  measure  of  option, pass  a vote,  and rework  or retain
     FidoNews policy based on the conferenced findings.

     One of the reasons we have  had the network  split into several
     parts is due to the political orientation FidoNet has taken on.
     We need to _all_  determine what  FidoNews should contain,  and
     not  let just a few crack pots and religious  zealots determine
     it for us.

     1:322/337


          Overall, I agree with the policy. It makes sense.  But
     I do have a few items that should be changed:

          More than a few months should be given to testing the
     policy in action. The events that fall under the
     jurisdiction of the document do not occur all that often
     such as a new moderator being implemented or a coordinator
     position changing hands.

          It not should be the *C's and the *EC's who vote for a
     new conference moderator, but the sysops who carry the
     conference.  Some backbone echos are not read by the
     coordinators.  It should be the sysops who carry the echo
     and have been monitoring and participating that get to vote.

          I agree with the policy that the coordinators should be
     the ones who do the final voting when it comes to electing
     new coordinators, but the voting time should be extended to
     allow the Coordinators to discuss the upcoming vote with the
     regular members who hold no coordinator position.  I know it
     is important that position changes be done as swiftly and
     smoothly as possible, but the membership as a whole will
     have to be dealing with these people, so let them have some
     say.  Possibly we should use the same voting method used in
     government- let the general membership report their opinions
     and votes to the NC or NEC if that member is in a net or to
     the RC or REC if he or she is independent. Then let the
     coordinators be delegates and represent the view of his
     sysops as a whole. It would be a shame to have the sysops of
     a net want to impeach a coordinator, not because he does his
     job improperly, but because he doesn't represent the views
     of the sysops under him when it comes to elections.  I know
     that many coordinators would consult with their sysops under
     them, but it should be included for those who do not.  In
     emergencies where a new coordinator is needed immediately
     there should be a provision for someone to be the acting
     coordinator until a permanent one can be voted in.

          My main grudge is the paragraph about paying for
     echos:

     5.  CHARGING FOR DISTRIBUTION:  Any entity which
     makes a profit from the distribution (passing from
     system to system) of echomail shall be deemed to be
     excessively annoying and in violation of Fidonet
     policy subject to enforcement under existing
     Fidonet policy.  Profit as defined in this
     paragraph is the charging for echomail distribution
     that exceeds actual cost to obtain and distribute
     the Echomail over a sustained period.  The cost of
     the equipment used to obtain and distribute
     echomail may only be recovered on a strictly
     FidoNews 7-42                Page 19                  15 Oct 1990


     voluntary basis.  A Sysop that charges users for
     access to their BBS shall NOT be in violation of
     this paragraph.


          Exactly what is that last sentence supposed to mean?
     Sysops who regularly charge their users may exclude
     themselves from the rules of the paragraph or they must make
     sure that they follow the rules like anyone else? Or does it
     mean something else?  Charging for echos is an important
     subject.  More than 4 sentences should be spent on this. I
     think that a standard should be made and included in this
     paragraph.

          Maybe some different scenarios for charging for echoes
     should be included rather than leaving the scenario up to
     whoever wants to implement it.  I recommend placing a daily
     price on each echo. But what should the terminal nodes be
     charged for? The cost of the stars working together + the
     cost of the REC getting it off the nearest star + the cost
     of getting it from the REC to the NEC to the local hub would
     be difficult to compute into a value that each sysop that
     subscribes to the echo should pay.

          If I was on a regional border, I may prefer to call to
     a node that is a local call in a another region where
     echomail is free rather than pay toll fees to a coordinator
     in my own region.  Sort of like the Massachusetts liquor
     tax- Buying liquor just over the New Hampshire border
     without the tax rather than buying it here in Massachusetts
     where we have to pay the tax. What do you do with people
     like that?  Do you leave it up to the REC's of the two
     regions or the NEC's of the two nets? Is it to be allowed?
     If it is, then the regional than net borders as far as
     echomail is concerned will not be so definitive.  And what
     is to be done if we can call long distance to a toll free
     region for less than is charged by the coordinators of the
     local region.  My personal view is that asking for help with
     the phone bills is OK.  Voluntarily paying is OK. But to let
     someone take their phone bill and divide it by the number of
     sysops in the net or region is absurd. I don't want to pay
     for echoes I don't carry. Charging for the echoes becomes a
     chore and then people start whining, "You charge him a
     dollar less because he doesn't carry this one heavy volume
     echo." What a mess and trouble these people who charge for
     echoes will be getting into. And how do the people he is
     charging monitor exactly what is the phone time being used
     for? What if they are being charged for a ton of Netmail?

          I am against charging for echomail. This is a hobby,
     not a job. If I had to pay for my echomail, the money
     wouldn't come from me, I'd begin to charge my users. Isn't
     that against the idea of fidonet? We don't want this to
     become like Compuserve or Prodigy where everything is toll.
     I understand that there is a whole huge phone bill that is
     not being evenly distributed. But how difficult it is to
     FidoNews 7-42                Page 20                  15 Oct 1990


     make up a separate price for everyone based upon how much it
     costs to get them echomail and the volume of the echos they
     carry.  It is unfair to say, "Let the coordinators pay for
     it." But in a few years after I come out of college, I plan
     on buying a system that can handle the heavy volume of mail
     that a coordinators system must handle. At that time, I may
     want to give a coordinator a rest and wear his hat. I would
     be willing to foot the bill for my own system and only have
     sysops under me pay for the costs of getting the mail from
     my system to theirs, not the cost of getting it from my
     system to the system on the level above me.

          The best way to charge for echomail is to have each
     sysop pay for the cost of getting the mail to and from the
     system at a higher level. This means that non-coordinators
     must pay the bill from the NEC or REC or hub to his system.
     The hub pays for the bill from his system to the NEC. The
     NEC pays for the link between his system and the REC. The
     REC pays for his link to the nearest star. The stars pay
     their own way.

          Under this system, if a link is local, then the lower
     system pays nothing. If a link is toll, then the lower
     system pays the bill.

          What if a lower system can't afford it and would like
     to charge the systems at a lower level. I am against
     monetary charging because it is difficult to compute fairly.
     Why not instead rotate hubs every 3 months or so. Make 4
     areas.bbs files (or your system's equivalent) and 4 routing
     files- one for each season. Then pick the 4 largest systems
     to take turns at hubbing. Every time a season changes, all
     the sysops in the net or region change the file to the one
     for the season. No money involved and the yearly cost is
     still divided among 4 systems as evenly as if monetary
     charges were being sent around.

          I'd like to hear some feedback on the following
          subjects:
          My idea of a rotating hub.
          Different Methods of charging.

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9010.14..."
     by Phil Buonomo, 1:107/583@FidoNet 520/583@AlterNet 9:807/1@PNet

     It's been a number of months since I've written here, and a lot
     has happened since that time.

     Originally I stopped writing a regular column because I was so
     busy working on the Conclave '90 convention that we held in
     August in New Jersey.  It was a lot of fun and a lot of hard
     work, but it was worth it.

     God knows that this hobby of ours brings us a lot of
     satisfaction and a lot of aggravation.  Just like any love
     affair, I think there's a lot to be said for the love-hate
     relationship of what we do.  Everybody's made friends and
     enemies through this electronic medium of ours.  The lucky ones
     make more of the former, and fewer of the latter.

     It's a lot like life, I think.

     However, as many have pointed out before me, this is fantasy,
     whereas life is reality, and sometimes life has a way of
     reaching out and reminding us of what's important.  Hurricane
     Hugo did that for many of us last year when one of our own lost
     his home to the ravages of that storm.

     I met a lot of folks at Conclave '90, some of whom I had only
     corresponded with.  I also met someone there who made a big
     impression on me, someone who delighted in teasing me and making
     me uncomfortable, but all in a good naturedly way.  I enjoyed
     that person's company very much, and looked forward to seeing
     them again someday.

     Well, reality intruded on my fantasy today about 20 minutes ago
     when, in the course of my reading echomail, I saw that they'd
     died suddenly.  I will never get to meet that person again.
     That person is gone forever, unless I am lucky enough to meet
     them again 'on the other side'.

     Let me just say that in the little time I knew my friend, I
     learned what a warm hearted, good person they truly were.  I
     shall miss that person very much, and grieve along with those
     that have been left behind.

     For a brief time, my friend brought joy to my life.  I hope that
     person is happy once again now, wherever they are.

     And I hope that when I next sit down to do this activity again,
     I will remember to keep my priorities straight, and remember
     what is truly important in life.

     Good-bye, my friend.

     Sincerely,

     Philip J. Buonomo

     My God, It's Full of Stars --

     Our little net of the woods selected a new RC, REC, and NC this
     past month.  We got some real buttheads in office now...  Just
     thought I'd poke the embers with a stick one last time.

     I actually ran for the RC position, garnering the fewest votes
     of any candidate.  The whole election was rigged because the
     incumbent RC decided to run for re-election. It'll cost me a
     bundle in psychiatric fees to get over this one.

     In conjunction with that vote, the RC called for the election
     of the REC, and our incumbent REC was not at all amused.  This
     led to flames of the 'Hell Fire' proportion, much policy
     disputing and general shakeout of the regional echomail
     operation in the 'Maximum Volume Load Test'.  ( It works ! )

     A policy complaint over the REC solicited the opinion of the
     ZC, no less, which is the main reason you read the Echomail
     Policy last week in Fidonews.  After electing the RC and REC,
     by a majority of votes tendered, the sysops of Region 19 are
     probably not going to appreciate the movement toward
     'old-boy-ism' touted by the new policy's selection process.

     On that same ballot were two regional echomail policies to
     choose from, neither garnered enough votes to warrant
     implementation.  Interesting result.

     On a much lighter note, our NC selection process was a model of
     interpersonal concern.  At our monthly Pizza Party, we read
     from the absentees mailings, narrowed the nominees, agreed on
     one unanimously and got back to the important stuff ( pizza and
     beer ).  It took all of 30 minutes.  None of this 6 week
     campaign-netmail-password stuff.  It was great.
     Congratulations Bryny and to all of Net 124.

     One interesting side note on the idea of participation in these
     Fidonet proceedings.  I suggest that a sysop in Fidonet not
     only run Net Mail Hour, but also respond personally to a
     quarterly poll from the net Host, as a condition of keeping
     his/her node number.  I'm sick of the "simple majority -
     majority of sysops" arguments.  Let's make this one and the
     same.  It's redickalust to see a 30% participation rate.


     Mini-Blinds --

     Oracle won't run in Windows Enhanced mode.  It will run in
     Desqview.  QEMM didn't help.  More upgrades to follow.  Let's
     see : write software, sell for 50.  Upgrade three times for 20
     each.  Which is more profitable ?  If you run the kernel as
     machine type J ( expanded memory ), you get the error "No
     VPCI".  If you run it as type 2 ( extended memory ), you get
     the error "Can't get memory", which is to say the XMS driver (
     QEMM ) won't give it up.  There was one other configuration I
     tried and Windows threw up the "Can't run protected mode app in
     enhanced mode".

     ORA_DBMS is a new backbone echo, re. anything at all to do with
     Oracle and Relational Databases.  Check it out.

     (Super PC Kwik Information Bulletin)
     Windows 3.0 and QEMM 5.11 : we have found that some people seem
     to be able to cache extended memory, but we can't cache
     expanded memory.  Okay to use "loadhi" with this combination.

     I don't think I want to 'seem' to able to cache.

     Why is that Windows SDK box still unopened ? That Zoom utility
     is fun. Open it up to about 9/10s of the screen size and move
     the whole window around. Zoom zooms itself !  I'm quite sure
     the Spy icon is the same character as those Spy vs. Spy guys
     from Mad magazine.  Of course, they're a rip off of Heckel and
     Jeckel.  We already had clip-art wars, now I guess it's time
     for icon copyright wars.

     On the subject of metaphors ( aren't I always on that
     subject ) :  I want a metaphor modifier feature.  Like the
     ability to change color combinations, the GUI user wants to
     alter his desktop operation in a procedural way.  For example :
     deleting a file.  On the MAC you have that Basketball metaphor,
     where the file is slam dunked into a basket. ( So what ?! )  I
     want a World Politics motif where my file becomes a terrorist
     camp and I drag in an F-16 to blow it away.  I want a Surgeon
     motif to rename a file ( you figure it out ).  Instead of
     highlighting, I want Thor's hammer to strike a lightning bolt
     to start an application.
