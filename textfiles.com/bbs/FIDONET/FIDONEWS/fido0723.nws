                             A Sysop's Sorrow
                (an overdue public apology to Tracy Graves)


     In the course of cleaning up and shutting down my BBS after more
     than 3 years of operation, there are several things left undone
     which I have found surfacing and needing to be handled. One of
     them, long left unfinished, is the subject of this article.

     Two and a half years ago, I did what I thought was necessary for
     the well-being of my region. I took actions, I said words, which
     brought about a great deal of disharmony to my little corner of
     FidoNet. I, in effect, ran roughshod over the feelings, honor,
     trust, and dignity of a fellow sysop, Tracy Graves. Though the
     rift and commotion eventually settled down within our region,
     the effect and injustice committed has remained unacknowledged
     and somewhat repressed by me. As a whole, region 17 got back to
     business-as-usual, but the pain and sorrow persists for some of
     us to this day. Others found excuses, justifications, perfectly
     good-sounding reasons for things having occurred as they did,
     but I have personally remained haunted by my memories and
     impressions of what I did, and particularly 'how' I did it.

     In 1987 I set in motion events which led to the harm of someone
     else in FidoNet. Whether the end result was justified or not,
     nothing really justifies my methodology, my means.

     So, this article is a public apology to Tracy Graves, for the
     events and actions I was part of in 1987. During that time I
     asked Tracy to resign as REC of region 17, and I initiated
     conditions that took the freedom of choice from him. This was
     certainly very cruel, not excusable, and evil in nature. To
     compound this, I forced the issue at a time when Tracy was
     unable to defend himself to the best of his abilities. I am
     fully guilty and culpable for the damage that I did to Tracy,
     and I have harmed myself by not publicly acknowledging that this
     was a conscious choice on my part, not a necessity. Of an
     infinite number of ways we could have interacted, I chose the
     worst, probably the most despicable method.

     I'll say this to FidoNet: EchoMail, our worldwide network, our
     obsession with the 'flow of mail' - isn't worth hurting or
     disgracing anyone. It isn't worth anything if we harm others in
     the process. The guilt will silently eat you alive, as it has
     done to me in many ways, until it is ultimately confronted and
     honestly acknowledged as the remorse that it is for making a
     brutal and harmful choice.

     FidoNews 7-23                Page 2                    4 Jun 1990


     No healing, no recovery, no exorcism will ever absolve you (or
     me) of the responsibility for our actions. When you're angry,
     when you're desperate to be 'right', be darn sure that you don't
     do violence to the reputation and feelings of another, don't
     blame someone else for your actions, or for your reactions.
     That's a lie that will live inside you, and consume your
     humanity, until you find yourself actually justifying the damage
     that you did. Oh yes, you'll be proudly self-righteous, but
     empty. You'll ignore the injury that you caused - as I did.
     You'll loose trust in yourself, and for good reason. You aren't
     trustworthy if you don't let your conscience guide you to taking
     positive and creative actions.

     Whatever you want FidoNet to be, it isn't ever worth
     assasinating the character of another human being. It cheapens
     you and your 'cause'. Look at what all the flames (pro and con)
     did to IFNA's chances of ever serving and growing with FidoNet.

     So, I come here to publicly apologize to Tracy Graves, a person
     who once trusted me as his friend. I'm not trying to erase the
     damage and acrimony that I caused. I am here to acknowledge my
     own inadequacy at the time, to denote my errors, and to free my
     quiet shame, so that I can fully possess the guilt that I
     created and deserve.

     John Bradshaw says, "The only sorrow is the sorrow of not being
     a saint." I have carried my sorrow and shame for two and a half
     years - like the razor blade that I once carried in my pocket as
     a child. Not knowing the consequences, thinking that I could
     cause no real harm, yet bleeding privately and not seeing why I
     was becoming so weak, so unsure of my abilities. I became
     ashamed of myself, thinking that there was something 'wrong'
     with me, instead of seeing that I was simply guilty of making a
     terrible and barbaric mistake.

     Now I can have the quiet truth and guilt of my errors, and
     Tracy, you now have a very public apology. You were the first
     REC to bring a well structured echomail system to our region.
     You took great risks, endured much criticism, yet you were fair
     to all, and you went far beyond the call of duty. Your
     volunterism and commitment to community service stands today as
     the epitomy of what makes FidoNet really work. You truly
     deserved so much better than to be betrayed and slandered by
     myself and others.

     My long lost friend... I will always miss you.

       I   have  started  a  new  message  echo  area  for  electronic
     publishing  and writing.  This echo will not interfere  with  the
     current  operation  of the National Writers  echo  (WRITING).  My
     intention is to fill some gaps left by the WRITING echo and other
     echo areas dealing with publishing or writing.

          This  echo is not exclusively for electronic publishers.  It
     is  for new writers or anyone interested in  self-publishing.  If
     you have an interest in publishing your work electronically, your
     local  sysop  can  help you.  There is  now  little  support  for
     electronic publishing.  I say  electronic publishing works.  Your
     reading this newsletter proves my point.

          Sony recently announced the latest entry into the electronic
     gadget  field.  The  "Data  Discman" -- a portable  compact  disc
     player  that  displays written text on a  tiny  screen.  It  uses
     three-inch  compact discs called "Electronic Books." Each disc is
     capable  of  storing  more than 100,000 pages  of  text,  or  the
     equivalent of some 300 paperback books.  The "Data Discman"  hits
     the Japanese store shelves in July.

          The echo name will be EPWG;  the guidelines are in draft and
     sent  to various supporters of electronic publishing to get their
     feedback.  They should be available within the next three or four
     weeks.

          If you do not have net mail capability,  you may get them by
     calling 1-505-865-8385 (data-BBS).

          If  you would like to get connected,  you may contact me  on
     node 301/1 or Robert King on 370/40.

                                Announces!

                             Short Story Disk

          Electronic publishing is about to take a leap into the lives
     of  every computer user in the world.   Many of us have not  been
     aware   of  electronic publishing.    The biggest thing has  been
     the  limited  places  from which true  electronically   published
     items have been available.

          On 25 May 1990,  High Mesa Publishing will introduce a Short
     Story   Disk,   this   disk  will  contain  short  stories  never
     published.   This is not an experiment, long range plans call for
     a   minimum   of   one   (1)   disk  published   monthly.    With
     additional   submissions of works by writers this will expand  to
     as   many  disk as necessary to provide  coverage   of   received
     material.

          For   many   years   now,    we  have  read   things   using
     computers and never give a dedicated publishing aspect one single
     thought.  News letters, and messages get read every single day by
     several  hundred thousand readers.   Even some of the larger news
     papers like USA Today get read electronically.   So  our question
     has  been  why not books,   magazines,  and  even  short stories.
     Here at HMP we electronically publish our works in IBM executable
     format.

          We   now  have   a  monthly   Diskazine   titled,   Computer
     Information   Monthly  News  or  CIMN for  short.    It   is   an
     IBM compatible  computer program.    Cimn is  in the sixth  month
     of publishing,  with  the May issue dedicated  to publishing  and
     writing on computers.   The issue for  June  will cover  some  of
     the  places  around the country  where  electronic publishing  is
     now taking place.

          With the introduction of Short Story Disk,  we are taking  a
     step into a new area.   We are not the first but our intention is
     to  become one of the leading electronic publishers.   A  current
     catalog  of  our disk is yours by writing to  the  address listed
     above.   You may get it electronically from our BBS at 1-505-865-
     8385.  Look in files area 1.

          Unlike CIMN(sm), Short Story Disk(s) will not be FREEWARE or
     SHAREWARE.   They sell for $3.00 each,  and are not available  to
     computer  users by any other  means.    Unless  the computer user
     happens to be a member of the Electronic Book Club.   Then  these
     programs will be available by password for  down loading from the
     support BBS.

                           The Electronic Book Club!

     ----------------------------------------------------------------

          I know just what you are thinking.  Oh! No! Not another book
     club flyer in the mail.   Well let's discuss this.   Do you go to
     the book store and buy books?   Do you even receive some books in
     the mail?   What is wrong with an Electronic Book Club?   I think
     the  idea is spreading and I think if I do not do it  first  then
     someone  else  will  do it.   My biggest concern is  getting  the
     material  to  fullfill the needs of the reader.   I do  not  like
     starting things and then being unable to finish them.

          The electronic book club,  is a revolutionary idea  intended
     to make me some money.   #Actually it is to make me rich.   So who
     will  be the ones to do this?   Well I hope you like the idea and
     join  the Electronic Book Club.   So I will try to explain it  to
     you.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------
          Once  a month,  you will get a disk with unpublished poetry,
     short stories, novella's, novelettes, or possibly novel excerpts.
     This material will be available from an Electronic Bulletin Board
     system operated by High Mesa Publishing.   In the file's area  you
     will be able to find material for your reading enjoyment.  What I
     am  looking  for is to make enough money to pay good  writers  to
     write  things  that  you  enjoy  reading.    As  the  manuscript
     submissions  increase.  The number of programs disk product  each
     month  will  increase,  and members givne their choice  of  which
     program  they  want to  receive  (Poetry,  Short  Story,  Science
     Fiction Short Story, Novela, Novelette, ect).

          What  is this going to cost?   Well after looking at simular
     programs,  which feature things like tapes,  magazines and books.
     I  feel an annual membership fee of $36.00 will be  enough.   Now
     you  ask  what will the $36.00 get you?   That is  a  reasonable
     request.  The $36.00 will get you.

          1.   The monthly Diskette filled with unpublished  material.
     Thus it may not be available in printed form from any source.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------
          2.   Passworded  access to other programs available for your
     reading  from  High  Mesa Publishing's  own  Electronic  Bulletin
     Board,  1-505-865-8385.   Members have unlimited file access. You
     will  have to register with the BBS by calling.   Once  you  have
     called, you will get the PASSWORD for the dowload area.

          3.   If you are a writer,  you can submit your material  for
     publishing.  Writers keep all rights to published material.  They
     will share in the profits from diskettes sold with their material
     published  on  it.   I base shares on a percentage of the  amount
     $.60  set aside for authors.   Right now this is about $0.50  per
     disk, or $0.50 per monthly membership fee.  Five authors per disk
     would  receive  $0.10 per disk/membership sold  containing  their
     story or article published.

          4.  How do you join this Club?  By sending your membership
     fee to:  C_Tech's, 13 Osage Dr., Los Lunas, NM 87031, or you can
     make the check payable to:  Paula Hargrove.

          5.  You will receive your first diskette, within 2 weeks of
     receipt of your check or money order.

     ================================================================
                            Electronic Writing!

          Letters make words,  and words make reading material.   Ever
     since  man  began to put words into forms for others to  read  we
     have  searched for different means of storing our  words.   First
     there  was  probably stones,  then there was clay hardend by  the
     sun.   Next came paprus,  or paper and plastic or what ever.  The
     most common form of storing our words may well be a #2 pencil and
     a piece of paper.   In the forms of letters, first draft stories,
     or final draft novels.   What I would like to do is bring writers
     into the 1990's.

          How can I possibly do this?   Well I cannot do it by myself,
     but there are writers out there who are probably doing what I  am
     about  to discuss already.   For the sake of being clear,  I will
     refer  to  part  of the subject of  this  article  as  Electronic
     Writing.   By this I mean,  the use of a computer to create works
     by  a writer.   Allowing the writer to store the work to either a
     hard  disk,  or  to a floppy disk.   The storage  media  used  by
     computers may vary widely but will usually be one of these means.

          Floppy  disks are simular to tape cartridges used by stero's
     or  VCR's.   The  tape material forms into a disk used  to  store
     information.   Hard  disk  use the same material  only  a  little
     thicker.   They  store  many times the amount of data used  by  a
     floppy disk.

          The writer,  who uses a computer to create his/her work,  is
     actually performing a very important function.   This function is
     to  store the information onto a  device used by others to  read,
     or  to otherwise use the information.   Electronic writing,  will
     someday  be as natural as using a pencil or pen and paper was  20
     years  ago.   Even the use of typewriters for such functions  may
     have limited use.  Because using a computer with the keyboard and
     monitor is much easier,  and much simpler.  Even with correctable
     typewriters, where if you make a mistake you can correct it.  The
     typewriter does not truly have the means to proof a piece of work
     once completed.   The writer must do this function,  and  finding
     mistakes can be time consuming and tedious.

          The writer enters information or data using a keyboard.  The
     writer  then  watches  the letters appear on  the  montior.   The
     writer can now put his words to the screen,  and change, edit, or
     even  cut whole paragraphs.   Without having to retype the  whole
     piece  of work.   Once finished the writer can save the piece  of
     work  to  the  storage  media and make  it  available  for  later
     retrival.

          Electronic writing,  can make the writers work  easier.   It
     allows the writer to start a work and leave it to come back later
     and  make drastic changes.   It allows the writer to look at  the
     work time and time again without fear of tearing a page.

          So you are a writer?  Well are you a writer of the future or
     a writer of the past?   Can you make the change?   Can you afford
     not to?   I can surmise some of your questions,  and I would like
     to give you some of the answers.

          1.  Why should I spend the money to buy a computer system to
     accomplish my writing?

          A:   The  relative  price of a good system in todays  market
     makes  it  almost  imparative  writers  take  the  step   towards
     computers.   You can buy a system for as little as $2500.00 which
     will meed a writers needs.

          2.  What should a system include?

          A:   A system should include: Computer system, with Monitor,
     Keyboard,  harddisk (20/40 megabytes) and CPU.   A printer,  (Dot
     Matrix  with  Letter  Quality print),  a  modem,  and  of  course
     software (wordprocessing, communications).

          3.  What kind of system is better?

          A:   With todays systems, the brand name is unimportant, but
     the  speed  and  size of the system is  important.   A  reputable
     consultant may advise your in this matter if you ask  one.   They
     work   in  computer  stores  or  some  private  individuals   are
     performing this service.

          4.  What is a modem?

          A:  A modem is a device you attach to a computer.  It allows
     the  computer  use to send data (files) over telephone  lines  to
     another computer.  This electronic transmission of files can mean
     the  difference in meeting a deadline.   It can acutally cut  the
     time a writer has to spend in rewrite of material.

          5.   How much training do you need to use a computer,  modem
     and printer system?

          A:  Relative little, most computer users can learn to do the
     things  they need to learn within a few days.   Some simple hands
     on  instructions  or individual instruction  is  obtainable  from
     several sources.

          6.   What  are  some  advantages of Electronic  Writing  and
     Electronic Publishing?

          A:   An easy question.   From start,  to complete draft this
     article will take me less than two days.  It then goes to Michele
     Mauro  by modem.   She will hopefully edit it and put it  into  a
     more  suitable format.   She may even make it available to  Carin
     Smith  for  her to read.   I will have spell checked it,  ran  it
     through an analysis program and killed all the passive  passages.
     It  will then be ready for your review.   This question brings up
     another good subject.

     ================================================================
                          Electronic Publishing!

          Publication of works created electronically and prepared  in
     certain  formats for reading by computer users.   The most common
     form  of  publishing is TEXT format.   Simple  files  created  on
     computers  are  available  to users much like this file  will  be
     available  to you.   It is nothing more than taking  the  writers
     work  and  making it available through electronic means to  other
     people  who want to read it.   This is done through what we  call
     BBS.   Individual's or groups operate BBS's on personal computers
     from their home or business.   These BBS are Electronic  Bulletin
     Board  Service's.   They  are capable of file  transfer,  message
     passing and many other things you may have read about.

          The  creation of any work is not complete until read by  the
     intended reader.   We have lived with hard cover books, and paper
     back books now for 50 years.  The age has come where these things
     will  be  available to readers in the  format  of  electronically
     stored  data.   The reason this particular type of publishing has
     not  caught  on is publishers like their current  ways  of  doing
     things.  They may well have computers in their publishing houses.
     Computers  allow  the  writer  to  bring  their  works  into  the
     publishing  house and have it published on paper.   When in  fact
     the  material  is 90% published.   If the information or data  is
     already on the storage media, then making a copy of it is simple.

          Publishers  must  take the same step into  the  future  with
     writers.   It  is not my intention to do away with publishing  on
     paper but to supplement it with Electronic Publishing.   Computer
     files  easily  copies  to disk for passing to  the  reader.   The
     writer  and  publisher  market the writer's  material  on  floppy
     diskette for $3.00 and still make a profit.   The publisher might
     even  set  up  BBS's themselves or form  Electronic  Book  Clubs.
     Paying  the annual membership fees,  the member gets a  password.
     This allows access to the system.   It will then allown access to
     the  writers  works file area.   Another means would be  for  the
     publisher to dispense copies of material on a monthly basis.  For
     example,  club  members fee can be $40.00.   For this 40.00  they
     would receive,  (password to BBS) where they would have access to
     all available works.   They could choose to have the monthly disk
     sent via US Mail.   Which would cost only about $1.00 each month.
     With the publisher controlling access to the writers works.

          This  is a new thing,  and may very well be the wave of  the
     future in reading.

                        Home School Echo Conference

                               David Thompson

     This  article  announces availability of an echo  conference  for
     families  educating their children at home.   The content of  the
     conference  includes anything related to home education,  and  is
     intended to diseminate timely news of interest to home schoolers.
     Participation of home educated children is welcome and invited.

     The conference is currently being hubbed at 1:18/60,  and is also
     available  from  REDCON,  1:151/1000  (REC18).   If you  wish  to
     connect  to this conference,  you can pick it up from  my  system
     (1:18/60; send me netmail and we can arrange the connection),  or
     exercise your  existing connection  to REDCON.   After sufficient
     traffic  has  developed   the  conference will be  moved  to  the
     backbone.

     Homeschool  is  a  legal  form of education in  most  states  and
     provides  an alternative to both public and private schools.   It
     is  simply parents who  have  decided to teach their children  in
     their  homes.    As you can imagine, this requires a considerable
     commitment, but the result is worth it.

                     How To Be A Sysop And Avoid Ulcers


     Believe it or not, it really IS possible to enjoy being a sysop.
     Granted that it's something of an acquired taste (you probably
     didn't like beer or caviar at first, either).  It's a lot more
     fun being a sysop when you get the knack, but that's true of
     anything.  Over the years I've compiled my own list of tips and
     hints for enjoying being a sysop:


      1) Back up your system at least once every six months.

         I'm normally a fanatic about backups.  I used to keep two
         sets of three backups (one onsite, one offsite), and used one
         every day in rotation.  Finally I went out and bought a tape
         backup system that keeps three permanent copies of everything
         forever, with most of the tapes rotated to offsite storage.
         But that's for my work system.  A BBS doesn't need to be
         backed up all that much.

         Once upon a time a sysop would spend months building up a
         good message base.  If anything happened to it, it was often
         more than mortal flesh could bear to think of doing it all
         over again.  But in these days of hundred-message-a-day
         conferences, the message base just isn't that big of a deal.
         If anything happens to it, it'll regenerate in a week or two.

         These days, what's important is your system structure and
         your download libraries.  But they don't change all that
         much, so it's almost always good enough if you get a full
         backup every few months.

         Why is this important to happiness?  Simple.  It does away
         with concerns about viruses, trojans, hackers, and other
         annoyances.  So what's the worst thing anybody can do to your
         system?  Trash it?  Big deal -- reformat the drives and
         restore from backup.


      2) Do whatever you like.  It's your system, isn't it?  Run it
         however you please.  Just don't talk about it.

         For example, suppose your local (insert favorite expletive
         here) sends you a message telling you that your upload
         directory has to be sorted in chronological order, but YOU
     FidoNews 7-23                Page 15                   4 Jun 1990


         want to sort it in alphabetic order.  Don't send nastygrams
         about how you're going to sort your upload directory.  Don't
         scream and yell in conferences about the injustice of it all.
         Just ignore the message and sort your uploads however you
         like.  You'll find that, as long as you keep quiet about it,
         nobody will ever check up on you.  And even if they do, it's
         highly unlikely that they'll ever do anything other than send
         you a nasty message, which you can then ignore.

         The worst that can possibly happen is you might get
         "excommunicated".  That is, you might be dropped from your
         local network.  Even then, there's no need to scream and
         shout.  Just quietly ask another network to put you back in.
         In all the years that FidoNet has been around, there has
         never once been a case where somebody was kept out of the net
         if he really wanted to be in it.


      3) You have god-like powers over your own board.  Use them.  If
         somebody was calling your board and annoying you, you'd lower
         his access so he couldn't post anything, right?  So do the
         same thing with conferences.

         Almost every network BBS out there has some utility available
         for deleting messages based on who they are from or to.  Get
         the one for your board and use it.  Do the messages from Joe
         Bloe in KWIKBAS raise your blood pressure?  Add a line to a
         control file and *POOF*, no more annoyance.


      4) Avoid falling for the "devil theory".  Remember that deep
         down inside, everyone thinks that he is doing The Right Thing
         for The Right Reasons.  If you see messages from someone
         advocating something you disagree with, remember that HE
         thinks he's right.  You might think he's wrong, but if you
         start thinking that he's EVIL you're just going to raise your
         own blood pressure.

      5) Don't worry about viruses.  Yes, there are such things as
         viruses, but they are NOT the big bugaboo of BBSing that the
         press likes to make out.  In particular, they can't spread
         anything like as fast or as far as some folks would have you
         believe.

         First of all, remember that your downloads are all safe.  You
         don't have to worry about a virus infecting all those games
         (or whatever) you have.  They're all stored in a compressed
         form, aren't they?  If you have "raw" COM or EXE files for
         download, then maybe you might worry just a bit, but the
         virus hasn't been made that can infect a program that's
         sitting inside an archive.  And if anyone ever DID make such
     FidoNews 7-23                Page 16                   4 Jun 1990


         a virus, it'd be pretty darned obvious, what with all the
         unpacking and repacking it'd have to do.  So your downloads
         are perfectly safe.

         Second of all, your users are safe.  If your download
         libraries are safe, then the users are safe.  After all, the
         ONLY way to get a virus is by running an infected program,
         and your downloadable archives can't be infected.

         And finally, your system is safe.  You ARE backing up your
         system once in awhile like I suggested in point 1, aren't
         you?  That logic still applies -- the worst any virus can do
         is trash your system, in which case you reformat the drives,
         restore from backup, and THEN worry about it.  Meanwhile,
         don't let the odd chance of catching a virus bother you.
         You're much more likely to lose your system from a lightning
         strike, and THAT would burn out hardware that would cost
         money to replace!  The worst a virus can possibly do is to
         waste some of your time.


      6) Last of all, avoid taking it too seriously.  Remember, it's
         just a hobby.


     That's pretty much it.  Hopefully you'll find these tips of use.

     Oh, one last thing.  Remember that you're supposed to be enjoying
     yourself.  Any time you find yourself doing something you don't
     enjoy, then stop doing it.

     World's Greatest System --

     Remember those stereo contests, where you could win the world's
     greatest stereo, worth over $50,000 ?  Yeah, I didn't win
     either.  I haven't noticed any contests where you can win the
     World's Greatest PC.  Where are those guys ?

     Anyway, it's got to be a 486-33, right ?  Let's not go crazy
     and get 10 of everything;  so I vote a 16-bit SCSI controller
     with a 720 meg hard disk, an erasable optical drive and a
     CD-ROM player.  Sure, we get both a 1.2 and 1.44 floppy.  I
     think 16 megs of RAM is plenty, oh and make sure the 486 has
     a 265 KB cache. Two serial, two parallel, clock, battery,
     101 key keyboard, etc.

     I would want one of those 16-bit video frame grabber boards,
     you know, the kind you can plug your VCR into; oh, and a big 20
     inch monitor.  You know the one, ( no name dropping... ).

     We need a full page scanner and a laser printer ( the one I
     want can use a Postscript cartridge ) and a big bed plotter...
     gee isn't there one company that makes all these ?!

     Then we add the 14.4 kbps modem, fax board, answering
     machine/voice mail card, midi board, bus mouse card and
     ethernet card ( just in case you ever lost your mind ).
     There, I think that should about fill up the slots.

     Then we get a big UPS, power director and all extra long color
     coded cables.  A huge oak table and swivel high-backed leather
     chair. Add a separate clock and calculator to our table,
     because, of course this system is the World's Greatest PC, not
     a clock or calculator. <smirk>

     There I think we are set, oops, what about software ?

     Oh, here we go, now the Unix, OS/2, and QMX pundits rise up from
     the cemetery plots like some kind of zombie movie.  Sorry
     boys, this baby runs DOS.  Heck, it runs Binkley most all the
     time !  Remember ?  Anyhow, I'm writing this, so these are my
     opinions.  It's a contest grand prize;  you don't want it,
     don't enter.

     This brings me to my 7 categories of PC software, which are :
       Documentation
       Communications
       Programming
       Accounting
       Database
       Utility
       Games

     For Documentation, I'll go with WordPerfect ( if it's perfect,
     why is this version 5.1 ? ), PC Paintbrush, and Ventura
     Publisher.  The rest you get with the printer/scanner setup
     above.  Throw in LaserTorq for a print spooler.

     For Communications, give me Boyan, PC Anywhere, Binkley and
     Opus. ( Funny, one of those you have to buy to try ! )  You
     will get a lot of comm type software with all those expansion
     cards.  Also Laplink when your laptop buddies show up.

     Programming ? I'm a confirmed Brief, MS C pundit, so kick me.
     Toss in the Greenleaf comm library, I can write any program I
     want.  I get C libraries to interface everything above.  Since
     I rarely make mistakes, I don't need Multiscope, but you might.

     Accounting would have to include Supercalc, Quicken, and Amtax.
     I'm avoiding this area because I don't like to account to
     anyone.

     Database, well, I like two.  Oracle for big jobs, and Q&A for
     the little ones.  For technical reasons, include here also
     Qmail, Areafix, Tick and all those other E-mail/file functions
     you have and use to get track of that modem.

     Utility :  DOS 3.31, Desqview, PCED ( new version reviewed in
     V9N11 ), Norton, PKanything, Fastback and SuperPCKwik.

     Games :  well, I have an old saying -- My favorite game is Tax
     Spreadsheet, and the winning score is $0.00.  I'll leave the
     door wide open on this one.

     There you have it.  Hot setup, no, yes ?  On a quick
     guestimate, I can see $42,000 for the hardware, and about
     $4,000 for the software ( sure, it's all registered for you ).
     So what the heck ?  The total is under 50.  Of course, in our
     Dream Contest, we get additional cash to pay taxes. Where are
     those guys with the contest ?

     Honey says the UPS truck is pulling up now...
