                     FIDOCON 89 -- WHERE'S IT GONNA BE?


     The Membership Services Committee, under the chairmanship of
     Neal Curtin, has been charged with recommending a site to hold
     FidoCon in 1989.

     Would you like to host the next FidoCon in your city?  Here is
     your chance.  Send a proposal to the FidoCon Site Selection
     subcommittee to be considered for the honor of hosting FidoCon
     89.

     What do you need to do to host FidoCon in your city?  Planning
     an international conference requires a great deal of work on the
     part of the hosts.  A site must be selected with adequate
     meeting space, accessibility, reasonable price and 1001 other
     details.  To give you an idea of what needs to be done and to
     give the Site Selection Subcommittee some information about your
     city, we need to have the following questionnaire filled out:

     LOCATION:

          1.   What is the mileage from the airport to the host hotel?

          2.   Is shuttle service furnished by the hotel available to
               and from the hotel and airport? If not, what is the
               cost?

          3.   Are there direct (no connections) flights from the top
               ten largest metropolitan areas to your airport? Is
               the airport served by International carriers?

     HOTEL FACILITIES:

          1.   Is there a large (150 person) conference room which
               will be available throughout the conference?

          2.   Are there at least three smaller conference rooms which
               will be available for meetings during the conference?
               (75, 50 plus board type rooms.)

          3.   Will there be display space for vendors?

          4.   Will there be a small private conference room available
               for the host and other committees?

          5.   Will  the hotel guarantee room rate,  not to exceed $80
               for double occupancy?

     FidoNews 5-39                Page 2                   26 Sep 1988


          6.   Will the host committee prepare a list including price
               ranges and bill of fare for all hotel restaurants in
               advance of the conference?

          7.   Will the hotel provide early committment on prices of
               banquets, receptions, coffee break service, and any
               other food and beverage service to the conference
               sessions?

          8.   Will the host committee be able to obtain corporate
               sponsors to help defray conference expenses?  Who are
               they?

          9.   Does the hotel have handicap facilities?

         10.   Is the hotel or convention center willing to provide
               help in the planning of the conference?

         11.   Will the hotel allow for special telephone
               connections? (For modems)

     LOCAL SUPPORT:

          1.   There must be an active committee consisting of at
               least five members in the host city at least nine
               months before the conference.  Members of this
               committee should be prepared to spend at least two
               hours per week in the early planning stages and at
               least 8-10 hours per week just before the conference.
               The local chair should work closely with the FidoCon
               subcommittee chair by Net Mail, Snail, and voice.
               Please furnish the name of the host committee and the
               name and address of the host chairperson.

          2.   Sponsorship of the conference by a local user group
               would be a plus.  Please furnish the name of the
               sponsoring group, if any.

          3.   Will a list of nearby restaurants (all price ranges --
               including fast food) and local entertainment be
               prepared by the local committee?

          4.   Will maps of the area would be provided to attendees?

          5.   What activities for family members should will be
               planned by the local committee?

          6.   Will there be a software swap area set up with
               computers for people to trade disks?  Will any of them
               be equipped with a printer and/or modem? Will disk
               sales (at cost) be included?

          7.   Will there be conference souvenirs, including but not
               limited to T-shirts and hats, available throughout the
               conference?

          8.   Will a special rate on car rentals be available to
               FidoCon attendees?

     OTHER:

          1.   What other events would you suggest for attendees?

          2.   What are the features of your city that make it

                       How I got into the Net
                          Brian J. Murrey
                             1:231/0

     The first time I logged into a Fido was about three years
     ago.  I had heard some people at the local Model 4 user
     group meeting discussing this new BBS that had just started
     here in Indy that had the ability to send mesages all over
     the country.  The very idea had intrigued me so, that when I
     got home I gave this "new" BBS a call.  I have long forgotten
     the node number but it was a real live Fido that was being
     operated by Jeff Keyes.  Though I didn't have any netmail
     credit, I was able to at least read some of the mail.  In
     comparison to what I was used to, I had to admit that it was
     fascinating to say the least.

     A year later I found myself with a DOS machine and about a year
     after that the BBS bug bit me.  I had been a co-sysop on the
     local TBBS run by Chuck Ober for a number of years and was
     looking for some kind of BBS software to run.  I started it up
     with PCBoard vers 10 at first, I had never been wild about any
     BBS that was written in BASIC and soon found myself unhappy and
     very limited in what I could do with the BBS.  Just when I
     was about to give BBSing up, Adam Hudson released QuickBBS so
     I downloaded it and decided to give it a try.  In reading the
     docs I noticed the mention of this software being FidoNet
     compatible.  I didn't even know that the net was still around
     but after reading the docs I decided I simply had to join.

     After getting QuickBBS up and running, I convinced a couple of
     the other local sysops to run QuickBBS and join in on the fun.
     Chuck Ober ordered SEAdog for his TBBS and we began the battle
     of getting mailers and echo handlers working.  Chuck managed to
     pull it off first so he became the NC at that time.  In my quest
     for a node number I decided to use 11/000 as my node number to
     request a permanent one from Bill Allbritten, I soon learned
     that this was NOT a good idea.  I didn't know that Binkley or
     something was shortening that number to 11/0.  Well anyway, I
     finally convinced Bill (actually Chuck did) that I wasn't trying
     to cause any trouble, it was just my dumb luck.  Within about a
     week we finally had three nodes and were assigned the net number
     of 231.

     In comparing Fido of today to Fido of three years ago, I would
     have to say that it seems to be a lot more regimented and a even
     a little better run.  I have been in the net now for almost six
     months.  We have helped another new net to be formed from other
     systems that had joined through us, and now I find myself NC
     since Chuck has decided to move.

     More on the trials and tribulations of being an NC later.

     What I would love to see in the Fido Net over the next few
     years would basically be more of the same.  Even with all of
     the in-fighting of recent years and all of the new networks
     sprouting up, Fido Net has managed to stay with it.  I would

     like to offer a big thanks to those that have made this media
     possible and all of you that have kept it running over the
     years.  I hope to be involved with Fido Net for a long time
     to come.

                      Universal Mayhem SYSOP.EXE
                           Fredric Rice
                           (103/503.3)

     How could I have been so STUPID?! I left out a file on some of
     the MAYHEM.ARC files I mailed around the United States! What a
     bummer! Check your archive and see if you have SYSOP.EXE. If
     not, let me know and I will mail it into your system.

     This file allows the maintenence of the players ship files so
     that they may be removed or edited by the system operator. You
     can live without it; in fact, you may not really care if it's
     missing or not. The C version will be out soon enough:

     The hard disk drive was reformatted after loosing the file
     allocation table, (and the backup FAT 2), and some how I lost
     this file in the archive.

     The error message you get when you request the SYSOP command:

                       CM error on line 4XXX - something

     Too much diet coke and reds in too short a time...

                            Universal Mayhem Report
                                Fredric L. Rice
                                  (103/503.3)

     Universal Mayhem, the BASIC version, has been mailed to  quite  a
     few systems. Near the end of this notice, a list of those systems
     who, (I hope received the program), follows.

     If you are on the list and have NOT received the program, let  me
     know  and I will mail it again. Include your systems PHONE NUMBER
     so that I may upload directly.

     If you requested Universal  Mayhem  and  are  not  on  the  list,
     "woops".  Let me know and I will crash it into your system. There
     has been a lot of mail coming in receintly because  of  Universal
     Mayhems initial release and I don't think I missed anyone but its
     always possible.

     There have been some  problems  reported  installing  the  thing.
     Because  of  this,  I describe the installation and configuration
     information for the OPUS package in this notice.

     If you aquire  errors  running  this  program;  errors  that  are
     offered  by  Universal Mayhem that don't crash your box, you will
     notice a file created called "SHIP.ERR". This file contains a log
     of  all the errors that may be encountered. Mayhem will attempt a
     resumption of program execution in the event of an  error  except
     for "Universe file corrupted" in which case the execution resumes
     with the BBS software.  It's  important  to  note  that  if  this
     "corruption" message is ever seen, it will NOT get logged because
     running the program again will get around the problem.  This  bug
     is  only encountered when a "find" is performed by a ship that is
     within sensor scan of the  edge  of  the  universe.  The  sensors
     attempt  to scan beyond the edge and they find nothing, (which is
     as it should be in 'real' life so perhaps it's not really a bug).
     Simply ignore this one.

     - - - Some installation information in an OPUS environment - - -

     In the first beta test site for Universal Mayhem, I used the main
     menu  option "A)nswer Questionair" to hook into Mayhem.  The file
     MAINPRIV.BBS was edited to show an  option  "A)  Trade  Wars  and
     Other Programs". A debugger was used to edit this file.

     In the OPUS.CTL  file,  then,  OPUS  was  told  that  when  going
     outside, use file EDTORIL.BBS for the menu. This file looked like
     this:

           T) Transists Now

           N) Natal Calculations

                                   W) Tradewars! You need ANSI to Play

                                   U) Universal Mayhem! KILL!

     FidoNews 5-39                Page 8                   26 Sep 1988


           Q) Quit to MAIN MENU

      Your selection: Rwtnqu

      UtCc: \opus\trans
      UnCc: \opus\natal
      UwCc: \opus\runtw
      UuCc: \opus\ship
      UqQ
      T

     The file contains imbeded control codes (Control  O  and  Control
     U),  and  you  should read your OPUS manual to determine how this
     file should be built.  When in doubt, you should  always  contact
     the OPUS manufacturer.

     The  \opus\ship  is  the  name  of  the  following  batch   file:
     (SHIP.BAT):

     echo off
     watchcd com1 on
     cd\ship
     mayhem < gate1 > gate1
     cd\opus
     renum -r 3
     watched com1 off

     As you can see, the  batch  file  invokes  the  watching  of  the
     carrier  incase the player drops out of the game abnormally. This
     will reset the system when carrier is  lost  and  will  hopefully
     invoke your autoexec batch file to reload the BBS software.

     Mayhem is invoked using GATEWAY for its console  redirection.  An
     old  version, though a tested version, of GATEWAY was enclosed in
     Universal Mayhem. You should find the receint version of  GATEWAY
     and  use  it.  I  have  found that GATEWAY works as well as it is
     perported to and can find no fault with it.  The only problem  is
     the  nonexistance  of  a  type-ahead  buffer.  This  is, in fact,
     Universal Mayhems fault as it should queue up these  keys  rather
     than expecting GATEWAY to do it for me.

     When Universal Mayhem is exited, message area  3,  the  Universal
     Mayhem  Echo  Mail area, is renumbered. After that, carrier watch
     is removed, allowing OPUS to have control and its  way  with  the
     system.

     As always, if you would like me  to  mail  Universal  Mayhem  the
     BASIC  version  to  your  system,  let  me know. I will also mail
     floppies to you if you offer your mailing address.  Don't  forget
     that the BASIC source code is being sold for ten bucks and is not
     file requestable.

     Some notes on the C version:

     There has been a big problem with the  development  of  Universal
     Mayhem,  the  C  version.  Several,  as  a  matter  of  fact. The
     development systems keyboard RETURN key never worked so control-M
     was  always  used.  This  has  caused  some  unusual  programming
     practices in that in real life, I now continue to  use  control-M
     out  of  habit.  The  C, T, and Y keys bounced like you would not
     believe; del didn't work and backspace would work sometimes.  The
     keyboard  was  finally  replaced with a brand new $24.00 keyboard
     and that's a major problem solved.

     The  software  problem  which  has  kept  the  development  at  a
     standstill  for  the last month has been solved. This problem was
     the crashing of the system at program exit due to a nonrelease of
     allocated  memory.  Though the C program did in fact release it's
     memory, the pointers were being converted to signed far  pointers
     and  negative  memory  addresses  were  being passed to Turbo C's
     memory deallocation functions. Should have caught that one a LONG
     FidoNews 5-39                Page 10                  26 Sep 1988


     time ago.

     Oh, and I need to paint the house.

     These things, taken together, have added to some  two  months  or
     more to have gone by, pushing the release date back even further.
     It is hoped that at the end of September, the beta  testing  will
     begin.

     Some of the things that still need to be done:

     o Bail-out on rpt loop  (*** Already done ***)
       The keyboard should be checked to see if  there  is  an  ESCape
       waiting. If there is, execution should resume at the entry of a
       new command.

     o Signal trapping of control-C. The existing status of  control-C
       checking should be stored away  in a variable.  Then  control-C
       trapping should be removed when the program starts. At  program
       exit, the initial  status of control-C  checking should then be
       restored.

     o Again does not work with rpt command (*** already done ***)`

     o Hitting a star or mine should cause the ship to be "blown"  off
       of the  object for  one sector  along the  direction of  dewarp
       travel.

     o Logging to printer of player sign-ins of name, date, and  time,
       should be performed if the configuration file  specifies  'yes'
       for 'logging'. (*** already done ***)

     o The ship that last attacked a ship should  be  stored  in  each
       ships  data  structure.  The  total  amount  of  phaser  energy
       expended on  the  ship  since  the  last sign-in as well as the
       number  of  torps impacting on the  ship should be displayed at
       sign-in. (*** already done ***)

     o Navagational information on three planets should be  stored  in
       the ships data structures. The positions of three planets along
       with the cost  factor should be stored.  Information  retrieval
       should show  the technology  as well  so that  will need  to be
       stored for each of the three planets.

     o Last ship the ship has attacked should be stored and  displayed
       with the 'stat'us command. The health if the ship last attacked
       should be offered as 1) N units  of 1-million  power  units  of
       energy  available  to  the  ship  attacked,  2) If the ship was
       destroyed by you, 3) If the ship was boarded and left to drift.

     o The find-go command should break the warp values into managable
       warp values according to existing warp drive capability. Rather
       than just making a 50 warp jump, if the capability is only  10,
       the command string should be parsed into 5 jumps of 10 sectors
       each along the dimentional line. (*** already done ***)

     FidoNews 5-39                Page 11                  26 Sep 1988


     o Messages not  received,  (marked  as  received  in  OPUS  style
       format),  should  be  o ffered  at  the  start  of  a   sign-in
       reguardless  of  wether or  not the captain wants to read them.
       The  messages,  after being  read,  should be marked as read by
       updating the OPUS message file. (*** already done ***)

     o Ship names should allow numerical digits 0-9 in them.

     o Destruction of ship should cause the destruction of  all  ships
       in  the  quadrent  of   space .  Though  the  blast  should  be
       proportunate  to the strength of the  ship  by looking  at  the
       available  power .  Depending , the  ships in the area will  be
       destroyed  or  will be simply  damaged. Distance from destroyed
       ship  and those around it  should be  taken into consideration.
       Destruction  ordered by a ship docked with another, (the others
       shields are down), always causes the destruction of both ships.
       Other permitations will need to be considered. (*** done ***)

     o The MAYHEM menu should have an  option  which  will  perform  a
       'names'  command, allowing people to use OPUS's execution of  a
       smaller program to see if  their  ship is  still alive  without
       having to drop all the way to Universal Mayhem, signing-in, and
       then signing-out.

     o Self destructed ships should leave debris and  hard  radiation.
       The universe  file  should  contain  the   yposition   of   the
       destroyed  ship and the  scan should show  the debris.  Because
       only one yposition will be stored on each universe record, only
       one ships  remains will  be stored  for  each scan  line of the
       quadrent.  If another  ship were  to  self destruct on the same
       xposition ,  the new ship  will take the place of the old ship.
       The name of  the ship destroyed  might be  stored .  This would
       increase  the  size  of the universe file by 5 characters times
       the xposition size less 1.

     o Remotes should be magnetically attracted to ships  under  warp.
       In this way, a  ship may become attached simply by warping past
       a remote set up as a barrier or warning device.

     o The universe, planets, ships, and other files should  have  all
       of the  positional  values changed from  ' long's to  'short's.
       After that,  all of the same positional reports should have the
       '%ld's  changed to  '%d's  such that  proper printf's  will  be
       performed. (*** already done ***)

     o The buying  and  selling  of  sled-fighters  should  be  added.
       Commands that  deploy the  fighters and recall  them should  be
       created.  Fighters will  be used  to guard  areas of  space  or
       attack ships. These  fighters  should be kept in groups with up
       to five groups maintained.  There may be any number of fighters
       in  a  group.  The ships  data  structure  should  contain  the
       positions of these  five groups.  On the scan, these ships show
       up as ' .  '; one space, a period, then two spaces. Torps  into
       this swarm of  fighters may cause the  destruction  of  one  or
       more sleds.  The pack may move around and attack, cuasing monor
       problems  to   the  ship   under  attack.   There  might  be  a
     FidoNews 5-39                Page 12                  26 Sep 1988


       possibility  of the  pack  splitting  up into  two or four sub-
       groups when  engaged in battle. This would depend on the number
       of fighters in the group. Fighters should be recalled every now
       and then for refueling.  The  group as a  whole should maintain
       a fuel availablility value which will change as sleds are used,
       get destroyed, and are added to the  swarm.  After  recall  and
       re-deployment, the overall fuel availability to the swarm group
       is 100%. If the fuel available drops too low, all fighter sleds
       in the group are lost. (*** already done. Works great ***)

     o Chat Mode. Allows player to call system operator  from the game
       without having to exit to BBS software. Operator can invoke the
       chat mode  as well.  The  chatability is  controlled through an
       entry in the configuration file and will be either on or off.

     At this time I am asking  for beta testers for the C version when
     it is  hopefully  released at the end  of September. Keep in mind
     that if you do want to help beta test it, your system could crash
     running  a not-real-life tested program. Though I have tested the
     project at  all stages of  development, who's to say that a real-
     life environment can't cause problems?

     The program at this time takes a little less than 130K of RAM. If
     you would like  to help  beta test, let me know so I can mail the
     beta test version out as soon as it's ready.

     Some questions that are being asked:

     Mark  James  from  Maroubra, North South Whales, (712/302), asked
     where the system  picks up  the "from  node address"  and the "to
     node address". I don't know what this means but I believe that he
     is asking about the echo mail interface? If so, then an echo mail
     area needs to be  created  AREA:MAYHEM.  When  opus-style message
     files get created,  they are  done so in  the default  directory,
     (the new C version  has a path in the configuration file that can
     be changed).  These  message packets  start at message number 100
     and are  usually tossed to the correct  echo  mail area  and then
     renumbered.

     Mark also noticed that when  you destroy  an enemy ship, the base
     will stay around. If your  ship gets destroyed, your base will be
     left behind.  You  can't fire phasers  at an enemy base and torps
     are always neutralized.  This is a  known bug. It was intended to
     allow the  destroyed  ship  back into the universe such  that the
     captain could go to the base and  refuel and exact  revenge.  The
     bug exists because  when the  captain of the destroyed ship signs
     back in, it  accidentally resets the base into nonexistance. This
     is incorrect. It should not allow enemy ships to fire at the base
     when a ship  has  been  destroyed but it SHOULD allow the captain
     back   into   his  base.   The   only  way  to  get   around  the
     inaccessability of a destroyed ships base  is to attack  the base
     first and then take off after the enemy ship.

     Mario Dulisse, (222/10), has noticed  that when  using the  SYSOP
     command, he acquired CM error in line  4283 module SHIP. This was
     because the Universal Mayhem  program  was attempting to chain to
     the SYSOP.EXE program.  This error will occure when the SYSOP.EXE
     is not  in  the  default  directory on the disk. Universal Mayhem
     does NOT  search through the path for files, it simply chains and
     expects to  find it.  This has  been allieviated in the C version
     in that Universal Mayhem the C version will search the path. It's
     interesting to note  that  Mario  file attached the SHIP.ERR file
     for me and I was very  quickly  able to assertain the problem and
     offer a solution.

     Harry Dijkstra, (508/9),  Holland,  has asked for MAYHEM. I would
     like to phone it in but...  It would  be cheaper for me to mail a
     floppy to everyone who is outside of  the  United  States. If you
     would give me a mailing address, I will gladly mail a floppy free
     of charge. I want to distribute  UM BASIC  _Widely_  so that when
     the C version  comes  out,  people  will be ready to take a giant
     step upwards and  know what the game is about. I did this so that
     SysOps and Users  alike  would know  what to do when C version is
     released; the syntax remains the same:  many additional  commands
     and features have been added.  The C version will be  distributed
     the same way. I already have many outstanding requests for it!

     Soap box mode:

     I didn't like making  such a  LARGE  fidonews submission... But I
     feel I really must say something:

     "Thanks a million  for  developing/writing a game like this. You,
     (and guys like you), are making this lil' hobby of mine turn into
     a REAL pleasure trip".
                              - Phil Gainey (383/10)

     Everyone  who has  asked for  Universal Mayhem  or  Downloaded it
     directly  has said "thank you". I have looked through  the log of
     the requests and I can't find one that doesn't  express thanks. I
     thought this courtisy was absent on FidoNet.  It's really neat to
     see that I was wrong. Phils' comment to me caused me to consider.
     My initial  aim when  developing  Universal Mayhem was  to try to
     help bring FidoNet people together by providing a forum  in which
     people may destroy themselves symbolically. Venting of aggression
     through numerical means while  having fun...  If  just one person
     can  group  me  in  with  people  the likes of Tom Jennings, Henk
     Weavers: the  power  houses behind FidoNet, I feel I have done my
     job and met my priorities. Thanks.

     I see this courtisy and have desided  to take the project  just a
     little further and  port it to  Unix  systems. Actually, it's not
     that big an extension to the project, but I feel it will be worth
     the extra work. In this version, file/record locking will be done
     to allow more than one  person to play at the same time, even see
     people fire at them! Real-time!

     I would like to acquire suggestions  for the game.  In the  BASIC
     version,  I never turned   down a   suggection   and   added   it
     reguardless  of  the  amount  of  work  it  took. True, many were
     removed because of a lack of memory, (the BASIC version would not
     let me  exceed the 64K boundry for code!).  If  you have an idea,
     let me know and I will add it.

            Shareware!  Freeware!  Get that good feeling.

     When we were all growing up we grumbled about not being given
     responsibility, about our folks and teachers hanging over our
     heads making sure we followed 'the rules'.  Hell, we didn't
     need rules.  Just trust us to know and do what was right and we
     would be okay.  We all wanted 'The Honor System'.

     Now that we are adults (or nearly so), we are all pretty much
     unsupervised.  Are we all making our folks and teachers proud
     by our actions?  Each individual will have to decide that on
     their own the next time they peek deeper than the reflection
     they see in the bathroom mirror.

     I doubt there are any of us without at least a few sins.  Every
     now and then it is good to take inventory of what we do with
     the social trusts that we all share, to see how we can better
     'measure up'.

     How we honor the licenses of the Shareware and Freeware
     programs that we use can provide each of us with a small bit of
     insight into ourselves.

     Freeware licenses often come with the terms that it is not to
     be distributed in an altered format; that the code is the
     exclusive property of the author; that the docs, the
     executables, license and other errata be passed around as a
     'package' and that the software be used in a friendly manner.
     Also, there is sometimes an encouragement to send the author a
     friendly "THANKS!  I LIKE YOUR WARES!" note.  Maybe it says
     to toss a few coins or dollars to a charity ...

     Easy license terms to abide by?  Most of us light up the nights
     with our smiles so using the wares in a friendly manner is no
     problem.  Swapping archived programs makes distributing the
     files intact an easy trick.  Most of us don't write programs so
     stealing code is never a temptation.

     What about the note to the authors?  Have you helped barrage
     them with 'Thanks!' via their BBS systems, CIS, NetMail or U.S.
     Mail?  If you haven't blasted a quickie "DUH, THANKYA!" out to
     your favorite freeware authors, DO IT!  An actor who receives
     no responses from his audiences will soon take up another
     profession.  If you want that programmer to keep cranking out
     those gems you best let the dude (or dudette) know you
     appreciate his/her time and effort!

     How about the coins for charity?  There is no shortage of
     coin-cans at the checkout counters of your local stores.  Folks
     are always seeking funds for liver transplants, cancer
     treatment or research, aid for the homeless, food for the
     hungry, aid for AIDS victims, etc.  When the cashier hands you
     your change, do you shove it into your pocket or do you first
     toss something into the can with the thought, "this one's for
     Jennings, this one's for Thom, this one's for Ben, here's for
     Wynn, these are for Bob and Vince ..."?
     FidoNews 5-39                Page 16                  26 Sep 1988


     Shareware is the middle ground between Freeware and commercial
     programs.  The license terms are pretty much the same as
     Freeware, but you are asked to send in either a donation of an
     amount you choose or a fixed amount the author is asking.  Look
     over your disk directories and see what you use that has an
     asking price.  Have you sent the author his due?

     There is no need to go bankrupt trying to send all of the
     authors a check on the same day.  One of the real beauties of
     Shareware is that you can pay at your convenience.  Make a list
     of what you use then move down the list over a period of
     months.  If a program asking a donation only seems worth a buck
     (or this is all you can afford), SEND THE DOLLAR!

     Do you think your use of a utility only warrants 25-75% of an
     asking price?  Try sending a donation, instead of the
     asking-price, with a note to the author explaining your
     viewpoint.  The author may not give you full program-support
     for the fee, but you both have gained something.  I doubt the
     check would be returned with "SCUMBAG!!  I GONNA KEEL YOU!!"
     scrawled on it.

     So far, most terms you have seen set for Shareware and Freeware
     have not asked you to stand naked on the steps of the
     Whitehouse and scream like a mink in heat.  They have been as
     fair and as reasonable (if not more so) than the terms of the
     commercial software packages you own.  Try and abide by these
     terms.  Help keep the spirit and intent of these social trusts
     alive.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                    Episode 11:  Those Weird Programmers


     Weekend before last I got  a  sunburn.   "Oh, boy", you say, "Now
     that's REALLY different".  Yeah, well, I got it programming.

     No, I didn't  get  it  from  that  Turbo  Pascal  editor with the
     intense yellow text color that  burns out the retinas in the back
     of your eyes.  I had my computer  and  my reference books outside
     and was sitting in shorts in  the  sun and working on EagleTech's
     latest version of indexed file  I/O routines.  I was also setting
     up some more  customized  BBS  routines.    I'm  not  sure if the
     neighbors' looks were of amusement or worry.

     I also live 28 miles from work  and want to ride my bicycle there
     every day.  The people I work with think I'm crazy.  They're nuts
     - I just want to get back into shape, that's all.

     A friend of mine rigged a tape  recording to a button he added to
     his terminal keyboard.  The key  said "Flush" and you can imagine
     what the sound of the tape was.  Yeah, it pissed me off, too.

     I was working on a project at work the other day, and around 2:00
     in the o'dark hundred I realized that if I went home, it would be
     a 1 hour motorcycle ride home,  a  2  hour nap, and a 1 hour ride
     back - assuming I got up in  time.    I  ain't 18 any more.  So I
     closed down what I was working on, curled my coat up for a pillow
     and used my snowmobile suit  for  a  blanket - and got up at 6:30
     when the first hardware maintenance guy came in and turned on the
     lights.  The next day was my most productive day this year.

     Somebody asked me how old I was recently.  I had to calculate it.

     I like Star Trek, but I  don't  watch  it  because I don't have a
     television.  I haven't  quite  mastered  getting a window to open
     up on the PC with television  in  it.    The football season each
     year almost makes me  go  out  and  buy  one,  but even the great
     American pull of football doesn't quite win out -- though it gets
     harder and harder to resist each year.

     The Programmer's  Dictionary  (YACK  3;  FidoNews 5-11) defines a
     programmer as a red-eyed,  mumbling  mammal capable of conversing
     with inanimate objects.  Somewhere, deep in the heart of even the
     fair-hairdest, wide-eyed  normal-looking  programmer is a strange
     little bugger that is just aching to get out.

               New Echo: Medical *FILE* Exchange (MEDFILES)


     I have started a medical file exchange echo which will operate
     based upon FLEA.ARC by Ron Bemis of 124/113.  The MEDFILES echo
     will allow automated distribution of medically related program
     and text files among FidoNet compatible systems.

     To join the echo, file-request FLEA.ARC from 135/3 and set up
     your FLEA.BBS with area name MEDFILES and a password for node
     135/3 of password.   Since any member of the echo will be
     permitted to post files, place an asterisk by the node number.
     Then send me a netmail message indicating your interest in the
     echo and start polling daily.  (Note: I am PC-PURSUITABLE via
     FLMIA.)

     As more nodes join, I will periodically compile a list of
     participating nodes and post it to the echo.  As the echo grows,
     this list will become  more important because it will become
     difficult for me to support transfers of large files to multiple
     systems.  Therefore, I encourage participating nodes to organize
     a distribution system which will make echo distribution efficient
     but at the same time utilize discount carriers such as  PC
     Pursuit.

     If a node links into your MEDFILES distribution, please advise me
     either via netmail or through the echo so I can update my
     distribution list.

     Note: Please .ARC all files (text or program files) which would
     be  appropriate for posting on a medically related BBS.  Files of
     an  administrative or personal nature (such as echo distribution
     FidoNews 5-39                Page 23                  26 Sep 1988


     lists or questions about the echo) should be posted as .TXT
     files.  LARVA.COM, which is included in FLEA.ARC, should be used
     for posting files to the echo.
