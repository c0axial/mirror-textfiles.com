     John Whitson
     1:160/200.0

                          BiModem:  A testimonial

          While snooping around the network a few days ago (looking
     for PD/ShareWare software fonts for a lucky friend with a new
     LaserJetII), I came across a curious entry in a file list:

     BIMOD103.PAK Full Duplex Xfer Protocal (Sd/Rcv at same time)
                                        (^sic)

          Naturally, I was curious, so I downloaded it and looked at
     the documentation.  The .DOC file promised even more than the BBS
     listing.

          "Imagine the time savings if you could upload with
          Zmodem(tm) and YmodemG efficiencies while downloading
          at the same efficiency at the same time."

          Right.  No way.  Zmodem is pushing the limits of technology
     as it is.  Where are we going to do this other transfer, another
     phone line?  But wait, there's more!

          "If that feature is not enough to get you really
          excited, how about the ability to chat while the
          transfer is going on?  Chatting, of course, will impact
          your throughput, but since most of us are slow typists,
          when compared to the speed of even a 1200 baud modem,
          the impact is usually minimal."

          Right.  This sounds like some of the vaporware you read
     about in the funny pages of Byte or Dr. Dobb's.  Erik Labs wanted
     $25.00 for registration.  Sounds about par for ShareWare.  The
     claims so far:
          1)  Two way transfer
          2)  Zmodem(tm) or YmodemG transfer efficiency BOTH WAYS
          3)  Chatting while this goes on with 'minimal' effect
          4)  And it would only cost $25.00

          By following the instructions, I installed it (in a period
     of about 5 minutes) to run with Binkley.  So far, it was too
     easy.

          They claimed there was a protocol for Opus that allowed Opus
     SYSOPS to support BiModem users.  If so, the source BBS should
     have it.  So I found out where it came from, Sun Valley BBS in
     Phoenix, AZ (1:114/42.0), and I called them.  I found B)iModem as
     an option under the F)iles menu, and hit Alt-J to jump to DOS.  I
     entered BIMOD, and things happened.

          It asked me what I wanted to do:  U/D.  I chose U.  It asked
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 2                   27 Mar 1989


     for a file, so I picked a big one.  No use sending a little file,
     since I wanted some big ones.  I entered my description, then hit
     <PgDown>.  That was easy.

          I selected U, and downloaded BIMOD107.ARC and BIOPUS16.ARC,
     then chose Alt-X to continue.  A few seconds later, a window
     popped up offering two chat and three transfer status sub-
     windows.  It informed me that this (roughly) 140K file would take
     nearly 10 minutes (9:46 sec) to upload at 2400 baud.  It did,
     but it did so while simultaneously downloading 94K in two other
     files.  Total transfer time, 9 min, 54 sec (including file name
     overhead).

          Very impressive.  I wouldn't have believed it if anyone had
     told me.  In fact, a friend of mine STILL doesn't believe me.  I
     believe though, and I've already sent my $25.00.

          For more information, and the latest versions of all the
     BiModem software, contact:

          Valley of the Sun.  Fido 1:114/42.0.

          Tell them you read about it here and don't believe them.
     Download BIMOD107.ARC, set it up, and call back for a test run.

          BIMODEM currently comes with scripts for Procomm+, Telix,
     and Qmodem.  Batch files are included for other terminal
     emulators such as Binkley, which can shell to DOS.

                        Random notes at a HAH Party
                                    by

                              Trixie Highborn
                           as told to Wes Brewer

          I answered the phone. It was Wes. "Would you like to go with
     me to a HAH party Saturday?" he asked.
          "What's a HAH party?" I asked.
          "A Dutch treat for members of HAH," he told me. "A bunch of
     computer friends getting together for a little fun."
          Nothing would please me less than getting together with
     computer people all talking in that strange out-of-space
     language that they use. But I could not tell Wes this. He is so
     firmly stuck in his mistaken belief that computers are here to
     stay that if I said anything against computers or their users his
     feelings would be hurt. So I said "yes".
          I knew that I was in for a rough time, but I did not realize
     just how rough until we arrived at the Pizza Hut where the party
     was to be held. In addition to the HAH party, they had booked two
     other parties to be held in this building which was about the
     size of my walk-in closet.
          After fighting our way to the cashier's station, Wes
     screams "Hey, where's the HAH party?"
          "Dunno exactly," the cashier replied. "Either over there or
     back yonder, I think."
          We fought our way over there, but these were obviously not
     computer people. They were carrying on intelligent conversations.
     So we fought our way to "back yonder". "See anyone you
     recognize?" I asked.
          "Never saw any of them before in my life," Wes replied.
          "We have come to the wrong Pizza Hut," I suggested. "Let's
     get out of here."
          "No, this is it. Let's find a spot of wall to lean against
     and order something to eat."
          We squeezed in and waited until a couple with chairs had to
     go to the bath room and grabbed their chairs. Soon a young man
     came by, extended his hand and said, "Welcome, strangers. I am
     Harry Blake."
          Wes grabbed his hand and replied, "Hi Harry. I'm Wes Brewer.
     Glad to see you. How are things in school?" What could have led
     Wes to believe that this young man was a student? But Blake began
     to tell about things at school. "How did you get here?" Wes
     continued.
          "I drove," Harry replied.
          "Last I heard, you were grounded until you pull your grades
     up."
          "I pulled them up," Harry replied. Then the two of them
     started discussing conversations that they had had two or three
     years ago. Several others came by and introduced themselves with
     similar results. Somehow this did not seem right.
          "Wes," I finally said "What are you trying to pull? These
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 4                   27 Mar 1989


     are all old friends but you said that you had never seen any of
     them before."
          "Yes, it is true that these are old friends and it is
     equally true that I have never seen them before. We met and
     talked on bulletin boards and became friends, but this the first
     time we have seen one another."
          "Bulletin boards?" I asked. He tried to explain this to me,
     but I am still in the dark. I have a mental picture of a
     landscape dotted with cork boards with hundreds of notes pinned
     to them and people willy nilly walking from one board to another
     reading the notes and posting their own boards. I was reminded of
     my schoolroom sixty years ago when boys would hit girls in the
     head with wadded mash notes. And Wes thinks that this will get me
     interested in computers.
          I asked several people what HAH stood for and got several
     different answers. The answer that I got most often was "Hackers
     are Human."
          "What's a hacker?" I asked Wes.
          "A hacker is a computer. . ."
          "Now, there you go, trying to endow those infernal machines
     with human personalities," I said.
          "Before I was so rudely interrupted, I was saying, "A hacker
     is a computer buff," Wes replied.
          "Now, there you go, trying to endow those infernal people
     with human personalities." I said.
          While Wes was occupied with his friends (strangers), I saw a
     little boy wandering around. "Sonny," I asked, "Is your daddy a
     computer buff?"
          "Nah, He hates computers."
          "Then your mommy is a computer buff?"
          "Nah, she's scared of computers."
          "Oh, I see. You are not part of this party. You just got
     separated from your parents and ended up in here," I said.
          "Nah. I belong in here."
          "How could you if neither of your parents are computer
     buffs?"
          "I'm a computer buff," he informed me.
          Next, I engaged an attractive young lady in conversation. "I
     hear a lot about this beautiful lady who is scheduled to perform
     a table top dance. All the men seem to be excited about it." I
     said. "I didn't hear about this until we got here. I wonder when
     the lady will arrive."
          "I also didn't hear about it until I got here. Yes, the lady
     has arrived. I am the lady. I hope these dirty old me do not hold
     their breaths until I dance," she told me.
          Well, obviously the table top dance was canceled, but the
     party was not entirely without its exciting moments. The
     highlight of the party was probably when this matron with two
     hungry and crying children finally reached the conclusion that
     Pizza Hut was never going to serve her and her hungry children.
     So she went to the phone and called Domino's Pizza and ordered
     three pizza to be delivered to her at Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut's
     manager took a dim view of this solution to her problem.
          A great time was had by all.

     Jeff Sheese, JStek BBS
     Fidonet 1:109/116   (Netmail HOST routed via 1:109/100)

       ZOW, Yet Another Fantastically New File Packer! (Part 1 of 2)

     Yes, yet ANOTHER fantastically new file packer is about to hit
     the public domain software scene!  But before I describe this new
     file packing software package I'll talk about the events that led
     up to my discovery of it's algorithms.  The teaser is that I
     offer it free of charge, the formats are public domain, and I
     PERSONALLY will allow anyone to duplicate it's structure.  Just
     don't steal my source code.

     I check the spelling of comments. ;-)

     After reading the SYSOP conference, which I co-moderate, I was
     sort of disgusted with the politics of all these packing
     programs.  I remembered the days of CP/M which brought the old
     gems of SQUEEZE (SQZ files) and Library (LBR files).  Remember
     the one program, NULU, which combined them both, AND allowed you
     to work with the individual members of the library file?  I don't
     currently know of a packer that does this.  Mine doesn't. ;-)

     At any rate, we all know the packer politics (no reference to
     Green Bay intended).  So whilst laying awake late at night, I
     tried to think of a way to pack a file, regardless of size, down
     to the barest minimum allowed on a 360k IBM 9 sector, DSDD floppy
     disk.  2048 bytes!

     The next morning it dawned on me!  I finally figured it out!

     The result was ZOW.  The current version (in alpha test) does
     this, but it only works on floppy disks.  Yes, I know.  But you'd
     have to see the source code to know why.  It's not crippleware.
     It makes low level DOS calls to the floppy disk controller.
     Strange but true, it will take any file (less than 200k) copied
     to a formatted floppy disk and reduce it to a ZOW formatted file
     that takes up only one disk cluster!

     Sounds to good to be true?  Well you have to see it to believe
     it.  There's another catch.  You can only put one data file in
     each ZOW file.  And if you copy the ZOW file off the floppy disk
     it won't work.  You can ZOW as many files on a floppy as the
     floppy can hold.

     Aha, another question from someone out thar' in bbs land.  Why
     did I announce this new breakthrough in Fidonews instead of
     echomail?  Well I just want to demonstrate my unwillingness to
     participate in the packer politics.  The other packers are VERY
     fine software products and do represent a lot of good hard work!
     However I refuse to discuss my new product in the echomail forum.
     I've seen too many arguments from different people regarding the
     performance of the different packers, using different test files
     and different hardware.  I will, however, discuss it in netmail.

     FidoNews 6-13                Page 7                   27 Mar 1989


     I'll again mention the pluses and minuses of the current alpha
     test version of ZOW.  These are:

     Good Points:
     1.   A ZOW format file only takes up ONE cluster of a 360k,
          formatted 9 sector DSDD floppy disk, regardless of the size
          of the original data file.
     2.   You can have as many ZOW files on a floppy disk as it will
          *hold*.
     3.   It does NOT use Huffman coding or Lempil Zev W packing.
     4.   Because of the previous point, I am IRREVOCABLY going to
          release ZOW's algorithms and formats into the public domain.
     5.   I do not plan on using the shareware concept to distribute
          ZOW.

     Bad Points:
     1.   Only one data file may be packed into a ZOW formatted file.
          But who cares, the ZOW file only takes 2k!
     2.   The current size limit for a data file is about 200k.
     3.   The current version of ZOW will only work on floppy disks.
     4.   Files may not be packed across drives, I.E. source data
          files to be packed MUST be on the same disk as the
          destination ZOW file.
     5.   ZOW formatted files will not work when copied to another
          disk.  That means until I figure out how to get past a few
          problems it CANNOT be used in any mailers.
     6.   It won't be released until *after* I make sure that it will
          cause no harm to other disk drives on the system.  During
          the development stage I ran into this problem a lot.  But
          there are already a lot of people helping me with this, so
          beta testers are NOT needed.
     7.   Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware).

     In next week's article, I'll reveal the exact algorithms used in
     order to pack the data file and retrieve it.  Again, the formats
     and algorithms are public domain.  Irretrievably public domain!

     In the meantime, happy packing!

     The Veterinarian's Corner
     Excerpts from the ANIMED GroupMail Conference

     by Don Thomson, 1:102/1005

     Chocolate and Animals

     "A springer spaniel weighing 46 lbs developed generalized
     seizures and died about 15 hours after ingestion of two pounds of
     cholocate.... Serum samples.... pointed to this.... as the cause
     of death..." [excerpt taken from Journal American Animal Hospital
     Assoc.  Mar/Apr 1983]

     Over the past several years, chocolate poisoning has been
     increasingly recognized as a source of pet poisoning, even death,
     in the US. The caffeine-like principle in chocolate, Theobromine,
     is the agent responsible for these severe reactions.

     In man, theobromine is rapidly metabolised and removed from the
     circulation. While most of the theobromine is removed from the
     bloodstream of people within 8-10 hours, in the dog it takes much
     more than SIX DAYS, and possibly up to more than two WEEKS!

     Ever had your heart race, or develop tremors, even diarrhea from
     too much coffee? Imagine a racing heart, jittery muscles, and
     diarrhea cramps for a week. That racing heart, prolonged for days
     on end, may easily result in a fatal arrhythmia. Those muscle
     jitters may actually progress to convulsions. Yes, dogs die from
     getting into that Easter basket.  Worse yet, some well meaning
     owners actually give chocolate to their pets!

     Please be careful over the coming Easter Holidays with that
     chocolate. If you do find that your pet has gotten into it,
     please see you veterinarian IMMEDIATELY.  The time to treat this
     poisoning is BEFORE the chocolate is digested and absorbed. By
     inducing vomitting, and placing activated charcol in the dogs
     stomach we can limit the amount of theobromine absorbed into the
     bloodstream and hopefully head the problem off..... Treating the
     symptoms after the chocolate is absorbed.... Well.... My fingers
     are crossed.....

     On a lighter note:

     A dog's nails should be kept short enough so that they do not
     touch the ground when walking.  If you hear the nails 'clicking'
     as your pet walks across a hard floor or surface then they are
     too long.  Untrimmed nails are a potential source of a number of
     problems: splayed feet, sore nailbeds, or even a torn nail
     exposing the nail bed itself!  Ouch!

     Make sure too, that you regularly check the dewclaws (or "thumb
     claws") as they do not wear and may grow so long they actually
     curl and dig into the paw itself.  If unsure of how to trim
     nails, ask your vet or groomer, it really is simple to do.  And
     makes life so much more pleasant for your pet.

                   Rogel's Corner

     December, 1988              Electronic Edition
     ----------------------------------------------

            Panasonic's Laser Partner:
              A Dual-Bin Wunderwerk

     No question about it, the Hewlett-Packard
     LaserJet II is the standard in laser printers.
     Perhaps that is why I was so surprised to
     learn that the LaserJet II comes equipped with
     only one paper bin.

     Any serious business use of a laser printer
     requires two paper bins: one bin for the
     letterhead and a second bin to hold the
     non-letterhead stationery. True, you could
     print your own letterhead with a laser printer
     but the quality (at 300 dpi) is just not the
     same as you will get with commercially printed
     stationery (at 600, 1,250, or 2,450 dpi).

     An alternative suggested by some merchants
     stacking simply is not practicable in a busy
     office. What happens to your stack if two
     pages instead of one get pulled through the
     printer? Pages that should have printed on the
     letterhead paper will instead print on your
     non-letterhead stationery and vice-versa. How
     do you stack if you are sharing printers?
     Besides, who has the time to lay out stacks?

     Surely a second paper bin must be available as
     an option for the LaserJet II. Well, I asked
     several dealers and they were unaware of such
     an option. I then called Hewlett- Packard and
     learned that while they don't offer a second
     bin option, there are one or two third-party
     vendors who sell such a device at about the
     same cost as the LaserJet II, itself. [HP
     recently rolled out the HP LaserJet IID, which
     comes with 2 200-sheet paper trays and
     features duplex printing; it's list price is
     $4,295 and there is an optional envelope
     feeder for $350]

     So I took my search for a laser printer
     elsewhere. That's when I met the Panasonic
     Laser Partner.


     The Paper Tale
     --------------
     On paper, the Panasonic Laser Partner looks
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 11                  27 Mar 1989


     terrific (pun intended). It comes standard
     with a two-bin sheet feeder and a 500-page
     capacity compare this with 200 pages for the
     HP LaserJet II and the Brother HL-8, and 400
     pages for the HP LaserJet IID.

     The Laser Partner is a speed demon. It is
     rated at 11 ppm and, according to the October
     31, 1988 issue of PC Magazine, was timed at
     ``10.1 high enough to place it in the top
     ranks of all tested machines regardless of
     price.'' The LaserJet II and IID as well as
     the Brother HL-8 are rated at 8 ppm. This is a
     heavy duty machine, with a high duty cycle of
     5,000 pages per month. Even the life span of
     its consumables (i.e., toner, drum, developer)
     is higher than that of the LaserJet II
     standard-bearer; compare: 5,000 sheets for
     Panasonic's toner, 13,000 sheets for the drum,
     and 20,000 sheets for its developer vs. 4,000
     sheets for the LaserJet II's
     toner/developer/drum cartridge.

     When Panasonic's toner runs out, you simply
     replace the toner (available for about $35);
     when the LaserJet II's (or IID's or Brother
     HL-8's) cartridge runs out, you must replace
     the entire cartridge (at a cost of from
     $85-$115; you also can recharge the cartridge
     about 2 times, at a cost of approximately $45
     each time). Also consider that when the
     Panasonic's toner is running low, a light on
     the control panel advises you of this status;
     when the LaserJet II's toner runs low, it
     leaves an ugly and very noticeable streak
     across your paper.

     The Panasonic's specifications list a number
     of other goodies: it features 5 emulations
     (including the HP LaserJet Plus); 11 resident
     fonts; and all of the printer's controls are
     located on an accessible and easy to use front
     panel (there are no dip switches), which
     includes a 15-charac- ter LCD display for
     plain English status and error messages.

     Finally, the price was right. It lists for
     $2,595 but can be purchased for less than
     $1,500.


     The Proof is in the printing
     ----------------------------
     So how did the Panasonic fare? Quite honestly,
     I purchased the Panasonic with substantial
     reservation. Above all else, I needed a
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 12                  27 Mar 1989


     reliable printer for my legal practice. Judges
     and clients simply will not wait for
     ill-tempered prin- ters. Dare I choose
     something other than the LaserJet II?

     My concerns were heightened by several mixed
     reviews of the Laser Partner. As discussed in
     more detail below, most of the criticism is
     simply unfounded and one of the Panasonic's
     big selling points, the dual-bin paper trays,
     was given far less credit than it deserved.

     My first experience with the Laser Partner was
     horrifying. The output was inconsistent some
     pages were great and, then, other pages would
     contain garbage and distorted fonts. I noticed
     that the problems became particularly severe
     when I tried to print more than one page where
     multiple fonts were present. Then there were
     the error messages; these messages were not
     even explained in the manual's error message
     section.

     I tried contacting Panasonic's toll-free
     customer support but their telephone was
     incessantly busy. When I finally got through,
     I was greeted by a friendly support
     representa-tive. He suspected that my
     printer's memory board was malfunctioning but
     was unable to recommend a means for quickly
     remedying this problem.

     I then spoke with Customer Support Manager Joe
     Carney a true gem of a human being who
     enlisted the aid of the Panasonic marketing
     group in having a replacement printer sent to
     me by express delivery. Panasonic's prompt
     help and courtesies are sincerely appreciated
     but I wonder what would have happened if an
     ordinary professional or businessman (i.e.,
     someone who was not writing a review of the
     Laser Partner) had called and reported the
     problems I was experiencing. By copy of this
     review, I am inviting Panasonic to respond to
     this inquiry.

     [Panasonic's Laser Partner Product Manager
     responded as follows: He believes that if you
     cannot get the kind of service that the
     Panasonic name implies, then perhaps Panasonic
     does not deserve your business. Consistent
     with this philosophy, Panasonic has approached
     customer service from several angles. They
     have increased the number of full- time
     customer support personnel. Xerox Americare
     Service Centers are available to Panasonic
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 13                  27 Mar 1989


     customers (an on site service agreement also
     is available from Xerox for $150). Dealers and
     resellers are also encouraged to make service
     available. Finally, if you live out in the
     sticks or are otherwise dissatisfied with the
     service you are receiving, Panasonic will do
     whatever it reasonably takes to help you out
     this might entail flying a field engineer out
     to your place or, as in my situation, sending
     a replacement unit by express delivery. He
     also pointed out that whether a person is
     reviewing the Laser Partner or owns several of
     these units should not make a difference in
     the type of service they receive; he proceeded
     to offer anecdote after anecdote of
     extraordinary service provided mom & pop
     outfits with one Laser Partner. You know what?
     I believe this guy. He was very candid about
     the Laser Partner's pros and cons. He also was
     very proud of the Laser Partner. It's his baby
     and he speaks as a man determined to see that
     the Laser Partner be well received in this
     world, regardless of how much work it takes.]

     I do not hold my first printer's
     malfunctioning against Panasonic. Rocks are
     hard, water is wet, and malfunctions will
     happen to the best of us. The real question is
     how does a properly functioning Panasonic
     Laser Printer operate? The answer: like a
     wonderful dream come true.

     Let's start with setting the printer up.
     Panasonic's manual contains a simple
     installation section, complete with helpful
     illustrations and well written and concise
     instructions. Following their
     paint-by-the-numbers approach, I was able to
     complete installation and get my Laser Partner
     operational in about 15 minutes.

     According to PC Magazine's October 31, 1988
     review of the Laser Partner, the installation
     was criticized because

        ``when it comes time to add the
        toner, you are confronted with a
        large bottle that is topped with a
        spring-loaded cap. You hold the
        top open while gently waving the
        bottle over the toner bin, rolling
        the bottle back and forth in the
        air, until all the toner is in the
        bin.''

     I suppose that if you experience difficulty
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 14                  27 Mar 1989


     putting toothpaste on your toothbrush, then
     adding the toner would be a problem. As to the
     spring-loaded cap, we are talking here about
     the dexterity required to light a butane
     lighter and not to move mountains. But this
     is academic since Panasonic has replaced the
     spring-loaded cap with a plain vanilla cap (I
     saved my spring-loaded cap).

     The remaining consumable items the drum and
     developer come in cartridges and are easy
     to install, even for the weak-thumbed among
     us.

     The front panel contains push buttons for each
     printer operation. It is well thought out and
     intuitive. Although the printer manual rarely
     is needed, it is a model of clarity and
     organization. The manual not only contains a
     general index but also includes an index for
     each printer emulation.

     WordPerfect 5.0 and the Panasonic Laser
     Partner work well together (Panasonic advises
     me that most major programs now have a Laser
     Partner driver). The output is superb. The
     printed edition of this review, for instance,
     was printed on my Panasonic.

     Today one of my clients even complimented me
     on the print quality of a document I had
     prepared for his company (something that has
     never happened to me before) and wanted to
     know what I used to accomplish this (he
     guessed that I used a MacIntosh and PostScript
     printer).

     Some reviewers have complained about the Laser
     Partner's inability to properly print varying
     degrees of gray scale. Panasonic advises me
     that this was due to a bug in the pre-
     production models supplied reviewers.

     Try as I might, I simply could not duplicate
     these supposed gray-scale problems and,
     accordingly, must assume that Panasonic is
     correct in claiming that their production
     models have corrected this problem. Set out
     below are graphics boxes with gray-scale
     ranging from 10% to 100% [unfortunately I
     cannot duplicate these graphics boxes for
     those of you who are receiving the electronic
     version of this column]:


     One well-founded criticism concerns
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 15                  27 Mar 1989


     Panasonic's lack of a manual feed and the
     absence of a straight-through paper path for
     transparencies, other heavy stock, and
     envelopes. The Laser Partner's Product Manager
     explains that the lack of a manual feed is the
     result of a necessary trade off for the
     Panasonic's many other features and its low
     price; as long as the print material meets
     spec, the Laser Partner can handle it.

     I have not tried printing with transparencies
     yet and must therefore wait to see if this
     will be a problem. I also am waiting for an
     optional envelope cassette, which I suspect
     will provide an acceptable alternative to the
     straight-through paper path, at least for
     envelopes.

     The Panasonic Laser Partner has several
     options available, such as a 1 MB RAM
     expansion, legal paper cassette, en-
     velope cassette, and two font cartridges
     (KX-P470 & 471; compatible with the HP "F" &
     "T" cartridges, respectively).

     I am using the 1 MB RAM expansion, giving my
     Panasonic 1.5 MB of RAM. Each day I initialize
     my printer through WordPerfect 5.0 by
     downloading approximately 1.3 MB of fonts. It
     takes some time and surely is overkill but
     then I am able to use various fonts in the
     many documents I must produce and still have
     each document print within seconds of issuing
     the print command. When I was limited to 512
     K, each print job would generally take several
     minutes in order for the necessary fonts to be
     downloaded into the printer's limited memory.
     The expansion saves a substantial amount of
     time in this regard and would be a real plus
     for a busy office.

     I have not yet had an opportunity to review
     the cassettes or Panasonic's recently released
     font cartridges. Due to an unexpected demand
     for the envelope cassette, Panasonic was
     caught with an inadequate supply but has
     assured me that they will be able to meet
     demand in December. I will over these options
     as well as provide a follow-up in a future
     Rogel's Corner.

     Panasonic Laser Partner's top-of-the-line
     features and low price make it the perfect
     choice for automating a business. Indeed, if
     Panasonic can untangle their customer support
     problems, I suspect that the Laser Partner
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 16                  27 Mar 1989


     will become the laser printer standard.

           LaserTORQ
           ---------

     There is nothing new about print spoolers or
     buffers. Rather than wait for your printing
     task to be completed before resuming use of
     your computer, you dump your print job into a
     software or hardware buffer, which then prints
     in the background, so that you can proceed
     with your foreground computing.

     Unfortunately, in the past there were
     significant trade-offs: hardware systems
     offered excellent performance but at a
     preimium; software systems cost less but also
     offered lesser performance. All of that has
     changed, thanks to LaserTORQ, a software print
     spooler/accelerator from LaserTools.

     Using LaserTORQ with WordPerfect 5.0, I
     regained my cursor almost immediately after
     issuing the print command. Then, while my
     document printed at an accelerated speed in
     the background, I resumed computing without
     any degradation of foreground performance.

     LaserTORQ does its thing through a combination
     of an efficient use of your computer's
     interrupt system and high-speed buffering. The
     interrupt-based printing feature sends
     characters to the printer as soon as the
     printer is ready to receive them. This means
     that you can print in the background without
     suffering any noticeable slowdown of your
     foreground processing speed and, as an added
     bonus, the actual printing speed will be
     accelerated. The buffering feature allows you
     to regain use of your keyboard almost
     instantly after giving the "print" command.

     According to LaserTools, there are several
     print spooling benchmarks:

     1. Buffering speed: the rate at which a
        device (printer; spooler; LaserTORQ) can
        accept data to be printed.

        Performance: The developers of LaserTORQ
        claim that its product accepts data at
        over 100,000 cps versus 2,000 cps for
        other print spoolers versus 500 cps for
        laser printers (text) and 200 cps for
        dot-matrix printers (draft). They
        further claim that it took competing

        LaserTORQ took only 7 seconds.

     2. Printing speed: the rate at which
        printed pages are produced.

        Performance: LaserTORQ's developers
        claim that competing print spoolers take
        7.4 minutes to print a full page 300 dpi
        graphics file where LaserTORQ required
        only 1.9 minutes.

     3. CPU overhead: the percentage of your
        PC's time required to use the printer
        utility (i.e., spooler; LaserTORQ).

        Performance: LaserTools claims that
        competing print spoolers have a 40% CPU
        overhead factor versus 2% for LaserTORQ.

     4. Ease of use
     5. Costs

     Operation
     ---------
     The documentation is short, sweet, and
     helpful. Frankly, installation is so simple
     that you don't need the documenta-tion.
     LaserTORQ allows you to set up a print buffer
     on your conventional RAM memory, hard disk,
     expanded memory (LMS or EEMS), or extended
     memory.

     Once installed, LaserTORQ operates
     transparently and efficiently. If you want to
     make adjustments (i.e., activate the graphics
     compression feature), hit the hot-key and then
     point-and-shoot. It's as simple as that.

     I did have one problem, initially. The
     installation test of my printer did not work.
     LaserTORQ informed me that the problem was
     with my parallel port: early IBM parallel
     ports and those of several clones cannot
     generate the signal LaserTORQ needs.
     LaserTools sells a $15 parallel-port adaptor
     that corrects the problem (you could also
     command LaserTORQ to operate on a timer basis
     rather than on an interrupt basis but this
     results in a degradation of both printing and
     foreground processing speeds). I tried the
     adaptor; it fully corrected the problem.

     Another nice LaserTORQ feature is its
     flexibility. Unlike a hardware buffer which
     requires you to choose the buffer size at the
     time of purchase, you can adjust the LaserTORQ
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 19                  27 Mar 1989


     buffer to suit your changing needs and you can
     even change the type of buffer LaserTORQ uses
     (i.e., expanded or extended memory) so that
     you can use LaserTORQ to take full advantage
     of your growing computer needs without any
     additional costs.

     Downloading fonts typically takes a
     considerable period of time. Users have
     reported that their downloading time of over
     10 minutes has been reduced, when using
     LaserTORQ, to under 10 seconds.

     Another problem is an inadequate amount of
     printer memory to produce full page 300 dpi
     graphics. Printers such as the Hewlett-Packard
     LaserJet Plus, LaserJet II, and Panasonic
     Laser Partner, which come standard with 512K
     memory, can only print 1/3 page of 300 dpi
     graphics. There are memory boards for these
     printers but they typically cost between
     $300-$400. LaserTORQ's nifty
     graphics-compression feature allows HP
     compatible laser printers with only 512K to
     print a full page of 300 dpi graphics.

     Let's not forget price. There are many
     hardware and software fixes for the slow
     printer blues but they ordinarily cost much
     more and offer less flexibility than
     LaserTORQ, which costs $99 and there is no
     shipping charge. What's more, LaserTORQ comes
     with a 30-day unconditional, money-back
     guarantee.

     Finally, there is toll-free technical support.
     When I called their support staff, I was
     greeted by an answering machine. However my
     calls were almost always returned within 1-2
     hours and I find the support staff to be
     courteous, informed, and helpful.

     Although not reviewed here, mention should
     also be made of TORQ, LaserTools' version of
     LaserTORQ for dot-matrix, daisywheel, and
     inkjet printers. TORQ is a memory-resident
     program, requires 15K RAM, and you need an IBM
     PC, XT, AT, or compatible as well as DOS 2.0+.
     Lasertools recently released another software
     product, Trading Post, which makes
     non-PostSript speaking software (i.e., dBase
     III, Lotus 1-2-3) compatible with PostScript
     printers. Trading Post, which is not reviewed
     here, sells for $79.00. Both programs have the
     same consumer benefits offered with LaserTORQ:
     no shipping charge, toll-free technical

     the use of my computer while my documents are
     printing and there is no noticeable
     degredation in either the background printing
     or the foreground processing. In the past my
     work would be interrupted while I impatiently
     waited on my printer to complete its task; now
     my printer must wait on me. I wonder if
     Lasertools has any solution for that problem.

     I often find that the quality of a book
     reflects the exacting standards (or lack
     thereof) of the publisher. Peachpit Press is
     no exception: they have published the two gems
     reviewed here. For those who are interested,
     Peachpit Press also publishes: Ventural Tips
     and Tricks, 2nd Edition by Ted Nace ($22.95;
     448 pp.); The Macintosh Font Book by Erfert
     Fenton ($21.95; 300 pp.); IBM AT Clone Buyer's
     Guide and Handbook ($24.95); and, 386 Computer
     Buyer's Guide and Handbook ($29.95). To
     order, you may contact the publlisher at the
     address or telephone number set out in Rogel's

          LaserJet Unlimited, Edition II
             by
          Ted Nace & Michael Gardner

     The authors do an excellent job of covering
     everything you need to know about laser
     printers, including: setting up and
     maintaining a laser printer; operating the
     control panel as well as printer commands (for
     more advanced users); coordination of the
     printer with word processing software,
     spreadsheets, databases, and forms; desktop
     publishing, graphics, and fonts; special
     effects and tricky operations like
     envelope/label printing; and laser printer
     upgrades. I particularly liked the individual
     sections the authors devoted to special
     hardware and software (including shareware &
     public domain) utilities for the subjects
     under discussion.

     Don't let the title fool you. There is very
     little in this book that does not apply to all
     HP LaserJet compatible printers. Considering
     that any serious non-PostScript laser printer
     will emulate the LaserJet, the book has a wide
     application, indeed. Armed with this book even
     a novice can quickly and easily learn to use
     the laser printer proficiently.

     WordPerfect 5: Desktop Publishing in Style
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 22                  27 Mar 1989


                          by
                   Daniel Will-Harris

     Daniel Will-Harris covers every conceivable
     aspect of desktop publishing with WordPerfect
     5.0 in exacting but easy to understand detail.
     In short, this book demystifies WordPerfect's
     formidable desktop publishing features.

     My only criticisms deal more with style than
     substance. First, the author provides the bare
     minimum of information about the keystrokes
     required to perform a certain operation. I
     would have preferred a bit more explanation so
     that I would not have to go to my computer to
     see what the author meant by "ALT-F9 T C".
     Second, the author is rather heavy handed in
     his use of humor. Humor can be nice as a
     seasoning for a technical book but becomes
     annoying, at least to me, when it becomes one
     of the main courses.

     This is probably the best technical book I
     have ever read. There is hardly a paragraph
     that does not contain some new and innovative
     suggestion. In fact, I was so eager to learn
     what marvellous suggestions the author would
     make next, that I found it difficult to put
     the book down.

     Comments: Will-Harris' book should be
     required reading for anyone using WordPerfect
     5.0. I have never read a book so packed with
     truly helpful suggestions. In fact, there is
     hardly a paragraph that does not contain some
     new and exciting idea. Once you open this book
     up, it's hard to put down.

     /***   TELEBIT/UUNET INTERNET DOMAIN NAME DISCOUNT PROGRAM    ***/
                                 (IDNDP)

     The  Telebit Corporation, in conjunction with UUNET  Communications
     Services,  is offering a special 50% promotional discount  off  the
     list  price  of  TrailBlazer Plus modems to qualified organizations
     using Internet domain names.  Networks like Usenet and BITNET where
     domain  names  may  not  be  the precise addressing scheme may also
     qualify.

     Telebit has demonstrated  its  commitment  to  the UNIX marketplace
     with its specific support  for the UUCP protocol and the support of
     TrailBlazer  modems  on  the USENET.    This  announcement  signals
     Telebit's extended support for the use  of  its  products in dialup
     TCP/IP environments.

     UUNET  Communications Services will be assisting Telebit  with  the
     program's  administration  as  well  as the distribution of  dialup
     TCP/IP software.

     /***********************
     *  WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?
     ***********************/

     Any  autonomous  organization  legitimately  participating  on  the
     Internet  by use  of  Internet  domain  names  can  qualify.    The
     organization must be physically located within the 50 United States
     or Canada.  One or  two  Telebit  TrailBlazer  Plus  modems  may be
     purchased at a 45% or 50%  discount  off  the  US  or Canadian list
     price.  Discount levels are determined by  payment  method and will
     be explained below.

     PTT  restrictions  and distribution contracts prohibit Telebit from
     directly  selling  modems  outside  the  United  States.    Telebit
     Technologies of  Canada,  has  agreed  to  extend  the terms of the
     Internet  discount  program    to    all  Canadian  sites.    Other
     international users are encouraged  to  contact  Telebit  Inc.  for
     local distributor information.  A  similar  program  may be offered
     through local distribution on a per country, per demand basis.

     For  the  sake  of this program,  Internet  participation  will  be
     defined  by  an  organization's  participation in the  Domain  Name
     Service.  Any organization with a registered domain name advertised
     by a network name server will be immediately qualified  to purchase
     a total of two Telebit TrailBlazer Pluses.

     In  addition  all  UUNET  members  immediately  qualify to purchase
     modems as  long  as  they have not previously purchased 2 modems on
     the Telebit Usenet Discount Program.

     Autonomous organizations residing as third level sub-domains, nodes
     or some other form  of  demarcation  not  directly reachable via an
     Internet Domain Name Server may  also  qualify  for  the program by
     FidoNews 6-13                Page 27                  27 Mar 1989


     demonstrating on their applications the nature  of  their  autonomy
     and their relationship to a second level  domain  reachable  via  a
     domain name server.

     /*************
     * For example:
     **************/

     A large university may list a single second level domain (foou.edu)
     as the only way to reach all campus machines.  However, within that
     campus  domain  there    potentially    exist  multiple  autonomous
     organizations, i.e.  College  of  Computer  Science  (cs.foou.edu),
     Dept.    of  Engineering  (eng.foou.edu),    Department    of   Foo
     (foo.foou.edu), etc.

     In  the case of a very  large  company  with  internal,  autonomous
     divisions, each could qualify under the program rules.  However, it
     must be shown that the division operates as  a  completely separate
     entity.    For  instance,  the  Chevrolet and Pontiac divisions  of
     General Motors, (chevrolet.gm.com, pontiac.gm.com).

     Two  pseudo domains exist on the Internet that do not  fit  exactly
     into the Domain Name structure.  They are Usenet (UUCP) and BITNET.

     In  the  case  of  BITNET, individual node sites that constitute an
     autonomous organization would qualify under the program.

     In the  case  of  Usenet,  organizations  that  HAVE NOT previously
     purchased 2 modems  on  the  Telebit  Usenet  Discount  Program may
     qualify by reporting their existing domain name or by registering a
     domain name for their site.    UUNET  provides  a  low,  fee  based
     service for the the registration of  a  domain  name.  If you are a
     UUCP site without a domain name and  would  prefer  registration be
     taken care of for you, contact UUNET at the below addresses.

     The  program is designed as a promotion.   This  allows  individual
     organizations an  opportunity  to  experience Telebit's TrailBlazer
     Plus high speed  modems at an attractive price.  It is not designed
     as  a  mechanism  to    fulfill   an  organization's  entire  modem
     requirements.

     If your organization resides as  a  third or lower level domain and
     gains  access  to  the  Internet  indirectly  via  a  higher  level
     organization  you  must  supply the nature of  your  organization's
     autonomy and describe the relationship to that higher level domain.

     A  brief explanation of your organization's autonomous relationship
     to  a  second  level domain should suffice.  Telebit  reserves  the
     right  to  validate  each  application using the criteria described
     herein, granting  or  refusing  sale accordingly.  A total limit of
     four (4) modems  per  second  level domain may be enforced if it is
     deemed by Telebit that  all  autonomous  organizations  within that
     domain have been satisfied.

     *  THE TELEBIT TRAILBLAZER PLUS

     *******************************/

     The Telebit TrailBlazer is the  most advanced dialup communications
     technology on the market today.   TrailBlazer  offers compatibility
     at 300, 1200 (V.22 and Bell 212), and 2400 bps.  In high speed (PEP
     mode), the TrailBlazer can operate at 18,000 bps on ordinary dialup
     phone  lines, (over 16,000 bps throughput).  TrailBlazer's patented
     multicarrier technology  dynamically  adapts  to phone line quality
     and delivers the  highest  throughput  possible for each individual
     line.  In August 1987, Telebit announced enhanced features that are
     designed to allow the TrailBlazer  to  work  optimally  with  UUCP,
     Kermit, XMODEM, and YMODEM protocols.

     In addition, the modem may be  configured, by use of an S register,
     to perform the compress/decompress algorithms (based on  Unix's 4.0
     compress) in real time, WITHIN the modem.

     /************************
     *  Standard Dialup TCP/IP
     *************************/

     With  the  release  of Berkeley 4.3, a framing  protocol  known  as
     Serial  Line  Internet  Protocol  (SLIP)  has spread throughout the
     Internet.  Several System V, VMS, MAC and PC vendors have picked up
     on  the  protocol and are supporting it as well.  The  protocol  is
     documented in RFC 1055.

     Basically the  protocol  specifies  a method for framing IP packets
     with a magic  character  and escaping that character and the escape
     character in the data stream.  The protocol does not address issues
     of connection establishment, host authenticity, or things like data
     integrity or data compression techniques.

     However, execution of SLIP across high speed dialup modem links has
     proven very useful to a number of  IP  users.    FTPs  can  deliver
     1000-1600 characters per second (cps).  Performance depends on your
     system  and the version of TCP that you are  running.    SMTP  runs
     quite well.    Interactive applications, telnet and rlogin, perform
     with noticable character  delay,  the  result  of very large packet
     sizes associated with each character typed.

     /*******************
     * New Dial Up TCP/IP
     ********************/

     The good news accompanying  this  announcement  is about the recent
     work  to produce a new  dialup  IP  protocol  that  employs  header
     prediction  and  compression  techniques.  This  code  dramatically
     reduces  the  packet  overhead  associated with small,  interactive
     packets like those produced by telnet or rlogin.

     At the time of Release 1.0 of this document the public availability
     of this new code is undefined.  However, it  is  the  intention  of
     Telebit  and UUNET to make available all known working versions  of
     standard SLIP.  In addition it is our intention to demonstrate  and
     serve  to  distribute all new dial-up IP source code as soon as  it

     becomes available.

     Further we will provide documentation and installation instructions
     for all versions that we distribute.    Please  mail  to Telebit or
     UUNET  as  instructed  below  to  acquire  the  latest  information
