     Just a little bit early in compilation so I can watch those Packers
     do unto the Patriots what they did unto my Jaguars! [snicker]

     [Football for your non-Zone 1 folks.]

     The WebRing server is still in transition. Those of you still trying
     to link your webpages to the FidoNet webring please note the notice
     at the end of this Issue. I will advise all when they get it back up.

     I got an inquiry from a fellow in Denmark [who seems to have written a
     FidoNet to Internet mail/file handling utility for Windows95] about
     writing an article for FidoNews detailing his invention. I told him to
     go ahead and send me one. In the meantime, if you want to look at his
     effort [it's 19 pounds sterling], his site is at:

                 http://www.terminate.com/fido2int.htm

     Other than those, it's been a slow week here at FidoNews. Still no new
     ASCII art or .BIOs. [sigh]

     Go Packers! [grin]

     The PALMTOPS ECHO

     by Jim Henry, 1:273/408, jim@airgunhq.com

          The PALMTOPS echo is a new echo I started for users of
     various Palmtop computers, such as but not limited the HP 100LX
     and HP 200LX.  What IS a Palmtop?  More than just an electronic
     organizer, a Palmtop is a real PC no larger than a video cassette,
     and most are considerably smaller.  The HP Palmtops fit easily
     into a shirt pocket and are loaded with built in software, such as
     Lotus 1-2-3, an appt. scheduler, phone book, word processor,
     telecommunications, scientific calculator, Quicken, and more.
     Then you can add even more software depending on what your needs
     are.  Among the other software I have added, is a ballistics
     program I can use at the range, and 1ST Reader, the combination
     terminal program and Qwkmail reader from Sparkware.  Using 1st
     Reader on my Palmtop, I have been able to reclaim what other-wise
     would be lost or un-productive time. I can catch up on my email
     when stuck in the waiting room at my car dealer, or doctor's
     office.  Beats the heck out of reading 6 month old magazines!
     Waiting in the car to pick up my kids after school is another
     opportunity to read and reply to mail on my Palmtop.  The PALMTOPS
     echo is not yet on the backbone, but please do join us and help
     make it happen.  Pick up a feed from me at 1:273/408, or Jim
     Balcom at 1:109/334.  One final warning: Palmtops are addictive!

     FSC-0024 - A Proposal for a Type-3 Mail Bundle - Oliver McDonald


                 Notes on Type three bundlers.

                      The first  important note is that without Wynn
                 Wagner's work on FTSC-0014, none of this would have come
                 to fruition.  I owe him a great debt in this area, as well
                 as the debt for Opus itself that got me into this.  Thanks
                 Wynn.

                      Type 3  bundlers offer  opportunities for new levels
                 of sophistication in mail processing.  As the first step
                 Aurora Computer Technologies plans to provide the minimum
                 specified by the  existing Type 3 bundle specifications
                 with one minor addition.  This addition is the inclusion
                 of the features of ReMapper.   This addition  is not  a
                 required  inclusion for other software authors producing a
                 Type 3 bundler.

                      To sum up, standard required features are:

                   Must be able to create and unbundle Type 2 Bundles (See
                     FSC-0001)
                   Must be able to create and unbundle Type 3 Bundles (See
                     attached)
                   Must be able to Toss EchoMail from either Type 2 OR 3
                     bundles
                   Must generate an update-required message for the sysop
                     if the MinorVersion changes.
                   Must generate an update-required message if it
                     encounters a misc packet type it does not recognize.

                      Initial optional features are:

                   May Duplicate the functionality of ReMapper.
                   May automatically generate an F.Req. from source of
                     bundle when the minor version changes.
                   May generate an F.Req from source of bundle if it
                     encounters a misc packet type it does not recognize.
                   All error messages are placed in Matrix Mail messages to
                     the Sysop.
                   Will create outbound bundles on the fly from the inbound

                     bundle.  Does not need to scan these messages.  Note,
                     if this option is exercised it is IMPERATIVE that the
                     areas are scanned prior to the unbundle process.

                      Type 3.0 proposal (preliminary)

                      This proposal allows for automatic updating of the
                 Type 3 bundle  to allow  for further  revisions and
                 enhancements.  Thus we will refer to it as a Type 3.0 with
                 further versions becoming Type 3.1 etc.

                      All multi-byte  data forms (int/long) are considered
                 to have the  MSB first and the LSB last.  Int is two
                 bytes, and Long is four.

                           Bundle Header

                   struct _BundleHeader {
                              struct _Address  B_Destination;
                              struct _Address  B_Origination;
                              unsigned nybble  B_BundlerVersionMajor;
                              unsigned nybble  B_BundlerVersionMinor;
                              unsigned byte    B_ProductCode;
                              unsigned byte    B_VersionMinor;
                              unsigned byte    B_VersionMajor;
                              unsigned long    B_CreationTime;
                              unsigned byte    B_Password[8];
                   };

                                Bundle Header Notes

                      This works out to 32 bytes which is a nice size to
                 work with.

                      Here follows a short explanation for each field:

                      "B_BundlerVersionMajor/Minor"   provide   for
                 version numbers from  0.0 to  16.16, this  should be
                 enough for all except TJ.

                      "B_ProductCode" is  the  FTSC  assigned  product
                 code.  This can  be used  to identify  just which  type  3
                 bundler created the  bundle; it should not be considered
                 an error if this  is   unidentified,  and   need  not  be
                 processed on unbundling but  MUST be included _correctly_
                 at the bundling stage.

                      "B_VersionMinor"  is   a  version   number  that
                 will initially start  at Zero  and is  used to allow non
                 backward compatible changes  to Type 3 bundles, such as
                 header length change. If  this   is  LOWER  in  the bundle
                 than the corresponding version  number in  the unbundler
                 it should abend.   It is  suggested that a short message
                 be written to the Sysop  in NETMAIL  with as much
                 information gleaned from the header  as possible.  (All
                 info  up  to  and including "B_VersionMajor".)

                      "B_VersionMajor", always 3.  This and all data prior
                 to this point  is position  dependant and will never be
                 changed in future Type 3.0 bundle revisions.

                      "B_CreationTime" is  an Unix  1970 based  creation
                 time indicating the time/date the bundle was created.

                      "B_Password" is  a NULL padded character array that
                 may contain uppercase  alpha bytes  or ASCII  digits.  It
                 should not  contain   lowercase  characters,  punctuation,
                 control characters etc.  A maximum of 8 characters are
                 significant.

                           Struct _Address

                   struct _Address {
                              unsigned int     Zone;
                              unsigned int     Net;
                              unsigned int     Node;
                              unsigned int     Point;
                   };

                   struct _AddressShort {
                              unsigned int     Net;
                              unsigned int     Node;
                   };

                           Bundle Footer

                   Struct _BundleEnd {
                              Unsigned Byte    E_Packet_Type  /* Always 0
                     * /
                   };

                                Bundle Footer notes.

                      All bundles  end with  this packet.  It is not
                 optional and the  packet should  be  considered  grundged
                 if  it  is missing.

                           Area header

                   Struct _AreaHeader
                              Unsigned byte    E_Packet_Type  /* Always 1
     */
                              Unsigned byte    E_NameLength   /* Actual
                     bytes in E_NAME */
                              Unsigned Byte    E_Name[1]      /* Variable
                     length field */

                                Area Header Notes

                      The area header packet marks the start of a sequence
                 of messages destined  to the  same  message  area.    The
                 area indicated in  the Area Header will remain valid until
                 either the end of the bundle OR another Area Header is
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 6                   27 Jan 1997


                 encountered.

                      E_Name will  usually contain  the area name of the
                 echo area that subsequent messages should go.  If
                 E_NameLength is zero then  the subsequent  messages should
                 go  the  NetMail area.   Any messages  that occur  prior
                 to  the  first Area Header in a bundle should also go to
                 the Netmail area.

                      The Maximum value for E_NameLength is 63.

                      E_Name is NOT null terminated.

                           Message Header

                   Struct _MessageHeader {
                              Unsigned byte    M_Packet_Type  /* Always 2

                                Message Header Notes

                      Every message  begins with a message header packet.
                 It should  be   created  by   the  system   where  the
                 message originated.   If there  are any intermediate stops
                 along the way it  is the  responsibility of  the
                 intermediate systems along the  way to  maintain all  of
                 the information without modification.

                      None  of   M_From,  M_To,  or  M_Sub  are  to  be
                 NULL terminated.

                      The message  body  is  considered  one  or  more
                 _Text packets.

                      No _Text  packet will  be more  that 1000H  bytes
                 long (that's 4096  to the  terminally base  10 folks).  Of
                 course there may  be a  near infinite  number of  _Text
                 packets per bundle/Message header,  but you  are
                 absolutely  positively guaranteed that with the type 3.x
                 method you will never need a buffer larger than 1000H.

                      In addition to ASCII values 20h through 7Eh
                 (inclusive) the following  control codes  are legal for
                 TEXT data.  Note that <CR> and <softCR> are NOT in this
                 list, thus type three packers will eliminate spurious
                 0Dh's.

                   <LF>                        0Ah            Forced

                   <dle>      10h              Replicate

                      Other control  characters and  values 7Fh and above
                 are symptomatic of a grundged message.

                      Replicate is  a  three  byte  sequence:  <dle>
                 <value> <length>.   For example  if a packet contains the
                 bytes 10h, 20h, 09h  it should  be expanded in the message
                 body as nine <space> characters.

                      There is  no minimum  or maximum  line  length,  it
                 is assumed that  the reader  can supply  the  appropriate
                 line wraps.

                      One "line" of a message may cross from one _Text
                 packet to another.

                 in the unbundled messages.   If  the  auto-rebundleing  is
                 used  it  is not necessary  to   process  the   seenby's
                 into  the unpacked messages.   It is suggested that if
                 this approach is used it is HEAVILY tested prior to
                 implementation, and that it still store the data somewhere
                 for retrieval in case of unresolved dupe problems.

                      The Cargo  info packet  will only  be found in a Type
                 3 arcmail bundle  that contains  files.  It will always be
                 the always second packet in a bundle.

                      This packet  is sent  to a  Type 3.x  node in the
                 first bundle to  be sent  to that node.  The bundler
                 should detect that the  node can  accept a Type 3.x bundle
                 from a nodelist flag.   It will  automatically generate
                 this packet at that point.   Should a  type 3.x  bundle
                 come from a node that is not identified  in the  nodelist
                 as  type  3.x  capable the bundler should  mark that  node
                 as  Type  3.x capable  and generate a warning message.

                      NI_Flags, is  a bit  mapped field  that identifies
                 the characteristics of  the node.  Some of this
                 information will duplicate that  information found  in the
                 nodelist.  This is used as a check.

                      Bits 1,  2, &  3 are  used to determine how mail may
                 be packed for this node (SEA, PKWare, ZOO)

                   Bits 1 & 2 & 3:             Meaning:
                   000:       No packing.
                   001:       SEA Archive format.
                   011:       PKWare LZW packing format.
                   100:       ZOO Compression system.

                      Note that  these bits  were intended to be combined,
                 so that if  a node  could handle  ZOO and SEA Archives it
                 would set the  bits to  '101'.   Since by  definition
                 PKWare can handle SEA  format Arc's  it is  considered
                 standard to set both bits for a PKWare capable system.

                      Bits 4  and 5  are used to determine how mail should
                 be sent to this node (CM, hold, direct)

                   Bit 4 & 5: Meaning:

                   00:        Direct
                   01:        Continous

                      The sysop  should be  able to  clear the  sent info
                 bit should the status of his system change (ie becomeing
                 an NC).  Zone gates  may be  identified by  the fact that
                 they are in Net 1  and they are both an ingate and an
                 outgate.  The zone they are the gate for is identified by
                 their node number.

                      The Misc info packet(s) are the last packets
                 associated with a  message, there  may be  more  than  one
                 in  extreme circumstances, but  this should  prove to  be
                 unlikely.  The bundler  must   retain  any  information
                 in  these packets unchanged if it is a routed message.

                      This is  a catch  all packet  that replaces the
                 dreaded IFNA kludge.   It  is designed to only be used as
                 an interim method.   At present  all IFNA  kludges are
                 handled in other special purpose  packets, it  is foreseen
                 that any further kludges will  be handled  only by
                 miscinfo packets until the Type 3.x  bundle specification
                 can be  updated and coded to handle the new data.

                      MiscInfo packets  in the  range 80h  -  F0h  should
                 be preserved if  not understood.   It  should be
                 considered an error condition  to find a MiscInfo packet
                 with in the range 04h -  7Fh, this  range is reserved for
                 future expansions on Type 3  packets.   Packets in  the
                 range F1h - FFh should be unpacked AND  a warning  message
                 should be generated.  These numbers will be used on an
                 extremely temporary basis as they are designed  for
                 ESSENTIAL  IFNA kludges  and will be added into the Type
                 3.x specification as quickly as possible.

                           Arcmail and Type 3.x

                      Type 3.x  bundlers support  arcmail much  the same
                 way that the type 2 bundlers do.  There are some
                 enhancements in the arcmail  naming scheme  however, that
                 help reduce system overhead for routed mail.

                      For arcmail  destined for  type 2 based systems the
                 old reliable method of arcmail file naming will be used,
                 IE:

                   NNNNnnnn.ww#

                      Where NNNN  is a  four hex  digit net number, nnnn is
                 a four hex  digit node  number, ww is a two character
                 weekday-name identifier,  and #  is the  packet number for
                 that day.  Type 3.x  packers SHOULD  generate the  day
                 name  correctly rather than the OMMM 1.08 cyclic method.

                      Here  follows  a  suggested  Type  3.x  ArcMail
                 naming scheme, basically a modification of Roeland Meyer's
                 original proposal.   I have  been made  aware that
                 Roeland has some things  to   say  on   this,  but   there
                 seems   to  be a communications break  between us, so
                 until I can contact him I will stick with this.

                      For Arcmail  destined to  a Type  3.x system (with
                 Type 3.x bundles  internally), a  variation of  the method
                 first proposed by  Roeland Meyer  will be  used.   Here
                 follows a quick synopsis:

                 reasons for this;  first, we  wanted to  allow the
                 maximum range of Zone:Net/Node  numbers   to  be
                 available;  second, anyone running points  should not  be
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 13                  27 Jan 1997


                 doing  so on a minimal system anyway.

                      Note(2),  Special   bundle  names   (ZZZ  or  000)
                 are implemented optionally  by the  destination.  You
                 should not assume that  it will  work.   A future  Type
                 3.x  spec will include password protection for this.

                      The logic for providing for up to 100 packets
                 allowable to a  specific node  is that  I have seen cases
                 of a :CM Net Host generating  in excess  of 10 messages
                 for a node in one day, and the next logical number is 100.

                      Should a  Type 3.x  destination fall  outside the
                 range available to  the Type  3.x arcmail limits, then the
                 bundler will fall back and use the Type 2 arcmail naming
                 scheme.

                      Notes on Zone Gates

                      With type 3 bundles the ZoneGates software load is
                 MUCH easier, all  it has  to do  is simply  forward the
                 Type 3.x bundle.   It is  suggested that  it may be VERY
                 desirable to have Type  3.x bundlers  duplicate the
                 functionality of the Zone Gate  software.   At the  very
                 least  it  is STRONGLY suggested  that   ZoneGates
                 upgrade  to  Type  3.x capable bundlers as soon as they
                 become available.

                      Notes for Type 3.x Developer's:

                      The latest  specs for Type 3.x will be available in
                 the FTSC library  at all  times and at 1:342/1.
                 Developer's who register with  1:342/1 will  have upcoming
                 changes netmailed to them  as they are confirmed.  Any
                 upcoming change notices will have  a date  officially
                 implemented.   This  date will always be in the future and
                 should be considered an official release date of the new
                 Type 3.x standard.

                      Every attempt  will be  made  to  allow  developer's
                 a reasonable time  period to  upgrade to the new standard.
                 It is important  that developer's  attempt to meet this
                 date as these changes  are usually  NOT backward
                 compatible.  Code samples will  also be  F.Req'able from
                 1:342/1 as the magic file name  TYPE3x where x is the
                 latest revision to the Type 3 standard.   Should  a
                 developer  be  unable  to  meet the release  date   he
                 should  notify  the  FTSC  and/or 342/1 immediately.   The
                 release date is based on an estimate made by Aurora
                 Computer Technologies.  If there is a good reason the
                 release  date will  be pushed  back, and  ALL developers
                 will be  notified.  As the new Type 3.x standard will not
                 be official until  the release  date no developer will
                 release his code early.

                      On that  subject, care should be taken by the
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 14                  27 Jan 1997


                 developer to let  no new  format bundles escape his beta
                 test systems.

                 There are  a couple of approaches we recommend for this,
                 the first is  to have  beta test  versions only generate
                 the new format bundle  for  specific  zone:net/node
                 addresses,  the second is  to set  up a  completely
                 separate private net for testing purposes.

                      Release method:   Since  the bundler will
                 automatically spread news of itself with use, a simple
                 zero effort release program may  be used.  As different
                 versions of the Type 3.x bundlers will  require different
                 operating environments, you should try  to get  your
                 bundler  made  available  on  Echo-BackBone and  Echo Hub
                 systems.  The reasoning behind this, is that  it is  from
                 these systems that the existence of the new bundler  will
                 become  common knowledge.  The other place to send  it
                 would  be the  Zone, Regional, and maybe Net Coordinators.

                      Future of Type 3

                      Since the  Type 3  format proposed  provides for  a
                 new level of  information exchange in Matrix mail I
                 provide here a few advance hints of what is planned.

                           AutoEcho built in.

                      Replace AutoEcho/AreaFix with automatic security.
                 This security is  such that  the hub  will not  need  to
                 pick  a password and send it in netmail to the downstream
                 node prior to the downstream node requesting echos.

                        Instead, the downstream node will request an echo,
                 at which point  the  Hub's  bundler  will  generate  a
                 netmail message to  the Hub  Sysop.  Now the hub Sysop may
                 decide to give it  to him.  If he does, he simply tells
                 his bundler to start sending it downstream to him.

                      Now since  this last  paragraph  has  already
                 confused people, I  will provide  a scenario with names.
                 Here in Net 342 we  have our  NEC as  Brian McCullough
                 (BDMc for short), and our  REC is  Steve Barnes (SB).  We
                 have BDMc requesting the echo NET_DEV from SB.  The
                 sequence is as follows:

                   BDMc requests NET_DEV.
                   BDMc's bundler sees this and generates the echo request
                     packet.
                   This packet is bundled and sent to SB.
                   SB's bundler finds the bundle.
                   SB's bundler sees that BDMc is authorized to have that
                     echo.
                   SB's Bundler generates an acknowledge packet and starts
                     sending the echo to BDMc.
                   BDMc's Bundler gets the acknowledge and sets up the
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 15                  27 Jan 1997


                   area.  BDMc's Bundler will use the password it was sent
                   for future requests.

                      If there  was a  problem with  access to  the
                 requested echo Steve Barnes would have received a NetMail
                 message from his bundler  and he would be able to make a
                 decision at this point.  Other than that he need not even
                 be in the country.

                      Minor details  on this,  the Hub (or upstream node)
                 can specify levels  of  permission  for  this  autoecho
                 request process, and deny certain echos to certain
                 downstream nodes.  If a  downstream node  requests a
                 denied echo, the upstream node's bundler  will again
                 generate a netmail message to the Hub Sysop informing him
                 of what happened.

                      This  will   probably  be  implemented  as  a
                 downward compatible  upgrade   with  the  request  for
                 new software triggered by  the first  request for  a new
                 echo.  Note, if standard distribution  applies this should
                 never generate a request.  However as things do not always
                 work that way, the automatic notification  and optional
                 file  request  should solve any major problems.

                           Fowarding of bundles that costs money.

                      All forwarded  bundles that  will cost  money  will
                 be marked as  HOLD unless  either the  receiving OR the
                 sending node are  marked as  send-to or  accept-from
                 appropriately.  All keywords  will be  valid in  these
                 cases.    This  is a completely backwards compatible
                 change.

                           Forwarding Cost bundles from Points.

                      The forwarding of cost bundles from points will be
                 done on the  basis of  a credit  that the  point has.  The
                 credit will be  monitored in  the USER.BBS  file, with
                 the  record number corresponding  to  the  point  number.
                 This  is a completely backwards compatible change.

                 require an update.  It is my feeling that if you are aware

                               Historical Overview

     Wynn Wagner III, the author of Opus-CBCS, developed a method of
     storing video control codes in a file sent to the Opus caller which
     was meant as a replacement of ANSI escape codes. Its main advantages
     were:

             o  The codes are smaller than ANSI, thus needing less disk
                storage space.

             o  The codes are in the binary form easily interpreted by the
                computer (ANSI sequences use ASCII).

             o  The same file can be sent to callers who do or do not have
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 17                  27 Jan 1997


                the ability of interpreting ANSI codes - in the former case
                the codes are first translated to ANSI, in the latter they
                are ignored.

     Because of lack of an appropriate name, Wynn temporarily named the
     codes oANSI with the understanding that a better name was needed.

     When I started working on my TinyTerm communications program, I had
     the idea that if Opus-CBCS could send the "oANSI" codes directly over
     the phone lines, it would speed up the communications considerably. A
     typical ANSI sequence contains 4 times as many bytes as the codes
     developed by Wynn Wagner.

     A phone call to Wynn resulted in two things:

             o  TinyTerm can interpret the "oANSI" codes and translate
                them to ANSI, then send them to stdout where they are
                converted to colors by ANSI.SYS.

             o  Opus-CBCS, starting with gamma version 1.10.iii, will
                send the codes without converting them to ANSI sequences.
                (It will still send ANSI codes to users without the proper
                terminal software.)

     I took over the coding of the part of Opus handling the video codes. I
     realized the codes were offering us much more power than just
     translating them to ANSI escape sequences. I proposed to call the
     codes AVATAR, the Advanced Video Attribute Terminal Assembler and
     Recreator. Wynn readily accepted the new name.

                          The Two Levels of Avatar

     Avatar is more than a video attribute controller. It is a protocol
     which, if need be, can totally eliminate the interference of line
     noise.  However, this document is not concerned with the advanced
     topics of Avatar (which no program is using as of this writing).

     A full Avatar session with all its advanced features starts by
     exchanging the AVINIT packets. The caller sends a packet which
     describes the video capabilities of his/her system. It also contains
     the caller's name, password and some other optional information. It
     also tells the BBS if the user is calling in person or just emulating
     a BBS session with an Avatar terminal program.

     The called system (the BBS) replies to the AVINIT packet with a packet
     that informs the user of his current status, e.g. you can stay till
     16:30 GMT, or you are denied access, or I am processing mail now but
     you can call back at 10:43 GMT, etc.

     Until such AVINIT packets are exchanged, only the Avatar commands that
     were part of the original oANSI codes can be sent from the BBS to the
     caller.  The caller's term program should send no Avatar commands,
     with the exception of function key codes, before the AVINIT packets
     are exchanged. This assures that a BBS program which does not support
     full Avatar can still take advantage of the faster transfer of video
     codes using Avatar as opposed to ANSI escape sequences. It also
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 18                  27 Jan 1997


     permits the caller whose term program does not support full Avatar but
     can interpret the basic codes to take advantage of the term program's
     abilities.

     The two levels of Avatar then are: a full session and a basic session.
     This document is concerned with the BASIC Avatar session only. The
     full session will be defined in a separate document.

                            Basic Avatar Commands

     Before the AVINIT packets are exchanged, the BBS can send the basic
     Avatar commands if so permitted by the user's choice, typically
     recorded in the user datafile (e.g. USER.BBS). Because Avatar is
     window oriented, in a basic session the full screen is considered the
     default window.  Further, the default color of the window is assumed
     to be 3 (cyan text on a black background). All bytes are taken at
     their face value without escaping.  However, save for one exception
     described below, no basic Avatar code will have the high bit set.
     Therefore, the term program should reset the high bit of all bytes
     except as described below.

     The basic commands are:

             <^L>    -       clear the current window and set current
                             attribute to default. In the basic session
                             this means: Clear the screen and set its
                             attribute to 3.

             <^Y>    -       Read two bytes from the modem. Send the first
                             one to the screen as many times as the binary
                             value of the second one. This is the exception
                             where the two bytes may have their high bit
                             set. Do not reset it here!

             <^V> <^A> <attr> - Set the color attribute to <attr>. The
                             default attribute remains unchanged. However,
                             all text will be displayed in <attr> until the
                             next ^V^A, ^V^B, or ^L.

             <^V> <^B>   -   Turn the high bit of current attribute on. In
                             other words, turn blink on.

             <^V> <^C>   -   Move the cursor one line up. Do nothing, if
                             you already are at the top line of the current
                             window.

             <^V> <^D>   -   Move the cursor one line down. Do nothing if
                             you already are at the bottom line of the
                             current window.

             <^V> <^E>   -   Move the cursor one column to the left. Do
                             nothing if you already are at the leftmost
                             column of the current window.

             <^V> <^F>   -   Move the cursor one column to the right. Do
                             nothing if you already are at the rightmost
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 19                  27 Jan 1997


                             column of the current window.

             <^V> <^G>   -   Clear the rest of the line in the current
                             window using the current attribute (not to be
                             confused with the default attribute).

             <^V> <^H> <row> <col>   -   Move the cursor to the <row> <col>
                             position within the current window.

     Comments:

     Current attribute and default atribute are not necessarily the same.
     Whenever the window is cleared by the <^L> command, the current
     attribute is made equal to the default attribute. There is also
     another command to make the current attribute equal to the default
     attribute. However, this command is not a part of the basic Avatar
     command set and therefore cannot be used before the AVINIT packets are
     exchanged.

     Whatever characters are sent to the screen, they should be displayed
     using the CURRENT attribute. There is an exception to this, but only
     after the AVINIT packets have been exchanged.

     The attribute byte is an eight-bit value. As basic Avatar can only
     transfer 7-bit commands, the high bit of the attribute byte can be set
     only by the <^V> <^B> command. The <attr> byte of the <^V> <^A> <attr>
     command should be AND-ed with 7F (hexadecimal). The colors set by the
     attribute byte are the same as are the colors of the text mode of an
     IMB color graphics adapter.

     That means the bits of the attribute byte have the following meaning:

          bit:         7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
                       -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -

                       |

                     blink

     If the blink bit is set, the text is blinking, else it is not
     blinking.

     The bits of background color can have values 0 - 7, the bits of the
     text color can have values 0 - 15. The value indicates the following
     colors:

                      0      black

     Colors 8 - 15 are the same as 0 - 7 but with high intensity.

     Please note that these values are different from the numbers used by
     ANSI escape codes.

                          The Function Key Codes

     An Avatar capable BBS can accept function keys from the remote caller.
     This feature is optional (for the term program) but highly
     recommended.

     On an IBM (compatible) computer this means that if a caller hits a
     function key (e.g., left arrow, page up, F7, insert, alt-H, etc.), the
     term program should send two bytes to the Avatar capable BBS: A binary
     zero followed by the keyboard scancode. Please note that control keys
     (^A, ^B, etc.) are not function keys but have an ASCII value which is
     the only byte that should be transfered.

     There are two keys on the IBM keyboard that do have an ASCII value but
     also offer a separate scan code. These are the gray-plus and the gray-
     minus. If one of these keys is hit, treat it as a function key - send
     the binary zero followed by the scan code. This way if the BBS treats
     them differently from a regular plus and minus keys, the caller can
     take advantage of the keys.  On the other hand, BBS writers who do not
     want to assign the gray keys a special value, should watch for their
     codes and treat them as a regular plus and minus.

     Systems that use a different keyboard layout (and scan codes) than IBM
     can emulate IBM by declaring which keys are considered the arrows, f-
     keys, etc.  If you have the arrow keys, for example, but their scan
     codes are different, still send the binary zero and the scan code that
     an IBM keyboard would assign to that particular key. This should be
     transparent to the user.

     There is an obvious problem here. All terminal programs I have seen
     use function keys internally. A switch is needed so the user can
     decide whether a function key is meant for the internal use of the
     term program or it should be transfered to the BBS. Most but not all
     IBM clones have a scroll lock key, some even have an LED indicator on

     means by hitting a function key.  Since some compatibles do not have a
     scroll lock key (e.g. Tandy 1000), the Avatar capable BBS should never
     expect the <shift> <F1> combination to be transfered. That way the
     term program can use <shift> <F1> to switch between the local and
     remote use of function keys if the scroll lock key is not available.

                                   Conclusion

     This should about summarize the basic Avatar commands. I have written
     this document one day before leaving for Fidocon '88 realizing it
     would be nice to give the software developers (both of BBS's and term
     programs) something before releasing the specs of the full Avatar
     implementation.

     Here is also some sample C code. It assumes you have some low level
     communications functions of your own. For the screen output it uses
     Turbo C library, but you can use anything you want. */

     * Reno v. ACLU Update: Government's Brief Asserts Unprecedented
       Powers to criminalize Online Speech

        After reviewing the Justice Department's brief on the
     Communications Decency Act filed late yesterday with the U.S. Supreme
     Court, the ACLU said that the government is seeking unprecedented
     powers to criminalize speech on the Internet.

        The ACLU said that the government's 55-page brief in Reno v. ACLU
     is "at odds with the extensive factual findings of the trial court,"
     which ruled last June that censorship provisions of the CDA
     unconstitutionally restricted free speech.

        "The government's arguments, if adopted, would justify blanket
     censorship not just on the Internet, but in traditional forums such as
     libraries and bookstores," said Christopher Hansen, an ACLU national
     staff attorney on the Reno v. ACLU legal team.

     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 25                  27 Jan 1997


        Further, he noted that the government's brief makes the astounding
     claim that it is protecting the First Amendment by censoring free
     speech on the Internet, asserting that a fear of encountering
     "indecency" online could deter potential users from exercising their
     First Amendment interest in accessing the new medium.

        "It is supremely ironic that the government now says it is
     protecting the First Amendment rights of Americans by threatening
     people with jail for engaging in constitutionally protected speech,"
     Hansen said.

        The kind of "indecency" identified by government witnesses in the
     lower court included words and images displayed online by
     organizations such as the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Stop Prisoner
     Rape, Human Rights Watch and Critical Path AIDS Project, all
     plaintiffs in Reno v. ACLU, Hansen  said.

        The Supreme Court announced today that it would hear oral argument
     in the case on Wednesday,  March 19, at 10:00 a.m.   Each side will be
     given a half-hour to present their arguments.  According to the
     briefing schedule set by the Court, plaintiff's answering briefs are
     due on February 20. The government's final, or reply brief, is due on
     March 7.

        In addition to the government's brief, three sets of plaintiff
     groups filed friend-of-the-court briefs on Tuesday in support of the
     government's position: Enough is Enough (along with eight other
     plaintiffs), Morality in Media, and a group of members of Congress led
     by former Senator J. James Exon (D-Neb.), who sponsored the
     Communications Decency Act.

        Complete information on the ACLU's challenge to the CDA, including
     a chronology, trial briefs, affidavits, courtroom transcripts, and a
     backgrounder on Supreme Court procedures in the case, are available
     online at the ACLU's website (http://www.aclu.org) and America Online
     site (keyword: ACLU).

     * ACLU Files Suit against New York State Internet Censorship Law

        The American Civil Liberties Union, the New York Civil Liberties
     Union, the American Library Association and others last week  filed a
     lawsuit seeking an injunction against a New York statute criminalizing
     free speech in cyberspace.

         At an interactive news conference, the groups said they were
     filing suit because the law, aimed at shielding minors from
     "indecency," is an unconstitutional content-based restriction on free
     speech that would reduce adult communications to levels acceptable for
     a six-year-old.

         The ACLU said that the New York law is similar to the federal
     Communications Decency Act, which the ACLU, the ALA and others
     successfully challenged in federal district court in Philadelphia
     after it became law last February. In addition, a separate three-judge
     panel in New York found the CDA unconstitutional on First Amendment
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 26                  27 Jan 1997


     grounds. The Philadelphia case, Reno v. ACLU, is currently under
     review by the Supreme Court, and the New York case is pending in the
     Supreme Court.

         Section 235.21(3) of the New York Penal Law, which became
     effective on November 1, 1996, makes it a crime to disseminate
     "indecent" materials that are "harmful to minors" through any computer
     communications network.

      "Like the federal CDA, the New York law is technically and
     economically infeasible to enforce, it blocks speech that has value to
     a great many people, and it ignores effective alternatives available
     both to protect children and to protect free speech," said Ann Beeson,
     an ACLU national staff attorney and member of the Reno v. ACLU
     litigation team. The ACLU is also lead counsel in ALA v. Pataki.

           "Anyone who thinks children will be protected by this law is
     sadly mistaken," Beeson said. "Experts estimate that at least 40 per
     cent of information on the Internet originates from non-U.S. sites,
     which minors will still be able to access. The only group this law
     really protects is politicians, who can claim they are passing 'tough'
     legislation.  Everyone else is out in the cold."

         Today's lawsuit is the second such challenge to a state
     cybercensorship law, according to the ACLU. The first was filed by the
     ACLU and others in September against a statute in Georgia, now
     scheduled to go to trial in late January. The ACLU said it has been
     monitoring state regulation of the Internet and that currently, over
     20 states have considered such laws.

        Plaintiffs in the case are the American Library Association, the
     Freedom to Read Foundation, the New York Library Association, the
     American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, Westchester
     Library System, BiblioBytes, Association of American Publishers,
     Interactive Digital Software Association, Magazine Publishers of
     America, Public Access Networks Corp. (PANIX), ECHO, NYC Net, Art on
     the Net, Peacefire and the American Civil Liberties Union.

         Additional materials on the New York lawsuit, including the
     complaint, plaintiff statements, and a RealAudio recording of the news
     conference can be found at http://www.aclu.org/news/nycdahome/html

     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * Georgia Internet Case Update

        An evidentiary hearing is scheduled for January 30 in  ACLU v.
     Miller, the ACLU challenge to a Georgia Internet law. The Georgia law
     makes it a crime to use a name that "falsely identifies" a speaker on
     the Internet, without distinguishing whether the person communicating
     had any intent to deceive or defraud or simply wanted to keep his or
     her identity unknown.

        The complaint also states that the law may prohibit web links by
     making it a crime to publish information "using" trade names, logos or
     other symbols, again without regard to the nature of the use, and
     without any definition of what constitutes "use" on a computer
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 27                  27 Jan 1997


     network.

        At the January 30 hearing an expert witness for the ACLU is
     scheduled to demonstrate the Internet to the court.

     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     * Northwestern University Defends Free Speech on the Internet

        The ACLU congratulates Northwestern University for its stance in
     support of free speech. Recently, controversy arose around the web
     page of Associate Professor Arthur R. Butz, who had posted Holocaust
     revisionist opinions to his page on the university's servers. Despite
     numerous complaints, the University declined to ask the professor to
     remove the web page, and when pushed on the topic referred to campus
     policy on intellectual freedom as it relates to computer usage:

        Intellectual Freedom: The network is a free and open forum for the
     expression of ideas, including viewpoints that are strange,
     unorthodox, or unpopular. The network administrators place no official
     sanctions upon the expression of personal opinion on the network.
     However, such opinions may not be represented as views of Northwestern
     University.

     As the University stated, Professor Butz made it clear that he was
     presenting his own views and in no way representing the views of the
     University, and any censorship was therefore inappropriate. The ACLU
     supports such free speech codes for university computers.

     'GEEKONICS' IS JUST A BEGINNING
     by John Woestendiek
     Philadelphia Inquirer
     Wed., January 8, 1997
     *****************************

     NEWS BULLETIN: Saying it will improve the education of children who
     have grown up immersed in computer lingo, the school board in San
     Jose, Calif., has officially designated computer English, or
     "Geekonics", as a second language.

     The historic vote on Geekonics - a combination of the word "geek" and
     the word "phonics" - came just weeks after the Oakland school board
     recognized black English, or Ebonics, as a distinct language.

     "This entirely reconfigures our parameters," Milton "Floppy"
     Macintosh, chairman of Geekonics Unlimited, said after the school
     board became the first in the nation to recognize Geekonics.

     "No longer are we preformatted for failure," Macintosh said during a
     celebration that saw many Geekonics backers come dangerously close to
     smiling. "Today, we are rebooting, implementing a program to process
     the data we need to interface with all units of humanity."

     Controversial and widely misunderstood, the Geekonics movement was
     spawned in California's Silicon Valley, where many children have grown
     up in households headed by computer technicians, programmers,
     engineers and scientists who have lost ability to speak plain English
     and have inadvertently passed on their high-tech vernacular to their
     children.

     HELPING THE TRANSITION

     While schools will not teach the language, increased teacher awareness
     of Geekonics, proponents say, will help children make the transition
     to standard English. Those students, in turn, could possibly help
     their parents learn to speak in a manner that would lead listeners to
     believe that they have actual blood coursing through their veins.

     "Bit by bit, byte by byte, with the proper system development, with
     nonpreemptive multitasking, I see no reason why we can't download the
     FIDONEWS 14-04               Page 30                  27 Jan 1997


     data we need to modulate our oral output," Macintosh said.

     The designation of Ebonics and Geekonics as languages reflects a
     growing awareness of our nation's lingual diversity, experts say.

     Other groups pushing for their own languages and/or vernaculars to be
     declared official viewed the Geekonics vote as a step in the right
     direction.

     "This is just, like, OK, you know, the most totally kewl thing, like,
     ever," said Jennifer Notat-Albright, chairwoman of the Committee for
     the Advancement of Valleyonics, headquartered in Southern California.
     "I mean, like, you know?" she added.

     THEY'RE HAPPY IN DIXIE

     "Yeee-hah," said Buford "Kudzu" Davis, president of the Dixionics
     Coalition.  "Y'all gotta know I'm as happy as a tick on a sleeping
     bloodhound about this."

     Spokesmen for several subchapters of Dixionics - including Alabonics,
     Tennesonics and Louisionics - also said they approved of the decision.

     Bill Flack, public information officer for the Blue Ribbon Task Force
     on Bureaucratonics said that his organization would not comment on the
     San Jose vote until it convened a summit meeting, studied the impact,
     assessed the feasibility, finalized a report and drafted a
     comprehensive action plan, which, once it clears the appropriate
     subcommittees and is voted on, will be made public to those who submit
     the proper information-request forms.

     Proponents of Ebonics heartily endorsed the designation of Geekonics
     as an official language.

     "I ain't got no problem wif it," said Earl E. Byrd, president of the
     Ebonics Institute. "You ever try talkin' wif wunna dem computer dudes?
     Don't matter if it be a white computer dude or a black computer dude;
     it's like you be talkin' to a robot - RAM, DOS, undelete, MegaHertZ.
     Ain't nobody understands. But dey keep talkin' anyway. 'Sup wif dat?"

     Those involved in the lingual diversity movement believe that only by
     enacting many different English languages, in addition to all the
     foreign ones practiced here, can we all end up happily speaking the
     same boring one, becoming a nation that is both unified in its
     diversity, and diversified in its unity.

     Others say that makes no sense at all. In any language.

     Wanted: old electronics parts.

     I'm looking for control panels from old 2" video tape mastering
     equipment. They don't have to be working as long as they are intact
     externally with knobs and VUs in place. These panels are about 3.5
     feet long and six inches top to bottom.

     I'm also looking for old Commodore 64 keyboards. They don't need to
     be operational either.

     I would prefer them to be free but reasonable costs are acceptable.

     If you have or know where such items may be obtained, please send
     Netmail to the address above or email to me at:

       cbaker84@digital.net

     with details.

     Thanks.

     [From the Ringmaster:]

     Date: Sun, 26 Jan 1997 03:02:09 -0800
     From: Sage Weil <sage@newdream.net>
     Organization: New Dream Network
     To: ringmasters-all-l@webring.org
     Subject: Webring Server Status
     Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
     Sender: owner-ringmasters-all-l@webring.org

     Hello,

     For those of you who don't think you should be receiving this message,
     please ignore it.

     As I'm sure you already know, the Webring server is still offline.
     While we were expecting to move the machine to another location last
     week, the plans fell through due to power problems at the phone
     company that won't be fixed until late next week.  The move will
     probably take place the following Monday or Tuesday.

     Unfortunately, while the system is still connected at the old
     location, it crashed last Friday and we haven't been able to get into
     the building to restart it; we're still trying to get ahold of the guy
     with the keys.  I *hope* that we can reach him on Monday or Tuesday,
     but I can't promise anything.

     In any case, don't worry.  The Webring is not going anywhere.. at the
     absolute worst, I will be back online in two weeks when the new server
     arrives.  Most likely, it will be back online next week sometime.
     When the move does take place, it will be offline for anywhere from a
     few hours to a day or two depending on how fast the DNS changes
     propogate to your service provider.  (A number of you have also
     wondering if the address will change.. while the physical location
     will be different, the URL will still be www.webring.org.)

     Thanks for your patience--
     sage

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     [This is last week's edition from 1403.] Ed.

     The backlog is actually getting winnowed down to something
     manageable. I guess I'm actually starting to get caught up... ;-)

     I added my first Atari entry this week and have a couple of others
     pending. I also finally got enough info about GoldED to get it added.

     Given that my "todo" queue is almost empty, I'm going to encourage
     everyone to check to make sure every package they use is listed and
     for each package that isn't listed, netmail me with the names of the
     package and contact info for the author or a support site. I actually
     got caught up enough to twiddle my thumbs, so I think I can handle
     a few extra suggestions... ;-)

     Also, since I've fallen way behind my original estimates for phasing
     out the old info section, I've reformatted it a little to reduce the
     space it takes.

     Phased out this week: SuperComm 0.99 and TAG 2.5g

     Phase-out highlights:
       This week: Telegard 2.7 and TPBoard 6.1
             Deadline for info: 31 Jan 1997.
       Last week: TBBS 2.1 and TComm/TCommNet 3.4
             Deadline for info: 24 Jan 1997.
