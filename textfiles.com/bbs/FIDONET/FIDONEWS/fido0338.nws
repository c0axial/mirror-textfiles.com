                       Echomail Coordinators

         As you may have heard, several of us met in Chicago to
     discuss ways to improve Echomail topology, decrease the amount of
     time to move Echomail around the country, and to lay some ground
     rules for Echo Conferences. Now we need your help. In order for
     the Echomail Regional Coordinators to provide the needed help, we
     need to know which nodes carry certain conferences.

          Would all of you carrying ANY Echomail conferences please
     send a list of the Conferences that you carry to your Echomail
     Regional Coordinator. Please name the file NET-NODE.ECH, as in
     161-4.ECH. This will help us assist new boards in finding a
     logical link up point to all the Conferences out there.

          The following are the current Echo Reg. Coordinators:

          Region 10 - Butch Walker     161/1 or 161/4:XP
          Region 11 - Mike Bader       120/17:XP
          Region 12 - None Yet
          Region 13 - Gee Wong         107/312:XP
          Region 14 - Alex Hartley     100/500:XP
          Region 15 - David Dodell     114/15:XP
          Region 16 - Bob Hartman      132/101:XP
          Region 17 - Randy Bush       122/6:XP

          Also, thanks again to Thom Henderson, Gee Wong, Bob Hartman,
     Don Walker, Mike Bader, Phil Ardussi, and Jon Sabol for going to
     the trouble and expense of flying into Chicago for a one day
     meeting. I have published one brief report on the proceedings, the
     minutes are in the works, and when they are done we will be
     releasing a comprehensive report of what went on. Film at 11:00.

     A couple of weeks ago I just ran into a problem with
     my own FIDO. It was a user who couldn't figure out
     that he had to press RETURN or SPACE a couple of times
     to make FIDO start. So I decided to write this GREAT
     utility. The first thing I did was to call my friend
     Peter Stewart and tell him about this thing we're gonna
     write. He said "No problem, sounds like a piece of cake".

     Done, we started writing this utility last Saturday. And
     now it's ready...what is ready?! FrontDoor v1.0. This is
     a program that you put before FIDO to make FIDO start all
     by itself without any stupid RETURNS or SPACES. What it
     actually does is that it will sit and wait until one of
     two things happens: 1) An event is detected within the
     next 10 minutes. 2) A incoming call at XXXX baud rate is
     detected. If an event is scheduled, FD will exit w/ an
     errorlevel (trapable in a .BAT file) so FIDO will just
     load and wait until the event time comes.  If on the other
     hand a incoming call is detected, FD will exit w/ an
     errorlevel depending on the baud rate, telling the user
     that he's connected and the go and get FIDO!

     The program requires a TRULY Hayes compatible modem such
     as the Miracle Tech WS3000 (w/ our modified EPROM in it!)
     and we do not intend to support any other standard.

     It's really a great thing because the screen has got three
     windows in FD. One for all the "program messages" such as
     "Scheduled event in 10 minutes, getting FIDO...", one for
     the modem's response such as "OK" and other stupid messages
     that the modem might send. And finally one for the "action"
     that's happening. It's failsafe even w/ multitasking
     programs. The sysop has got two options, COM1 and COM2.
     Future versions may also support COM3. So all you sysops out
     there: Give me a mail, and I'll send it to ya! So far, it is
     only available from the Swedish Net (501), but I'll start
     uploading it to the US net to...the program was written by
     Peter Stewart (thanks Peter) and me (Happy Birthday to me on
     the 25th of Sep!).

     From:  Mark J. Welch, Fido 161/459 [WelchNet, Berkeley, CA]


                    Curbing Shareware Vendor Abuses


       [I've tracked down a bit more information about letters
       being sent by PC-SIG to other vendors, as well as
       additional information, and I am somewhat (!) upset at the
       firm. For background, see FidoNews #336, 22 Sept 1986, p.
       8-9.]


     Shareware authors may recall that in its early days, PC-SIG
     didn't take much care in compiling its library of public-
     domain and Shareware titles. For a while, it seemed as if
     they'd cleaned up their act, but I'm beginning to believe
     that they are now taking many actions that are having very
     serious adverse effects on Shareware authors.

     The first action brought to my attention was the letter sent
     out by PC-SIG to vendors whom it believed were improperly
     using its name and disk numbering scheme. Yes, folks, PC-SIG,
     after selling its printed directory through bookstores and
     allowing other vendors and user groups to use its numbering
     scheme for several years, now says it will sue anyone who
     uses the same numbering scheme or, apparently, mentions their
     name in any way (other than in a disclaimer).

     I have no problem with PC-SIG's interest in protecting its
     name. (PC-SIG stands for PC Software Interest Group, but
     unlike other SIGs in the computer world, PC-SIG is not a user
     group: it is a private, for-profit company whose only
     business is duplicating and selling public domain and
     shareware programs.) However, their method of doing so is at
     best misleading, and at worst deliberately calculated to
     damage the rights of shareware authors.

     In a nine-page threatening letter sent by PC-SIG to several
     vendors, PC-SIG's attorney (Thomas Caudill, 408-298-4844)
     makes a number of statements that by themselves threaten
     shareware authors' copyright and trademark rights:

     I.   Three times in the letter, Caudill claims that all of
          the programs in the PC-SIG library are in the public
          domain. Nowhere in the letter is there any
          acknowledgement that most of the programs' authors
          retain copyright ownership. This sort of claim, if
          repeated, has the effect of diluting Shareware authors'
          rights.

     II.  Three times in the letter, PC-SIG claims copyright
          ownership of all the disk in the library. In the context
          of the letter, the claim seems to be that PC-SIG owns
          all rights to these disks and programs, or simply that
          PC-SIG owns the copyright to each program in the
     Fidonews                     Page 7                    6 Oct 1986


          library, including mine. However, I presume that they
          are simply claiming that they can copyright the
          arrangment of multiple programs combined on a disk
          (i.e., a "printer utility" disk). The overbroad claim in
          the letter, however, seems to order the recipient to
          stop distributing the programs, not just the programs in
          the same order PC-SIG puts them.

     III. PC-SIG also claims, in the letter, that the recipient
          cannot use the same disk names and titles as PC-SIG, as
          the disk names are copyrights (trademarks?) of PC-SIG.
          This claim is absurd: I own the trademark right to the
          names "GAGS" and "Generic Adventure Game System." I
          believe other shareware authors own their programs'
          titles as well.

     IV.  The letter also implies that the program authors somehow
          work for or with PC-SIG; this is unnerving not just
          because I allow many vendors, user groups and BBSs to
          distribute GAGS, but because it implies an affiliation
          that may lead buyers to assume that PC-SIG has paid the
          authors for the programs somehow, thus reducing the
          likelihood of anyone ever sending me money. (I've
          received many registrations, including some from people
          who bought GAGS from other vendors: no one has ever
          registered after buying GAGS from PC-SIG.)

     V.   In the letter, PC-SIG also claims that it can collect
          the damages provided in the US Copyright Act, which
          implies that they have registered the disks. If so, they
          would be in big trouble, since I have not given them
          permission to register GAGS as a "derivative work." I
          was assured by PC-SIG owner Richard Peterson that the
          firm has not, in fact, registered the disks. (Of course,
          that means that the list of damages is simply a bluff
          that cannot be asked for.)

     VI.  The letter also says that it has filed legal actions
          against other Shareware vendors and that it has obtained
          injunctions against others. (One vendor, National Public
          Domain Software, has sent its own letter out, telling
          its customers that PC-SIG drove it out of business with
          a lawsuit.)


     Now, as I noted above, I can't object to PC-SIG's legitimate
     interest in protecting its name and its directory. However,
     when I read the letter and talked to other Shareware vendors,
     it wasn't clear whether the goal was to protect its rights or
     to drive its competitors out of business. It is using the
     money it has made selling MY SOFTWARE to drive other vendors
     out of business, thus limiting the overall potential of this
     distribution channel. These other vendors, in many cases, are
     individuals who can't afford to hire a lawyer.

     The most offensive fact is that PC-SIG's letter simply
     Fidonews                     Page 8                    6 Oct 1986


     tramples on my legal rights. One vendor, who had obtained my
     permission to distribute GAGS, pulled it (and other programs)
     from his library after receiving PC-SIG's overbroad letter.
     It's back in the library, but both that vendor and I lost
     sales as a result of PC-SIG's aggression. If other vendors
     pull my disk or go out of business because of PC-SIG's
     letter, I lose money so that PC-SIG can have a bigger share
     of a smaller marketplace.


     Of course, if this one letter were the only problem with PC-
     SIG, I'd not be so worked up. But GAGS originally made its
     way into the PC-SIG library before I gave permission. I found
     that it was in the library, and decided to give PC-SIG
     permission to distribute the program despite its discourtesy
     (and the fact that its earlier distribution was illegal). I
     gave them permission, and notified them of each update. They
     never sent me anything. PC-SIG completely ignored my update
     notices, instead insisting four months later that I had to
     mail them the update free in order to get the new versions
     into the library. (What a great idea: their cost of goods is
     ZERO. They buy disks for 39 cents and sell them for $6 each,
     with no costs in between.)

     Other authors' programs have found their way into the PC-SIG
     library without permission, and in at least one case was sold
     despite a clear disclaimer in the program stating that for-
     profit vendors like PC-SIG could not distribute it. (This
     latter incident speaks well for PC-SIG's claim that it
     screens every program carefully.)

     And just a few days ago, I discovered that PC-SIG has begun
     selling a CD-ROM version of its library, and included GAGS on
     that disk in direct violation of the permission letter I gave
     them. Again, it never occurred to them to even write me a
     letter asking for a change to my permission letter. To this
     date, I have never received *anything* by mail from PC-SIG,
     not even a catalog.

     Yesterday, at the PC-Faire in San Francisco, I picked up
     their catalog update/newsletter at their huge booth. In the
     catalog comes yet another slap in the face. I expect
     companies like PC-SIG to make a good-faith effort to
     encourage buyers to pay for their disks. Instead, the firm's
     newsletter seems to suggest that Shareware authors make
     megabucks. Direct quote:

        "Q: Do the authors who ask for a donation or contribution
        really make money?  A: The high end of scale for people
        using the Open Software concept to distribute their
        software is $1.5 million to $2.5 million a year. My
        estimate is that the average developer earns about $40,000
        to $50,000 a year per program. Others make less than $500
        a year."

     [I must disagree, Mr. Peterson: the average Shareware author

     probably sits a lot closer to your $500 figure, and if the
     average author makes $40,000 I'll eat a floppy disk.] The
     effect of such a quote is to make buyers think there's no
     need to pay Shareware authors, since they already do so well.

     The only folks I know who have large grosses are folks like
     Bob Wallace and Jim Button, who also do hard marketing. It
     looks to me as if most of the money being made in Shareware
     is going into PC-SIG's bank account. By itself, that's not
     too upsetting: I decided to distribute GAGS as Shareware,
     knowing that vendors like PC-SIG may make more money than I.
     But I never expected any company to start firing a gun at the
     authors who are necessary to its very existence.

     Another recent discovery for me is that PC-SIG is in the complete
     distribution business now. Not only do they sell disks by mail order
     and at trade shows, but they have "authorized dealers" in the US and
     even overseas.


     I don't know what the result of all of this ought to be. I've
     sent a nasty letter to PC-SIG, asking that a retraction of
     its letter be sent to everyone who received it, and demanding
     that GAGS be removed from the illegal CD-ROM version of the
     PC-SIG library. I am still awaiting their reply.


     >>>>   I'd like to hear from other shareware authors about
            their experiences with companies selling public-domain
            and shareware programs for profit. I'd also like to
            hear from other vendors, and user groups, about their
            feelings about this issue. I'll summarize the response
            in a future issue of FidoNews.

                 Seagate disk parts revisited...

     Several weeks ago I wrote a somewhat negative piece for these
     august pages regarding Seagate, small parts for Seagate drives
     and a generally irritated editorial comment about what I think
     of folks who maintain a monopolistic attitude.

     For what it is worth, I never heard from Seagate. Apparently
     nobody at Seagate reads FidoNews.

     But now I know of at least TWO people who read FidoNews. Bob
     Hartmann does (I am sure nobody is surprised).

     So does Brian Walsh, of Logical Technologies in Columbia, MD
     (Fido node 109/640).

     After the article appeared I heard from Brian, who is among
     other things a Seagate distributor. Brian shipped me the parts
     I needed via Federal Express, and refused to bill me even for
     the express charges.

     When I talked to him about the cost, he said that with normal
     discounts the parts (two terminating resistor packs) cost less
     than a dollar and the cost of paperwork to invoice that amount
     was more than the amount was worth.

     I have changed my mind about Seagate; not about dealing with
     them (I STILL won't deal with them directly), but about the
     continued use of their products. I'll buy Seagate again one
     day. From Brian Walsh, at Logical Technologies. Even if Father
     Seagate does not care, Brian Walsh does.

     Kilgore Trout, 107/7
     FidoNet Study Group

                                 A Proposal
                                  for the
                              Funding of IFNA



     This is a proposal for one method of providing basic  funding  to
     the International FidoNet Association (IFNA).  It is assumed that
     the  reader  already  feels  that  providing  funds for IFNA is a
     worthwhile objective.

     In short, this proposal outlines a method whereby IFNA can obtain
     funds by charging dues to its members in  a  fair  and  equitable
     manner.

     Membership  in  IFNA  is determined primarily by ones presence in
     the node list.  Therefore,  I propose that each node be charged a
     small,  fixed  amount for every week that it is in the node list.
     I would suggest a fixed fee of  one  dollar  per  week.  At  this
     level  I  would  estimate that approximately half of the existing
     nodes would drop out, leaving IFNA with total revenues of $25,000
     per year.  With luck,  we would be back  to  our  present  1,000+
     nodes by the middle of 1987, giving revenues of $50,000 per year.

     The  mechanism  to accomplish this can be largely automated.  The
     current MAKENL system would need to be enhanced to make use of an
     accounting database.  The database would contain a credit balance
     for every node,  and MAKENL would deduct the weekly fee from  the
     account  for each node for every week that it is in the node list
     and neither down nor on hold.  If the balance for  a  given  node
     goes  negative,  then  MAKENL  could  remove  that  node from the
     generated node list.  Human  intervention  would  be  reduced  to
     entering credits as dues are recieved,  and entering changes when
     someone changes their node number.



     Bells and Whistles:

     We will need some mechanism to notify sysops when their credit is
     running low.  Either MAKENL or, more probably, a separate utility
     could generate messages with canned text to  remind  sysops  when
     they have 15,  10,  5,  2, 1, and 0 weeks left.  We assume here a
     one week "grace period",  where a sysop is still "in" if he has a
     zero  balance,  and  doesn't  get  dropped until his balance goes
     negative.  This might, in fact, be left as a program parameter to
     allow the grace period to be varied.

     Hosts and hubs are generally (always?)  duplicate  entries.  They
     are  also  involved,  active sysops.  At the very least a host or
     hub should not be required to pay for the alternate node  number.
     We  may  also  wish to make his primary node number free as well.
     This  could  be  accomplished  (albeit  at  some  difficulty)  by
     Fidonews                     Page 12                   6 Oct 1986


     comparing phone numbers.

     We  would  not want to start out by hitting everyone at once.  It
     is  also  to  our  advantage  to  spread  out  people's   payment
     schedules.  This  can  be accomplished by giving each node now in
     the system a credit,  randomly chosen between,  say,  20  and  50
     weeks worth.

     While we should have a minimum, it should be very low.  Given the
     example of charging $1/week, we could set the minimum at $5, thus
     allowing  a  new  sysop  to join for a relatively brief period to
     check things out.  We might also  offer  a  discount  for  longer
     signups  (such as $50 per year,  saving $2) in order to encourage
     sysops to sign up for longer periods.



     Objections:

     We long ago stated that we would  continue  to  provide  existing
     services  for free,  and only charge for new services which would
     be optional.  Hence, this proposal,  if pushed by IFNA,  would be
     rightly  seen  as a breach of promise.  Attempting to establish a
     system such as this by fiat  would  be  unethical,  immoral,  and
     (more to the point) would not work.

     The  systems  which choose to drop out rather than pay dues might
     form their own network.  I would imagine  that  the  majority  of
     such  systems would be those which are not actively involved with
     or interested in network mail,  so I regard this  possibility  as
     slight.  Still,  since  it  would  most  probably  result  in the
     destruction of FidoNet, it is one which we must consider.

     Many sysops,  while perhaps not actively objecting,  will fail to
     pay  their dues in time,  and be dropped from the list.  A few of
     these will then pay their dues,  but most  will  not.  This  will
     include sysops who actually agree with our objectives.

     This  will  cause  a  definite  and  drastic  drop in the size of
     FidoNet.  System growth will also be slowed.  If the reaction  is
     bad enough,  we may actually start to loose systems over the long
     haul.  FidoNet may end up condemned to a slow, wasting death.

     One way or another,  a great many people will raise  bloody  hell
     about it.

                                DBASE BASICS
                                     or
                          BEHIND THE BLINKING DOT


     The first question  the  curious  ask  about  Dbase  II  is  "Why
     bother?"  And first acquaintances may be put off by the program's
     silence:  Instead of an inviting menus of choices there  is  only
     the  eternally  blinking  dot.   In  what  will  probably  be  an
     irregular series in our newsletter,  I'll try to take you "behind
     the  Dbase  dot"  to  show some of the power of Dbase II and drop
     some hints that may make it easier to use.

     The blinking dot is really a kind  of  question  mark.  Dbase  is
     waiting  for  you to type in a command telling it what to do (the
     first four letters will do--that's Hint #1).  That means you have
     immediate access an astounding amount of power.  Dbase  lets  you
     use  the  information  in  your files in ways Perfect Filer never
     dreamed  of--but  you  do  have  to  know  what   to   ask   for.
     Fortunately,  the commands are words you'd expect:  LIST, DELETE,
     APPEND, LOCATE, FIND, etc.  The manual is hardly a great one, but
     its tutorials are a decent introduction to these basic commands.

     The  most-asked  question  is  "How can I get the files I already
     have into Dbase II?" It's simple.  Take your Christmas card  list
     as an example;  each entry has a First Name,  Last Name,  Street,
     City, State,  and Zip.  The entire entry is called a RECORD,  and
     each item is called a FIELD.  The first step is to CREATE a Dbase
     file   with   specifications   something   like   this--call   it
     XMASLIST.DBF:

              Field name  Field Type  Field width
              -----------------------------------
              FIRSTNAME - CHARACTERS  10 spaces
              LASTNAME  - CHARACTERS  10 spaces
              STREET    - CHARACTERS  15 spaces
              CITY      - CHARACTERS  10 spaces
              STATE     - CHARACTERS   2 spaces
              ZIP       - CHARACTERS   5 spaces

     To get your list into Dbase II,  you need to make an  ASCII  text
     file of your data.  Let's call it MYFILE.TXT.  The "ASCII" simply
     means  "letters  & numbers only" --no control codes.  Another way
     of saying this is to make a list of  your  data  that  your  word
     processor can read (in the NON-DOCUMENT MODE for Wordstar users).

     Dbase II accepts text data in two forms:

     1) In the first form,  the spacing  is  critical.  To  match  the
        Dbase file above, you'd want a document that looked like this:

              Santa     Claus     Icy Way
     Fidonews                     Page 14                   6 Oct 1986


              Sally     Doe       101 2nd Ave.    --->

              12345678901234567890123456789012345

              Toytown   NP01225
              New York  NY10101

              12345678901212345

        (the  numbers  are  for reference only--don't put them in your
        file.)

        Notice that each piece of  information  occupies  exactly  the
        number  of  spaces  specified  in the database,  and there's a
        Carriage Return at  the  end  of  each  record.  Your  present
        database  can  probably  create  a document like this with its
        Report or List function.

     2) In the second method,  spacing is  unimportant,  although  the
        data items can't be longer than specified in the Dbase file or
        they'll  be  chopped  off.  This time the data would look like
        this:

              Santa,Claus,Icy Way,Toytown,NP,01225,
              Sally,Doe,101 2nd Ave,New York,NY,10101,

        Now each piece of information is separated from the next by  a
        comma.  And there's another comma as well as a Carriage Return
        at the end of each line or record.  This form might be easy to
        produce with a word processor.

     To get the data from these forms into the Dbase File,  get to the
     infamous dot prompt.  (I'll let you fill in the appropriate A: or
     B:  depending  on  your  system in these examples.) At the prompt
     enter "USE XMASLIST" which makes  that  file  active.  Then,  for
     form  1,  say  "APPEND  FROM MYFILE.TXT SDF".  SDF means Standard
     Data Format.  For form 2, say "APPEND FROM MYFILE.TXT DELIMITED"-
     -DELIMITED tells Dbase to look  for  comas  between  each  field.
     Dbase II will read your text file and fill the database with your
     information.

     The next question is "Now What?!" The real power of Dbase lies in
     the fact that you can write a sequence of the commands in a file-
     -which  makes  it a programming language.  That's how Dbase II is
     used  for  so  many  business  applications,  custom-tailored  to
     specific  needs.  In  my  own  work,  a  Dbase  program  of these
     commands keeps track of business  contacts,  writes  my  letters,
     keeps track of my appointments, and even dials my phone.

          I am making a request from all authors of Fido clones, support
     programs, and utility programs associated with the running of Fido.

          I am setting up my system to be the "first??" all Fido support
     system in the net. I will be adding files related to the operation of
     or configuration of Fido in all available formats (ie DEC, SANYO,
     etc) and am attempting to set up a file area for utilities, another
     for Fido software, yet another for modem help including made to order
     "fidomdm.bbs" files and last but not least messagebases for use as a
     central information point for suggestions, ideas or what-have-you
     concerning our illustrious dog.

     I have also acquired ALL back issues of FidoNews and have these
     available for d/l along with as many Fido related files as I could
     possibly locate. I have been robbing systems from coast to coast
     amassing these files and would like to invite you to call, look
     around, take what you want and Upload anything you have that I don't
     !
          I am doing this without any consultation with national (although
     I don't think they will mind too awfully much (please Ken, can I ,
     huh, can I PlEEEEEEEASEEEEEE). I would like to try to set up a system
     that anyone can call and find what they need for operating Fido. This
     would end a great amount of confusion as to where to locate any
     utility needed for operation of your system. I mean after all, one
     call does it all, right?

          I will keep the latest versions on-line where possible and ask
     that if you have a later version then mine, upload it. I will be
     assembling a list of the files each week and placing it in area 1
     under the name ALLFILES.ARC so that you may call and d/l it, peruse
     it, call back and get what you want.

          Authors......you got something you want distributed...LET ME
     HAVE IT ! You got an update to one of my files. LET ME HAVE IT ! You
     wanna make a suggestion for a new utility, TELL ME. Looking for ideas
     for yet another utility, LOOK HERE FIRST !

          I can't offer much in the way of physical support for INFA and
     what they stand for but I have a computer, a phone line, and the
     desire to help out. And if this will help, GREAT !

     109/610

        Does anyone out there know of a device driver or other resi-
     dent program that I can use in place of a "CTTY COM1:"?  The
     goal is to have standard output simultaneously redirected to
     both the console AND the modem, thereby making it possible for
     me to see what my users are doing while they're O)utside Fido.
        It's a simple concept, but having little knowledge of
     device drivers and even less of the internal BIOS of my IBM
     XT clone, I'm finding that capturing standard output for re-
     direction to two places at once isn't as easy as I thought.
        Please send replies/suggestions to me at 109/610.  Any help
     in this matter would be GREATLY appreciated.

     Note:  No  profit is made from the sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is applied  entirely
     to  the  cost  of  downloading  the  software over the phone
     lines,  running a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and
     inspecting,   cataloguing,  archiving  and  maintaining  the
     files. Obtaining this software yourself through the use of a
     computer with a modem using commercial  phone  access  would
     cost you much more than what we charge for the service...

     The following format choices are available:

           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
           - Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
           - DSBackup
           - Fastback
           - ACS INTRCPT 720k format (Requires a 1.2m floppy
               drive and PC-DOS 3.2)
           - Plain  ol' files (add $50)

     Add  $30  if  you want the library on 1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive  disks).   There  are  no  shipping  or   handling
     charges.  California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     The Structured Programming Language is a SHARE WARE free format
     block structured programming language that runs on MSDOS and
     PCDOS computer systems. It may be obtained by calling a bulletin
     board system at 516 334 8221. Download SPLLIB.ARC at 1200 or 300
     baud. It takes only 20 minutes to download at 1200 baud. It is
     also available from PC BLUE in New York City. If you like the
     software I strongly recommend that you REGISTER and PAY for the
     software because I would like to make an honest living just like
     you do. There is no need to be validated on the bbs to download
     files. For software support call Electronic Digital Computer
     Systems at 516 694 5872. In the near future look for the
     language on net.micro.pc conference on USENET.
