Preventing Computer Thefts

by the Peel Regional Police (forwarded by Nigel Allen 1:250/438)
Computer Thefts - Help Us Help You

[Notes from Nigel Allen:
Here is a press release from the Peel Regional Police,
an agency that serves the cities of Brampton and Mississauga
in the province of Ontario, in Canada.
I found the press release on the Canada NewsWire web site
at http://www.newswire.ca/
I do not work for the Peel Regional Police, but I thought
that the subject would be of particular interest to
the readers of FidoNews.]

  COMPUTER THEFTS - HELP US HELP YOU

            BRAMPTON, Ont., Dec. 13 /CNW/ - Peel Regional Police
are concerned by the number of burglaries into area businesses.
The property being stolen in the vast majority of break-ins
is computer equipment.
            Patrol Officers from 21 Division noted that many
businesses seem unaware that they were making themselves easy
targets. Their investigations revealed that thieves are cruising
industrial areas looking for the glow of ``screen savers'' or
computer equipment that is left unsecured and in plain view, near
windows or glass doors. In a number of offences the culprits
reached in and pulled the equipment through a broken or open window.
            Both computer equipment and the information stored in
it is obviously of great value to the victim company. Therefore
common sense demands that some precautions be taken to reduce
the risk of the equipment's theft.
            Peel Regional Police Crime Prevention Services has
several suggestions:

-  Consider the design of the premises. The longer it takes
   thieves to get out of the building with your goods, the
   better the chance of them being caught or deciding to go
   elsewhere.

-  Turn off the computer monitors at the conclusion of the work
   day.

-  Install alarms on doors and windows. It is essential there be
   no delay built into the alarm. Many thieves may be in and
   gone in the 30 or 60 second delay built into most alarm
   systems. Audible alarms (bells, sirens) and flashing strobe
   lights draw attention to the crime. It will increase the
   likelihood of the criminals being seen and may frighten them
   off empty handed.

-  Enroll in operation Provident. This is a free service of the
   Peel Regional Police. The company will be assigned a number
   which you mark on all your office equipment and computers.
   The company will also be supplied with stickers to affix to
   doors and windows giving notice to thieves that your property
   is marked and registered with police. This program will deter
   potential burglars. It makes stolen property less valuable
   to the thief and assists police to recover and return stolen
   goods. To participate call Peel Regional Police, Crime
   Prevention Services (905) 453-2121, extension 4021.

            Each company's security needs are different. Peel
Regional Police Crime Prevention Services can assist companies in
developing strategies that will deal with threats to their assets.
For further information call Constable Henri Berube, Crime
Prevention Services at (905) 453-2121, extension 4021.

   For further information: Constable Henri Berube, Crime
   Prevention Services, (905) 453-2121, extension 4021;

ATTENTION: CANADIAN LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSOPS

I am with the Ontario Provincial Police, stationed in Brantford, Ont.
I understand you may be able to assist me in in searching for other
police officers that are operating bulletin boards.

I'm involved in E-Mail for two networks:
The National Law Enforcement Message System [NLEMS]
and the PoliceNet Mail System [NLETS].

I would like to locate any Police Officers that are operating bulletin
boards for either their home or office use.   I would like to advise
the officers there are two INTERNATIONAL Police Networks dedicated
to their field.  These networks are restricted to Law Enforcement
and support personnel.

Various related topics are discussed from one Province to another and
State to State.  The network has even expanded into Europe.

Each network carries about 20 conferences that can be transferred either
in FIDO format or QWK packets depending on the hub you choose.

The traffic is light to moderate at times.   Talk to the officers that
were at the scene of the Oklahoma disaster.  Grave situations such as
this require an extra special person to conduct their jobs professionally.
Learn from others - how to become more efficient with your skills.

Know where and when specific seminars are going to take place.  Read
about the latest trials from the officers perspectives.  Know when
another brother has died and it is not published in your local papers.

SHARING-the FidoNet World Class, Global Communication Echo

Christopher Baker
Rights On!, 1:374/14
Titusville_FL_USA

There's a new Echo in town dedicated to the REAL spirit of FidoNet
Sysoping. It's called SHARING. Here's the blurb from the EListing:

What Sysops will see and learn in SHARING will make it "the
place to be." What they will see will be up to them but there
will be laughter and wonders and mysteries of FidoNet technology
will be explained. SHARE the wonderful experience of our hobby.
This Echo will be Awesome. It's the Swiss Army knife of information!
There's plenty to learn. Sysops can SHARE everything!
Every Sysop in the FidoNet phonebook [Nodelist] is invited to
participate but we will have a few simple rules. POLITENESS to each
other is EXPECTED! It is REQUIRED! The few off-topic topics are
contained in the accompanying SHARING.RUL file. The Moderators
reserve the right to declare off-topic any subject getting out of
the bounds of politeness and cooperation. The Backbone or any
backbone is off-topic automatically except as noted in the rules.

Backbone status has just been [16 Dec 95] applied for so find a local
link or contact one of the above via Netmail. SHARING also may be found
on the Region 18 backbone and ProtoStar and the Southern Star for folks
with existing links there. Bill Hausler at 1:141/991 also Hubs this
Echo about.

Here's the SHARING Echo Guidelines for those without a copy of the
current ELRUL file:

Sorry, it's dirty work but someone has to do it.  :-)

What is this echo?
------------------
FidoNet is a World Class, Global, Communications Network of, by and for
FidoNet Sysops around the Globe.  There are other FTN networks but
none are of the size of FidoNet.

What Sysops will see and learn in SHARING will make it "the place to
be".  What might they see?  We don't have an agenda, hidden or
otherwise, but I'm sure we'll laugh at ourselves, cry for each other
and everyone will be "just themselves".

The wonders and mysteries of FidoNet Technology will be explained!.
Learn how and where files fall into dishes.  Learn how and where files
pop out of the InterNet tunnel.  Learn how to eat the Echomail Elephant
rather than have it eat you! Learn how to send e-mail to anywhere on the
Globe often with a local phone call, including to AOL, Prodigy, C$erve,
and perhaps that office down the street.  Learn there's no such thing as
FREE!

SHARE the wonderful experience of our hobby.  This echo is Awesome, it's
the Swiss Army knife of information!  There's plenty to learn, learn,
learn and it doesn't matter what hardware, operating system, mailer or
BBS Software a sysop uses.

Sysops can share those funny experiences we all have.  One of mine is a
brief story about NERF.BAT.  We can laugh with each other and cry with
each other. Yes, tragedy, sometimes simple, sometimes bizarre, hits us
all.  Why not share it?  There's good news too: someone is a new parent
for the first time, a new grandparent even.

Sysops find good deals on all sorts of goods and services.  Why not
SHARE where, how much and how good so we can all get the most out of our
hobby budget?

Please!
--------
What won't you see?  No anger.  No threats.  No intimidation. No
inappropriate language.  And none of that politistrivial junk so common
in other Sysop Echos.  No Zeroes. No Binary addresses allowed.  If
you're a 0 or a 1, stay away!  No a.k.a.'s allowed!  Use your real,
primary address or stay out, especially those 0's and 1's!  Simple
enough?

Every Sysop in any FTN phonebook is invited to participate, invited to
just be themselves and SHARE the FidoNet Technology Experience.  FidoNet
Technology Sysops are *very* special people, this echo is by, for and
about them.

Politeness to each other is EXPECTED!  It IS REQUIRED.  Almost no topic
is "off topic" except as noted below.  The Moderators reserve the right
to BAN any topic.  I reserve the right to "suspend discussion" of a
topic for a time certain.  Be CERTAIN of your FACTS, NAME names, don't
take the cowards way out by using "They said, He said".  Be SPECIFIC.

There are three Moderators. They are:

Christopher Baker;
jim barchuk; and
Debra Milner.

They are the only ones who will make Moderatorial pronouncments to
anyone else. Leave any Moderating to them. We don't expect to have to
do much in the way of moderating in a friendly and cooperative Echo.

A Silent Cry
by Michele Stewart
1:369/21

A few days ago the parents of young Jimmy Ryce, missing since September
after he stepped off his school bus in South Florida, were told their
son was never coming home.

After a 3 month, exhaustive search for this child, a lead resulted in
the FBI and other authorities obtaining a search warrant for the
trailer home of a 28 year old Cuban Immigrant, who was in possession of
Jimmy's bookbag and contents.

The confession followed shortly after. This man kidnapped, sexually
molested and mutilated the body of Jimmy Ryce, and buried the parts
approximately 6 miles from Jimmy's home.  The remains have been
discovered.

And all I read in Fidonews is about the petty squabbling of individuals
as their egos clash over who said what to whom and why. One man gets
excommunicated and forms a new net. Another raises arguments about an
Interim RC and calls the Z1C names for who knows what. And while all of
this so called back stabbing, ego stroking, dictatorship complaining was
going on... a little boy was molested and murdered.

We are now one week away from Channukah and two weeks away from
Christmas. A time for peace on earth and goodwill toward man. A time
when we're told we should be putting aside our differences and work
together to achieve one more step towards understanding our neighbors.

A time to love.

A time to care.

A time to hope.

But not for Jimmy Ryce... nor for his parents.

Think about it.
