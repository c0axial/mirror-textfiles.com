     =================================================================

     John Roberts
     FidoNet 1:385/49

     With many thanks to the Editor, Vince Perriello, the proposed
     IFNA Bylaws and Policy should appear in this issue of FidoNews.
     If you haven't already, here's where you get to see what all of
     the hubbub has been about.

     First of all, a note on availability if you'd like to request
     copies of these documents.  The current version of both of these
     documents is available as I_POLICY.ARC and I_BYLAWS.ARC from
     1:385/49 (XP/9600/HST/V32) and should also be available for
     request from 1:104/424 (XA/2400) and 1:107/583 (XP/9600/HST/V32)
     as well.

     You may well notice that I said "the current version" above.
     That's because these are both Draft documents at this time, and
     while I feel they're pretty solid overall, it's quite likely that
     there will be further changes before the due date for the final
     proposals to be submitted for vote.

     The point is that they're not carved in stone, and it's
     absolutely not too late for you to be heard if there's something
     you feel strongly about.  As a matter of fact, I'd sincerely like
     to hear your opinions.  If you're not interested in establishing
     a link to the IFNA_POL conference, by all means send me netmail.
     While I can't promise a personal reply to each and every message
     that comes in, I will promise to make sure that your opinions go
     before the committee for consideration.

     The IFNA_POL conference itself is still active and available for
     your comments and discussion, and will remain so as long as
     necessary.  The primary EchoMail link for the conference is Fabian
     Gordon at 1:107/323, and it's available in GroupMail format from
     both myself at 1:385/49 and Phil Buonomo at 1:107/583.

     Getting back to the documents themselves, in particular the
     Policy document, you'll notice that a lot of things simply aren't
     covered.  This is the way it was designed.  We've put into the
     basic policy only the things that we feel are absolutely
     necessary to the operation of the network.  The idea is that you,
     the "grunt sysop" (hasn't anyone got a better term for that?),
     are the one who should make the decisions on the details of how
     you want your network to operate, and that you should have a vote
     on each and every item that affects your operation within the
     network.

     FidoNews 6-45                Page 2                    6 Nov 1989


     Thus the modular approach.  Details such as geographic
     boundaries, selection of coordinators, complaint and grievance
     procedures and other such things that have historically been such
     large points of contention will be added to the basic document as
     Appendices.  Each of these will be voted on separately to and
     independent of the basic policy and each other, and there may
     well be more than one choice for each major issue on the ballot
     along with "none of the above", which will also be a valid choice
     in this sort of election based on preference.

     I'm going to be presumptuous for a moment and ask you for two
     favors, even though I've never met or even corresponded with most
     of you before.  The first is related directly to the two
     documents I've been speechifying about, while the second is much
     more general.

     First, when reading these proposals, try not to read anything
     into them that isn't there.  Take them at face value - that's the
     way we've written them.  There's no "hidden agenda" or hidden
     anything else there, just an honest effort by a few people to put
     the control of FidoNet back into the hands of the sysops of
     FidoNet itself.

     Second, when you're given the opportunity to make your voice
     heard, whether by making comments and suggestions or by casting a
     vote in an election, take the few minutes needed to do so.  If
     you don't, then no one can know what your feelings and opinions
     are on whatever issues may be at hand.  I'm not talking just
     about FidoNet here, but about many of the other aspects of life
     as well.  Communication is a two-way process.  It's been said so
     often that it's rather cliche, but that hasn't made it any less
     true.

     Thanks!

             Notice, stating the place, date, and time of the meeting,

             connection with any corporate action by any provisions of
             the statutes of the Articles of Association or of these
             Bylaws, the meeting and vote of members may be dispensed
             with, if all the members who would have been entitled to
             vote upon the action if such meeting were held, shall
             consent (electronically or otherwise) to such corporate
             action being taken.

     ARTICLE III - DIRECTORS

         Section 1. NUMBER AND TERM.

             geographical areas known as zones in the list of systems
             published by the corporation, known as the IFNA or
             FidoNet nodelist, plus an additional 3 directors who
             shall be known as At-Large directors.  No Zone may have
             more than 3 directors representing it on the Board.  The
             Directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of
             members by the members of their respective Zones, with
             the exception of the At-Large Directors, who shall be
             elected by the membership as a whole.  Each director
             shall be elected to serve until his successor shall be
             elected and shall qualify.

         Section 2. RESIGNATIONS.

     FidoNews 6-45                Page 6                    6 Nov 1989


             Any director, members of a committee, or other officer
             may resign at any time.  Such resignation shall take
             effect at the time specified, and if no time be
             specified, at the time of its receipt by the president or
             secretary.  The acceptance of a resignation shall not be
             necessary to make it effective.

         Section 3. VACANCIES.

             If the office of any director, member of a committee or
             other officer becomes vacant, the remaining directors in
             office, though less than a quorum by a majority vote, may
             appoint any qualified person to fill such vacancy, and to
             hold office for the unexpired term and until his
             successor shall be duly chosen.

         Section 4. REMOVAL.

             Any director or directors may be removed either for or
             without cause at any time by the affirmative vote of the
             members or holders of a majority of all the membership
             votes of those entitled to vote, at a special meeting of
             the members called for the purpose, and the vacancies
             thus created may be filled, at the meeting held for the
             purpose of removal, by the affirmative vote of the
             members or holders of a majority of all the membership
             votes of those entitled to vote.

         Section 5. INCREASE IN NUMBER.

             The number of directors may be increased by amendment of
             these Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
             directors, though less than a quorum, by the affirmative
             vote of the majority of the members, at the annual
             meeting or by a special meeting called for that purpose,
             and by like vote the additional directors may be chosen
             at such meeting to hold office until the next annual
             election and until their successors are elected and
             qualify.

         Section 6. COMPENSATION.

             Directors shall not receive any stated salary for their
             services as directors or as members of committees, but by
             resolution of the Board a fixed fee and expenses of
             attendance may be allowed for attendance at each meeting.
             Nothing herein contained shall be construed to preclude
             any director from serving the corporation in any other
             capacity as an officer, agent or otherwise, and receiving
             compensation therefore.

         Section 7. ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.

             Any action required or permitted to be taken at any
             meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee
             thereof, may be taken without a meeting, if prior to such
             action a written consent thereto is signed by all members
             of the Board, or of such committee as the case may be,
             and such written consent is filed with the minutes of
             proceedings of the board or committee.

     ARTICLE IV - OFFICERS

         Section 1. OFFICERS.

             The officers of the corporation shall consist of a
             Chairman of the Board of Directors, a president, a
             treasurer, a secretary, and an International Coordinator,
             and shall be elected by the Board of Directors and shall
             hold office until their successors are elected and
             qualified.  In addition, the Board of Directors may elect
             one or more vice-presidents and such assistant

                             October 31, 1989

     I. PURPOSE

         This document prescribes the responsibilities of any given
         system to be listed in the IFNA nodelist, the
         responsibilities of coordinators at various levels within the
         network, and the requirements for ratification and future
         modification of this document and/or its appendices.

         There shall be no other mandatory requirements for FidoNet
         membership above and beyond those directly stipulated or for
         which specific allowance is made within this document and/or
         its appendices.

     II. GENERAL

         FidoNet is dedicated to the exchange of information among the
         general public, and as such no one may be denied a node
         address based on race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation,
         philosophy, software used, or affiliation with any other
         network.

         The usage of the personal pronouns "he" and "his" within this
         document shall be considered to be gender neutral and equally
         applicable to members of either sex.

         This document and its Appendices are prepared in English, and
         translation to other languages is expressly encouraged.  This
         is not to be construed as a direct endorsement of any given
         language as the official language of FidoNet.

     III. DEFINITIONS

         NODE:  The smallest subdivision of the network, defined as a
         single system operating within the network.  The
         responsibilities of a node are defined in the section NODE
         RESPONSIBILITIES within this document.

     FidoNews 6-45                Page 13                   6 Nov 1989


         NET:  A group of nodes, usually established within a specific
         geographic area, associated with each other by choice for
         administrative purposes and to facilitate mail transfer.

         REGION:  A group of nets and nodes that are not part of any
         net, usually in a specific geographic area, associated with
         each other for administrative purposes.

         ZONE:  A group of regions, usually in a specific geographic
         area, associated with each other for administrative purposes
         and to facilitate mail transfer.

         SYSOP:  For the purpose of this document, the single
         individual with primary responsibility for the operation of
         any given node or nodes.

         COORDINATOR:  A sysop at any given level who is designated
         certain technical responsibilities commensurate to the
         administration of the level of which he is a part.  Specific
         responsibilities of coordinators at any given level are
         defined in the section COORDINATOR RESPONSIBILITIES within
         this document.

         NODELIST:  The listing of node information that reflects
         current addressing, routing, capability, compatibility, and
         other technical information pertaining to nodes within the
         network.  The nodelist is essentially the "phone book" that
         nodes use to communicate with each other.

         ZONE MAIL HOUR:  A one hour period of time set aside for and
         dedicated to the processing of mail within a given zone, as
         designated by the coordinator of that zone.  Specifically, a
         node must operate in a "mail only" mode, performing no other
         task other than the sending and receipt of mail during such a
         designated hour.

         LOCAL MAIL SCHEDULE(S):  Additional mail period(s) as may be
         necessary within any given local net for the processing and
         distribution of mail within that net, as designated by the
         coordinator of that net.

     IV. NODE RESPONSIBILITIES

         To obtain and retain a listing in the nodelist, the sysop of
         any NODE shall be responsible for:

         A.  Compliance with the minimum FidoNet mail session
             standards (at this time, somewhat loosely based on the
             FidoNet Technical Standards Committee recommendation FTS-
             0001) so as to be able to send and receive mail within
             the network.

         B.  Adherence to mail hours and schedules, specifically that
             his node must properly observe zone mail hour as defined
             by the coordinator of the zone of which the node is a
             part, and any applicable mandatory local mail schedules
             as defined by any local policy or other supplement to
             this document.

         C.  Utilizing the most current nodelist available for the
             operation of his node.

                 the status of nodes within the net of which he is a
                 part, and forwarding such information to the
                 coordinator of the region of which such net is a part
                 in a timely manner to ensure its inclusion in the
                 nodelist.

             2.  The assignment of node addresses to individual nodes
                 within the net of which he is a part.

             3.  Ensuring the distribution of weekly nodelist updates

             6.  The establishment of Local Mail Schedules for all
                 nodes within the net of which he is a part, should
                 such be required for the efficient operation of the
                 net of which he is a part or the network as a whole.

             7.  Ensuring compliance with the technical provisions of
                 this document on the part of the nodes of the net of
                 which he is a part, including taking such
                 administrative action as may be necessary to correct
                 non-compliance.

         B.  The coordinator of a REGION shall be responsible for:

             1.  Gathering, maintaining, and compiling the most
                 current information as reasonably possible concerning

                 net within the region of which he is a part, and
                 forwarding such information to the coordinator of the
                 zone of which such region is a part in a timely
                 manner to ensure its inclusion in the nodelist.

             2.  The assignment of node addresses to nodes that are
                 not part of a net and the assignment of net numbers
                 from a pool provided by the zone coordinator of the
                 zone of which his region is a part to groups of nodes
                 that desire to form a net within the region of which
                 he is a part.

             3.  Ensuring the distribution of weekly nodelist updates
                 to coordinators of nets and nodes that are not part
                 of a net within the region of which he is a part.

             4.  Ensuring the distribution of weekly issues of the
                 network newsletter to the coordinators of nets and

                     FIDOCON 90 -- WHERE'S IT GONNA BE?


     The Membership Services Committee, under the chairmanship of
     Jim Vaughan, has been charged with recommending a site to hold
     FidoCon in 1990.

     Would you like to host the next FidoCon in your city?  Here is
     your chance.  Send a proposal to the committee to be considered
     for the honor of hosting FidoCon 90.

     What do you need to do to host FidoCon in your city?  Planning
     an international conference requires a great deal of work on the
     part of the hosts.  A site must be selected with adequate
     meeting space, accessibility, reasonable price and 1001 other
     details.  To give you an idea of what needs to be done and to
     give the committee some information about your city, we need to
     have the following questionnaire filled out:

     LOCATION:

          1.   What is the mileage from the airport to the host hotel?

          2.   Is shuttle service furnished by the hotel available to
               and from the hotel and airport? If not, what is the
               cost?

          3.   Are there direct (no connections) flights from the top
               ten largest metropolitan areas to your airport? Is
               the airport served by International carriers?

     HOTEL FACILITIES:

          1.   Is there a large (150 person) conference room which
               will be available throughout the conference?

          2.   Are there at least three smaller conference rooms which
               will be available for meetings during the conference?
               (75, 50 plus board type rooms.)

          3.   Will there be display space for vendors?

          4.   Will there be a small private conference room available
               for the host and other committees?

          5.   Will  the hotel guarantee room rate,  not to exceed $80
               for double occupancy?

          6.   Will the host committee prepare a list including price
               ranges and bill of fare for all hotel restaurants in
               advance of the conference?

     FidoNews 6-45                Page 21                   6 Nov 1989


          7.   Will the hotel provide early committment on prices of
               banquets, receptions, coffee break service, and any
               other food and beverage service to the conference
               sessions?

          8.   Will the host committee be able to obtain corporate
               sponsors to help defray conference expenses?  Who are
               they?

          9.   Does the hotel have handicap facilities?

         10.   Is the hotel or convention center willing to provide
               help in the planning of the conference?

         11.   Will the hotel allow for special telephone
               connections? (For modems)

               prepared by the local committee?

          4.   Will maps of the area would be provided to attendees?

                          The IFNA Referendum:

                      Democracy or Discrimination?


     The IFNA Referendum has begun.  For the first time in the
     history of FidoNet, every Sysop is being permitted a vote on an
     important issue.

     Or are they?

     From the text of the International FidoNet Association Board of
     Directors resolution:

     [From FidoNews 6-35, "Editorial"]
         We, the representatives of the International FidoNet
         Association, have heard a cry for democracy in the
         administration of the network.  As IFNA is supposed to
         represent the interests of the sysops, and as such
         representation is deemed to have failed, be it hereby
         resolved that:

         Without a mandate from the sysops of FidoNet, IFNA has no
         purpose or reason for existence.

         THEREFORE, the board proposes the following action, of
         which failure to pass will mean the dissolution of IFNA:

         It is hereby resolved that a special election be held for
         consideration by the Sysops of FidoNet of the following:
     [End of excerpt]

     "...a special election be held for consideration by the
     Sysops of FidoNet..."

     It is truly commendable that IFNA is seeking it's mandate from
     the Sysops of FidoNet.  Especially when you consider that the
     resolution goes on to state:

         "In addition, it shall be made clear that approval must
         be gained from a majority of the eligible nodes in the
         nodelist in effect at the time of the election."

     In other words, IFNA is seeking it's mandate not from a majority
     of the votes cast, but from a majority of eligible voters; a
     pretty courageous (and somewhat questionable) referendum practice
     designed to ensure that the members of FidoNet really want IFNA.

     FidoNews 6-45                Page 24                   6 Nov 1989


     While the election might appear open to all FidoNet Sysops, in
     reality it is not.  The Nominations & Elections committee,
     chaired by Steve Bonine, has interpreted "eligible voters" not as
     all members of FidoNet (as defined by Policy), but as Sysops of
     "public-access" nodes:

     [From FidoNews 6-44, "Election Rules IFNA/FidoNet Referendum"]
          2.0  Eligibility.

          The sysop of each public-access node in the FidoNet
          nodelist issued on October 27 (NODELIST.300) is eligible
          to vote.
     [End of excerpt]

     According to the definition of "public-access" which appears in
     the same article, this specifically excludes operators of systems
     which appear in the FidoNet nodelist with a status of "Pvt"
     (private), "Hold", or "Down".

     A quick grep of NODELIST.307 (NODELIST.300 was updated before I
     had the change to write this article) indicates that there are
     308 private nodes, 55 nodes marked "Hold", and 116 nodes marked
     down.  Approximately 479 Sysops are not allowed to vote in this
     referendum.

     How can this denial of the rights of almost 500 FidoNet members
     to vote possibly be reconciled with IFNA's clear desire to make
     sure that the FidoNet really wants IFNA?  The answer is: it
     can't.

     I have been a member of FidoNet since February of this year. I
     have tried to become informed on the issues affecting our network
     and to form my own opinions.  As the result of an unfortunate
     incident (the circumstances of which are not relevant to this
     article) I had my node's status changed from public to private.

     While I understand that Policy does not require a private node to
     operate a FidoNet-compatible mailer during ZMH and restrict voice
     callers, Policy 3 encouraged private nodes to do so, and I do.  I
     respect the our net's local mail hour as well.

     My system has a number of users, although I restrict access to
     members of a local users' group on whose behalf I operate my
     system.

     I have read faithfully Policy documents, and every issue of
     FidoNews I have received.  I have voted in an my local net's
     election of an NC, and in my region's election of an RC; I fully
     expected to vote in the IFNA referendum.

     How then, am I (the operator of a private node) any less eligible
     to vote than the operator of a Mail Only or Public system?
     FidoNews 6-45                Page 25                   6 Nov 1989


     And why, if a Sysop of a node marked "Hold" or "Down" CAN vote,
     should they be prohibited from doing so?

     Further, no reference to "public-access" was made in the original
     draft of the rules for the referendum which was placed in
     FidoNews 6-41 for comment:

     [FidoNews 6-41, "Election Rules, FidoNet Plebescite, DRAFT"]
         2.0  Eligibility.

         The sysop of each node in the FidoNet nodelist issued on
         October 27 (NODELIST.300) is eligible to vote.
     [End of excerpt]

     No later draft was published in FidoNews.  In fact, the final
     rules were not published until the October 30 issue of FidoNews
     (FidoNews 6-44), three days AFTER NODEDIFF.300 had been
     distributed.  By the time the final rules were published, the
     vote was already in progress; providing no opportunity for an
     appeals process.

     While the denial of my right to vote is distressing, it is the
     irony of IFNA, which I have heard called "The voice of democracy
     in FidoNet", so blatantly discriminating against members of
     FidoNet that I find unacceptable.

     I recognize that it is too late to change the rules of this
     referendum.  However, it is my intention to submit a vote in this
     referendum despite the fact that it will not be counted. Other
     members of FidoNet will have to decide for themselves whether
     they will accept this brand of "democracy" in future elections
     and referendums.

                            KinkNet Correction

     In  FidoNews 643, there is an article on the various  Zones  that
     are being claimed by several networks. Among those is Zone 69 for
     KinkNet.

     KinkNet does not, and has never claimed a Zone Number. KinkNet is
     a group of Adult Only Conferences that are distributed to several
     systems. The distribution is not limited to any network. In  fact
     for the most part, KinkNet is pretty much designed to be  Network
     and  Zone unaware, except as the mailer needs the information  to
     get it to the proper destination.

     In  conferences  where the Zone subjects were discussed,  I  have
     personally sent Mr. Whidden public denials of KinkNet's claim  to
     Zone 69. And this has been in more than one message.

     As  the Moderator, Co-ordinator, and Originating system  for  the
     KinkNet  Echos, I think it can be considered that I speak on  the
     Authority of "Head SOB What's In Charge of KinkNet."

     I may be reached via the following address's:

            FidoNet    1:204/40
            AlterNet   7:406/40 or 406/0
            EggNet    99:9403/1, 9403/0, 99/104 or 910/105

     Please note, there is no Zone 69 there.

     GET OUT THE VOTE!

     Now is the time for all good men (and women) to come to the aid
     of our country, and our country is IFNA.

     Sounds kinda wishy-washy... but it does being me to a point.

     In FIDONET we are citizens of a 'democracy' that somehow works
     by and for itself.  This great network is held together by
     perpetuity and nothing else.  It's existance is an entity.

     IFNA was created by more than just a few people wanting to 'get
     organized'.  I was created because it was and is NEEDED.
     Fidonet will most likely succeed and grow without IFNA. Then
     again, will IFNA grow without the aid of a democratic heirarchy
     to absorb the blows delivered by the many unseen forces? I think
     not.

     IFNA, in it's best form, serves many purposes.  Thom Henderson
     said it best when he described to an inquirer, just what IFNA
     is and does.

     Quotations taken from FIDO643.NWS
       Thom Henderson
       "Open Response to Charlie Smith"

         "IFNA is often perceived by many people as being a  thing
          outside of FidoNet, when in fact it has always been very
          much a  part  of FidoNet.  It is and has always been the
          legal representation of FidoNet."

     ...Is and has always been the 'legal representation' of FidoNet.

     Hard to say it with enough emphasis.

         "FidoNet has no existance  under  the  laws  of the land.
          Does FidoNet exist?  Yes, of course it does, but how?...
          ...But the  laws recognize  none of  them. The laws (and
          the  government, and  the  IRS, and other organizations)
          recognize  only  people.  Either  flesh-and-blood people
          (born  of  men and  women, heir  to death and taxes), or
          "incorporated  people" (born of lawyers and accountants,
          potentially immortal, but still heir to taxes)."

     Those unseen forces that deliver the blows...

         "If  FidoNet  is  to  relate  to society around it in any
          meaningful way, it must have some corporate existance."

     Exactly.  It must have more than a bunch of sysops, each with
     their own STRONG opinion - each constantly battling over the same
     issues time and time again...  There must be a governing force -
     a referee recognized by a majority of the society as one who can
     weigh factors while wearing a blindfold.  (sound familiar?)

     FidoNews 6-45                Page 28                   6 Nov 1989


         "The whole point of IFNA is not to 'govern'  FidoNet, but
          to act as the sysops' vehicle for furthering FidoNet."

     Of all, this has to be the most profound truth. It is the ideal,
     the idea behind democracy!

     We need to INSURE that this democracy continues...  but even
     more, since there are some new people in the positions - new
     officers - in the last year, people (SYSOPS) like you and I
     that have seen the black eyes of fighting for what's right
     and against that which is wrong, we must VOTE to re-organize
     this already recognized entity of ours - called IFNA.

     We could rebuild from scratch, but that would take more time
     than most of us care to argue over.  If the referendum fails -
     I WILL be there to help rebuild, but I for one don't believe
     it is necessary.

     I see a new light coming from where there was once darkness.
     The leadership of IFNA has opened it's blackened eyes to look
     at itself and the tattered shape it has kept.  It now sees
     where a change needs to me made.  The FIDOCON 1989 was a CRUX
     in the history of this great entity.  It was at that meeting
     that the referendum was created - it was there that many eyes
     were opened.  Now that the final battle is being called  -  we
     MUST gather ourselves up and fight to rebuild the dream that
     almost fell to the ground.

     Lets not waste these hard learned lessons by starting over from
     scratch, instead lets VOW to rebuild a model representative
     structure - one our governments would envy.

     Take your ballots from FIDO644.NWS or NODEDIFF.300 and send them
     with your 'YES' Vote to your Net Coordinator  TODAY.

     Stand up and be counted!

       ZEAMON IMPROVES WILDCARD SUPPORT FOR DOS AND OS|2
     Command Line Program Applies Enhanced Pattern Matching
               to Common DOS and OS|2 Commands

     SoftCare Systems announces Zeamon, a software utility which
     provides programmers and power users with an extremely powerful
     wild card syntax for common DOS and OS|2 commands such as Copy,
     Dir, and Delete.  All Zeamon commands can combine enhanced
     wildcards with Boolean operators (and, or, not) allowing users to
     specify exactly which files to process.

     For example, a command such as "Copy everything except files with
     the extension .OBJ to A: ..." is easily accomplished by typing
     "Z copy *.* -*.OBJ A:".  The ability to include and exclude
     multiple files by using + and - Filters is the heart of Zeamon's
     power.  Also, the '*' wildcard character has been enhanced to
     mean "match zero or more characters" so that the expression *INV*
     matches any filename containing the string "INV", such as
     "INVJAN89", "JAN89INV", "89INVJAN", and "INV".

     Zeamon provides the complete command line control of your files
     that most users have only dreamed about.  It is more powerful,
     simpler to learn, and much faster to use than any DOS shell
     program on the market today.

     With Zeamon, all commands are enhanced to support:
          - Greatly improved wildcard matching facilities
          - Searching/processing multiple directories in one command
          - Searching multiple drives and directories in one command
          - Processing based on specific dates or date ranges
          - Processing based on the ARChive or Modified flag
          - Prompting for and optionally formatting new diskettes,
            when needed

     The Directory command can sort the listing in any order.  It
     always displays file attributes, the total number of bytes used
     by the selected files and the actual disk space occupied by the
     files, accounting for sector sizes.

     Zeamon adds four new commands to the operating system - Move,
     Update, List, and Execute.  The Move command will transfer files
     between disks or directories, deleting the original files.
     Update compares two disks or directories, replacing old files on
     the target with newer one from the source.  The List command
     generates formatted output of selected files which can be used
     for creating batch files.  Zeamon's Execute command will pass
     each files selected by the wildcards to the program of your
     choice.

     The product also comes with utilities to change file dates and
     times, file attributes, and a way to quickly find the amount of
     free space on all disks attached to a system.

     FidoNews 6-45                Page 30                   6 Nov 1989


     A full implementation of Zeamon's directory command is available
     fro free from many bulletin board systems, including SEAboard
     (201-473-1991 8-N-1).  Download ZDIR.ARC, which includes the
     executable program and full documentation.  The program is also
     requestable from the StarShip ][ bbs (201-935-1485 or node
     1:107/583@FidoNet, 520/583@AlterNet, 9:807/2@Pnet).

     Zeamon can be purchased from SoftCare Systems for $69 plus $5
     shipping and handling.  The product comes with free telephone
     support for registered users.

     =================================================================
                           LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
     =================================================================

     Doug Hall
     1:132/111

     Dear FidoNews Editor,

     You published my letter-to-the-editor in FidoNews 640 (page 15)
     suggesting revisions to this publication which would make it of
     greater use to run-of-the-mill sysops like myself. After it was
     published I received some unsolicited supportive netmail from
     around the net.  I haven't yet received any telling me that I
     have my head screwed on backward. (Copies of selected messages
     follow.)

     On the other hand I haven't received any response from you
     regarding the suggestions one way or the other.

     Here, in summary were my suggestions:

     1. Writers should never use abbreviations or jargon without
        explaining them the first time they are used.

     2. Stop repeating the same information every issue (IFNA Board
        of Directors, membership stuff, masthead details, calendar
        of events,etc.)

     3. Articles published should relate to the common network
        interests of sysops.

     4. Article writers should not be allowed to allude to
        communications outside of FidoNews itself without adequate
        explanation.

     5. Don't publish software upgrade information without
        explanation.

     Do these suggestions not seem sensible? Do you have any plans for
     revising FidoNews at all?  Your perspective would be of interest.
     Thanks for the consideration.


     Here are some of the messages I have received.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Doug,

     Just wanted to drop a note of support on your FidoNews article.
     Your view of FidoNews is so accurate I couldn't help but find
     myself chuckling while  reading it.  I certainly hope that
     someone is taking your suggestions to  heart as they are very
     valid.

     Doug,

     I enjoyed reading your letter in FidoNews, at last something
     worth reading in that, um, magazine.  What has been your responce
     on what you said?  I too was going to write a letter similiar to
     that, but as of yet have not.  Well, again thanks, and let's hope
     that someone really listens to your letter - I know I did.

     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     Howdy Doug!

     Well I must say that I thought your message in regards to What
     Fido News is all about was very worthwhile reading in this latest
     issue of Fido News!  I certainly hope that the editorial staff
     will take action on all of your suggestions!

     I have been with FidoNet for two years and, like you, fail to see
     anything worthwhile for the average FidoNet SysOp to be reading
     within these FidoNews releases.

     I was really impressed with the way you maintained your tact and
     diplomacy throughout the entire content of your message.  If I
     would have sent in something like that, I don't think it would
     have been quite as cohesive.... and would have ended up going
     into the Nul bucket.

     Well, I just wanted to personally send you a Thank You for the
     fine article that you submitted telling it like it really is with
     the Fido News.

     Hello Doug Hall,

     I just dutifully unpacked the fido news. I read your article.

     Good lord you had a title, a subject, and there was even your
     name and address. I didn't even have to guess at what you were
     talking about. Some of those thingie-ma-bobs in the news letter I
     have never been able to figure out what the author was talking
     about.
     FidoNews 6-45                Page 33                   6 Nov 1989


     What are you trying to do, mess up the system?

     Bless your heart.

     I hope they pay attention to your words, but I doubt it.

     I would settle, as starters, for just removing all the pagination
     and pretty paper formatting. That would save a good 40% on the
     darn volume of that thing. You orta try reading that bugger with
     a 40 column machine. Luckily I don't have to try that any more.

     Anyway I agree with you whole heartily..

     (Doug,)

     I applaud your suggestions.  I think Fidonews is crowded with
     non-essential and "useless" information, to the point that many
     people have not been reading it.  I for one, was unaware of the
     singular events that occurred at FidoCon this year because, among
     other things, I had dispensed with reading the FidoNews.  I think
     your suggestions, all of them, were very good, and hope that at
     least some form of all of them get incorporated into the
     editorial policy of FidoNews.

     One of the things that I would like to see is information about
     where the software that is listed as updated in each issue is
     obtained from in the event we can't find it within our network.
     I'd also like to see more articles on operating the software, and
     more complete descriptions of what is going on in FidoNet.  It
     would be interesting to have some sort of survey of how many
     people are actually involved in Networking as a Hobby, and some
     information of the other networks, both competing and cooperating
     sorts.

     I was also one of the far ends of a network for awhile before
     moving to the "big" city of Albuquerque.  I spent a lot of money
     on long-distance bills to collect what was often useless garbage
     about Non-Network stuff that got put in FidoNews.  My response
     was to finally tell my Network Coordinator (NC) that  I wished to
     be left off the distribution list for the News altogether.  Of
     course, then I ended up being left off the distribution list for
     everything,  and I had to make a special arrangement to get
     nodediff's from a friendly  sysop who would put stuff on hold for
     me to poll for it.  Still it was a  hassle, and all because I was
     tired of getting the FidoNews with a bunch of  useless stuff in
     it.
