     More of the same, just weirder.  A serious eye problem has kept me
     from doing much with computer screens for the past week, but it is
     slowly healing....enough for me to scan over the usual and see that
     the same continues...and perhaps a bit more keenly...

     This week, the same perceptions are brought forward, while more goes
     on in the background...perhaps it's time to bring some of it forward.

     After looking over Cindy Ingersoll's list published here last week,
     I find it interesting to note that nearly every Zone 1 node that
     offers Fidonet via Internet charges for access, but nearly every
     non-Zone 1 node does not.

     This at a time when Fidonet is shrinking in Zone 1, but growing in
     other countries, and despite the fact that Internet access is cheaper
     in Zone 1 than anywhere in the world.  For that matter, so is
     telephone service, computer equipment, and everything else involved
     in running a BBS.

     It's hard not to attribute a cause-and-effect relationship to this
     correlation but I suppose I can manage.

     After all, the Stars manage, no?

     Likewise, the consistent threat of at least one such provider to 'no
     longer carry FidoNews' if it contravenes that person's 'view' as to
     what the FidoNews should or should not publish, carry or cover has
     worn thin.  The less-than-veiled threat of censorship by not carrying
     FidoNews only makes the threat more visible for what it is...plain,
     simple censorship.

     Besides, without the FidoNews, that same provider would not have a
     own platform to spew forth a version of hate, innuendo and less than
     complete truth...as much an accusation as has been slung at this
     Editor by the same person.

     I suppose no one will truly be happy until the Snooze is controlled
     by a group devoted to their own agenda...or until their coalition of
     convenience breaks down.

     Likewise, the comments on vendettas and other alleged pogroms being
     carried out by this Editor pale compared to the same vendettas and
     pogroms being carried out by our long-time columnist, and in his own
     published column...but, then, I suppose it is acceptable until your
     own ox is gored, no?

     In the same vein, it is also interesting to see a pair of articles
     submitted by someone who has openly declared that FidoNet Policy is
     but merely a 'suggestion'...then acts to have that same Policy used
     to protect his own agenda.

     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 2                   13 Jul 1998


     One note:  Didn't David Hallford publicly declare he would never
     return to FidoNet so long as Bob Kohl was in a coordinator post?

     How odd, as well, that the happy neighbors of the late Roy Rogers
     have pulled up stakes and moved to Canada from California...but, then
     again, the same persons behind the move also have distinct problems
     in following Policy as well, so perhaps it is a good thing to keep
     them all together.

     After all, trying and convicting people by the court of 'public
     opinion' is so much more convenient than getting both sides of a
     story.

     In brighter news, Damian Walker has published election results in
     from Zone 2's recent elections...and we've published the first page
     of available Fido-Over-IP listings, since the Falcon site went 'dark'
     in Region 50.

     And, with great appreciation and honor, I'd like to point out a new
     FidoNews site in Estonia, a former holding of the defunct Soviet
     Union, which is translating the FidoNews into the Estonian language.
     As well as the sister site in Sweden, we see two sysops willing to
     translate the FidoNews for their own members in their own languages.

     Translation is a time-consuming and tedious prospect, especially to
     those who are not truly fluent in the other language; the efforts of
     these sysops should not go unrecognized, either within their own Zone
     or by FidoNet itself.

     As with the other listed sites performing similar translations to
     present Fido information in native languages, it is an honor and
     privilege to see that those sites in the other Zones still observe
     the original mission of FidoNet...communication, at a lower cost and
     convenience to all.

     Perhaps Zone 1 can learn from this before it allows politics to tear
     it apart, hmmmmm?

     "MISDIRECTION -- TOO GOOD TO STOP NOW"

     by Ben Hamilton, FidoNet 1:124/7008

      bk> First point, the ZEC duties were written with input not only
      bk> from the RECs, but from the sysops of Z1 themselves. There was
      bk> no single author to the list.

     Bob Kohl was the lone original author of the list.  It was he who
     wrote the first draft and then submitted it to all for their
     comments.

     I have since changed the way I refer to the ZEC duties.  I now say:
     "The ZEC duties, as originally written by Bob Kohl, amended and
     approved by the RECC, and sanctioned by the ZC."  Hopefully that
     covers all of the bases.  :-)

      bk> More to the point is some of the RECs convenient use of the
      bk> list selectively without "remembering" that the list also
      bk> notes the use of an interim ZEC.

     So?

      bk> When I was elected, I started sending out netmail looking for
      bk> a replacement for the Elist keeper. In the end, there were two
      bk> individuals that were working on a replacement for the Elist:
      bk> Thom (the appointed replacement Elist keeper), and Marshall
      bk> Presnell.  Marshall is a professional software engineer and has
      bk> been for years.  Marshall was also a Fidonet sysop for many many
      bk> years. He offered to help and, as Thom was, in the process of
      bk> building an Elist replacement.  As things progressed, I
      bk> continued to give feedback on the issue to the ZC in an
      bk> impartial manner as I felt I was expected to.

     Without consulting or informing the RECs in any way.

     Yes, Bob Kohl chose to keep the information about Marshall's project
     a secret from the RECC.  The RECC could have made a more informed
     decision on the best replacement for the echolist if it had been
     properly informed of any and all projects that any *ECs knew of.

      bk> In the end, Thom was selected by Bob, and my congratulations
      bk> or condolences as the case maybe.

     Amen!

      BH> As I must continually remind you because the editor keeps
      BH> asking, Kohl's first act after winning the ZEC election was to
      BH> ask the RECC how he should go about removing an NEC from office.
      BH> He did remove the NEC.

      bk> Wrong, as noted both in the REC echo and in other echos the
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 4                   13 Jul 1998


      bk> question was one that was brought to me by the *C side and
      bk> possibly looking for an alternative to the normal means of
      bk> an RC dealing with the issue.

     What's wrong?  The NEC *was* removed from office.  That is a fact.

     If Bob Kohl was not also an RC, there would be no issue, since ZECs
     cannot remove NEC flags from the nodelist.

      bk> There is nothing wrong with looking for an alternative means
      bk> to deal with an issue except of course when it's turned around
      bk> to make it look like there's political motivation involved.

     Bob Kohl has said many times that he does not discuss his RC duties
     in the REC echo, yet above he says that he brought up the issue
     himself.  Both cannot be correct.

     If the motivation was not political, I invite Bob Kohl to explain
     what the reasons were for the removal of the NEC flag.

      BH> He soon removed an NC.

      bk> I'd like everyone to remember Ben's statement that what goes
      bk> on in Reg 10 is none of his business.  Sounded good at the
      bk> time, didn't it?

     It still sounds good now!  I'd like to remind Bob Kohl of the entire
     statement about Region 10, as it was posted a few weeks ago in Fido-
     News:

      BH> Region 10 business, frankly, is none of our business.  However,
      BH> things that happen in Region 10 do make it easy to see what can
      BH> happen when the "multiple hats" suggestion in Policy 4 is
      BH> ignored.

     Translation:

     I am by no means interested in the internal workings of Region 10 so
     that I can change them.  I am only interested in them because it
     proves that if Bob Kohl acts this destructive in his own region, it
     is bound to overflow into his Zone duties.  That is when it is
     important to me.

      BH> His REC quit, saying that he could no longer stand working with
      BH> Kohl.

      bk> Ben's memory of the time line is a bit shakey.  The REC quit
      bk> before any action about this issue took place.

     Time is not the issue.  The REC did quit because he could not stand
     working under Bob Kohl's thumb.  That is a fact.

      BH> He disclosed some in-transit netmail.

      bk> Ben also likes to paint with a very broad brush. There were
      bk> two complaints brought up. One was dismissed, the other was
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 5                   13 Jul 1998


      bk> explained and apologized for.  Someone sent me netmail and I
      bk> cc'ed Bob Satti when I responded.

     The fact is that the netmail was not "to" Bob Kohl.  And:

      bk> While technically it is disclosing in-transit mail, ...

     Bob Kohl admits to disclosing in-transit netmail.  The sender and
     recipient probably do not care if it was "technical" or not, and
     I do not think that the writers of FidoNet's policy did either, else
     they might have written the section on in-transit mail differently,
     perhaps choosing to cover this exact situation.

     I suppose it just goes to show that Bob Kohl cannot be trusted with
     the confidentiality of any netmail passing through his system, so
     everyone would be wise to use other more private means of transport,
     as suggested in policy.

      BH> Are these the actions of a active, effective, responsible ZEC?
      BH> Can you honestly say "yes" in good conscience?

      bk> Is this the same Ben Hamilton that suggested to a sysop that
      bk> he should change his node number to poll someone?  Using an
      bk> unissued nodenumber?  Ben should spend a moment reading P4.

     I have read P4 many times.  I suggested to a sysop that he change his
     node number to something that a new sysop might use, like /9999, long
     enough to determine whether or not Bob Kohl had him passworded out of
     his system or not.  There is no harm in that, as no mail transfer
     would be taking place, and the rest of the sysop information (sysop
     name, location, etc.) would still be passed.

     It should also be noted that, if Bob Kohl did indeed password this
     sysop out of his system without his knowledge, this entire procedure
     would not be necessary.  Since Bob Kohl will not answer (or has not
     yet answered) whether or not he did password out this sysop, we may
     never know the truth.

     If the truth is that the problem was elsewhere, I would appreciate
     an explanation so that I can offer an apology.

      bk> I find it interesting that [Ben Hamilton is] now suggesting
      bk> behavior that is generally frowned upon or considered illegal
      bk> per P4.

     I encourage Bob Kohl to quote the section of policy that states that
     my suggestion is unacceptable.

     Z1C tries to bully Z1R10 refugees

     by Dave Beach, 1:163/222

     An entire net in Zone 1 Region 10 recently voted unanimously that
     they had seen enough of their region and wanted to go somewhere they
     thought they'd be appreciated in Fidonet. Region 12 accepted them as
     net 1:2404.

     In a similar development, Region 12 accepted as a Regional
     Independent node the former Regional Echomail Coordinator of Z1R10,
     who had been hounded out of Fidonet by Bob Kohl, the present (and
     perpetual?) Z1R10C.

     Eager readers may wish to refer to another article submitted for this
     issue, which documents a survey in which 74.2% of respondants
     indicated that they were not satisfied with Bob Kohl representing
     them as their Regional Coordinator.

     These nodelist developments were reflected in nodelist.191. Welcome
     1:12/120 and net 1:2404, Region 12 is pleased you wanted to become
     part of our little corner of Fidonet.

     The Zone 1 Coordinator, Bob Satti, recently had this to say about
     the issue:

      BS> I notice you have 'adopted' an R10 node as an RI (independent),
      BS> and an R10 network in total. I was not consulted about either
      BS> of these items, and I doubt that RC10 was consulted.

      BS> I'll come straight to the point...

      BS> I want to see a segment arrive here from you before next
      BS> Thursday's (July 16th, 1998) nodelist production with the
      BS> aforementioned network AND the RI items deleted.

      BS> These nodes are not to stay (or reappear) in your segment
      BS> unless the RCC overrules me on this matter.

     I'm not sure why Bob Satti thinks that Fidonet sysops are his
     subjects, bound to accept his dictates, but he's surely forgotten
     that Fidonet is a loose collection of sysops and systems who share
     some common goals, and is not about forcing them into political
     subdivisions because you're a Coordinator-for-life and have
     decided that means you must Exercise Power Over Your People.

     Perhaps rather than use bullying tactics to force sysops to
     do something they've collectively and unanimously decided they
     don't want, Bob Satti's time would be better spent analyzing
     what's going so tragically wrong in Z1R10 that would prompt an
     entire network to thumb its nose at its regional nodelist clerk.

     issue, which documents a survey in which a majority of respondants
     indicated that they were not satisfied with Bob Satti representing
     them as their Zone Coordinator.

     It's up to you, Bob. Will you acknowledge that the "command and
     control" philosophy that you and some of your colleagues on the
     Zone 1 RC Council have promoted and promulgated are running this
     Zone headlong into oblivion, or will you sit back while it happens,
     secure in the knowledge that when the last Zone 1 sysop calls it
     quits at least you'll still be "in charge"?

     Region 25 Has a New REC
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

     Occasionally I see requests from international moderators for
     information on getting echomail to and from region 25, better known
     to some as the UK.  So I thought it might be appropriate to post in
     Fidonews the summarised results of our recent REC election.  The
     positions were:

         1st.    John Burden     41 votes
         2nd.    Steven Gare     14 votes

     Congratulations to John Burden and commiserations to Steven Gare.
     John Burden's address is 2:255/1, although shortly he should be
     contactable at the region's standard REC address, 2:25/10.  I hope
     someone finds this information useful.

     Interesting to note that, unlike Dave Beach or Doc (Gossip Queen)
     Logger, the ZC does take the time to look at both sides of an
     issue and, of course, the facts. It would seem that the self-
     appointed Guardians Of Fidonet up in net 163 do not have those
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 8                   13 Jul 1998

     Ahh yes! The use of 'facts according to Dave'.  Got to hand it to
     him, since he seems to have no shame.  There was only 1 NC replaced
     for the mentioned reason.  In fact during the course of my term as RC
     there have only been two "active" NCs replaced.

     Both the NCs that were replaced could be counted on to vote against
     me in the RC 10 election due to the influence that the old NCs have
     in their respective nets.  One of the old NCs and the past NEC run
     their echomail feeds for free.  A healthy influence on the way that
     the sysops of the net think since bribery is an well established
     source of influence down through the ages.

     I'm sure that Dave couldn't possible accept the fact that there are
     many NCs in Reg 10 that seem to little if any problems in the way
     Reg 10 has worked these past years.

     36 replies! Wow, now there's a real representation of the region with
     many times that number in sysops.  It's interesting to note that Dave
     little submission to the Snooze and in the echos runs almost on a par
     with those of Spiro Agnew many years ago.

     It would also due to note that the number of "dissatisfied" sysops
     runs roughly about this same number and the "infamous" list server
     had about just this many particpants.  What a coincidence! I'd have
     to say that Dave took this survey into net 2004 before they decided
     to "go north", chuckle...he needed those numbers.

     Yep, nice to know that Dave thinks that roughly 10% of a region is a
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 9                   13 Jul 1998


     true repesentation of that region's opinion.

     Besides Dave, please don't bother to tip-toe around that fact that
     Bob Satti is not on your list.  We've known that you have wanted him
     and at least two other RCs out for some time now along with some
     of the other misfits and gossip queens that are local to you.  Nor
     do we need Ben Hamilton's hypocrisy towards other region's affairs.

     Below is a rather typical response from a Reg 10 sysop towards
     Dave's little poll:

     Zone 1 Region 10 nodes speak out on the issue of the recent
     "election" for Z1R10C

     by Dave Beach, 1:163/222

     On the subject of the recent Zone 1 R10C "election", the Z1C,
     Bob Satti, made recent statements in the Z1C echo that indicated
     that he had his finger on the pulse of Z1R10, and that anybody
     who questioned him on the issues simply didn't have all the
     information. Bowing to growing public pressure to do something
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 10                  13 Jul 1998


     about a system that has him maintained in office with the support
     of unelected, appointed Regional Coordinators, he called an
     "election" for the position of Z1R10C and provided the sysops with
     a mere couple of days in which to nominate candidates before voting
     began. Only NCs in the region were eligible to vote, and Bob Kohl
     had spent the last couple of months replacing NCs with which, as
     Z1R10C, he had decided he "couldn't work". Needless to say, Bob
     Satti's handpicked incumbent, Bob Kohl, was the successful
     candidate.

     In order to try and verify the statements that Bob Satti made, a
     survey of Z1R10 nodes was commissioned.

     Some 339 survey forms were sent out, the intent being to account
     for each warm body in Region 10 minus the Network Coordinators.
     The survey forms were all host-routed through the recipients'
     respective NCs.

     36 replies were received, of which one was from an NC who had
     mistakenly been sent a survey form (and whose reply was therefore
     not counted), one was a completely blank netmail other than header
     info and kludge lines (a request for clarification was sent, no
     reply received), one was from a node who claimed utter and complete
     apathy, and two were demands to know what right I had to be asking
     Region 10 sysops for their opinions on anything. Despite persistent
     rumours that a Region 10 NC netmailed my NC and RC demanding to
     know what I was doing "butting into Region 10 business", I never
     did hear from her myself.

     The responses break down as follow:

     ----------------
     | Question (1) |
     ----------------

     | Question (5) |
     ----------------

     The Zone 1 Coordinator, Bob Satti, has stated that he called the
     kind of election that he preferred. Are you in agreement with the
     way this election was conducted?

        Yes 12.9%
        No  87.1%

         "As all but two of the NC's of this region are all appointed or
         grandfathered in by the RC, a NC only vote only showed the
         support of those NC's who are afraid of or in cahoots with Bob
         Kohl."

        "There was little if any communication."

     ----------------
     | Question (6) |
     ----------------

     Would you have preferred to have the opportunity to directly cast
     your own vote in the RC election?

     filed against Bob Kohl relating to his disclosure of in-transit
     netmail, and that the Zone 1 Regional Echomail Coordinator Council
     has voted overwhelmingly that they do not support Bob Kohl in one
     of his other capacities, that of Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator?

        No  19.4%

     | Question (8) |
     ----------------

     Are you satisfied with Bob Kohl representing you as Region 10
     Coordinator?

        Yes   12.9%
        No    74.2%
        Other 12.9%

         "Bob Kohl does NOT belong in any administration position within
         Fidonet."

         "He does his job (for the most part) but his people skills
         suck, he can never give a clear answer, and he holds personal
         grudges."

       the election. I believe several sysops may not have had an
       opportunity to voice their opinions with their Net coordinators."

       "I am leaving Fidonet as a direct result of this election. The
       way it was conducted shows the ZC cannot perform his duties. The
       results are not representative of the concerns of the members of
       this region.

       Also, the NC's acted as the sysops representatives; thier (sic)
       votes should have been published."

       "My BBS will go down on or before July 31st, because of the
       recent decisions of Satti, and the so-called election of Kohl."

       "I am glad to see that this is being done after the so-called
       election farce that was held in our Region."

       "Down with King Kohl, and Bob Satti is next on our list if he
       fails to recognize our backing him so far, and relying on him to
       impeach Kohl for malfeasance of office. I hear the grass roots
       growing!"

       "Have a great day!"

     =================================================================
                                  COLUMNS
     =================================================================



     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who was
     busy drinking Absinthe on the slopes of Gornergraat. Across
     the valley, the Matterhorn rises in purple splendour and
     below, chubby gentlemen in leather training pants are
     blowing elongated horns which produce sounds akin to moose
     in full rut.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     Being stuck in Switzerland in July has many drawbacks, not
     the least of which is that the charming international
     tourists who are busily photographing everything in sight.
     Even the bronze frog which spouts into a fountain in Zermatt
     has started to develop a squint from the incessant camera
     flash discharges.

     The Snooz was rather chunky last week including two articles
     by Kohl whose ghostwriter made their presence obvious by the
     lack of spelling mistakes and mangled grammar. Even His
     Zorchness' editorial was a monument of disingenuousness. It
     would probably be unkind to mention that His Zorchness has
     been in high dungeon lately over a supposed "second" elist
     robot program. What makes Zorch's editorial bellowing more
     amusing is that he forgot to disclose his personal interest
     in the other elist proposal. Mercifully, any newspaper
     writer who has a conflict of interest takes pains to make
     disclosures and we can look forward to seeing Zorch
     correcting his inadvertent omission of that relevant fact.

     I note that Kohl's ghostwriter had this cheesy excuse for
     his disclosure of in transit netmail. "There were two
     complaints brought up. One was dismissed, the other the was
     explained and apologized for. Someone sent me netmail and I
     cc'd Bob Satti." Actually, they did not send netmail *to*
     Kohl, they sent it to another system which passed through
     Kohl's system. Kohl extracted the contents on the way
     through, responded to it, revealed its contents, and then
     made the fatuous claim that it was a technical glitch
     resulting from the way his system is set up. If Kohl is to
     be believed ( a dubious proposition) then he must have been
     disclosing *all* intransit netmail to Bob Satti. Satti,
     being a man of few words, has studiously avoided confirming
     whether Kohl's version of reality is correct. Kohl cites the
     other instance where he was caught disclosing in transit
     netmail as being "dismissed" which is not to say that the
     act didn't happen.
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 15                  13 Jul 1998


     In Kohl's second alleged article wherein he uses the word
     "diatribes" which is well beyond his actual vocabulary
     grasp, Kohl winds his way through a cloud of smoke without
     bothering to deny that his vendetta against Ruth Argust
     results from a pathetic incident over a horse. I am quite
     willing to post a retraction if Kohl can send me a
     correction as to the facts.

     At the risk of writing a tautological article that
     references past Snoozs, I was disappointed by Andrea Santos'
     article which advocates the equivalent of designing a camel
     by striking a committee charged with designing a horse. The
     issue is not the dispersion of titles and responsibilities
     for the Snooz, but the simple need for people to submit
     content. Creating nine new admin Snooz positions will do no
     good at all unless those individuals are actually writing
     copy. If there is a criticism to be made of His Zorchness,
     it is the fact that unlike previous editors of the Snooz, he
     does not appear to be actively soliciting articles. As an
     example, I'd dearly love to see an article from some of our
     Russian brethren describing the changes over the last decade
     that have fostered the incredible growth of fidonet. I'd
     also like to see an articulate discussion of the Zone2
     policy debate which seems to be surfacing in the ZCC echo.

     On the matter of his Zorchness' policy complaints against
     Ruth Argust, it is simply amazing that he was joined by
     three other cretins who filed identical complaints. Knowles,
     George Kuhl, and Dan Sherman should have a deserved place in
     the Fidonet Hall of Shame for lending their names to the
     venal actions of Frezberg in this matter. There is something
     truly rotten in the state of Denmark if these idiots are the
     NCs of which anyone in Fidonet could be proud. It is small
     wonder that the stench of Kohl's presence pervades Region10
     considering the low quality of the NCs that he has
     appointed. If ever there was a case to be made for the fact
     that Peefour only arms socially maladroit morons, a reading
     of Frezberg's policy complaint would suffice to settle the
     argument.

     Yo Zorch, did you vote twice in the ZEC election?

     I have some interesting quotes for this week's column. The
     first is taken from a message that Bob Kohl sent out to his
     loyal fartcatchers in Region 10:


     "You'll note that not every NC and NEC in Reg 10 is getting
     this note. I'm sending it mainly to the key group of Admin
     folks in Reg 10 that I've worked with these past years to
     rebuild and revive Reg 10 or that have shown concern for the
     smooth operation of the Region and their own nets. It is
     also this group that I expect to keep this note within the
     group.
     ...

     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 16                  13 Jul 1998


     We are Reg 10, let's make sure that everyone is aware of
     this, including Bob Satti. And as a statement from the NC's
     of Reg 10, I sincerely hope you'll support and sign a PC
     against Ruth when it gets put into motion. While I could
     have easily done it myself, I sincerely  think it sets a bad
     precident for my to do so or to be involved in it
     directly."

     That gem was written by Kohl in an effort to garner support
     for a Policy Complaint campaign organized by His Zorchness.
     The following quote is very long, but well worth including
     because it contains the entire text of Bob Duckworth's
     ruling on Zorch's policy complaint. (For those concerned
     about the niceties, I have received Bob Duckworth's
     permission to quote his ruling in full)  Read and weep...

     Re: Policy Complaint filed by you against Ruth Argust
     Original to: Zorch Frezberg (1:205/1701)


     Zorch Frezberg,

     It is extremely disturbing that I have to send this message
     at all. With your being a Network Coordinator I am sure you
     understood the action you were taking when you filed a
     Policy Complaint against Ms. Argust. Per Policy 4.07 a
     Policy Complaint is not an action to be taken lightly.

     Your Policy Complaint against Ms. Argust is rejected in
     total.

     The opening portion of your Policy Complaint against Ms.
     Argust is a very disjointed mish-mash and very hard to
     follow. However, Ms. Argust did rebut your statements, and
     also pointed out that some of the submitted documents have
     also been tampered with (ie. missing subject lines and
     appended orgin lines.)

     A single netmail tittled "official inquiry" does not
     constitute an earnest effort to resolve a problem. Ms.
     Argust submitted a copy of a message in which she replied to
     you in the hopes of resolving the problem between the two of
     you. She claims that you never responded to the questions
     she raised in netmail in reponse to your "offical inquiry"
     netmail, and you failed to provide any proof that you did in
     fact respond. You did include the netmail that she replied
     to your "offical inquiry" netmail with so by all
     indications, you in fact were the one who failed to resolve
     the problems. In hopes that you did indeed follow policy and
     continue your attempt to resolve the problem, I did read all
     the echomail which you enclosed, and did not see her
     questions to you answered via that medium either, although
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 17                  13 Jul 1998


     she did in fact provide evidence of why her name was
     presented during the EMSI portion of mailer handshaking.
     Reading through Policy 4.07 it does not say that the
     informal attempts to resolve a problem prior to the filing
     of a policy complaint must be made in private. That you
     failed to try complete a resolution informally can not be
     blamed on the fact that she posted anything in the echoes
     when in fact you could have netmailed her and asked that she
     work with you only via netmail on what you considered to be
     problems.

     I reject this policy complaint from you in total because of
     your failure to continue your attempts to resolve the
     problems. I am also presenting my findings on each of your
     separate charges.


     zf>   = CHARGE 1
     zf>   = Violation of Netmail confidentiality under section
     2.1.6.2; specifically, the release of netmail for the
     purpose of annoying others, and in this case, involving
     others not in the chain of appeal, as defined in Section
     9.1, last para of Policy 4.07; further, that such release
     was done in order to make improper accusations and undue
     disruption of FidoNetconstitutes EXCESSIVELY ANNOYING
     BEHAVIOR.
     zf>

     I find in favor of Ms. Argust on charge 1.

     The netmail which you sent to her with the subject line of
     "offical inquiry" was not marked as confidential. Since you
     failed to mark this message as confidential, Polcy 4.07
     Section 2.1.6.2 shall apply here, specifically where it
     states

     "The issue of private mail which is addressed to you is more
     difficult than the in-transit question treated in the
     previous section.  A common legal opinion holds that when
     you receive a message it becomes your property and you have
     a legal right to do with it what you wish.  Your legal right
     does not excuse you from annoying others.

     In general, sensitive material should not be sent using
     FidoNet.  This ideal is often compromised, as FidoNet is our
     primary mode of communication.  In general, if the sender of
     a message specifically requests in the text of the message
     that the contents be kept confidential, release of the
     message into a public forum may be considered annoying."


     It is clear in policy that the message in question was hers
     to do with what she wished. If the public release of your
     netmail was annoying to you, it is not covered by policy
     since you did not take the proper measure to prevent her
     from posting your message in a public echo by clearly
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 18                  13 Jul 1998


     marking the message as confidential.

     Even more important, I did not see any proof that Ruth
     Argust disclosed the netmail in question. All I saw in her
     post was the header and the cc:'s of the messages. There was
     no disclosure at all of the body text.


     zf>   = CHARGE 2
     = 'As indicated in the logs submitted by the various NCs of
     Region 10, it is clear that the system Ruth Argust used to
     mail out from was representing itself as 1:2004/0. Ruth has
     offered several clarifications in an effort to explain this,
     but has not explained the one most significant problem;
     whyshe felt it necessary to register the software *as*
     1:2004/0, since she and Gerry claim that their net has
     elections (See CHARGE2.001).The fact that the clarifications
     are specious is obvious...thenode in question will
     consistently display itself as 1:2004/0 regardless of who
     the NC is, and will interfere in mail routing and
     distribution upon their removal/departure from the posts
     that they hold.

     This failure, along with the fact that numerous mailer
     programs cannot distinguish between a multi-line and a
     single-line node, as seen in the attached logs, clearly
     shows the connecting mailer as being 1:2004/0.  There is no
     specific mailer in place which lists Gerry Calhoun as
     NC2004, operating 1:2004/0 as the nodelist defines.

     This is indicated in the various logs included in the
     evidence file (See CHARGE2.004, CHARGE2.005, CHARGE2.006 and
     CHARGE2.007).

     This would be no significant matter, and likely to be
     dismissed, per Ruth's numerous claims that "this is just the
     way that the software is set up", save for _one_ salient
     point:

     In the recent Z1 EchoMail Coordinator election, Ruth Argust
     had submitted her vote, presenting herself as "1:2004/0",
     and Gerry Calhoun had submitted his vote, presenting himself
     as "1:2004/205" (See CHARGE2.002 and CHARGE2.003; note that
     CHARGE2.003 is the roster of voting nodes from the Election
     Coordinator).

     Likewise, as can be noted in the log files, it does not
     matter to which phone number/node that one is connected
     to...*all* nodes on the connection present themselves as
     "1:2004/0" and with Ruth Argust as the sysop of the node
     reserved for the N2004C, without regard for the reality of
     the situation.  This can be seen in the log files, as the
     "home node", "Node #2" and "Node #3" all present as
     "1:2004/0" on connection, and all as "Ruth Argust".

     Under Sections 1.2.3 and 1.2.4, the NC is normally
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 19                  13 Jul 1998


     responsible for the exactness of the network nodelist
     segment, and also may not delegate the responsibility to
     mediate disputes.  Given the nature of the identity problem
     with the /0 node, and with regard to who the system is
     operated by, as well as the chaos which such a system
     identification can cause, is clearly disruptive now, and
     will be disruptive to the smooth operation of FidoNet, the
     Region and their own network in the near future.  Such
     disruption is in  violation of Policy 4.07, Sections 1.2.1.1
     (identifying users), section 2.1.3 (identifying who is
     responsible for entering traffic), and Section 1.2.8, second
     para (smooth operation).

     Since the system in question was co-operated by the then-NC
     of Net 2004, the above should have been well known and
     familiar as a part of the knowledge of Policy 4.07 that all
     Network Coordinators are to be familiar with.  However, as
     the actual software is registered by someone who is not nor
     has ever been the Network Coordinator, as well as co-opting
     the reserved address for the Net Coordinator of Network
     2004, the action is  now the responsibility of the node
     operator...which is listed  as being Ruth Argust.

     Such actions and efforts by Ruth Argust do constitute
     EXCESSIVELY ANNOYING BEHAVIOR.'
     zf>


     Zorch Frezberg, you have not provided proof that Ruth Argust
     sent mail out from the Fido address of 1:2004/0. During
     handshaking in the emsi portion, the line SYSOP: Ruth Argust
     was presented.

     Note that Policy 4.07 is very clear in sections;
     1        Overview
     1.2.1    Individual Systems and System Operators
     1.2.1.1  Users
     2.1.3    Responsible for All Traffic Entering FidoNet Via
     the Node
     1.2.8  (second paragraph)
     1.3.4    Nodelist
     that the system operator is defined by the nodelist.

     Your statement that the system software is registered to
     1:2004/0 is not backed up by the included file CHARGE2.001.
     What I see in CHARGE2.001 are statments by Ms. Argust that
     the mailer software is registered in her name. She further
     states the the system the software operates on is
     co-operated by Gerry Calhoun and presents the addresses of
     1:2004/0, 1:2004/200 and 1:2004/201. Nowhere does she state
     the software is registered as 1:2004/0. In Ms. Argust's
     reply to the Policy Complaint, she included a message from
     the software author with what must be placed in the sysop
     name field for the software to operate in the registered
     mode.

     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 20                  13 Jul 1998


     You further claim that the software will always present
     itself as 1:2004/0 without any proof to this fact. The
     addresses for the system which Ms. Argust and Mr. Calhoun
     co-operate can be changed at will. This claim is based
     solely upon your conjecture and is not backed by any
     evidence you have submitted. Policy 4.07 is very clear the
     charges must be supported by evidence. For a NC to make such
     a claim and provide no evidence, displays an obvious lack of
     understanding of Policy 4.07.

     After Zorch Frezberg's netmail message with the subject line
     of "offical inquiry" was received, a change was made to the
     system which had the address of 1:2004/0 to present SYSOP:
     Gerry Calhoun NODE X (where X is the node connected to) in
     addiction to SYSOP: Ruth Argust. This shows that Ms. Argust
     did attempt to rectify what Zorch Frezberg had a problem
     with, although Frezberg did not specify what portion of
     Policy 4.07 mandates what must be presented during emsi
     handshaking.

     Ms. Argust claims the system in question had been
     functioning in the same manner well over two years. During
     that time, she says she had never received any other
     comments as to the way the system presented itself. That she
     reconfigured the system after your concerns were voiced
     shows that she made an earnest and honest attempt at
     resolving the issue. The fact that Zorch Frezberg never
     responded back after Ms. Argust changed the manner her
     software was setup shows that Zorch Frezberg did not attempt
     to resolve the issue. Zorch Frezberg also failed to state
     what section of Policy 4.07 was being violated by presenting
     SYSOP: Ruth Argust during the emsi handshake.

     Zorch Frezberg's "salient point" is based upon the fact that
     Mr. Belcke recorded the vote as orginating from the wrong
     system. Mr. Belcke was in error in recording the vote and
     Ms. Argust attempted through netmail to correct the way the
     vote was recorded. The blame for Mr. Belcke to not correct
     the vote after he was in fact informed of his error does not
     reflect on Ms. Argust. Ms. Argust did include copies of her
     exchange with Mr. Belcke with only the candidate names and
     her password blocked out and Mr. Belcke's replies.

     Zorch Frezberg, you should read the Policy 4.07 in its
     entirity and not just read it so that you can file a Policy
     Complaint. Policy 4.07 clearly states that the system
     operator is defined by the nodelist. Zorch Frezberg, you
     have failed to show where Policy 4.07 or any approved FTS
     document mandates what MUST be shown during emsi handshaking
     or in a mailers logs.

     Zorch Frezberg, you claim that there was an "identity" with
     the /0 node in net 2004. However, Policy is quite clear as
     to who the /0 node belongs to as Policy 4.07 clearly states
     that the nodelist defines who operate what nodes. You
     further state "Such disruption is in violation of Policy
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 21                  13 Jul 1998


     4.07, Sections 1.2.1.1 (identifying users), section 2.1.3
     (identifying who is responsible for entering traffic), and
     Section 1.2.8, second para (smooth operation)." Yet, those
     same sections clearly state that the nodelist defines the
     operator of a node.

     The system in question was and is co-operated by the then
     NC. This was in fact the system the then NC used to perform
     his NC duties. Being the system that did such duties, it
     rightly used the /0 node number. The node operator of the
     system that presented the /0 address has never been Ruth
     Argust, since the node operator per Policy 4.07 is defined
     by the nodelist issued by the I.C. and had always been
     listed to Gerry Calhoun until his removal from that
     position.

     You are correct in one small statement in this CHARGE 2.
     That is that the NC is to be familiar with Policy 4.07.
     However, your lack of knowledge in regards to this charge
     inparts a great deal of questioning in regards to your
     knowledge of Policy 4.07.

     I totally reject and dismiss CHARGE 2 and clear Ms. Argust
     of any wrong doing in regards to CHARGE 2 and Policy 4.07
     for the following reasons.

         1. The netmail with the subject "official inquiry" does
     not appear to be an attempt to resolve a problem, rather it
     appears to be an investigation. After Ms. Argust changed
     what her system presented upon emsi handshaking and
     contacted Zorch Frezberg back, Zorch Frezberg did not
     continue to attempt to resolve his "perceived" problem.
     Therefore, I can not find that an attempt was made to
     resolve this in an informal manner. In fact, I find that
     Zorch Frezberg has not made any comment on what was
     presented after Ms. Argust changed what was presented during
     the emsi handshake after Zorch Frezberg expressed his
     concerns. Therefore, I can only conclude that the problem
     was resolved. If a problem is resolved between two sysops,
     there is therefore no need for a policy complaint.

         2. Zorch Frezberg failed to state what section of Policy
     4.07 or what part of any FTS document was violated by the
     presentation of SYSOP: Ruth Argust during emsi handshaking.
     It being that Zorch Frezberg is a member of the standing
     FTSC, he should be familiar with the FTS documents and been
     able to provide such evidence.

         3. Zorch Frezberg has failed to provide what section of
     Policy 4.07 states what must be present in a mailers
     logfile, therefore the mailer logfiles are not relevent in
     this issue.

         4. Zorch Frezberg as a Network Coordinator should be
     familiar enough with Policy 4.07 to know that the nodelist
     as issued by the I.C. defines who a system operator is.
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 22                  13 Jul 1998


         5. Zorch Frezberg has failed to present a single message
     signed by Ruth Argust as Network 2004 Coordinator.


     zf>  ' = CHARGE 3
     In addition to the above, the constant posting of mail
     intended for the discussion of administrative functions in
     Region 10 has been consistently cross-posted out of netmail
     and Region 10 administrative conferences, in an effort to
     "expose" matters in Region 10.

     However, the messages posted to national and international
     echoes are also with respect to questions of character and
     ability for other posts and actions, with the use of Region
     10 as no more than a cover for harrassment and calls for
     interference.

     The sheer volume of mail, both in echomail and netmail, has
     started a self-regenerative loop with rumor feeding rumor,
     and rumor then becoming "fact" in the minds of many.
       For example, there has been a consistently posted comment
     that a "netmail smear campaign" was begun by Bob Kohl; yet
     no evidence of such a message has been made available, and
     all inquiries for a copy of it have been fruitless.
     Everyone seemed to have "heard of it", but not one
     individual or group of individuals has been able to
     demonstrate a copy of such messages.

     Likewise, as the message is supposedly between other
     individuals and sent to Argust and Calhoun, the disclosure
     of such contents is in violation of Policy 4.07, Section
     2.1.6.1, as no Policy  Complaint has been attached to such a
     message, and by their own  description, the message was sent
     as NetMail, and not as EchoMail.

     This portion of the Policy Complaint will be conceded and
     withdrawn, provided proper evidence is shown that the
     so-called "netmail smear" message was posted as EchoMail or
     as 'private mail' intended to keep a 'sysop-only' echo
     restricted.

     However, as to the portion in which excessive echomail and
     netmail is being generated for no other purpose than to
     interfere in the ability of the Region Coordinator to
     perform duties properly, I will not withdraw that portion of
     the Policy Complaint, and will carry it forward regardless.
     The specific harm, per Section 1.3.5, is that the efforts of
     Argust and others have caused Region 10 to be unable to
     locate and obtain an acceptable and qualified Regional
     EchoMail Coordinator.  The annoyance is now excessive in
     that the failure to appoint a new REC has become a
     'rallying point' in use by Argust and others in a new wave
     of harrassment, despite being caused by the efforts of
     Argust and  others (See CHARGE3.ZIP, please note summation
     in CHARGE3.000).

     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 23                  13 Jul 1998


        Further, that Ruth Argust has made the effort and
     succeeded in posting to a Regional administrative echomail
     conference that she had been specifically removed is a more
     clear indication that her interests are specifically for the
     purpose of disruption of  Region administration;
     significantly, since this requires the Regional Coordinator
     take additional actions to prevent any further incursions,
     and thus adding to his duties and efforts. Inteference on
     the Network, Regional and Zone levels indicates EXCESSIVELY
     ANNOYING BEHAVIOR (See CHARGE3.042).'
     zf>

     CHARGE 3 deals with echomail. While some points dealing with
     echomail are mentioned in Policy 4.07, the points you, Zorch
     Frezberg, bring up in CHARGE 3 are not applicable here.

     2.1.6.1 deals with IN-TRANSIT netmail. In reading your
     evidence for CHARGE 3, I do not see that Ms. Argust posted
     any netmail at all, let alone any IN-TRANSIT netmail. If she
     had posted netmail addressed to her and sent to her, it was,
     therefore, her personal property to do with what she
     pleased.

     1.3.5 Deals with excessively annoying behavior. Zorch
     Frezberg, you claim that Ms. Argusts posts are excessively
     annoying because they are preventing Bob Kohl, the R10C,
     from performing his duties. Yet, you have not presented a
     single message from Bob Kohl that states such. You also
     state that talking about regional issues creates
     controversy. If such actions create controversy, then
     perhaps it is time to look at the issues.

     You further state that Ms. Argust posted to a regional
     Administrative echo from which she was specifically removed,
     yet you have not provided any proof for the claim that she
     was removed from this echo.

     I hereby reject and dismiss the claims against Ms. Argust in
     regards to CHARGE 3 and do not find her guilty of any wrong
     doing in respect to Policy 4.07 and CHARGE 3 for the
     following reasons.

         1. You, Zorch Frezberg, have not provided any proof of
     any attempts to resolve this problem before filing this
     policy complaint as spelled out in Section 9.1 of Policy
     4.07

         2. You, Zorch Frezberg, have provided no proof that Ms.
     Argust was guilty of disclosing IN-TRANSIT netmail per your
     charge of violation of section 2.1.6.1. I see no netmail
     disclosed in any of the many posts you have presented.

         3. You, Zorch Frezberg, seem to have this CHARGE 3
     confused with CHARGE 1 where you claim she disclosed private
     and confidential mail and offer as evidence CHARGE1.002.  I
     state again that she did not in fact disclose anything other
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 24                  13 Jul 1998


     than who received the mail since she quoted only the message
     header and the cc: list. Her quote stopped right after the
     private and confidential per Policy 4.07 line and she did
     not quote any of the message text.

         4. You, Zorch Frezberg, have failed to prove that the
     behavior of Ms. Argust in any of the echomail had anything
     to do with preventing the RC from fulfilling his duties.


     zf>  ' = CHARGE 4
     = The fact that a number of public posts have been made by
     both Argust and Calhoun that they have no access to the
     Region 10 administrative echoes, and are thus locked out of
     any forum to present their case is proven false, based on a
     NetMail sent to the RHub Sysop, M Hernandez, at 1:10/2, in
     which Calhoun asked for all passwords to be removed from
     that system which allowed connection to his own (See
     CHARGE4.001).

     That Calhoun would ask is a clear indication that he is
     indeed aware of the other sources for the administrative
     echoes to be available; that he still denies his ability to
     access shows a contradiction that he has not been able to
     clarify adequately. Clearly, in EchoMail, Argust and Calhoun
     are claiming that they have no access to administrative
     echomail in Region 10.

     Yet in the NetMail shown in CHARGE4.001, Calhoun declares he
     wants an already available connection to remove all
     passwords, making it impossible for him to connect to an
     available source for those same administrative echomail
     areas for Region 10.

     The obvious problem is that Calhoun as well as Argust are
     maintaining a public image that is in direct opposition to
     what they know to be true...that a connection exists.

     Please note; the point is not that no connection exists, but
     that one was available to Net 2004, but was deliberately
     turned off and refused, at the same time as claims were made
     that no such connection was available to Net 2004.

     As with Charge #3, this seeming contradiction serves little
     purpose than to bring about unwarranted traffic for no other
     purpose than to harrass and interfere with the smooth
     operation of Region 10, by interfering with the duties of
     the Regional Coordinator, both directly and indirectly.

     By lying over the issue of connectivity, a deliberate action
     as opposed to an honest mistake, the fabrication becomes an
     intentional one, and thus excessively annoying behavior in
     that the action affects not one or two nodes but an entire
     Region of sysops, and thus affecting the smooth operation of
     Region 10.

     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 25                  13 Jul 1998


     While the specifics against Gerry Calhoun are best addressed
     by  the Regional Coordinator, that such actions were both
     condoned and carried out by Ruth Argust in an effort to both
     diminish and harrass the administration and function of
     Region 10 necessitates that a Policy Complaint is in order.

     By affecting the RC in the performance of duties, it is the
     responsibility of the RC to take action against an offending
     node; when the node is a Network Coordinator under the
     Regional Coordinator, it is clear that the Network
     Coordinator is no longer able to hold that position.  As
     Gerry Calhoun has been replaced as the N2004C, that avenue
     is already dealt with and now moot.

     However, when it is a sysop that pushes the envelope in a
     manner to take action to disrupt the administration of the
     Region, it is the duty of a Network Coordinator to take
     actions necessary to insure that a clear 'line of
     communication' exists between the Network and the Regional
     Coordinators, and it is necessary to adopt a stand of "zero
     tolerance" towards behavior designed and taken for no less a
     purpose than to disrupt the function of the Region; thus
     Ruth Argust is charged within the confines of Policy 4.07,
     Sections 1.3.5, for what is EXCESSIVELY ANNOYING BEHAVIOR.'

     Charge 4 also deals with echo mail content. I fail to see
     where you, Zorch Frezberg, have included a single message
     from Ms. Argust to in your documents submitted for this
     charge backup this claim of excessively annoying behavior.
     In fact the only thing you submitted to backup this charge
     was a single netmail from Gerry Calhoun, asking that all
     passwords be removed from a system that presents the address
     of 1:10/2. This is not a policy complaint against Mr.
     Calhoun, rather, it is one against Ms. Argust. The sole
     evidence you have submitted with this charge has also been
     tampered with since Mr. Calhoun does not append an orgin
     line with the address of 1:205/0 to his netmail messages.
     You also make the claim that the actions of Ms. Argust have
     prevented the R10C from fullfilling his duties as a Regional
     Coordinator. You have failed to present any evidence to
     backup this claim. You have not submitted a single message
     from Bob Kohl, R10C, that states this fact. I only have to
     rely upon your statements that the R10C can not fullfill his
     duties because of the actions of Ms. Argust in echomail. You
     have once again neglected in CHARGE 4 to provide any proof
     that simple basic communication between yourself and Ms.
     Argust took place in regards to CHARGE 4 before your action
     of filing this complaint.

     CHARGE 4 is hereby dismissed in total for any and all of the
     following reasons:

         1. You, Zorch Frezberg, have failed to submit any proof
     that you attempted to resolve this matter with Ms. Argust
     before filing this policy complaint.
     FIDONEWS 15-28               Page 26                  13 Jul 1998


         2. You, Zorch Frezberg, have failed to provide any
     verifiable evidence per Policy 4.07, section 9.1 that states
     in part "Complaints must be accompanied with verifiable
     evidence, generally copies of messages; a simple
     word-of-mouth complaint will be dismissed out of hand." You
     sole item of evidence to back up your claim against Ms.
     Argust, was a netmail writen by Gerry Calhoun which had been
     tampered with. Nothing was submitted that was written by Ms.
     Argust or that even mentions Ms. Argust.

         3. You, Zorch Frezberg, have even failed to show that
     Ms. Argust was NOT denied access to any regional echoes as
     she claimed. As the accuser it is up to you to provide the
     proof of any crime. In this charge the crime that you claim
     is that she said she did not have access to regional admin
     echoes. A simple netmail from her uplink to remove passwords
     with an unrelated node does not provide such proof. Ms.
     Argust had indeed questioned Bob Kohl, the R10C, in echoes
     about her access and feed to regional echoes but in
     particular the regional SYSOP echo. Had Mr. Kohl responded
     in the echoes that she did indeed have access and you could
     have provided that message, then that could have been
     admitted to evidence to her having access to the echoes. Mr.
     Kohl however did not respond to her questions that I ever
     saw though. In fact, Mr. Kohl has sent netmail to me as
     N2004C stating that Ms. Argust and Mr. Calhoun can not in
     fact have access to the regional echoes, and has stated in
     the R10 admin echoes themselves that Ms. Argust and Mr.
     Calhoun are not allowed access. When I asked Ms. Argust if
     she did in fact ever get a notice from Mr. Kohl himself on
     the matter, she stated she never has in respect to the
     regional sysop echo which is the echo that she was
     questioning as I saw it in the national echoes. I could in
     fact send you copies of the messages I have seen by Mr. Kohl
     regarding this if you require them, but since this policy
     action is not against myself, I can see no reason to furnish
     you with them.


     zf>' These charges do not rest lightly, nor is this document
     posted frivolously; it is posted in the sincere effort that
     Ruth Argust understand the consequences of her actions and
     the affect that they have on others who care not for her
     polarization of attitudes in FidoNet.

     Zorch Frezberg, I fail to agree with you in regards to the
     action of your filing this policy complaint not being
     frivolous. In fact I find it quite trivial, especially in
     regards to your CHARGE 2. As a member of the FTSC, I would
     have expected you to be able to provide proof of what was
     violated during the EMSI handshake if in fact anything was
     violated. One of the people that you in fact sent the policy
     complaint to for them to file for themselves in fact is even
     more guilty of any perceived violation than Ms. Argust.

     Log of Bob Duckworth, 1:2004/209 and 1:2004/0

     ----------  Tue 23 Jun 98, FD 2.12.SW
     + 19:42:16  Event 0-@
     + 21:14:54  Calling Region 10 Echomail Coordinato, 1:10/1,
     1-510-841-9481
     = 21:15:18  CONNECT 14400/ARQ
     + 21:15:22  Sci-Fido II, World's Oldest SF BBS, Berkeley,
     CA, 1:161/84
     ~ 21:15:22  SysOp: Richard Knowles  Ja
     ~ 21:15:22  Using: Opus 1.73
       21:15:22  sType: FTS-6/ZedZap
     * 21:15:24  Sent I:\FD212\PACKETS\000A0001.REQ; 7b, 3 CPS
     + 21:15:31  Mail transfer completed
     $ 21:15:31  To 1:10/1,  0:13, 0.

     I do have full logging turned on but the system that answers
     the phone at 1-510-841-9481, which is listed in the current
     nodelist.170 as the phone number of the system operated by
     Jan Murphy, 1:10/1, Region 10 Echomail Coordinator does not
     present the AKA of 1:10/1. It also does not present Jan
     Murphy as being the system operator, rather it lists Richard
     Knowles   Ja as shown above.

     The policy complaint in total shows one thing very clearly.
     That is that you, Zorch, did not undertake this policy
     action with the intent of making sure policy was enforced
     but you filed it because you had disagreements with another
     sysop and are merely attempting to use policy to silence her
     for the sake of your own agenda.

     With this response to you, I am also sending a message to
     Bob Satti, requesting that he grant a change of venue should
     Ms. Argust request one if you take this complaint to appeal
     since the Regional Coordinator is clearly involved in at
     least two of the four charges.

     Visage, I don't think I would want to bet long odds on
     whether Bob Duckworth's courage in writing that decision
     will go "unrewarded" by Kohl and his legion of trolls. It
     does much to explain why syncophants like Knowles are so
     desparate to keep Region10 nonsense "in the family" because
     the reek of their actions doesn't look too appealling when
     exposed to daylight.

     I must go Visage, the cable car operator has announced the
     last run down to Zermatt and I can only hope that another
     U.S. jet doesn't clip the cables on the way down. Your
     secretary is in fine fettle and has left a wake of broken
     arms on the Italians who have mistakenly tried to pinch her
     ass.
