     We have a new International Coordinator for FidoNet, it seems.

     This brings us to a point to sit back and reflect on a few things,
     not the least of which is the ongoing polarization of FidoNet between
     those who profess democracy versus those who claim that they are
     carrying it out.

     What good does it do to foment a _destructive_ anarchy, when a
     constructive and cooperative one works so much better?

     I note with irony that so many claim to be against the "political
     games" and "power trips"...and yet, so many of those complaining are
     using those same things that they complain about to obtain exactly
     what it is that they claim to be against.

     And, as with any other situation, it does help to be a bit more aware
     of the _facts_ than to listen to only one side and act.

     Perhaps we should all adhere more to the ideas that Tom Jennings put
     forth, and as quoted at the end of each issue of FidoNews.

     In the News...

     Apologies for the delay in releasing this issue, but RanD left me a
     heller of a formatting problem...another reason why it is important
     to follow the ARTSPEC.DOC format.  RanD also submitted another
     article, but it was not complete, and has been sent to him for
     clarification.  Rather that be accused of censorship once more, the
     article as received will be posted, with a correction hoped for next
     week.

     As a consequence, any article not submitted in accordance with
     ARTSPEC.DOC will most likely be delayed at least one week from time
     of submission, if extensive formatting is required.

     The usual diatribes, the ubiquitous "doomsday" clock from Ward, and
     a genuine article or two.

     IC ELECTION NOTICE

     It is with pleasure to inform all SysOp's, the ZC's have at
     long last managed to select a new International Coordinator.

     By a majority, current Zone 1 Coordinator Bob Satti, is the
     new IC.

     We congratulate him.

     It took many months to select a new IC and believe me, there
     was some heated discussions going on in the ZCC echo during
     this time.

     The ZCC can now continue with it's task ahead.

     R10C Assumes New Duties
     by Gerry Calhoun, 1:2004/200  gerry@petpride.org

     The R10C, Bob Kohl, seems to enjoy taking on new duties. If you
     recall he was just recently confirmed by Bob Satti in the past ZEC
     election. Soon after that, his REC, David Hallford, submitted his
     resignation as R10EC. David was kind enough to give three weeks
     notice to Kohl so that Kohl could arrange for a replacement for the
     R10EC position. Those three weeks have since passed and Region 10 has
     been without a REC in the NODELIST for three additional weeks.

     In his credit, in the past six weeks, Bob has told folks in the
     regional admin echo a couple times that he is talking to someone
     in Northern California about the position. Not whom he was talking
     to or anything else of substance, just that he was talking to someone.

     While he has been talking (for 6 weeks), he has decided to take on
     another responsibility, that of nodelist editor. He, as R10C, has
     decided to remove the NEC from Net 2004. This was not done due to her
     not fulfilling her duties as NEC, but rather because she is critical
     of his actions and inaction as R10C. His removal of her was done
     quickly and efficiently. He simply removed the UNEC flag at the end
     of her 1:2004/201 entry in the nodelist. He did not inform either her
     or the NC before he took this action.

     Kohl's efforts just last February to remove her were opposed by the
     former R10EC when Kohl approached David Hallford on this matter. That
     was one of the reasons David stated that he could not function as the
     R10EC. This action by Hallford showed that he was able to put personal
     feelings aside when it came to work as he and the NEC in question
     (Ruth Argust) had some quite heated exchanges during the recent ZEC
     election campaign. As I understand it, Kohl, upon becoming the Z1EC,
     asked as one of his first questions to the RECC, how he could remove
     an NEC. I heard that the consensus of the RECC was that he could not.

     Kohl seems to think it is important to take care of editing a net's
     nodelist segment and that it is one of his duties. On the other
     hand, he ignores the fact that one of the nets in his region has a
     still nodelisted NC who sent him a message in December giving him
     thirty days notice that he was shutting down his BBS. He did so on
     December 31,1997. The nodes in that net now have no NC and Kohl
     should have either see to a replacement, merged them into another
     net or moved them regional. It appears that since Net 204 does not
     talk badly about Kohl they are not a problem, the fact that they do
     not talk at all is irrelevant.

     On the other side of the coin, we have a net with ONE node in it. Net
     2003 for some time has had only one node in it. The system listed as
     1:2003/2 has had a disconnected number for months. The other nodes
     for that net all refer to the same system.

     FIDONEWS 15-15               Page 4                   13 Apr 1998


     While on the topic of the nodelist, it should also be known that Kohl
     has taken on a new hat under an assumed name. In Bob's home Net 102
     segment, there is an improper flag of NEC with no preceding U. This
     in and of itself is not a great cause for concern. However, the fact
     that the nodelisted NEC is not in reality the NEC having resigned
     sometime ago is a bit questionable. Even more questionable is the
     listing for 102/2 that has traditionally been the Net 102 mail
     machine. The listing for this node is as follows:
     ,2,SoCalNet_EC,Los_Angeles_CA,Echomail_Coordinator,1-310-553-6379...
     If we were to simply go by the listed system and sysop name, it would
     appear that this is the NEC for net 102 and that the NC had simply
     overlooked removing the NEC flag after the former NEC resigned.
     However, upon closer investigation calling 1:102/2 reports a sysop of
     Pat Paulsen, a known "hero" of Bob Kohl, a man whom Kohl admires. In
     fact, you may remember that Bob had even made an entry in the nodelist
     last year in the R10 regional section for Kohl's phone number with
     Paulsen listed as sysop. Further investigation has shown that Kohl is
     attempting to run the mail machine from his home, along with all of
     his other duties but for almost THREE MONTHS has not been able to get
     it functioning because he can not configure the software. Thus, the
     Net 102 CRP has no backbone echomail, no local echomail and it has
     been reported that their routed netmail is also non-functional.
     Almost THREE MONTHS to set up a mailer? I think if you locked twenty
     chimpanzees in a room with twenty computers loaded with the software
     for a week, one of them would have hit enough of the right keys to
     get a mail machine working.

     This, folks, is what our new Z1EC has been up to. One of the duties
     assigned to him as ZEC per the duty list he had a large hand in
     creating, is overseeing the formation of a Zone 1 Echomail Policy.
     If you have followed what has happened in FIDOECHOPOL, the echo
     created to assist in the formation of said policy, you have seen it
     degenerate into chaos because of the rules, published and unpublished
     there. The one question that has been repeatedly asked by the
     participants is why an echo policy is needed but this has been
     declared off topic.

     This, my friends, is some of what our R10C and new Z1EC has been up
     to and what he has not been up to. It appears he has plenty of time
     to work in the backroom without enough time to work in front of us,
     doing what he has been charged with for the various positions he
     holds. Lately he has been claiming that real life has not been giving
     him enough time to perform his FidoNet duties. Let's hope that before
     he gives us more of his attention that someone explains to him that
     the "C" in his titles stand for COORDINATOR, not CONTROLLER and that
     when he devotes more time to us, it is in the front room instead of
     the back.

     The Planet of 300 Foot Pinocchios - by Doc Logger


     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger (163/110) who was
     busy trying to decipher the extraterrestrial signals sent by
     Bill Whitehorse. As near as could be translated, the
     messages said: "Don't talk to plants when the moon is full"
     but that could be an error due to Sunspot interference with
     the transmissions.

     Roll da flic, Zorch.....


     Dear Reverend Visage,

     The week has passed with the usual amusements provided by
     the same cast of Fido elflords. It seems that all of
     Fidoland is soon to be ruled by Bob Satti who assembled
     enough votes to become IC. It is only a minor trifle that
     Satti didn't deign to ask his own zone who they would prefer
     and hasn't obtained a mandate to act as Z1C. Ward Dossche,
     Z2C, who possessed both an electoral mandate and a consensus
     of the Zone 2 sysops was brushed aside in the stampede to
     ensure that representative democracy is kept at bay for
     another year at least. Triples all round at the ZCC
     conference and may the farce be with them.

     What is more remarkable about the selection of Satti is that
     he was busily mischaracterizing Dossche's position in the
     Z1C echo, and then had a minor pouty fit when Dossche posted
     corrections to Satti's nosestretchers. Satti wasn't alone
     however, because our lil' buddy Dallas "Pinocchio" Hinton,
     R17C was trying to defend having stuffed $een-bys into
     echomail traffic. Poor Dallas was also caught telling fibs
     about the topic of discussions in the Z1REGCON echo but used
     the quite incredible explanation for his duplicity that the
     Z1REGCON echo wasn't open to the public anyway. Visage,
     you've had more experience with Nixon than I have, but is
     situational ethics endemic in all walks of political life?
     Jerry Swartz, R16C, tried to float the same outrageous
     dissemblings and we can only hope that his explanations are
     as entertaining as Hinton's.

     Not to be outdone, our very own Zorch chose to parse some of
     Dossche's messages a little differently than the rest of the
     universe and managed to discern hints that Dossche was
     trying to stifle free speech. The truly hilarious part of
     Zorch's rant is the fact that what he incorrectly accuses
     Dossche, Zorch appears to be doing with his warnings to Ruth
     FIDONEWS 15-15               Page 7                   13 Apr 1998


     Argust about flying an appropriate mailer flag on a shared
     system. I'm not sure that irony is in Zorch's vocabulary but
     it certainly abounds in the splendour of his messages and
     editorials.

     For this week's Chautauqua I'll lead off with a quote from
     Niccolo Machiavelli's "The Prince" which is a sort of primer
     for the expedient and cynical forms of governance.

     "How laudable is it for a prince to keep his word and govern
     actions by integrity rather than trickery will be understood
     by all. Nonetheless we have in our times seen great things
     accomplished by many princes who have thought little of
     keeping their promises and have known the art of mystifying
     the minds of men. Such princes have won out over those whose
     actions were based on fidelity to their word."

     And one more quote from Dallas Hinton, R17C, writing about
     the qualifications for a ZC:


     "As far as *I'm* concerned, only a current RC is even
     remotely qualified for  the job.  The average NC could no
     more be a successful ZC than walk to the  moon."


     In the selection of Satti as IC, I think we have seen this
     Machiavellian principle employed with predictable
     consequences. On the one hand, Satti was bleating that he
     couldn't entertain legitimate requests for representative
     democracy because he was "saddled with policy" and on the
     other hand explaining that the previous IC had been elected
     by an "extension" to policy. What was sauce for the goose
     apparently isn't sauce for the gander. We had the amazing
     spectacle of the Z5C whose Zone numbers 86 sysops, casting
     an equal vote to the Z2C whose zone numbers 14,000 sysops.
     The Z5C's vote was made even more amusing by the fact that
     he was telling the FN_SYSOP mob that he was a keen supporter
     of representative democracy. Clearly, he is clueless as to
     the meaning of the words.

     We also have the quote from Hinton, R17C, who demonstrates
     an utter disdain for the abilities of NCs, and one wonders
     what opinion he actually holds about sysops. Hinton was one
     of the Great Minds who ensured that Satti wouldn't need to
     suffer the *inconvenience* of a sysop vote.

     I think what was more tragic about the IC election is that
     it could have provided a mechanism to chart the course of
     Fidonet's future. The issue of the declining nodelist and
     the reasons for sysop disenchantment could have been
     addressed and perhaps remedied. Unfortunately, we are now to
     be "led" by Satti whose imagination appears limited to the
     non-responsive, monosyllabic grunts which have become his
     means of communication in the Z1C echo. It was probably too
     much to hope for that the ZCs would at least spend some
     FIDONEWS 15-15               Page 8                   13 Apr 1998


     effort on the future of Fidonet rather than entrenching
     another elflord who will replace insight with an orison that
     he is bound by policy.

     Since humility was never one of my vices, I'd like to
     suggest that one of the most pressing problems confounding
     Fidonet is the quality of messages that are entered. How can
     we ever hope to compete with the eye-candy of Internet when
     we are creating vistas of sludge in our echos with their
     antfarm collections of quotes and emoticons sandwiched
     between words that rarely resemble full sentences or
     sentient thought. Does no one have any pride in what they
     write? Does no one possess the skills to write a cogent
     thought in a coherent fashion? Will someone please tell me
     that Forrest Gump hasn't been cloned and set loose on
     thousands of computers?


     At this juncture I would like to include the full text of
     two messages that I sent to Zorch Frezberg. As the
     Snoozlord, I'm sure that he will have the first and last
     word on the issue but I feel that the entirety of my
     messages should be reproduced.


     "To: Zorch Frezberg
     Subject: Zorched earth policy?

     If you read FIDOECHOPOL you might notice that after I raised
     my initial  concerns, I stopped posting in that echo because
     I didn't have anything more  to say. Incredibly, I agree
     that arguing over a "blank page" is futile other  than
     advancing the first belief that the page should remain
     blank.

     I do have a genuine concern about Fidonet. I also realize
     that it is  relatively easy for you to discount what I say
     by trivializing it as "rabble  rousing" for the hell of it.
     I guess it depends on which side of the wall you  happen to
     be on when the arrows start flying.

     I was as vociferous about the various OBO, NAB, BOFAQ
     "policy" initiatives as  I am about the current infestation
     of policymongers. When the ZEC tried to  take echomail out
     from *C control, I saved my wit and worked to establish
     alternative routing to do an end run around the bastards.

     I don't agree with removing the Tom Jennings trademarks but
     I see the issue  as meaningless anyway. Tom is the only one
     who could assert claims to those  trademarks and he has
     publicly declared that he doesn't intend to do so,  other
     than speaking up to preclude someone else from claiming that
     right. You  are wrong, by the way, about "violating
     international treaties and accords."  Since my legal weasel
     was already inclined to rack up billable hours on my
     behalf, I had her research the issue. The Berne Convention
     FIDONEWS 15-15               Page 9                   13 Apr 1998


     applies *if*  trademarks are registered in the applicable
     countries. The convention merely  prevents someone else from
     registering his trademarks in Germany, but until  Jennings
     *does* register them, they have no effect and - read closely
     here -  falsely asserting a trademark in Germany (or Canada,
     or England, and perhaps  others) is illegal.

     I am dismayed that Fidonet has been partially usurped by
     commercial entities,  but since there are a number of them,
     monopoly control hasn't happened. In  fact, with FTP
     connections, the limited *potential* for control has been
     diminished substantially.

     You mischaracterize my motives when you say that my actions
     indicate "an  effort to cause destructive chaos." Anarchism
     doesn't mean chaos. Perhaps you  and I disagree on our
     levels of optimism. You apparently subscribe to Burke's
     theory of governance where the "swinish mob" shouldn't be
     trusted with their  own choices, whereas I subscribe to
     Paine's notion that choice is an  inalienable right. (The
     Constitutions of your country and mine tend to  enshrine the
     rights of which I speak.)

     I see the process of establishing accountability of *Cs as
     constructive. As  far as I know, I'm only "acting in
     concert" with people because they share  the same goals. My
     only *power* is one of suasion, whereas the *Cs who are
     balking at accountability are armed with their presumptive
     powers to control  the nodelist. As a small footnote, I am
     occasionally more embarrassed by the  people who agree with
     me, than those who oppose me...but anyone who accepts
     democracy or anarchism acknowledges the right of others to
     say what they  please. On that same note, you might also
     have noticed that I have been very  quick to chastise those
     cretins who would join a lynch mob to remove you as  the
     Snoozlord.

     Your point is well taken that there may be a majority of
     sysops who are happy  with the status quo. I don't presume
     to speak for them, but I do seek to  *persuade* them. In
     almost all cases, I could blithely ignore the *Cs because
     their influence on my enjoyment of the hobby is minimal. My
     recent emergence  from somnolence has *everything* to do
     with the fact that the ZC was musing  about nuking our
     entire net from the nodelist over the childish antics of a
     few sysops. It occurred to me that if the *Cs were prepared
     to be that  Draconian in their response, then perhaps it was
     time to disarm the *Cs so  that their lack of wisdom
     wouldn't be inflicted on me.

     In truth I don't know if Dossche is a wolf in sheep's
     clothing because my  only evidence is reading a few
     messages. What I *do* know is that you and a  few others
     have consistently mischaracterized his position, and resort
     to  vile insults, which leads me to conclude that he
     represents more promise than  his detractors. You seem to
     FIDONEWS 15-15               Page 10                  13 Apr 1998


     see "control" devolving to Europe, as though the  sysops
     there represent some sort of block. I see "control"
     devolving to  sysops and it matters little to me where they
     live. One of the promises of  Fidonet was that it would
     create a community of sysops who lived all over the  planet.

     To: Zorch Frezberg
     Subject: brimstone and sulfur

     I think as a first premise in our discussion we should agree
     that neither of  us represent a lumpen group for whose
     actions we're personally responsible.  What the rest of
     net163 chooses to do is beyond my control, and also beyond
     my desire to control. Similarly, it wouldn't be appropriate
     to include Reg10  sysops as something for which you are
     responsible. As a matter of record,  there are a great many
     things that net163 sysops do or have done that I don't
     agree with but I adamantly defend their right to do as they
     choose.

     On ECHPOLOL: You haven't answered a very simple question
     which is: what  problems will be solved by the creation of
     more policy? Until you do that,  common sense seems to
     indicate that you're riding a headless horse which  *may*
     produce a happy result but the odds are against it. I've
     read your  posts, including the one which appeared today,
     and you seem to begin with an  a priori assumption that a
     document is required. I remain unconvinced, and as  I said,
     I'm not posting in the echo because I have nothing
     substantive to say  on that issue.

     You said "You *have* a wall to hide behind." Which wall
     would that be?

     You also said that don't have friends to hide behind. I
     agree with you there  and I don't recall ever asserting
     otherwise.

     I'm not sure it would be illuminative to trade war stories
     about which people  we've respectively *battled* over the
     history of Fidonet, but on the issue of  the OBO/ NAB/
     BOFAQ, you merely have to read back issues of the Snooz to
     obtain my opinions that were expressed at the time. (One in
     particular,  titled "Who *are* those guys?" might help you.)

     If you could quote me the relevant section of the WIPO
     treaty I would be  pleased to tell my lawyer that she has
     given me incorrect advice. My message  did indicate that the
     trademark copyright problem occurs in Germany so  perhaps
     they aren't yet signatories?

     John Souvestre *controls* echomail only to the extent that
     people choose to  use his services for routing. For a good
     part of 1995 I was sending the whole  Backbone direct to
     Montana so that they wouldn't have to contend with a local
     despot. I sent a good chunk of the backbone to Vienna on my
     FIDONEWS 15-15               Page 11                  13 Apr 1998


     dime in the early  90's for exactly the same reasons. If
     either you or I felt that any of the  echomail relays were
     misbehaving, it would be a trivial exercise to pick up  the
     entire backbone via Internet connections.

     I would guess that your private netmail from Dossche is more
     "threatening"  than his public messages. Even the snippets
     that you posted in FIDONEWS don't  support your assertion
     that he was filing a policy complaint. Just so's you  know,
     the characterizations of Dossche as being some sort of
     fascist aren't  born out by his public messages. You don't
     understand the meaning of the word  if you believe that
     exercising his mandate from his Zone, with their specific
     approval on the IC issue, constitutes any sort of totalism.

     We can trade invective all day about whether my admiration
     for anarchy is  "destructive" or "constructive." I think
     what we need are specifics in terms  of what you think it
     will destroy and then perhaps I can respond by  estimating
     whether the loss is a good or bad thing. To start off, I
     think  that it will create cooperation out of necessity.

     I don't recall accusing someone of molesting animals or
     children or was your  reference to those issues some sort of
     Straw Man that was meant to subdue my  arguments?

     I admit that I am given to hyperbole and a belittling tone
     in a number of my  messages. I don't suffer fools gladly and
     I'm not shy about telling people  that. If you can give me
     an example of something that I have  "mischaracterized"
     about you, then I'd be happy to correct it.

     I don't apologize for my education nor for using knowledge
     in my messages. I  don't feel inclined to "dumb down" my
     discourse for a presumed lowest common  denominator. Your
     "Whoopee do" paragraph was what? Faint praise? Jealousy?
     Gawd knows what it was. We both agree that Paine believed in
     choice as an  inalienable right to the extent that your
     rights didn't intrude on mine. Can  you point out where I've
     said otherwise?

     You should read the Snooz more often, but the quote from
     Paine speaks  specifically to the issue of "governance" and
     where "governance" obtains its  legitimacy. I suggest you
     read the whole book by Paine because he has a great  deal to
     say about whether "governance" is grandfathered upon future
     generations simply because one generation formed a compact
     to be governed.

     No, your choice of two public posts does not prove that
     Dossche believes in  the suppression of free speech. You
     also ought to read his message in the Z1C  echo where he
     also took pains to explain that his concerns should be
     addressed but not be the cause for excommunication. I
     believe in free speech -  specifically your right to use
     value-laden language likening Dossche to a  Nazi regime. I
     FIDONEWS 15-15               Page 12                  13 Apr 1998


     also believe that your use of such terms is vile, just as I
     believe that using the "n" word to describe blacks or the
     "k" word to  describe Jews; are vile. Your value system
     differs from mine, which is fine,  and I would also defend
     your right to say those things while maintaining my  right
     to tell you that the words are despicable.

     On the matter of my naivete about Dossche. When his posts
     started showing up  they looked reasonable. I netmailed ten
     sysops (more or less randomly chosen)  in his Zone and asked
     questions. I got 8 responses, all of which were  positive. I
     netmailed Dossche directly and got answers to my questions.
     On  that basis, I ascertained that his platform was worthy
     of support. What more  could I do to educate myself? Now,
     contrast that with my experiences with  Satti who rarely
     answers a question in a straightforward manner and has no
     substance to his platform and no mandate to advance what
     little he offers.

     I find it exceptionally difficult to believe that you would
     feel intimidated  by anything let alone a presumed threat of
     a policy complaint. I don't know  what its like on your end
     of the political spectrum but I count it as a slow  week if
     my Snooz articles don't generate at least a couple of policy
     complaint threats and the odd threat of personal injury.
     Hell, socially  maladroit people have been known to threaten
     policy complaints over the  mailer where a message
     originated (cough).

     I don't claim to *represent* the "common man." I represent
     an idea which I  hope will be appealing and I fully expect
     other sysops to act according to  their beliefs. It bears
     repeating that the only tool in my arsenal is one of
     persuasion - I'm a <RETURN> key away from being powerless.
     The idea that I support is the one that founded Fidonet and
     worked very well  for Fidonet until the first infestation of
     policymongers.

     I've often joked about the fact that you and I are similar
     in temperament but  just happen to live on opposite poles of
     the political spectrum. My ideal  version of Fidonet
     suggests that there is not only room for both of us, but
     that we both have the freedom to express our opinions. Where
     we essentially  disagree is in the extent to which we are
     willing to give up freedom to  either "policy" or *Cs. When
     I joined Fidonet, there was no requirement to  give up
     freedoms to either of those "authorities" and I'd like to
     see Fidonet  returned to that condition.

     I'll grant that the current crop of elflords are pissants
     compared to the  totalist ambitions of Dodell or Kashuba in
     the past, but they still haven't  seemed to grasp what role
     they ought to have in Fidonet.

     This whole discussion has centered around form in Fidonet as
     opposed to  substance. I believe that the most significant
     FIDONEWS 15-15               Page 13                  13 Apr 1998


     issue to be faced by Fidonet  is the content and style of
     messages. (Just so you don't get alarmed, I am  adamantly
     opposed to any sort of compunction with respect to content
     or  style.) The echomail that is moved, and the political
     landscape through which  it flows are trivial compared to
     examining *what* is being moved.

     I don't know if it has occurred to you that you are a rarity
     in Fidoland. You  write in whole sentences (most of the
     time,) you engage subjects with a  certain amount of
     thought, and you obviously devote energy to what you write.
     Contrast your writings with much of what fills echomail
     conferences. The poor  moderators who might have been
     educators have been reduced to kindergarten  teachers
     adjudicating petty squabbles. Place any 100 messages from an
     echo in  front of the average literate person and explain
     that it represents the best  and the brightest of
     International discourse on the echomail topic... and  then
     try to figure out why sysops are leaving in droves and why
     users avoid  Fidonet like the plague. The answer will be
     self-evident in those 100  messages with their screenfuls of
     quotes, their trophalactic grunts, their  emoticons, and
     their general level of utter gibberish.

     If I had to saddle up Pedro and tilt at a significant
     windmill, it would be  on the issue of convincing sysops and
     users to raise their levels of  communication beyond the
     dreck which gets posted now. Perhaps, on this issue  we
     might happily find ourselves on the same side of the fence?"
       /   /      /     /

     I must go, Visage. The El Nino current has washed
     video-cassettes of Gerry Springer shows onto the beach. Your
     secretary has taken up fisticuffs and is pummeling the
     filing cabinet. I fear that if we don't distract her, the
     contents of the cabinet - which is some of the finest Scotch
     - may be disturbed in their slumber. As the good and decent
     people that we are, we should send her immediately to Moose
     Meadow, Saskatchewan.
