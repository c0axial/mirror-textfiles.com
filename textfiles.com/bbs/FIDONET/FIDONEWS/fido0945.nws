Editorial: wartime blues

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

I just got home from a four and a half hour drive. It's late, I'm
tired and cranky. I peek in my inbound directory, and see what's new
for this week's snooze. Surprise.

Zone wars are soooo tired. They're really personality wars, held in
public, at our collective expense, and seemingly unnoticed to the
participants, to their own collective embarrassment. Especially for
the repeat offenders.

OK, here we go again. Boy oh boy, am I glad I worked at this problem
earlier. To quote ARTSPEC.DOC:


  -----------------------
  RESOLVING CONTROVERSIES: (v3)

  Occasionally FidoNews is presented with a dilemma: a "controversial"
  article generates a seemingly endless series of responses, commentary,
  rebuttals, etc, and threatens to overwhelm FidoNews. How to stop the
  stop the flood without violating the editorial policy? Here is the
  somewhat complex solution:

  If a particular article generates a cascade of responses, the editor
  does two things: (1) chooses one or few of them as representative; (2)
  passes them on to the original author, who is asked to write a
  response within 2 weeks. The resulting representative response(s), and
  the original authors response, are run in the next possible FidoNews
  -- ONCE ONLY.  Interested parties can then pick up the torch and march
  with it off the long or short pier of their choice.

All parties in the Z4 wars are hereby on notice.

Hollywood, CA, USA


There we go, again... <sigh>
----------------------------

Fight-o-News! Fight-o-News! Will we ever change? Once again, I am
the target of flames. This time, of a 7 or 8-page-long article with
too many flames and very few -i.e. zero- truths.

I was expecting a desperate move like this from Clovis Lacerda,
after all his political ploys failed one after the other. The
situation here is simple: Clovis Lacerda wants to be Zone
Coordinator. He has more or less effectively manipulated his region
to assure this, but not the other regions. They won't vote for him,
it seems, and he's grown more and more desperate with time.

Clovis has been systematically attacking every person that in
reality or in his imagination disagrees with him. This way, he has
offended and ridiculed most of the rest of his zone, as well as the
few people inside his region who dared to disagree with him. How
would any sober mind vote for him now?

Charles Hirakawa Miranda, founder of FidoNet in Brazil, the RC who
allowed Clovis to succeed him, and one of the more honest and
generous persons I've ever met through this thing, has been branded
things like "traitor," "electronic Judas," and "dirty Jap" by
Lacerda, who's been trying hard and long to curb all kinds of
possible criticism by means of populist -political- rhetoric,
propaganda -loads of it- and ultimately intimidation (threats of
excommunication).

Sergio Creimer, a relatively new sysop there, was naive enough to
use the standard routing -i.e. all national/international LD mail
goes through Lacerda's node, you guess why...- for a message in
which he criticized his RC. Creimer was humiliated and ridiculed in
public by a Lacerda who stated that routed mail becomes property of
the node routing it while it's sitting there.

I really can't get into replying to the full eight pages of flames:
I haven't the time or the will to do it. However, some important
points deserve to be clarified, and that is what I will get into.

1) Uruguay:

FidoNews 9-45                  Page 3                       9 Nov 1992


Hector Gomez -an Uruguayan sysop in Argentina- and I worked to get
Uruguay into FidoNet. Juan Camps, Hector's cousin in the Uruguayan
capital, installed the first node with sponsorship from a large
computer distributor there. Time later, Juan had to go offline, and
his region, still in diapers, more or less died. When Gamey Garcia
took over as ZC, he tried to contact them. So did I, and a coupla
sysops in Argentina, without success. Uruguay was then erased from
the list.

After reading Clovis' comments of them still being "alive," I got
in touch with Juan Carlos Alonso, who said that he's getting his
mail from Randy Bush. Alonso never tried to contact the ZC, and
those that knew of his existence didn't help him do it or tell him
to do it; they didn't inform anyone else in Zone 4 either, so no
communication was possible. Result: Uruguay will probably be back
in the nodelist, thanks to myself and a few others in Buenos Aires
who took the time to help them get back in touch with the world.

What Clovis said is a lie: the Uruguayans never had a chance to
vote for ZC or anything because they were then offline. Nobody
kicked them out, they did it themselves!

2) One-sysop, One-vote:

It is not true that the candidate from the region with the most
sysops will end up carrying the election in all cases. Actually,
this wasn't true until Lacerda started sowing hatred throughout his
region. When Clovis Lacerda ran against Gustavo Zacarias, there was
at least one vote from Gustavo's region that went to Clovis as far
as I know, though no votes from Clovis' region -Clovis always
presents himself as his region's "official candidate"- went to
Gustavo.

I know sysops all over Zone 4 and I rarely noticed any objections
in them to having a ZC in another region. The country problem
started when Clovis and his gang started bashing the Argies on
their regional echomail conference, reviving century-old prejudices
at a time in which both countries are integrating their economies,
their governments and militaries share all kinds of secrets and act
more or less combined in foreign affairs.

And as we talk about Clovis' gang -known in Rio as the "Xiitas,"
Portuguese for "Shiites," because of their fanaticism-, the
reference I made to the people of Brazil's northeast -where almost
all of Clovis' support is- was very much distorted by Clovis. It
had absolutely no racial content -there is no chance of it since
it's not ethnically very different from the rest of Brazil- but
referred to the popularly-known Northeastern xenophobia and
nationalism. I have family and friends in Brazil, I know about
Brazil's internal conflicts and I speak the language. I'm a "civil
rights liberal" who couldn't possibly advocate a racist point of
view, which is indeed all product of Clovis' imagination and
opportunism.

FidoNews 9-45                  Page 4                       9 Nov 1992


3) Half-known facts and the imagined other half:

Did I ever say Bill Bolton made any racist comments to me? No way!
The only episode I made reference to was that of Ray Chalmers -
Bill's successor as Z3C- calling me a Nazi in South America because
I have a German -yet Jewish- last name. That was it.

Were the election mechanisms in violation to Policy4? No way! It
always asked that the person with the Policy4-given right to name
whomever would occupy the position in discussion authorized a
technically non-binding election and then formally appoint the
winner. This was agreed by all the RCs in each ZC election, and by
the ZC in each RC election.

Did I ever promise a zone policy before an umbrella policy was
approved? No way! It seems that Clovis waited for something that
was never intended in the first place. The same with term
limitations: it was never discussed, so how can he say there is
something wrong going unless he's imagined the whole idea?

Clovis once told his region's sysops that here in Zone 1 each node
is financially supported by a corporation, which could only be a
wrong deduction or an outright lie. Of course, he's now creating a
corporation that will run another FidoNet-technology network and
charge its member-nodes a fee to cover connection expenses.
Although he has not made membership to this new net mandatory,
international FidoNet traffic will be carried by this net and will
only be available to paying members.

Clovis has also said that he was technically prevented from being
in touch with the rest of the zone, when he had actually told his
region that he didn't want to do it -which is the message that I
translated and posted, in which he also verbally insults the ZC and
the rest of the zone as a whole in their backs.

The pinnacle of all this nonsense is the suggestion that I'm in
actual "control" of the Zone Coordinator and Region Coordinators in
Zone 4. He's called me "PC Farias California-style," in reference
to Paulo-Cesar Farias, the recently-impeached president's top fund
raiser, head of Brazil's largest corruption scandal and currently
Brazil's #1 public enemy. Give me a f___ing break!!! The only
things I've done in relation to Zone 4 coordinators since I
resigned as ZC are to answer some general FidoNet-related questions
they posed, to help a couple out with MakeNL and to act as
voluntary routing point for some of their netmail.

I'm sick and tired of all this crap. I am not willing to take more.
I've poured thousands of hours and thousands of dollars into
FidoNet because when it all started back in 87, I dreamed of seeing
the whole of Latin America online and integrated. But I have not
ever lied or played "dirty tricks" like he suggests. Clovis Lacerda
has gone beyond all acceptable limits with his attacks, and I will
proceed to file a policy complaint against him -I sent him netmail
giving him a chance to apologize and forget about this but he blew
it. For once, I'm taking this seriously: I might be familiar with
politics, but I'm even more familiar with telling the truth. I

value my name and won't let every other jerk out there defame me
and get away with it.

Dear Members of FidoNet:

   Through this text I would like to express my rejection and that
of the members of my region (R90, Argentina) about Mr. Clovis
Lacerda's the malicious and tendentious statements on his article
in this week's FidoNews.
   His article is a manifest analysis of the fanaticism, politics
and oppression with which he's been loading and leading his region
during all these months.
   Let's go directly to confront his crooked charges:

   He says that when ZC elections were prepared, the results were
known in advance because there was a majority of nodes in Argentina
(in R90), which would leave no chances to his candidacy to the
position.
   Reality is very different from that: one node one vote means
that each node can vote for any candidate and not exclusively a
candidate from his region.

   He says that Mr. Pablo Kleinman kicked the Uruguayans (ex-R85)
out of FidoNet and it is not true!! I personally verified that the
RC85's number had no mailer answering the phone for several months;
moreover, the absence of region 85 in terms of net and echomail was
complete during all that period of voluntary disconnection. That
information was given to the current ZC4 for him to analyze and
decide what to do.

   He also said that Mr. Pablo Kleinman made reference (to the
Brazilians) as "ignorant because of their poverty"; false again.
Mr. Kleinman declared in a message on LATIN.SYSOP that the areas of
Northeastern Brazil were guilty of an "inferiority complex" because
the majority of the nodes there were attacking the neighbors to the
south (us), and that's it.

   It is evident that Mr. Lacerda misinterprets to his own interest
the facts, and accommodates them to his own needs to promote
disunion between his country (region) and the rest of Zone 4.
   In an opportunity, Mr. Lacerda threatened in the name of his
region (the whole region, according to him) to leave Zone 4 and
form another one if the zone does not comply with his requests,
requests that only him says were pre-established. He has fed the
Brazilian sysops with lies to make them believe he is telling the
truth" Mr. Lacerda "deduced" that in this zone we had fixed periods
for elections every year, knowing beforehand that there was nothing
written or discussed about term limitations. He used this as an
excuse to subsequently begin attacking the sysops in my region and
to call them "authoritarian" when the only authoritarian here is
FidoNews 9-45                  Page 6                       9 Nov 1992


himself.

   This is all the sad, pure and exclusive truth that any other
sysop in the zone that had access to more sources of information
than just Clovis will be able to attest.
   I'm not seeking any type of recognition by stepping into this
discussion now: my term as RC90 is coming to an end, to give way to
another one, with a new RC (whom, by the way, is now being chosen
by direct vote of all of R90's sysops). I am writing this article
only because I consider that Mr. Clovis Lacerda has taken the wrong
path, in an improper and erroneous manner, for an RC who had to
have the priority of promoting unity and communication between his
region and the rest of us around them, instead of pursuing his very
own political agenda.

   The nodes in region 80 will have to reconsider who they wish to
have as representative as it is now more than obvious that in the
view of other regions, their RC is incapable of doing that
appropriately and is technically, as reflected in the periodicity
of the nodelist updates, a very bad RC.

In reply to:
Zone 4 -The sound of the whistle, originally by Clovis Lacerda

by jordi murgo 2:343/401
Lleida, Catalonia (Spain)

Dear SysOps,

I just have read the long article which Clovis Lacerda 4:80/0
wrote on fidonews # 9-44 about Pablo Kleinman former ZC4 now
just 1:102/631. after reading every single word I would really
like to open another point of view on that matter, of course I
am not here to say if Clovis is right or not, as I say just to
state another point of view.

"in every realationship there are always a victim and an
executioner, it seems like the victim here is Clovis who has
been seriously offended by the executioner Pablo". I had the
chance to personally meet Pablo Kleinman here in Spain at home
this summer, he was not very much time here however this time
was quite enough to start something which I consider a good
friendship. in despite we disagree in the past on several fidonet
related matters, we talked quite a lot about zone 4 and I think
that every fidonet SysOp have the right to know about another
version of the facts. I sincerely cannot believe most of Clovis
Lacerda says in his article about Pablo, BTW. I believe that
certain psychotic problem arise on someone's head. if not what
kind of man can keep track of every movement done by someone
else with the only purpose to attack him later? perhaps it is
admiration? who knows.
FidoNews 9-45                  Page 7                       9 Nov 1992


I think I know enough about that matter to certify that all what
I can see is clear manipulation to manage a political purpose,
the thoughts of Clovis IMHO are reduced to:

"since SysOps of one country will vote to SysOps from the
country even being against P4, I am going to promote fidonet in
here giving a node number to everyone around me in order maths
do not fail this time and next one without any doubt *I* will be
proclamed ZC4 and I will destroy `Dictatorship' established by my
predecesors to save all my fellows SysOps. I know it is not very
policy 4 compliant, but since it fills my needs it is fine, thus
this way to apply democracy will not be ludicrous as it was when
Pablo did it"

It is clear that what Clovis want is to become ZC4, and it seems
that Pablo is being an obstacle to him, I cannot understand how
but Clovis seems to feel that way.

Why Clovis accused Pablo to remove from nodelist all Uruguay
region if it is not true? since I see Clovis is not very well
informed, I will explain that Uruguayan SysOps one day simply
stopped to do their Job properly and after several weeks of
failure to communicate they were removed from Nodelist. BTW,
Uruguay was formed by one Pvt system and just two SysOps. the
reasons they are not in Z4? I think that ZC4 will be able to
inform better than me on that matter.

Resuming: I would like to bring all my support to Pablo
Kleinman. don't leave words like those from Clovis discourage
you, it's easy understand that it is what Clovis look for
attacking you on that way, and if there is also quite clear for
everybody is that the way Clovis play his Campaign was not very
clear, all his comments are based on just hearsay, and
fortunately it is not good enogh to convince all of us.

Please Pablo keep working on WorldPol, if there is something
sure in FidoNet right now, is that we need newer rules than
obsolete P4.

BBS-TNC.LZH is a Door program which will allow the User <hack spit!> to
call in on the MODEM and access the BBS systems Terminal Node Controller
which is on a different serial port than the BBS. This is typically
done on a FidoNet system which is Ham Radio related and who's SysOp is a
licensed HAM willing to allow Third Party Access to the HAM Radio Packet
environment from his or her FidoNet system.

FidoNews 9-45                  Page 8                       9 Nov 1992


Alternately, if the SysOp would wish to connect to the packet environment
from a remote location through a MODEM, not allowing Users <hack spit!>
to access the TNC, the SysOp could either apply a security level to the
access of the Door or may employ the application of the BBS-TNC programs
password facility.

The way it works:

Upon invocation, BBS-TNC reviews the configuration file which specifies
whether a password is required to run the program or not and whether a
HAM Radio Call Sign should be requested from the User <hack spit!>

The program will ask for a password if required and then ask for a Call
Sign if required. If access is granted, the program will configure the
TNC with the Call Sign if it was required and it will also configure the
TNS's ALIAS name to what's specified in the configuration file if the
SysOp so desires.

The TNC is checked to see if there is power applied at all times. The BBS
is checked to make sure that there is carrier present at all times. The
local keyboard maintains full control of both the BBS and the TNC, allowing
complete control of the interface and the User <hack spit!> activities.

The program uses a FOSSIL driver of your choice (not provided with the
distribution file) so that buffering is performed, allowing uploads to
be performed (within reason. Recall that your TNC is probably 1200 baud.)

If there is no activity on either the BBS or TNC after 4 minutes, the
program will exit and control will resume with the BBS.

The program:

As usual, the source code is provided so that if you wish to make any
changes to the project you have the original source. A Turbo C MakeFile
and Response File is provided as is a sample configuration file.

The Exclude project now supports RA/QBBS message base systems and will
be supporting Squish type message bases within a few months. This
project scans through selected *.MSG EchoMail sub-directories or
through selected RA/QBBS Message Folders looking for messages to
either erase or MOVE to another sub-directory (for *.MSG type systems)
or to another message Folder (for RA/QBBS type systems.)

It will erase or move messages from individuals, to individuals, and
from systems, depending upon the configuration file you create/modify.
It has the ability to scan through the nodelist for specified keywords
within the names of FidoNet systems and for specified nodelist Flags,
compiling a list of system from which network mail should be erase or
moved. (This is a feature which can be ignored entirely.)
FidoNews 9-45                  Page 9                       9 Nov 1992


[There are more features which would be too lengthy to delve into
now.]

The project is offered to automatically remove posts both from and to
individuals within EchoMail conferences and to reject inbound network
mail from individuals by either erasing it without ever having to be
looked at or by moving it to another directory for the creation of
automatic archives of hostile messages you wish to keep.

Moderators and various gateways will find this project useful for
extracting and/or erase of messages from individuals who have been
ejected from the conferences they moderate or gate. Since ejected
individuals typically draw messages long after they have been
'deleted' from reality, the Exclude project can also erase messages to
ejected individuals.

Since some systems maintain a *.MSG message base as well as an RA/QBBS
message base, Exclude will now accept a command-line argument which
bypasses the 'FORMAT' command in the configuration file, allowing
Exclude to be executed twice after inbound mail is tossed; once for
*.MSG and once for RA/QBBS.

Exclude version 3.1 is available from 1:102/890.0 as EXCLUDE3.LZH and
is 42K in size. As usual, it comes with the source code as well as
documentation and a Turbo C MakeFile.

Fredric.
