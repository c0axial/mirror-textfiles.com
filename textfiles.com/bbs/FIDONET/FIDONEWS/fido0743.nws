     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================


     As we approach All Hallow's Eve, some funny gremlins seem to
     have already appeared in this general vicinity. Some of them
     ate my netmail and a couple of days of files (I don't even
     know what they were). If you sent something in this week and
     you don't see it here, please send it again -- I lost it.

     My faith in humanity is finally proven in this week's issue.
     Someone actually figured out what the IMPORTANT point of that
     abortion article happened to be! Folks, it had nothing to do
     with abortion. It was about extremists in positions of power
     in this country -- and what they'll stoop to in order to inflict
     their views on you. Damned important reading in ANY forum.

     So much for my political views. They only reinforced my basic
     inclination to publish the article. I had no good reason NOT
     to. I've published articles that were a hell of a lot more
     inane and had even LESS to do with FidoNet. That's what you get
     when you have your very own electronic cork board. You get
     something damned close to pure entropy.

     Ah, yes. ENTROPY. Perhaps Congress should form a committee to
     study ways of keeping it under Governmental control. Perhaps
     it's too dangerous to be allowed out there in the public domain.

     Well, I don't think so. If you send me something (and if I don't
     pull some stupid stunt and lose it) I'll print it, unless it
     appears to be in violation of some law to do so. Fortunately I
     haven't had to make that call very often. You all are sensible
     enough to handle that on your own. I appreciate your discretion.

     Two of this week's articles make the point that an open
     editorial policy is the only way to run FidoNews. I couldn't
     agree more. In a world where one man's trash is another man's
     treasure, I can't imagine a formal policy that would not
     result in a net loss for all of us. As long as I have anything
     to do with it, there will be no such policy.

     Thanks for listening.

                       DESQview File Support Network

     DVNet is one of the older specialized file distribution
     networks in Fidonet. When Quarterdeck Office Systems[QOS]
     released QEMM the expanded memory manager and DESQview 2.0,
     alot of Sysops discovered the joy of multitasking their BBS
     systems. Users began clamoring for programs written to run
     under the new environment.

     The popularity of DESQview has continued to grow and DVNet
     was started to fill a void in getting software spread to as
     wide as audience as possible and to offer a published
     listing of where to obtain it. DVNet nodes exist in Zones 1,
     2 and 3 thanks to the interest and support of sysops around
     the world.

     A complete listing of the member BBS's is published on the
     4th of every month in the DESQview echo. A complete listing
     of the files, or alternatively, files added during the
     previous 30 days is also published.

     Unlike SDS or SDN, sysops in DVNet are free to use whatever
     storage format they prefer. When requesting a file from a
     DVNet node, a wild card should be used for the extension.

     DVNet supports the magic file name DVNET for each member
     node's DVNet file area list. You may also request the
     listing using the convention  net-node.DV ... 124-6101.DV

     The importance of DVNet to DESQview users was hi-lighted
     recently in a feature article written for the California
     based computer newspaper MicroTimes. The article introduced
     readers to DVNet as an excellent resource for information
     and software.

     Sysops interested in joining DVNet should obtain DVN-INF.*
     from any member node. This archive contains operational
     policies, set-up information and an application.

     DVNet is not affiliated with Quarterdeck Office Systems.
     DESQview & QEMM are registered trademarks of QOS.

     This is the listing of member nodes as of Oct 17, 1990

               Totalitarianism For Fun And The Prophets




         Well,  first  off  we get the excellent article by Steve
     Watsky  in  the  7-40  issue of FidoNews. While I was mildly
     surprised  to  see  an  article  concerning the reproductive
     rights  issue in this media, I applaud the editor's decision
     to  include  it here. After carefully reading the article, I
     sat  back,  held  my breath (as it were), and waited for the
     fecal matter to hit the air vent.

         Mercifully, things didn't turn out that badly.

         The  first  chunk of waste matter wasn't as vitriolic as
     I  was  expecting.  I  had  expected  to  see  rants  by the
     anti-choice  gallery objecting to the comic, acerbic wit the
     author  used  to  portray  the  "pro-life"  fraction.  I had
     expected  the  pro-choice  gallery  to leap to the cause and
     elaborate zealously the need for legal, SAFE abortion.

         Instead,  I was somewhat pleasantly surprised to see, in
     issue  7-42,  only  (so  far?)  the  question put by Fredric
     Rice, "Do we need this crap in FidoNews?"

         My answer is, "Well, uh, yes."

         First  it  should  be pointed out that ALL communication
     is  political  and  manipulative  to  some  degree,  and  to
     believe  that  FidoNews should not be, or even CAN be, isn't
     very   realistic.   Granted  some  articles  are  much  more
     political   than  others  (SEA  vs  PK,  Ecology  And  Green
     Politics  vs  Industry,  ARC  vs  LZH,  and now Reproductive
     Freedom  vs Totalitarianism Terrorists), FidoNews still is A
     Good  Thing,  and at present I for one see no requirement to
     change it.

         Second,  what  the  editor  says, goes. Any editor is in
     some  sense  a  dictator, benign or malevolent, depending on
     how  close  the deadline is, and how much vodka is in her or
     his  blood  stream--- in simple words: Don't like it? Sorry,
     don't  bother  reading  FidoNews then. The current editorial
     policy works.

     FidoNews 7-43                Page 8                   22 Oct 1990


         Third  is The Exceptions. The last thing we, presumably,
     wish  to  see  in FidoNews is a dozen PACs (Political Action
     Committees)   hashing   out  grievances,  exchanging  rants.
     Mercifully,  that  hasn't happened yet. I consider it highly
     doubtful  it will be allowed (let's hope?). If this happens,
     I  won't  request  or demand a change of policy--- I'll just
     stop reading FidoNews.

         That's  my  opinion.  Thank current policy I was allowed
     to express it here.

         As  to  the  REAL (?) question involved, was the article
     under debate appropriate for this media?

         You bet! (Duck--- here comes that rant I promised.)

         Watsky's   article   provided  a  brief  window  on  the
     reproductive  rights  issue that many seldom look into-- the
     window  that  shows  how  the  legislative  process has been
     perverted  and  subverted  by  special  interest groups, (in
     this  case  religious extremists, The Faithful, and the Well
     Intentioned   on   the   anti-choice  terrorists  side,  the
     Feminist  extremists  and  Well  Informed  on the pro-choice
     reproductive  freedom  side). Pull a string here, throw some
     mud  there, punch a face in now and then. . . all on network
     news.

         That's entertainment!

         It should also make you damn mad.

         At  this  very  minute there are special interest groups
     lobbying  and raising money for the right to force YOUR kids
     to  pray  in  school  (The  Right, Honorable Jesse Helms for
     one.  The  god  he  most prefers happens to be Jehovah). How
     about  if  I  dictate  which  idol  your  child  worships in
     school?

         Special  interest  groups  are  fighting "sex education"
     (i.e.  information  on  the  mechanics  of  fornication) and
     birth  control. "If you don't talk about it, they won't know
     anything  about  it and therefore won't do it." the argument
     goes. Oh, really?

         And  of  course,  abortion.  The anti-choice demand that
     every  zygote  and  foetus  must  be  carried  to full term,
     wanted  or  not,  healthy  or  not.  (And after birth, food,
     clothing,  shelter, and loving care are all optional, as far
     as  they  are  concerned.)  "Make it illegal, and it will go
     away." the argument goes. Oh, really? Consider:

     FidoNews 7-43                Page 9                   22 Oct 1990


            "Estimates  of the annual number of deaths due
            to  abortion  complications range from 155,000
            to  204,000  women worldwide. Abortion related
            deaths  are  especially  common among poor and
            illiterate  women  living  in  countries  with
            strict   abortion  laws.  In  Latin  American,
            where  legal  abortion is generally restricted
            to  cases  of  rape  or  endangerment  of  the
            woman's  life,  up  to half of material deaths
            appear to be due to illegal abortions."

            "State  of  the  World,  1988",  A  Worldwatch
            Institute Report.


         Cults  dictate  policy  in  YOUR  legislature. Certainly
     something  worth  reading about, and perhaps doing something
     about.

     By Randy Edwards
     Sysop: Socialism OnLine!, 1:141/552

          I read with interest Frederic Rice's article in FidoNews
     7-42 about whether we should or should not print everything in
     the FidoNews.  As Frederic pointed out, it's an old debate.

          It's true, the article in question, one long article about
     someone's views on abortion, was not remotely related to BBSing,
     the FidoNet, or even computers in general.  Myself, I didn't
     read it until I read Frederic's article.  Personally I am
     pro-choice, as it seems the majority of the U.S. population
     is, and therefore I disagreed with most everything the
     article tried to point out.  In my opinion, I don't want to
     read about abortion in the FidoNews, after all, I get enough
     of that anti-choice crap from Republican politicians and from
     far-right religious groups.  But that's beside the point.

          The main point here is whether we should change the
     time-honored editorial policy of the FidoNews from a "you write
     it and I'll print it" basis to one of "you write it and I'll
     think about printing it."

         I have several concerns about changing the editorial policy.
     First and foremost, let's face it, the FidoNews editor is not
     chosen by the network, s/he's chosen by a process where the
     input by the net at large is limited, if not closed entirely.
     If the editor was chosen by some democratic means by the entire
     network we would have some input in case we ever run across a
     "bad" editor.  But as policy now stands, the "ruling clique" of
     the net choses the editor.  With the FidoNews editorial policy
     now, we could stand a "bad" editor -- there wouldn't be much
     s/he could do.  With an editorial policy change a "bad" editor
     could spell disaster and endless flaming controversy.

          With an editorial policy change there will always be the
     specter of censorship rearing its ugly head.  I'm not talking
     about the censorship of an article that may be libelous, but I'm
     talking about censoring someone's views because they're not
     liked, or that they may be considered "too far outside the
     mainstream" of thought.

          We see this in our own mass media, where editors "limit"
     the range of debate on various topics.  Would "Mikey" (for those
     who remember him) or someone who is presenting very
     controversial or critical views of FidoNet policy be prevented
     from writing in the FidoNews?  With a change of editorial policy
     that could possibly happen, not matter how well-intentioned the
     change may be.

          The policy as it stands now has worked pretty well over the
     years.  Agreed, we sometimes do get some "trash" (depending, of
     course, on your definition of trash; one person's trash is
     another person's treasure).  But so what.  At least we're not
     distributing an empty newsletter.  The argument of distributing
     a large newsletter because of the size of an occasional "trash"
     FidoNews 7-43                Page 11                  22 Oct 1990


     article is weak, in my humble opinion.  How long did we transfer
     extra bytes because we refused to change archive programs?  The
     size in question is small, rarely will the "trash" articles be
     over a minute's connect time, so the cost argument is a bit
     weak, I think.

          I also think it's nice to have those off-topic "trash"
     articles sometimes.  They tend to remind us that there is a life
     outside of BBSing and sometimes they're pretty neat.  Recently I
     read an article about some experimental language and one
     person's interest in it.  I thought it was interesting enough so
     I spent a 15-cent postcard to request more information on the
     language.  I doubt I would have heard about the language if it
     had not been in the FidoNews.

          There's a trick to dealing with articles that you consider
     trash.  After you read the first couple of sentences -- and
     realize it's trash -- you can hit the PgDn key a couple of times
     and you'll never be bothered by that article again.  It works
     like a charm on those rare articles that aren't worth reading,
     believe me...

          The bottom line: the editorial policy has worked pretty
     darn well for years.  It ensures a minimum amount of
     interference (and work) by the editor, and it also ensures that
     everyone's views can get into the FidoNews.  Leave it as it is.

     Al Saveriano
     FidoNet 1:269/205

                              The State of the Universe

     I realized, a long time ago, that the reason I never got my
     wonton soup at the Chinese restaurant, was because of the way I
     ordered it, coupled with the little known fact that the Chinese
     read from right to left. The waiter would say to me "Would like
     any soup, sir?". And I'd always answer "Wonton". Well, it's
     obvious to me that since wonton spelled backwards is "not_now",
     there was no way I was ever going to get my soup.

     However, this not the only weirdness that encompasses our globe.
     And speaking of weird, my younger daughter asked me what the
     little nursery rhyme was about "i before e etc. etc.". I told
     her it went - "i before e, except after c, when sounding like a,
     as in neighbor and weigh". So she wrote me this little sentence:
     "Thanks Daddy. That sure is a WIERD little rhyme!". Hmmm......
     So obvious.

     But enough of these matters. It is time to address the heart of
     the problem. You know we must. No option here. Sticking our
     collectives heads in the parabola simply will not cut it. It is
     so obvious that weird wonton soup can not be blamed for the
     absence of 8-bit wheat toast. It can not be the cause for my
     name to appear on the mailing list of "Incurably Strange"
     magazine. Nay. A plot to be sure. One of the magnitude to rival
     even that of the great Game_Boy scandal of '88. It's obvious.
     Just look at the facts. Eight is half of sixteen and sixteen is
     half of thirty-two. Do you think this is a coincidence? With the
     infinite number of numbers (number of numbers???) that exist,
     what were the chances of this occurring due to blind chance?
     (Blind Faith - Stevie Winwood et al. Circa 1969). Let us
     calculate so that the skeptics among you may become believers.
     If one takes the first derivative of the numerator and divides
     it by the second derivative of the denominator ..umm..well, it
     is difficult to show it here. I wish I could type out the actual
     formula. But that is why the Greek civilization could not
     sustain itself as a world power. They couldn't get those silly
     little Greek letters onto a keyboard! And that, obviously, lead
     to the vicious attack on Molly Pitcher and started the entire
     world oil crisis. But I digress. The real issue remains at hand.

     Therefore, I expect to hear numerous pros and cons with regard
     to my brilliant but somewhat unorthodox analysis of the state of
     the universe. But I assume you've been expecting this for
     sometime now. You have? To bad, because when you assume you make
     an ASS out of U and ME. (Odd Couple - Felix Unger - circa 1972).

     Kevin and I like to stand in the middle of the Marine Drum and
     Bugle Corp., cause it's real loud, and they can't stop to shoo
     us away.  One of the highlights of the State Fair of Texas.
     We like to shoot the machine pellet gun and knock the red star
     out of the paper.  This weeks column is sort of like those
     games.

     I ordered them June 11, but still no V.42 ROMS.  I know, but
     I'm tired of calling them and hearing the two more weeks story.

     My personal copier cartridge finally ran out.  It's been 3
     years and 3 months.

     Sure, I use Supercalc.  I like to enter A1 instead of +A1, and
     SUM() instead of @SUM().  Supercalc has the /1 command to give
     you 123 menus ( with the added /S command to get back ).  You
     won't see Lotus suing Computer Associates, though.
     CA is bigger, for one.

     One more broken Window :  In last weeks section entitled
     Mini-Blinds I forgot to remind you that without Mini-Blinds, it
     would be curtains for us all !  I know, it's Pane-ful.

     CORRECTION : In last weeks column I said our region's policy
     vote was about echomail.  Well, I errored, so SUE ME, OK.  The
     policies were about election methods for RC and REC.  It's that
     same old arguement about the **C structure only vote versus
     the all sysops vote.  My psychiatrist gets richer.

     Kevin really wants to throw the dart.  You know, the dollar for
     one dart, hit the balloon and win a prize.  Well, he hit the
     balloon and the lady gives him a micro-batting-helmet, a little
     plastic hat about three inches across.  He's got this big grin,
     like "Ha, I won."  Then he tries to get me to carry it, and I
     start laughing, which he immediately understands as 'Oh, I
     lost.'

     counter and he asks for the last four digits of my phone
     number.  "It's the customer ID for our computer", he says.
     "0000" says I.  He's clearly angry.  So I give him the modem's

     The House of Mirrors --

     I bought a 'Learn Danish' set of tapes to listen to in the
     car.  I know a lot of words, but I'm terrible at making
     sentences.  On the tape, they say 'Vaer saa venlig' before
     everything.  That's supposed to be Danish for please.  I'd
     guess the tapes are 50 years old, except that they didn't
     make cassettes back then.  Danes always make a request and
     end it with thanks.  The funniest thing on the tape is the
     line 'Please carry my bags to the taxi.'  These people have
     never been to Denmark.  We're all going for Christmas.

     So Kevin tries the House of Mirrors, and takes 10 minutes to
     find his way through and up the stairs to the slide.  Yep, its
     the $1.50 slide ride. After about 5 minutes he comes back
     through the mirrors, out the entrance and says, "That's the
     wrong slide."
