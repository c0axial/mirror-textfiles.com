========================================================================
    hiya you.

    Goldberg variations spiralling up staircase, drifting faintly
into my office/hideout.  i like them when i'm trying to figure
things.  mind follows trails and fugues, gently ordering and
revolving, multiplicity of perspective causing shapes like holographs.

    this feels like my old apartment on water street, where i put my
first computer.  it was a bit slumlike, backyard shabbly and i had
to climb a fence to get to my door.  the plumbing often didn't work
but i didn't mind, because there were beautiful ancient hand pumps
instead of taps, connected to a well.  all the walls were at peculiar
angles, so shadows fell in trances.  at a first i had my computer in
an alcove of windows on an old oak desk that i got cheap at the sally
ann because a drawer was missing.  empty old picture frames hung like
wallpaper evereywhere.  i'd watch them with my imagination instead
of television.

     the computer was in a time warp, surrounded by victorian junk.
it had a modem, and someone gave me some numbers.  didn't know what
they were for so i tried them.  that's how i got into this magic space.

     i liked to move the computer around to see what affect
differeing environments had on my time online.  i moved it into the
bathroom.  giant clawfoot bathtub, candles, shadow puppets near the
ceiling.  then i moved it onto the roof of the kitchen, which was
flat like a porch, surrounded by dead trees, a condmned building and
a parking lot.  then i moved it inside again, on a low table in front
of an open window between two blank canvasses.  Eventually the
canvasses filled up and i moved.  Spaces have moods to them.

     didn't know what bbss were supposed to be when i started calling
them.  i thought that the only people reading echos were the dozen
or so people writing messages, so i wrote messages to them,
unselfconsciously from inside my head.  Chatting was a rush.  using
the modem was goldmining for other minds.  hypnotic.  mesmerizing.

    i finally learned about route maps and how echos work by meeting
an e-friend at a donought shop at two o-clock in the morning. i
came to feel bonded with people through this medium.  i've heard of
people meeting online and then meeting in person and being
disappointed, but i've never been disappointed by real-time meeting an
e-friend.

     when i became conscious of the vastness of the web, and how
public it can be, and how socially organized some of it is, i
stopped writing messages.  it seemed like live theatre, and i had
stage fright.  all that structure made me claustrophobic.  that went
away when i began to admire senses of community evolving in echos and
nets and i wanted to be involved, even if i was awkwardly self-conscious
about it.  sometimes i get fed up when the sense of magic and community
FidoNews 11-32                 Page:  3                    08 Aug 1994

is threatened by nastier aspects of culture from which bbss can free me.
i am disappointed when hierarchical concepts migrate from the technical
aspect of managing nets, to social ones.

     years later i'm still fascinated by it all.  i'm boggling
through specs and manuals and wire-tap laws and issues of CUD;  i'll
never absorb all of it, there's more and more.  i only do that because
i'm looking for goldminds.

A:   goldminds:  re new able re source.

                  o x x x===ooooooo....#$%^!

Q:   i read in the most recent edition of CUD that "hackers" are
being cracked down upon for "pornography".  This time hackers had
used a *nuclear weapons* laboratory machine in Livermore as a
repository site for some pictures or something.

A:  huh?  nuclear weapons?  who's using technology pornographically?

Q:  What are you doing?

A:  i'm going to Arizona to examine part of the plant experiment.
i'm going to look for a pile of dead junky metal and steering
equipment, with intelligent plant life growing out of it.

I had to write a Woodstock story or go sit in the mud again.

This was first published in the Providence (Rhode Island, USA) Sunday
Journal Magazine, Aug. 7, 1994, and is spreading via the New York
Times News Service. The author grants permission, blah, blah, blah ...
to free systems to post it or pass it on. Just keep it free.

WOODSTOCK REMEMBERED

HEADLINE: "The global village is finally wired''

By SHEILA LENNON

``I still get a chill through me. Woodstock happened because a lot of
people believed in those things -- helping each other, sharing, making
it better together.'' -- Al Fumognari. Providence Sunday Journal,
August 13, 1989

You must know by now that Woodstock was more than the mud and the
FidoNews 11-32                 Page:  4                    08 Aug 1994

stars and the music.

An experience, not an album.

"To the media it was a catastrophe, but to us, it was the very best
life," Carmino Scaglione of Scituate, R.I., recalled in 1989.

For three days in 1969 he and I and a half-million like-minded
strangers had come together and created the world we wanted to live
in. There were no rules, and no violence.

Woodstock was as far as we could take the '60s. Freedom could work,
but we were kids. We didn't know enough, and Richard Nixon's America
wasn't ready for more than our dress rehearsal.

We went home, different, some too different ever to fit into anywhere.

Others forgot what happened at Woodstock and got lost in the glitz.

I bought the "Whole Earth Catalog," the owner's manual of the
counterculture, and discovered Buckminster Fuller, cheap travel and
natural childbirth.

Twenty-five years later, Richard Nixon is dead, our dissatisfaction
with government is widespread, and the global village is finally
wired. It's time to move into it.

"A million small computers, linked by ordinary telephone lines, can
suddenly wield formidable computing power that is extremely hard to
control in a rigidly hierarchical, centralized manner." -- Howard
Rheingold, "Virtual Communities."

The information highway will not be televised.

Learn to navigate the computer net, or be relegated to the second tier
of the future -- a shopper. ``Interactive TV'' will restrict your
choices to which movies you'll watch and which ATM account to debit
for those cubic zirconias.

True ``interactivity'' allows you to generate content from a keyboard,
to send and receive. Not only celebrities get ``microphones.'' You too
have a voice. You can champion an idea, object to an outrage, question
authority. Like-minded people are again coming together, but this time
the "virtual world" is computer-mediated. You'll have to make friends
with machines, or at least learn their language, in order to enter the
future.

Mastering the computer may prove a stretch, harder in its own way than
the mud and thirst and heat of Woodstock. But many people will help
you, and ask only that you pass on what you learn to someone a few
steps behind you.

I haven't felt smart since I arrived online, but I'm having a great
time.

FidoNews 11-32                 Page:  5                    08 Aug 1994

Unorthodox information -- topics not seriously covered by the
mainstream press -- is exchanged like contraband. Such '60s staples as
herbs and alternative medicine, underground politics, altered states,
organic gardening, vegetarian cooking and astrology mix with such '90s
concerns as virtual reality, ACT UP, jobs wanted and health care.

Politicians who venture online will find a well-informed constituency
already here, and can expect to account for their actions publicly and
often.

``Information wants to be free.''-- Stewart Brand, founder of the
"Whole Earth Catalog" and The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link, the WELL.

In Woodstock's economy, your money was useless. What we had was
shared, and what was ordinarily exchanged for money was given away.

Many local bulletin boards offer free public access to global nets.
Freelance computer programmers distribute inexpensive software through
them: "shareware" that you're welcome to try before you buy.

On the net, you can give away all that you have and still have it all.
Electronic information is not a hard commodity.

What has value here are the people who can generate information. What
you know and how you'll share it is your currency.

``It was a little bit frightening to have such freedom, like another
world where you could do anything, say anything, be anyone, nobody
would stop you.'' Kathleen McDevitt, Providence Sunday Journal, August
13, 1989

In 1989, I went back to Bethel, New York, to what will always be
called Max Yasgur's farm, to cover the 20th-anniversary celebration of
Woodstock for the Journal-Bulletin, and brought along my 13-year-old
daughter, Casey Dahm. I tapped on a laptop in the grass, reporting on
a week of local bands lining up to play on the same spot as Jimi
Hendrix and Janis Joplin, and on the climactic Saturday night when
10,000 people rekindled that spirit of goodness that pervades the
place.

Casey will always remember it as the scene of her first kiss.

This year, Casey wants to be nowhere near the Catskills. The free,
eight-day Rainbow Gathering and Megarave in Arizona's the Grand Canyon
sounds more interesting. The Rainbow People, tie-dyed nomads, are
gathering there with the Zippies.

Zippies?

One, a fashion failure wearing virtual-reality goggles, graced the May
cover of Wired magazine, the 18-month-old guide to technohip that's
the biggest marketing success since Rolling Stone, and already not as
good as it used to be.

Zippies are technohippies from England who deftly mix the music and
FidoNews 11-32                 Page:  6                    08 Aug 1994

multimedia of the rave club scene, Druid religious roots, psychedelics
and that old hippie freedom trip. Their tour is called Pronoia -- the
sneaking feeling that others are conspiring to help you -- and their
goal is evolution, a revolution in consciousness. (Sound familiar?)

``When cars got stuck, people would literally lift them up. We were
spontaneously working together.'' John Sousa, Providence Sunday
Journal, August 13, 1989

The spirit of freakdom rides again, moving as information on a global
net that links nearby to nowhere special. It thrives on diversity and
disdains commercialism, a movement from the Old World to the New.

The net offers another chance to get it right:

We empower each other by sharing information.

We can create here, together, a society in which everyone has a voice,
and everybody's ideas are heard.

It's a different world now, 25 years later, and it's showtime.

Bulletin's features department.)

Charles Herriot of 1:163/110 submits yet another letter
from the chemically imbalanced Doc Logger to the Reverend
Visage, a man of deep, probing ministries. Roll da flick,
Sylvia...

Dear Reverend Visage,

Oh great. I have Snooze accountants crawling all over the
place. Do you think you might have been a little more subtle
and *not* submitted the receipts for Consuela's counseling
on edible underwear. Mercifully, every forensic scientist in
the universe is working on the O.J. case and they'll never
be able to match your tongue prints.

I am so pleased that you are being civilized about your
placement on the Snooze masthead. I am sure that neither Don
nor Sylvia cheated when I lost that poker bet wherein I had
to find someone who would get more Steve Winter mail than
they do. Mercifully, Steve Winter hasn't heard a *thing*
about your pagan rituals involving lubricants and nuns. When
the inevitable flood begins, I suggest stepping on the
messages with large measures of Glenlivet.

FidoNews 11-32                 Page:  7                    08 Aug 1994

Best of luck in British Columbia. I fear that you may learn
that not only the RC12 is missing, but that fellow Satti has
gone AWOL as well. Keep your eyes open for glassine craters
which may mark the spot where they underwent spontaneous
human combustion. The RC12, who runs an alleged BBS system
on alternate Wednesdays, hasn't sprinkled Holy Oil on the
winner of the net250 election but we can be assured that the
comatose majority continues to support him.

I tried to take your advice with respect to avoiding net250
sysop echos but I can't seem to control the evil twitching
in my Dr. Strangelove arm that keeps areafixing one of the
best humour echos on the continent. I mean, you can't help
but giggle at an endless stream of messages bragging about
how they are pulling 1,000 echos into their net but they
 *still* can't move mail eight city blocks in less than four
days. Imagine, some of their sysops go into horrible
withdrawal when they haven't received Keith Robb's Dreknet
advertisement message on a daily basis.

What is more remarkable, is that there are still pockets of
poor souls who believe that the PeeFour document is the
highest and best expression of their McJob management
careers. I think it would be a good and decent thing for us
to help these people by sending them as the advance guard to
Haiti where they can proclaim "But we gotta have rules." The
TonTon Macoutes will embrace them with open arms... probably
small arms, with the safeties off.

The recall vote which was held in REG12 to dispense with the
alleged RC was an underwhelming success in vox populi. I
think all twenty four voters who exercised their franchise
will be sending angry netmail to Readers Digest demanding to
know if they are "already a winner."

Your secretary, Ms. LaBamba has parked herself on the edge
of my desk and despite my pleas for more oxygen she refuses
to release me from a thighlock until I lash this thing
together and get it shipped to Swamp Swine. I fear that her
silicone implants have gone to her head, and we may need to
send her to Mississauga to have her lobotomized.

I shall be on the road next week, having promised to visit
France where I will be a guest speaker at a "Save The Dwarf
Tossing" rally. I understand that our moosehide parka pal,
Bridgitte Bardot, will be there. I shall stop in
Newfoundland to club a few baby seals so that she can be
suitably attired.

Always Winter and never Christmass
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

From: Mike Riddle (1:285/27)
To: Donald Tees  (1:1/23)
Date: August 3, 1994
Subject: PGP

Re:      Winter of our discontent (his title)
         Always Winter and never Christmass (mine)

Dear Don:

In your generally well considered and written editorial
about the latest Winter storm, you write:

DT> None that I have seen yet are practical.  PGP is the most
DT> common one ... but are we to refuse access to anyone not
DT> using PGP?  I think not.  Besides, unless we poll a system
DT> directly to get the public key, how does it prove anything?
DT> Anybody can create a key and a PGP signature.

First, I while I hope that no one suggested PGP as the ultimate
(dare I say, "final"?) solution, it would be *part* of a solution to the
problem of proof of authorship.  Presumably you could trace the path
line of the submission, or could review your inbound log, but both of
those can be "hacked" so they might not prove much.

But you show a bit of a misunderstanding with respect to PGP.  If you
receive a PGP key and process it, you will see something like the
following example, using a of mine.  Running the process

     pgp [public key filename]

on my public key returns the following:

File contains key(s).  Contents follow...
Key ring: 'mhr28527.$00'
Type bits/keyID    Date       User ID
pub  1024/FE0E156D 1994/05/18 Mike Riddle (mr@rlaw.omahug.org) sig
     1158478D             Jim Grubs, W8GRT
        <jgrubs@voxbox.norden1.com>
sig       F7ADF50D             Jim Grubs

sig       F89A24F9             Christopher Baker
        <1:374/14@fidonet.org>
1 matching key found.

Do you want to add this keyfile to keyring 'C:\PGP\pubring.pgp'
(y/N)?

- From this, you can see that while obtaining the key directly from
FidoNews 11-32                 Page:  9                    08 Aug 1994

me is at least some insurance against "spoofing," the key contains
within itself its own validation.

Whether or not your system can decrypt the signatures is dependent
upon your having obtained the public keys of the signers.  The
process seems slow at first, but quickly builds, and over time
you establish a "web of trust" based upon keys received from a
known, trusted source, plus keys obtained from unknown routes but
processed and signed by known persons.

Within the configuration of PGP you have the option to tailor the
trust levels and requirements, so you can be very easy-going or you
can be quite paranoid.  Or you can take a common-sense, middle ground,
approach.

So if you receive a public key and a signed message in the same packet,
you might still be able to verify the sender.  It will depend upon who
has signed the public key, whether you have any of those keys in your
keyring, and what trust levels *you*, not anyone else, has assigned to
the signers.

PGP might not be a perfect solution for the verification of authorship,
but digital signatures in a broader sense *are* the answer.  The U.S.
government has recently announced a Digital Signature Standard.  The
process, however, has been marred by technological and legal controversy
and it is difficult to say, as I write, what the final outcome will be.

But PGP (or PEM/RIPEM for the internet-able) are existing, relatively
widespread, systems which provide for digital signatures.  PGP, because
of its flexible key and decentralized management, has generally won the
battle for the hearts and minds of cypherpunks within Fidonet.  I
maintain both a RIPEM and a Fidonet public key, but I've never received
anything besides test traffic in RIPEM and I don't encourage its use.
The PGP front-ends are much friendlier.

So that other submission you received?  Maybe you could have trusted it
after all!

Mike

A Response to Digitial Signatures and "Fake Articles"
 by Ryan Anderson (1:120/379)
 Net 120 Secure Mail Hub

Fidonet appears to be at the center of the controversy regarding
digital signatures and encryption.  With the article by Steve Winter's
in at least *ONE* of the recent snooz issues we have come to a point
where there is a great deal of confusion over both digital signatures
and encryption.

A digital signature simply attempts to authenticate the originator of
the message.  Therefore, an article without one has no proof at all of
it's origins.  Via lines and header data are easily faked.

SW?> The recent article in the Snooze FIDO1129.NWS was not authored or
SW?> authorized by me.

This statement by Steve has no margin of proof in it right now,
because we have no verification that he actually submitted the
article.  This is one of the many benefits of learning more about the
encryption currently available to use in Fidonet.

The only way to prevent this from happening in the future is for Steve
to get himself a copy of PGP, create a key, make it available for file
request, and get as many signatures added, as fast as possible.  Then
he needs to sign every message leaving his system.  Maybe then we can
determine if Steve Winters wrote the article in question, or if it was
simply someone annoyed at him making him look like a fool.

For more information on digital signatures, look for the PUBLIC_KEYS
echo.  It's available on the backbone, and in most nets.  Or get a
copy of PGP, and read the documentation.  (It's amazingly informative)

EDUCATOR LOOKING FOR BBS PARTNERS FOR LOCAL SCHOOLS

By way of introduction, I am a 6th grade teacher at Morningside
Elementary School in Brownsville, Texas.  I am on the organizational
committee of NASSE, the National Association of Space Simulating
Educators, which is comprised of a group of educators involved in the
use of classroom and school space simulators (including permanent,
semi-permanent, and temporary simulators).  We met at University
School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, (a suburb of Cleveland) during June
of 1994 to establish a national organization.

    The purposes of the organization are:

1.  To facilitate the exchange of ideas, information, and technical
    enhancements among simulator using educators.

2.  To assist teachers interested in developing space simulators.

3.  To provide consultation services to teachers and schools
    regarding the use of space simulators.

4.  To encourage the use of the information superhighway as a tool
    for enhancing simulations.

5.  To provide assistance regarding sources of free or low cost
    resources and materials from the aerospace community, government
    organizations, and information providers.

6.  To advance the use of simulation as an educational technique in
    all areas of education.

7.  To support the initiatives for space exploration on the part of
    governmental and other organizations.

We currently have well over 50 subscribers to our fledgling
organization.  NASSE has an Internet address (nasse@shadowso.com), and
I a gopher site at http://chico.rice.edu/armadillo/ for storage and
retrieval of Ascii and binary files to enhance educational space
simulations.  I hope to begin placing public domain software on the
Armadillo system very soon.

As a Fidonet/K12Net SysOp, I realize that many educators do not have
full (or even partial) Internet access.  I would like to provide those
educators with a Fidonet echomail area devoted to discussions regarding
the planning and coordination of educational space simulations.  An
appropriate name for the echomail area would be, simply, SPACESIM.

I have been conducting simultaneous educational space simulations for
the past three years.  By "simultaneous," I mean that we coordinate
our simulations with other sites across the country.  When we launch
a mission with our permanent space simulator,  _Columbia  II_,  other
schools monitor our progress via Internet email.  Remote sites also
utilize satellite tracking programs to monitor the "flight."  A
Fidonet echomail area would provide a means whereby educators could
plan for simulations of their  own.  We could also coordinate
simulations that had a much longer duration than the "traditional"
space simulations conducted via Internet.

Essentially, five to seven student "astronauts" perform prelaunch
systems checks as indicated by their preflight launch scripts, see
and hear a space shuttle launch (we have an EXCELLENT VHS video tape
developed by Tim Dedula at NASA Lewis), activate switches labeled
according to  _The Space Shuttle Operator's Manual_  in proper
sequence,  perform experiments while in "orbit," communicate with
Mission Control via wireless FM intercom, utilize satellite tracking
programs to monitor their progress, and so on.  We endeavor to make
the simulations as realistic as possible.

At Mission Control (my classroom), teams of students work together to
make the mission successful:

The Lab Team collects data from the Payload Specialists inside the
simulator who are performing the experiments;

The Medical Team asks the Medical Officer on board the _Columbia II_
space shuttle simulator to take blood pressure, heart rate, pulse, and
respiration readings from the astronauts before and after a rest period
and compares those data to readings taken before and after an exercise
period;

The Navigation Team follows the  _Columbia II's_  progess on a
Shareware satellite tracking program (STSORBIT) and records latitude,
longitude, and altitude, notes the time (in CST and UTC), and plots
the shuttle's current position on a large world map;

The Data Team sends written data to the astronauts via "fax" (a printer
inside the simulator connected to an IBM PC outside);

The Public Relations Team scurries about, picking up information from all
teams to post on a large bulletin board;

The Communications Team relays all voice communications from the various
teams to the student astronauts.

Those interested in participating conduct their own missions as outlined
FidoNews 11-32                 Page: 13                    08 Aug 1994

above OR serve as

weather stations
        solar flare observatories
Auxiliary Mission Control nodes (you could supervise the experiments YOU
        design for US to perform)
NASA tracking stations
        Space Station Freedom
Moonbase Alpha
        Mars Base 5

We communicate with each other via email, but I am working on
obtaining CuSeeMe connectivity.  CuSeeMe is being developed by
Cornell University and allows for realtime videoconferencing on the
Internet.

Over the past two years, we have developed launch and landing
scripts, activity guides, and experiments for the astronauts to
conduct while in orbit.  We have amassed a veritable curnucopia of
space science-related software (e.g., satellite tracking programs,
mission clocks, GIFs of the space shuttle, space flight simulators,
etc.).  Tim Dedula, an electrical technician at NASA Lewis, has been
extremely helpful, not only to us, but to educators across the
country interested in space simulations.  He has provided us with a
wealth of materials, including lesson plans, software, NASA videos,
and VHS videos HE developed of a space shuttle launching, in orbit,
and landing.  We also coordinate simulations with Bob Morgan,
director of the National Educational Simulations  Project  Utilizing
Telecommunications (NESPUT) under the auspices of Academy One and the
Cleveland Freenet, who coordinates several 24-hour missions every
year.  Bob is a pioneer in the field of student space simulations and
has also provided us with lesson plans, ideas for experiments,
computer software (IBM, Apple, and Mac), space science-related book
titles, and much more.

As you can see, the possibilities for this kind of project are
practically limitless.

Our permanent space simulator, the _Columbia II_, is 10 feet wide and
20 feet long.  An  8 x 8 ft.  section was added to provide the
astronauts with a restroom and shower.  The outer covering of the
simulator is white 4 mil poly.  The framework supporting the plastic
consists of 10-foot lengths of PVC that are inserted into 1" holes
drilled into the 2 by 4 base.  The entire structure took about two
weeks to build and cost about $1,500.00.

Each  *  is a  1/2"  hole in which a 10-foot section of PVC pipe is
placed.  A PVC "cross" joins the two opposite PVC pipes together,
forming an arch.  The plastic sheeting is then placed over the arch,
forming a structure somewhat reminiscent of a Conastoga wagon.  The
plans for making the Simulator were taken from a book titled _Space
Simulations_ by Jerry Bernhardt and Larry McHaney.

There are two computers in the communications room.  One computer, a
Mac, is used as a space science encyclopedia.  The Mac contains a
variety of space science-related programs (e.g., The Space Educator's
Handbook, GIF viewers, SatTrak, and so on).  A monitor mounted behind
the control panel is connected to a  modem-equipped  PC  outside the
simulator.  Members from the Data Team use the PC, which is connected
to a video/keyboard switcher,  to run various programs for the
astronauts, including a shuttle tracking program, GIF viewer,
telecommunications program, and Space Flight Simulator.  The third
computer  - an Apple IIe - is located in the Middeck area and is used
for additional training on aeronautics and spaceflight.

Two lengths of coax cable and a phone line from my classroom provide
video and audio links to the simulator.  A VHS VCR and Panasonic
laserdisk player are connected to a video switcher which is, in turn,
connected to the 50-foot length of coax cable so that various video
segments (e.g., shuttle launch, earthviews from the shuttle,
thunderstorms, atmospheric anomalies, shuttle landing, etc.) can be
transmitted to a large screen TV inside the simulator.  A video
splitter located between the video switcher and the 50-foot length of
coax allows Mission Control personnel to view the launch, earthviews,
landing, and so on, on a TV inside Mission Control.

A surveillance camera is mounted to the middle wall separating the
Flightdeck and Middeck areas.  A 60-foot length of camera cable is
connected to a B/W monitor in Mission Control for continuous
supervision.  This particular surveillance system provides 1-way
video/audio communications from the student astronauts and Mission
Control technicians.

A control panel was added to the simulator this year.  Various
aircraft instruments have been placed in the panel to add an extra
touch of realism.  Thirty-two switches have also been installed.  Each
switch is labeled and corresponds to an actual switch found inside a
real space shuttle.  When the switch is depressed, a bulb is lit on a
control panel in Mission Control.  The panel in Mission Control also
contains switches that light bulbs on the control panel inside the
Simulator.

Two sets of wireless FM intercoms that provided for voice
communications between the astronauts and Mission Control and between
the astronauts in the Flightdeck and Middeck areas have been removed.
FidoNews 11-32                 Page: 15                    08 Aug 1994

The surveillance camera described above provides one-way communications
between the astronauts and Mission Control.  An FM tuner connected to
a stereo mixer with 3 microphone inputs (and 4 additional inputs)
provides one-way communications between Mission Control and the the
astronauts.  We are experimenting with the mixer, using it to manage
various sound inputs as sound effects (e.g., laserdisk player, CD-ROM
player, cassette, etc.)

Another modem-equipped computer in Mission Control classroom provides
a mode of communication that allows the Public Relations Team to
correspond with students, educators, and space science professionals
the world over.

Activities with our space simulator culminate in a simultaneous
24-hour mission in which student astronauts and Mission Control
technicians conduct experiments related to space science, perform
emergency evacuation drills, and correspond with students in many
states and countries who also participate in the 24-hour space
simulation.

The project is a cooperative effort involving teachers, parent
volunteers, and students of all ages, but we focus on 4th thru 6th
grade students.  Once the various roles have been assigned, everyone
must work together to define his/her responsibilities throughout the
mission.  A firm chain of command must be established.  For example,
as Operations Director, I speak only to Team Leaders.

We conduct, on average, one 8-hour long simulation every month
beginning at 10:00 a.m. CST (16:00 UTC).  This type of project
requires careful planning in order for all teams to know what their
respective duties and responsibilities are.  The date for the next
simulation will be announced at least two weeks prior to the
simulation.

It is also possible that simulations could be coordinated over a
period of many days or even weeks.  Such would be the case in a
simulation of an extended journey to Mars.

In future, additional echomail areas could be devoted to specific
aspects of the educational space simulation:  Planning, Resources,
Lessons and Experiments, Scenarios, and so on.

I understand that in order for SPACESIM to get on the backbone, I have
to demonstrate a need for such distribution.  If you are a Fidonet
SysOp and would like to subscribe to the SPACESIM echomail area, please
email

        WASHINGTON (AP) -- School districts with programs that encourage
acceptance of homosexuality would lose federal funding under a
Senate proposal.
        Senators voted 63-36 Monday in favor of a proposal by Sens.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Bob Smith, R-N.H., to cut federal aid to
districts that ``carry out a program or activity that has either
the purpose or effect of encouraging or supporting homosexuality as
a positive lifestyle alternative.''
        Included were distribution of instructional materials,
counseling and referral of students to gay organizations.
        The vote occurred as the Senate debated reauthorization of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which spreads $12.5 billion
in federal funds among the nation's public schools.
        The House included a similar amendment when it passed the bill.
Differences between the two versions will have to be worked out by
a conference committee before the bill can be signed into law by
President Clinton.
        Smith had a stack of pamphlets he said were typical of those
purchased by school districts that teach about homosexuality in
social studies or sex education programs.
        He said some were ``so graphic and so disgusting that I can't
display them here on the floor of the United States Senate.''
        But Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., called the proposal ``very
mean-spirited'' and said it would forbid counseling of gay
students, who he said are two to three times as likely as other
FidoNews 11-32                 Page: 17                    08 Aug 1994

teen-agers to commit suicide.
        ``We simply can't do that,'' he said.
        Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, said the proposal would inject the
federal government into local decision-making and would ``remove
the local discretion that is the hallmark of our educational
system.''
        Some school districts teach acceptance of homosexuality during
social studies or sex education programs. Such a program in New
York City led to the ouster of Joseph Fernandez as chancellor of
the nation's largest school system last year.
        Publishers also are offering some books written especially for
curricula that teach acceptance of gays.
        ``Heather Has Two Mommies'' and ``Daddy's Roommate'' depict
lesbian and gay male couples in family settings with children.
Other books designed for AIDS education programs are more graphic.
Some describe sexual acts and advocate the use of latex condoms
during intercourse.
        Helms denounced what he called the ``disgusting, obscene
material that's laid out before school children in this country
every day.''
        The Elementary and Secondary Education Act also sets the
distribution formula for federal dollars targeted for disadvantaged
students.
        More than 90 percent of the nation's school districts receive
funds from the so-called Chapter I program. But the money is spread
so thin that many poor children are either not served or
underserved.

An Editorial Policy Is Required

An Editorial Policy Is Required
by Denis McMahon, 2:251/20

Listen up Donald & Sylvia, it's about time you put an editorial
policy in place that stops the Snooze being used for flamewars.eur,
flamewars.usa, flamwewars.uk etc, and dragged it back out of the
gutter it seems to have fallen into.

I and many others have their own ideas about who is right and who is
wrong in the various local conflicts, and I probably have the same
total lack of interest about the conflicts going on elsewhere as
anyone else.

Added to this, just about everyone distorts the truth in some way
when putting across their side of a dispute, so the information
posted in the Snooze often varies between the inaccurate and
downright lies.

 +++++++++++++++++++++++ ENOUGH IS ENOUGH +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I thought that the Snooze was an important part of FidoNet, it's how
we're kept up to date with what's going on. However, it seems that
FidoNews 11-32                 Page: 18                    08 Aug 1994

the current fashion is to use the snooze for:

(a) The editors to make profound comments based on their own lives -
which is probably OK - editors should be able to write what they
like in an editorial.

(b) Flamewars.uk - an ongoing series of allegations and
counter-allegations that in total contain maybe 5% true fact
concerning the administration of FidoNet in Zone 2 Region 25.

(c) Flamewars.usa - an ongoing series of articles about sysops in
the usa by sysops in the usa who disagree with each other.

(d) Sick humour - which may also be a deliberate attempt by some
people to upset other people.

(e) Net humour - which would be fine if the author wasn't trying to
score political points with it, and

(f) Occasionally something useful like a new echo announcement etc.

(a) I don't mind within reason, (b) contains so much lies it could
never be printed in the UK without major courtroom civil action, (c)
might yet go the same way on your side of "the pond" (Atlantic
Ocean), (d) is unneccessary, (e) tolerable and (f) shouild be
encouraged.

So, editors, are you going to allow the continued hands off and
print the lot policy to continue, or do you have the courage to do
what any other editor does and, at risk of upsetting contributors,
chuck the rubbish in the bin.

At the end of the day, if someone else wants to start up en ezine
called fidowars they can do it, but lets kick this rubbish out the
Snooze!

"The crackdown needed to be done, software piracy has become a

National sport in Italy. Unfortunately, the operation rapidly became
too wide for our forces: right now, here in Pesaro we are only three
Prosecutors, quite busy with penal trials, in court all day long. We
will try to do our best with the less possible damage for the entire
community."

Here are the explanatory words of Gaetano Savoldelli Pedrocchi, the
Pesaro Prosecutor who is managing the investigations that last week
led to a nationwide crackdown on Fidonet Italia BBSes

During the  operation - confidentially known as "Hardware 1" - more
than 60 (some sources go up to 130) Bulletin Board Systems have been
visited and searched by police officials.

In the central and northern part of the country, several Fidonet
nodes were closed and dozens of operators were charged of "conspiracy
with unknown for distribution of illegally copied software and
appropriation of secret passwords."

Some figures say the seizures included more than 120 computers, 300
streamer-cassettes and CD-ROMs, 60,000 floppy disks, an imprecise
number of modems and other electronic devices.

In some cases, police officials sealed off rooms and garages where
the BBSes were operated or closed all the hardware they found in a
closet. Several Fidonet operators (generally students, professionals,
small-company owners) lost their personal data because every magnetic
support was "suspected to carry pirated software".

Aimed to crack a distribution ring of illegal software run by two
people using the publicly available Fidonet nodelist, investigators
searched and seized every single site of the list - even those that
had never had any contact with the two suspected.

Also, many operators not inquired by police were forced to
immediately shut down their systems, searching for possible illegal
software covertly uploaded on their BBSes.

As a consequence of such indiscriminate operations, the real, very
few pirate boards had the chance to quickly hide their businesses -
sources say.

"I do not believe to this scenario," said the Pesaro Prosecutor in an
interview by SottoVoce Magazine. "We acted after precise information
about the activities of a specific data-bank: if some operators have
nothing to do with the charges, we'll verify it as soon as possible."

Questioned about further investigations against BBSes users, the
Prosecutor said: "We'll see later....at the present, users can sleep
peacefully: otherwise, I cannot imagine how many people should be
investigated.  I do not want to criminalize the entire population.
Even if the inquiry has become so vast, this is not a subject of
vital importance for our country.  It is mostly a fiscal and
bureaucratic issue, a matter of small-scale but spread illegality."

However, rumors say other inquires are currently underway in other
cities, and even the Criminalpol is working on similar issues.

Assisting the investigated people, some lawyers already asked for the
immediate return of the confiscated materials, while others suggested
to wait for better times. In any case, it will probably take months
(years?) before receiving official answers regarding the seizures.

Struggling to re-open in some way their systems,  Fidonet operators
are also working to get the attention of mainstream media on the
issue - with little success, so far. After an article published by La
Repubblica,  two local newspapers, Il Mattino and Il Giornale di
Brescia, run brief reports on  May 15, both centered on "a wide
software piracy ring cracked by police officials".

But the real activity is happening inside and around electronic
communities.

MC-Link and especially Agora' Telematica (the biggest Italian
systems) are doing a great job, offering space for news, opinions and
comments - also acting as connection links between the decimated net
of BBSes and worried individuals scattered in the country.

Here is just  one example: "....police officials seized everything,
including three PCs (one broken), a couple of modem (just fixed for
some friends), floppies, phone cables, phone-books. Now Dark Moon is
off, hoping to have at least one line available in a few days, maybe
at 2400.  I fear that more raids will soon follow elsewhere. So,
please, stay alert..."

A catching dynamism flourishes from the BBSes linked to Cybernet.
Although some of them are currently not operating, a special issue of
the Corriere Telematico was just released over the net and their
printed voice, Decoder Magazine, will soon distribute news,
testimonies, comments on "Operation Hardware 1".

PeaceLink has set up a defense committee-news center in Taranto and
its spokesperson, Alessandro Marescotti, will sign an article for the
next issue of the weekly magazine Avvenimenti.

Promptly alerted, the International online community gave good
response - quickly redistributing the news over the Net and sending
supportive messages.

Here is an email from Michael Baker, Chairman of Electronic Frontiers
Australia: "To that end I am writing to offer assistance to anyone in
Italy who wants to set up such an  organisation.  Recently I (along
with others) have set up Electronic Frontiers Australia, and I am now
its Chairman. Other national EF groups have been, or are being, set
up in several other countries (Canada, Ireland, Norway, UK and
Japan)....if there is anything we can do to help, please ask."

Shifting toward politics, on May 19, the first working day of the new
Italian Cabinet, six Members of the Reformers group presented a
written question to the Ministers of Justice and Interior.

After a short introduction about telecom systems, the document gives
an account of the facts and asks three final questions to the
Government: "- if it will intend to open an investigation to verify
if the raids ordered by the Pesaro Prosecutor's office were
prejudicial to the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression;
- if it is not the case to set up a better and greater team of
computer experts in order to avoid further random seizures of
electronic devices that lead to shut down the BBSes; - if it is not
the occasion to confirm that current legislation does not charge
system operators with objective responsibility for users' activities
on telecom systems."

Although the Fidonet sysop community (about 300 people) is still
quite uncertain regarding its future, many of them feel the urgent
need to overcome a sort of cultural and social isolation that clearly
surrounds the telecom scene in Italy.

At the moment the main issue is how to raise public interest and
political pressure to obtain clear laws in support of civil rights in
the electronic medium.

Ideas and proposals are developing from several electronic
laboratories, such as the Community Networking conference on Agora'
Telematica as well as on Cybernet.

"We underestimate our strength: if we could just be able to set up an
Italian Association of Telecom Users we could put pressure on
political  and  legislative bodies." "Overwhelm newspapers, radio and
tv stations with faxes, letters, phone calls!"  "We must attract
common people, through hundreds of tables and events in the streets
more than online, even if we do not have a Kapor to support us."
"There should be press-conferences in several cities, with the
presence of investigated people along with famous persons,
politicians."  "What about a 24-hours silence from any system in the
country with simultaneous events in each city and village where a BBS
operates?"

The situation is rather fluid and in e-motion. Stay connect!

I have been reading the "articles" that our fellow Fidonaut Steve
Winter has been posting over the past 52 issues...  And I am getting
VERY TIRED of what I see as "My Christianity is the only real
Christianity, all the rest can go to hell!"

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what *I* believe Mr. Winter is
putting into the snooze...  I'm not saying that his view of
Christianity is not correct, but who is he to tell us if our view of
Christianity is not correct?  Isn't this like why the Puritans and
other religous groups came to our dear land?  So they wouldn't have to
be told that their views are wrong?

I know, and I AM admitting, I do not go to church every weekend, or
read the Bible every day for eight hours...  But I do believe that He
does have a plan for us...  And I am willing to be a part of it.  But
that plan is not for you or any other human being to decide,
Mr. Winter...

I'm not saying that religion should not be in FidoNet, but, please,
Mr. Winter, do not condemn other Christians because they are not
"your brand" of Christian.  And please feel free to contact me by
netmail or by an open article in the snooze if you want to correct me
as to the reasons behind your views...

For those of you with PGP who wish to reply by netmail, please
send me an encrypted message.  My key lays below...  Along with
my signature...

BTW -- I have plenty of hard drive space for the flood of messages that
will arrive! <very large grin>

Best Regards, and me He be with you,
Matt
