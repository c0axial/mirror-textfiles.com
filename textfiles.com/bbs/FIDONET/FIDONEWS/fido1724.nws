          | There isn't always something happening on Fidonet, but |
          | there's always something which isn't happening.  This  |

                              Policy 4 Abolished
                                  Doug Myers

     In a remarkable display of international harmony and cooperation
     earlier this week, sixty six of Fidonet's Regional Coordinators met
     in the super secret WW_REGCON echo to repeal Fidonet's decade old
     Policy 4.07.  The unanimously adopted Policy 5.00 brings about
     sweeping changes to Fidonet, among them:

     - elections at all coordinator levels, except where it conflicts
       with local tradition.

     - equality for all individuals, except that sysops are more equal
       and elected or appointed individuals are even more equal than
       that.

     - geographic organization is abandoned in recognition of the
       improved interconnection patterns brought about by the internet.
       The new basic unit of organization will be known as a "fiefdom."

     - echomail is finally recognized as a matter of policy.  Though it
       doesn't fall under the traditional coordinator structure, a
       multiple backbone structure is defined.  Freedom of speech in all
       echoes is guaranteed except where it conflicts with moderator
       rulings.

     Though informal polls indicate that the policy change is supported
     by all 66 regional coordinators, it isn't official yet due to an
     untimely failure of the WW_REGCON echo.  Though it isn't widely
     known, this super secret echo was actually the creation of Doc
     Logger who, though he couldn't post on the echo, found it convenient
     to establish clandestine connections to it so he could monitor the
     elflords as they plotted to keep Fido under their thumb.
     Ironically, all of the elflords accepted Doc's clandestine
     connection through his old XT computer and never bothered to connect
     amount themselves.  This set up a situation where all traffic
     through this echo flowed through the XT in Doc's basement (somehow
     given an administrative node number).  Those of you who remember Doc
     Logger know that he departed Fidonet some time back, headed for his
     retirement home in the South Seas.  Though he remembered to take his
     advanced system (the 286), he completely forgot about his XT in the
     cellar.

     Fidonews has learned through discrete sources that the machine
     FIDONEWS 17-24               Page 2                   12 Jun 2000


     failed earlier this week because the local electric utility finally
     shout off electricity after two years of uncollected bills.
     Unfortunately, this failure occurred after the Policy Change
     Referendum had been posed, but before any votes were actually
     gathered.  It is suspected that Doc's old place will ultimately be
     sold for back taxes and the machine is expected to gather votes when
     electric service is restored.

     In the meantime, this is what's not happening on Fidonet.

     Hello Darrell,

     Ten days ago I flew from Chicago, IL to San Jose, CA. During the
     flight I started a conversation with my "neighbor", who turns out to
     be Tom Davison, a former node from Ottawa who recently moved to
     Colorado.

     We had a great chat comparing notes on Fidonet, a few good laughs
     about common acquaintances and generally a good time.

     Tom was interested in some of the new things we're into today, such
     as Fido via IP, etc. However, he asked me to pass along greetings to
     the region and to the Ottawa net.

     Done! :-)

     Dear Lord,
     Every evening
     As I'm lying here in bed
     This tiny little prayer
     Keeps running through my head
     God bless my mom and dad
     And bless my little pup
     And look out for my sister
     When things aren't looking up
     And God, there's one more thing
     I wish that you could do
     Hope you don't mind me asking
     But please bless my computer too?
     Now I know that's not normal
     To bless a mother board
     But just listen a second
     While I explain to you 'My Lord'
     You see, that little metal box
     Holds more to me than odds & ends
     Inside those small compartments
     Rest a hundred of my 'BEST FRIENDS'
     I know for sure they like me
     By the kindness that they give
     And this little scrap of metal
     Is how I travel to where they live
     By faith is how I know them
     Much the same as you
     I share in what life brings them
     From that our friendship grew
     "PLEASE" Take an extra minute
     From your duties up above
     To bless this scrap of metal
     That's filled with so much love!

                    This weeks page is "Tiny's" Web page.

     Where? http://members.home.com/t1ny/

                                What's it got?

     Lots of stuff here. Shawn Highfield (Tiny) is a programmer. You can
     tell this by his page. I found Tiny's page a long time back while
     looking for some doors for my BBS. He has a great "Hangman" game,
     "Wall of Babble" and some other BBS doors and utilities. There's
     even a L.O.R.D IGM that I run on my BBS called "Sommer's Shiny
     Things". :)

     I drop by this site on occasion to see what has been added. I
     noticed that there is a free Telnet client on the main page for
     download. Of course, I'm gonna try it. :)

     It seems that Tiny is into a lot of things from networking to
     programming and about anything else that deals with computers. I'd
     suggest that you visit this site and take a good look around. As far
     as the BBS and Fidonet areas go, I'll let Tiny tell you about his
     history in that area.

     ----- cut -----
                            My History with BBS's

      I've been running BBS's off and on since 1985 when I wrote BBS
     software for the Commodore 64. I still have a copy of the "Perfect:
     BBS" system on a floppy disk, though after over 10 years I doubt the
     disk as any good. <G>

      After moving to the PC Platform in 1991, I again started running a
     BBS, this one was known as --==>Pern<==-- . As the system became
     popular and went multinode, I changed the name to Online Information
     Xchange.

      OIX expanded and became an Internet Service Provider. I ran that
     until April 1996, when I sold my shares to my partners.

       Shortly after I sold OIX, a good friend of mine who runs a local
     Echomail network called me up in a panic, His main HUB had  went
     down and he was stuck. I threw a mailer up and became HUB 400 in
     powernet. Shortly after that I saw a copy of Telegard 3.0 on another
     system in town. I started setting it up so I could use my favorite
     offline mail reader instead of Front door's folders. One thing led
     to another and Tiny's BBS was born.

     ----cut----

     That's the story from Tiny. Drop by and read the rest of the stuff
     on his page and check out some of the programs he's written as well
     as the products offered.

                               Thin No More...
                          Thanks to Peggy Hollinger
                               allica@juno.com


     There was a Scottish tradesman, a painter called Jock, who was very
     interested in making a pound where he could, so he often would thin
     down paint to make it go a wee bit further.

     As it happened, he got away with this for some time, but eventually
     the Presbyterian Church decided to do a big restoration job on the
     roof of one their biggest churches. Jock put in a bid, and because
     his price was so competitive, he got the job.

     And so he set to, with a right good will, erecting the trestles and
     setting up the planks, and buying the paint and, yes, I am sorry to
     say, thinning it down with the turpentine.

     Well, Jock was up on the scaffolding, painting away, the job nearly
     done, when suddenly there was a horrendous clap of thunder, and the
     sky opened the rain poured down, washing the thin paint from all
     over the church and knocking Jock fair off the scaffold to land on
     the lawn, among the gravestones, surrounded by telltale puddles of
     the thinned and useless paint.

     Jock was no fool. He knew this was a judgment from the Almighty, so
     he got on his knees and cried: "Oh, God! Forgive me! What should I
     do?"

     And from the thunder, a mighty voice spoke:
     "Repaint! Repaint and thin no more!"

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
