                                 WHY ISDN?


     What is ISDN? In 1981 the International Telecommunications Union
     (ITU) defined ISDN as:

     "A NETWORK EVOLVED FROM THE TELEPHONY INTEGRATED DIGITAL NETWORK
     THAT PROVIDES END-TO-END CONNECTIVITY TO SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF
     SERVICES, INCLUDING VOICE AND NON-VOICE SERVICES, TO WHICH USERS
     HAVE ACCESS BY A LIMITED SET OF STANDARD MULTIPURPOSE CUSTOMER
     INTERFACES."

     Unfortunately, this very broad description really doesn't tell
     us much at all. ISDN was conceived as a technology standard in
     the late 1970's. AT&T determined to merge the different types of
     analog circuits its customers were using into a single totally
     integrated digital transmission scheme. In 1980, the CCITT got
     involved to establish a worldwide set of standards for a
     universal Integrated Services Digital Network. ISDN was born. In
     the United States, AT&T no longer controls ISDN standards setting
     activities. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) now
     controls this activity. Most standards setting activities were
     completed by the mid 1980's. ISDN trials began in 1986. Needless
     to say, progress has been slow. As a result, many of the initial
     reasons for ISDN have been supplanted by other technologies.
     These include LANs, fiber optics, and private T-1 networks. These
     technologies do not negate the need for ISDN, however. After all
     how many homes have fiber optic links or T-1 circuits in them.
     ISDN in many ways represents the networking alternative with the
     broadest potential reach. It represents the most all-encompassing
     network of the future.

     ISDN was designed to provide a worldwide mechanism for delivering
     standardized telecommunications services among the world's
     end-users. For once, the world's telephone companies are being
     far-sighted. Of course, this far-sightedness is not because they
     are nice guys. The major motivation is profit. This profit comes
     in a number of ways. Utilization of the same physical
     transmission medium for data, voice, video information, and other
     services is more efficient. Fewer lines are required. In
     addition, the various phone companies would like to add very
     profitable value-added services like advanced call handling,
     electronic mail, videotext, and public data base access.

     Will ISDN revolutionize the BBS world? Most definitely. Access to
     services and other end users is enhanced by the great increase in
     speed offered by ISDN. ISDN is an all digital network. Digital
     technology is far superior to analog for data transmission. It
     also extremely resistant to errors. Line noise becomes a thing of
     the past. A PC to PC connection is completely digital. The modem
     is replaced by an ISDN Terminal Endpoint Type 1 or 2 (TE1 or
     TE2). The TE1 is used for devices which are ISDN compatible. PCs
     FidoNews 7-09                Page 3                   26 Feb 1990


     with integrated voice/data hardware and software will use this
     interface. Older PCs with RS-232 interfaces or LAN connections
     will require the TE2. Soon ISDN ports will be as standard as
     serial and parallel ports are today on PCs.

     ISDN access by the home consumer is via the Basic Rate Interface.
     The BRI is 144k bit/sec. It is divided into three channels. Two
     are 64k bit/sec and the other is 16k bit/sec. Either one of the
     two high-speed channels may be used for voice or data. The 16k
     bit/sec is generally used for control information (call set-up
     and shutdown), but may be used for packetized data. The BRI is
     meant to provide ISDN access to end-user devices like terminals,
     PCs, telephones, and faxes. The BRI provides the standard access
     interface for most end users.

     What does this mean to the average consumer? Today, not much.
     ISDN is being marketed to large corporations and the government
     for telemarketing and networking applications. ISDN's limited
     availability and its orientation toward the business market
     restrict its ability to deliver its promised worth. When ISDN
     reaches into the home, it will reach its full potential.
     Applications like call forwarding, video telephony, voice/data
     mail, and videotext, are some of the most exciting for ISDN.

     A View from the Bridge

     "Captain's Log, Stardate 9002.24"

     Howdy!  Sorry, I didn't make it into last week's episode.  Did
     you miss me?  ;-)

     Well, I'm back.  What shall we babble about today?  Sorry, I
     can't hear you, I'm on a different time track somewhere in your
     past.

     That's the advantage to writing.  Its the only way I know of
     sending messages into the future.

     Anyways, if luck holds, you'll see a registration form for
     FidoCon in this issue of FidoNews.  If you plan to go, please
     don't delay.  There's a $100.00 discount for registering before
     4/1/90, and that ain't hay.  If you can't register by then,
     there's a $50.00 discount for registering by 6/1/90.  It looks
     like we're going to have a lot of fun.  BTW, the 'costume ball'
     is going to be held at the new Medieval Times Dinner &
     Tournament that just opened here.  Those of you in Kissimee
     (sic) and California may be familiar with their locations there.
     You have dinner, eat with your fingers, order from your 'beer
     wench', and watch a medieval tournament, and those attending
     will be in costume, which is mandatory.  I highly recommend it.

     On an unrelated note, (ANDY ROONEY ON:) Did you ever wonder what
     it is that causes some people who sit in front of a computer see
     something that someone else is doing, and start spewing lies &
     misinformation about it when it doesn't even affect them?
     (whew!)  I do.  (ANDY ROONEY OFF:)

     I mean, what is it about some people that they only way they can
     get off is by bashing others?  Whether it be guys in a different
     network, people who use a different bbs than they do, a certain
     type of modem that others use, or even their conference mail
     processing program?  What is it about certain people that their
     only goal in life is to make sure that YOU don't have fun?  If
     you run up against these people, I'd advise you to ignore them.
     Their ignorance speaks for itself in most cases.

     There are some people who feel they have a 'right' to determine
     whether or not *I* run a groupmail processor.  Frankly I don't
     understand this.  As long as it's not causing dupes, or
     affecting others, what business is it of anyone else's WHAT I'm
     doing here?  But no, they'd rather spread lies about how 'buggy'
     the software is, or how it's used for censorship, or some other
     crap.  Of course THEY'VE never run the program!

     from the command line and batch files. Its main program, DO.EXE,
     is the interpreter. It controls DESQview with commands, such as:

             DO NOT ALLOW MENU
             DO HIDE
             DO KEY D1
             DO ALARM IN 13 HOURS, 35 MINUTES AND 27 SECONDS

     There are many more. It is also possible to write a series of
     commands into a file, similar to DOS batch files and have DO.EXE
     interpret them all.

     ControlD is much more than an interpreter, though. It allows you
     to password-protect DESQview windows, permit opening of windows
     only on certain days of the week, or to disable some or all
     menus each time a window is open, then re-enable them once the
     window is closed.

     When I wrote DVEXEC, the grandfather of ControlD, I stated in
     the docs this was my last shot on shareware. In all the years I
     have been posting my programs on bulletin boards, I only
     received one check, for $25, while I spent many thousands of
     dollars in the process. DVEXEC became an overnight sensation (it
     was file-requested all the way from Australia the day after I
     posted it on a BBS!). Not one person in the whole world
     registered the program.

     ControlD is my first commercial program. It will be "officially"
     released on March 15, and will cost $65. However, I will send it
     to any Fidonet sysop who orders it before March 15, 1990, for
     just $45, plus $5 S&H. I will be even willing to send it C.O.D.
     within the United States of America for an additional $4. In
     Pennsylvania, please add 6% sales tax.

     You can order ControlD by sending me a check for the appropriate
     sum (US currency only). In your letter please state your Fidonet
     zone:net/node number. You must be listed in current Fidonet
     nodelist to qualify for the sysop offer, and your order must be
     postmarked on or before March 15, 1990. Please make the checks
     payable to George Adam Stanislav. The address:

     MetroFire, 1:135/14

     MetroFire is no longer operating as a project of the
     Metro-Dade Fire & Rescue Department. It has moved and
     changed numbers.

     FidoNews 7-09                Page 16                  26 Feb 1990


     1:135/14 is now operated as a personal, hobby project from
     my home in Miami_FL_USA. The new number is 305-382-4016 and
     has been noted as such in the last four Nodelist issues.

     If you were a User of MetroFire, your records are still
     intact. The system still operates the same Echos and
     message and file areas. The general operation has not
     changed; only the place and telephone number. [grin]

     I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused
     anyone.

     TTFN.
     Chris
