                              Editorial
========================================================================
   A very quiet week this week with only two articles.  The
Germer incident seems to have gone away, as has the net 150
kafuffal.  Nothing left to fight about ... mmm.

   I wonder how much of the bickering that goes on in fidonet is
due to simple boredom?  It strikes me that there is very little
new happening in the net.  Perhaps one off the problems with
standards is that they also spell stagnation.  Policies have the
downside of preventing inovation.

CyberSmut, the Exon Bill, and Thee:
by Langston Goldfinch, SysOp of N.O.P.C.; Fido 1:396/17,
Psychotherapist by profession. (langston@nopc.org)

Warning, using a computer may hurt you. Or your kids. No doubt soon
after Gutenberg had his press, or Bell his phone, alarms went off among
the peasants. At my high school students were forbidden to watch
Television since it was a tool of Satan. Maybe they had something? At
least their answer was to not allow me to see it, rather than trying to
make television sets illegal. Well, if your psyche is tender, or you
project it upon your offspring, read on.

Second warning, this report deviates from previous style. I suppose it
is impossible to discuss anything without one's personality and values
sneaking through. Objectivity being, as someone said, the myth of
immaculate perception. So far my writings here have been instructional,
about using your BBS, etc. Here I wish to share with you my thinking and
concerns on an issue gaining public attention, namely the dark side of
online services, including your own BBS.

One common confusion exists on this subject: The meanings of
"censorship" and "editorializing". A policy of restricting content
enforced or based on Law is Censorship. The current standards in this
country (Liberal for the most part) are to Censor "Obscenity" but not
all offensive or erotic material. This produced our rating's system, and
"adults only" access for movies, etc. In my view "adults" should state
"juvenile" only, since that is what the material usually consists of,
but then that is my taste.

Three different types of activity raise concern.

a) The use of offensive language in public echoes.

This means not only "Carlin's Seven Forbidden Words", but usage of
epithets and derogatory terms in confrontational exchanges. Often the
moderator (many echoes have none) will admonish the "offender", and
usually can bar participation. Software is to remove words designated,
and/or "TWIT" a user. There is a problem with this, as Prodigy is
discovering. The moderator or BBS may be liable if they do not continue
to edit offensive, or libelous, material. Your SysOp's procedure is not
to edit content, but if a user proves to be unusually obnoxious to bar
his access to the system. This has been done for reasons other than
offense in language (attempting to damage the system, or in one occasion
to engage in possible criminal behavior, selling stolen goods.) The
"rules" of FidoNet (for example) consist of:

     1. Do not be unusually annoying. This would include repeated asking
     of questions, especially if in the manual!
     2. Do not be too easily annoyed. Give the other user a break!

FidoNet is our basic connection to BBSs world. Now connecting to UseNet
FidoNews 12-29                 Page:  3                    17 Jul 1995

has given us a much greater range. Estimates of actual numbers vary
widely. InterNet, being world wide, has no "rules" per se. Each user (or
Net) may be subject to various regulations due to their own system (a
University for example, or Country.) But for a user here to complain
that someone in Zambia broke some local rule?

Many echoes seem to operate solely for the availability of offense. Fido
echo FLAME exists for people to insult each other. These insults are
primitive and lack the finesse of the British Parliament. Other echoes
deal with topics likely to shock the average "normal" (you?) The names
of these echoes will usually warn, or entice, you. Be aware that
"Petting Zoo" is not about household pets! Sexual aberrations seem
particularly attractive to Americans and "civilized" Europeans, but I
understand that these offer nothing for third world countries. If you
live on a farm you don't need to read about some things.

b) The meeting of juveniles with possible pedophiles.

The Times-Picayune (New Orleans 6-12-95) reported a run-away girl (13)
found in California far from her Kentucky Home (no music here, please).
Apparently she "met" someone with her computer via an online service and
was "lured" away. The FBI urges parents to "be more careful about how
their children using computers". Gee, Dr. Spock used to give parenting
advice! A few months ago "boy" (18) met an older man in a chat room on
AOL. This daemon in Cyberspace sent him a bus ticket and he disappeared
into the sunset. The parents finally forced AOL to connect the son and
now "chat" with him online! Maybe they can raise the ante?  Whatever
happened to pen- pals and short wave? If Franda in Texas had sent me the
fare maybe I would have run for the border? Never crossed my mind till
today she may not have been anything like her picture!

There is not much that can be done to prevent these encounters if your
child has access to your modem. All online services offer total
strangers "talking" to each other. I showed my 12 year old the articles
mentioned above. She just snickered, like what kind of an idiot was the
girl anyway? Better parenting? Smug since it didn't happen to me.

I recall several years ago while setting up the BBS getting good
technical help from someone online. I finally had occasion to go by the
man's house. He came to the door (a few years younger than me) and I
said:

     "David?
     "What do you want with my son??" The man practically bit my head
     off!

The "expert" was only 14! I had no idea. In Cyberspace, you can be
whatever age you can muster, or weight, or gender for that matter! You
get measured by your ASCII alone. One user complained about being barred
from a BBS because of his "race". He got clobbered by the others on the
echo. Obviously, how are we to know his (her?) race. Of course one's
name can give matters away. Isn't Harry Lee related to Lighthorse Harry
Lee? (R.E.'s daddy, case you forgot).

c) The availability of Graphics that are "obscene".
FidoNews 12-29                 Page:  4                    17 Jul 1995


What about the dirty pitchers? (as Archie use to say!). The graphics
that upset some people are of three distinct kinds.

1-) My teen sexual fantasies began with bra and girdle ads in Sears'
catalogue. Hey! I had a deprived childhood! I still am a little nervous
if my mother is watching me scan Macy's or Bloomingdale's "erotica".
Most older men will understand me. What is available on K&B shelves
(Bikini pictorials) will do just fine, thank you! And what if some
pedophile gets his jollies watching Shirley Temple tap dance! Oh that
lace! Pretty hard pressed to object to the same thing on BBSs.

2-) Next level are the images not accessible to middle America. Go to
the roped off sections at the local News stand for example. Granted this
stuff is a little hard for juveniles to possess. About once a year I
love walking down Bourbon St. late at night. No longer do I gawk at the
shows. What now entices me are the tourists "shocked" by the shows!

     "Look at that Myrtle, it really a man, can you believe it!"

The InterNet also can educate about the back alley of the world.

3-) But what really upsets folks are the graphics (and they include
short "moving" pictures) that you won't find in current outlets in this
country, commercial or marginal.

I was watching one panel this morning arguing the Exon Bill. One person
 maintained that this "pornography" is readily available and easy to
 even inadvertently have slammed in your face. She proceeded to show a
 bondage picture on the screen. She lied, pure and simple, about how
 "easy" it is to get these pictures. It took me a week! Although not as
 precocious as the average 14 year old I do know something about how the
 system works. To make it short: you have to subscribe to the newsgroup
 (or mailing list) then you have to unencode the file then you have to
 run a graphics viewer capable of handling jpeg files. Now, think you
 can do it!

Recently in NYC I was walking up Broadway near Columbia Univ. A group
was demonstrating against what to them was "porno". Explicit photos from
Hustler Magazine (and such) got shoved in my face and I was asked to
sign a petition to make such stuff illegal.

"Where is was the petition to make what you are doing illegal!"

 Not really, I love street theater! Hypocrites! I avoid Flynt and his
 ilk, at least they are honest pornographers! The same strategy now used
 by the Family Resource Center and other pro- censorship groups. If the
 material is evidence of a crime then arrest the criminals for the
 crime, not the picture. But don't shove the picture in my face.

Legislation is currently on hold at the Federal level (The
Senate Committee is redrawing the Law.  Advocacy groups, pro and con,
will be airing their views and fanning their flames. Like most
discussions concerning this media, a good deal of ignorance prevails.
The concerns are: How to protect children from InterLewd?, or at least
FidoNews 12-29                 Page:  5                    17 Jul 1995

from negligent parents? Our own grand state also had a bill up for
consideration. The effect of this bill would have been similar to
charging phone executives with a crime should you receive an obscene
call. This bill also is on hold.

Even without new laws people get arrested and go to jail, for making
some material available online. One man I met got arrested in Lawton
Oklahoma by a crusading District Attorney. The "crime" involved selling
CD-Roms that any of you can buy from ads in Computer Shopper. He was
advertising these on his BBS. Unfortunately the images shocked the local
Jury. He has lost his business, his house, his family; just like Job!
Although on appeal he wants to go to jail and get it behind him. Now if
I were in Singapore I wouldn't spit on the sidewalk, and I have no
intention of testing our District Attorney's political disposition.
Would be odd to pick on local BBSs however, with Bourbon Street so wide
open! Some of you may remember the fracas about the nude Thais a few
years back!

I realize this controversy has been going on since Comstock was a baby
and nothing I say is likely to change any of your minds. As SysOp of
your BBS you should know (I think) what my values and policies are. On
the few echoes I moderate (NOPC being quite active) I have no rules at
all. Any member user can say what they wish. If someone offends, tell
them. If someone hurts your feelings, deal with it. If you need my help
in suggesting ways to protect and take care of yourself I will give it.
If you try anything criminal you will find your access cut. If you
offend me then consider yourself among an elite, very few have
succeeded! If anything here has offended you then maybe I have not
explained myself clearly enough, or maybe, just maybe, you are too
easily annoyed.

In the mean time don't look for extreme graphics on your BBS. If you
have the yearning contact me privately and I will tell you where to
search and how. Frankly, graphics, also called binaries, take too much
space on the hard drives. They also tie up the system, too much time
downloading. I know one or two of you have downloaded all the swimsuit
pitchers, you could have gone to K&B and bought them! Secondly, with
100,000 messages a day coming into our system there is absolutely no way
for me protect your children. Do it yourselves. We do keep logs for a
week or so (again, space), and if you wish I will send any member copies
to check whatever you wish. Don't ask me to do it. Behave on echoes as
if you were in person, if in doubt about proper way to handle matters
read Ms. Manners, she is definitive.

Subject: Request for Info
Request for info on Kimberlin

Greetings, netters.  This is an unusual article for FidoNews:  I'm
looking for anyone who has text files on Kimberlin, the political
prisoner sent to jail for some drug related crime but kept their for
political reasons.  It seems he sold pot to Dan Quayle or some such.

All I can recall on the case was that Amnesty International
registered him as a political prisoner and newspapers and magazines
around the country took minor interest.

If anyone has any info, I would be thankful to recieve it.  I don't
know _any_ of the particulars nor do I know whether he's been released
yet.

Thanks in advance.
