Editorial: Nothing

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

This may be the shortest issue yet of FidoNews, at least since I've been
editoring it. And I haven't got much to say to lengthen.

ARTSPEC.DOC: can you believe, I still don't have a copy. Thom Henderson
tried to send me a copy, but for some (technical) reason, our two
programs aren't talking. Anyone else have a copy?

re: the historical rant of mine, a few issues back: my my, it's
surprising the amount of anger out there at the so-called "bullies
running the net", the phrase used in more than one letter, and none of
them were hateful rants/flames... people are pissed! I too don't like
the structure. Heirarchy was supposed to stay in the logical addressing
scheme, not in the social structure...

To satisfy my own curiosity, I started writing down what I would
consider the minimum rules for "all of us". I've had surprising results.
It's short (130 lines right now, will be condensed to under 100 I think)
and if it still looks sensible to me in a few weeks, I'll run it as an
article. (I love hate mail.)

A LISTING OF KNOWN OTHERNETS

Last Updated: 11/23/91

Hello, it's been awhile since I submitted this list to Fidonews.
I appreciate all the assistance and help you've been giving me on
this continuing project!  If you're not already linked in, please
join us in the OTHERNETS echomail conference, which has just been
officially placed on the Fidonet Backbone!  This should make it
more generally available to those of you who are interested.

Things have changed a bit.  FREQing and maintaining the various
nodelists was a time consuming, expensive and a hassle, so instead
I've decided it's better to collect INFORMATION files.  Hope you
find them useful!

The list is now divided into two parts... networks that reside in
zones (and maintain a nodelist) and networks that do not reside in
a zone (for example, file distribution networks, networks that are
composed of a specialized set of echos within Fidonet, etc).

The curent copy of this textfile is file-requestable as NETSALL.ART.
You might also try FREQing FILES for a complete listing off all the
OtherNet info files I carry (9600 HST DS w/V32b, V42b, Mail-only,
Front Door, 24 hrs).

Rebuttal to "A view from the outside, by Jonathan Guy"
by William Westlake (A Grunt SysOp) 1:202/326

 I have been "Modeming" for a number of years but have been
involved in Networks for only a short time. I have started and
am running my own network, in many ways similar to FidoNet. When
I started my own NET I felt to some degree like Mr. Guy, that
rules needed to be limited or almost non-existent. I quickly
discovered the difficulties in this.

FidoNews 8-47                  Page 5                      25 Nov 1991


 I did not take Mr. Guy's article as a flame and I hope he does
not take this one as a Flame. It is true that Fido has rules and
some people don't like them. I have noticed that MOST people
accept them for exactly what they are. They are an attempt to
bring some degree of structure and orderliness to s system that
can quickly and easily turn into chaos. No doubt they can be
improved as all things can. I have yet to meet any *C's that are
POWER HUNGRY in any way. People who want POWER don't play games
with amerature networks.

 There are a great many people who don't want rules at all.
They believe that FREEDOM means to DO WHAT THEY WANT PERIOD.
Rules are a good thing and I am quite glad that fido has them.
Mr. Guy should try to run and organize ANYTHING with no rules and
see how successful he is.

 As for politics, huh? They exist in any organization that has
people! If you don't see any politics then some is missing,
either people or ORGANIZATION <GRIN>......

 As for taking it seriously? Well it can be a serious business.
People don't need to depend upon something for their lively hood
for it to be serious. If you compare what we do to other
telecommunications like HAM radio the rules we have to deal with
are MINOR by comparison. If we were to eliminate all rules then
it would only be a matter of time before the government stepped
in and imposed it's own set.

 In short, I don't think there is a single *C that believes the
Fido Net policy to be perfect, it can be improved and will be in
time. Have some patients with these things and remember that the
*C's are doing all of us a GREAT service by what they do FOR
FREE. I know I am a *C in my own NET....

A Message From 4:4/50, The WorldPol Project:

                  UPDATE ON WORLDPOL DISTRIBUTION
                     Four Zones Already Linked

The WORLDPOL echo, for those interested in participating in the
development of the WorldPol proposal to serve as FidoNet policy,
has expanded its distribution to two more zones. Here is the
current distribution scheme, worldwide:

FidoNews 8-47                  Page 6                      25 Nov 1991


Zone-1: WorldPol is being gated by the IDS and is distributed
independently by 1:128/77, 1:133/411, 1:142/928, 1:157/603,
1:250/99 and 1:273/909. You can request a feed from any of these
systems or from your echomail coordinator if you are in Region 12
(Eastern Canada).

Zone-2: WorldPol is now being gated to Europe by Noel Bradford in
London, England. Please contact him at 2:257/102 for a feed.

Zone-4: WorldPol is being gated by the IDS and is available all
throughout the official echomail distribution system in Zone-4.
Any inquires can be addressed to 4:900/202.

Zone-6: WorldPol is now being gated to Asia by Honlin Lue in
Taipei, Taiwan. Please contact him at 6:720/13 for a feed.

NOTICE -- If you have trouble getting a feed from any of the
aforementioned nodes, please send net-mail to the moderator of
WORLDPOL, Pablo Kleinman, at 1:102/631.

This echo is open to everyone interested in collaborating with
the proposal to replace FidoNet Policy, known as WORLDPOL 2b.

We are working to further its distribution to the remaining two
