     Greetings,

     Summer has started in this part of the world and only yesterday
     it was reported that snow was expected on some of the higher
     mountains ranges in the eastern part of South Africa.
     Snow this time of the year?  Strange things have happened in the
     past, but this takes the cake.

     Have been busy with many things this past week, including my
     regular job, which left me with very little time to do things
     I needed to do.

     Enjoy reading what there is this week.

     Summary of backbone echo changes during Sep & Oct.

     Brought to you courtesy of (unix) diff.

     Note: The North American Backbone has changed the format of its
           areafix compatible lists. Backbone.na now lists all NAB
           backbone echos. The backbone.no list has been discontinued.
           Echos that are in jeopardy because of low traffic or an
           expired Elist entry are listed in Section 3 of the weekly
           backstat.na.

     Feed Cuts vs. Message Filtering
     by Jerry Schwartz, 1:142/928

     In last week's FidoNews, Gordon Lewicky made an impassioned
     statement against feed cuts and in favor of "culling" offensive
     posters' messages from echos.  Unfortunately, I think he's
     heading down a wrong and very dangerous path.

     If a nuisance poster is denied the ability to post in an echo by
     a sysop, his or her messages simply don't exist -- anywhere.
     However, the proposed culling action would by definition happen
     when the sysop does not agree to restrict access to the echo; so
     the culling would have to occur at one or more other systems.

     At the very least, this presumes that suitable software is
     universally available; but there is a worse problem.  Once
     specific messages are being filtered out on certain systems (and
     possibly not on other systems), it will quickly become obvious
     because there will be replies and side comments which won't be
     filtered out.  We have enough problems tracking down broken links
     without introducing the appearance of broken links deliberately.

     A more insidious problem is that the widespread, sanctioned use
     of such techniques would provide cover for unsanctioned use.
     "My, oh my, did I accidentally put your name in my filter?  I'll
     fix that first thing a week from Tuesday."

     I don't think any of us want to see that.

     Fidonet over IP, Part 4 of 4:

     Policy aspects about IP-Nodes

     Copyright 1998 by Lothar Behet

     Part 1 and 2 in FidoNews issue contained a definition of
     Fidonet-over-IP and the available software.
     Part 3 was dedicated to possibilities of and actual proposals
     for integration of ip-nodes
     
     1. Basics (again :)

     Let us take a look on requirements for conventional nodes at first
     (excerpts from the Fidonet policy 4.07):

     ---

     1.3.2  Geography
     Each level of FidoNet is geographically contained by the level
     immediately above it.  A given geographic location is covered by
     one zone and one region within that zone, and is either in one
     network or not in a network. There are never two zones, two
     regions, or two networks which cover the same geographic area.

     ---

     1.3.3  Zone Mail Hour
     Zone Mail Hour (ZMH) is a defined time during which all nodes in a
     zone are required to be able to accept netmail. Each Fidonet zone
     defines a ZMH and publishes the time of its ZMH to all other
     Fidonet zones.  See sections 2.1.8 and 10.2.

     ---

     2.1.8  Exclusivity of Zone Mail Hour
     Zone Mail Hour is the heart of FidoNet, as this is when network
     mail is passed between systems.  Any system which wishes to be a
     part of FidoNet must be able to receive mail during this time
     using the protocol defined in the current FidoNet Technical
     Standards Committee publication (FTS-0001 at this writing).
     It is permissible to have greater capability (for example, to
     support additional protocols or extended mail hours), but the
     minimum requirement is FTS-0001 capability during this one hour
     of the day.

     ---

     2.1.9  Private Nodes
     The rare exception to ZMH compliance is private nodes.  Persons
     requesting private nodes should be supported as points if
     possible.  A private listing is justified when the system must
     interface with many others, such as an echomail distributor.
     In these cases, the exact manner and timing of mail delivery is
     arranged between the private node and other systems. Such an
     agreement between a private system and a hub is not binding on

     FIDONEWS 15-45               Page 5                    9 Nov 1998

     any replacement for that hub.  A private node must be a part of
     a network (they cannot be independents in the region.)

     Private listings impact each member of FidoNet, since they take up
     space in everyone's nodelist.  Private listings which are for the
     convenience of one sysop (at the expense of every other sysop in
     FidoNet) are a luxury which is no longer possible.  Non-essential
     redundant listings (more than one listing for the same telephone
     number, except as mandated by FTSC standards) also fall into this
     category.  Sysops requesting private or redundant listings must
     justify them with a statement explaining how they benefit the
     local net or FidoNet as a whole.  The Network Coordinator or
     Regional Coordinator may review this statement at any time and
     listings which are not justified will be removed.

     ---

     10.2  Timing of Zone Mail Hour
     Zone Mail Hour is observed each day, including weekends and
     holidays. The time is based upon Universal Coordinated Time
     (UTC), also known as Greenwich Mean time (GMT). In areas which
     observe Daylight Savings Time during part of the year, the local
     time of zone mail hour will change because FidoNet does not
     observe Daylight Savings Time. The exact timing of Zone Mail Hour
     is set for each zone by the Zone Coordinator.

     In FidoNet Zone 1, Zone Mail Hour is observed from 0900 to 1000 UTC.
     In each of the time zones, this is:
         Eastern Standard Time          4 AM to 5 AM
         Central Standard Time          3 AM to 4 AM
         Mountain Standard Time         2 AM to 3 AM
         Pacific Standard Time          1 AM to 2 AM

     FIDONEWS 15-45               Page 6                    9 Nov 1998


         Hawaii Standard Time          11 PM to Midnight

     In FidoNet Zone 2, Zone Mail Hour is observed from 0230 to 0330 UTC.
     In Fidonet Zone 3, Zone Mail Hour is observed from 1800 to 1900 UTC.
     In each of the time Zones involved this is:

       GMT +12 Zone                        6:00 AM to 7:00 AM
       (New Zealand)

     Each Coordinator (i.e. RC, ZC) is responsible for his part the
     nodelist data, which at last is the "phonebook" of Fidonet.
     It contains the required data for a possible direct session
     between any two nodes, as long as they use the same technology
     (certain analog modems, ISDN, IP in the future).

     ---

     The requirement of FTS-0001 handshake protocol may be relativated,
     as FTS-0001, Chapter H leaves room for future development over
     non-dial nets, which might include a modified handshaking
     procedure.

     ---

     Availability for direct calls from any other node

     Internet connections have one thing in common with ISDN-nodes:
     They can only be accessed with the same type of technology,
     while both are incompatible to each other and to conventional
     PSTN-nodes.

     Since 1993 ISDN-nodes are included in the nodelist with their
     special flags and most of them run at least one additional
     analog line or use specialized terminal adpaters, which support
     conventional calls via ISDN as transport layer as a combined node.

     ---

     In fact, there are 3 major points for assigning a node number:
     ZMH (Zone Mail Hour), geography and FTS-0001.

     FIDONEWS 15-45               Page 8                    9 Nov 1998

     2. Effects for IP-Nodes?

     The internet acting as additional carrier for FTN-compatible
     sessions is in fact a non-dial-net, mostly formed of a huge
     mass of permanent communication paths.
     Only the individual session between any two nodes requires both
     systems availability for that duration, so that even dial-in
     users may run Fidonet over ip.

     The timeslice may be ZMH or any other clearly stated online-time
     (i.e. published via T-flags in the nodelist), as long as ZMH is
     included in it. So there is no need for an in most countries
     quite expensive permanent connection to the internet to maintain
     CM-capability (Continues Mail), as this may be realized using
     callback capabilities for the internet connection.

     There is no easy resolution for geography within the internet, as
     neither the ip number nor the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
     are bound directly to geographical definitions. Even a system with
     a certain FQDN (i.e. www.fidonet.org, fido.nrh.de) might be hosted
     in the USA or any other country.
     This concludes, that the geographical position is bound to the
     sysop home site and this assigns his membership to a certain net
     in the sense of Fidonet.

     FTS-0001 defines all aspects of a certain handshake procedure
     between two nodes, focused on a conventional dial-net via
     telephone lines.
     While Chapter H leaves room for future developments, the strict
     accordance to the FTS-0001 procedure should be thought over again.
     The internet as a carrier medium can not guarantee for a minimum
     bandwidth for a certain session neither for calculatable response

     FIDONEWS 15-45               Page 9                    9 Nov 1998

     times.

     This makes a strict FTS-0001 sessions under certain circumstances
     unreliable or even impossible, as its definition of timeouts is
     insufficient for slow connections via certain parts of the
     internet, especially when satellite links are included on some
     parts of the routing path.

     This uncalculatable response behaviour is considered in some
     modern protocols especially designed for transfer of data via the
     internet (i.e. BinkP), while it still allows the authentification
     based on the fidonet nodelist data. There might be developed other
     variants for fidonet-over-ip in the future, which should be taken
     into consideration, as long as they are publicly available.

     3. Some practical experiences
     As I was one of the early ip-nodes in fidonet, i use strict
     fidonet-over-ip since more than one year. Therefore i especially
     included the chapter about FTS-0001 relativity in this article,
     as BinkP does not fulfill it, but certain connections are really
     impossible with FTS-0001 via telnet or Vmodem.

     Within this year, i saw many nodes announcing ip-capabilities for
     fidonet use, but some them disappeared without any further notice.
     So many lists of ip-nodes (in the future even my own one) are
     unreliable, as long as they are not maintained regularly.

     Other transport protocols:
     FTP does not require the nodelist for authenfication of a
     sessions, is it is a completely closed definition of its own as
     one of the standard functions in the internet.
     Email-based methods generally do not require any direct,
     
     FIDONEWS 15-45               Page 10                   9 Nov 1998

     authentificated session between the recipants.

     4. Conclusion

     An IP-node may be a "legal" part of Fidonet, as long as his system
     is available at least at ZMH.
     His system must support a direct handshaking session over ip,
     while nodelist data is used for calling and authentification.
     He belongs to a certain geographical net, based on his home site
     and his NC handles his nodelist entry in a responsible manner.

     Additional protocols should be considered as announcable, as some
     interested people might use it without installation of a complete
     node-system software package for easy participation within fidonet
     below the node-status.

     In my proposal (see part 3) I considered all of the above aspects,
     including the possible future developments, which might not be
     calculated completely at this time.

     The the nomenclature of the flags with an leading "I" just shows
     any node directly the participation of a special class (comparable
     to Vxxx for ISDN nodes, Hxx for Hst, Zxx for Zyxel), the official
     definition of ip-flags is more important than their optical
     design.
