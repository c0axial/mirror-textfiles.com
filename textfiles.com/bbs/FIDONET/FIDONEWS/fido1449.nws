     =================================================================

     The ZEC election is getting underway. The sizeable details are
     contained below.

     The FidoNet World Wide Webring has just passed 80 sites! Details on
     joining are in the Masthead info at the end of every Issue.

     If your Net, Region, or Zone has a webpage, don't forget to send the
     complete URL to me at any of the addresses listed in each Issue. Only
     Region and Zone listings appear in these pages but those and Nets do
     appear on the FidoNews Editor page at:

       http://ddi.digital.net/~cbaker84/fidonews.html

     and you'd be surprised at the number of inquiries I get every week
     from that site and its Guestbook looking for links to various
     countries or areas and wanting to join or rejoin FidoNet. The Internet
     does serve a purpose for FidoNet membership. [grin]

     For those of you looking for Internet access to FidoNews, check out
     the Masthead for instructions to sign up for either an email
     subscription or a filesend each week. FidoNews still doesn't get to
     every Node via the Coordinator structure as it is supposed to be
     distributed. [sigh]

     Otherwise, the same old arguments flourish in Echomail and we still
     have no International Coordinator.

     Subject: Slow death

     Dear editor:

     In the article of 14-48 Fidonet Dies a slow death, I would like to add
     my .02 worth.

     The CRP is IMHO a minor factor in whether I keep running or not, the
     major factor is:  Is FidoNet still fun?  For me it is still fun.  The
     second consideration is are the people in my community using my
     system?  Nope I am lucky to have 10 callers a month, when I used to
     have 20-25 per day.  The people here are just not interested enough to
     call a BBS they would just as soon cruise the net.  I had hoped to be
     one of the last FidoNet systems out there, but alas I may not be.

     For most of us sysops the decision to shut down is not taken lightly,
     it is agonizing, for a coupe in my former Net they spent many a
     sleepless night with the decision to shut down.  After all it is a
     part of our lives.

     The other consideration is when some of the boards shut down there is
     a temporary cut in the mail feed, and this screws things up royally.

     Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator Election Official Announcement
     by Martin Belcke 1:232/10, 1:232/16, mbelcke@ws02.irvbbs.com

     To The Members of Fidonet, Zone 1.

     In compliance with a directive from the Zone 1 Coordinator, an
     election for the position of Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator has
     commenced.  The Region Echomail Coordinator Council (RECC) was charged
     by the Z1C with the task of organizing the election process.  In the
     process of discharging that endeavor, the RECC was faced with several
     tasks, among which included the duties of the Z1EC, selecting an
     election coordinator, defining the rules for the election and setting
     the time-frame for the election.

     The first task (defining the duties of the Z1EC) was accomplished with
     input from the Z1 RECC and members of Fidonet, Zone 1.  Those duties
     are as follows:

                          ***** BEGIN  DUTIES *****

     At the pleasure of the Z1C, the duties for the Z1EC shall be:

     1) Coordination between the Z1 echomail distribution systems

     2) Coordination of the RECC and with the Zone 1 RECs.

     The ZEC is the chairperson of the RECC.  He or she shall bring ideas
     to the RECC and moderate the discussion of ideas. He or she shall also
     act as a tie breaker in the event of a tie vote. The RECC may overturn
     a ZEC proposed action or idea with a 2/3rds vote of the RECC.

     If the RECC concludes that the ZEC is not active, ineffective in his
     or her job or not taking care his or her responsibilities per this
     list;  they may take a vote of no-confidence. If the vote of no-
     confidence passes with 2/3rds majority, the RECC will refer this issue
     to the Z1C for mediation or action as the Z1C sees fit.

     The ZEC shall be allowed to take issue with RECs that are not
     participating or doing their job, by taking the matter up with the
     host RC of the REC's region and the Z1C for mediation or action.

     These two actions shall NOT be taken lightly without all due
     consideration of possible extenuating circumstances.

     3) Coordination with the other ZECs.

     4) Central repository of information for the various Z1 distribution
        systems.

     5) Mediation of Zone 1 echomail issues/disputes.

     6) Upper level mediation between Moderators, Fidonet distribution
     FIDONEWS 14-49               Page 4                    8 Dec 1997


        systems on related echomail issues.

     7) Coordination with the Echolist Keeper.

     8) Help in the formation and implementation of a Zone/Fido-wide
        Echomail policy. The ZEC shall work in conjunction with the RECC on
        this issue, so that the REC's can take this information to their
        respective regions for feedback.

     9) Term(s) of no more than 2 years.  No limit on number of terms

     10) Codify, with the RECC, the procedure for future ZEC elections.
         All future elections are subject to review by the Z1C.

     11) Provide for an interim Z1EC, should anything happen to currently
         seated Z1EC to prevent him/her from fulfilling these duties. The
         single duty of the interim Z1EC shall be to expedite an election
         and the smooth transition to the next Z1EC. The interim ZEC shall
         refer to the Z1C for help with problems if the RECC cannot resolve
         said issue(s).

                          ***** END OF DUTIES *****

     The second task (selecting an election coordinator) was accomplished
     with input from the Z1 RECC and members of Fidonet, Zone 1.  The
     election coordinator selected is Martin Belcke (1:232/10 and also
     1:232/16).  An assistant to the election coordinator was also
     selected.  The assistant is Lisa Gronke (1:105/16).

     The third task (election rules) was accomplished by the election
     coordinator with input from the Z1 RECC and members of Fidonet, Zone
     1, by posting draft copies of election rules in the REC's
     administrative echo, as well as posting draft copies in the public
     election echo Z1_ELECTION.  Following discussion, the election rules
     were modified as needed until a final draft was presented to the RECC
     and the Z1C for approval.

     The result of the vote was as follows:

     Approved: Z1C, REC10, REC11, REC12, REC14, REC15, REC17, REC18
     Against : REC13, REC19
     Abstain : NONE
     No Vote : REC16

     The rules for the Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator election are:

                          ******** BEGIN  RULES ********

             The following rules are in affect for the Zone 1 Echomail
                              Coordinator election.

     1) NOMINATIONS

     Any member of Fidonet Zone 1 may nominate any member of Fidonet Zone 1
     for the position of Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator. The nomination may be
     made by netmail (direct or routed), may be posted in the Z1_ELECTION
     FIDONEWS 14-49               Page 5                    8 Dec 1997


     echo, or may be sent by any other method at the discretion of the
     election coordinator. Nominations must be addressed to the election
     coordinator and must include the name and node number of the person
     making the nomination and the name and node number of the proposed
     candidate.  Any nomination that does not contain the above information
     will be declared invalid.  Any nomination received by the election
     coordinator via any method, other than posted in the Z1_ELECTION echo,
     will be posted in the Z1_ELECTION echo by the election coordinator.
     This shall serve as acknowledgment of receipt by the election
     coordinator of the nomination.

     Once a nomination has been received by the election coordinator, the
     proposed candidates name will be added to the list of prospective
     candidates.  This list will be posted from time to time in the
     Z1_ELECTION echo showing the status of the nomination.

     Any member of Fidonet Zone 1 may second a nomination for the position
     of Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator.  The second may be made by netmail
     (direct or routed), may be posted in the Z1_ELECTION echo, or may be
     sent by any other method at the discretion of the election
     coordinator.  Seconds must be addressed to the election coordinator
     and must include the name and node number of the person making the
     second and the name and node number of the proposed candidate.  Any
     second that does not contain the above information will be declared
     invalid. Any nomination received by the election coordinator via any
     method, other than posted in the Z1_ELECTION echo, will be posted in
     the Z1_ELECTION echo by the election coordinator. This shall serve as
     acknowledgment of receipt by the election coordinator of the second.

     In the event that the election coordinator receives two nominations
     for the same person, the first one received shall be considered the
     nomination and any subsequent received shall be considered the second.

     Once a nomination, or second, has been received by the election
     coordinator, that nomination, or second, cannot be revoked by the
     nominator or seconder.

     The proposed candidate must acknowledge acceptance of the nomination
     by sending a message via netmail (direct or routed), by posting an
     acceptance in the Z1_ELECTION echo, or by any other method at the
     discretion of the election coordinator. The acceptance must be
     received by the election coordinator prior to the beginning of the
     campaign period.  Any acknowledgment received by the election
     coordinator via any method, other than posted in the Z1_ELECTION echo,
     will be posted in the Z1_ELECTION echo by the election coordinator.
     This shall serve as acknowledgment of receipt by the election
     coordinator of the acceptance.

     At the conclusion of the nomination period, the election coordinator
     shall post a list of all duly nominated, seconded, and accepted
     candidates.  These shall be the only candidates eligible for election.

     The proposed candidate must appear in the Fidonet nodelist as
     published prior to the beginning of the nomination period. Allowance
     for errors in the nodelist may be made at the discretion of the
     election coordinator, but in all cases, a valid Fidonet nodelist must
     FIDONEWS 14-49               Page 6                    8 Dec 1997


     be used.


     2) CAMPAIGN PERIOD

     Following the nomination period, a period shall be allowed for each
     candidate to campaign for the position.  During this period,
     questioning of the candidates is encouraged.  Flaming of the
     candidates is discouraged and may result in action accordingly by the
     moderator of Z1_ELECTION.  The campaign period is to be civil.  This
     includes candidates.  Discuss the issues.


     3) VOTING PERIOD

     Following the campaign period, a period shall be allowed for each
     eligible voter to cast his/her vote. Votes must be sent via direct
     netmail to the election coordinator, or by any other method at the
     discretion of the election coordinator. Votes must be sent during the
     voting period and must include a keyword/password, name and node of
     the person voting (as it appears in the Fidonet nodelist) and the name
     of one of the candidates on the election slate.  If preferential
     balloting is being used, then more than one candidate may be listed in
     order of preference.  Any vote received that does not contain the
     above information will be declared invalid and the ballot will not be
     counted.  Any vote cast that uses a method not approved will be
     declared invalid and the ballot will not be counted.

     Any vote received prior to or after the voting period shall be
     disallowed.  The election coordinator shall acknowledge each vote by
     netmail (direct or routed), or by any other method at the discretion
     of the election coordinator, with a simple statement that the vote has
     been received and recorded.

     In the event there are more than two candidates, the voting method
     shall be that of preferential balloting.

     Any member of Fidonet, Zone 1 is eligible to vote, under the following
     criteria.  Nodes beginning with the keyword of ZONE, REGION, HOST,
     HUB, or DOWN or nodes that are redundant entries are not eligible.
     One vote for sysops with more than one node.  One vote for nodes with
     more than one person listed at that node.  Nodes listed as PVT or HOLD
     are eligible.

     The Fidonet nodelist published prior to the beginning of the voting
     period shall be the primary nodelist to determine eligible voters.
     Allowance for errors in the nodelist may be made by the election
     coordinator, but at all times a valid Fidonet nodelist must be used.


     4) TALLYING OF VOTES

     Following the voting period, the election coordinator shall tally the
     votes, verifying any vote that is questionable by netmail (direct or
     routed) or by any other method available, at the discretion of the
     election coordinator, until the election coordinator is satisfied that
     FIDONEWS 14-49               Page 7                    8 Dec 1997


     all votes have been correctly identified and recorded.  The results of
     the election shall then be sent to the Zone 1 Coordinator for his
     approval.  The Zone 1 Coordinator may overturn the election at his
     discretion.  If the Zone 1 Coordinator does not overturn the election,
     the election coordinator shall announce the results of the election in
     the Z1_ELECTION echo by posting the keyword/password and vote.  At no
     time shall the election coordinator divulge the name or node number
     directly associated with the keyword/password without the approval of
     the Zone 1 Coordinator.

     NOTE: For clarification purposes:  The posting of the results would
     consist of no less than two messages, one containing an alphabetic
     listing of keywords/passwords with associated vote and the other
     containing a numerical listing (by node number) of those who voted.
     The two lists would not be directly associated.

     In the event a tie vote occurs, the Zone 1 Coordinator shall break the
     tie or may remand the election to a run-off between the candidates who
     received the most number of votes.


     5) CONTESTING OF VOTES

     Following the tallying of the vote, a period shall be allowed for
     contesting of the vote.  A valid contest must be sent via netmail
     (routed or direct) or by any other means available, at the discretion
     of the election coordinator. The contest must be sent to the election
     coordinator and must state the grounds for contesting the vote.  The
     election coordinator shall issue a decision pertaining to the contest,
     remanding the decision to the Region Echomail Coordinator Council for
     action.  After the RECC has voted, by clear majority vote of the REC's
     who vote, the election coordinator shall remand the action to the Zone
     1 Coordinator for final action and shall announce the result of the
     contest in the Z1_ELECTION echo.

     At the conclusion of the period for contesting, if no valid contest
     has been received, the election coordinator shall declare the election
     process concluded and remand the results to the Zone 1 Coordinator for
     final action.

     The fourth task (time-frame for the election) was accomplished by
     presenting a suggested time-frame to the RECC and the members of
     Fidonet, Zone 1, for approval.  After discussion of the suggested

     The following are the only valid methods for messages directed to the
     election coordinator for the Z1EC election being held from December 8,
     1997 through March 3, 1998.

     NOTE:  DIRECT netmail is the only method that guarantees that the
     message arrives at its destination the same as sent.  Routed netmail
     is, at best, taking a chance that the message will not arrive, or may
     be altered in transit.

     Echomail addressed TO: Martin Belcke posted in Z1_ELECTION Echomail
     addressed TO: Election Coordinator posted in Z1_ELECTION NOTE:
     Echomail voting is not allowed.

     Direct netmail to Election Coordinator 1:232/16
     Routed netmail to Election Coordinator 1:232/16

     Internet e-mail to  mbelcke@ws02.irvbbs.com (preferred)
     Internet e-mail to  mbelcke@irvbbs.com
     Internet e-mail to  Martin.Belcke@irvbbs.com
     Internet e-mail to  election.coordinator@irvbbs.com

     Subject line should indicate either NOMINATION, SECOND, ACCEPTANCE,
     BALLOT or PROTEST.  If you use the above method, it will make it a lot
     easier for the election coordinator and would be appreciated.

     NOTE:  All messages must contain the following information in order to
     be considered a valid message:

     1)  Node number of person sending message, as it appears in the
         applicable Fidonet nodelist.

     2)  Name of person sending message, as it appears in the applicable
         Fidonet nodelist.

     FIDONEWS 14-49               Page 9                    8 Dec 1997


     3)  If a nomination or second, items 1 and 2 and the node number and
         name, as it appears in the applicable Fidonet nodelist of the
         person being nominated or seconded.

     4)  If a vote, items 1 and 2 as well as a keyword/password and a valid
         candidate name.  If preferential balloting is being used, then a
         list of candidates in order of preference.

     5)  If a protest, items 1 and 2 as well as specific details of the
         grounds of the protest.

     For Nominations:

     Anything that even looks close to a message addressed to the election
     coordinator that has been posted in the Z1_ELECTION echo would be
     considered, as long as the message contains the required information.
     I do not plan to try and second guess anyone as to whom they are
     referring when making a nomination, nor do I plan to have to look up a
     name in the nodelist to determine the node number.  If the required
     information is not in the nomination, then it is not a valid
     nomination and would so be stated, thus allowing the person to make
     the nomination again, if within the applicable time-frame.

     Following the CONTESTING PERIOD, if no valid contest has been
     received, the final outcome of the election process is to be announced
     in the Z1_ELECTION echo, and any other echos as necessary, as well as
     in the FIDONEWS.

     Please turn on the echo Z1_ELECTION so that you may be able to
     participate in the election process.  All members of Fidonet, Zone 1
     are eligible to participate.  During the election process, the
     moderatorship of the Z1_ELECTION echo will be handled by Lisa Gronke
     (1:105/16) as the ELISTed moderator is also the election coordinator.

     This announcement is respectfully submitted to you, the members of
     Fidonet, Zone 1, and serves as the official announcement of the
     election process for Fidonet Zone 1 Echomail Coordinator.  Thank you
     for your time and look forward to seeing you participate in the
     election.

     FIDONET IN EUROPE
     -----------------
     by Dave Meikle (2:258/69.2 , 2:258/69.69 &
     rebeljambo@unforgettable.com)

     Nothing much happening apart from five more people joining Astrowars.
     Check out Fidonet on the internet featured last week on www.track-
     one.co.uk . If you only have internet email access view it by using
     www by email here are the instructions :

              WORLD-WIDE WEB BY E-MAIL

                            ------------------------

     You can retrieve WWW documents by e-mail using
     an Agora WWW-mail server.

     All you need to know is the Uniform Resource Locator (or URL, that
     long ugly string starting with "http:", "gopher:", or "ftp:") which
     defines the address of the document, and you can retrieve it by
     sending e-mail to one of:

        agora@dna.affrc.go.jp        (Japan)
        agora@kamakura.mss.co.jp     (Japan)
        agora@info.lanic.utexas.edu  (USA)
        agora@mx.nsu.nsk.su          (Russia ONLY)
        agora@www.undp.org           (restricted to "developing" countries)
        agora@mail.w3.org            (out of service)

     In the body of your note include one of these lines, replacing "<URL>"
     with the actual URL specification.

        send <URL>
        rsend <return-address> <URL>         (override your return address)

     This will send you back the document you requested, with a list of all
     the documents referenced within, so that you may make further
     requests.

     To try WWW by e-mail send the following commands to an Agora server :

        www
        send http://www.w3.org

     You'll receive in due course the Agora help file and the "WWW Welcome
     Page" which will include references to other Web documents you'll want
     to explore.

     THERE ARE SOME OTHER WWW mail servers...

     Note: The WWW-mail servers are sometimes unavailable for days (or

     reply, please retry in a day or so.

     That's all folks!

     Hello All Sysops & Co_Sysops:

     What is the biggest problem on fidonet these days?  Most Sysops are
     leaving fidonet and going on the internet.  Well if you want to get
     more users on your BBS I suggest you request the WRESTLING_CHAT  on
     your BBS.

     The WRESTLING_CHAT provide all the latest news, rumors, Scoops and
     Upcoming events in the Wrestling world.  Plus the users can enjoy
     chatting about the sport with other great wrestling fans.  The
     WRESTLING_CHAT provide a great atmosphere for the users on your BBS.

     If you need additional information please contact me either on my
     fidonet or internet address.  Please have a Merry Christmas and a
     Happy New Year.

     Thank you

     Emanuel  Fidonet 1:348/963
