     There are quite a lot if us here.  About a thousand  sysops,  and
     at  least  ten  times that many users.  Many of us have gotten to
     know each other quite well.  This is  quite  amazing;  especially
     when you consider that few of us have ever met.

     We  know  each  other by the words we type.  We see each other as
     little dots of light  forming  text  on  our  screens.  Sometimes
     those  words  are misleading.  Sarcasm doesn't carry well through
     modems, and bit streams don't carry facial expressions.

     None of this is new.  We all know it (though we may  forget  from
     time to time).

     The  difference  is that now we can change that.  At least a bit,
     for a little while.

     The Colorado PC Users  Group  is  sponsering  the  second  annual
     International   FidoNet   Conference.   This  one's  a  bit  less
     convenient for our friends over in Europe,  but handier for those
     of  us  in  the  United  States.  This one's in Colorado Springs.
     I've been checking;  even from New York the air fare  isn't  that
     expensive.  The  rooms  are only $60 a night for single or double
     occupancy,  making it $30 a night if you get a roommate.  All  in
     all,  it's  a  cheap  way  to meet the people you've been talking
     with, and to make new friends in the FidoNet community.

     There will be all  sorts  of  things  going  on.  There  will  be
     seminars and panel discussions, a banquet, even a Wild West Show.
     And some hardware manufacturers will be there to show  off  their
     stuff.  (If you work with computers,  maybe you can even get your
     company to pick up the tab.)  There will be announcements of  new
     things,  and  explanations  of old things.  And best of all,  the
     conference will be swarming with FidoNet people.

     We'll be there, and we're looking forward to meeting you.

     Amnon Nissan, 158/100

                          Let's help FIDO make it!


        I have been running a BBS for the last 4 years, and a FIDO for
     the last 5 months.  As a supporter of the User Supported software
     I went ahead and sent $25.00  to  the  Fido  Administrators,  and
     later found out that only 5 percent of sysops send anything!!!

        If  you have been running your Fido for a short (or better yet
     long) time,  then you know how expensive it can get.  We have key
     people  doing  a hell of a job keeping us in business (node lists
     and newsletters) and most off us are  taking  them  for  granted.
     WHY?

        Being  the  treasurer for two users groups in my area,  I know
     how good we are going to do when we have the funds,  and how  bad
     it  is  going to be when we are low.  I am sure we will have much
     better service from our key people if they knew they  don't  have
     to dip into their pockets (at times real deep too,  I am sure) to
     get these services to us when we expect them.

        SO..... how about this.

        We all spend a dollar on junk each month!  Why don't  we  send
     this  dollar to the National FidoNet Administrators once a month,
     and see what happens.  Just ONE DOLLAR a month  can  do  miracles
     when  it comes from all the nodes.  Sooner or later it's going to
     come down to the point of live or die (FidoNet),  and I  for  one
     will  hate  to  see  all  my  efforts  go to waste because of ONE
     DOLLAR.

        I even went a little further and figured out how to solve  the
     problem of hundreds of ONE DOLLAR checks,  dropping on St.  Louis
     each month.  Hosts can  collect  from  nodes,  deposit  in  their
     account,  and send one check to their regional coordinators,  who
     will do the same and send one check to St.  Louis.  Of course  it
     will  be better if we all sent $12.00 to begin with for the whole
     year.

        Let's do something for ourselves!

                     Let's keep FidoNet going strong!!

                               Patching Fido


     Use any disk image patcher (such as the Norton Utilities  on  the
     IBM, or PATCH.EXE on the DEC Rainbow) to find these locations and
     patch accordingly.


     To fix the File Area change bug in 11w:

         At location C273 in FIDO_IBM.EXE (C203 in FIDO_DEC.EXE),  you
         will see the hex string:  3B 5E 08 7E 9C.  Change the  7E  to
         7C.

         Nearer  to  the  top of the file this string,  with 7C in its
         proper place, does exist.  This is probably the Message menu,
         which works correctly.


     To fix the Kermit transfer time inaccuracy in 11w:

         At location D2EC in FIDO_IBM.EXE (D1FD in FIDO_DEC.EXE),  you
         will  see  the hex string:  B9 03 00 F7 E1.  Change the 03 to
         01.

         It seems Fido  was  estimating  the  correct  time  and  then
         multiplying it by three before displaying it.


     Thanks  to  William  Bogartz  of  Fido  102/901  for locating and
     publicizing both of these wonderful patches.

     Randy Bush, 122/6

                       Some comments on Fido and Time


     Recent discussions  of  the  problems  (and  proposed  solutions)
     caused by time zones,  daylight savings time, and similar natural
     disasters have confused me in many ways; and I fear that I am not
     alone.

     I do not propose solutions.  This would be unwise without a surer
     grip on the problems.  I do want to explore some of the needs and
     requirements so that I might better understand the  problems  and
     evaluate  proposed  solutions.  Excuse some of the formalities in
     the early steps, but I like a firm base.

     0 - Who are the concerned parties?  I  guess  the  following  two
         consumers and two providers.
         o SYSOPs of the myriad Fidos out there in the world,
         o Local USERs of all those Fidos,
         o COORDINATORs of the network, and
         o AUTHORs of Fido software.

     1 - What is their level of expertise?
         o SYSOPs  vary  radically,  but  _each  and  every  one_ must
           install and use whatever it is that the providers  provide.
           Therefore,  Fido  time  management  for  SYSOPs  _must_  be
           addressed to the lowest level  of  computer  understanding.
           Low  maintenance  is  the  only  thing  which  may  be more
           important than ease of installation.
         o Local USERs  are  _amazingly_  naive.  They  are  the  most
           fragile  of  beings  and must not be jarred in any way lest
           they shatter.  I relearn this weekly.
         o COORDINATORs and AUTHORs  seem  to  be  professional  level
           computer  users  if  not  professional  implementors.  They
           should bear the brunt of any changes, confusion,  or tricky
           design.

     2 - What is the presumed Fido SYSOP's machine environment?
         o MSDOS machine (though one hopes that future ...)
         o Hardware  clock  (can  one safely run a Net machine without
           one?)
         o Auto Answer/Dial modem
         o Exclusively Fido, part time Fido, or Fido in 'background'.

     3 - What are the Fido and FidoNet environmental constraints?
         o All public nodes are known to all  other  nodes.  A  random
           node  may  try  to  contact  any other (unpredictable) node
           during any published net window.
         o There is no central knowledge or coordination of the  event
           lists  by  which  an  individual  Fido  schedules,  nor the
           routings set up for each mail schedule.
         o Fido schedules state a time, but not what zone that time is
           in.  It is currently wall clock time, but some suggest that
           it be UST.  Ben Baker suggests that an unused field of  the
           scheduler  record be used to indicate which time zone,  and
     Fidonews                     Page 6                   16 Jun 1986


           either be supported.
         Also interesting, but seeming irrelevant
         o There are privete nodes and nets of which the public net is
           unaware.
         o Routing is known by the net as opposed to the sender (a  la
           Usenet)

     4 - Who cares what time it is or when events occur?
         o Local  USERs  expect  Fido  to think the time is what their
           watches say.  Commercial mail  servers  tend  to  speak  of
           messages  in terms of the sender's local time,  though some
           speak of it as the readers local time.  None speak of it in
           some third (abstract) time.
         o FidoNet  software  has  to  to  keep  things   synchronized
           worldwide.
         o MSDOS  programs  running  between Fido runs or concurrently
           with Fido may be time of day  dependent.  They  often  need
           correct wall clock time.
         o COORDINATORs  want  to  speak in UST when talking globally,
           but in local time when speaking of a  local  net.  This  is
           human  and  should  be indulged if reasonably easy.  SYSOPs
           have this problem too.
         o SYSOPs often maintain text files  describing  their  Fido's
           schedules  so  their users will be able to read about local
           system availability.

     5 - When and why will the time or the timing of an event change?
         o Subsets of the FidoNet continually renegotiate topology and
           timing.  Nets  and  chedules  change.  This  will  probably
           continue for some time.
         o The  wall  clock  is  occasionally adjusted (usually by one
           hour).  These adjustments _tend_ to clump in  time  (Spring
           and Autumn) and by region.
         o The  algorithms  for determining if a particular Fido is to
           move on any particular day in a particular direction  would
           require   continued   maintenance   _if_   they  were  even
           determinable at one point in  time.  This  precludes  total
           automation, period.
         o A  Fido's  hardware  clock will be adjusted occasionally to
           correct for drift.
         o A Fido switches time zones;  either by being moved,  or the
           SYSOP  decides  to  run  on UST,  or switches sides near an
           inter-time zone border.

     6 - What information is required to adjust a local Fido?
         o What different times might  be adjusted?
           - The local time
           - The difference between local time and UST
           - A schedule negotiated with other Fidos
           - The time a local batch process is to be run
         o When the adjustment is to be done?
         o In what direction?
         o By what amount or to what value?
         o If adjusting to an absolute time, is it UST or local?


     Fidonews                     Page 7                   16 Jun 1986


     7 - What are the seeming problems?
         o Is a Fido thought of as on its local time,  local  standard
           time,  or UST?  For the moment,  consider daylight/standard
           as equivalent to switching time zones.  It also helps,  but
           is  not necessary,  to consider a Fido to be schizophrenic,
           and able to think in local and UST simultaneously.
         o When a SYSOP checks schedules for correctness,  some events
           should be expressed in local time (Yell,  local nets,  ...)
           and  some  in  UST  (National  Mail  Hour  [Public  FidoNet
           Window?]).  Displaying  in  both forms and sort options may
           help here.
         o When the time is  changed  due  to  wall  clock  adjustment
           (moving or day/std, one must remember that scheduled events
           then  divide into two sets:
           - Those which will stay at the  same  local  time  are  not
             adjusted  with  respect  to the local time.  They must be
             adjusted with respect to UST,  in the same  direction  as
             the  clock  is adjusted.  Yelling and local net schedules
             are likely to be in this category.
           - Events which stay at the same UST,  must be adjusted with
             respect  to  the  local time in the same direction as the
             clock is being adjusted.  The UHT of National  Mail  Hour
             does  not  move  when  a  Fido  is  moved or when day/std
             changes are made.
         o Schedule renegotiations also fall into two  classes:  those
           expressed  in  local  time  and those expressed in UST.  In
           either case, it is only one schedule being affected, and it
           may be considered in relative isolation.  Neither the  wall
           clock  nor  UST  are being moved.  One might like to move a
           group of schedules together.
         o When  the  hardware  clock  is  corrected  for  drift,   no
           schedules  change,  but Fido must be restarted or otherwise
           made aware of the change.


     So,  have I gotten it correct so far?  If so,  I do not feel that
     the above seriously hampers a solution.  What seems to be missing
     is
       o A  clear  metaphor  for speaking locally in terms of the wall
         clock and globally in UST.
       o An intuitive classification of  event  types  and  adjustment
         types  with  respect to time.  To start we must differentiate
         between
         - Events which are 'on' (ie expressed in terms  of)  UST  and
           are 'fixed'
         - Events which are on local time and move with the wall clock
         - Changing  an  event's  (or  group  of events) time(s) do to
           external renegotiations
         - Changing the local time  due  to  Fido  motion  or  day/std
           changes
         - Correcting clock drift.

     Given  clear  differentiations  here,  what  may  be  most useful
     is(are) a tool(s) for
       o Easily  stating  the  event  schedules  and  their   external
         attributes (ie fixed [UST?] or local)
     Fidonews                     Page 8                   16 Jun 1986


       o Easily moving events in time (either local or UST)
       o Inserting,  deleting, and moving events within the event list
         (as Fido is sensitive to the order of the list)
       o Moving the wall clock and having the events stay  correct  by
         knowing which are fixed and which are movable
       o Viewing (and PREviewing) event schedules and changes in a way
         that  exposes incorrect (ie.  conflicting) schedules.  Moving
         local time may place movable  events  in  conflict  with  UST
         fixed events

     If I have still not drifted too far from reality, Let me propose:
       o Fido  needs  do nothing.  It runs on local time and everybody
         locally thinks in local time.
       o The only time they talk UST is when they  mark  an  event  as
         being   a   fixed   UST   event.   The   Sysop  must  clearly
         differentiate between fixed and movable (with respect to UST,
         they are fixed with respect to local) events.
       o If Fido need not know fixed from movable, the differentiation
         could be made in an auxilliary file (eg. Ben's SCHED.REM).
       o A program such as Ben's EVENT.COM needs to
         - Differentiate the two event types
         - Provide for moving the system clock
         - Adjust appropriate events with or against clock motion

     Well,  by now I must have strayed sufficiently far  or  affronted

                               The Final Word


     Here's my last paper for awhile (at least till August) I'm  going
     out on the Texas A&M Clipper this summer,  so I won't really have
     much of a chance to send  articles  to  FidoNews.  If  anyone  in
     Helsinki  reads  this  I'll  be  there from the 14th of June till
     about the 18th of June, and I would like to trade freeware.  This
     article deals with the Breakup of AT&T,  it's my research  paper.
     I hope you find it interesting.  I almost forgot, I'll be setting
     up  a  Mail-only  board  in  Commerce Texas,  so until then "Good
     Computing!"

          Divestiture  of  American  Telephone  and  Telegraph,  AT&T,
     forced  the  world's  largest  monopoly  out  of  local telephone
     business,  but AT&T has been allowed to stay as a  long  distance
     carrier.    Corporations   such   as   Microwave   Communications
     Incorporated,  MCI,  have entered the market  place  offering  an
     alternative  to AT&T.  This has given customers a choice of other
     long distance carriers.  Because of  the  breakup  of  AT&T,  the
     customer should take into consideration telephone rates,  billing
     of customers and service before choosing a long distance  carrier
     company.  The  users  can  now  decide  which service meets their
     needs. Will AT&T survive the challenge of MCI and the competition
     of the spin-off telephone companies?

          The reason AT&T was broken up is simple. AT&T had a monopoly
     in the  telephone  market,  and  divestiture  was  imminent.  The
     people  who caused the divestiture wanted more competition in the
     long distance market (Hacker, 1985,  153).  AT&T owned twenty-two
     local  Bell  Operating  Companies,  which  were formed into seven
     telephone companies,  such as Southwestern  Bell  and  Ameritech.
     AT&T  had  to  divide its 150 billion dollars in assets among the
     newly formed companies (Marback 55).  Upon doing this  AT&T  lost
     control  over all local telephone call business because the local
     companies assumed all local service.  Local  telephone  operating
     companies  have lost all long distance revenues.  Due to the loss
     of these revenues, local service rates will be low enough for all
     to afford (Seelman 14).  AT&T will  be  able  to  sell  and  rent
     telephone  equipment,  but  so  will any other company.  AT&T has
     also kept the right to continue producing the Yellow  Pages.  The
     Yellow  Pages  have  attracted 150 million users and have doubled
     the advertising income.  This increase has been from  8%  to  10%
     annually for the last five years (Business Week, 23 January 1984,
     132).

          Regional companies have planned on gaining 75% of the mother
     company's  150  billion  dollars  in assets (Tunstall 57).  Right
     after the breakup shareholders were not  sure  what  to  do  with
     their  AT&T stock.  AT&T management planned to give share holders
     one share of common stock in the new Bell companies for every ten
     shares of AT&T stock (57).  Fingleton claims "damage to the stock
     Fidonews                     Page 10                  16 Jun 1986


     price would be minimal although asset value  per  share  will  be
     reduced."  (41).  Many  analyst  feel  that share holders will be
     better off and that AT&T revenues are likely to rise. (U.S.  News
     &  World  Report,  25 January 1982,  58) A meeting was held where
     AT&T shareholders could voice their opinions on the  divestiture.
     The  purpose  of this meeting was to help the shareholders under-
     stand what was happening to their stock  (Time,  23  April  1984,
     66).  Although AT&T is no longer a monopoly, it will be regulated
     in  each  state  by  local  officials  (Sloan  80).  Due  to  the
     divestiture agreement,  AT&T will be able to  enter  new  fields,
     such  as  computer  and data processing.  It has already unveiled
     six new computers, which will compete with International Business
     Machines, IBM (Demott 67).

          MCI,  Microwave Communications Incorporated,  was formed  in
     1968,  "and  since  then  they  have  been chipping away at AT&T,
     trying to get a foot hold in the  long  distance  carrier  world"
     (Time, 23 February 1981, 99).  MCI's original purpose was to give
     businesses  cheaper long distance rates for calls between Chicago
     and St. Louis.  MCI filed an application with the FCC, requesting
     the right  to  run  specialized  voice  and  data  communications
     (Shooshan  32).  In  an  attempt to undercut AT&T even more,  MCI
     released Execunet in 1975.  Execunet  linked  twenty-four  cities
     across  the  United  States.  The  Execunet prices were about one
     half of AT&T's rates.  But, the customer had to dial a twenty-two
     number sequence code to make one long distance  call  (Kleinfield
     157).

          MCI  started  a  campaign  blitz  in  the  media to make the
     company  name  a  "common  household  word"  (Business  Week,  13
     February  1984)  and  "sparked  a  rebuilding  of business commu-
     nications" (Business Week, 17 February 1986, 86).  "Bill McGowan,
     Chairman  of  MCI,  looks  too  mean  to  work  for  AT&T" states
     Kleinfield (171).  McGowan says that "AT&T is so big it's  almost
     impossible  for you or me to understand how big it is....  if you
     count from the day when Christ was born.... counting at one count
     per second,  it would take until 1902 to  count  out  the  annual
     revenues of AT&T" (171).  Though they lost 40% of their customers
     due to a complicated access code (Time,  11 June  1984,  47),  in
     1984 MCI was a major long distance carrier.  MCI made an alliance
     with IBM, which stunned the long distance carrier world (Business
     Week, 17 February 1986,  88).  This alliance enabled them to gain
     an  even  bigger foothold in the world of long distance telephone
     calls,  by giving them access  to  bigger  and  better  satellite
     dishes (Business Week,  17 February 1986,  88).  Another alliance
     that MCI made was with American Express and Sears  card  holders.
     This  alliance allows the card holders to make credit calls using
     MCI (U.S. News & World Report, 30 January 1984, 56).  Even though
     MCI has had poor carriers in the past, they get better and better
     every year.  Soon they might  have  as  strong  a  long  distance
     network  and service as AT&T does.  Within the next few years MCI
     will offer  directory  assistance  as  AT&T  does  now  (Consumer
     Reports, September 1984, 493).  Other new long distance companies
     will double their holdings (Business Week, 13 February 1984, 106)
     but will fold or merge with other long distance companies (108).

     Fidonews                     Page 11                  16 Jun 1986


          At first people did not understand the full impact  of  what
     was  about  to  happen to AT&T.  Many people did not realize that
     AT&T was going to be divided and no longer provide local service.
     There where many people who thought the telephones would go  dead
     on  that  fateful  New  Year's  Eve in 1982,  when AT&T no longer
     controlled the local telephone service and the regional telephone
     companies  no  longer  controlled  the  long  distance  telephone
     business.  For  nearly  100 years the Bell Systems controlled the
     central nervous system of the United States  (Seelman  16).  Many
     people  claim  the  new telephone companies are less friendly and
     much slower (Demott 66),  but AT&T officials claim that there  is
     nothing to fear.

          You  can  still buy or rent your telephone,  and they (AT&T)
     have set up a toll free number  for  people  who  have  questions
     about  the breakup (Demott 53).  One major problem AT&T will have
     is their billing service.  Some people are going to be  receiving
     some  outrageous  telephone  bills.  A  few AT&T customers in the
     Northeast received nine page bills  covering  months  of  service
     (53).  The  reason  these  bills  are  so high is because AT&T is
     trying to catch up on old service provided  during  the  lawsuits
     (54).  Customers  will  probably be receiving large bills for the
     next two years.  AT&T plans on combining  long  distance  service
     bills and rental bills (Business Week,  30 September.  1985, 50).
     To help lower these bills AT&T has made  a  10.5%  cut  in  rates
     (Demott 52).  Even though AT&T does not plan on losing a majority
     of the telephone business (Business Week, 13 February. 1984, 106)
     they  plan  on  making rate cuts while MCI must make increases in
     rates, due to an FCC ruling (Business Week 17 February 1986, 86).

          Another threat to AT&T is the Baby Bells,  the new companies
     formed  when  the  AT&T  monopoly  was  broken up.  The seven new
     companies dubbed "Baby Bells" (Rudolph 49),  are Ameritech,  Bell
     Atlantic,  Pacific Telesis,  Southwestern Bell,  Nynex,  and U.S.
     West.   The  Baby  Bells  are  entering  other   fields   besides
     telecommunications.  Nynex,  the New York Baby, bought eighty-one
     of IBM's  computer  stores,  then  merged  them  with  their  own
     computer  store,  Datago,  to create the seventh largest computer
     chain in the states (49).  Bell Atlantic  has  entered  into  the
     computer  business.  Bell Atlantic repairs computers,  and runs a
     financing operation which accounts for 427 million dollars of the
     company's 9.1 billion dollars in assets (49).  At the moment Baby
     Bells  are lobbying to loosen the legal noose around their necks,
     in hopes of  expanding  into  even  more  fields  (49).  AT&T  is
     striking  back,  they  have  offered  a  long distance service to
     businesses  that  bypass  the  Baby  Bells.   This  service  uses
     satellites  and  fiber  optics  to  bypass  the  local  telephone
     companies,  therefore eliminating access charges.  Last year this
     process netted AT&T 21 million dollars (49).

          In  1984  AT&T  had  a  fairly  firm grip over long distance
     calls.  They had a large number of competitors taking only 8%  of
     AT&T's  long  distance  calls  (Business Week,  13 February 1984,
     102).  AT&T advertises that they  have  faster  customer  service
     compared to MCI, which takes days to correct a wrong number. AT&T
     also  claims  to  be  the  only  long  distance company which has
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  16 Jun 1986


     operators to help you with every type of service you  want,  such
     as  reverse  charges,  and  person  to person calls (U.S.  News &
     World Report 11 June 1984, 91).  MCI claims to save you up to 40%
     over AT&T. But, AT&T has dropped their rates by 6.1 percent since
     May 1984 (U.S. News and World Report, 11 June 1984, 90).  One way
     AT&T  is  striking  back  at  MCI  is by offering credit for long
     distance calls.  The credit will help you  save  money  on  items
     such as GE blenders or a night at a Howard Johnson Motel.

          Local  telephone  companies  are  looking  for  new  ways to
     generate revenue.  One idea is an access charge and the other  is
     an  usage or service rate based on the number of times a customer
     uses the system.  The FCC approves of both these  ideas  (Seelman
     20).  Access charges would be a flat rate the customers would pay
     to their local telephone companies.  It would be a minimum charge
     each month even though the customer does not use the system (20).
     The other charge is called a limited service or usage  rate.  The
     customers  are  charged  a  rate  based  on how much they use the
     system for local and long distance calls.  When using  this  type
     of  rate schedule the cost of the service does not have a monthly
     minimum charge unlike the access charges,  but both  are  costing
     the consumer (20).

          Two  advantages MCI has over AT&T are (1) in the near future
     they will have their own long distance  network  (Money,  January
     1984,  80),  (2)  and  over the last two years they have paid 45%
     less for using the long  distance  network  than  AT&T  has  paid
     (Business Week,  13 February 1984,  106).  The majority of AT&T's
     profits have been generated from old  telephone  business  rather
     than their new computer business (Demott 67).  AT&T has been able
     to keep their rates fairly competitive with MCI's rates.  Another
     problem  facing  AT&T  is that by 1986 all long distance carriers
     will have equal access to switching and  transmission  facilities
     (Money, August 1984, 109).  AT&T is not concerned by equal access
     because  they  have had 100% of the direct access business.  They
     feel they will not be  loosing  money  or  business  when  direct
     access is expanded to other companies (Forbes, 21 May 1984, 204).
     AT&T  customers  will be able to use other long distance carriers
     even if they decide to keep AT&T.  All the customer needs  to  do
     is dial one-zero and a three digit access code to get the company
     they want (Business Week,  26 August 1985, 31).  MCI does have an
     advantage  of  not  billing  for  short  or   unanswered   calls.
     Considering  they  do not have the computer device that regulates
     short time calls,  you do not  get  billed  for  them.  (Consumer
     Report, November 1983, 618).

          The  strengths  of  AT&T are immediate correction of numbers
     dialed incorrectly, operator assistance, and one hundred years of
     service.  Both companies are excellent, but MCI has some distinct
     advantages  over  AT&T  such  as lower cost,  owning its own long
     distance network, and expanding its long distance market to other
     U.S.  cities and overseas as it  grows.  Being  able  to  use  an
     American  Express  Card  to  charge  telephone  calls  means card
     holders can use  MCI  easily  anywhere  the  caller  can  find  a
     telephone,  and  this is a big advantage when traveling,  because
     American Express is a commonly owned card.  MCI showed  a  profit
     Fidonews                     Page 13                  16 Jun 1986


     of  13  million dollars in 1985 on two and a half billion dollars
     in revenues  (Business  Week,  17  February  1986,  86).  MCI  is
     smaller and younger than AT&T, and MCI feels the customer can get
     to  know  the  company  better.  A majority of MCI employees came
     from Bell Labs,  an AT&T  company,  which  gives  them  the  same
     technical  knowledge found in AT&T (Kleinfield 170),  but the new
     company may allow its employees more freedom to do  research  and
     therefore  be  able to cause technical advances not held by AT&T.
     MCI is the company of the future and will definitely move ahead
     in the world of telecommunications.

     David Dodell, 114/15

                                  MAILCOST
                      OutBound Host Accounting Program


     One of our resident programming gurus here in Phoenix, Tim Evans,
     has written a program to handle outbound host accounting.  In the
     Phoenix net we wanted to organize into  a  inbound/outbound  host
     system to keep national mail flowing into and out of the net at a
     efficient pace.

     We  also  wanted  to  take  advantage  of  sharing  costs on long
     distance netmail.  We figured,  if two boards in Phoenix had mail
     going to the same inbound host, why make two separate phone calls
     that  take  15  seconds  each  and  pay  twice when they could be
     packeted together into  one  phone  call.  Therefore,  each  node
     would  split  the cost.  We did not have the advantage here as in
     other nets where the outbound host was located at a company  that
     would   absorb  the  long  distance  phone  charges.   Therefore,
     MAILCOST and MAILRPT were developed.

     Basically,  MAILCOST scans the Fido MAILER.LOG,  searchs for  the
     specified  long  distance schedule,  and outputs a summary of all
     packets  actually  sent  to  other  nets.  Each  node's  cost  is
     calculated  on  a pro-rated share of the number of messages sent.
     MAILRPT totals all costs for each sending  node,  and  outputs  a
     listing of the total cost for each node.

     As  the outbound host for the Phoenix net,  I run the report each
     month and send each node a netmail  message  telling  them  their
     netmail costs for the month.

     The  national  time  slot  is becoming quite busy - I find I have
     days go by trying to get through to some inbound hosts.  If  more
     nets  would  implement  an outbound host program,  there would be
     fewer nodes actually making the calls during the  national  slot,
     and  hopefully  traffic would flow smoother and faster.  Now each
     net has no excuse not to implement an outbound host  program  due
     to this accounting lacking within FIDO.

     For  those  of you running SEAdog - Tim is working on a switch in
     the control file to change and search the SEAdog format  for  the
     same information.

         For  those running SEAdog - MCOST12.ARC can be requested from
         114/15 24 hours a day using GET or the File  Request  utility
         in MAIL.

                               PCjr's Unite!


     I think the heading just about says what I want.  I want to  make
     up a listing of ALL boards that are totally PCjr specific or have
     PCjr Message or File areas on them.

     Send  me  a  note  if your board supports the PCjr.  You can also
     advise me of other Fido's,  since all don't receive FidoNews,  in
     your area (city,  state, and country).  Now, I know a lot of PCjr
     boards are not Fido's (Colossus,  PC-Board..etc..)  and  I  would
     like  to  know  about them also.  These MUST be confirmed current
     boards.  Not ones that you've "heard" about!

     This is the info I would like to have:  Board Name (and  net/node
     if Fido),  Sysop Name,  City,  State, Country, Phone #, High Baud
     Rate, hours.....i.e.

     PCjr-NET 104/904 Phil Kaiser Englewood,CO.USA 3037894610 2400 24

     I am NOT trying to set up another net.  My users deserve to  know
     about  other  PCjr  BBS's around the country (world?).  And,  I'm
     just plain curious!  Finally,  if YOU would like a  copy  of  the
     final listing be sure to let me know.  I should be able to get it
     out in about 4 weeks.

     Send all replies to: 104/904 - PCjr-NET .
     Or, you can call the board direct at 303-789-4610 - up to 2400
     bps and 24 hours a day.

     Thank you for your help.

     Well the reports keep flying in.  Fido Bugs East  1/99  has  been
     down for the last couple of weeks but should be up and running by
     the  time  you read this.  Also Fido Bugs West is now running the
     SEAdog front-end for Fido and can  receive  bug  reports  at  any
     time, not just regular mail times.

     The only bug that we can report this week with any solution is as
     follows:

     Many  users  were complaining that their normal level users could
     not access Message/File area #1 when selecting a  area  from  the
     expanded  menu.  They  could  beat  this  problem  by  going into
     another area and use the short-hand notation "A 1".

     I spoke to Tom Jennings on the phone and the problem seems to  be
     a  "bug" in the way Fido handles the SYSTEMx.BBS files.  What you
     have to do to correct the problem is make the greatest number  of
     SYSTEMx.BBS  (the  last SYSTEMx.BBS created) at a privilege level
     equal to or less than what you want access into area #1.

     To everyone who submits a report,  we read them all but  can  not
     answer  them  all.  If  a  report can be duplicated at either BUG
     node or appropriate test node then it  is  forwarded  to  T.J.  -
     otherwise we will contact you back for more information.

              Now available from Micro Consulting Associates!!

     Public Domain collection - 400+  "ARC"  archives  -  15  megs  of
     software  and  other  goodies,  and that's "archived" size!  When
     unpacked,  you get approximately 21 megabytes worth of all  kinds
     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes
     to communications programs, compilers, interpreters, etc...

     This collection is the result of more than 15 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 150 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,
     all  of  which have been examined,  indexed and archived for your
     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This
     is the answer!!!

     To  order  the  library,  send  $100  (personal or company check,
     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

                    Micro Consulting Associates, Fido 103/511
                    Post Office Box 4296
                    200-1/2 E. Balboa Boulevard
                    Balboa, Ca. 92661-4296

     Please allow 3 weeks for delivery of your order.

     Note:  No profit is made from  the  sale  of  the  Public  Domain
     software  in  this  collection.  The price is applied entirely to
     the cost of  downloading  the  software  over  the  phone  lines,
     running  a  BBS  to  receive  file  submissions,  and inspecting,
     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem
     using commercial phone access would cost you much more than  what
     we charge for the service...

     Please specify what type of format you would like the disks to be
     prepared on.  The following choices are available:
           - IBM PC-DOS Backup utility
           - Zenith MS-DOS 2.11 Backup Utility
           - DSBackup
           - Fastback
           - ACS INTRCPT 720k format (Requires a 1.2m floppy
               drive and PC-DOS 3.2)
           - Plain  ol' files (add $50)

     Add  $30  if  you  want  the  library  on  1.2 meg AT disks (more
     expensive disks).  There are no  shipping  or  handling  charges.
     California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     Leo Bores, 114/14


     The Bores Eye Institute needs your help.  If you know  of  anyone
     who  has  access  to  a Cromenco computer with a modem we can use
     that person's assistance.  We have some  important  patient  data
     files  on  8"  Cromenco  disks that need conversion to 5 1/4" and
     MS(PC)-DOS format.  This is research data and is very  important.
     Our  budget  cannot  afford  the heavy cost of direct conversion.
     We'd like to transfer them by  phone  if  possible.  We  can  pay
     expenses and a gratuity for the service.

     Please help.

                   Deaf TTY service for the Fido network?


     I hope to generate interest in accommodating  the  Deaf  citizens
     owning a TTY (teletype device).

     I  believe  there is a huge market of fairly isolated deaf people
     who could greatly benefit from Fido service - and the hardware is
     basically compatible,  though it runs slower than  the  300  Baud
     lower limit.

     The  only necessary modification to Fido is that it recognize the
     Fidonews                     Page 22                  16 Jun 1986


     lower Baud rate.

     Hardware modification to any Fido board that supports 300 Baud is
     unnecessary, as the bell 300 baud standard provides 0-300 Baud.
