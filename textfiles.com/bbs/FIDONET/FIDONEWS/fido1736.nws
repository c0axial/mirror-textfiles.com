                             Robot with Attitude!
                                  Doug Myers

     In the novella, Bicentennial Man (recently rendered as a Robin
     Williams movie), science fiction Master Robert Heinlan depicted the
     efforts of a robot to achieve humanity.  In the latter half of
     August, Thom LaCosta announced his own efforts to infuse the ELIST
     ROBOT with the human feature of judgement:

     ----- Announcement in the Echo MODERATOR by Thom Lacosta -----

     Effective immediately MOD UPD messages from third parties will NOT
     be processed unless the echolist keeper has personal knowledge
     and/or netmail/email from moderators that:

     A. They have authorized a third party to update their listing
     B. They have the password to the echo in question.

     This policy has been instituted to insure the accuracy of the
     echolist and to preserve the rights of the listed moderator.

     Moderators using the services of third parties are strongly urged to
     communicate with the echolist keeper that the conditions above apply
     to their echoes.

     For purposes of accuracy, all communications should specifically
     list the echoes that are updated by a third party.

     -----

     In a past guest editorial in FIDONEWS, I defended the right of the
     elist keeper to correct individual cases of chicanery with echo
     listings... but I couldn't help but wonder if he'd bit off more than
     he could chew with this policy.

     I had two misgivings about this policy:

     1.  The policy assumes wrongdoing on the part of a third party
     lister unless proven otherwise.  This is a far different strategy
     than the past policy of intervening when wrongdoing was actually
     detected.

     2.  Though the stated purpose of the policy was to ensure accuracy
     and protect the rights of moderators, it actually seemed like a
     strategy to discourage or eliminate third party listers.  In fact,
     it brought to mind numerous arguments Thom had had with Bobby
     Queen, Fidonet's premier echo lister.  Could there be something
     personal in all this?

     The latter suspicion was confirmed in Thom's echomail response to
     Ross Cassell...

     ----- Echomail from area MODERATOR -----

     Yes Sir!  As a matter of fact, a recent series of events was
     triggered by a change in moderators.  I noticed that a third party
     had been updating the listing for several months, using the original
     moderator's name.  The updater then changed the moderator.

     I asked both the original moderator and the updater to confirm that
     the original moderator had transfered the echo.

     Amazingly, the original moderator said he hadn't, and the updater
     said that since the echo was his, he could name anyone as moderator.

     It's apparent that while a third-party may have a password, that
     does NOT give that person the right or standing to make substantial
     changes to the content of an echo tag listing.

     From my viewpoint, it may represent fraud, gross mis-undrstanding of
     the echolist, general confusion about rules, but none-the-less, it's
     something that can not be tolerated.

     -----

     Though the above rationale is stated in a generalized manner,
     subsequent echomail brought out that Bobby Queen was indeed the
     target of Thom LaCosta's new policy:

     ----- Echomail from Bobby Queen to Thom LaCosta, MODERATOR -----

     TL> I am trying to recontruct what went on with the Hockey Echo.
     TL> My files indicate the following:

     TL> The echo listing was deleted on 4/1/2000 due to a lack of an
     TL> update.

     Yep

     TL> On May 7, 1999 you "rescued" the echo, showing Daryl Turner,
     TL> the previously listed moderator as moderator.

     True

     TL> On June 5 and July 10, 2000 you updated the echolisting, still
     TL> showing Daryl Turner as moderator.

     All the while trying to contact Daryl via CRASHED NetMail to get the
     echo turned back over to him.

     TL> On August 6, 2000 you updated the echo showing Michael Grant
     TL> as moderator.

     True

     TL> Can you supply me with copies of any communmications from Daryl
     TL> Turner showing that he either gave you control of the echo, or
     TL> confirmation that he had turned the echo over to Michael Grant?
     FIDONEWS 17-36               Page 3                    4 Sep 2000


     If I had any responses from Daryl either to my NetMails or via email
     he could have kept the echo himself.  The problem was I told him via
     NetMail that someone else had asked to moderate the echo and for 3
     months I got no response to any of my messages and Michael CRASHED
     his system also asking him.  So we know his system was accepting the
     NetMail messages but he was not responding in any way.  So I picked
     a new moderator for an echo I had rescued.

     TL> If that information is not available, do you have anything that
     TL> would substantiate that you had the authority to remove Mr. Turner
     TL> as the listed moderator and substitute Mr. Grant in his place?

     The authority was that in letting the echo slip Daryl gave up his
     right to the echo as you yourself has said in various echos
     including MODERATOR.  I kept him listed until after 3 months I could
     not contact him and the echo was in need of a moderator and was on
     the low traffic report and in danger of being totally deleted from
     the Z1B Backbone.  Michael had contacted me and I had given Daryl
     over a month to contact me after I sent him CRASHED NetMail letting
     him know that Michael wanted to take over the echo.

     Point is the echo was MINE and I chose a new moderator.  PERIOD!

     -----

     I don't suppose that I owe Thom LaCosta either editorial support or
     editorial opposition.  In the past, I was openly supportive of his
     role in thwarting Zorch Frezberg's attempt to retain the echo
     FN_SYSOP under the guise of "echo trustee."  I was also openly
     critical of Tom Knowles "echo rescuing" attempts on the suspicion
     that he and Thom LaCosta were actually the same person.  I suppose,
     in the interest of balance, I should be wishy washy on this
     particular issue.

     In this spirit of no firm convictions, I've similarly never formed
     an image of Bobby Queen.  He could be a bottom feeding echo
     scavenger, as Thom LaCosta and others have portrayed him in the
     past... or he could be the heroic echo rescuer which he claims to
     be.  The fact is that Bobby mainly traffics in echoes which would
     have been lost to Fidonet anyway.  Certainly, I wouldn't care to
     expend the effort he does in determining the echoes which are about
     to expire, and then listing them himself.  Whether he restores them
     to the original moderator, claims them for himself, or acts as an
     echoGod in determining a new moderator seems only of academic
     interest.

     Despite my lack of firmness above, however, I believe the new
     echolist policy is more an argument between Bobby Queen and Thom
     LaCosta than a matter of principle.  At the very least, it seems the
     wrong example on which to base policy.  It seems that Bobby is being
     chastised more on a technicality than on any actual wrongdoing.

     It seems that Bobby had the authority to list Daryl Turner as
     moderator of the HOCKEY echo when Daryl left it expire through his
     own inaction, but doesn't have the authority to list Michael Grant
     as moderator as Daryl continues his inaction.  The technicality is
     FIDONEWS 17-36               Page 4                    4 Sep 2000


     that Bobby didn't list himself as moderator when he listed the
     expired echo, and thus placed himself in the dreaded category of
     "third party lister" when he attempted to nominate an active
     moderator.

     I don't know Daryl and I don't read the HOCKEY echo... but the
     echomail quoted seems to indicate that Daryl couldn't be bothered
     with the echo for six months during which the echo expired, and
     three months thereafter.  I'm not sure that the "accuracy" of the
     elist is being preserved by perpetuating the "rights" of a moderator
     who, in fact, didn't moderate for nine months.  I'm not sure the
     "rights" are worth preserving.

     Above all, I'm not sure I want a policy which establishes a "big
     brother" to monitor all elist submissions for such technical
     violations.  This is nothing personal against Thom LaCosta... I
     suppose he'd make as good a "big brother" as anyone else... but "big
     brothers" have been known to slow the growth of the little guys.

     If there's been an actual violation of the rights of Daryl Turner
     which isn't evidenced by the echomail so far, then let Thom do what
     he sees as right to correct the problem.  But the self-promotion to
     "big brother" seems like overkill here.

     My good friend's daughter writes these words of love to her Dad,

                  Elusive As The Wind
           by Martha Crowninshield O'Brien

           Love is a powerful thing.
           Elusive as the wind, as magical as
           Christmas Eve and songs that make you cry...
           Its touch is such that nothing
           can begin to describe or do justice to it.
           Love leaves us seeking more, like
           crisp autumn leaves afire with color,
           and that one last glimpse of setting summer sun...
           When it's lost or wounded, as a bird
           struck from the sky in midflight,
           it's as though the rain will never end,
           and the world seems dark and lonely;
           door braced shut against wicked
           winter wind, our hearts as icy as
           late February snow...
           We are sad waiting for the sun, and
           too often believe we will never love again...
           Always though, against all odds,
           there remains a tiny spark, not unlike
           a firefly fluttering lazily through a
           steamy August evening, ready to ignite
           perhaps, a future flame, a lasting love...
           Thank you for the time spent sharing
           your heart and opening mine to the
           sweet possibility that I might love again...
           Sad to leave a special future to
           begin a distant past, but I have loved
           you as best I could, as you did me,
           and I wish you Love,  wonder and
           starlight, always....

          Windswept sand hills looking up
          to sun-kissed skies of powder blue,
          shifting calmly day to day
          with constant footprints trudging through.

          As waves, in sequence, pound the shore

          and distant seagulls cry above,
          shy wind whirls tumble through the haze,
          a pleasant, tickling type of shove.

          Distinction ends though at the sea,
          and as if caught within some bond,
          I notice with a startling thought
          that it goes on and on.....and on!

                           Democratic Demographics
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     Virtually anyone can be a Democrat. Just simply quit thinking and
     vote that way. But if you want to be a GOOD Democrat, there are some
     prerequisites you must have first. Compare the below and see how you
     rate.

     1. You have to believe the AIDS virus is spread by a lack of federal
     funding.

     2. You have to believe that the same teacher who can't teach 4th
     graders how to read is somehow qualified to teach those same kids
     about sex.

     3. You have to believe that guns, in the hands of law-abiding
     Americans, are more of a threat than U.S. nuclear weapons
     technology, in the hands of Chinese communists.

     4. You have to believe that there was no art before Federal funding.

     5. You have to believe that global temperatures are less affected by
     cyclical, documented changes in the earth's climate, and more
     affected by yuppies driving SUVs.

     6. You have to believe that gender roles are artificial but being
     homosexual is natural.

     7. You have to be against capital punishment but support abortion on
     demand.

     8. You have to believe that businesses create oppression and
     governments create prosperity.

     9. You have to believe that hunters don't care about nature, but
     loony activists from Seattle do.

     10. You have to believe that self-esteem is more important than
     actually doing something to earn it.

     11. You have to believe the military, not corrupt politicians, start
     wars.

     12. You have to believe the NRA is bad, because it supports certain
     parts of the Constitution, while the ACLU is good, because it
     supports certain parts of the Constitution.

     13. You have to believe that taxes are too low, but ATM fees are too
     high.

     14. You have to believe that Margaret Sanger and Gloria Steinmen are
     FIDONEWS 17-36               Page 8                    4 Sep 2000


     more important to American history than Thomas Jefferson, General
     Robert E. Lee or Thomas Edison.

     15. You have to believe that standardized tests are racist, but
     racial quotas and set-asides aren't.

     16. You have to believe Hillary Clinton is really a lady.

     17. You have to believe that the only reason socialism hasn't worked
     anywhere it's been tried, is because the right people haven't been
     in charge.

     18. You have to believe Republicans telling the truth belong in
     jail, but a liar and sex offender belongs in the White House.

     19. You have to believe that homosexual parades displaying drag,
     transvestites and bestiality should be constitutionally protected
     and manger scenes at Christmas should be illegal.

     20. You have to believe that illegal Democratic party funding by the
     Chinese is somehow in the best interest of the United States.

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
