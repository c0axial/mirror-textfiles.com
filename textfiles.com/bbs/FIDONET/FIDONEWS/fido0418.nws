                                  Politics

     I heard an interesting thought the other  day.  Some  local  nets
     are  more "powerful" than others.  I'm still trying to figure out
     what this means.

     Oh,  I know,  we're talking politics  again.  The  techie  in  me
     rebels  at  this.  "Political  reasons"  rank right up there with
     "historical reasons" among  the  very  worst  reasons  for  doing
     something in a particular way.

     But  I've  been  in applications work long enough to realize that
     political reasons,  as much as I  may  dislike  them,  are  still
     reasons, and are valid in their own context.

     But I don't think that FidoNet can afford to get bogged down in a
     morass of politics.

     You see, there's a funny thing about political reasons.  They can
     work against you as easily as for you.  Almost by definition they
     have no rational basis in facts.  Technical reasons, on the other
     hand, almost always work FOR you.

     FidoNet  is  dedicated  to  the  free flow of information.  CPCUG
     originated that phrase,  I think,  and most  boards  I've  called
     quote  it  in  one  place  or another.  We just mean it more than
     most.  We're dealing here  with  the  free  flow  of  information
     between 1500 or more systems around the world,  serving countless
     users covering the whole spectrum of philosophies.  Not  only  do
     we  have  the world's largest (mainly) free mail system,  we also
     have that tremendous amplifier of personal expression, echomail.

     But keeping that information flowing is  a  technical  operation.
     We  serve the most people the best by ensuring that the technical
     aspects of our network run as smoothly  as  possible.  Only  this
     way  can  we  serve  everyone.  This  means that politics have no
     place in the operation of  the  network.  The  network  fails  to
     serve us if it does not serve us impartially.

     No matter what your philosophy or affiliation,  The Word will not
     go out unless the network  runs  smoothly.  Yes,  stand  by  your
     beliefs  and  express  your  opinions,  but please lay aside your
     special interests when it comes to matters of network operation.

     Kilgore Trout, 107/7

                              A Brief Put-Down


     It seems like every time I talk to anyone  these  days  they  are
     raving  about  what  a great editor they have,  and in every case
     it's always BRIEF.  The BRIEF  editor  seems  to  be  taking  the
     country  by  storm.  It's advocates often sound like the computer
     equivalent of newly converted members  of  a  religious  cult.  I
     finally  got  my hands on a copy of BRIEF so I could try out this
     wonder editor for myself.

     BRIEF   stands   for  Basic  Reconfigurable  Interactive  Editing
     Facility,   and  they  mean  it  with  a  vengence.   Calling  it
     "reconfigurable" is about like calling the Grand Canyon a valley.

     As near as I can tell, the actual editor itself is fairly simple,
     with  the  usual  "type a character and it gets shoved in" stuff.
     It gets its power from a bunch of  built-in  macro  atoms  and  a
     complex macro language.  It comes with a large library of  macros
     that  do all sorts of neat things for a programmer,  plus you can
     define your own macros to be about as sophisticated as you like.

     For example,  here's a nifty feature that is the main reason  why
     I'm  sweating over this thing so much:  If you are working on a C
     program and you want to see if it has any  syntax  errors,  press
     Alt F10 and BRIEF will run your compiler for you.  If you get any
     error  messages,  BRIEF  will  trap the error and show it to you,
     while zapping your cursor over to the offending line.

     Sounds neat,  eh?  It IS neat.  Though of course it suffers  from
     some  predictable  shortcomings.  It can only zap you to the line
     reported by your compiler,  so it can never be  better  than  the
     compiler  at pinpointing the actual faulty line.  My compiler has
     a few errors that get reported on the line holding the brace that
     closes a function, so that's where BRIEF goes.  Well, at least it
     finds the right function for you.

     I could make a case here for it being TOO all-fired powerful and
     flexible.  In fact, I will.  A number one,  don't ever even THINK
     about  running  it  on  a 4.77 mHz XT.  A plain ol' PC or XT just
     ain't got the horsepower for this kind of editor.  I  guess  that
     means  don't  try  running it under DoubleDOS,  Desqview,  or any
     other multitasker unless you are really into frustration.

     One of the features that sends C programmers into raptures is its
     automatic indenting and template ability.  You can set it  up  so
     when you type "f " (the space is important) as the first thing on
     a  line,  it changes it into "for ()" and puts your cursor in the
     parens.  Nifty,  but I don't WANT a space between the  "for"  and
     the parens.  So okay,  I can change that.  So after  an  hour  of
     FidoNews 4-18                Page 3                   11 May 1987


     thumbing  through the book and searching the macros I find it and
     fix it.  Another twenty minutes of thumbing the book  and  trying
     things even makes it so BRIEF does what I said.  No hassle yet; I
     was new to it, so I expected a fair amount of manual thumbing.

     Here's how I spent the rest of my day:

     BRIEF can also do fancy things for you with braces.  When you hit
     an open brace, it automatically fixes up the indents and sets the
     closing  brace  for  you.  It  understands  two different ways of
     doing braces with indents.

         Method 1:      while(x) {
                             a = b;
                             b = c;
                             }

         Method 2:      while(x)
                             {
                             a = b;
                             b = c;
                             }

     But I don't like either of those methods.  I like:

                        while(x)
                        {    a = b;
                             b = c;
                        }

     I've found the macro that handles this (I think).  One day I  may
     even understand it.  If I'm lucky,  I may even someday be able to
     fix it.  First I'll have to learn the macro language, which is no
     easy  task.  It's  some  sort  of  cross  between  C,  LISP,  and
     something else.  Expressions look like:

         (if (inq_mode) (= replaced (substr (get_parm) (++ loc) 1)))

     Much of this and I go cockeyed counting parens.

     I suppose I'll keep slugging away at it.  BRIEF  is  loaded  with
     features,  and  I love features.  One of these days I'll probably
     figure out how it works,  and then I'll probably be  as  much  in
     love  with  it  as  everyone  else seems to be.  But meanwhile it
     strikes   me   as   an  incredibly  bloated  example  of  rampant
     featuritis,  almost (but not quite) as  bad  as  the  supermenued
     BackComm program.

                               MACE UTILITIES


     Ever since I got hit by a 'trojan' type program  2  years  ago  I
     have  been  searching for the 'ultimate' recovery program.  Now I
     can say I have found it!

     Mace Utilities will recover a hard disk that has  been  formatted
     either accidently or otherwise!  It is a rather smart utility and
     can find files that you thought were lost forever on your disks.

     Recently I got hit with another 'trojan' type program.  With MACE
     I  was  able  to  recover  the disk entirely (after 1 call to the
     author of MACE) in just under 1 hour.  The author of the 'trojan'
     knew  of  MACE  and  made  a  very  good attempt at erasing (read
     destroying) the file MACE writes to the disk containing the  disk
     (FAT)  data.  However MACE also writes files to areas of the disk
     most people don't even know about (I had to  call  to  find  this
     out)  and  as such is relatively safe from 'trojans' assuming the
     programs are still on the disk.  For the recovery function  alone
     MACE is worth the money!

     As  a  Sysop  I also use MACE to diagnose and condense my drives.
     With files constantly being created,  erased,  and moved  between
     sub-directories my disk slows down very quickly. For those new to
     hard drives,  when the computer goes to create a file it searches
     the File Allocation Table for the next available spot and  writes
     the  file  to  that area.  This IS NOT always the first available
     spot.  More often than not you have at least 25% of the directory
     entries  in  the  FAT  unavailable.  These ARE NOT made available
     again until a Chkdsk is run,  or better yet when you condense and
     un-fragment your disk.

     Due to the constant erasing, copying, moving of files, some files
     are not located in contiguous sectors.  What this means simply is
     that the drive heads have to move to many different areas to read
     one file.

     MACE allows you to condense which simply  moves  all  entries  in
     each  directory  to  the  top  of  the  file,  speeding  searches
     especially if you use the PATH command.

     Then you can un-fragment the drive which simply makes  sure  that
     every file is written in contiguous blocks thus making head moves
     less frequent resulting in faster access.

     All  in  all  a very good utility that should be in every Sysop's
     library of utilities.

     Steve Ahola, 101/433

                              2400 Baud Modems


     I have seen all kinds of stuff on why one brand  of  modem  won't
     connect  to another.  Heres something I picked up on the boards a
     while back.

                                   * * *

     When you call a 1200/2400 bps modem,  it answers in either of two
     ways.  If it is a CCITT-V.22bis compliant modem,  it answers with
     3.3 seconds of 2100Hz tone,  then 75 mS of silence,  and  then  a
     burst of training signals to get the other modem to adjust to the
     line.

     If the answering modem receives training signals in response,  it
     assumes that it will be talking 2400 bps  using  16-QAM  and  you
     have  a 2400 bps connection.  If instead of the training signals,
     it receives 4- PSK from the originating modem in response to  its
     answering tones, it assumes that it will be a 1200 bps connection
     and  switches  off the training and (in the USA) uses 4-PSK (Bell
     212 standard).  [European modems use CCITT-V.22 (not V.22bis) for
     1200  bps.  Some  modems  claim to handle this as well as 212 for
     1200 bps.

     Here's the rub:  some of the 1200/2400 modems don't answer  using
     the CCITT V.22bis handshake. They instead answer with a different
     handshake  (the  engineer  referred  to  it  as the Bell 2400 bps
     handshake).  After going off-hook, the "Bell handshake" answering
     modem sends 2125Hz (which is pretty close  to  the  CCITT  2100Hz
     tone)  and waits for the originating modem to respond either with
     1200bps 4-PSK or with QAM training signals.  It then switches  to
     the appropriate mode,  and either sends some training signals for
     2400, or 4-PSK for 1200.

     Some modems can handle both kinds  of  handshakes.  I  have,  for
     example,  no  problem calling a Courier with a Courier,  anything
     with a Racal-Vadic or a MultiTech, etc. But my Courier can't call
     my Case-Rixon; an Anchor didn't connect to the Courier, etc.  No,
     I don't have a chart of what talks to what, for reasons that I'll
     explain:

     The point here is that I'm not interested really in what talks to
     what  on  a  brandname basis.  I want instead to find some brands
     that "do the right thing"  for  both  handshakes,  and  recommend
     those. So far I've found a couple (Racal-Vadic and Multitech come
     to  mind)  and  I'll choose among those and others based on other
     factors, such as interface, reliability, mounting,  etc.  for the
     list of ones I recommend.

     But  the  other manufacturers need to get on the stick and get it
     right.  It seems to me that stating that a modem is CCITT-V.22bis
     compliant also means that it does the CCITT handshake,  and yet I
     can call several of the modems out there and  just  by  listening
     FidoNews 4-18                Page 6                   11 May 1987


     (no  75mS interruption,  guys!) tell that they're using the "bell
     handshake".

     And the  ones  that  I've  tested  that  answer  with  the  "bell
     handshake" don't seem to accept the CCITT handshake when you dial
     out.  Moral:  It  may be 2400 bps but they're not all compatible.
     C'mon, guys!

     Modem manufacturers!  Heed my words!  Since there is a  published
     international standard and one other noncompliant "standard", you
     need  to  accept  both!  And  you  should probably default to the
     international standard when you answer.

     Listening test:  I call the modem and listen.  After it goes  off
     hook, I hear in my telephone either

     1) a  steady  high-pitched tone,  then a very brief interruption,
        then   another   slightly-different-pitch   tone,    then   it
        disconnects. -or-

     2) a steady high-pitched tone that lasts until it disconnects.

     I surmise that #1 is the CCITT handshake.  I just tried this with
     a Case-Rixon 1224 and a USR Courier.  The Case-Rixon did #1,  the
     Courier did #2.  If I call both on a conference call, I hear what
     could be a 25Hz beat note between them during the first  tone  on
     answer.

     So,  I'm  not disparaging anybody's modems.  But I wish there was
     more standardization so that I don't have to buy one of  each  to
     test them before we make some big mistake.

     "Sak", 107/329

                             OPUS - I LOVE IT!


     I've used both Fido and Opus to  run  this  BBS  and  I  find  no
     comparison   between   the  two  in  as  far  as  flexibility  or
     capability.  Opus is a hands down winner.  Here are  just  a  few
     examples of the improvement:

     o my  Fido  subdirectory contained some 145 files the system used
       just to operate, my Opus subdirectory contains about 85 files.

     o Fido has no way to effectively  run  "outside"  programs  other
       than  using  something like Outer and then re-logging into Fido
       like a new  caller  when  finished,  Opus  exits  to  "outside"
       programs  like  they  were part of Opus and returns a caller to
       the main menu.

     o Fido's command letter could not be changed, Opus can change the
       command letter.

     o Fido was rigidly Fido,  Opus allows for the embedding of  calls
       to  other  programs or files expanding the utility of the whole
       program.

     Actually the list goes on.  The command structure  is  different,
     but its not so different that someone familiar with Fido would be
     completely  lost.  The  main  areas  of confusion are the Message
     Menu selections.  I think Opus should include in that menu a note
     telling callers that by entering the number  of  a  message,  you
     display  that  message.  Nonetheless,  I  think combining both of
     Fido's message menus into  one  menu  is  a  good  idea.  When  I
     converted,  I  took  the  time  to  switch  the help levels of my
     callers to novice.  That seemed to make a big difference in their
     acceptance of the new system.

     In short,  dispite some of the failings of Opus,  it's  a  strong
     contender  for  Fido's  place  in  the  sun.  I've never used BBS
     software that contained so many ways  to  personalize  a  board's

     around problems.

     We,  the assembled sysops of Net 107*,  have unanimously voted in
     favor of supporting the following statement:

     As  members of FidoNet,  we feel that it is in the best interests
     of FidoNet and the sysops who comprise it to  affirm  support  of
     the  current interim leadership of IFNA and of their decisions to
     date relative to continued operation  of  the  Network  and  also
     toward  the  establishment  of  a  more  formally  structured and
     controlled organization.  This includes support of not  only  the
     interim  Board  of  Directors  and their coordinators,  but their
     creation and exercise of the precepts contained in POLICY3.DOC.

     We encourage their continued efforts on  our  behalf  until  such
     time  as  the  new Board of Directors is elected and installed as
     the governing control of IFNA.

              NATIONAL VIETNAM VETERAN'S ECHO-MAIL CONFERENCE

                    There is one other wall, of course.
                           One we never speak of.
                             One we never see,
                  One which separates memory from madness.
                     In a place no one offers flowers.
                              THE WALL WITHIN.
                           We permit no visitors.

     I started out with Steve Mason's poem because it tells a story in
     itself.  I believe it accurately describes in very few words  one
     of the very many complex, and probably one of the most protected,
     commonalities  shared  not only among a vast majority of military
     combat veterans of ANY war, but among nearly every person who has
     witnessed and survived any  kind  of  life-threatening  traumatic
     experience  as  well.  This  "wall"  shields us from our darkest,
     most horrifying memories.  It is,  without question,  one of  the
     most  significant  components manifested in Post-Traumatic Stress
     Syndrome (PTS).

     One of the toughest things for any combat veteran can be to  open
     his  or  herself  up (yes,  there are women who have seen combat,
     too) to another human being and share the traumatic  events  from
     their past.  It is rare in this instance when the occasion can be
     found when both the will and and a sympathetic,  non-critical ear
     are both available at the same time.  Most us  of  find  it  very
     hard,  even  when  conditions  are  perfect,  to "tell it like it
     really was".  One has to have an awful lot of trust in  a  person
     to  risk  the consequences of lowering "the wall" ,  much less to
     permit others to visit among our long-since buried  memories  and
     feelings.  When  it gets right down to the line,  most of us lose
     the  courage  to   face   the   emotional   ramifications   which
     unmercifully enshroud us when we dare to share our deepest,  most
     personal secrets with someone else.  It is  especially  difficult
     when  that  other  person  has never experienced the same kind of
     traumatic events,  making it difficult if not impossible for them
     to truly understand our pain.

     How  do you tell someone who has never experienced combat what it
     REALLY feels like to witness a comrades violent death?  What will
     that person think of you when you tell them what it REALLY  feels
     like  to  have  to  take the life of another human being?  Is the
     emotional relief from getting it off your chest REALLY worth  the
     gamble of possible rejection,  ridicule,  or criticism?  Well,  I
     can tell you from my own experiences that is is far less  painful
     to  keep  the  "walls"  in  place  than  it  is to face up to the
     terrifying realities they imprison.

     There are a few places where I can feel safe  bringing  up  those
     old,  painful  memories;  places where I can slowly pull each one
     out and deal with it in a comfortable  atmosphere  free  of  mis-
     understanding and criticism.  The local Vietnam Veterans Outreach
     Center is one, but I sometimes have problems in one-on-ones.  The
     FidoNews 4-18                Page 10                  11 May 1987


     others  are computer bulletin boards where I can find others like
     myself who have been there and understand where I am coming from.
     I have also discovered in the past several months that there  are
     an  awful lot of non-vets,  many who were either not born or were
     just too young to serve at the time, who can teach me a lot about
     myself and the residue of feelings still  lingering  beneath  the
     surface of my consiousness.  I have "met" countless ex-protesters
     who have buried feelings of their OWN which need to be expressed.
     And, I am sure now, that we all have shared a learning experience
     together  as  we  communicate  our  thoughts  and feelings to one
     another.

     I started a bulletin board just like that in my home in San Jose,
     California, now the Vietnam Veteran's Valhalla.  I also conceived
     a national echo-mail conference devoted to  the  Vietnam  Veteran
     and  put  out  the  call for supporters across the country.  That
     call was answered by so many Fido,  Opus,  and TBBS sysops that I
     wouldn't  attempt  to  name them all for fear of leaving one out.
     Together,  we have linked our systems between the east  and  west
     coasts  and I am proud to boast of our success,  and proud of the
     long hours and hard work they have  ALL  put  toward  making  the
     conference a grand success!

     There  are  people  from  all  walks  of life contributing to the
     National Vietnam Veterans Echo-Mail Conference;  combat and  non-
     combat  veterans  from  all wars,  non-veterans of all ages,  and
     Vietnamese military veterans and refugees.  Just because you  are
     not a Vietnam Veteran, or even a military veteran at all for that
     matter,  is  no  reason  not to call one of the boards closest to
     you.  All you need is an interest in learning about the realities
     of the Vietnam war,  and hearing about it from those  of  us  who
     were actually there;  who know the true cost of war and have paid
     that price.  No historian,  unless  he  or  she  has  been  there
     personally, can tell you what WE can!  And conversely, no one can
     tell US what YOU can!

     We  want  to  put  out  the call again and ask for the support of
     other sysops around the country to become a part of this valuable
     public  service  by  hosting  the  Vietnam   Veterans   Echo-Mail
     Conference  in your area,  or just to call and browse through the
     messages accumilated since June of last year.  Please contact me,
     Todd Looney,  at the Vietnam  Veteran's  Valhalla  in  San  Jose,

          This  has  been  an  enjoyable  week  for me. I've been busy
     catching up on some  of  the  Usenet  conferences  and  have come
     across some  interesting things.  One of  them is the source code
     for valspeak, more on  that later.  This column's  going to  be a
     little different.  I'm going to stick my neck out and get up on a
     soapbox for a few paragraphs. Those of you who don't care to read
     these  sections   can  merely  skip  the  section  starting  with
     "[Soapbox ON]" until you  see the  "[Soapbox OFF]."  I've decided
     that not enough people are talking, and I'm getting kind of tired
     with the knee-jerk reactions taking place in the network.

     -- Usenet and FidoNet --

          While I was going over some of the conferences on  Usenet, I
     discovered a  new one  in progress.  It dealt with how to connect
     FidoNet and Usenet together. This wasn't too surprising as I knew
     it was  beginning to  be done by people like Bob Hartman who were
     familiar with both of  these  public  networks  (okay,  so Usenet
     isn't quite  as public  as FidoNet). What was surprising to me is
     how active the conference  seemed to  be. There  are quite  a few
     people on  Usenet who  are seriously thinking about or working on
     gateway software to link these  two  fine  networks.  The problem
     that I saw was that a good number of them were totally unfamiliar
     with the Fido or SEAdog conventions  of mail.  If we  don't start
     working on  much the  same thing here, we may find ourselves shut
     out of easy Usenet gateways because  Usenet has  decided how they
     will  accept  a  Fido,  and  Fido isn't going to like the methods
     involved. I'd like to think that  anyone out  there involved with
     FidoNet and Usenet is going to try and make sure that the gateway
     will be something relatively easy to  implement, and  is a little
     more relaxed than what Usenet seems to prefer. I say this because
     I've glanced at  some  Usenet  technical  type  stuff  and became
     hopelessly lost after the first few pages.

          It also wouldn't be to convenient if our PCs had to handle a
     full Usenet feed, because it isn't unusual for Usenet to transfer
     2 megabytes  of data  a day. My local Usenet site has a dedicated
     line to one of their sources for news, and I  don't know  of many
     PCs that  could do that very easily. I'd like to hear from anyone
     out there in FidoNet  who is  working with  the Usenet  people on
     developing a  practical gateway between the networks. This is not
     downplaying Bob Hartman's current  gateway by  any means.  I just
     happen to  be a  little lazy  and would  like to see some gateway
     software that nearly anyone could implement with a willing Usenet
     site coordinator.

     -- Valspeak and LEX --

     FidoNews 4-18                Page 12                  11 May 1987


          While on  Usenet I came across the source code for Valspeak.
     If you've never heard of it,  it converts  an ASCII  text file in
     "English"  into  something  a  little  different.  How different?
     Suffice to say that  your old  high school  English teacher would
     have a  heart attack  if he  saw the  final result ("the" becomes
     "thuh," "yes"  becomes  "fer  shure,"  etc.).  I'd  heard  of the
     program  several  months  back  (on  Usenet)  but  had missed the
     posting of the source code.

          In looking over the source code I found out that  I'd need a
     program  called  LEX  as  well  a  C  compiler.  After a few days
     searching I found a version of  LEX on  Gee Wong's  board (thanks
     for allowing file requests Gee). My only problem seems to be that
     the LEX I have, isn't quite compatible with the LEX that was used
     on the  posted Valspeak.  This meant I actually had to go look at
     the documentation on LEX and learn what it did. LEX is a "Lexical
     Analyzer  Generator"  which  means  that it writes a program that
     analyzes (and can convert or translate)  an ASCII  file. It seems
     to be  very powerful in that it could be used to help you convert
     source code from one language to  another, maybe  even do  a very
     basic translation  between two  spoken languages although I don't
     think it would be that good of a translation. I've almost got the
     LEX I'm using to accept the source code for valspeak, after which
     I should merely have to compile a C program.

          If this  sounds  a  little  complicated  or  time consuming,
     that's  because  it  is!  Even  after  I  get  my LEX to generate
     (hopefully) a C program, there's no assurance that  my C compiler
     will be  able to  accept the generated code. While I've only come
     across one program off  Usenet that  Microsoft C  4.0 didn't like
     (JOVE), the  docs on  the LEX  I'm using seem to indicate that it
     generates code for one of the PC versions of C. If the PC version
     doesn't  correspond  to  the  latest  MSC  conventions it will be
     necessary to  modify  the  generated  C  code  to  get  a working
     valspeak. There  was a similar program called jivespeak that I've
     seen on a few local bulletin boards, I'd like to hear from anyone
     who has  done such  a conversion. I'd especially like to hear any
     hints on how to do this, or where  I could  get a  more UNIX like
     LEX. As  I write  this an  idea just popped into my head, I could
     run LEX on the UNIX machine I have access to and bring the C code
     down to  the PC  and compile it there. I'll let you know how that
     approach works  out  next  week,  as  there's  bound  to  be more
     programs like  this floating around and this may be an easier way
     to port them to our PCs.

     -- [Soapbox ON] --

          Last chance to avoid  my preaching,  those who  continue are
     going to  be stuck  listening to  my opinionated views on several
     topics.

          For  over  a  year  we've  all   been  hearing   about  IFNA
     (International  FidoNet  Association).  Last  August  there was a
     meeting  in  Colorado  Springs  which  started  the  ball rolling
     towards incorporating  IFNA as  a non-profit corporation. Many of
     us had noticed  little  things  about  IFNA  for  some  time (the
     FidoNews 4-18                Page 13                  11 May 1987


     copyright on  the nodelist  for example).  Well, Colorado Springs
     didn't turn out quite as well as anticipated.  I am  not going to
     start pointing  fingers here as to whose fault that was, I wasn't
     there and have only  heard about  what happened  second hand from
     Phil Ardussi,  my net  host, and  what people have written in the
     echomail conferences and FidoNews.  Suffice to  say that  it came
     close to  being a  disaster from  what I've heard. This isn't all
     the fault of the organizers either. Some of  the problems stemmed
     from a  few hot-headed  people who attended the conference. Well,
     many of us have  seen  a  whole  slew  of  messages  in  the echo
     conferences on  IFNA. I've  gotten a  little tired of some of the
     stuff I've been seeing and decided it was time to get some  of it
     off my chest.

          First off  there was a vote taken on the bylaws. Granted the
     current bylaws are not perfect, but is anything?  The bylaws give
     us  a  starting  point  from  which  we  can  work.  Without some
     beginning "rules" absolutely nothing can be  done. How  could you
     start writing  a program if you didn't even know what language it
     was going to be  used? (I  refer to  actual coding,  not breaking
     down  the  task  into  reasonable  parts.)  There  were  over one
     thousand people entitled to vote on the bylaws, yet less than one
     fifth actually  took the  time to vote. The bylaws were published
     weeks ahead of time  in FidoNews.  The week  after OUR newsletter
     was filled with discussion on the proposed bylaws. Thom Henderson
     even went to a lot of extra  effort  to  make  it  very  easy for
     people to  comment on  the bylaws. There was no need to have read
     the article specifications document, and it  isn't that difficult
     to adhere  to those  specs. All  you had  to do was send a normal
     netmail message  to 1/1,  and Thom  put a  notice to  this is the
     FidoNews that was almost dedicated to the proposed bylaws. In net
     157, we spent a better part of our monthly meeting discussing the
     bylaws. After  much discussion  (in the  next edition of FidoNews
     and a lot in the echo conferences) a  modified set  of bylaws was
     printed in  FidoNews. When  it seemed  that these proposed bylaws
     would be  reasonably  acceptable  a  vote  was  called.  In every
     FidoNews  after  that,  there  was  a notice and a ballot for the
     expressed purpose of voting  the  acceptance  of  the  bylaws for
     IFNA. If  the bylaws  had been  voted down,  the bylaws committee
     would have gone back to the  drawing board  and made  any changes
     they felt  would be  necessary to gain the majority acceptance of
     the bylaws.

          Out of over one thousand  people  eligible  to  vote  on the
     bylaws, less than one fifth of them actually voted. It seems that
     taking a few minutes to read the bylaws, consider them,  fill out
     the ballot and send it in was too much for many. I wouldn't think
     it was the cost of mailing  it, one  stamp is  fairly cheap. Even
     overseas rates on a one page letter isn't that much. Yet hundreds
     of people decided not to vote.  When  you  don't  vote,  you toss
     yourself on  the mercy of those who do vote (and their decision).
     Voting is one of the highest levels of  authority you  have in an
     organization,   it   is   your   duty  to  wield  that  authority
     responsibly. If you don't, you have to be  willing to  accept the
     decision made  by your  peers. If  the results  aren't what you'd
     prefer, even if you did vote, you have to be willing to TRUST the
     FidoNews 4-18                Page 14                  11 May 1987


     decision of  the majority  of your  peers and abide by the GROUPS
     decision. I realize that there is a strong possibility of one net
     not knowing  about the  vote being  taken due  to a changeover in
     hosts or  something, but  even if  that entire  network had voted
     against the  bylaws the  end result would have been the same. The
     vote for the bylaws was passed by an  overwhelming margin.  As it
     was  the  responsibility  for  everyone  eligible to consider the
     bylaws and vote on them, it is now everyone's duty to accept that
     decision and work TOGETHER for a better set of bylaws.

          I have  "heard" several  people talk about IFNANET. There is
     no such beast. It has been stated repeatedly that you DO NOT have
     to belong (and never will have to belong) to IFNA to be listed in
     the nodelist. All it takes to be listed  in the  nodelist is some
     small proof that you are indeed running the software necessary to
     communicate with everyone else in  the  network,  and  be running
     that software at the required times. The only absolute throughout
     the network is the  national mail  hour, which  is only necessary
     for a  public node  (special arrangements  can always be arranged
     for a private node). In each net (or region) it is up to the host
     to decide  if any  extra mail  events are  needed and everyone in
     that net would comply with  the  host.  In  Net  157,  we've been
     talking over the idea of several mail events to speed up mail and
     everyone is involved in the discussion. I don't know how it works
     in other  nets, but here we discuss things rationally and come to
     a mutual decision. Some people may not care for the decision, but
     everyone abides  by it. IFNA does not "govern" our net, it merely
     assures our continuity.

           The guidelines  for  governing  the  network  are  found in
     POLICY3.DOC, which  is merely a revisal of POLICY2.DOC, etc. This
     document has remained almost  unchanged since  it's creation. The
     changes that have been made are to help make all of us in FidoNet
     (sysops and users) more a single group instead of a  mob. The two
     basic rules are simple: 1) Do not excessively annoy and 2) Do not
     be easily annoyed. I read it as don't  be a  real pain  to anyone
     else  in  the  network  and  be tolerant of other people's ideas,
     opinions, and beliefs (these rules are very easy to live with).

          If you want to be a region  host  or  net  host,  it  gets a
     little  harder.  You  become  responsible  for  distributing  the
     nodelist to everyone in your net.  Net hosts  have the additional
     duty of  distributing FidoNews  to the  net. This isn't to punish
     anyone, it's because FidoNews helps bind us into  that group (not
     a bunch  of sysops  and BBS  users, but  people with FidoNet). It
     even provides a way for you to air  a grievance,  and that method
     hasn't changed one iota in a long time.

          Next up is the copyright issue. Everything I've been able to
     find out on the nodelist copyright makes me wonder why  anyone is
     complaining about  it. At  one time  there was  an individual who
     started selling the nodelist  as an  "official list"  of bulletin
     boards  in  the  US.  The  people  who  were  creating the master
     nodelist found out about it and didn't feel  it was  right for an
     individual to sell the work of others for a profit. The copyright
     may not  have stopped  whoever was  selling it,  but it certainly
     FidoNews 4-18                Page 15                  11 May 1987


     made him  think twice  about it!  Copyright violations are a very
     serious  issue  in  the  courts.  Look  through  some  recent  PC
     magazines (PC  Magazine and  BYTE come  to mind)  and you'll find
     some companies who offer a  "service"  to  any  institution. They
     come in to your offices and educate your people on why you DO NOT
     copy software, that those  copyright notices  ARE VERY IMPORTANT!
     Fines on these type of things can run very high, plus there's the
     possible civil lawsuits that  can result  as well.  It's like how
     college professors  impress upon  you how  important it is not to
     commit plagiarism. It  also  serves  the  purpose  of  making the
     nodelist belong to every person in it.

          Because  IFNA  really  is  the  network  of members and non-
     members. Even if you don't pay any dues and aren't  able to vote,
     IFNA does  affect you.  Just like  the POLICY?.DOC affect you, so
     does IFNA. It formalizes what we've been doing  all along, adding
     what   the   government   requires   for   recognizing  a  formal
     organization. Since it's a non-profit corporation, many companies
     will be  willing to  make special offers to IFNA members. Without
     an official organization, companies won't look twice at  you. You
     aren't a group, you're a disorganized mob! IFNA tells people that
     we are not a mob, we're  an organized  group of  people with some
     common goals.

          Now comes  the copyright  that has appeared in FidoNews. The
     bylaws stated that there would be  a method  of distributing news
     to all  paid members  and associates, and it would be in a weekly
     newsletter called FidoNews. It would distribute  information that
     would be useful to its' members. It also means that it would make
     non-members who qualify for membership aware of what was going on
     in the  network. While  this isn't  officially stated, I think it
     follows fairly well that it would serve this purpose as well.

          As an  example suppose  you were  staring up  a new echomail
     conference that  you thought would be of interest to many people.
     You  could  enter  a  message  about  it  in  a  current echomail
     conference, but not everyone receives echomail or has the time to
     read all of it. You could send a  netmail message  to everyone in
     the network, but that would be extremely costly to say the least.
     You could also send a message  to  every  host  and  ask  them to
     forward  the  message  on  to  their  nodes.  This  would be less
     expensive, but you could never be  sure that  the message reached
     everyone  (you  can't  demand  that  someone  forward a message).
     FidoNews however would make your task very easy, all you  have to
     do is send ONE message to 1/1 (in accordance with the ARTSPEC.DOC
     file) and within a week or two everyone would know  about the new
     echomail  conference.   Because  everyone  is  supposed  to  read
     FidoNews, it contains information for everyone (once again sysops
     AND users).

          IFNA  is   promising  that  FidoNews  will  continue  to  be
     published, and is promising that someone in IFNA will always take
     on  the  responsibilities  of  the editor for FidoNews (keeping a
     board  up  to  receive  submissions,  and  making  sure  it's put
     together every week). Considering the amount of work that they're
     guaranteeing, I see no reason why they shouldn't be able to put a
     FidoNews 4-18                Page 16                  11 May 1987


     copyright notice  on it. If FidoNews was only distributed to paid
     IFNA members, I would be one  of  the  first  to  object.  But it
     isn't! Anyone  may distribute  it provided they do not charge for
     it (or at least, not make any money by selling it). I  would like
     see  an  amendment  to  the  bylaws  that would assure it's being
     continued  in  it's  current  state,  which   means  anything  is
     published that reaches Thom.

          The copyright also protects anyone who submits an article to
     FidoNews from a lawsuit. If I were to  make a  serious mistake in
     reviewing a product and my error were to cause a major decline in
     it's sales,  I  wouldn't  necessarily  be  put  in  the poorhouse
     because of  it. That  copyright notice would help protect me (and
     anyone else who had something  published  in  FidoNews).  While I
     would be  hard put  to find an example as serious as I stated, it
     does reassure me that I'm not out there all alone!

          I do think, however, that some things should be censored out
     of  FidoNews.  If  someone  were  to  write  an article which was
     deliberately slanderous, I would  like to  think that  the editor
     would refuse  to print it. The same would go for anything that is
     simple name  calling or  childish. As  for who  decides what goes
     beyond the bounds, it's simple. You make someone who the majority
     trusts the editor, and then let  the person  do it.  If you don't
     trust the  current editor, find someone you do trust or volunteer
     to do it yourself. If the majority picks  someone you  don't care
     for, learn to live with it because an organization is designed to
     make as many people happy  as  possible,  not  everyone.  I fully
     trust the  current editor,  and would like to seem him stay on as
     long as possible. If in the future, FidoNews gets a  new editor I
     will be  continue writing.  If a majority of the people (in IFNA,
     that organization that works to keep the network together) decide
     on a new editor, I will happily live with their decision.

          IFNA is not FidoNet, and FidoNet is not IFNA. FidoNet is the
     network as a being, the multitude of bulletin boards, sysops, and
     users  who  find  something  worthwhile  in telecommunications in
     general,  and  in  the  advantages  of  Fido/OPUS/SEAdog/etc.  in
     specific. IFNA  is the nonprofit organization that is composed of
     those people who are willing to  go the  extra ten  yards for the
     network. They  believe that  there is something good (and not for
     making money) in the  network  and  want  to  see  its' continued
     existence.  If  this  means  giving  up  a  few  hours a week (in
     addition to the work  involved in  running a  board) to  create a
     nodelist or  newsletter, or  attend a  meeting (perhaps far away)
     they do it. They  don't sit  back in  their homes  or offices and
     write rude or insulting messages, they work with everyone to make
     sure that people who  DO write  rude or  insulting messages don't
     destroy the network, which is something they believe in!

          Anyway...'Nuff said on this for now.

     -- Winding Down --

          Game  of  the  week  this  time  is  The  Ancient Art of War
     (Broderbund, list  price  $44.95).  It's  quite  a  bit  like the

     strategy board  games I  played many years ago, only with the new
     twists of the using the computer. It's also nice because  I don't
     have to spend several hours trying to find someone who feels like
     playing! It is not copy protected and includes  several scenarios
     as well as a generator for your own scenarios. You're offered the
     chance to fight against  several  different  opponents,  from the
     easy to  beat "Crazy  Ivan" to a man who almost wrote the book on
     strategy, Sun Tzu.  I've  become  fairly  proficient  in Sherwood
     forest  by  practicing  some  "guerilla  warfare"  and  have also
     "mastered" the war of attrition (when  you start  off with  2 big
     armies and  end up  with half  a dozen men total). The are a wide
     variety of options you can change with each game (where does food
     come from,  new trainees,  supply lines,  etc.) to make each game
     either easier or harder than Broderbund's defaults.

          I was going to recommend Silent Service (Microprose) for the
     PC (I  used to play it a lot on a friend's Commodore 64) but have
     been unable to  get  this  copy  protected  game  to  load  on my
     machine.  I  suspect  it's  the  NEC  V20  I  have installed. I'd
     appreciate  it  if  anyone   could  confirm   this  problem  with
     Microprose's copy protection (I've yet to run into a problem with
     well  written  copy  protect   schemes   or   non-copy  protected
     programs).

          I have been to busy to go look over any new books this week,
     although I did buy several. Hopefully I'll have  looked them over
     by next  week. In the meantime I'd like to hear from some of you,
     either  by  sending  me  mail  or  from  an  article  written for
     FidoNews. Below  you'll find  my uucp "address," FidoNet net/node
     number, and US Mail  address.  Netmail  to  me  should  be routed
     through 157/1,  157/502, or  157/0 (preferably  157/1 as I hit it
     more often each day). All these nodes are running SEAdog  4.0, so
     you shouldn't  have to  worry about mail schedules. They are also
     willing to forward a file to  me. If  you have  your own favorite
     programs, I'd  like to  know about  them (and  tell everyone else
     about them if I think it's  good as  well). In  the meantime, see
     you on the network.
