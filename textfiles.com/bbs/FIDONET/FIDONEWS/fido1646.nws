                                 Big Edition

     Many thanks to all the contributors for this edition of Fidonews.
     To tell the truth, I'm overwhelmed:  it appears that the members of
     Fidonet are starting to assert their ownership of their weekly
     newsletter, a process I can only encourage.

     I'm not exactly sure why this particular edition is just about
     double the size of a regular edition.  I'd like to think that I
     begged enough people for contributions that I achieved some kind of
     critical mass.  But, to be honest, I don't think it had that much to
     do with my personal efforts.

     My theory is that it's had more to do with the performance of the
     small, but growing, Fidonews staff.  Though there are only a few
     names listed in the masthead, these individuals have polished their
     sections into immaculate form.  I think readers noticed the
     difference in the quality of Fidonews, and that fact is responsible
     for the surge of interest this week.

     Of course, everyone might have found themselves with free time this
     week...


                                 Echo Posting

     Those of you who carry the FIDONEWS echo are invited to look at this
     week's posting of the newsletter with a critical eye.  I've revised
     the batch files here which split the newsletter and autopost it.
     Now the split is every five pages with the break at the printer page
     break rather than by line count.  The form feed characters have been
     stripped to prevent interaction with some BBS readers.  Hopefully,
     the appearance and ease of online viewing is improved.  I'd like
     your feedback and suggestions on this, however.

        Cow in Berlin before...             ...and after 9-Nov-1989


     It would seem that the Fall of the Wall should be celebrated by more
     than the ASCII cows on this, the tenth anniversary of the event.
     Yet it's largely gone unnoticed, getting only brief mention on talk
     radio and little or no attention by the press.

     It was probably the most unexpected event of my life.  The Wall in
     Berlin had stood ever since I could remember, and I never imagined
     that it would someday come down.  Though the nuclear danger was
     stressed in talk about monolithic Communism when I was younger, the
     more powerful symbol of human oppression was the Wall.  Destroying
     the world fifty times over was, possibly, too terrible to be
     believable... but a place where people were brutally shot down time
     after time brought home the value of freedom.

     Perhaps the lack of celebration today is because the rest of the
     world was wiser than I, and realized that all oppression would
     ultimately fail.  But I didn't know that nor even have hopes of
     it... until the Wall came down.

     Even Fido politics pales in comparison...

                    News from the Black Helicopter
                    Ruth Argust <ruth@doorgames.org>

              Although I wrote it, I could not have done
              without the help of many in the S-b echo with
              a very special thanks to Steve Asher of Zone
              3 for his invaluable co-conspirator input :)


     Let's clear up a misconception here. I am fully convinced that Thom
     LaCosta is a real person. There are several reasons behind this
     which I am not going to publicly disclose at this time.

     Yes, the BBS list said that real names must be used but that is not
     always the case as we know.

     It is my opinion that Tom Knowles is the alias or handle that
     LaCosta uses and has used for several years. This is probably why
     some searches for the name Tom Knowles turned up empty. However,
     even =if= Tom Knowles is a co-sysop, his grabbing the echoes, in my
     opinion, is proof that the ELIST has been compromised by the ELIST
     keeper since the co-sysop will have more access than the average
     user of the system. Additionally, there has never been any reports
     previously of a co-ELIST keeper and if Tom Knowles is the co-sysop,
     that is precisely what we have. But see more on that below.

     However, I strongly doubt that Tom Knowles exists other than as an
     alias for LaCosta.

     Have you all noticed how conveniently Tom Knowles has been elevated
     from a simple user on LaCosta's system (with no knowledge on how to
     operate the system to even quote a message by his OWN admission) to
     having had co-sysop status for the last several years? This happened
     ONLY after the information contained in the USBBS List was made
     public. LaCosta had AMPLE time in advance to say that Knowles was a
     co-sysop on the system and never did so. In fact, if you all recall,
     the first post made by Knowles anywhere was in the Moderator echo
     and it was not even from LaCosta's BBS. Additionally, LaCosta said
     something very different indeed (below).

     This all shows that LaCosta has been hiding something and possibly
     continues to do so.

     Now, let's do a bit of echo digging on the subject of Tom Knowles
     which is from Thom LaCosta's own post which clearly states that Tom
     was never a user of the BBS until recently:

     Well, it would seem that the person first logged into a system that
     wasn't mine...I think if you look at the posts, you'll see that he
     logged on from another system in net261...it's the one that belongs
     to the NEC and is also available via telnet.

     All of the update messages from the user were submitted from an
     internet address....not a Fido address....and all were a good period
     of time before he ever became a user of this board.

     So, until someone who uses my board actually submits an update
     message from the board to the echolist, I'd say, like so many of
     your posts, you're all wet.

     All of this "a good period of time before he ever became a user of
     this board", but apparently a good deal of time after he became the
     sysop of the same board... five years later, in fact. :) Remember
     that the name Tom Knowles appeared 3/1/94 in the US BBSLists.

     And don't miss this part:

     "So, until someone who uses my board actually submits an update
     message from the board to the echolist, I'd say, like so many of
     your posts, you're all wet."

     Isn't that what supposedly happened when the BBS had crashed and Tom
     Knowles was the =only= person who was able to update and grab three
     echoes from the board to the echolist just at the precise time they
     were burned? According to Carol Shenkenberger he was able to do this
     because he had logged onto the BBS to update expiring listings. Does
     this mean that in this case, Bob Kohl is NOT all wet?

     But I don't believe that LaCosta is the only one trying to hide
     something. I am of the opinion that SOME of the ranking members of
     FidoNet are aware of the alias and were fully aware of "the plan"
     that was used. I think further that LaCosta is calling on his
     "buddies" to assist him =try= to prove his credibility and get

     himself out of the hole he has dug himself into. I think you will
     see this in action so be advised.

     I have seen an admission by someone who has known LaCosta for many
     years to the point of face to face contact and he stated that he had
     never heard of a Tom Knowles. This person has run a BBS in the same
     general area for many years.

     What we have here is certainly overwhelming cause for concern. We
     have a very suspect ELIST where underhanded tactics appear to have
     been used and then more lies upon more lies to try to cover up the
     situation. This should be of deep concern to all of you and I am
     hoping that we can indeed have some persons step forward to set up a
     new ELIST. Many of us will support a new forthright and honest
     system.

                      The Mother Of All Elections
                       Steve Fredette, 1:163/551

     Well, the annual Region 12 election/flamefest is over, and what a
     hoot!  I haven't had this much fun since the Maylaysian Node Policy
     Complaint.

     It started on Sep 16th with the non-election call by the
     incomp^H^H^Humbent RC, Mike O'Connor. He appointed his brother Shawn
     as returning officer, but neglected to mention this to the region.
     The first message we saw from Shawn was a test message, followed by
     the election rules and an inaccurate timetable.

     Andrew Dominas and Darrell Salter were nominated, along with
     Creepin' Moses.  Shawn rejected Creepin's nomination (correcly),
     because his system was non-CM, and the election guidelines called
     for only CM systems to be elligible.  He later decided to ignore the
     guidelines and allow Creepin' to run, provided that he switched his
     system to CM if he won.  (???)  By this time, Creepin' was at the
     cottage, and didn't even know he was in the election.

     I nominated myself via crash netmail just before the deadline.
     Shawn didn't seem to be the most competent RO we've had, and I
     wanted to see if he could deal with a last-minute nomination as
     advertised in the guidelines.

     The first round of voting was fraught with mistakes and other
     difficulties.  On the first day of voting, after campaigning was
     over, Shawn accidentally reposted a previous message announcing that
     "We will be entering campaign phase tomorrow." An innocent enough
     mistake, but Shawn refused to believe it.  He first claimed that it
     was a dupe. (It wasn't -- the second message had a different
     subject, date and MSGID).  Then when the dupe theory didn't hold up,
     he descended into the twilight zone and decided that there must be a
     forger in our midst.  A rather clever forger indeed, who was able to
     remove the original message from Shawn's own system.

     Several flamewars later, Brian Hillis' routed netmail vote arrived
     on Shawn's system.  The message had Brian's name, but *Shawn's*
     address as the originating system.  Well.  Mike and Shawn exploded,
     accusing Brian of forging the message to trick Shawn into accepting
     an 'invalid' vote.  A little sleuthery by Lesley-Dee Dylan tracked
     down the problem and confirmed that the message left Brian's system
     with the correct address, but was grunged along the way.  Neither
     Mike nor Shawn ever did apologise to Brian about that one.

     After several more of Shawn's screwups (Missing passwords, mistyped
     node numbers, problems accepting crash netmail), we finally arrived
     at the end of the first round of voting.  The results:

        Andrew Dominas          7
        Darrell Salter          8
     FIDONEWS 16-46               Page 7                   15 Nov 1999


        Steve Fredette          8
        Creepin' Moses          0

     Oh great, a runoff election.  According to our election guidelines,
     a candidate must receive over 50% of the vote to be declared a
     winner. If not, the candidates with the least votes are dropped from
     the list and we have a runoff.  But wait!  Shawn miscounted Gerry
     Calhoun's vote. It appears that one of my votes should have gone to
     Darrell.  So the result is now:

        Andrew Dominas          7
        Darrell Salter          9
        Steve Fredette          7
        Creepin' Moses          0

     How bloody hard can it be to count to 23?  I sent the following
     message:

     I know it's cold there, but shouldn't you take off your mittens
     for the duration of the election?  Or you could wear gloves.
     They're almost as warm as mittens, and they won't interfere with
     your counting.

     And poor Shawn can't figure out what to do next.  According to the
     election guidelines, he should drop Creepin' from the list and hold
     a runoff with the other three candidates.  "But nothing will have
     changed," he thinks, and takes it upon himself to 'flip a coin' to
     remove one of the second place candidates.  Coincidentally, the same
     one who just insulted him:

     Subject: Election Runoff

     Well,

     You all seem more interested in, a) tossing out insults, b)
     suggesting hand apparel. c) just balking in general, instead of
     making constructive suggestions.

     FIDONEWS 16-46               Page 8                   15 Nov 1999


     I will use what the RC has suggested. I will vote to break the tie
     between Andrew Dominas and Steve Fredette. I really have no interest
     in who gets elected, so I will flip a coin.

     Heads : Dominas
     Tales : Fredette

     It's Heads.

     The runoff will now commence between Andrew Dominas and Darrell
     Salter. All votes stand as they were previously cast for the two
     candidates in the runoff. (unless you submit a change during the
     runoff)

     If you wish to change your vote you must use the same password as
     previously submitted.

     One again the candidates are:

     Andrew Dominas
     Darrell Salter

     ** Modified time frame **

     Votes must arrive by Sunday October 24 Noon (12:00)

     Note: for the idiots out there; Votes are submitted by selecting a
     candidate then selecting a password. Placing both of these in a
     message (Netmail or here in REG12) addressed to me (Shawn O'Connor).

     Candidate: <Name you selected>
     Password : <Password you selected>

     The region's response to this piece of logic was vocal to say the
     least.  Even the other candidates were pissed off, and promised to
     hold a new election if they actually 'won' this farce.  I replied:

     That's funny... the deadline for the first round of voting is over,
     and I don't recall seeing your number in the list of nodes that
     voted.  Yet you are now apparently casting a vote.

     The election guidelines are clear on what to do if no candidate
     receives 50% of the vote, yet you ignored them.  Do you remember
     writing the following on Sep 30th?

        SO> If you don't follow the guidelines, (disregarding them on a
        SO> whim)
        SO> what's the point in even having them.

     Did you bother to *read* the election guidelines?  *Can* you read
     them? Who died and left you as the region's penis-potato[*]?  There
     isn't much point in holding an election in the first place if the
     returning officer simply ignores the election guidelines and picks
     his own candidates.

     And do you suppose it is appropriate for the returning officer to
     complain about one of the candidates, then in the same breath, boot
     that candidate out of the election?  Would the coin have come down
     "Tales" if I *hadn't* suggested you lack the arithmetic skills of
     the average toddler?

     And you're ugly too.

     After quite a bit more flaming, Mike decided he'd had enough.  He
     fired his brother and took over the job of returning officer
     himself. A few (much quieter) days later, the results of the runoff
     are in:

        Andrew Dominas          8
        Darrell Salter          13
        Steve Fredette          10

     (Sigh)  Ok, nobody has 50% of the vote yet, so we drop Andrew from
     the list and hold a second runoff.  The result of that one are:

        Darrell Salter          14
        Steve Fredette          14

     [Banging head on table]  We *still* don't have a clear majority, and
     need to hold a *third* runoff election.  By this point I'm getting
     sick of the whole thing.  I figure Darrell can do just as well a job
     as I can, and I'm half considering changing my vote so that he'll
     win and we'll be done with it for another year.  During the voting
     period for the third runoff, I posted the following message:

     Dad phoned me from the rest home earlier today and asked if I would
     take over the job of returning officer for the election.  He's
     having a hip replaced and can't spare the time right now.  Don't
     get into a panic now, folks.  I don't have nearly as much trouble
     with counting as Uncle Shawn did.

     This caused Mike, as another sysop put it, "to fry his last
     remaining brain cell."  He accused me of 'forgery'.  Huh?  *Another*
     mythical forgery?  Better learn the difference between a forgery and
     an alias, Mikey.  And grab a sense of humour while you're at it.  He
     waited until two minutes before the election deadline, saw that the
     results were still tied, then withdrew his previous vote for me in
     order to throw the election in Darrell's favour:

     Yeeeha!  A threesome.  Fucked twice in the same election by two

            Medication for Fight-O-net's History of WAR
                     compiled by Ol'WDB
                                Hugs
            No moving parts, no batteries.
            No monthly payments and no fees;
            Inflation proof, nontaxable,
            In fact, it's quite relaxable;

            It can't be stolen, won't pollute,
            One size fits all, do not dilute.
            It uses little energy,
            But yields results enormously.

            Relieves your tension and your stress,
            Invigorate your happiness;
            Combats depression, makes you beam,
            And elevates your self esteem!

            Your circulation it corrects!
            Without unpleasant side effects
            It is, I think, the perfect drug:
            May I prescribe, my friend,... the hug!

            (and, of course, fully returnable!)   I like that part best...
                                         ***ALSO***
            HAVE YOU HUGGED A FRIEND TODAY?

                 I'd rather play Hug O' War...
                 Where everyone hugs,
                 no one feathers and tars,
                 also no disparaging tugs.

                 Instead of the royal finger,
                 or the nasty belittling note,
                 addressed to a foe in anger
                 send a HUG and then emote.

                 Where everyone is polite,
                 and everyone grins...
                 everyone cuddles tight,
                 and everyone wins.

                          The Grand Emir Is Thirsty
                              Thanks to Roy Reed
                               rcreedv@juno.com

     An Arab diplomat visiting the US for the first time was being wined
     and dined by the State Department.  The Grand Emir was unused to the
     salt in American foods (french fries, cheeses, salami, anchovies
     etc.) and was constantly sending his manservant Abdul to fetch him a
     glass of water.

     Time and again, Abdul would scamper off and return with a glass of
     water, but then came the time when he returned empty-handed.

     "Abdul, you son of an ugly camel, where is my water?"  demanded the
     Grand Emir.

     "A thousand pardons, O Illustrious One,"  stammered the wretched
     Abdul, "white man sit on well."

                          Subject: Poetry contest...
                               Thanks to Ol'WDB

     The finals of the National Poetry Contest last year came down to two
     finalists. One was a San Francisco State University graduate from an
     upper crust family; well-bread, well-connected, and all that goes
     with it.

     The other finalist was a redneck from Texas A&M. A self-proclaimed
     die-hard Aggie. Go figure.

     The rules of the contest required each finalist to compose a
     four-line poem in one minute or less, and the poem had to contain
     the word "Timbuktu".

     The San Francisco State graduate went first. About thirty seconds
     after the clock started he jumped up and recited the following poem:

                 "Slowly across the desert sand
                  Trekked the dusty caravan.
                  Men on camels, two by two
                  Destination-Timbuktu."

     The audience went wild!!! How, they wondered could the redneck top
     that?!

     The clock started again and the redneck sat in silent thought.
     Finally, in the last few seconds, he jumped and recited:

                 "Tim and me, a-huntin' went.
                 Met three whores in a pop-up tent.

                 They was three, we was two,
                 So I bucked one and Timbuktu."
