Hello World!
   i am fond of the sound of the modem picking up a connection.  it
is a very nice sound, it makes me happy.  i like it.
   i also am fond of a blue folder which some generous person
donated to the Rockway Mennonite Thrift Store, where i bought it for
fifty cents.  It is worth more than money.
   The title on the cover is "Using the Newspaper in the Classroom;
a Manual of Suggestions for Secondary Schools", prepared by the
Educational Activities Department of The Globe and Mail.  There is a
name penned in red ink on its upper right hand corner which is:
P.ENNS.  Serendipitous, eh?  I wish to share with as many as
possible the words from a loose page found inside this precious blue
folder:

   Freedom of the Press

   Freedom of the press is not a special
   privilege of newspapers but derives
   from the fundamental right of
   every person to have full and free
   access to the facts in all matters that
   directly or indirectly concern him,
   and from his equal right to express
   and publish his opinions thereon
   and to hear and read the opinions
   of others.

   In protection of these fundamental
   human rights it is essential that
   the press should be free to gather
   news without obstruction or
   interference and free to publish the
   news and to comment thereon.

                     CANADIAN DAILY NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION

   Having quoted the above, i will stop worrying about whether or
not i should publish yet another article, and as usual include
everything that has been submitted.
   Thankyou for your contributions of expression, response, and
provocation,
   sylvia

Win95

Here is just a little blurb about what I think about Win95 ....

                                Win95

        I'm sure you've all heard of Win95 by now. If not you either
        live in a cave somewhere or have no brain activity. I've never
        seen so much hype over a computer program (Other than Doom). The
        one big advantage Win95 has is it's supporting software
        collection. OS/2 Warp was tested to be better at multi-tasking
        and has better internet utilities. Everyone is raving over the
        new mac-like interface. This comes as no big deal to me, there
        has been OS/2 Warp and a little known OS called GeoWorks around
        for a while and both are very user friendly. GeoWorks will no
        longer be creating Software for Desktops unfortunalty. It has
        all those file folders and stuff. The Point I'm trying to make
        is that Win95 dosen't really deserve all the hype it's getting.
        Sure it's a big step for Microsoft but the same sort of system
        has been avaiable for a couple of years now.

                                        Kevin McCauley

GUY KAWASAKI'S TOP 10 REASONS TO BUY WINDOWS 95

Below are the "Top 10 Reasons To Buy Windows 95" as delivered by Guy
Kawasaki during David Nagel's keynote address at Macworld Boston.

 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  

10) Do you know how much it costs to furnish a 35,000 square foot
house in Seattle?

9) You always wanted Microsoft to maintain a database of your hard
drive.

8) The access number for AOL is always busy, so you'd rather join
Microsoft Network.

7) Fewer Mac sales will mean you can get the 8100 you ordered 7 months
ago.

6) You finally have an excuse to upgrade your system.

5) You want to plug and plug and plug. (You don't mind waiting for the
play?)

4) Your mom is a Mercedes dealer in Seattle.

3) Internet is too full of information, so you'd like Bill Gates to
decide what you should see.

2) You think the Justice Department should be fighting monopolies not
crime.

MULTIMEDIA STYLES
------------------
In new book "I Sing The Body Electronic:  A Year With Microsoft on the
Multimedia Frontier," a senior Microsoft manager explains multimedia
"designers" (writers, artists, etc.) and "developers" (programmers):
"Designers are invariably female, are talkative, live in lofts, have
vegetarian diets and wear found objects in their ears.  Developers
are invariably male, eat fast food and don't talk except to say,
'Not true.'"
(Viking Publ. Co., 1995)

99 Best Hangouts Online

Ice hockey, stamp collecting, pig breeding, kinky sex--whatever your
interest,  you can indulge it online.   Come explore the most
intriguing, edifying, and fun places in cyberspace.

In the 1950s, we hung out at the soda shop, browsing through the
comics  and  buying  root-beer  floats from Pop Jenkins. By the late
1960s, my friends hung out behind the Kates' stable, dropping LSD.
The heavy-metal hangout of the 1970s was the 7-Eleven. The '80s had
no hangouts (part of the problem with that decade, I guess).  Now
we're here in the Information Superhighway '90s, and, not
surprisingly, the best place to hang is online.  And why not? It
has all the elements of the perfect hangout.  It's trendy, you meet
people there, our parents seem intimidated by it, and there is
FidoNews 12-37                 Page:  6                    11 Sep 1995

always something to discover.  But online sites are different from
the hangouts of previous decades.  They represent a revolution in
communication and information sharing.  They have managed to become
cool and useful places for almost anyone, without acquiring the
usual stigma associated with, for example, taking the useful (but
very uncool) family station wagon to pick up your date on Saturday
night.

Hanging out online has never been easier.  In addition to the
commercial services--CompuServe, America Online (AOL), Prodigy, and
GEnie--and their databases, message boards, and special-interest
groups, you'll find plenty of ways to access the Internet, that
worldwide network of mailing lists, databases, and discussion groups
that used to be available only to academics and government workers.
Both CompuServe and AOL let you easily subscribe to Internet
newsgroups. Other services, such as the WELL and Delphi, offer
Internet access as part of their subscription packages.

But if you want to have fun online, you have to spend some time
looking around.  That's the only way you'll find the goodies--whether
you want sound and movie clips, controversial conversation, free
software, or X-rated novels. And that means you'll have to become a
net cruiser.

Net cruising comes pretty easily to most people.  To get you started,
here are some of our favorite hangouts in cyberspace.  We've covered
everything from computers to crocheting, so you're bound to find
something you enjoy.  Once you get into the spirit of exploration, it
won't take long before you find your own favorite places--where you
feel most comfortable and can get to know the regulars.

Seth Godin is the author of The Internet White Pages and E-mail
Addresses of the Rich and Famous.

How Do I Get There?

You'll find a lot of, the hangouts we recommend on the commercial
online services America Online, CompuServe, GEnie, and Prodigy.
These services aren't free--you'll pay around $10 and up a month to
subscribe--but you'll get easy access to files, bulletin boards, and
members who share your interests.  To subscribe to any of the
services, call the numbers listed below to get copies of the
software and a password, or you can buy a new user's kit at your
local computer store. Membership is also available online;  using  a
standard terminal-emulation program (such as Windows' Terminal or
ZTerm for Macs) you can access CompuServe and GEnie, as well as
Delphi and the WELL.  Call the service to get a local access number,
use your modem to dial in, and follow the onscreen directions for
logging on.

America Online: (800) 827-6364 or (703) 448-8700.

CompuServe: (800) 848-8990 or (614) 457-8600.
FidoNews 12-37                 Page:  7                    11 Sep 1995


Delphi: (800) 695-4005 or (617) 491-3393.

GEnie: (800) 638-9636 or (301) 340-4000 (ask for GEnie).

Prodigy: (800) 776-3449.

The WELL: (415) 332-4335.

Each service uses a different term for navigating its various areas:
AOL's is keyword; Prodigy's, Jump; and CompuServe's, Go.  We use
these terms throughout.

What's a Newsgroup?

Newsgroups are Internet discussion groups that cover thousands of
topics from the prosaic to the weird.  The easiest way to access them
is through AOL or CompuServe; on AOL, use the keyword newsgroups,
and on CompuServe, type go internet.

Other services, such as Delphi and the WELL, also let you access
newsgroups, but you have to use special newsreader software to read
the messages.  Follow each service's directions for downloading and
using newsreaders.

What's FTP?

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a tool that lets you use the
Internet to download files from remote computers (FTP sites).  There
are hundreds of FTP sites scattered around for general access.  To
find out what files reside at the various sites, you can use a
search tool called Archie,  which regularly scans and records the
contents of FTP sites.  To access Archie, send an e-mail message to
archie@archie.mcgill.ca with a request in the header's subject line.

What's WWW?

A new way to access the Internet is via the World Wide Web, which
links documents and files on similar subjects located at different
sites.  The program Mosaic is an increasingly popular means of
getting to the WWW; CompuServe's Internet forum (go internet) offers
information on Mosaic, as do several books about the Internet.

What's a BBS?

Bulletin board systems, or BBSes, are small, specialized online
services, and there are thousands to choose from.  Many hardware and
software companies run BBSes to answer tech-support questions.  User
groups run BBSes so members can swap shareware and ideas.  And
interest groups set up BBSes just to discuss issues.  To access a
bulletin board system, use terminal emulation  software;  you'll
receive log-on instructions onscreen.  To find BBSes, contact your
local user group, check the back pages of computer publications, or
check out Boardwatch Magazine [(303) 973-6038].  If you have access
to the Internet, check out the newsgroup alt.bbs.ads, which features
FidoNews 12-37                 Page:  8                    11 Sep 1995

advertisements for a selection of diverse BBSes.

That's Entertainment

A little net surfing is the perfect prelude to an evening of channel
surfing-- or a visit to the video store.  Seth Godin shares his
favorite places to meet the stars online and points you to the
better fan hangouts.

Best places to dish: If you want showbiz gossip, and I mean dirt,
there's only one place go: the Internet newsgroup alt.showbiz.gossip.
It leaves the National Enquirer in the dust.  Alt.supermodels is
pretty good, too, especially if you're a fan of Fox TV's Models, Inc.

Best place to pick a video: The Internet Movie Database (World Wide
Web at http://www.msstate.edu/movies/) is an online database for
the readers of the Internet newsgroup rec.arts.movies.  It's filled
with all the information you'd ever want--and a whole lot you'd
never want--to know about motion pictures.  You can search for
credits from individual films and find all the films with a
particular actor or even a character.

Best place for armchair Siskels and Eberts: CompuServe's
ShowBiz-Media forum (go showbiz) can be a cramped hangout, but its
discussions of movies, films, and showbiz are fascinating and
educating.  Even Roger Ebert hangs out here.

Best place to meet the stars: Does Mick Jagger really cruise the
net?  One way to find out is to post a message to him the next time
he's the featured star in Prodigy's Ask the Stars bulletin board
(Jump:guest).  At the end of the week, selected questions are
answered by the star and posted to the bulletin board for all to
read.  Check with Prodigy to find out which stars are featured when.

Best place for showbiz info:  CompuServe's Hollywood Hotline (go
hollywood) is an online guide to movies, television programs, and
music recordings.  You can get reviews of all the popular TV shows
here, and there's a trivia quiz to keep you guessing.

Best place to meet a TV producer: The creator of Warner Brothers'
sci-fi TV series Babylon 5, Michael Straczynski, hangs out in
GEnie's Science Fiction Roundtable (SFRT2).  You can also find him on
the Internet in the Babylon 5 newsgroup rec.arts.sf.tv.babylon5.
It's tantalizing to have the producer available to answer questions
and dangle hints about upcoming episodes.

Best place for bizarre movie tales: Legends, rumors, and true tales
of the bizarre can be verified or debunked by a wide variety of
folks who have posted information on the Internet's Movie Legends
Database.  You'll  find plenty of strange facts about popular movies
from The Wizard of Oz to The Little Mermaid.  To get to the complete
collection, use FTP to reach cathouse.org  (/pub/cathouse/urban.
legends/movies).

Best places after midnight: Discussion of the world of late-night
FidoNews 12-37                 Page:  9                    11 Sep 1995

talk-show hosts is all over the net, especially in the newsgroups
alt.fan.letterman, alt.fan.jay-leno, alt.fan.conan-obrien, and the
catchall alt.tv.talkshows.late.  One of the best sources for
information and opinion about late night is in the electronic
newsletter Late Show News.  This weekly guide lets you in on what's
happening in late-night TV and in the TV industry at large.  (To
subscribe, send the message subscribe late-show-news to
listserv@mcs.net.)

Sports Crazy!

Mild-mannered writer David Noack's passion is sports--watching them,
discussing them, memorizing statistics, and reliving great plays.
Luckily for him, the online world is ready to feed his need to talk
about the Red Sox, download stats, or occasionally manage his own
ball club. So much for the neighborhood bar.

Best place for instant scores: Prodigy teamed up this year with the
nationwide sports cable channel ESPN to provide ESPNet (Jump: espn),
a nonstop virtual sports community.

Best place for Joe Montana fans: Prodigy's National Football League
Online Fan Club  (Jump:  nfl)  is an interactive area that puts
gridiron enthusiasts in touch with NFL players, breaking football
stories, and exclusive information on the game.

--cont'd next week!

From: Ryan Watson                          (1:2440/2)
Howdy... Here's my article...

I've not been quite an avid reader of the news, but of the ones that
I've seen lately, there aren't many articles.  Is this because noone
seems to care?  I'm not sure, but I do know that this is our
crowning newsletter, for all the sysops in FidoNet.

    I  recently went back to college, after an extended hiatus.  I'm
a Lab Assistant for the computer labs at Akron University  (Wayne
College).   I decided to FTP to FidoNet.org, and found some of the
history of Fidonet there for the public, an interesting start to say
the least.  There were also old FidoNet newsletters available there,
it's too bad that we don't or can't communicate like those who used
to.   It would greatly benefit all of the FidoNet community to
express our opinions and take our discussions not only to the
echoes, but also to the newsletter.

    In conclusion, let's hear it.  I can think of nothing that would
benefit us better than to be more informed, and also more involved.
I know that things have been sort of jumbled lately, but let's get
back to the business of keeping an intelligent and interesting, and
diverse community of people.

Dallas Hinton Falsifies Evidence In Policy Complaint

By Alan Boritz - 1:2605/102@fidonet.org

     A FidoNet RC falsify evidence against one of his fellow sysops?
Strange, but apparently true.  It seems that Dallas Hinton, a former
Canadian high school music teacher, currently the region 17
coordinator, and a sysop of three systems in the same network as Bob
Satti (net 153), was so eager to file a policy complaint against one
sysop that he skipped the most basic step in any Policy4 complaint
action (communication with the "problem" sysop).

     Mr. Hinton's "complaint" began with a netmail message.  This one,
in fact.  Note the date and time when written:

(85)    Thu 3 Aug 95 20:47                                      Cost: 0

Brent!

In a recent message in the WARNINGS echo, you signed yourself as:

If you post another message with a fake signature, you will be the
subject of a policy complaint.  Impersonation of a *C is not acceptable
behaviour in FidoNet.

24 hours later, Dallas Hinton posted a public message in the MODERATOR
conference announcing that he had ALREADY filed a PC against Mr. Hamm:

Hi Charles -- recently you wrote in a message to All:

CR> "The Terminator" has already started disrupting the WARNINGS
CR> echo and has convinced some users that he's its moderator.
CR> It's not the first time that this vandal/bully has caused
CR> havoc. Why is everyone afraid of him?

I would suggest that a flood of netmail to his Net Coordinator would
impress the NC to hint gently at him regarding the likelihood of his
node number lasting.

FYI, I have filed a policy complaint (section 1.3.5, paragraph 2,
sentence 5) with his NC (Will Wright) over Mr. Hamm signing himself as
"FidoNet International Coordinator".  I promptly received netmail from
a mental midget in a different net signing himself "Satanus Maximus"
and claiming to be "Regional Coordinator of Region 17".  Since I
haven't been told by the ZC that I've been replaced, I'll be filing a
PC against him, too. <sigh>.

That's more PCs in a week than I've filed my previous 8 years in
FidoNet.

Cheers ... Dallas

Let's recap the dates of those messages:

Thursday, 8/3/95 @ 20:47 - Hinton SENDS his 9.1 message.
Friday,   8/4/95 @ 20:55 - Hinton claims he's ALREADY filed a PC with
                           N2805C.

Mr. Hinton, supposedly an experienced RC and competent sysop, had
reason to know that a netmail response may not be immediately
forthcoming, since he had no way of knowing when Mr. Hamm would first
read his netmail message, and especially since Mr. Hinton has admitted
to having "problems" with netmail. And as an experienced sysop,
familiar with echomail topology and message propagation, Mr. Hinton
knows full well that echomail messages can take several days to travel
FidoNews 12-37                 Page: 12                    11 Sep 1995

through wide-area routing between Mr. Hamm's and his locations.

Although Mr. Hinton now claims to have "communicated" with the subject
of his PC, Mr. Hinton's own messages, presented to Will Wright (N2805C)
and posted publicly, show that he had NO intention of waiting for Mr.
Hamm's response to his 9.1 (required communication) message before
filing his PC, since he acted LONG before he could have reasonably
received either a response, or to see the results of his "request" in
the echomail conferences Mr. Hinton was reading that resulted in this
conflict.

A ridiculous PC based on a ridiculous "complaint," with no relation to
Policy4.  Hinton's complaint has already been struck down at the NC and
RC levels, though Hinton secretly filed his complaint with R14C (so
that the sysop against whom the complaint was filed would not have the
opportunity to respond to his appeal).  Will Hinton appeal secretly
(again) to Z1C, and will Bob Satti (Z1C) mysteriously "recover" long
enough to issue a decision on his friend's appeal?  Will Hinton abuse
more sysops though the Policy4 complaint/appeal process before Satti
resumes his duties as Z1C?  Stay tuned here to find out.

Dallas Hinton has refused to comment on these issues, but you can reach
him at 1:153/715@fidonet.org or dhinton@portal.ca.
