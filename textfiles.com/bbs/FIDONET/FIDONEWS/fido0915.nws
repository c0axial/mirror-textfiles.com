Editorial: NO TRESSPASSING

by Tom Jennings (1:1/1)

Once upon a time, the end.

I ahve a feeling this one won't be so accomodating. We seem to have a
flurry of people complaining about being treated badly. It's easy
enough to dismiss exactly half as blame wrongly placed, but I start to
wonder sometimes.

We don't have very good process for accepting new users and sysops,
and many sysops *are* downright pompous, far more than the usual human
spread. My opinion is that it's because you get the appearance of
"influence" over others, without any real accountability. Yeah I know,
sysops have it hard; don't forget, I *are* one. It's not that tough,
and when it is, you can simply give it up.

Part of me wonders: if this trickle becomes a flood, what to do with
all of these articles about problems connecting to FidoNet? We can
assume that this is the authors' last resort; after all running the
article here won't get them connected.

I've been thinking of this problem for a while. I know others have
been too. Maybe it would be nice if there was a conference for airing
these problems, with the goal of working on practical solutions
(though I admit griping only has it's usefulness...)

Don't ask me to start it.

A NECESSARY PATCH FOR NED 2.00

A few of us diehards still use NED, Anthony Lander's message
reader/editor, because it allows you to use the word processor or
text editor of your choice without giving you any grief about it
(unlike some programs that pretty much insist that you use their
built-in text editor).

Ned dates messages using a Fido-format date (for example:
Fri 27 Mar 92 04:05).  Unfortunately, during the first nine days of
the month, Ned outputs a leading zero in the date field (example:
Mon 06 Apr 92 02:14).  That leading zero is NOT standard, it should
be replaced by a blank (space).  If this is not done, some
downstream mail processors (Squish in particular) may discard the
message as grunged (the date doesn't meet FTSC specifications).
This could be a particularly galling problem since it would appear
to users of NED that messages are only getting through part of the
time, and unless you were aware of the problem, you'd never know
why.  Point system users may be particularly at risk since NED was
frequently used in point system setups for a while.

I haven't seen a new version of NED in nearly three years, so I
don't have high hopes for a fix from the author.  However, I have
discovered from limited testing that if you have access to a file
editor, you can fix the problem by changing only one byte of the
NED.EXE file.  If you don't know how to patch an .EXE file, find a
software hacker in your net who can help you.  Here's the fix:

In NED version 2.00, in the NED.EXE file, starting at File offset
62,648 (hex F4B8), you'll find the following hexadecimal byte
string:

25332E33 73202532 2E326420 25332E33 73202532 2E326400 25732025
322E3264 3A25322E 326400

In ASCII text format it looks like this:

%3.3s %2.2d %3.3s %2.2d.%s %2.2d:%2.2d
[day   date month  year     hour  min]

[The bottom line isn't in the file, it's just there to tell you what
the numbers in the first line represent.]

The actual byte you need to change is at File offset 62,657 (hex
F4C1).  The byte is currently hex 32 (the number "2" in ASCII) and
you need to change it to a hex 31 (the number "1"):

                    ^^
322E3264 3A25322E 326400

And in ASCII text format the change looks like this:

%3.3s %2.1d %3.3s %2.2d.%s %2.2d:%2.2d
         ^

Please note:  I tested this using a few different dates and it
seemed to work fine, but I don't guarantee anything.  If it doesn't
work for you, just don't enter any messages on the first nine days
of the month!  :-)  Or try a different reader/editor...  :-(

There -are- good people in this world after all

by Kenneth Udut (1:107/952)

This is my first posting to Fidonews, and hopefully not my last.  I am
a relatively new addition to the Fidonet community.  I entered Fidonet
mainly to harass the Fido/Internet Gateway here (1:107/10) by
receiving my college mail and LISTSERV mail (I run Y-
RIGHTS@SJUVM.BITNET - a list on the rights of kids and teens.  It'll
be a list on Fidonet if I can help it, but I'll wait until I
understand the political/technological structure better)  :)

I'd just like to reply to my friend Tom Jennings, who doesn't yet know
I'm a friend, but'll soon find out ;)

Tom, you are a great man!  I see people complaining to me about my
slow Tandy 1000 TL (286 8mhz) and how I should upgrade, but why?
Sure, I'd like to have a computer that rivals a mini-VAX running VMS
or an older IBM mainframe, but I frankly can't afford it (I can't even
afford to re-open my pro-Tandy/pro-KidsTeens/pro-Gay/Bigot-Accepting
BBS again which bothers me, but that's another story).


FidoNews 9-15                  Page 4                      13 Apr 1992


                 <<<< flame on >>>>   (medium flicker)


I see a trend in longer-running BBS sysops which says "Upgrade or
Die". It's the same trend I see in software development.  What you end
up having is a handful of people going up and up and up with their
computer's speed, power and efficiency, and a whole LOT of people
without even an inkling as to what a computer can do for them.

I think we should try to fill in the gaps.  Take the older computers
and "spruce them up" a bit.  Get Geoworks Ensemble (A WONDERFUL
program... but, then again, I Beta Test for them, so I'm biased ;D ),
toss it on their 10 Meg Hard Drives and send them on their way into
the world of computers.  We should give these non-computer people a
shot and get the world of PC's out of the hands of the Progressional
folks only, and get some of the power into the hands of the Average
Person.

Owning a computer can get to be a bit of the Ultimate Status Symbol,
allowing for Instant Gratification (don't you love Key Phrases?).
Once you get hooked on the power, it doesn't cost TOO much for the
person with a 40hr/week job to upgrade, and it allows them to get to a
power that they really don't need.  I applaud the people that stand by
their original computers... all the CoCos/Commadore 64s/Atari
xxxs/Apple ][s/early Tandys out there.  Some of us will say "Oh - get
a life!  The world is an IBM world now, baby, and you gotta flow along
with it". They seem to do just fine and dandy with what they have and
instead of spending their time getting the NEXT best thing, they use
their computers for what they were intended.   :::: applauding ::::


                       <<<< medium flame off >>>>


Sorry in advance for any/all offended.  These opinions are my own and
I accept responsibility only for those statements.  I also see the
other side of the coin quite clearly, because I find myself falling
into the trap every once in a while, and I know that I will be an
upgrade fanatic once I get some money together.  So I am probably
talking more about what I'm afraid of becoming rather than about you.
(5 cent psychological self-analyzation).

So, YEAH to Geoworks Ensemble, YEAH to Fidonet and YEAH, especially,
to Tom Jennings, who quite inspires this young gay male to move forth
through the world with the eyes of an Understanding One, instead of
falling into the trap of the Bigot, the ConMan, or the Elitist.

Thank You for accepting me kindly onto your terminal screens.

Everything In Moderation
By Ann Ioannides, 1:135/54


We all know who moderates echo participants - a moderator. But...who
moderates a moderator??

A simple question, perhaps.  Yet, I have been trying to find out the
answer for about a year.  No one can point me in the right direction.

Case in point.  I was EXTREMELY active on the INTERUSER echo.  But
then, I began to "go against the grain."  What did I do?  Did I flame
other users? Did I post advertisements?  Did I use profanity?  Did I
break the law? Did I do any of the "usual" things for which users get
in trouble on Fido echos?  No.

I was singled out by the Zone 1 Moderator, Dave Rawson, for such
criminal acts as accidentally allowing more than 10 of my posts per
day to enter the echo, having an offline reader that creates its own
tearline, and having tagline sayings at the end of my messages.

I corrected the first as soon as I realized what was happening (though
Dave continued to hold it over my head seemingly forever).  As for the
second and third, I was among many people who had similar tear- and
taglines in each of their messages (and many still do today), yet I,
alone, was singled out for attack by the Moderators.

When I was told that the reasons behind the moderatorial persecution
were monetary in nature (they claimed my tear- and taglines added to
the cost of the message), I asked a simple question:  Who is paying,
and how much?

I asked this question not only because I was curious, but also because
I  had, in the past, donated what I consider to be a rather large sum
of money to Joaquim Homrighausen when he was paying the overseas bills
for INTERUSER. I was planning on doing so again for the new link, as
thanks for gating the echo around the world.

To this day, however, I have never received an answer to this simple
question. (I repeated that question AT LEAST *3* times, in case they
missed it  somehow.)

It strikes me as a bit odd that my question was never even
acknowledged. Were the Moderators afraid that I would, again, donate
to this person, and  that they would no longer be able to justify
their attacks on my supposed waste of money?  While it sounds far-
fetched, no other reasonable answer has yet occurred to me.

FidoNews 9-15                  Page 6                      13 Apr 1992


While I was being attacked for my supposed rule-breaking, I committed
the  most heinous crime possible on INTERUSER:  I asked what I had
done wrong.   You see, ANY discussion of moderator policy on the echo
is prohibited,  except that the Moderators frequently violated their
own rules on this  subject!!  Of course I see the need to post the
rules, but I think that  Dave Rawson went a bit too far when he
launched into a pompous tirade  on moderator policy.  According to his
own rules, that belongs in Netmail.

Meanwhile, I decided to take a voluntary hiatus after Tomas Bremin,
another Moderator, SUGGESTED that I might be able to use a short
"cooling  off period" (no mention was ever made of banning me from the
echo).  Recently, after over 6 months away from INTERUSER, I decided
to pop back in for a little bit, just to re-acquaint myself with some
ol' buddies. A few days later, I was shocked to receive urgent
messages from two local Fido sysops, telling me to stop, because I
have been banned. "WHAT!?!??!"  I exclaimed, "_I_ have been banned?
When did this happen?? How come nobody told ME???"

It seems that Dave Rawson has netmailed my NEC, who has sent netmail
to every sysop in my area, warning them that I am jumping systems to
read INTERUSER.  Oh, please!  I mean, here I am, a high school
teacher...like,  I'm really the kind of person who would go around
from BBS to BBS just to post on this echo?  No, I don't think so.  To
me, it sounds like a bit of overreacting on the Moderator's part, or
perhaps paranoia (!??). Besides, I have a VERY good reputation locally
(I have been BBSing for about 10 years), and I know what is expected.
Honestly, I must say that  this seems to be a prime example of the
moderator trying to turn sysops against me.  I mean, why wasn't he
blunt about it and just say, "BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THE ROGUE USER,
ANN IOANNIDES!  SHE WILL CAUSE YOUR WHOLE NET TO LOSE ITS ACCESS!"
Give me a break!  Like, I'm out to bring systems  down. Riiiight!

After finding out I had been banned, I sent off more Netmail to the
Moderators asking them WHY I was banned, WHEN I had been banned, and
WHY none of them bothered to inform me of this.  I sent out this mail
on February 9th, and again on the 29th.  To the date of this writing,
I have received NO  RESPONSE from Dave Rawson, who was apparently the
one that had me banned.  The only  response I have received came from
Tomas Bremin, who is no longer a  Moderator, and who told me that he
had no say in the matter.  The only conclusion I  can  reach is that
Dave is ignoring me.  While this is totally his right, I  would expect
the Moderator of an international echo to at least acknowledge the
receipt of Netmail.  I mean, that's common courtesy, right?

So, the facts are these:  I was banned from INTERUSER for minor
infractions; the Moderators never bothered to inform me that I was
banned; now they won't even acknowledge my existence.

This incident is what prompted me to write this article.  To whom is a
user supposed to turn when s/he has a gripe about a moderator?  What
rights do the users have?  What rights do the moderators have?  Does
the echo REALLY belong to him/her?

FidoNews 9-15                  Page 7                      13 Apr 1992


In my netmail correspondence with the 3 moderators (at the time) of
INTERUSER I asked other questions, such as:  How long does a warning
last?  How long does a banishment last?  For life?  Who's to decide
when the person has "cooled off" long enough?

To this date, I have received no responses.

My question is this:  What can I do?

Is there any procedure in FidoNet for dealing with disputes of this
type,  or are users totally at the whim of anyone who happens to
become the  Moderator?

In other words, is there any way to show that a user has been wronged
by a moderator and thus regain access to the echo in question?

What I'd like to see come out of this is a set of "moderator's rights"
versus "user's rights," and for EVERYONE (not just a select few) to
know about them.  Perhaps noting them in the guidelines of each echo
would do.  I just think that ALL Fidousers should know what to expect,
in case anything similar happens to them.

If anyone out there would like to discuss this any further, or, if
you'd like complete details, including all the correspondence between
myself  and the INTERUSER Moderators, please feel free to netmail me
at either  1:135/54 or 1:233/12.  Also, we can discuss this on the
appropriate echos.    Whatever the case, I would REALLY like to hear
your opinions!!  :)

A Matter Of Courtesy
by Les Lemke (1:356/3)
523 Clark St., North Bend, Oregon 97420, USA (503) 756-3887

This is an article about courtesy and how the lack of it
affected a lady who desired to become a member of the Fido
community.

In March of 1992 I had occasion to come into contact with a lady
who lived in New Jersey. During the course of my contact with
her I, finding that it would be a nice gesture,  sent her a
letter informing her about the FrontDoor mailer and about the
free version of FrontDoor which she could obtain if she was
interested.

Along with that letter, I sent a somewhat condensed explanation
of how the FrontDoor mailer and network operates. I also sent
her all the listings out of the nodelist of individuals who lived
in her local area. I told her that if she wished I would be glad
to send her the program for the asking or, if she wished, she
could contact someone locally, in the area where she lived, out
of that listing of names and phone numbers which I had sent her.

FidoNews 9-15                  Page 8                      13 Apr 1992


I told her that I was certain that if she did make contact with
someone out of that list that I was sure they would be more than
glad to help her by providing her with the latest version of
FrontDoor and that they would more than likely provide her with
some assistance - on a local level - in setting things up.
I thought that when she made contact with someone out of that
list that they would help her into a local network by setting her
up as a Point. I guess I assumed too much.

Here in Net356 we have a Host, an NEC/HUB and various Nodes who
obtain great personal satisfaction and enjoyment in helping new
members into our local Network and eventually, if they desire it,
into the Fido Network as full fledged Nodes. It is through the
members of this local Net that I learned about the existence of
"something" called Fido. The members of Net356 were courteous,
helpful, and expressed an appreciation in having me as an addition
to their local network when I initially asked questions about
joining. I had thought this positive attitude would be found
elsewhere too.

Now, maybe I was a bit naive in my assumption that most Fido Nodes
and Hubs are as can be found in our local net - courteous and
helpful - but I firmly believe that is how it should be. Those of
us who are Nodes, Hosts, Hubs, NEC's or whatever should be courteous
and helpful not only to each other but also to those folks who
express a desire to learn more about the Fido Network. This should
apply - most especially - to potential new members.

If you wish to see the effect an uncourteous member of Fido can have
on a newcomer - or potential member to the Fido community -  read
the letter which follows. After receiving this letter from the lady
I responded with an apology to her on behalf of those of us who
believe we should help newcomers - not treat them badly.

Lastly - in case you are wondering - I have been able to contact a
Hub in the area which this lady lives who has expressed a willingness
to make her a point off of his system. This story ended happily,
however, I wonder how many didn't.

I quote her letter with the exception of the phone numbers which she
makes reference to:

Dear Mr. Lester R. Lemke

First of all, I received the registered version of COUNTY. Thank you
for such fast service. Most important of all, I wanted to write to
you about the Fidonet. If you remember, you included a letter about
them and how great they were. I found the idea very interesting, and
wanted to get the FrontDoor program. I called the Network numbers
you enclosed in your letter.

A large portion of the numbers are now disconnected. The two numbers
I was able to connect with were nasty and abusive. They were 201-XXX
-XXXX and 201-XXX-XXXX. Their intro was that it was a private bbs. I
typed what I wanted, then they gave me their screen of credits. They
asked me which language I wanted the program in; English or Italian.
Of course I put English. They then typed expletives and the word no.
Then they hung up.

If this is a sign of how these people are, thanks but no thanks. I
really just don't need the aggravation. I don't mean to put any blame
on you. You like the program a lot and are telling people about it. I
would do the same thing. I did want to tell you about this though,
because some people might not see the treatment I got tonight in the
same light. I really don't think you should recommend these BBS's for
this area.

I guess without the program they don't want any part of you. The
problem is that the program is unobtainable through anybody else. I
tried through PCLINK and America On Line.

Thanks for trying to be helpful, though.

Sincerely,

Mrs. Dorothy Hanussak

Re: A Public Request for Echomail Policy Clarification
by Al Kaufmann.

Rather than get involved in a long and futile argument about the
misleading information published recently in Fido news by Al Kaufman,
the Southern Alberta Sysops Association wishes to publish the
following;

We in the Southern Alberta Sysops Association (SASA) of net 134 wish
to
apologize for the remarks of Mr. Al Kaufman recently published in
Fidonews.
Nobody has ever been refused membership in SASA, including Mr.
Kaufman,
nor is there even a mechanism within the bylaws to provide for it.  We

MODEL_GEE, the Model Government Colloquium
by Rob Levin, 1:3802/217.0 (moderator)


This is to announce new echo, called MODEL_GEE.  It's presently
distributed privately from my board.  If enough interest exists,
we'll look at requesting backbone distribution.

Think of MODEL_GEE as a role-playing game for people interested in
government and voluntarism.  Set on the third planet of the Solar
System, it portrays a world in which every intelligent being has a
franchise, which he or she can bestow or withdraw at will.

If you don't like your government, you can change it.  If you can't
change it, start another one, in MODEL_GEE....


MODEL_GEE works this way:

1)  Assume that government is not a monopoly.  Decide what you want
to govern, and how you wish to govern it.  Prepare a constitution.
Make it as formal or informal as you want.

2)  Publish the constitution in the echo.

3)  Ask for feedback.  Negotiate your terms.  Find your constituency.

That's about it!  Presently, two arbitration agencies and three
governments have been formed.  Some serious, some not.  Some very
interesting traffic, and we hope you'll add to it.

The Model Government Colloquium

----------------------------------------------------------------------


by David Doyle, TOPPSI, Dublin, IRELAND (2:263/151)

Are you of Irish descent?  Or learning Irish/Gaelic?  Then read on...

COMHRA (the Irish for conversation) is an echo devoted to the Gaelic
languages; both Irish and its Scottish and Manx relations.

FidoNews 9-15                  Page 11                     13 Apr 1992


The echo is for those with any interest in the language, its history
and culture.  A link is setup between the echo and GAELIC-L, a bitnet
mailing list.  Many messages are bilingual with an English translation
to aid those who are learning.  The acute accent used in the language
is indicated by following an accented character with a "/"
character so the Irish for "Goodbye" is "Sla/n".

Fiu/ ma/s ar bheaga/n chumais tu/, glac do mhisneach chugat fe/in
agus bain triail as an me/id Gaeilge ata/ agat. Bi/ ag caint!

[No matter how little Irish you have, take your courage in your hands
and try out what you know. Talk!]

Also available is TOUR_IRELAND, a new echo aimed at intending vistors
who would like some information on where to go and things to see!

Interested?  Want a feed?  Contact David Doyle or Sean Mac Suibhne
on 2:263/151!

And last of all a Happy Birthday to Region 26 - we were 1 last week!

Announcing MAILBAG, by Charles Lasitter, 1:3641/1.206

This is a mail conference about the production and mass distribution of
letters, magazines and advertising circulars.  This conference is
oriented towards computerized processing of lists and production of
computer letters and labels.  The conference also covers postal
regulations and matters of printing and design relating to compliance
with those regulations.

The conference is open to discussions concerning mailings of 200 pieces
or more.  This excludes single-piece 1st class, 3rd class, and parcels,
but little else.  The conference is primarily oriented towards domestic
US mailings.  Extensive discussions of international mailings and any
discussion of mailings originating and destinating outside US should be
conducted elsewhere.

Topics on computerized processing includes areas such as Zip+4 and
other postal code assignments.  It also covers postal barcoding, walk
sequencing, CASS certification, National Change of Address processing,
automated ACS participation, Manifest Postage Payment, Optional
Procedure, Drop Shipping, Palletization and Destination entry.

Other areas of computerized processing include file conversion and
duplicate detection (merge/purge), ink jet and other methods of
addressing, and address standardization.

FidoNews 9-15                  Page 12                     13 Apr 1992


The conference will also address topics involving current and proposed
postal regulations, and to a lesser extent how changes in work rules or
other results of collective bargaining might change the flow of mail.

With 750,000 postal employees and numerous bargaining units in the US,
conference participants will be required to maintain civility in any
discussions of these latter areas.  No ad-hominem ("Union Brothers vs
Scabs") attacks will be tolerated.

Distribution will be private until sufficient interest warrants
otherwise.  Net-Mail Richard Lee, 1:3641/1 to get plugged in.

Progressive BBS Listing to be Made
By Randy Edwards, 1:128/105.0

   New news!  We're in the process of starting a Progressive BBS
listing!  This listing will allow BBS's oriented towards progressive
topics to easily locate each other, and it'll help inform users of
your BBS's particular interest or specialty.

   Now, 'Progressive' is defined as 'oriented towards progress,' and
in general terms, defines bulletin board systems of liberal, left,
and/or progressive political leanings.

   If you run a system specializing in topics such as: left politics,
civil liberties, human rights, alternative news, labor union news or
organizing, 'third world' communications, protecting our environment,
or any other 'progressive'-type issue, then we'd love to list your
BBS in our listing.

   However, if your system specializes in racism, KKK cheerleading,
republican party support, libertarian politics, voodoo economics,
slash-and-burn agriculture, etc., then sorry, we won't list your BBS.

   If you would like to have your system added to the Progressive BBS
Listing, please send an addition (see below) by e-mail to:

 FidoNet         : 1:128/105.0
 Internet        : Randy.Edwards@f105.n128.z1.fidonet.org.
 BBS data phone  : 1-719-392-7781, 300-9600 HST V42bis/MNP
 Location        : Colorado Springs, Colorado, U.S.A.

   You may also enter a BBS addition to the list by directly dialing
up the BBS listed above and entering the addition in as a message.

   Please submit BBS additions using the following format specs, and
including the following information:
