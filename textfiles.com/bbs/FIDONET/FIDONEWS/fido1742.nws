     Great Day, wonderful day, happy day! Our spirits are up! Our Fidonews
     is beginning to move in the right direction.  I apologize for the many
     posts by those persons in a religious `war' with each other. They saw
     an opportunity to move into Fnews echo in Doug's passing. It is ironic
     that the most un-christian mordant meanness exudes in the engagement,
     comprising the tranquility and purpose of the echo. The parties all
     claim the right to free speech, twisted to protect personal beliefs. I
     have reluctantly "put a lid on it" when it didn't go away in a few
     days.

     We have some new things to consider in our "letters to the editor"
     this week. Please take time to read them. I am especially looking
     forward to many replies to my querrie on articles posting in DUAL
     (two) languages. I have received no "Dual" articles as of this date.
     Eneryone says they are for it, no one has opposed...Yet. Janis and
     Winston have offered translation checking and will be busy if this
     scheme ever gets "off the ground".

     Several have already applauded the idea as long as an English
     translation accompanies the submitted articles and published with
     them. That may help with your "other" language by keeping you
     "refreshed".  It wont help with your "Pig latin" though.<chuckle>
     Anyway, let me know your opinion.

     Ooops...News flash... The "wonderful, happy day just crashed! News
     just came this morning of the cowardly attack by terrorists on a U.S
     Navy Destroyer Vessel as she entered port in Yemen for a four hour
     refueling operation.

     The explosion occurred aboard a small vessel assisting in docking and
     the damage killed 17 sailors and injured three dozen some severely.
     This is a major portion of the crew on a new destroyer such as the USS
     Cole and the ship was severely damaged in the suicide attack .

     Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those killed and of
     the sailors injured in the blast and we wish them a speedy recovery.
     We hope that those responsible will be brought to justice. I want to
     thank those readers who wrote me with their thoughts on this tragedy.

     *                Letters on the Ed's Desk
     From: "Matthew  C. Mc Carthy" 1:396/1.4 <mmc_c@juno.com>
     To: <editor@fidonews.org>

     Hi Warren.

     "The present officers being "grandfathered", (factored) in the plan. I
     personally like, "International_WWW.Fidonet" for a name. Let me hear
     what YOU think, please, that I may modify the ideas presented thus
     far. Bear in mind this is only a discussion of Policy 4.07".
     --------------------

     That last sentence should read:
      "Bear in mind this is only a discussion of Policy 1.00".

     The rationale being that Policy 4.07 was a non-ratified document that
     is held in esteem by some SysOps, and held in disregard by other
     SysOps. That particular document, in and of itself, is a great
     divisive factor within FidoNet!

     If we are going to build a 'new ladder', we should begin from scratch,
     and start from the bottom rung, Ver 1.0.  Even the term "policy" is in
     itself offensive to some SysOps!

     Perhaps the term "Protocol Ver 1.0" would provide a smoother starting
     point.

     _Everything_ in FidoNet should be first clearly defined within the
     document, ie: What is FidoNet?  What is a BBS?  What is a SysOp? What
     is a Hub?  What is Netmail?  What kinds of Netmail are there?  What is
     an Echo?  What is Echomail?  What is a Moderator?  What is the EList?
     What is the FTSC?  What is...  etc., etc.

     Once all the definitions are fixed, then the interrelations can be
     demonstrated.

     Beyond that point, there will be very little need for much "policy" as
     almost everything will have already been spelled out "by definition".

     One super-ambiguous phrase would likely remain valid though, and I can
     think of no better way to express it, 'do not annoy nor be easily
     annoyed'.

     ALL the "commoners" (SysOps) should be allowed to provide input, as
     well as be allowed to vote on the final product.

     Some areas likely for lively discussion would be those concerning ZMH,
     and the ability to receive Netmail.  All such discussions should be
     steered towards the NEW document, not the "way it's always been". What
     does FidoNet _need_ in the 21st century!

     ------------------------------------------------------------------- Hi
     Warren;

     Please don't take it as a criticism, but watching your initial "no
     rules" proclamation, and almost immediate ensuing flame-fest that
     occured in here, I couldn't help thinking that somewhere Doug Myers is
     having a good chuckle over your sudden "baptism by fire" as Editor and
     moderator of FIDONEWS.

     FWIW, I think you have handled the extrordinary (For FIDONEWS, at
     least) circumstances quite well, and considering things that were
     said, you showed remarkable tolerance and restraint.

     I'm sure it'll eventually get better here... ;)

     Thanks for your input! ol'wdb

              The How, When, Where and Why cookbook
                   of FidoNet File Distribution
            by Janis Kracht 1:2320/38 (janis@filegate.net)

     No doubt you are familiar with Fidonet's life-blood, the message
     echo which allows you to converse with people from all over the
     world.  Along with the echomail bundles you pick up daily, most
     likely you have the opportunity to also pick up file echos.  This
     'cousin' of echomail makes shareware and freeware files from all
     over the world available daily through the IFDC FileGate Project and
     the Fidonet Filebone.

     This article will attempt to provide a history of file distribution
     for the curious, and cover the essentials in file distribution on
     the bbs side, that is, the sysop who wants to make these files
     available on his BBS for end-users.  While it can't possibly replace
     the documentation for your file tossing software, it may help a bit
     in understanding the process.

     In the beginning ....
     (disclaimer: or far back as I can remember, corrections welcome <g>)

     In the late 80's-early 90's, Barry Geller wrote a neat tool to allow
     file archives to be distributed in much the same way as message
     echos, i.e., to go from one system to another.  His original TICK
     program took care of the receiving and forwarding of new files,
     while a companion program that Barry included, HATCH, allowed bbs
     sysops to release new files into the file stream.

     In Barry's word's:

     "     Tick is a program which does for files what echomail does for
     messages.  It was largely inspired by the program "Flea", by Ron
     Bemis."

     Before Barry developed TICK, file distribution was pretty much
     limited to file requests, or limited distribution to specific sites.
     Someone would collect files of interest to a specific audience and
     have some people pick up new files, etc.  Using this exciting new
     toy, TICK, a number of people began send out files they'd collected,
     or wrote themselves in distribution networks (FDNs).
     One-Stop-Shopping became the phrase of the day as coordinators were
     linked into FidoNet Star systems either directly, or through HUBs.

     Some of the pioneers of the day and their FDNs included: Larry
     Mundy's Win*Net, Eric Van Riper's PDN (Programmers Distribution
     Network), Peter Stern's DVNet, Al Davenport's DDS (Al lived about 15
     minutes from the Mid-Hudson NY city where I lived), Lee Laird's Ham
     fdn, Ray Kaliss' SDN, Tom Hendricks' SDS, Kevin's ANSI Club FDN, and
     Jerry Seward's Util*Net - apologies to any I've forgotten to include
     here <smile>.
     FIDONEWS 17-42               Page 6                   16 Oct 2000


     The Fidonet Stars then included George Peace, John Souvestre and
     Dave James.  When George Peace wrote a neat utility named RAID that
     worked with TICK to announce files, I'd bet that just about
     everything seemed perfect <smile>

     In the heyday of file echos, coordinators sought files everywhere
     they could, released them, new fdns were born to seek out yet more
     types of files, and went the files to the masses in Fidonet...

     Eventually this incredible growth began to put strains on our
     pockets, our drives, and most importantly, our file tossing software.
     Tick was unable to handle the huge numbers of links and file echo
     tags and so work was begun on software like FileManager, AllFix,
     and OS/2 native software.

     Along the time of modem/node number frenzy of the mid-90's when
     fidonet saw an incredible amount of growth, file distribution had
     become an expensive hobby, forcing a good number of folks to shrink
     their FDNs or reconsider the release of the latest titles.  To
     remedy this, a group of FDN Coordinators and interested overseas
     people approached U.S.Robotics Corporation's Adam Strack, who at the
     time was the manager of the Online Communications department.  I'd
     worked with Adam beforehand, helping him a bit to get a FidoNet
     compatible mailer running for the Corporate BBS that USRobotics
     hoped would provide support and sales in the FidoNet Community.

     The FileGate Project was born when Adam agreed to use the Online
     Communications Dept.'s phone lines, modems and systems to move our
     FDN files to sites located on 6 of the 7 major continents.  For the
     next 6 or 7 years, the FileGate FDNs placed a U.S.Robotics banner on
     archives as they were hatched as a thank you to U.S.Robotics.  The
     FileGate Project continues now with it's own archive comment which
     indicates where one can find out more about the project.

     FileGate files are now funneled into the filebone as well. I
     figured it would be the greatest chance for all of Fidonet to reap
     the benefits of the distribution and so the FileGate and Filebone
     began working hand in hand several years ago.

     These days, if you are not running AllFix, your BBS system probably
     has its own file tossing software included, or available from your
     bbs software author separately, or you may be running one of the
     free-ware tick compatible clones. I'm running BBBS bbs software, a
     shareware bbs program, which includes a tick-compatible file manager
     which is configured pretty easily in bbbs' ASCII text external.bbb
     file. (darn that's a lot of b's <g>)

     Essentially all file tossing software works the same way:  You tell
     the program where on your system you would like to store the files
     that come in, who will be sending the files to your system and to
     whom they should be sent once received, whether to make the files
     passthrough or not, and most likely, the bbs's name for the file
     area.

     Tick uses a simple ASCII configuration file which lists your
     zone-net-node info, work directory, etc. and a list of the area
     FIDONEWS 17-42               Page 7                   16 Oct 2000


     segments which indicates the areas you want to import.  Each segment
     represents a file echo, and that segment lists the nodes who will be
     sending that file echo to you, or picking up that file echo from
     you, and where you keep the files on your drives:

           Path               Tag
     ==================================
     Area c:\files\pdn\pdncee PDNHATCH
     1:2320/38 PASSWORD C 1:720/111
      PASSWORD &* 2:2/222 &*

     explanation:
     (1:2320/38 has files crashed to it)
     (other sites are "receive only" do not send)

     Area c:\files\pdn\PDNCEE
     1:2320/38 PASSWORD *&
     1:720/11 PASSWORD C
     2:2/222 PASSWORD C

     Explanation:
     (1:2320/38 is receive only)
     (Other nodes have files crashed to them)

     When tick is run in the mailer's batch file, it reads the .tic files
     in the incoming directory, moves the archives associated with the
     tic to the directory specified in your config file, updates the
     directory's file description (files.bbs type) file, generates new
     .tic files and file attach messages for your downlinks.

     Tick was great because I don't think I've seen a bbs software
     package that couldn't use it - perhaps not easily, but it could be
     done <smile>

     The shareware bbs program, BBBS, uses the following format for file
     echos in external.bbb on my linux box:

     F NODEDIFF   /bbbs/files/nodediff/ 1:2320/38 VA  1:103/105 109/921

     The F in the first column is a group designator which you can tie to
     permissions for access to the file echo.  VA says to make the area
     visible (V) and to create an ASCII text file regarding the release
     so that you can announce the file (A).  Node information regarding
     crash, hold, etc. is contained in the node section of the
     external.bbb file, though you can include it on this line if you
     like, i.e., >H1:103/105 (send this file to this node with Hold
     flavor for pickup)

     Allfix is shareware, and uses a config program (asetup) that you run
     to make changes to the config file. Asetup's interface is much like
     the FrontDoor mailer's config program - set up cannot be done in an
     ASCII config file.

                              End of Part I
                              Thanks Janice

     I am not the boss of my house.  I don't know how I lost it.  I don't
     know when I lost it. I don't think I ever had it. But I've seen the
     boss's job and I don't want it.
      --Bill Cosby

     In the last couple of weeks I have seen the ads for the Wonder Bra.
     Is that really a problem in this country?  Men not paying enough
     attention to women's breasts?
     --Hugh Grant

     We have women in the military, but they don't put us in the front
     lines.  They don't know if we can fight or if we can kill.  I think we
     can.  All the general has to do is walk over to the women and say,
     "You see the enemy over there?  They say you look fat in those
     uniforms."
     --Elayne Boosler

     There's a new medical crisis.  Doctors are reporting that many men are
     having allergic reactions to latex condoms.  They say they cause
     severe swelling.  So what's the problem?
     --Dustin Hoffman

     When the sun comes up, I have morals again.
      --Elizabeth Taylor

     There's very little advice in men's magazines, because men don't think
     there's a lot they don't know.  Women do.  Women want to learn. Men

     The problem with the designated driver program, it's not a desirable

     "What's the usual tip?" a man growled when the college boy who
     delivered his pizza.

     "Well," the student replied, "this is my first delivery, but the other
     guys said that if I got a quarter out of you, I'd be doing great."

     "That so?" grunted the man. "In that case, here's five dollars."

     "Thanks," the student said, "I'll put it in my college fund."

     "By the way, what are you studying?"

     "Applied psychology."

     When the preacher's car broke down on a country road, he walked to a
     nearby roadhouse to use the phone.  After calling for a tow truck, he
     spotted his old friend, Frank, drunk and shabbily dressed at the bar.
     "What happened to you, Frank?" asked the good reverend. "You used to
     be rich."

     Frank told a sad tale of bad investments that had led to his downfall.
     "Go home," the preacher said.  "Open your Bible at random, stick your
     finger on the page, and there will be God's answer."

     Some time later, the preacher bumped into Frank, who was wearing a
     Gucci suit, sporting a Rolex watch, and had just stepped out of a
     Mercedes.  "Frank," said the preacher, "I am glad to see things have
     really turned around for you."

     "Yes, preacher, and I owe it all to you," said Frank.  "I opened my
     Bible, put my finger down on the page and there was the answer....

     6.  It takes two tries to get up from the couch. 7.  When your idea of
     a night out is sitting on the patio. 8.  When happy hour is a nap. 9.

     Getting "lucky" means you found your car in the parking lot. 20. The

     Everything hurts, and what doesn't hurt - doesn't work. 23. You look
     for your glasses for half an hour and they were on your head the whole
     time. 24. You sink your teeth into a steak - and they stay there. 25.
     You give up all your bad habits and still don't feel good. 26. You
     have more patience, but it is actually that you just don't  care
     anymore. 27. You finally get your head together and your body starts
     falling apart. 28. You wonder how you could be over the hill when you
     don't even remember being on top of it. 29  Your doctor says, "You

     =================================================================
                           QUESTION OF THE WEEK
     =================================================================


     1. Your Question
     ---------------------------------
     A group of friends who prided themselves on their
     intelligence set out to have a contest of wits.

     Each person in turn asked a question, and anyone who
     volunteered an answer that was wrong dropped out. If
     no one could answer, the questioner himself had to
     answer, and if he was wrong, he dropped out.

     Each dropout had to put $5 into the pot.

     Eventually the matter boiled down to Thompson and Brown,
     and the erudition of each one boiled up so that both were
     held even for half an hour.

     Finally Thompson said, "How does a gopher dig a hole without
     leaving a mound of dirt at the lip?"

     Brown thought about that and said, "I can't answer that.
     However, since it's your question, you had better answer it."

     Thompson said coolly, as he reached for the accumulated
     pile of bills. "Easy. The gopher starts at the bottom of
     the hole and that's where he leaves the dirt."

     "Hold on," said Brown heatedly, grasping Thompson's wrist to
     prevent him from taking the pot. "How does the gopher get to
     the bottom of the hole in the first place?"

     "That's your question," said Thompson as he took the money.
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
