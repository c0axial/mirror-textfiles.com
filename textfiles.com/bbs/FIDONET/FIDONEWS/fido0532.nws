       The IFNA Should Focus on Advocacy for the Fidonet Hobby
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



     Members of the IFNA and participants in Fidonet agree that
     the IFNA is having a tough time coping with Fidonet's growth
     and remarkable technical advances.  Part of the problem is
     that the IFNA has not been able to anticipate the incredible
     success Fidonet has enjoyed.  It has tried, beyond the time
     when it is possible, to be all things to all people.  As a
     result, Fidonet has not fulfilled satisfactorily the
     expectations of anyone.

     I feel that there is a fundamental incompatibility within
     the IFNA:  On the one hand IFNA tries to run a net and
     balance all the competing interests of the net while at the
     same time attempting to play an advocacy role.

     Advocacy and service delivery do not mix well, hence all the
     complaints about, "An undemocratic Fidonet."  In my view,
     these complaints are a reflection of the mixing of
     incompatible missions in one organization, not a lack of
     democracy.

     It is time for the IFNA to re-position itself with a new,
     much narrower mission.  It is time for the IFNA to get out
     of the Fidonet business.  The mission of the IFNA should be
     to:

     - Increase understanding and support for the Fidonet hobby
       by disseminating information about networks using Fidonet
       technology to the general public and the
       telecommunications industry,

     - Maintain technical standards in order to ensure
       compatibility, portability, and high standards of
       performance within nets using the Fidonet technology,

     - Represent and protect the interests of the Fidonet
       community with manufacturers, government agencies, and
       common carriers in the United States and abroad, and

     - Maintain a visible, stable, financially responsible, and
       democratic association which acts as an open, accessible
       forum that brings people together for the common good of
       the hobby.
     FidoNews 5-32                Page 2                    8 Aug 1988


     You will note that there is nothing in this proposed mission
     statement about owning and maintaining a nodelist, or
     administering the Fidonet.  These are functions which the
     IFNA should phase down.

     A much reduced Fidonet should be maintained only for the
     internal use of the IFNA in carrying out its mission.  The
     Fidonet would then only be open to IFNA members and be
     devoted to exchange of information about technical
     standards, the latest rulings of the FCC and other
     authorities, efforts to advocate for favorable rulings,
     information about new products of interest to the Fidonet
     community, etc.

     Needless to say minutes of IFNA meetings, discussions
     regarding IFNA affairs, distribution of Fidonews, and even
     committee meetings would occur through the Fidonet.

     Already at least two alternative nets have emerged using
     Fidonet technology.  One is Alternet, the other is EggNet.
     A third, LCRNET (Least Cost Routing Net) has been proposed.
     Such nets should be encouraged, and a sysop should be able
     to choose among various nets based upon his interests and
     inclinations.

     Each of these nets will maintain their nodelist, and the new
     sysop would obtain a number in the net of his choice.
     Fidonet would seldom be an appropriate first choice unless
     the sysop had a strong commitment to participating in IFNA
     affairs.

     Gateways between the nets could be established at the local
     calling area level, so no one in one net should feel that he
     would be missing out in something happening in another net.
     These arrangements are already a reality in many areas.

     This approach addresses the question of the proportions of
     future nodelists, a problem which is most easily
     resolved by the existence of independent nets.

     The IFNA will end up stronger and more effective by
     restricting itself to an advocacy mission, and letting
     others administer nets, some democratic, some autocratic.
     Thus, a sysop will able to choose the net(s) he belongs
     to according to his interests, values, and philosophy.  Once
     IFNA has redefined a narrowed mission it will hopefully no
     longer be mired in a vortex of flames and devisiveness that
     has characterized its recent history.  Rather, it will be
     able to achieve its potential as an advocate of the Fidonet
     Hobby.

     Fido 301/1
     High Mesa Ranger's

     Well  it  is  that  time of the week  again.   I  just  finnished
     deleting  all  of  the messages and *.dat files  created  in  the
     message  areas  by Confmail and OPUS toss  functions.   For  some
     reason over the last 2 weeks I have had to kill almost 4 megs  of
     bad_bndl messages. At first I thought it may have been the system
     from  which  I was geting the mail from but it has seem  to  have
     also  gone over to another system which up til this week had been
     reliable.   There  we  a lot of duplicate messages  being  passed
     around but most of them were not getting into the system

     So in doing my normal purge of messages this PM I took the  giant
     step  for  BBSing around the world.   I used the Norton  WipeFile
     program and Wiped the files clean.   It has seem to clear up some
     of  the other problems I was starting to have.   Like time  being
     off.   I booted the system,  reset the time, and when it rebooted
     at  23:59 like it is suppose to it had a different date and  time
     than what I had set it with only moments earlier.

     After  having  our Net Echo Feed drop the majority  of  our  echo
     mail,  I  have scrambled to pick up the echo's from where ever  I
     could.   It  is impractical to make one phone call of 30  minutes
     each night, when you can make 2 phone calls of 10 minutes and get
     the same stuff.   Do not ask me why except that it seems that the
     backbone  may  be feeding more messages than the little  off  the
     wall pickup.   I should not call calling to Louisiana a little of
     the  wall.   But  it  is cheaper for me to call La than  to  call
     Pheonix.

     Well  here it is Saturday afternoon and after looking at the  log
     for last night I noticed I made connections with the usual boards
     and  picked  up  the usual mail but I did notice  there  were  no
     BAD_BNDl's  in  the root directory.   So apparently what we  have
     done here in 301 has at least temporarily fixed our minor problem
     of duplicate messages, and now the Bad Bundle fiasco.

     As mentioned in last weeks article,  though we may be one of  the
     smallest  net's around,  we are growing.   I have had request for
     two  new  node  numbers,  and as soon as  they  get  their  BBS's
     operational  and  send me net mail stating so I will  be  issuing
     node  numbers for these to.   So you can look forward to at least
     two more BBS's going online here in Albuquerque shortly.

     In the mean time,  as usual you are indeed reading the Fido  News
     Letter  if you are reading this article.   Or you are reading the
     High  Mesa Ranger's News Letter,  or you may well be reading  the
     OPUS Gazette.

          Well  after  getting node 301/4 set up and operational  last
     week I kinda figured this week would be a breeze.   I came in and
     was  doing  some work on the echo areas.   Deleteing those  I  no
     longer  was carrying and cleaning up the meassge area for  future
     use.   It  did not take very long to do all of this but it was  a
     tedious task.

          I had done everything I wanted to and was satisfied with  my
     acomplishments.  What I was hoping to do was reduce my phone bill
     for echo mail and gain some disk space back I had lost because of
     the  size of a couple of the message area I was getting.   I  had
     let  things  go  for  a couple of days when I  was  checking  the
     OPUS.LOG.   I noticed an error message I had not seen before.  It
     was:

     ! 25 Jul  1:09:23 OPUS Bad echo line: ` '

          I  for one had never seen that particular message before but
     being the good sysop I try to be.   I sat down at the machine and
     tried to figure out what was happening with my Echo Control file.
     I  spent about 3 days deleteing lines and adding lines  and  just
     plain  old  normal problem seeking.   After the 3rd day I  became
     rather frustrated and decided to do the sensible thing.   I  went
     in  and  make  a printed copy of my ctl file and then I  did  the
     ultimate.   I  erased the ECHO.CTL file completely and  restarted
     all over over again.  Apparently what ever it was was not visible
     to the naked eye or the careful look see of my wife.   I still do
     not know exactly what was causing the Bad echo line:  ` ' message
     but I suspect it could have been a blank space at the end of  one
     of the lines and I was just missing it.

          Well this week has come and gone rather quickly.   I spent a
     lot  of  time at the office writing some  application  files  for
     RBASE  for dos.   One which allows me to have the JULIAN date for
     leap years and normal years with out having to look on a piece of
     paper or calender it come up on the screen when I want it to.   I
     also spent a lot of time working on another one which will  allow
     me  to place the date and time a file was updated into a variable
     and a data column.  So I was rather busy here and at work also.

          It has been raining almost every night here in  Albuquerque,
     the  flood we had a couple of weeks ago has everyone watching the
     sky for those frequent rain storms.   It clears up in the morning
     but then in the afternoon when the heat starts to go up so do the
     clouds and then around 6PM here comes the little water drops.

          Well another month has gone by the way side also and summer
     is almost gone.  An it is time for me to close so I will get out
     of the way and let you read some of the other articles in the
     News Letter.

      TBBS User Group Symposium
      Larry Kayser


                      1st TBBS USER GROUP SYMPOSIUM

     Phil Becker has announced that "After being asked over the last
     year by many TBBS customers, and more recently after Larry Kayser
     twisted my arm a bit", he has decided to put together the 1st
     Annual TBBS User's Group Symposium.

     Since I did not get back out of the way fast enough I have been
     enlisted to help in putting together the program.  We have
     secured facilities in Denver for the meeting, and it will take
     place the Weekend of September 24th.  Plans are for a day and a
     half intensive meeting, with teaching seminars on Menu building,
     Editor usage, Large System Configuration etc."  The preliminary
     schedule is as follows :

     Breakout rooms and facilities will be available during the
     meeting to support any "birds of a feather" sessions that may
     develop.


     Phil has indicated that "My goal to provide an affordable and
     very useful meeting this first time out". Further more he
     indicated that " I intend this session to be of maximum use to
     those who know what they want to do with TBBS, but may not know
     HOW to do it.  You will leave the session with many concrete
     examples of techniques of information presentation which were
     fully explained in the seminar presentations.  These will also
     be made available to you on disks to take back along with
     printed workbooks.  I feel this session will be well worth the
     price of coming for all who can attend".

     The Priven Creed
     By Aaron Priven
     Fidonet 1:204/1154

     I dropped out of the various sysop echos some time back. I did
     this because I found myself too caught up in arguments over
     Fidonet policy. I found myself caught in a bitter argument with
     someone I respected greatly. (I still do.) I simply couldn't
     deal with the fact that someone like that could disagree with me
     that strongly -- strongly enough to flame me.

     I've realized now that the reason he did that wasn't because he
     really hated me. It was because he was too tied up with this
     authority thing that he couldn't grasp the fact that I was just
     stating an opinion. (He kept asking me who I was representing,
     what I stood to gain from what I said, and so on.) He was just
     too caught up in the power play of Net Politics to listen to what
     I said instead of a supposed ulterior motive.

     Well, I'm back now. It's not exactly my own choice. I am going
     away to school in September, and one of my users may be
     interested in taking over my BBS when that happens. Since that
     person has little technical expertise, and very little concept of
     the net itself, I thought it would help to give the person
     read-only access to these conferences and answer questions
     myself. But to do that I have to read the areas.

     So I am writing, mostly for my own benefit, a creed of what I
     will and will not do in these areas. It may not be easy to
     follow, but I will try.

     1. I will NOT respond to any messages about Fidonet or Echomail
     policy, or mention it in my own messages. It just isn't important
     enough to spend time and get stressed from. THE MAIL WILL STILL
     FLOW even if the policymaking structures fall on their faces.
     What's really important is the ability to communicate with
     people, and as long as that is accomplished, Fidonet is doing its
     job. If other people have other ideas of what Fidonet is supposed
     to do, that's ok, as long as the mail flows. (There may be
     exceptions to this -- for example, I read in INTERUSER that in
     some places there is a pseudo-IFNA rule that there is no
     political discussion allowed in any echos. This kind of
     censorship is overriding.)

     2. I will NOT flame anyone. If I do flame anyone I have been
     incredibly rude and have hurt the possibility of discussion.

     3. I will NOT respond to flames in a like manner. I WILL take
     flames seriously and critically examine them for truthful
     statements, and if I find any, try to correct flaws in myself.
     I am not perfect and I must recognize that.

     FidoNews 5-32                Page 9                    8 Aug 1988


     4. I WILL obey General Echomail Etiquette. (No ads in non-ad
     areas, no personal messages, no all-uppercase messages, etc.)

     Well, that's it. I can't think of any other rules to put down.
     I will try my hardest to obey this creed. It won't be easy, and
     at times I know I'll transgress the limits. If I do, please
     remind me.

     I give this to you in hopes that maybe one or two of you will
     realize what I've been trying to say: FIDONET POLICY IS NOT
     IMPORTANT. It doesn't matter. Who cares if there are two echomail
     distribution networks, or one, or eight, or 900. Who cares if
     there are independent zones or not. Who cares if there are two
     or twelve or six hundred little networks. It doesn't matter. You
     still get your echos, you still have a Fidonet address. The
     important things are all there. Let the rest alone and let those
     who really do have a Power Play mindset play with it. It doesn't
     matter anyway.

      Good luck to all of you,

      =Aaron= Priven
