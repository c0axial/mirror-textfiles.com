     Greetings,

     What the heck is going on with all this 'backbone' bull in Zone 1?
     Will somebody please sent me Netmail and tell me the full story?
     E-mail will also do, thanks.

     In the not to distant future, it's my intention to do some travelling
     to another Zone for a few weeks.  I'm looking for a stand-in or if you
     prefer, an assistant to take care of FidoNews.  If you are interested
     please sent me Netmail.

     Happy reading,

     Douglas Myers, 1:270/720, doug@mdtnbbs.com

     Despite another break in the Backbone, mail mover notables assure us
     that echomail will continue to flow.  The first crack in the
     Backbone occured recently when George Peace withdrew, citing
     differences with John Souvestre's strong-arm attempts to control the
     organization.  However, George didn't actually stop moving mail and,
     after the dust settled, echomail continued to flow.  Not to be
     outdone, John Souvestre last week quit the Backbone and started his
     own.  Supporters of the new Zone 1 Backbone (I count at least two)
     predict the demise of the old North American Backbone within 6
     months.

     It's ironic that as echomail volume decreases, presumably due to the
     increasing influence of the internet, echomail organization becomes
     increasingly complex.  At the moment, I'm aware of nine
     organizations dedicated to the distribution of echomail, and there
     are probably more:

                     FS -   FidoSpine
                     FTPB - FTP Bone
                     FTPH - FTP Hub
                     IHub - Internet Hub
                     NAB  - North American Backbone
                     PC   - Planet Connect
                     TFPD - The Funny Papers Distribution
                     WWB  - World Wide Backbone
                     Z1B  - Zone 1 Backbone

     Some have noted that all this splintering is actually good for Fido
     echomail, as the ensuing arguements about distribution methods are
     keeping the echoes alive.  If the past is a reliable guide, then the
     formation of the Z1B will keep the beef coming... we'll just have
     more 'bones to contend with.

     In the spirit of further divisiveness for the good of Fido echomail,
     I'd like to offer some more acronyms for the enterprising amoung us:

     POB  - Peace O' Bone.  Why shouldn't George have his own?
     WWF  - Hulk Hogan gets into echomail.
     Z1T  - Teens abandon AOL chat rooms and take to echomail.
     Z1P  - Compressed echomail with a new packet format:  PKZ1P.
     ZZZ  - For those of us who prefer to sleep through the echo wars.

     Announcement
     by John Bodoni, 1:284/99

     Greetings.

     It has become apparent that there are two distinct schools of
     thought regarding mail movement within Zone 1. Some members of
     the North American Backbone (NAB) are unsatisfied with the
     direction the distribution system has taken, others are content
     with the way things are currently being handled.

     The time has come for the two groups to part ways.

     The Zone 1 Backbone has been formed.

     Consisting of volunteers who are willing to be held to a group-
     defined standard of operation, the goal of the Zone 1 Backbone
     (Z1B) is to distribute echomail and echomail-routed-netmail as
     rapidly and reliably as possible.

     For further information about the Z1B, feel free to connect to
     the Z1BACKBONE conference, which should soon be available at a
     distribution system near you.

     John Bodoni
     Zone 1 Backbone Coordinator

     The nab is connected to the johnnie bone, the bobby bone is

                           By Bob Moravsik, the Southern Star

     We have just witnessed an event that made no difference.  Malcontent
     John John Souvestre resigned from his imaginary backbone and is
     posturing to start the JohnnyBone.  Souvestre has been Fidonet's
     malconrent, ever since he tried to enforce boppy on everybody that
     carried a message with 396/1 in the seenbye.
     Needless to say most of his "dicta" have been laughed at.   Now he
     wants to start another backbone of one and will take it upon himself
     to carry conferences when nobody asked that "his bone" carry them.
     Hence the Johnnybone has NO CONFERENCES unless he creates this
     fiction that the Johnnybone will carry all conferences unless asked
     not to.

     All moderators might want to carefully thinkout the wisdom of carrying
     conferences on the Johnnybone.  Remember, if this guy don't get his
     way, he gets very vindictive.  He's dropped conferences before on a
     whim.  If the Johnnybone doesn't carry any conferences, the nodes
     linked to the Johnnybone will SIMPLY route around the Johnnybone.
     FIDONEWS 16-08               Page 4                   22 Feb 1999


     Its been done before.

     The Johnnybone will have one conference for the Johnny groupies. The
     rest will be swiped from the FidoSpine or the BWP bone. (Or is it BW
     bone...hmmmmm).  We are all awaiting the unilateral proclamation from
     the Johnnybone on its officiality.  The real question on peoples minds
     is what "council" can this guy latch onto to fake you all into believe
     he's "official".

     We wait with unrelenting glee for this posturing.

     Regards  Bob

     An Alternative to Empty Echos and Dross-Filled Internet Newsgroups
     by Steve Quarrella, 1:124/9005 or fishpope@iname.com

     These days, folks are running off to the Internet in droves.  Well,
     I like the Internet as much as the next guy, but there is one area
     where I think Fidonet absolutely beats the tar out of the Internet.
     That's our message echos.  It is a constant annoyance to me to go
     into a certain newsgroup, looking for chatter or information, only
     to find it overrun by career flame artists, spammers, bullies, idle
     chatterers, and other destructive persons whose goal in life appears
     to be to suck the life out of the newsgroup and scare everybody off.

     While there ARE Internet alternatives, like moderated newsgroups and
     -- don't forget this one -- private mailing lists, I like to think
     our Fidonet echos are a wonderful alternative for folks who just like
     to talk.  I started my system because I liked participating in the
     echos, and I've always liked to think that anybody who shared the
     same interest would feel at home here at 1:124/9005.  We've got many
     conferences, covering a broad number of topics, and most are governed
     by reasonable people and guidelines that spare us from the
     aforementioned destructive behaviour.  Unfortunately, many of these
     conferences once had double digit per day traffic -- some of my
     favourites were MST3K, MUSIC, and ZYMURGY -- and they have since
     shrivelled up and have become shades of their former selves.  I
     personally moderate several echos whose readership has declined, for
     various reasons, and I don't care to see those conferences disappear
     into the wind.

     There _is_ an opportunity for us to have our cake and eat it, too.
     It's not a big secret, many folks are doing it, but it's time to
     spread the word.  I can't beat 'em, so I'll join 'em, in the form of
     a private, Internet mailing list that originates from Fidonet.  I
     have managed to breathe new life into some echos that faced certain
     extinction or crippling injuries due to the disappearance from the
     conference of the chatterboxes who made the echo worthwhile, and who
     kept things alive, just by doing what comes naturally.

     Alec Grynspan (1:2424/224, alec@gryn.com) has been kind enough to
     gate several of my echos to the Internet as mailing lists.  As
     moderator, I still retain a modicum of control over the echo --
     FIDONEWS 16-08               Page 5                   22 Feb 1999


     users are effectively users on Alec's system, and they cannot
     haphazardly subscribe and unsubscribe -- while at the same time, I
     have opened up the echo to people who might not otherwise have
     access to a local Fidonet node.  The most important thing is that
     the conference remains a Fidonet echo, and the talk keeps happening.
     This has had a tremendous effect on an echo like HOLYSMOKE -- I
     have one reader who wouldn't have a chance in hell of reading the
     echo over in Qatar -- and I've gotten a message from one reader of
     MOORCOCK who prefers the Fidonet echo to the spam-filled
     alt.books.moorcock.  Sounds like a win-win scenario for all involved.

     If this sounds like an appealing way to kickstart your conference,
     drop Alec a line at one of the addresses I mentioned.  Maybe we can
     get enough folks interested that Alec will need a secretary to handle
     the requests.  :)
