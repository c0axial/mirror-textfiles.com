    Well it had to happen eventually.  We arrived back from a
sunday afternoon do well after midnight, and we are late with
the snooze.  This is going out at 3:00 A.M. instead of midnight.
If that screws up anybody's delivery, sorry.

    Here is the snooze.

Echomod: An Echo Moderator's Utility

by Dana Bell

ECHOMOD - An Echo Moderator's Utility

While some are engaged in legal (or illegal) battles and others are
working on getting the FidoNet echolist together, I thought some of
you might want to try this little utility.  ECHOMOD will allow
moderators or appropriate messengers for the echolist, to maintain
their own database of echoes from which they can automatically submit
updates to either ECHOBASE or the FidoNet-based ELIST.

The options here are primarily intended to assist moderators in their
duties to keep the echolist up-to-date.  It might look like it, but
this isn't the manual.  It's just seemed to be a good way to show and
tell what ECHOMOD is and does.  Since the Echolist requirements and
products are changing, I'm constantly making changes here to support
them.  Since it's also a new concept, I'm getting new ideas for it all
the time.  All that means, of course, is that there is a greater
possibility of you finding bugs in the program until everything
settles down.

If you want to give it a shot, FReq ECHOMOD from someone near you that
has it, or from me at 1:3801/6.  NOTE: ANSI.SYS is required and (so
far) ECHOMOD uses FD style messages. With a little manipulation you
might also be able to use it with your BBS program.

ECHOMOD Abstract begins here:

   ECHOMOD CONFIG

The ECHOMOD configuration allows you to identify yourself, some paths,
and then designate a ListKeeper you want to submit MOD UPDs to.  In
FidoNet, it would be ECHOLIST at 1:1/201@fidonet.org.  Once a
configuration file has been created with the ECHOMOD CONFIG command,
the primary options that facilitate this are:

   ADD
   EDIT <areatag>
   SUBMIT <areatag> to <address>
   AUTO
   POST RULES <areatag>
   ELIST <filespec>
FidoNews 12-28                 Page:  3                    10 Jul 1995


   ECHOMOD ADD <areatag>
This command is used to ADD echoes to the database.  In additions you
will be prompted for each field.  Once a conference has been added to
the database, you can later edit it with the EDIT command or while in
BROWSE mode.

   ECHOMOD EDIT <areatag>
The EDIT option allows you to make changes in the echo's entry.  This
will also allow you to update the echo, as well as change the Active
Status of the echo.  This is also the only way to "change" the areatag
of an echo.  To edit the Long Description press F4.

   ECHOMOD SUBMIT <areatag> to <address>
This is the "magic" of this program.  This option will submit the echo
to the ECHOLIST as defined in the configuration.  This option creates
a netmail in the keyword/key information format that can be processed
by Echobase or ELIST.  The information is taken from the echobase
database.  If an address is listed on the command-line, the message
will be sent to ECHOLIST at that address.  Otherwise, the netmail
message will be sent to the address specified in the ECHOMOD
configuration.  A line will be displayed when a submission message has
been generated with the message number.  You can go to the message to
check and/or edit it.  Note: Submissions can also be made while in
Browse mode, by selecting F3 (update & submit) or F6 (submit).

   ECHOMOD AUTO
This is some more of the magic.  When this option is run, ECHOMOD will
check the database for echoes that haven't been updated in
<UpdatePeriod> days, updates them and submits them to the ListKeeper.

   ECHOMOD POST RULES <areatag>
The post option can be used to post the designated rule file for a
conference as a message in that conference.  Ideally, the designated
file should be a plain text file and should not contain echomail
control characters or sequences such as "---", $EEN-BY, etc.

   ECHOBASE ELIST <filespec>
This is an import function that will convert entries found in
<filespec> (or ELIST.CUT) and in the format of the International
Echolist and add them to the database CONVERTS.DAT.  This function
will convert each entry found, display it and prompt to save and go to
next, skip or edit the entry.  You can use this to cut your current
entry out of the International Echolist and then convert it to use in
the database.  Of course, this is also a handy way to create a
"browse-able" version of the EList.

   ECHOMOD BROWSE <database>
This displays a scrollable list of echoes in the echobase.  Select the
echo to edit and press enter to edit.  When finished editing, the
scrollable list will be re-displayed.  Press ESC to quit.  When in
BROWSE mode, you can page through the echoes and edit any that need
modifications.  Before paging to the next echo, however, you will be
prompted to save if anything has been changed.  Browse mode will also
allow you to SUBMIT an echo by pressing either F3 (update then
FidoNews 12-28                 Page:  4                    10 Jul 1995

submit), or F6 (submit).

Other options are also available for the manipulation and
maintenance of the database.
   ECHOMOD DISPLAY <areatag> <LIKE [format file]>
   ECHOMOD DROP <areatag>
   ECHOMOD SORT
   ECHOMOD PACK
   ECHOMOD COPY spec <database> /<U|S|A>
      spec = <tagspec|ALL|DELETED|@group|^moderator|~messenger|
             ![areafile]/#node>
   ECHOMOD IMPORT <database> /<U|S>
   ECHOMOD TRAFFIC <filespec>
   ECHOMOD LIST <SHORT/LONG/LIKE [format file]/DELETED/
             ACTIVE/INACTIVE/@group/![areafile]/#node>^moderator>

The current version of ECHOMOD can be FileRequested from Baby Blue BBS
at 1:3801/6.

Don't miss this opportunity ...

preface ... I wanted to let you know about a project I'm starting.
The Snooze seemed like an appropriate place to announce it, since
it's one of the primary sources of inspiration.  Also, special thanks
go to the Bobs ... Chalmers, Moravsik and Germer in no particular
order.

so ... here's the drum roll ....

ANNOUNCING
                     THE GET A LIFE FOUNDATION

  A special program created by and for Fidonet Sysops.  You can
become a member and plankowner in the GET A LIFE foundation by
submitting your listing to the Fidonet Phone Book (aka nodelist)
before 12/31/95.  (Members who submit 3am Christmas morning will
receive special consideration for any LIVES which become available.)

  Membership in the GET A LIFE FOUNDATION offers the following
benefits:

  Your name will be added to the fishbowl for the FOUNDATION's monthly
   drawing for A LIFE.
  Access to Inspirational stories of other sysops who GOT LIVES.
  Photographs and videos of A LIFE are available at a disounted rate
   to members.
  GAL members get one free session with a cybertherapist who will
   make you feel better by reminding you that it's your parent's fault
   you DON'T HAVE A LIFE.
  GAL members get one free session with a cybercounselor who will
   make you feel better by reminding you that it's your spouse's fault
   you DON'T HAVE A LIFE.
  GAL members also get a session with our cyberattorney ... who will
FidoNews 12-28                 Page:  5                    10 Jul 1995

   charge you $250 for NOT HAVING A LIFE.

  and many additional benefits, which you will discover as they are
dropped on your doorstep.  (BTW, sign up before 9/15 and receive a
free benefit-scooper!)

  If by some freak chance, you have aquired A LIFE and are still a
member of FIDONET, you will be able to ...

   Feel good about helping others discover what A LIFE is.
   Gloat because you HAVE A LIFE.  (oops! ... nevermind)
   If you're not happy with your LIFE, you can donate it to our
    monthly drawing ... much cheaper than divorcing your wife :)

  I urge all of you to get your name into the nodelist and GET A
LIFE today ...

grins.

Disney Images

Disney Images

Ha!  Fooled you all, this is really about lawsuits!

Our Planet Connect downlink went into REM sleep while its master
was away for the day, so I have no echomail to read at the
moment.  Those of you who have read my previous articles here
know what that means: I spent an hour catching up on FidoNews,
and that has given me an irresistable urge to punish you all with
yet another contribution.

Actually, Disney images are what I was thinking about.  In my
youth, the Disney empire (merely a vigorous duchy in those olden
times) had a weekly television show which provided a mix of
drama, cartoons, nature documentaries, and so forth.  One of my
most vivid memories is of the time-lapse photography which they
often showcased: in a matter of moments you could watch a beehive
being constructed, a bird build a nest, or a flower bloom and
die.  (This was decades before the VCR, which allows anyone with
a remote control to see a mountain of fast food bloom and die.)

Time-lapse photography provides a remarkable perspective.
Imagine what your life would look like if it were compressed into
two minutes.  If that isn't depressing enough, imagine what two
months of FidoNews looks like when similarly compressed.

I guess the hot issue is lawsuits.  Well, be forewarned that I am
NOT a lawyer, nor do I play one in BMW commercials.  However I
FidoNews 12-28                 Page:  6                    10 Jul 1995

do, as a matter of prudence, have a $1,000,000 personal liability
umbrella policy; so sue me.  I'm sure my insurance company can
find a decent lawyer: one who knows the meaning of the term
"barratry".

More Disney images: the whole exchange between Messrs.  Germer et
al reminds me of nothing so much as a Disney cartoon, one of the
ones where the two chipmunks, Chip and Dale, are pestering Donald
Duck.  Chip and Dale are always stealing Donald's apples, nesting
in his slippers, or something equally "bad." Donald Duck always
throws a truly spectacular tantrum.  This, of course, delights
Chip and Dale, and incites them to yet more outrages.  Donald
brings out the traps, the guns, the high explosives, and even
more spectacular tantrums; and so it goes.  The chipmunks usually
win, of course, because Donald eventually succumbs to exhaustion.

My mind has no trouble at all recasting the cartoons in modern
times, with Chip and Dale playing to the jury while Donald raises
objection after objection before the bench.

So now you all know how I see this business.  It's a pity that
the participants can't see themselves through Disney's lens; of
course, if they could then none of this would come to light.  I
don't know what went on between Mr.  Germer and his antagonists;
but I can see that both the pompous, self-righteous Donald Duck
and the devil may care, hit him with an apple core and see him
foam at the mouth chipmunks share the blame for what happens.

When I hear children arguing, it amazes and amuses me that "I'll
sue you" has replaced "I'll tell my father" as the ultimate
threat.

        "Ma, he's looking at me!"

                "So sue him for harassment."

I suspect that if you hear yourself talking like your children,
you should think about what you're saying.

Simple NetwOrk Oversight Protocol

From: Speaker to Fundies                   (1:102/890)

The SNOOP project is nearly finished.   I need two software
engineers willing to form a small work group which will review
the design and first implimentation and then take over the
maintenance of the project.  I also need a series of sites to
perform Beta testing for SNOOP.EXE.

If anyone is interested in being in the work group or being a
Beta sites, please let me know.  SNOOP is running on my system
and appears to be working according to the first design
specification set forth but it can't be released until it has
been finished and tested.

Information on the SNOOP project (which helps FidoNetters get
an idea on the amount of Echo mail they never see) can be found
by downloading SNOOP.DOC.
