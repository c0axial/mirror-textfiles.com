     Greetings,

     Since Douglas Myers did a stand-in editor job while I was away,
     I have given the job to him.  Any complains?  No, I knew you would
     agree. ;-)

     Doug will take over as from issue 38, or 20 September 1999.

     Happy reading,

                               Welcome to "InfoMail"

     Useing this program/service is very simple.

     1. Enter a Netmail message to "InfoMail" without the quotes.
     (capitalization isn't important) Fidonet address, 1:124/6308
     You can send this "Routed" or "Crash". _ALL_ replies will be "Routed"

     2. For a subject, put the document that you want to receive
     If you don't know, or just want to search for a word in the list,
     send the Netmail to "InfoMail Search" <sans quote> and put the word
     you are looking for in the Subject area.

     3. In the text area, put anything you like. This is ignored but
     required for many mailers to handle the message.

     Upon receiving the message, my system will search the document list
     for a match and send the response back to you via a Netmail message.

     Please let me know if there are errors. I'm only human and make
     mistakes like anyone else. :-)

                       Z-snips: the Legacy of Star Wars
                       Douglas Myers          1:270/720

     A while back, when the North American Backbone (NAB) was the
     undisputed prime mover of mail in Zone 1, I reported and commented
     on the upheavals of the Star systems of the NAB.  Though the Star
     Systems of that time are still prominent, new players on the scene
     tend to call themselves Z-hubs now.  The major storms which led to
     the splintering of the NAB are still around, but they're spread
     thinner among new players now.  The Fidonews Weather Service has
     downgraded these storms from "Star Wars" to "Z-snips."

     Why are the Z-hubs snipping at each other these days?  The answer is
     most likely two-fold.  1) Fidonet is aptly nicknamed Fight-o-net in
     that old hostilities never seem to die and new ones are constantly
     discovered.  2) There are more problems with echomail distribution
     than there were when the structure was more monolithic.

     Leaving number 1 alone above, let's look at number 2:  why are there
     more problems?  Mostly it's a matter of increased complexity in the
     top level of distribution (Star distribution or Z-hub distribution).
     The Star distribution until very recently was relatively simple:

                                     A
                                   /   \
                                  B --- C

     Three star systems polled each other frequently throughout the day,
     and all other echomail feeds were derived from one of these systems
     (at least ideally).  The system had the advantage of rapid mail
     delivery and no inherent problem with duplicates.
     FIDONEWS 16-36               Page 5                    6 Sep 1999


     Towards the end of 1998, however, a fourth star system was added to
     the structure:

                                     A
                                   / | \
                                 B - + - C
                                   \ | /
                                     D

     This seemed like a good idea at the time, as it incorporated the
     Fidospine distribution system under the NAB system... it seemed just
     recognition of a situation which already existed.  However, it did
     increase the complexity of the structure to the extent that all four
     systems had to cooperate even more than before to ensure the smooth
     flow of mail - and unwillingness to cooperate ultimately splintered
     the NAB.

     This system was susceptible to duplicate message generation if one
     system decided to stop polling another system.  To visualize this,
     imagine that system A decides to disconnect system D.  Before the
     cut, system A would add system D's node number to the "seen-by"
     control lines of each echomail message it would process for him
     before sending it to him.  The echomail processors at nodes B and C
     would read the seen-by line before making mail packets, and not
     include this message for system D.  However, once system A cuts
     system D and stops adding this number to the seen-by line, both
     systems B and C will pack the message for system D, resulting in
     duplicate messages at system D.

     Though these duplicates were generated during the spats which
     characterized the period right before the NAB splintered, virtually
     all of them were detected by a cyclic redundancy check at the
     systems getting these dupes, and few were passed on.  So the problem
     was more imagined than real, but it fueled the arguments over
     non-technical issues (such as who was in charge) and ultimately led
     to the withdrawal of systems from the NAB to start the Z1B.

     The current issue rocking the tranquility of echomail distribution
     seems to be an ongoing argument between John Souvestre and Alec
     Grynspan.  John has, in the recent past, disconnected from all NAB
     Star systems except George Peace in an effort to prevent the
     generation of duplicates.  Alec has recently expanded his echomail
     connections to span both the Z1B distribution and the NAB
     distribution, effectively establishing a mesh which can lead to
     duplicates.  John has shown a portion of his logs which indicate
     that at least one duplicate flowed through Alec's system.  How
     extensive the problem is truly is unknown to me, but the argument
     itself has the potential for destabilization.  It's reminiscent of
     the arguments between John and Bob Seaborn before the splintering
     of the NAB.
