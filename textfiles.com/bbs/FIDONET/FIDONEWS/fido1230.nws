Hugs to 'ya!

by Don Dawson  1:150/730
Hugs to 'ya!

There's one thing we all have in common.  We're all insecure about
something, sometime in our lives.  It matters not if we're 8 or 80.

The root cause of our insecurity changes as we grow.  As babies we're
insecure about our next meal.  When we're teenagers we're insecure
about many things:

.  Will anyone notice my zits?
.  Are my clothes "ok"?
.  Will s/he go out with me Saturday night?
.  Will mom/dad let me use the car?  This is REALLY important!
.  Can I get the money to go to the movies/dance/prom?
.  Will ANY College accept Meeeeeeeeee?

We eventually "settle down"...have a relationship with a Significant
Other.  The insecurities change to other things...

.  Can we get that apartment/house on our income?
.  Will the bank lend us the money for the car we need?
.  Will the baby be healthy/a boy/a girl/blonde/brunnette?
.  Will I get the job/promotion?
.  Can we get the kid(s)s thru school/college/braces?
.  Can we afford the dental/education/wedding expenses for her/him?

And the list goes on, changing as we grow, changing as we age and
mature, taking on new and different responsibilities over the years.

Along comes FidoNet (or something like it)..a new and different way
to communicate.  Some avoid communications completely.  You've known
those people all your life.  No calls on the phone, no Christmas
card, no "just dropping by". It happens, people are people.  We don't
all look alike nor do we think alike or have the same values.

Want to try something new, different...exciting even?  When you send
netmail or echomail sign it:

<HUG>,  a big HUG or...
<hug>,  a little hug or ...
<hugs>, several little hugs...

You'll be pleasantly surprised at the reaction.  You'll feel better
too.  It's non-threating, no cost and very special.  People know you
care.  You'll make someone happy.  You'll make them more secure about
themselves. They might wonder about you but that's what makes our
hobby fun!

AOP.ZIP USRSDL.EXE
From: Adam Strack(1:115/500)

  Thanks for having a FIDO node available.  I've taken this
opportunity to upload two great files to your system. One is
the latest information pack for the Association of Online
Professionals.  The AOP is made up of members just like you as
well as leaders in the industry such as US Robotics, Software
Creation's, Rockwell International, Hayes and others.  The
second file is the latest breakthrough in US Robotics Desktop
modem technology...33,600!

  If you have the FLASHROM upgradeble US Robotics Courier
modem, simply extract the USRSDL.EXE archive and flash the
newest code.  33,600 technology is an extension of V.34.
Connect to other USR Courier 33,600's at greater speed and
connect to other V.34 modems with greater throughput and
connectability than before. If you don't have a USR Courier
yet, pass the file along to a friend that does, and then go get
one yourself!

Regards,

US Robotics
