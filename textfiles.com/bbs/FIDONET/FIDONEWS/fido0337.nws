     =================================================================
                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     This week's guest editorial is by Karl Schinke, "The Wizard of
     Bendix", node 107/16

                     Amateur Radio and Electronic Mail

         I   gather   from   some   references   to   "amateur   radio
     organizations"  that  someone  has pointed out a parallel between
     the state of Fido sysops now and the state of radio "Hams" before
     Hiram Walker and friends founded the ARRL  (Amateur  Radio  Relay
     League).

         Hams had  demonstrated  that  wavelengths  shorter  than  200
     meters  (yeah,  200  METERS) were usable for communications,  and
     commercial  pressure  groups   were   squeezing   the   FCC   and
     international  equivalents into allocating all the radio space to
     commercial use, with no room for the "hams".  This after they had
     gobbled up all  the  space  below  200  and  left  the  hams  the
     "useless" frequencies above, where they "could do no harm".

         Hmmm.  Commercial pressure for "pay BBS" like Compuserve?

         The ARRL has provided many useful services for hams,  members
     and non,  by "watching for their interests" in Washington DC  and
     internationally,  publishing handbooks and guides, etc etc.  THEY
     REQUIRE A MEMBERSHIP FEE.

         I'm sure we can think of many other parallels where hobbyists
     have  had  to  band  together under an organization to make their
     hobby practical,  make sure that our friends in Washington  don't
     make  it  illegal,  and to assist the hobbyist with executing his
     hobby.

         Even without the 25,000 Fidos that have  been  postulated  (a
     not unlikely situation), but even AS WE NOW ARE we have problems.
     In  a  flick  of  a few pens,  our "representatives" can wipe our
     hobby out WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING THEY ARE DOING IT,  as the  rumors
     about various "kiddy porn" bills and "freedom of information" and
     "right to privacy" stuff has shown.

         Can  we  exist much longer without a lobby?  I doubt it.  And
     who will support such a lobby, if not we,  the BBS sysops who CAN
     COMMUNICATE  with  each  other.  But  still  we  can't without an
     organization.  None of us individually can afford it!

         This  even  without  the  question of media relations that is
     killing Kaplan (from what I  hear).  What  is  the  "man  in  the
     street"  opinion of BBS's?  A bunch of smartaleck kids who try to
     start World War Three,  or break into banks,  or move  satellites
     out  of orbit.  How do you think they'd vote on whether we should
     be allowed to operate?  Who's gonna change  public  opinion?  The
     "media".  And whose gonna sway them?  Hunh?

     Ken Kaplan, node 1/2

                             IFNA Expenditures


     I apologize for taking so long to make this data public.  Due  to
     the  enormous  amount  of  Net  mail,  voice phone calls,  and an
     increased work load (and traveling) at my "real" job,  I have had
     very little time since the conference to respond.  This is not an
     IFNA budget, but it *IS* a start, and eventually, may become part
     of the IFNA budget.


     The IFNA expenditures in St.  Louis are running between $6000 and
     $7000 a year at current expenses  and  growing  as  the  nodelist
     expands.  This includes voice phone bills originated by Ben Baker
     and I that are running around $400/month of which some $100/month
     goes  to  overseas  support.  This  includes  three  support Fido
     systems,  supplies,   stationary,   marketing,   press  releases,
     answering some 50 letters per week about Fido, stamps, P.O.  Box,
     hardware  maintenance,   checking  account  and  IFNA  Conference
     preparation.  The  legal  and  accounting fees to incorporate are
     also included.

     The IFNA expenses are those dollars spent to support the  Network
     as  a  whole.  The  data  phone bills for Ben and I are low since
     neither of us is the outbound host,  so all of our direct traffic
     is  FidoNet  network  support.  Our data expenses only run around
     $100-$125 per month,  on the other side of the  coin,  our  voice
     expenses  run  around  $400 per month (a lot of months it is even
     higher).  We would love to distribute that  cost,  unfortunately,
     when  people  call  either Ben or myself,  they want *US* to call
     them back.  Also,  it only takes 3 or 4 overseas phone  calls  to
     inflate  our  monthly phone bills.  After Henk Weaver,  Fido 2/0,
     took over  as  the  European  Coordinator,  those  calls  did  go
     considerably  down  and I would expect Brian Gatenby,  soon to be
     Fido 3/0,  to have a similar  impact  in  Australia.  That  still
     doesn't  stop  other countries to call me and expect me to return
     their calls too.  As Fido continues to spread overseas,  my phone
     bill  will be high as I have to talk to them at least a few times
     to get them organized and started.

     The  above  expenditures  do  *NOT*  include   rent,   secretary,
     salaries,  travel, lobbying, selling SEAdog(c) and Fido(c), phone
     costs for sending nodediffs or FidoNews, IFNA owned micros,  etc.
     I would suggest we get over the first hurdle and get organized as
     a  non  profit  tax  exempt  and then discuss other ways to spend
     money if we can solve the funding problems. Remember the original
     reason for going non profit and tax exempt was  to  seek  funding
     from  big  corporations who are already targeting us as a serious
     market such as AT&T Reach Out America(tm),  GTE  PC  Pursuit(tm),
     USRobotics Courier(tm),  etc.  I will start investigating what it
     Fidonews                     Page 5                   29 Sep 1986


     will cost to do some of the above and present the findings to the
     Bylaws Committee.  If anyone wants to help out here please let me
     know.  Even  if we agree that some of the above expenditures make
     sense we need more people to make them happen.

     The current rule regarding tax exempt status filing  states  that
     an  organization will not be treated as tax exempt for any period
     before the filings are make within 15 months from the end of  the
     month in which we were organized.  In our case,  that was the end
     of August.  However,  it is more difficult to obtain  tax  exempt
     status  the  longer you wait to apply.  We need to get our Bylaws
     done and decide which direction is  best  for  IFNA.  The  Bylaws
     Committee  being  Co-Chaired  by Bob Hartman and Steve Jordon are
     already hard at work coming up with a first draft.

     I would propose that  IFNA  should  reimburse  the  extraordinary
     costs  of  the Executive Director,  Technical Manager (the person
     who takes care of the nodelist), FidoNews Editor,  plus any other
     officers as defined by the Bylaws. Whomever fills these positions
     should  be  able to recover their costs (within budget) above any
     reasonable and  customary  costs  of  running  a  board.  If  the
     officers need to send their bills to an IFNA Treasurer who has an
     approved list to eliminate the paranoia,  then so be it.  I would
     also propose we refrain from  "second  tier"  funding,  ie;  Help
     Nodes,  Regional  Coordinators,  Network Hosts,  etc.  until IFNA
     covers it's initial organizational expenses.  We can  talk  about
     "second  tier" funding next year at the conference.  I also think
     that our Treasure should publish an annual  statement  that  goes
     into  FidoNews  and  I will do my utmost to cooperate in order to
     see that this gets done.

     I feel that the primary mission of IFNA is to sustain and improve
     FidoNet  on  an   International   level   through   technological
     coordination.  The  secondary  goals of IFNA are numerous and for
     the most part still under discussion in the IFNA conference.

     On a more personal note, I would like to express my thanks to all
     of you who have supported me during the past three years.  It has
     been  very gratifying to see the net grow and expand and have the
     international impact that it has had so far.  Granted,  maybe not
     EVERYTHING has been handled perfectly or to everyone's taste, but
     I  have  tried long and hard to work to make FidoNet exciting and
     up to date.  The fact that SEAdog(c) and all the other  wonderful
     utilities  have  joined forces with us makes us even stronger and
     have eventually greater impact both in the U.S. and worldwide.

     Please send any feedback or comments to Fido 1/2,  which  is  the
     new node number for IFNA.

     Luck Hurder
     Cape Cod Fido 101/105

     Cape Cod Fido is still offering the free Fidogram service!

          There are many  uses for Fidograms. Examples:
          1.   Sending greetings during holidays,  birthdays,  or just
               to renew old acquaintances.
          2.  Sending batches of messages to your club members who are
              scattered all over the country.
          3.  Making all your old cronies green around the edges by
              announcing your next month-long cruise to Timbuktu, or
              bragging about your recent engagement to Mr/Ms wonderful.
          4.  College students:  telling Ma how much you miss
              her apple pie.
          5.  Requesting health and welfare information on friends or
              family located (or not yet located!) in a disaster area.
     As with anything neat like this - some cautions are
     in order.

     Since FidoGrams are not sent over commercial circuits, but
     rather by FCC-controlled Amateur Radio Circuits, there are
     some constraints.  First, if you really want to make Fido curl
     up his lip, bare his teeth and growl, just try sending a free
     telegram that relates in any way to business, or the making of
     a profit by any party.  Fido will make kitty  litter out of any-
     thing that does not look like a personal, non-business message.
     Don't even attempt it.  Ditto for profanity, codes, or ciphers.
     Finally, user normal-conversation words.  Avoid difficult ones.

     How will your free telegrams be delivered?  After  being routed
     through the National radio Traffic System to the ultimate point
     of destinatiion, the telegram will  be telephoned - just like
     with the commercial boys.

     Here's what Fido needs in order to keep his telegram tail-a-
     -waggin.

     1.  Y-o-u-r name, address, and telephone number in case we need
     to get back with you, or in case there is a return message going
     your way.
     2.  The full name, adddress, and telephone number of the persons
     you wish to send telegrams to.
     3.  The message.
     4.  A signature.

     That's the grand total.

     Where can you send free FidoGrams?  To anyone in the USA or
     Canada who has a telephone.

     Is there a limit to the number of free FidoGrams  that you can
     send at any one time?  No. As a matter of fact, the Amateur
     Radio Operators use these telegrams as a way of exercising their
     emergency communications apparatus.  They welcome large loads
     of message traffic in order to practice for the times when emer-
     Fidonews                     Page 7                   29 Sep 1986


     emergencies demand strains on their system.  Go ahead - try to
     inundate them...

     If you wish to send FidoGrams, or if you have further questions
     send them to Luck Hurder at Cape Cod Fido 101/105.  Be absolute-
     ly sure to include your complete name, address and voice phone
     number so that we wont have to incur Fidomail expenses.

     We hope you'll use this service often, and that you'll  gain
     much enjoyment from it.

     Kilgore Trout, 107/7
     FidoNet Study Group

                     Country Level Support for FidoNet
                            A Proposed Approach


     Tom Jennings has declared  his  intention  of  providing  country
     level  support for FidoNet.  This is an excellent idea.  I have a
     proposal on one possible way to do it.


     International mail has thus far been handled in a very  different
     manner  than  domestic  mail.  I'll  use Europe and Massnet as an
     example,  even though they  don't  operate  this  way  any  more.
     Anyone  sending mail to Europe routed it to Dave Rene in Massnet,
     who  then  passed  it  via  DECnet  to  England,   where  it  was
     distributed.  This  was  implemented  in  multinet Fido by making
     England a part of the Massachusetts area. (The tail is definitely
     wagging the dog here!)

     Instead,  assume that the U.S.  is zone 1,  and Europe is zone 2.
     Dave  Rene  would then be designated as the "link" from zone 1 to
     zone 2.  An example of the node list might be:

         ZONE   1 United_States
         LINK   2 20 2400 Europe          1-617-632-1861 Gardner_MA
         LINK   3 22 1200 Indonesia       1-808-486-0407 Honolulu_HI
         HOST 100 22 2400 St_Louis_Area   1-314-432-4129 St_Louis_MO
              507 22 1200 Sky_King        1-618-462-3550 Alton_IL
              (rest of the U.S. nodes)
         ZONE   2 Europe
         LINK   1 20 2400 United_States   31-8380-37156 Ede_HOLLAND
         LINK   3 20 2400 Indonesia       31-8380-37156 Ede_HOLLAND
         HOST   1 20 2400 HCC_net_Holland 31-8380-37156 Ede_HOLLAND
                1 20 2400 Fido_Nl1        31-8380-37156 Ede_HOLLAND
              (rest of the European nodes)
         ZONE   3 Indonesia
         LINK   1 20 2400 United_States   62-21-79-3286 Jakarta_JAYA
         LINK   2 20 2400 Europe          62-21-79-3286 Jakarta_JAYA
         HOST 131 20 2400 Indonesia_Net   62-21-71-7406 Jakarta_JAYA
              369 20 1200 Aditya_BBS      62-23-1-6049  Cirebon_JAYA
              391 20 2400 Computeria      62-21-71-7406 Jakarta_JAYA
              (rest of the Indonesian nodes)


     The idea here is that if (for example) you want to send  mail  to
     someone  in  zone  3,  then  you  route  it instead to whoever is
     "link 3" in your own zone, and he takes care of getting it there.
     If there is no link designated,  then current  routing  practices
     take over.

     The  assumption  here  is that whoever is the link will have some
     other way of getting the mail there,  such as Dave Rene  used  to
     have  with  DECnet,  but  it  would  still  work with the current
     procedure of picking up mail.

     Henk Wevers, 500/1

                To IFNA or not to IFNA, that's the question

                      an European view by Henk Wevers.


     Courtesy Neal of 138/14 Europe is tied into the IFNA  conference.
     If  that  is a blessing has to be decided yet.  After reading all
     this barking and  other  emotional  stuff  I  suggest  we  change
     directions in this area and try to rationally find out:

     1) If we really need an IFNA

     2) If  we  are really serious about IFNA,  how to raise money for
        IFNA

     3) If we find ways to raise money, how to organize IFNA.

     4) If we get IFNA organized what else do we want from IFNA.

     If  we  start with point 1 and find us having a real NO somewhere
     along the line,  we can stop answering the next points,  so let's
     begin at the first one.


     Do we really need IFNA
     ----------------------

     Oh well, this is a really difficult question to answer,  because,
     except from food,  water and housing, do we really need anything?
     So the answer must be NO.  We don't need  a  computer,  we  don't
     need a net,  we don't need IFNA.  But still,  if we are running a
     BBS like Fido the real question is, makes IFNA things work better
     for us.  My personal answer here is YES,  but I figure  that  for
     others  the  answer will be no.  To make this clear for ourselves
     let's see where IFNA can help to make things work better for us.

     1. We  need some central point to give out the nodelist.  This is
        true if we all want to be in a  BIG  worldwide  net.  Probably
        without  a central point for the nodelist we will see a lot of
        small nets, some die, others are born again.  No international
        communications,  no  nationwide  communication.   Perhaps  YOU
        don't care, I do.

     2. We need some central point to give  out  a  newsletter.  Well,
        without  a  newsletter you have to find out all kind of things
        by yourself.  Could you really live without FidoNews?  If yes,
        I guess you can live without Fido.

     3. We  need some central point to control the netstandard.  Hmmm,
        I think without this kind of thing we will  end  up  like  the
        modem  situation  in Europe.  Don't you think the situation in
        the USA is much better?

     4. We  need  to  reach  the  point  of  critical  mass.   If   an
     Fidonews                     Page 11                  29 Sep 1986


        organization  reaches  a  certain  point  in  membership,  the
        numbers alone are enough to open a lot of doors.  With FidoNet
        we reached that point already,  but we  need  a  concentration
        point.  I  have seen this power used in FidoNews by publishing
        bad experiences with firms.  It can be used (wisely) for other
        things.

     5. We need long term stability.  If we want to be in  a  FidoNet,
        it better lasts long.  At the moment, if some people decide to
        stop  tomorrow  the net collapses a few days after that.  With
        an organization you can avoid that.

     6. We need something so we can be proud to be part of  it.  NO  I
        don't  mean  you.  I  know  this  is  not your reason to be in
        FidoNet, but why want people a net/nodenumber before they have
        their boards running and before they can mail, huh?

     7. Fill in your personal reasons here


     --> Every  single point is enough reason for me to want something
         like IFNA.

     --> How about you?


     How to raise money for IFNA
     ---------------------------

     First things  first,  at  the  conference  I  have  followed  the
     discussion  about  tax deduction for IFNA.  The discussions about
     this point took about 1 hour of our  limited  time  there.  At  a
     proposed $25 a year,  I am told tax deduction could be about $5 a
     year. Yeach...  most of the guys talking spend $60 a night in the
     Hilton and flew to Colorado....

     My  suggestion  is  the  following:  Charge  an  entry fee in the
     nodelist and an annual fee to stay in the  nodelist.  Divide  the
     money   between   the   people  doing  the  work:   the  regional
     coordinators, the nethosts, the zone coordinators and IFNA.  This
     must be independent from a membership of IFNA, it just should pay
     for  the  costs  involved  (hosts  and  coordinators  downloading
     FidoNews  and  the  nodelist  updates).  It  will also get rid of
     nodes not really up or serious about the mail part of Fido.

     Suggested fees:

     Entry:  $10
                $2 for IFNA
                $2 for zonecoordinator,
                $6 for host/region coordinator.

     Annual: $ 5
                $1 for IFNA
                $1 for zonecoordinator
                $3 for host/region coordinator
     Fidonews                     Page 12                  29 Sep 1986


     (Ok hosts,  calculate your costs in maintaining the nodelist,  eg
     uploading changes and downloading the diff files. you must have a
     better estimation.)

     Besides  that a membership fee of IFNA giving you some advantages
     (later) and the right to vote.  If you don't  want  to  vote  and
     don't  want  the advantages and still want to be part of FidoNet,
     fine.

     How to organize IFNA
     --------------------

     This is the crucial point.  I stands for international but so far
     all talking has been done for a (USA) national FNA (UFNA  ?)  For
     your information, long ago the Finnish FidoNet sysops have formed
     a  Finnish  FidoNet  organization  (just  to  share  the costs of
     hosting and getting the news and nodelist  updates).  I  think  a
     lot  of talking and thinking has to be done about this point.  If
     you make mistakes you  can  end  up  with  an  organization  busy
     talking  about  its  own  organization  instead  of servicing its
     members.  Points to be decided:

     - Who are members of IFNA, national FNA's, zones, regions,  nets,
       or people?

     - Who  can be assured that we have a democratic organization that
       can act fast enough?

     - Do we want a democratic  organization?  Aren't  we  better  off
       with a service bureau?

     - If we vote, how to organize that on this large scale?

     I  am  not  so  sure  we are ready for a democratic organization,
     maybe we are better off without it for a year or so. I gladly pay
     a little fee for being in the nodelist,  and if being a member of
     IFNA  makes  my  life better I will pay for that too.  No need to
     vote yet.

     What do we want from IFNA
     -------------------------

     Ok, here is my wish list.

     1. All points mentioned above

     2. Concentration  point  for FidoNet related software (this alone
        will be worth it,  ordering a disk from IFNA with  the  latest
        updates of Fido/SEAdog/Collie utilities)

     3. Some  day  in  the  future  I  hope  IFNA  will  run  hosts to
        concentrate  traffic  between  countries  (states).   Maybe  a
        satellite?

     4. Validation of FidoNet software

     5. Help for people writing FidoNet software

     6. ----
        (please fill in)


     One last point
     --------------

     FidoNet,  the  bigger the better?  Well,  that depends.  I rather
     have a small cooperating FidoNet community  than  a  big  FidoNet
     that in the end will fall apart due to lack of organization.  You
     too?  Tell us,  I haven't seen  any  comment  from  most  of  you
     there....

     =================================================================

                   CONVERTING PERFECT CALC FILES TO dBASE


     Like the discovery of America,  the atomic bomb,  and many others
     of our blessings, the main secret is disclosed once you know that
     it  can  be  done.  With  some helpful guidance from our resident
     dBase expert Edie Harris,  I can report that you can easily  take
     spreadsheet  data  from  Perfect  Calc files and enter it without
     retyping into a dBase file.

     I had always thought of dBase as a filer  program,  analogous  to
     Perfect  Filer,  and  having nothing to do with a spreadsheet and
     calculation program like Perfect Calc.  It  turns  out,  however,
     that  dBase  will  do simple arithmetic on its numeric entries as
     well as make logical selections that qualify it for much  of  the
     work of a spreadsheet.

     Perfect Calc will do some mathematical operations that dBase will
     not;  trigonometric and logarithmic functions, squares and roots,
     for example.  But my main application was  to  keep  my  checking
     account  in  order.  I  also  keep track of the categories of tax
     deductible expenses  evidenced  by  each  check.  For  this,  the
     ability to add, subtract, multiply, and divide was plenty.

     I've  always  like Perfect Calc.  It thinks the way I do.  I like
     the way you enter data, labels, and formulas;  I like the ability
     to  control  column widths and justification,  and the ability to
     enter information in one cell and then replicate it  in  a  whole
     region.

     But  Perfect  it  ain't.  there  is no way to locate a particular
     entry other then by visual  search.  Worse  than  that,  it  gets
     distinctly  buggy  when  you  try  to  enter  too  much  data  or
     (particularly) too many formulas.  You are led  to  believe  that
     you  can have up to seven buffers,  each containing a spreadsheet
     with 52 columns and 155 lines,  with  proliferation  of  formulas
     tying  then  all  together.  Just  try  it!   Long  before  those
     theoretical bounds are reached, your program will bomb out.

     Now take a look at dBase.  It has been expensive,  but many books
     have been written on it.  You'll never walk alone, and it may not
     be so expensive, since dBase III is now coming out.

     Once  my  data is transferred to dBase,  I will be able to locate
     any check with a simple search command,  and get a sum of any tax
     category with another.  If you have lots of important information
     in  Perfect  Calc  files,  knowing  that  this  can  be done will
     encourage you to get and learn dBase.

     Here's how to transfer the data:

     Call up the PC spreadsheet.  Make sure all numerical entries  are
     Fidonews                     Page 15                  29 Sep 1986


     justified  to the right and all labels to the left (these are the
     default settings,  so they will be unless you've  changed  them).
     Mark  the  region  of the spreadsheet which contains the data you
     want transferred,  by marking one corner of  the  region  with  a
     "Mark-set"  (ESC SPACE) and moving the cursor to the other.  This
     will ordinarily exclude the titles and text at the top,  and some
     calculations at the bottom.

     Then  write  it  to a text file by using the command CTRL-XP.  Do
     not hold the CTRL key down while you type  the  "P".  That  would
     act  on  the  entire  spreadsheet  instead of the region you have
     designated.  Do not type a carriage return (that would send it to
     the printer,  or lock up  the  program  if  you  don't  have  one
     connected and turned on).  Instead,  give a filename of a file to
     which it is to be 'printed', i.e.  saved as a text file.  You may
     give it any name you wish left of  the  period,  but  the  extent
     (filetype)  must be the letters "TXT".  Then after giving the new
     file its filename.TXT name, press the carriage return.

     It is probably a wise precaution to call this file up in  a  word
     processor  so  as to count the number of spaces that are actually
     in each column.  These spaces are critical to  the  process  that
     follows,  and may not correspond exactly to those in your Perfect
     Calc spreadsheet.

     Next,  enter dBase with the  command  "DBASE",  and  at  the  dot
     prompt,  "CREATE"  a  file  with  headings  and  columns  exactly
     corresponding to those of  your  Perfect  Calc  text  file.  Then
     APPEND  the  Perfect  Calc  data  with  the command:  APPEND FROM
     (filename).TXT SDF.

     Then examine the file with the DISPLAY, TEXT, or BROWSE commands.
     Despite your  precautions,  you  may  find  you  need  to  MODIFY
     STRUCTURE  of  the dBase file to change column widths,  and these
     will destroy the data you have  just  APPENDed.  But  the  APPEND
     process  is  so  easy  and fast that it isn't much work to repeat
     that part of it.

     There you have it;  a block of data that you are already familiar
     with  to manipulate,  sort,  index,  calculate sums of all or nay
     particular part.  It's a great way to get into a new program.

     Fido Bug Column
     David Dodell, Fido Bugs' West, 1/98
     Marvin Shelton, Fido Bugs' East, 1/99


     Before we start with the bug reports and Tom  Jenning's  replies,
     Chris Baker of 135/14 sent the following which may be of interest
     to other sysops.

     The 'bug' you describe (note: how to log in on one line with user
     i.d.  Sysop)  is  something  i was having problems understanding,
     till it hit me.  Try this next time:

                 Sysop | | Y Password <cr>.

     You've got to get past the Last  Name  prompt  so  it  takes  TWO
     pipelines to get to the Yes/password prompt.


     BUG
     ---

     The bug is that in the message sections,  the number indicated as
     the "last message read" is frequently actually the  first  unread
     message.  This  can  cause  a  user  to miss a message.  This bug
     seems to have persisted through quite a few Fido revisions.

     I think what the "Last Read" indicator OUGHT to do  is  start  at
     zero  when a new user logs in for the first time,  and thereafter
     stay at the number of the last message he has read.  Instead,  it
     seems  to  start at 1,  and thereafter it frequently advances one
     higher than it should be.

     Tom Jenning's Reply:
     --------------------

     The last message read is a mess;  it  will  re-read  the  highest
     message   if   you've  read  them  all  for  instance.   Fido  is
     inconsistent in its display of the number,  it displays last read
     + 1 in some cases.  It shouldn't cause a message to be missed;  I
     will look for that one.

     BUG:
     ----

     It seems that when users use the <C>hange feature to change their
     parameters,  the changes don't  always  seem  to  "stick"...  for
     example  a  user  set a screen width of 40 and a length of 8 (for
     one of those little portable computers with a  tiny  screen)  and
     that  seemed to get reset to 24 lines,  79 columns when he logged
     off.

     On the other hand,  other users have made various changes with no
     problem.  The  problem seems to occur when you change your screen
     length to something very small like the above example.

     Tom Jenning's Reply:
     --------------------

     Ahh ... I think I know what's up with the screen dimension thing.
     Fido lets you set it alright,  but when the  user  logs  on  next
     time,  Fido sanity checks things like screen width ...  the logon
     check obviously thinks  the  screen  dimensions  are  silly,  and
     resets to defaults.  This will not happen in v12.

     BUG:
     ----

     I'm  not  sure  if I remember the circumstances ...  use "1 x" to
     move to a nonexistant area (such as  9  if  the  highest  current
     system  file  is 7).  Fido will then show the contents of SYSTEM7
     but will say "Msg Area 9:".  Any access with "1" shows  7,  while
     the header shows 9.

     Tom Jenning's Reply:
     --------------------

     The  1 command:  Fido wont let you say "1 9" if the highest is 7;
     it will only let you say "1 8".  (Highest + 1).  Fido creates the
     new system.bbs file (in this case SYSTEM8.BBS) by duplicating the
     one  last accessed ...  you have to change the contents yourself.
     Not a bug.

     Jerry Hindle
     123/6
     Memphis,TN


          I have been using U.S. Robotics "Micro-Link 2400" internal modem
     now for about a year with the Fido I am running and have so far had
     excellent service from this unit. I will attempt to pass on my
     findings on this modem to those out there who may be considering a
     purchase from USR in the near future, and although this was written
     about the internal version I have others in this net using the
     "Courier" and other brands of 2400bps modems and from the reports I
     have been getting from them I will try to give you as complete a
     rundown of the various modems as I possibly can.

          I ordered the modem from USR and requested they send it UPS to
     my business address COD. They accomplished this feat with expertise
     far beyond anything I have seen before. I had the modem the 2nd day
     after talking to the sales people. Considering the service I get from
     UPS this in itself it a miracle. The modem comes packaged with
     terminal software and an extensive user manual. The terminal software
     also has its own user manual almost as big as the modems. I will
     touch briefly on the software.

          Like Hayes the USR software was designed to operate the Micro-
     Link and thus has some special commands strictly for this purpose. It
     will however do an admirable job of operating both the Hayes internal
     and external modems, the Leading Edge internal 1200 and 2400 modems
     and naturally the USR "courier" external 2400bps modem. It has an
     autoanswer feature allowing you to call your own system with password
     security and have access to your files via telephone. The "BEST"
     feature of this software is it's ability to write an autologon file
     (script) the first time you call a system. If you call a system and
     it is your first call you can elect to have the terminal capture the
     logon sequence "AS YOU TYPE", no more editing script files to
     "create" a script ! Let the program do it for you !

          The modem card is a full length card requiring a "FULL LENGTH"
     slot (sorry the Tandy slot is too short) and comes with instructions
     on setting the modem for any of the 4 com ports available. It has a
     small speaker built onto the board that allows you to "hear????"
     what's going on when you make a call. I find that this speaker is too
     small to hear easily over the roar of the hard drive in my machine
     unless I place it in high volume, which is too loud. I would suggest
     that they add a volume pot to the rear plate and do away with the
     software volume setting and have just either on during connect, on
     all the time, or off all the time.

          The telephone connections like all other modems come in thru the
     rear plate, but unlike other modems the are NOT labeled as to which
     is line and which is for the phone. They are also sideways and this
     makes it rather difficult to disconnect the modem by feel since the
     lock tab on the modular phone line is recessed into the rear panel of
     the computer when the modem is installed. I suggest they turn it 90
     degrees so as to put the tab either on the top or bottom of the
     connection hole, and LABEL the connections.
     Fidonews                     Page 20                  29 Sep 1986


          The modem has the dip switches on the back panel (getting
     crowded back there now) for setting the default parameters on the
     modem. These switches are easy to move with a small pointed tool such
     as a pencil and stay put once they are set. The toggle on them is
     hefty enough to prevent accidental switching and easy enough to do
     from the front of the computer by feel or with a mirror. Here again
     though the ON or OFF position is not labeled. Although the manual
     clearly shows the user where everything goes , is set, or where to
     move it, the labeling would help a great deal. The switches are
     labeled for their NUMBER though and you have to look in a mirror or
     have a good memory to be able to  remember if the numbering starts at
     the top or bottom of the plate.

          I had a modem filter on the line when I first installed the
     modem. This filter had been working very nicely with my Hayes modem
     but after installing the modem inside the computer I noticed that it
     would fail to connect on the first ring about 75 percent of the time.
     After repeated calls to USR tech support I still had the problem. I
     even went so far as to call the telephone company and have the lines
     checked to see if I was getting enough signal. I can't fault tech
     support because they did everything they could think of to help me
     and even offered to swap out to the external modem at no charge if I
     elected to do so. I understand they have since improved on their
     already excellent record in this department. I finally found the
     problem to be that the modem was not sensitive enough to detect the
     ring AFTER it passed thru the filter, and not have any SCHEMATICS
     (hint to USR) I could not find the trim pot to adjust the sensitivity
     to compensate for this. I have since removed the filter from the line
     and am running "bare". I hate to do this since lightening could do
     considerable damage to the system thru the phone line. I think I will
     call tech support and see if they can tell me where the trim pot for
     sensitivity is or at least provide me a SCHEMATIC. Block diagrams are
     nice but useless to me.

          Again I say the modem has operated flawlessly since the removal
     of the filter and I have had the filter checked out by the
     manufacturer and they say it is 100% operational. I also must applaud
     USR for their policy of rom updates. They updated my rom from version
     242 to 243 free and all I did was call them. I didn't even have to
     send the modem in. They sent the new chip out to me with instructions
     on how to change it out. All they requested was that I send the old
     chip back (for reprogramming I suppose) which is fair enough. After
     all they are the ONLY ones that do this, try getting Hayes to update
     the rom in your modem, they will but you better get the wallet ready
     and be prepared to do without the modem for a while.....

          I am thoroughly pleased with the support given me by the sales
     people and tech support (except for the lack of a schematic) and the
     documentation is well written (where this article isn't) and through.
     I feel that for the money there is no other modem comparable to the
     USR 2400. I acquired my modem thru their "sysop deal" and would
     suggest that as many of you as can qualify do the same. I mean they
     can't keep a good thing going forever. I intend to purchase the
     "courier" next for the "other computer"

     =================================================================
                                  WANTED
     =================================================================

     Daniel Tobias, Soft Fido, 19/216

                 WANTED:  IBM PC PROGRAMS FOR PUBLICATION!

     SOFTDISK, INC., the already-successful publisher of magazines on
     diskette for Apple II and Commodore 64 computers, will produce a
     monthly disk-based publication for the IBM PC.  The first issue
     of this publication, to be named BIG BLUE DISK, and which will be
     contained entirely on a floppy disk, will be shipped to thousands
     of retail outlets in October, including B. Dalton Booksellers and
     Waldenbooks.

                            - - OFF-BROADWAY - -
     If you have written a program for the IBM PC, please consider
     publishing it on BIG BLUE DISK; it's your chance to make some
     money, and get your name in print.  Programs of all categories
     are being accepted.

                            - - YOUR REWARD - -
     We will select the best programs submitted, and publish them on
     issues of BIG BLUE DISK.  If we choose to publish your program,
     we will pay you a minimum of $50, and possibly more-- as much as
     $500, depending on the nature and quality of the program.  This
     money is for the privilege of publishing your program.  You
     retain full rights to it.

                          - - HOW TO SUBMIT IT - -
     Submissions can be sent by FIDONET to node 19/216, or uploaded
     directly to our BBS at (318) 636-4402.  Alternatively, you can
     send them on a floppy disk to:  BIG BLUE DISK, PO BOX 30008,
     SHREVEPORT, LA 71130-0008.

     BIG BLUE DISK is a widely-distributed, carefully-prepared
     publication, so make sure your programs are well-tested and
     debugged, and include adequate instructions within the program.
     Include a note (on paper, in a text file, or in a message to the
     sysop of our BBS) describing what your program does, what files
     are necessary to run it, and what system configuration (hardware
     and software) is required.  Please include the source code to
     all compiled or assembled programs so we can make revisions if
     necessary.  If you have marketed your software as "shareware",
     please remove all requests for money or other advertisements
     from the version you submit for publication; alternatively you
     can contact us for information on other terms for such programs.

                           - - NOTE TO SYSOPS - -
     There is a finder's fee of 10% for you if you submit a program on
     behalf of one of your users and it is published.  Thus, you may
     wish to publicize BIG BLUE DISK and our search for programs.

     Note:  No  profit is made from the sale of the Public Domain
     software in this collection.  The price is applied  entirely

     inspecting,   cataloguing,  archiving  and  maintaining  the
     files. Obtaining this software yourself through the use of a
     computer with a modem using commercial  phone  access  would
     cost you much more than what we charge for the service...

     charges.  California residents add 6% tax.

     For each sale, $10 will go to the FidoNet Administrators.

     My  appologies  for  the  SNAFU  Friday.   A   minor   (but   NOT
     insignificant)  bug  in  a  change  I made to "improve" the build
     program caused it to produce NODELIST.269 with  a  bad  CRC.  The
     accompanying  "good" NODEDIFF was incapable of recreating the bad
     CRC, and the edit process kinda fell apart.

     The error was not discovered and corrected  in  time  to  prevent
     several copies of the bad stuff from getting out.

     If  your NODELIST.269 has the following CRC at the end of line 1:
     32001, you are the proud owner of a "corrupt" nodelist.  Actually
     it is eminently usable,  but will not be editable next  week.  It
     can be transformed with the following editing procedure:

     If you have a NODEDIFF.269 containing the CRC "32001", delete it.
     For  God's sake DO NOT DISTRIBUTE IT.  Either do not distribute a
     NODEDIFF this week,  or get a corrected  version  to  distribute.
     Incidently,  if  you  edited this nodediff to produce a nodelist,
     you do not have the latest version of EDITNL, XLATLIST or both!

                                                     Ben
