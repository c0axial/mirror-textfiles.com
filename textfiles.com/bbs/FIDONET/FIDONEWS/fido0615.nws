     Reflections on the Anarchist Principle
     by Paul Goodman

     "Anarchism  is  grounded  in  a rather definite proposition:   that
     valuable  behavior  occurs only by the free and direct response  of
     individuals  or voluntary groups to the conditions presented by the
     historical environment.    It  claims  that  in most human affairs,
     whether political, economic, military, religious, moral, pedagogic,
     or cultural, more harm  than  good  results from coercion, top-down
     direction,  central  authority,  bureaucracy, jails,  conscription,
     states,  pre-ordained  standardization,  excessive  planning,  etc.
     Anarchists  want  to  increase  intrinsic functioning and  diminish
     extrinsic power.  This is a social- psychological  hypothesis  with
     obvious political implications.

     "Depending  on  varying  historical conditions that present various
     threats to  the  anarchist  principle,  anarchists  have laid their
     emphasis in varying  places:    sometimes agrarian, sometimes free-
     city and guild-oriented;   sometimes technological, sometimes anti-
     technological;  sometimes Communist, sometimes  affirming property;
     sometimes individual, sometimes collective;  sometimes  speaking of
     Liberty as an almost absolute good, sometimes relying on custom and
     'nature'.   Nevertheless,  despite  these  differences,  anarchists
     seldom fail to  recognize  each other, and they do not consider the
     differences to be incompatibilities.    Consider  a  crucial modern
     problem,  violence.    Guerrilla  fighting  has  been  a  classical
     anarchist technique;  yet, especially where,  in modern conditions,
     *any*    violent    means   tends  to  reinforce  centralism    and
     authoritarianism,  anarchists  have  tended  to  see the beauty  of
     non-violence.

     "Now the anarchist principle is by and large true(1).  And far from
     being  'utopian' or a 'glorious failure', it has proved itself  and
     won  out  in many spectacular historical crises.  In the period  of
     mercantilism and patents  royal,  free  enterprise  by  joint stock
     companies were anarchist.   The  Jeffersonian  bill  of rights were
     anarchist.  Progressive education was  anarchist.   The free cities
     and corporate law in the feudal system were anarchist.  At present,
     the  civil rights movement in the United  States  has  been  almost
     classically  decentralist  and  anarchist.  And so forth,  down  to
     details like free access in public libraries.  Of  course, to later
     historians these things do not seem to be anarchist, but  in  their
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 2                   10 Apr 1989


     own  time  they  were  regarded  as such and often literally called
     such, with the usual dire threats of chaos.  But this relativity of
     the anarchist  principle  to the actual situation is of the essence
     of anarchism.   There  *cannot*  be  a  history of anarchism in the
     sense of establishing a  permanent state of things 'anarchist'.  It
     is  always  a continual coping  with  the  next  situation,  and  a
     vigilance to make sure that past  freedoms  are not lost and do not
     turn into the opposite, as free enterprise turned into wage-slavery
     and monopoly capitalism, or the independent judiciary turned into a
     monopoly  of  courts,  cops, and lawyers, or free education  turned
     into School Systems."



     Footnote(1)  "I,  and Other anarchists, would except certain states
     of temporary  emergency,  is we can be confident that the emergency
     is  *temporary*.   We  might  except  certain  simplistic  logistic
     arrangements,  like  ticketing  or    metric    standards  or  tax-
     collection, if we can be  confident  that  the  administration, the
     'secretariat', will not begin to run the show.  And we might except
     certain  'natural monopolies', like epidemic control, water-supply,
     etc."

                   Gateways to and from FidoNet <tm>
         Technical, Administrative, and Policy Considerations

     What is a Gateway to/from FidoNet?
     ---- -- - ------- ------- --------

     A gateway is a collection of software and procedures whereby net
     mail and/or echomail may be transferred between FidoNet and
     another computer communications network.  Gateways are
     bi-directional, as folk always want to reply to others' mail.

     Gateways exist now.

       o There are a number of software packages for gating between
         uucp-based systems and FidoNet, the most well-known being
         the UFGATE shareware package.  These packages gate both net
         mail and echomail, and are often used to provide FidoNet
         access to/from Internet via the uucp network.  These tend to
         go through much effort to make FidoNet look as much like
         Internet as possible.  About 25 uucp gateways are scattered
         around FidoNet.

       o Rhodes University has developed a complete system between a
         Cyber-based NOS network and FidoNet.  This system handles
         both net mail and echomail, and is also strongly based on
         the Internet standards, and almost views FidoNet as a
         transport mechanism to get to/from Internet.  It is used to
         gate a fairly localized cluster of mainframes to FidoNet at
         a single point, and has made special arrangements for
         further routing and forwarding of mail.

       o WWIVnet has developed gating software based on the ForDog
         package for the MS-DOS-based WWIV systems, and some other
         package for the Mac-based Tabby systems.  The MS-DOS system
         uses Binkley or another FidoNet mailer handles the protocol
         transfers to make the WWIV system look like a FidoNet system
         to other FidoNet nodes.  WWIVnet gates are said to be
         scattered around the US and Canada.

       o A number of FidoNet-based systems have been developed for
         various flavors of UN*X.  These vary from encapsulated Fido-
         worlds within UN*X (i.e not true gates at all), to FidoNet
         front ends for UN*X mail systems.

       o RBBS-net seems to have developed gateway software for the
         MS-DOS-based BBS network, but I do not know enough to
         characterize it.

     All of these gateway systems can and are being run in a safe and
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 4                   10 Apr 1989


     cooperative fashion, and are providing a nice cross-cultural
     exchange with benefits for both sides of the gates.

     At this time, there are also other nets which, because they are
     based on technology similar to FidoNet, are dumping mail onto
     and taking mail off of FidoNet willy nilly, with little thought
     to the technical, administrative, or social consequences. Often,
     this is done with good intentions, not realizing they are
     providing a disservice to both nets.


     What are the Characteristics of a Good Gateway?
     ---- --- --- --------------- -- - ---- --------

     Like good contracts, good gateways should be fair to both sides.
     There is the need to preserve both the technical and
     sociopolitical integrity of all parties to the transaction.

     Technically, both networks will have specifications and
     requirements for transfer protocols, message and echomail
     formats, control data files, etc. Beyond the borders of the
     gateway software, each universe should be completely and safely
     maintained.

       o Messages and echomail should completely conform in format
         and content to the technical specifications of each side of
         the gateway.

       o Addressing of messages and echomail should completely
         conform to that of the network in or through which the
         messages are traveling or resident at all times.

       o A normal user should be able to enter new messages destined
         for the other side of the gate and to reply to gated mail
         with relative ease.

       o If FidoNet uses a network A as an intermediate to get
         to/from a network B, or if network C uses FidoNet to get
         to/from network D, then the inter-net transitions should be
         auditable, but local customs and technalia of the
         intermediate network may not need always be enforced.
         Socially, the customs and fashions of each network should be
         maintained in that network.

       o There must be administrative liaison and control between the
         two networks so agreements may be made and enforced and
         disputes may be adjudicated.

       o If the networks being gated overlap geographically, then
         systems should not have to pay significant costs to move
         mail between the two networks when it is between two nodes
         that are in the same general locale.

       o Gating is not simple, technically or administratively.
         Unless each net anticipates significant use of the gateways,
         and the anticipated gain is seen as greater than the
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 5                   10 Apr 1989


         anticipated pain, then one side or the other may reasonably
         decline to do the necessary work.


     What Technical Standards Exist?
     ---- --------- --------- ------

     Before we develop new specifications, social protocols, and
     standards, we should see what exists already.

       o FidoNet Technical Standards exist already for the data
         formats and the communication protocols for net mail and
         echomail.  All conforming gateway systems mentioned above
         conform to these standards.  These are named FSC-nnnn, or
         more recently FTS-nnnn.

       o The SRI-NIC has published standards for message formats and
         communication protocols that are used between a significant
         number of networks that already gate to each other.  These
         are often referred to as the Internet standards and named
         RFCnnnn or IDEAnnnn.

       o The ISO and CCITT have standards for message formats and
         communication protocols which are used between a significant
         number of systems.  These are based on X.nnn specifications,
         eg. X.400.

     Other standards undoubtedly exist and should be investigated by
     anyone desiring to build a gateway system.

     The game of 'my standard is better than yours' has been played
     for decades with no conclusion other then demonstrating the
     stupidity of war.  What matters is that each net's standards are
     maintained within that net.


     What Administrative Standards Exist?
     ---- -------------- --------- ------

     Most networks have formed administrative procedures and
     guidelines which regulate if and how other networks may gate
     to/from them.

     The most notable exception is the uucp/Usenet which, having no
     formalized administrative rules for anything else, imposes none
     on gateways.  Before we recoil in horror, note that uucp/Usenet
     is three to four times the size of FidoNet, is over twice
     FidoNet's age, and has a significantly better signal- to-noise
     ratio.

     The SRI-NIC provides a procedure for registering Internet
     domains.  A domain is somewhat like what we are considering a
     network.  This Internet registration procedure ensures that the
     network has
       o administrative responsibility and control, and
       o at least two registered sites which provide address mapping
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 6                   10 Apr 1989


         for the network being gated.

     FidoNet is a registered domain of Internet.  Our domain is called
     fidonet.org.  The administrative responsibility is the FidoNet
     IC's.  The registered 'nameservers' are at lynx.cs.orst.edu and
     k9.cs.orst.edu, both at Oregon State University, though this is
     bending the two nameserver policy a bit.

     DECNET, ARPANET, ... all have applicable standards, but, as they
     are strictly limited to formal commercial relationships, they
     are of little interest here.


     What Administrative Policies are Needed by FidoNet?
     ---- -------------- -------- --- ------ -- --------

     What does FidoNet really need to state in terms of administrative
     requirements on a network wishing to gate to/from FidoNet?

     FidoNet needs a means of ensuring that a formal relationship
     exists which may be used to negotiate technical standards
     between the two nets, internet adjudication of disagreements
     both technical and social, and enforcement of decisions.
     Similarly, the other network will likely want such assurances as
     well.  Therefore an agreement should be reached stating:

       o who is administratively responsible,

       o who is technically responsible,

       o what technical and administrative documentation exists, and

       o both parties will abide by eachother's rules when in the
         other's house, and

       o how grievances are to be stated and adjudicated.

     In addition, it will be advisable for FidoNet to place some
     requirements on a network wishing to form official gateways.
     Some of these requirements and their motivations are:

       o If the other network geographically overlaps a significant
         portion of FidoNet, then the other net should be of
         sufficient size that gateways can likely be recruited in
         most areas where the nets overlap.  Thus, systems should not
         have to pay significant costs to move mail between two nets
         that happen to be in the same locale.

       o If the other network geographically overlaps a significant
         portion of FidoNet, then there should, at a minimum, be
         gateways in each FidoNet zone where they overlap.

       o If the other network geographically overlaps more than one
         zone of FidoNet, then that net should have its own gateways
         between the zones, and not use FidoNet to move the burden of
         interzone PTT costs.
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 7                   10 Apr 1989


       o If the other network geographically overlaps a significant
         number of the regions in a FidoNet zone, then there should,
         at a minimum, be gateways in each FidoNet region where they
         overlap.

       o If the other network is geographically localized, then
         special arrangements may be made whereby there traffic is
         gated to/from FidoNet at one or more places by special
         arrangement as if the other network were a FidoNet node or
         local network (in the intra-FidoNet sense) itself.

       o Gating of net mail, i.e. user-to-user messages, must be
         implemented and easily used.  Gating of Echomail is
         optional.

       o Mail must be bi-directional.  If someone in the other net
         can send mail to a node/user on FidoNet, then that FidoNet
         node/user must be able to reply.

       o If echomail is gated, then, unless special circumstances are
         recognized by the responsible administrators, it must be
         gated bi-directionally.

       o If a conference is moderated (in the Usenet sense, similar
         to Dutchie's Conference Mail's moderation or GroupMail) on
         one network, then it should be moderated on all other
         networks, or at least the gateway into the network where it
         is moderated should ensure that correct moderation is done
         by forwarding or whatever is appropriate.

     For inter-net gateway systems in the process of formation, it is
     assumed that some of the above requirements may be waived during
     a startup period at the discretion of the administrative bodies.

     Observe that if FidoNet were to try to take a shortcut which has
     been suggested and simply require Intetnet registration of
     gating networks, then, of the current networks gating to FidoNet
     correctly (see above), only the Rhodes system could conform
     technically. Eg. the uucp gating packages gate to uucp which has
     no administrative center and is not registered with Internet.
     To require Internet registration would further neither the goals
     of Internet, nets wishing to gate to FidoNet, nor FidoNet
     itself.


     What Technical Requirements should FidoNet Place on Gating Systems?
     ---- --------- ------------ ------ ------- ----- -- ------ --------

     Each network will have its own specifications for communication
     protocols, data formats, message conventions, addressing, etc.
     Though more generally used standards are to be preferred, what
     really matters is that each net be self- consistent and
     integritous and that gateway systems maintain that integrity.

     From the FidoNet perspective, the following attributes of a
     gateway system seem to be mandatory.
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 8                   10 Apr 1989


       o Conformance to FidoNet message format as specified in
         current FidoNet technical standards (eg. currently FSC-0001)
         must be maintained while messages are within FidoNet.

       o Information to assist message comprehension and processing
         by gateway systems and/or other networks may be contained
         within the message body, either hidden behind ^A lines or
         not.  If such information is needed, then conformance to
         current Internet standards (eg. currently RFC822) is
         recommended.

       o The FidoNet message header must contain valid FidoNet
         addresses at all times the message is on FidoNet.  Valid
         FidoNet addresses are addresses of specific FidoNet nodes in
         the current FidoNet nodelist.

       o The source and/or destination address in the other net
         should be embedded in the text body of the FidoNet message,
         either hidden behind ^A lines or not.  Conformance to
         current Internet standards is recommended where appropriate,
         but addressing conventions in the other net may preclude this.

       o A message must contain sufficient information that the
         originating system and user may be easily determined.

       o A FidoNet sysop and/or normal FidoNet BBS user should be
         able to enter messages destined for users in the other
         network and reply to gated mail using current FidoNet
         software.

       o If echomail is gated, then the echo messages should conform
         to all current FidoNet standards for echomail.  For example,
         currently an echomail message should:
         - have a correct tear line
         - have an origin line of the proper format with a FidoNet
           origin of the gating FidoNet node
         - have seenbys of only FidoNet nodes
         - have a path line that goes back at least to the gating node

       o If echomail is gated, then an echomail message must contain
         sufficient information that the system and user of origin
         may be trivially determined, whatever net may have
         originated it.

       o The origin of gated echomail should be determinable in a
         regular way sufficient that the gating software can provide
         easy construction of private net mail replies to echomail
         messages which would return to the echo messages's
         originator through the appropriate gateway, which may or may
         not be different than the gateway through which the echo
         message came. It is acknowledged that this may require hand
         editing on the part of the user composing the reply.

       o If echomail is gated, and the other net has no equivalent,
         it may use net mail and/or net mail mailing lists.  Messages
         coming into FidoNet from this type of net mail or mailing

         list should properly gate into the appropriate echomail
         conference, and replies should work correctly as well.


     Conclusion
     ----------

     It is hoped that, given a philosophy and guidelines such as those
     outlined in this paper, FidoNet will continue to expand its
     links to other networks to the benefit of FidoNet and networking
     in general.

     It is hoped that this paper will be of some help to those
     constructing gateways to/from FidoNet, and to the administrators
     of FidoNet and other nets who are considering gating to/from
     FidoNet.

                                    THE

                     Apple CP/M Bulletin Board System

                                *    *    *

     It seems that there have recently been quite a few queries in the
     net about Daisy, the Apple II BBS of which I am the author, so
     for all those interested here are some details about Daisy.


     Daisy who?
     ----------

     A couple of years ago I was talking to my friend Ken Lo about
     Bulletin Board Systems, and about how hard they were to write.
     This was not a surprising topic of conversation as we are both
     programmers, both BBS users and the conversation in question was
     via messages on one of the local RBBS.

     I thought that BBS were probably pretty hard to code, and were
     way beyond the capabilities of the Apple ][+ which was then my
     main computer (I've since moved up to a //e).

     Ken disagreed, he thought it wouldn't be that hard to produce a
     BBS.  So after some discussion we decided to attempt the
     development of what we referred to at the time as an "Apple
     Fido".

     We decided to use Apple CP/M and Turbo Pascal v2 for the
     development as these were the most advanced systems available to
     both of us.

     With Ken working on the low level serial card drivers, we found
     it necessary to drive the UART directly using memory mapped
     registers, and me on the high level code it wasn't long before
     the first Daisy was running.

     You can well believe that the first call I received using Daisy
     was quite a thrill for me.  Even if a major bug did mean that
     every character the user entered was displayed on a separate
     line.

     That, and many other bugs, were soon found and fixed - it wasn't
     long before the very first version of Daisy was released.

     Of course it was some time before anyone actually USED Daisy to
     run a regular BBS.  But the thrill of coding and debugging kept
     us happy as we quickly developed a whole range of features for
     the system.
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 11                  10 Apr 1989


     Though it started off as a deliberate backward engineering of
     Fido Daisy soon took on a life and character of its own.  Today
     Daisy includes many features seen in Fido, Opus and other BBS
     together with quite a few features all of its own.

     For Users
     ---------

     From the point of view of a remote user the overall look-and-feel
     is very much that of Opus or Fido.  Most of the commands they are
     already familiar with will work as they expect, and they can use
     the system just fine without ever learning anything about the
     Daisy specific features.

     This only applies to users though; Sysops will find Daisy rather
     different from what they may have seen before.  As I had never
     seen any BBS from the Sysop side when I started writing Daisy I
     had to design everything from scratch.

     For Sysops
     ----------

     The first level of Sysop control is through a point-and-press
     interface available all the time the system is waiting for
     callers. This gives options such as "Start local session", "Edit
     user list", "Event" and the "Terminal mode"; though not all are
     available while a remote user is on-line.

     During a session, be it from the local console or remotely via
     modem, an on-line Sysop menu gives high-level users access to
     another level of commands used to control message areas, message
     renumber, access privilege levels, multiple bulletins and similar
     things.

     At the most detailed level all basic configuration information,
     detailing which drives are to be used and so on, is controlled by
     a text file which can be created using any normal text editor.

     In fact all these configuration options are entirely optional, it
     is perfectly possible to run the BBS by just entering 'BBS' at
     the CP/M prompt and letting it run. The program automatically
     generates any files it really needs.


     Daisy Mailer
     ------------

     Of course if you write a program on the basis of it being an
     "Apple Fido" pretty soon people start expecting it to be able to
     do FidoNet mail.

     Well after quite a lot of prodding I finally got around to
     starting on a mailer for Daisy.  Working from the early Fidonet
     Technical Standards Committee documents I built up all the code I
     needed to automatically send message back and forth from Daisy to
     Fido and Opus systems.
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 12                  10 Apr 1989


     Now the Daisy Mailer is an optional extra which plugs into the
     BBS and does all the packing, calling, transferring and unpacking
     of messages.

     It handles type two mail packets, file attaches and routing
     perfectly.  Echomail support is built-in and in the most recent
     versions can receive ARCmail.

     As Daisy is fully NetMail aware mail calls can be accepted at any
     time, so it qualifies for the #CM: continuous mail flag if
     correctly configured.

     Ah, but...
     ----------

     Unfortunately there is one catch if you want to use Daisy for its
     FidoNet mail capability; the Mailer has not been tested by the
     FTSC and hence has not been 'validated' by them as being Net
     compatible.

     This means that officially a Daisy BBS cannot be assigned a node
     number in the nodelist.

     Of course this doesn't stop you from using it as a Point system,
     and I've used Daisy as a point without any problems, but if you
     want a regular node number you're out of luck.

     My early attempts to get the Mailer tested and validated were to
     no avail; not because it was tested and failed those tests, but
     rather because I could never get anyone to answer my messages
     requesting that it be tested.

     More recently, around the new year, I sent a full set of Daisy
     and the Mailer on floppies to an Apple user in the U.S. at the
     request of James Deibele who is apparently now responsible for
     'foreign' mailers.

     As the Apple user in question is not a CP/M user I don't expect
     she'll get anywhere very fast (how soon do you think you'd be
     able to get Opus running if you were not a MS-DOS user and didn't
     even have a DOS bootable disk?)

     So the Daisy Mailer may or may not be tested and validated Real
     Soon Now.

     Despite all that if you have a friendly NC, as I have, you can
     probably get yourself hooked into the network for Echomail and
     such.


     Requirements
     ------------

     To run Daisy you need the following:

        * An Apple ][ series computer or compatible
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 13                  10 Apr 1989


        * Z80 card and CP/M software
        * Super Serial Card or compatible serial communications
          device.
        * External 300/1200 or 2400 baud Hayes AT compatible modem.

        * Clock cards, either Time ][ or TimeMaster, are optional.

        * A  large  capacity  RAM  card configured  as  a  ramdisk  is
          recommended for running the BBS, it is considered  essential
          for running the Mailer.

        * You'll also want as MUCH on-line disk storage as possible;
          floppies are okay but three would be better than two.


     Copyright
     ---------
     Daisy and its associated documentation and utilities are not PD,
     they are the copyrighted property of the authors.

     Free use and  distribution is, however, permitted - and

     Dutchie Conference manager 2.91 released
     Henk Wevers
     2:500/1

     This week DCM, short for Dutchie Conference manager, has been
     released. DCM is a full replacement for the Confmail/PKARC
     combination and has optional many of the features of Groupmail
     without its drawbacks. DCM was the last program needed to
     complete the Dutchie software packet so no third party programs
     are needed for a complete mailer/editor/conferencemail setup.
     Although DCM is part of the Dutchie packet it can be used in
     cooperation with almost all other mailers available for FidoNet
     operation.


     Confmail replacement
     --------------------

     DCM replaces confmail completely and even has a powerfull build
     in archive program so you do not need programs like
     PKARC/PKXARC or ARC for your conference setup. One relatively
     small program replaces all. In addition to the known Confmail
     features DCM offers a lot more in about 85 Kb.

     o       Two control files
             Two control files tell DCM how to perform its tasks.
             As those files are already present in a Dutchie
             environment Dutchie users need no extra configuration
             files.

     o       Smart tossing/scanning
             DCM will toss/scan in one run. This means that fewer
             diskaccesses have to be made. As the complete Dutchie
             package uses standard dosscalls that are  a  bit
             slower than some of the tricks confmail 4.0 plays
             (but less risky) the overall speed is about the same
             as that of Confmail. If you have a lot of 'passthru'
             conferences, DCM wins.

     o       Smart Passthru conferences.
             If you pass some conferences without reading them DCM
             will never unpack the messages in those conferences
             into a local directory. You do not need a directory
             for these conferences. It speeds up the scan/toss
             process too.

     o       Smart zonehandling
             If you are processing echomail between zones DCM will
             help you out. All seen-bye lines will be stripped off
             except the important ones (your own and the other gates
             address). This zonehandling capability is standard in
             the dutchie package.

     o       Smart pointsupport
             DCM handles (like the rest of the Dutchie program)
             points transparantly. Just set it up and forget about
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 16                  10 Apr 1989


             them.

     o       smart scanlists.
             a typical scanlist looks like this:
             500/2 3 4h 5c 6 512/3 .1S .2 .3 1:105/42
             As you can see short notations are available, and
             points are indicated by a dot in front of their
             pointnumber. An 'H' attached to an address means that
             the attache file message to this node must have the HOLD
             flag, a 'C' means that it must have the crash flag. S
             means a 'split' conference and this one switches on
             Groupmail like features that will save you lots of
             diskspace and transmission time. We will discuss that
             later in this article.
             If a full zone address is available and the zone is
             another than your own zone DCM will act as a zonegate
             for this Conference.
             In addition to or in stead of this list of nodes you
             can tell DCM to find the nodes in an ascii file by
             placing a @filename.ext on this line. If you have
             standard distributions you can point to the same file
             from different conferences. The dutchie package has
             support programs to send canned messages or files
             to a distribution list so you can inform all nodes
             that get the conference with one simple command in a
             batchfile or on the commandline.

     o       smart flags
             The flagfield controls DCM Functions per conference.
             Among them are f.i.  R for renumber, K:<n> for
             killing messages older than n days and M:<n> for the
             maximum number of messages to keep in this Conference.
             Access to the conference is controlled by the L:<n> and
             S:<n> flags, who control Accesslevel and Accesskeys
             for the automated JOIN and DISJOIN functions that are
             build into DCM as an AREAFIX replacement.

     o       smart JOIN/DISJOIN build in functions
             DCM has build in JOIN and DISJOIN functions for
             unattended joining and disjoining a conference. These
             functions are easy to use yet versatile. They generate
             welcome messages and succesfull joining a conference
             (by means of dutchies service requests) will result in
             a working conference on the requesting node. All
             changes on both nodes involved are performed, including
             creation of directories, changes in the areas file,
             welcome messages and a 'rulesfile' created on the
             requesting node. For full appriciation of this function
             you will need Dutchies mailer program, but the function
             can easely be performed by other mailers in cooperation
             with a small program to be released in the near future.

     o       smart archiving
             DCM has build in archive and dearchive programs
             modelled after the PAK series. An environment variable
             controls the backward compatibility with older archive
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 17                  10 Apr 1989


             programs but if your echomail is exchanged with other
             systems using DCM you can switch to a better 'crunching'
             system.

     o       Smart duplicate and topology problem detection
             DCM will detect duplicate messages that arrive
             on your system and get rid of them before they
             hurt the network. DCM will also scan the PATH
             list at the end of each message. If there is a
             topology problem DCM will remove the message
             and inform you about the problem so you can take
             corrective measures.


     Groupmail functions

             DCM addresses the same drawbacks in current conference
             mail processing (pointed out by a lecture of the
             echomail coordinator last FidoCon) as Groupmail but
             has a totally different solution for these
             problems.
             Lets quickly review the problems that we all have
             with the current way of handling conference mail:
             o       there is a copy of each messages present
                     on your disk for every node you scan to.
             o       The number of seenbyes often exceeds the
                     contents of the message itself.
             Those designproblems in confmail lead to excessive
             disk use and unneeded connection time. Both translate
             in money unneccesarely spend on diskspave and phone
             costs.

             When the echomail topology is under control in a
             network you can switch to the split conference mode
             of DCM by merely adding an S at the end of the node
             in the scanlist. Other than Groupmail, you can switch
             to the new system on a per node base and you do not
             need to convert the whole conference. From this you
             can also see that switching back and forth between
             the new methode is very easy, just append or erase
             the trailing S.
             The best place to convert to the new format is on a
             BOSS node. He has tight control over the topology
             and will benefit most. When switched to the new
             methode almost all seenbyes are stripped off and
             there will be only one copy of the message on
             you disk. This works two ways, the messages are
             shorter and there are a lot less. An example:
             a Boss serving 20 points, who all have 5 conferences
             with ca 40 messages a day yield a total of 20 *
             40 = 800 (packed) messages a day.
             The new system only has 40 (packed) messages on your
             disk and they are about 50% shorter. Not bad and on
             hughe echomail processors this adds up.
             There is a small drawback to this approach, there is

             an attached file for every conference. On high speed
             half duplex modems this will reduce the overall through
             put. The Dutchie Mailer 2.91 will solve this problem
             in cooperation with DCM and send those small archives
             as one big archive, real time.
             In the next few months we will release a 'condense'
             program that will condense those files into weekly,
             monthly and yearly archives. Nodes wishing to get
             a backlog of the conference then can filerequest
             the old messages.

     ----
             I have not discussed all features of DCM, you should
             try it yourself. The program is copyrighted, but there
             is no fee charged. It will be released with a
             conversion program for an easy switch from confmail
             to DCM.



     Availability
     ------------

             We expect that the 2.91 release will reach the USA
             this or the next week, it will be put on the software d
             istribution backbone, so in a few days it will pop up
             everywhere in fidonet.

          (408) 293-7894

          The sysops  of the  Vietnam Veterans Valhalla bulletin board
     are both  Vietnam combat  veterans; I  served during the war as a
     Medical Field  Surgeon in  the U.S. Navy attached to an Emergency
     Field Evac  Hospital and  later a  long-range recon team near Dac
     To, and  spent more than my fair share of time in a VC/NVA prison
     camp across  the border  in Laos,  and Nancy  my wife,  who is  a
     veteran of a different sort having fought HER war *years* after I
     returned to  the   United States,   battling   the    problems  I
     brought   back   from   that   little country tucked thousands of
     miles away  in Southeast  Asia.    Nancy and I have, for the most
     part, conquered  all of  the  problems  of  that  traumatic  past
     through years of hard work!
          Many   of the  men and  women who  returned  from  that  war
     continue   to carry it's memories and nightmares with them today.
     Although most  Vietnam veterans  live a  successful, happy  life,
     there are  those whose every day is a bitter struggle to survive,
     trying to  find some  way to either escape the horrible memories,
     or to  come to  terms with  themselves so they and their families
     can begin to live a normal life!!
          We feel  it is  our responsibility  as caring and empathetic
     individuals    to  share  ourselves  with  those  Vietnam  combat
     veterans of  both kinds;  the  ex-military  soldier-at-arms,  and
     their wives,  friends, and lovers, with the hope that somehow the
     knowledge    and    understanding    we  gained  from  the  years
     encompassing our own struggle might be of some help to those who
     are still fighting their war!!!

               THE VIETNAM VETERANS' VALHALLA BULLETIN BOARD
                     IS DEDICATED TO VIETNAM VETERANS,
                      THEIR WIVES, FRIENDS, & LOVERS!

     And to the memory of the 58,000 men and women who never came home

          Our system  has been  successfully operating  for  nearly  3
     years now,  and received well over 37,000 calls!  We also founded
     and   coordinated    the    International    Vietnam    Veterans'
     EchoConference (IVVEC)  which  can  be  seen  on  more  than  200
     bulletin boards  across the United States, Canada, and Australia.
     Please contact  our system,  or one of the nodes listed below who
     carry our conference and join in.  You don't need to be a veteran
     of any  kind to  participate.   We welcome  you with open arms to
     learn who we are and what we are all about!
          Nancy and  I are  looking forward to meeting you all, as are
     the Sysops of the nearly 200 VETNet BBs systems below:

     The Veterinarian's Corner
     Excerpts from the ANIMED GroupMail Conference

     by Don Thomson, 1:102/1005

        A brief schedule of vaccinations that should be kept up:

     Parvo - depending upon area and amount of travel and exposure to
     other dogs this should be a yearly to twice yearly booster.
     Parvovirus causes a severe bloody diarrhea with vomitting, and
     may be life threatening. The virus is extremely hardy, and normal
     disinfectants will not kill it.  The Simi Valley-Moorpark area
     has a relatively high environmental content of contagious virus.

     DHLP - Distemper, Hepatitis, Leptospirosis, and ParaInfluenza
     This vaccine is commonly combined with the Parvo vaccine into
     what is commonly known as the "6 in 1" vaccine.  These should be
     boostered yearly.  Canine Distemper is a multisystemic virus,
     that may initially appear as a simple 'cold' but later spread
     into the central nervous system and cause seizures, muscle
     tremors and even death.  We still see cases of distemper,
     thankfully limited to unvaccinated animals.

     Rabies - Depending upon which vaccine is used, this must be
     boostered every one to three years.  This is the ONLY vaccination
     that actually is required by state law.  Rabies incidence in the
     Ventura County area has been limited to rabid bats, primarily in
     the Camarrillo area and the Ojai foothills.  It is serious, and
     uniformly fatal.

     An echo tragedy by Rogers Cadenhead
     Alpha BBS (393/1)

     It was another beautiful day on the network, the kind of day
     where you could almost smell the ASCII wafting through the
     nation's fiber-optic phone lines.  In houses and apartments
     and computer labs and offices across the nation, fingers
     contentedly tapped on keyboards under the green or blue or
     multi-colored hue of computer screens, entering words and
     sentences and paragraphs that would echo across the nation
     and even farther through a patchwork chain of bulletin board
     systems.  Call it fate, call it karma, or just call it the
     genius work of some system operators: the discussion echoes
     had united thousands of computer users across continents
     without costing most of them a single penny.  It was a
     beautiful setup, made possible by a few philanthropist
     sysops who were crazy, rich or both.  By April 1989 it was
     coming into adulthood as a diverse, widespread network with
     infinite possibilities.

     But then disaster struck, spreading through the chain like
     an immunodeficient power surge.  You might say it started on
     a small QuickBBS system in Galliplis Fry, West Virginia, on
     an echo devoted to farm implements.  The main discussion
     thread on that April week was about modern developments in
     the spade:

     next in a message sent from a Pekin, Illinois, TBBS:

     Subj: POPULISM

     After all the troubles with farms and drought these past few
     years, and the efforts of Jesse Jackson and other
     politicians to draw needed attention to the plight of rural
     America, I wanted to talk about populism.

     Populism -- a sort of anti-establishment, grass-roots, buy
     butter, not guns political philosophy -- was widespread in
     the early 20th century.  People like Theodore Roosevelt and
     others led the fight for common people's rights and fairness
     for the underprivileged as well as the privileged.

     Populism has all but died as a political ideology in
     America, but Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower
     and others want to bring it back.  The positive side of
     populism is people like Hightower, fair-minded politicians
     who care about the farmer and want to make sure that we
     don't lose him.  But the negative side is David Duke, a
     former KKK leader whose populist message won him a seat in
     the Louisiana state Legislature.

     What I want to know is, will populism be coming back in
     America, or is it dead as a political force?  Do any of you
     discussing farm tools consider yourselves as populists, or
     admire politicians that do?

     As you can probably expect, the reaction to Pumblechook's
     message was both swift and immense in its ferocity.
     ToolNET, as moderator Jediah Hereford said time and time
     again in messages, was devoted to the discussion of farm
     tools.  This message had nothing at all to do with farm
     tools!

     Since this echo is devoted to a rural subject, I thought a
     discussion about rural politics would be appropriate, so I
     brought up populism.  If you're interested in farm tools, it
     only stands to reason that you must be interested in farms.
     If you are interested in farms, you must be interested in
     farm survival.  If you are interested in that, you must be
     interested in populism, don't you think?

     If the people on ToolNET want to talk about this, who are
     you few to say that they can't?  Why are there so many

     restrictions on what can be discussed here? There are only
     so many things you can say about farm tools, after all, and
     you won't be interested in farm tools if you lose all your
     farms, now will you?

     As you can probably imagine, this reply generated enough
     message threads to sew a quilt.  Message writers discussed
     Morris Pumblechook's lack of intelligence, his "hoity-toity
     attitude that belongs with them New York yuppie cream
     puffs," his lack of masculinity and his dubious ancestry.
     He had committed the mortal sin on an echo: deviating from
     the topic.  That made him, as one person said, a deviant.

     People are paying good money to send these messages all over
     God's green screens, and you are taking away from valuable
     discussions about the real topic: farm tools.  I don't know

     are on this network, I sure hope fer yer sake that they

     I've given up any hope of actually discussing populism here,
     but I'd like to propose a revolutionary idea for all of you
     on ToolNET.  If you don't care for a message topic that
     comes up here, why don't you just skip it?  That way, if
     most people don't care for it, the topic will scroll off.
     When you reply to a topic you don't like by saying you don't
     like it, what are you contributing to the echo?  Instead of
     "protecting" it by keeping the subject on the "real" topic,
     you're taking even more space away from discussions.  If

     you're really so upset about off-topic messages that cost
     money to send all around, why are you writing some of your
     own?

     These echoes give us all a chance to expand our knowledge
     and communicate with a broad range of people.  They are an
     ideal place for exposure to new ideas, but instead of
     allowing that to happen, many of you are too busy policing
     what should be said to actually say anything.  You'd rather
     criticize a topic because it might not belong than
     contribute one of your own.   In the beginning, God created
     one echo.  The discussions were able to go forth and
     multiply, and all was good with the world.  When discussions
     became really popular, they separated from the first echo,
     and more echos were born. And all was good with the world.
     At some point, someone -- perhaps Sevil Natas -- said that
     enough is enough.  No more off-topic messages.  As it was
     telecommunicated.  As it was done.  And now, echoes are
     dominated by teletyrants -- topicops -- who are armed with
     modems and ready to shoot to kill any topic that might not
     belong.

     And now, I am an outlaw.  I roam the ASCII prairie from
     coast to coast, and I will post my messages wherever the
     discussion takes me, even if it's off-limits on the echo
     where I ride.

     See you later, officers.

     This was the last straw for the upstanding members of the
     ToolNET echo. "This terminal ain't big enough for the both
     of us," they threatened, but Morris Pumblechook had escaped
     their clutches.  There were no messages on the echo for a
     few days, not even any about tools, because most people got
     so riled about Morris that they forgot what they were
     talking about.

     The next message posted came from echo moderator Jediah
     Hereford:

     Msg#:10090 *ToolNET Echo*
     04-17-89 15:05:13
     From: THE MODERATOR
       To: ALL ECHO CONTRIBUTERS
     Subj: MORRIS PUMBLECHOOK

     A virus has walked among us, a virus that endangers not your
     hard disk but the very existence of echoes.  Morris
     Pumblechook tried to subvert the designated topic of this
     echo, and he will try to do so again to other innocent
     echoes with users who might not be as vigilant as we were.

     Thanks to the good work of many of you, Morris was not able
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 33                  10 Apr 1989


     to lead us from the path of righteousness into the damnation
     of inappropriate debate.  For that I thank you.

     But he is still out there calling bulletin boards and trying
     the same tricks on other echoes.  They might not be so
     lucky.

     Because of that, I ask you to disguise yourselves and travel
     among the other echoes, ready to do battle with the infidel
     wherever he may appear.  When an off-topic message occurs,
     even if under another name that could be Morris using an
     alias, let him know that we're ready for him.  Let him know
     that we won't let it happen.  Let him know that he can't
     change the subject, no matter what subject.

     Please do this -- if not for me, for the future of echoes
     everywhere.

     May the baud be with you,
     Jed

     As The Moderator had asked, many members of ToolNET started
     calling other bulletin boards throughout the United States
     and many other countries.  They logged on under many
     different names and waited for Morris Pumblechook to appear.

     He did appear, under every name from Abramowitz to Ziegfeld,
     posting messages about Advanced Dungeons & Dragons on the
     Science Fiction and Fandom echo, posting messages about Star
     Trek's first series on the Star Trek: Next Generation echo,
     posting messages about classic radio on the TV echo, and
     even posting messages about the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
     political career on the Blacks in Religion echo.

     When he did, the members of ToolNET attacked him in a flurry
     of ASCII jihad. They wrote that his topic didn't belong on
     the echo, that it should be on other echoes, and that he
     should be smart enough to know that.  They threatened to
     leave the echo and said sysops wouldn't pay to transmit it
     anymore if he didn't stop posting.

     It is late 1990, and the war still continues.  Many of the
     echoes have lost a lot of member systems, and some have even
     died.  All the promise that the echoes offered for
     communication, discussion and friendly chatter has been
     usurped by topic protection.  Some moderators have changed
     their network software so they can screen all messages
     before distribution, and they delete irrelevant passages and
     sometimes entire messages.

     The beautiful days when screens were bright and message
     writers were brighter have passed us by.  Even the ASCII,
     which once smelled as fresh as free startup time on
     FidoNews 6-15                Page 34                  10 Apr 1989


     CompuServe, has started to harden and clog the fiber-optic
     trunks of the phone systems.

     Morris Pumblechook has not been caught yet, but there are
     hundreds who hunt him.  On some desolate bulletin boards
     where the echoes have no messages or the sysop has stopped
     getting echoes, Morris posts a sad prairie song:

              Oh, give me an echo, where the topics can roam,
              And the callers and lurkers can play,
              Where seldom is heard
              A censoring word
              And the talk is not stifled all day.

              And the talk
              Is not stifled
              All day.

     Nominations and Elections Committee
     1:107/233


       Request for Nominations for IFNA Directors for 1989 Election


     The election to be held this summer will provide for replacement
     of the following IFNA Director positions:


      Division    Incumbent         At-large     Incumbent

         11     Bill Allbritten        --      Ted Polczyinski
         13     Irene Henderson        --      Kris Veitch
         15     Scott Miller           --      Mort Sternheim
         17     Neal Curtin            --      Mark Grennan
         19     David Drexler          --      Matt Whelan
          3      (vacant)              --       (vacant)


                          Rules for Nominations


     In order to nominate someone for a Director position you must be
     a member of IFNA in good-standing at the time you make the
     endorsement.  You must affix your signature and the date to a
     document proposing one or more candidates for one or more
     Director positions.  Nominees need not necessarily be IFNA
     members.

     You may nominate as many at-large candidates as you wish.
     Individual nomination documents may be signed by more than one
     IFNA member, thereby providing multiple nominations for all
     nominees listed on the form (in fact, this is encouraged).
     Nomination documents are to be mailed and received by the IFNA
     Secretary by May 24 1989 at:

       Linda Grennan 147/1
       6204 Reeves Court
       Oklahoma City, OK 73122

     All nominations not reaching the Secretary by May 24 are subject
     to rejection.  Confirmation via netmail is advised.

     Only those individuals who receive 10 valid nominations, who
     qualify under all other regulations, and who accept the
     noimination will appear on the ballot.

     A sample nomination form follows the Election Rules.

                   (end of Nomination Rules for 1989)


                    1989 Election Rules (Preliminary)


     1.  WHO MAY VOTE FOR WHAT?

     Anyone who is a regular member of IFNA in good-standing as of
     the specified cut-off date (to be determined) may vote for:

      o  1 Divisional candidate for the Division in which you reside.
      o  6 At-large Directors.
      o  All proposed Bylaws Amendments.

     If there is no one being elected for your Division, you do not
     vote for any Divisional Candidate.

     Anyone who is an at-large member of IFNA as of the specified
     cut-off date may vote for:

      o 6 At-large Directors.


     2.  HOW DO YOU VOTE?

     FOR YOUR DIVISIONAL DIRECTOR: If there is no one listed for your
     Division, then this section does not apply to you and should be
     skipped.  If there is only one candidate listed, that candidate
     has already been elected and you should skip this section.  To
     vote for one of two or more candidates IN YOUR OWN DIVISION ONLY,
     mark an X next to the name of your choice.  Note that votes for
     non-elected Divisional Director candidates will automatically be
     applied to those candidates in the At-large category.

     FOR AT-LARGE DIRECTORS:  Place an X next to the name of 6 or less
     At-large Director Candidates.  If you voted for a particular
     candidate to be your Divisional Director, DO NOT ALSO VOTE FOR
     THAT CANDIDATE AS AN AT-LARGE DIRECTOR as it can invalidate your
     vote for At-large directors.

     FOR BYLAWS AMENDMENTS:  For each proposed amendment you may place
     an X in either the YEA or NAY area, according to your choice.
     You need not cast a vote for any particular amendment if you so
     desire; in this event your vote will be considered an ABSTAIN.


     3. FROM WHERE DO YOU GET A BALLOT?

     Regular and at-large members of IFNA as of the specified cut-off
     date should receive a ballot in the mail.  Also, ballot
     information will be published in FIDONEWS and will be available
     for request from the nodes listed below.  It does not matter from
     which source you acquire your ballot, but it is your
     responsibility to get a ballot and return it to an official
     receiver by the due date.

      NODES WITH BALLOTS AVAILABLE AS "ELECT89.ARC"

        1:107/210   (others to be determined)


     4.  WHERE MUST YOUR BALLOT BE RETURNED BY WHEN?

     The official due date and site for the return of all ballots
     shall be stated in the official ballots that are mailed out or
     that appear in FidoNews.  It is expected that additional sites
     for return will be provided in Europe and Australia and that
     ballots returned to those sites by the cut-off dates will be
     considered as officially delivered.
