                         Bob Moravsik 1:269/107

     I want to start out by encouraging all the voters to  vote  NO
     in the IFNA non-binding referendum. Why ?  Why  give  DEATHNET
     any encouragement? In FIDONEWS 6-45 the "proposed" BYLAWS  and
     "policies" were first shown. While reading them  I  noticed  a
     loud noise every few pages similar to the noise  we  all  hear
     when we watch "Current Events". I thought I'd share my "gongs"
     with you.

     Where and when will meetings be  held  ?

     GONG!

     Wherever  and whenever the BOD wants them!

     Who votes?

     GONG!

     The holders of these three year  proxies,  whoever  they  are,
     they reappear in Article III Section 4 as the  "holders  of  a
     majority of all membership votes" !!!!!


     Is the membership list available ?

     GONG!

     Only for 10 days before the meeting, then tough!

     Can members call special meeting ?

     GONG!

     Yes, but it takes 10%, Missouri Law lets this  go  to  as  low
     as 50

     Are voting results published ?

     GONG!

     Nope, they still stay hidden!  This  is  one  of  the  biggest
     problems with the DEATHNET group. SECRECY!

     FidoNews 6-46                Page 2                   13 Nov 1989


     Do you get notice of meetings?

     GONG!

     Yep, as short as ten days,  then  the  "vote  holder"  of  the
     proxies, swoops in and declares a "mandate". Beginning to  see
     a pattern, HUH !!!!!

     Why six directors ?

     GONG!

     Suspect the CHAIRPERSON will vote and he/she doesn't  have  to
     even be a member !!!. More patterns, HUH !!!


     Article III Section 4..

     Who is the "holder of a  majority  of  all  membership  votes"?

     GONG!

     Let's refer to them as THE  DICTATOR.  And  you  thought  this
     was DEMOCRATIC ?????


     Ya learned huh ! OK How many Directors are there?

     GONG!

     As many as the BOD wants (Section III.5.) Fooled ya!


     Must the CHAIRPERSON be a member?

     GONG!

     Nope, note the existing Chair is not even a SYSOP!

     Did YOU elect this CHAIRPERSON ?

     GONG!

     Nope.

     Is there an "Independent Judiciary" ?

     GONG!

     Nope. The independant judiciary is hiding right  next  to  the
     FIDOCON 89 vote counts !!!

     FidoNews 6-46                Page 3                   13 Nov 1989


     Are the BYLAWS for real ?

     GONG!

     Nope, Read Article XI, they can  be  changed  at  will  !!!!!.
     FOOLED YA, HUH? It's like reading instructions then  the  last
     instructions says "ignore what you just read !!!!"


     What's a "Local organization", Article XII sec 1?

     GONG!

     Whatever it is, you can be sure  it  will  conflict  with  the
     national organization. At last we found the ray of revolution.
     DEATHNET is a "local organization" and we see what it can  do.
     Is this the "seed" for an Zone x  organization  ?????.  Wonder
     how this NEW provision is related to the  YPOP  proposal  GONG
     GONG on this!


     POLICY 5

     Now the policy...well what is this "Supplement" ?

     GONG!

     It's the way that DEATHNET can keep the nodes  in  line.  Real
     DEMOCRATIC !!!

     Does a node have to adhere to policy?

     GONG!

     Nope, except for the techie stuff, see Art IV  they  must  know
     their A B C's.


     Is it POLICY 3 or POLICY 4 ?

     GONG!  GONG!  GONG!
     Note Section VI, paragraph 2. if  policy  5  is  not  ratified
     then it is not in effect BUT it "somehow" rises from the ashes
     and raises back Policy  3  ????,  3  guesses  who  likes  this
     provision!!! As to being related to reality !!!

     SUMMARY

     These  documents   are   about   as   DEMOCRATIC   as   CUBA's
     Constitution. ALL THE POWER is in the hands of the BOD. BYLAWS
     once passed should not  be  easy  to  change.  Proxies  should
     expire after the meeting they were given for. Meetings  of  an
     International Organization  should  have  more  then  10  days
     notice. Policies on a local level should NEVER  conflict  with
     International Policies. AND ABOVE ALL, THIS  ENTIRE  PROCEDURE
     SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A MASK TO REINSTATE POLICY 3.

     And for the REAL kicker,  don't  you  find  it  TRULY  AMAZING
     that the Chairman of the  International  Fidonet  Association,
     the organization that wants to rewrite and establish the RULES
     and REGULATIONS for Fidonet, IS NOT A MEMBER OF  FIDONET.  Try
     playing the latest craze in Parlor Games, "Find  Henderson  in
     the Nodelist"! It's like Gorbachev saying he wants to rewrite
     the US Constitution.

     I STRONGLY urge you to  vote  NO  and  keep  the  status  quo.
     Reject the recent BYLAW changes and write them off as the work
     of ARROGANTS who must be shown that the  SYSOPS  will  not  be
     fooled by this stuff.

     You have a node number, a set of rules, and a worldwide network
     to belong to. It works. Don't be fooled into "fixing" it. Let's
     work on changing Policy 4, or implementing a new policy. Let's
     have what happens to Fidonet be the result of the PEOPLE in it,
     not the doings on an mis- directed group that thrives on power
     and control.

     Sure, IFNA can revolutionize Fidonet. But remember, Castro
     revolutionized Cuba. And now they can't get rid of him.

                     HIGH_ED Echo Conference (Update)

     Now available from your NEC/REC by way of the "Backbone."

     The HIGH_ED  conference  is  proving  to  be  one  of the fastest
     growing new echo's  in the country.  As such, it is now available
     on the "backbone." Alternate  routes  are available for those who
     are unable to get the echo through their NEC due to compatibility
     problems  (specifically  Mac  systems  who  are   having  trouble
     communicating with some of the non-Mac systems).

     ***********************************
     HIGH_ED Echo Conference
     ***********************************

     This echo is being developed for the primary purpose of providing
     Students,  Staff  and  Faculty of "Higher Educational" facilities
     across the nation a forum for the discussion of  subjects related
     to Higher Education.

     Although  the  intent  of  this echo is to service the  needs  of
     Students, Staff  and  Faculty, everyone is welcome to participate
     in or initiate  discussions  related  to  Higher  Education.  For
     example, a person might wish to ask a question about a particular
     institution that he/she is thinking  about  enrolling  at  in the
     future.  The subject matter is  wide open so it will be up to the
     participants to keep the ball rolling on this echo.

     The only restrictions that presently apply to  the  use  of  this
     echo are:  The language used must be  clean  and  the discussions
     legal.

     FOR THE RECORD:

     The  "HIGH_ED" Conference echo is presently being carried by  the
     following nodes:
