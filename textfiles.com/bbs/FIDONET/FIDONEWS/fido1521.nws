     =================================================================


     Important information from Zone 2...it is much appreciated to see
     that there are those who understand the purposes of the FidoNews.

     For those of you making international connections to Zone 2, or to
     Italy in particular, the two articles should be of interest to you.

     Likewise, the introduction of the inter-Zone IP link via BinkP/ARGUS
     is welcome news for the future of FidoNet's development.

     If any.

     The doomsayers are out in force once more, claiming that FidoNet is
     soon to die, and without realizing what it is that FidoNet offers to
     the world of the InterNet.

     Jim Cannell, SecureMail international coordinator, and I were
     discussing the fact that, like routed netmail or echomail, there is
     no real "direct link" between one Internet node and another...all of
     the packets are routed, and accessible to intervention.

     What we had discussed was a way to generate encrypted packets over
     the InterNet which securely linked mail from one IP node to another,
     so that the only way to intercept mail would be to delete it.

     This would all but eliminate packet-ramming; it would enhance the
     ability of a moderator to be sure that order could be maintained in a
     highly volatile echo...moreover, it could even be used to bring
     echomail to the functionality of a UseNet newsgroup while also
     insuring only that FidoNet-sourced nodes could feed to it.

     After all, the two largest objections to bringing Fido to the level
     of the InterNet is lack of moderation and the likely appearance of
     'spamming' or pornography offers...encrypting the packets, as well as
     password-protecting connections through BinkP and ARGUS connections,
     would bring these down to the level where if it did happen, it would
     be a simple matter to locate the exact source of the mail and have
     it stopped, since it would be a FidoNet node making the connection.

     An idea to consider, no?

     Region33 (Italy): change of all phone numbers
     by Paolo Faustini, 2:33/0 (hbetty@fidoitalia.net, hbetty@tin.it)

     Starting from 19 june 1998, Telecom Italia, our national phone
     company, will change all the italian phone numbers, to get space for
     additional number sets destinated to mobile and other private phone
     companies.

     So, from that date, phone calls originated outside Italy to Italian
     phones, must have a "0" between region and local prefix.

     An example, based on my node phone number: *before* 19 june, you
     must compose "0039-2-89150967" to call my node, *after* 19 june,
     you will compose "0039-02-89150967".

     As my RC33 charge, I started the nodelist segment conversion
     process, with deadline for 17 june, so the nodediff generated
     for 19 june will have new phone numbers for R33.

     Conversion process and nodelist updates are transparent for Fido
     Sysops of other Regions and Zones, they will not do anything but
     applying nodediff as usual.

     But, there is always something that goes wrong, in nodelist
     conversion or, <eg> more probabile, Telecom Italia updating process
     (Italy counts about 25 millions of POTS and 10 million of mobile
     phone), so, *please*: if you cannot be able to contact italian Fido
     nodes after 19 june, send me an e-mail, with your name, your Fido
     address, Fido address and phone number of node you don't connect
     with, and symptoms you have noticed during connect (e.g. voice
     message to warn callers).

     Thank you in advance.

     Paolo Faustini, Region Coordinator 33.

     Netmail routing in Zone 2
     by Albert Ulmer, 2:318/11 (ws35.cable.vol.at)

     Hi there,

     I'm a node in Austria and I'm using Argus/IP as a mailer. In the past
     few months, I have made connections with other nodes using IP-mailers.
     FIDONEWS 15-21               Page 3                   25 May 1998


     Realizing the potential of Fidonet-via-Internet technology, I have
     decided to offer the following to nodes interested:

     You can route netmails for the regions 20, 21, 22, 23, 33, 47, 49, 50
     and 51 in Zone 2 as well as netmails for Zones 5 and 6 through my
     system for fast delivery. This is done free of charge, of course.

     I'm also looking for other IP-nodes who would like to participate and
     set up a link for bidirectional routing, especially in Zone 1,
     France, Great Britain and Spain.

     All the best,
     Albert.

     =================================================================


     Dear Editorbeing,

     This article is submitted by Doc Logger(163/110) who was
     recently plagued by an unusual number of low flying bats.
     Mercifully, the good editors at Swamp Swine Magazine
     provided suitable ingestibles to ease the condition long
     enough for this missive to be carved into the husks of
     coconuts and floated off to the Snooz.

     Roll da flic, Zorch....

     Dear Reverend Visage,

     I've just returned from watching the movie version of Hunter
     S. Thompson's "Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas." If I didn't
     know better, I'd swear that the hotel scenes had been filmed
     in your living room. Who'd have thought that art directors
     on movies would be able to independently create the same six
     inch deep flotsam of backed up sewage and the lampshades
     nailed to walls with Marlin spikes. The movie is excremental
     so you can safely avoid watching it. The book wasn't as
     badly trashed as the movie version of "Even Cowgirls Get The
     Blues" but the film misses the whole point of a savage
     journey into the heartland of America. The visual effects
     were quite pleasing since they rendered Young Republicans
     appropriately as reptilian carnivores.

     Speaking of reptiles, I see that Bob Kohl has carried
     through with his threat and removed Gerry Calhoun as the NC
     of his net. Naturally, this occurred while Bob "noted" Satti
     slumbered. Poor Satti didn't fire enough neurons to head off
     Kohl's nastiness and now will have to bleat his usual piffle
     about the sanctity of policy. Since Kohl is one of the few
     fartcatchers left in the elflord domain who support Satti,
     it must be heartbreaking to see a protege make Fidonet so
     enjoyable for the serfs in the Region 10 domain. The good
     news is that both Moravsik and Tannacore continue to add
     their bottomless wit in support of Bob "comatose" Satti's
     narcoleptic rule. Our prayers and our edible underwear
     should go out to them in their few picoseconds of sentient
     thought.

     His Zorchness has been strangely silent in the echos
     recently, which must mean that he has taken advantage of his
     newly reconstituted set of wheels to venture to far off
     places. I was hoping he'd cough up an interview with Rosanna
     Arquette but he probably had someone less fascinating in
     mind.

     I am including a rather lengthy quote today, written by Fred
     Ennis (163/136). Mr. Ennis has served as NC of Net163 and RC
     FIDONEWS 15-21               Page 5                   25 May 1998


     of Region 12. Mr. Ennis invites comments and suggestions to
     the Sysop Bill of Rights.


     "1. Nodenumbers shall be granted on request to sysops who:
          -are able to negotiate mail sessions properly;
          -keep an up to date nodelist; and,
          -maintain operations during mandatory hours.

     2. No sysop may be removed from Fidonet for anything other
     than repeated technical non-compliance.

     3. Any sysop can obtain an echomail feed wherever the sysop
     wishes. Conversely, no one is required to provide an
     echomail feed.

     4 Every sysop in Fidonet shall have the right to vote by
     secret ballot for their NC, RC, and ZC at least every two
     years.

     5. All Fidonet sysops may run for *C positions in their
     nets, regions and zones.

     6. Voting in elections shall be held by secret ballot, and
     returning officers shall ensure that sysops can verify that
     their ballot was counted properly.

     7. Policy complaints, evidence and decisions are public
     information. *C's are accountable for maintaining a history
     of decisions and passing them on to their successors.

     8. In the event of a conflict between policy and this Bill
     of Rights, the Sysop Bill of Rights will be the authority."

     I think that Fred's approach is probably the way to go with
     respect to returning Fidonet to some semblance of sanity and
     fairness. Rather than try to convince the cretins who now
     infest the elflord positions, perhaps it is time the sysops
     themselves took the initiative and declared their rights
     which supersede any rule created by the self-serving and
     self-perpetuating efforts of the elflords.

     Mr. Ennis hasn't declared his intentions with respect to the
     Sysop Bill of Rights, but I think it would be marvelous if
     the document were submitted to a Zone level sysop vote. If
     adopted, it would certainly carry more jurisprudent weight
     than the current Peefour abomination.

     I must go Visage, David Moufarrage is alleged to be sitting
     on the roof singing a rousing chorus of "Nearer My Bob To
     Me" and I'll have to get him down before he disturbs the
     peacocks. By the way, Walloonetta phoned and asked my
     permission, in your absence, whether she could get
     miscellaneous body piercings. I told her to go ahead and
     that as her father, you'd thank me later.

     I found that when the puppy is set to fit on a white background, that
     the lines around the ears and tail have problems.  Feel free to rip
     the puppy out of my web page if you like, which has fixes to it.
     While granted you will have to remove the 100.00 bill surrounding it,
     it should be fairly easy to fix.  If you like, I can do that for you
     as well.

     To the Editor Zorch:
     Issue #19 was the best, most informative issue in years!  If you can
     build a fire with even half of the DEAD WOOD in the nodelist, you
     will open a lot of eyes..specially the remaining nodes.  They may
     then feel their worth IS important, not just part of a "was once upon
     a time" node And just as important is the touch of sanity in the form
     of humor to make the work enjoyable.  Thank You Zorch.

     Also to Doc Logger,
     Thanks for an indepth touch on most of what needs to be corrected by
     the ZC Bob Satti, and bringing it to the national/international
     attention.  Hopefully he will do something about King Kohl and his
     Konduct.  I personally wouldn't care if he held his finagled ZEC, but
     for R10's sake remove him from R10C, which acts as R10EC also no
     matter what he says.  Thanks for having the guts to print the truth.
     Kohl pulled N2004C Gerry Calhoun's flag this nodediff, for no reason
     other then HE cannot work with Gerry anymore because he wouldn't
     remove N2004EC when King Kohl got peeved at her.  Nothing to do with

     how well the mail flows or how happy the downlinks are, only how
     unhappy HE is as King Kohl.
