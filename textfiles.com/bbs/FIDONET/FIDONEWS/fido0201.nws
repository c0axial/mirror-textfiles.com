                The new years first newsletter ... more and more
        articles and ads every week. One complaint from a few
        people: not too much of interest to general users, so far
        all articles have been from Sysops. While that is fine,
        maybe encourage a few users to send articles? FidoNews is
        NOT only for sysops, it is for anyone.

                Still looking for a name for the FidoNet Users
        Group. As mentioned last week, the idea is to find a name of
        four words, such that F I D O is an acronoym, as well as the
        first word ... recursive name.
         
                With the European and Asian traffic building up,
        probably the second word should be International. So ...

                An article should have your name, node number (if
        applicable), followed by the text. Text can be any ASCII
        derivative; WordStar, soft paragraphs, 8th bit set, etc are
        all OK.

        unique, especially if you send it by FidoNet, so you dont
        overwrite another article.


                 Article (Warning?) Submitted by David Horowitz (SysOp 317)

                 As many of you already know, Fido does not care if  the  file
                 name  is listed in the FILES.BBS file.  If the user knows the
                 name of the file or does a wildcard download he can  get  the
                 file.

                 What is prompting me to write this is that  I  just  realized
                 that he does not even have to know the name of the file.  Any
                 user can do an *.* find (ie.  L *.*).  With this a  user  can
                 get a 'raw display' of every file area he has access to.

        [ED. Note: L (nor F) does not list RawFiles, ie. the actual files on 
        the disk. It lists only the contents of FILES.BBS. Unless the R command 
        is low enough privelege, users cannot get a list of files.

        It is correct though, that download *.* >WILL< be able to download any
        files in the directory, and selective download (like "USER.BBS") works
        too. ]

                 This just brings out the very important fact that you  should
                 never  keep Licenced (Non-public Domain) software in any user
                 accesable area.

                 This has also prompted me to make the raw display  command  a
                 normal  privelaged  command.    Since  it is very easy to get
                 files that should not be there in the first place, I might as
                 well  make  the  users  life  a  little  easier.    Since the

                 FILES.BBS file takes a long time to display, and often has  a
                 lot of text that has already been read countless times.

                 I would also like to ask other SysOps to do the  same  thing.
                 When  looking  around  Fido Systems many of the files are the
                 same.  On  almost  every system  I  have  to  read  the  same
                 descriptions  over  and  over  again.   I am sure you see the
                 redundancy in this.  That's all I have to  say,  and  to  any
                 Sysop  that does make R(aw display a normal privelage command
                 - thanks in advance.

                                         800 for Fido!
             In the December 24th edition of "FidoNews," there was an article 
        discussing the feasability of running FidoNet through an 800 number.
        This particular idea interested me so I did some studying. The only company 
        currently capable of running an 800 number is AT & T. The rate schedule was
        run down in the previous article but for a short synopsis...
                 Installation : 366.95
               Monthly Service:  36.80
          Usage Charges / Hour:   9.22 (11PM - 8 AM) (All Weekend)
        Let us figure that the computer (& 800 number) would be used 10% (a modest
        estimate) of the time. 
                  Monthly Charge : 36.80
             (10% of the time)   :342.98 (Hey Guys! I got that without Sidekick!)
                    Total Chage  :379.78
        Figuring on 150 nodes in 3 months (prospective start date..)
        at mandatory participation : 2.53 per month
        at eighty percent          : 3.16 per month
        Very marginal results you must say...

        Part II -- Initial Set-Up
             I, Brian Driscoll, propose that we (all of us crazy sysops), donate
        a system to be used as the 800 fido connection. I propose that the system
        should be an IBM PC. This system should be put in either of two places:
        1) In the state with the fewest Fido Boards (800 does not include home state)
        2) Given to the beloved and exalted author (that's you Tom. .. ) to be
        run from California. He deserves it... (Maybe .. Maybe not...)
        The system would be purchased through The Pacesetter Company (that's me..).
        The system will cost wholesale cost..... for exact figures.. see below
        1 IBM PC w/ 2 DS/DD Drives : 1488.35
        1 AST 6-PAK w/ 384K, etc...:  385.00
        1 20 MB Internal Hard Disk :  825.00 (Approx.)
        1 Monochrome Set           :  325.00 (Approx.) (Montior + Card)
              Total Cost           : 3023.35
        +     800 installation     :  366.95
                                     3390.30
        divided by 120 sysops (80%) : 28.25 per node

        Part III -- Secondary Expansion
              Secondary Expansion would be solved by the additional funds received
        by new sysops (and nodes). In this way, we can build an account that will
        earn interest (if put in a bank). This would provide for further expansion 
        and necessary money for any repairs. 

        Part IV -- MSPRINT Service --
             The only other alternative available would be to go with Sprint. This
        requires a serparate access code for each specific area. This is very similar
        to calling CompuServe ... to go this way...
             Installation  :  45.00
             Monthly Charge:  15.00
             Usage per hour:   7.24
        A little bit cheaper than AT & T ... 
             Monthly Service : 15.00
            (10% of the time):269.32          (800 Number used 10% of the time)
                   Total     :284.32
        Cost for mandatory use (150 sysops) : 1.90
        Cost for 80 % use      (120 sysops) : 2.37
        As you can see this would be a good deal cheaper than going with AT & T.

        Part V - The End
            I have (hopefully) explained the basic ideas behind 800 use. My facts
        and figures were given to me by AT & T and Sprint respectively. They do differ 
        with Mr. Baker report. I am not sure of the reason for this. Next week, I will
        try to delve into the possibility of using a 800 number for a national Fido
        Connection (CompuServe-like). 
             All Comments should be directed to:
             Fido # 305 (301) 299-3228 (Data)
        Thanks for all your time and effort in reading this report. Hopefully,
        you have gained something out of it. (other than a few good yawns)
        Thanks again,
        Brian D. Driscoll



        From: Jon Tara on FIDO92
        Subject: 800 number

             I can spot a few flaws in Ben Baker's (FIDO 10) suggestion of
        a national FIDOnet server:

             1) The figures he has quoted sound optimisticaly low.  I checked
                into 800 service a couple of months ago, and the costs were
                much higher.  I can't find my notes, and I'm not willing to
                go through the hassle I went through to get them the first
                time, so I can't quote exact figures.  It was more like $10/hr
                night though.  The 5.40/hr figure may be based on a certain
                (very high) volume.  Other companies provide "800-like" service,
                by the way.  You dial a local access number, then a six-digit
                code.  Costs are generally a bit lower than ATT (but still not
                as low as $5.40/hr) and you can have it dial-in to a hunt
                sequence, with no limit on the number of simultaneous calls.

             2) I doubt that FIDOnet currently has sufficient volume to support
                such a service.  Once newsletter distribution is perfected







fidonews     --           06 Jan 85  21:33:27           Page 6

                and we get a few different newsletters flying around, maybe
                it will.

             3) Billing 50-100 systems is going to be a major hassle.

             4) The twit factor.  This is the real killer.  Some twit is
                GOING to find out the 800-number and dial-in constantly.  
                FIDOnet hangs up if contact isn't established, but that
                takes at least 30 seconds.  With an autodialer, said twit(s)
                could insure that we get billed for 90% or so of the time
                that the system is able to receive calls, and at no cost
                to them!

            I think, rather, that the key to low-cost FIDOnet service is finding
        the right long-distance company, and pooling local nodes to qualify for
        volume discounts.  (For example, I use Telemarketing Communications
        Corp.  They aren't very big, so their service is unfortunately available
        in a few cities - check your yellow pages.  They lease ATT Watts lines
        (not a satellite or microwave network, although presumably ATT makes
        use of those at times) bill in six-second increments with no one-minute
        minimum or additional first minute charge.  My maximum message cost
        anywhere in the U.S. is 8 cents.)

             There are also many corporate and academic phone networks and  
        leased lines and trunks which get little use at night, where FIDOnodes
        could be set up.  The biggest problem with these right now, though,
        is that you need nodes on both ends to get a two-way link.  I would
        urge Tom to go ahead and add two-way message exchange capability,
        so that we could take advantage of those links.  There should be some
        capability to designate nodes to "poll" whether there is outgoing
        traffic or not, so that incoming messages could be picked up on a
        regular basis.Article for FidoNet News

        As  a  followup to some of the suggestions raised in the  31  Dec 
        Newsletter:

        1.  (Minor Point):  If possible, please adopt a naming scheme for 
        the  newsletter  files that identifies each issue with  a  unique 
        name that makes archiving them a little easier.

        2.  I agree with the suggestion for "picking up mail", "polling", 
        or whatever you wish to call it.  We are all using 1200 baud (and 
        I  would guess 2400 baud in the near future) full duplex  modems, 
        yet  all  file  transfers use half duplex  protocols.   Would  it 
        actually  be  feasible for two Fido's to swap mail files  at  the 
        same time (in full duplex)?   Of course,  the length of the total 
        phone  call  would be dictated by whichever end has  the  longest 
        file to send.

        The accounting system would have to CREDIT and debit based on the 
        adjusted  transfer.   I.E.  if node #5 calls node #6 and sends  3 
        messages but retrieves 5,  node #5 should have a net credit of  2 







fidonews     --           06 Jan 85  21:33:35           Page 7

        messages on node #6.  Could get very tricky quickly.

        3.   (More  reasonable)   I would like to see a separate  dialing 
        parameter file for specifying long distance dialing.   Currently, 
        the  nodelist file must be manually edited to  adjust  for:   the 
        local  area  code (other local nodes must not have area codes  in 
        their  phone numbers),  the type of long distance  dialing  (some 
        parts  of  the  country prefix long-distance calls  with  a  "1", 
        others do not),  and possible local pbx codes (outside lines from 
        office  phones  may require an "8",  or  a  "9".   Finally,  some 
        systems, (unfortunately a Rolm switch where I work), require an 8 
        digit  (more  or  less)  access code.   Thus  the  whole  dialing 
        sequence might be "8,12345678,(415)-555-1212".   By putting  this 
        "user  dependent"  dialing stuff in a separate file,  the  master 
        node list would not have to be changed by anyone.

        The "DIALING.BBS" file might have:
        local area code: 408
        local dialing prefix string: 8,  (comma is "Hayes" pause)
        long distance dialing prefix string: 8,12345678,

        Of course, the dialing routines in FidoNet would know to read the 
        parameter file and adjust the dialed number accordingly.

        3A.  (low priority)  If the goal of #3 is allow distribution of a 
        virgin  nodelist,  one  might  also argue to keep  the  costs  in 
        another file so that each Sysop could adjust the cost for sending 
        mail  without changing the main  nodelist  file.   Personally,  I 
        don't  think  this is as much of a problem or  could  be  handled 
        later if needed.

        4.   (Not  really a suggestion)  Being a bit new to Fido,  let me 
        ask  a question which borders on the "yet another request  for  a 
        gateway" but hopefully won't be a direct request.

        Assume  that you know FidoNet will only be sending mail/files  to 
        one  other node.   (Can be contrived by using a special  schedule 
        with  only  two  nodes  enabled).   Can one stop  Fido  after  it 
        prepares  the outgoing packet before it actually sends  it,  then 
        using  a non Fido means (like manually XMODEM'ing)  transfer  the 
        file  to  the destination node (which is NOT running Fido at  the 
        moment),  and finally, when Fido is started in the receiving node 
        could it process the incoming packet not knowing that it was sent 
        in this round-about way?

        Now  that I have totally confused everyone,  let me  explain  the 
        (possibly convoluted) reasoning behind this.   If two Sysops, say 
        one on the West Coast and one on the East coast agree to act as a 
        manual gateway, if this technique worked, it might be possible to 
        create  a very viable super-gateway without months and months  of 
        modifications  to  Fido (or perhaps only slight changes  to  make 
        this work.) 

        Why  would  this  be useful in place of the normal  FidoNet  mail 
        link?   Well,  what  if  these two sysops each have access  to  a 
        "private,  but  zero-cost or low-cost communications  link"  that 
        they  have permission to use?   This would allow them to  gateway

        mail between other nodes without having to sacrifice the security 
        of their private link thereby losing the privilege.

        Since  the link is private,  it would never use the same protocol 
        that  FidoNet uses (this is a response to the question  "if  Fido 
        software  could  be enhanced with complete gateway  support,  why 
        would this private-manual-link ever be needed?").

        A  quote  that many of us are familiar with is "Imitation is  the 
        sincerest  form of flattery".   A corollary that is suitable  for 
        readers  of this newsletter and TJ is "requests for  enhancements 
        are the sincerest form of thank-you for a useful program".

        Thanks  Tom  for  a  wonderful  package.   AS  IS  it  is  great.  
        Improvements only make it better and better.
