                                 EDITORIAL
     =================================================================

     This week's guest editorial is by Randy Edwards, 1:132/555.


                           The Future of FidoNews

          Well, the FidoNet convention has come and gone.  We now have
     (like it or not) the IFNA Board of Directors in place, committees
     have  been  set  up  and  the  whole  apparatus  appears  to   be
     functioning.

          A  while  back in the infamous SYSOP echo there was a fierce
     debate over FidoNews.  The main issue of this debate was the fact
     that FidoNews was declared  to  be  IFNA's  official  newsletter.
     Many  suggested  that IFNA make up a new newsletter.  Most people
     agreed that the content of FidoNews wouldn't change too much with
     it becoming the official IFNA newsletter.

          Has the FidoNews been changed by it becoming IFNA's official
     newsletter?  Should it  change  more,  less,  or  remain  as  is?
     Should  the  policy  of  "you  send  it  and  I'll publish it" be
     changed?  Does the FidoNews appeal to  the  majority  of  FidoNet
     users?

          These  are  all  legitimate  questions.  Over  the  last few
     months I've noticed the many "political" articles that have  been
     popping  up in the FidoNews in ever increasing numbers.  Now it's
     hard to do anything without politics,  but do we  need  to  limit
     these in some way - or do we need to encourage more of them?

          After  the FidoNet conference I eagerly awaited news of what
     happened at the conference.  I wanted to know what  went  on  and
     what  was decided.  What I got in the FidoNews was the minutes of
     the IFNA meetings.  Though I applaud the work of  the  author  of
     the   minutes,   they  lacked  the  "newsy"  feeling  that  gives
     excitement to the reader.  In fact they sort of  reminded  me  of
     the boring memos and policies that I have to read at work.  Since
     I  had  already  learned  much  of what went on at the conference
     through the EchoMail I stopped reading the minutes after  a  page
     or two and quickly dumped that issue into my text files area.

          Is  this the proper place for IFNA to put the minutes of its
     meetings?  True,  it is a matter which should concern all FidoNet
     Sysops,  but  wouldn't  it be better in a separate IFNA document?
     Perhaps we could replace those minutes with a more  eye  catching
     article in the FidoNews and give reference to an IFNA document if
     the  reader  is  interested in further reading.  Is it proper for
     Tandy Corporation to post press releases in  FidoNews  making  us
     Sysops pay for their advertising?

          Overall, what I'm asking is:  Is FidoNews doing its job?  Is
     it appealing to all users (that includes USERS and Sysops) of the
     FidoNet?  Do we need to modify ARTSPEC.DOC  or  change  the  "you
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 2                   28 Sep 1987


     send  it  I'll  publish  it"  policy?  Should  IFNA  have another
     newsletter or bulletin to put out lengthy messages which may  not
     interest the majority of users of the FidoNet?

          I think these are important questions.  I've always like the
     FidoNews  and found it to be one of the real benefits of being in
     the net.  I'd hate to see it become a Sysop-only  newsletter,  or
     for  it  to  drift  one  way  or  the  other  and  for it to lose
     readership,  or become oriented towards one specific group (other
     than  FidoNet users).  But it has changed and still is changing -
     let's make sure we know where it's going.

     It is with regret that I announce the Resignation  of  Ben  Baker
     from his positions of Zone 1 Coordinator,  Director of IFNA,  and
     Vice President - Technical Coordinator.

     Ben has served for over three years as our Technical Coordinator,
     "The Keeper of the Nodelist." During that time not  only  was  he
     one of the main designers of our present routing concepts, but he
     has  provided many specialized utilities to automate the nodelist
     handling procedure, has interceded in many problems and squabbles
     dealing  with  Network  concerns  (in   his   position   as   the
     International  Coordinator),  and  has spent uncountable hours in
     the thankless task of making sure  that  the  Nodelist  gets  out
     correctly and on time.

     Ben indicated to me that the reason for his decision were complex
     but  cited  the  fact  that  the emotional fire necessary for the
     tasks he handles had "just burnt out." This has prompted  him  to
     "Take  a  sabbatical for a few months" in order to unwind and and
     regenerate.

     Speaking for many,  I'm sure that I can wish Ben  all  the  best,
     hope  that  things work out for him,  and look forward to meeting
     him again on the Net.

     One last thing that Ben jokingly said to me  was,  "Well,  here's
     one  'emperor'  that  they  won't  have  to worry about anymore."
     Although the humor was obvious,  there was also  a  hint  of  the
     irony  that  must  have  been  felt  during the past year.  It is
     unfortunate that a lack of understanding  and  trust  has  helped
     contribute to us losing one of our strongest contributors.

     Good luck, Ben, and thanks for everything!

     Don Daniels, President International FidoNet Association

                  = THE TRAGEDY OF AN ON-LINE ADDICTION =
                             - by Steve King -

     "Did  you  know  that last month's (expletive) phone bill is over
     $450?" my wife scolded me in her  harshest,  my-husband-the-child
     voice.  "That's  more than twice the monthly payment you make for
     that (expletive) computer!" she continued  as  she  escalated  to
     screaming.

     "I  confess!  I confess!" I sobbed.  "I'm just an on-line junkie;
     I'm addicted to my modem!  I guess I'll just have to join  Modems
     Anonymous before I owe my soul to the phone company."

     As  a counselor for Modems Anonymous,  I hear numerous variations
     of the preceding story every day.  That insidious disease,  modem
     fever,  is exacting a tragically large toll from the cream of our
     society's computer users.  Modem-mania is  sweeping  through  the
     very foundations of our country and there seems to be no stopping
     it.  This disease (yes, it is a social disease of almost epidemic
     proportions)  is  becoming such a calamity that soon there's even
     going to be a soap opera about on-line addiction named,  "All  My
     Modems."

     If  you  don't already own one of those evil instruments called a
     modem,  take warning!  Don't even think about buying  one.  Modem
     fever  sets  in very quietly;  it sneaks up on you and then grabs
     you by the wallet, checkbook or, heaven forbid, credit cards.

     Once you own a modem,  you enter the insidious addictive trap  by
     "dialing  up"  a  friend  who also has a modem.  For some strange
     reason, typing messages to each other fascinates you. (Even if it
     is less than 10% of the speed that you can speak the  same  words
     over  a  normal  voice  phone link.) Of course,  you make several
     attempts at hooking up before you  finally  figure  out  that  at
     least one of you must be in the half duplex mode;  that discovery
     actually titillates you (sounds impossible, but it's true).

     Then your modem-buddy (friend is too good a  term)  sows  another
     seed on the road to on-line addiction by giving you the number of
     a  local  BBS (Bulletin Board System).  Once you get an BBS phone
     number,  you've taken the first fatal step in a journey that  can
     only end in on-line addiction.

     After  you  take  the  next  step  by dialing up the the BBS your
     modem-buddy told you about, you find that it's very easy to "log-
     on." This weird form of conversation with an unattended  computer
     is  strangely  exciting,  much  more so than just typing messages
     when you're on-line with your modem-buddy.  The initial bulletins
     scroll by and inform you about the board,  but you're too "up" to
     comprehend most of it.  Then you read some of the messages in the
     message section and maybe,  in a tentative manner,  you enter one
     or two of your own.  That's fun,  but the  excitement  starts  to
     wear  off;  you're  calming  down.  Thinking  that  it  might  be
     worthwhile to go back  and  re-read  the  log-on  bulletins,  you
     return to the main BBS menu.

     Then  it happens.  The BBS provides the bait that entices you all
     the way into the fiery hell of modem addiction.  As you  look  at
     the BBS main menu to learn how to return to the log-on bulletins,
     you  find an item called FILES.  By asking your host computer for
     FILES, you thread the bait onto the hook of corruption; the FILES
     SUBMENU sets the hook.  You start running with the line when  you
     LIST  the files;  you leap into the air with the sheer joy of the
     fight  when  all  those  public   domain   program   titles   and
     descriptions  scroll  by.  They're FREE!!!  All you have to do is
     tell the bulletin board to download (transmit) them to  you.  You
     download  your  first  program  and you're landed,  in the creel,
     cleaned and ready for the  cooking  fires.  In  just  55  minutes
     after you logged-onto the board,  you've downloaded six programs,
     one of them is Andrew Fleugelman's PC-Talk,  version 3 (truly  an
     instrument for evil).

     BBS-LIST.DOC,  which  is  also  among  the  files you downloaded,
     contains a list of a great number of bulletin  boards  throughout
     the  country.  (There's  evil all around us,  constantly tempting
     us!) You print the list and find about  60  RBBS  phone  numbers.
     (Have  mercy  on our souls!) The list also gives you the hours of
     operation,  communications parameters and informs you about  each
     board's specialty.  You decide to try PC-Talk and use it to dial-
     up  an BBS about three states away.  Since the line is busy,  you
     pass the time entering all those BBS phone numbers into PC-Talk's
     voluminous dialing directory.

     You try the number again -- still busy.  You think, "Hey, there's
     one that specializes in  Pascal  programs.  Maybe  I'll  try  it.
     It's  about  half-way across the country,  but it's after 5pm and
     the phone rates have changed.  It won't be too expensive."

     The Pascal board answers.  After  45  minutes  you've  downloaded
     another  five programs.  Then you call another board -- only this
     one's completely across the country from California,  in Florida.
     And  so  it goes on into the night...  And the next night...  And
     the next...

     Some days it gets to you.  You begin to  feel  the  dirtiness  of
     modem addiction,  particularly when your wife makes you feel like
     a child by berating you for those astronomical phone bills --  if
     she  hasn't divorced you by then.  Every time you sit down before
     your computer to do some work,  you dial up another BBS  instead.
     If  that  one's busy,  you call another,  and another,  until you
     connect.  Then you feel OK,  almost "high." When you finally hang
     up, you still can't work; you can only dial up another BBS.

     Your  downfall  as  an on-line addict is just another one of this
     society's terrible tragedies,  such as polygamy or the compulsion
     to  circle  all  the  numbers on computer magazine "bingo cards."
     Eventually your whole social life relies upon only  the  messages
     you  find  on electronic bulletin boards;  your only happiness is
     the programs you have downloaded.  (You never try  any  of  them,
     you only collect them.)

     Hope exists,  however.  We, the dedicated but under-paid staff of

     Modems Anonymous, have done extensive research to find a cure for
     modem mania,  which has been ruining hundreds of  lives.  And  we
     have  succeeded  in  our quest.  The cure is really quite simple,
     yet effective:

     Set up your own bulletin board system.  Then all the other  modem
     addicts  will  phone  you,  and their wives can nag at them about
     $450 phone bills. And you can find peace -- at last.

                                   -----

     This  is one of the most amusing (and bitterly true) stories I've
     read.  I don't know who Steve King is,  but thanks Steve!  And by
     the  way  Steve,  running  a BBS doesn't work either - if you try
     that you discover EchoMail! - Randy Edwards, Sysop 132/555

     Bill Paul
     The Think Tank
     Opus, 1:123/7

             One Sysop's Thoughts on fee-based bulletin boards


     I've been seeing more and more "pay" systems these  days  -  that
     is,  those  that charge a fee to access the system.  This fee can
     take any number of forms;  those that charge a monthly or  yearly
     "flat  rate",  those  that  charge by the minute or hour for time
     spent online,  and those that request "donations" from the users.
     I am personally opposed to all three, for a variety of reasons.

     It should be noted that I am not speaking of "pay systems" in the
     traditional sense of the word,  that is,  CompuServe, The Source,
     GEnie,  etc.  Nor does this apply to systems which are  sponsored
     by  and for a limited number of users (members-only systems for a
     user  group,   a  corporate  entity  or  some   other   organized
     association of users).  I am referring to your average, public or
     semi-public  privately-operated bulletin board - the kind we call
     day  in  and  day  out  all  over  the  country.   Now  that  you
     (hopefully)  have  some idea of what my definition of a "bulletin
     board" is for purposes of this article,  let me share my  reasons
     for not supporting such systems (from a sysop's point of view).

      1. The Think Tank is operated on my own computer and phone line.
         I  paid  for  the system myself,  and I pay for the telephone
         bills, maintenance, shareware fees for user utilities, floppy
         disks for backups, paper, and any other supplies, software or
         hardware I need to make  the  system  operate  smoothly.  The
         point  is,  no one ASKED me to use this computer to operate a
         bulletin board!  It was MY decision,  so  why  should  I  ask
         users to support my hobby financially?

      2. The  previous sentence is important to me,  and it bothers me
         that we may be losing sight of the fact that bulletin  boards
         started out as HOBBIES,  not money-making ventures.  Sure,  I
         know that very few (if any) sysops actually make a profit  by
         charging  fees to users,  but in my opinion,  asking users to
         pay for my hardware and/or software removes me from the realm
         of "hobbyists" and places me  in  the  position  of  POSSIBLY
         showing  a  profit  (no  matter  how remote the chances).  It
         could  also  cause  the  IRS  to  take  an  interest  in   my
         activities.  Income  from a hobby is taxable;  losses are not
         deductible.  Who needs that hassle?

      3. Charging a fee to access  my  system  also  places  me  in  a
         position  of being obligated to the users.  If the hard drive
         crashes, or the software develops bugs, I would have at least
         a moral obligation to restore the system  to  full  power  as
         soon as possible.  Sure,  I know I could pull the plug at any
         time, take the money, and run.  I even saw a captured session
         from a fee system which said that a  fee  was  required,  but
         nothing  was  guaranteed.  I don't think I could operate like
         that and still sleep well at night.

      4. In my opinion,  I am providing a somewhat valuable service to
         callers.  Some  sysops  have told me that this entitles us to
         charge for these services (access to public-domain  software,
         message sections,  FidoMail,  "outside" games or features, or
         whatever else may be available on any given  system).  I  say
         "Bunk!".  The  callers  to  The  Think  Tank  don't  "owe" me
         anything; in fact, I owe THEM more than I could even begin to
         express.  I receive much of the latest and greatest  software
         through their generous uploads, I get most (if not all) of my
         ideas  for  new  message or file areas from users,  and I get
         lots  of  conversation  which  makes  me  think,  laugh,  and
         sometimes pound my keyboard in frustration.  And I love every
         minute  of  it.  For  this  they  should pay me??  I repeat -
         Bunk!

      5. Okay,  this is the paragraph where I bend my  own  "rules"  a
         bit.  EchoMail.  That  wonderful feature which allows a large
         number of BBS systems to share messages on  an  international
         scale.  I  currently carry only two EchoMail areas.  One is a
         local echo (free),  and the other is forwarded to me  by  the
         generous HOST of Net 123 (thanks, Jerry!).  However, should I
         decide to add an EchoMail area sometime in the future, I will
         still  not charge users for the privilege of reading messages
         and participating in the discussion.  The key phrase here  is
         if  *I*  decide  to  add  an Echo area,  that is,  one that I
         personally am interested in.  Now,  if a group of users wants
         me to provide an EchoMail conference which I have no interest
         in,  I'll  be  glad  to do so (disk space permitting),  but I
         would also have no qualms about expecting the  users  to  pay
         for the long-distance calls.  This would not qualify the Tank
         as  a  "pay"  system  by  my  definition,  because ONLY those
         callers who requested the Echo area would be required to  pay
         for it (and only they would be able to access it).

     I know there are a lot of pay systems out there, so rebuttals are
     expected and welcomed.  Flames,  pot-shots,  pats on the back, or
     what have you can be sent  to  The  Think  Tank,  123/7  (24-hour
     "Crash Mail" accepted), via a FidoNews article, or by direct call
     (but  you'll  have to call twice;  registration is required).  If
     you operate a pay system,  I'd be interested in knowing  how  you
     justify  your  fees,  or what you offer users that is unavailable
     elsewhere for free.  Likewise,  if you are a user who has paid  a
     fee to access a particular system, I'd like to know what prompted
     you to do so.  I'm not trying to start World War III here, far be
     it  from me to "tell" anyone how to operate their BBS.  Just call
     me curious...

                          QNX Echomail Conference
                 Real-time Process Control for the Matrix?

                                 Ken McVay
                  SysOp, The Old Frog's Almanac (220/20)

     A   friend   approached   me   last winter  with  a  request  for
     information  regarding  an  operating  system  powerful    enough
     for    real-time applications, called  QNX.  It was, he'd  heard,
     the  slickest thing to come down the pike since  buttered  bread.
     He  thought  perhaps  the matrix might be able to offer him  some
     data as to just how  well  QNX worked...   I had not heard of the
     product before, and, after sending several inquiries through  the
     echoes, it seemed that no one else had, either.

     In  February, Ken Yerex (340/10) showed me an article  about  QNX
     which  had appeared  in the PC TECH JOURNAL. I read  and  re-read
     the article, and understood at least 10 per-cent of it...the rest
     appeared to have been written in some obscure language understood
     only   by   Frogs  and itinerate Greeks....     I  did,  however,
     understand enough of what was presented to get excited about  the
     potential   QNX  might  offer  to matrix  sysops,  and   sent   a
     note   off   to  the  developers  of QNX  requesting  information
     (Quantum Software Systems, Kanata, Ontario).

     I  received  a  package from   Quantum   which   contained   some
     technical information  even  I  could  understand,  and  a   demo
     diskette...my  excitement over the demonstration led  to  several
     telephone   calls  to Kanata, where Dan Hildebrand, a  programmer
     with Quantum, did his best to answer  (endless)  questions.    As
     my   interest   grew,  so did my telephone bill,  and  I  finally
     suggested  that Dan start  answering  my questions  via  netmail,
     through Al Hacker (163/1) in Ottawa.

     QNX,  it  seemed,  had been around since about  the  time   Moses
     released  the  PC,   and  had  been quietly doing  its  job  ever
     since.  It was, in fact, the first multitasking system   released
     for  the  IBM-PC  (the fully integrated  networking  version  was
     released   in   1984).     A sampling of  end-users  provided  by
     Quantum  read  like a  Who's  Who  in  Business,   and   included
     IBM,   Air  Canada,  AT&T,  Bell,  Bell  &  Howell,   Delco-Remy,
     NASA.....well, you get the idea...  25,000  systems  were already
     in use!

     My   interest   in   QNX  quickly  led   to   a  two-node  "mini-
     conference"  between 163/1 and me, as I was  exchanging   netmail
     with   Dan   nearly every day  anyway...     I  began  extracting
     Dan's  messages and sending the resulting text file all over  the
     net, hoping to generate some  of the  excitement  I was  feeling,
     and  I was successful in expanding the conference.  The  interest
     generated  perked-up  Quantum's  switchboard, and   163/1   began
     receiving  a  lot  of netmail requests asking Dan  for  QNX  demo
     disks.  As a result of all this activity, and  the  interest  Dan
     and  I  shared  in creating a real-time echomail system,  Quantum
     began distributing QNX Development Systems to several sysops   in
     the  matrix.   Shortly  after that program got underway,  Quantum
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 10                  28 Sep 1987


     agreed  to  provide  discounts to matrix sysops  who  had  become
     interested  in   QNX.  As   a   result,   the   system   is   now
     available  at  a 55% discount from Quantum  Software  to  persons
     setting   QNX   based  bulletin  board  systems.   The   complete
     development  system,  with  a  K&R  'C'  Compiler,  retails   for
     $US650.00,  and is available to sysops for under $US300.00.   (or
     about  $US200.00  without the compiler.) QDOS,  a  package  which
     allows the use of PC-DOS as a task under QNX, is $US125.00.

     Shortly  after  Quantum  announced the discount  program,  I  was
     contacted  by   Paul   Edison-Swift   (North   Central   Computer
     Institute,  Madison,  Wisconsin), who sent me a  functioning  QNX
     multiline  bbs complete with source code.  This BBS had  been  in
     use  for over a year at a few sites including the  University  of
     Wisconsin,  and  was  generously released to  public  domain   to
     facilitate the Fido / QNX effort.  I passed a copy of this system
     to  Rick  Duff,  340/11,  one  of  the  recipients  of   a    QNX
     Development System.    Rick  went  to   work   putting   together
     a  matrix-compatible   mailer  so  he  could  connect   the  NCCI
     system to FidoNet.  Rick's QNX Matrix Mailer ( QMM ) is now being
     alpha-tested on  340/11,  (although  Rick  tells me there's  lots
     of  work to do yet before he can release a beta version). One  of
     the problems  Rick  has had  with  QMM  and  the  multiline  NCCI
     system is that of handling arcmail - I understand, however,  that
     the  problem  is close  to  being solved,  and  the  system  will
     soon  be  released  to  QNX end-users  at  no  charge  (for  non-
     commercial use - a fee will be required for commercial use.)

     Note: I have been running SEAdog/Opus under QNX/QDOS since  July,
     on  a  turbo  XT,  with far less  degredation  in  speed  than  I
     experienced  under  DoubleDOS, but I view this as  a  stopgap  at
     best,  until a matrix-compatible QNX multiline is available.  DOS
     applications make direct screen writes which bleed through to the
     QNX  side,  and the only way around it at present is  to  hang  a
     terminal  off  the system. In addition, QNX will only  support  a
     single QDOS task (on a stand-alone system), so you cannot operate
     a multiline SEAdog system, as you could with DesqView. The  setup
     does  permit me to get acquainted with QNX while I'm waiting  for
     Rick's  beta  system. QNX is not  a  cost-effective  multitasking
     system,  therefore,  for DOS applications, nor a  substitute  for
     DDOS  or DesqView...with QNX-level applications, however,  it  is
     immeasurably more powerful. (Networked versions of QNX,  however,
     will  support  a QDOS task on each system in the net  -  any  QNX
     network application may be concurrently utilized by all users  on
     the net - as code and libraries are shared, little demand is made
     on the network's RAM when this is done!)

     What's all the excitement about? (Who needs another multiline bbs
     anyway?)....well,  how about being able to address 16megs of  RAM
     (protected  mode)  on your AT? How about being able  to  hang  10
     terminals  off  your system? How about running 24  virtual  lines
     into  Datapac/Tymenet  with the cpu (AT) idling over 90%  of  the
     time?

     A QNX multiline, running on an AT, would permit echomail messages
     to  be  delivered to a backbone node while the user  that  posted
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 11                  28 Sep 1987


     them was still on the system....it would permit multiple users to
     play a D&D-type maze game simultaneously (real-time!) against not
     only the computer, but against EACH OTHER! It would permit you to
     hang  terminals  and  networked pc's on  the  system  for  office
     applications   and   process  control,  with   little   noticible
     degredation in speed or efficiency...and QNX itself would  permit
     ALL of the resources of your network to be shared, including  all
     available RAM and storage - no need for a dedicated server!

     Those  of you who are interested in QNX are invited to  tap  into
     our QNX conference and say hello. It's readily available, but  if
     you can't locate a node that carries it, contact me netmail and I
     will suggest a spot where you can pick it up.

     If  you  are  interested  in logging  on  to  a  functioning  QNX
     multiline,  you  are invited to call Quantum's QUICS  system,  at
     613-591-0934 (1200bps) or 613-591-0935 (1200/2400). The system is
     also  available (24 lines) through Datapac (85701416), for  those
     of  you with Network User ID's. Another 24-line  system,  CBCHAT,
     operated  by  Carl  Wagar,  of EntreNet  Systems  in  Ottawa,  is
     available through Canada's iNET system. (When you call QUICS, log
     on  as "UPDATE" for both name and password). The  NICC  multiline
     can  be  reached via 608-263-6224 (2400 available  on  the  third
     line,  608-263-2933).  NICC  callers are  advised  to  call  Paul
     Edison-Swift,  608-263-4838,  after  they  register,  so  he  can
     arrange   access,   or   send   him  a   note   via   BITNET   to
     EDISWIFT@WISCMACC. The  author of  'Yunt,' the concurrent, multi-
     user maze game, is running a 10-line QNX system, and I will  post
     his phone numbers as an update in a later article about QNX.

     Copies  of  the NICC multiline may be obtained by  sending  three
     diskettes and return postage to:

     Paul Edison-Swift       or:       Ken McVay
     c/o NCII                          1602B Northfield Road
     610 Walnut Street                 Nanaimo, B.C.
     Madison, WI 53705                 Canada V9S 3A7

     or by downloading it from QUICS.

     If you  are  interested in QMM,  you can  contact  Rick Duff  via
     the QNX Conference, or directly, via 340/11, in Victoria, B.C.

     Those of you who are interested in obtaining a QNX demo  diskette
     (XT  or  AT versions available, so please specify which  one  you
     need)  should send your name and address to Dan  Hildebrand,  via
     163/1 or 163/14 (at the time of writing, Sept.13, 1987, 163/1  is
     DOWN due to drive failure, so 163/14 may be your best best!),  or
     you  can write directly to Dan at Quantum Software, 175  Terrence
     Matthews Crescent, Kanata, Ontario, CANADA K2M 1WA.

     Steve Townsley
     Opus 2:510/17
     Log on the Tyne - Tyneside UK
     CCITT V21/V23/V22/V22bis


                       The Region 25 Omnibus Edition

     Well, there here - Zones. Makenl, Ben Baker's much advertised new
     utility reached the UK this week.  So in a short period  of  time
     the much discussed 'zonesplit' will be upon the network.

     Oddly  enough  most  nodes will remain blissfully ignorant of the
     change.  The nodelist will get a wee bit smaller,  although  with
     the  rate of growth in Europe,  we may end up being more than one
     Zone. Even in communications hungry Zone 1, international mail is
     rumoured to take place only  on  nights  of  the  full-moon.  But
     seriously  NET  510  must be one of the very few nets to mail its
     network news internationally - in our case  Scotland,  Wales  and
     Ireland.

     Hopefully,  the  change  will be for the better.  I well remember
     reading a planned zone like structure in 1985.  The article, in a
     newsletter  for  Europe was written by Henk Wevers.  He certainly
     gets my vote  for  organising  the  european  end  of  inter-zone
     addressing. Thanks Henk.

     - FidoCon -

     Well  FidoCon  1987  did  not europe with the wave of apathy that
     came over from last years'  flames.  I  particularly  appreciated
     Dale Lovell's personal view, presumably written with his portable
     at the conference.

     In sharp contrast to last years' fiasco we in Europe saw a united
     co-operative  group  of sysops helping each other.  Definely what
     was needed.

     As a response to the more 'orderly' appearance of  IFNA  at  this
     years' FidoCon at least two nodes in my NET, 3000 miles from your
     shores,  have  asked  about  joining  IFNA.  The prospects for an
     international committee also look good.

     I would like to thank all the sysops who spent  time,  money  and
     effort  to  get  it right this time.  Hopefully we might organise
     some UK get-together in a few months time.

     - The Argus Project -

     Something which didn't affect yourselves as much  as  Europe  was
     the Chernobyl Nuclear Incident.  Although,  for those of you near
     Three Mile Island,  the story must have  brought  back  many  bad
     memories.

     A group of people in the North East of England have now started a
     radiation   monitoring  project  using  OPUS  as  the  media  for
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 13                  28 Sep 1987


     distributing data around the UK.  We are very  pleased  that  the
     first node is in network 510 (2:510/94).

     The  object  of  the  projects is to provide reliable information
     levels about the actual background radiation levels  in  the  UK.
     Monitoring stations using modems and a 6809 based micro will link
     to a central database and FidoNet.

     So  far  many  of  even the public bodies in the Uk have not been
     informed, even by our national government, about the true effects
     on our environment due to nuclear spillage into the European  air
     system.  Using these custom built monitoring stations, (codenamed
     'The Beast'),  and interacting via FidoNet it may be possible  to
     actually tell you whether to wear a lead lined raincoat next time
     you get this side of the pond.

     - Can You Beat This One -

     Many  US  sysops  must  surely  think  we  joke over here when we
     complain about poor phone  lines.  But  now  that  Opus  has  the
     percentage  efficiency  of the line here are our worst cases,  at
     2400 bps.


     HOST on Tyneside  to  some of its regular nodes.....

     Cardiff    300 Miles   28% worst case 72% best
     London     271 Miles    8% worst case 93% best
     Keswick     70 Miles   25% worst case 60% best
     Argus HQ     1 Mile    60% worst case 80% best (300 bps)
     NL1 (Henk) 400 Miles   50% worst case 75% best


     Mostly we get a 50% hit rate...  ie 1200 bps out of a $1300  2400
     modem.  But remember these are european worst cases. Can YOU beat
     them. Prizes at next FidoCon ??

     - Mail Me -

     I finally took the plunge this week, I took out a Link 7500 Email
     account with Mercury Communications.  Even though most people use
     Telecom  Gold  in  the  UK  (76,000 subscribers in the UK) I have
     decided to try the competition.  Bravery  didn't  go  as  far  as
     surrendering  my  Gold account but,  I would really like to since
     they have annouced a charge increase of between 144% and 570%.

     As a result some of the UK nodes are actually proposing to run an
     Echomail conference to oppose the high costs of Britains  largest
     communications  carrier.  The only parallel in the USA would be a
     national conference to get Congress to close AT&T! Over here even
     the national press (including THe Times) have criticised the high
     price of making a phone call in the UK.  For example, you (in the
     USA),  can  call  me  (in  the  UK) more cheaply than I can phone
     London - 270 miles away.

     What really made me laugh is the new Opus which talks about 'zero
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 14                  28 Sep 1987


     rated calls'.  Several sysops have rang us up to find out whether
     Opus  is  capable  of disabling the phone meters at the exchange,
     they really think you are joking when you talk about  free  local
     calls.

     Local  call  rate  in  the UK is $1 per hour cheap rate and $5 an
     hour peak.

     Anyway,  to get back to my new Email address.  Link 7500  is  the
     same  system  you  call  Easylink in the USA,  I think its run by
     Western Union stateside.  So now I have an Easylink account  I  d
     like to find out if any sysops in the USA use it.... so as I said
     earlier why not mail me!

     - End Zone - (pun intended)

     Last  but  not  least,  will you get more irrelevant jotting from
     Europe...  ???  Only if the ZoneGate works on the 18th, see ya on
     the other side or maybe in Finland the Twilight Zone!

          I'm finally getting around to looking over some of the stuff
     I picked up at FidoCon. I'm going to  be looking  at some  of the
     better pickings over the next few weeks in this column. This week
     it's going to be TBBS by eSoft. This  is a  fantastic product and
     since I  didn't know  anything about it until the conference, I'm
     going  to  assume  that  many  of  you  reading  this  don't know
     anything. I'm not really an expert on TBBS yet, so there may be a
     few errors. I'll count on people like Phil Becker (the author and
     president of  eSoft) to  let me  know about  my mistakes and I'll

          TBBS is not just another bulletin  board program.  Many Opus
     sysops may  boast about  how configurable  their boards are, they
     don't know what configurable  means!  PC-Board  sysops  may boast
     about how  they can  set up  several systems  to act as one board
     with several nodes, they  don't know  anything about  easy multi-
     line set-up! Lastly all us FidoNet sysops can talk about how much
     Echomail does for us, well TBBS can handle  that too  (although I
     think Bob  Hartman's ConfMail does it better). Having had TBBS in
     my hands for less than a month, I can tell you that it is clearly
     a world  class bulletin  board program.  Some of  the items on my
     quick list of features  include  support  for  up  to  52 message
     areas, up to 30,000 messages, notification of waiting messages at
     logon (for ALL  the  message  areas),  255  privilege  levels, 32
     feature control  authorization flags  (with some being able to be
     set depending on logon speed  and/or  the  line  being  used) and
     that's just the short list.

          Perhaps the most fantastic feature of TBBS is the capability
     of handling up to  16  users  simultaneously  using  only  ONE AT
     computer. Before  I went  to the  conference I  asked a local PC-
     Board sysop what he knew about TBBS and all he could tell  me was
     the high  cost of  the multi-line  version (2.0M, versus 2.0S the
     single line version). His  current PC-Board  software requires an
     individual computer  for each  phone line, he would have come out
     ahead after his second line (he currently has 5 phone lines and 5
     computers all  connected through a network). It was impressive to
     watch a demonstration at FidoCon and see the status lights change
     on 16 modems as you heard their relays click in quick succession!
     Since you can control the setup for each individual line, you can
     even mix and match modems without any difficulty.

          One of  the other  big advantages  to TBBS is the menus. You
     have complete control over every  menu,  with  the  capability to
     make the menu items vary according to the line being used and the
     baud rate. There are no default menus (although  a sample  set is
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 16                  28 Sep 1987


     included), everything is under your control. This means you could
     set up your main menu to  put people  directly into  a particular
     message base  or download  area. It  is up to the sysop to create
     each menu; what the  letter code  and description  are, what they
     do, and  how the  menu should look (for example you could put the
     most used commands at  the top  of the  menu). Their  are over 50
     different  actions  a  command  can  have, including a "goto" and
     "gosub" to another menu. If you're  using  a  "gosub"  to  a menu
     (saving the  menu to  return to),  the stack  will allow up to 20
     return menu adresses. This allows for a lot of menus  and while I
     wouldn't have menus 20 levels deep, it is reassuring to know that
     the capability is there  if I  should ever  need it.  For someone
     switching over  to TBBS  this can  be very  nice, because you can
     make your board look almost identical to your old software. Given
     the complete  control over  the menus,  TBBS can  be made to look
     almost exactly like most of the bulletin board programs available
     today. This  makes it  easier on  your users,  they don't have to
     learn a whole new set of commands, most  of the  commands are the
     same and  they'll even  be in  the same  place. While you have an
     almost unlimited number of menus, you  are limited  to 50 entries
     in each  menu and  each menu being no larger than 4096 characters
     (and of course the 20 level maximum for nesting).

          Questionnaires are just as easy  to  set  up  through  a few
     programs  included  with  TBBS.  You can quickly generate several
     questionnaires for a variety of purposes. Some examples  would be
     registration, voting,  user surveys and on-line order taking (for
     any item you provide to your users on  request) with  ALL of them
     being online  at once  through different menus and commands. It's
     even possible to  prevent  someone  from  taking  a questionnaire
     twice by  having TBBS  automatically change  a user flag (more on
     this later) upon completion. New user  questionnaires and surveys
     only get  filled out  once while  requests to bring files on-line
     can always  be taken.  Once again  you control  exactly what each
     questionnaire does,  and creating  one is almost a trivial affair
     with the utilities eSoft  provides. In  the case  of surveys, you
     can even allow your users to see the current results of your poll
     by creating one menu entry for  each survey.  While some  of this
     may  not  give  the  sysop  anything extra, it can make the board
     nicer for the users.

          Some of the other features that may appeal to users  are the
     on-line  public  conferences  and  the  CB simulator. The on-line
     conferences are NOT message bases. It's a means for allowing many
     of your  users (you've  got 16 line capability after all) to talk
     to each other on-line. You  also  have  the  option  of recording
     these conferences  in order to have an ascii text "transcript" of
     the conference. This option is provided mainly for  business use,
     although I  can see  using it  on a  public board for speeches or
     talks with local figures (a local expert giving  a talk  on high-
     speed modems,  computer security,  or the stock market just for a
     few quick ideas). The CB simulator is just  what is  sounds like.
     An  on-line  private  real  time  conference  between two or more
     users. With 40 channels available, it should be  enough to please
     almost  any  set  of  users.  Other  advantages  to  the user are
     automatic word wrap on message entry with optional word wrap when
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 17                  28 Sep 1987


     reading  a  message.  You  can  go  through  a message base using
     several different methods. Among them forward and reverse by date
     or subject and selectively based on fragments of the From, To, or
     Subject fields in the messages. Log  on and  mail checks  at that
     time are  also quick.  TBBS should be able to find a user name in
     700ms given 16,000 users and the initial mail check will  take no
     more than  180ms. Those  figures are  from eSoft's TBBS Technical
     Specifications and are based  on a  4.77Mhz CPU  whose hard drive
     has a  90ms average seek time. What this means is that log-on and
     message searches are FAST!

          I've already gone over some of the features that will appeal
     to  sysops,  but  I'm  going  to  mention some of them again. The
     ability to control the menus based  on line  being used  and baud
     rate is  one of the more unique aspects of TBBS. It's possible to
     create up to 8 totally  unique  bulletin  boards  using  only one
     computer. The  users might  never know that they were calling the
     "same" bulletin board. You've  got  three  different  methods for
     logging  on  and  control  over  how  new users are handled. This
     allows you to run as open (or closed) a board  as is  feasible in
     your area.  The options  for the system log are also unique in my
     experience. TBBS does more than let you choose whether or not you
     want the  log, and  how much  detail (terse,  detailed, etc.). It
     actually lets you decide what you want it to save  in the  log or
     even to forget the log entirely.

          Control  over  user  access  is  also  very well rounded. In
     addition to the 255 privilege levels, you also have 32  flags for
     each user.  While some  can be  set at logon time, you could also
     use them for your own purposes. One of the best uses I've come up
     with for this feature is to "permanently" turn off the sysop chat
     mode for certain users  who have  a tendency  to page  me all too
     often. While  you can create default time and download limits for
     each privilege level, you  also have  the capability  to override
     these defaults  on a user-by-user basis. I think that this is one
     of nicer way to reward those who are actively participating  on a
     board. Many  people like  to have  co-sysops who  help manage the
     message areas  on a  board. TBBS  makes this  very easy  to do by
     allowing  you  to  define  a  co-sysop  for any particular set of
     message areas. This is  accomplished quickly  and painlessly. All
     you have  to do is mark the appropriate fields in the user record
     and that user has sysop-like access  to messages  in the selected
     areas (message  areas, not  commands; although  you could do that
     just as easily).

          I can not stress enough how  much I  have been  impressed by
     TBBS. It  is easily  the most  flexible bulletin  board program I
     have ever seen. The multi-line version makes an excellent program
     ever better  and wins  high marks  for the ease of upgrading from
     single-line to  multi-line  (almost  no  work  at  all).  My only
     disappointment is  the lack of file transfer protocols. TBBS only
     supports a few ascii protocols,  XMODEM  (CRC  and  checksum) and
     YMODEM (CRC  and checksum).  Yet while this isn't what many of us
     have come to expect  in bulletin  board software,  I think  it is
     sufficient for  almost every purpose. There are still a couple of
     other little features I'm still exploring, so this isn't the last
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 18                  28 Sep 1987


     you'll be hearing of TBBS. Get used to seeing those letters, as I
     think we'll all be seeing a lot more of them in the future.

          Computer pilots of the world unite! We have yet another fine
     flight simulator  game available.  While it  doesn't give you the
     combat  capabilities  of  Jet  or  Flight  Simulator,  it's  been
     promised in  a future  program from the same company. The program
     I'm referring  to is  "Chuck Yeager's  Advanced Flight Simulator"
     (Electronic  Arts,   $39.95  retail).  The  combat  simulator  is
     "announced" on the inside of the package and you can  bet I'll be
     buying of  the first copies off the line, but back to the program
     that's available today. To  begin with,  AFS is  the first flight
     simulator  that  actually  teaches  you  to  fly. Electronic Arts
     accomplishes this through an  on  screen  instructor's  cursor to
     show you  what you should be doing. In addition there are several
     obstacle courses  to fly  through (even  trying to  follow a lead
     plane through  them). Some of the planes available to you in this
     package include a Sopwith  Camel,  a  Mustang,  the  Bell  X-1, a
     Lockheed  SR-71  (my  favorite),  or  even some designs that were
     never built (and in at least one of those cases, it was the right
     decision).  There's  support  for  CGA, EGA and Hercules graphics
     boards as well the capability to  fly  using  the  keyboard  or a
     joystick.

          My only  complaint on AFS is that the disk is copy protected
     with the key-disk method. While it  allows you  to install  it on
     just about anything as many times as you want, you always have to
     put the original disk in drive A. Enclosed inside is a coupon you
     can  send  in  with  ten  dollars  and  get a completely non-copy
     protected version, I just wish that some mention  of this  was on
     the outside of the package. I'd come to expect no copy protection
     from  Electronic  Arts  and  was  surprised  to  see   it.  Final
     statements on AFS are if you enjoyed Microsoft's Flight Simulator
     or the non-combat portions of  Jet,  you'll  have  many  hours of
     enjoyment playing  with it.  Count on nothing but book reviews or
     comments on my flights for the next few weeks as it's been eating
     up all my game playing time.

          As always  I welcome any comments you may have on my column.
     I'd especially like to hear about products and programs you think
     are fantastic,  I like  to pass  the word around on a good thing.
     Below you'll find my Usenet,  FidoNet  and  US  mail  address. Or
     those of  you sending  me mail  through FidoNet  please make sure
     that it is routed through 157/1 as I'm a private node these days.

     World Of Computers
     Whitestone, New York

     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  -  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     ===============================================

     On Sunday October 11, 1987 at the Grand Royal Hotel
     in Hempstead, New York, will be another spectacular
     KGP computer show.

     What makes this show different from ALL other shows
     this year will the introduction of the FIRST PS/2
     compatible computer named the QT/2 which will be
     available at the show for demonstration, evaluation
     and purchase.

     The QT/2 is made entirely in the United States, and
     does not face the import tariff currently being levied
     against other compatibles made in the Far East.

     Standard features of the QT/2 include 3 Megabytes of
     memory on the motherboard, both a 3 1/2 inch floppy
     drive and a 1/4 height standard 360k floppy allowing
     easy transfer of software to/from either format. Both
     serial and parallel ports are included as well as a
     light pen port and a game adaptor port and the display
     adaptor as well.  A 250 watt switching power supply is
     standard with a 300 watt supply available as an option.

     The QT/2 allows hard drives of up to 120 Megabytes to be
     FidoNews 4-37                Page 20                  28 Sep 1987


     installed and operated as a SINGLE drive without the use
     of device drivers.

     All current CGA, EGA, Monochrome and VGA display units
     will operate on the QT/2. Several  expansion boards have
     been tested and perform to specifications.

     The base price of the unit will be $995. This includes
     3 Megabytes of memory and the two floppy disk drives
     as well as the serial and parallel ports, the game
     adaptor port,  the display adaptor and an enhanced AT
     style tactile touch keyboard.

     The unit is covered by a 12 month warranty and service
     can be obtained nationwide from over 1300 repair centers.
