     =================================================================

                                 Copyrights


     Have you looked at the top of the node  list  lately?  More  than
     half  of  the  first  page  is taken up with jawbreaking legalese
     that's supposed to be our copyright notice.  And it just recently
     got worse!

     The original intent was clear enough.  We wanted to  keep  people
     from  selling  the node list.  Somehow in the process we ended up
     forbidding all commercial use.

     What's wrong with that,  you ask?  Well,  what about the  various
     product  support  conferences?  What  about the various companies
     who transact business,  announce new  products,  and  do  product
     support  over the net?  Doesn't that constitute commercial use of
     the node list?

     The Interim Board concluded that it did,  and was in the  process
     of working out  a  commercial  license.  The  new  Board  decided
     otherwise, and chose to amend the copyright notice to allow those
     types  of commercial activity that have always taken place on the
     net.

     That's cool.  Whatever they want.

     The thing that bothered me is that they ended up with a copyright
     notice even more convoluted than before!  Now I realize  that  it
     was a quicky "band-aid" job to hold us over.  I didn't understand
     it  myself  on a first reading,  but I understood what the lawyer
     who wrote it said it meant,  and  I  have  no  objection  to  the
     intent.  I object to the wording!

     Speaking ex-officio from the Peanut Gallery  I  objected  to  the
     language,  and  suggested  that  the  Board  at  least  have  the
     Executive Committee work on something a little closer to English.
     I heard the lawyer who drafted it tell all  sysops,  in  essence,
     "get a lawyer!" I heard a member of the Executive Committee state
     that  of  course  that  was  one  of  the  many things they would
     continually think about.  I did NOT  hear  anything  to  make  me
     think  that  we  can expect a comprehensible copyright notice any
     time in the forseeable future.

     This thing is supposed to be protecting us sysops, right?  So why
     can't it be worded so that we can understand it?

              ONE TO ONE - The Newest Communications Software

     ONE TO ONE is a telecommunications package designed for those  of
     us   who   sometimes  call  friends  with  computers.   The  many
     sophisticated programs that are currently available  do  a  great
     job  for accessing bulletin boards,  information services,  etc..
     HOWEVER,  they all are less than desirable when it comes  to  two
     human beings trying to communicate with each other over the phone
     lines via computers.

     ONE  TO  ONE  is  the first communications program available that
     attempts to address the special needs  of  people  that  need  to
     share data with other people.

     What does ONE TO ONE offer that the others  don't?  With  ONE  TO
     ONE, you and your friend can...

      1) Type  messages  to  each  other  while  a file transfer is in
         progress!

      2) Never worry about garbled text caused by two people typing at
         the same time.  Incoming and Outgoing text appear in seperate
         windows on screen.

      3) "Share"  a text file.  You and a friend can be looking at the
         same text file at the  same  time.  Both  of  you  will  have
         control over scrolling the files contents in a window. At any
         time,  you  can  pause and type notes to each other about the
         file that you are sharing.

      4) Enjoy   the   snazziest   "user-interface"    in    all    of
         telecommunications.


     System Requirements

         - IBM Compatible Computer
         - PC-DOS Or MS-DOS (version 2.0 or later)
         - One Floppy Disk Drive (hard disk not required)
         - At Least 192k Of RAM.
         - One RS-232 Serial Port
         - A HAYES COMPATABLE modem (must support the Hayes AT
           command set)
         - Someone To Call

     ONE TO ONE works with Monochrome as well as Color video cards. If
     you  have  an Enhanced Graphics Adapter,  ONE TO ONE will use the
     CGA mode.

     FidoNews 4-34                Page 3                    7 Sep 1987


     When you install ONE TO ONE,  you will be asked whether you  have
     Touch  Tone  or  Pulse  phone service.  ONE TO ONE will work with
     either.


     ONE TO ONE version 2.2 is distributed in an  archived  form.  The
     "ARC"  archiving utility by System Enhancment Associates was used
     to compress the files in order to  keep  downloading  time  to  a
     minimum.  ARC  has  become  the standard file compression program
     used for electronic software distribution.

     You should have no problem obtaining a copy of the latest version
     of ARC from your friendly  neighborhood  bulletin  board.  Please
     remember that ARC is not free. It will save you money in the long
     run so why not go ahead and pay for it?

     The name of the archived file is 121-V22.ARC.  After "un-arching"
     this file you will see the files below:

         121.EXE      - The program.
         121.DOC      - The documentation for the program.
         121READ.ME   - Notes reflecting any last minute changes.
         WHATSNEW.121 - Notes describing improvements in 2.2

     The  only  file  required  to  start ONE TO ONE is the file named
     121.EXE.  When you run the program for the first time ONE TO  ONE
     looks for other files and creates them if they cannot be found.

     Terminal Mode And Menu Mode

     ONE  TO  ONE has somewhat of a split personality.  You are either
     in TERMINAL MODE where you are waiting for  the  phone  to  ring,
     typing  messages to a friend,  etc.,  or you are in the MENU MODE
     where you are pulling down menus and making selections from them.

     The first screen you see when ONE TO ONE executes  is  the  title
     screen.  This  screen tells what this program is,  warns you that
     this is not free software, begs for compensation, tells who wrote
     it,  and waits for you to press a key.  Just  your  typical  User
     Supported software title screen.

     When you press a key to continue, the modem initialization string
     will be sent to the modem. After this is accomplished, you are in
     TERMINAL  MODE.  This is where you will spend most of your ONE TO
     ONE life.  TERMINAL MODE is where you perform communications with
     your  friends.  Each key you press will be sent out the comm port
     to whoever's out there.  (The exception to this occurrs when  the
     keys that you press are menu selections.)

     All  of  the vital choices from the menus have been mapped to the
     keyboard.  You could call a friend (or be  called),  establish  a
     connection,type  messages,  send  and receive files,  and hang up
     without ever once pulling down a menu.

     Once the computers have started transferring the  file,  you  can
     just sit back and relax if you like.  BUT, if the other person is
     FidoNews 4-34                Page 4                    7 Sep 1987


     also using ONE TO ONE,  you can continue to type messages to each
     other  while  the  file transfer takes place!  In either case you
     will see a status report of the file transfer  displayed  on  the
     Dividing Bar.  After the file transfer is complete, you will hear
     a beeping sound indicating that the transfer is complete.

     Share A File - This is a nifty feature!  Share A File  gives  you
     the  ability to share a text file with a friend.  One of you acts
     as the Sender and the other acts as the Receiver. BOTH USERS MUST
     BE USING ONE TO ONE FOR THIS FEATURE TO WORK PROPERLY.  When  you
     and a friend Share A File,  your screens change into a large area
     at the top two-thirds of the screen.  The bottom portion  of  the
     screen  is split into 2 sections so that you may continue to type
     to each other while sharing the file.

     Available  on  107/246  as  121-V22.ARC  for  SEAdog  request  or
     download.

     Don Daniels, 107/210

                           COMMITTEE INFORMATION


     One of the areas  in  which  we  have  discovered  some  start-up
     problems is  that  of  Committee  Membership.  According  to  the
     Bylaws,  the President is supposed to name the various members of
     the standing committees at the annual meeting.  However,  due  to
     the fact that:

      o So many other priorities had to be addressed during the annual
        meeting,

      o We don't have any real track record as to who can do what,  or
        who wishes to do what,

      o We wanted to open the committees to as many  qualified  people
        as possible,

     what  we  decided  to  do  was to name provisional members of the
     various committees and  then  provide  the  opportunity  for  the
     Chairman  of each commmittee (as appointed by the Chairman of the
     Board of Directors,  Ken Kaplan) to select more members from  the
     additional volunteers.

     What  I am also suggesting to the Committee Chairman is that they
     consider a two-tiered arrangement when it  comes  to  membership.
     The reason for this is based on a combination of things: In order
     for each committee to operate in session,  it is necessary that a
     quorum be present.  With all of us scattered all  over  not  only
     the U.S.,  but the world as well, this could present difficulties
     if all recommended parties and volunteers are automatically  made
     members.  In  certain cases then,  it may be advisable to make up
     the committee of those who do not have constraints  of  time  and
     distance,  while  at  the same time utilizing the services of the
     other volunteers as either "associate members" or as  workers  on
     special projects.

     The  point  is  to  try  to  open  up participation to as many as
     possible,  provide opportunities for them all to contribute  (and
     receive appropriate recognition),  and yet not be encumbered with
     an inoperable arrangement.  I hope that the membership will  bear
     with  us  as  we  all  learn how to deal with a new and sometimes
     complex situation.

     Below I am providing the list  of  those  individuals  that  have
     either  voluntereed  or been recommended for the various standing
     committees.  We expect to add to this list with other  volunteers
     from  throughout  the  Net.  We  hope that each of our supporters
     will consider carefully the opportunities and will  volunteer  to
     participate  in those areas in which they feel they could be most
     productive.

     Please make your request directly to the Chairmen of the specific
     committee(s)  in  which  you   are   interested.   Indicate   any
     FidoNews 4-34                Page 6                    7 Sep 1987


     constraints  you  may  have  and whether you think that you could
     best participate as a full member or as an  "associate",  perhaps
     handling  a  special  project or requirement.  Also,  if you have
     been suggested for a particular  committee  but  feel  that  your
     participation  there  would  not be in our mutual best interests,
     don't hesitate to say so.  In any event, please get in touch with
     the Committee Chairmen by September 15th.  At that time  we  want
     the  Committee  Chairmen  to provide the Secretary with a list of
     their recommendations for both full and "associate" members.

     Note: If you volunteered before but we  lost  your  name  in  the
           hassle, DON'T FEEL BAD - just volunteer again!

     Les Casey,  163/13


                             DIPLOMACY via BBS

         Diplomacy,   the  popular  Avalon-Hill  boardgame,   is   now
     available  for  play  in  an  e-mail format.  As of this writing,
     there are two BBS's (163/13 124/109), where games are available.

          163/13 Diplomacy Online Ottawa,Ont Fido (613)225-5836 is the
     only BBS in North America dedicated solely to  the  play  of  the
     popular  war game.  At any time,  up to six games are in progress
     at once,  thus permitting users to join more than  one  game,  if
     desired.   Additionally,  several  online  features  enhance  the
     playability, making, in this writer's opinion,  the e-mail format
     the best alternative to "live" play.

          The game is best played in a live, round-table scenario, but
     it  is  not always easy to obtain seven experienced players,  who
     have several hours to participate.  Thus,  many other formats  of
     play have evolved (eg. E-mail, telephone, mail).

          The   main   feature  of  playing  Diplomacy  on  163/13  is
     convenience.  Players can login and receive  all  of  their  mail
     immeditely,  dwell  upon  the offers and suggestions of the other
     players,  then return comments at another time  when  convenient.
     Assuming  a  deadline  of once per week,  the average player will
     require 10 - 20 minutes per week per game  on  the  BBS  to  post
     messages  and to receive results from the previous week's orders.
     Add to this approx.  10-20 mins to determine  strategy.  Thus,  3
     sessions at 10 mins. each is all that is required.

          Other benefits derived from on-line play:

      1. Online help files of strategy
      2. Access to other players, and the sysop for advice
      3. No fees
      4. BBS operates 24 hrs/day - all year
      5. A competitive rating system
      6. Access to a N. A.  Diplomacy E-mail conference as coordinated
         by (124/109)

          There are  other  BBS's  who  host  Diplomacy.  If  you  are
     interested as either a sysop or player, I suggest you contact the

                 CORRECTION  -  Recent Articles on PC-Write

           John Herro, 1083 Mandarin Dr. NE, Palm Bay, FL  32905

     Are  you  wondering  why on earth FidoNews  4-32  (24  Aug  1987)
     reprinted  a review of PC-Write version 2.6,  when 2.7  with  its
     spelling checker has been out for some time now?

     The  review  must  have  be re-mailed  to  FidoNews  by  mistake.
     Recently  I  uploaded,  to a bulletin board that happens to be  a
     Fido node,  an archive containing two reviews of PC-Write.  These
     were my review of version 2.6  from FidoNews 3-30,  and my review
     of  version 2.7  from FidoNews 3-48.   The Sysop,  unpacking  the
     archive,  probably thought that I wanted these articles mailed to
     FidoNews now.  By the time you  read  this,  my review of version
     2.7 may also have been inadvertantly "reprinted" in FidoNews.

     Interestingly,  at the end of my review of 2.6, I  mentioned that
     PC-Write lacks two  features  found  on  some expensive word pro-
     cessors:  it  can't  handle  very large  files,  and  there's  no
     spelling checker.   We all know that a spelling checker was added
     in version 2.7.  The newsletter from Quicksoft says that  version
     3.0, now being written, will handle large files.

     Joaquim Homrighausen
     FrontDoor BBS (Opus 1:135/20)

                  The first INTERNATIONAL user conference

     After all these echo mail areas and debates I got very  tired  of
     the  simple  fact that there wasn't any REALLY INTERNATIONAL user
     conference.  And I feel that this is one of the  major  drawbacks
     with  the net today,  the lack of respect for other nations.  Not
     just BY the Americans,  not just FROM the Americans,  but from  a
     lot of other nations as well.

     So  what  I did was a very simple thing.  I established the first
     truly international user echo  mail  conference.  The  first  two
     nodes  to  be  included  in  this  were  1:135/20  (my  own)  and
     2:501/4607 (Mats Knuts, host of Sweden).  Then,  a couple of days
     ago ... some other sysops seemed to be noticing what was going on
     and requested the conference from me, and the heat was on.

     If  you want to be serious about carrying user echo mail,  please
     contact the INTERUSER Zone coordinators for more  information  on
     where  you  could  pick up this conference.  It's very simple ...
     keep the politics,  flames and general BULL out of there  and  we
     all got what we wanted in the first place.

     John Herro
     Fido 107/211

     NOTE:  This  article first appeared in FidoNews,  Vol. 3, No. 48,
     15 Dec., 1986.  The author  now  lives  at  1083 Mandarin Dr. NE,
     Palm Bay, FL  32905, and is a Staff Software Engineer for Grumman
     Aerospace.  He is no longer at Fido 107/211.


                  User's Review of PC-WRITE With Spelling

     (The author has no connection with Quicksoft,  the  producers  of
     PC-WRITE, except for being a registered user of that Shareware.)

     The  long-awaited  version  2.7 of the PC-WRITE word processor is
     out.  Since PC-WRITE is Shareware, you can download it and try it
     for free.  If you have an older version of PC-WRITE, it will def-
     initely be worth the time to download the latest  version.  Since
     I  recently reviewed version 2.6 in FidoNews 330,  I will discuss
     only new features here.

     The biggest new feature is the spelling  checker.  This  is  very
     handy not only for poor spellers, but for bad typists like me.

     I've  used three different spelling checkers from bulletin boards
     before, but none of them compares with the one built into version
     2.7 of PC-WRITE.  For one thing,  the PC-WRITE  spelling  checker
     handles  words divided by a hyphen at the end of a line,  and the
     other spellers I've tried do not.  I was tired of being told that
     "tion" is not a word.  Also, the dictionary resides in memory, so
     the checking is very fast.  Finally,  the  dictionary  is  large:
     50,000  words.  I'm impressed that the program manages to squeeze
     50K English words into fewer than 110K bytes of memory.

     Alternate-F2 brings up the spelling menu.  You can check spelling
     in three ways.  The program can check words  as  you  type  them,
     beeping at you like some of the newer typewriters.  You can check
     an entire document, or check only the word at the cursor.

     When  you  check  an entire document,  the program highlights the
     first unknown word.  You can ignore it, add it to a personal dic-
     tionary,  edit it,  or ask the program to guess the correct word.
     In  the  last  case,  I've found that some of the guesses seem to
     bear little relation to the word typed,  while other guesses  are
     very  useful.  After  you  select one of these four options,  the
     program highlights the next unknown word, etc.

     The  same  four options are available when you check  the  single
     word at the cursor, or when you ask PC-WRITE to beep whenever you
     type an unknown word.

     You can have as many personal dictionaries as you like,  but only
     one  can be in memory at a time,  along with the main 50,000-word
     dictionary.    The personal dictionaries are not compressed  like
     the main one.  A separate program is provided to merge a personal
     dictionary  with the main one,  producing a new main  dictionary.
     FidoNews 4-34                Page 13                   7 Sep 1987


     Dictionaries are lower case; the speller ignores capitalization.

     Working with a large dictionary in memory is a pleasure.   I  was
     surprised  that  the program  accepted  "Boise,"   "elaboration,"
     "esc,"  "Hoover," "identifier," "Qatar," and "Terre Haute."   The
     catch is that you can't use the speller if your computer has less
     than 320K of memory.

     There  are a few new features besides the spelling checker.   You
     can  now  define a single keystroke to insert  the  current  date
     and/or time in any format you like.   (Date first, spell the day,
     abbreviate the month,  two-digit year, 24-hour time,  etc.)   The
     help  file  is now loaded only when you need it,  giving  a  fast
     startup.   Word wrapping can be disabled without  disturbing  the
     right margin.   More printers are supported, including those with
     XON/XOFF  protocol.    Finally,  PC-WRITE can now "import"   text
     placed on the screen by another program.

     PC-WRITE now includes a pamphlet, ready for you to print out, ex-
     plaining the differences between versions 2.6  and 2.7.   This is
     in  addition to the familiar tutorial manual and quick  reference
     guide.

     If I may say so,  some of you FidoNews authors out there urgently
     NEED a spelling checker!  Version 2.7 of PC-WRITE can be found on
     Daniels-Fido  107/211,  (516) 367-9626,  300/1200/2400  baud.   I
     uploaded the program in two files, PCWRITE1.ARC and PCWRITE2.ARC.
     PLEASE download it and improve the appearance of FidoNews!!

     The following is the  text  of  my  message  titled  "Welcome  to
     FidoNet!"  that  was  sent  to  our  "Fellow  Sysops and Users in
     Poland" via the Zone 2 Coordinator Henk Wevers.




     As  IFNA's  (International  FidoNet  Association)  first  elected
     President,  it  gives  me  special  pleasure  as  one of my first
     official acts to extend  a  welcome  to  those  nodes  that  have
     recently begun operation in Poland.

     All  FidoNet  Sysops  the  world  over  are dedicated to the free
     exchange of information.  That is why we are all  so  pleased  to
     learn  of  the existence of FidoNet systems beyond the barrier we
     in the West refer to as "The Iron  Curtain".  We  hope  that  the
     future exchange of information,  ideas, and even feelings through
     FidoNet will be an aid to the removal of other barriers that have
     traditionally kept all of us from enjoying a world-wide peace and
     understanding.

     The other officers and members of IFNA join me in  welcoming  all
     of  you  to  FidoNet.  Many  of  us  here in America and in other
     countries  have  become  personal  friends  solely  through   our
     contacts   in   FidoNet.   We  look  forward  to  extending  such
     friendship to those of you who are joining our Network in Poland.

                                NEW PRODUCTS
          This month, I'm going to "cop out" to a degree, but I think
     you'll forgive me. With the amount of work to be done to prepare
     for our August 3 product announcement, there just isn't time to
     put together my usual newsletter information. Since the big news
     is our new products, I'm going to reprint our news release on
     these items, with a few comments (( in double parens )).

                       RADIO SHACK ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCTS ON
                         TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR FIRST
                                 PERSONAL COMPUTER
          NEW YORK, NY - In a "Nationwide Anniversary Celebration",
     today, personal computer pioneer Radio Shack unveiled four new
     and two upgraded PC-compatible Tandy computers, plus three new
     printers, giving the company the industry's most extensive line
     of personal computers.  The new computers are additions to
     Tandy's line. No existing models have been discontinued. Also
     introduced were two new cellular telephone models. The
     Waldorf-Astoria press conference was satellite-linked to Dallas,
     Texas and Anaheim, California, where more than 1600 Radio Shack
     managers were attending annual meetings of the company's business
     products and western consumer divisions. (( In attendance in New
     York were a number of industry chief executives including Paul
     Brainard of Aldus, Mark Eppley of Traveling Software, Ed Esber of
     Ashton-Tate, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Fred Gibbons of Software
     Publishing, Trip Hawkins with Electronic Arts, Roger Johnson from
     Western Digital, and Bill Krause and Bob Metcalf of 3-Com.
     Brainard, Gates and Krause spoke.))
          Tandy President, CEO, and Chairman John V. Roach expressed
     Tandy's commitment to product value, unique technologically
     innovative products, and providing compatibility with existing
     and future operating systems, user-interface and connectivity
     environments and applications software. He spoke of key strategic
     directions including simplification of computer use and a
     "building block" selection of system configuration options.
                              TANDY 4000 WITH 80386
          Stating, "The 80386 is now an affordable option for all
     users," Roach introduced the new Tandy 4000 personal computer.
     This 16Mhz, 80386-based PC, priced at $2,599, uses software based
     on the latest MS- DOS and UNIX operating systems, and is "OS/2
     ready" for future applications. The 4000 comes with one 3.5-inch
     1.44-megabyte (Mb) floppy disk drive. Two additional storage
     device slots let the buyer choose the options needed from a broad
     range of 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch floppies, hard disks, and
     internal cartridge or tape backup systems.
          Also included are nine expansion slots, 1Mb RAM (expandable
     to 16Mb), serial and parallel ports, and keylock. Currently-owned
     and widely available expansion options are supported through two
     "XT" and six "AT"-compatible slots.  One 32-bit slot is dedicated
     to memory expansion.
                          TANDY 3000 AND 3000 HL UPGRADED
          The popular 80286-based Tandy 3000 computer received a speed
     FidoNews 4-34                Page 16                   7 Sep 1987


     increase to 12 Mhz, a keylock/chassis locking system, and a lower
     price of $1,999. At $1,499, the lowest priced of Tandy's "OS/2
     Ready", 80286- based 3000 family is the Tandy 3000 HL computer.
     It now includes a 101- key enhanced keyboard, and keylock system.
     (( Although there is no longer officially a "3000 HD", our 1988
     catalog lists system prices for the 3000 and 3000 HL when
     purchased with a 20 or 40 Mb hard drive and controller.))
          Roach revealed reliability statistics (held in confidence by
     most manufacturers) for Tandy's 3000 family, which included a
     calculated Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of over 58,000 hours,
     and end user out-of- box failure rate of less than one percent.
                   DYNAMITE SOFTWARE AND NEW LOW-COST NETWORK !
          ((This is one you won't find reviewed in the monthly
     magazines... we kept a few things up our corporate sleeve when we
     previewed products to them.))
          Roach announced a new Professional DeskMate integrated
     software product scheduled for bundling with Tandy 3000 operating
     system options in the fourth quarter of this year. It will be
     available for other PC- compatible products as well. This new
     version of a Tandy-designed favorite uses pull-down menus, pop-up
     dialogue boxes, and features mouse, joystick or simple keyboard
     control. New and considerably enhanced features have been
     tailored specifically to office use.
          The most significant change is a utility called DeskLink
     which allows small workgroups to share a common calendar, phone
     directory, an electronic mail system, file transfers, and even
     share a printer. Connectivity options range from a simple RS-232
     cable for two users, to sophisticated networks such as the one
     Radio Shack offers from 3Com Corporation.
          Available along with the Professional DeskMate software will
     be a very low-cost network hardware interface called TandyLink.
     This "twisted-pair" system is ideal for connecting Professional
     DeskMate workgroups.  TandyLink is not only compatible with the
     AppleTalk network system but can run three times faster than
     their normal speed. (( Yes, this means using the proper
     third-party software such as TOPS from Centram, Macintosh and
     Tandy computers can network together.))
          Delivering on the company's promise to make networking
     simple ((and inexpensive)) enough for everyone, these products
     provide a "plug in and go" workgroup system, requiring no special
     training or expert user to install, implement and use.
                              PC-COMPATIBLE LAPTOP
          The company's entry into the PC-compatible laptop market,
     the new Tandy 1400 LT computer answers a common MS-DOS laptop
     complaint of short battery life by providing a unique, removable
     rechargeable battery pack. The $1,599 unit is based on a
     high-performance NEC V-20 microprocessor and features the latest
     high-contrast "backlit supertwist" liquid crystal display
     technology, two 3.5-inch 720-kilobyte (Kb) disk drives, and 768Kb
     memory. Additional standard features include 76-key keyboard,
     real time clock, parallel and serial ports, input socket for a
     101-key enhanced keyboard, and outputs for RGBI and composite
     video monitors. (( One visiting editor - who happens to be a
     laptop computer devotee - told me our screen is by far the best
     he has seen yet.))
                 TWO ADDITIONAL TANDY 1000 COMPUTERS PROVIDE SPEED,

                          NEW DIMENSION IN EASE OF USE
          Two additions to Tandy's best-selling 1000 family were
     shown. Operating at three times the speed of IBM's latest PS/2
     Model 30, and over six times the speed of the PC/XT, the new
     $1,199 Tandy 1000 TX computer brings 80286 speed to the PC/XT
     market. The TX comes with 640Kb memory, one 3.5-inch 720Kb floppy
     drive plus one open drive slot, joystick, serial and parallel
     ports, enhanced CGA graphics, three-voice sound, headphone jack
     and volume control, MS-DOS and GW-BASIC software, and a new
     enhanced version of Tandy's DeskMate 2 program. The Tandy 1000 TX
     computer offers unmatched speed and value in a low-cost,
     American- made brand name PC. ((One prominent industry analyst
     called the TX an "absolute killer machine."))
          The Tandy 1000 HX computer is a truly functional one-drive
     PC- compatible, designed to provide a new dimension in ease of
     use, without any sacrifice in performance. Tandy executives say
     the $699 HX's unique features represent more technology per
     dollar than any other MS-DOS computer can claim. The MS-DOS
     operating system is contained in read only memory (ROM),
     eliminating the need for an ever-present MS-DOS disk.
          The HX also features an Electrically Erasable Programmable
     (by the user) Read Only Memory (EEPROM), which stores system
     configuration and user-selected start-up information, for "Power
     and Run" operation. The user can specify processor speed, an
     external drive as the primary drive, immediate power-on execution
     of the Personal DeskMate 2 program, a utility menu, or a selected
     application program (in lieu of DOS). A user never has to see the
     MS-DOS "A>" prompt or worry with switch- selected configuration
     options.
          Students can insert a program disk, turn the power on, and
     see their lesson on-screen with no intermediate steps... a unique
     capability available in no other personal computer system.
          Supplied with one 3.5-inch 720Kb drive, the HX will accept a
     second 3.5-inch internal drive, and an external 5.25-inch drive.
     Standard memory is 256Kb, expandable to 640Kb.
          Portions of Personal DeskMate 2 are included in ROM for fast
     operation. The HX also includes printer and joystick ports,
     three-voice sound, headphone jack and volume control, plus
     enhanced CGA graphics.
                       80286 UPGRADE FOR 1000 & 1000 SX
          Citing Tandy's commitment to superior value, Roach announced
     a move rarely seen in the PC industry - a technology upgrade for
     existing products. Owners of existing Tandy 1000 and 1000 SX
     computers will be offered an accessory 80286 board which replaces
     their original 8088 processor for faster performance.
                             PERSONAL DESKMATE IMPROVED
          Enhanced Personal DeskMate 2 software is included with the
     Tandy 1000 TX and 1000 HX personal computers. Especially when
     used with a mouse, it brings a graphics-oriented user interface -
     rivaling the best available today, yet in color - to low-cost PC
     compatible computers. This multi-function software product takes
     advantage of the 1000 family's "enhanced" CGA graphics.
     Simplified keyboard control of pull- down menus and pop-up
     dialogue boxes has been added, along with a music composition
     program. Also, "Paint" is expanded from four to 16 colors. Cursor
     control options include mouse, joystick, or keyboard.

                            NEW LASER PRINTER ANNOUNCED
          To fully implement low-cost desktop publishing based on
     Tandy's 3000 family and new 4000, the company introduced the LP
     1000, a $2,199 laser printer. The unit features full-page (1.5Mb)
     memory and on-board controller, and produces six pages per minute
     in Tandy, IBM, and HP LaserJet Plus-compatible modes, with 300 x
     300 dot-per-inch resolution.
                               NEW DOT-MATRIX PRINTERS
          Two new dot-matrix printers were shown. The DMP 2120 is a
     $1,599, PC-compatible, 240 character per second letter-quality
     printer with color ribbon option. A 24-wire print head can
     produce a variety of internal or downloaded fonts. A push-type
     "zero tear" tractor is supplied.
          The DMP 440 is a 300 character per second, PC-compatible
     nine-wire 132-column printer, selling for $699. It also accepts
     downloaded fonts in addition to those supplied.
                   NEW CELLULAR PHONES INCLUDE HAND-HELD PORTABLE
          Included in the announcement were two new Radio Shack
     cellular telephones, giving the company three versatile models.
          The CT-300 portable cellular telephone is an ultra-small,
     battery- powered, hand-held unit no larger than many cordless
     phones.   Advanced features include 40-number memory, one-button
     re-dial, dial lock, and lighted LCD multi-function display. The
     CT-300 is supplied with built-in rechargeable battery pack,
     portable antenna, carrying case and strap, for $1,499.
          The new CT-100 phone is a low-cost, feature-rich mobile unit
     delivering full 3-watt performance. Complete with handset,
     speaker and visor microphone, the CT-100 retails for $799.
          An improved version of Radio Shack's popular 3-watt
     Transportable Cellular Telephone (mobile mount or
     battery-operated portable) continues at $1,199. (Portable adapter
     and batteries optional).
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
          So there you have the news. All of the products are detailed
     in our new 124-page 1988 Tandy Computer Catalog & Software
     Reference Guide.  It should be showing up in your neighborhood
     stores within the next few days. I think you'll be as excited as
     we are about the line.  You'll also see "first looks" in most of
     the major computer trade journals over the next couple of months.
          There is plenty to see in the new catalog.  For example,
     there's a 40-Mb internal tape cartridge (backup) system, selling
     for only $699. Most tape systems are pre-configured to either XT
     or AT formats, and are not interchangeable.  Ours works with
     either. I don't want to spoil your fun, so that's the only
     additional "teaser" I'll give you.
          Yes, this was an MS-DOS announcement.  No, there wasn't
     another version of the CoCo, Model 4D or 6000, but those products
     continue in our 1988 catalog. The only computer not listed in
     this one is the Tandy 2000. See you next month...

     From: Robert Heller, SysOp of Locks Hill BBS 321/148

                   FidoNet Node ID's: Names or Numbers?

     1. Introduction.

         Although I am new to FidoNet, I have had some experience
     using other network mail systems (including local DECNet and
     ARPANet (by way of CSNet)).   The big machine mail networks use
     names for nodes at the user level - that is users don't need to
     know the network address numbers for the nodes they send mail to,
     all that is handled by the mailer software at one level or
     another.  It seems to me that FidoNet has gotten big enough to
     also move in this direction.  I don't mean that we should
     eleminate the nodelist and the node numbers, just to phase out
     the use of raw network node numbers as part of user-visible mail
     headers.

     2. Motivation.

         The motivation for going to a named node identification at
     the user level is to help users in understanding the network
     address.  It is usually easier to remember someone (and to refer
     to someone) by name rather than by say a telephone number or a
     zip-code.  The translation from a person's name to their
     telephone number (needed to call them on the phone) is done with
     a telephone directory.  The same can be done with FidoNet node
     names.  We already have the directory - the nodelist itself! With
     named-node addressing at the BBS level users can refer to netmail
     destinations by *name* rather than by network node id numbers.

     3. Proposed Syntax

         Since there are alot of nodes (more than 2100), we will
     probably still need a multi-part addressing scheme.  I propose
     the following syntax (which is much like what is used on
     ARPANet):

            user-name @ point-name.node-name.net-name.zone-name

     with the provision that trailing parts can be dropped when they
     are the same as the parts in the local nodes address.  That means
     that nodes in the same network only need specify the point and
     node names. Point names can also be dropped if the destination is
     a node rather than a point. For example:

          Robert Heller @ Locks Hill BBS.MassNet West.USA Canada

     is the same as

                         Robert Heller @ 1:321/148

     (There are no points under Locks Hill BBS.)

     The ".USA Canada" part can be dropped if sent from a node in zone
     1 and ".MassNet West.USA Canada" can be dropped if sent from
     FidoNews 4-34                Page 21                   7 Sep 1987


     another node in network 321 (MassNet West).

     4. Conclusion

         This scheme can be implemented in future versions of BBS
     programs. It could even be implemented without changing the
     format of message files as they exist on disk.  Fido (or Opus,
     etc.) would simply display the message header with names
     replacing network and node numbers and users entering netmail
     would just enter network and node names, which would be
     translated by the BBS software to *internal* network numbers.
     Users would never see network or node numbers.  The numbers would
     still exist, since they are needed to resolve routing and in cost
     accounting and in the mail packets.  That is, the software
     involved in transporting the mail message would use numbers and
     users would only see names, with the BBS software performing the
     translatation interface.

         This is just a idea of mine that I am tossing out to the
     readership of FidoNews.  If you have comments on this idea send
     me netmail.  Or write a counter-proposal. I am not commited to
     the syntax I proposed.  Other syntaxes are certainly posible.

                    Making File Requests using Fido<tm>
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Opus-Cbcs  v1.03  allows  WaZOO  File  Requests  from   non-WaZOO
     systems.

     For example,  if you run a Fido<tm> system, you can now make file
     requests to an Opus system.  Naturally,  this  assumes  the  Opus
     sysop supports file requests.

     This  file  describes  the  method for making file requests to an
     Opus-Cbcs v1.03+ system.  It can be used by any  netmail  program
     capable of sending/receiving "file attaches".

     It  really is simpler than it looks.  In a nutshell,  you build a
     text file that lists all the files you want.  Then you send  that
     file to the Opus system using the "file attach" mechanism of your
     netmail  software,  and  Opus  will  send  back the files.  There
     really is nothing more  complicated  than  that...  nevertheless,
     here are some step-by-step instructions in agonizing detail:

           1. Create a file called `aaaabbbb.REQ'.

                  `aaaa' is a 4-digit hex number that is the net
                         of the Opus system you are calling.

                  `bbbb' is a 4-digit hex number that is the node
                         of the Opus system you are calling.

           EXAMPLES:

                   00010002.REQ ... a WaZOO request for 1/2.
                   038493e8.REQ ... a WaZOO request for 900/1000.

           2. Use a text editor to list the files you are
              requesting. Put one file name to a line, and end the
     FidoNews 4-34                Page 23                   7 Sep 1987


              line with a <cr> or <cr/lf>. The file name should NOT
              contain a drive or path. You can use wildcards in the
              .REQ file.

              The .REQ file is a garden-variety text file. You can
              create it with any text editor that produces plain
              ASCII files.

           3. Transmit the file to the Opus system like you would
              any other `file attach'.

           4. When the session turns around (ie. when Opus starts
              transmitting to you), it will send any files you have
              requested which are available for transmission.

              NOTE 1: There are two reserved file names. The Opus
                      sysop has to support them, but most do. These
                      two file names are special signals to Opus,
                      and the name of the file you actually receive
                      will be called whatever the Opus sysop wants
                      to call them.

                        ABOUT ... If you request the file "About"
                                  you will probably get a short
                                  summary of the Opus system. You
                                  will also get the file designated
                                  as the Opus system's ABOUT file
                                  if the Opus system can't fulfill
                                  one of your requests.

                        FILES ... If you request the file "Files"
                                  you will probably get a listing
                                  of the files available to file
                                  requests.

              NOTE 2: Some files may be password protected. If
                      that's the case for the file you want, put
                      the password behind a bang character on the
                      same line as the file name in the .REQ file.
                      Like this:

                                filename !pswrd

                      That's the file name followed by a single
                      space, followed by a bang ("!") followed by
                      the password followed by a <cr>.  A password
                      has six or fewer characters.


     NOTES
     -----

     * If your software requires it, don't forget to enable PICKUP.

     * This only works if you initiate the call. If the Opus system
       is calling you, you cannot make a file request. In other
     FidoNews 4-34                Page 24                   7 Sep 1987


       words, the whole thing has to be on your nickle.

     * If there is some kind of fatal transmission trouble while
       you are receiving the requested file(s), just call back with
       a "poll." Assuming the .REQ file made it okay, the Opus
       system will remember what files you have requested.  You
       should not send the .REQ file more than once... unless
       you want two copies of everything.

     * There is a utility available that will do the file-attach for
       you, with a proper .REQ file. it is called WZ_SRC.ARC and is
       available from 124/111, 161/1, and 150/1 (as well as other
       places I don't know about.)

                          WaZOO is a collection of protocols.
                          Right now, Opus supports two WaZOO

                          an Opus sysop, he/she will probably refer
                          to the file request method described here
                          as "DietIfna WaZOO File Request."

              ZedZap..... The WaZOO protocol used most of the time.

                     Issue #1: Echomail and PC-Pursuit
                         Aaron Priven (1:161/1154)


        _Origin:  Angevin Empire_ commences as a  semi-regular  column
     (semi-regular means that I'll try to write it on schedule, but no
     promises) in this issue of FidoNews.

        Usually,  with the start of a work of this sort,  the whys and
     wherefores of  the  work  are  found,  and  submitted  to  public
     display.  Sadly, I feel this cannot be the case with this column.
     In  looking  for  a  good,  logical  reason to write a column for
     FidoNews,  nothing seems to fit.  I would like  to  entertain;  I
     hope  to  make  people  laugh;  and  I  wish  to  be informative.
     Nevertheless,  I cannot  promise  to  be  any  of  these  things.
     Further,  I  cannot  delude myself that my view is more important
     than,  or has special qualities not found in  the  viewpoints  of
     others.  And  I  cannot believe that I am the only one who wishes
     to write.  So I leave you without a reason.  I hope despite  this
     that you find a purpose in my work.

        _Origin:  Angevin  Empire_ has no one particular subject.  The
     first few columns have already been written,  and are  about  the
     Matrix, but that doesn't mean that a column down the way won't be
     about  the  shapes  of  floppy disks,  or my high school,  or the
     vicissitudes of file cabinet manufacture.

        In any case,  I do hope you  enjoy  reading  _Origin:  Angevin
     Empire_, and please, help me to write better columns by giving me
     feedback.  In  many  of  my  columns  (including this one) I will
     write about ideas I have had, and in all probablility many of the
     ideas expressed will be infeasible or simply dumb; please, always
     feel free to tell me in fine language just how dumb they are.

                                  -------

        Do you all remember the commercials for "Reese's Peanut Butter
     Cups," in which chocolate  lovers  and  peanut  lovers  put  them
     together  and  find  that they're better than they were apart?  I
     hope I can be in the position of catalyzing  the  combination  of
     PC-Pursuit and echomail.

        I  was  reading a bunch of PC-Pursuit ads I found on a BBS the
     other day,  when I started to think about how all my local sysops
     are  routing  things through PC-Pursuit for echomail.  I suddenly
     realized that there was a lot of routing  going  on  that  wasn't
     really necessary.

        Take  a  theoretical  example.  A  local  node routes echomail
     through PC-Pursuit to a nearby city (call  it  Aarongrad);  tolls
     FidoNews 4-34                Page 27                   7 Sep 1987


     are  $0.08/minute.  He  gets PC-Pursuit and routes for free -- to
     Aarongrad.  Aarongrad routes through Bell lines to Fidoville, who
     routes through PC-Pursuit to Opus City.  Opus City routes through
     PC-Pursuit to Seadogtown, on BOC lines to Compaqia, on PC-Pursuit
     to La Computadora ...  It's a long, long chain.

        The problem with the long chain is, of course, that it takes a
     week to get from our "local node" to  "Nomansland".  Now  I  know
     that  this isn't entirely the case -- we have backbones and other
     such things that make it faster.  But nevertheless,  one hears of
     the "10-day limit".  That's too long! And in the main, the reason
     for  this  is because PC-Pursuit is not being used to its fullest
     advantage.

        It seems to me that there is a good alternative  to  the  long
     chain,  using  PC-Pursuit.  A  new  unit  in  the Matrix could be
     introduced:  the Echomail  Distribution  Center.  There  probably
     should be one per echomail conference,  although this is not cast
     in stone; the point is that there would be a _lot_ of traffic. An
     EDC would be:  a Matrix node,  that can both make and receive PC-
     Pursuit  calls,  that  is set up to talk to _all_ PC-Pursuit-able
     nodes  carrying  the  conferences  that  the  EDC  supports.  The
     following would be done by the EDC:

           Keep track of all nodes carrying the conference;
           Make outbound calls to _all_ PC-Pursuitable nodes
        carrying the conference; and
           Accept inbound calls from any nodes carrying the
        conference.

        This  way,  any node either in a PC-Pursuit city,  or who uses
     PC-Pursuit themselves, will have the fastest turnaround possible.

        And to carry a conference, all one has to do is send a netmail
     message to the EDC;  no routing (or weekly pleas  in  SYSOP),  no
     worrying, no hassles.

        In many areas,  even those without PC-Pursuit and outside of a
     PC-Pursuit area will  have  their  service  improved;  more  than
     likely  those  people  get or can get their feeds from PC-Pursuit
     subscribers,  and thus will have if not one-day turnaround,  two-
     or  three-day  turnaround.  In any case there is nothing stopping
     them from continuing their current routing.

        There are some drawbacks to this plan.  Mainly,  PC-Pursuit is
     not  always  "up" and is rather slow.  This is something that has
     already been evidenced;  my local  node  routes  things  via  PC-
     Pursuit and was without TECH, COMM, and ECPROG for quite a while.
     This  will  happen  only  rarely,  however,  and I think will not
     affect the conference all that much; PC-Pursuit is up most of the
     time.  As for slowness, that is largely solved by more up-to-date
     transfer protocols and I think will  not  be  a  problem  in  the
     future. Another drawback is that it isn't possible to extend this
     system internationally; still, it doesn't hurt the overseas nodes
     to have fast US service.

     FidoNews 4-34                Page 28                   7 Sep 1987


        There  is also the fact that for a large conference like TECH,
     it takes a lot of time and disk space to process all  that  mail.
     If  necessary,  there  could  be  two or three EDC's for a single
     conference;  odd-numbered nodes call EDC  #1,  and  even-numbered
     nodes  call  EDC  #2.  The good thing about this plan is that the
     EDC's do not have to be shared geographically,  making two  EDC's
     in  the  same city just as valuable as one in New York and one in
     Los Angeles.

        Finally,  there is the $5 packet/switched network charge  that
     may  come forth in January.  I can only reply that if we all try,
     and write letters, it may not happen; and we can always go back.

        Apologies to all who may have thought of this idea first,  and
     of whom I have not heard (which I'm sure is a lot!)

       (This  was  written  about  a month ago,  and since then I have
     learned more about how  much  traffic  an  Echomail  area  really
     entails;  and more about the "backbone".  I don't now believe one
     EDC per conference is really viable  for  any  but  the  smallest
     conferences.  Nevertheless,  the  major  idea  of  the  column --
     geographic irrelevance -- still stands.)
