========================================================================
   Just one article this week ... a diatribe on the "shareware
ethic" and shareware, submited as a policy complaint.  I am not
against rants.  That, perhaps, is what the *snooze* is for.
Policy complaints are to resolve technical problems.

   The entire *C structure was never designed to replace the
contract law courts of the various countries that fidonet runs
in.  It was not designed to govern social structures, or ensure
that people could speak to each other like adults.  It was
designed because we needed a telephone book, and so needed
someone in each net to collect the phone numbers.

   Expecting, or allowing the *C structure to start to "rule"
the members of fidonet on matters of law and social status is

WildCat! Sysops - WCEdit Registration Ain't Worth The Trouble

by Timothy Trace @ 1:100/440.0
The Shareware Ethic Is Being Abused By Joe Lemoine @ 1:390/3.0

What is The Shareware Ethic?  For most purposes, it's rather simple.
An author releases a shareware program with the understood intention
that interested users will honorably pay for it.  In return for their
$$$, the registered users understand that they're paid in full to reap
the benefits of shareware as compared to commercially developed
software.  Summed up briefly, those benefits are: timely, inexpensive
registration; quick technical support and direct contact with the
author; and frequent version updates.

Joe Lemoine @ 1:390/3.0 is a shareware author who has lost sight of
The Shareware Ethic.  He's the owner of a couple of utilities for the
WildCat! BBS, PostMaster and WCEdit.  PM is a message-importation
utility that Joe purchased from it's original author (Dave Cody).
WCEdit is a convienence sysop's mail-reader that Joe authored himself.

After using WCEdit for its trial period of a month, I decided to
purchase it.  Of course, I had a few questions about WCEdit and I
attempted to contact Joe multiple times via the Fido WildCat! support
echoes, the WildCat! SupportNet echoes, routed _and_ crashed netmail,
and in sysop comments and public messages on Joe's NDE BBS in
Folsum, LA.  After receiving no responses for over six weeks, I
entered the credit-card registration door on Joe's BBS and registered
WCEdit at a cost of $35, hoping that Joe *might* give a higher
priority to Q&A from registered users.

Apparently I was wrong.  Joe's lost sight of The Shareware Ethic.

He has, for all intents, dissapeared from society.  I've had an
on-line registration for his WCEdit pending for over a six weeks
with no results. This evening I canceled that registration request
after leaving him a final demand for attention in a sysop comment
on his BBS over a week ago.

There are, at minimum, several other WC! sysops experiencing the same
problem. Most of them have posted statements of dissatisfaction on
Joe's BBS and in this and other WildCat!-related forum.  Evidently
we're not experiencing isolated incidents or temporary problems.
Many attempts (both pleasantly worded and not so) at contacting Joe
via sysop comments on his BBS, Fidonet and WSNet echomail, and
routed and crashmailed netmail have gone ignored for over three
months.  Yet, Joe's around - as the day-to-day existence of his
BBS corroborates.

IMHO, Joe has flattened his interpretation of The Shareware Ethic
into such a one-sided, profit-driven plane that he deserves none of
the financial reward due a shareware author.  If you have funds tied
FidoNews 13-01                 Page:  3                    01 Jan 1996

up in an unfulfilled registration of one of Joe's products, I
recommend that you cancel it immediately, without reservation.  If you
have registered either program believing that some manner of support
was included in your registration fee, and have received your key, I
recommend that you contact Joe via netmail and request a complete
refund based on his lack of timely support to registered users.
Remember, we're talking about a three-month span of time here, not
just a few days or weeks.

:-(

I've brought a three-sided Policy Complaint against Joe; all of the
reasoning is simple.  If registration and/or product support doesn't
exist, then Joe is falsely representing his product by listing his
Fidonet node number as a contact point in the WCEdit documentation.
The Fidonet nodelist shouldn't be used to give an illusion of
credibility solely for the purpose of an individual's financial gain.
By trivializing his Fidonet affiliation in this manner, Joe is being
excessively annoying.

Also of issue in the Policy Complaint is Joe's lack of common
courtesy.  For no good reason at all, Joe has held credit card
registrations in limbo for months, forcing many of his sincere, paying
customers to carry over unfulfilled expenses in their month-to-month
bookkeeping.  Joe is being excessively annoying in his lack of
courtesy to paying customers (many of which expect to be able to
contact him via Fidonet).

Lastly, the subject of financial security in online situations is
tired, but it's one that Fidonet has managed to steer clear of for
some time.  Joe's being excessively annoying by putting that good
reputation at risk by behaving in an irresponsible manner where
credit cards are concerned.

My Policy Complaint asks that Joe be issued a cease-and-desist order
for listing his Fidonet address as a contact point in his programs'
documentation.  If he doesn't respond positively and hastefully to
that request, I've asked that he be punitively cut from the nodelist.

Thanks for your time - and if you're a Shareware Author, please
remember Joe's Lemoine's abuse of The Shareware Ethic - and never
forget that there are real people on the other end of those
registration dollars.
