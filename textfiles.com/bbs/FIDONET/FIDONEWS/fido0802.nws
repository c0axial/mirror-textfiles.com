     [After I wrote this, I called a close friend and read it to him.
     He suggested to me that printing this would most likely cause a
     flood of articles that have nothing to do with FidoNet to appear
     on my doorstep. Perhaps. But frankly, my dear, I don't give a
     Saddam. I feel that something needs to be said. NOW.]

     I was just barely young enough to avoid Vietnam. In fact, I was
     part of the last crop of young men to even face a draft lottery
     in the United States. My number was 361. Fairly lucky, by the
     standards of the day.

     Today, I am just barely too old to even enlist in the American
     armed services. Not that I am in such a hurry to do so. I am
     overweight, lazy and overpaid -- and in no mood for a 180 degree
     change in my lifestyle.

     Yup, I'm your prototypical worthless, self-centered American.
     Many non-Americans seem to think that all Americans are just
     like me. And that our excessive zeal to protect every individual
     from harm and to go the extra mile to avoid bloodshed is proof
     that Americans are too soft and weak to face tough decisions.

     The problem with these characterizations is, as usual, a matter
     of lack of understanding.

     You see, I am a product of a culture that encourages people to do
     whatever they do best because at the end of the day, everything
     will get done --- and done better --- that way. This system has
     made the United States a great power in this world, more so than
     nations with greater landmass and/or population. So there. The
     fact that I don't want to be a soldier, and that this is
     considered an acceptable attitude, isn't a weakness in our
     system, it represents its greatest strength.

     Perhaps Americans are too careful to avoid bloodshed. But why
     should anyone be careless with the lives of others? The cavalier
     attitude of many people towards their own compatriots is not a
     sign of strength, it is one of stupidity. Just as our attitude
     is not a sign of weakness. There are more than sufficient cases
     in the history of the United States, both recent and past, to
     suggest otherwise.

     All of that having been said -- I don't understand a few things.

     I don't understand why the leadership of Israel is unable to walk
     a mile in the shoes of Palestinians, recognize the parallels to
     their own experience, and find a way to address their legitimate
     security concerns while also finally putting that issue to rest.

     I don't understand why the entire international community was so
     willing to look the other way for so long while Saddam Hussein
     was running his number against Iranians and Kurds. Why they sold
     him everything he needed to build these awful weapons they now
     decry. Why the United States ambassador in effect told him it
     was OK with us if he violated the Kuwaiti borders. Why it
     suddenly became a new Holocaust once Kuwait was conquered and
     the Iraqis behaved in the same cruel and inhuman manner that had
     characterized their handling of their internal Kurd rebellion
     and the Iran-Iraq war.

     I don't understand why Saddam Hussein wants to rule the entire
     Arab world. Besides controlling the price of over half the
     proven oil reserves worldwide, I can't think of a reason why.
     Unless he likes big sandboxes and has an affinity for camels. (I
     DO think I understand why he invaded Kuwait. What a neat way to
     cancel your debts!)

     I don't understand why the United States is committing so many
     resources to stopping this man while many nations with much
     better cash flow situations, and arguably a higher stake in
     seeing him stopped, are sitting it out. Japan bought MCA with
     the amount of money the United States is spending every six
     weeks just protecting THEIR oil supply. But the amount of money
     they have promised in support of the embargo is a very small
     percentage of that figure, and almost none of THAT money has yet
     to leave the coffers of our great ally. Germany has been real
     forthcoming too.  I think that "Fahrvergnugen" must mean
     something like "let the other guy get knocked on the head, I'm
     outta here." Will the U.S. ultimately sell Paramount to Japan in
     order to be able to afford to protect Japanese interests?  Will
     we sell AT&T to Germany so we have the wherewithal to ensure
     sufficient gasoline for their no-speed-limit Autobahns? Are we
     out of our ever-loving MINDS?

     I don't understand why President Bush decided to make war so
     close to inevitable. I think his November 8 move to increase the
     American presence in Saudi Arabia was exactly the wrong move.
     That a policy of increasing the percentage of non American
     personnel, particularly Arabs, while keeping the total strength
     at a level sufficient to deter aggression against Saudi Arabia,
     could have ultimately led to some kind of solution.  There are
     lots of little Arabs who have access to Saddam and could have
     made themselves slightly bigger Arabs by leading us to a
     solution. Now it's probably too late. I wish the American
     soldiers all the best. I hope that they are able to accomplish
     whatever mission they are finally given without too many losses
     on either side.

     I don't understand why Gorbachev is recreating Hungary '56 and
     Czechoslovakia '68 in Lithuania. Is this the guy whose government
     has been saying such bad things about Stalin and Brezhnev? The
     winner of the Nobel Peace Prize? I shudder to think who might
     have come in second (nahhh! Not Saddam!)

     I don't understand Communist China. Period.

     I don't understand why so many people must die to end war. Is
     it possible that all people must die to end war? I sure hope not.

     That way lies madness.

     ABOUT COMPUTERS, FREEDOM & PRIVACY
     ----------------------------------

     We are at a crossroads as individuals, organizations and
     governments depend more and more on computers and computer
     networks. Within ten years, most global information will be
     collected and utilized electronically. The 1990's are the pivotal
     decade in which statutes, policies and judicial precedents will
     be developed for controlling access, use -- and abuse -- of
     computerized information and electronic mail.

     FidoNews 8-02                Page 5                   14 Jan 1991


     Current government and private-sector policies are an
     uncoordinated jumble, created as each group evolves ways to
     collect, manipulate, extract, share and protect computerized and
     networked information and services.

     Data on individuals and groups is being computerized by numerous
     agencies, organizations and special interests, often without the
     knowledge or approval of those it concerns, and with varying
     degrees of accuracy.

     Computers can greatly assist individuals, organizations and
     government in making sound decisions based on efficient access to
     adequate information -- for personal benefit, business
     improvement and national well-being.

     Or, inappropriate use and regulation can seriously threaten
     fundamental freedoms, personal privacy, and the democratic
     processes that are at the very foundation of this nation and of
     any free society.

     contact and, if they wish, announce topics they would like to
     discuss, one on one.


     ABOUT THIS PREMIER EVENT
     ------------------------

     This is an intensive, multi-disciplinary survey Conference for
     those concerned with computing, teleconferencing, electronic
     mail, computerized personal information, direct marketing
     information, government data, etc. -- and those concerned with
     computer-related legislation, regulation, computer security, law
     enforcement and national and international policies that impact
     civil liberties, responsible exercise of freedom and equitable
     protection of privacy in this global Information Age.

     For the first time, this four-day invitational event will bring
     together representatives from all of these groups and more, all
     in one place, all at one time.

     Many of the recognized leaders and strongest advocates
     representing the various groups having an interest in the issues
     of the conference will discuss their concerns and proposals.

     A maximum of 600 applicants will be invited to attend. Balanced
     representation from the diverse groups interested in these issues
     is being encouraged. Please see the enclosed Invitation
     Application for details.

     To inform participants about topics beyond their specialties,
     half-day seminars are scheduled for the first day (Monday, March
     25th). These parallel tutorials will explore relevant issues in
     computing, networking, civil liberties, regulation, the law and
     law enforcement. Each tutorial is designed for those who are
     experienced in one area, but are less knowledgeable in the
     subject of that tutorial.

     To explore the interactions and ramifications of the issues,
     conference talks and panel discussions are scheduled for the
     remaining three days (Tuesday-Thursday, March 26th-28th). These
     will emphasize balanced representation of all major views,
     especially including probing questions and discussion.

     Explicit Conference events to foster communication across
     disciplines are planned. Working luncheons, major breaks and two
     evening banquets will further encourage individual and small
     group discussions.

                    Is There Interest in a FORTRAN Echo?

     For the past  year  I've browsing through the various Programming
     Echos to learn the gimmicks of  the  various  languages  we  use.
     I've found echos for C, PASCAL, and BASIC, just  to  name  a few.
     What appears to  be  missing  is  the  grandaddy  of  them all; I
     haven't found a single echo for FORTRAN.

     Consider this a sort of lonely  hearts'  club  search.   What I'm
     asking you to do, is ask YOUR users if there is  an  interest  in
     starting a national FORTRAN echo.

     Please don't think  that  I'm  trying  to  sell  you  the Fortran
     language.  What I am pushing for  is  a  echo  for programmers to
     communicate.  In the late 1940's and early 1950's,  a  need arose
     for a high  level  language  which  would  allow  scientists  and
     engineers to code mathematical procedures.   Prior to this point,
     one had to learn assembly to access that new-fangled  contraption
     (the electronic digital computer).  What caught on was Fortran.

     Current estimates indicate  that  some  60  percent of scientific
     software is still in Fortran.  I'm  talking major mainframes. The
     software has to maintained, and periodically ported  over  to new
     machines.  There are  four major companies that produce compilers
     for the PC family of computers  right  now.   I  think there is a
     need for a meeting place.

     Please ask your  users if they're interested.   I'd  sure  prefer
     visiting my favorite  BBS for a Fortran question, than paying $$$
     to visit the Microsoft Forum on CompuServe.

     Please address all  replies to Fred  Niemczenia  at  1:371/7  via
     Netmail, or EMAIL at CompuServe 76606,2060.

     SEEKING HEALTHCARE BBS/ECHO INFORMATION

     The PC Physician Medical Computing Resource Guide, a disk-based
     electronic publication, is seeking information about healthcare-
     oriented BBS, echos, news groups, discussion groups, and other
     electronic publications for its second edition, scheduled for
     release in March of this year.  For more information, contact:

     The MCRG is inexpensive commercial software ($15 postpaid) which
     is not copy protected, but which is produced under a license to
     a software company which does not currently allow distribution as
     a BBS file.  The information MCRG compiles about BBS/echos/news
     groups/discussions/publications will, however, be distributed as
     a text file as well as part of the MCRG second edition.  Interested
     individuals should contact Jerry McCarthy for a complementary copy
     of MCRG.
