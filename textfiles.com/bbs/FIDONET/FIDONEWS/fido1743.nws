     Well folks, your editor is scratching his ol' noggin to figure out how
     to handle some of the requests that come across his desk. I have had a
     rush of letters that request to be considered as articles, some sent
     by other than the original author. I personally prefer to have
     articles submitted by the original author, else the original author
     may have a right to contest what is printed as having been edited by
     the submitter, or myself for that matter.  And so my decision is NOT
     to accept articles from others for publishing, until I have received
     permission from the author by netmail or email. Only original letters
     and articles please.

             News Flash just came in tonight:
     Dave Moufarrge Z1C has announced his stepping down from that position.
     -------------Letter from Dave----------------------------------------

     Ladies and Gentlemen, Due to continued issues in my real life, some
     good - some not so good, and the associated drain on my time, I am no
     longer able to hold the Z1C position in good conscience.

     It is my intention to surrender the position

     * By 1/5/2001, or * By the time the RCC can organize and complete a
     general election for the ZC position, whichever comes earlier.

     I have been contemplating this decision for quite some time and find
     that this is the best for my family, myself, and Fidonet. At this
     point I do intend to retain my node number, though I will likely be
     IP-only. I will start transitioning Zonegate responsibilities in the
     next couple of weeks. Suggestions are welcome.

     This message will be cross-posted into Z1C, Z1REGCON and other
     appropriate echoes.

     Thanks for your support and hard work.

     David, we will all miss you, and we thank you for your many
     accomplishments for FidoNet over the years. We sincerely hope you and
     your family soon find peace and happiness.  We are thankful that you
     will retain your node number and will be working together again soon.

     To continue: On another note. I have had indirect hints about what is
     "acceptable" to publish in the Snooze. What topics are off topic. I
     have pondered this for some days now. I found the answer in the

     Fidonews.Ban text of Makenews. "Newspapers should have no friends"
     ---Joseph Pulitzer  I take this to mean that all news, in columns,
     articles, items, etc. are to be free of the hands that would limit or
     exaggerate the thoughts of the authors. To simply take the Middle road
     without consideration of the High road or the Other road to get to the
     truth would be denying ourselves the whole picture from which to draw
     a conclusion. That said, your items submitted with request for
     publication will be if they are proper in language and format, and
     merit the readers time in general. I know it will not be easy to
     please everyone all of the time. I am not worried about that aspect,
     or reprisals in some form , as I am only Pro-Tem Ed at this time.

     I have yet to see one single sysop that supports David's intention to
     remove R14 and merge the nets into one or more other regions. I have
     seen protests, many of them from Fido folks I respect.

     What I want to see now is the reconciliation between policy and
     principles.

     Will sysops in groups or as individuals be willing to sell out their
     support of the R14 sysops for the price of not having to admit that
     unaccountable authority is not a good thing?

     Seems to me that you could, in essence, step aside now and allow
     Jim Cannell to "rebuild" ya'll's region (being as how he's been
     "tasked" with that job by our great leader), then run for the RC
     hat in the election Jim would be required (by ya'll) to hold.
     Methinks you'd be a shoe-in.

     At this point, I think that we can all agree that the important task

     Thanks for the out.  However, I have been appointed to do a job, and
     will continue to do it to the best of my ability.

     The best help that I can give you right now is to get R14 reconnected,
     and get an accurate R14 nodelist segment into the nodelist.  After the
     region is again connected, we can get input from the *entire* region
     to determine the course that the region sysops wish to take.  No
     merger is going to happen until everyone in the region has a chance to
     speak up.

     Please send me an updated segment for your net.  I'll get it into the
     nodelist. This applies to all Region 14 NCs.

     The R14 issue is the number one topic of discussion among the RCC
     right now. With your (and other R14 sysops) help, we'll make sure that
     it gets resolved in the best interests of R14 and the rest of FidoNet.

                             Part II

     The Allfix's Asetup main screen leads you to different manager menus
     for each manager, such as node manager, file echo manager, and group
     manager, etc.  In each of these managers, you enter information for
     that manager.  In Node manager, you enter the node numbers, passwords
     and mail flavor of those who will be calling your system. The File
     Echo Manager allows you to view or change the actual tag names, add
     description of the tags and indicate where the files are to be
     stored. If you want to use them, group definitions are controlled in
     the Group manager.  Group definitions are handy when you want to
     remove or change similar file echoes, or groups of echoes.

     You can also have Allfix or your file tossing software calculate the
     CRC value of every file which comes into your system.  It's pretty
     important to have this option turned on. The CRC of a file, or Cyclic
     Redundancy Check, allows software like tick, etc., to check whether a
     file has been damaged or changed since it was hatched. The CRC of a
     file is a unique signature and the value of the CRC is put in the
     .tic file so that the file processing program can read what it should
     be, or rather what it was when the file was originally hatched.  When
     a file's CRC fails to match the CRC value that is reported in the
     .tic file, the .tic file will be named *.bad and that file and tic
     will not distributed further. The CRC value can change if a file is
     commented after hatching, or if the entire archive (zip or whatever)
     did not arrive. Coordinators know that they must always comment the
     files first, and then hatch them. Speaking of commenting files, both
     the Filebone and FileGate, and many of the participating FDNs, have
     policies in place that ask that you do not change or remove a files'
     comment until all of your downlinks have received the original file.

     Allfix saves all the information in a database.  One thing you might
     want to do often is backup your allfix directory... after entering
     all of that information, you sure wouldn't want to lose it and have
     to re-enter it <g>.

     = A bit more History: we thought we had it all together... =

     Since Tick did not have a way to check for duplicate files, early on
     a good number of duplicate files were sent out through several FDNs.

     Coordinators would get a file in from an author, say a bbs utility,
     or a bbs door file, only to find out later that the author had sent
     it out to every FDN that had a bbs utility file echo or Online Door
     file echo <g> ... So sometimes you'd see the same file show up in
     several different file echoes :(.

     These duplicate files were a waste in bandwidth and pretty bad
     waste of money, not only for the fidonet sysop's at large (who wanted
     5 copies on your system of the latest Diz creator or bop'n'smash door
     FIDONEWS 17-43               Page 7                   23 Oct 2000


     <g>), but also for all the HUBs on the Filebone who were moving the
     files.  Duplicate files could also cause problems in a sysop's
     inbound directory.. when two different tics came in for the same
     file, the second file might overwrite the first.. but the tick that
     got tossed by the tossing program might not match the CRC's of the
     file - in a case like this, though rare, nothing was imported unless
     you manually went to your inbound and renamed all the *.bad files to
     *.tic.

     = Necessity is the .... =

     A great feature of the "newer" tick clones like FileManager and
     Allfix was developed to help out with duplicate files. These programs
     have the ability to check for duplicate files across all FDNs, or
     just across file echoes.  When detected, these files can be set aside
     in a temporary directory.  You can have the program check for
     duplicate files by filename, or extension with some of these programs
     like FileManager, so it is then pretty easy to find dupe files before
     they reach your actual file base.  This feature didn't help all the
     HUBs who had to pass the dupes around but these dupe file trapping
     features did at least help the sysop who had to clean up the mess on
     his own system <g>.

     When the policy of the IFDC FileGate was written up, that was one of
     the most important issues.. to join the FileGate an FDN Coordinator
     would have to agree to try to not release any duplicate files.
     Contact with authors was stressed, as well as working out hatching of
     popular files amongst the FDN coordinators.  The IFDC stands for the
     International File Distribution _Cooperative_ ... If you were going
     to join, you had better be willing to "Cooperate" with each other :)

     Another idea that started to help limit Dupe files as a result of the
     organization of the FileGate was the Backchannel area.  Kevin who
     hosted ANSICLUB fdn, and the coordinators who were working with me on
     the FileGate policy knew that we wanted a way to allow one
     coordinator to easily send a file to another coordinator so that the
     receiving coordinator could test the file and release it in his or
     her FDN.  I knew that if a coordinator could simply send a file to
     another coordinator with whom he had an agreement, he might be more
     inclined to do so :) I looked at Tick's options and found a rarely
     used option that Barry Geller included in TICK. By putting two flags
     together, asterisk (*) and ampersand (&), you could indicate in your
     configuration file that files in a particular area were "receive
     only", such as receive from a downlink so that you can send them to
     your _uplink_. While allfix and filemanager do not use such notation,
     they use the English language equivalent with words like,
     "receive-only".  When I suggested the use of these flags in an
     "File2HQ" file echo, the BackChannel areas were born :)

     Backchannel areas are areas that allow a sysop to send files upstream
     to a file distribution HQ's site.  Backchannel areas use this type
     notation (*&) in the FileGate.zxx and Filebone.na files. The
     backchannel areas will work if used correctly: You make your HUB or
     uplink have the send flag set (C, or H, or Send-only) for the
     backchannel area in your config section, and then you give the *&
     flag (receive only) to the down links in that area.
     FIDONEWS 17-43               Page 8                   23 Oct 2000


     Remember the PDNHATCH TICK segment example earlier.. that area is a
     Backchannel area:

     Area c:\files\pdn\pdnhatch PDNHATCH
     1:163/215 PASSWORD *&
     1:163/27  PASSWORD *&
     (downlinks)   -----------> submissions from
                               these nodes...
     1:12/12   PASSWORD C
     (uplink)      -----------> go to this node
                                (_only_)

     Theoretically, if you release a file in a backchannel area, and your
     uplink is major HUB, your file will be forwarded on to the FDN
     Coordinator's system.  The Chess fdn and W32 Fdn also use backchannel
     areas, CHS-UPLD and W32_2HQ respectively.  See the Filegate.zxx or
     Filebone.na for other FDNs who use these type areas.  Files hatched
     in these areas on your system will first go to your _uplink_ and if
     your uplink is a HUB, it will continue up the chain to the HQ of the
     respective FDN, where it can be examined, checked for viruses and
     then released by the coordinator into the file stream.  If your
     uplink is not a major HUB, the file you hatch may 'dead-end' as it's
     called, or stop somewhere up the line since no one is required to
     pass these files along.


     = Finding Out What's Available =

     File echo distribution is documented in two main files, the
     Filegate.zxx file, and the Filebone.na file.  Filegate.zxx is the
     FileGate's list of currently active FDNs on the IFDC FileGate, with
     details about contacting the coordinators of each one, how the FDN
     connects to the main Filegate system, and a list of Filegate
     Supersites/HUBs worldwide.  Any file echo originating on the filegate
     is delivered to the FileGate HUBs listed in FileGate.zxx, and they
     are also delivered to the Filebone for distribution by all Filebone
     HUBs. I edit the Filegate.zxx file and release a new one when there
     are changes.

     Larry James, Technical Coordinator of the Filebone publishes the
     filebone.n* files (.na, .nal, and .no).  The Filebone.na file
     includes all the FDNs on the FileGate, plus those which are only on
     the Filebone and not on the FileGate.  The Filebone.no is a list of
     privately released FDNs (not necessarily available on the filebone,
     but carried by many filebone HUBs), and the Filebone.nal is a list of
     all the echotags in the total (FileGate and Filebone) distribution
     which have tag name longer than 8 characters. Larry publishes the
     Filebone.n* files on Monday each week.

     All of these files use the same notation, first published by Kevin
     Schneider (Kevfun) of the ANSI Club FDN.  Kevin was the creator of
     the first Filebone.na file, and was the first one to think of putting
     together such a list of file echoes.  The format of the current
     Filebone.na file and the FileGate.zxx file is essentially the same
     one originally published then, and uses the notation from George
     Peace's RAID program, and the original TICK program.

     = What if I want to Start an FDN =

     If you have thought of an FDN collection that will not duplicate the
     services of an existing FDN, both the Filebone and the FileGate would
     be happy to distribute your files.  Take a look at either the
     FileGate.zxx or Filebone.na files to see if there is already an FDN
     distributing the types of files you are interested in hatching. If
     so, you might want to contact that coordinator and see if he could
     use a hand.. if one doesn't already exist, you could create a new
     FDN.  You can contact me at janis@filegate.net or at 1:2320/38 if you
     would like your files to be available on both the FileGate and the
     Filebone.  You can contact Larry James (larry@filebase72) if you
     would like your files available only on the Filebone.

     When someone contacts me requesting that their FDN be considered for
     distribution, I refer them first to the FDNINFO.ZIP archive which
     contains a number of FileGate documents.  Of course the policy
     document of the FileGate is there <smile>, as well as a file called
     FDNINFO.FAQ.  This document explains pretty much what I need from a
     coordinator to list and include the new FDN in FileGate and Filebone
     distribution.  The Filebone also has it's own policy document and FAQ
     files now so it may also be a good idea to read through these two
     documents.

     However you decide to have your FDN distributed, we'll be happy to
     help you get set up :)

     = The FileGate Archive =

     The FileGate Archive is located on my system in Louisville Kentucky,
     ftp.filegate.net.  Other mirrors include ftp.maasstad.com, and
     ftp.bayhaus.dtdns.net.

     We're always looking for new sites who would like to mirror the main
     archive at filegate.net, so if you are willing and able to open your
     system up to anonymous ftp users, or www users, let me know :)

     Larry James also has an anonymous ftp/www site set up at the
     following:

       http://www.filebase72.com for the web
       ftp.filebase72.com for ftp or BinkP.

     Hello Steve.

      js> Seems to me that the old editor picked him as a replacement
      js> so he had a VERY good claim.

      SQ> The kicker for me is that Douglas also made the comment about how

     first.

     Bull.  Doug called for volunteers.  The following month he wrote that
     there had been two volunteers, both of whom he felt were capable
     people.  Of the two, he chose Bobby simply because his note was the
     first to arrive.

     Steve, I'm no fan of Bobby's in general (re: echo takeovers), as you
     are aware. However he is getting the short end of the stick from
     people like you on the FidoNews deal.  The FidoNews editorship has
     ALWAYS (as far as I can remember) been a "hand-me-down" job, where the
     outgoing editor picks the new one.  NEVER have the *C's been involved
     in this decision.

     Doug named his heir apparent, Bobby.  He did so publicly in FidoNews.
     Yet when it came time, and Bobby stepped up to bat, everyone jumped
     all over him.  They started off by asking what proof he had to back up
     his claim.  These idiots (nothing personal!) didn't even remember the
     article in FidoNews naming him. Yet they claim that Bobby is trying to
     "grab" power.  Perhaps so, but he did it months ago and Doug approved
     it!

     Doug followed up by sending Bobby copies of the software and pending
     articles. There can be NO DOUBT that Doug intended Bobby to take over.
     When Bobby reminded everyone of this he was accused of being pushy.
     The arrogant *C's didn't even bother to contact Bobby to discuss the
     matter!

     In spite of his LEGITIMATE claim to the editorship, Bobby graciously
     agreed to step aside and to assist the *C chosen editor.  He has been
     a total gentleman throughout the entire episode.

     Why you are continuing to drag Bobby through the mud is beyond me.
     The new editor (also a fine fellow) is in place and FidoNews is once
     again running smoothly.  Let's hope that he too has the foresight to
     have a replacement in the wings, though with the current crop of *Cs
     it doesn't seem to matter.

     John

     Re: The Temp RC14 St:
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Hello Members of the RCC,

     Since you are all probably reading this echo and most all of you would
     certainly respond to a problem if need be, I ask that you please do
     not allow David to install an outsider as the Temp RC of Region 14.
     Putting Policy 4.07 aside in *some* respects regarding membership, Jim
     is now the NC of two nets and the RC of his own region. Hats anyone?

     In some cases, I can understand why there is the need for several
     hats, especially in this case of shrinking nodes when there is no one
     else who is willing to get the job done. In this instance, there are
     two people who are in R14 who are able and willing to do the job and
     to get it done without alienating the members of their region.

     Placing an outsider in the RC position is going to lose more nodes.
     Let's say that Satti had placed Dallas in as Temp RC10 after Kohl left
     and Dallas was tasked with cleaning up R10. How many more nodes do you
     think may have left at that point? This has nothing to do with Dallas,
     his personality or his way of doing things but the nodes would
     definitely resent the outside interference when most of them knew that
     among them they had their OWN people able and willing to get the job
     done.

     Installing Jim is similar to taking these R14 sysops by the hand and
     telling them they are a bunch of children who need adult guidance
     since they are incapable of doing the work themselves. Any of the
     nodes teetering on the brink of wondering if they should stay with
     Fido or just shut down their boards are going to fold.

     You as individual RC's need to think about what would happen in your
     regions if you became inactive for some reason and David appointed a
     Temp RC from another region in your place to "fix" your respective
     regions. How do you think your sysops would feel in that case? Now
     apply this to R14.

     Give the Temp RC job to Michael McCabe and let him work with Jeff and
     any others that may be also assisting them behind the scenes. Let R14
     fix itself by working with their OWN.

     The RCC can overrule the ZC and it's time for that action before it's
     too late.

     Thank you for your consideration.

                                   *ruth*

     sample. Take these two bottles and go back and get urine samples."

     of urine. He sets them on the desk and says, "Here's Mr. Brown's and
     this one is Mr. Smith's."

     "That's good," they said, "but what's in those two buckets?"

     wondering whatever happened to her two boys. "They must be all grown
     now," she thought, and she asked her husband to track the families
     down and ask them for pictures of the boys. A month or two later, they
     get a lovely response from the Mexican family, showing the boy Juan
     with his brothers and sisters, but they heard nothing from the Arab

      It seems a man decided to write a book about churches around the
     nation. So he started out by flying to California, and working East
     from there. He went to a church and began taking photographs, etc, and
     noticed a golden telephone on a wall and was intrigued with a "$10,000
     a minute" sign nearby.

      Seeking out the pastor about the phone and the sign, he was told the
     golden phone is, in fact, a direct line to Heaven. And, if he paid the
     price, he could talk directly to God. He thanked the pastor for
     answering his question, and continued on his way.

      As he visited churches progressively Eastward, and on around the
     United States, he found more phones with the same sign and the same
     answer from each pastor.

      Finally he arrived in Texas, on his way to New York, and entered a
     church in Dallas. Lo and behold, there on a wall he saw the usual
     golden telephone, but this time the sign of "Calls: 25 cents" is
     posted instead.

      Fascinated by the change, he requested to talk to the pastor and
     asked, "Reverend, I have been in cities all across the country, and in
     each church I found this golden telephone and have been told it is a
     direct line to Heaven and that I could use it to talk to God. But in
     the other churches the cost was $10,000 a minute. And your sign has
     only 25 cents a call as the request. Why?"

      The pastor smiled benignly and replied, "Oh, my Son, that's very easy
     FIDONEWS 17-43               Page 17                  23 Oct 2000


     to explain. Those people have to pay a large service charge. You're in
     Texas now, it's a local call from here."

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.

     Normally this header belongs to Frank Vest, who has pointed us to many
     very interesting and beautiful sites. I had occasion to wander into
     Texas territory <BWG> and check out Frank's own site. WOW! What a
     beauty! So many options that I'll have to return again and again to
     check all of the links.

     Hello All,

     Just a quick note to let everyone know that Collin County Station's
     Web address has changed some. The address is:

      http://texoma.net/~flv

     If you were linking to the http://texoma.net/~flv/ccs.htm address,
     please note the small change. The page has been updated with frames
     and some other major/minor changes. I found that it was hard to get
     around in there for me... and since I designed the thing, I can
     imagine how hard it would be for others that didn't know their way
     around the site. :)

     Have fun and feel free to link to the new address.

     Letter to the editor,

     Fidotel has been offline for quite some time.....  However, I have
     recently purchased new computers, upgraded software, and have acquired
     a very reliable xDSL line.

     Would you please post the following links to the FidoTel Fidonews
     resource in future issues of the Fidonews?
