               FREE AND OPEN ECHO INFORMATION

     I am starting a non-backbone echo for the free and open
     exchange of information on echos and echo feeds.  There
     is a need to create an forum for people to be able to
     freely discuss what is happening with the various new
     backbones that are coming into existence without being
     subject to political friction or intimidation.  This
     requires an echo that does not depend on any particular
     backbone for distribution and does not try to impose
     any set of values or beliefs on the participants.  As
     new backbones come into existence this will become
     increasingly important.

     To do this we need several regional hubs to carry
     and distribute the echo.  We need one or two
     in California, one in the Colorado area, one in the
     Southwest, one in the Northeast and one in the
     Southeast.  The ideal hub will be an echomail junky
     who knows the other local echomail junkies.

     There will be a modest volume of messages on the
     echo but it will contain a lot of valuable informa-
     tion about what is happening.  It will also be
     an ideal place for someone to promote a new echo.
     There also seems to be a lot of confusion as to how
     and to what extent an echo moderator can maintain
     some proprietary right in an echo.  That is a question
     that I and several other participating lawyers can
     answer if there is an interest.

     If you are interested in becoming one of the hubs for
     this echo please send an netmail message to me at
     node 1:115/982       Curtis Sahakian

     INTRO TO FIDO
     -------------

     I was writing a BBS program, you see.
     I had a clear goal:  make it maintenance-free!
     A friend, name of James, ran a beta-test site,
     Uncovering bugs and things that weren't right.
     One of his questions, it made my heart sink.
     "It can, I assume, run underneath Bink?"

     "Bink?" I inquired, not wanting to know.
     "Yes," he replied, "It's used for Fido".
     Fido!  That means I've got more work to do.
     "Will your users need access, or is it just you?"
     "It's just for me, and Binkley does mail.
     So write for a 'door' and you're on the right trail."

     Ah!  I could do that!  I've written a door.
     But this talk of Fido ... I sought to learn more.
     So James said, "It's complex, but you'll get the gist,
     if you understand the Fido Node List!"
     "Node List?  What's that?" I asked.  He said, "Well,
     that's all the nodes!  It's from MakeNL".

     "From MakeNL?  What on earth does that mean?
     Give me a break:  be more clear than you've been."
     Paying no heed, he said, "Then it's sent to us.
     So it arrives, in a form called 'St. Louis'.
     Now, you convert it -- I use XlaxNode.
     Some other people use different code."

     Now I was lost.  I was very confused.
     My brain, it was spinning; my ego was bruised.
     But I took some notes, to make sense of this mess
     of Opus and oMMM and of QuickBBS.
     And sometime near dawn, I did see the light!
     I lived and breathed Fido; I knew ev'ry byte!

     Elated, I was, with newly-found smarts.
     Fido was great and I knew all the parts.
     I learned about SEAdog and TBBS,
     Dutchie and more!  I knew it ALL -- YES!
     But what I heard next ... it made me go pale ...
     "Now we will learn all about ... EchoMail!"

     Jim Deputy (aka Sir Dep)
     1:204/40

                          Sysop Comments on the
                       IFNA Statement of Direction


     I have just read Don Daniels article "Problems Between IFNA and
     FidoNet  ...and a Potential Solution" in FNEWS550.

     First off, I would like to commend Don on writing such an
     excellent article. The article lays several issues to rest that
     I have had with IFNA, and FidoNet.

     I have been in the Network now a little over a year. I think
     the biggest debate I have seen, is basically broken down to:
     "Who says, and by what right does IFNA claim to represent us."

     Recently Butch Walker resigned as the ZEC. An election was held
     in which only the *C's were allowed to vote. Yet, no-where in
     Policy3 is there such an office as ZEC, or NEC. Yet, they were
     allowed to vote.

     While I understand that many elections from a Node level might
     be a bit on the hard side to correlate. I would like to suggest
     that possibly, each and every Network in each Zone be required
     to have its own constitution.

     Under the constitution, the following could be laid out:

     1. Method for the NC to poll nodes for opinions of the Sysops
        within the Net. The Nets vote count to be on a percentage
        of systems. i.e. a small net one vote a large net several
        votes. With the NC being required to vote (as close as
        possible) the percentage of votes for/against an issue.

     2. A means whereby, on what is considered today to be a policy
        complaint, be placed before the sysops peers in the net
        prior to going up the *C chain on appeals. Thus if there
        is a complaint from outside the net, it is presented to the
        NC, who presents it to the Net as a whole.

     3. With a similar constitution on a regional level and zone
        level. These constitutions should also have a means of re-
        calling or impeaching a *C if they are not doing their
        job.

     I agree with Don, Rome wasn't built in a day. Neither was New
     York. And while I know it may sound silly or whatever, I think
     a good Net-Level constitution, with similar constitutions for
     the Regional Level and Zone Levels might be a very good step in
     making IFNA a little more palatable for the rest of us.

     I think IFNA should be more of a Service/Standards type group.
     Meaning keep up the Nodelist, as well as set standards (at the
     start, to be moved into a more democratic aspect as it works
     FidoNews 5-52                Page 5                   26 Dec 1988


     out). Once the standards are set, to then see to the mainten-
     ance of those standards, and if necessary enforce them.

     I personally feel that it is real hard for someone to tell me
     that they represent me, when I don't have a darned thing to
     say about it. I was in the Net over 4 months before I even
     knew there was a Policy3, let alone a complaint channel to go
     along with it. And a constitution on a NET level would sure
     go along way in seeing that standards are maintained.


     As Rick Siegel (I think) is fond of saying:

     Just one persons opinion.

     Rick Bates
     1:229/101
                   National Law Enforcement Conference

     If you're a law enforcement officer, or have users on your
     system that are law enforcement officers, you may be interested
     in an Echomail conference specifically set up for sworn officers
     (federal, state or local) including retired officers.

     The POLICE echo is an area dedicated to discussions of new
     enforcement techniques, training and benefit programs available
     for officers, and discussions concerning the use of PC's in
     law enforcement.  Several of the participating boards maintain
     file areas dedicated to shareware or public domain software
     designed for use in law enforcement.

     The area has been running for almost two years now, and became
     international over a year ago.  Police officers from all over
     North America participate in discussions of mutual interest.

     The Conference Moderators are (US) Dave Johnson (1:260/204) and
     (Canada) Rick Bates (1:229/101).  This is a restricted access
     conference in that only sworn officers or retired officers are
     to be given access.  Each sysop carrying the area is expected to
     set it up as a barricaded area and verify that any users
     requesting access are in fact officers.  The echo is available
     to any Node operated by qualifying Sysops, and we are especially
     interested in Boards run by law enforcement personnel, or people
     in similar professions.  Several other echoes are hosted by
     these police systems, including one in the Toronto area known as
     ASKACOP.  Here users may ask several experienced police officers
     some everyday questions about law enforcement.  Users are able
     to clear up questions they have on the law, and the officers
     have been able to pass on tips regarding various offences, safe
     driving, etc. That area, has since expanded and there is also an
     area called ASKALAWYER, where users can obtain specific legal
     opinions from practicing lawyers.

     Together, the private POLICE echo and the two public areas have
     created avenues of communications amoungst police officers and
     the public that would not otherwise be possible.  In addition,
     at 229/101, the local Police post weekly Crime Stoppers
     bulletins in a read only format. This "online" format is the
     first of its kind in the Crime Stoppers program anywhere in
     North America.  Sysops everywhere are encouraged to contact
     their local police agency and speak with the Crime Stoppers
     Coordinator for their area.

     For more information on any of these areas, contact either of
     the moderators listed above.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                         Episode 19:  Vacation Time


     Well!  Here I am, back from vacation!  Sorry to miss a few issues
     of FidoNews here!

     Boy, a vacation does wonders  for  your  mind and body -- even if
     you really don't go  anywhere!    All  I  did was go skiing for a
     weekend and go flying one  morning  and  relaxed around the house
     for a day.  All of a sudden  my  interest  is back up in work, in
     FidoNet, in the EchoMail conferences...in FidoNews.

     Maybe that's  part  of  our  problem  out  there  in  some of the
     EchoMail conferences.   Maybe  we  computer hacker types just get
     TOO into this FidoNet thing to take a breather once in awhile; we
     forget to stop and smell the  roses  along the way.  Maybe that's
     why we keep getting so  wrapped  up  in  issues that may not mean
     much and so  easily  take  offense  to  the  written  word on the
     screen.

     I mean, we're all intelligent  people here.  We SHOULD be able to
     recognize the fact that  this  electronic  media lacks so much of
     the expressionism we humans  rely  upon to make our communication
     work.  Yet how often do we  see  messages that are not only flame
     but obvious hasty replies to minor sections of messages that only
     lead to more flame and wanderings  off the original, and possibly
     important, subject?

     I strongly recommend a vacation  for anyone who feels burned out,
     even just a little bit, with anything happening in FidoNet.  Some
     peoples' answer in the  past  was  to  "pull the plug".  Did that
     help them?  Probably.    But  was  it  the  only  answer?  I say,
     probably not.   They  could've  pretended  to  "pull the plug" by
     getting away from it for  awhile.    They  could've possibly just
     checked the board each morning to make sure it was running, check
     the NetMail area for  inbound  messages  from friends, maybe even
     check the local message bases out  on behalf of their local users
     (remember them?), then say  "Good-bye"  for the day.  In essence,
     they'd be taking a vacation from  the socio-political environment
     of EchoMail and gone and done other things.

     Would this have worked?  No  telling.   But I am here to tell you
     that a few weeks' break from  FidoNet  here has refreshed a great
     many of my attitudes.  And I didn't even leave town!
