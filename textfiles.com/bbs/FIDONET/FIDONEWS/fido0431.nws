                    Fido/FidoNet Version 12 Announcement

             First of all,  this is a Macintosh to ASCII conversion of
     the  data  sheet  I  send  out to people who request information.
     While it is accurate and pretty complete,  it is probably  a  bit
     insulting  to  the  FidoNet  crowd,  as it assumes you're not too
     sophisticated ... sorry 'bout that!

             Fido Version 12 is going to be "shipped"  at  the  Fourth
     FidoNet Conference, Aug 20, in DC. Its working now; the manual is
     completely  written  (by  Scot  Kamins;   he  did  the  "Q  &  A"
     documentation,  and the Mac BASIC book,  and  he  does  interface
     design  ...) and now being formatted for printing.  The manual is
     top notch.  Software is having small bugs chased out,  and is  in
     good shape.

             Since  I  messed  around for so long,  I'm up against the
     wall for time, so this is late,  the software is late,  I'm late.
     (What  else is new ...) So,  until 4FidoCon,  this is probably it
     for communication from me in FidoNews.

             Sorry to keep everyone in the dark for so long.

     (Remember this is a mechanical Mac -> ASCII conversion; I've also
     struck  a  lot  of  the  junk  that   everyone   already   knows:
     "Fido/FidoNet is a Bulletin Board and ...")

      Fido/FidoNet Specifications Effective 1 Sept 87

     System Description:

     Performance:

             Fido/FidoNet  internally  buffers  all  DOS  file  system
     operations,  avoiding many of the typical performance bottlenecks
     of other systems.  All aspects of  the  system  are  considerably
     faster than previous versions, and FidoNet network operations are
     up to 10 times faster.

     Low disk space overhead

     FidoNews 4-31                Page 2                   17 Aug 1987


             Fido/FidoNet  stores all of its parameters and statistics
     in a single system  file.  (Previous  versions  used  many  small
     files;  the  savings  in  disk  space  over  previous versions is
     tremendous.) Fido/FidoNet installed on a 10 Meg or  20  Meg  hard
     disk has nearly unlimited space;  thousands of messages, files, a
     2,000+ node FidoNet network, with plenty of disk space remaining.

             For a sample "small scale" system,  running on  two  360K
     floppies  and 256K of memory,  there is room for all of the basic
     Fido/FidoNet system utilities plus your own text editor and other
     tools, over 200 messages, and close to 100K bytes free.  The same
     system  with  a 1,600 node FidoNet Network can have approximately
     80 messages.

     Modem Handling:

             Fido takes advantage of all of the major features of  all
     modems  supported.  The  callers'  baud rate is determined by the
     system automatically;  callers do not have to hit the RETURN  key
     to get the systems attention.  Outgoing calls made by FidoNet (if
     so enabled) watch for busy,  no-dialtone,  and other features  as
     supported by each modem. Fido/FidoNet performs tests on the modem
     during normal operation to ensure that the modem is connected and
     behaving properly.

     Caller DataBase:

             Each  caller  to  the  system  has  a  record in a simple
     database that maintains each callers  name,  password,  terminal-
     specific  settings,  privilege  levels and controls,  and various
     statistics.  Tools are provided to manipulate these records  both
     manually and automatically. Database size is limited only by disk
     space.

     System Messages and Bulletins:

             Fido/FidoNet  uses  ordinary  text  files for most system
     messages and bulletins that are meant to be customized  for  each
     installation.  When displaying and entering text, Fido takes into
     account each callers terminal settings,  such as screen width and
     length, and performs on-screen formatting for a clean display.

     Access Controls:

             There  are  six  privilege  levels  that  callers  can be
     assigned.  You can specify minimum  privilege  levels  needed  to
     access commands and both message and file areas.

             In  addition  to  privilege levels,  there are 32 "locks"
     with matching "keys".  Locks can be applied  to  things  such  as
     commands  and  message  and file areas;  callers can be given any
     number of keys.  Callers can access only those things  for  which
     they have all of the matching keys, plus meet the privilege level
     requirements. For example, if the E)nter-Message command has lock
     #20 applied,  only callers that have Key #20,  plus any necessary
     minimum privilege levels,  can use,  see or get  help  with  that
     FidoNews 4-31                Page 3                   17 Aug 1987


     command.

             Limits can be placed on each callers' connect-time on the
     system  per-call  and per-24-hour period,  and on file downloads.
     Time limits are enforced at all times,  including  file  download
     and upload,  so that scheduled Events are not preempted by caller
     file  downloads  or  uploads.   ("Optional"   events,   described
     elsewhere, are allowed to be preempted by human callers.)

     Context-Sensitive Help System:

             The  help system provides context-sensitive help,  taking
     into account what commands the caller has access  to  because  of
     privilege levels or locks.  Help is available on every command in
     the system.  The Help files are ordinary text files that  can  be
     customized to fit your specific needs.

     Message Areas:

             There can be up to 200 seperate message areas,  each with
     access controls as described above.  The number  of  messages  in
     each  area  is limited only by disk space.  Callers can enter new
     messages, modify existing saved messages,  search for messages by
     keyword  or  as  addressed  to  them,   and  perform  many  other
     operations upon messages.  Help  is  available  at  all  decision
     points.

     File Areas:

             Fido/FidoNet  supports  up to 200 independent file areas,
     with access controls as descibed earlier.  Within each File  Area
     callers  can  access  files  and  related  commands.  There are a
     number of ways in which to  make  files  available  (or  not)  to
     callers.  Commands  and  functions have been added to make remote
     maintenaince of file areas and other parts of the disk easier for
     the system operator.  Files can be  uploaded  and  downloaded  in
     ASCII, XMODEM, Telink, "MODEM BATCH" or Kermit protocols.

             (All  of  the  file  transfer  protocols listed above are
     available in most commercially available terminal  programs,  and
     in 4th quarter 1987 in terminal communications software from Fido
     Software.)

             There can be up to 100 "Events",  scheduled to run at any
     time  of  the  day  and  any  day  of  the  week.   Events  allow
     Fido/FidoNet  to  run  FidoNet  network  mail,  execute  external
     programs via DOS  Batch  Files,  and  other  events  for  various
     special purposes. In Version 12 of Fido/FidoNet the events system
     has been expanded into a timed event programming system,  capable
     of  handling  simultaneous  and/or  overlapping  events,  special
     "optional"    events,    and    combinations    of   events   and
     characteristics.  ("Optional" events can be used, for example, to
     simulate "background" FidoNet network activity while no caller is
     otherwise occupying the system.)

     Incoming FidoNet mail at any time
     FidoNews 4-31                Page 4                   17 Aug 1987


             Fido/FidoNet can now receive mail from other Fido/FidoNet
     systems  or  compatible  software  at  any  time  a caller is not
     occupying the system, as well as during scheduled FidoNet Network
     Events.  Optionally,  Fido/FidoNet can execute external  programs
     via  a  DOS  Batch  File  to do special processing of unscheduled
     Incoming Mail.

     Other Features & Enhancements:

             Fido/FidoNet is considerably streamlined in  day  to  day
     operations  over previous versions;  most maintenance can be done
     automatically,   and  manual  operations  are  easier  and   more
     convenient to use.

             You can sign in to the system from the local keyboard, as
     if you had called in remotely with a modem, without "taking down"
     the  system.  Upcoming  events can be listed,  and previously-run
     events can be reenabled from the local keyboard.

             Fido works easily with external "shell" programs to allow
     programmers  and  "aftermarket"  add-on  programs  to  work  with
     Fido/FidoNet.  Technical  information is available in the manual.
     (External "shell" support programs are not currently supplied  by
     Fido Software.)

     Installation:

             All  Fido/FidoNet  parameters,  lists of events,  command
     names,  and message and file area definitions  are  contained  in
     ordinary text files you can display and change with your own text
     editor  program.  Message  and file areas are defined in one text
     file;  the Fido/FidoNet system takes care  of  all  the  work  of
     creating  and  verifying  the  actual  DOS  subdirectories  used.
     Commands are in their own text file,  along  with  any  privilege
     levels  and locks.  You can change the command name to any single
     word you choose.

     Compatibility:

             Each new Fido/FidoNet version is always  compatible  with
     previous   versions;   never   will   you  be  left  behind  with
     incompatible  software.  This  has  been  true  through  numerous
     versions, and will remain true in the future.

     Support Programs Supplied with Fido/FidoNet:

             The  following  programs  are  supplied  as  part  of the
     standard Fido/FidoNet system package.  In addition,  there are  a
     number of "aftermarket" programs from other authors to make using
     and maintaining Fido/FidoNet easier and more powerful.

             (You can schedule Events in Fido/FidoNet to execute these
     or  other  programs  at  any time,  using an MSDOS Batch File you
     create to make your system completely or partially automatic.)

     MSGMGR.EXE
     FidoNews 4-31                Page 5                   17 Aug 1987


             The  Message  Manager  is   used   to   perform   routine
     maintenance   on  messages  within  Fido/FidoNet  Message  Areas.
     MSGMGR can purge messages by relative age (2 to  1000  days  old)
     and renumber messages so they are sequential. MSGMGR is commanded
     through a plain text file as is Fido/FidoNet, and allows complete
     flexibility in specifying what operations to perform,  if any, on
     any of the  Fido/FidoNet  message  areas.  SYSOP.EXE  This  is  a
     database-like  tool  for  managing  the Fido/FidoNet caller list,
     that contains the  names,  passwords  and  statistics  and  other
     information  on each person in the system.  With it you can enter
     new callers,  delete existing callers one by one or by time since
     last  logged  in;  set  caller  privilege  level and assign Keys;
     perform data integrity checks on each record;  lock callers  into
     specific message and file areas;  and many more functions.  There
     is also an "undo" feature and context sensitive help.

     TIMELOG.EXE
             Fido/FidoNet maintains a log  of  caller  access  of  the
     Fido/FidoNet system by each hour of each day of the week; TIMELOG
     displays  this  information  in  graphical  form,   to  give  you
     information on your systems use.

     AUTOMAIL.EXE
             This tool lets you create FidoNet network  messages  with
     your own text editor or word processor.  For example,  during the
     day you can create FidoNet network messages as part of your work,
     and  copy  them  to  a  disk  or  subdirectory   you   designate;
     Fido/FidoNet can be instructed to execute AutoMail and FidoNet to
     automatically send your messages through the FidoNet network.

     TWIX.EXE
             Twix  prints  FidoNet network mail newly received on your
     printer or in a disk file you specify.

     11-TO-12.EXE
             This  tool  is  used  to  convert  existing  Fido/FidoNet
     version  11 installations into text files that you can modify and
     use to create  the  new  system.  It  performs  all  file  format
     conversions  necessary  to  work  with  the  new  programs.  Each
     Fido/FidoNet version is always compatible in  form  and  function
     and file format with previous versions.

      Computers Supported:

             The   Fido/FidoNet   software   runs   on  the  following
     computers:

             IBM Personal Computer, XT, AT and clones

     There are times that the telephone will ring in vain at the water
     and sewer department, because there is no one there to answer it.

     The bartender at the local pub wanders over to the slumping
     figure by the window.

     "Looks like you need a beer!  Rough day at work?"

     Better make it a straight bourbon, a rough day at work makes me
     paranoid about amber liquids that foam.

     "Where do ya work?"

     At a sewage plant.

     "RIGHT!  One bourbon coming up!"

     (A comely young lady wearing tight jeans and a 'Save the
     Armadillo' sweatshirt walks over.)

     "May I have a word with you?"

     No.

     "Awww, come on now, I just want to talk."

     Lady, if this is about your plugged sewer, rusty drinking water
     or your house flooding last September, call our main office
     tomorrow during working hours.

     "Oh no, I don't live around here.  I want to ask if you are
     willing to observe 'Meatless Monday' with us?"

     Please go away.

     "Do you know about 'Meatless Monday' and what it means to the
     world?"

     It must have something to do with either 'Gay Rights' or the
     'Celibate Society' movements.  I'm the wrong person to talk to...
     please have a nice evening.

     "OH NO! 'Meatless Monday' is a worldwide event planned to
     demonstrate the cruelty of eating the flesh of other living
     animals.  We propose all people become vegetarians."

     I really don't want to be a vegetable.

     "Vegetarian.  Mankind does not have the right, nor the real need,
     to slaughter living creatures for food.  Meat protein and fat is
     slowly killing you.  Were you aware of that?"
     FidoNews 4-31                Page 9                   17 Aug 1987


     Sure beats getting knifed on the subway.

     "The more people we can get to observe 'Meatless Monday', the
     more animals will be saved from vicious slaughter."

     Vicious slaughter?

     "YES!  Do you realize how cruelly animals are killed before
     butchering?  Most are just bludgeoned into unconsciousness and
     are then quartered alive!"

     I wondered where the 'quarter-pounder' came from.

     "This is serious!  There are no standards set for the humane
     killing of animals and we want all people to boycott meat
     products for one day, as a demonstration of unity."

     Sure, lady.  I'll try not to eat anything until it has quit
     wiggling.

     "Are you involved in any ecological or conservation programs?"

     Oh, yes Ma'am.  I too believe all living creatures must be
     protected.  I am a member of the 'Save the Mosquito Committee'.
     I am the recruitment officer.

     "You are not serious!  Just what does the recruitment officer
     do?"

     I find people willing to stand naked in the swamp to act as
     feeding stations.  Interested?

     "NO!  Don't change the subject.  Our group wants to convince as
     many people as possible to be vegetarians, but we realize that
     many will insist on eating animal flesh.  We would settle on a
     standard that would require a humane method of killing them."

     That's easy.  You can volunteer to talk to the animals.

     "I don't understand what good that would do."

     They would then simply die of boredom.

     From: Robert Heller, SysOp of Locks Hill BBS 321/148

                    FidoNet software for non-MS-DOS systems!

     Do you run a BBS on a system which an O/S other than MS-DOS, such
     as CP/M 2.2 on a Z80 or CP/M-68K or TOS on an Atari ST?  I have
     written a set of network tools for CP/M-68K to put my non-MS-DOS
     system onto FidoNet. The programs consist of a FidoNet protocol
     handler (talks to other FidoNet mailer programs, such as Fido,
     Opus, and SEAdog), nodelist processing programs (one program to
     edit a nodelist with a nodediff file and a program to process a
     nodelist file into s SDB data base file), and a simple EchoMail
     package.  All of the code is in C and compiles under the Alcyon C
     compiler supplied with CP/M-68K 1.2. The package assumes UNaXcess
     (as modified to run under CP/M-68K) as the BBS program and
     assumes a Stride 400 series system and an ADC MD1202 modem (which
     is mostly Hayes compatable).  The specialized code is isolated in
     specific modules.

     The code is available on an as is basis from 321/148 in LU310
     library format.  My system does not support file requests, so
     you'll have to send me a message requesting me to file attach
     them to a FidoNet node (I'll need an OK from the SysOp of the
     node).  I have also sent it to Old Frog @ 220/1.  I don't know if
     he has the files located in either a user accessable or file
     requestable area yet.

     The following tidbit appeared in the "Calling All America" summer
     '87 newsletter:

     Question: I make a lot of long distance calls to places in my own
     state. Is there a calling plan that covers this kind of call?

     Answer: Yes....AT&T's Reach Out State plans!. These calling plans
     are similar to "Reach Out" America,  except that they give you  a
     fixed amount of low priced, direct dialed AT&T calling within one
     state.  So,  if  you  make  a  lot of calls within one state that
     aren't covered by your local telephone  company,  a  "Reach  Out"
     State  plan  could  give you an opportunity to save.  To find out
     more about these plans,  call us toll free - 1-800-222-0300.(This
     plan  is  availiable  in  29 states at this time,  and prices and
     hours may vary by state.)

     I know most FidoNet SYSOP's who have AT&T ROA are happy  with  it
     and  it  has  paid for itself many times over during NMH.  If you
     sign up for this service and it saves you money or if you know of
     alternative services that  save  FidoNet  SYSOP's  moneys  please
     write FidoNews.

                                Dale Lovell
                                  157/504

          I'm finally beginning to get ready for the Conference  in  a
     few weeks.  If things work out perfectly,  you should get to hear
     all about the Monday after the conference.  If things go a little
     wrong,  you'll still get to hear about it the following week.  In
     preparation I've made arrangements with a friend  to  borrow  his
     laptop  (a  Toshiba T1100+).  I should be able to bring it to the
     conference and write down my comments and opinions on it as  soon
     as  things  happen.  This  should  hopefully give everyone a good
     idea of  how  things  happened  and  what  was  accomplished  (in
     addition to my opinionated ideas on everything of course).  In my
     new conversion as a WordPerfect addict I stopped by my dealer and
     picked up a copy of the WordPerfect Executive.

     -- WordPerfect Executive (WordPerfect Corp., $249.00) --

          The Executive is  designed  for  people  on  the  road  with
     laptops   or   portables.   It  includes  cut  down  versions  of
     WordPerfect,  PlanPerfect (a  spreadsheet)  and  the  WordPerfect
     Library.  Since  it  all  fits onto one 720K disk (the 3 1/2 disk
     used by most of the laptops) or one  1.2  meg  disk  it  is  very
     convenient  to  use.  In the past week it has ended up staying in
     the Toshiba's drives for almost everything.  All I do is turn  on
     the  machine  and  up comes the DOS shell program.  Since I don't
     plan to  do  much  serious  work  on  the  laptop  (like  develop
     programs)  I  can  finally  appreciate  the convenience of a menu
     system. So far I haven't needed to change the default of settings
     of the shell,  although by looking over the manual it  is  almost
     identical  to the shell in the WordPerfect Library so I should be
     able to do it if the need arises.  As it stands,  it is just what
     I'd  want if I was a computer literate executive on the road with
     everything made real  easy  for  me.  Several  shell  macros  are
     included  to  switch  between the different applications (most of
     which are loaded into memory as the default) quickly and  easily.
     Also  included with Executive is a notecard program (which is the
     only program that isn't loaded into memory as  the  default),  an
     appointment  calendar  (looks the same as the one in Library),  a
     phone directory (which is very similar to Library's notebook),  a
     calculator (which lacks most of the nicer features of Library's),
     a spreadsheet and a word processor.  I'm not going to go over the
     appointment calendar,  phone directory or calculator as they  are
     all  so  close to Library's that you can just look up my comments
     in last weeks column.

          Executive is shipped on one 720K microdisk as  well  as  the
     more standard 360K disk for people using it on a non-laptop (like
     any  of  the  Compaq  portables or a home machine).  Included are
     keyboard templates for the standard ten function keys the new IBM
     extended keyboard with twelve function keys and special templates
     FidoNews 4-31                Page 13                  17 Aug 1987


     for the Toshiba T3100 and T1100+  computers.  If  none  of  these
     templates  fit your machine,  you're given a phone number to call
     and a template for your machine will be shipped to you, hopefully
     at no additional charge. I'm happy because templates are included
     for all of my machines (and the laptop that's on loan).

          The phone directory and the note card  programs  are  almost
     identical  to  the  notebook  in Library.  The main difference is
     that you aren't provided with any way to  change  the  underlying
     database, only the list view.  I would have liked to have changed
     the information stored in the phone directory,  but I managed  to
     come up with suitable workarounds.  The only other feature that I
     really miss is the dialing feature of the notebook. While I don't
     have a modem attached to the laptop I'm writing this on (and most
     hotels and  companies  aren't  accommodating  to  direct  connect
     modems), it would have been nice for my home machine.

          The  word  processor  is  a  fairly  complete  version of my
     faithful full-blown version of WordPerfect.  The feature  I  miss
     the  most is the thesaurus.  While I still have the same spelling
     checker (save the check single word option),  WordPerfect had  to
     choose  between  the  thesaurus and the spell checker in order to
     fit everything on one disk.  Almost all of the  key  combinations
     I'm  using  at  home  or  work  is the same on the Executive word
     processor.  The Executive version is also missing a  few  on  the
     fancy  formatting  features.  If  you've brought down a file from
     WordPerfect it shows the codes,  it just isn't bright  enough  to
     interpret  the  WordPerfect  codes.  I've  brought several macros
     down from WordPerfect and  have  edited  some  of  the  Executive
     macros using the Library's Macro Editor without any problems.  As
     far as I'm concerned this makes the products compatible with each
     other,  although  I  really would have preferred the thesaurus to
     the spell checker.

          The spreadsheet in Executive has proven itself  quite  nice.
     If  this  is  a  cut down version of PlanPerfect (formerly called
     MathPlan),  I may try and talk my boss into  purchasing  it  from
     work. I'd heard stories about MathPlan, but I'm just beginning to
     realize that it may be a very good program.  WordPerfect Corp has
     managed  to squeeze quite a bit into it,  along with spreadsheets
     already set  up  for  a  variety  of  uses.  While  the  graphing
     portions  of  the  Executive  spreadsheet  are a little weak,  it
     scores well on most other aspects.  It won't do three dimensional
     cubes  like  QubeCalc,  but  I  haven't  run into many spreadcube
     programs as of yet.

          The installation process was a snap.  The only problem I had
     is the spelling directory wouldn't read on the Toshiba's A drive.
     It would read in the B drive,  so I just copied everything up and
     ran the backup copy when installing the software.  I know how all
     the  manuals  warn  you not to do this,  but I had a machine with
     both types of disk drives a few feet away when I did this and was
     feeling a little lazy.  I was surprised when it asked me  for  my
     name  and  title.  I  little  digging  around produced an answer.
     Executive comes with several  sample  macros,  spreadsheets,  and
     memo/report forms.  For example pressing ALT-M creates a business
     FidoNews 4-31                Page 14                  17 Aug 1987


     memo  in  the  word  processor  or  puts  it  there if you're not
     currently using the  word  processor.  It  prompts  you  for  the
     receiving  person,  the subject and all you have to do is type in
     the text of the memo.  Another included macro copies the expenses
     blocked  in  the  spreadsheet to the word processor,  perfect for
     business expense reports.  Imagine keeping track of  your  travel
     expenses  with  a  spreadsheet  and  having  your  word processor
     automatically transfer it into your monthly expense report.  This
     is the convenience that executives have been promised  since  the
     first of the integrated programs.  WordPerfect Executive makes it
     easier by giving you everything you need to do  several  of  your
     more common business tasks (itineraries, letters, travel reports,
     etc.).

          I'm  very  enthusiastic  about Executive.  It is the closest
     thing I've seen to a perfect program for laptops.  While it isn't
     billed  as  an  integrated  program,  it comes a lot closer to an
     integrated environment than many of  those  other  programs.  The
     standard  uses of function keys make it fairly easy to learn,  as
     opposed to learning one company's spreadsheet and another's  word
     processor.  I'm  amazed  at the size of the programs,  everything
     fits on one 720K disk (and you can keep all of it in memory on  a
     640K machine) leaving a second 720K disk free for data. While I'm
     undecided as to how well it would be on a home machine, I do like
     it  as  a  program for the laptop markets and plan on using it at
     FidoCon this month.

     -- Winding Down... --

          I going to break tradition here on the  book  I'm  going  to
     recommend.  It's "Bad Habits" by Dave Barry (Owl Books, $5.95). I
     haven't  gotten  around  to  looking  at any games or reading any
     computer books this week as I've spent much of it going over "Bad
     Habits." I  first  heard  of  Dave  Barry  on  Usenet.  He  is  a
     syndicated  columnist  and  someone  had obtained permission from
     Knight-Ridder to reprint his column on Usenet.  Almost every week
     this  person  would  spend  a hour or two typing in Dave's column
     from the local paper and sending it across Usenet.  The first  of
     these  that I saw was on how modern technology worked.  I laughed
     so hard I almost ended up in an emergency room!  He  is  at  both
     enlightening  and  ludicrous.  In any case this a new book of his
     and contains many of his best columns (but leaving out some of my
     favorites). Every time I look at the net these days, I see people
     taking offense at anything and jumping at  each  other's  throats
     over imagined offenses.  Do yourselves a favor,  take a few hours
     out and read "Bad Habits." It may help give you a lighter view of
     things,  and right now I think this is badly needed in  the  net.
     Next  week  I  promise  to  go  back  and look at a more computer
     related book, but I just enjoyed this one too much to not pass it
     on to all of you.

          That ties it up for this  week.  As  always  I  welcome  you
     questions,  comments,  and general friendly chit-chat (no flames)
     to me at any of the addresses listed below.  If you're sending me
     a  message through FidoNet,  please mention to your sysop that it
     must be routed through 157/1 (or 157/0) as I'm  a  private  node.

             "FidoNet Needs Better Security!"  --- Scott Tissue


          This week saw the return of our old friend Scott  Tissue  in
     his/her  most  annoying  incarnation  yet.   The  national  Sysop
     EchoMail conference came under attack in a  new  form,  with  the
     introduction of many nonsensical messages.  Those who receive and
     read the SYSOP echo know what I am talking about.  At first these
     messages appeared to be a corruption of legitimate messages and I
     let  loose  with  one of my typical tomes (what do they say about
     fools and angels?).  It now appears that the  messages  were  not
     corruptions of previously legitimate messages but rather entirely
     faked.

     My  personal  opinion  is  that  a  current  FidoNet   sysop   is
     responsible  for this.  I base this conviction on the observation
     that a non-trivial amount of effort is being  expended  for  what
     would  otherwise  be  little  payback except to someone who has a
     regular  feed  on  that  echo  (something  more  regular  than  a
     piecemeal "stealing" of the echo.

     In  my  opinion,  all  measures  introduced  to date at improving
     FidoNet mail security fall far short of the mark.  I am thinking,
     in particular,  of the security features built into Bob Hartman's
     Confmail  system.  Bob  claims  that  by  using  all the security
     features (only toss from archives,  and then only from  a  system
     listed in the AREAS.BBS file,  with the option of using encrypted
     archives) this type of assault may  be  eliminated.  I  disagree.
     Anyone  sophisticated  enough  and  familiar  enough with how the
     system works to dump these messages into someones netmail area is
     certainly smart enough to start dumping archives and make it look
     like they came from a legitimate system.  Even the encryption  of
     archives  is not sufficient to guarantee EchoMail security.  This
     is not to take anything away from ConfMail.  It is  an  excellent
     package  and  I use it for my echomail processing.  I simply feel
     that the concentration of effort into trying to secure  the  mail
     itself is a waste of time.

     The  key,  in  my  view,  is  to  secure the link between the two
     machines.  I still feel that  public  key  encryption  (with  the
     public  keys  a  new  field in the nodelist) is the best route to
     follow.  For some reason this suggestion  appears  to  meet  with
     resistance  from  the netmail interface developers.  My suggested
     scheme is a  simple  one.  I  would  add  the  following  startup
     dialogue:

     1. The calling system identifies itself in  the  clear  and  then
        follows  that  up  by sending it's node address encrypted with
     FidoNews 4-31                Page 17                  17 Aug 1987


        it's private key.  The receiver decrypts this with the  public
        key  listed in the nodelist for the calling system and sees if
        they match.  If so, the caller's identity is confirmed.

     2. The system being called does the same (that is sends it's node
        address both in the clear and encrypted with it's private key)
        which the caller uses as additional verification that  it  has
        reached the system it thought it was calling.

     This  method  seems  to me to be elegantly simple and yet totally
     effective to secure the mails.  As  Thom  Henderson  has  pointed
     out,  this  will  not  guarantee  the elimination of Scott Tissue
     types of messages,  but it DOES guarantee that  we  know  who  is
     responsible for them since all mail links have a known origin and
     recipient.  I would like to hear from the major netmail interface
     developers  what they think about this suggestion (or from anyone
     else for that matter).  I think this year may be destined  to  be
     the  year  of security until we can plug some of the holes in our
     netmail processing.  The longer we delay  in  coming  up  with  a
     solution to this problem, the harder it will be to get the net to
     switch over, en-masse, to an enhanced protocol.

     Jay Sprenkle
     OPUS 280/303

                       Diagnostic Tools for the SYSOP

     After I received a copy of  the  OPUS  Version  1.01  software  I
     eagerly  looked toward installing it and seeing what new features
     the author had installed.

     I remembered when I installed OPUS the first time,  it took about
     a  week to tweak the settings and get everything set the way that
     I wanted it.  I also remembered that being down so much that week
     had a very bad effect on the number of calls to the system.

     I  began  to  wonder if there was some way that I could watch for
     callers to the system and still have the BBS  software  down  for
     tweaking or tests. I could plug a telephone into the line so that
     callers  would cause the bell to ring but this is a poor solution
     do to the excessive noise. I knew I would forget to unplug it and
     would be awakened in the wee hours of the morning  by  the  night
     people.

     After  a bit of experimentation an idea came to me.  Instead of a
     bell ringing,  why not install a light that would flash  when  an
     incoming call was ringing?  This turned out to be a good solution
     at  the  time  as  it  was  very quiet and still let me know if a
     caller wanted to use the system.

     I have since left the ring indicator light connected to the  line
     on the BBS system. This lets me know if someone is calling when I
     am performing routine maintenance of the BBS.

     Some  of  my friends in the area encouraged me to share this idea
     with others and start manufacturing boxes for them  as  well.  We
     have  found it a very useful tool for sysops doing diagnostics or
     simply doing maintenance of the system.  I hope  you  find  it  a
     useful tool too.

     If you are interested in obtaining one of these ringing indicator
     lights write to me or send a message through FIDO net.  The  ring
     indicator  light  is available for $10.50 plus $1.80 for postage.
     The unit is housed in an attractively  painted  metal  box,  with
     rubber  feet to prevent marring of your computer's paint job.  It
     plugs into the RJ-11 telephone jack on your internal or  external
     modem and requires no batteries or wall supplied power.  The cord
     on the unit allows you to place the box up to three feet from the
     modem. My mailing address is: 1800 Avalon Lane, Olathe, KS 66062
