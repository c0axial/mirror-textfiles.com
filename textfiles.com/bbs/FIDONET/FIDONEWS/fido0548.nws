          After  reading  last weeks Fido News,  and continuinging  to
     monitor all of the echo areas I participate in I guess it is time
     I do this article.   I have been putting it off now for almost  6
     months.   I have seen FLAME after FLAME towards the IC,  RC,  and
     even  NC.   I have watched as many a good SysOp has crumbled  and
     gone  their  merry way to bigger and better things.   An in  some
     cases  into Other Newly formed Net Works.   I want all of you  to
     know up front,  I am not normally a conformist and am usually the
     first to disagree with everything and anything.   This article is
     not a FLAME,  but is a direct attack upon some of the  principles
     we ALL are suppose to Operate within.

          How many of you know the document (Policy3) which we all are
     suppose to comply with is DATED:  24 Oct 1986?  Two years OLD, it
     is  the same policy which I came into the Net under.   It  starts
     off with a very simple statement which is true even today.

     QUOTE  " FidoNet is an amateur Electronic mail system.   As such,
     all  of it participants and operators are  non-paid  volunteers."
     With just over 1000 Nodes.   Well I looked when parselst compiled
     my nodelist this week and we have over 4000 nodes.   Not only are
     most of us still volunteers many of us do this as a Hobby,  or as
     I  always  say "For the Fun Of It".   When it no longer is Fun  I
     will do what most of the others have Done,  and that is PULL  THE
     PLUG.  Not only the Phone, but the BBS.  An right now it is close
     to no longer being FUN.

          One of the Easiest RULES which had to be complied with to be
     part of the FidoNet is still OUR main stay, though many of us can
     do it in ways different than when running a Fido System.  We MUST
     all run what was called NMH (National Mail Hour),  or what is now
     ZMH (Zone Mail Hour).  This one hour time period is our BACKBONE.
     It is the time slot where NC, RC, ZC and yes even the even the IC
     can send NET mail to all of us.  You know what is funny?  For the
     past  2  years I have ran this Mail Hour and only on a couple  of
     occassions have I received mail during this period.   You may ask
     why.   Well  it is because of the invention of that thing  called
     Crash Mail.  Where you can Poll a system and pickup mail for your
     system anytime day or night.   But would you believe me if I told
     you  that Net Mail or even Echo Mail is not the ROOT of  many  of
     the problems this Network is presently experiencing?   Well it is
     not.

          Ever  read Chapter 3?   Your Network Coordinator?   Well you
     should.   Because this Administrative Position within the Network
     structure  is  probalby  the  Most  Important.    With  out  this
     individual many of you would not have a Node Number.   In fact, I
     would  say about 90 percent of US would not have a  number.   The
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 2                   28 Nov 1988


     remaining 10 percent are assigned by the Region Coordinators  and
     in some cases referred to as Orphans or Independent Nodes.   Well
     they  are still part of this Net work and we should support  them
     as  if they were our own.   In fact,  if there is an  Independent
     node  within a region which is even close to an active net,  then
     it should be the Region Coordinators and Net Coordinators primary
     purpose  to ensure this independent node is accepted into a  Net.
     An unlike some I feel the NC structure is a valuable part of  our
     total network structure.  This one position must ensure each node
     within the net is operating smoothly,  not causing problems,  and
     in  general  complying with OUR policy.   It should also  be  the
     focal  point  for  distribution of  FidoNews,  Nodediff  changes,
     Nodelist if necessary,  and assistance in establishing new  nodes
     within  the  net.   I  can truly say if it were not for  the  Net
     Coordinator of my orginal Net I would not be here today.   He did
     a lot of work to get me into the Net from the very start.

          Region  Coordinators,  probably have the easist position  of
     all,  as  long as all of US NC under them do  our  administrative
     task properly and in a timely manner.   The hardest thing I see a
     RC  having to do is keeping the region in some simulance of order
     much like a small net work,  which a region basicall is with each
     of the NC acting as representative for the Net's.   Mind you I am
     not saying that RC do not have a tough JOB,  but as long as I  do
     mine right my RC has it easy.

          International  Coordinator,  Get a copy of policy3 and  READ
     this  section,  Chapter 5.   You people who have FLAMED THE IC in
     the past few weeks need to get a copy and read this section.   An
     I have just a few words for you.

          1.  If  you do not like what is says.   Then why has it  not
     been changed.

          2.  Until it is changed, then I suggest you either LIVE with
     it or Move on to something else.

          I for one would not VOLUNTEER to fill this position  without
     some  MAJOR changes in the present FidoNet Policy.   His  primary
     function of maintaining the node list,  may very well be the most
     difficult administrative function of all of FidoNet.   Without it
     all  you complainers would have to find some other way of  making
     contact with all the other complainers.  One other charge of this
     position is the Smooth Operation of the Entire FidoNet work,  not
     all  these other networks but OUR net work.   An right now he  is
     having  a very difficult time.   An the main reason is because he
     is trying to make things better and still maintain the  integrity
     of FIDONET.

          An  for  those of you who have not read the Policy,  then  I
     again strongly suggest you do.   An make it a point to read  para
     6.4, page 15.  I am again going to quote this particular part for
     one simple reason.  I WANT TO.

     6.4      Problems with the International Coordinator

     If  you  are having problems with the International  Coordinator,
     the you are out of luck.   You can either live with it,  drop out
     and forget it,  or join with some friends and start another  mail
     system of your own.

     UNQUOTE:

          We  all  sometimes  get  displeased with what  is  going  on
     around us,  but MUTINY is not the way.  Whether or not we want to
     admit it, we are an orginazation, and starting to become a rather
     large one.  With over 4000 nodes, and many more users than I want
     to try and count because it seems every one is getting into  this
     Hobby of ours.   So someone has to take the Reins,  and make sure
     things  are running smoothly.   An if it were not David Dodell it
     would be someone else, and there is only one way I see for things
     to  get  streight  and for those of you who do  not  like  to  be
     managed,  manhandled, and confronted with policy and controls.  I
     am very sorry to say,  if you operate a BBS you have some kind of
     rules,  which must be complied with and I for one think that many
     of  your users do not like them either but they stay as users for
     one reason because they want to.   They may not like your  rules,
     but  if they are interested in your operation they stay,  if  not
     then they go find some one elses board to play on.

          I  agree the IC,  RC,  and NC should not have any say in the
     operation  of  any  BBS,  but  when the  operation  of  that  BBS
     interacts  with the local net then the NC by all means has a  say
     in how it is done,  whether it be Echo Mail,  Net Mail, or simple
     ensuring a node is operating in the proper manner,  Like  running
     mail hour, or even operating at all.  An the NC should be able to
     act  on  what  ever  the problem may be.   If a  node  cannot  be
     contacted for 7 days by net mail.  Then the NC is responsible for
     making  the proper node diff changes.   If this continues  it  is
     within  his responsibility to place the node on hold,  show it as
     down or delete it complete from the nodelist.   An I know many do
     not like that but that is just the way it has to be.

          The  same  things applies to being annoying  or  excessively
     abusive.   It  is the NC,  RC and board sysop's responsibilty  to
     correct this type of problem and MAKE decisions.  For the NetWork
     to  survive,  or rather for the NetWork to operate we must have a
     structure of some kind.   An contrary to some belief, IFNA is not
     a governing body.  It is simply and International Organization of
     Sysops.   Some of which may or may not operate systems which  are
     compatable  with  Fido  BBS.   I for one Operate  a  Binkley/Opus
     system,  and have over the past few weeks been considering making
     it a Mail Only system.   Because I for one do not care if I  have
     Users on my BBS or not.   I operate this BBS for Me.   I read the
     mail and when I finnish I delete it.  I do not have any users who
     call and read mail.   An when they find I do not allow Uploads or
     only downloads of certain software, they do not call back.


          Now  that I have most of that off my chest.   I guess I  can

     get down to some serious Business.   EchoMail,  I have heard that
     this sysop or this moderator is pulling out of FidoNet and taking
     a  Conference with Him/or her.   An we in FidoNet will not longer
     have  access to these echo areas.   I say BUNK,  just  because  a
     moderator  takes a echoarea and moves on does not mean we  cannot
     have  it  here to.   One of the main ones I have heard  about  is
     about the HardDisk conference.   OK,  guys,  rename it, and those
     that   are  still  in  FidoNet  who  want  to  participate   Will
     participate.   An  with  everything  that is out there  to  strip
     seenbys,  and  origin lines,  then some enterprizing  sysop  will
     figure  out  a way to get the messages from other nets  into  his
     area to read anyway.   Or simply set up a link of your own and do
     not  pass it along to anyone else in FidoNet.   If you guys  want
     something  bad enough you will figure out a way to get it.   Just
     do not involve the rest of the net.

          An on the subjects of BACKBONE operation.   A backbone to me
     is the mainstay of the human body.   You can cut off an  arm,  or
     leg.   But you must have your HEAD,  and something to hold it up.
     This is YOUR Backbone.  You can operate without the backbone, but
     you  should  let  the backbone do it's job,  and that is  to  get
     information from one point to another the fastest,  cheapest  and
     quickest means.  True if a single node in Maine, wants to send an
     echo or net message to California it is easier to send it direct.
     But  if  that same message has a destination  of  Florida,  North
     Dakota,  Washington,  Louisiana,  Colorado,  Utah,  Arizona,  New
     Mexico,  California  and Hawaii.   The its being transmitted to a
     Central Distribution Point,  who sends it on to the next  central
     distribution  point who sends it to the nodes as necessary,  then
     the Backbone is a Very Necessary part of our net.   An I for  one
     feel we should do everything in our power to make this process as
     easy,  cheap and quick as possible.   An those of you who want to
     keep making it harder and harder I say to you get out of my Life.
     Go join one of the other nets or start your own.  But if you want
     to make things easy on me, and cheap for me, then by all means do
     so  but do not kill me in the process of doing it.   We need some
     rules, and policy, and we need someone to enforce these rules and
     policy.  Swiftly quickly and without question.

          This is not an advocation for David Dodell to  stepdown,  it
     is  also not an advocation to allow IFNA to assume control of the
     NET.   It is an advocation for US as SysOps to do our own  things
     but remember there are others out there who are doing their thing
     like  us.   An  anytime you get more than one person doing  their
     thing,  you have to have quidelines of operation between the  two
     boards,   Whether written,  oral, or a combination of both.  That
     is  just way things are.   I also know there are those out  there
     who will not like what I have just said,  and others who will and
     still  others who do not care.   So you can go by an old  saying.
     "Lead,  Follow,  or  get the Hell out of OUR way."  If we  cannot
     live  in  Harmony  with the other Net,  or they  cannot  live  in
     Harmony  with  US then I say we do not live  together.   This  is
     sometimes  called a seperation,  we do not have to get a  Divorce
     but it might be one of our options.

          AS I mentioned earlier,  this is NOT A FLAME, if you take it
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 5                   28 Nov 1988


     that  way  so be it.   But I have a strong feeling Fido Net  will
     survive,  it may not be as big as some folks would like for it to
     be  but  the smooth operation and continued  operation  of  Nodes
     Under  Fido  Net must be with some type of standards.   An  these
     standards  must be reviewed and updated as necessary to meet  the
     changing of the NET.

                  BBX - A New Service For SysOps From Byte/BIX!
                            Pete White 1:322/360

     At a recent meeting of the SysOps here in the Eastern Region we
     were presented with a new service offered by BIX, the electronic
     publishing extension of Byte Magazine.  While the original intent
     was to offer this service to the Boston area only we had the
     opportunity to talk with George Bond, the Executive Editor of BIX
     and he agreed to extend the Charter Membership offer to ALL
     FidoNet SysOps with an additional discount to IFNA members.  I'm
     sure many of you will find it interesting, and if you don't know
     what BIX is the three month trial period for $50 is a fantastic
     and inexpensive way to find out.

     What is the BBX?

     The Bulletin Board Exchange is a new service to be offered this
     fall by BIX (R), the BYTE Information Exchange, to sysops of
     local BBSes. The BBX allows sysops to become publishers of
     information from the Microbytes Daily News Service. It also
     provides an efficient, low-cost way to exchange information
     between BBSes and to conduct BBS network business.

     What do you get?

     1. Daily news and features from BBX/Microbytes to publish on your
        BBS.

              BBX/Microbytes is a custom package of news and features
              designed specially for local BBSes. It will be available
              only to sysops.

              Every Monday through Friday you will get microbytes
              news stories about developments in microcomputing,
              telecommunications, and technology. In addition, each
              Friday you will get First Looks, a Microbytes Feature,
              and hardware and software new product items.

              All of this material is reported, written, and edited by
              BYTE and BIX staff members and correspondents throughout
              the United States and in Europe and Japan.

              Coverage includes reporting from industry trade shows,
              national and international special-interest group
              conferences as the events are going on, looks at
              important work at R&D labs and in college and university
              technical centers.

     2. The monthly Best of BIX to publish on your BBS.

              Each month, you will get the Best of BIX. BoB is just
              what its name implies -- a distillation of the choicest
              material from the conferences of the BYTE Information
              Exchange.  Core areas cover IBM PCs and other MS DOS
              machines, Macintoshs, the Apple // family, Amigas, and
              Atari STs. Other topics -- Unix, the NeXT computer,
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 7                   28 Nov 1988


              object-oriented programming, etc. -- also are covered,
              although not necessarily on a monthly basis.

     3. Use of the BIX computer for mail, message and file transfers.

              You will be able to use the BIX host computer, and the
              Tymnet telecommunications network, not only to collect
              your BBX articles but also to exchange your own
              information with other sysops. BIX will tailor private
              conferences for your use. You may use our host to avoid
              the busy signals that sometimes plague dialup nodes. You
              also can use private conferences to conduct inter-BBS
              business.

              Since most telephones in the United States are only a
              local call away from a Tymnet node, you should be able
              to cut your BBS network telecommunications costs
              sharply.

              Incidentally, BIX -- and the BBX -- are available
              worldwide through the international packet-switching
              networks. It also is available through PC-Pursuit.

     4. And all the rest of BIX for your personal use!

              You will be able browse through the more than 150 public
              conferences on BIX, participate in real-time chat
              sessions, and use our many libraries of files for
              downloading.

     What will this cost you?

     Membership in the BBX will be by subscription only. The regular
     annual membership fee for the BBX and BIX combined will be $199.

     Charter memberships will be available for $160, and special
     3-month trial memberships will be available for $50, but only
     through Dec. 31, 1988.  All IFNA members will receive an
     additional 10% discount.

     Your telecommunications charges are not included in these prices.
     If you live in the Boston area, your only other expense for the
     BBX will be a local phone call (the BIX host computer is in
     Lexington, Mass., and dialup ports are available). If you use
     Tymnet, you will be charged $2 an hour evenings, weekends, and
     and major holidays. Prime-time use is 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays
     and is billed at $8 an hour. All times are your local time, and
     all charges are calculated to the nearest minute.

     How do you subscribe?

     It's easy.  You can call BIX and register on-line.

     Using Tymnet:

     After handshaking is done you will see a line of garbled
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 8                   28 Nov 1988


     characters (or a request for "terminal identifier). Respond with
     a lower-case "a".  You should then get a "please log in" request.
     Respond "bix" and a carraige return.  The next display will be
     the BIX welcome screen, ending with a prompt saying "Name?"
     Enter "ug.bbx" here and you will begin the registration script.
     If you elect to pay with a credit card (AmEx, MC or Visa), you
     will be able to use BIX immediately upon completion of
     registration.  If you decide to prepay for time or to set up a
     corporate account you will have to complete some paperwork before
     you have access to BIX.

     Direct dial:

     If you dial directly to BIX (the direct line is 617-861-9767),
     respond "bix" to the login prompt and enter "ug.bix" at the
     "Name?" prompt.  Continue as with Tymnet from here.

     If you are a member of the IFNA, please leave a mail message to
     "bixbilling" with your membership number and a request for the
     10% IFNA member discount.

     When you register for a year at the cost of $160 and you use the
     BBX capabilities for only 2 hours a week, or 104 hours a year,
     the hourly cost will be approximately $3.538461538 per hour!  And
     this includes Tymnet charges!

     Please direct any questions about BBX to either Mr. George Bond

                      P U N C H - C A R D    C H U M
                            What to do with it
                      A suggestion by Fredric L. Rice
                           (103/503.3 Astro-Net)


     One of the more asked question circulating among the high
     schools and colleges around the Southern California area is
     what possible uses exist for the chum generated by punch cards
     and paper tape.

     At the start of every morning, bright and early, before all of
     the students classes begin, you go around to all the punch card
     machines and collect the chum into a large plastic bag. After
     you have ten pounds or so of the stuff, you pause at the trash
     bin to consider saving it for it may come in handy someday.
     After a moments reflection, you simply toss it away.

     I have a suggestion.

     Towards the end of the high school year, many years ago, my
     brother brought to the computer room a large CO^2 cartridge.
     Along with the cylinder he brought 2000 or so books of matches.

     Now I know a lot of you have tried this and, in fact, it's an
     illegal and highly dangerous, (not to mention stupid), thing to
     do, but you must consider that high school kids with no
     supervision but lots of time on hand will do illegal, dangerous,
     and stupid things.

     At first, match heads went into the cartridge, being packed
     down as sulfur was added. Next came match heads mixed with the
     paper tape and punch card chum. A variety of mixes were tested
     to see which burned nicely without being too explosive when
     packed down. It was hoped that a linear acceleration curve
     could be acquired by regulating the rate at which material was
     expelled. After some four pounds of chum was mixed in, we were
     ready to play.

     Normally a launch tube is required but since there was none at
     hand, a teletype roll of paper was used. Also a slight
     inclination is needed to acquire a nice, flat, trajectory. For
     this, we used the computer rooms door jam. This door looked
     out over a short playing field, (currently in use but soon to
     be not in use), then over a road and on out into the Orange
     County Fair Grounds.

     After setting the cylinder inside the paper roll and propping
     it up on both sides with magnetic DEC tapes so it wouldn't
     roll, the rest of us took up our bunker positions. Me behind
     one teletype, Robert behind the other; Allen, Bob, and at least
     two others hidden behind a table tipped onto its side before
     the window. A spot was reserved close to the door for my
     brother, the winner of the lottery. It was hoped that he might
     be able to jump far enough behind the book case to avoid any
     problems which might occurs after igniting the thing.
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 10                  28 Nov 1988


     My brother bent down over the cartridge and put a match to its
     nozzle. After the briefest amount of smoke issued from the
     nozzle, he was somehow behind the book case and down before any
     of us could see him take his first step.

     It's unsettling to note that while this was going on, classes
     were being held to either side of us and students were walking
     past the door looking in and wondering what we were up to... We
     didn't mind killing a Freshmen or two and had at times dumped
     them off the second floor walkaways into the bushes below.

     It's also interesting to remember another occasion a year before
     where a friend of mine, Mike, was trying to constrict the
     nozzle of a much smaller CO^2 cylinder in a futile attempt to
     gain more velocity. After stuffing it full of sulfur, he took a
     soldering iron to it and tried to seal the end up with a match
     head sticking out. A strong lad but somewhat lacking in brain.

     He only lost two fingers and the use of a third but I imagine
     it could have been worse. I mean, the guy was holding the thing
     at the time. In his lap. I also imagine that he will some day
     run for president.

     Where was I? Oh, yes...

     Libya uses Dynamite. Iran uses C4. I'd rather use match heads.

     What happened after the thing was lit is unclear, even after
     the investigation, but I can tell you that its explosion was
     heard all over that campus, across the street, and all over
     Orange Coast College.

     Looking over the computer room filled with reeking smoke, I
     could see the carpet on fire from one side of the room to the
     other. Burning match heads and punch card chum was sprayed all
     over the floor, teletypes, modems and CRT's. Parts of the
     paper roll had been blown through the ceiling and much of it
     was never found.

     Stupid? Yes... But we used some of that useless chum.

                            A Reason For Gating

     There's a considerable  amount of controversy  in several of  our
     echoconferences on the subject of using gates between the various
     nets.  While I see literally hundreds of messages giving  various
     political reasons  for and  against the  implementation of gates,
     there seem to be very few discussing the technical reasons.   I'm
     certainly not  qualified to  discuss the  technical reasoning for
     the necessity of using gates and would welcome seeing  commentary
     here  in  FidoNews  explaining  the  positive as well as negative
     aspects of using gates between networks.  To me there's no reason
     to continue to discuss the political aspects, especially after  a
     recent check showed  that when the  AlterNet, EggNet and  FidoNet
     nodelists were all  added together there  were only 92  nodes NOT
     listed in  the FidoNet  nodelist.   I would  hope all would agree
     that  long  political  discussions  on  something  that presently
     appears to impact so few is ludicrous.

     There is one positive side to  gating that few seem to take  into
     consideration.  Technology changes rapidly and a smaller net  has
     the capability of changing technology much more quickly and  more
     easily  than  a  large  net.    A  net  the size of AlterNet, for
     example, could change the software it uses for handling mail with
     little or no  difficulty.  I  shudder to think  of what it  would
     take to make the same change within FidoNet, unless efforts  were
     made to  continue backwards  compatibility.   And I've  been told
     that  maintaining   backwards  compatibility   while  introducing
     totally new  concepts is  what has  driven many  a programmer  to
     drink.

     If  we  support  the  use  of  gates  we  support  the  growth of
     technology within our  hobby.  Forcing  everyone to use  the same
     technology inhibits the technical  genius we have available,  and
     there's certainly a lot of it out there.  If we continue to think
     of the gate issue as a political one we might see someone winning
     the political battle while we all lose the technological war.

     Which do YOU feel is most important?

     Sapphire: A Revolutionary New Kind of BBS
     ------------------------------------------

     MONTREAL  --  Pinnacle  Software,  in association with Le Systeme
     OnLine, is introducing a shareware BBS system known as Sapphire.

     Pinnacle Software is best known for the Pyroto  Mountain  system,
     which   integrates  a  game  with  a  BBS.   Pyroto  can  be  run
     stand-alone, or as a door. An estimated 75,000 people dial into a
     Pyroto system, every week.

     Now Pinnacle Software is addressing  the  mainstream  BBS  world.
     Sapphire   offers   messaging,   events-processing,  doors,  file
     transfer and full ANSI colour.

     Sapphire does not use menus, or single-letter commands.   Rather,
     it  uses  word  commands, such as READ or SEND.  As a result, all
     functions are available at a single level; there is  no  need  to
     "navigate" through the system to find the function you're looking
     for.

     Sapphire is both powerful and user-friendly.  Especially powerful
     are the TEXT and NAMES functions, which enable the user to filter
     output  according to imbedded text, or the name of the people (or
     files) that they are  interested  in.   Thus,  with  only  a  few
     commands,  the  user can phrase a request such as: "Display every
     message on any message base, sent in the last  three  days,  that
     was  written  by  Tony  or Mary, in which he or she mentioned the
     word Computer or Fido or Modem".

     Doors are installed  directly,  as  commands.   Because  of  this
     approach, doors are integrated into the system more smoothly.  Up
     to 25 doors can be installed.

     Up  to  10  events  can  be defined.  Installing an event is very
     easy.  You specify the time of the event  and  the  name  of  the
     batch  file  to  be executed.  The batch file doesn't require any
     special modification to work with Sapphire.  Thus, any batch file
     you may have could be called as a Sapphire event.  Return to  the
     BBS is automatic.

     The  main  attraction  of  Sapphire,  however,  is  that  it is a
     "Zero-Maintenance BBS".  Once it is installed, the only task  for
     the  sysop  is  validation. The message-base is self-maintaining.
     The files function  automatically  keeps  the  500  most  popular
     programs available.  The user list is automatically maintained --
     removing  inactive  users  when  necessary. Absolutely everything
     about Sapphire is automatic.  This makes  it  ideal  for  stores,
     consultants,  new  sysops -- and experienced sysops who are tired
     of their labour-intensive BBS software.

     Sapphire is now undergoing beta-testing at two sites in Montreal,
     with  a  scheduled  release  date  of  December  7th,  1988.    A
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 13                  28 Nov 1988


     stand-alone  system  runs  at  300-1200  baud,  at  514-331-6791.
     Another system, running under Binkley, runs at 300-9600USR  baud,
     at 514-286-1703 (Fido 1:167/161).

     For more information about Sapphire, you can contact Tim Campbell
     at  514-331-6791, or James Ludwick at 514-844-1374.  Or  you  can
     pick  up the PYROTO EchoMail conference, which now deals with all
     of  Pinnacle  Software's  telecommunications  products   (Pyroto,
     Vortex, Sapphire, etc.).

     After  December  7,  1988,  you  may   file   request  "SAPPHIRE"
     from 1:167/161.

     >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Editor's Note <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

     While this article does contain language that I would normally
     refuse to print (almost a first for me). I do believe it contains
     some information that should be brought out. I myself hadn't
     looked at the article until Tom Jennings sent me some netmail
     asking if it had been printed. The article itself really should
     have gone out before the elections earlier this month.
     Unfortunately, it didn't quite match specs and it sat around
     until TJ brought my attention to it.

     Once again, I repeat. THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE AND
     CONTENT. IT IS BEING PRINTED AS A COURTESY TO TOM JENNINGS AND
     BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT CONTAINS INFORMATION THAT MANY OF US ARE
     UNAWARE OF THAT CONCERNS US.

     FIDONEWS EDITOR:

     This article was intended as self-therapy after the particular
     night in question. (Read it, you'll see!) I wrote it intending to
     publish it in two punk magazines, where the language used won't
     stand out.

     It will (ahem) stand out in FidoNews. I don't know what the
     policy, if any, is these days on submissions. The language is
     strong but so is the content. It's not fiction.

     Saturday, 22 Oct 88

     There's some new NBC TV series, made in San Francisco, ``Midnight
     Caller'', to be aired starting 25 Oct. I don't have a TV so I
     know nothing about it. One particular episode is scripted to go
     like this: there's a nasty bisexual man who knows he's infected
     with the HIV virus, deliberately fucking and infecting his women
     lovers. (I suppose if he was fucking guys no one would care, so
     they made it women.)

     The producer, John Perry, told the Sentinel (SF newspaper)
     ``Every episode will leave you with a thought provoking
     process.'' I'm sure. (This is the same studio, Lorrimar, that
     brought you gems like ``Cruising'', another gay-exploitation
     movie.)

     This is just too much. It's one too many outright assault. It's
     plain and simple, saying ``oh those AIDS faggots, see? this is
     what could happen, there are people like that out there!''. The
     argument is that since potentially anyone could do that
     (remember: we are all potential criminals at all times) we must
     control them, its for our own good, see.


     Saturday, 22 Oct 88

     This morning someone pointed a gun at me. He called me a
     ``faggot''.

     My car was getting a new muffler (all by itself). I walked down
     to pick it up. I waited for the light; crossed Folsom St. Wait
     for the light; cross 5th St. (There's lots of traffic, see; new
     Nordstrum's opened, new consumer shrine only two blocks away.
     Light changes, I walk, cars go. Late model clean bright red
     fashionable ``sporty'' toyocar makes left turn, behind me. I
     glance briefly at the car, absolutely ordinary event (safe
     distances, etc)

     The guy is looking at me. He says ``Fuck you faggot!'', so of
     course social obligation, I flip him off. He pulls into the bus
     stop, yelling ``come over here faggot!'', etc. I flip him off,
     he's still yelling. I wave no-like, I shut up, keep walking,
     don't look back for a minute or so. (ie. remove myself from this
     nuts life.) What the hell is his problem? Gee, I must look like
     some silly nelly queen to him: I'm 6 foot 4, black leather
     jacket, 1/4" buzzed hair, dark round shades, grungy black jeans
     rolled up, Doc-Martens boots, I haven't shaved or showered since
     Thursday morning, in other words, I ain't pretty; plus, fer shits
     sake, I just woke up!

     I glance back, he's gone, driven off to wherever he's going.
     Adrenalin time: but I keep walking, I only have to go one block
     to get my car. Deep breaths, I start to cool out. I'm not stupid,
     so I watch for the idiots car, it's all one way streets it's
     easy. Zoom! There he is: pulls over, opens door, yells more
     ``faggot'' shit, then while sitting in the drivers seat (neatly
     combed & cut black hair, dark aviator glasses, plain dark T-
     shirt) waggles a gun at me, nice new long barrel medium caliber
     autoloader, maybe target pistol. I'm standing beside a van,
     wierd, but I get angry not scared; plus he obviously doesn't know
     what he's doing with that gun, it's pointing all over but at me.
     I say something stupid then bolt quick as shit to video store
     doorway, then have the presence of mind to look for a license
     plate, etc, but he was gone.

     Now comes the real adrenalin. Stupid junk it is too; great I'm
     sure for rolling in the mud gnashing teeth locked arm to arm with
     a mortal enemy, but pretty useless in an urban environment when I
     need my brain, I can make my body follow as I need thank you.

     Great, I'm in the muffler shop waiting to pay for and drive away
     my car. Here I am in the throes of full-blast adrenalin, panting
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 16                  28 Nov 1988


     and shaking, microsecond reflexes, predator body motions, trying
     to smile to the other customers, ``Oh hi, I'm just here to pick
     up my car, ha ha.'' Yow!

     So NBC wants to film this particular episode, the part where the
     guy gets shot by one of his victims, in a gay neighborhood. The
     script, leaked to ACT-UP (``AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power'' --
     gay political activists who put their energy and asses on the
     line for all of us -- gay or not -- and in SF here has lots of
     homopunks and punk gays) leaked allegedly by an NBC employee with
     decent ethical standards. (Thank you.)

     Revenge killing at the end: the guy gets blown away, the Health
     Dep't shows up in full body ``radiation'' type suits, seal the
     body into a bag marked ``DANGER: BIOHAZARD''.

     This is so sick, so horrible, so dangerous it's almost beyond
     belief. It's just wrong, wrong, wrong, the implied ``facts'' are
     just plain, wrong.

     I'll leave the information-getting up to you but listen to this
     doo-doos: you have to WORK HARD to get AIDS. Like, use a needle
     that has the fresh blood from someone who has AIDS still in it;
     getting screwed in the ass by a guy with AIDS who comes. That's
     about it. Women getting it from men sexually is very uncommon.
     Men getting it from women sexually is, I believe, unheard of.

     Is that simple enough?

     Most people are totally and completely ignorant of what the hell
     is going on. Do you really know what AIDS is? Do you understand
     how information is transmitted in this culture? Do you know how
     your brain soaks up the crap you are immersed in?


     Saturday, 22 Oct 88

     In California, there is this state Proposition #96, which stated,
     basically, if you are arrested for any reason (say at a protest
     or whatever) and there is ``reason to believe'' you ``may'' have
     transmitted ``bodily fluids'' to a police officer, (like if he
     claims you spit at him) you can be detained for HIV antibody
     testing. They detain you, they administer the test, they tell you
     the results. Results are not confidential.

     1.      ``Reason to believe'' means their whim
     2.      ``may'' means at the cops whim
     3.      ``bodily fluids'' (see below)
     4.      you obviously do not have to be gay

     [As an example of the very specific mis-information being spread,
     ``bodily fluids'' used to be a euphemism for, mainly, cum: semen
     and the lubricating fluid produced by the male testes. Also,
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 17                  28 Nov 1988


     blood and direct by-products, plasma, clotting-factor VIII used
     for haemophiliacs, etc. So-called family newspapers (and nearly
     everyone else) just plain doesn't like to say ``cum''. Somehow it
     came to mean everything, including spit and sweat and tears.
     Medically, in regarding HIV virus transmission, it does not mean
     spit, tears, sweat, etc. Is that plain enough for you? See how
     this works?]

     OK, so when/if you go to a demonstration, (``Food Not Bombs'',
     Greenpeace, Earth First!, Bush in town, whatever) there's always
     a slight, maybe minimal, chance you'll be arrested. Some people
     push their luck more than others. Normally getting arrested under
     such circumstances is no big deal; you're out pretty quick, on
     bail or personal recognizance. (I've never been arrested, and
     hope to keep it that way.)

     This adds a new dimension to political dissent, no? OK, so you,
     reading this, you may not be gay, and you're probably HIV
     negative (ie. uninfected). That does not matter. YOU CAN STILL BE
     TESTED. Explain to your friends, when the paper says ``...those
     arrested at today's demonstration were detained for testing for
     the deadly AIDS virus...''. Try to explain that they test people
     to terrorize, it doesn't mean they really didn't have any reason
     to test you.

     Oh I forgot: Though we'll still get to vote this Nov. 8 on Prop.
     #96, it's already been implemented; it went through the state
     legislature or something, I don't understand the process. This is
     pretty much in effect now, in California.

     I will only briefly mention Proposition #102, which says: there
     will be no anonymous HIV testing in CA; all positives ie.
     presumed infected) must be reported to public health authorities;
     people testing positive required by law to compile lists of all
     sexual contact for public health authorities. Testing allowed for
     jobs or insurance. Why the list compiling? AIDS is not a casually
     contagious disease.

     This is to be voted upon Nov. 8. the last ``poll'' I recall
     (don't you love those mysterious authoritative polls?) had it
     posted at 72% in favor of Prop. #102, though previous ``polls''
     on similar state propositions said similar things, but were
     resoundly defeated anyways.

     Now do you get what this is all about?


     Saturday, 22 Oct 88

     I'm walking with Duke down Haight St., we're going into Mendel's
     so's I can buy paint pens to finish my HOMOCORE logo on my
     jacket. New crop of skinheads talking amongst themselves as we go
     by: ``...man, there's lotsa fags in this town...''

     Look, right now it's 2:00AM, I can't fucking sleep. I am wired.
     The only thing that keeps me cool headed at all is my wonderful
     boyfriend Michael is coming down to visit me from WA state next
     week (we met at the '88 Toronto Anarchist Gathering) that
     homopunk makes me happy!

     They really are planning on filming that ugly thing. This script
     is no accident, it's pure exploitation of the worst kind, oh, its
     just a bunch of faggots I guess, huh? ``...thought provoking
     process.'' Yeah right. Oh, people say, but some people do do
     that, so it's not like they're lying or anything. Right. Hey, a
     black guy raped a white lady, well, they're like that, you know?

     NBC got a restraining order against ACT-UP and specific ACT-UP
     people; they are quite intent on filming this thing. (At Gilman
     St. Project we couldn't get a restraining order against some
     people who had been harrassing us at the club over a period of
     months.) If they just show up they get arrested, no questions
     asked. The mayor doesn't want to ``interfere with their First
     Amendment rights''. First Amendment rights do not include the
     right to yell ``fire!'' in a crowded room.

     It's not gonna happen. People are not going to let it happen.
     This ain't Politically-Correct demonstrations guys, this is my
     life, and your lives, literally, there are assholes out there
     looking for someone to hate, to vent their slimy thoughts on.
     Faggots are real handy. Anyone who stands out will do. Think you
     have to actually be gay? Who's next?

     I mean, like what am I going to do, personally, about this
     filming business? It can't happen. Yeah, sure they can just do it
     somewhere else, in some other city, but this means we should
     allow them to do it in our own neighborhoods? Well, maybe someone
     there in that other city will give them a hard time too. ACT-UP
     has so far done a really good job, on a few minutes notice they
     show up and make noise and diversions that effectively stops the
     filming. Hence the restraining order. This filming can't happen,
     in gay neighborhoods no less; there's good ole boys driving
     around looking for fags to beat up, all they need is an excuse
     and a good TV shot of an actual street with homos on it to make
     it easier.

     There aren't ``gay'' issues vs. straight ones. Sexuality is part
     of your personal human freedom, it's your damn business not mine.
     The very fact that you might get uptight and upset thinking about
     different kinds of sexuality means that {\it you were taught
     well, you believe the lies, you will do their job for them},
     we're put into smaller and smaller categories until no one will
     defend their own neighbors and friends, and therefore themselves.

     Do you, or I, have to get killed by some fag-basher to make a
     point or what? Do you understand what this is all about yet?

                 An Introduction of Bob Rudolph (261/628)


     But first a word from our sponsor.  Sponsor?  We ain't got no
     sponsor!  Ah, but yes, you folks who read these articles are the
     sponsor.  Didn't know that?  Now you do.

     I've had pretty fair luck getting response from folks when I ask
     'em to send me some information so that I can prepare a FidoNews
     article, but I inhabit a pretty narrow circle in FidoNet.  Soon
     you readers will be tired of seeing *C types and IFNA types here.
     So here's what I want you to do -- YOU send mail to those folks
     who would fit well in this column.  That's bound to work better
     than my sending them mail.  But send me mail, too, and if I can
     find 'em in the nodelist I will prompt them with my little ques-
     tionaire.

     Now, down to business.  This week our subject is Bob Rudolph, the
     current president of IFNA.  Next week we'll talk about Don
     Daniels, last year's IFNA president.

     I've heard of people doing things because they were hit up the
     side of the head with a 2X4. . . Bob's involvement in BBS'ing
     began when his wife managed to drop a 2X10 on her big toe.  This
     happy event turned him into a temporary house-husband and tele-
     commuter with a PC at home.  Not knowing much about PC's, Bob
     invited one of the PC gurus from the office to help him set
     things up, and of course was supplied with a list of local
     bulletin board systems.  Within a couple of months, Bob had
     developed a telephone bill so large that the phone company gave
     him the option of either paying it or taking on the debt of a
     third-world country.

     Bob's wife recovered, and he returned the PC to the office, but
     he had been infected by the BBS bug.  Influenced by John Madill's
     Fido (#2, now 261/2), Bob started his own Fido system and joined
     net 109 when FidoNet numbered less than 800.  Initially his BBS
     was a general file system (and consumed massive amounts of disk
     space), but the appearance of echomail led Bob to convert his
     system to a conversation place.  His current system, Liberty
     Hall, grew out of the old Reindeer Shed, becoming a support-for-
     sysops and general conversation board with 70 echo areas and
     TradeWars for the game freaks.

     Bob has been NC for net 261 since net 109 got unweildy and
     Baltimore fell off.  He is also NC for AlterNet 521.  After
     joining IFNA in the beginning and ending up on the Board to
     replace a resigned member, Bob was reelected, and selected at
     FidoCon as IFNA's President.
     FidoNews 5-48                Page 20                  28 Nov 1988


     One of the target audiences for Bob's system is mainframers,
     since that is how he earns his living.  Bob is a systems program-
     mer and has worked in both large and small shops.  His specialty
     is CICS (which will mean little to most of you who think MS-DOS
     is too complicated as an operting system), in VM, VSE, and MVS
     environments.

     Between the sysgens and the echomail, Bob retains his sanity with
     other activities.  He sings in the church choir (his wife is the
     director), is a sometimes motorcyclist, and is an avid reader
     with a paperback collection of around 2000.  One of his comments
     struck a special nerve with me -- "I have been involved with
     photography and will doubtless be involved with it again one fine
     day."  Ah, for time to do everything we want. . .

     As he puts it, Bob is a "retired fat guy", and co-founder of the
     FAT_TABLE echo (with John Lamb on the west coast) for folks on
     weight-loss programs.  He likes to blay bridge, but not for
     blood.  And he's something of a jazz afficionado.  At the next
     FidoCon perhaps we can organize a friendly bridge game with low-
     calorie snacks, and jazz in the background . . .

     Bob's wife is a piano and voice teacher (good thing she didn't
     drop that 2X10 on a wrist), and they have been married nearly 21
     years.  Just in case Bob doesn't have enough irons in the fire,
     they have three children -- Jamie is 15, Jessica 11 (going on
     17), and Elizabeth 6.

                      Yet Another Complicated Komment

                            by Steven K. Hoskin
                        ( STEVE HOSKIN at 1:128/31 )

                            Episode 18:  Burnout


     Ever get tired of the same old problems?  The same stresses?  The
     same tireless rampage  of  life's  idiosyncrasies?   Welcome to a
     condition commonly called "Burnout".

     You'll see a lot of that here in FidoNet.  Let's face it, most of
     us SysOp types are just a wee bit  strange.  After all, who would
     do this for the heck of it?    I  got  looked at kinda funny when
     somebody  found  out  that,  in  this  three  bedroom  house,  my
     housemate and  I  each  took  the  smaller  bedrooms  and put our
     computer equipment in the MASTER bedroom.

     Hey, we knew where our priorities were.

     So, people who get into  FidoNet  usually  GET INTO FidoNet.  And
     for some reason, SysOps also  tend  to be a pretty short-tempered
     bunch.  Haven't  figured  that  one  out  yet.    We'll spend all
     weekend or three working nights getting our hardware and software
     to run right but won't  give  the  guy  at  the  other end of the
     EchoMail conference 45 seconds  before  we slam on the REPLY key.
     Guilty?  You bet.  I've done it  as  much as [almost] anybody has
     out there.  And I'm the long-winded type.

     Anyway, with that many  people  constantly  slamming each other's
     views, it comes as no  surprise  that,  out of the blue, somebody
     will throw their hands up and say "Bye!  I've had it!".

     Well, my recent case  of  burnout  wasn't  in  FidoNet, it was at
     work.  But I somehow failed to take a lesson to work with me that
     I have been slowly learning  (very  slowly) here in this fabulous
     network.  Pull out FidoNews 5-24 sometime.  James Zachary wrote a
     story called "Indios".    In  it  a  member of an electronic mail
     hobby network is losing his temper  over flames and fights and is
     about to start striking back  when  the  Indian who maintains his
     apartment complex intervenes.    By  the  end  of the debate, the
     hobbyist is calmed  down  and  willing  to  take  Indios' advise:
     "Take what is good  with  this  and  all  else  in life and leave
     behind what is bad."(1)

     I guess some of us are slow learners.
