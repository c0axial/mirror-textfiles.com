              Trials and Tribulations of a Software Publisher

     It's not easy being a  software  publisher.  Even  a  small  one.
     Probably  the hardest part is getting noticed.  There are so many
     companies publishing software these days that it's tough  to  get
     anyone  to pay any attention to you.  Of course,  it can be done.
     All it takes is money.  Where have I heard that before?

     If you haven't got money, then it gets rough.  In theory, all you
     need to do is build a better mousetrap and the world will beat  a
     path to your door.  In practice, that isn't usually true.

     The shareware concept is helping there.  (No,  this isn't another
     shareware editorial.  Well,  not exactly.  Sit down right now and
     write  out  checks for all of the shareware you're using.  End of
     commercial.) I've spoken to a few other shareware authors lately,
     and it does seem that it is finally  becoming  a  viable  way  to
     market a product.  Two weeks ago I'd have said that not more than
     a  half  dozen  shareware authors actually got anywhere.  Now I'm
     not so sure.  There might just be quite a few  people  out  there
     getting by on shareware income, which is good.

     I  tend to be cynical.  When we first released ARC I didn't think
     anybody would pay for it.  When the first check  came  in  I  was
     astounded.  We  were torn between cashing it and framing it.  (We
     compromised;  we cashed it and framed a Xerox  copy.)  I've  been
     pleasantly  surprised,  over  and over.  People are better than I
     ever would have imagined.

     And yes,  the user supported software concept  works  both  ways.
     The  new  compression  stuff  in  ARC  5.0 took a lot of work.  I
     wouldn't have done it if I hadn't known that people cared.

     I was asked recently what it takes for  a  shareware  product  to
     "succeed".  I  said  all  the  usual,  it has to be good,  and do
     something popular, and be cheap; but then another thought came to
     me.  You have to be serious.  You have  to  seriously  treat  the
     product as a commercial offering, with all that that entails.  It
     means  doing the customer support,  answering the letters and the
     phone calls,  being responsive to users'  needs,  and  everything
     else.  It's  not  enough to slap a shareware notice on it and let
     it go.  You have to be willing to follow through.  If  you  don't
     take it seriously, then nobody else will, either.

     As a side note:  Our printer swears that we'll  have  the  SEAdog
     manuals by this Wednesday at the latest.  We'll start shipping as
     soon  as  we  get  them.  Meanwhile,  I've seen the SEAdog manual
     covers.  You've gotta see them to believe  them.  They're,  well,
     They're  distinctive.  I'm  actually not sure whether I like them
     or not.  But they're certainly eye catching.

                              Amigo or Amiga?


         Everyone by now knows about the Amiga.  Of course,  there are
     still  those  that  can't  pronounce  it  right.  They say Amigo,
     Omega, Ammago, etc.  It's not that tough a word to pronounce, but
     alas,  some Commodore folks STILL have problems.  In fact,  I was
     at  our Users' Group meeting (MCUG) watching a Commodore official
     demonstrate the then unreleased Amiga.  After he  was  done,  the
     president of our club decided to say a few words about the Amiga.
     What  did  he  say?  He said "Omega." I think several people were
     ready to scramble his brains, at least I was!

         Anyway,  the Amiga marks Commodore's first  effort  to  break
     into  the  business  arena of computers.  They have tried hard to
     give the Amiga its own image and not one of Commodore.  They have
     even go so far as to politely as magazine reporters and others to
     refer to the  Amiga  as  "the  Amiga  from  Commodore,"  not  the
     "Commodore Amiga." But can Commodore be successful?

         The  Commodore  64  and Vic 20 were the computers to actually
     put Commodore on the  map.  Color  AND  sound  for  under,  gasp,
     $1000!  The sound is still unrivaled by many a computer, save for
     the  new  Amiga.  Of  course,  back then was the good old days of
     Jack Tramiel,  then he decided to leave and purchase  Atari.  The
     new  Commodore has managed to botch everything up.  Remember that
     Plus/4 and the Commodore 16?  They were supposed to  replace  the
     64, ha!  That was new Commodore's first mistake.

         Their  second  mistake was the Amiga.  No,  not the computer.
     It's a masterpiece of work.  I am referring to  their  marketing.
     Of  course  the  Amiga  could  compete  with the IBM PC on a pure
     technical level.  But who are they fooling?  The IBM  PC  is  THE
     computer for business.  Whether it is a good or bad machine, it's
     entrenched  in the daily lives of American business.  So why does
     the new Commodore still try to compete with the IBM PC, let alone
     IBM PC AT?  They're stupid.

         Now look at Atari with Jack Tramiel.  He has come out with  a
     $999,   1   megabyte  computer  that  rivals  the  Amiga.   Well,
     technically it is inferior,  but at that price who  cares?  Atari
     has so far been smart.  They've attacked the Macintosh and Amiga.
     They  don't  really  seem to be worried about the IBM PC.  What I
     mean is that they are selling to the home, not the business.  But
     who does Commodore  continue  to  put  in  all  their  comparison
     charts?  The  IBM  PC,  IBM  PC AT,  and the Macintosh.  You will
     never see the Atari ST's in a  Commodore  comparison  chart.  But
     who do you see in the Atari comparison charts?  The Amiga and the
     Macintosh and yes, the IBM PC AT, but you'll notice they included
     Fidonews                     Page 4                    7 Apr 1986


     the Amiga.

         Let's  face  it,  if you put a base model IBM PC,  IBM PC AT,
     Amiga,  Macintosh,  and Atari 520 ST together the overall  better
     one  is  the  Amiga.  Remember  I said BASE model.  The Amiga has
     excellent graphics, sound,  and built-in multitasking.  It's also
     faster  than  all  of  them  except for the ST (8.00 MHZ) and the
     Macintosh (7.63 MHZ).  But when you  include  the  Amiga's  (7.16
     MHZ) coppers (co-processors) it is overall faster except for pure
     number-crunching.  Now IBM users,  here's where you win out.  The
     IBM has the following features:  (1) a financially sound company,
     (2) 100% IBM compatibility,  (3) lots of third-party support, (4)
     and lots of your employers may use IBM's so you can work somewhat
     at home.

         In fact,  this is another place where Commodore  has  screwed
     up. $600 for IBM compatibility?  Then, if you want it to actually
     run as FAST as an IBM,  you must buy the Enhancer ($100 to $200).
     That's ridiculous.  On top of all this, I have heard that the IBM
     Emulator is less than 95% compatible.  For the price of Amiga/IBM
     compatibility,  you could purchase a Tandy 1000 or a  bare  Tandy
     1200 that is MUCH more compatible.

         As  far  as  the Amiga and the Macintosh go,  well.  With the
     original Macintosh, the Amiga obviously is far superior.  I don't
     know about the newer Macs though.

         The main thesis of this article,  though,  is really  whether
     the  new  Commodore  is  doing an adequate job of advertising and
     marketing the Amiga.  I think they are doing the worst they  have
     ever done.  My main qualm about the Amiga is its price: $2000 for
     512K,  monitor,  drive,  and  computer/OS.  This is ridiculous if
     they want to succeed.  As you know, Commodore is on its last legs
     unless they do something drastic.  The 1040 ST  from  Atari  just
     may be the final straw that breaks the camel's back.

         Please  send  any  responses  to  me  at Uticom (120/5) or on
     QuantumLink to "MikeR1" or to "CommoLore".

     Fido 123/4/6

                              Getting Hooked!

     I'd like to see if any of you fido nuts  can  identify  with  the
     following story.  Believe it or not it's all TRUE.

     Computer  addiction  is  a word that was not in my vocabulary six
     months ago, but since I discovered modems well...

     It all started on a warm night in July 1985.  I decided to buy  a
     computer so the kids could practice math,  spelling, etc.  (sound
     familiar?)

     I decided  to  buy  a  Commodore  64  because  the  software  was
     plentiful  and cheap.  I know CBM seems to be a taboo word in the
     Fido Net, but keep reading you might learn something.

     First, the kids started asking for more programs;  then,  my wife
     got hooked on CBM graphics (games).  Four months later I began to
     wonder,  if  there  was a cheaper way to get new programs to keep
     them all happy.

     That is when someone at work mentioned the local  bulletin  board
     system  as a source.  I gathered my pennies and went to the local
     Target Store and purchased the only modem they had  at  the  time
     (one  called  Modem Master).  The directions in the manual seemed
     simple and the software's menu screens  seemed  "friendly"  right
     from  the  start,  so  off  I went into the world of the bulletin
     board.

     After several near misses with "kiddy pirate boards",  I happened
     upon a phone number for Fido Grapevine 123/4, so I called.  I did
     not find any CBM software, but I did find a whole new world.  The
     world of Fido Net.

     At  first,  I  was  overwhelmed by the system,  but thanks to the
     novice prompt default I  soon  became  good  at  moving  through,
     commenting on, and entering message conversations.

     Next, came text file transfers like the Fido Newsletter.  This is
     where  the Modem Master software let me down.  I could download a
     file alright,  but when I tried to read or print the file  all  I
     got  was  a  bunch  of  graphic  characters  on the screen or the
     printer.

     I must have made dozens of phone calls,  trying to find out  why,
     but no one could tell me (I didn't know about the Commodore Users
     Group in town).  Finally one night,  Earl Bates (Sysop 123/4) and
     I were comparing the  ASCII  codes  of  his  Tandy  1100  and  my
     Commodore.  BINGO!  I discovered CBM ASCII (PETASCII to some).  I
     looked and looked for an ASCII translator program but I could not
     find  one.  Finally,  I  decided  that  I'd  write my own (I have
     software degree).  I did and it works, slow, but it works.  Now I
     could print those files, wow, was I proud!
     Fidonews                     Page 6                    7 Apr 1986


     Next, enter a new Fido board in town called Fido Hydrant (123/6).
     Bingo again,  there on my screen were several  terminal  programs
     that  supported  automatic ASCII translation.  My search was over
     (or so I thought).

     I suspect many Fido Sysops are not familiar with "other" types of
     computer systems other than the big namers (IBM,  Compaq,  etc.);
     therefore, I will try to explain PETASCII as I know it.  PETASCII
     is  a  non  industry  standard ASCII code that Commodore Business
     Machines,  Inc.  came up with to support many of  their  personal
     computers.  The major differences between industry standard ASCII
     and PETASCII as viewed on the screen are:

        1) Upper  and  lower  case  reversal - this occurs because the
           character codes for PETASCII upper case characters are  the
           same  as  industry  standard  ASCII  lower case characters.
           Upper  case  characters  in  the  industry  standard  ASCII
           translate to the graphics character set on the C-64.

        2) CBM  64  does  not  require  a  line  feed after a carriage
           return;  therefore,  any text file uploaded to  a  standard
           ASCII  board  will  be seen as one long line rather than as
           intended (line length less than 80  characters).  Any  text
           file  download  from  a standard ASCII board to a C-64 will
           appear double spaced.

     If any C-64 users reading this are in need of  terminal  programs
     that support automatic translation I suggest they either download
     CBTerm from the CBSig on Compuserve or call Fido Hydrant 123/6 in
     Memphis (901) 353-4563 24hr;  also,  if there are some sysops out
     there who have C-64 users on their board that are having the same
     trouble as I did I suggest you do your non-IBM'ers  a  favor  and
     provide  these  files  for them to download.  Hydrant has several
     terminal programs available that do automatic  ASCII  translation
     and  support  both  x-modem  and  punter  protocol.  In addition,
     CBTerm also supports disk  to  disk  downloading  and  uploading.
     This  allows the C-64 user the luxury of downloading files longer
     than their buffers will allow.  Buffer downloading on the C-64 is
     usually  limited  to  around  30  to  40  thousand  bytes.   Fido
     Newsletters are longer than this!!

     It  was  just  about this time that I learned of a new modem that
     was within my price  range.  It  was  called  the  64  Modem  and
     supported auto dialing.  This was a real eye opener.  I no longer
     had  to  stay  glued  to  the computer while trying to check into
     Fido!

     Everything seemed fine because  now  I  had  a  Fido  board  that
     supported CBM and the files were keeping everyone happy,  until I
     ran into a file that was so long I did not have  enough  time  to
     download it.

     It  was  about  this time that I learned of a new 1200 baud modem
     that supports Hayes commands (Commodore Model  1670).  I  finally
     saved  enough pennies to buy one ($186.00) and rushed home to try
     it out.  To my disappointment,  CBTerm would not  run  it,  so  I
     Fidonews                     Page 7                    7 Apr 1986


     started  a  search  for  another  terminal  program.  After  many
     downloads and searching I finally discovered that the reason that
     CBTerm would not run the 1670 properly was because I had both  my
     disk  drives  online  at  the  same time.  CBTerm will operate at
     either 300 or 1200 baud and WILL operate the 1670 modem  properly
     IF  only one 1541 disk drive is hooked up!  In a few weeks I will
     try to provide a detailed look at CBTerm for the  CBM  user,  but
     for  now  I  will just say that it is the best terminal program I
     have used to date.

     So now I'm stuck with 1200 baud (fastest the C-64 will run), high
     telephone bills, and computer widow for a wife.

     I doubt that this story is one of a kind.  If you would  like  to
     comment  send  Fidomail  to  Fido Hydrant 123/6 or Fido Grapevine
     123/4.

     Tom Jennings
     Fido 125/1

             It's probably old news,  but Fido 125/1,  the  old  "Fido
     #1",  is  temporarily dead.  An actual hard disk crash;  aluminum
     shavings inside the drive.  Not too good.  Not only that, I broke
     the  machine  while trying to fix it,  so I tossed it in a closet
     and took the opportunity to take  a  long  needed  vacation  from
     running a BBS.

             The  vacation is temporary;  Fido will be up again once I
     replace  the  hardware.   I'm  building  a   computer   to   use.
     (Industrial,  not  commercial  grade components:  Intel Multibuss
     based,  300W supply,  hard disk no  floppies,  no  CRT,  fan  and
     automotive  air filter.) Since I don't have a DTC Host Adapter to
     bolt the Xebec to the buss,  I gotta rewrite my ROM,  and write a
     parallel port driver, which of course I keep putting off.

             Anyone  have a Data Technology Corp.  DTC-86 Host Adapter
     for the Multibuss?  I'll pay a reasonable sum for one. New, used,
     I don't care.  If I get one, I can have the machine up in a week,
     otherwise it's whenever I get around  to  writing  and  debugging
     yucky drivers. Either postoffice me a note (2269 Market St. #118,
     San Francisco, CA 94114) or FidoNet me at 1/0.

             On an unrelated subject: I'm glad to see the HELP and BUG
     nodes are up.  Thanks to all the volunteers.  In a few weeks,  go
     check out the number of messages on all of  them,  all  at  once.
     Then  imagine  only  two  or three people answering all of those.
     Ugh.  It was our own fault, however,  we never made it clear just
     how much work it was. Things change.

             Which brings me to the real point: many, many people have
     requested  from  me  protocol  specs  and  such things on FidoNet
     compatibility issues. I'd really really like to write them, but I
     know I will never get to it.

             For example, I wrote a FIDOLIST program, that generates a
     human readable FIDOLIST.TXT from the node list.  Its really  nice
     and  fast,  but I found that there were keywords in the node list
     that I didn't  understand!  Now  that's  not  a  problem.  Things
     should  get repaired and updated as needed,  and I'm glad someone
     else did it instead of me (the HUB keyword had me baffled).

             This stuff has gotta get documented,  in some  "official"
     way,  or  we  are  going  to  be  in  SERIOUS  trouble very soon.
     FIDOMAIL.DOC was a  nice  start  (my  first  pass  at  a  FidoNet
     protocol spec) but its poorly written, and now out of date, as it
     doesn't have pickup and poll in it.

             How about this: we start some new IFNA region nodes:

             FidoNet Protocol SPECS
             File Transfer SPECS
             NodeList SPECS

     Fidonews                     Page 9                    7 Apr 1986


             FidoNet   Protocol  SPECS  would  generate  and  maintain
     something that describes in some  detail  the  FidoNet  protocol,
     plus  fill  in  some  of the missing parts (like the undocumented
     boundary conditions).  The FIDOMAIL.DOC file is a rude start, and
     I'll gladly fill in what I can for missing details. The person(s)
     involved  here  should  be  high  level  techie:  message  packet
     attribute bits should be allocated and  defined  from  here,  and
     future  protocol expansions,  which I have in my head,  should be
     written up. I will continue to maintain FIDO_???.EXE, and changes
     to  packet  formats,  message  header  bits,  etc,   need  to  be
     coordinated.  We already ran into one of those messes already, we
     don't need to a second time!

             File Transfer SPECS is pretty  simple:  it  should  cover
     XMODEM,  TELINK and KERMIT file transfer protocols.  Not really a
     big deal,  since these are documented currently,  but not all  in
     one place.  Also we need one set standard reference docs, that we
     refer to for all FidoNet related stuff,  and  not  just  whatever
     ancient file someone finds laying about.

             NodeList  SPECS is to cover the things like the node list
     keywords and their additions and changes,  plus probably keep the
     software  for  things  like  the new Diff file format.  Right now
     we're pretty safe, but this could get out of hand very easily.

             There are many more things that  are  SPEC  related  that
     need to be covered, these are just the biggies.

             Tim Pozar and I talked to Erik Fair,  in Berkeley, a high
     level Unix wizard and UUCP/Arpa expert,  and all around excellent
     person. We found out that even though FidoNet is an email system,
     but  not  a  "packet  switched"  system  (my fault for the faulty
     terminology,  I don't know anything  about  traditional  telecom)
     FidoNet  has  many  high level features and structural advantages
     that are now holding back UUCP net.  We have  the  advantages  of
     Arpa's  "host tables" (our nodelist) and the damn high efficiency
     that comes from paying for your own phone bills!

             We really need to keep things improving.  We have  a  hot
     network,   even  though  it's  not  getting  the  recognition  it
     deserves.   FidoNet  is  greater  than  the  sum  of  its  parts,
     obviously:  the  software is necessary but not enough;  the human
     structure is what makes it run!

             It is amazing how smoothly and quickly the HELP  and  BUG
     nodes  went  together.  I take it as an indication of the size of
     the need it filled.  The SPECS  nodes  won't  be  gobbled  up  so
     quickly,  but will provide long term insurance.  First of all, we
     will be the only ones doing such things,  so the rest of the  BBS
     world will turn to us for specs. We're building an expertise base
     here,  we  might  might  as  well  do  it purposefully instead of
     haphazardly, so that we all can benefit.

     I found this on a well-known mid-western BBS.  Thought I'd share
     it with all my good friends at FidoLand.

                          DL-232 -- A New Standard

                               by Dave Lyons
            (CompuCenter Iowa: JoeApple; CompuServe 72177,3233)


     I may never understand how the designers of the RS-232 "standard"
     for serial communication managed to use 25 wires where only 3 are
     really necessary.  Maybe they made a deal with the companies that
     make cables, connectors, and switch boxes.  I just don't know.

     Well,  I thought of a few things that the RS-232 standard  lacks,
     and  since  there  are already so many extra signals,  a few more
     can't hurt anybody, right?  Heck,  let's go for 50-pin connectors
     and cables and add the following new signals.  (Just to make sure
     this isn't compatible with any old equipment, all OLD signals are
     moved up one pin number (Carrier Detect becomes 9 instead  of  8,
     etc., and pin 25 goes to pin 1).


      Pin  Name      Description
      ---  ----      -----------
       26  XCAT      Should  be connected to chassis of devices.  Used
                     with the next two signals,  this provides protec-
                     tion against cats who haven't learned not to walk
                     on floppy disks or serial equipment.  This signal
                     should  supply  about  2000  volts (at a VERY low
                     current level;  wouldn't want to  HURT  the  cute
                     little  thing,  just  teach  it  not  to  walk on
                     anything in the computer room).

       27  CATGND    Cat  ground.  Used  with  pin  26.   This  signal
                     should  be  connected  to  another  part  of  the
                     chassis or the tabletop.

       28  CTD       Cat detect.

       29  SD        Self-destruct.  This signals causes the device to
                     destroy itself.

       30  SDACK     Self-destruct acknowledge.  Acknowledges that the
                     device has destroyed itself.

       31  VADIC     This signal indicates  to  a  computer  that  the
                     device  on  the  other  end  is a modem that uses
                     VADIC protocol.  (Note:  CompuCenter  Iowa  users
                     should  jumper  this  signal to SD and then buy a
                     decent modem.)

       32  STBIT1    Stutter bits.  With pin 33,  sets the  number  of
                     "stutter  bits"  (0  to 3 of them) to be included
                     before each byte  transmitted.  This  may  reduce
                     the  number of people who feel inferior to compu-
                     ter equipment by showing them that computers have
                     problems communicating with each other.

       33  STBIT2

       34  CABR      Cable ready.  It's not enough to  know  that  the
                     Data  Set is ready (DSR) and the Data Terminal is
                     read (DTR).  We also need to know that the  CABLE
                     connecting them is ready.

       35  GRR       Gremlins  ready.  Not  everybody  knows  it,  but
                     there are little green guys  inside  most  modern
                     computer equipment.  Most of the time they sleep,
                     but  other  times they cause trouble.  The next 6
                     signals are for dealing with gremlins.

       36  220A      Used with pin 37, supplies 220 volt power for the
                     gremlins' air  conditioning.  On  hot  days  when
                     gremlins  can't  sleep,  applying  power to these
                     pins may solve your problems.

       37  220B

       38  110H      110 volts,  hot side.  When the  220  volt  power
                     doesn't  help  and gremlin problems persist,  use
                     this with pin 39 to  supply  110  volts  for  the
                     gremlins' TV and video game center.

       39  110N      110 volts, neutral side.

       40  MOON      Indicates  the  phase  of  the  moon.   Sometimes
                     solves mysterious problems.

       41  LHI       Pins 41 through 45 can be used to  implement  the
                     "like"  protocol when the normal RTS/CTS protocol
                     isn't enough.  This one means "Like  HI"  and  is
                     used to establish a connection.

       42  LHTY2     Like HI to You Too.  Acknowledges pin 41.

       43  LLTT      Like Listen To This.  Requests permission to send
                     data.

       44  LOK       Like OK. Grants permission to transmit data.

       45  LWOW      Like WOW.  Acknowledges receipt of data.

       46  HEY       Pins  46  to  50  may  be  used  to implement the
                     "Eighties"  protocol  when  RTS/CTS  and   "Like"
                     protocols  won't  do  the  job.  This  signal  is
                     similar to RTS (Request to Send).

       47  NP        No Problem.  Acknowledges HEY.

       48  HUH?      Signals that  data  was  not  received  correctly
                     (possibly wrong number of stutter bits).

       49  YEAH      Acknowledges data received.

       50  KMG365    Like YEAH, but for avid Emergency One fans.


     That  makes  50!  Let's  hear  your  suggestions  for MORE serial
     signals.  Maybe  we  can  get  100  and  REALLY  make  the  cable
     manufacturers happy.

                             Notes from Abroad
                        The Future of Fido in Europe

     As Fido grows I think that countries must become self  supporting
     in  handing  out  node  numbers.  I  will  be  doing  the central
     coordination to prevent total chaos.  The  question  is  when  to
     start this.  As a CC gets a USA compatible (fast) modem a country
     or  part  of it can become a separate net,  getting mail from the
     USA directly.  From an organizational point of  view  this  good,
     but  it  suffers  on  cost  aspects  if  the number of nodes in a
     country is low and/or international  mail  is  on  a  low  level.
     Messages are cheaper if you pack them into one packet.  So it all
     depends  on  how  much  mail is send between countries and to and
     from the USA.  At the moment it is not a big problem anyway,  but
     if  you  have  thoughts about this point let us know through this
     newsletter.  The best solutions will emerge from the discussion I
     hope.

                             Our board at 500/1
                             ------------------

     This board is run (payed for) by the Dutch  hobby  computer  club
     (HCC),  a  club  with 23000+ members organized in local clubs and
     computer/operating system orientated user groups.  We  publish  a
     monthly  magazine  (35000+)  with  more than 100 pages each month
     mostly filled by articles from our members.  500/1 is used  as  a
     collection  point  for  these  articles.  Also  the communication
     between the central board, the professional workers at our office
     in utrecht and the 300+ local officials  have  become  a  problem
     that  we  try to solve with this board and a Fido in Utrecht.  In
     principal the central board of the HCC has decided to have a Fido
     installed for  as  much  local  HCC  clubs  and  user  groups  as
     possible.  There  is  money  available for about 12 boards but as
     being a democratic club,  the final approval of  our  Fido  plans
     must  be done on a general meeting in September.  We are actively
     seeking sponsoring  of  local  boards  and  are  approaching  the
     government  for  some  money.  (The  managers  of the Ministry of
     Education have already had  some  demonstrations  on  500/1).  In
     November  we  have  the annual HCC-days (2 days of computer shows
     with more than 35000 people attending last year) and we  hope  to
     announce  the  Fido_net_HCC  then loud and clear.  We are heavily
     promoting Fido in the news with continuing articles  in  our  own
     magazine  (first  one  in  September)  and  in other magazines (2
     articles on Fido appearing in October in a small and a  very  big
     magazine  (PCM).  Radio will give a Fido report in the first week
     of September.  We also give out press releases.

     This  board  will  be  devoted  to  coordination  and  collecting
     articles  and  will not have much software online after the local
     Fido's have started.

                             The Rainbow Corner
                              by Ted Needleman


     I had planned to review the first package in "Project Transport".
     The package I picked to test was  a  $15  per  module  accounting
     package  for  the  IBM  and compatibles.  At $15 each for General
     Ledger,  Accounts  Receivable,  Accounts  Payable,  Payroll,  and
     Inventory,  or  $50  for all 5 packages,  I figured if they work,
     they should be a terrific buy.  Using the "IDrive" IBM compatible
     disk drive from Suitable Solutions (408/725-8944),  I transferred
     the  programs onto Rainbow diskettes,  then installed the General
     Ledger on my hard disk.  The installation process went fine, with
     no problems reported, but when I ran the G/L, some of the screens
     were a bit garbled.  The program still appears to be usable,  but
     I  decided to forestall a thorough review until I try the program
     on my  COLUMBIA.  If  the  same  thing  happens,  then  it's  the
     software, not the process of transporting it over to the Rainbow.
     If,  in  the  meantime,  you  figure  it's worth the $15 (plus $5
     shipping and handling) to find out for yourself, give MCBS a call
     at 713/444-6269.  You will, however,  need someone with an IBM or
     compatible  to copy the double sided disks to single sided format
     (which the Rainbow can then read directly).

     One of the problems with "Project Transport" is  that  if  it  is
     successful, there is going to be a need to convert programs which
     are most often supplied on double sided disks,  into single sided
     format.  To address this problem, I'm trying to arrange with some
     of  the  user's  groups  for  some  volunteers  with  the  proper
     equipment.  For  a  nominal donation (perhaps a dollar or two per
     disk) which will go into the group's treasury,  a user's original
     purchased  software  disk  would  be  copied  onto  user supplied
     Rainbow formatted disks.  So far,  there doesn't seem to be a lot
     of interest on the part of user's groups in participating, but in
     the  next  few  months,  I'll  be speaking to several groups here
     along the East coast, and hopefully, will garner some assistance.

     As usual,  I'm still behind in answering the  mail,  but  I  have
     noticed  a  lot  of questions lately on modems.  Rather than just
     gloss over the subject,  I'm doing a feature article on  using  a
     modem with your Rainbow.  This should appear in a few months, and
     will discuss speed (baud rate),  parity, setting your comm port &
     parameters, using comm software, and a few other goodies.  In the
     interim,  if you have a specific question  or  problem,  leave  a
     message  for me on the RAINBW_CORNR Fido board (914/425-2613).  I
     don't promise to have all the answers, but I'll try to help.

     One question that comes  up  with  a  fair  amount  of  frequency
     concerns  modem  speed.  I keep getting asked whether I recommend
     2400 baud modems over the slower 1200 baud modems.  The answer to
     this is not cut-and-dried.  It depends to a large extent  on  how
     much  use  you  make  (or  anticipate  making) of communications.
     Right now,  a 2400 baud modem can cost  several  hundred  dollars
     more  than a 1200 baud modem.  If you only use your system for an
     occasional call to a local  BBS,  or  a  computer  service  which
     utilizes  one of the packet switching networks (such as TymNet or
     Fidonews                     Page 15                   7 Apr 1986


     Telenet), then save your money,  buy the less expensive 1200 baud
     modem.  If,  however,  you  are like me,  and tend to spend hours
     dialing boards around the country,  then spend the extra money on
     a  high speed modem.  Not all boards support 2400 baud,  and even
     if the one you are calling does support  this  speed,  the  phone
     lines don't always cooperate.  But over the long run the tendency
     in the industry is always toward greater speed and power.  It may
     cost  you a bit more now,  but you will be buying a bit more time
     before your equipment becomes obsolete.

     You might also want to check with A.T.& T. about their "Reach Out
     America" program.  This lets you dial anywhere in the continental
     U.S.A.  for a flat fee of $10 for the  first  hour,  and  $8  and
     change  for  additional hours.  Of course there are restrictions,
     such as having to make these  calls  after  11  P.M.  or  on  the
     weekends, but you might save some money.  It's worth a look.  See
     you next week.

         Welcome to another edition of The World of Computing!  As the
     title in the Table of  Contents  suggests,  this  time,  I'll  be
     mainly  discussing  the  new  "Super Macintosh," and some Israeli
     magazines that I recently had a chance to read.

         As you probably noticed, there has been a little time between
     the last column and this one.  I'm kind of new to deadlines,  but
     hopefully that was the last time I'll miss them.

        If  you're  a  careful  reader,  you  may  have noticed that I
     promised last week to discuss "the words we use." I had a  little
     something  prepared,  but  as  the  magazines  seemed to fit that
     description,  I decided to  hold  off  on  computer  words  until
     another week.

         The big news in January was the announcement of the Macintosh
     Plus  by  Apple.  Everyone  knew  about it,  right down to how it
     looked,  but John Sculley acted as though he didn't realize that,
     and announced it as if the new machine was a surprise to us all.

         When Apple first brought out the Mac, they intended for it to
     be  in  the office where IBM PC's had taken hold.  Unfortunately,
     that  failed  miserably.   Apple  was  forced  to  change   their
     strategy,  and publicly said that they would not compete with IBM
     any more.

         Now that they've come out with the Mac Plus,  what  can  they
     say?  It's the machine that they should have come out with in the
     first  place  (but  then,  improvements  and updates always are).
     Every  reviewer  said  that  it  needed  more  memory,  a  better
     keyboard,  expansion slots,  larger capacity drives, and at least
     two drives.

         Well,  they finally got what they were  waiting  for.  Almost
     exactly  two  years  later,  the Macintosh Plus has 1 Megabyte of
     memory (that's a  thousand  K  for  those  who  don't  know;  one
     Gigabyte  is  1,000  Megabytes),  like it should have been given.
     I'm sure someone out there is  saying,  "Hold  on!  Didn't  Apple
     listen  to  the  reviewers and add memory to give it 512K?" Well,
     they did, but why didn't they add more?  People would have gladly
     paid for it (they paid other companies for memory  upgrades,  why
     not Apple?).

         Computer  users  are  a  strange  breed.  We always want more
     memory,  whether or not our computers can use it or not.  We want
     to  have as much memory as is possible,  plus another few hundred
     K.  Apple should have realized this when they originally  brought
     out  the  Mac,  and  made their basic model with 512K,  and their
     advanced model with 1 or 2 Megabytes.

         Anyway,  the  next  complaint  was  the  keyboard.  As  Jerry
     Fidonews                     Page 17                   7 Apr 1986


     Pournelle  put  it  in BYTE,  if anyone else had designed a small
     keyboard with nonstandard keys and no special-function keys (i.e.
     ESC),  no one would have bought it!  But since it's  Apple,  they
     must know what they're doing, and thus it's okay.

         WRONG!!  Just  because  the  Mac is a special machine doesn't
     mean that it needs a  strange  keyboard!  Users  should  feel  as
     comfortable  on  a  PC  as they do on a Mac,  especially with the
     keyboard.  I've used many machines which could have been improved
     a lot either by the layout or  by  the  feel  of  the  keyboards.
     Making  keys  with  oddball names and taking others out is a real
     no-no.  As far as I know,  the ESCape and other keys like it  are
     on the new Mac Plus, as is a numeric keypad and cursor keys.

         Lots  of people also complained about the disk drives.  First
     of all,  they held too little.  For a graphics-oriented  machine,
     where each pixel is more than one byte (like on other computers),
     400K drives are not nearly enough. 800K drives are good, but only
     if  they're  faster than the old ones.  Any Mac user can tell you
     what a pain it is to wait for the machine to boot a disk.

         The last important thing about the Mac Plus is the  SCSI,  or
     Small Computer Standard Interface.  John Dvorak of InfoWorld says
     that  it's pronounced "scuzzy." Besides the pronunciation,  there
     are a few other drawbacks to the SCSI.

         First of all,  who says that it's going to be standard?  It's
     supposed  to  be for hard drives.  Hyperdrive connects inside the
     machine,  and therefore has no use for the interface.  Others use
     the serial port, and would require an upgrade.

         Secondly,  it's too little, too late.  If they wanted to make
     any real impact,  they would have done it last  year,  when  they
     introduced AppleTalk, the LaserWriter, and the Mac XL (aka Lisa).
     Now,  no one's going to use it except for Apple (even their drive
     doesn't use it yet).  And besides,  there's only one.  Apple  and
     IBM  users  have a hard time squeezing the most out of their five
     to eight slots...what can you do with just one?

         The Macintosh Plus is a great idea,  but,  unfortunately  for
     Apple, it's a little late.



         Israeli Magazines

         This  past  week  (right  now,  it's  March 5th),  one of the
     members of my family as well as several of  my  friends  went  to
     Israel  for  a  5-day conference.  When he came back,  he gave me
     three computer magazines from Israel.  Two of  them  were  called
     "Anashim Umichashvim",  or "People and Computers",  and the other
     was just plain "Michashvim", "Computers".

         As Israel was occupied by Britain until its  independence  in
     1948,  there's  still  a  lot  of  English  used  in  publishing.
     However,  it surprised me to see how much English was really used
     Fidonews                     Page 18                   7 Apr 1986


     in  the  magazine.  Names  of  computers were frequently given in
     English,  as were words like "JUYSTICKS" \[sic\].  At one  point,
     values were hand-written onto the magazine.

         People  and  Computers  is put out by CW Communications,  the
     same people who do InfoWorld (an excellent magazine, by the way).
     Thus,  it didn't surprise me when the cover was very much like my
     magazine-format InfoWorlds at home.

         There  are  two versions of P&C put out in Israel -- one is a
     monthly that looks like the old InfoWorld magazines (from October
     1984 to August 1985),  and another is a weekly that is  mainly  a
     trade journal, telling business people when shows are.

         One  of  the  articles  caught  my  attention  (I  guess  the
     headline-makers are doing their job) when I saw it in  the  Table
     of  Contents.  It  was entitled "1986:  The Death of the Personal
     Computer." Incidentally,  the word  for  computer  in  Hebrew  is
     Michashev,  from  the  word  "thought",  even  though  they don't
     actually think (yet).

         The article outlines the computer used  in  Israel  and  what
     will happen with them.  It's interesting to note that Israel uses
     many  of  the  same  types of computers available in Europe,  for
     instance, the Commodore PC10 and PC20,  their IBM-compatibles.  I
     also saw the IBM PC G and the IBM PC DD,  neither of which I know
     anything about (except from the specs list on one of the  pages),
     except  that  the PC G has been discontinued because there are no
     more.

         The author of the article predicts success with the Amiga and
     520 ST,  and the death of CP/M.  I have to differ on two  of  the
     three  points.  I  don't think that the Amiga will really make it
     to the point that the 520,  and certainly not the 1040  ST  will.
     Both  of  the Atari machines have more base memory than the Amiga
     for much less money, and these days, that really makes a machine.

         As to the death of CP/M,  I doubt that  highly.  Many  people
     use  CP/M and continue to use it every day.  I,  for one,  use it
     more than I use my other computers, since I'm so used to its feel
     (although MS-DOS comes kind of close).  As reported in InfoWorld,
     a company is thriving selling old CP/M software that no one  else
     thinks is worth the effort any more.

         That  about wraps up my section on computers in Israel.  In a
     few weeks,  I hope to compare  their  review  of  Excel  with  an
     American magazine's.



         Corrections

         Every  columnist  everywhere  I  read makes mistakes,  so why
     should I be any different?  I've received some mail, and although
     I responded in person to them,  I'll explain  in  a  little  more
     detail what I did.
     Fidonews                     Page 19                   7 Apr 1986


         First of all,  I have a message from Mike Harrington,  of the
     Blue Telegraph in Seattle.  He wanted to know if I could drop the
     copyright notice at the bottom of the  column,  to  keep  in  the
     spirit of the public domain.

         After receiving his letter, I realized that he was absolutely
     right  in what he said.  If you look at the bottom of this week's
     (and future week's) column,  you'll see  that  I  now  give  full
     copying  rights,  so  long as there is not profit made.  However,
     there is still a copyright on it,  much like  many  public-domain
     utilities.  If anyone has any comments, just write to me.

         I also received a letter from Bob Spivack,  of Spiv's Fido in
     San Jose,  California.  Bob gave the real reasons why  IBM  chose
     the 8088, and I'll condense it here.

         Intel  created the 8086 before the 8088,  but since companies
     didn't need the extra 16-bit  hardware  for  their  products  and
     peripherals, they weren't buying it as fast as Intel thought they
     would.  Intel  then  designed  a  chip  that was identical to the
     8086,  but utilizes an 8-bit data and I/O bus instead of  16-bit.
     IBM  chose  the  8088  instead for most of the same reasons:  the
     speed and expandability  of  the  8086,  but  with  the  ease  of
     interfacing with 8-bit memory and peripherals.

         If  any of you spot mistakes,  don't hesitate to write me and
     point them out!  I try to be as accurate as possible,  but  I  am
     still human.

         Well,  I'm really out of space for this week,  so let me just
     remind you how open I am to suggestions and comments.  Just  send
     mail  to me either through FidoMail at Fido 107/33,  or at 21 Old
     Westbury Road, Old Westbury, NY,  11568.  Until next time,  happy
     computing!

     of  software,  from text editors to games to unprotection schemes

     This collection is the result of more than 10 months of intensive
     downloads from just about 100 or more BBS's  and  other  sources,

     convenience.  Starting a Bulletin Board System?  Want to  add  on
     to your software base without spending thousands of dollars? This

     postal money order or company purchase order) to:

     cataloguing, archiving and maintaining the files.  Obtaining this
     software  yourself  through  the  use  of a computer with a modem

     "front end" for Fido (version 11q or later),  allowing you to add
     the full functionality of SEAdog to your existing system.

     SEAdog normally sells for $100/node, but for a limited time only
     we are offering SEAdog to registered FidoNet sysops for only $35!

     The Node Number given in FidoNews Volume 3,  Number  12  for  the
     Shuttle Poem was wrong. The number given was 109/612. The correct
     number  is 109/606.  The Peom was written by a Science Teacher at
     the Maret School in Washington,  DC.  As he  is  not  a  user  on
     109/606,  any  message  regarding the poem should be addressed to
     the SYSOP of 109/606.
