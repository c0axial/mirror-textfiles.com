     =================================================================


     This will not be a large edition of FidoNews. I hope we're not going
     back to the Editorial being the only thing in the newsletter.

     FIDONEWS Echo is now fully connected over the Z1 Backbone. Reports
     from Z2 say it is also getting over there. I haven't heard anything
     from Z3-Z6.

     Speaking of which, WHERE is the Zone 3 Nodelist update? Hello, ZC3!
     Do you need someone to move the files from down under? We're having
     a long-distance sale at AT&T [see article later] up here and there
     shouldn't be any reason for this interminable delay in updating,
     should there be?

     There is an active seeker for the IC slot reporting in this week's
     Issue. We have been completely stagnant on that front for WAY too
     long so maybe some action will be generated.

     Stop putting off that article! What ever happened to all those ASCII
     artists we used to have? Send in some Comix! I can keep recycling the
     old cow pictures but there's only so much mileage in that clunker.

     Whatever happened to Doc Logger? Who else wants to write a weekly
     column? FidoNetting minds want to know!

     And how about you FidoNet codgers? Let's have some of those .BIOs for
     the 'youngsters'. [grin]

     IC-selection .. a candidate ..

     By Ward Dossche
        2:292/854

     Colleagues,

     A number of RC's in Zone-2 as well as 2 ex-ZC's have requested
     me to become a candidate in the IC-selection process.

     We have now been without an IC for over a year, the (s)election-
     process has come to a grinding halt without any conclusion and
     this is now beginning to harm Fidonet.

     I have considered the plea made to me and hereby confirm that I
     am a candidate as of now.

     Fidonet used to follow from very close the technical evolutions
     in the telecom-world. I don't see this happening anymore, at
     least not in an organised way.

     Further it seems we are being overtaken by events, i.e. large
     numbers of nodes disappearing from the net and moving to other
     quarters, presumably the internet.

     Now this in itself needs not to be a negative thing. Fidonet has
     known years of growth beyond expectation and what we are
     noticing could very well be just a trimming-down to real
     proportions, i.e. shedding dead wood. In this case losing a
     number of nodes does not mean a loss of quality.

     Now is there still a life for Fidonet, is there a need for it?

     Undoubtedly the advent of the internet has meant a change and
     turning the clock back will be impossible.

     But why consider this a dissadvantage and not turn it into an
     advantage?

     It has been argued in the past that Fido should not get its
     hands dirty on the internet, but is that really the case? Is
     sticking to PSTN-access not rather a symptom of a lack of vision
     and a bigger danger for the net than embracing the goodies the
     internet and other oportunities could mean?

     What goodies?

     What about nodes with full IP-access? Impossible? They already
     exist and work wonderfully well ... ask Basil Dolmatov, he'll
     tell you all about it.

     FIDONEWS 13-34               Page 3                   19 Aug 1996


     What about HAM-access between Fido-nodes? It exists!

     What about X25-access between Fido-nodes? It exists!

     But these nodes remain hidden as 'Pvt'.

     If we have an advantage over the internet then it is our
     flexibility to adapt our technology to other transmission modes.

     There are a bunch of other items that need tackling such as :

     *  The officially unresolved status of ZyXEL-flags;
     *  The unresolved status of V34-systems;
     *  What about cellular nodes ... they're there already;
     *  Worldwide implementation of proper ISDN-flags;
     *  Stopping the Zones from drifting apart;
     *  Everything that affects connectability, communicativity, and
        connectivity?
     *  What about ZMH- and FTS-0001-compliancy in an environment
        which is technically more and more unable to offer direct
        connects between different modulation-, transmission- and/or
        access-methods?

     Everyone with their heads in the right spot will come to the
     conclusion that Fidonet in future will have to respond to
     demands, not necessarily purely technical even, beyond the ones
     that are now catered for by present structures.

     Do we have to close eyes and rule out any technical evolution
     because that's what we're bound to do by a policy which is
     becoming more and more obsolete?

     Here comes another IC-challenge ... changing the current policy,
     an exercise which hasn't had any success over the past ... erhhh
     ... 7 years.

     So, yes, I am willing to be a candidate in the IC-selection
     process. But mind you, not at any price. If it is to be the
     object of a bashing-contest then I'll gracefully bow out.

     If anyone wants information on what I stand for and think which
     direction we should move in, then please consider this text as
     the memorandum to Fidonet on the minimum programme which I think
     an IC should commit him/herself to.

     I know the IC-(s)election is a "ZC-only"-matter but it is my
     feeling that there is no reason to remain secretive about this.
     Hence the publication of this message/mail/announcement in
     FIDONEWS, REGCON (Does it function? Is it alive?), REGCON.EUR
     (Zone-2 only), ENET.SYSOP (Zone-2 only) and ZCC (ZC's and
     invited guests only). Please crosspost to where-ever deemed
     necessary.

     Kind regards to all,

     Ward Dossche

     It's no big deal if the Nodelist shrinks

     it's a cooperative venture this FidoNet thing. those appointed/elected
     to the Coordinator slots are only volunteers and in any volunteer
     organization there are those who do it with vigor and those who don't.
     if each level above pays no attention to the level below then sooner
     or later surprises such as the one you've related occur. it is
     inevitable.

     DH> Wonder how much of THAT is going on?

     some folks are concerned that FidoNet is shrinking. so what's wrong
     with that? for years all they did was moan about how the Nodelist was
     getting too big. FidoNet Nodes are not an endangered species. the
     falloff doesn't begin to approach the original growth rate. it's no
     big deal.

     i'd say it was a normal shakeout after years of unchecked expansion.
     in the dim time, it took a certain amount of technical skill and
     determination to put up a FidoNet Node. the mechanism for granting
     Node numbers was cumbersome and slow. originally, it was just a hobby
     for geeks who liked to play with computers and modems; sending a few
     msgs or files around. it grew then, too, and lost Nodes but with
     smaller numbers overall it didn't seem like a big deal.

     i propose it's still no big deal. the gross rates are probably
     comparable.  the ease with which one can start up a Node now makes it
     simpler for dilettanti to crank up a system, get it in the Nodelist,
     find out it's too much trouble or expense, and then quit. many of
     those who joined up in the past expansion were here only for the
     Echomail fix or to make a buck. a lot of them have moved on to the
     Internet for that sort of thing. FidoNet never needed them in the
     first place. they didn't contribute to the hobby; just to the size of
     the Nodelist. let them leave. so what?

     it's a fundamental law of nature that what goes up must come down. the
     artificial expansion of the Nodelist is bound to level off and then
     seek a real level. i submit that's where we are now. this 'shrinkage'
     that has some in a tizzy is a natural and normal effect and nothing to
     FIDONEWS 13-34               Page 5                   19 Aug 1996


     be concerned about.

     the only thing we need to worry about is that some folks who want to
     join aren't getting the opportunity because of Coordinators who have
     retired in place without notice. the only way to shake that up is to
     get Coordinators at upper levels who understand the hobby and commit
     to their responsibilities.  when each level up is paying attention to
     the level below, Nodes and Nets DON'T get lost.

     the rest is just hysteria. [grin]

     TTFN.

                        Creating FIDO Source
                                 by
                 Robert Briggs, SYSOP, FIDO node 464



          I,  at  least,  am  willing to take on Tom  Jennings'
     challenge  to create source public domain source code  for
     FIDO.   Therefore,  I  am creating a special section on my
     board  for FIDO internal use only ,  devoted  to  handling
     source  code  for a FIDO re-write.   This section will  be
     available to anyone who sends me a FIDO-NET message - just
     leave your log on name and desired password in the message.

          There  are  some ground rules that I  feel should  be
     observed.   The  source should be able to be  compiled  by
     either Lattice 'C',  Microsoft 'C' (about the same thing),
     or  CIi-C86.   That  means that any features  peculiar  to
     either  compiler  will  have to be stuck in a  library  of
     routines   and  they  have  to  be  duplicated  for   both
     compilers.   Since  I  am the author of the  CHEAPWARE  c-
     function  libraries,  this is "right up my alley",  so  to
     speak.

          FIDO  uses  both  interrupt driven send  and  receive
     routines.   I   have have only the interrupt  driven  send
     routines  available for both compilers.   I  will put  the
     code  up on the board and let people somewhat more skilled
     in assembly language "hack" on it.   FIDO also  implements
     several  protocalls,  such  as KERMIT and TELELINK that  I
     know nothing about.   I am sure that there is a WIZ or two
     out there that could write something.   Please note that I
     am  not  offering  to  write  FIDO,   just  take  on   the
     responsibility of keeping track of a multitude of routines
     that need to be done before we even have a good start on a
     re-write.   This is no small job,  imagine several hundred
     people submitting changes and ideas....

          Anyway,  everyones feed-back,  comments, suggestions,
     gripes, etc. are welcome at my node.  One thing that I  do
     insist  on,  the SYSOP must be able to sign onto the local
     terminal  just like a remote user,  and without having  to
     take FIDO down.   I have implemented a rudimentary version
     of this feature, and a (extremely) rough copy of a program
     that answers the phone, sends the file WELCOME.DAT out the
     modem, and then asks for the users name.  Not much I  will
     admit, but a start.

          Please  respond  to the  programmers  technical  BBS,
     FIDONEWS 13-34               Page 7                   19 Aug 1996


     Pro_Tech_BBS,  node 464.  The number is (801) 264-8290.  I
     would  like  to currently limit access to the  section  to
     those who can send me FIDO-NET mail.   Others later?  It's
     all  up to the FIDO network SYSOPs.   I would hate to have
     to cancel this whole thing for lack of  interest,  knowing
     full  well that TOM gets many requests for info about  the
     source code.  Must be some interest out there somewhere...

     Six Mail Processors Reviewed [I]
     Damian Walker, 2:2502/666

         This article starts of a six-part series which aims to bring to
     light the capabilities of six mail processors (or echomail tossers, if
     you prefer).  These mail processors are FastEcho, GEcho, FMail, IMail,
     JMail and Squish.
         Each individual article will look at a single mail processor,
     examining its strengths and weaknesses, and giving the results of a
     few tests.  Rather than list and discuss every feature of every
     package (many features being common to all of them), I shall
     concentrate on the things which make each package stand out from all,
     or most, of the rest.
         I will try to keep my personal preferences out of the reviews
     (since I am a user of one of the programs myself).  The final article
     will also contain a feature table to help you decide which of the six
     programs is most appropriate for your requirements.
         The software will be evaluated on an ageing IBM PS/2 386, and I
     will be looking as much at the supporting documentation as the program
     itself.  I will be testing each program for speed and stability, and a
     compiled feature table will be included in the last article of the
     series.
         The speed tests will be performed on a copy of my normal personal
     daily echomail packet (about 50k), rather than on the larger packets
     supplied to my node.  The reason for this is stability and
     consideration for my own points, who would have good reason to get
     irate if their mail was interrupted because of my experiments.
         Due to the nature of my humble hardware, I am limited to reviewing
     the DOS versions of software, albeit in 386 DPMI versions where
     available.  Bear this in mind when I quote mail processing speeds
     (this machine is a 386DX/20, with a Norton speed index of around 17).

     DISCLAIMER :-)

         Although I will make a best attempt to make sure these articles
     are accurate, I cannot guarantee anything.  For instance, certain
     features of the software may not be easily tested or examined in
     detail, so I will be taking a lot of information about the packages
     from their own documentation.
         When choosing your mail processor, it is a good idea to make a
     thorough examination of it yourself before installing it ready for
     permanent use at your system.  Make sure it has the features _you_
     need before committing yourself.
         The speed tests are taken from the timestamps in the log files
     produced by the software, so they should be as accurate as my system
     clock (which is reasonably accurate), but make sure you take note of
     the version I'm testing; don't compare speeds of 386 and 8086 versions
     when making your choice.
         On to the reviews themselves...

     Burchardt of 2:2448/400.  It is available for DOS machines (in 8086
     and 386 DPMI versions), and also for OS/2.  The version I am looking
     at is 1.45a, the 8086 DOS version.  There may be versions for other
     platforms that I do not know about.

     First Impressions

         I must admit to some prior knowledge of this package.  Some local
     nodes are very enthusiastic about FastEcho, and a friend of mine often
     tacitly suggests that I change over to FastEcho from GEcho, my mail
     processor of choice.  Let's see how this program has gained such a
     reputation.
         FastEcho is quite a large package with quite an impressive range
     of features.  It is shareware, with the point version costing $15 and
     the full node version costing $25.  The evaluation version lasts for a
     limited time period (around 1 month) before it stops working.
         Upon first looking at the package, it boasts a sizeable
     executable, which in itself means nothing, and a rather large document
     file (too large to load up in QEdit-- time to learn how to use LIST).
     So at least we know that the documentation is comprehensive.
         Moving on to the other files in the directory, we see that
     FastEcho includes a setup tool-- a boon to those who do not like
     configuring their software with text files.  It also contains another
     executable for the message base tools.

     On Further Examination...

         It is rather difficult to point out features which make FastEcho
     stand out from the other mail processors.  Most of FastEcho's
     features, even the advanced ones, are shared with one or more of the
     other packages.
         This is no bad thing, however, when you consider that FastEcho's
     feature count is high; that is, although it has few exclusive
     features, the number of features it does have makes it a very good
     all-rounder.
         Lets look at some of the features where FastEcho excels.
         The message base support is excellent.  FastEcho supports Hudson,
     JAM, Squish and *.MSG echomail areas fully; the only other package
     reviewed here which can boast this versatility with message bases is
     IMail.
         Although not unusual, the cross-platform availability is a good
     point for the package.  As has already been mentioned, versions are
     available for DOS, DOS DPMI and OS/2.
         The full screen message toss is something which will appeal to
     those who like a more aesthetically pleasing screen display.  Rather
     than the usual ASCII scrolling screen display, FastEcho has the option
     of a full screen display where progress is shown using percentage bars
     and fixed-position screen fields, rather like a BBS download or a
     mailer file transfer.
         Another useful feature is FastEcho's ability to automatically add
     areas when new mail arrives.  This differs from the more widespread
     feature, where an echomail processor adds a new area while forwarding
     a request from a downlink.  FastEcho can add a new mail area when mail
     arrives in that area, as an alternative to using a bad echo area.
         It can also automatically update configuration files for other
     FIDONEWS 13-34               Page 10                  19 Aug 1996


     software, such as FM (the message editor that comes with FrontDoor) or
     RemoteAccess BBS.  This feature is invaluable for points, where an
     echo can be added to all the necessary software with only the effort
     of an areafix message, and it is also valuable for BBS sysops who want
     to add echoes to their system with the minimum of fuss.
         Particularly impressive, to my mind, is the carbon copy feature.
     Most mail processors and point systems have some way of copying
     personal mail into a specific message area, allowing you to give it
     priority.  FastEcho takes this feature a little further, allowing you
     to flag messages according to From, To or Subject fields, or even
     contents of message kludges.
         Such a versatile system has many uses; you can prioritize messages
     not just to yourself, but also from those whose messages have
     particular importance.  Software authors like myself can keep tabs on
     messages about (or written using) our own software, no matter what the
     echo.
         Another useful feature is the ability to shell out to other
     software during the mail toss process.  FastEcho has the ability to
     shell to other software before packets are processed, and afterwards
     as well.
         The final point which impresses me with the program itself is the
     interface of the full screen setup program.  This uses a pull-down
     menu interface which is mouse compatible; this is not often needed, or
     even noticed, on machines in which every available serial port is
     needed for a modem, but some of us are lucky enough to have a PS/2
     mouse and port :-)
         The setup program sports a useful context-sensitive help system,
     which has occasional hypertext references to other topics.
     Unfortunately, there appears to be no central help index, which
     thwarted my attempts at casual browsing.
         The documentation to this package, as has been mentioned already,
     is very large, and very comprehensive.  Although I have not had time
     to read it all, I have found that the manual lives up to my own
     expectations for documentation (which are probably unreasonably high).
         After the initial licensing agreement and introduction, there is a
     length tutorial showing you in great detail how to set up the
     software. This tutorial is around 100 pages, so be ready to settle
     down for a good long read.
         After the tutorial there are two sections for reference.  The
     first details with the FASTECHO executable itself, and explains in
     detail all the options and commands for that program.  The second
     section is for the FEUTIL program, which contains message base
     utilities such as purge/pack, post and sort.
         In addition to these sections, there are miscellaneous sections
     about things such as 386 considerations and areafix messages, and at
     the end of the manual is a full, clear index.

     Speed Test

         Despite its name, FastEcho's speed was slightly disappointing in
     the tests I ran.  The fact that this is not the 386 version of the
     program does have to be taken into account, yet the 4-year old
     evaluation copy of GEcho proved to be slightly faster than FastEcho
     for Hudson and *.MSG areas.  Whether this says more about the speed of
     GEcho or of FastEcho is a matter on which I wouldn't like to
         speculate.  Using a newly-created Hudson message base, FastEcho
     FIDONEWS 13-34               Page 11                  19 Aug 1996


         tossed 91 inbound messages in 15 seconds (its own stats make this
         10 messages
     per second, taking into account the time it takes to unarchive the
     packets).  With JAM the time was 20 seconds, Squish took 21 seconds
     and *.MSG areas took 14 seconds to process.
         These figures are best to compare with GEcho, since it is unfair
     to compare the speeds for the 8086 version of FastEcho given here with
     the 386 versions of FMail and IMail reviewed later.  If I can find a
     copy of the 386 version of FastEcho locally before the sixth article
     in this series I will rerun the tests with that version for the final
     feature table.

     Summary

         I would have no problem recommending FastEcho to anyone.  It is
     what could be known as a good all-rounder; its automatic handling of
     new areas makes it good for points, yet its more advanced mail
     handling features make it a good choice for major mail hubs as well.
         Next week's FidoNews will (hopefully) see the second article in
     this series, in which I take a look at the GEcho mail processor
     written by Gerard van der Land.

     might want to get aboard right smartly.

     they call it World on Sale and starting tonight at midnight and
     running until 9 Feb 97, all overseas calls will be drastically reduced
     AND these reductions are good 24 HOURS a day!

     9 cents to Canada. 41 cents to Japan. etc!

     you have to call the AT&T TrueWorld folks [check your statement for
     the number. i got transferred by the AT&T operator.] and tell them you
     want to sign up. there are no additional costs but they aren't allowed
     to link you without your permission.

     they didn't send me a notice but they're famous for summer promotions
     without notice to their customers. the operator told me it's been on
     t.v. [grin]

     check it out if you do a lot of overseas calling.

     Latest Greatest Software Versions
     by Peter E. Popovich, 1:363/264

     More netmail, more updates. Things do seem to be moving along. I've
     received a couple of good lists of authors; I've beat the bushes some,
     gotten a few responses so far. Each one seems to require some change
     to the format: a new F or S type, or it won't fit in the allotted
     space. Of course, it could be worse. At least I'm getting the info in
     and organized. ;-)

     I've gotten some suggestions on how to "phase out" old entries. Of
     them, my favorite is to highlight one per week. If anyone at all
     writes in with info, even just to say "I still use it", I'll leave
     it in. If nobody writes in, I'll drop it.

     Highlight of the week: ADTBBS 1.50. Deadline for info: 30 Aug 1996.

     Caveats: Obviously, I'll re-add dropped packages upon receipt of up
     to date info. In a month or so, I'll review the progress and see if
     we need to increase the number of items to be phased out per week. My
     goal is to only drop packages that aren't being used at all any more.

     Errata: I misspelled Pablos Saratxaga's last name last week. It
     should be fixed now.
