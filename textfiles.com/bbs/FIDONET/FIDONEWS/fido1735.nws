                                Policy Debate
                                  Doug Myers

     Policy Debate continues to rage in the FN_SYSOP echo.  Last week's
     editorial expressed the opinion that a formal change to Policy 4 is
     unlikely to result from any of the discussion currently taking
     place.  However, Fidonet these days is run as much by the way sysops
     view the proper way they should interact as by any strict
     interpretation of policy... so it behooves us to examine some of the
     issues of the debate.


     ISSUE:  Policy 4.07 was never ratified by the sysops of Fidonet, and
     therefore isn't binding on them.

     It's true that Policy 4.07 was never voted upon by the sysops of
     Fidonet, but rather by the Regional Coordinators.  The fact that
     P4.07 granted Fidonet Coordinators governing authority which was
     previously considered to be in the hands of individual sysops leads
     some critics to cry "Foul!"  They feel that the Coordinators were
     out of line to grant themselves broad powers and then attempt to
     legitimate it by voting only among themselves.

     Though this editor respects the above considerations, what is
     overlooked is that P4.07 has been informally ratified by sysop
     assent.  Power in Fidonet _does_ reside in the hands of the sysops
     to the extent that they care to exercise it... but to the extent
     that they don't, power is exercised by individuals or groups.
     Simply put, if a group sets up rules and they are followed, then the
     rules are valid.  P4.07 has stood unaltered for over ten years, and
     until the sysops reject it, it's valid... hence "informally
     ratified."

     This "informal ratification" is, however, a two-edged sword.  The
     Region 10 Coordinator discovered a few years back that the powers
     granted by Policy could be effectively rescinded by the sysops.


     ISSUE:  Sysop ratification of Policy isn't necessary.

     It is pointed out that NONE of the policies prior to P4 were
     ratified by ANYONE, but rather handed down from "on high."  Hence
     there is no precedent for sysop ratification.

     This editor would argue that no policy would be successful without
     the assent of the sysops who comprise Fidonet.  All policies were
     ratified to the extent that they were followed.


     ISSUE:  Much of the debate on "policy" is actually on areas not
     covered by policy.  For example, echomail isn't covered by P4.07.

     FIDONEWS 17-35               Page 2                   28 Aug 2000


     The above argument places too strict an interpretation on the term
     "policy."  While P4.07 avoids any regulation of echomail, it's
     difficult to argue that there's no echomail policy.  Anyone who has
     tried to start an echo realizes that there's a definite procedure to
     follow (a policy), though it's expressed by the mail movers rather
     than the Coordinators.

     The practices which aren't defined by P4.07 are as much a part of
     Fidonet Policy as those formally stated.


     ISSUE:  Fidonet doesn't really need a Policy.  A set of informal
     guidelines would serve the same purpose.

     This is a mere bandying of words.  Changing what we call policy
     doesn't alter the reality.  A formal policy which no one follows
     isn't really policy at all, while "informal guidelines" which
     constrict are more binding than any stated policy.


     CONCLUSION:  Fidonet will always be governed by Policy, though it
     won't be P4.07 or even its successor should one ever be drafted and
     adopted.  Policy is simply the way the sysops choose to interact...
     and that may or may not follow the formal policy.  For example,
     sysops generally organize under a coordinator structure, pretty much
     as defined by formal policy as there are few practical alternatives.
     However, strict geographic organization as mandated by formal policy
     is increasingly ignored as sysops find increasing advantage to
     organize in more appropriate ways.  Bob Satti's concession of
     automatic geographic exemptions has become policy more binding than
     P4.07.

                    ENGINEERING EXPERT IN TIME MANAGEMENT
                          The BIG ROCKS in your life

     One day an expert in time management was speaking to a group of
     business students and, to drive home a point, used an illustration
     those students will never forget.  As he stood in front of the group
     of high powered overachievers he said, "Okay, time for a quiz." Then
     he pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouthed  Mason jar and set it on
     the table in front of him.  Then he produced about a dozen
     fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one at a time, into the
     jar.  When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit
     inside, he asked, "Is this jar full?"

     Everyone in the class said, "Yes." Then he said, "Really?"  He
     reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel.  Then he
     dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to
     work themselves down into the space between the big rocks.

     Then he asked the group once more, "Is the jar full?"  By this time
     the class was on to him.  "Probably not," one of them answered.
     "Good!" he replied.  He reached under the table and brought out a
     bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in the jar and it went
     into all of the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel.

     Once more he asked the question, "Is this jar full?" No!" the class
     shouted.  Once again he said, "Good."  Then he grabbed a pitcher of
     water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim.

     Then he looked at the class and asked, "What is the point of this
     illustration?"  One eager beaver raised his hand and said, "The
     point is, no matter how full your schedule is, if you try really
     hard you can always fit some more things in it!"

     "No," the speaker replied, "that's not the point.  The truth this
     illustration teaches us is:  If you don't put the big rocks in
     first, you'll never get them in at all."  What are the 'big rocks'
     in your life?  Your children; Your loved ones; Your education; Your
     dreams; A worthy cause; Teaching or mentoring others; Doing things
     that you love; Time for yourself; Your health; Your significant
     other.  Remember to put these BIG ROCKS in first or you'll never get
     them in at all.

     If you sweat the little stuff (the gravel, the sand) then you'll
     fill your life with little things you worry about that don't really
     matter, and you'll never have the real quality time you need to
     spend on the big, important stuff (the big rocks).

     So, tonight, or in the morning, when you are reflecting on this
     short story, ask yourself this question: What are the 'big rocks' in

     my life? Then, put those in your jar first. (Found floating in web
     surf).

                                Union Brothel
                              Thanks to Roy Reed

     A dedicated union worker was attending a convention in Las Vegas
     and, as you would expect, decided to check out the local brothels
     nearby. When he got to the first one, he asked the madam, "Is this a
     union house?"

     "No," she replied, "I'm sorry it isn't."

     "Well, if I pay you $100, what cut do the girls get?"

     "The house gets $80 and the girls get $20."

     Mightily offended at such unfair dealings, the man stomped off down
     the street in search of a more equitable, hopefully unionized shop.

     His search continued until finally he reached a brothel where the
     madame responded,

     "Why yes sir, this IS a union house."

     The man asked, "And if I pay you $100, what cut do the girls get?"
     "The girls get $80 and the house gets $20."

     "That's more like it!" the UPS man said. He looked around the room
     and pointed to a stunningly attractive blonde. "I'd like her for the
     night."

     "I'm sure you would, sir," said the madame, then, gesturing to an
     obese fifty-five year old woman in the corner, "but Ethel here has
     seniority."

     a @ preceding an individual's name implies a virtual email
     address. The email is translated as follows
     firstlast@osirusoft.com will automatically route to the
     appropriate individual's email.  Anyone in this list will
     also receive routed notice of this feature.  In my case, it
     would still be joejared@osirusoft.com, but you get the idea.

     Also, as information is provided to me, I will be adding a
     latency field to each node, which is defined as the maximum
     time between when the message is received, and when it is
     sent on to other nodes, or available to be sent onward,
     defined in minutes. A latency of ! implies that there is an
     immediate response, and an attempt to deliver immediately
     after processing, or a "MinuteMail System", as it were.
