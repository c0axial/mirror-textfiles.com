                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
     If you're new to Intelec, here are some common mistakes that should be
     avoided at all cost. We're all human, give these a super-human effort.
     Do not let users who's names are in the TCANLIST.IN file into Intelec.
     If you support aliases on your board, that is OK, just not in Intelec.
     Don't let unvalidated users enter mail in Intelec, it causes problems.
     Use our IS.EXE util to ensure you don't bomb the net with o'size REPs.
     Do not send us ANY "My BBS is now echoing this conference" type posts.
     If using PCB, disable the Origin Tagline in PCBSetup. We don't use it.
     Make sure you spell Intelec correctly, we're not Intelect or Intellec.
     Make sure your tagline starts out ş Intelec ş  or  ş Intelec Network ş
     Don't make any private conference public, as it's grounds for removal.
     Don't let unauthorized users into a private conference, same as above.
     Our private conferences: SysOps, Moderators and Regionals (Hubs only).
     Our NetAdmin conference is fully public and open to all unless TCAN'd.
     NetAdmin must be scanned timely by all SysOps for mail to ALL or them.

                             ³ Satellite SysOps! ³
                             ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
     If you are a Node getting Intelec off the "satellite system"  you must
     do a mail export daily. If no REP exists then a mail run does not need
     to be made that day. But you must call a minimum of twice a week. If a
     REP packet IS made then it must be sent to your hub THAT DAY.  Uploads
     of mail that contains messages two or more days old is not acceptable.
     If you are an Intelec hub of any level and you are using the satellite
     system you must make your calls to your hub *daily* without exception.
     No private conferences are sent out on the satellite, for those forums
     a QWK DL from your hub is necessary. See the Conference Config section
     for more info on what conferences are private. But for those satellite
     SysOps calling the Host system, there's a nominal $2/month fee to help
     offset the expense of the Host BBS operation. If not enough SysOps use
     the Host for their uplink, this $2/month fee may be implemented to all
     Intelec satellite SysOps,  regardless of a direct connect to the Host.
     Intelec satellite SysOps are welcome to use the Intelec Host for their
     uplink,  but regardless if you are an Intelec  Hub or Node,  the above
     guidelines must be followed. Please apply directly to the Intelec Host
     (Intelec Online) if this is your preference to connect direct with us.

                          ³ Moderator Rules and Tips ³
                          ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
     The Chief Moderator (CM) Rod Wardlow, is Moderators of all Moderators.
     CM is responsible for settling any disputes  between users/moderators.
     CM may join any conference  to see to the "enforcement"  of net rules.
     Moderators go to the CM 1st for help with conference related problems.
     CM can  overrule a moderator if  for the best interest of the network.
     If you disagree with the CM's ruling, appeal to the Net Administrator.

     Moderators can be removed  should they fail in their responsibilities.
     Keep our distribution files handy. You are expected to know our rules.

     Keep mail on topic. Direct off-topic posts to appropriate conferences.
     Before responding to off topic posts, make sure it's not a cross-feed.
     Report any cross-feeds, duplicates  to the Net Administrator (not CM).

     Moderators must have access to the Moderators conf  on their home BBS.
     Moderators must read  NetAdmin, Moderators and U-2-M on regular basis.
     In  NetAdmin and U-2-M  you may use the YA option of your mail reader.

     Do not criticize, critique other moderators, and especially in public.
     If you think a moderator needs some advice,  do so only in Moderators.

     Conference specific guidelines  may be used if for conference success.
     All conference specific guidelines  must be approved by the CM  first.

     Be sure your position is known.  ID yourself as the moderator in sigs.
     Never use your "official sig" out of your conf except for admin confs.

     Besides representing your conference your "actions" represent Intelec.
     Display diplomacy, tact, decorum and good communication skills.  Never
     fan user's flames by insulting in return, be polite and avoid sarcasm.
     Moderators making inflammatory statements can be removed as moderator.

     When moderating user make sure they know they got an official warning.
     Include words "1st, 2nd, Official Warning"  in warnings to your users.
     Ask for acknowledgement of the warnings (to counter-act user excuses).
     Inform the CM of Official Warnings. Include user name tag and subject.
     If users choose to dispute your moderations direct them to USER-2-MOD.

     Suspensions are granted/denied by CM  after a review of the situation.
     1st priority considered for suspension is non-compliance to our rules.
     Moderators can't suspend users on their own  but by request to the CM.
     The CM can't Ban (TCAN) anyone. This is done by the Net Administrator.

     Administrator can moderate a user(s) without going to moderator first.
     If Administrator moderates one of your users,  you might also want to.

     Welcome new participants to your conference  soon after their arrival.
     If 1st reaction is to blast away with warnings,  step back, calm down.
     Consider the lag time. User may break same rule before getting warned.
     Keep a "notebook or file record" to serve as reminders of moderations.
     When in doubt,  ask.  Use Moderators conference for exchange of ideas.
     Get help if you're not sure of your authority handing some situations.
     Moderators should keep their personal beliefs  out of decision making.
     Be impartial. Religious/political viewpoints may cloud your judgement.
     Avoid letting users know your beliefs  on any subjects of controversy.
     Put yourself in another persons shoes when trying to cool off dispute.
     Do not let this hobby get to you.  You are dealing with diverse users.
     Active interest in the conference topic  is helpful  but not required.
     If your mail traffic drops too low,  attempt to stimulate new threads.
     Plug your conference in confs similar to yours (get permission first).
     Moderator may allow ads to be placed in conference only if beneficial.
     Intelec prohibits "vendor ads/posts" in any conference except ForSale.

                            ³ Bans and Suspensions ³
                            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
     "Network Tcans" are subject to sole approval of the Net Administrator.
     Request for suspension or bans must be done in Moderator's conference.
     Suspensions/net-wide bans are determined by  the following procedures:

     1 - Warning must come from the moderator before administrative action.
     2 - If violation is severe or blatant enough, 1 above is not required.
     3 - If incident is repeated, then 30 day suspension is a minimum term.
     4 - Offenses need not be the same type  nor in the same conference(s).
     5 - Administrator can Ban or CM can Suspend the user  if situation #2.
     6 - A 90 day minimum probationary period follows all bans/suspensions.

     Moderator may request user suspensions only with conditions 1-4 above.
     Temporary suspensions are 30 days, unless shortened/extended by Admin.
     If users break rules while suspended they will be banned from the net.
     Bans are any term, inc. "until further notice" as determined by Admin.
     Bans are "conference specific or network-wide" as determined by Admin.

     The CM, upon enacting a user suspension,  will inform the users' SysOp
     that he/she's been suspended for 30 days from a conference  and inform
     that SysOp to remove the user's access to it. Upon a network-wide sus-
     pension or ban SysOps may appeal the decision on behalf of the user in
     the Moderators conference but may only take place after the suspension
     or ban has been enforced by the suspended users' SysOp.

     Conference must have sufficient user interest before it is considered.
     Conference construed as "adult or immoral" cannot be added to Intelec.
     Conference can't be related to existing one, unless it's a branch off.
     Conference must have a moderator  prior to being added to the network.
     Moderators are "appointed" by Net Administrator, make requests to him.
     New conferences are added to the Host BBS, the 1st of the month  only.

     Fido compatible Intelec BBS must relay through an authorized FTS site.
     Applications requesting to use software not listed can't be processed.
     If something isn't shown here then we don't support it (at this time).
     If you want to have new software added, drop me (Cliff Watkins) a note
     in our NetAdmin conference and we may set up a test to see if it's OK.
     All softwares used to relay Intelec Network mail *must* be registered.

                             ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
     Acceptance to Intelec Network is determined by the Administrator or an
     Intelec Super Reg, Regional or Hub SysOp  that is authorized to handle
     this. NOT ALL Intelec hubs have this authority, such as Rose Media and
     FutureTron. Incomplete and/or outdated applications are not processed.
     Administrator  reserves the right  to admit or refuse any BBS SysOp as
     participating member of the Intelec Network. The Network Administrator
     also reserves the right to remove or suspend net access  of any member
     SysOp for any action considered detrimental to the goals spirit or the
     quality of the Intelec Network  or  for failure to abide by our rules.

     sending or receiving of confidential electronic communications. Though
     Intelec maintains the capability or capacity  to send and receive mail
     that is flagged as "Receiver-Only", mail flagged as such  is not to be
     considered by any user as actual "private" messages. Intelec Online is

     Membership fee is a $35 one-time charge due within 10 days of approval
     (not from the beginning of relays).  Any failure of this fee to arrive
     within this time frame  can result in the termination of access to the
     network  if access was granted prior.  It can result in the decline of
     the application  if previously approved. But as in most cases, network
     relay can't begin until the network fee arrives. If a SysOp is removed
     from the network for network rule infractions or in the case of fraud-
     ulent applications the fee is not refundable. Make payment with either
     check or money order and it MUST be in the form of US dollars.  Non-US
     applicants MUST use a Postal Money Order ONLY  and only in US dollars.
     Personal checks cannot be accepted from Non-US applicants.  There is a
     $20.00 fee for any returned checks.  Make payable to Cliff Watkins and
