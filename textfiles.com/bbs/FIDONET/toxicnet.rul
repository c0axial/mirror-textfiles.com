                               - ToXiCNeT Rules -


o No fighting at all or that user will be removed from the net and maybe your
  board if the entire board is doing it (ie: you are responsible for your
  user's actions).

o Keep one line messages to a minimum (a few of these are called for at points,
  but if about 1/4 to 1/3 of your messages are onelined, you will be warned).

o User's macros should be no more than 3-4 lines (meaning I don't want to see
  macros bigger than the post itself).

o If you are asked to remove a user from the net then you must do so (even if
  he/she is part of your staff) or your board will be removed from the net.

o Make sure that your users save their ansi screens for fido format, (ie: save
  length should about 78).

o It's the duty of all ToXiCNeT SysOp's to review ALL outgoing mail and 
  delete posts that are not worthy of being passed through.  It's also their
  duty to punish their users for things that they've done on the net that is
  not allowed.

o All ToXiCNeT SysOp's are responsible for obtaining the latest nodelisting
  (Which will be released about 1 per week, usually on sunday, and they are
  available on Bodily Harm (609)).

o If your system will be down for some time, it is your responsiblity to tell 
  FusioN that your board will be down, or else you will be removed from the
  nodelist.

o Use common sense when giving people access to the net, don't let the
  average "Joe Blow" have access to the net, although he has access to your
  elite.
