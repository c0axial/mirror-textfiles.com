
To those of you who are interested in caving ("spelunking"), consider joining

                               CAVENET!

CaveNet is a loose aggregation of Fido, GT_Power, RIME and QWK boards. I am
gating the mail into/out of Fido-tech boards, and we have others that gate
the mail into the others. It is FREE, but you will have to poll me (Bruce
Bowman, 1:231/710) on a regular basis to pick up your mail and send outgoing
mail into CaveNet.

Below are the echo tags -- descriptions of each are present in the current
FidoNet Echolist. Several of these conferences are also gated into InterNet
mailing lists...

 CN_ADMIN
 CN_GENERAL
 CN_NSS
 CN_SURVEY
 CN_DIVING
 CN_TAG
 CN_MVOR
 CN_VAR
 CN_OVR
 CN_CONSERV
 CN_VERTICAL
 CN_BATLINE

All sysops carrying any CaveNet conferences are required to carry the ADMIN
conference as well.

Although we were initially concerned about whether CaveNet would popularize
caving and cause increased caver traffic, in practice we had little to worry
about. Now, we hope to see CaveNet grow and develop. Traffic is a little slow
right now since everyone is out caving! The more boards that join us, the
more entertaining things will become.
