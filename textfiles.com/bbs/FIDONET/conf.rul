    -----------------------------------------------------

   Gating of ISGnet(r) conferences is permitted ( WITH PERMISSION
   from the Zone Council Chairman). We wish to keep track of who
   is gating I_S_G Echos.

   All Messages entered ( posted ) in any ISGnet(r) conference
   become the property of the ISG NetWork and may not be reposted
   on any other BBS or NETwork without PERMISSION from the
   Zone Council Chairman.
   
  No ISGnet(r) conference is bound by FidoNet or ANY OTHER NET,
  it's open to any network and system that wish to carry the
  conference, and with any Net or Echo software (FrontEnd mailers
  or QWK Packet's ect ), (assuming all rules are followed). Messages
  in this conference should conform with the POLICY4 and FTSC
  (FidoNet Technical Standards Committee) format and must contain
  a tear and origin line. The tear line may not be longer than 35
  characters including the --- characters. The origin line must fit on
  one 80 character wide CRT including the " # Origin: " text.

  Please keep the amount of quoted text down to the BARE ESSENTIALS.
  Do not quote SEEN-BY and/or " # Origin: " information unless it is
  ABSOLUTELY necessary. 

  Your message must remain on topic and contain sufficient information
  to allow a Reply  via NetMail through known channels.

  Foul or harsh language is not tolerable and will not be accepted.
  If you don't like what someone has to say for personal reasons, send
  them a reply using NetMail - not EchoMail.

  Eight-bit ASCII is not allowed in any ISGnet(r) conference. All characters
  in displayed message data (text/header) must be in the range 32 to 126,
  which rules out control characters. The exception to this rule is if
  you need to show someone a translation table that contains eight-bit
  ASCII.

  YOUR MESSAGE MUST REMAIN ON TOPIC:

  File listings, "Thank you", This is a TEST and ADVERTISEMENTS
   of any kind are not welcome either except in the appropriate echo.

  NO FLAMES: Flames will not be accepted in any ISGnet(r) conference
             except the LA FLAME conference.

  Sample files and exsamples of batch files are welcome as they serve a purpose.

  If the moderator tells you, you're out of line, or tells you to
  take it to netmail, DO SO FAST or you are history.
