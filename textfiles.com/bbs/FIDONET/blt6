   In order to understand Free speech, you must also understand 1 very
   important point.

   Your free speech stops, when you log onto a ThrobNet node.

  Free speech in America is important, and we fully support the right to
  have it. But we also support the right of the sysop to protect himself
  from being harrassed by the local authorities.

  We, being an all adult network, allow most anything to be discussed.
  However, you must know there are some no-no's in ThrobNet.

     1. No trading of or discussing kiddie porn.
     2. No trading of or discussing beastiality pic's.
     3. No trading of or discussing snuff films.

  Beyond this, your freedom of speech is welcomed, but please remember to
  remain on topic.
