                      The International Sysop's Guild
                      Who and What is ISG all about ?

The International Sysop's Guild  is open to all "active" Sysops, running
any BBS, anywhere world wide. We charge no fees and make no demands, we
only ask you to listen to what we have to say and think about it before
responding. We only want to excel and enrich what our callers see.

This is an alliance of System Operators "Sysop's" There goal is to set
standards for the member BBS's, to better serve our callers.

To in essence make more information and services available to a greater
number of people. To promote the use of BBS's and telecommunications as
more than just another useless computing hobby.

It is our goal to provide a level of exemplary services through the
interaction of all the member BBS's, and to be of assistance to our
callers, and each other whenever we can.

As a group we can effect representation within local, state and national
lawmaking circles.  We can petition Telephone Companies, The Media and T
FCC to see what BBSing is all about. Pass information to fellow members.

We feel its time to blend our resources and take the next big step forwa
To pool our ideas and knowledge and present them in a new format "a coal
of all Sysop's working together for the same excellence. Its time to com
our efforts towards the better BBS.

With an association like this one we can have a show of good citizen
users, state or nationwide with several hundred b.b.s systems as
members.

This association will expend an all out effort to have competent bulleti
board sysops from all areas.

I.S.G. is not affiliated with any network other then ISGNet, But individ
members do belong to various networks and there should be a gated
networked conference / echo for I.S.G. in the near future.
