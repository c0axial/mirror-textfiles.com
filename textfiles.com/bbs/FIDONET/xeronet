II. HISTORY

XeroNet's first policy officially drafted 15 JUL 94.
The first draft of policy was dated 15 JUL 94 although 
XeroNet BBS's were actually running months prior to 
release of official documents.

XeroNet was established as a network between Bulletin Board Services
in the United States and Canada for the exchange of information
via posts and electronic mail. The original founding Boards are :
            
            Bear Facts II (USA) 1-515-287-2008 
     The Inner Sanctum (CANADA) 1-905-732-9826



III. STANDARDS

The official language of XeroNet is English.

The rules and regulations associated with running a XeroNet board are
as follows:

A. General

In general, a XeroNet board is an honourable system which does not
discriminate against users because of race, religion, creed,
nationality, sex, age or other reason except for instances to protect
the user.

B. SysOp Character and Conduct

System Operators of bulletin boards must be of good standing.  All SysOps
are expected to keep the private information including but not limited
to name, password, phone number, and address of all users on all nodes
strictly confidential.  No exceptions.

XeroNet SysOps are not to participate in the planning or actual
participation of computer hacking other bulletin boards, and must openly
proclaim any knowledge they might have regarding such an event.

XeroNet SysOps may connect to any and as many XeroNet nodes as they
desire. At no time will any XeroNet SysOp be forced to connect to
node(s) that he/she wishes not to.  All connections must be approved and
installed by the NC or their designee.

All XeroNet SysOps are required to remain in XeroNet for 3 months upon
entry.

Sending non-message files through the network requires the advance
approval of all nodes though which the file will pass.

Sending unsolicited Multi-Mail is strictly prohibited in XeroNet.

Taglines shall be three lines max and shall not use ANSI codes.  Sig
hosts may require or allow other guidelines to posts.

SysOps are expected to refrain from abusing users and will deal with
disruptions on their board in a mature manner. Problem users should be
dealt with via e-mail, have their access lowered, or simply barred from
participation in XeroNet Message bases.

XeroNet boards are not to engage in pirating activities such as
advertising the availability of stolen software, asking for commercial
software, or encouraging the participation of pirating or exchanging of
software that is made for sale by the author.  XeroNet boards are not to
engage in any illegal activities, including phreaking or carding.

XeroNet policy does not mean your board will be inspected or policed by
XeroNet. Federal law provides severe civil and criminal penalties
including fines and imprisonment for the unauthorized reproduction or
distribution of copyrighted computer programs (Title 17, U.S.C.
Sections 501 and 506, et. al.).

IV. JOINING XeroNet / REQUIREMENTS

To join XeroNet, you must have your own BBS running FIDO compatable
software.  Your board must be up for at least 1 month to join XeroNet;
this may be waved by the NC.  By agreeing to policy at the bottom of 
your application you are committing to XeroNet at least 3 months of 
your life, subject to approval of your application.

You are not required to register your BBS software to join XeroNet. 
You will be expected to register your BBS to help assure the continued
support of the Author of the software, and to help protect the
investment made by other XeroNet SysOps who have already registered
theirs.

You are expected to run a real names only BBS.  It is expected to 
have a real name in the echoes.  Writing to Aliases is not preferred.
If for some reason you run an Alias BBS, software permitting toggle 
XeroNet conferences for real names only.  If your software is configured 
to only accept aliases and can not toggle real names, your BBS maybe 
considered as long as your users enter real names at the end of their 
messages.  When entering your real name you must print first and last
name. <ie  Judge Dredd  aka Jamie Lee >.   SysOps running alias BBS's 
will be held responsible for their users actions.

Also all echoes are expected to be policed by all XeroNet SysOps.
There will be no profanity allowed in the echoes.  All SysOps will be
responsible for their users actions.  And the SysOp will be expected to 
take appropriate actions, including discontinue of posting.

XeroNet does not support the use of private node numbers in 
the nodelist. A private node number was supplied to the ZEC
temporarily for administrative purposes until permanent 
accomodations can be setup.
