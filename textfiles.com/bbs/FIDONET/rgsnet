* The Ultimate Renegade Support network!  Read on....


What is it?
-----------
Renegade Support Network (RGSNet) is an open, easy-going
message network devoted to the support of Renegade Bulletin
Board Systems.  RGSNet has been in operation since
September, 1993.  Our current member list exceeds 800 nodes. 
Although Renegade is the most popular software used in the 
network, any sysop is welcome regardless of BBS software.

What are the rules?
-------------------
1. You must use real names.  This can be done in Renegade by 
   toggling the 'R'eal names flag to 'on' in all the RGSNet 
   message areas. 
   
   Exceptions: RGS_DOORS - Handles ok, must sign with Real Name.
               RGS_CHAT  - Handles ok.
               RGS_BRE50 - Handles ok.

2. You must use a front-end mailer such as FrontDoor.  I 
   suggest using FrontDoor v2.12 Noncommercial, but other mailers 
   such as Portal of Power, D'Bridge, and BinkleyTerm work fine.

3. All systems MUST be 300 baud or higher.  
   Sorry, no 110 baud here.  :-)

4. Simple!


How do I join?
--------------
All you need to do is contact your local RGSNet node for the latest 
InfoPack and Application Kit.  Freq'ing "RGSNET" from any of the 
following sites will also get you the latest RGSNet InfoPack:

USA West     -    Scott Freeman   -    1:219/801
USA East     -    John Doran      -    1:278/315
Canada       -    Vincent Vallee  -    1:167/337
NZ/Australia -    Wayne Knott     -    3:772/390
Israel       -    Benji Selano    -    2:403/652

Run the file APPGEN.EXE to automatically create a short text
file with vital information needed to apply.  Once you have 
completed the application, netmail the file created with your
information to your state host (preferably, if there is one), 
or the Network Coordinator at 50:50/0, or upload it to 
619-251-0609 or 619-251-1675, Alternate Reality BBS.

If you know your state host's address, please send the 
application to that address, the turn-around time is 
much quicker that way.

Once your application is reviewed, you will be sent a node 
number and nodelist via netmail in ZIP form.  Or, if you 
cannot be reached via netmail, we will try our best to send 
it via your BBS. Please allow 7-10 days for your application 
to be reviewed and a new node number assigned (we receive 
them almost every day and it is sometimes difficult
to keep up), please be patient.

* NOTE: You must be using a front-end mailer such as FrontDoor 
        to join RGSNet.
