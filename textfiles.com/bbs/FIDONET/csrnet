        What is CSRNet? Well, simply put, CSRNet is a gateway for
  INTERNET Private E-Mail and USENET NewsGroups. If you have been
  looking for a way to get an INTERNET feed for your BBS or just
  for personal reasons, then CSRNET is for you. We currently have
  State Co-Ordinators is many states in the U.S. as well as sever-
  al Provincial Co-Ordinators in Canada.

        If you have the ability to process mail via a FrontEnd
  Mailer and a Mail Tosser for your BBS in .PKT format, or via
  .QWK packets and a Mail Tosser for your BBS, you have EVERYTHING
  you require to recieve our gated INTERNET Private E-Mail and
  USENET NewsGroups Feed! All the conversions that are neccessary
  have already been performed and all you need to to is dial in
  and grab your mail! We are NOW capable of providing NewsGroup and
  InterNet Private E-Mail via UUCICO.

        CSRNET is currently carrying approxiamtely 5200 of the
  7,000+ USENET NewsGroups. We have access to all of these news-
  groups and are able to get any of them activated. Please refer
  to the CSRNET.ZIP file for further information on this sub-
  ject. These available NewsGroups range from Beer Making to
  Abortion Debates to Elvis Sightings to Thesis Papers on Aids.
  Basically, if there is a subject to be talked about, its
  available as a NewsGroup!

        ALSO, an area that has been MUCH improved apon has been
  the handling of InterNet Private E-Mail.  We are NOW sending and
  receiving DIRECT, ROUTED InterNet Private E-Mail.  Each downlink
  BBS (FTS-.PKT) format, now have their OWN UNIQUE BBS MAP name that
  allows their system to receive ONLY messages for users on THEIR
  BBS!!! This feature is ***FREE*** with your Mail feed and Admin-
  istration Payment of JUST $10/month!!! Beat that!
