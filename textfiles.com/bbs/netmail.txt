                              Net Mail Doc

  NET MAIL is public or private messages transmitted from one BBS to another
  BBS.  This is accomplished by  Addressing the Message to a particular BBS.
  NetMail is not only for  SysOps but can be used by anyone  (often by prior
  arrangement if a long distance call is required  ..for example for someone
  in Nashville sending a message to someone in California). You can in fact,
  on quite a few systems, make arrangements with the SysOp to send a file to
  another BBS for pick up by a friend.
  When we send to another  BBS we use thier NetWork Address.  If the BBS you
  are on has a  NetMail message section, chances are, they are a member of a
  Network.  How to enter messages in the NetMail area depends quite a lot on
  the BBS software.  But most all of the Software will prompt you for a Net,
  and Node Number of the BBS you are sending to. Sometimes (depending on the
  Network) you may even need to know the  Zone and  Region of the BBS. It is
  really not as  complicated as it sounds  --  Imagine trying to explain how
  the  telephone system  works to  someone who has never used it.  It's easy
  once you get the hang of it.



a typical GhotiNet Address:     (GhotiNet is a Network. Prononunced Fish Net)
          ^^^^^^^^          6:5555/422
             |              ^ ^^^^ ^^^
  Network Name              |   |   |
                    ZONE ---|   |   |---NODE
                               NET

        Network - a Group of BBSs which all have the ability to exchange
             mail via a common carrier and similar software. In the case
             of  GhotiNet  all  systems are  Binkley  compatable  (which
             follow the FTS (Fido Technical Standards).
        Nodelist - a listing that the BBS software uses as a `phone-book'
             of members of the Network.  In a Network BBSs refer to each
             other  by  thier  Network  address.  GhotiNet  calls  thier
             Nodelist GHOTLIST.
        Zone - the largest division of the Nodelist often a Continent or
             as in GhotiNet the entire Network uses the same Zone.
        Region - the  Next to the  largest  division of the  Nodelist. a
             region  may be as  small as a  state and as  large as  many
             states.  Ghoti divides thier regions into individual states
             from an alpha listing starting with states of the U.S.A.
        Net - a  `local'  group of  BBSs which  usually are within local
             calling area.  In the above  example it is  local  GhotiNet
             5555.
        Node - a BBS or System. A private Node is a Private System which
             all  mail is  routed through thier Hub.  GhotiNet uses even
             numbers for full time  Systems or  BBSs and odd numbers for
             part-time or private systems.



        Bridge - in the case of a BBS it is a BBS belonging to more than
             one Network who can send NetMail to either,  or  (as in the
             case of Control Systems) other BBSs can send mail addressed
             to his BBS  which will then be readressed and sent into the
             other Network.  In the  case of two  Networks with  totally
             different technologies the BBS is often called a Gateway.
        Hub - A network mail helper. A BBS which routes mail (and Files)
             in the Network.  In some cases a  Hub may  supply an entire
             segment of the community with echos  or even route to Long-
             distance Nodes within a local Net. A Hub can be a NetHub or
             a  Regional Hub or even a  Star System which  routes within
             the entire Zone or Network.
        Coordinators - a  SysOp  who  has  volunteered  to help  out and
             coordinate  activity within the Network.  Activity  such as
             keeping the  correct  listings  in the Nodelist.  To join a
             Net you would  apply with the  Network Coordinator  (NC) in
             your local area.  There are also Regional Coordinators (RC)
             and Zone Coordinator(s).


-------
 Now remember that  NetMail and  EchoMail are really two different flavors of
 mail.  Consider  Echomail  public  conversations   and  Netmail  more  of  a
 one-on-one  communication.  And don't  let anyone  kid  you,  the  SysOp can
 always read Private  mail.
 Often in an  echo you will see what is  known as an  origin line.  An origin
 line is always at the end of a message  to let everyone know the originating
 systems address. For example;

 *Origin: The Best BBS in New York City "Izzies Hideout" (8:3542/221.0)


It often includes a slogan and the Name of the BBS. The address (X:XXXX/XXX.X)
is defined as Zone:Net/Node.Point - we will need this address in order to send
netmail to the person writing the message.

Lets say  John on Izzies HideOut wrote a message in an Echo which you wanted
to give a private response to. Now you couldn't do that in the echo and even
if the BBS you were using supported private messages in that echo,  it would
most likely not be recieved as a private message. Net mail is the way to go.
Go to the  Net mail  message area of the  BBS  and enter a message. Many BBS
software handles  Net Mail  prompts differently.  You can almost bet that if
your message will require a  Long Distance call the software will reqire you
to obtain credit with the  system to send your message.  Many SysOps will be
most happy to oblige and the cost is often very small.  This may require you
to send the  SysOp some  small donation to cover the call,  in much the same
way if i used your phone to make a long distance call.  On many  BBS's the ?
will get you  help  at any  prompt.  You will need to enter the  Name of the
person you are sending to and the address of the BBS which he reads his mail
on.  For the address if the Zone is the same then you do not need to enter a
Zone in the address.  You do however always need to enter a Net/Node Number.
Most  BBS software has not caught up to  point technology  yet so you do not
need to worry about it.  But  if it is  important I would drop a line to the
SysOp to be sure they forward the message  to the point system.  In GhotiNet
Points are not used. The philosphy being that Private systems are considered
an integral part of the community as well as full time BBS's.

A  bridge is a  BBS  that belongs to more than one  Network.  Often a bridge
supports sending net mail to either  one zone or another or,  in the case of
different networks, one network or the other.

A word about Zones;  It is not  always that a  BBS that you use supports Net
Mail to all the zones.  The SysOp  does not often  compile `other' nodelists
than the Network they belongs to.  If you see an address with  leading zeros
(and without a  zone reference),  for example  008/010  then  it is a  GtNet
message  and that message can only be responded to by either GtNetMail or if
the BBS you are using connects to a Gt/Fido Bridge. There are currenlty only
a handfull of these bridges in existance.  The first is in  Nashville TN and
called CONTROL SYSTEMS (007/001, 1:116/36, 6:5555/30 and 7:721/29).  Many of
the  Sysops in Nashville who carry the  Gt Echos will send a message through
the Bridge for you. Zones 1, 2, and 3 is traditionally FidoNet and i believe
a recent addition of  zone 4 also)  -  in FidoNet  zones  are  geographic by
continent.  Zone 6 is GhotiNet (pronounced Fish Net) growing Nation wide and
originating  in  Nashville TN.  Zone 7  is  AlterNet  which now  encompasses
America,  Canada, and Europe.  Zone 8 is RBBS Net. Zone 9 is Phoenix Net. If
you see a different looking address (different from the Net/Node technology)
such as   @System.My.Comp.Bob.etc   it is  often  an  address of  UseNet  or
Compuserv or  other<tm>  Nets which may even be a  commercial network.  Many
UseNet bridges are currently members of GtNet, FidoNet and AlterNet.

Now you  must  realize  that there is a difference between Echo mail and Net
Mail.  If you send a Net message (private) to  6:5556/318 to John Smith only
John Smith (and the SysOp) would be able to read that message.
Often a  Moderator  will  refer  two users  fighting or  carrying on to  use
Net Mail.  Net  mail  originally  was the  only  form of  communication that
was  available.  A message  went  from one  BBS  to another.  Echo mail  was
designed as conferenced Mail to share and have everyone participate.
Originally the `echoing' software supported  only all public messages  (non-
Private).  Since then the technology has changed and there is software which
supports  private  messages  in echos though it is not currently being used.
There are exceptions to the rule though  and upon this  writing i know of at
least  two echos which support  private messages. The ADULT Echo - a FidoNet
National Echo  which is for  adult singles only  and the  GAMEROOM  Echo - a
Nashville Local echo.
