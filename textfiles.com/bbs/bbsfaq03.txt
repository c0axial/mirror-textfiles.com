INTRODUCTION TO REMOTE ACCESS
==============================
The Remote Access BBS-package has been written by Andrew Milner, and
is released by Wantree Development. The current version of Remote
Access (RA) is 2.01. 
 
RemoteAccess should run on any IBM 80x86 compatible computer. The only
two programs you will need in addition to the release package are DOS
3.x and a FOSSIL driver (the FOSSIL is a memory-resident program that
many communications packages use to communicate with the modem). Two
FOSSILs that have been successfully tested with RemoteAccess are Ray
Gwinn's X00, and David Nugent's BNU. Either of these should be readily
available from any local bulletin board. You will also need a modem 
that is capable of accepting Hayes-type commands. The minimum memory
requirement is approximately 350K, but 512K is recommended.


WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF REMOTE ACCESS?
====================================
At the time of this release, there's no known address (Internet, 
FidoNet, BBS, or `snail mail') provided for Andrew Milner.
Any one with information on how to contact the author please send
e-mail to BBSFAQ@AOL.COM or clairew@pluto.njcc.com

FEATURES
==========
The archive containing the Shareware version of Remote Access doesn't
contain a separate list of features. The registered version does. It 
has one at the beginning of the manual that is sent to you after 
registration. You should keep in mind that this list is taken from the
manual of the professional version, which differs from the registered
shareware version in a few respects. Please refer to the registration
topic of this section for an overview of the extra features of the
professional version.

To find out which features aren't available in the non-registered
version, you'll have to skim through the RA.DOC file you'll find in 
the RA_201 archive. The non-registered version isn't crippled in any
way. The only difference is, it does not include a few features the
registered version offers, but does not interfere with the BBS
operation.

REGISTRATION
---------------
You may try RA for a period of three weeks on a trial basis in order
to determine it's suitability for your particular application. After 
this period you must register each copy of Remote Access that you run
simultaneously. Multi-line installations that share a common file base 
and have the same name need only register one copy. Site and Group 
registrations are available, and are dealt with on a case by case
basis.
 
Registration can be done in two ways, depending on the kind of system
you are running. There is a shareware and a professional registration.

For a shareware registration a system must be physically run from a 
noncommercial site. A site is considered to be noncommercial only if
it is a private residence at which no commercial activities are
conducted.

NOTE: As of this release, the shareware version only supports a 
maximum of two (2) nodes. The Professional version supports up to 250.
 
Shareware Registration can be done at the following sites, at the
following prices:

or commercial activities are conducted at the site). The professional 
version includes three modules that are not available in the shareware
version:
1. Real-Time Conferencing - supporting up to 250 users concurrently,
   featuring public/private/password-protected conferences,
   conference moderators and sub-conferences.
2. RANETMGR -  The RemoteAccess Network Manager, a utility designed
   to give you complete control over a busy multi-node system.
   Dynamically view the status of each node as users log on and off,
   what each user is doing, broadcast messages to any combination of
   nodes and automatically take any combination of nodes down for
   maintenance.
3. RAEdit - A fully functional, specially customised and registered
   version of GEdit, a premium full-screen message editor.

The professional version supports up to 250 nodes and 100 languages,
while the shareware version supports a maximum of eight languages and 
2 nodes.

systems, the RGSNet, can be accessed from many Renegade systems for
questions or comments.  Forums on FidoNet are also dedicated to 
Renegade discussion.

ROBOBOARD BBS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

INTRODUCTION
==============
Roboboard BBS is a Graphical user interface. In order for the users
to connect to your BBS they will have to use a special terminal
program. The program may be downloaded at the first connection.
Opposed to other BBS's which have a graphical interface as an option
(That is BBS who support RIP protocol), and can be used without the
GUI, Roboboard is GUI only. There is no ANSI - Ascii option.

Looking at the pro's & con's of RoboBoard
===========================================

PRO's
-----
1) On contrary to other packages Robobard sysops can view the graphics
   locally.
2) The quality of the graphics is VGA <=> EGA
3) Supports a standard Hudson message base for networking.
4) Offline Mail option Using Silver Xpress version 4.01, which comes      
   with it's built in graphic screens.
5) Drawing, and planning menus is very easy and intuitive.
6) Installation is very simple, and takes about 5 minutes to get the
   BBS up and running.
7) Built in DeskView support.
8) Supports dorinfoX.def doors
9) Will run on a 286 and higher. The FX needs a 386 on both the sysop   
   and the users' side.
10) Built in Split screen chat
11) Supports speed up to 38000
12) Registered version will support up to nine nodes, including built
    in IRC like chat.
13) Comes in with predefined screens resembling a nice "Windows " look.
14) Supports one channel music.
 
CONS
-----
1) Security and other configurable options are not part of the     
   configuration and are determined in a separate file.
2) Message handling is weak. Only full quoting of the text is possible.
3) Not many doors available for the Graphical format.    
4) Some of the optional files and screens disabled in the Shareware   
   version.
5) Limited command options. You will have to build your screens with
   few commands as options.

is currently Craig Baker, a professional programmer who also runs
a computer store in Boulder, CO. UltraBBS is a shareware DOS program
