          <<<<< REVIEW: ATLANTIS  (215-464-4770) >>>>>
       (By "Roger." "Gene" is on vacation 'til next issue)

ATLANTIS, in Pennsylvania, is one of the best anarchist boards
around. Its gphiles aren't as good as those of some of the top
boards, like RIPCO and some others, but it's still ranking up
there as a pretty cool national board. Its users are from all
over the country, so you get a good mix. It was running apple
last time we checked, but is usually busy, so you have to be
patient.

The chat runs from lame highschool kid stuff like "why I hate
algebra" to fairly sophisticated technical stuff. Deepdiver tries
to keep stuff organized and under control, and does a decent job.

The warez aren't all that hot, but if you're patient and hang
around, you might be able to pull down some interesting goods.
The text philes are its strength. There's all kinds of goodies on
pyro-technics, and other junk that most of us learned in 11th
grade chemistry that some idiots still like to mess around with.
We don't go for all this rah-rah razzle dazzle silly shit, 'cause
it's too dangerous. A couple of high schoolers blew themselves up
a while back, and it was claimed that they got the idea for it
from these kinds of anarchists boards, and there was some
pressure in some places around the country to crack down on some
of it, but not with a lot of success.

So, if you're looking for a decent board, this one gets a "THUMBS
UP" from gene and roger, but thumbs down for any lamer who tries
anything fancy by trying to be a closet rambo demolitions pro.
They only take applications on the first five days of each month,
tho, so you might not get on right away.

Here's some apple boards passed on to us. Thanks to the gang
at HILL OF TARA (815-727-4020) who collected them. Most are
apparently still up, and some are elite. Have fun!
