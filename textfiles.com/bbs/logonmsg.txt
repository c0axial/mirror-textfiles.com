Darkness is light, light is pain.  A thousand screams echo in the halls of
your mind; a thousand hands reach to grasp you...  You are not alive -- but
you can't be dead.

The sky and the ground become one...  Six hundred and sixty six faceless
spectres rise to torment you.  Your eyes boil and pour into the void -- your
flesh melts and mingles with that of your demon keepers.  Birth is the end of
happiness...  Death a dream not to be realized.

You awaken....

Through the narcotic induced haze you see a brass door.  Within is the balm of
survival, for happiness has long been lost to you....  You know that you must
struggle on to get your hypodermic of salvation....

You must again enter...
