      About this File
      ---------------

      BBS Basics ran originally as separate articles in the first nine
      issues of the Pasco BBS Magazine from January 1993 to September
      1993.  In September of 1993 the articles were combined into an
      ASCII text file to help the growing number of people who are
      becoming aware of what bulletin boards have to offer.  That
      original file proved to be quite popular.  It can be found on
      bulletin boards all over the world for downloading, or as a
      bulletin for on-line reading.  Selected sections have been run in
      print magazines as well.  It seemed like there was a need to
      update BBS Basics on a regular basis and that is why version 2.0
      was created, and subsequent versions.  Some of the original text
      remains, but portions have been revised and new sections added to
      reflect the rapidly changing BBS world.  Version 2.0 introduced a
      new menu driven format, to make it easier for new users, but an
      ASCII version is still available.

      What is a BBS?
      --------------

      Has this ever happened to you?  You mention to a friend, who is
      not into computers, that you call around to Bulletin Board
      Systems.  You get a blank stare in return.  That same friend could
      look in their dictionary to find out what a BBS or Bulletin Board
      System is, but their search will come up empty.  While a growing
      number of people are becoming aware of what bulletin boards are,
      the above scenario remains realistic.  Yes, people still ask what
      is a BBS?

      The history of the BBS goes back to the Winter of 1978, when the
      first bulletin board software was written by Ward Christensen
      during a Chicago blizzard.  With his friend Randy Suess handling
      the hardware end of that first board, CBBS was officially born on
      February 16, 1978.  If you think that people today are not
      familiar with what a BBS is, imagine how many times Ward
      Christensen had to explain what this new creation was.
      Christensen has commented, "A lot of people say 'oh, is that the
      Christensen Bulletin Board System or the Chicago Bulletin Board
      System?' No, it's the Computerized Bulletin Board System, so we
      had to start kind of simple."

      An Electronic Bulletin Board System (or Service) is simply a
      computer hooked up to phone lines.  People may call the computer
      if their own computer has a modem and communications software.  A
      modem is a device which allows computers to talk to each other
      over the telephone lines.  The right communications software can
      make the job of connecting to a BBS quite simple.

      Today, bulletin board systems vary greatly.  From the small
      hobbyist to the big software companies support boards, each BBS
      has it own feel and selection of features.  Some may call
      themselves on-line services, or information services, but they are
      still bulletin boards.  Even America On-line, CompuServe, Prodigy
      and the MicroSoft Network are basically bulletin boards.  However,
      the majority of the tens of thousands of bulletin boards available
      today are set up by hobbyists for their own enjoyment.

      Once one calls a BBS, a whole new world of information, services
      and fun opens up.  Bulletin boards are one of the best places to
      get the latest in software for your PC, most of the time before
      you can get the programs through disk vendors.  Callers can also
      leave messages to people who call the board or discuss issues with
      computer users all over the world.  Many BBSs have games which you
      can play, sometimes against other callers.  Some boards offer
      unique services which cannot be obtained anywhere else.  The
      system operator (Sysop for short) tries to have all the
      information you will need to get started posted somewhere on the
      board, but most are more than happy to answer any questions users
      might have.


      Calling a BBS for the First Time
      --------------------------------

      Long log-on questionnaires and call back verification may be the
      complaint of the veteran BBSer, but can you remember back to your
      first call to a BBS?  It can be a little confusing, especially for
      the new computer user.  Bulletin Boards do have a habit of
      assuming the user knows what to expect when calling.

      Many first time BBS callers are calling on their first PC, and are
      using the inexpensive communications software which came with the
      computer.  A friend has given them some BBS numbers, so they call.
      They see some commands they don't understand and a bunch of jumble
      which seems to make little sense.  The new caller never gave
      configuration of his computer and software for graphics a thought,
      and the software may not even support graphics to begin with.
      Many potential users never call back and rely on disk vendors for
      Shareware.  Using a decent communication software package can make
      bulletin boards a much friendlier place to visit.

      Most of today's BBSs use ANSI or similar graphics.  The graphics
      are attractive, and great for games, but do slow down the
      transmission speed.  If you are calling with a slow speed modem,
      this can cause a substantial slow-down.  One of the first
      questions which many BBS software programs ask when calling is if
      you want graphics.  Unfortunately, some BBS software programs
      default into graphics and some have no way to exit the graphic
      mode.  This is a matter of preference, some people love graphics,
      other hate it.

      Now that you have dialed the BBS number, and settled the graphics
      question, you should be at the welcoming or log-on screen.  The
      first screen generally gives information about the board itself.
      BBS name, location, baud rates, available networks, or anything
      else the Sysop deems appropriate.  Then you are generally asked to
      give your name.  You should always use your real name when logging
      on to a bulletin board, even if the board does allow fictitious
      names (handles).  The Sysop has the responsibility and right to
      know who is accessing his BBS.  When you enter your name for the
      first time, the BBS software will ask if you have your name
      spelled correctly, or if you are a new user.  After selecting new
      user another screen, or screens, appear with information which the
      Sysop wants first time callers to know.  Normally, these screens
      contain things like welcoming comments, rules or where to find
      help.  You will then be asked if you want to register with the
      BBS.  If you answer yes, a questionnaire will follow.

      The new user questionnaires vary from board to board, but most ask
      for name, address and telephone number.  From there it depends on
      how the Sysop has set up his BBS software.  Some Sysops ask only a
      few pertinent questions, others have questionnaires which seem
      endless.  Again, always supply real and accurate information when
      answering the questions.  The questions normally include a couple
      on setting up the BBS software for your use.  Things like page
      length, transfer protocol, or hot keys.  If you are not sure, use
      the recommended (default) settings.  What is selected can be
      changed later.  After filling out the questionnaires most boards
      give limited access to the BBS until the verification process is
      completed.

      The verification process can take many forms.  Some Sysops will
      take the time to call by voice each and every caller to their
      board.  Other Sysops rely on the new caller ID technology and some
      force new callers into a call back verification.  In this day of
      caller ID, call-back verification seems like an awful lot of
      hassle to put the novice BBS caller through.  What happens is the
      BBS will log you off and try to call back at the number you
      entered during the questionnaire.  This way the Sysop knows that
      is a valid telephone number and that the information provided by
      the user is most likely accurate.  The problem is that many first
      time callers have trouble setting up their modem to answer the
      phone and are still looking at the manual when the verification
      call comes.  The call-back software has significantly improved and
      some can be activated from the keyboard.  Again, it is the Sysop's
      option which type of verification is used.

      On your first call to a BBS you will most likely have limited
      options.  Some boards will not allow file transfers and others
      will not allow anything until the user is verified and upgraded.
      The Sysop only does this to protect himself, and his substantial
      investment.  It is the Sysops option on how much the unverified
      user can do on his board.


      The Main Menu
      -------------

      After logging-on, and filling out the new user questionnaire, most
      BBSs have other screens before you actually reach the main menu.
      Most bulletin boards have news updates.  Also, things like the
      caller's statistics or advertising screens may be displayed before
      reaching the main menu.  All BBS software programs operate a
      little different, so you may have to go to sub-menus for some
      features.  One software program may automatically take the
      user through the bulletin menu before reaching the main menu,
      another may have sub-menus for messages or files.

      BBSs almost always have a sub menu for bulletins, after all they
      are called bulletin boards.  This is information which caller's
      can read on-line, and there are a limitless number of possible
      bulletins to select from.  Most Sysops have the board rules,
      general information, and help for new users.  Other popular
      bulletins are BBS listings, top scores for on-line games and
      newsletters.  The bulletin menu is a good place for new users to
      spend some time, as many Sysops have informational bulletins on a
      variety of BBS related topics.

      Some BBSs have questionnaires or user polls which can be accessed
      through the main menu, however, it is not uncommon for a BBS not
      to offer any questionnaires.  Sometimes these questionnaires are
      set up for fun, or maybe the Sysop would like some specific
      information from the users.  Some typical examples would include
      questionnaires on what users like about BBSing or a poll on the
      next election.  Support boards may have a questionnaire on their
      product, so feedback to specific questions can be received.  If
      the BBS has subscription fees for membership, a questionnaire may
      be used for on-line credit card registration.

      Most systems allow callers to page the system operator for a chat.
      If you have questions the Sysop may be available to talk to you
      on-line.  Most Sysops enjoy chatting with users, but it is
      considered good BBS etiquette not to ask questions which are
      answered fully elsewhere on the board.  You have nothing to lose
      by paging, at worse the Sysop will not be available.  The main
      menu normally offers some utility functions, so the settings you
      are using can be re-configured if required.  Some boards have a
      command to list all the users.  All this leads to main reasons
      people call bulletin board systems in the first place.


      Messages, Conferences and Networks
      ----------------------------------

      Unfortunately, a large percentage of today's bulletin board
      callers are not interested in reading messages.  They are more
      likely to be calling for files or to play on-line games.  However,
      the callers who have been at this awhile can remember when BBSs
      offered little else, and they still maintain an attraction for
      reading messages.  In the early days there was nothing called
      Shareware or the wide variety of game doors that are now
      available.  Yes, the BBS pioneers called primarily to talk to each
      other and to this day messages remain a major part of BBSing.

      In the simplest form, a message is left on a bulletin board system
      so another user may read it and reply.  A private message is left
      for just one person and no one else can read it.  It should be
      noted that you should never leave something in a message which you
      would be afraid to have someone else read, as there is no such
      thing as a truly private message.  Sysops can read messages or
      someone could download the message file, or capture file, and
      possibly read all messages.  Public messages are more fun, as
      everyone who accesses the system may read and maybe respond to the
      message.  Some systems may have quite a few messages and some
      messages may have been left some time ago, leaving sort of a
      system history.

      The problem with having numerous messages is that they may vary
      considerably as to topic, thus making the user have to wade
      through all the messages to find those which interest them.  This
      is how the idea of conferences came into being.  By having users
      enter messages in conferences, which pertain to a particular
      subject, all similar messages are grouped together.  BBSs may have
      a "for sale" conference, "teen" conference or "sports" conference.
      This way the users know where to go for messages which interest
      them.  The problem is that once the messages are separated into
      all the different conferences, there may be very few messages in
      each conference.  This is what brought about the development of
      networks.

      By linking computers together by networks, a message on one system
      is "echoed" to other systems.  Bulletin boards may choose to have
      network conferences, which pertain to whatever subjects the Sysop
      feels the users will enjoy the most, so that messages originally
      left on more than one system may be read.  This way the advantage
      of having specialized conferences is not hampered by having very
      few messages to read.  Another advantage of networks is that a
      user can leave a message on their local BBS for someone in another
      area, and thus avoid the long-distance telephone charges.  Some
      echo-mail networks are huge with thousands of systems all over the
      world.  But to be a network all it really takes is two BBSs and
      many networks start out this way.  Thousands of boards are calling
      each other, normally in the middle of the night, to transfer mail.
      Most boards are "nodes" which call the particular network "hub,"
      so messages can be received from a common place.  Larger networks
      may have "regional hubs" because the "network hub" could not
      handle all the systems calling each night.


      Shareware, Freeware and Public Domain
      -------------------------------------

      The one thing which has caused bulletin boards to increase in
      popularity are files, and there is little doubt that the majority
      of today's BBS users are more interested in files than any other
      feature.  What has caused the explosion in the number of available
      files on bulletin boards?  The success of Shareware more than
      anything else.

      Shareware is a new concept to many in the computer world who are
      used to buying software in a store, after just reading the
      packaging to decide which program to take a chance on.  Shareware
      is a revolutionary new marketing concept which encourages people
      to "try before they buy" any software.  If you like the program
      you are legally bound to pay a registration fee for continued use,
      if you don't like it just delete it and move on.  If you are
      looking for a typing tutor program, download half a dozen, then
      decide which you like best and register that program only.  Try
      going into your local computer store and buying a bunch of
      programs to "try before you buy," and returning all but the one
      you like.  You will be laughed out of the store.  Not only does
      Shareware allow it, but authors encourage you to give copies of
      their programs to your friends.  And if all that is not enough,
      most Shareware registration fees are considerably cheaper than
      what the "shrink-wrap" software companies are asking for their
      products.  And yes, the quality of Shareware rivals any other form
      of distribution.  Why do software authors send out their programs
      all over the world for people to use free of charge?  Because a
      growing percentage of people are supporting the Shareware
      marketing concept and sending in registration fees.  Due to the
      success of Shareware, more and more authors are turning to
      distributing programs that way.  This is the primary reason for
      the explosion in the number of files in the BBS world.

      The success of Shareware was not always guaranteed.  Many thought
      the early authors were foolish to think that people would be
      willing to pay for something which they already had.  The major
      software companies also did what they could to down-play this new
      form of competition.  Andrew Fluegelman, author of PC-Talk, and
      Jim Button, author of PC-File, are generally credited with the
      first efforts with Shareware type marketing in 1982.  The
      following year, Bob Wallace author of PC-Write, and Marshall
      Magee, author of AutoMenu, released their popular programs into
      the market.  The success of these programs ended much of the early
      skepticism about Shareware.  Due to the death of Andrew
      Fluegelman, PC-Talk is no longer around, but all the other
      programs are still supported to this day.  There are many examples
      of enormous success in the Shareware market.  Scott Miller started
      out as one guy writing game programs in the late 1980's, and he
      was one of the first to have success with offering additional
      levels as an incentive for registration.  Scott Miller is now the
      President of Apogee Software, which is the biggest player in the
      Shareware game market.  While there have been many success
      stories, it should be noted that the Shareware market is very
      tough.  There are many authors who have made little or nothing on
      their releases.

      In addition to Shareware, bulletin boards have many Public Domain
      and Freeware programs which the users are not expected to pay
      anything at all for.  These programs may include small utility
      programs, informational text files or maybe something the
      program's author would just like to get some feedback on.  Public
      Domain files have absolutely no restrictions on their use.
      Freeware authors ask for no compensation to use their programs,
      but they do retain all the copyright protection, so there are
      restrictions on how the programs can be used.

      Bulletin boards are a perfect method for the distribution of
      computer software, as a program can go around the world in a few
      days.  Software and information can be found on just about any
      topic imaginable.  There are indeed hundreds of thousands, if not
      millions, of different files available on bulletin boards
      throughout the county.


      What is a ZIP File?
      -------------------

      The majority of the files found on bulletin boards are in the
      archive format, which always gives the novice BBS user problems
      with the first few downloads.  Most people log on a board and
      download some great sounding program and cannot figure out how to
      get it to work.  This leads to more calls to the boards, reading
      bulletins or paging Sysops, in an attempt to find out how to use
      this file they cannot wait to try.  Since most bulletin boards use
      files with a .ZIP extension, users learn quickly about file
      compression.

      Why are almost all files on bulletins boards found in the
      compressed, or archive, format?  There are basically two reasons.
      One reason is to compress the file's size, thus reducing the amount
      of time it takes to transfer the file via the modem connection.
      The other reason is to group all the files necessary to operate the
      program under a single name, so the caller does not have to
      download a bunch of different files to get one program to run.

      There are many different authors who have released archive
      programs, but the .ZIP format archive is by far the most common in
      the BBS world.  Other file extensions include .ARJ, .LZH, .PAK,
      .ARC, .ICE, .ZOO, among others.  When these archive utilities are
      downloaded they come in a self-extracting format, so you do not
      have to know any complicated commands to extract the files.  Just
      type the file's name and the program will extract itself, provided
      that there is enough disk space.  Each archive utility includes
      complete documentation on the program's operation.

      The commands for each archive utility differ slightly, but it is a
      relatively simple command line for extracting files from .ZIP
      files.  The best thing to do is to place the archive utility's
      executable files, for example PKUNZIP.EXE and PKZIP.EXE, in your
      system's path.  It is unfortunate, but most DOS manuals do not give
      a very good explanation of how the path works.  By putting the
      utilities in your path, the commands will work anywhere on your
      system including diskette drives, so the utility does not have to
      be in the current directory to operate.  Your root directory is
      always on your system's path, so copying PKUNZIP.EXE to C:\ will
      work if you do not have a thorough understanding of DOS's path.
      However, it is better to place all the utilities you wish to use
      universally on your system in a directory, for example C:\BIN,
      since a cluttered root directory will slow down your system.  The
      path statement, which can be edited with any text editor, is found
      in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  In the above example, you would add
      C:\BIN to the end of the path statement, but remember to separate
      all directories on the path with a semi-colon.  For example:

                     Old path    -    PATH C:\;C:\DOS
                     New path    -    PATH C:\;C:\DOS;C:\BIN

      If a file named PBM.ZIP was downloaded, the following is an example
      of how you would extract the files you just downloaded.

                            PKUNZIP PBM C:\HOLD

      The above assumes that you wish to extract the files within PBM.ZIP
      to a directory called C:\HOLD.  PBM could be replaced with any file
      name you might download and it is not necessary to type the .ZIP
      extension.  C:\HOLD could also be replaced with the directory of
      your choice, or if you want to extract the files to the directory
      where PBM.ZIP currently resides, leave the directory off and just
      type PKUNZIP PBM.

      Under Windows, it is best to exit to DOS to unzip files.  The
      unziping function can then be preformed as described for DOS.
      Recently, a Windows version of PKZIP has been released, which
      features a menu-driven interface for unziping files.

      There are other commands and many features included with the
      popular archive utilities, but this should get those first
      downloads unziped.


      File Transfers and Protocols
      ----------------------------

      The act of receiving a file from another computer through a
      modem connection is known as downloading.  The modem actually
      makes it possible for two computers to exchange information over a
      system of wires which was originally designed for voice.  Sending
      a file to another computer is called uploading.  Even the most
      novice BBS user has most likely heard those terms.  However, it is
      never an easy question to answer when asked "how do I download?"
      This is not to insinuate that the act of downloading is that
      complex of a maneuver, but that there are so many different
      bulletin board and communications software combinations available.
      Each bulletin board software has its unique menus and series of
      commands to prepare the board for downloading.  The other side is
      that each communications software also has its own unique series of
      commands to prepare for receiving the file.

      The best thing to do may be to give a few tips to those who have
      not called around that much to bulletin boards.  Take some time to
      read over some of the documentation which came with your
      communications software, or if your program has decent on-line
      help read some of that.  The most important thing is to have your
      communications software set up to match what the bulletin board
      software is using, however, that is not as complicated as it may
      sound.  In most cases just using the default, or suggested,
      settings will be enough to get you started.  You can always fine
      tune things to your own tastes as time goes own.  One thing to
      remember is to experiment, try different things on the board, you
      cannot hurt a BBS by hitting a few keys.

      When considering your settings, always make sure your file
      transfer protocol matches what the bulletin board will be sending
      the file with.  Most boards offer a selection of file transfer
      protocols which the caller can select from, as do most
      communications programs.  Here is a brief introduction to the more
      common transfer protocols.

      ASCII - This is often seen on BBS's protocol lists, which is an
      abbreviation for American Standard Code for Information Exchange.
      There is no form of error detection available and usually only
      ASCII files can be sent in this way.  Some may say that this is
      not truly a transfer protocol, but it is still used in isolated
      cases.

      Xmodem (CRC) -  This may or may not be the most popular protocol
      in use today, as it is slowly being replaced by quicker and more
      reliable protocols.  Xmodem (CRC) sends files in blocks of 128
      characters at a time and checks for errors using a sophisticated
      Cyclic Redundancy Check.

      Xmodem (Checksum) - Information is transferred in 128 byte blocks
      with a less reliable Checksum error correction method.

      1K Xmodem - This is a variation of Xmodem (CRC) that uses blocks
      that are 1 Kilobyte (1024 bytes) in size.

      1K Xmodem/G -  This variation of Xmodem is meant for error-free
      channels such as error correcting modems or direct cable links
      between two computers.  It achieves great speed, however, it does
      not have error correction and if an error occurs the transfer is
      aborted.

      Ymodem (Batch) - This protocol is a variation on 1K Xmodem, which
      allows for multiple files to be sent per transfer.  While
      transferring files it uses the 1024 byte block size and the CRC
      error correction method.

      Ymodem/G (Batch) - This protocol is a variation on Ymodem which
      achieves very high transfer rates by sending 1024 blocks without
      waiting for acknowledgment.  There is no error correction and if
      an error occurs the transfer is aborted.

      Zmodem (Batch) - This advanced protocol is very fast, incredibly
      reliable and offers many features.  Zmodem can transfer files in a
      batch and can detect and recover from errors quickly.  The Zmodem
      Recovery feature can resume an interrupted transfer.

      HS/Link - This is a relatively new protocol.  It is a high speed,
      single and bi-directional file transfer protocol with many
      advanced features.


      High Speed Transfers, Line Noise, Etc.
      --------------------------------------

      What follows is not intended to be a technical discussion on high
      speed modems, but tries to answer some commonly asked questions.
      The new user, and the expert alike, may ask why file transfers are
      slow at 14,400 baud and above.

      Line noise over common telephone wires has been a problem since
      the first modems made their connection.  For years it was said
      that 2400 bps was as fast as normal telephone lines could transmit
      data and that we would never see faster speeds due to the low
      band-width and high noise levels.  Modem technology has advanced
      over the years, but line noise is not a thing of the past.
      Unfortunately, it is still with us.  These new modems are not
      magic either.  They manage to hide the line noise, and some are
      able to filter it out, but it is still there.

      If line noise occurs during the connection process, where your
      modem and the host modem perform their hand-shaking sequence
      looking for common ground, then it is very likely that the two
      modems will agree to a slower speed to avoid having problems
      during the remainder of the call.  In fact, if line noise occurs
      during the call the modems may decide to shift down at that time
      as well.  When line noise occurs during a file transfer between
      two modems which have established an error correction session, the
      only evidence of this line noise may very well be slow file
      transfers and nothing else.  Many modems give no other indications
      this extra work is being required, and may eventually give up and
      just drop the carrier completely.

      If you find that downloading ASCII files produces excellent file
      transfers rates, but downloading Zip files reduces the rate, then
      very likely you have turned on an option known as "data
      compression." It is like trying to use PKZip to zip a Zip file.
      In its attempt to shrink the file, it actually causes the file to
      expand in size and this slows down the file transfer.

      For high speed file transfers to work you generally want to use
      some type of flow control.  If your modem or software is not set
      up correctly, it is possible that flow control problems will
      result in errors.  When data is lost due to flow control problems
      there is only one solution and that is to send the data again.
      This results in slowing down your file transfer.

      Choosing the right file transfer protocol is important and Xmoden
      is not always appropriate at high speeds.  Zmodem has the ability
      to re-send the last block of data while other protocols, such as
      Ymodem/G, have no way to request that data be resent, so the
      transfer is aborted.  Ymodem/G is one of the fastest, but Zmodem
      is more dependable.

      And if all that is not enough, it seems like certain times of the
      year introduce more line noise on the phone lines than others.
      Some causes of line noise are wet ground conditions, which
      introduces electrical changes in the phone company's lines.
      Increased traffic on the telephone lines leads to increased noise.
      Some of the worst conditions can occur on local calls, as local
      circuits seldom receive the maintenance attention given to long
      distance circuits.

      There are a few hardware options which can reduce the errors in
      high speed transfers.  The easiest is to make sure that all your
      connections are clean.  Dirty or corroded connections will
      obviously have a negative impact on your results.  Another is to
      make sure that your phone line is grounded.  This not only helps
      reduce line noise, but may save your equipment in the event the
      phone lines becomes electrically charged.  For example, it is
      possible for a lightning strike to come through the phone line.
      Some surge protectors have a built-in port to plug the phone line
      into and most electronics stores have a device, which plugs into
      an electrical outlet, to ground the phone line.  If your computer
      is a few years old, you may have to install a new serial card with
      a 16550A UART chip.  This high speed communications port is a
      requirement for 28,800 baud file transfers.  Most of the newer
      computers have these high speed UART chips installed.

      So what else can you do about line noise?  You can contact your
      local phone company.  Sometimes the phone company does find a
      correctable problem.  Using high quality software and equipment
      can hide some of the problems.  Or you could move to France where
      fiber optic telecommunications is a reality.


      All About Doors
      ---------------

      When someone calls a BBS for the first time, there is a very good
      chance they have never heard the term "door" as it relates to
      bulletin boards.  The explanation of what a door is, however, is
      really quite simple.  There are a variety of doors on the market
      which have become quite popular.

      A door is actually a way to exit the bulletin board software and
      access a program which the system operator has made available to
      the callers.  The door is not actually something built into the
      BBS, but a program which the board must use externally.  The board
      may have to shell to DOS to use the door selected, but that is not
      always the case.  A door is a little customizing done on the part
      of the Sysop.

      Game doors have been immensely popular in the on-line community.
      The variety of game doors available is huge with new ones coming
      out all the time.  The basic game door allows the player to play a
      game and post a score for other callers to try to beat.  There are
      also game doors which have an interactive feel by having players
      taking turns in a more complex game, however, turns are still
      taken one at a time.  If a BBS has more than one phone line it
      could offer game doors where callers can truly play a one-on-one
      game in real time.  As with everything else in the computer world,
      the quality of these doors has improved dramatically over the last
      few years.

      Games are not the only type of program which a bulletin board may
      use doors to access.  Mail doors are found on a large percent of
      BBSs, especially if echo-mail is offered.  One nice feature of a
      mail door is it allows users to download new messages and read
      them off-line, thus, cutting down on the time of the call itself.
      There are BBS lists, mailing lists and other utility type programs
      which have been designed to be used as a door.  Some BBS software
      programs allow the Sysop to operate almost any program as a door,
      so the possibilities are endless.


      Chatting, Paging and a Few Words
      --------------------------------

      One thing that happens on bulletin boards is the opportunity to
      "talk" with people live on-line.  There are various ways which you
      may type back and forth with another bulletin board user.  Just
      about every BBS software package on the market allows for talking
      with the Sysop which is better known as paging, or if the Sysop
      initiates the talk the Sysop Chat.  Boards with more than one
      phone line have the option of having chats with several users at
      one time.  There are many utilities and doors available to enhance
      chatting, so this more interactive aspect of bulletin boards can
      have a different feel on different boards.  Talking in a live,
      real time mode is something that is quite popular on some boards.

      Just a few final thoughts on bulletin boards.  The BBS has not
      been around very long and even today only a small percentage of
      the population knows much about this estimated one-half billion
      dollar industry.  However, bulletin boards have really grown up
      since the early days.  Back when this all started it was just a
      few programers, maybe tying together various utilities to make the
      thing workable.  The systems at the time where unstable compared
      to the software which has developed through the years.  In the
      past things like "BBS etiquette" seemed to be a really important
      topic.  If someone hung up on the board, without following the
      proper log-off procedures, it could lock up or possibly even
      damage the system.  Dropping carrier has little effect on most
      bulletin boards today, but is still considered rude.  Bulletin
      boards seem to have fewer rules today than in the past.  When was
      the last time you read the old "remember, you are calling
      someone's home" rule?  It has been estimated that there are almost
      70,000 bulletin boards nationwide, so the competition for callers
      is intense.  Certainly every board needs some very explicit rules
      which must be followed, for example, no posting of pirated
      software.  I am not advocating that users abuse a system, more
      that I think the changes can only help the BBS world become more
      accessible to more people.


      The BBS Glossary
      ----------------

      Access - To use a BBS, as in accessing, or the amount you can use
      it, as in access level.

      ANSI - While actually an acronym for the American National
      Standards Institute, it refers to the widely used graphics on
      BBSs.

      Archive - A file which has been compressed, or at least stored,
      under a specific name.  This allows for faster transfer times and
      the grouping of related files.  Originally meant for files with an
      .ARC extension.

      ASCII - An acronym for American Standard Code for Information
      Interchange which is the most common format for text files.

      Automatic Redial - Automatic redialing by a modem when it receives
      a busy signal.  Many communications programs have this feature.

      Batch - A group of files which are either downloaded or uploaded,
      commonly called a Batch File Transfer.

      Baud Rate - The speed of the modem connection, the higher the rate
      the faster data travels.

      Bulletin - Text which the Sysop has made available to users.
      Bulletins may be informational or educational, give the high game
      scores, or whatever the Sysop deems appropriate.

      Bulletin Board System (BBS) - A computer hooked up to a modem so
      that other people can call and access information, files or games.

      Bits Per Second (BPS) - The rate data is transmitted through a
      modem connection.  Increases with the baud rate.

      Caller - Someone who accesses a bulletin board from a remote
      location.

      Capture - Saving text from BBS display to a file on the remote
      computer normally in ASCII format.  A built-in feature of most
      communications programs.

      Chat - The ability to communicate with users on other lines (or
      nodes).  Callers can chat back and forth in a live conversation.

      Common Carrier - A regulated organization, such as the telephone
      company, that provides telecommunications services for public use.

      advanced features and many are quite easy to set-up.

      COM Port - This serial port is where the modem is plugged into
      personal computers.  However, data communications is not the only
      use for these ports, as many times a mouse may use a COM port.
      These ports are commonly referred to COM1, COM2, etc.

      software.  Many times the preset configuration works fine,
      especially for new users.

      Door - A program with has been added onto the BBS, but is not part
      of the BBS software itself.  Sysops customize their board by
      adding game or utility type doors.

      E-Mail - Electronic mail, which is sent on computers in the form
      of messages.

      Emoticon - Emoticon is short for emotional icon and are sometimes
      called smileys, which are typically found within e-mail to convey
      an emotion.  For example, the most common emoticon is the smiling
      happy face, :), which means the comment should be taken tongue-in-
      cheek.

      Line Noise - Static which can occur during a modem connection due
      to the fact that the telephone system was originally designed for
      voice.

      Local - Use of the BBS at its physical location.  Typically, the
      Sysop accessing the BBS software directly.

      Log-on - Calling a BBS, and going through the most common
      procedure of giving name and password.

      Lurking - Someone who reads messages without participating.
      Typically, there are more users lurking in the background, then
      users entering messages.

      Main Board - The primary conference on a BBS, and where the
      callers normally are when they first log-on.  Most general
      messages, files and doors should be found here.

      Message - Something left by a BBS user for others to read.  A
      message could be left for a single user, or for all users to read.

      the location of those messages.  Separate conferences typically
      have their own message base.

      Modem - Device which allows computers to talk to each other over a
      system which was originally designed for voice communications.

      Network - Different BBSs exchanging messages to increase the
      activity and diversity of the message base.  The echo mail network
      allows a user to leave a message on one BBS which can be read on a
      BBS at a different location.  On some of the large networks a
      message can be read literally around the world.

      NetMail - Electronic messages, which go out over a BBS network,
      which are addressed to, and may be read by, only one person.

      page if available.

      Private - Indicates a conference or message is not meant for all
      callers, and may refer to some BBSs which have restricted access.

      Protocol - A language that modems use to communicate with each
      other during file transfers.  The same protocol must be used by
      both modems for a transfer to be successful.  There are a growing
      number of protocols to choose from.

      Public - A conference, message, or BBS which is open for any
      caller.  A public message can be read by all users.  A public
      board will have private messages and perhaps some private
      conferences, but generally access is available to all.

      Public Domain - Programs or files which are released free of
      charge with little restriction for use.

      used past the evaluation period.

      Sysop - Short for System Operator, the person who operates the
      BBS.

      Thread - The linking of messages with a specific conversation

      Transfer - The receiving or sending of a file with a BBS.

      Upload - Sending data, typically files, to a BBS through the modem
      connection.

      User - Originally meant to imply someone calling in the local
      mode, while those who access the BBS from a remote computer where
      known as callers.  Now commonly implies both callers and users.

      User Account - The record containing information for an individual
      user.  Things like user name, password, address, the number of
      uploads and downloads, and security level are typically found in
      the user account.

      User Friendly - Refers to software, or a BBS, which is easy for a
      novice to use.

      V.21 - An ITU-T standard for 300 bps modem connections
      standardized in 1981.

      V.22 - An ITU-T standard for 1200 bps modem connections
      standardized in 1982.

      V.22 bis - An ITU-T standard for 2400 bps modem connections
      standardized in 1984.

      V.32 - An ITU-T standard for 4800 and 9600 bps modem connections
      standardized in 1987.

      V.32 bis - An ITU-T standard for 14400 bps modem connections
      standardized in 1991.

      V.34 - An ITU-T standard for 28800 bps modem connections
      standardized in 1994.

      V.FC - Early standard developed by Rockwell International for
      28800 bps modem connections.

      Verification - Many BBSs have some way of verifying that the
      caller logging-on is actually who they say they are.  Caller ID,
      doors which call the user back, or calling all users by voice are
      common practices.

      Xmodem (CRC) -  At one time this was the most popular file
      transfer protocol.  Xmodem (CRC) sends files in blocks of 128
      characters at a time and checks for errors using a sophisticated
      Cyclic Redundancy Check.

      Xmodem (Checksum) - A file transfer protocol where information is
      transferred in 128 byte blocks with a less reliable Checksum error
      correction method.

      1K Xmodem - This file transfer protocol is a variation of Xmodem
      (CRC) that uses blocks that are 1 kilobyte (1024 bytes) in size.

      1K Xmodem/G -  This file transfer protocol variation of Xmodem is
      meant for error-free channels such as error correcting modems or
      direct cable links between two computers.  It achieves great
      speed, however, it does not have error correction and if an error
      occurs the transfer is aborted.

      Ymodem (Batch) - This file transfer protocol is a variation on 1K
      Xmodem, which allows for multiple files to be sent per transfer.
      While transferring files it uses the 1024 byte block size and the
      CRC error correction method.

      Ymodem/G (Batch) - This file transfer protocol is a variation on
      Ymodem which achieves very high transfer rates by sending 1024
      blocks without waiting for acknowledgment.  There is no error
      correction and if an error occurs the transfer is aborted.

      Zip - The most common form of compressed file found on BBSs.

      Zmodem (Batch) - This protocol is very popular because it is very
      fast, incredibly reliable and offers many features.  Zmodem can
      transfer files in a batch and can detect and recover from errors
      quickly.  The Zmodem Recovery feature can resume an interrupted
      transfer.


      The Emoticon Dictionary
      -----------------------

      New users may be confused by some of the symbols found in BBS
      messages, and at first may even think that maybe some line noise
      may have effected the call.  Those who are new to BBSing may see
      something like :-) in a message and wonder what it is.  Some users
      like to add symbols to messages to convey some sort of feeling and
      these symbols are known as emotional icons, or "emoticons."  The
      smiling happy face, :-), is the most commonly seen emoticon, but
      some of the others are far more complex and not so self-
      explanatory.  Some are rarely seen and many of the emoticons are
      meant to be tongue-in-cheek.  It may help to turn your head, as
      most emoticons in the Emoticon Dictionary are on their side.
