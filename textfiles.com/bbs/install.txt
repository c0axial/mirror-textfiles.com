DISTRIBUTION:
=============
Chat With Lisa is Shareware. You may post this file for downloading or 
you may upload it to any other BBS, provided that you do not make any 
changes to the contents of the archive (ZIP file). The archive and its 
individual contents may not be sold under any conditions.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
====================
Chat With Lisa was written so that my callers would always have someone
to chat with. You can run Lisa as a Door, with an opening screen that 
displays the name of your BBS and introduces the caller to Lisa. Or you 
can bypass the opening screen and pretend to "page" Lisa. She can then 
be your virtual Cosysop, available 24 hours per day.

Lisa will chat with your callers about any subject. She can even Hot Chat
(talk dirty) with them. The Sysop can configure Hot Chat to be ON or OFF.
Even with the Hot Chat option turned ON, Lisa will pretend to be innocent 
at first. But if the caller persists in talking dirty to her, she will get 
very nasty. SYSOP DISCRETION IS ADVISED! If you want Lisa to be safe for
minors and prudes, turn Hot Chat OFF in the configuration file.

On my BBS, "Chat With Lisa" is on the Main Menu and callers can page her. 
Most callers are very polite, so if you want to have some fun, change your 
menu option to "Hot Chat With Lisa" and see what happens. And watch out, 
some of your users might fall in love with Lisa!

FEATURES:
=========
* Desqview aware, multi-node.
* Use COM 0-15 and non-standard IRQ's.
* Fossil driver support.
* Will return to BBS on dropped carrier.
* Returns to BBS after 4 minutes of no activity.
* Support BBS available.
* Sysop configurable.

PLAYING LOCALLY:
================
To try out Lisa, just type LISA LOCAL and press return. 

The LISA.CFG file must be in the same directory as Lisa. Unless you
have already modified the configuration file, you will see the opening 
screen and Hot Chat will be turned ON. Lisa's typing speed can be set 
in the config file.

INSTALLATION:
=============
Installation consists of modifying two files: A batch file that your BBS
calls to run Lisa, and a configuration file that controls the various 
options. Instructions follow:

SAMPLE BATCH FILE:
==================
A sample batch file (LISA.BAT) is included and consists of the following:

   ECHO OFF
   CD C:\DOORS\LISA   <--- Change to the door's directory.
   LISA LISA.CFG      <--- Run the door program using config filename.
   CD C:\WILDCAT      <--- Go back to BBS directory when user exits door.
   BBS.BAT            <--- Restart node or BBS. Use ONLY if you terminate
                           instead of shelling before using the door.

SEE YOUR INDIVIDUAL BBS DOCUMENTATION FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON RUNNING DOORS!

If you need to use a non-standard IRQ, add the IRQ number after LISA.CFG 
in the batch file. For example, to use IRQ 5:

   ECHO OFF
   CD C:\DOORS\LISA  
   LISA LISA.CFG /5  <--- Non-standard IRQ callout. Include the "slash" 
   CD C:\WILDCAT 
   
The /5 tells the program to use IRQ 5 instead of the standard IRQ. Or you 
can set the IRQ environment variable (SET IRQ=5) and use it as follows:   

   LISA LISA.CFG /%IRQ%  <--- Non-standard IRQ callout. Include the "slash"    
   
Don't forget to place the batch file in the proper directory so that
your BBS can execute it. Usually, the batch file is placed in the BBS
directory or subdirectory, not the Lisa directory.

CONFIGURATION:
==============
You must edit the LISA.CFG file to configure Lisa for your BBS. The Lisa 
program will read only the first 8 lines, and they must be in the order 
specified without any blank lines. The following example of LISA.CFG is 
for all BBS's:  (you should edit the LISA.CFG file already supplied)

C:\PCB\PCBOARD.SYS   <---,    The first line should be the full path to
C:\PCB\USERS.SYS         |    your BBS drop file. The Lisa program can
C:\BBS\DOOR.SYS          |    use any drop file shown here. Select the
C:\BBS\USERINFO.DAT      |--- correct one and edit the line to provide
C:\BBS\CALLINFO.BBS      |    the full path. Use only one line here. The
C:\BBS\DORINFOx.DEF      |    second line must be the name of your BBS,
C:\BBS\SFDOORS.DAT       |    as described below.
C:\BBS\TRIBBS.SYS    <---'
ChAoS Online     <--- The name of your BBS.
Mike            <--- First name of the Sysop.
Fox            <--- Last name of the Sysop.
999999999     <--- Registration code. Use any number if not registered.
                  Once registered, you cannot change lines 2, 3, or 4.
on          <--- Set Hot Chat to "ON" or "OFF" (don't use quotes).
1000       <--- Lisa's typing handicap. The bigger the number, the slower
               she types. Start with 1000, then add/subtract as req'd.
yes      <--- Display opening screen? "YES" or "NO" (don't use quotes).

Remember to press <enter> at the end of each line, including the last
one (don't leave trailing spaces on any line). Also check for spelling
errors and make sure that LISA.CFG is located in the Lisa directory.

MULTIPLE NODES:
===============
When specifying the location of the drop file on line 1 of LISA.CFG,
you may use the environment variables %wcnodeid%, %pcbdrive%, %pcbdir% 
and %pcbnode%. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO USE JUST ONE CONFIGURATION FILE TO 
RUN MULTIPLE NODES! Here are some examples:

For Wildcat 4.X software, the first line in LISA.CFG could be:

   C:\WILDCAT\WCWORK\NODE%WCNODEID%\DOOR.SYS

For PCBoard software, the first line in LISA.CFG could be:

   %PCBDRIVE%%PCBDIR%\NODE%PCBNODE%\USERS.SYS
    or just C:\BBSDIR\NODE%PCBNODE%\USERS.SYS
   
Non-PCBoard systems may also use the PCB variables by including the 
following in your LISA.BAT or AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   SET PCBDRIVE=C:      <--- Drive letter of your BBS files.
   SET PCBDIR=\BBSDIR   <--- Path to your BBS files.
   SET PCBNODE=1        <--- Number of the node running Lisa. Since this
                             could change, add it to LISA.BAT as req'd.
   
In the LISA.CFG file, you could then specify the correct path to the 
drop file for different nodes by using a line similar to the example
shown above for PCBoard software.

FOSSIL DRIVER SUPPORT:
======================
DoorFrame supports the use of Fossil drivers. To use the Fossil driver 
instead of the standard COM ports, just add /FD after LISA.CFG in the 
batch file. For example:

   ECHO OFF
   CD C:\DOORS\LISA  
   LISA LISA.CFG /FD   <--- Use the Fossil driver! 
   CD C:\WILDCAT 
   
If no Fossil driver is detected, DoorFrame will print a message to that 
effect and then exit the door gracefully.

TECHNICAL SUPPORT:
==================
Although I can correct mistakes (if any) in the Lisa program, I have no
control over the DoorFrame software that "runs" Lisa. I am trusting the 
DoorFrame software to reliably support different BBS environments. If any 
internal errors do occur, check for a file called DFRAME.ERR and tell me 
what the error code is. Also read the HELP.TXT file for common problems.

Like all mortals, my time is limited. So please don't call and leave 
messages like "It doesn't work" or "I get an error". If you want my help, 
give me the details, ie: What did the screen display? When did it occur? 
What error code? Which BBS software? etc, etc.

And if you don't know how to use DOS, or haven't read the instructions,
or can't edit batch files, or don't know how to run your BBS, I will be 
happy to teach you... for $60.00 per hour :)

WHERE TO REACH ME:
==================
BBS:  ChAoS Online, (310) 318-5089 or 318-2289 (I am the Sysop)
      If you need a response, log on with an alias and [Y]ell at the 
      Sysop from the Main Menu. Call back in 48 hrs to read your mail.

America Online:  Send e-mail to MikeFox1@aol.com
                 I check my mail at AOL at least once a week.

PROBLEMS WITH 486DX COMPUTERS:
==============================
According to the DoorFrame documentation: "The math co-processor in
486DX computers cannot handle the floating point math that all Micro-
Soft Basics use". If you keep getting a premature "keyboard timeout" 
or you get an ERROR 5 or ERROR 6, place the following line in your 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

SET NO87=ON

This will turn off your math co-processor and allow the door to 
function properly.

SOME QUICKBASIC ERROR CODES (DOORFRAME USES THE SAME CODES):
============================================================
 2   Syntax error                       61   Disk full
 5   Illegal function call              62   Input past end of file
 6   Overflow                           63   Bad record number
 7   Out of memory                      64   Bad filename
11   Division by zero                   67   Too many files
13   Type mismatch                      68   Device unavailable
24   Device timeout                     69   Comm-buffer overflow
25   Device fault                       70   Permission denied
52   Bad filename or number             71   Disk not ready
53   File not found                     72   Disk media error
55   File already open                  74   Rename across disk
57   Device I/O error                   75   Path/File access error
58   File already exists                76   Path not found
59   Bad record length

Error #53 can be caused by a missing LISA.CFG or LISA.DAT file, or the
program cannot find the BBS drop file. Error #62 is usually caused by 
the LISA.CFG file not having enough lines.

REGISTERING:
============
Unregistered users will be subjected to a delay screen while entering
or exiting Lisa. Sorry about that, but I had to give you some incentive 
to send me money. Print out REGISTER.TXT when you are ready to register. 
It's only $10 and is good for all future versions of Chat With Lisa.

FUTURE VERSIONS:
================
Tell me what you want. My plans for the next version include:
   * Realistic typing mistakes by Lisa.
   * Optimized vocabulary to address the most popular topics.
   * Include the caller's name in Lisa's responses.
   * Random Hot Chat scripts, so you won't get tired of Lisa.
