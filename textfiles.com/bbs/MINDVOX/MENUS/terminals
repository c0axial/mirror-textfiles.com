                     MindVox [~^TERMINAL EMULATION~^] Settings

Setting  the  proper  terminal  emulation  can  greatly simplify  your  online
existence.   The  two most  common  selections  are  VT100  and ANSI.  In fact
these settings are SO  common, that if your terminal  program doesn't  support
them, you either  have a  REALLY  old machine, a  REALLY bad terminal program,
or are calling into MindVox via Intergalactic relay from Alpha Centuri.

Since  we  are  not  prejudiced   against  owners  of  older  hardware , messy
terminal  programs,  or  space  aliens,  if  you  are having  problems,  leave
mail  to  "support"  and we'll  set  you  up  with something  that works right
for you.

                        Your Current Setting is ~%t.
