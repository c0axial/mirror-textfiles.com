Sassy is a magazine. Sassy is THE magazine. Please do not mock teenage 
girls or magazines for said girls until you have read this magazine.

In terms of actual humans, Sassy in this here context is most probably
Margie. Margie is from Rhode Island. One of her cousins wrote Inka Dinka 
Doo. Another cousin designed Lenin's tomb. Make of that what you will.

Or maybe Sassy is Christina, who emails from here. Or it could be an 
intern, browsing. It's all very mysterious.

Sassy is cool because it is funny. And smart and idiosyncratic and 
personal. It has a distinctive voice and obnoxious opinions at a time 
when many magazines sound all alike (if Gerber mushed oats could 
write...). We try to show girls it's cool to be a girl. And don't be too 
nice and don't worry too much about being liked.

[;H[2J
                          MindVox [HELP: IRC] Reference

   The InterNet Relay  Chat (IRC)  is the  largest computerized  chat  system
   in the  world.  Since IRC is  carried by  InterNet,  the  world's  largest
   computer network, it reaches nearly every industrial  nation on the earth.
   It is not uncommon to enter a discussion spanning several continents while
   on IRC.
        
   To issue a command to IRC you must  use slash ("/") as a prefix.  Anything
   else is treated  a comment and  will be sent  to  the other users on  your
   channel.  Though there are over 100  commands available,  there are only a
   few that are necessary and important.  These are described below.
 
       /NAMES - Shows the names of each user currently logged into irc and
                which channels have been created.
 
       /NICK <nickname> - Your  nickname  starts  out  the  same  as  your
             mindvox  account name but  you may change  it to anything you
             please.  Keep in  mind that everyone on your channel  will be
             informed of the change.
 
-- more --                        /JOIN <channel> - A Channel  on IRC is  like a Channel  on your TV.
             JOIN allows  you move from  channel to  channel to  suit your
             prefence.  Channels  have names like  "#apple",  "#japan"  or
             "#hottub" depending  on what  is discussed  on them.  Join  a
             particular channel.  Please note that almost all channels are
             prefixed with a "#" (as in /JOIN #talk).
 
       /WHO <channel>  - List the  name of  everyone  on a  channel.
 
       /MSG <nickname> message - Send a private message to the the  person
            whose nickname  you specify.  No one else will be able to read
            the message.
 
   For more detailed information about  IRC's more advanced features you  may
   use the online "/HELP" Command.

On Echo, an on-line service here in NYC, there are two women-oriented 
forums. One's for topics of interest to chix, (hope that word don't 
offend nobody) and one is for women ONLY to talk about whatever. Men are 
locked out, I believe. Don't know how. Oh geez, am i inviting all kinds 
of panty-check humor from the guys who are the majority of 
of folks here?  --margie

Actually awhile ago there was discussion about making this forum a women 
only space-- it's somewhere in all the old messages if you'd care to 
bother, but seeing as only, or mostly guys seem to post on here we'd 
probably loose most of the action on this forum if that were instituted.

As soon as I clued in that the only reason for the existence of this 
forum is to flush the females out of the bushes, so they can be
mercilessly hassled and preyed upon by these skanking sexless lamers, I
gave up. Even if they did make this a women-only space, the sysadmins
could still read the messages, and they're all male, and you know how men
always stick together.

Janes,

(Arnold Schwazennger rendition of your name). You seem to be one of the 
few flushable women on this board. But c'mon, why do you act like men or 
rather us, was it skanking?, sexless lamers want to be the dominant 
species online?

It took a few minutes trying to parse that sentence. At first, I thought
you were asking why I act like men. And with Scoundrl calling me Butch in
BwF, I've had quite enough of those insults, thank you. I may be mean and
tough, but mean and tough in a nurturing, caring way. So get your skanking
lameness out of my face! erm...sorry, thought I was talking to Scoundrl
again...

Lissen, darlin', da sistas don't form no circle for no *man*. We're mad,
bad, and dangerous to know. Phear us. 
-- more (54%) --                 And, finally to answer your question, I don't have to act like men *want*
to be the dominant species online, they already dominate this space. Other
areas in thypherspaZe aren't quite so chromosomally-advantaged, but this
one is. However, for reasons entirely personal and private, I happen to
enjoy hanging with testosterone-fueled punks. It's wacky and zany, but
it's true. Da sistas aren't down with it, and they've got a point, and
sometimes I geel guilty, like I ought to go on and lop off one breast like
the rest of them, but I keep putting it off. But then I also keep putting
off getting another ear pierce, so go figure. 

Hayden, your point is well-taken, but it's coming from one who has the
luxury of asking such questions. As the great poet-philosopher said in
_Total Recall_, "c'mon, don't boolshit me."

I'd vote that this is made women only. I've been on mindvox for almost 3 
months or 4 and like it here a lot, I don't post most of the time because
I like to read the forums and use this mostly for mail to my friends. I
think it would be cool to have a place to say something that is a opinion
without having a lot of geeky guys get all upset when it wasn't to them
personally that you said star trek is boring or something like that. There
are only like 50 other forums they can argue about it on here, why not 1
where we dont need to hear it.

just my opinion if its unpopular I can live with it.

where can you check for gender status?

about getting my dick pierced
and when this board first started off a LOT
-- more (72%) --                 more people thought it was female
and if nothing else
just so i dont have to get a fake account just to post here
it wouldnt work

i really wish it could

and you knwo that anyone who does
no matter what the picture is
is probably male and go by that

oh yeah

Or y'all can just go by guesswork, and take everyone who's prolly female.
If you accidently pick up a male or two, and the manage to fool you into
thinking that they're women, even after repeated posts, I figure they're
woman enuf. Afterall, it seems like, in cspace, its the female identity
that counts, not the female genetalia. 

Or is this just another example of fucked-up male thinking?

locking the men outta this place because their genetalia is different

But newtt, we have been all our lives, only they never bother to post a
sign saying "men...", they just make it so that we can't be a part of it.
At least we would be up front about it.

But you're right, in here it would never work, because this is a
male-dominated place, and lots of girls would not want to be caught
associating with the rebellious underclass [mutter mutter], and WE CAN'T

Nope, that wouldn't work.  Any guy can open up an issue of Hustler and
scan in his favorite genetals and upload them to prove that he's a
"female".

How about mailing in a used tampon?  I guess that would be proof enough.
What do you think?

Not that women aren't discriminated against, but it's not like all of Vox
is controlled by men, as you would know, O Bandwidth Queen.

I think it has more to do with internalized feelings than with outright
exclusion; in fact I think most vox boys -- er, men -- are generally
supportive of women when they post (correct me if I'm wrong). They may not
be inviting, but they don't seem particularly willing to enforce gender
aprtheid (with a few exceptions).

All I'm trying to say is that it's not as simple as "the male voxers
control everything". I thas a lot to do with how both men and women are
-- more (84%) --                 raised to view social interaction.

Or am I just a typical male, blindly unnoticing the descrimination that
occurs in front of my very (virtual) eyes?

Bullshit!

3j, usually I believe what you type, but when I saw that this came out of
your mouth, I threw a piece of pimento loaf on my screen.  Please cite and
example. I have NEVER seen a place that expressly forbit women from
entering (except possibly for a mens room, but that rule gets broken far
more often that does the reverse (men entering the ladies room))  There
are more than a few places where they may not want to be (strip club) but
-- more (91%) --                 I rather not see the chippendales dancers. etc. etc. etc.

You want an example of a place that excludes women? Oy vey...

The White House. Bill Clinton promised us an administration that "looks
like America," and we got one. Women and minorities in the lower
positions, but the top controlled by white males. 

Apple Computer. Every now and then they put a woman in some bean-counting
position, like Comptroller, but look at the heads of all the major
divisions.

Microsoft, IBM, Compaq, Dell, etc etc. If women really are not being
excluded, where's the evidence? Why is an "all-woman" company still worthy
of cute feature stories in the Sunday paper?

To state that women aren't still kept down because men don't want to go to
Chippendales is the most arrogant form of pretense. It's that kind of
reducing the whole question to a superficial sexual level that makes men
-- more (58%) --                 feel free to whisper that an all-woman company is "a bunch of dykes" and
makes women afraid to seek out help from one another for fear of being
spoken about that way.

I'm against quotas, against special set-asides, against any type of
treatment that singles out women to receive jobs or promotions they
haven't earned. But anyone who believes that we can relax, that the fight
is over and justice has been served, is hereby invited to walk with me
down W. 57th St., so we can visit the board rooms of all the networks and
check out the pictures of the women in control of the mass media in this
country. 

I dunno, what reason do I have to think thypherspaZe will be any different?

I don't think the issue is about Vox so much as the on-line world in 
general.  This place doesn't tend to be exclusionary, nor have I ever 
been harrassed by any guy on here because I was female (although 
certainly no one ever hesitated when I said something way out of line).
In general though women have to deal with a lot of shit on bbs's and 
other computer-type things.  It's amazing to go to a 2600 meeting or 
something and be one of the only girls there (or usually _the_ only girl)
It's not that that's intimidating, but it's annoying.  It's annoying to 
be in situations like that and ask questions, 'cause you don't understand 
something and have people ignore you 'cause you're just so-and-so's 
girlfriend.  Not everybody does it, and it doesn't ahppen all the time, 
but it pisses me off.  It's stuff like that that make women say, maybe we 
should have a women-only space on vox.  Personally I don't think we 
should.  First, it's not needed here, and two, if we hide from the guys, 
things aren't gonna get any better.  (also there's that amusing gender 
test issue).  The point is, (I think there was one somewhere) whether the 
men/boys think so or not women in cyberspace aren't always made to feel 
-- more (52%) --                 comfortable.  Granted some of that is in our own heads, 'cause of various 
things in our own lives, some of it comes from just being out-numbered 
and some of it comes from hostility, objectification and all the other 
nicities some people treat us too.  Mind you, in the end it really 
doesn't matter, I deal with the on-line assholes the same way I deal with 
the rl ones-- and it's usually not very friendly.  I just wish people 
would stop assuming that women on-line either don't have a clue or aren't 
"serious about technology.  I don't understand a lot of the real
techy stuff a lot of you people or my rl friends talk about, so I ask 
questions.  That doesn't make me clueless, it makes me smart, and 
curious.  I think frequently a lot of women don't want to ask for help or 
information 'cause they are afraid of being called a lamer (or whatever 
the word is this week) or being seen as some sort of net-bimbo.
You all have to remind me to use paragraphs, this stuff is getting
difficult to read.

Exactly.  Until/unless Vox starts using Voice ID for access, I say
everything should stay open to everyone.  The last thing this place needs
is a bunch of little giggling cliques.

I'm sure they'd be more than happy to see you at Potamkin Cadillac.  (Of

And yeah, women suffer, tough shit.  Care to explain why all-female
schools are allowed to exist, while all-male schools are sexist and
Unconstitutional?  And what about the overweight?  What about the ugly? 
Those two groups suffer a hell of a lot more than women in general.  We're
all bigots, and we ALL suffer.  Life's tough, ain't it?

About all girls schools:
I went to one for 10 years (not my idea) and it sucked.  Overall a really 
bad idea, and I don't think they should exist, the rational for their 
existence though is this:
In coed schools studies have shown boys get called on more, are 
encouraged in technical disciplines more, etc.. i.e. girls don't get a 
fair shake-- this is probably true, but isolating girls isn't gonna solve 
it.  There is an association of American girls-schools that will tell you 
that girls who attend them are happier, healthier people (I wrote an 
article on these folks once).... and despite what their data says, I 
don't quite believe them (after all this is not independant researcher 
data).  Maybe girls in single-sex schools do get a better academic 
chance.  Socially though, I think it's a terrible idea.  Especially if 
you put a kid in an all-girls school since she's really young.  Talk 
about not knowing how to deal with guys normally.  Try to remember 
though, in a lot of countries almost no schools are co-ed, because they 
feel having students of both genders in a class room would cause 
-- more (64%) --                 distractions from learning (I take it they've never heard of 
homosexuality).  I think this is pretty lame too (but me ranting about 
people and their fears of teens having sex will just have to wait for 
another post on another forum).  Oh, and by the way I've never met anyone 
who considered all male school sexist, but that may jst be because most 
people I grew up with went to single sex schools.
Argh, no paragraphs again.....

there is a differnece between
singel sex high schools and lower
and single sex colleges

AND single sex military instituions
big differnece there


i dont know anyone who reallyt carteas about 
single sex high schools
except maybe the people who go to them
and i know lots of girls happy to have gone to a 
all girl school
ou just need to a haave an all guy
school near by wiht decent guys

in college its a lot different
-- more (37%) --                 i think that depnding on what you want to do with your life
female only colleges are stupid
i mean sure if youre going to become a housewife
then fine, or do something in women's studies
or do something academic
but the way society works,
you need to make connections with other people
something hard to do when the
business or whatever else field is male dominated
and all your connections are female

but of course, saying that something should work that way is really stupid too

as far as military institutions go...
well i guess if you go from the stand point
that
women shouldnt be in the military
then sure..
women should be in places like West Point
but if you want women in the military
or are allowing women in the military
you need to give them a fair shot
-- more (80%) --                 and for some reason i would bet West Point graduates
get farther in the military than those who arent

of course this could go on into my personal
stink on how women should have to be in the selective service
before they get into the military or its schools
but thats another issue

You know what I really like about all girls schools, including private and
religous ones?  Well, these girls don't get much contact with guys for
like four years in high school, and then when they go to college in their
freshman year, they wind up crazy drunk at the first party they go to and
give away their virginity to the first guy they meet.  Hey, I've seen
it... 

This kind of thing doesn't happen with girls who have gone to coed and public
schools because they are much wiser as to the ways of men, life, etc..

So what's the point of parents sending away their precious little girl
away to an all girls high school for four years, when all it does is make
them horny as hell, and they wind up screwing the first thing they see in
college?  You can't hide sex from people, and then hope they won't want to
do it, you have to be open about it, and educate and inform, instead of
trying to repress these girls and hide them away from where they might
-- more (91%) --                 actually interact with males long enough to see that we're basically scum.

it said that asking women whterther they would rather see a guy dance naked

61% said they woudl want him to do the dishes
24% would go for the naked dancing dude

does this sound right?
and what woudl the women on Vox think?

woudl you rather see a woman dance naked or see a woman hacking out

Duh! All-male schools are not unconstitutional, except in cases like West
-- more (45%) --                 Point, where women can not get an equal education somewhere else. 

OK, you're right. Lots of people suffer, and it's pretty worthless to
debate who suffers most. But that's not an excuse for complacency.

I think the point is not so much a female-only space, as a space where
women (and men, damnit) can be without seeing bullshit like the above. 
I used to think Vox as a whole was a place like that.

Debate's all fine and swell, but it's important to have a space without
debate. For example, I was over at some friends' house last night, making
dinner, when one of them suddenly flipped out and started screaming about
unconscious sexist oppression. I had to leave. Of course, she's got a
point, but the thing is to be able to have that discussion in a sensible
way, and not have it invade your entire life. 

In other words... perhaps there should be a [Gender-Debate] forum for
discussions of feminism, and whatever Kieran calls his point of view. But
there should also be a place where people refrain from that kind of debate.

That statement sounds an awful lot like the "seperate but equal" clause of
Plessy v. Fergesun (something every high schooler should learn) which is
obviously unconstitutional.  Saying "well, she can get the same education
somewhere else" just doesn't cut it.

Actually, it had nothing to do with the fact that it was a military
school, It had to do with the fact it was a public (state or federal)
college.  The precident set by the case says that male -only public
colleges can not exist.
 Female-only publkic schools are fine by this ruling, as are male-only
private schools.

I see this as a fourm to discuss women's issues (especially as they have
to deal with cyberspace) I don't see a need to lock men out of that, do
you? I took a women's studies class last quarter, and learned quite a bit
that I would never have been exposed to had it not been offered to males
(as some other schools women's studies programs are)
If the females on 'vox want a place where only they can congregate, thats
fine, if you provide a MEN'S one as welland keep something liek this to
discuss gender issues, that is oben to both.

You know, once, loooong ago, a bunch of us left CB on CIS for a place 
called People Link after Time did an article on CSex which brought an 
invasion of kids w/Commodores and 12" aparatuses. Happily a large 
inserted line: a large percentage of the emigres from CIS
percentage of them were women or at least feminine personalities. One of 
them, well, that's another story. The point is we had a fun 'community' 
while Plink lasted and it would not have been much fun if it had been all 
guys. 
I have been thinking about it and my major problem w/there being a women 
-- more (85%) --                 only forum is that it might be the only place they ever post the  way it 
is working out here. 
Less ur willing to carry the whole burden urself.

Actually there are only 2 all-girls public schools in the country from 
what I was told by the girls school assosciation.  And both of them are 
special schools for girls who are pregnant or in trouble with the law or 
something (yes, the woman assosciated these two things on the phone).

About women in the draft: did you know that if you're female and you fill 
out a draft registration card and send it in you'll get a letter back 
saying how you could get in all sorts of legal trouble for this.  They 
make you sign something saying you recognize you are not eligible for the 
draft and will not continue to try to break these laws.  Pretty fucked up 
if you ask me.

I'm not so sure this is a bad thing.  Throughout my life, the only
girls/women who have been willing to enter into any sort of relationship
with me are those who attended all-girl schools.  Maybe "normal" as it's
currently defined needs a major change.

Well, I was just pissed because a day or so ago, the same issue of USA
Today had two separate articles, one talking about how wonderful all-girl
-- more (80%) --                 colleges are, and another chronicaling this poor girl who isn't being
allowed to enter The Citadel because she's female, and how sexist that is.
 Let's make up our minds here, America.  Enough with the double-standards.

I don't know about the Well (never used it), but AOL doesn't have any
forums that are closed to certain groups based on gender or anything else.
They have sections devoted to male and female issues, yes, but anyone can
participate in them.

As for CompuServe and Delphi, the few areas that are "restricted" only
require you to email a note saying you're a member of the group you want
to join, so in reality they're just as open as anywhere else.  Besides,
the closed "custom forums" on Delphi make money or are charged based on
how many people use it and how often, so they'll take just about anyone
just to keep their rates low.

That's NOT what I meant; if there were a closed all-male forum here, it
too would be filled with a clique that would deal almost entirely in
gossip.  Don't infer things that aren't there.

Well, I'm not arguing over things like West Point, even though the reason
they were all-male is quite obvious: WOMEN AREN'T ALLOWED IN COMBAT. 
Thus, why waste money training them?

I think it is; it's the converse of the old "When the came for the Jews, I
said nothing" argument.  They "come" for people like me every single day,
and everyone says nothing.  Thus, I'm not too inclined to go out of my way
to fight whatever battle is currently in vogue amongst the PCers.

Wow, you disagree with one guy's opinion, and thus all of Vox has a major
problem?  Chill out.  And as for the above being, IYHO, "bullshit", that's
just your opinion, and I know for a fact that Patrick doesn't take kindly
to proposals of censorship in ANY form.

-- more (81%) --                 Yeah, well, perhaps this argument would have a little more weight to it if
there were ever any activity in this forum BESIDES when we're debating. 
I'm sorry your friend flipped out and ruined your dinner, but people on
Vox can just do what you did...walk away or just hit the "n" key and
forget about any post you don't like.

Perhaps it's just the fact that I'm the only one on here that's seen the
high side of 40, but the perspective you choose to view an issue like
sexism from, more often than not, depends on your own ability to sort
through history rather than the raw facts of the current social
environment. Let me state right up front that I don't believe for a moment
that women get a fair shake as things stand today. I also believe,
however, that it will not change significantly in any of our lifetimes. 

I rant and rave about this and that, and so does Kieran and almost
everyone else that hangs in here...The key difference (other than its
virtual nature) between Vox and the rest of the world is the mean IQ
around here. We are all capable of reason. I hate to break the news to
you, but it's my experience that most of the rest of the world's
population is not. Additionally, we all carry lots of baggage and tend to
not have a very deep understanding of its contents.

I grew up in very violent spaces...In fact, from 12 to 28 I lived almost
-- more (23%) --                 exclusively in violent spaces. It has altered my views of the world. It's
not something I deliberately chose to have. It's simply the hand I managed
to draw and I work everyday to live with it and make the very best of it
that I can. To deny, however, that it alters my view of the world (and for
our specific discussion, my view of women) is sheer folly. It was also for
the most part, a world where women were viewed to a large extent as
chattel. I fully realize what an ugly concept that is, but nonetheless it
is a concept I coexisted with for many years. 

The bottom line is that I have expectations for women that are
signifcantly different than for men. They change constantly, but they also
change very slowly. I have two daughters. I want them to have equal
opportunities with the men with whom they'll have to compete all their
lives. I know that will not happen. Thus, I've done my best to alter the
game. I can't change the rules overnight, but I can change the players
that I've had the chance to raise. And, I suppose by many standards
they're not very "sweet" girls. They're smart, they're educated not in the
simple secular way, but in the school of hard knocks as well. They are 
agressive, they can be absolutely ruthless and they are not merely
survivors, but competitors with the skills they need to win in any
environment life throws at them. 

-- more (49%) --                 It would be easy to say, "I'm tired of trying to change the world." I
think most people do get tired of it because you never live long enough to
see the results. Getting tired, however, doesn't mean you should roll over
like some whipped dog and urinate on yourself in despair. If you have the
depth of your convictions, it means you'll get back up dust yourself off
and take another swing at things. No one ever said life was all fun!

An example: I have a friend that happens to be female. A few years back I
decided that I had done my bit as the responsible father and that it was
now okay for me to begin doin' insane things on motorcycles again. My
friend took an interest and she also bought a bike. Now these were very
fast bikes...and we regularly rode them at speeds hovering around 115 to
130 miles an hour. (We just happen to live in a place where we can get
away with that sort of behavior.) She became expert at this sort of thing
and before long was regularly waxing the teenaged "squids" that would
accompany us on these little cafe racing sessions...And, then something
happened...I bought a couple of 2-stroke dirtbikes (off-road motorcycles)
and encouraged my friend to learn to ride them. One afternoon we took them
out and as we were riding along I managed to take her line in an attempt
to get to a  canal bank before she did. We had a fairly spectacular crash.
The next thing I knew she was lying on the ground with the bike on top of
her and I was sitting on mine grateful that the engine had not died. It
-- more (77%) --                 just never occurred to me that she might have been injured or in shock,
both of which turned out to be the case. This was a person that I had
become convinced had learned to live in the "violent spaces" and could
cope with this sort of thing...I was wrong. And, not in the result of the
wreck itself, but in how it ultimately affected her view of the activity
itself.....NOW, BEFORE YOU START YELLING AT ME.....I don't believe this
had anything to do with gender, but with personal history. This person did
not really understand the possible outcomes involved with hanging in the
violent spaces until that very moment...Then, it arrived with startling
clarity. 

Now, I do  believe, for better or worse, that more men are raised with the
skills and the edges required to survive in the truly hostile environments
than are women. That can be changed. But, be very careful...You may just
get what you ask for. If want to hold the gun, then be prepared (And, I do
mean this figuratively.) to stare down the muzzle when it's someone else's
turn at the trigger..."Most" people will pull it and never even blink!

Dude, maybe you just need to invest in a copy of "how to pick up girls"
its around .50 at any good used book store and whatever you look like, it

The Well has a closed Women's forum, it made people get angry so they
added a closed men's forum too. Then again the Well has a lot of truly
stupid conferences like granola and 15 overlapping nearly-identical
grateful dead forums.

of course he ma ahve kept asking 9 women adn then headed down to sunset

sounds stupid?

That's the real rub Newt...Who really knows what is good and what is bad?
At best they're usually judgment calls...At worst they can be completely
undecipherable...IMHO, the important thing is that you do your very best
to discern which is which and then be true to your beliefs.

Agreed. Falconer sounds like an A-1 dad.

Unfortunately, girls are still being raised by most parentals to be NICE, 
first and foremost. To be good girls. We're still the ones who are 
responsible for makin nice and building bridges btwn folks, all that 
sheet. Note, pls, how often its girls--even tho they're such a minority 
on here--who try to put an end to a long fruitless thread of 
flaminhostileragin posts. Okay, not to come off as a hairy-legged man 
hater or anything *giggle*. 

That was sarcasm. Just to head off certain people at the pass, idiotic 
post-wise.

I think girls schools are excellent. Reive, it's true they're not for 
everyone, and i definitely think it's valid to try both single sex and 
coed schools, but study after study shows that women's college grads are 
successful way out of proportion to their numbers in the population. That 
-- more (59%) --                 even when teachers are female they call on boys more, that boys talk more 
in coed classes, that girls raise their hands less (so if they're not 
called on, they'll just sit more). That more womens college grads go on 
to get doctorates in the sciences. Don't get me stahhhted, but it's all 
in the last Am Assoc of University Women study (and in the Nov. 92 ish of 
Sassy *modest, dainty, feminine blush*.

So if women's schools are sexist, are historically black colleges racist? 
Oh feh, like I wanna get into more of an "Eat My Rotting Uterine Wall"

Entirely true...Another factor, however, which should not be overlooked is
that the focus at "most" single-sex schools tends to be far more academic
in bent than their coed counterparts. Universities with sexually balanced
-- more (51%) --                 populations usually wind up with a far higher "party factor" than
single-sex institutions. The same is true to some extent for commuter
colleges. 

> So if women's schools are sexist, are historically black colleges racist? 

Based on the contacts I've had with HBCU's (Historically Black Colleges
and Universities), the answer is no. It is, however, a qualified no. To
contend that racism and sexism do not cut both ways is pure folly.
Separatism of any type promotes bias...That is just human nature. The UT
component I work at is 93 percent Hispanic in its student makeup. Is there
racism here? You bet there is! The key is in remembering that it can take
many forms. Whether it is a presumption of ignorance when dealing with a
student raised in a non-English speaking home, or some white-boy having to
honk the horn when he picks up his date because her parents will not
permit her to date an Anglo, it is still racist behavior. Can it be fixed?
Yeah, I think it can...Unfortunately, I doubt that I'll live long enough
to see it.

Nope, If I (as a white male) can apply and get into a historically black
college, and go there, then it is not racist.  However, I am being locked
out of all-female schools because I have a penis.  This is questionable.  
I'm not sure what to think about the whole situation, and Im not sure if I
believe that a all-women's high school or college isn't better for a woman
(education wise at least) but it definately varies from person to person.  
I still want to know WHY public all-female schools are ok, but all-male
public schools are unconstitutional.  Thats what bugs me.

first off i wanna commend falconer because i think that its really kool
about his daughters, BUT:

'niceness', no matter how putridly uneffective and counterproductive it
is, is still an ok attribute. it shouldn't be limited to women. i would at
any time rather be with someone who is nice than not. you can sdtill have
your swagger, your too-fucking-kool-for-you glare and be nice if your a
guy, and you can be competiitive. shurning out a bunch of hardened robots
might be the right choice if you think that the prupous of human existance
is getting ahead, and making a fast buck, but i maintain that more of it
lies in inter-human relations. 

i don't think that many people would necessarily call me the nicest or
sweetest person around and i like to think that im competitive, but i also
have spent a long time trying to learn how to get along with people, and
and i am STILL learning, and i honestly think that that is far more
important than my acedemics.
-- more (80%) --                 the world isn't fair to women, i think it sucks and i think we should do
all we should, and you are rigtht to raise your ids to be competitive. if
you want, make them forget that they are girls. just never make them frget
they are human beings.

I don't think there's a real big chance of that. As someone pointed out
early on in the life of this system, the older one is a Phoebe Cates
knock-off with real long hair, and the younger one looks a lot like Cindi
Crawford did at 18 years-old. Let's just say that I've given them a
realistic outlook on life and prepared them for the little inequities that
are sure to come their way. 

Treat'em fairly and you'll get the same in return...Mess with'em and
they'll bust your balls in a flash...nuff said!

        Date: Mon, 22 Feb 93 19:08:32 EST
        
Just a note:
I recognize the need for girls schools, I just think a lot of them aren't 
doing the jobs they should be.  I realize many women who attend them excel
in areas women are not generally encouraged to.  Many girls schools are 
also similar to the one I attended, where although they encouraged us 
academically we also learned how to curtsey to people of different social 
stations(real useful, let me tell you) and play a little piano and dance 
a little and discuss effectively current events without being too 
opinionated.  I didn't go to a finishing school, but where I went was 
pretty damn close at times.  That's where the hostility comes from.  I 
think that girls schools that are helping their students to be more 
assertive and to study fields that women are generally not encouraged too 
are great; the world I grew up in wasn't very much like that though.  I
also think when a girl makes a choice to attend a single-sex school that 
is much more positive for her than if she has grown up in one.  If I had 
gone to a real school that had also happened to be a girls school, I'd 
probably have a different attitude.  Plus most people hated junior high 
anyway, who knows maybe the fact that it was all girls had nothing to do 
-- more (75%) --                 with the fact that the place drove me nuts, but I don't think so.
Oh well, whatever, just explaining where the hostility comes from (yes, 
there are reasons for it :)

Okay, here's an example of this "women's only" space-issue that recently
came up for me and I've been thinking about...

I'm a women's studies major.  And in my senior seminar there are like, 3
men (including me) and about 17 or 18 women (including the prof.).  The
subject of the seminar is something like "women, Sex, and Power" or sex,
gender and power" or something.  Anyway, so the other week in addition to
whatever theory stuff we had, we read part od the Story of O--the class
was on romance, dominance, submission, s/m, etc.

Okay, now,w, this one total toad of a guy kept referring to various
specific scenes in the Story of O and going into fairly lurid detail while
describing them to us.  Like "So he's coming in her mouth and she's
enjoying it and thinking 'I  love him'" and so forth.  Actually more
graphic details than that.  I mean, this guy was obviously making the
entire class incredibly uncomfortable with his foamy-lipped recountings of
these pornographic scenes.  Now, I am not like incredibly prudish, nor, I
-- more (45%) --                 think, are the other class members.  But there seemed to be something in
his manner which suggested that he was perhaps *participating* in the
pornographic imagination he was discussing.  I mean, sure, to a certain
extent I'm sure that part of the reason any of us did the reading was some
sort of thrill or erotic interst.  But the fact of the matter is that this
guy was making the sort of primary students in the class incredibly
uncomfortable by presenting himself so thoroughly as like, the classic
example of the participatory male spectator.

And I got to thinking, "should there be men in this class?  Would I be
helping a feminist agenda more by simply removing myself from this
discussion (and taking this goob [wink to sassy] out with me?"

I dunno what to think about this... I can never make up my mind.  I mean,
for example, until now I have always avoided posting heere for exactly the
reason that maybe it's better not to be invasive.  On the other hand,
maybe my reading the posts here is enough of a voyeuristic intrusion that
I might as well at least be visible to the people who post here... 

Hmm sorry for all the soul searching and all, but I just wonder about this
*constantly* and I am looking for other opinions.  

-- more (90%) --                 (And hey, if you are a man reading this and feel the urge to spout off
some crap about sensitive Alan Alda-clone women's studies men, just keep
it to yourself, because that shit is tired). <--ooh, defensive, aren't we?

amy?
hmm...i don't know about the competition thing
i think that males are difinitely encouraged to ignore the sort of "care 
about others feelings" to an extent....
but i know a lot of girls that are JUST as competitive as guys (KC 
people, think Knighton?) and so what does one make of that?
is it an individual thing?
or a "product of your society and environment" thing?
what??

actually, looking at that "males are encouraged..." comment, i don't 
think that was exactly what i meant to say, or how i meant to say 
it...but i guess you can re-inerpret it or something...

and i n fact, i know a lot of girls who are a lot MORE competitive than

i wouldn't leave the class...maybe someone talk to the other guy? because 
it seems that more than just acting the typical "male" or whatever, he's 
just acting like an immature 16 year old who can't handle the unit (think

Ethan:
You know a girl probably could have said the same thing in the same way 
probably made the class just as uncomfortable; It may not be as likely a 
situation, but still.  Also that's just the way the world is, if you 
can't deal with it in class, what's the point (not directedat you, but 
the girls).  Thing is I probably would've gone off at the guy at length 
in class, and enjoyed it intensely.  BTW I read that book-- kinda 
impressed that it would actually be used in a class; that professor has 
guts.

I absolutely did not mean to imply, and this was in fact the point of the
original posting, that there are sexually based differences in attitudes
or behavior that are rooted in some biological basis. Au contraire...I
believe they are the results of social conditioning and the societal
"norms" (whatever those are at any given period in time) that are imposed
on the children of both sexes that result in the different responses and
behaviors we may manifest later in life. 

All of those conditioned responses can be overcome, but not without major
efforts in many cases. My point was that if you succeed in reversing the
conditioning you had better be damned sure you are ready to live with the
consequences of your choice. The cliche that "the grass is always greener"
may have a lot of subliminal appeal, but the realities of your neighbor's
lawn may be a serious infestation of very surly weeds!

well, the only thing about that is that we were discussing a book that was
specifically about male pleasure in the objectification of the female
body/sexuality, etc.  So that when this man appeared to be so
unselfconsciously participating in that dynamic by getting into these
descriptions, it seemed incredibly unnerving and weird--much more so, I
think, than if a woman had said the same thing.  

I think it's usually pretty important to try to contextualize people's
statements as much as possible, esp. in a discussion of some book to see
how they are relating to the text, etc.  I actually think that it would
*not* have been received the same way if a woman had said it... Then
again, your average woman wouldn't be so clueless that she would say that

> situation, but still.  Also that's just the way the world is, if you 

good point.  I spose I probably have some tendency to sort of
ivory-tower-ize some of these issues and think it's weird, for example,
for someone to think it's weird for a man to be a feminist, or whatever
(just as an example, I mean).  On the other hand, we had our fair share of
*that* world in the Story of O without this goofy guy's help.

And yeah, that teacher has guts galore.  She's the coolest (I think that
about all my teachers, though)

I don't want to sound like a fool, but I don't think a women's studies 
class should be all-women.
At my high school, there is a American Women's course.  From my lady 
friends they tell me that it is a basically a "let's gang up on the evil 
men" class.  Although there are a few man in the class (I shouldn't be 
surprised actually.)  I fear that they are put in the uncomfortable 
position of being asked "Well, YOU are a man, what do YOU think about 
it?" You know, as if they were representing the entire sex?
At school, we are supposed to be diverse.  I don't think a women's 
studies class with all women would get the whole picture.  I dunno.

The thing about Williams Colege is that people are very very *polite*.  To
the point of wussiness sometimes.  So, no, nobody said anything in class
to satanboy (he's not really *that* bad, actually...I mean, he would
*like* to be a feminist, which is a [plus).  Yeah, so I dunno.

-- more (55%) --                 Yeah, see that would be a pretty ideal situation.  But the thing is (I
don't want to drag this out too long, but hey) that it would kind of have
to be personal, in a way, since whoever would say something to him would
be diverting the discussion from whatever he thought the topic at hand was
to his personal discursive/rhetorical style, you know?  Which doesn't
necessarily excuse us other class members from being politely offended
sheep, but does explain perhaps our group reluctance to speak up...

Interesting point about "well you're a man, what do you think?" and guys 
being stuck representing their whole gender in a mostly female class.
I was in a similar situation once.  I used to be really active in the 
L/G/B on campus, and I was the only woman who was really active.  We used 
to have these weekly discussion groups and at every meeting it was, "and 
now for a woman's point of view...."  it was so annoying, especially 
because I don't think I am typical of most women of any sexual 
orientation.  And my guess is that the guys in a woman's studies class 
wouldn't give a typical male opinion, with the possible exception of that 
dude in the class reading Story of O.  Why are we so obsessed with 
viewing people in terms of their gender? (I know, I know human nature, 
but it still strikes me as weird).

Well I have mixed feelings regarding "Werll you're a man, what do you 
think?" When someone is active in the l/g/b as you were reive, and stands 
out, they can't help but be labeled as their leader or something.  Their 
spokesperson.  In an ideal society, when everyone is equally represented 
and we can have rational discussions, there shouldn't be any stereotypign 
or gender typing.  But I can't blame them.  In the women's history class 
for example, when they want a man's perspective, who else are they going 
to ask but one or two vocal males? They are forced to represent a sex.  
Just as I'm sure you were called on to do, because you seemed to be an 
active campus member.

I'm not bitching about having to be a representative of, just the way 
people handle it.  Yeah okay, if the one guy is the only person in the 
women's studies class than of course you're gonna ask him for opinions, 
but assuming he represents all guys is lame.  It should be more like 
"what do you think about this?  what do you think most guys would think 
about this? do you think gender affects how you view this?"  If you ask 
questions like that it makes the opinions more imporatant than the gender 
which in most cases is how it should be.
I know rambling runn-on's but whatever.

You know, the thing about men being called on to present a "male
perspective" is kind of you know whatever, shoddy pedagogical method and
all, and politically suspect and a pain in the butt.  The thing is, how
often does it happen?  Probably like 4 times a year nation-wide.

It's really much much more heinous etc. for say a black woman to be called
on out of a class of white men to give the "oppressed minority"
opinion/perspective.    (This was actually totally happening just the
other day in this intro. level political theory clas that I t.a.--very
dodgy.  The teacher was being cool about it and saying "Nicole, of course
you don't *have* to speak for *all* black women, by any means" etc.  But
people in the class--mostly white, mostly men--were regarding her word as
the definitive one on the so-called "black woman's perspective"--identity
politix coopted and perverted to the most nastyest of all ends, no?)

I don't want to come off as some foamy-lipped p.c.er, because I'm not, I
don't think.  But it's important to keep in mind when a man is complaining
-- more (38%) --                 about some infringement on his status as a man that chances are he's
surprised because this has never happened to him before--no one has ever
questioned or examined his authority to speak from an "objective" stance,
you know?  

As for the reason people seem to focus on gender? Well, I for one think
it's important because gender-roles have been used to legitimate or
explain away the oppression or domination of half the human race at one
time or another--for no good reason.  Sure sure it's true that inherently
(what does that word mean most of time anyway?) there's no reason to
privilege gender as a category on which to base your analysis, but you
often have to start somewhere, it seems like. 

Also, for the most part, in a women's studies class, you often spend a lot
of time deconstructing (oh oh oh the hated "d" word--but it's *true*!
[giggle!]) the logics that subtend our sex-gender system, or
at least how these structures come about and how they function.

And (I forget who asked about this), as far as other responses to The
Story of O, sure there were plenty--a whole range.  The thing is, we
weren't really just reading it and saying "Oh, I thought that bit on page
45 was extra spicy!" or extra offensive or whatever.  We were reading in
-- more (74%) --                 conjunction with this book called The Bonds of Love by Jessica Benjamin
that does a sort of psychoanalytic reading of the origins of domination
and submission in adult erotic life.  So I mean, that's why it was so
weirdly inappropriate for there to be lurid details from the book being
discussed in the class--it just really was not very relevant.  

That Jessica Benjamin is pretty cool in her own way, btw (if anybody
here's into psychonanlytiic feminism that sort of uses "the master's
[i.e. Freud's] tools" to tear down the master's haus, so to speak.  She
goes beyond that mere pleasure/pain thing to get a pretty cool reading of
f'rinstance, mother-infant dynamics).


Ay ayay!!! Too durn much b.s.!!!! AAaaaggh! I'm drowning in it!!!!

When I brought up the point about men being called on to represent men I

did it strike anyone else that why  gender is SO important ...why is it 
stressed overly much, in a forum named "Women On-line"
I'm not contraditing anyone it just strook me as amusing

It is unavoidable for woman to be united a bit by the common attitude 
taken against them at times... When I run up against it It infuriates 
me!!
I want to yell in their faces " WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE ME FOR WHATY I AM W/O 
ANY PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS???"
 
I realize that this is unrealiatic though...there will always be ideas in 
thepeople's minds.....just let them be less  less all-defining

In all honesty I have never really had a problem because i am female. I 
always find a way to work around those who would stand in my way but 
there it is always invading...the idea of whata good girl" should be 
like...innoecent, unthinking, social, concerned w/ little else than her 
-- more (51%) --                 appearance
I know this sounds exaggerated but in my HS there are those teachers left 
over from the early 60's who still have these exact ideas
luckily i have avoid them at all costs...adn my school is advanced enough 
to keep them out of the truly influential positons for fear of parental 
actions

I was lucky enough to be raised in an enviroment where it made little 
difference if I were female or male and I have never seen being female as 
never seen being female as a limitation and have proved to those w/ 
doubts that I can do all that a male can  and sometimes more
this turned into another long babbling post...(I went back and read the 
last onthis turned out to be anoth long babbling post (I went back and 
deleted the last on,...it didn't say what i wanted it to)
though there are no main points to this i hope you get the general 
feeling

there are prejudices that unite woman but there are ways to work around 
most and it's not always that bad....

Yeah, you know many groups - genetic/cultural/political - have 
professional 'spokespeople' some of whom make a decent living at it.

what is this shit? want to get eh newbies on 'your side'? 

there are NO sides here.

for god's sake, it was not a bash. it ws a comment.

does EVERYTHING here have to be uppitty and positive. can't someone just
make a relatively innocent comment without being condemned as a characer
assassin?

just because i know you in real life, dana, does not mean:

a) you have any idea who i am, or what i think, or that i even give a
flying shit about you AT ALL

b) EVERYTHING i say toyou has some deeper, hidden meaning rooted in real life.

randy, i never ever SAID i knew you.
and to be honest, from what i see of you quite often, 
i don't really know if i'd ever WANT to.
so i'm not exactly sure where you're coming from, but it seems to be 
putting a rather large questionmark in my brain...

and sides? what the hell?

and i couldn't care less about "getting the newbies.."
I was SAYING HELLO you moron!

Damn Mr Renal boy (or should I say "venal boy"?) That sounded rather hostile!

Lemme just give you some quotes from one of my fave new zines, "Hermenaut"
to cool you out:

Hermenaut of the Month:
NOVALIS (1772-1801).  Born Friedrich von Hardenberg, Novalis lived slow
and died young on the cusp of the Romantic era.  He was a slick guy, who
looked a lot like Johnny Dep, and his interests included poetry, fictions
(Hesse's 'Journey to the East' features a cameo by Novalis' character
Henry von Ofterdingen), philosophy, chemistry and mathematics.  Like Elvis
[and, I might add, Jerry Lee Lewis], when Novalis was in his early
twenties, he became obsessed with a thirteen-year-old girl: Sophie. 
Sophie died soon after, and Novalis spent the few remaining years of his
life managing a salt-mine and feverishly writing aphorisms, or
'fragments.'  He died at twenty-eight of tuberculosis and a broken heart.

-- more (54%) --                 "[Novalis'] poetic subject is entirely *intersubjective*, or
being-in-relation, fractured by alterity  and loving it.  The poetic
subject remains in a constant state of existential tension."

"The ever-dynamic poet is...truly moral.  Novalis' Symposie can 'point
forward to a better world," and that is why Novalis is our HERMENAUT OF
THE MONTH."

Hot for Nietzsche (like van Halen's "Hot for Teacher" get it?)

"I went slightly crazy...":
[cartoon thought-bubble]:
"What a bunch of squares... Mediocre, like the "Last Men" HE predicted."
[...later...]

"Ohne day I picked up Twilight of the Idols and had a frightening revelation."

Oh my God, Nietzsche is just like every boyfriend I've ever
had--brilliant, but an emotional cripple.  Heuses bizarre theories to
justify feelings he can't control or understand."

Ease up scoundrl, you're a young and intelligent person. Don't let others
step on you, but that doesn't mean you should get a larger pair of combat
boots.

okay..
first things first
im a soon to be womens studies major but i am NO
a feminist or anything of the sorty
fuck if anythign im a male chauvinist pig
but hey, who cares
kieran-shutup
ethan et all- i understand what youre saying i think
well maybe not

from what i hear a lot of guys take womens studies courses
to pick up on women (straight outa Class of '96)
-- more (42%) --                 and they are the ones likely to not say something stupid
unless they dont think it is such
or to try to make more sense, usually they will try to be
a bit more intellignet about the things they say
of course the fact that lesbians and feminists who dont want to be
icked up on or more likely to be in theses courses indicates that they are
already stupid
human sexuality is the class to pick up the babes in
you look around and see their reactions to the pornos
and go for the ones that seem really into it

but anyhow.. i think men and women need to talk about it not just women
i mena there should be spaces of privacy where ggroups of people who think
they can identify with each other can do so
with out the invasion of groups of people who cant identify but wnat to learn
about them or just want to insult them

but there also needs to be open forums where people talk and 
anbd can ask questions and you can mnever be tired of answering question
becasue learning is what its all about

or something like taht

Hi, I'm new here, and I couldn't help but notice that the forum has 
deteriorated into petty arguements for the last few days.  I dig this 
forum though, and I would like to hear other's opinions on a variety of 
topics.  I joined this bbs specifically, because I get hassled on most of 
the other bbs's in NYC.  I quit bbsing for a couple of years, because I 
got bored by the meat market mentality.  If there is a genuine interest 
in attracting more women online, then spaces must be created where women 
can get into discussions, projects, etc. without too much overt 
hostility, flirtation, etc.  The dating spaces should also exist as usual 
for those who want it.  Asking about why there should be all-female 
colleges, although all-male colleges are now illegal is like saying,
"Duh, why don't they have a MEN'S studies major?"
Nice meeting y'all.

The so-called Cybersalons (Mindvox, Echo, Well) seem to do a better job
of attracting and serving female members than free boards. I guess
social retards who think "Hey,baby, nice bits." is a kewl line can't
afford the fifteen-bucks-a-month cover charge.

Most colleges do have a men's studies major but they just call it "the
curriculum". heh
I have to say that I think both genders are entitled to private spaces.
-- more (89%) --                 The Well and Echo both have a women-only forum and a men-only forum and 
I think that's equitable.
