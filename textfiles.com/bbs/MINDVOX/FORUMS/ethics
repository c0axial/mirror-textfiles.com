 I found out the hard way that lies and distortions often are viewed as the
 absolute truth , merely because their sources were the Government, and major
 publications. It is a shame, but what people think of you is based on that
 alone. I guess it's just another vivid example that people who own the
 media get to define the "truth" .. I can only assume that it will always be
 this way until more and more of our society gets their information from a
 truly electronic media system in which we all have a chance to get the real
 facts distributed by doing so ourselves without fear of censorship, or 
 reprisal. 

 Mark is facing a very difficult time. He is basically against the wall, and
 we must all try to help him get through this. I don't care whether he is 
 guilty or not. The real fear is that he will get destroyed in the sentencing
 process. Sometimes I wonder just who really runs the government. Oh well, I
 am no longer able to speak freely. Perhaps someone who has civil rights can
 carry on this discussion...

Subject: The "Hacker's Ethic". It is dead..

Someone earlier brought up a good point regarding the state of technology
and how affordable it is, and perhaps I would like to expand on it with
the views of my own.

People like Emmanuel Goldstien and Phiber Optik and other hackers have
always stated that it is "okay to break into other peoples computers if
you don't do any damage", "it's okay to explore, and learn, etc..etc..".

The "hacker ethic" of the 1970's and 1980's, as stated above made sense then
because really powerful computers (Unix and VAX and such) were far too
expensive for the average individual to afford, so it was only "right" for
hackers to break in to learn how to use such machines. I tend to agree
with the hacker ethic on this.

But does this make any sense in 1992? I do think not.  Time changes many
things, you see. If you want to learn Unix, you can build a Unix system
for around $800.  This would basically be a 386 with 2 or 4 megabytes RAM,
a 40-80 MB hard disk, and something like Linux, Coherent or 386BSD.  And
such a system would be more powerful than the 3B2 and VAX 11/750 machines
that people hacked into in the 70's & 80's. Plus you would have super user
access and everything would be legal and no worries. 

So does it really make any sense at all to keep the hacker ethic alive
when such powerful hardware has become so cheap?  It sounds really silly
to say that it's okay to hack into some else's Unix machine today because you
want to learn how to use Unix.  It is too silly.. It sounds almost
hypocritical and people will only think that the only reason for breaking
into another machine is so you can read their private data files, and not
so you can learn shell programming or whatever.  I also think that another
reason why hacker break into machines, which is never stated publically,
is the "rush" or excitement that they feel from the danger of breaking the
law.  People I have spoken to say this rush can be quite addictive, almost
like the heroin.

Mr. Goldstien, I think it is time for you to get new slogans because
repeating the "hacker ethic" in this time of cheap access to powerful
technology makes you look quite foolish from my point of view, and from
the point of view of others.  Stop saying we are only "exploring" or
"learning" by hacking when this is not the case in the 1990's.  You can
pick up books on Unix and a copy of Coherent for $99 and accomplish
exactly the same thing without breaking any laws. 


 respectfully,

         ahmed

You going to give me the $800 to buy a unix box?  Didn't think so.
Moot point, because that isn't the issue.

To explore and learn new things is.  If you don't like that, fine.
You can complain.  But complaining isn't going to accomplish much of
anything, except maybe wasting a lot of time.

Humankind hasn't prospered by sitting on its behind, but by exploring new
things and ideas.  To stretch the limits of technology to improve our lives,
and the world.  The question is, do you want to be known as one of the
COMPLAINERS, or one of the DO-ERS?

In order to improve the technology of the world around you, you must first
understand it.  We all must.  It's our moral obligation as human beings.
The rewards of improving our lives and the lives of our fellow man/woman
are much too great to yield to persecution and blatant ignorance.

THAT is the Hacker Ethic.  Not some self-righteous, over-simplistic clap-trap.

I have always found that to be the most inappropriate and insane action by
any law agency. I was once at a meeting of the New York Personal Computer
Users Group. I believe if memory serves me, Phiber was on the panel, along
with Donald Delaney, Katie Hafner, Mike Godwin, and Emmanual Goldstien.
After all sorts of hissing and booing by some of the audience (which, mind
you was completely uncalled for on account that it began the second Phiber
 began to answer a question. I think he had said "the reason tha..." when
he was interrupted) one hacker in the crowd took a bold step and stood up
and asked Mr. Delaney (who is member of the New York State SS or something
similar):
"How do you justify the use of a shotgun in apprehending a 14 year old 95
pound kid?"
Delaney's response was:
"I know of the case of which you speak <name ommitted, he knew the hacker
who was asking the question>. In the case of <again, name of the
apprehended hacker ommitted>, the shotguns were not drawn. Only after the
convolutions of the youngster's mother were they drawn in hopes they would
calm her down. I do not need to justify what didnt happen."
Or something similar. The shotguns were NOT drawn according to Delaney,
but WERE drawn according to the busted hacker. In fact, they were drawn on
him as he was emerging from the shower, buck naked, dripping wet. I would
tend to believe the hacker. Stories of shotuns drawn and Clint Eastwood
look alike SS man are commonplace. Something is very wrong. That alone
should eliminate all doubt that this doesn't happen.

...just knowing how strange "zod's" parents were, I wouldn't be too sure
who to believe.  First of all, it's well known that his mom sort of
thought that they were the "Manson gang", "coming to kill her and her
family".  A normal assumption, no?  Secondly, judging by the frequency at
which "zod" told the truth half the time, I wouldn't be so quick to believe.
And lastly, Delaney arrested me in Jan 1991.  No guns (certainly not
shotguns), and I'm a bit bigger than "zod".  Cuffs though, there were cuffs.
And don't forget, the idea of shotguns to sustain a 14 year old naked kid
sounded just scrumptious to the media.

Also, the majority of individuals in my home in December were from the
FBI, not the SS (only a couple SS), and if you've ever been at the

Someone posted a while back that Zod committed some serious felonies while
hacking around various systems. I find that very hard to believe unless
you buy into the notion that hacking itself is a felony to be dealt with
in the same manner as theft or even violent crime. We are currently
engaged in a very real war of terminology; the authorities wish to make
hacking synonymous with crime. Judging from what a lot of you are posting,
they've made a lot of progress. I stand by what I've said in the past:
hacking is healthy ansd beneficial. It also happens to be a part of human
nature and I don't take kindly to any attempt to manipulate my values,
particularly when the threat of force is involved. When you hold up
something like credit card fraud and make it analogous to hacking, you're
falling right into their trap. Raids and indictments will make all the
headlines, but the most important and vulnerable part of this whole thing
will always be our values. I think we'd better start doing a better job of
defending them. Nobody else will.

This is an argument that will probably go on forever and no one will ever
agree on, but I maintain that had it not been for certain ethical and
wholly moral activities which were misconstrued and termed "illegal" in
the past, I would not possess much of the knowledge I do.  People who know
me, know that I take great pride in educating people on the subject of
"how things work", and I go great lengths in my private studies to make
sure the information is technically accurate when I present it.  Most often,
technical information which may be publically available is simply out of
the reach of most people, or the information simply isn't in a form they
can understand.  I enjoy explaining things, when I feel that the listener
is genuinely curious and fascinated by the subject, and does not intend on
milking information to use for illicit or destructive purposes.  I believe
that technological knowledge should be available to anyone who wants to
learn about it to use it and build upon it in a positive way, to educate
others, and to ultimately improve the world around us by moving onwards
and upwards.  In an increasingly computerized society, it becomes more and
more important to the point of becoming almost mandatory that people
should understand the technological world around them.  And certainly, if
they really STRIVE to know, as so many people do, there should be no
barriers.  I got back from the "Off the Hook" radio show with Emmanuel
Goldstein a few hours ago, and it's clearly evident from the callers that
there is a growing concensus who have a genuine curiosity to know and
understand.  Punishing people's insatiable thirst for knowledge is rather
backward, if not blatantly ridiculous.  But as long as there exists a will
to stamp out an entire subculture, a will fueled by ignorance, hate, and
obvious abuses of power by certain law enforcement types and corporate
entities, there will always be problems.
The bottom line is that more and more, people everywhere want to know how
things work.  What makes things tick.  To UNDERSTAND.  And all too often,
those who want to show the way get caught up in scandalous persecution.
It's the way things are, and we need to do something about it.
And people are trying.

Subject: HakKing is BAD

"Is it ethically ok to access computers that don't belong to you?"

That's a very un-answerable question since it will vary greatly from one 
individual to the next.  You'd have to define "ethical" first and then make
sure that everyone involved adhered to the same interpretation of the word,
and then give everyone a BIG COLORFUL BADGE that says "AUTHORIZED" and follow
it all up with a firm handshake looking deeply into their eyes and saying "I
love you" and . . . umm, where was I, oh yeah....

It is my personal belief that NO ONE has the RIGHT to access any computer,
network, device, or place; virtual or physical, that does not belong to them,
or where they have not been CLEARLY invited by the owner's or representatives
of same.

If EVIL SUPER-BAD MEGACORP has 24 Connection Machines accessible via local
dialup, and the root password is "abcdef" you still do not have the "right"
to access their machines, much less take any sort of action against them. 


But ya know, there's right and wrong, good and evil, anthracite and puce, and
then there's stupidity.  While you have the absolute right to take a new
Ferrari, leave the keys in the ignition, the window rolled down, and park it
in Harlem....   there's this wonderful thing called COMMON SENSE that
says,  "Gee ya know... that may not be a very good idea!"  Computer
security is very similar to that.  While I know a lot of people who, um...
look at things... and very few of them have any sort of harmful intentions,
much less interest in the data they gain access to...  I also trust their
judgement about as much as I  trust the average 6th grader's.  They don't
mean any harm, none-the-less it  certainly isn't helpful to me for anyone
else to have access to MY PERSONAL JUNK.

What I'm finding more and more, is people who have sensitive material on their
computer, just aren't hooking them into networks.  As an example there's my
father, and a lotta his friends.  They have contracts with the government and
various military agencies, they have a lotta stuff on their machines that
is  considered "classified" or sensitive.  Their solution to security, is
purely physical in most cases.  They don't know much about Unix, and they
don't wanna know, they don't read news, or want to get email from people,
they just don't bother to plug their personal machines into the ethernet. 
The only way to get at its contents is to physically steal the thing.

When you're running simulations or something that is extremely processor 
intensive, then obviously it has to go on other machines, or over
networks, but for the most part, what's really "sensitive" is just
information that isn't meant to be publicly accessible. 

What comprises "sensitive" material varies greatly, company X's SUPER NEW 
ULTRA-SECRET THREE WEEK PLAN, is probably of interest to nobody, except
COMPANY Y who is in competition with 'em. 

All things are relative; right now the attitude is that people find this lack
of "security" scary, so they run around in little circles, call up various law
enforcement agencies, who in turn grab their guns and kick in doors and
make a big fuss over it.

When people are scared, they tend to do silly things.  People ARE *VERY*
afraid right now, of a lot of things in general, and this is one area in
which fear can be very effectively channeled and focused on THE BAD GUY,
who in most cases is represented as some teenager who is personally
responsible for EVERYTHING wrong with their lives in general, and their
computer's in particular.

None of it bears any relation to reality, but then again, neither does life
most of the time.

i believe that there is nothing wrong with maliscious hacking...it would 
seem that if someone was caught and hadnt actually destroyed or altered 
anything, and there was no evidence of them turning a buck by doing it 
that the company would be more greatful than suspicious...after all the 
Hacker pointed out a security flaw which could be exploited by someone 
much less nice.  

 I believe that information is power, Ialso believe it should be widely 
available to anyone who wants it...power to the people.  I know of 
several friends of mine who have illegally( in the laws eyes) gained 
access to various systems and used it to learn...they were never caught 
and are now in fact writing software for some of the same places they 
hacked.

System access is not a right, but more of a privelege or ability 
(depending on how access is gained).  I think that those who can 
successfully make it into a system without permission can teach all of us 
something, after all they possess knowledge that the majority of the 
public isnt exposed to 

Hacking isnt a crime

That's a rather simple-minded attitude.  Of COURSE there's something wrong
with malicious hacking!  I don't think you're all too clear as to what
MALICIOUS means.  It means evil.  Destructive.  Detrimental.  If someone
REALLY hadn't damaged anything, they're not doing anything MALICIOUS.
(And I don't want to see any wise guys saying, "Well, just you BEING there
is damaging!"   That's nonsense.)  In fact, the words 'malicious' and
'hacking' don't even belong in the same sentence.  And there's a hell of a
lot more to hacking than defeating security.  (So you got in... THEN WHAT???)

This rather juvenile notion that by entering a system, you're somehow
helping the sysadmin is silly.  Does he WANT to be helped?  Does he even CARE?
Maybe, maybe not.  Maybe he hates you for being there.  In that case, he
certainly doesn't want your help.  Do you really expect anyone to believe
that you enter systems because you intend to HELP them?  Come on.  That's
more of an excuse than anything else.  If you're there to LEARN something
for yourself, because you have no other way to do so, that's different.
Or maybe you're just curious.  Or maybe you really are an evil, malicious,
destructive person.

If you're going to do something, you sure as hell should at least know WHY
you're doing it, and not make up some lame excuses.  Because if you do
something foolish and don't know why, some very angry people are going to
end up TELLING you why.  And you may not like their point of view,
especially if what they think aren't really your own reasons.

So make a choice:  You can do foolish things and give foolish reasons for
doing them, or you can act responsibly and explain your reasons sensibly. 
It's hard to argue with someone who has common sense on their side,
although people tend to do it anyway.

Good nite.

 I know from experience most administrators are so busy that they do not
have all the time needed to make sure their systems are secure. From what I
have seen, on mosat sites, system admin tasks are secondary, the main being
software development or network support. Some people I know are working 20
hours a day just to keep even. 

As someone pointed out earlier, the days of breaking into a system just
because you wish to learn are over. You can obtain enough experience on
Unix or networks by bringing up your own equipment at home or the office.
Hell,
I see used Suns going for $900 with hard disks and operating systems.. Or
alternately you can obtain bsd 386 and bring something up on an Intel
platform. If you are just plain flat broke, you can get accounts on public
access systems or a account on a local internet site.. Of course
I am speaking to people who already now of all this. Perhaps my words will
have some benefit on the new wave of people who are about to see Mindvox
for the first time.

 That excuse went the same way that "When they catch you, they'll hire you"
 did.. I always despised people who were naieve to believe that.

  Curiosity is great. That is what hopefully spurs us all on. BUT .. I 
 maintain that there is no need of doing anything illegal nowdays to
satisfy that  curiosity.... There are enough friendly admins on the
internet to let you have a guest account. Then, with their knowledge and
cooperation, sure go ahead, try to locate security problems. You get the
same rush as always, just that it's legal then.. They you have helped
them,you have done what certain people say they are doing "helping"
,etc,etc. So, what can I say.. it just doesn't wash anymore.. I give away 
accounts on any system I run because I know I cannot locate every
flaw in my security.. I don't have the time. Then, when my friends point
something out to me I am usually damned glad.

 Or you may not like their point of view because they are federal and don't
 even understand the difference between a good act and an evil act. It is
 so hard to find anyone in law enforcement who does understand the
difference.

That's a strange analogy, but let me take a stab at it anyway.  You see
the natives only had bows and arrows, Columbus had guns.  In the case of
hackers, if you consider yourself to be an explorer (ie: Columbus), you're
going to be dealing with natives (corporations) which are much larger than
you, and have the government on their side as well.  If Columbus had bows
and arrows and the natives had machine guns, then things would have turned
out to be different.

Now personally, I would love to go exploring and digging through the juicy
files of <insert your favorite secure installation here> but
unfortunately, it's called tresspassing, and unless I have more weapons
than they do, I am not going to run in there screaming something
Emmanuel-Goldstien-ish like "Information yearns to be free!" only to have
my head blown off by a squad of goons with machine guns.  Corporations
don't have Uzi-carrying goon squads (then again, maybe they do) but they
do have lawyers and are in bed with the government (SS,FBI,Justice Dept),
so it's basically the same thing. 

Mark, whether you like it or not, in the real world "Might makes right."
The justice system is just a puppet of the corporations.  The justice
system enforces laws passed by Congress and the President.  The Congress
is owned by special interest groups (corporations), and the President is
owned and payed for by political action committees (corporations).  If you
ask me who is running this country, I would say IBM, AT&T, GM, and Exxon,
and the rest of the Fortune 100.  Yeah, I know it sucks, but there is no
reason to put yourself up as a sacrificial lamb just to point this out.
People much more powerful and influential than you have already tried (ie:
Abbie Hoffman) and were destroyed in the process.

The lockpick would be charged with trespassing and/or breaking & entering
and/or bugulary (if he took anything) -- all appropriate charges; he/she
would also be held responsible for the amount it cost to fix/replace the
picked lock if it were damaged -- once again, appropriate in this case
and, one could say, also appropriate in computer-cracking cases.

The lockpick would, however, not be held liable for the installation of a
multiple-thousand dollar burglar alarm system if the house owner decided
that such protection be required to insure that such intrusion not happen
again. Such action would be up to the house-owner who would have to decide
what prudent action is required to protect her/his property from intrusion
or bugulary. This type of liability is, however, charged by the
government against alleged or convicted computer intruders -- see the
$230,000 restitution responsibility contained in the sentencing of Riggs,
Darden & Grant and the $360,000 damages to Southwestern Bell contained in
the indictments against Phiber, Corrupt & Outlaw. If this type of
liability stands up, the motto of corporate America could turn out to be:
"Let a hacker intrude and fix your security holes." -- why bother
tightening security? Catch the first guy and make him pay for it.

Sadly, we can't ignore their points. I find those who sit back in apathy
and grouse about conditions to be far more dangerous than those who 
abuse their power. The mass of inertia of the apathetic folk is much more
difficult to overcome. They tend to grouse about conditions, gripe about
those who try to change them, and murk about in self-pity for their plight.
Attacking abuse of power is fairly easy. Mobilizing the coconut throwers
is not. Self-styled luddites rarely have any real understanding of
what Luddism was or what it entailed. Sad, ain't it?

This is sort of a tangent but gets back to the Columbus analogy.  Hackers 
are explorers entering a foreign land just as Columbus was an explorer 
entering this (then-)foreign land.  But, let's say that the Indians had 
machine guns, anti-matter rays, and localized nuclear weaponry... And 
lets again say that Columbus was a fungus (poor analogy from a hacker's 
point of view, but bear with me).  The Indians see this fungus growing a 
bit but they do nothing about it because they figure no big deal.  This 
fungus then eats all their food or eats the Indians or whatever because 
of their inaction.  What am I getting at?  I don't know...maybe if the 
Indians had inspected the fungus closer than they did, they could have 
realized it was a problem and could have done something to prevent its 
spread to the point of damage to them (in this case death).

System administrators *KNOW* that there are holes in operating systems, 
***SPECIFICALLY*** Unix, yet many of them do little to nothing to take 
care of them.  I don't know about you guys, but I got my vaccinations 
when I was too young to realize what good it was...

Most of the hackers I know are quite ethical.  Their only quest is for 
access to resources and information.  Occasionally they might cross the 
line and abuse their privledges, but for the most part they harm noone.  
When I am in the position to hire computer professionals, I am going to 
look at "hackers" first and foremost, regardless of what they have done 
in the way of hacking.  If you give someone the responsibility of 
supporting a system, they can hack all they want while doing something 
good for their company.

I think the role of today's hacker is not to test system security for the
owners good, but rather to expose those things that threaten the majority.
For example, I do not think TRW would have as easily decided to give out free
credit reports and make it easier to correct mistakes if it weren't for
hackers helping to bring attention to them through the various breakins
and articles (such as those in 2600 not to mention the "popular" media).
It may still be illegal for them to prove that people's conversations are
not safe from eavesdropping but there is a service to the public that is
done in the process. I am not encouraging today's hackers to go out and
break the law if it is in the public interest but if they are going to
hack let it be for those reasons as opposed to "helping" a system admin to
fix their security problems which they probably know about anyways but
don't have the funds and/or the time to do anything about.
By the way, how many "reporters/journalists" have broken the law to break
a big story? Most people don't seem to have a problem with it as long as
its for the public good. 
And don't misunderstand me, as some will probably do anyways, I am just
trying to encourage a debate. 
Just remember every day you wake up you now have less privacy than the
previous day. Perhaps hackers should devote more time to bringing
attention to "big brother-ish" systems which can threaten everyone, rather
than helping rich companies get richer by shoring up their security
weaknesses. Or worse yet, by trying to gain personally from their hacking
exploits (although few may actually do it, many probably try it).

	Lex, you brought up the subject of journalists breaking the law
for a story.  I don't know if you quite consider Geraldo a journalist, but
he and his staff "research" for the trash TV show on Hackers wasn't exactly
conducted ethically.  I spoke with some of his producers for about an hour on
various technical matters and details of the how and why of hacking.  And
just as I was begining to truly believe they would do a semi-acurate
piece, they started in with the tabloid stuff.  First they asked me if I
could pull Geraldo's credit rating for them so that a hacker could present
it to him on the show (shocking!).  They then asked me if I or someone I
knew could hack into the secret Deptartment of Education computer which
held a record of Jesse Jackson's unpaid student loans.  They've got great
imaginations but criminal minds.  It's unbelievable that a major TV
personality would commit a crime in the course of portraying innocent
parties as criminals.  Ah well...  The show got 16 share anyway so what
does it matter?

It's probably because I'm younger (born in the sixties) that I'm not
completely cynical that I still care about my country.

I imagined the reason we all gather here to post messages is that we have
interest in what goes on in our lives, and those things that might change
them for the better or worse should be discussed, or at least taken notice of.

The tone of this is meant to be inquisitive and forceful, but not too
insulting. Just thought I'd set that straight. (You'll know when I'm

While I think Universe is a TOTAL flake 8-), I think that there's 
something to what he has to say...

I couldn't hack my way into a Unix box much less out of one, but I think 
hacking involves an understanding of the grand scheme of things.  I try 
to do this with everything I get involved in in life, or at least to the 
point where it seems to be leading to an end.  Like with the nets, I like 
to know where all of the net resources are or at least know that I have a 
place that I can put my finger on to find out.  I like to know all of the 
little interesting utilities like whois and nslookup, etc.  At work, I 
like to know the reason I'm doing what I'm doing, what happens after I do 
it, and why.  Dealing with people, I like to know why they react one way 
to something I say or another because of a tone in my voice.  

Maybe I'm a flake too...

The whole attitude and curiosity that surrounds hacking is really the
result of an already inherent mentality, I believe. Hackers are by nature
curious people, who crave to know how things work.  The hackers that I
know (and this is admission that I am no hacker...just a wannabe) are the
kind of people that need to understand everything around them.  At the
same time, because they generally succeed in knowing how most things
around them work, they develop (sometimes well deserved) egos.  The
mindset that prevails amongst hackers is not something that develop after
they start.  However, there is a difference that is hard to put a finger
on.  There are many "UNix Wizards" and high level programmers out there 
with the same curiosity and craving for knowledge that hackers have.  Yet
many of them don't spend any time at all attempting to gain illegal access
to various machines.  Hackers tend to have a daring attitude, I think, and
their daring attitude is also a part of their ego.  I'm not busting on
hackers as egomaniacs, by the way.  LIke a  good athlete, if you can walk
the walk, then by all means talk the talk.

Out of all the hackers and crackers I know, I don't know any who don't
take their egos with them all over the place when they are around in
cyberspace, generally act like dicks. Most of the reason why they are
different from the Unix Expert who doesn't break the law, is because the
Unix Expert has a life, however small it is, in the real world. The hacker
is usually a total Melvin and his life is his identity in cyberspace.

first of all, hi tox, hi tmh.

Anyway... Maybe you guys should try to describe who you are talking about 
when you say "hackers".  From my experience in cyberspace, most everyone 
who is a sysadmin (a good one), a programmer, or whathaveyou, is a 
hazcker in some way or another.  Mostof the people who hang around in 
#hack and so on are generally school kids or people who have just 
graduated and gotten their diplomas, and don't know what to do, and don't 
have any goal in their hacking, and so one.  There should be a 
distinction made between the malevolent hacker and the benign hacker, as 
well as the deviant hacker, the social hacker, the computer freak, and 
the legit hacker.  Most of the people who I've talked to who ppear to be 
good hackers do not hang out on irc, bbses, or the nets at all.  Alot of 
people I know who don't go around bragging about things or showing off 
their egos are much better hackers than the best from #Hack.  Oh well, my 
terminal is really slowing down, so I'm going to cut this short.. but you 
guys get the idea.

Thursday night, the 29th, the Austin chapter of the EFF hosted a book
signing and speaking opportunity for Bruce Sterling on the UT Austin
campus. The room used for the event has a capacity of 135 and there was
standing room only...A very good turnout indeed! The attendees were a mixed
bag of university staff and faculty, students, attorneys, cops, and
testosterone fueled hacker wannabes. Bruces' talk was very entertaining
and even Larry Coutorie (law enforcement type) was laughing pretty hard
through most of it.

During the Q & A session, I asked Bruce if he thought MindVOX (which he
affectionately refers to as "Hacker Hell") was providing a useful platform
for all the denizens of cyberspace to air their opinions and, while hosing
down the opposition, also enlighten them as to why things often work the
way they do? He immediately laughed out loud for a few seconds and then
proceeded to give Pat Kroupa a glowing plug as the ultimate "80's style
hacker d00d." He also pointed out that, "Yes it's (VOX) providing a forum
for discussion, but that the usual amount of cannabalism among hackers is
still present." He then quickly added that he believes that to be the norm
and that it is simply (as he also so eloquently points out in Hacker
Crackdown) part of the way in which the power structure in cyberspace is
sorted out.

All in all a very good evening...I dished out $25.00 for an autographed
copy of the book, but it must be noted that all of the profits for the
evening were being donated to the EFF Austin chapter.

Bootleg put out Bootlegger in the early-mid 80's.  There was also
Countlegger, The Hacker Magazine and one or two other Apple 5.25" disk
format mags out there for a few years.  To my recollection a few of the
LOD members on here including Digital, Lex, Erikb and some others, all had
material in one or more of them, without their permission, which was one
of the things that inspired the formation of LOD Tech Journals, in the
first place (people ripping off material that was written by others and
then selling it.  Something Bootleg is famous for and apparently about to
do again with his CD-ROM).

Bootleg had a very shaky rep for a long time, he was originally some biker
dude who would be in his late 40's or early 50's by now, who was one of
the petty-criminal profiteering class.

act like 6 year olds"

next lesson: puckering up when you kiss ass!

I for one never cared that much for either LOD or MOD, whatever lod used
to be like all of them look like they call here, none of them have even
bothered to respond. 

The way you're acting only makes everything erikb ever said look that much
more like the truth. 

Whatever erikb did, I haven't seen anybody act like netw1z who has made it
past 6th grade.

I'm starting ot think that everything said about MOD in the media isn't
far from the truth, netw1z is convincing me more with every post.

Netw1z is doing what he always does in IRC, baits people and tries to get
them angry so MOD can have another elite war with somebody. Except Netw1z
is usually funny and arguing with people who claim to be top level elite
hackers, here he's being rude to people who don't make any of those
claims or don't care. Mostly I think he's trying to get Bloodaxe to say
something stupid and respond to him.

Either way if he really is netw1z then he's going to jail soon unless he's
one of the only 3 who didn't plead guilty already. That's enough to make
anyone be in a bad mood.

it really is quite silly actually..
but that doesnt change the fact.. that i av have seen more than any of

Phiber...
 
 Well he was at least as arrogant as netw1z, but at least he had a reason 
to be.  He did know his shit (and presumably still does) and furthermore, 
Mark made sense when he posted (or talked for that matter.) and he 
doesn't piss me off.
 N1twhit on the other hand is different.  I havent heard one thing out of 
his keyboard that I could believe, and every last post irritates me.  A 
.kill file would be helpful.  Seeing that I haven't met him face to face 
I cant talk about how he 'really is' but at least behind that alias, I 
deem him to be a fop.
No... netwiz, redeem yourself.  Post something believeable (and none of 
this 'I go more places everyday than you will ever go') and post it 
coherently, and Ill send you a picture of me inside a local PAC*BELL site
with my (real, not virtual) fingers on the switching system.

When Phiber speaks about anything it isn't very kind :) The funny thing is
MOD runs around making so much noise yet whenever I've exchanged any words
with Phiber in IRC his own comments were there is no MOD, MOD was a bunch
of morons except for him and Scorpion. And reading the discussions that
went on about MOD when they were first arrainged the only reason all of
them are always in trouble is because idiots who are functionally
illiterate and act like their whole education came from a comic book
(that's netw1z or should I say Corrupt-John) couldn't handle not being
pests and bothering Bloodaxe.

In a lot of ways I'm starting to see the governments point of view, even
if Phiber never did anything illegal like he always says, he set off all
these other morons who would have been mugging little old ladies or
selling crack or something instead of getting arrested for selling credit
cards and breaking into switches. Without him none of MOD would know how
to do anything, even phiber agreed with that.

Before this I used to think that there were two sides to every story and
some of what happened was Erik Bloodaxe's fault but I'm starting to see
that probably it wasn't.

Wouldn't it be funny if someone mailed all these messages Corrupt has posted
to the prosecuter? :)

John:

Is it really me you have been trying to coax out of the 
woodwork to spar with?  Could everyone truly be right
about your intentions?  I sincerely hope not.  For even in 
the deluded grey matter you call a brain, you could not want
to continue this thread.  Or could you?

All of the  nonsense surrounding your case and that of your
compadres should remain old news.  Nothing you did was overtly
spectacular, despite your self-rightous indignations.
Everything you in MOD accomplished was old hat.  All had been
done before, and all will happen again in the future.  Why continue
the risk of putting your arm out of its socket patting yourself on the
back?  It was all no big deal.

You guys are good hackers, we are good hackers.  Perhaps most of what
you and your friends have seen, and indeed, what I and my friends have
seen would be shocking to the layperson.  (Although I fully expect a
response from you to the tune of "well, we were 3l33t but U sukked!")

You all had the knowledge to further yourselves in all aspects of your
lives, yet you chose to attempt profit at the expense of others.  What
outcome could you expect?  And to continue the harassment even after
Mark, Jason & Al had all been warned of federal involvement was sheer madness.

Perhaps you see yourselves as martyrs.  You are sorely deluded.  You have
perished for no cause save that of lining your pockets and boosting your 
egos.  Such self-serving goals are not the stuff of martyrs, but of petty
individuals, desparately trying to prove that they have control over
their environment in whatever fashion possible.

I do feel sorry for one of you.  Mark.  Despite our numerous differences,
I know that Mark has no place in prison.  I really can't imagine
Mark trying to profit illegally with his knowledge.  Your own
admission of such an act shows that whatever sentencing you receive is
well deserved.

Remember what you said not too terribly long ago:

"It's not just winning that counts, but making sure that everyone else loses."

Ironic, isn't it.

Glad to see some old hands still hanging around to talk about ethics.  
Frankly, I still can't believe this is all so commercial these days (not 
dayz).  Whatever happend to "Loose lips sink ships?"  I'm appalled to see 
the term hacking associated, in any way, with a cyberpunk.  

I remember when hacking was something we did to gain access to a system 
so we could learn how things worked, or just learn about systems we 
didn't have access to otherwise.  It's the criminal intent of the 
cyberpunk that ended the era of the hacker.

I realize that this is old hat, but I'm new here and just finished the 
thread.  I'm constraining myself even as I type.  The term punk, as I 
learned it, is either an immature brat or someone who takes it up the ass 
for free.

Any hackers out there?

 You know, I have been getting the wierd feeling that the powers that be
are really desperate to regain control of the internet. With the advent of
more and more commercial network connections , and less and less
dependence on government sponsored resources, they will be hard put to keep
track of what's going on.. Perhaps with direct , upgraded intervention by
the NSA .. maybe. I don't know.. The Universities are just going to
instruct system administrators to nuke any fsp software they find online,
and or firewall most machines so that no one can get in or out.
Someday they'll license computer users, and access if current trends continue.
What a pessimistic point of view.

	This too has mirrored by experience. Universities seem anxious to
help people interested in network and computers, learn about the topics
and provide them with greater access. I have not yet encountered any
militant system operators or people who treated me poorly because I showed
interest in what they were doing. 

I don't know what this FSP is but I'm sure it can have other uses than
transferring pirated-only software, no? ;_*

I'm thinking lately that if there used to be some kind of code of conduct
that hackers followed, I don't see that right now. In the last month some
group of people who are having a war with each other over some toolkit
that they keep stealing back and forth and dumping out parts of all over
the net have destroyed something like 10 systems along the way in trying
to get at each other. After all the shit I've gone through because of how
awful PSI is I don't care that people messed up their machines and killed
parts of their system, but when they do the same thing to eff.org it makes
me wonder if some law enforcement people aren't at least half right about
what they say is going on. EFF always stood for what I thought were good
ideals, now their site has this big banner when you log in saying
authorized use only and I don't see why people would do something like
destroy an eff system.

That would be because most people don't care about the hacker ethic,
whatever that is supposed to mean right now. When war's happening it
doesn't apply anymore. PSI and its roomfull of smoking sparcs can fuck
itself anyway they suck.

Ditto. PSI can go fuck itself.  Maybe this will wake them up and they will
actually fix their service (while in the process of fixing their security) so
that it doesn't suck so badly.  The EFF too can go fuck itself, they sold
out to _THE MAN_ long ago, and have accepted funds from AT&T, who wants to
take over the Internet and put hourly charges on every fucking little
packet that crosses their backbone.  The only good thing EFF actually does
is provide their anonymous ftp site to the net so people can leech Phracks
and LOD/TJ's, but then again CPSR does the same thing, and the files are
also available in the Mindvox Archives, so EFF's anon ftp service is not
as important to the Internet as it was two years ago.

Hey, look, EFF may not be the shining knight some once thought it was, but
I, for one, would rather have them lobbying in DC rather than abandon the
field althogether in favor of the mediacorps. They're not perfect, but
they're a damn sight better than a lot of the alternatives, IMHO.

The Hacker's League
Lee Felsenstein
18 March 1992

Theory

     The Hacker's League is modeled loosely after the American 
Radio Relay League (A.R.R.L.), an organization of technological 
adventurers of the Edwardian period.  In its heyday, the radio 
amateurs moved from being nuisances to being important 
contributors to the development of radio technology.  In a field 
which demanded governmental regulation for orderly operation, the 
A.R.R.L. represented the interests of amateurs in the councils of 
government and organized ongoing educational activities through 
which newcomers to the field could learn not only the technology 
involved, but also the human interactions which connect the 
technology to the outside world.

     The most recent triumph of radio amateurs has been the 
development of packet radio, which has recently been adopted by 
Motorola as the basis for its "wireless local loop" for wireless 
telephone operation.  Thanks to the amateurs, it was developed 
and tried out in an open environment outside of commercial 
pressures which tend toward secrecy and exclusion. 

     In the area of computers and telecommunication, there are 
several parallels between today's hackers and the radio amateurs 
of 1915.  Hackers are seen by the respectable technological 
players as nuisances capable of doing great damage and generally 
without redeeming qualitites.  They were indistinguishable from 
rogue broadcasters who trampled on other signals in their urge to 
cover the longest distance.  In the corridors of power there was 
a movement toward outlawing them.  Nontechnical people did not 
know quite what to think about this problem and its suggested 
solution.

     The A.R.R.L. was more than a lobbying organization, though.  
It provided a means for the mutual education essential to the 
growth of any technology, a route of entry open to all comers, 
and a social scene to accompany the technological forum.  Through 
the A.R.R.L. green kids could encounter grizzled oldtimers who 
would be unapproachable in their positions the industry.  At 
field days and other events the cameraderie of being explorers 
overcame the barriers of class and position as well as those 
engendered by commercial competition.  Networking was possible in 
the amateur environment which forwarded the operation in the 
commercial and professional environments.

     The concept of the Hacker's League is similar but different 
as befits the different nature of the technology.  The aim is to 
provide a situation in which otherwise unqualified entrants to 
the field can engage in informal learning situations, test their 
skills as a means of exercising their craft, gain hands-on 
experience with systems which would be unobtainable otherwise, 
and participate on both sides of mentoring and tutorial 
relationships. 

     The Hacker's League would provide an outlet for the creative 
energies which are otherwise expended making life worse for 
perceived or imagined enemies through unauthorized entry to 
systems and other illegal or unethical conduct.  Such energies 
would be turned toward projects which advance the state of the 
art, and in a way which undermines the arrogance and exclusivity 
of the corporate managers which hackers find so tempting a 
target.

     To the charge that the Hacker's League would become a front 
for the interests of industry may be raised the defense that by 
exploiting industry's fear of low-level disorder it would provide 
an organizing platform for higher-level attack upon the 
technological underpinnings of the existing structure.  Consider 
the difference between outcomes had hackers in the 1970's been 
content to organize politically for access to mainframes. There 
would have been no personal computer industry, and the power 
relationships would not have undergone the radical changes 
brought about by the triumph of open architecture.  One might 
well have said then that the amateur computer activity was a 
distraction from the true task of tugging at the sleeve of power, 
yet we can all see the effects of that activity.

     The Hacker's League could be seen as a guild serving to 
restrict entry to the membership of the technical elite.  In 
fact, the League would be far more open than the current system 
of university education.  It would provide a means of testing to 
see whether one is suited to the demands of the technology 
without exacting years of commitment to learning prerequisites.  
Within the Hacker's League there would be much more mobility 
among specialties than exists in university curricula, and the 
doors would be open to underage entrants and those who come later 
in life after entrance to a university becomes difficult or 
impossible.

     Still, the human tendencies which lead toward exclusivity 
and the formation of cliques will always be with us, and we must 
bear themin mind as we proceed in conceptualizing and realizing 
the Hacker's League.  The technology in which we work tends to 
eliminate the need for centralization, and one of the important 
outcomes of the Leagues's development would be the demonstration 
of the decentralized mode of organization, as noble an 
exploration as might be contemplated, int he opinion of many.

     After all, the primary challenge is not so much in the 
hardware, or the physical form of the systems of 
intercommunication and interaction around which society develops.  
The important work is in developing the social forms of use of 
this technology which forwards the common good as well as that of 
the individual.  New ways of thinking, as Einstein said, are the 
urgently needed ingredient for the humanization and survivalof 
society.  The Hacker's League would not only provide a 
development bed for social innovations involving the use of 
information technology, but it would empower those innovations 
through the parallel development of the technology and, most 
importantly, of the human network through which the technology is 
made to come alive.

Practice

     The Hacker's League would be  membership organization open 
to nonmembers for certain functions.  It would be organized as a 
nonprofit educational and scientific organization.  Its 
publications would be freely available to all interested readers. 

     The League would hold periodic local events demonstrating 
technical achievements of members or chapters, and offering 
places for individuals outside the League to exhibit or to engage 
in low-level trade, such as swap meets.  A newcomer would most 
probably make first contact at such events, and might decide to 
attend a local chapter meeting. 

     Meetings of local chapters would be high in information 
exchange and low in structure.  Newcomers would be acknowledged 
and provided with a brief orientation so that they would not feel 
put off by displays of technical virtuosity or cliquishness.  If 
the newcomer desired further involvement, there would be a set of 
course tracks available as suggested paths for establishing, 
through achievement, one's level of skill.  These might be 
thought of as Scout Merit Badges, although the name would 
probably not be used.  

     In the early stages of involvement, the newcomer might 
interact with a designated instructor who is also working to 
establish skill in teaching and coaching.  Later, as the newcomer 
gains skill and established competence, he or she would be 
recommended for more individual instruction and consultation from 
more highly skilled mentors.  Such mentoring relationships would 
be an important feature of the League, both as a means and and 
end. 

     The League at the local level would acquire maintain 
obsolescent equipment which would be operated and imporved by the 
members through development projects proposed from the 
membership.  Telecommunication resource would also be solicited 
as donations from carriers, on the none-too-subtle suggestion 
that the availability of such resource in such a context is 
conducive to the developmentof skilled citizens instead of 
antisocial attackers.  Through this resource the League would 
maintain its larger structure, which would be a communication-
based overlay of networks and ad-hocracies.

     Through these structures conflicitng positions could be 
discussed and debated in a functioning participatory democracy.  
Informed plebiscites would be conducted both as a means of 
determining the senseof the League on issues of importsnce and as 
development projects testing the capabilities of information 
technology under various arrangements of use.  The highest 
structure of orgnization would be at the local level, and the 
administrators at wider levels might be given titles, such as 
Janitor, which tend to prevent puffery and self-glorification.  
Sapiential authority would be fostered within the League as 
opposed to positional authority. 

     The newcomer would progress from establishing his or her 
level of skill to a process of exploring the available courses of 
self-development.  It would be possible to propose a specific 
course different from the recommended courses.  The newcomer 
would then engage in projects which require the improvement in 
skill level under the supervision or review of competent skilled 
members. 

     This should be seen as professional development (where the 
word has no connotation of "earning a livelihood") and since it 
is a responsibility of all professionals to teach adn transmit 
their skills, the newcomer would along the way be expected to 
perform as an instructor and later a supervisor and mentor to future 
newcomers.  Thus, progress in self-development would not be 
simply a matter of the "neat hacks" one could accomplish, but 
would require an integration into the society first of hackers, 
then the broader society.  There is no reason why technologists 
must rely on others to represent their work to the public or the 
polity.

     One of the public service functions performed by the 
members of the Hacker's League (and this performance would be 
explicitly carried out by the members and not by the 
"organization") would be consultation on informational security 
and integrity of communications within everyday society.  Members 
of the League would provide a service of analysis of proposals, 
investigations of system misuse and pursuit of abusers which 
would rest on itsown professional foundation rather than serving 
direct commercial ends which might distort the conclusions of 
investigations.

     To use a popular metaphor, members ofthe HAcker's League 
might be compared to doctors on the Electronic Frontier, with 
their own loose medical association to keep quackery at bay and 
serving a public health function.  Or perhaps the analogy might 
be to schoolteachers who also write literature and literary 
criticism, as well as turningout works of art and organizing 
criticism of the same.  Obviously, this metaphoric space needs 
work.

     One can expect to betterone's material condition through 
participating inthe networks of relationships which would be the 
Hacker's League, if one has the skill and aptitude to improve 
one's skills.  If not, it would be no shame to cease 
participation. An important function of the League would be to 
encourage the incompetent to go elsewhere without opprobium.  
They may well turn up as administrators within industry, and it 
is in no ones' interest for there to be hostile relations based 
upon "loser" status. 

     In fact, the Hacker's League would be a way to do away with 
the "winner/loser" dichotomy.  If you try, you win to some 
degree, and younger members less secure in themselves need to 
learn this, at times to a desperate degree.  One can take on more 
thnone can handle, be allowed to fail with support from those 
more experienced, and not incur actual or emotional costs which 
would otherwise drive one away from such experimentation.  The 
Hacker's League wouldn't be working without a measurable degree 
of honestly won failure on the partofits members.

     What types of projects would be undertaken?  Perhaps the 
development of distributed operating systems suitable for 
networks of variegated intelligent devices; elegant user front-
ends and development environments for intuitive system 
configuration; pidgin speech (unnatural language) recognition 
systems; new structures of groupware; posibly neural networks at 
higher levels.  

     But these are my own conjectures, and what would actually 
transpire would almost certainly make these guesses look 
ridiculously quaint and primitive.  Let's give it a chance to 
happen.

Well, lets hear it.

Nice message Tox, had a lot of interesting points to cover and its
applicable long past its time. 

Speaking of real hackers and ethics, John Lee (Corrupt) aka: netw1z online
here a few weeks ago, was sentenced to 1 year in jail on Monday I think,
or late last week. SLAM DUNK.
