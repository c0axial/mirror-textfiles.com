OWNERSHIP / COPYRIGHT

 2. The entire contents of System are copyrighted as a collective work under the Copyright laws of the United States.  The copy, transfer, reproduction or publication of any part of System in any form is prohibited, unless expressly authorized by PAT.  Members who place data, information, or characterization of events on System, grant PAT the right to edit, copy, publish, or distribute such information as it sees fit.  Under the provisions of this grant, Member reserves his or her individual copyright on any original material posted to System.

INFORMATION CONTENT

 3. System may only be used for lawful purposes.  PAT does not allow copyrighted material to be placed on System without the owner's permission.  Transmission in any form, of any information that violates U.S. or state regulations is prohibited.  Member agrees to indemnify and hold harmless PAT from any claims resulting from Member's use of service which causes damage to Member or another party.

 4. Since PAT does not monitor or in any way exercise control over the information passing through System, complying with all U.S. federal and state laws and regulations rests solely upon the Member.  Members agrees not to engage in any form of solicitation or advertising through the use of System without express prior written permission from PAT.  In no event may Member use the facilities of System to conduct any business or activity or solicit the performance of any activity which is prohibited by U.S. federal or state law or to solicit PAT Members to become customers, subscribers or members of any other online service.

BILLING

 5. Member assumes complete responsibility for all charges incurred through the use of Member's account(s).  These charges include, but are not limited to, any registration or validation fees, hourly usage charges, excess storage charges, communications surcharges, and any other fees for the billing period during which those fees are incurred.  Accounts are non-transferable and Member agrees to be solely responsible for all charges incurred by account(s) belonging to Member.  Member is responsible for charges at the time service is used.  Accounts are billed at least monthly and payment is due upon receipt of invoice.  PAT reserves the right to suspend access to service for any account(s) billed by invoice if payment is not received within fourteen (14) days of invoice date.  Member is immediately placed in default and subject to a $25 dollar returned check charge if payment is returned to us unpaid.  PAT reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to service from Member's account(s) immediately upon rejection of any credit card charges or indication of credit problems.  If account is in default Member's deposit will be used to cover cost of charges with the remainder of deposit remitted to Member.  In the event that deposit does not cover charges incurred, Member agrees to indemnify and hold PAT harmless for all claims and expenses, including attorney and collection agency fees, related to Member's violation of this Terms and Conditions agreement.  

 6. PAT reserves the right at its sole discretion to suspend or terminate Member account(s) access to System at any time, for any reason.  In such an event Member will receive remittance of deposit within thirty (30) days, minus whatever charges have been incurred by Member prior to termination date.  Suspension or termination of service does not relieve Member from obligation to remit full payment for charges incurred.  Only a written request for termination of service given thirty (30) days in advance of termination relieves Member of the obligation to pay monthly charges for Member's account(s).
