MindVox is situated 100 feet underground in Utah.  It is invisible, dangerous, and in the mind.  It works on a principle similar to radar, but it doesn't FLY out of anything, it is stable.

To reach MindVox you will need 100 feet of rope, 3 clothespins, a roll of duct tape, and a pair of red ruby slippers (+5).  If you lack any of these necessary accouterments you can reach us at:
