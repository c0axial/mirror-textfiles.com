Basic introduction to vox,
pointers at the editorial
what it all means, how it ties together, 
what kind of place we've created.

DISCLAIMER / WARNING / BIG SPINNING FLASHING LIGHTS GO *RIGHT HERE*

MindVox is a VERY large place, within its corridors and chambers, there are countless places to visit.  Some of them bright, well-lit, shiny and majestic, and some of them spiraling far, far underground into the vast, labyrinthine landscape of endless catabombs which rarely see the light of day.  Where your journey takes you is entirely dependant upon YOU.  We cannot assure you of "safe passage" through all the hyways and byways of CyberSpace.  What we can do is provide you with some very basic warnings and suggestions.

     The foremost warning is an obvious, but oftimes overlooked one, and it's a simple matter of human nature:  NOT EVERYONE YOU MEET WILL HAVE YOUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART.  For the most part you aren't going to be encountering a lot of axe-murderers, but you will find more than a few graduate students or do()dz in high school, who have a strange sense of humor, or have not yet had the time to establish their own code of ethics, so they're busy deconstructing society in general, and running around screaming AnArKyiE!@#!@#!@# -- which is all well and good, and totally irrelevent to your existence, until one of them gives you some software which has the latest copy of The Vapid Weasel's Polymorphic-Stealth-Self-Replicating-Viral-Infection-System-&-Rust-Remover.  Then you're gonna start to care pretty fast.

     Along the same line of thought its generally A REALLY BAD IDEA to give ANYONE your password, including those people who will claim to be system operator's, or employee's of MindVox of Phantom Access.




Since its something of a requirement these days, and sumthin' I'm supposed to
do, since anybody who has ever typed telnet seems to be writing a book about it; I'm gonna pretend you don't know anything about Cyberspace and take you on a crash course of The Matrix; so after you're done reading the next few
paragraphs, you'll have perfect understanding of what it's all about.  

     Ok, you ready? 

     Cyberspace is like this REALLY BIG place, made up of lots of 0's and
1's all strung together in big twisty chains that swoosh around in this not
quite defined place where a lotta people sit at computers and type shit at each
other and pretend that they're not really doing that, instead they're all these
dis-embodied forms of consiousness going where no dude or dudette has gone
before, blazing a trail through the uncharted and dangerous highways and byways
of THE MATRIX where you can walk the bleeding edge of technology and feel the
exhiliration and limitless freedom of doing things like sending a lot of email,
going into IRC and saying "what do you look like?" or posting "WILL YOU ALL
JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP AND IGNORE THAT LOOOSER!!!!" while discussing really
important issues that effect all of humanity, in alt.newsgroups.

     If you strip away the hopes, dreams, ambitions . . . and look at what exists today, right now; what you're left with are a whole bunch of people connected to a few million computers and sending a lot of text back and forth.


ONLINE CULTURE.... 


flame wars, etc...
