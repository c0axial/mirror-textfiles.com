HUH?  WHO AM I?

When you first login MindVox will tell you who are in the opening screen, which displays something like: 

        _______________________________________________________________

                Your Identity on MindVox is:  member@phantom.com
        _______________________________________________________________

You can also type:  whoami  at the [Main Menu]: prompt and get a similar answer: 

-=]) Your full MindVox Address is:  member@mindvox.phantom.com

"member" will be replaced with whatever name you chose to login with, while "phantom.com" will ALWAYS be at the end of it, since phantom is the name of the domain that MindVox lives in, and .com refers to its designation, which is COMmercial access.  "mindvox" will sometimes be present in your mail path, and sometimes not.  This really depends on which of the several dozen programs that work with mail, has touched your message as it passed through them.  As a rule of thumb its never NECESSARY to include the mindvox part, because MindVox has something called "smart addressing" and anything thrown at "@phantom.com" from another machine, will be sorted out internally like a miniture post office, and MindVox will figure out where your mailbox lives (there are about a dozen machines in the phantom domain at this time, mindvox is the name of one of them.)
