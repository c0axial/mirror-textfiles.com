               -=/[ Welcome to the ThoughtScape of MindVox ]/=-

  Welcome to MindVox, where you can cavort in a beautiful virtual  environment
  populated  by  a  stellar  collection  of people who get thrown off of every
  other system  in  Cyberspace;  those  in  attendance  include  some  of  the
  luminaries  of Cyberpunk literature; the dregs of the art world; out of work
  movie people who will offer you glamorous jobs for no pay;  ex-hackers  from
  LOD,  KOS,  and  a  dozen  other  affiliations,  who played as major role in
  shaping the development of  Cyberspace  over  the  last  decade;  government
  people from all kinds of neat three-letter acronyms who have put quite a few
  of the afore-mentioned crowd through the processes of our  delightful  legal
  system;  lawyers  and legislators who want to discuss the deep inner meaning
  and truth behind what the hackers did, what the government does, and what it
  all really means anyway; people who take too many drugs and then write about
  it;  people who can't stand people who take drugs;  a  bunch  of  reporters,
  journalists, and media people, all gathered here to watch what all the other
  groups are doing; if all this wasn't enough there's also Elvis & Mondo  2000
  -- together again, almost, for the first time.

  Since you have arrived at this nexus point within Cyberspace, you presumably
  have at least a basic idea of what we are, and what you expect to find here.
  You may have read an article by or about one -- or some --  of  us,  seen  a
  clip,  attended  a  conference,  or just taken a spin through the electronic
  landscape to see what fate had in mind.

  MindVox was created out of our desire to bring an  innovative  and  creative
  gathering-place to the online universe. While we are a full-featured service
  provider, our main goal is one of creating and constantly evolving a  unique
  online  community,  which  combines  all  the features you'd expect from any
  multi-national commercial network or large-scale  public  access  Unix  site
  coupled  with  a diverse array of individuals and groups who have made their
  home on MindVox, weaving together the threads of countless ideas and dreams,
  into the social fabric of a thriving community.

  To put it simply: we are a PLACE, not just a collection of services  grouped
  together  with  a price list and termed "a system." There is a great deal of
  text available on us in various periodicals, both hardcopy  and  electronic,
  and  a  cross-section  of  this material is available online. People who are
  interested in obtaining further  information  are  encouraged  to  login  as
  guests  and peruse the considerable selection of material that is online and
  available for reading or download.

  Whatever has brought you here, you want to find... something. It might be as
  simple  as the latest stock quote or a piece of shareware, or it could be as
  complex and all-encompassing as trying to give your life some new  level  of
  understanding that allows you to find peace of mind.

  Chances are that for most of you, what you desire lies somewhere between the
  two  absolutes  delineated by NeW WaReZ and online therapy. Although MindVox
  is suitably equipped to supply just about  anything  you  may  desire,  it's
  primary  focal point isn't shareware, or junk that can be found on ftp sites
  and PC boards spread throughout the land.

  MindVox is a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to a wide variety of topics,
  and  contains  a  vast  collection  of  archives  that  house information on
  everything from software updates, viruses, security news, drug  information,
  legal  issues effecting Cyberspace, and electronic digests and anthologies .
  . . all the way to a constantly growing library  that  chronicles  the  very
  inceptions of Cyberspace, with timeslices of systems dating all the way back
  to 1979 -- the first bulletin boards ever to exist.

  MindVox runs on pretty complex, custom software  that  makes  everything  as
  easy  to use as possible. The system itself is in a constant state of change
  as we make improvements, implement your suggestions, fix  problems  stemming
  from  complaints,  and  generally  evolve  the  state-of-the-art  in  online
  technology.

  We're running on an expensive collection  of  hi-tech  toys,  with  a  lotta
  modems,  workstations,  hard  disks,  terminal servers and bandwidth. We are
  BeTTeR, NeWER, FLASHIER, SHinY, BrIGHT and Cheaper ThaN almost  anything  on
  earth, or in outer space for that matter.

  The closest tangible structure that  MindVox  could  be  likened  to,  is  a
  sprawling  Tavern  at  the  crossroads of the entire world. Whether you have
  jacked into Vox by dialing a  local  number  with  your  modem,  or  stacked
  together  a  web of net connections that spans the world, you have arrived -
  and while you might make use of the facilities provided, chances are  you're
  not here 'cuz you want to flip through an online multimedia encyclopedia, or
  because you're on a quest for that elusive copy of  MegaTerminal  92.7Y  NOW
  SUPPORTING NEON ANSI MODE and V.FAST!

  You're here because you want to interact with people that you won't find  on
  any  other  system  --  pioneers  in the fields of computer science, science
  fiction, music, the arts, religion, altered states, and future  realities  -
  writers,  musicians,  artists,  programmers,  designers,  directors, actors,
  entrepreneurs, business-people, politicians,  chemists,  body-builders,  and
  Elvis.

  You're bored with the cookie-cutter tract houses that litter the  electronic
  landscape with copies of copies. All featuring the same thing, with the same
  environment and the same people. Your  cruise  through  the  Datasphere  has
  brought  you  to  our  gates because it's more interesting to hang out in an
  experimental theatre, recording studio, occult bookstore, headshop, R&D  lab
  or  club,  with  people you read about; than a 7-11, with people you're sick
  and tired of.

  Technology has created one of the most unique possibilities in  the  history
  of  human interaction; Anytown USA can jack into Haight-Ashbury in the 60's,
  Soho in the 70's, any place or time that has ever been and places that never
  were and exist only by mutual wish-fulfilment...


                   MindVox is a celebration of possibilities

                     Jack In, Rock Out and Feed your Head!
