-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Why was The Official BBS FAQ written?
======================================
Every day, I'd sign-on to local BBSes to download my e-mail and review
the Usenet newsgroups. After reading alt.bbs for a few months, I
noticed the same questions being asked over and over again. One day,
I read a message asking if there was a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
for the alt.bbs newsgroups. If not, the poster asked if someone would
be willing to write one. The idea appealed to me.

I've never run a BBS of my own; however, I've signed-on a wide variety
of bulletin board services all over the United States. I've helped
sysops setup their boards plus I've done computer tech support.
Additionally, as a consultant and writer, I was particularly
attracted to the idea of assisting computer users in their enjoyment
of BBSing. From all of this combined experience, I decided to develop
the much-needed FAQ.

To begin the project, I posted a message in March of 1994 to alt.bbs
newsgroups, calling for people to contribute to the BBS FAQ. The mail
started flowing-in immediately and continued for weeks. The overall
response was great! All sorts of people were willing to offer their
time and knowledge to the long-awaited FAQ.

I created a Table of Contents based on my own knowledge and on the
questions/suggestions I saw in the newsgroups. I then gathered
information from various sources to build the comprehensive guide
that follows. The end-product is intended to aid those who use
bulletin boards as well as to assist those who run them or want to
setup BBSes of their own.

The Official BBS FAQ was built BY the people of the Net, FOR the 
people of the Net. Many thanks to all who contributed.

2.03 - SEARCHLIGHT BBS
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
by, Tom Snider-Lotz

We (my co-conspirator Nancy, and I) operate a two-line BBS from
our office in order to provide files and other information to our
customers.  We've been using Searchlight BBS (SLBBS) software
since the beginning, about 3 years ago, and have never regretted
the decision.

Our boss conceived of the idea of having an office BBS, and he
tapped Nancy and I because we were computer literate and had some
experience online (I was a sysop on GEnie at the time).  He had
some other requirements, too:  it had to be done quickly, very
cheaply, and without diverting too much of our time from our
"real work."  Though we had plenty of experience calling BBSs,
neither of us had ever had to program one, so that added one more
requirement:  it had to be friendly to newbie sysops.  And, since
most of our callers would also be new to BBSing, it had to be
user-friendly.  We set about looking for software that was easy
to get running, full-featured, easy to use, and inexpensive. 
What we chose was Searchlight.

IT'S EASY TO GET RUNNING
==========================
Setting up SLBBS is a snap.  As it comes "out of the box," it's
ready to run with Mail, Bulletins, and a message area (SLBBS
calls them "subboards") already set up.  Adding one or more File
Directories and additional Subboards is merely a matter of
filling in the blanks on the Setup menus.  If you want to limit
access to Subboards and File Directories, that's easy.  Users can
be assigned any combination of 24 "security attributes" as well
as one of 256 numerical access levels.  You can then use these
attributes as requirements for entry into Subboards and File
Directories.  You can also apply these requirements to any option
on the SLBBS menus.

The default SLBBS menus are pretty much like any other BBS I've
seen -- a couple of columns of commands, with a highlighted
letter for choosing each command (does "G" for "Goodbye" sound
familiar?).  This is easy to change if you want something
different.  For example, we changed the menus so the commands
were selected by a number instead of a letter.  If you wish,
SLBBS will lay out the menu for you -- you tell SLBBS what the
choices are and what the access levels are for each choice, and
SLBBS will figure out how to display the menu.  Users who don't
have proper access level for a menu choice won't even see that
choice.

If you want more creative menus, you can design your own menus
using a text editor -- including special effects like colors,
blinking, underlining, etc.

We haven't tried setting up RIP graphics menus, so I can't
comment too much on that.  I gather from the manual that it's
very similar:  SLBBS will do it for you, or you can customize.

IT'S FULLY-FEATURED
====================
One of the really nice features of SLBBS is its text editor.  The
e-mail system and the message boards both use a full-screen
editor that allows full-screen cursor movement, scrolling, and
the use of function keys.  The user can insert codes for colors
and other special effects, upload text, and insert text from
other files.  For users without ANSI capability, there's also a
standard line editor.

SLBBS supports all the standard file transfer protocols,
including built-in ZMODEM.  You can add external protocols as
well, such as YMODEM-Batch and HS/LINK.  SLBBS can access CD-ROM
drives as well as the hard disk.

The message and the mail system allow uploaded messages and
attached files.  Users also can download entire message threads. 
QWK mail support is built in.


Other nice features include:
============================

 *   the ability to be run from a LAN;

 *   the ability to connect with Fidonet and RIME/UTI-compatible
     networks;

 *   inter-user chat;

 *   the ability to run many DOS programs as Doors without using
     an intermediate Door program;

  *  accurate recognition of connect speeds up to 38.4 Kbps;

 *   name completion -- SLBBS will complete a user's name or file
     name automatically if you type in partial information;

 *   single menu commands that can trigger execution of long
     sequences of commands;

 *   easy setup of additional nodes (SLBBS is designed to use
     DesqView as a multi-tasker when using multiple nodes; others
     have used it successfully with OS/2 and Windows NT as well);
     and

 *   the ability to tag files for future downloading.


IT'S EASY FOR CALLERS TO USE
=============================
As we discovered, whether a system is easy for callers to use is
mostly up to the sysops.  The good news about SLBBS is that it's
so flexible, so adaptable, that we could modify it to fit our
conception of ease of use.  Want to change the colors?  No
problem.  Want to nest the menus five deep?  No problem.  Want to
arrange the menu choices in a circle?  No problem.  Want to give
users a visual map of the entire BBS, available from each menu? 
You guessed it.


IT'S INEXPENSIVE
==================
One thing that kept bothering me as we were "interviewing"
potential software was why SLBBS was so inexpensive compared to
many of the big-name BBS programs?  What did they have that SLBBS
didn't?  We still haven't figured that one out!

As I write this, SLBBS comes in four versions, priced according
to how many lines (nodes) the software will support.  For a
single line, the price is $99; one to three lines,  $179; one to
ten lines, $299; and an unlimited number of lines, $399.  

EXCELLENT PRODUCT SUPPORT
===========================
The people at Searchlight Software are very helpful.  We've never
been disappointed.  The primary source of support is the main
Searchlight BBS in Cleveland (numbers are given below).  The
program's author, Frank LaRosa, is active on the BBS, and you can
also get input from the sysops of lots of other Searchlight
systems.  If the BBS-based support isn't enough, you can talk to
real live people by telephone.

RIP GRAPHICS
===============
Everything I've described so far refers to SLBBS's standard text-
based interface.  However, in the minds of the Searchlight
Software folks, their most impressive feature is their built-in
RIP graphical interface.  RIP technology, if you aren't aware,
provides your BBS with an attractive graphical user interface
(GUI).  Every SLBBS program sold, if called by RIP-capable
communications program, can provide a full GUI interface,
including scroll bars, push buttons, and dialog boxes.  You can
also have eye-catching logon screens, mouse-able online games,
and even animation.  Many BBS software programs are jumping on
the RIP bandwagon, but (I'm told) SLBBS offers more complete
built-in support for RIP graphics than any other BBS software.

We haven't activated the RIP interface feature on our BBS,
primarily because our most of our users don't use a mouse with
their computer, and don't use a communications program that
supports RIP.  Also, my experience is that, at 2400 bps (our
maximum) and with a slow monitor, RIP graphics can be a bit slow. 
To me, the current RIP technology is sort of like the early
versions of Windows -- the concept is there, but its time hasn't
come quite yet.  (Others would disagree with me.)


CALL SEARCHLIGHT
================
The best introduction to Searchlight is first-hand experience. 
If you call the main Searchlight BBS, you can;

  *  see SLBBS in action;

  *  see RIP graphics in action (if you've got RIP-capable
     communications software);

  *  get a freeware RIP-capable communications program (RIPterm,
     from TeleGrafix);

  *  get a list of Searchlight BBSs in your geographical area;

  *  get a feel for the support available from Searchlight
     Software; and

  *  download a demo copy of Searchlight to try out on your own.

After you've seen SLBBS in action, and tried it out for yourself,
you can decide whether it's what you want.  We're very happy with
it.

- INTRODUCTION
================
Wildcat is a very powerful, secure, and friendly BBS software from
both a sysop's and user's point of view.  It is very easy to set up
and maintain, with interactive install and configuration programs. If 
security is important to you, Wildcat is the software you want. Since 
the first release in 1986, Wildcat has never been hacked due to a 
deficiency in the program code.  Although much effort has been put
into maintaining compatibility with other systems, Wildcat has many
features that set it apart from other BBS systems, such as internal
file transfer protocols, and RIP graphics support. Wildcat is 
commercial software. It is not shareware, although a test drive
version is available. You may not copy and distribute the software.
Wildcat is published by Mustang Software Inc., the makers of Qmodem,
and OffLine Xpress.
