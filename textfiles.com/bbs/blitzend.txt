The following text is transcribed from a message
which was left on Preat0rs answering machine at
502-499-8933.

Hello, this is John or Predat0r the former SysOp for
Blitzkrieg BBS. I'd like to say as of the 12th of
January, 5.00pm, 502-499-8933 will no longer be an
active line which means the system's gone.

When I get a new line and a new number I'll put it
on Pentavia, Ripco, other real popular boards like
that. I'd like to say thanks for everybody who
supported the system while it was up.

From February of 1990 to January 1993 it had 27,834
callers. The last official user to call was
Sinister Solution.

I'd like to say when the new system goes back up
it'll be bigger, better and even more underground than
it was now.

I officially retire as Predat0r and I officially
retire Blitzkrieg. So when the new system goes up,
I'll have a new handle and a new name for the board.

If you need to get in touch with me, use the post
office box, there still good and if you want my new
voice number you figure out how to get it.

Stay free and I'll see you all again real soon...

End of file.
