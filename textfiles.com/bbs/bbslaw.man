Will I get in trouble for having x-rated gifs available for 
download?
Can I be sued for libel if someone goes nuts in the flame room?
Can I deduct losses I sustain running my BBS?
If someone posts a commercial program on my BBS will the FBI 
confiscate my equipment?

Questions, questions, questions. But there isn't a place to go 
for up to date legal information, instead of rumors. Until now. 
The BBS LEGAL GUIDE is prepared by working sysops and attorneys, 
and since it's on disk, is always updated.

This program includes nuts and bolts answers to your questions 
about BBSing and the law, has totally menu driven legal forms, 
and sign up sheets, to protect the sysop from the big bad wolf! 
<grin>. This program is valuable for both large pay BBS systems 
and not for profit single line systems. Persons who will benefit 
from this program include:

BBS systems operators
Corporations/Government agencies operating BBS systems
BBS software developers, SI's and VAR's
Software houses selling BBS and BBS related software
Not for profit clubs & organizations operating BBS systems
BBS message networks

The BBS legal guide also contains all 50 states computer crime 
and BBS specific laws, annotated and explained. 

Another amazing feature-- BBS screens and bulletins that you can 
use to define the rules of your system and protect your legal 
rights as a sysop. 

Thought we were done with the features? Not yet. For corporate 
BBS's, specific forms for your personnel manual defining proper 
computer use. For large BBS systems, complete manuals for co-
sysops and employees. All of the corporate policies/operation 
manuals are designed to protect the system's proprietor.

The basic package is an important tool for the sysop. But, even 
more value is provided by monthly updates providing timely 
information, more legal data, forms and screens. These updates 
will be driven by the requests of our users. However, planned 
updates include:

the complete annotated copyright code;
all state laws regarding "obscenity" with full annotations

Now the answers-- The good news is that an investment in time 
will protect you and your system. Yes, you can deduct losses 
sustained running a BBS-- if you know the ropes. Yes, you can 
carry adult gifs. And you can have folks flame away at each other 
if they want to without trouble.  There is a way to handle 
inadvertent postings of commercial software. On the other hand 
some sysops have been caught unprepared, suffered huffing and 
puffing and had their house fall in.

This program contains full annotated text of statutes and 
regulations, nuts and bolts answers to your questions, BBS 
screens and menu driven legal forms and more. 

There are three levels of registration available for this 
program.

DELUXE REGISTRATION: 

Deluxe registration is $ 129.00. Deluxe registration provides:

1. A printed manual.

2. Disks with the latest versions of the software- and the disk 
is "branded" with your name and license number.

3. Each month updates are created. These updates contain some or 
all of the following:

a) New forms;
b) Although we can't give individual legal advice, answers to 
questions posed by our registered users;
c) New annotated legal text;
d) New BBS screens and bulletins;

and are mailed first class mail. 

Upgrades to the program and new manuals are mailed upon their 
release.  

After 12 months, to continue your subscription, an additional $ 
75 fee is required. So long as your subscription remains current 
you will receive any upgrades and updates via first class mail.

4. Support via voice (answered 24 hours daily), BBS and other on-
line services.

Thus, deluxe registrants receive a continuing update subscription 
as well as upgrades, support and manuals via mail as soon as 
delivered.

This registration fee is less than even one hour of an attorney's 
time-- an investment well worth the cost.

REGULAR REGISTRATION

Regular registration is $ 69.

Regular registration provides:

1. A printed manual.

2. Program disks of the latest version with the registered users 
name "branded" on the disk.

3. A subscription to updates and upgrades for 12 months. However, 
these updates are posted on our support BBS systems in a 
scrambled from. The user is provided with the descrambling keys 
for 12 months following their registrations. Upgrades to the 
program may be used, provided that the registered user downloads 
the updates from our support BBS.

4. Support via voice and BBS, together with many on-line 
services.

5. After 12 months, to continue to receive updates and upgrades, 
a subscription fee of $ 35 is due. Updates and upgrades must be 
downloaded.

BASIC REGISTRATION

Many sysops are on a budget. "Basic" registration requires less 
work on our part, and the registration fee is cut accordingly. 
Basic registration is $ 35. Basic registration provides:

1. An "unlock" key which removes all shareware reminders and 
brands the users name and license number on the program. However, 
you must call our support BBS to download your registration key 
file and descramble program.

2. Monthly updates which are posted on our support BBS systems in 
scrambled form. When you download your "unlock key" the 
unscramble program is also provided.

3. Support via BBS only.

4. After 12 months, a continuing subscription to updates is 
available for $ 20.00. The user must call our support BBS to 
download the necessary unscrambling information.

5. All upgrades to the program may be used so long as your 
subscription to updates is maintained, although you'll have to 
download those.

CHOOSE YOUR BUDGET, but register!

Registration is REQUIRED if you use the BBS screens or forms on 
your BBS.

Note: We have arrangements with several BBS systems for posting 
our updates/upgrades. Complete information on the access numbers 
is provided to our registered users. If your multi-line system is 
interested in being a distribution site, please contact us.

We feel that any of three levels registrations are great values. 
If a sysop can even find an attorney who understands what a BBS 
is, substantial fees would be required for even simple services. 
At $ 150 to $ 295 per hour for most legal services, our 
registration fee is a bargain, and a necessary investment for the 
security of your system.

If you are unfamiliar with the shareware concept of distribution 
of software, please read "share.txt." The developers of this 
program have well known commercial programs as well as shareware. 
Since BBS systems are one of the primary modes of distribution of 
shareware, and that's the target market of this program, we have 
chosen shareware as the distribution method for this software.
      
The document generator prepares a form which you should use to 
make your order. Credit cards, checks and money orders are 
accepted. (Credit card orders, please contact ATTENTION TO 
DETAILS BBS, at 1-909-681-6221 and you may order by credit card 
on line.)

                           SECTION ONE
                          INSTALLATION
        
Section 1-1
INSTALLATION
        
To install THE BBS LEGAL GUIDE, (we'll call it BBS LAW for short) 
First back up your installation disks by using the MS DOS command 
DISKCOPY. For more information about DISKCOPY, consult your 
computer's manual. Place the master disks that you received in a 
safe place and use your backup copies.

To use this BBS distribution version, please un-archive the 
program to its own subdirectory.

SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS
        
In order to operate this program, your computer must:
        
1) have an IBM PC compatible operation a version of M.S. DOS, 
D.R. DOS or P.C. DOS of 3.3 or higher or OS/2, PS/2; this program 
happily runs under Windows environments/Multi tasking 
environments and also runs in "MS DOS EMULATIONS" in Open Desk 
Top and other UNIX systems that can run MS DOS programs.
        
To find out which version of dos you are using, please enter:
        
                              <ver>
        
and you will receive a cheery message such as
        
                         MS-DOS VER 3.30
        
in general this program will operate on XT compatibles, '286 
compatibles (AT Class) and '386 compatible systems; 486 systems;
        
2) have a hard drive (fixed disk);
         
3) have at least 448 K Bytes of USABLE memory with the first 
640KB; many computer users have machines that are installed with 
512K, 640K or more but install many Terminate and stay           
resident (TSR or "memory resident" programs) which each use 
memory, dropping available for usable memory to less than 448 K; 
if you cannot operate this program dump out of it (the time 
honored process pressing Control, Alternate and Delete at once to 
"warm" reboot) and at a system prompt type, exactly                     

                            <chkdsk>
        
Your machine should whirl and click and then announce something 
like this:
         
655360 bytes total memory
620000 bytes free
        
if you have less that 448000 bytes of memory free, then you must 
read the manuals for your memory resident software and delete 
some of them so that you have at least 448000 free when you run 
this program. There are utilities that "manage" terminate and 
stay resident program advertised in your favorite computer 
magazine. If you would like an operating environment that manages 
memory and can make your computer stand on its head allowing 
multitasking among many other great things, check out the great 
products from Quarterdeck.(tm)

(We apologize to most BBS types who are power users and know all 
of this! However, we had to learn how to do all this once too!)

IMPORTANT CAVEAT: Many computer users employ file management 
shells like the Norton Commander(tm) or PC TOOLS (versions 6 and 
higher) to help them manage their systems. These programs consume 
memory when used. Often persons also load several Terminate and 
stay resident utilities  (T.S.R's) and a file manager. The likely 
result is that you will be often reduced to less than 300k free 
memory. This will  S.. L.. O.. W.. down your system and cause 
many programs not to load at all. Running BBSLAW directly from 
DOS is simple and recommended!
        
We get calls now and then about the document generation program 
not loading. In EVERY occasion that this occurs it is because you 
have less than 448K FREE RAM. Really. Honestly. Let's assume that 
you have a computer with 640K RAM. You can still be running with 
less than 448K RAM free by loading numerous drivers, TSR's and 
shells. Please check what your free memory is if you find that 
the document generator will not load and drops you to DOS 
following the instructions above. Please note that your system 
can be configured with many megabytes of ram, but STILL HAVE LESS 
THAN 448K free within the first 640KB! Unless you use memory 
management software, you can have 10 megs of RAM, but have less 
than 448KB free in the first 640KB.
        
There is no minimum requirement for graphics adapters or color. 
The program will happily run on a text-mono system; and it looks 
very great on a VGA system! Due to our design philosophy the 
program will run on a system with NO color and no graphics 
capability at all.

A printer is recommended so that you can fully use BBS LAW (You 
cannot print out legal documents without access to a 
printer.)
        
                            SECTION 2
                       USE OF THE PROGRAM
        
STEP ONE (LOGICALLY) STARTING THE PROGRAM
        

Section 2-1 QUICK START MANUAL
        
A separate file on this disk contains a "quick start manual" for 
experienced applications users which gives all of the active keys 
for each program. A detailed manual follows.
        
Section 2-2 START UP AND MAIN MENU

In order to start the program, be sure that you have either have 
the computer in the legal subdirectory or that the program is on 
the current path. Now type:
        
                             <BBSLAW>
        
(or <bbslaw> or <bbSLAW> in MS-DOS, they are the same to the 
computer.) and press the Return
        
                            <Return>
        
key. The main menu offers a help screen.
        
Section 2-3
MOUSE USERS
        
Your mouse driver must be loaded before attempting to use a mouse 
on the program. For more information on loading your mouse 
driver, please see the manual which came with your rodent. To 
begin using the program, type

                            <Mbbslaw>
        
then <Return>. Clicking the left button sends a carriage return, 
the right button page down, both buttons, sends Escape. Moving 
the rodent up and down advances the cursor up and down. NOTE: We 
do not have a separate mouse cursor. The mouse is emulating the 
cursor keys.
        
Section 2-4
SELECTING FROM THE OPTIONS PROVIDED

To select your choice, either use the cursor keys (up and down 
arrows) to highlight the choice you want, or, enter the letter 
corresponding to your choice, and then press

                            <Return>.

We will explain the operation of the statutes, and tutorials 
(mini-seminars), document preparation and editing documents 
separately.
        
Section 2-5
THE SHELL GAME- OUR DOS "SHELL"
        
Choice "S"- DOS Shell-- Our DOS "shell" is a utility program 
which allows you to perform tasks, while retaining the HOME LEGAL 
GUIDE in memory. For example, if you want to format a floppy 
disk, but do not want to exit the program, then choose the DOS 
Shell option, by either highlighting this option using the cursor 
keys (up and down arrows) or pressing

                               <S>
        
then press <RETURN>. You will then see a message indicating that 
your operating system has been loaded. For example, 

              Microsoft (R) MS-DOS (R) Version 3.30
              (C) Copyright Microsoft Corp. 1981-1986
        
you may then operate DOS commands. At all times, the Home Legal 
Guide remains in memory. To resume use of the program, type 
<EXIT> and then <Return> or <Enter>  (On some machines the key is 
marked return, on others enter, and some have a left descending 
arrow.) This will return you to the opening screen.
        
Section 2-6
The Navigator
        
At the bottom of each screen the active keys are listed, and what 
each key does. This "navigator" strip is your first resource for 
help in getting around the program.
        
Section 2-7
STATUTES MENU
        
BBS LAW contains the full text, with attorney's explanations of 
many important laws and governmental regulations. To choose this 
option from the main menu, press

                               <B>
        
and then <ENTER> (Return), or highlight this option by using the 
cursor keys- up and down arrows. Once you are reading the full 
text, you will occasionally see blocks of text marked with "/*" 
and closed with "*/." These are distinguishing placeholders to 
show comments as opposed to the full text of the law or 
regulation. Copyright stuff: We do not claim copyright on 
government material contained in the statutes menu. However we do 
claim copyright on all the rest of the program and on the 
comments within the statutes.

Section 2-8 BROWSING THROUGH THE STATUTES
        
You may read the statutes by pressing the page up, page down,   
cursor keys for up and down (up and down arrows.) The left and 
right cursor keys are special. The left arrow key returns you to 
the previous comment; the right arrow searches for the next 
comment.

If you press the left arrow key and the text does not change, 
this means that you are seeing the first comment; if you press 
the right arrow key and the text does not change you are then 
viewing the last comment in the file.

Section 2-9 LET'S TAKE NOTES
USE OF THE "NOTE PAD"- JOT NOTES WHILE LEARNING ABOUT THE LAW
        
If you want to take a note while reading the tutorial, put our 
memory resident note pad to work. From any point once you are 
reading the text of the tutorial type

                      <F2> (Function key 2)
        
and then a note pad will open on the bottom of the screen. This 
is a nice feature so that you won't lose your place or have to go 
get a pad and paper if you find something interesting that you 
might want to take notes about. Since it is for jotting notes, we 
have made it very simple to use. Simply type in your note, using 
the backspace key to erase characters.

                          NOTE PAD HELP
        
To get help regarding the note pad utility, simply press

                    <F1>, (function key one)
        
while the note pad is open. The help screen contains a full 
explanation of the note pad's use.
        
PRINTING OUT YOUR NOTES
        
To print out our notes, make sure that your printer is ready,   
power on, properly connected, with paper and ribbons, and then 
press

                      <F3> (Function key 3)
        
ERASING AND SAVING NOTES
        
                     <F10> (Function key 10)
        
erases everything on the note pad. You cannot recover notes once 
erased by using F10. To "toggle" back and forth between the note 
pad and the text of the tutorial, press

                      <F2> (Function key 2)
         
Your notes are saved automatically every time that you toggle 
back and forth between the note pad and the tutorial's main text. 

Section 2-10 SPECIAL STATUTE- DEFINITIONS
        
This program contains a special "statute"- the on line legal 
phrase dictionary. Select this option to look up unfamiliar legal 
terms. Please let us know if you find other words we should 
define.

Section 2- 11 EXITING THE STATUTES
        
To leave a statute, you may press

                          Escape <ESC>

which will return you to the statutes menu. To return to the main 
menu, press

                               <M>
        
To exit the program completely, press

                               <X>
        
which will send you back to DOS and quit the program.   

Section 2-12 TUTORIAL (MINI-SEMINAR) MENU        
                WHAT IS A TUTORIAL/ MINI-SEMINAR?
        
The HOME LEGAL GUIDE mini-seminars called "tutorials" about the 
subjects that our research and your requests show are of the most 
interest to our users. To select this option, either highlight 
option C from the main menu, or, enter the letter

                               <C>
        
Then press <ENTER> (Return.)
        
These "tutorials" or "mini-seminars" are a discussion of the 
rights and obligations that the law provides for each tutorial 
area. LET US KNOW ABOUT OTHER AREAS OF INTEREST AND WE'LL PREPARE 
SOMETHING ON THAT AREA IN THE FUTURE. You're the boss. 

Section 2-13 SELECTING A TUTORIAL/MINI-SEMINAR
        
Once you have determined which tutorial you might want to read or 
review, please highlight it by using the cursor keys (up and down 
arrows). Then press <Return>. You will then be able to see the 
text of a tutorial.

You can read through the tutorial by using the cursor keys, page 
down, page up or the home or end keys. (Note that our clever 
programming methods- Good job Warren-- make going from one end to 
another virtually instantaneous.)

Section 2-14 TAKING NOTES
        
You may take notes as discussed in Section 2-9.
        
Section 2-15 READING FULL TEXT OF LAWS OR REGULATIONS DISCUSSED- 
OPENING A SECOND WINDOW
        
Let's get back to the tutorial. If you would like to read and 
review the full text of the laws discussed in a tutorial or 
mini-seminar, you can review this simultaneously with the 
tutorial by opening a second "window." To do so, press the letter 


                               <S>
        
and you will be able to select to view the on line dictionary or 
view a help screen for tutorials. In addition, many tutorials 
also have further explanatory material.
        
To select which option you desire, use the cursor keys (up and 
down arrow) to highlight the item you want to view. Then press 
return. The selected item (the on line dictionary, help or other 
materials) will then appear on the screen; to toggle back and 
forth between the mini-seminar and the selected full annotated 
text, press

                               <O>

You can still open a note pad if you have both the mini-               
seminar and the full text selected. Many mini-seminars have more 
than one full text selection. If you want to review a different 
full annotated text from that originally selected, return to the 
tutorial, and press

                               <S>
        
which will reopen the full annotated text menu. Select the new 
full text by using the cursor (up and down arrow keys). 

Section 2-16 DEFINITIONS OF LEGAL TERMS                         

If legal terms are used in the mini-seminar, they are also 
defined in the on line legal dictionary. Simply press

                               <S>
        
and select this option for the on line legal phrase book- our 
mini legal dictionary. Press 


                               <O>
        
to toggle back and forth between the dictionary and the text. To 
select help or full text, return to the tutorial text, press

                               <S>
        
and select the other full text.

Section 2-17 EXITING THE TUTORIAL
        
To stop reading, press Escape

                              (ESC)
        
to return to the tutorial menu,

                               <M>
        
to return to the main menu, or

                               <X>
        
to exit (quit) the program and to return to DOS. That was 
easy-wasn't it!
        
Section 2-18 DRAFTING DOCUMENTS

                     THE DOCUMENT GENERATOR
        
We are very proud of our document generation program and hope 
that you will be as well. Through the use of this part of the 
program you will be able to draft custom legal papers that are 
legal and binding in all 50 states. These forms will accomplish 
their objectives of course, if you use a form that isn't right, 
or doesn't completely accomplish your goal, you'll have a legal 
and valid form that accomplishes something other than you 
desired.

                         READ CAREFULLY
        
************************************************************
        
IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY REVIEW DOCUMENTS THAT YOU 
PREPARE FROM TIME TO TIME; THE DOCUMENTS HEREIN ARE VALID IN THAT 
IF THEY ARE PROPERLY PREPARED THEY WILL BE EFFECTIVE TO CAUSE THE 
INTENDED RESULT. THIS MEANS HOWEVER, THAT A USE OF THE FORMS FOR 
AN INAPPROPRIATE PURPOSE WILL RESULT IN AN INAPPROPRIATE RESULT. 
WE IMPLORE YOU TO SEEK LEGAL COUNSEL IF THE FAILURE OF A LEGAL 
FORM TO ACCOMPLISH THE INTENDED PURPOSE WILL BE FINANCIAL LOSS. 
UNDER THE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES HEREIN, DAMAGES MAY NOT BE 
RECOVERED FOR THE MONETARY LOSSES AND OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SHOULD A FORM NOT MEET YOUR NEEDS. YOU'LL 
STILL SAVE TIME AND MONEY BY USING THE FORMS- JUST HAVE THEM 
REVIEWED. IN ADDITION BE SURE TO GET THE LATEST FORMS BY CHECKING 
IN FOR UPDATES.
        
************************************************************
        
In order to begin using the forms generator, from the main menu, 
please select option "D", prepare legal documents, by either 
entering

                               <D>

        
and then <Return> or using the cursor keys (up and down arrows) 
to select this option.
        
NOTE THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE SCREEN OF CHOICES, either scroll 
to the end, or use "Page Down" (you may have to do this more than 
once) to see all selections.
        
The document menu lists the many available choices. Use the up 
and down arrows to highlight the document which you want to 
select.
        
************************************************************
LAWS CHANGE AND THIS MAY FORCE A CHANGE IN FORMS TO MAKE THEM 
COMPLY WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. PLEASE BE SURE TO CHECK FOR 
UPDATES. WHAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED CONTAINS THE FORMS TO THE DATE OF 
SHIPPING AND IS SUPPLEMENTED AND UPDATED REGULARLY. 
************************************************************
        
Once "inside" a document you will have the opportunity to enter 
information, and "custom build" your form.

SECTION 2-19 BUILDING DOCUMENTS: SCREENS
        
You will then see two types of form building screens- a multiple 
choice box and a fill in the blank box.

SECTION 2-20 FILL IN THE BLANK SCREENS

        
First the fill in the blank box:
        
Enter, exactly as you wish to see it, the information requested. 
Be careful to put it in the format requested- if the fill in the 
blank box asks for the information in numerals, use numerals. If 
it asks for information in numbers, enter numbers. Once you have 
finished filling in the blanks, then hit return. You can "edit" a 
line prior to entering "return" by using the backspace key. If 
you have made a horrible goof and want to start from scratch, use 
the tab forward key to highlight the "cancel" choice on the 
bottom of the dialogue box, and press return. The document will 
then be canceled. You will be returned to the document 
preparation main menu. A second option is to leave the document 
with the error and fix it with the on-line word processor.
        
On occasions the space which is provided for entry of data is too 
small. In that case, simply enter in the fill in the blank box 
"See exhibit 1 (etc.)" and use a separate sheet to continue. Or 
you can fill in the document and then use the built-in word 
processor to put in the rest of the information.
        
SECTION 2-21 MULTIPLE CHOICE SCREENS

You will also see multiple choice boxes. Use the up arrow and 
down arrow (cursor keys) to place the "bullet" in the choice that 
you would like, and press <Return>.

SECTION 2-22 NUMERICAL AMOUNTS
        
When amounts of money need to be input, enter them in the 
following form:
        
                      213.45  or  22000.00
        
commas and dollar signs are not required and should not be used. 
The program will prompt for numerical amounts and then will 
transliterate them into their numerical equivalents. Thus, if you 
enter 100, the program will show it as $ 100.00 (One hundred 
dollars and xx/100) automatically!
        
SECTION 2-23 SUGGESTED INPUTS
        
Many screens contain suggested inputs. For example, the "number 
of days between installments" on the installment promissory note 
has several choices. The final choice "KEY IN VALUE" allows you 
to put whichever choice you desire in the form if the suggestions 
don't fit your needs. To enter your own value, place the bullet 
in the key in value choice and then press ENTER. Then type in 
your choice.
        
SECTION 2-22 FINISHING DOCUMENTS- NAMING DOCUMENTS
        
Once you've finished preparing a document, press

                               <S>
        
(for save) and then fill in the name of the document. Ms-dos 
limits you to eight characters and an extension on a file, for 
example- "guide.exe." We don't-- your document can be named 
meaningfully using up to 72 characters, including blanks-- Thus, 
a note from Joe to Fred for $ 1.00 done on 

                      12/1/92 can be named:
        
Note from Joe to Fred- value $ 1.00 dated 12/1/92
        
Use a completely descriptive name so you will know exactly what 
the document is.
        
SECTION 2-23 PRINTING DOCUMENTS
        
To print out a document, after completing your answers, and 
seeing the document, press <P>, and a dialogue box will ask you 
use the cursor key to say "yes" or "no." Before saying yes be 
sure that the printer is connected to the computer, turned on, 
has ribbons and paper. (Or if it is a laser printer, that it has 
toner and paper!) You may use a printer of your choice from daisy 
wheel, a dot matrix to a laser.

IF YOU ARE USING A LASER PRINTER BE SURE TO CLEAR OUT ANY CODES 
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SET FOR GRAPHICS OR LANDSCAPE PRINTING. THE 
PRINT OUTPUT IS ORDINARY "ASCII."
        
The specific forms and the information required to complete them 
are discussed in section 3.
        
SECTION 2-24 REVIEWING DOCUMENTS
        
To print out a document which you previously saved, go to the 
main menu and either use the cursor key or enter the letter

                               <E>
        
and then press <Return>. The documents, with titles that you have 
chosen will appear on screen. To see one, highlight that document 
and press <Return.> To print, press

                               <P>

check that you are ready and then print away. To delete a 
document, first select the document, and press enter so that you 
are viewing that document. To delete hold down the <Alt> key and 
while holding the ALT key down, press <D> (for delete.) This will 
permanently erase a document, and in most cases even an undelete 
program will not save you! Be sure that you intend to do so 
before zapping a document to never-never land!
        
SECTION 2-25
EDITING DOCUMENTS
        
Once you have prepared a document, you may change it with the 
built in text editor. 

The text editor contains a complete help screen. Just hit

                              <F1>
for complete help.

        
NOTE: THE MOUSE IS DISABLED DURING USE OF OUR EDITOR.
        
                            SECTION 3
        
                   FORMS- INFORMATION REQUIRED
        
SECTION 3-1 FORMS IN GENERAL

In this section of the manual, we'll explain what information   
is needed to prepare each form, and will outline for what 
purposes the form is useful.

Chapter 3 is contained in a separate file.

Section 4-1 BBS SCREENS/BULLETINS

BBS LAW provides many BBS screens and bulletins. Please note that 
YOU MUST REGISTER the program before you may use the screens and 
bulletins. All registered users who use BBS screens must add as a 
bulletin to their system the bulletin entitled "Copy.Bul." 
(Copy.bul is a screen which notifies users that some screens and 
text are reproduced under license from this program.)

Section 4-2 POLICIES

The program provides the following policy statements, which can 
be used as bulletins.

A) DOWNTIME.POL--

The purpose of this policy is to eliminate liability for 
downtime, whether planned or unplanned. Without any statement 
whatsoever an implied condition of the contract between a paying 
user and a BBS could be construed to require continuous service, 
or, that the same service hours as prevails when a user 
registers with a BBS will be continued. If downtime occurs, this 
would be a breach of the implied contract and would entitle the 
user to damages. These damages could include a rebate and lost 
profits or other damages if a message doesn't go through etc. The 
Uniform Commercial Code (to the extent that BBS service is a good 
rather than a service) provides that limitations on the remedy 
for a breach of contract may be.

B)- We also provide two policies related to the provision of 
buy/sell areas, limiting liability of the system, and pointing 
out that the BBS is not making the offers.

C)- We recommend that you post your state's computer crimes law 
as a bulletin. (Please strip out our comments first!) The files 
are named ??-law.sta, where ?? equals the post office 
abbreviation for your state.

Please note that several legal forms also double as BBS screens.
        
SECTION 5

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
        
Section 4-1: SUPPORT
        
After registration of this program, you are entitled to support 
through a private bulletin board, the Blue Ridge Express. Regular 
and deluxe registrations offer support via phone. We also are on 
EXEC PC and GENIE and visit daily. On GENIE please address mail 
to H.KRAFT1 and on EXEC-PC, please address mail to Herb Kraft. 
The numbers at the Blue Ridge Express and EXEC PC are listed 
above.

Section 5-2 Philosophy
                      
We try to place customer service first! Let us prove it to you! 
Many forms, tutorials, etc. were suggested by our users! Let's 
hear from you! It is our intention to answer questions from our 
users in the monthly updates. Please share your concerns and 
questions with us. We will provide reasonable support to 
potential registered users through the BBS systems mentioned.

SECTION 5-3 WORDS ABOUT SHAREWARE
        
This program is shareware. IT IS NOT FREE SOFTWARE. BBS LAW  has 
been authored by a group which has over 20 programs sold 
commercially. Our best seller in the commercial field, THE PC 
ATTORNEY (which is similar to this program, but just generates 
documents) has sold over 100,000 units. THE PC ATTORNEY has been 
recognized by a number of industry publications as a best seller. 
SEARS BRAND CENTRAL has featured the PC ATTORNEY on its best 
sellers list for many months. Our flag ship shareware program, 
The Home and Business Legal Guide was a top 10 best seller in 
1990 and 1991, and continues to be a top seller at disk vendors 
and user groups. Basically, shareware is commercial software 
marketed on trust. Just like there is good and bad commercial 
software, there is good and bad shareware. At least with 
shareware, you get a full test drive before you spend. Any fee 
you paid to a disk vendor was for the disks, and the catalog, 
support etc. We receive no fees from disk vendors. Our only 
compensation s that which we receive directly from our users.
        
SECTION 5-4
        
Registrations may be mailed to:
        
BBS LEGAL GUIDE, INC.

The document preparation program prepares forms for all levels of 
registration.

SECTION 6
WHO WE ARE
        
It takes many persons to put together a project of this 
magnitude. The staff that prepared this program consist of:
        
Herbert Kraft (Herb), J.D., Developer and author of legal 
material, comments and documents, Chief Developer (It's all my 
fault-- honest)
        
Warren Clary, P.E., Software engineer and co-developer, Warren is 
the author of the computer program itself (and did a tremendous 
job!)
Amy Seeberger; research and support; and,
Scott Briscoe, research, chief of customer support and 
fulfillment.

Thanks to many BBS sysops who spoke to us about this program, and 
to the thousands of BBS operators who making BBSing a reality.
