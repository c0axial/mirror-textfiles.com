        All sysops be on alert for someone with the real name of
Bradford Ludes (or sometimes just Brad Ludes).  He may seem like a decent
user however that is because he has had training.  He changes his alais
alot, thus we can't be sure on that aspect, you'll just have to go by
his real name.  He intends to search out almost every H/P/V/C type board
running ViSiON-X, ViSiON/2, LiQUiD, Renegade, PCBoard, Oblivion/2, etc.,
gain access, and attemp either crash or report the board to authorities.

****************************************************************************
HE IS A MAJOR LAMER AND ALL SYSOPS SHOULD DELETE HIS ACCOUNT IMMEDIATLY!
IF HE ATTEMPTS TO APPLY TO YOUR SYSTEM DON'T GIVE HIM ACCESS! RUMOR HAS IT
HE IS WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS ON A SEARCH OF ALL H/P/V/C BOARDS!
