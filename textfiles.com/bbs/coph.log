ALERT! COPH a consumer non-profit organization committed to help improve
lives of people with severe disability.  Our COPH BBS was very active and
successful for 4-5 years.  Equipment failure a few months ago forced us to
close it down temporarily.  We are now up but at a less sophisticated level.
We are looking for an experience person to volunteer as a sysop.  Or someone
to show us initially how to get started with (Opus Version 1,70) and how to
maintain and manage a BBS successfully.  We recently lost our experienced
sysop, but we have someone eager to learn.

If anyone can assist us, please contact: Dusan Bosnic at 312-282-3119 or
                                         Tom Shworles at 708-866-8195
