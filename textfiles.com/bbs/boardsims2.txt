Number of Definitions 33
                         From the early start to today
-----Definition 01-----
Remember the days of Disk-Fer written by the Red-Headed-Phreak?  Then
came many more amoung the years.  300 Baud was the standard.  Har.
-----Definition 02-----
First title page I saw was from theRazor.
It was on Space Eggs!

The 1st ware I got was back in 1980.  It was Cyber Strike.  Along with about 35
other disks, most cracked by the Super Pirates!
-----Definition 04-----
Remember Aztec (the game)? Why did it crash randomly?
-----Definition 05-----
My copy of Aztec hardly ever booted, even then it would crash.
Anyone ever call boards in the 1980-1981 time period?
-----Definition 06-----
Does anyone remember The Greek Inn? (312 area) It went down about 7
months ago still at 300 baud ONLY.
-----Definition 07-----
Remember when mentioning The Motherboard Elite could get you access on ANY BBS
in the United States? Bart's the one who got me started...
-----Definition 08-----
Back in the days when typing "99e99" at any prompt would crash the board?
Or, it wasn't even until 83 that the latest mod was a newscan!

y 5 or so "meg" boards in the U.S.?
-----Definition 13-----
Remember when 110 baud was the cutting edge of modem technology? I don't.

Hey, Rio, it coud be worse.
My old boss was telling us (me and one other cook) about a very, well,
disgusting, thing that happened one night.
I'm sure you've all heard about people drinking something and somehow (usualy
accedently) blowing it out their nose, right?  Well, He was with this girl, and
yea, she went down on him.  Things are going real good right up until the point
where he released it.  She started to swallow, but gaged and somehow ended up
with it comeing out her nose.
What was real bad about it was we all new the girl, as she worked there too.

That sentiment obviously comes from people who have never seen Mackaulay Culkin
"act"..  Go rent the movie The Good Son.  Hang on, STEAL the movie The Good
Son, as to avoid paying anything for that piece of junk..  After you witness
just how bad of an actor he is (it physically HURT to watch him! It did!)

:What is The Curse Entity:
     The Curse Entity is a creation (upon request) of traveler definable
sub-boards with a single controller.  How it works is like this:
     If  you want/need  creation of  a  board,  you  request  the creation via
[F]eedback on the Main Menu.  If created, the person that requested it becomes
the  "controller"  of the board.   The  controller  is  the  sole  person that
validates (adds) and terminates travelers for that particular sub-board.   The
controller  also  has  the  option  of  passing  control (if they are going on
vacation and won't be around for validation, etc).
     A good example would be a group board.   Where you can request a creation
of a board like  "The 1200 Club"  and  *only* 1200 Club members can access it.
No one else that is not on the "Current Travelers with Access" will be able to
access the board (not even me: the sysop).   Total security!  You can now have
a "homebase" away from a homebase group board.
     Requests can be anything.   A California board just for Californians.   A
Serious  Music  Board  for  people who don't want to worry about problems with
other  travelers  or  bad  information, etc!   You  become a sysop of your own
board.  The limitations are endless!
                                                      
Enjoy.   Where else but The Curse can you create & control your own sub-board! 
Use [F]eedback for any comments or requests.     Do it now and become a Sysop!

Basic Idea of The Curse BBS:
----------------------------  
   Create a place where Travelers (YOU) can explore and interact that will be a
different domain from the same old bulletin board systems (BBS) that you might
be used to.
     
     There will not be a huge file section to get all the lastet wares:
     ...But aren't there a million of those boards out there now?
     There will not be ANSI graphics/colors/bells & whistles:
     ...But aren't there a million of those boards out there now?
                                                   
Originality is the strength of The Curse BBS.  That's why its been around for
