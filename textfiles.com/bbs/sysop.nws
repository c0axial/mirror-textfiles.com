Hello all,
     I would like to discuss a condition known as the sysop madness.
This refers to the particular personalities that many sysops online
have. Most of this research analysys is as is due to the fact that most
bbs systems are run by children younger than 18, however older members
also posses the upcoming qualities. Many of the reasons for starting
these systems is because of the owner's need to feel superios, to play
the GOD role of small societies constructed by them to fit their own
needs, wants, desires, abnormalities, inferiorities,
unconformalities,etc. Many of these people have been known to hold
unhappiness, are subject to frequent depression in their everyday
lives, as well as being at a higher risk of suicide in general. These
peculiaralities often exist in the "computer nerd" worl anyhow. The
major group of terminal hoppers and systems owners that suffer froom           +
these conditions tend tobe teenage males from the ages of 12-17. Most
of these would be considered losers, misfits, unconformists, nerds,etc.
by their peers. Many feel inadequate and must compensate for that
social loss at point blank range, to them, usingtheir computers, often
an excellent way to cure many of these symtoms, not soo  much to cure
however as to give them a "nudge" into society. Soo keep on typing guys.
      Specifics to the sysop category include unhappy family structure,
unattained goals, general social problems, or general mental problems.
However these symptoms do in no way refer to "all" sysops. This
category includes only thos systems operators that operate the systems
from home. They tend to oftenbe difficult to get along with, rude and
mean to others, and find great offense from those of their own age
group. Because of some of the descriptions above, many tend to have
illogival and/or hasty judgement, as well as seing life under one
perspective, theirs.

This Comment ADDED by the SysOp

Sounds just like me!

This message was posted in an attempt to "get back" at me by an                +
ex-user I locked out of the system for misusing the resource last
week.  I have received phone calls from him (I suspect more than the
one where he used his real name) and now this "James Galt" posts a
poorly-spelled, terribly constructed message to tell the world how
neurotic I am.

How predictable that he believes that he got locked out because I am
mentally ill, and not because of his behavior.  This is one unhappy
ex-user.

Since I am SURE you will see or hear of this, "James", better pay
attention:  If you continue to harass me (and I WILL be able to prove
it...) I will file a formal complaint with the Nassau County District
Attorney's office.  I will also tell your mommy.

No more nonsense.
