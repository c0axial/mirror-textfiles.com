The Metal AE has seen everything, everyone, come and go over the past 8 or so
years.  Almost everyone who was anyone (the WHOS WHO of HACKERS!!) has called
here.  But now as I get older, its time to move on.  At the end of febuary
I will be moving out of this house, to my own place.  When this happens,
the Metal AE will not come with me for various reasons.  For one, living on
your own is not cheap, and money doesnt grow on trees here in beatiful northern
New Jersey.  If I cut my hair, and got a real job, I could buy a fucking Unix
with 10 lines to make everyone happy.  But I am not going to sacrafice my
standards to have the perks of life.  Anyway, if anyone wants to support the
Metal AE by donating a //+,//e, Franklin, or compat. I will keep paying the
phone bills for a few years to keep it up.  But that is doubtful, since it took
like 6 months to get a hard drive (that didnt work) so it would take a year
to get another computer.  But you never know, shit happens.



Murphys Law has a video out, Panty raid, which isnt too great, but at
least they have a video.  It can be seen on MTVs 120 minutes on Sunday nite.


Is Coroner any good?  I saw a video of them, and from what lyrics I could under
stand they were pretty good...   Sound sorta like Sodom or something...

lease not bother to call here...noneo ffthe true users of this system wish to he
re from you and your pathetic so-called 'elite' attitudes...games are for childr
en who get erections over their nintendos and playing with their dog's dicks...


go take your joysticks, 9600 baud modems, 100 meg hard drives and 13 year old ro
dent bodies some fuckin where else....contribute something more than your pathet
ic BBS ads....


sick of it in 602

If I'm right, you now have two fucked Siders in your possession.  One has a
screwed disk and the other a screwed power supply.  Open them both up and put
the good parts from both together to get 1 good drive.

Lustfer, I have a 20 meg sider that I will give to you for your IBM 20 meg and 5
0 bucks.. that is 50 and your HD for my HD...

Leave a response.. (You can understand the 50 right? I need some cash, and hey-
I paid 600 for my HD and a 20 meg IBMer is about 300 bucks).  Well I don't want
to see my HD collecting dust around ehre so I want you to have it, and being the
 IBM (yech) user that I have been forced to becomne, I don't need my sider, and
I do need 20 megs for the ole IBM.. So leave a response... Thanks.

Lustfer, I've been calling this system from Michigan now for five fucking yearsT
his system, as far as I know, is not only the last Neon Knight system in the   w
orld, but is probably the last underground AE in the whole country.

DON'T take it down!!!!  Wherever you go, put it up.  People will call.  You know
that.  Even if you're running off of these two floppies instead of your Sider,
people still call, and always will.  This system is the only thing left from the
"Real" modeming days, not this GBBS bullshit that's running now.  Do us a
fucking favor and don't take down the METAL AE!!!!!!!!!!

PTL is the NEWEST graphics program out today.

It uses the most involved "M2 Direct" graphics routines which will boggle your
mind.

It was written by Mr. L. Death, system absentee of the Metal AE, who has a long
background in specialty graphics.

Its only 2 (TWO) sectors long, so take that 9.2 seconds and download PTL,
you'll be glad you did!




(C) 1989 Metal AE
You can obtain a AUTOGRAPHED version of PTL by leaving a request on drive one
on The Metal AE (201 879 6668) with your name and telephone number for a small
donation to the Metal AE.  Upload PTL wherever you go!
