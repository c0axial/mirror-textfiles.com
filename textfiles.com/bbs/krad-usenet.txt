What does the "k" of k-rad stand for?

kilo-rad?  (like 1000x as rad....)
kevin mitnick-rad?  (heh)
kracked-rad   (for all the warez d00ds out there)

I just don't get it.  Anyone?

The 'k' is as in kilobytes.  It's warez-speak.

I would assume it's it's just a cross-over from the k in k-k00l. Then again,
probably not. Then again, who gives a flying fuck about the etymology of a word
like k-rad?

<Picking up my cane and spectacles.  Inserting false teeth>

Well, shonny... back in my day, the 'k' in k-rad stood for 'kewl' .  As in
"Kewl-rad".

We used it to describe new software that was released.  eg.  "How's the new
game."  "It's f*cking k-rad, dude!"

etc...  You could put 'k' infront of just about everything.

The only time I['ve heard of it was to make fun of warez doodz... in that
people who use "k-rad" are lame... so in the back of my mind I thought that
k-rad was some marketing scheme by K-Mart in the early eighties that I was too
young to remember.

The expression 'k-rad' has been around at least since 1988.  I don't think that
the 'k' has any particular meaning except to aid in making cryptic ASCII-ed
bastardizations of the English language like:

/<-R@[) [)00[)

It doesn't surprise me that this is popular again, considering back in the good
old days the real hackers laughed at people who did this.  Hacking has changed.

No, real hackers *still* laugh at people who do this.

I think all the 'k-rad's that you see around here are jokes.  I *hope*
so, anyway.

	K-Rad has been arround forever.   Mainly came up in my experience
with Apple // warez traders.  At that point it was a compliment, or an
endorsement (ie. "The Pirate's Pit is k-rad man.")  But more recently,
I'd say 91 or so, it was used to describe hte 'lamers' 'rodents' and
other 'elite' annoyances.  Now you only see k-rad on renegade boards
where 90% of the users have high-ASCII in their handles.

Now we can them quote their favourite Beavis and Butthead comments in

Ok, here's the real story (I hope)...

In the apple "scene" there was a group called MPG (Midwest Pirates Guild).  
One of the members of that group (who's handle I forget) used to talk really 
quick, and instead of saying stuff like "Ok, cool", he'd say, "'K, Cool".  
Thus begat "k-cool", which later spawned into "k-rad", "k-k00l", etc.

I think k-cool also meant kilo-cool or 1,000 times cool.

It's been around a lot longer than 1988... I remember even back in
'82 when k-rad/k00l/etc was considered rodent speak.  Hmm.. maybe
it had a lot to do with the /<-/<o0l spinning cursor days of
cat-fer boards.

	I was under the impression that the K-rad movement started out on the
C-64 boards.  In any respect, that's where I had seen it back in the early
eighties.  I remember that k-rad popping up on AII's and such, and people     
screaming for those to go back to there "Ultra k-rad k00l Commie B0rds"

Ah, cat-fur and elite NetWorks! 99e99! I seem to remember having
somewhere at home on my //e a file circa '83 that listed all the "D000D"
speak. I believe their examples of usage for K- were K-K000L, K-RAD,
K-MART.

Wish I had a serial card for the //e or a floppy drive for my mac so I
could archive all the elite docfiles.

Where do I come in?  Well, I'm one of the original 4 MPG members.  And
yes, we did start the K-craze  (Spontaneously without inspiration from
outside sources)

Disclaimer: It started spontaneously for us in 1982, it certainly could
have elsewhere at any time.

No, it didn't come from K as in Kilobytes.  The "K" concept originated
from our style of saying "Okay, bye" on the phone.  One late night in a
hurry to hack the latest ware before anyone else did, we hung up with a
"k-bye".  It just happened, without thinking.  It sounded cool.

(Back then, we were on the phoen A LOT.  Folks called all the time.
Wanting BBS access, software, etc.  We tended to work while we talked,
stream of conciousness kinda stuff.)

We hung out, ate pizza, cracked warez.  I believe Sinbad (one of the 4)
was the first to go "k-cool" dude.  It sounded Kool.  From there we all
went nuts.  For months it was K-this, K-that, we made ourselves
sick--Eventually settling down to our original K-cool & K-bye.

We had several BBSs.  The most popular and well known was the Safehouse.
It wasn't surprising how it spread.  We had over 10,000 users on our
systems combined and habitually wrote "kbye" and "k-cool" on our
messages.  Heck, I think we even put it on a few title pages.

(Those pages designating who hacked the software)

Anyway, for what it's worth, that's how it started for us.  I find it
funny that folks use it in the "k/thousands" sense.  It makes sense,
though we never thought of it in that way ourselves.  So in a way, I'm
sure many contributed.

Hope that helps.  More than you wanted to know eh?

I also vaugely remeber a section of FAmily Computing that was really lame
on yellow pages they called K-Rad I think.  I think it used to be a
separate magazine but again, it was really lame...oh well...interesting
real story behind it though...

This is exactly where I remember seeing it appear.. and eventually it became
used as way to sarcastically mock rodents.. 

btw, Matthew, I still  have a copy of "Delightful Dialer" ;)
