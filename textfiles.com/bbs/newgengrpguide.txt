                         THE NEW GENERATION GROUP GUIDE
 
                                     by
 
                                  Beezlebart!
 
Well, after a short period of time, I decided to write a second New Generation 
Guide.  As you remember, when I speak of 'New Generation' I am referring to all
of you who have aquired your modem in the last   months or so..
 
This guide will help you in your pursuits to set up, and run a user group. That
group can have many reasons for being formed, some such as:
  -Pirating
  -Phreaking
  -Partying
  -Authority
If you have trouble with any of these, there are plenty of files to help you 
with some of those subjects.
 
First of all, for a good group, you must think of a name that is authorative, 
and sounds powerful.  The reactions of other users towards your group will be
in direct relationship to the 'powerfulness' of the name.
Here are a few ideas for you:
   RUGGIE BURNERS OF AMERICA
   THE MEAN DUDESTERS
   WE RULE THE BBS SCENE ELITE!
   KNIGHTS OF DARKNESS
   SUPREME TRIBUNAL ELITE!
Be sure to name of your group according to what you want to accoplish with the
group.. Such as, if you just want to be knon, and respected, I would suggest
any of the above.. If you are a party group, call yourself the 'Though Police'.
Heh, no just joking, if you are a party group, try something like 'THE BEER
GUZZLERS ELITE AT 300 BAUD' or something to that effect.
Be original, and make sure to use 'psuedo-spellings', such as instead of a name
like 'COOL DUDES OF DEATH', call yourselfs the 'K00l D00DZ OF DETH!', or
something like that..  All appropriate letter combination substittions can be
found in the 'New Generation Sysops Guide.'.
 
Next, for you to have a good group, you need members.  If you run a BBS
that you set up using the 'New Geneation Sysops Guide', then pot this message
in your announcements.  If not, post it on a BBS you call regularily. 
 
Here is a typical 'recruit' message, and will work best for your uses.
 
TITLE: NEED MEMBRRS!!!!!!!
 
First, lets look at the title..  It should be in upper case, and hav  quite a 
few explanation marks.  That will attract more users to read your message.
 
DATE POSTED: XX/XX/86
BY: YOU!
 
OK, DUDES!  WE ARE STARTING A NEW GROUP.
 
[First line- Declare it a new group, so users will know it new, and won't get 
it confused with a existing one..]
 
IF YOU THINK YOU ARE K-K00L, THEN PLEEEZE LEAVE ME EMAIL.
 
[Second line: First, make sure they know that they must be K00l, before they 
can oin your group.  But, there is a mistake here.  Instead of telling them
to leave you E-mail, just give your voice number.  That way, it can get star--
ed quicker, and will be benificial for everyone to know there group leaders
phone number.]
 
Ok, then finish by filling the rest of your message inText Graphics, then sign
off, always embedding backspaces in your name, and then we come to the most
important part..  Signing ff with the group nme.  Letssay your group name
was the 'Beer Guzzlers'.. Now you can abbreviate it to "TBG" for this example.
 
YOUR NAME/LOOKING FOR MEMBERS TO THE
********   *****    *****
   **      *    *  *     *
   **      *****   *
   **      *    *  *  ****
   **      *    *  *     *
   **      *****    *****
 
Big text letters ALWAYS have a tendancy to show POWER, and you will find that
immediately you have respect for your group.. 
When you have your membrs, you will have to make sue to teach them exactly 
how to sign off like that as to keep your signoffs uniform amongst members.
Make sure that all your mebers know that if they don't sign off like that, 
they will be kicked out of the group.
 
Now, what do the members do upon encountering someone raggin on the group?
 
Here are a few examples for 'come backs':
 
'I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I?!??!?!??!!??!???'
'DON'T BE A DICKLESS MOTHERFUCKING ASSHOLE!'
'I AM IN THE <WHATEVER> GROUP, SO SHUT UP!'
'HEY MAN IF YOU DON'T SHUT YOUR FACE, WE WILL COME OVER THERE AND BEAT UP YOUR
GRNDMOTHER AND RUN OVER YOUR DOG'
'YOU BETTER QUIT RAGGING ON US, YOU RUGGGGGGIEEE!!!!!!!!'
'I KNOW YOUR PHONE NUMBER NYAH NYAH NYAH!!!!!!!!!!!!'
'THE SYSOP IS MY FRIEND!'
 
So you can see, when you encounter ragging, then just counter act it with more.
It ALWAYS works.
 
Now, here are a few tis for 'Group Get-Togethers'.
 
Most of your embers will not drive, so they will need a ride.. Thus, you
should make the meating place,  or the party place, at a relatively easy place
for everyone to find.
.Like Maplewood Mall..
ell, where ever you decide to have the party, make sure everyone brings over
T-Shirts, then take a black marker, and paint on it, 
  "We are the big bad <GROUP AME>", and if you ever go toPirate Parties, or
any other parties, where there will be members of different groups, or jst
users there, make sure you were them.  Also, if oou meet at Maplewood Mall, 
where it arond the stores for awhile.
 
The main thing to remember about running a group can be summed up in one line:
 "Sound, Act, Post, and Think POWER"
The more power you express will influence on howmuch respect you get.  If you
post something and get ragged on by someone, and you don't come back very*
authorative, you have just lost your power, and you migtt have to re-name the
group.
In fact, a good group is often re-named 5-10 times before they stick with one.
So don't feel bad..  Change the name once a week, until you iind one you like.
 
Well, I hope this file helpdd some of you understand how a good group is run,
and willhelp you set up one, run it, and all the necessities of a group.
The next file you will see is 'The New Generation Programmers Guide.', 
including some very prorams that you can add to you BBS that you set up using
'The New Generation Sysops Guide.'!
