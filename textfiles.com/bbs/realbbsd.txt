    I  feel  that this text file needs  a before-hand  explaination.   This
    is a run off of Real users and Real sysops.  I enjoyed those text files
    and I wanted to see more of them.  I hope that this does not  offend  a
    bunch  of uptight sysops who actually write a constitution of rules for
    their BBS.  (Really, I could care less.)   I  mainly  wrote  this  file
    because  I  wanted  to  poke fun at sysops who thought that in order to
    retain authority think they have to make rules so  that  you  can't  do
    anything,  but post nice little just stopping by to say hi messages.  I
    thought the whole idea of BBSes is to give and get files, and  to  keep
    conversation going.
