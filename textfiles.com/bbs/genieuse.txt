                                06/11/90


Xtra-RAM              Frontier Software (*)                       95.00

  Once installed the Xtra-RAM will upgrade your .5MB ST (520ST, 520STfm)
to 1Mb, your 1Mb ST (upgraded 520STs, 1040STf, 1040STfm) to 2.5Mb, OR
your MEGA ST2 to 4Mb of RAM. With the Xtra-RAM you do no need to stop
with 1Mb, you can upgrade the Xtra-RAM later to give you 2.5Mb, simply
by changing RAM chips.

(*) Xtra-RAM is manufactured in England. Telephone (0432)567140. We will 
    honor the manufacturers warranty of 1 year.


Z-RAM 3-D/4Meg        Zubair Interfaces (213)408-6715            105.00

  Z-RAM is the universal, reliable and compact 2.5 to 4Mb upgrade in 1
kit for 520ST, 520STfm, 1040ST, Mega ST 2 computers. You can use 16 x
1Mb RAM chips to upgrade to 2.5MB and add another 16 to upgrade to 4MB
total. Z-RAM is two boards each holding 2MB soldered together with a 40
pin socket going through them. A pingrid board is cabled to the main
boards. The pingrid board piggybacks over the MMU chip. Z-RAM will work
with 1MB chips 120ns or less, even 150ns speed. (Solderless).


AERCO easiST          AERCO (512)451-5874                        125.00

2Mb to 4Mb of RAM. Please specify computer type when ordering this board 
as there are 2 separate boards (older systems with external disk drives
or systems with an internal disk drive). 


                               Upgrade Key

                         AERCO          Xtra-RAM          Z-RAM
              520ST       yes             yes              yes
              520STfm     yes             yes              yes
             1040STfm     yes             yes              yes
             MEGA ST2      no             yes              yes


"Why do we offer more than one upgrade board, simply because everybody
 has there own personal preference (recommondations from friends, etc).
 All 3 that we carry will do the job, or else we wouldn't carry it. Your
 ST and any peripherals that you might have will operate in exactly the
 same way as they have before, but you will have the added benefit of
 extras memory for your business programs, word processors, DTP packages,
 print spoolers, RAM disks and other programs."

This is a text file describing a simple way that I have devised of doing

                              Z-MODEM FAST AND DIRTY

             This is intended as a quick tutorial, for people somewhat new
        to the Z-Modem transfer protocol.  I've discovered some quick (and
        quite fun!) work-arounds; that I hope other people will be able to
        use.  This is an alternative to using a full blown terminal
        program, by using the features of the GEM Desktop.

             First off, a plug for two great programs that make this task a
        little easier, but are not absolutely necessary.  I have been using
        DC DeskTop, primarily because you can load another desktop
        configuration at any time, hence making this method a BREEZE. 
        Also, if you don't yet own MultiDesk...Get It!!!

             Well on to business.  In my second disk drive resides a disk
        of utilities, that I have "Installed as Applications," from the
        desktop.  (Read your ST owners manual if you don't know what I
        mean.)  One is D-Copy, for de-arcing arced files, another is UnLZH,
        for Un-LZHing LZH'd files.  By double clicking on any LZH or ARC
        file, they automatically extract to my ram-disk.

             All that said as background information now, let's get into
        the fun stuff!  From within DC DeskTop I load a special desktop
        that I've designed from which I do my "Quick and Dirty" transfers. 
        I have substituted my installed decompression programs with my
        Zmodem transfer program.  (SZ.TTP...which is available here on
        Genie.  I believe the most current file is ZMODEM18.ARC, but do
        your own search to be sure you have the most current version.) 
        This is what then happens:  SZ.TTP automatically runs and starts
        transferring the file I've selected automatically.  I do all of
        this from a ram disk, so the execution is blindingly fast.  What I
        think is the neatest thing about this is that it all takes place on
        the GEM Desktop, so everything is icon orientated, just double
        click.  (Try that on your IBM.)  

             All this is fun, sure, but how are we connected to the BBS you
        are probably thinking now?  Also on my ram disk is the program
        version of MultiDesk.  (By the way, have you seen version 2 yet. 
        Wow!  How does CFJ do it? !!!)  It is also an installed application
        so that whenever I double click on an .ACC file, MultiDesk executes
        it, just like it was a program.  So this happening from within a
        ram disk is fast as lightning too.  Currently I am just using
        Atari's EMULATOR.ACC,  VT-52 emulator (it came with your computer)
        to connect to the BBS of my choice.  After informing the BBS that I
        am going to send a file via Zmodem, I simply hit UNDO to exit back
        to the GEM Desktop, (you will not be disconnected) and then double
        click on the Icon of the file that I want to send.  When the file
        transfer is finished, I then double click on EMULATOR.ACC and I'm
        back on line ready to give a description of the file I've sent.

             I've mentioned DC DeskTop and MultiDesk, but, all this can be
        done without them.  Just boot with EMULATOR.ACC and select it when
        you need it from the Desk Accessory slot.  It's not as fun, but,
        will certainly be just as effective.  Also, you don't absolutely
        need to install another desktop as in DC DeskTop.  Just remove what
        ever installed application you have for ARC or whatever kind of
        file you are sending, then install SZ.TTP.  One other quick note in
        case you are using DC DeskTop.  Also in my ram disk is the file
        XYZ.PRG.  (XYZ.TTP renamed so I don't have to mess with the
        parameters dialogue box.)  I've installed an icon on the desktop
        for this program, with the hot key "W", so that when I hit the UNDO
        key to exit from terminal mode, I simple then type "W" to receive
        Z-Modem style.

             Well that's it!  Someday we might have a way of using Zmodem
        as a background transfer protocol, but, until then this could an
        alternate method of using Zmodem.  Of course I exempt myself of any
        kind of responsibility from any type of damage, crashes, blow ups,
        or other mean nasty ugly things that might happen when you try
        this. (I hate all that legal jazz.)  But, I am confident that all
        should go well and that you will enjoy this as an alternate method
        to transfer files.  

             If you like my idea, or even if you hate it, send me E-Mail. 
        (I love mail good and bad.)  My Genie address is W.Fenior.  Also,

Description:
  I had a hard time deciding if I should upload this file as a Utility or
a programming language.  I finaly decided to call it a language because it
requires a small amount of programming skill to put this to its best use. 
This program allows creating complex batch files which can be used to
automate quite a few maintinance operations.  It can also be installed on
the desktop to run .SUB files to allow point+click running of some types of
programs that may require some setup before running.  Please carefully read
both doc files and the example submit script.  Please note that the
SUBMIT.DOC file contains outdated address information.

This is a specialized program but can be used for other purposes.  The user  
can monitor up to 10 cars in up to 15 laps in a radio controlled car event
(or other).  This is an STOS compiled program that works on all ST's except
those with the new roms, so I am told.  This is a demo version which only
allows 5 cars and 5 laps, information on how to order the complete program and
documentation is included  with this file.  It runs in Medium Rez.
Thanks for supporting Atari ST developers.
