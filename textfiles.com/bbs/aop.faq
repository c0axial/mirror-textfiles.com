Q:  Where can I get basic information and/or an application for membership?
A:  There should be a file called "AOP.ZIP" where you found this faq.  It
    contains information and an application.

Q:  Since AOP is doing legislative and public policy work on behalf of
    system operators, how does it differ from the EFF.
A:  EFF is a fine organization, and we plan to work with them on issues
    where our interests coincide.  But there are three major differences in
    the two.  First and foremost is that AOP is a professional association
    whose focus is on delivering services to members.  EFF is primarily an
    education and lobbying organization.  Different structures, goals and
    agendas.  In addition to its public policy work, AOP will deliver a
    slate of services, from resource guides and discounts to certification
    programs.  Second, EFF has a **lot** of ground to cover.  They do not
    focus exclusively on the needs of sysops, as AOP does.  Third, its 
    broader focus means that sometimes EFF focuses considerable time and
    resources on issues of little direct importance to sysops.  AOP focuses
    **only** on the needs of our industry.

Q:  There have been other efforts at associations for sysops.  Why is AOP
    succeeding where others have not?
A:  We had some advantages not available to the other efforts.  The timing
    is right -- and even critical -- today.  We have the benefit of
    experience in starting and managing an association.  We have a full-time
    executive director managing the association, so we are not reliant on
    volunteers who have other commitments (like running their own companies
    and systems!) to meet.  And we started off with strong support from
    companies like Hayes and from leading sysops nationwide.

Q:  Why does AOP charge dues at the level it does?
A:  Because it is not possible to do the job without funding.  Lobbying takes
    money.  So does providing the kind of services that sysops need --like
    reliable legal advice and interpretation. . .discounts on product and
    services. . .and so does running a BBS.  We rely on a little bit of money
    from each member to pay for the staff and resources we need to do the 
    job.  And we take pride that AOP's dues are far below those of many
    other professional associations.

Q:  But shouldn't the companies who make a living pay to support this?
A:  They do.  But there are two issues involved.  The first is that companies
    pay more ($5,000 per year, for companies with more than $1 million in
    annual sales) in dues.  For this, they will get some services needed
    only by companies.  And they get to demonstrate a commitment to the
    well-being of our industry and the professional sysop community.

    But they are also looking for sysops to show that they are responsible
    enough to act in their own best interests.  Frankly, some previous
    efforts at association have failed because sysops simply didn't join
    or get involved.  If we are to be credible in asking companies for
    money. . .or in expecting Congress and the media to take us seriously
    . . .we must show that we are willing to work together as a profession.

Q:  But doesn't it make sense for sysops to wait three or four months
    before joining, to see if AOP continues to grow?
A:  Sure, that's a prudent approach.  And it's time to send your check!
    You see, AOP did not begin at ONE BBSCON this year.  By that time, we
    were already a going concern. . .duly incorporated in Washington, DC
    and actively tracking legislative issues.  We have been operating for
    almost five months now. . .getting organized. . .lining up support. . .
    soliciting corporate donations. . .and keeping an eye on Congress.
    We've already done our job.  Now it is your turn.

Q:  Why is it so important for me to join?  Isn't that the job of the bigger,
    more profitable BBS systems?
A:  Two goals are critical.  The first is that we show we are professionals.
    And the hallmark of a professional is a willingness to shoulder the
    responsibilities of our industry as well as ourselves.  Unless we can
    show that, we'll be viewed as anarchists and pornographers (but only
    for as long as it takes to pass laws to put us under FCC control or out
    of business).  The second goal, equally critical, is to get to 1,000
    members as quickly as possible.  At that level we will still need strong
    financial support from our corporate partners.  But at least we will have
    sufficient numbers to be credible as an association.  And to do that, we
    need you as a member.  Today.

Q:  Why haven't I seen this information on my network or the InterNet?
A:  Because we are still sorting out the rules.  Some members have been 
    to send our information along their networks for fear they will be
    "flamed" for "advertising" AOP. We are slowly getting sysops to
    understand that this is not a commercial ad, and it is beginning to
    get out on the networks.  But any assistance will be appreciated.

Q:  I've just sent my application, but this is important to me and I want
    to do everything else I can.  What more can I do?
A:  Three ideas come to mind.  First, become an advocate for AOP.  Tell
    other sysops that you are joining and why.  Spread the files to every
    BBS you frequent, and along the networks.  And make sure it is discussed
    by your local user groups and regional sysop organizations.

    Second, check your vendors to see if they are supporting AOP.  If they
    are not (and a few are still waiting to see what **you** do), let them
    know clearly that you expect them to support the sysop community by
    supporting AOP.

    Finally, be as active as you can.  Not everyone will want to join 
    committees or be active on our forums and BBS.  But it is important for
    use to work together as well as pay dues.  There are still plenty of
    open positions for sysops who want to make a difference.
