Several college libraries in the Boston area now have on-line catalogs which  
the public can access. Each one uses a different system, though, so to help  
you out, here is a guide to systems we know work and how to get into them. All 
accept 8-1-N settings (except UMass-Boston) and an 80-character screen is  
recommended. All have fairly easy to understand on-line help sections. Some  
may require a specific baud rate. If you have questions, all have voice  
numbers, or you can leave a message for the sysop on Fred the Middlesex News  
Computer, (508) 872-8461. Happy hunting! 

BOSTON UNIVERSITY: TOMUS. Data for 710,000 books and publications. 
ACCESS: (617) 353-9601 (either 300 or 1200 baud). Hit enter a couple of times, 
then type ``connect bux'' and hit enter. When you get the ``bux'' prompt, type 
``telnet library'' (no ``e'' after the ``l'' in telnet). Hit enter. Keyword  
search supports Boolean searches. To log off, type ``end,'' hit enter, 
``quit,'' enter and then ``off'' and enter. Voice help: (617) 353-3704. 

BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY: LOUIS (Library On-line User Information System). Catalogs 
roughly 90 percent of the university's two main libraries and most current  
periodicals. Older periodicals, government documents and most books and  
periodicals in Hebrew or Yiddish are NOT cataloged.
ACCESS: (617) 736-4690 (1200 baud). Hit enter a couple of times, and you're in 
the system. To log off, type ``end.'' Voice help: (617) 736-4670. 

MIT: BARTON. Includes all material acquired since 1974 except for periodical  
articles, maps, pamphlets and non-MIT technical reports. Some pre-1974  
publications are included.
ACCESS: (617) 258-6700 (1200 baud). Hit enter a couple of times. Uses same  
software as LOUIS at Brandeis. To log off, type ``end.'' Voice help: call

selection'' prompt, hit L and then enter. For ``username,'' type ``TULIPS''  
and hit enter. It takes a few moments for the system to connect. If you use  
communications software that does not support VT100 or VT220 emulation  
directly (such as Telix), your screen will begin to flash and seem to go  
berserk. Wait until it stops, then type ``??'' (yes, two of them) and you will 
get a help screen. Uses more complicated search system than other catalogs, so 
read directions carefully. Voice help: (617) 381-3345.

shelved near the one you originally requested. Voice help: (617) 235-0320,
