THOUGHTS ON CO-SYSOPS FOR WWIV BOARDS AND SECURITY LEVELS IN GENERAL...

WHAT IS A CO-SYSOP?

        A Co-Sysop is a responsible individual who bears some of the
responsibilities of running a board.  He or she performs such sysop duties as
the Sysop assigns and may be asked to perform all functions of the board in
the Sysop's absence.

WHAT IS A SUBSOP?

        A Subsop is an individual who performs maintenance functions on one
or more message base subs or transfer sections.  He generally has no other
functions to perform on the board and should have no access to functions he
does not need to maintain his assigned sub.

HOW SHOULD A SYSOP BE CHOSEN?

        A Co-Sysop should be well acquainted with the software so that he
may help set up the board, help maintain the board and operate the board
should the Sysop not be available.  Since he will have access to the mail
and user information and since his actions will reflect upon the board, the
Co-Sysop(s) preferably are known to and respected by the local BBS community.
There should only be as many Co-Sysops as are necessary to perform the
necessary functions and provide coverage for when the Sysop may be absent.
Sysops, Co-Sysops and those involved with setting up other boards with the
same software are good candidates for Co-Sysops.  If no such people are
available then a Co-Sysop can be chosen from among the most active supporters
of a board who has already shown willingness and loyalty to the board.

SECURITY LEVELS

        Generally most users should have the same security level to start
with.  Time increases and ul/dl ratio exemptions can be given to those users
who have contributed to the board through active posting and/or uploading.
Access to sensitive functions like user information and the E-mail should
be strictly limited to only those who can be trusted by the users and who
need access to those functions.  If anonymous posting is allowed at all on
a board, the ability to read anonymous posts must be severely limited to
just the Sysop and whatever Co-Sysop will stand in for him in his absence.

WHO IS NOT SUITABLE AS A CO-SYSOP? AND PRIVACY ISSUES

        Not suitable as a Co-Sysop is anyone who does not meet the
qualifications as a Co-Sysop even if they are good friends of the Sysop.
A board that grants the ability to read anonymous posts and access to user
information and mail to those who do not need that access will quickly become
a private club.  All users deserve to know who the Co-Sysops are and should
know that from the opening screens so that user may chose not to register if
that user is not comfortable with particular individuals having access to
his/her user information.   Whenever possible, new Co-Sysops should be
announced before they are given access to permit users who object to request
deletion from the system before their personal information and mail become
accessible to the new Co-Sysop.  Users should also know whom has sufficient
access to read anonymous posts.  Sysops and Co-Sysops should review the
system logs regularly, and any Co-Sysop shown to have entered E-mail or the
User Editor without some board purpose should immediately have his or her
security level permanently cut to that of an ordinary user.
