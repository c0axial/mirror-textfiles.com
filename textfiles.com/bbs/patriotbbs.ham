Hoping to start operation 04/04/92 with a Home-Built IBM XT 10MHz Clone  and
30 MB Hard Disk.   We will add on to the system as money  becomes available.
New  users are welcome and encouraged to  upload  and download with  certain
restrictions.  There is no charge for those that are willing to work with  a
small  but growing system.   To become a Full-Line User,   you are asked  to
meet a $10.00 Semiannual Charge.   Please  fill out an application for  your
security  upgrade from New User to Associate User.  We are using  a  Wildcat
Test Drive and as soon as the money starts to come in,   we are planning  to
upgrade to at least  Single-Line  with Doors  & Goodies.  I am also planning
to build at least  a  386/33  or 486/40 with a minimum of 100MB on-line  and
later  CD-ROM.   I would  like to  be able to incorporate multi-user  MODEMs
and software at  a  later date.  If you happen to be rich and would like  to
join as a life member, we would only require $100.00.
These areas are available on this system:
