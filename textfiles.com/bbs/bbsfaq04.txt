                               OS/2 Q&A
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- WHAT IS OS/2?
================
Os/2 is a preemptive, multitasking operating system with a windowing,
grapihcal interface developed and distributed by IBM. The current 
version is 2.1.


- WHY NOT JUST DOS?
===================
In most cases, a BBS needs a multtiasking operating system to run
multinode. The major contenders for this functionality are Desqview, 
Windows, and OS/2. Desqview runs on top of DOS and therefore carries 
the extra overhead. Windows, while also running on top of DOS, is not
a true preemptive, operating system.


- WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF OS/2 AS A BBS?
=============================================
OS/2 does not run on top of DOS, and is a preemptive, multitasking
operating system. It not only runs OS/2 BBS systems, but also 
multitasks DOS-based BBS systems.


- WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF OS/2 AS A BBS?
=================================================
It is a full operating system. It is not dedicated to the BBS
processes. The BBS proecsses are competing with operating system 
processes.


- WHAT BBS SOFTWARE RUNS IN OS/2?
==================================
Most DOS-based BBS systems will run in a OS/2 DOS shell. A few other
developers have built special versions of their BBS systems, optimized 
to run in OS/2's DOS shell. A still smaller number of BBS systems are
written specifically for OS/2.

                     NETWORKING YOUR  PC BBS 
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- INTRODUCTION
==============
     This section (Networking you PC BBS) is designed to give the
basics on how to make a networked BBS. There are a lot of FAQ's out
there that can be more helpful than what can be written here, 
especially with the networking and using individual BBS software, 
but this will give you a place to work from.

- WHAT IS A NETWORK?
======================
     A networked BBS is one that has multiple computers
'hardwired' through some non-phone connection to each other, and
they can send information to each other. If this is in a
corporate environment, there might be just one computer with
modems, with not only people calling in, but calling out as well,
for telecommuting and the like. For most private use BBS's out
there, however, all the machines on the network have modems on
them taking calls. We'll look mainly at that aspect.

- WHAT DO I NEED FOR A NETWORK?
=================================
     Assuming that your BBS software can handle multiple
computers with multiple modems, all you need to make a network is
an Network Interface Card (NIC), the wires going to each
computer, the 'topology' of the network, and a Network Operating
System (NOS).

- THE TOPOLOGY
=================
     This is a fancy term for how the wiring will be laid. This
is mainly dependent on the wiring used. There's two main types:
The Bus and the Star.

- HOP ON THE BUS
==================
     The bus is a series connection of computers. One to the
other to the other to the other, with resistors at the end of the
cable to tell the network you've hit the edge. It's probably the
cheapest way to get into networking. However, if you are worried
about one node (a computer on the network) going down, this is a
bad way to go. The wire breaks in any way, shape or form, and the
whole net comes crashing down.

- HITCH YOUR DREAMS TO A STAR
================================
     The other way to connect them is in a star configuration.
All computers talking to one central hub. It's more expensive
because you have to buy that hub. That costs from about $150 to
easily over $1000. Unless this network will also support a few
hundred other users, stick with the cheap, non-SNMP, non
manageable hubs.

- THE NIC
===========
     This is a card that will be installed into the computer and
is dedicated to network transmission. There are a lot of them out
there. You can easily pay from $30 to over $400. However,
sometimes, you do get what you pay for. It is suggested to find a 
big company that will stand behind their product, both with driver
updates and tech support when things don't work. You can do 3Com, 
Intel, Allied Telesis, SMC, Eagle, or others.

- THE NOS & NETWORK TYPE
=============================
     Now this one is a very good problem. A lot of people are
looking into this, not just for a BBS setup but for a variety of
other applications too. The following is a list and brief description
of some of the more popular networking software.

- NOVELL NETWARE
=================
     Netware, by Novell, has to be by far the most popular NOS. 
Alot of companies run Netware, and there's all sorts of addons and 
support for it. It's a good, reliable, robust operating system. 
There's version 3.x and 4.x, with 3.x being more for small to medium
companies and 4.x for Wide Area Networks and large companies. You'll
be looking (as of 1 July 1994) at Netware 3.12 for your setup. 
3.11 is also acceptable. Now, there's one major drawback to Netware:
It has to be installed on one dedicated server. Dedicated means
you can't do anything else with that machine but run it as a
server. Netware 3.12 will run on a 386. 

- LANTASTIC
=============
     Lantastic, by Artisoft, is a peer-to-peer NOS. What does
that mean to you? No dedicated server machine. So you don't have
all sorts of money tied up in a machine that does nothing but
manage your network. Before Windows for WorkGroups came along,
this was the ONLY reliable and cheap peer-to-peer setup. It still
is extremely popular, for one very important reason: it runs in
DOS. Windows for WorkGroups is great as long as you're in
Windows. As of 1 July 1994, Lantastic 6.0 has just hit the streets,
and the price is very reasonable.

- Windows for WorkGroups
===========================
     As mentioned in the Lantastic section, this is Windows-
only. 

- The New Kid In Town: CoActive
==================================
     I'll quickly glance over CoActive, because there's one major
problem with it: speed. The idea is simple enough: Give everyone
an adapter to hang off the parallel port of your computer, run
regular phone line between the machines, and run a peer to peer
network with the greatest of ease. Each node takes about 10
mintues to set up, and that's pretty darn good. The price makes
it even more attractive. However, it is not recommended if speed
is a factor, it has an extremely slow transfer rate. It runs as a
serial port, so the max it can do is 115K/second, where standard
Ethernet pulls about 10 times that. If you have small files, or
run a message-only board, you could get away with CoActive, but
for anyone else it is not recommended.


- EtherWave
=============
     This is another new one, very fresh on the market. It's from
Farallon, and it's called Etherwave. Main claim to fame: You can
'daisy chain' machines on Ethernet. big problem: The ones near
the end of the chain are very slow, and you still need a NOS to
run this thing. 

- How does all this hardware help me?
=======================================
     Well, suddenly you can share your BBS files over your whole
setup. In the Netware setup, you have one central location for
all your files, for easy backup and maintenance options. In 3.12,
you can hang a CDROM or two off the server, to give even more
storage capability and value to your BBS. Suddenly, your nodes
can be 'light' nodes, doing nothing but answering calls, with an
80 MB or so HD, and all the file storage is kept on the server.
For the Peer-to-peer, each machine can have one special section
for each file area, like games or utilities, and all the other
people look to that area for the files. Still easy to maintain.
Also, a network is a heck of a lot faster than standard serial
ports, and easier to send big files from one machine to the
other.

                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=========================
- What is RIPScript?
=========================
RIPscript graphics are EGA quality graphics that are displayed over
the modem.  The BBS sends special codes which are interpreted by a
special term program and draws the screen for the user.  The results
can be impressive.  While there are other graphic protocols, such as
NAPLPS and ROBO/FX, which are better than RIP (supporting VGA and 
better resolutions), RIP is the only one which can be made with 
simple ASCII sequences.  This is good, since when you understand 
which codes do what (they are confusing), you can actually edit the
screens in any text editor (although you won't see the picture, just
the codes).  There are a bunch of shareware programs which give you
the power to draw your own RIP screens, using lines, circles, boxes,
fonts, and other cool stuff.  Several BBS programs also have special
support for RIP, such as (but not limited to) Renegade, WildCat, and
Synchronet.  Other BBS authors are planning to RIP-enable their
systems soon.

===============================
- What is a fossil driver?
===============================
Fossil drivers were invented in the mid 80's, when not every modem 
and/or serial device was 100% compatible.  Fossils made sure that 
your program could talk to your modem, regardless of how oddball the
modem.  It does this by intercepting signals from the program, and
converting them into something the modem can understand.  These days,
fortunately, the problems are much less severe.  Fossils are used 
mostly because a BBS program that supports them doesn't have to be
constantly updated to handle new speeds or protocols, just the fossil.  
 
The word "fossil" is actually an acronym for "Fido-Opus-Seadog
Standard Interface Layer". 

Where can I download a fossil driver?
---------------------------------------
FTP: gallifrey.ucs.uoknor.edu, in /pub/bbs/msdos/fossil

The following available to download,
- Fossil driver BNU v1.70 
- X00 fossil, version 1.50
- A program called Video Fossil v1.10, which is needed if you want to
  run Binkley Term with colors.

=========================================================
- What do I need to offer fax services to my users?
========================================================
Below is a list of BBS software programs that offer fax 
features while running your BBS. Please refer to the proper 
section of this FAQ where the BBS software is explained in 
detail.

- Procomm Plus for Windows v2.0
  (Refer to chapter 2 - under the topic, "What s Ghost BBS")
- FirstClass BBS
  (Refer to chapter 3 for further details about FirstClass)
- PCBoard (Version 15.1)
  (please see section 2.03 for more information about PCBoard)
- Remote Access
  (Refer to chapter 2)

NOTE: Several BBS packages support fax capabilities. Check with the
software vendor/author first.

BGFAX 1.09
------------
BGFAX allows SYSOPs to accept faxes on their BBS line.  BGFAX can
also send faxes.  (While BGFAX was originally designed just for
sysops, it can also be used by Mr. Joe User who hates TSR based fax
programs.)

BGFAX is a tool designed for use with any Class 2 compliant fax
modem.  The fax modem must also support fully functional ADAPTIVE
ANSWERING.

Common Class 2 fax modems include the Supra, Practical Peripherials
(may require purchase of a newer ROM revision if you are using an
older model), Zoom, etc.

BGFAX also directly supports ZyXEL fax mode.  (AT#B1+FCLASS=6).

BGFAX will not function with Class 1 only fax modems.  Common
Class 1 only fax modems include all non-v.32 turbo USR fax modems,
Digicom Scouts, the AT&T Dataport, and the SupraLC.

BGFAX can be used in FOUR distinct modes.

FRONTEND MODE ... BGFAX will answer the telephone line ITSELF,
                  handle events, pass data calls to a front end
                  compatible BBS, and take fax calls.

REAR END MODE ... BGFAX will be called from another program when
                  an incoming fax is detected.  FidoNet sysops
                  using front end mailers such as FrontDoor,
                  Intermail, D'Bridge, Dutchie, etc. are required
                  to use this mode.  The mailer must support the
                  ability to exit to BGFAX when a fax is coming.

SEND MODE ....... BGFAX has the ability to send faxes to another
                  fax machine.  (At this time, the file to be sent
                  must already be in converted fax format.)

INITIALIZATION .. BGFAX will only initialize the modem, and then
                  quit.  This mode is provided for people who need
                  to use BGFAX in rear end mode, but their Fido
                  mailer (or BBS software) will not allow the long
                  initialization strings required for fax usage.

BBS DOORS 
===========

- What is a BBS door?
---------------------------
Loosely put, a door, as the name implies, is a gateway outside the BBS
software. Doors can be anything, games, database applications, credit
card registration systems, just about anything. Most doors are run by
the BBS itself or by a batch file outside the BBS. The door program
itself interfaces with the communications and the modem, and takes
over from the BBS software after it unloads.
 
- What doors are available?
-----------------------------------
Doors are so numerous that this question is hard to answer. If you 
have a purpose in mind, you can generally find a door to suit it.
 
- How do I install a door?
------------------------------
Say you just found the perfect game you want to add to your BBS, but
you're unsure on how to configure it. This is a general set of steps 
to follow to configure most door programs out there:
 
1. Install the program. Some programs are compressed, needing 
uncompression programs such as PKUnzip, ARJ, etc. Others have their 
own installation software, which may or may not uncompress it. Others
have a set of instructions in a file like READ.ME, READTHIS.1ST, 
README.NOW, etc. Make sure to follow the instructions as they are 
written, and try not to shortcut it unless you know what you are
doing.
 
2. Doors usually have a configuration program or file containing 
various options. While most doors have options of their own, here are
a few setup options and guidelines that are fairly common:

    a. DROP FILE NAME/TYPE: This file is the file that the door 
       software gets most of its information from. From this file, 
       the door can get the user name, speed, location, and many more
       items, some BBS dependant. In order for a door program to be
       supported, your BBS usually must support a similar drop file
       type. For instance, PCBoard, which supports it's own 
       PCBOARD.SYS file and a generic file called DOOR.SYS, could only
       be used with door programs that can use one of these two files.
       Here are some sample BBS packages and their drop files:

      ------------------------------ 
       BBS            Drop File(s)
      ------------------------------
 
       WWIV           CHAIN.TXT
       PCBoard        PCBOARD.SYS, DOOR.SYS
       RBBS           DORINFO1.DEF
       RyBBS          CURRUSER.BBS
       WildCat!       CALLINFO.BBS
 
There are some shareware programs that will translate door drop files 
into (probably) a format readable by your BBS. Check your local BBS's
for such converters. After you know what drop file to use, configure
the door to use it, as said in the docs. NOTE: Some drop files, 
depending on the BBS system, may also include the below configuration
options, in which case you may not have to configure for them.
 
     b. COM PORT: The COM port the BBS is on. If you are running more
        than two lines, you may have trouble with this DOOR program
        unless it has controls over options b and c. This is because
        after going past two lines, you cannot assign standard COM 
        port designations to each line. (See section on Multi-line
        door setups)
 
     c. IRQ - This is the Interrupt the communications port is on. If
        you are running one or two lines, you should select the 
        default choice, or leave this option out, unless your serial
        board is oddly configured. For multi-line systems, you should
        choose the IRQ of the port it's on. (See section on Multi-line
        door setups)
 
     d. Base Address - This is the base address of the communications
        port. As with IRQ, unless running a multi-line system or an 
        abnormal serial card, keep the defaults.
 
If the door does not have defaults, the standard values for these are:
- COM1, COM3: IRQ - 4 Base Address - 3f8
- COM2, COM4: IRQ - 3 Base Address - 2f8
 
     e. Other modem/hardware information - Some doors will ask for 
        various other information, such as whether to use hardware or 
        software handshaking. Most of this should be set the same as 
        the BBS is. If you are unsure, check the documentation.
 
     f. A note about VBRUN: Some doors that are written in basic need
        a utility called VBRUN in order to execute. This utility is
        BASIC's runtime module, and is usually not included in the
        door package. If, during testing, the door wants the location
        of a runtime module, this is what you need to look for. Most
        BBS's should have a copy, or know where to find one.
 
After these are configured, various items about the door itself must
be configured. For a game, it may be the number of turns per day, for
a credit card system what types of cards are supported, etc. Configure
these as you wish.

3. Test the door in local mode, if it is has such an option. Most 
doors have a command line switch, or some other way of runing the door
in 'local' mode. Local mode allows you to use the door without a 
modem/serial line attached, and is usually good for testing. The 
purpose of testing ahead of time before adding it to the BBS is to 
make sure the the door itself is properly configured. Testing in local
mode will pick up errors such as bad/missing filenames, improper 
configuration files, etc.
 
4. Install on the BBS itself - In all cases, check the documentation
of the BBS software you have selected for proper configuration. Most
BBS's do it one of two ways: 
 
     (1) The door is run by the BBS itself. In this case, you need to 
         configure the BBS software, which will usually have a set of 
         configuration options relating to doors. When it asks you for
         the path to execute the door, input the path of the 
         executable/batch file for the door. NOTE: Doors run on BBS's
         of this type may have problems with memory usage. For this 
         reason, some BBS's have a special option to let you 
         'minimize' the memory usage. If you're experiencing memory 
         problems, use this option.
 
     (2) The door is run outside the BBS in another batch file. In 
         this case, an sample external batch is usually included with 
         the BBS package. Most of these look similar to this:
          
          :cycle
          RunBBS                   ; Run the BBS program
          
          if errorlevel 50 goto DOOR_A
          if errorlevel 40 goto DOOR_B
          if errorlevel 30 goto DOOR_C
          if errorlevel 20 goto end     ; test for each
 
          :DOOR_A
          tw2002                   ; Run Trade Wars, a game
          goto cycle               ; go back to the bbs
 
      
          :DOOR_B
          vote
          goto cycle               ; vote and return
 
          :DOOR_C
          ccard
          goto cycle               ; get a credit card, return
 
          :end                     ; end it off.
 
In this manner, when the BBS exits, depending on the DOS errorlevel 
the batch file will execute a myriad of different programs. Some BBS's
have preset errorlevels, and such BBS packages, like SpitFire, should 
have sample batch files with these presets. Others have configuration 
options to let you change the errorlevels, in which case you might 
have to create your own, personal batch file. The above should work
for most BBS's of the batch file type. If you change this, remember 
that the 'if errorlevel' calls MUST be in descending order, because 
of the nature of the call.
 
After the door itself is configured, you may have to add a menu entry 
or some other way of accessing it. Make sure, if sure BBS is up and 
running at the time, with non-sysop callers calling in, that the menu
entry is set at sysop security level to prevent others from trying a 
potentially faulty door.
 
5. Test it online - This is a MUST. If you have another line, call 
into your BBS and test the door online, or have a friend do it if you 
don't have another line/modem to spare. If the door fails to operate, 
try tweaking the settings some, making sure that it has the same 
hardware/software setup as the BBS. If all goes well, you're ready to 
open it to the public. You can now change that sysop-only menu entry
to a normal one.
 
6. Open it to the public - Now it's ready to be released into the wide
world of BBS doors.
 
After following these guidelines, you should be able to install and 
configure most door softwares.
 
- Notes of Multi-line systems
-------------------------------
1. Multi-node systems, systems that use Windows, or DesqView, or OS/2,
etc., should be aware that not all door programs were meant to be 
running at the same time. For instance, the old version of Trade Wars,
a popular BBS game, could not have more than one node running it at 
one time. This is because of various restrictions that DOS, and the
door program itself, put on file sharing. The door program will 
usually say in the documentation whether it supports Multi-node
systems. If it does, follow the above configuration. If your BBS
system does not share its configuration files, you must configure 
it for each node, or some nodes will be missing it.
 
2. Internal Multitaskers. These BBSs, such as The Major BBS,
TBBS, Falken and more, do their multitasking internally,
instead of with something like DesqView or Windows. Such
BBS's may have an interface to use normal doors, but most
require you to use only option modules meant for their BBS,
since they didn't build it to multitask all kinds of
programs. Use your manual to install such software, since it
varies system to system.
 
- Notes on DOORWAY
--------------------
DOORWAY is a program that lets you run normal DOS programs
that do not support comm routines, as doors. There is an inherent
problem in this, though, because DOS programs are very finicky.
Several DOS programs use direct screen writes, and, while DOORWAY
supports these, can be very tricky. Graphics programs, obviously,
are not supported. Another problem with common DOS programs is
security. If the program offers anything like a shell to dos or a
command running option, you probably don't want to offer it,
unless you trust the people using it, or you found a way around.
To install DOORWAY, use the above instructions, but when it comes
to running the executable, run DOORWAY with its command line
instead. If in need, most BBSs will carry a copy of DOORWAY,
usually as DRWY____.ZIP or DOORWAY.ZIP.
