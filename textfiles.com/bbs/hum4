"SysOp. . . One more weasel. . . weasel. . . weasel."  
        --Anonymous weaselholic


Last week, I wrote about the female variety of the BBS weasel, the Trick
Peas.  The week before, I essayed on the even more common male BBS
weasel, oft times referred to as the HD.  This week, I'm going to touch
on an even more fearsome animal - the weaselholic.

A weaselholic is, by it's very definition, someone that is addicted to
weasels.  You know the type.  It's your average BBS nerd who, after
numerous involvements with BBS weasels (of either sex) seems to get
involved with them time and time again.  They can't say "No."  They
crave the BBS weasel, and their day isn't quite complete without at
least one run in with this telecommunications critter.

We all know that the BBS Weasel thrive on causing pain or annoyance.  By
contrast, the weaselholic thrives on *feeling* pain.  They enjoy being
used, and then thrown away, by BBS weasels.  If they don't have at least
one confrontation with a BBS weasel a day, their lives aren't complete. 

This addiction is caused by several things, not the least of which is a
lack of confidence.  When the BBS weasel pays attention to the
weaselholic, everything that the user in question knows about BBS
Weasels is thrown out the door.  "S/he's paying attention to me?"
Thinks the addict, forgetting all else.  "I need this attention.  I
crave this attention.  I *Want* this attention."

When all else fails - when the weaselholic doesn't have his calls
returned, when that attractive woman at the office snubs him, when his
girlfriend leaves him for the CompUsa(tm) technician. . . He can always
find a friend in the BBS Weasel.  A friend who will suck the memory out
of his very motherboard.  

Do you know a weaselholic?  Are *You* a weaselholic?  Fear not, you are
not alone.  Now that you know that the disease exists - and, yes, it
*Is* a disease - you can fight it.

When you're approached by a BBS Weasel, fight the temptation to give in.
Resist the urge to type your very most inner secrets to that voiceless
entity across the screen.  Be strong!

These 12 steps will help you:

     1.  Admit that you're powerless over the effects of the
         BBS Weasel's electronically transmitted phermones
     2.  Believe in a power greater than your own (The SysOp)
     3.  Make a decision to turn over your will to the care 
         of the SysOp as you understand Him.
     4.  Make a searching and complete inventory of all of your
         GIFs.
     5.  Admit to your SysOp and a human being (for SysOps are
         not exactly human) the nature of your wrongs.
     6.  Be entirely ready to have the SysOp remove all 
         defects from your Connex file.
     7.  Humbly ask the SysOp to remove your access to the 
         Wildside and Legends games. 
     8.  Make a list of all the people you've ignored in your
         attempts to chat with BBS weasels and become willing
         to make amends to them all.
     9.  Make direct amends to these people except for when 
         to do so would cause you (or them) to lose their
         access or get the FBI involved.
    10.  Continue to inventory your GIFs, and delete all the
         ones showing full frontal nudity or intercourse with
         small farm animals.
    11.  Seek power through chats and open forum discussion to 
         improve your contact with the SysOp as you understand
         him, requesting only knowledge of His will for you
         and the access and the technical knowledge to carry
         that out.
    12.  Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these
         steps, try to post the message on as many nets as 
         possible and to practice these principles in all 
         your telecommunication interactions.


Once you've completed these 12 steps, your life should be weasel-free.
Always be wary, though; just one flirt with the nefarious BBS Weasel
can take you back into the hell from which you've just escaped.
Remember - you're never cured, just better.  

Until next week, say your affirmations ("I am a good person.  I will be
free from weasels.") chant your mantras, and keep those anti-glare
screens securely fastened.  Cyl8r, all.   


Next week:  Something completely different.
