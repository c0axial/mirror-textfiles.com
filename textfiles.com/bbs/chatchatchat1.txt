Hello?

Sorry about that, we kept missing eachother. How are You?

Pretty good thanks, yep sometimes it can be confusing when both people
are set to "notify"... I don't usually private chat often (I dunno
why) mainly stick to open forum..

That's cool  open forum is really entertaining, there aren't alot
of people around there now though:)

True.. sometimes it definitely gets boring in there.. that's when
I start doing funky things like doing macros :) hehehe... anyways
     *** Ren 411 just arrived - line 6 ***
what's new...

Not much, misses the wedding though..haha:)
     *** PRIMEalien[OD] 3714 just arrived - line 7 ***
     *** Dave Alan 2829 just arrived - line 11 ***

misses the wedding?

Missed!

oh.. who's wedding?

Ours!

OOOHHHH :) heheheh.. well... we'll have to have another ceremony
then :0
     *** Wayne Nel 2520 just arrived - line 6 ***

I think so, somewhere outdoors this time though, if it ever stops
raining!:)

really.. heh.. I actually laid out in the sun for awhile today..
knew it was too good to last (no I'm not really a pessimist, but
this is Seattle ya know :)

No pessimism(oh well) allowed!!! I love the sun, I love the rain,
     *** Asteroth 3673 just arrived - line 10 ***
it's all weather!1

nyeh rain can be OK I guess.. I'm not a terribly big fan, I prefer
blue skies... it isn't so much the rain around here is it's constantly
overcast.. that gets depressing (but how did we get on this subject
anyway :) hehehe

It came from the outdoor wedding theme!:)
     *** Soothsayer (c) 1993. 2090 just arrived - line 5 ***

     *** Viper 1026 just arrived - line 20 ***
from friday I guess it is

I heard (read) about that....maybe...I dunno...I've never been to
one before...hummm. It's true I don't know you, but it's fun anyway.....Ba

b     *** Scamp 974 just arrived - line 15 ***
e a lean mean machine by summer :) heheh... well the gt's are kinda
fun actually.. some people call em "geekfests" but they're not that
bad..... fun to see a lot of people you know well but have never
actually seen.. kinda bizarre...

Sounds like it,  I can hardly imagine....GeekFest huh....sounds cool,
I have never really met a geek I don't think, or maybe I'm so much
of one I don't notice (not likely)....more like there just aren't
any geeks.....:)

well I've met a few.. but overall it's more just a stereotype, and
stereotypes are never really true.. I guess it's just cause of all
t     *** butterfly 480 just arrived - line 9 ***
he "computer" people.. which is silly in 1993, I don't think of
computer users as geeks... that was back in the 50's or something
maybe.. :)

Good point....So....hummm...it is different talking one on one isn't
it, not as likely to be as bold!  :)

well that's true for me personally, I am a lot mellower chatting

     *** Crash Victim 3172 just arrived - line 21 ***
why, I'm a pretty good typist.. but)... I definitely am a lot mellower..
so DRAW ME OUT!! :) hehehe

Draw you out!! Like on paper..hehehe
     *** SweetCheeks 837 just arrived - line 23 ***

YEAH you got it:) (no) ahem... hmm.... so what should I be "bold"
     *** Jayjay 2780 just arrived - line 27 ***
     *** NIRVANA 787 just arrived - line 30 ***
about.. give me a hint or 2 ;)
     *** HEDONIST 2802 just arrived - line 31 ***

I wasn't refering to you exactly, I was talking about everyone (almost
everyone) that I've chatted with both on open forum and privately,
it seems to be universal, like real people one on one vs. at a party...ya
     *** ARIES 612 just arrived - line 23 *** <New User>
know what I mean?
     *** Martha 2556 just arrived - line 5 ***

Yep.. makes sense.. I do private chats so rarely tho I only know
about myself, and I am definitely less bold in private chat... in
fact occasionally makes me nervous to private chat when I not in
the mood for it (don't get me wrong I feel great at the moment :)
     *** kat 2429 just arrived - line 32 ***

you are so cute!!! Sound pretty sincere too, although yu can't really
tell over a computer screen!! :)

well I tend to be fairly honest I guess... not an easy quality to
find in people (hehe that sounded like I was bragging oops ;).. well
     *** miki 2077 just arrived - line 7 ***
thanks for saying I'm cute.. :0

I am honest too, about everything, not always bold but honest, I
have to take people's feelings into consideration, but...blah..blah...bori
ng stuff...I don't find it much....but occasionaly.....(smile, sigh)
     *** moonchild 2357 just arrived - line 5 ***
:)

well that's cool... what is boring stuff.. don't quitte know what
you were referring to... hmm.. well anyways.. next topic? :p

what does :p mean? and I was refering to going on and on about honesty!
     *** Harper 442 just arrived - line 14 *** <New User>

oh.. naah that's not boring.. unless you went on and on and ON and
on and on and on and on... :) hehehe... and :p is a pair of eyes
with a tongue sticking out.. look at sideways like the :) smile.

That's really cool, I DID NOT KNOW THAT (saturday night live thing)
