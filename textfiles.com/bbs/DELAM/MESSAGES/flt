If anyone is interested in FairLighT H/P drop me some email and let me know.
It's basically an H/P group that is associated with FLT, the top pirate group
in the scene.  We really need card hackers (at&t, spring, mci, etc) but are
looking for vmb hackers, unix, internet, sys75, etc etc.  You will get leech
access on all FLT boards & your handle in all FLT releases.  If you're
interested let me know..
