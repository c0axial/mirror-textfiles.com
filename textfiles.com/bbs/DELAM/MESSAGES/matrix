the best book about the internet... The Matrix by John S. Quarterman.  Talks
about all the countries that are hooked up, all the links to other networks,
etc.  The world traveller's guide to internet it should be called.  Would you
like to know the locations of the five supercomputer networks in this country?
 Read the book!  I highly reccomend it.
