The MPE/XL systems you were asking about are at 738.7038, 7041, 7039 & 7047.

The Meridian system is at 7070, and a valid box on that system is 6060 and
6162, passwords on both are same as box number.

Some of the accounts on the HP-3000 system are datacoll/feelgood,
fs/patience, etcetc. They still work.
