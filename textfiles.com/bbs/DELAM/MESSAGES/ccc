missing hehe... ok:
The CCC has his DECENTRAL in Hamburg:
Chaos Computer Club

ok so far: and Terra quitted as head of CCC e.V. and Steffen W. was the head
before Terra but he quitted too.. and now well i am not quite sure how it is
now coz it is fuckin unimportant! and The CCC is not mainly based in Hannover
it IS based in HAMBURG! and our MAG is the DATENSCHLEUDER (written in German)
which ya can order at the add. above... we also got a bbs at
