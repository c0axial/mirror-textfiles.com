Also,  I dont know what alot of the VMB systems sound like.  Yeah, ASPEN and 
shit, but there are alot of them.  I had this idea of sampling alot of 
different systems and sounds...   Fone shit..   It sounds like a good idea, if 
anyone with a soundblaster could DL the soundfile and actually HEAR what 
things sound like...  I dunno, I thought it was a good idea..

The watson board is/was made by a company called Natural Microsystems... not 
too popular any more.. company mostly makes big-scale ISDN/T1 stuff now (from 
what I've heard)
