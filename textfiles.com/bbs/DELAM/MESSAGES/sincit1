Yeah, I know... But what do ya expect ? The only Belgian Board with an H/P
Area, and only a few people are interested in it (there are lots of
kodez-kiddiez looking for kardzzz, but since they don't contribute....
they're not allowed there...). And another problem is that two quite active
hackers (Trap Zero and Donald) who where there seem to have disappeared, I've
been trying to contact them for about 6 weeks now, normally there lines are
constantly busy, but I call there allmost every day, and not busy, I leave a
message at T0's answering machine, and get no answer back,..... WEIRD I'd
say...  And the strange thing is that the last time I talked to Donald he
said to me something about going to the US, and telling me about something
VERY nice later on (he didn't have much time then).... Last time I talked to
T0 he wanted to know of Donald allready told me about 'it'..... SO I REALLY
want to know what those 2 have been or are doing.....
Ohwell... When calling from the US, Sin City probably isn't worth the call at
the moment...
