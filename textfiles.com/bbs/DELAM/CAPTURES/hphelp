PARAMETERS

commandname         Any MPE V/E or user-defined command (UDC), including
                    its parameter list. The prompting colon may be
                    omitted.

sessionname         An arbitrary name used in conjunction with
                    <username> and <acctname> to form a fully qualified
                    session identity.  This name must contain from one
                    to eight alphanumeric characters, beginning with an
                    alphabetic character. The default is that no session
                    name is assigned.

username            The user name, established by the account manager,
                    that allows you to logon into this account. The name
                    must contain from one to eight alphanumeric
                    characters, beginning with an alphabetic character.

userpass            The user password, optionally assigned by the
                    account manager.  This password must contain from
                    one to eight alphanumeric characters, beginning with
                    one to eight alphanumeric characters, beginning with
                    an alphabetic character. A slash (/) must precede
                    the <userpass> parameter.

acctname            The account name as established by the system
                    manager.  This name must contain from one to eight
                    alphanumeric characters, beginning with an
                    alphabetic character. A period (.) must precede the
                    <acctname> parameter.

acctpass            The account password, optionally assigned by the
                    account manager.  This password must contain from
                    one to eight alphanumeric characters, beginning with
                    an alphabetic character. A slash (/) must precede
                    the <acctpass> parameter.

groupname           The group name to be used for the local file domain
                    and the CPU time charges, as established by the
                    account manager.  It must contain from one to eight
                    alphanumeric chara
                    alphabetic character.  The default is your home
                    group, if one is assigned.  The parameter is
                    required if a home group has not been assigned.

grouppass           The group password, optionally assigned by the
                    account manager.  This password must contain from
                    one to eight alphanumeric characters, beginning with
                    an alphabetic character. Yoõ vo not need to enter
                    the <grouppass> parameter when you logon to your
                    home group.  However, if you request a logon group
                    that has been assigned a password, you must supply
                    the password when you logon to that group. A slash
                    (/) must precede the <grouppass> parameter.

termtype            Defines the terminal type. The <termtype> parameter
                    is the name of the file containing the desired
                    characteristics for the terminal. The default value
                    for<termtype>, a number from 0 to 22, is assigned by
                    the system supervisor during system configuration.
                    If your terminal is not of the default <termtype>,
                    you must supply this parameter to ensure correct
                    terminal input and output.

                    The <termtype> file may not have a lockword or
                    reside on a private volume.

                    The workstation configurator utility allows you to
                    create your own     <termtype> files.  You may
                    specify the following characteristics of the
                    terminal: data flow control, block mode, read
                    trigger, special characteristics, echo, line feed,
                    parity, and printer control.  You are then
                    responsible for the proper and efficient operation
                    of the device controlled by this file.

                    If you omit group and/or account names, the logon
                    group and/or account name is substituted.  For more
                    information on terminal types, refer to appendix A,
                    "Terminals Supported by MPE V/E", the Fundamental
                    Communications Handbook (5957-4634) and the
                    Workstation Configurator Reference Manual (30239-
                    90001).

cpusecs             The maximum CPU time that your session can use,
                    entered in seconds.  When this limit is reached, the
                    session is aborted.  It may be any value from 1 to
                    entered in seconds.  When this limit is reached, the
                    session is aborted.  It may be any value from 1 to
                    32767, provided that it does not exceed the limit
                    imposed by the system or account manager. To specify
                    no limit, type a question mark (?) or UNLIM, or omit
                    this parameter.  The default is no limit.

BS,CS,DS, or ES     The priority queue that the command interpreter (CI)
                    uses for executing your session. It is also the
                    default priority queue for all programs executed
                    within the session.  BS is the highest priority, ES
                    is the lowest, and the default is CS.  If you
                    specify a priority exceeding that permitted for your
                    account or user name, MPE V/E assigns the highest
                    priority possible below BS.

IMPORTANT NOTE:

Use care in assigning the BS priority, because processes in this
priority class may lock out other processes (MPE V/E uses the BS queue).

                    DS and ES are intended primarily for batch jobs.
                    Their use for sessions may produce less than optimum
                    performance, and is generally discouraged.

                    For guidelines on the use of the priority queue,
                    refer to the TUNE command in the MPE V System
                    Operation and Resource Management Reference Manual
                    (32033-90005).


inputpriority       Determines the input priority of the job or
or HIPRI            session.  It may be a value from 1 (lowest
                    priority) to 13 (highest priority).  The default is
                    8. If you supply a value less than or equal to the
                    current jobfence as set by the system operator, or
                    if the jobfence is equal to or greater than the
                    default <inputpriority>, the session is denied
                    access.

                    You can use the ;HIPRI option to override the system
                    jobfence or to override the session limit.  If you
                    want to override the jobfence, the system first
                    checks to see whether you have system manager (SM)
                    checks to see whether you have system manager (SM)
                    or system supervisor (OP) capability. If you have
                    either one, you are logged on, and your ;INPRI
                    de<Álts to the system's jobfence and execution
                    limit. If you do not have either capability, you
                    receive the following warning:

                    MUST HAVE "SM" OR "OP" CAP. TO SPECIFY HIPRI,
                    MAXIMUM INPRI OF 13 IS USED (CIWARN 1460)

                    Despite this warning, the system still allows you to
                    logon if your default input priority, which is 8,
                    exceeds the jobfence. If the jobfence exceeds your
                    input priority, you cannot logon unless you have SM
                    or OP capability.

USE

     If you press [BREAK] during the output of the logon message,    the

     being executed, and the command is breakable, you interrupt its
     execution.  Any optional logon UDC that is not a program is not
     breakable, and its execution is   forced during logon.

OPERATION

     This command initiates a session and immediately executes the
     command in parentheses.  Once this command or subsystem is
     executing, all input, output, BREAK capabilities, and prompts
     operate as described in the command or subsystem instructions.
     After the execution of the command or subsystem is completed,
     normally or through an abort, a logoff is performed automatically.

     This command has the following limitations:
