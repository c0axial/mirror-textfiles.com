If you're a curious poker trying your luck at system cracking, you've
come to the wrong place. First of all, since this system is connected
to the outside world in as many ways as we can think of, we don't keep
any company confidential information on it. Second, we take computer
security very seriously. All bad login/password combinations attempted
on this system are logged, and there have been various other unique
modifications made to this system to improve its security.

If you have a Macintosh computer then you may wish to use the graphical user
interface that can be found in "News". You can use the mail system on
FirstClass to send a message to the "Administrator".
