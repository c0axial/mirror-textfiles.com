public domain, but anything that works.  Yea, yea I've been using
AFE and transferring to a 486 at work to use PKUNZIP, but that's getting

I know that Macintosh is probably a bad work on this board, but if anybody 
else out there is a mac user, we all need to communicate on how to navigate 
these bizarre, counter-intuitive boards.  For example, a guy just asked a few 
msgs back about utilities to unpack Arc and Zip files on the Mac.  Yes, there 
are such files, but they are sometimes tough to find.  E-mail me if you're 
interested.

  You should try thrift store that is about the only place you are going to 
find one of those... also thrift stores will sell BETA/VCR cams at like 50 
dollars... though the tocamera has the asthetic purposes try a beta cam it has 
better quality that VCR and is the standard in MOST countries EXCEPT the US.

Was REALLY bad..  next time, get it reviewed by the people on alt.drugs
and it might turn out better..

One of my favorite lines from that was, to paraphrase, 'Drink alcohol
from mouthwash!'  -thats typically wood alcohol, which is poisonous and
required by fed legislation to be put in it, because its poisonous..

Anyway, when I read the issue, I was wondering if the LOL was somehow
connected with the feds, there being so much bogus information like the
above in it..  Kindof like anouther anarchist cookbook, that immortal
tomb of wrong information that seems to be copied by lamers into text files
every year..

If Swash has really changed, he should get a new handle and start a new group.

But I don't think he or the other members know anything that hasn't been 
written about yet.  And everything they do write about is pathetic.  PRIMENET? 
haha.  The Tymnet and Telenet files were pathetic.

Everyone should get a copy of Doctor Disector's Intro to PSNs.  It's about ten 
times better than any file LOL could write.

What kind of equipment did that guy named timmy t have to record his album on?
I heard it was like a $200.00 system.

I want to record some stuff i need a drum machine or something to generate
beats, bass etc and maybe a cheap keyboard. Then i need something to record the
sounds like a tape deck, and maybe a cd player that has the ability to do some
samples, loops and section repeats. I have seen them for around $250.00.

Does anyone know of a cheap way to be able to make a tape for release as a demo
or regular sales? Or do you know who i can talk to about this?

well lets get it out the open right now... who here listens to industrial or

listen to just about anything with a beat and was put together well.    
    
   Anyone here heard the new Thrill Kill Kult yet? I must say I was quite 
happy with it... very different much more like the Bomb Gang Girls (there 
back-up vocalists) and I would even say it was the BBG just under the TKK name.

Louisville sucks when it comes to modern music. You can drive down the street
and still hear people playing the beastie boyz first tape like it was something
to be proud of. If you asked that question to anyone in town here they would
say, "Uh i dunno???"

with the 'best price'...a friend of mine got a killer price on a Blaupunkt CD 
(for car) and now it skips like crazy, won't eject the cartridge, and the 
radio is slowly going out.  On the other hand, my Berlin is still going great 
(Cassette, but who cares, eh?) and gets probably the best reception out of any 
mobile unit.  I would rather go listen in my car than my home.

RE: I...

Well, I've been thinking about putting a really good system into an IROC. A 
note, although I want my system to play good with clean instrumental music, it 
must BOOM with bass because I like to blast rap through subwoofers. I've 
thought about getting my install done at Car Tunes in Jtown and maybe Ovation 
(by T.C.) As for where I'll get my stuff, I don't know. I heard about this new 
place in Portland, OR called the audio underground. They are sending me a 
catalog. They claim that after a $69 initiation fee, they'll give me a wide 
selection of stuff at the DEALER cost. Like 12" Fosgate Pros for $134 each. 
Prices like that. I am leery of this though because I called Fosgate and they 
said they are not an authorized dealer. I think it may be a get rich quick 
scam. What do you think? I'd appreciate you're advice. Also, what is the deal 
with isobarik boxes? E mail me if you don't want to publically disclose your 
identity and maybe I'll stop by at your stereo place. Where ya work? Thanks! 
Oh yeah, I think I'm getting amps by Soundstream, woofers by Fosgate, head by 
ALpine, and undecided on tweets and mids. Sound good?
