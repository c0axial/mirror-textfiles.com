I had hacked root on MIT's GNU system named Wombat.  The following shows
where I went into user tami directory and found tami was keeping tabs on the
MOD in capture files. some authentic #hack stuff from the days when the
LOD/MOD war was going.  This is a snippet of a huge capture where I was
rummaging around MIT's systems and hopped on IRC a few times myself.  Not
sure if this is of interest or not to you but I bet I have a bunch more.
this is just one disk of a few labeled "captures" LOL!
