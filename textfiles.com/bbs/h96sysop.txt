Dear SysOp,
 
    Thank you for your inquiring on the Hayes SysOp Program!  The Hayes SysOp
Program offers a very attractive full featured program for BBS System
Operators.  The Program includes special SysOp pricing for qualified SysOps to
purchase hardware directly from Hayes at up to 50% off retail price and 
software at up to 65% off retail price.
 
    The ONLINE WITH HAYES BBS (1-800-US-HAYES) is your toll-free source for
Hayes Technical Support.  This allows you full access to all the Technical notes
and bulletins within the Hayes File Library.  Once we receive your order for any
Hayes high speed modem you will be granted toll-free access to the SysOp's
Forum.  To preview the SysOp's Forum you may call on the toll line at
404-HI-MODEM (404-446-6336).  The SysOp's Forum contains a variety of SIGs with
files and information on most of the popular BBS software packages. Hayes
maintains close contact with many BBS software authors and other software
developers within the BBS community to insure full-functionality when used with
their communications products.
 
    The ULTRA 96 features full CCITT V.32 compliance for high speed connections
with any other manufacturer's modem that also supports V.32. The ULTRA 96 sells
to SysOps for $399.

    The ULTRA 144 features full CCITT v.32bis compliance for high speed
connections with any other manufacturer's modem that also supports v.32bis. The
ULTRA 144 sells to SysOps for $499.

    We also offer the OPTIMA 144 + FAX 144 under the sysop program.  This
modem leaves off some of the high-end features of the ULTRA family such
as support for X.25 and Express 96, but it does offer CCITT V.32bis modem
and CCITT V.17 fax compliance at a very competitive introductory SysOp
price of $299.  This is an introductory offer, so act fast.
 
Thank you for considering a Hayes modem for your BBS!

Advantages of Hayes SysOp Program
---------------------------------
Here are some of the things that make the Hayes SysOp Program the best
in the industry:

--Hayes does not require (or even request) that SysOps maintain an
  area or bulletin on their BBS for advertising or marketing by Hayes.

--Hayes does not require logon credit or even the identification of
  modem type.  (However, we think SysOps will be proud to display the
  use of Hayes modems).

--Hayes does not require written consent for a SysOp to sell their
  modem(s) if no longer providing a BBS or upgrading.

--Hayes does not penalize the warranty of a modem that has been sold
  by the SysOp when stopping operation or upgrading.

--Orders are processed very quickly.  SysOp applications are typically
  verified and processed within a week of receipt.  Additional orders
  do not require reverification, and can be placed at any time via
  Online With Hayes, phone or fax.

--Hayes accepts Visa and Mastercard as well as checks and money orders.

--Hayes SysOps receive full access to Online With Hayes, including SIGs
  and their file libraries via toll free 800 number.

--Hayes has provisions for new BBSes for those who cannot meet the 6
  month requirement.

--When purchasing a Hayes modem the SysOp receives full support and
  service from the best Customer Support organization in the modem
  business.
