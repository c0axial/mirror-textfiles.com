                              A High Speed Modem
                              ==================

Are you thinking of going to a High speed modem?

2400 bps can be very slow for transferring large files.
Modems advertised as 4800 are really only 2400 with data compression
such as MNP-5 or even just software data compression. There are now
some new 2400 BPS modems with V.42bis, which claim 9600 bps Thruput.
Don't be fooled. A 2400 bps modem with error correction will NOT be
significantly faster when transfering compressed files such as ZIPs.
An actual 9600 bps or faster modem will make a tremendous difference in
your transfer time. Most 9600 bps users never want to go back to 2400.
There is a lot of confusion and mis-information about 9600 bps and faster
modems. I wrote this to help clarify and point out the differences
between the different modems available IBM compatible machines.

If price is no object, the Best modem to get for BBS use is the new
USRobotics Dual Standard. It is a combination of the HST 14400 bps
modem and a V.32 9600 BPS modem all rolled into one modem.
The new version of the USR Dual Standard Modem also includes V.32bis,
which is a new 14400 bps standard, and also V.42 and V.42bis error
correction and data compression.
 
If price is an issue, (like it is to most people) then you may want to
consider a standard HST 14400 or a different brand if that is also too
expensive. But if you do not buy a USRobotics Modem, you will not be
able to hook up to a standard USR HST at over 2400 bps.

Other then USR, you could get a V.32 or compatable modem for about 25%
less then a standard HST, or you could get a 9600 bps Compucom Speedmodem
for a even less.

                           =======================
                           
Since new modem brands, models, and new prices are appearing constantly,
this documentation is going to need a lot of updating. Also some of the
Current Information may need corrections as well. You are welcome to make
changes to this information, but please send me a copy of your update which

my BBS. (You may want to call first and get the latest version.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  STANDARDS
				  =========


At one time Hayes was the standard in modems. All other modems tried
to be "Hayes Compatible". This is still true with 1200 and 2400 bps modems,
but NOT when it comes to 9600 bps or faster modems. Hayes established a
standard called the AT command set. Other modem manufacturers quickly adopted
this standard and the AT commands are still used today (with a few additional
commands added).

Along came USRobotics, and designed the HST, a proprietary 9600 bps modem
that quickly became popular, and no one else was allowed to duplicate.
Hayes soon also came out with a proprietary 9600 modem, but since it could
not talk to the HST at 9600 bps it never became popular in the IBM world.
Next USR improved their HST modem, making it transfer at 14400 bps
without even using data compression. USR's HST became the standard for IBM 
compatable high speed modems.

Realizing that the industry needed a "non-proprietary" 9600 bps standard
that any manufacturer could use, the CCITT came up with the V.32
specification. It took a several years before modem manufacturers started
finding ways to implement this standard at a price competitive to the HST,
but a few manufacturers started producing them, including Hayes. Next the
CCITT realized that better error correction and data compression methods
existed, and thus came up with the V.42 and V.42bis specification.
They are currently finalizing the V.32bis specification, which will also
run at 14000 bps in full duplex mode.

Now many modem manufactures are jumping on the V.32 Bandwagon.
USR offers V.32 modems and allows the 14400 bps HST's to be upgraded to the
old "Dual-Standard" so it can be both HST and V.32 in one.
They also offer a trade-in program for the new "Dual-Standard" which has
the V.32bis as well, but USR wants $575 plus your old HST in trade.
 
The price difference between the HST and the HST-DS used to be considerable,
which is why most BBS Sysops bought the HST without the "DS" option.
As of April 1 1991 USR lowered their prices, making the new "Dual-Standard"
with V.32bis not much more expencive then their non-V.32 HST, and well worth
the differnce.

V.32 has become the standard in the Macintosh world, and some IBM BBS's
are now running just V.32 instead of supporting the HST, and some are
supporting both types, using either the "Dual-Standards" or multiple lines.

Fax machines have had their own standards, CCITT V.27, V.27ter, and V.29
define the modulation scheme used for Fax, and T.30 defines a Fax Protocol. 
Fax machines nowadays can transfer Faxs at 4800 or 9600 bps.

Many modems also offer an option to work as a Fax machine. This can be very
useful if you have a limited number of phone lines and need to share a line
for both modem and Fax calls. Having a computer control the outgoing Faxs
allows more flexibility due to the capability of Fax software available. 
Some Fax/Modems only allow Faxes to be sent, and not recieved.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               The CCITT
        		       =========	

The International Consultive Committee for Telegraph and Telephone (CCITT)
set the V.32, V.32bis Standards in 9600 bps communications.
They have also set the standards of 1200 and 2400 bps in Europe. Unfortuntly
the V.32 standard is very expensive to implement for the modem manufacturers,
and the HST has already become the industry standard in the IBM BBS world.
But since any company may manufacture V.32 Modems without a license or
royalty, there is more price competition going on with these than with the
HST, which currently has no true competition.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 			Half Duplex Vs. Full Duplex
                        ===========================

Half Duplex is When Data is Transmited in one Direction at a time.
Full Duplex is both directions at once. 2400 BPS modems are Full Duplex
The HST Modem uses an improved form of Half Duplex, in which one direction
is transfering at high speed while the other direction is sending ACK/NAK
signals at a slower speed. A simular method is used on the Speedmodem.

V.32 modems use Full duplex, which in most cases does not improve
performance when used on a BBS. There is one way to take full advantage
of a Full Duplex Modem: By using a protocol called Bimodem to upload and
Download at the same time at 9600 bps in each direction! Unfortunately
Bimodem has not become very popular. Most BBS's and users still use one
direction transfer protocols such as Zmodem or YModem-G.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        What is MNP, HST, V.32, V.42?
                        =============================

                                     MNP
					
MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) levels 1-4 are methods of error correction
in which the two modems connected verify the integrity of the data transmitted.
Error correction is required for several streaming protocols such as Ymodem-G
in which the protocol sends a constant stream of data and lets the modems do
the error correction. This requires a clean, noise free line as streaming
protocols will abort if line noise interferes too much. These MNP Levels are
used in almost all High Speed Modems Made today, But Just because two modems
both have MNP it does not ensure that they will both talk to each other at over
2400 baud.

MNP Level 5 is for data compression. Since All BBS's have their files archived
in ZIP, LZH, GIF or some such compressed format (try to ZIP a LZH file), MNP5
can actually increase the overhead by attempting to compress the file further.
Therefore BBS's leave MNP5 turned off, and so should the BBS callers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  HST

HST stands for "High Speed Technology" - a method of communicating at
high speeds which was developed by US Robotics in 1984. HST is a proprietary
method so currently only US Robotics is allowed to Make HST Compatible
Modems. The original HST modems were 9600 BPS by using a 9600 bps channel
in one direction and a 300 (later 450) bps "back channel" in the other to
send ACK/NAK signals for confirmation of data - a half duplex mode - often
referred to as "ping-ponging". In 1989 USR improved the HST to run at 14400
bps by further optimizing their proprietary method. All HST's sold now include
the 14400 bps speed as well as the original 9600 bps mode. Because the HST
14400 bps is the raw speed, It allows the HST to transfer pre compressed files
such as ZIPs at faster speeds than any other 9600 bps modem: over 1700
Characters per second (cps).

The HST has become the "BBS-Standard" in high-Speed modems. More BBS's use
the HST than any other type of modem, including the V.32.

As of January 1st 1991 all HST modems also include the V.42/V.42bis error
correction and data compression (not to be confused with V.32).
Also the "Dual-Standards" made after January 1st also include V.32bis.

The HST's can also be upgraded to the old HST "Dual Standard" allowing it to
also be V.32 compatable. The price is significant for this upgrade however,
and in very few cases is any speed gained.  

V.32bis modems from USRobotics use an all new circuit board. Previous
models *CANNOT BE* upgraded to V.32bis. There *IS* a trade-in/trade-up
program, but it's a rip-off at $575.00 plus your old modem in trade!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   V.32 

V.32 is a 9600 Baud standard that was established by the CCITT back in
1984. V.32 is full duplex (9600 bps in both directions at once).
Normally this would be impossible, but using a technique called "echo
cancellation", one modem can filter its own tones from the phone line,
enabling it to pick out the signals from the other modem. However, echo
cancellation requires that high speed modems include built-in digital
signal processor (DSP) chips, which is the main reason V.32 and V.32bis
costs so much. V.32 also includes a fallback to 4800, if line noise becomes
a problem at 9600. The V.32 standard also provides an optional error-reduction
scheme, called "trellis-coded" modulation (TCM). TCM allows 9600 modems to
check for transmision errors with a redundancy bit, which results in fewer
errors on noisy lines. Most V.32's include this option, but some do not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 V.32bis

It was first realized in 1989 that it is feasible to push V.32 up to
14400 bps, the same speed as the HST now runs. This requires even
better echo cancellation and an overall improvment in receiver quality,
so it is also more costly to produce than the V.32. V.32bis has not yet
officially been finalized by the CCITT, but as of January 1st US Robotics
has started shipping a new version of their Dual Standard Modem which
includes V.32bis in an early but functional form. USR plans to update their
DS ROMS when the CCITT actually release the completed V.32bis specification,
scheduled for mid 1991. It's expected that other Modem manufacturers will
not be able to offer the V.32bis technology untill the 4th quarter of 1991.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   V.42

V.42 has nothing to do with actual modem speed, but how the error correction
and data compression schemes interface. When the CCITT approved V.42 in 1988,
they decided to include two different error correction and data compression
schemes. The first one is MNP,(short for Microcom Networking Protocol).
MNP classes 2, 3, & 4 which handle error correction. Note that MNP-5 was not
included in the V.42 standard because it is only used for data compression.
MNP was made an offical standard due to the large number of modems that
currently use it. (Microcom's exclusive patent rights expired too!)
The Second method is the prefered method, known as LAP-M (Link Access Procedure
for Modems with only MNP is called "V.42 Compatible" and one with LAP-M its
known as "V.42 Compliant". If a V.42 Compliant connected to a V.42 compatible,
it would first try to Handshake with LAP-M, and after it realized that the
other modem is not Compliant, it would try the MNP Method, and they connect.

Most V.32 modems are fully V.42 compliant, but they do NOT have to be,
according to CCITT guidelines. So when purchasing a V.32 modem make sure
that it is also fully V.42 compliant, not just V.42 compatable.

There are now some 2400 baud modems which are also V.42bis compliant,
so since the LAP-M gives 4:1 data compression they are advertised as
"9600 throughput", which really can be misleading and confusing.
Don't be fooled by any throughput claims. The raw speed is what matters
when transfering compressed files such as ZIPs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 V.42bis

V.42bis is a new CCITT standard for data compression techniques, which
was appoved in late 1989. To Support V.42bis, a modem MUST support both
LAP-M and MNP-5, unlike the Standard V.42 in which LAP-M is only an option.
V.42 provides a maximum data compression of 4:1, giving a 9600 bps modem
a throughput of up to 38400 bps. MNP only offers 2:1 Compression.

As I said above, data compression is not very useful when transfering
pre-compressed files, (such as ZIPs) from BBS's. V.42bis has a special
ability, (unlike MNP-5) to determine if the file can be compressed further
or not before making the an attempt to do so. Therefore v.42bis will not
slow down a ZIP transfer, and may even speed it up alittle bit.

Since V.42bis is implemented in firmware, many V.42 compliant modems can
be upgraded to V.42bis with a new ROM chip.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Speedmodem

A less expensive method of 9600 bps communication can be achieved without
using the CCITTs method of "echo cancellation", so that a digital signal
processor is not needed, making the cost much less expensive. This method
is used on the Compucom Speedmodems. The Speedmodem uses Dynamic Impedance
Stabilization (DIS) to increase the relability of the telephone interfaces
signal-to-noise ratio of the telephone line by increasing the clarity and
power of the signal, and automatically compensating for impedence variations
on the phone line. This reduces the probability of line noise, allowing the
Protocols to transfer files with less overhead. It also has a faster
fallback rate of 7200 bps if too much line noise exists for 9600 bps
communications. This makes the Speedmodem stand up to worse line noise
conditions at a faster rate than V.32 can handle.

The Speedmodem is available in two versions. the "Speedmodem-Champ", and
also the "Speedmodem-Combo". The Combo is the same modem with the addition
of a 9600 bps Fax, and a Voice-Mail system as well. The Combo comes with
BitFAX by Bitcom, and supports any other 3rd party FAX software which
uses the standard CCITT AT-FAX command set. The Voice-Mail software is
currently still under development, which will allow your computer work
simular to an answering machine, using the hard disk to store voice messages,
and allowing several differnt message areas or "Mail-Boxes" to be accessed
from a touch tone telephone. 

A Data Compression called CSP (CompuCom Speed Protocol) is used to yeld a
compression of up to 4:1, giving a throughput of up to 38400 bps. This
however, like MNP5 will not be effective when transfering compressed files
from BBS's, such as ZIP files.

DIS and CPS are proprietary methods owned by CompuCom, Sunnyvale, CA.
Because this modem is very inexpensive more people can afford to buy it,
which could cause it to gain popularity quickly. It is still a new product,
but hundreds of BBS's are showing support for it.

The one drawback to this modem is that it will connect to HST and V.32
modems only at 2400 bps. It will connect to other Speedmodems at 9600 bps,
and the Combo version will connect to Fax machines at 4800 or 9600 bps.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               What Next?

By mid 1991 the V.32bis standard will be finialized, and by the years end
several 14400 Bps full duplex modems will be on the market. There is already
talk of the CCITT releasing another standard, V.32ter in 1992, which will
be for 19200 bps. Since these modems are expected to cost considerably more
than the V.32s currently on the market, they will be out of the price range of
most BBS users.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


                           WHAT TO LOOK FOR

THROUGHPUT:
==========

You'll see ads claiming that you can attain 19200 bps or 38400 bps
with a 9600 bps modem - this is true only if you are using MNP5 or other
forms of data compression on uncompressed data or text files. Any 9600 bps
modem using compression can transfer at that effective rate. But for BBS use,
where files are already compressed (such as ZIPs, LZHs, GIFs) MNP5 will
actually slow down throughput by attempting to compress a file that is already
compressed. Generally when using a modem for BBS transfers, its the RAW speed
of the Modem and not the throughput which is important.

Figures of around 1700 cps by the HST modems are attained through proprietary
methods not yet available on other modems.


CONFIGURABILITY:
================
In High Speed Modems, there is a lot more to configure than on a 2400 bps
modem. Be sure your modem comes with NVRAM (Non-volatile Random
Access Memory) that can store your modem configuration, making long init
strings unnessesary unnecessary. Also many modems have dip switches to
set the default configuration, which also simplys simplifies things.
If you buy an Internal Modem, be sure its fully Configurable as far as
selecting the com port and IRQ (interupt request) setting. Some modems
can be addressed from Com1: up to COM8:


UARTS
=====
Internal Modems have a serial port built in, and External Modems use an
existing Serial Port in the computer. A serial port has a UART chip to buffer
and control the Input/Output (I/O). The XT usually has an 8250 UART which will
handle up to 9600 Baud. The AT usually has the 16450. If you have an external
modem you should replace your UART with the 16550A (or 16550AF or 16550AFN).
The 16550 series has 16 byte FIFO buffers to handle interupts better.


INTERNAL or EXTERNAL
====================
IBM Compatable Users can choose internal modems, that plug in a computers
slot, or external, which plugs into an existing serial port with a serial
cable. Internals are usually less expensive, take up less space, have the
correct UART already installed (see below) and don't need a cable.
But the Externals usually have a lot of little lights on it that you can
stare at, and its easier to move to another machine. So which ever you prefer
(or is available in some cases) is fine.



If Considering a USRobotics Modem
=================================
You only need to worry about whether you want the HST 
(which can be upgraded later to V.32), or the new Dual Standard
which is HST, V.32 and now V.32bis as well.


If Considering a V.32
========================================
Some questions to ask:

Can you afford the USR "DS" instead?
Is it V.42 compatible, V.42 compliant, or V.42bis? compliant
If its not V.42bis or compliant, can it be upgraded?
Do Local/National BBS's support it?
What is the warranty? 5 years?


If Considering a Fax/Modem
==============================
some questions to ask:

Does it both send and recive Fax (some are SEND only)
Does it support 3rd party FAX software?
What's the Fax transfer speed Is it 4800 or 9600 bps?
What's the modem DATA speed?
Does it support MNP, V.42, V.42bis?
Does it support other compression?
Do Local/National BBS's support it?
What is the Warranty? 5 Years?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


                    Modem Compatibility Listing:
                    ============================


These modems will usually be downward compatible with 2400 bps and slower
modems, Which means they are also CITT V.22bis and Bell 103/212A compatible.
Most have an auto-fallback mode that will detect the highest negotiable bps
rate. If the modem is V.42 capable, it will fall back to MNP if the other
modem is not LAP-M  capable, but is MNP capable. Modems supporting MNP will
connect with data compression/error correction with other MNP modems at the
highest bps rate common between the two. The speeds listed here are the actual
Raw speed, and not the possible throughput that can be achieved using data
compression.

                          Price Comparisons
                          =================

No Prices have been stated above this Section, because prices often change,
and I want to keep all the prices together so they could be quickly updated
as needed. There are 3 types of prices I will cover. First is The Retail price,
second is the Sysop price, which is only available if you run a BBS.
The list prices are just for comparison. Discount prices can often be found
mail order.

Many Modem Manufactures offer BBS Sysop special prices directly, at
about 50% off the retail price. First the BBS has to be verified, so the
modem manufacturer knows that this is a real BBS that has been running for
 at least 6 Months, and has a minimum number of users, ect. Usually
the Manufacturer will call the BBS once, or twice a few weeks apart to be
sure. Verification usually takes 3-4 weeks. Then the Sysop must agree to use
the Modem on the BBS for some set amount of time, and include a banner in the
logon screen mentioning the presence of the modem.
