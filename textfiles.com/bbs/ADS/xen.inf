Xen BBS    787-0047   WWIVnet:29963  WW4net:5442  SysOps:Klisma #1 & ~ #8

A cozy BBS focusing on philosophy, The Illuminatus! Trilogy, Douglas Adams, 
Anne McCaffrey, Red Dwarf, odd religions, quotes, poetry, and sex.

Xen in run by a 21 year old NCSU EE Student interested mainly in electronics, 
amateur radio (KC4AQC), and unusual science fiction/semi-occult books (Robert 
Anton Wilson, The Church of the Subgenius, Discordian Society).  It was 
originally set up for NCSU's "Self Knowledge Symposium" student group but they 
rejected it.  It's grown and become more diverse in the intervening years.

Xen also has over 100Mb of files and specializes in .MOD music and .GIF/.JPG 
pictures.  The other 50Mb or so is my personal collection of carefully chosen 
favorite files, including lots of games, text editors, and utilities.

The name, BTW, comes from a combination of "Zen" and an old TRS-80 Color 
Computer operating system called "Xex".
