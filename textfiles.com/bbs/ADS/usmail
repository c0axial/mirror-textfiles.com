                        GREETINGS:

If you are the SysOp of a BBS system, I would like to invite YOU
to join UsNetMail.  America's Finest 'easy-going' BBS callers
message network.

NO One is ever refused access to UsNetMail, unlike other networks.

If your BBS is new, or in a rural community, that is just fine
with us.  Never feel that you will not be 'good-enough' to get
both you and your users into the network.  No SysOp is ever
refused access to UsNetMail!
I think that both YOU and your callers will enjoy UsNetMail.
