                THE NASA MLP BBS of Port Orchard, WA
                         Media Release--08024

   Reporting on ALL earthquakes worldwide on a timely basis,
     with a special emphasis on LOCAL quake activity.  NO ONE ELSE
     has our ONLINE MOUNT RAINIER SUBBOARD, complete with mountain
     history, volcanic status, park activities and events, etc.
     An ONLINE COUNTER counts the number of elapsed days since Mt.
     St. Helens eruption and last significant (5.0+) Seattle quake.

   Where other BBS systems are forced to rely on external e-mail
     networks (FidoNet, MaxNet, Intelec, etc) we OWN and OPERATE our
     own network (MLPNet), which extends to Germany and Australia.

   Much of what we have is NOT available elsewhere!  We custom-
     program our OWN doors and educational materials.

   Over 100 graphic images DIRECT FROM NASA of the Shoemaker-Levy 9
     comet impact with Jupiter!  We also have the OFFICIAL NASA
     Press Kit for this event!  More coming!

   The press kit for the NEXT shuttle mission is ALWAYS available
     well ahead of the scheduled liftoff.

   We have, on occasion, NASA engineers DIRECTLY involved with our
     system.

   We have EXTENSIVE online and downloadable materials relating
     to quake preparation and survival.  We have plans available to
     local schools on developing school safety programs.  A map of
     Washington's current and ancient faults hangs on our wall and
     we track EVERY local quake.  We have a VERY PRECISE history
     of our area available in our QUAKE door.  Jim Coleman (Sysop)
     wrote a custom ONLINE game, which simulates victim extrication
     from heavy debris environments.

   Direct Internet USENET access to SCI.CA.QUAKES and
     SCI.SPACE.SHUTTLE newsgroups!  Free read/write access to these
     newsgroups!
