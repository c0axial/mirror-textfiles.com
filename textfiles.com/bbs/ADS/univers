Thank you for your interest in UniverseNet!   We are an Arizona-based          
message echo net, which is dedicated to Science Fiction topics of all kinds    
(including Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, SeaQuest, and ANY other sci-fi     
movies, television shows, books, games, etc....)                               
                                                                               
This net began as a Star Trek only net under the name of TrekkerNet,           
but due to an unforeseen incident, we had to change our name.  I have          
taken this opportunity to make some changes and revisions (adding other        
sci-fi topics other than Star Trek).  This way, we have been able to reach     
more users of varying sci-fi interests.                                        
                                                                               
As of 8/02/94, we have members (including those who are in the process of      
becoming a member) in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia,         
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,         
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah; also the island        
of Guam; Alberta, Canada; and soon in Brazil, South America!
