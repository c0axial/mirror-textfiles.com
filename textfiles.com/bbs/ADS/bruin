        Welcome to Bruin Network!

        We deal with the Gay/Bi/Lesbian communities with the emphasis 
        on bear friendly communities.

                Area Coordinators (AC (NET COORDINATORS), Hubs, and
                Nodes will be figured out as we get them. However, the 
                Hub for Southern California will be seperated by COUNTY AND
                AREA CODES!!! All other Hubs will be seperated by area code
                only. This is due to Pacific Bell (tm) and their numerous
                area codes!
                
                Nodes will be set by the hub in their area.  If a hub does    
          
                not exist, the new node must be set up through their area     
         
                coordinator, then Regional, then zone IN THAT ORDER!
                All complaints can be given to the net-up on the command
                latter. (IE:  Hub having problem with their Area Coordinator
                would submit their problem to the Regional)


        GENERAL MESSAGE BASE RULES:


                Message Bases are seperated into 5 categories.


                RED: Over 21

                YELLOW: Gay/Lesbian/Bi ONLY

                GREEN: General Message Bases open to all users.

                BLUE:  Sysop Message Bases (MANDATORY)

                WHITE: Organization sponsored echos

                ECHOS WITH NO COLOR CODE ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FROM THE HUB
                NET, OR REGION THAT SPONSORS THEM. 
                               
                Priority of message bases will be RED and YELLOW due to
                the nature of the network.  We request (but dont demand) 
                that you try to curb your message bases from GREEN for
                they are available on many other networks (like fido, etc).

                You may add green to your local BEARLIST and request it in
                the main BEARLIST that comes out at any time, however, you
                must get permission to add BLUE, RED, and YELLOW Message
                areas from Cowboy Communications before putting them online
                for we are ultimately responsible for that BEARLIST and it's 
                contents.

                FLAMING/BASHING IS ILLEGAL ON ALL MESSAGE BASES ON 
                BruinNetwork! Any such messages found on the message
                bases MUST be deleted by the board sysop, echomail 
                coordinator, hub, regional, or Zone coordinator if found.

                ALL NEW BBSs on the network MUST register with Cowboy 
                Communications for they deal with the nodelist directly.
                Cowboy Communications, Zone Coordinators, Regional
                Coordinators, Area Hosts and Hubs are allowed to edit the 
                BearNode list. Only the BearEcho coordinator is allowed to
                edit the BEARECHO.NA (echo list)

                If you are a HUB, AC (Host), RC, or ZC, please notify 
                Cowboy Communications if you add or delete a node so we can 
                keep our registry up to date.

                
        ECHO COSTS                
        
                (Sept 15th, 1994)
                
                You may not charge for echos due to the fact that there
                are not enough BBSs available for another bbs to connect
                to for free echos... There simply is not enough connects
                to do so yet.



                (Jan 1st,1995)
                  
                HUBS,HOSTS (AC), and REGIONALS(RC) may charge for echos to
                help defray long distance costs.

        application marked BEARJOIN.APP and transmit it to us at Cowboy
