   10.  We don't have every echo know to _homo electronicus_.
    9.  We don't have GIGS & GIGS of files.
    8.  We don't have the latest dirty graphics some pimply adolescent
        scanned out of his dad's old magazines.  (At a 100k a pop?  Are
        you kidding?)
    7.  We don't do Windows.
    6.  We're too lazy to upgrade to RA 2.0.
    5.  ANSI?  What dat?
    4.  The sysop subscribes to _National Review_.
    3.  Sorry, 2400 bps required to download.
    2.  When you ask for "access to the secret warez area, dood", the
        sysop ignores you.
    1.  Two words:  NO GAMES.
