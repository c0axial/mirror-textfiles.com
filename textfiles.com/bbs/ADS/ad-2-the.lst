     This file is created by using the Chattanooga Area BBS List from
TLR Systems BBS.  The Chattanooga Area BBS list a long list of current &
verified "24 hour" boards in the area.  If you (a SysOp) are not on the
list or you know of a "24 hour" system out there that is not listed, you
will need to call 615-892-8834 (TLR Systems BBS) and enter the information
from the "INFO DOOR" menu.   This is a automated door and once new info
has been entered, to can download this new text while online.
     To keep this listing "Up-To-Date", please call and update your info
concerning your BBS at least each quarter.  Change the "LAST VERIFIED"
line to the current date so others will know recent your listing is.

 Thanks!
