The Bloom Beacon-Picayune (BB-P for short) is a general-purpose BBS with 900
megabytes of magnetic storage space.  For those curious as to the name, the
Bloom Beacon-Picayune got its name from the two sensationalistic newspapers in
the classic comic strip "Bloom County".

On-line since early 1990, BB-P is a free access BBS with very generous limits,
although unlimited access is also available with one-time donations.  User
registration is performed automatically on-line and offers first-call
downloading privileges to new users.

Although small, the file base is extremely current with the latest in freeware
and shareware software, with new files coming in daily.  Ideal for the mail
junkie, BB-P is also node in the FidoNet (1:151/106), ILink and Intelec
international mail networks, offering over 400 echomail conferences on a wide
variety of topics.  There are also a number of registered multi-user doors
available for your entertainment.  You will also note that there is no adult
material available on BB-P.

BB-P also happens to be the home to UpLoadProcessor, the award-winning BBS
upload processor for PCBoard 14.5+ as voted by PCBoard sysops worldwide, the
Zipfile Duplicate Checking System (ZDCS), Archive Identifier (ARCID) format
identification utility, AntiAd BBS Ad Removal System, the FNLScan Fidonet
NodeList Scan door and ROMProc CD-ROM Download Preprocessor.

For your security, all downloadable files have been fully scanned for viruses
with the latest version of F-PROT by Frisk Software International and McAfee
Associates' SCAN using UpLoadProcessor.  Most files have been compressed using
the industry-standard ZIP compression system by PKWARE.

Give BB-P a call!  You'll be glad you did!
