Never A Charge For Access


The Illustrated Mac runs state-of-the-art FirstClass BBS software.
What is FirstClass? Have you ever used the graphical interface to
America Online? CompuServe? If so, you have an idea of what FirstClass
is like. It provides a CUSTOMIZED graphical interface for callers to
The Illustrated Mac. No other BBS in America can look like The
Illustrated Mac. Full 8-bit, 256 color windows (in the Macintosh
client). Customized icons that give a graphical representation of the
conference or file area that the icon is assigned to (both Macintosh
and Windows clients).

This isn't "RIP" graphics....the exceedingly slow process whereby ANSI
is used to emulate a color graphics program. This is a program that
uses local (i.e., on YOUR hard drive) resources to form a graphical
representation of a text-based bulletin board system. You can hear
sounds online. You can see true pictures online. You can MULTITASK
online. FirstClass allows simultaneous uploading, downloading,
chatting, browsing, message reading and replying when using the
Macintosh or Windows clientware. You're only limited by your own
ability to multitask, not your computer's.

Where can you get the Macintosh or Windows clientware? On The
Illustrated Mac, of course! It's FREE! You can access the system
through the command line interface (be forewarned: it doesn't work
like TAG or WWIV...read the Help files) to download the clientware on
your first call! After that, you get 45 minutes online per day FREE.

Well, so much for the LOOK of The Illustrated Mac. What about the
CONTENT?

If you're looking for files (other than Macintosh) or games, TIM isn't
for you. The modest file section consists almost exclusively of
Macintosh software, supplemented by the newest version of the GIGAROM
CD, containing over 1 Gig of Macware. What few IBM programs are there
are programs that allow IBMers to interact with the Macintosh world.
You can find the latest version of QModem on dozens of Triangle
boards. Ditto for TradeWars.

But if you like COMMUNICATING with other people, The Illustrated Mac
*is* the place for you! TIM has a wide selection of local conferences,
conferences from the Raleigh Fido-based TAG network, a large selection
of OneNet conferences (OneNet is an exclusively-FirstClass network
comprised of over 600 FirstClass BBSes from all over the world), and
even LIMITED INTERNET ACCESS! Yes, TIM carries all triangle domain
UseNet groups, as well as some selected alt domain newsgroups. You can
also send and receive Inter net e-mail at TIM. To get an Internet
address and  "posting" access to newsgroups, you need to leave a note
to Con Gratulations (TIM's sysop) when you visit. Without an Internet
address, you can read UseNet groups, but don't have "Posting" access
to them.

Future plans are for even more OneNet conferences, UseNet newsgroups,
national Fido echoes, and membership in a quality adult-only network,
as well as expanded file areas. 

BYTE Magazine says FirstClass is truly FIRST CLASS bulletin board
software. The Illustrated Mac is the only public-access Raleigh
FirstClass bulletin board. Please stop by and give it a try!
