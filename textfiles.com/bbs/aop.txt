	 Association of Online Professionals
	Information and Membership Application
 
Thank you for your interest in the Association of Online 
Professionals.  As our industry grows, it is critical that 
professionals such as ourselves join together to promote our 
common interests and defend ourselves from unwarranted 
regulation and legislation.  

AOP was created by leading members of our industry to support 
the individuals, online systems and companies that comprise 
the industry.  While we are a young organization, we have 
substantial support behind our Association.  And this support
reaches far beyond our own borders, with organizing efforts 
underway for affiliate AOP organizations in Canada, Latin 
America, Europe and Asia.  

Together, we are building an industry where professionals can 
practice their craft without undue interference.  An industry 
with room for individuals and systems to grow and prosper. And 
an industry where our members can grow professionally and 
profit from their efforts.

But we can't do it without you.
  
Regardless of the environment in which you work -- from a BBS 
or online system to the Internet to companies that provide 
products and services to online systems -- you are an 
online professional.  And we need your support.  We need your 
voice with ours when we fight for fair legislation.  We need your 
ideas and efforts to define and deliver services.  We need your 
financial support, through your dues, to staff and fund these 
efforts.  

The dues you pay -- far lower than for most professional 
associations -- will be returned to you in the form of a better 
environment in which to manage your system or business.  And it 
will be returned to you more directly in the form of services, 
information, discounts and support not easily available to you 
anywhere else.  

It is our goal and our commitment to deliver to you a set of 
services worth more than what you pay in dues.  More 
importantly, it is our goal to help create the credibility, public 
support and respect that system operators deserve.  

We look forward to having you as a member of the Association of 
Online  Professionals.  If we may provide you with further 
information or answer questions, please don't hesitate to call 
AOP in our headquarters near Washington, DC.

	     Association of Online Professionals 
               6010 Burdon Court, Suite 302
                 Alexandria, VA   22315  
                      (703) 924-9692 

In California, self-styled consumer advocates are lobbying 
legislators to regulate the BBS industry.  Among the proposed 
regulations is a requirement for every BBS with customers in 
the state to establish a business address and buy a business 
license for California. . .

The state of Pennsylvania has adopted new tax laws that will 
apply sales and  use taxes for connect time, downloads and 
services from online services and  BBS systems.  At least 25 
other states are expected follow suit in the months  ahead. . . 
 
Congress, working to forge a National Information 
Infrastructure, is lobbied  daily by powerful and well funded 
cable and television companies to make  interactive TV the 
format for NII. . .  

Proposed revisions to the U.S. copyright law under consideration 
right now  would make SysOps responsible forcollection of 
royalties and safeguarding of  copyrighted material on their 
systems.  In part, the content providers are  seeking to make 
SysOps financially liable for copyrighted materials of any  kind 
that find their way into electronic distribution. . .  

The news media portray BBS systems as a population of 
pornographers and  software thieves.  And they question 
whether families and kids are "safe"  online. . .  
 
If the online services industry is to survive and thrive, we must 
work  together to bring power and respect to the industry and its 
members. SysOps,  companies and other professionals with an 
interest in the industry must  work together to protect our 
interests and promote the growth of our  industry. 
 
The job of promoting an industry and providing services to its 
professionals  falls to an industry trade and professional 
association.  Where no single  SysOp, and no single company, 
has the resources to do what needs to be done on its own, and 
association -- with thousands of members each contributing  a 
little to the effort -- can.  The Association of Online Professionals 
is  your association, committed to these goals.  AOP was formed 
to create and  provide opportunities to professionals in the 
online industry.  Opportunities for interaction with other online 
professionals.  Opportunities for growth,  career advancement, 
entrepreneurship and business referrals. 
 
But AOP is more than this.  It's your voice in Washington and at 
the state  level.  It's valuable information, discounts on essential 
products and services,  and member support designed to make 
your life easier.  

The Association of Online Professionals is a non-profit trade 
association  founded in 1994 to promote the interests of the 
professionals who plan,  manage and provide services to the 
online telecommunications industry. Though in its first year, 
AOP has already gained the support of major  companies in the 
industry, key system operators and other interested  
professionals throughout the country.  
  
AOP is your association.  We've made a strong start, and will  
be working actively through the fall to build a set of services  
that can provide real value to our SysOp members. 
 
Classes of Membership 
 
AOP has two classes of members: 
  
Individual members are individuals who manage or 
operate  systems that include BBS systems, nodes of the 
Internet, nodes on  message networks, remote access computers 
and other systems.  And they are the professionals actively 
involved in the industry who do not  manage systems. These 
include service providers, educators, law  enforcement officers,
government employees and others who share our  commitment to 
the growth of the online community.  These  members receive the 
full range of AOP services for an annual dues of  $95. 
 
Corporate members include the companies that provide 
hardware,  software, access services (including major online 
systems) and other  direct services or support for system 
operators.  Corporate members pay  a dues fee on a sliding scale 
based on gross annual sales, and receive up to five individual 
memberships, access to industry research data, access to 
members, and a role in industry promotion and public policy 
initiatives.  

Participation in Association Special Interest Groups: 
 
AOP operates and supports special interest groups (SIGs) and 
committees that work cooperatively to the betterment of the 
industry.  Members are invited and  encouraged to participate in 
these programs.  They include, but are not limited to:  

1) A SysOp SIG that will set priorities for projects and guide 
the AOP staff in providing services to system operator members.
This SIG also oversees such critical projects as the Standards 
Committee (which manages the AOP Code of Professional 
Standards) and the Awards Committee.

2) An Industry Marketing SIG to develop and implement joint 
marketing programs to members and consumers. This is the 
primary working group for consultants, service providers and
small companies.

3) A Public Policy SIG to coordinate legislative and regulatory 
responses at the International, Federal and State levels in 
support of member interests. 

4) A Hobbyist/Non-Profit SIG that will set priorities for projects 
and guide the AOP staff in providing services to system 
operators who operate non-profit or hobby online systems.

5) An Education SIG that will establish and strengthen the use 
of online systems for education and reference.  This SIG will 
also manage the AOP Certification Program for online 
professionals.

6)  A Media SIG for members who report on or cover online 
communications, including editors of online 'zines and 
newsletters.

Members are encouraged to be active in one or more SIGs, both 
to ensure that their voices are heard in the Association and to 
help further the goals of the Association.  New SIGs will be 
added if a sufficient number of members request them.

Member Services 

Service to members is the reason AOP exists, and its single goal 
for the years  ahead.  These services are defined and planned by 
our members based on  their needs, and implemented on their 
behalf by the Association's staff.

   including seminars, conferences and regional events.

   protect your interests.

   and public education.
