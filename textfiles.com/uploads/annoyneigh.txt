Dealing with annoying neighbours

By Sweeper09

At some point of our lives, we.ve had to deal with them, especially if you 
happen to be a minority of any kind. Here.s a few steps to make life 
easier when a problem arises with a neighbour.

I. Don.t talk, listen

These days, spy cams in the shape of pens, teddy bears and even buttons 
are extremely cheap, offering video of good resolution and audio as well.

Nobody likes a loudmouth, avoiding being one will earn you neutrality in 
an apartment building, so the first thing you will do is just listen in 
with your device placed in an open window, hidden in plain sight.

II. Don.t get mad, get everything

Armed with the good evidence you may have collected from the would-be 
harassers, your local civil rights organization will be more than happy to 
represent you for free. Discrimination and mobbing are illegal but if it 
involves things like loud noises, make sure you use a reference for which 
time it is, like filming a clock with your camera without cutting away.

III. Be like Elliot Ness

Al Capone got famously caught for tax evasion, instead of selling liquor 
and, you know, killing people.

So, say your neighbours are remodelling; what you do is call in a decibel 
measuring crew and, if the sounds they produce are higher than that of a 
dog barking, you can essentially take them to court with the evidence and 
get their money when they decide to make a deal instead.

IV. In case they are listening

Get a caller ID service, just in case you give out your phone number by 
accident and they call you to make prank phone calls. A phone recorder 
works even better but may not be necessary.

V. When it comes to meeting them

The best defence is to speak your mind but in an extremely polite manner, 
so as not to cause animosity, as people respond more to tone than what is 
being said to them.
