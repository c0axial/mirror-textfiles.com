  - What is Pext?

  Pext is a  complicated method of encryption  known to most 
  cryptographers as the "Pigpen Cipher". It relies on visual 
  aid to create the ciphertext itself but can be encoded and 
  decoded mentally. Pext is set apart from these other tech-
  niques because it is extended to  support a larger variety 
  of symbols and  alphanumeric characters.  This is meant to
  be written in a physical medium. Not digitally.

  - Alphabetic Characters

  - All Other Unlisted Characters

  For all of the unassigned/unlisted characters, you can ei-
  ther create your own visual encryption method,  or use the
  described procedure below.
       Basically,  all you do is put your encrypted text be-
  tween both an encrypted  "F"  and  "H"  (making the markup
  brackets "<"  and  ">").  You place an abbreviated form of
  the symbol and place it between the brackets.
       For example, we'll use a slash.  The abbreviated form
  of "slash" will be "slsh". Placing brackets on the outside
  of "slsh" will look like this:
           ___ 
   / |   |    | |   | \  \
  <  |   |   O| |   |  >  >
   \ |___| ___| |___| /  /

       You'll always be able to tell if there's  a symbol in
  the document if there is any bracketed words. Although, it
  could be confused with words starting with an "F" and end-
  ing with an "H".  Be careful if you come across words like 
  "flash" or "fish". Here's a list of abbreviations:

    - : = cln	- ; = scol
    - & = and	- Λ = lamb
    - $ = dol	- % = per
    - £ = pnd	- ¥ = yen
    - # = hsh	- ^ = crt	
    - @ = at	- * = as	
    - _ = und	- ` = apo
    - / = slsh	- \ = hsls
    - ~ = tld	- ' = quo1
    - ฿ = btc	- " = quo2

  - Example
 
  Let's select a simple message to encrypt:

    Go forward.

  So we go by our visual aids to come up with:
        ___          ___        ___              ______
     /\   O|  /\   /   O|    | |    \    /  | \  \    /
    /  \   | <  > <     |    | |     \()/   | o>  \()/
   /    \  |  \/   \    | ___| |___   \/ ___| /    \/
   
  If you want to decrypt it, just do the reverse.

  - Conclusion

  So,  all in all,  if you want to play around with this and 
  make it as secure as possible, be my guest. All this is is
  an extended modification of an existing encryption method.
  You can make your own symbols or even  just mix the exist- 
  ing characters around with eachother. It is fairly easy to 
  memorize, as I was able to recall the entire alphabet just 
  a day after writing it down for the first time.
