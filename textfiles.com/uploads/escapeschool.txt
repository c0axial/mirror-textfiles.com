HOW TO ESCAPE SCHOOL
by lovelie18

If you like school and all why the hell are you reading this?

okay. to the actual school thing.  your parents might have a pretty good reason to send you to school.  get some reasons
they think you are not smart enough
they're scared of police
they hate you
they want you to be away

okay so now you got a reason to stay home from school.  we'll get on with the methods now.

1)FALSE SICKNESS
tell your mom that you are sick. but before doing this, throw away, hide, give away, or do anything with the thermometer, as long as your parents don't get it.  or youre out of luck. complain to your parents that you have a stomach ache or head ache or fake cough or something.  tell your parents that you are feeling too shitty to go to school.  but don't do this too often or your parents might take you to the doctor.
2)STAYING HOME
this method only works if both your parents work and you know the time they usually come home(after school time).  you might be taking a chance on this one because one or both of your parents come home, you might have to explain everything.  so what you do is after your parents leave, call the school office and try to sound like whoever usually calls when you are absent.  say thai you are absent(duh) and spend your whole day with video games or whatever damn thing you like to do.
3)RUNNING AWAY
this only works if you have a cell fone.  after you get to school, go to a place without many children or teachers, and call the office that you will be absent in your mom or dad's voice(duh).  then get the hell outta there.(but don't get too close to the police station, or somewhere your parent/guardian goes to often(like their workplace or a local grocery store and your house(duh))
well good luck kids
