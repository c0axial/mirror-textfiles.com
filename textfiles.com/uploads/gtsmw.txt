Guide To Sniping In 
Modern Wafare 2

1. The basics 
So if your reading this you ar intrested about becoming a sniper so we 
need to set some ground rules

1. The maker of this tutorial does nnot garantee that you will be the best 
sniper in the whole of MW2 This is down to you and your sucky game skill.

Ok.  Now thats clear 

2. The Mind Set

You need to understand that there are more snipers out there than you so 
dont try and be cocky and shout a load of S**T down the microphone 
Ect."You fucking cock ass you got pwnd by me and my crew so HAHAHAHAHAH" 
Doing that makes you a pussy and it will get you stabbed in the back

So now you have got to be 
1. Patient the enemy is not going to stand in the street in open view so 
wait silent and still for your chance then BAM You got your self a nice 
splatterd Brain
And Have
2.Attachments i know what your thinking Attachements But im only just 
starting!!! I know but this Will be nessecery so work plaint till you get 
a attachment then use them WIZELY FFS

3. Picking a rifle

 now you have the choice at the start to pick two rifles the intervention 
and the barret but witch one do you choose ????? Awnser is Barratt That 
barratt .50 Cal has more damgae than the intervention when siclenced so 
keep that in mind.

4. Location,Location,Location

Youve all seen movies with snipers on the top of roofs well ... THAT IS A 
LOAD OF BULL Crap You want to pick somewhere On the outskirts of the map 
so you can see evrywhere on the map As well as keeping your own ass safe.

5. Perks

Perks are addons that will help you in CoD But witch one do you choose to 
be a sniper Bling/Bling Pro,Stopping Power/Stopping Power Pro And

6. Secondery Weapons

So Lets make this quick you have diffrent catagories to choose from 
Launchers,Handguns,Machine Pistols And Shotguns You want to pick handguns 
and choose the USP .45/Silenced

Now you are ready to pop some heads and break some legs
