Various store phone extensions (intercoms)

Ok well here they are for your phone phun.
Most of these work by going up to an in store phone and dialing it in
or calling the store operator and asking for the extension.
In most stores you can no longer call from an outside line and ask for the extension,
but you should try anyways.

When it says "all store page" that means when you talk into the phone, what you say will 
be heard immediatly over the speakers

						

wal-mart						
#96	 All store page				
#980*	 Pick up a call where * is the line number				
	 (useful to pickup a paged person's call)				
						
target	 					
52#	  all store page	
52 or 522 possible all store page			
789	  employee walkie talkies (may also be 3789)				
209	  security (Assets Protection)					
201	  store manager				
236	  guest services				
300	  cashier leader				
250	  photo				      
241	  food ave					
229	  jewlery					
255, 256  electronics

Note: at target, code red is fire, code green is medical emergency and code yellow is lost child
The code can be said over the intercom or walkie talkies, but it is repeated 3 times with the department name
i.e. Code red chemicals code red chemicals code red chemicals
This will cause all the employees to go to chemicals with fire extinguishers, thus leaving the rest of the store open
When you call the walkie talkie extension, it will ask for channel 1 or 2. Channel 1 is what most employees
will be on, since it is the sales floor channel. Channel 2 is the stockroom which is only used to ask for more merchandise to be pushed out
