Truth About Microsoft
--------------------------------------------------------

A big topic came about  recently.
It is believed that microsoft operating
systems are slaves for botnets.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you all know there are hidden files within Windows XP.
Locked folders that you can't open because they are crypted into
the operating system itself.   Ask yourself why wouls microsoft do this?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The answer is guess that if a big cyber war would come across microsoft
would have the final say in the war.   They could ddos whoever that needed
to be.  Of course the act of a ddos is illegal but microsoft almost owns the internet.
Think about it, what if they get arrested and the company discontiued.   Microsoft
what have the final say by releasing a update on XP that would lock all computers.
You know that there are alters to Windows operating systems such as linux but
linux is limited compared to Windows. Anyway if a hacker could unlock or what ever
the hacker would find a process of the botnet since it would be the only one running.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bare with me Im only 15.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So when the bot would be discovered the media and goverment would be insane
considering botnets are illegal in any form.   Even if you are making slaves perform tasks.
Back on the cyber war.   If they even did this is would be unheard of.  The internet as you know it would ........ die.
