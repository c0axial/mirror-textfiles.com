This file here explains to you how you can open a permutation lock without
knowing the right numbers code. This file is just written to show you  the
insecurity of this kind of lock. Which means you shouldnt buy such a  lock
because it is very insecure and every person with this knowledge can  open
it. With this technique you can open the lock without  destroying  it  and
without doing any harm to it.


        example ASCII picture of a permutation lock:


                         .___.  .___.  .___.
                    .----|   |--|   |--|   |----.
                    |    [ 3 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 1 ]    |
       |------------| b  |   |  |   |  |  --- c |-..----------|
       |     a      |    [_4_]  [_7_]  [_2_]    | ||    d     |
       |------------[___________________________]-------------|
                                                               



     a) - metal chain which is permanently connected to the lock
     b) - part where the 3 number discs are for the code
     c) - 3 discs for the number code
     d) - metal chain which you pull out with the right code (open it)



So how do i open the permutation lock without knowing the code of numbers?
This is very easy done - too easy and this is why this kind of  protection
is very weak. The industry should not build them anymore. Here we go:

We take a) in our left hand and d) in our right hand in a way that we  can
still rotate the 3 discs with our other fingers left. Then  we  pull  both
sides of the chain ( a, d ) - we pull a) to the left with  our  left  hand
and d) we pull to the right with our right hand so that it is a bit harder
to rotate the 3 discs.

Then we take the first disc with our fingers and rotate it  from  0  to  9
until we feel and hear a "clack" or "click". This tells us  that  we  have
found our first code number. The same we do with the 2  other  discs  left
until finally the permutation lock opens.

I did this already as a kid, 15 years back, on the permutation lock of  my
bicycle. But they still sell these insecure locks today and you  can  find
them on many products which often costs lots of money. So dont buy such  a
lock and of course do not use this technique to steal stuff from others.

Probably there are lots of more different kind of such locks which you can
open with the same technique or in a bit different way - for example if it
is not a chain lock but a normal lock for a locking bar and so on.
