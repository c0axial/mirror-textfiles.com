--- Foreword

    This is an original work, that I constructed over a very long period 
    of time (from 1984 to the present).  Most of the files were written on 
    the word processing application of a Psion Series 3a palmtop computer; 
    all of the machine-specific formatting (centered text; bold, italic 
    and underlined characters) has been lost, in the transfer to a plain 
    ASCII text format.  Nearly all of the text was centered in the original
    document.  A properly formatted Windows Write version is available,
    and will be freely provided to anyone that requests it.

    Much of the book was written while I was enduring a very bizarre 
    series of awful personal difficulties, which wouldn't be easy to 
    explain; I apologize for any disturbances that might be created in the 
    minds of any of the readers by any of the selections, but I felt that 
    it was important to include the entire text of the book (which I 
    originally forwarded to Lauren Cohn; see notes and letters elsewhere 
    in this file), because of what I have perceived (over the years since 
    I first released a copy of it) as a kind of 'stir' that the book may 
    have created.

    Although I cannot claim to have perfect knowledge of what seems to be 
    a kind of interactivity between normal human consciousness, and what 
    may be intelligent non-human minds (such as angels, demons, 'aliens,' 
    etcetera), because of my wide range of personal experiences, I 
    strongly believe that such beings do exist, and often influence the 
    minds of human beings.  Most writers, artists and musicians (that 
    believe that such intelligences exist) would probably like to believe 
    that they are inspired only by 'good' spirits.  Unfortunately, in this 
    day and age, it seems that many people are heavily influenced by what 
    are spoken of in the Bible as 'seducing spirits,' which basically 
    means demons or fallen angels.

    I believe that some portions of the text of this book that I have 
    written, may have been influenced to some degree by evil spirits, 
    because of the chaotic emotional state that I was often in while 
    writing various sections.  Other portions probably aren't.  To be on 
    the safe side, I strongly encourage anyone that will read this book of 
    poetry to pray to the Lord for protection against any evil spirits 
    that may have been associated with the production of this particular 
    work.

    Five additional poems have been included, in BOOK8.TXT.  I am seeking 
    an honest literary agent, to assist me in publishing this volume (or
    selected excerpts from it) of poetry, as well as a complete book of
    my log entries.

A Room and a Rocking Chair

it's early evening
and there is
an open window	sweet breeze wafting
through and of	course sunlight that
beams onto the	oak floor at the
	expected angle
	lace doilies carefully placed on the sill
		a vague smell of menthol
	maybe some kind of tea
			maybe not
outside there is a breathtakingly beautiful view of a
				series of random canyons
					growing dimmer
			because of the setting sun
		descending at this moment
	in the room there is only this bulb
narrating the story (of the woman
known as rita
who is
sitting and
	not knitting) in her antique
		cherrywood rocking		chair
			just rocking		steadily
				 just		waiting for you to arrive

A Serious Chat with Beelzebub

hey man
are you really up there?
i know that Christ is, or will be soon
is it you that engineered all of the peculiar
folk sayings that are beating the
psychological stuffing out
of us nowadays?  did
you set all of the
intellectual
time bombs
that seem to
be constantly
going off?  have
you and your hench
men been given permission
to torment the longhairs with
your enigmas and conundrums?
i think that we deserve the truthful
answer that surely you don't want us to
have considering how bad a rap you have gotten
in the Scriptures - why, my capitalization of that word
must really irk you
i guess i'd be upset
too if i toiled at such
a thankless job - not
that i'm qualified to be
a judge or anything, but
couldn't you guys restrain
yourselves from debauching
the earth girls - yeah they sure
are damningly fetching, but come
on, is it that bad being born asexual?
it must be, considering how much your
workers dwell on carnal issues once they
are nicely ensconced in warm human bodies
what's going to happen when you are cast down?
hey man
why aren't you answering me?

Ancient Chinese Secret

those dirty rings
and other snarky smelly things
are nothing more than
mirthful memories
a few thousand years
from now

Around Me

do you like my company?
am i welcome at your home?
would you
treat me like a serial killer if
i said that i didn't like a certain
culture or race because of having
been bombarded with too many bogus
experiences relating to them?  would you
hold that against me?  would you
treat me like an idiot if i decided
to drop out of a society that
exalts ignorance and insensitivity?
that praises and honors individuals that
will never be able to write coherent
english, or count past an arbitrary
limit?  if i shunned the nastier side
of capitalism after having it revealed
as a pen of nakedly wriggling swinelike
hypocrites, would you point out how
phony i am, and laugh at me when i tried
to vainly defend myself, and give reasons
for my goofy and disheveled appearance?
do you like
being around me?

Baby, It's Hot Outside

please my darling
don't continue to
send your eerie
friends chasing after
me casting spells
and just because
i don't want
to rule this
rotten old world
don't think that
i'm a wimp
because i am
not and i
have brand new
plans for you
and if you
know what's good
for you you'll
accept God's love
and not kill
people with your
demonic cult we
are immune silly
rabbit you have
been infiltrated by
a dybbuk and
¢dhinn is unhappy
with us we
still have to
transplant those maple
trees and i'm
sure we will

Be Good

the devil says that there
is no you which encourages
you to say that there is no
God and no devil and that
there is no need to pay
homage to either of them
even though it surely seems
as if many of you are worshipping
something although you put many
different attractive faces on your
objects of devotion they are all
roads to beelzebub and the big
tupperware party that he has
planned yes i am aware of the
truth and i know that shamballa
exists and that there are some
pretty horrible things going on in
other dimensions and on other worlds
i have been to one of the nicer ones and
upon returning home have been extremely
persecuted because the spiritual rulers
here know that i could upset many of
their well-laid plans for ensnaring
more innocent human souls into
their mindless program of evil
malthusian destruction and
that just won't do - if you
don't worship their gods
of destruction well then
you are just no damn good
but i remember the book of job
and the line somewhere in the Bible
about being wise as serpents and
harmless as doves i am at peace
with the knee slapping hilarity
of their inane modes of worship
and i won't go insane but they will
and they will meet the evil god they
love so much he will probably tear
them into little pieces like tash
did in the chronicles of narnia

please be good

Better Wake Up Now

darling
wake up
they're coming for us
i know you're still sleepy
after such a long flight
but they are finally beginning to understand
our mission
and they don't want us to sing that lullaby
they know what would happen
and it's against their religion
please wake up sweetheart
(i love you more when you're asleep)
we have time to sketch a bit before we go
oh no maybe not
they're pounding on the door
now you're awake
our cab is waiting outside the window
what?
yes, we are on the ninth floor
get up
ok
never mind the door keys
let's go

Charred Homeless Kittens

whoa what a big blaze
glad i paid attention
and listened to mama

she dragged me out
of the fire and told me
to read the Good Book

before she did how odd
that i was warned in so
many ways about this

great destruction of
chicago and how odd that
others only laughed

however many times i
attempted to explain
my subjective awareness

of the schedule for the
catastrophe and how many
times and ways i was almost

killed for trying to scream
aloud to warn them that
squadrons of demons live

in my brain and whisper hints
and clues and try to elbow
the Holy Spirit out of the way

there are no exorcists
available so i have to live
with the fracas in my mind

for a little while longer until
the fires burn out and i can
begin my tribe down south

checked in and didn't check
out why wouldn't they listen to
me rather than james brown?

if i am killed it will only get much
better for me and far worse for
the foolish forces holding the gun

so please leave me be i have
serious work to do and i will
not become a villain unless you

make me into one and none of us
want that to happen so just let
me live and keep praying to God

Darn

three ring circus of greed and insanity
the clock is still ticking what time is it
judgment day can't be far away we are
enduring a critical mass of bearish or
is it bullish solipsistic phenomena my
word what a symbolic traffic jam how
did we get
so caught
up in this
whirlwind
someone
worked a
wizardly
wild wave
of incredibly preposterous outrageous
humor no human minds could have set a
series of paranormal events like these
in motion and i am certain that socialist
forces from another dimension or some
other nefarious organs are responsible

Even Blind Dogs Find Bones

when you talk to dogs you gotta bark
i see sailor moon on the cutty sark
and speed racer dealing with the mammoth car
trixie weeping at the edge of a cliff not far
away from princess sunshine swinging
to and fro hither and thither and singing
in her gracias way of brightening
your day even though it's frightening
i just gotta laugh and laugh at the cheesy
ness of this whole process of sleazy extra
terrestrial hypocrisy i may just snap
har har har i started all of this crap
long ago and now i have to live with it so
i'm reading my script and then i'll go
and leave you all totally alone but not
until the true show hits the real spot

and some of you will remember that i told you so

First, I Will Heal You

why have i bothered you for so long?

i need the prism of
your humbly holy mind
to gather and separate sunlight
into pure rays of unquenchable
firefighting radiation
to throw them for

a distance and put
the fear of the unknown
into their cocky unsanctimonious
selves they make fun of the mom
and pop operation that we
were sent to build upon

why are you resistant to my charm?

Giggling With Barney

my
jolly imp
patron saint of
silliness he means much
more than what you think he is
a gangster muppet his brain is nicely
unfettered by workaday cares he knows how
and why his folks
were destroyed he was
present with the pterodactyls
swirling above in the red sky he knows
that they actually will be back because of the
mad scientists that
are feverishly tinkering 
with the encyclopedia of gene
information he understands that the
kaballah and yggdrasil have reached an accord
he is a
smart
reptile
and he is
nobody's
fool no sirree

Guess Who Tricked You

my bright friend you've been to the fair lands of the
germans jews jamaicans japanese nigerians jordanians
i am from the lands of lemuria atlantis and antarctica the
homes of three-eyed lizards and smiley bird people that can
really for really fly and they don't need no flashlights they are
enjoying truly tax free economies what fun we have travelling thru
time to tickle your not so funny bones and how goofy it'll all seem
when you finally get into our worlds that are so close and yet
so far i have a very good clue for your particle physicists
only they will be able to oo wa oo decipher wa oo wa it
there that's it now you can find your way back

Gyra is a Weird Dude

a hidden god
is a funny thing
his unknown input
and influence
leaving artists
scratching their heads

coordinating complex
musical arrangements
throughout the ages
making merriment
despite his pledge
of utter anonymity

an author of mind numbing
puns and synchronicities
that guarantee that
wonder and perplexity
will never be absent
while this age lasts

tweaking the prose of
apparently gifted writers
adjusting a few words
here and there for greater
impact hundreds of years
hence how strange

a time traveller before
knowledge of such modes
of conveyance dawns in the
imaginations of mortals
because of his relative
peacefulness he is able

to remain unimpeded by
the crush of things to
come and only past
the turning point does
he shed his skin and spring
forth as the conqueror he is

How We Grieve the Most High

we are more insensitive
to what God wants than
any other needy person
elsewhere in the cosmos

God needs us and don't
you wonder why?  has a
demon so firm a grip on
your leg that you can't

realize that we are the
thorn in God's side?  He
does love us very much
and wishes that we knew

how much He wants to let
us enter His Kingdom of
true peace and harmony
He is not a cruel nazi as

many of us imagine him to
be - His many regulations
and rules were meant to
help rather than hurt us

when we break His Laws we
grieve Him and He removes
His protection from us so
that we'll know how badly

humans need Him

I Will Shock You

i am a miraculously regenerative white blood cell
and i will not be mistaken for a disease
i will crush you and your hordes
with my antibiotic venom
ultimately you'll burn

you will suffer the deaths that your persecution
of the prophets of God warrants o yes
and your monkey servants will
eat the fat flesh from
your wicked bones

by now you should realize how much i hate you and
your stupid excuse for righteousness
that makes a mockery of the
limitless mercy of God
all of you will bleed

i created the ku klux klan as a racial safety valve 
and you will now learn the truth of what
you do not see you'd best be
praying to God to find
a way back home

because your sickening civilization is about to be
shaken to it's roots and phony baloney
slugs in our government will
return to their original
puddles of slime

yes i hate you and mama africa agrees with me she
knows how evil you really are and how you
puppet and abuse the minds of
the children of God until
they are soulless

your merchants will mourn and your trained monkey
entertainers will stop dancing as bombs go off
under their itchy rears; how exciting
it will be to see the righteous
nature of man restored

i hope that you think that it's funny because actually
it really is; if you'd adjusted your greed and
transmitted the right values to your
charges mister lincoln wouldn't
be weeping so profusely

Jojo from Ghana

have you
ever
gone to
a library and
pulled a random tome
from a shelf - or better yet
asked a stranger or a librarian for
a favorite book of theirs to read?  probably
not - if you had you might have eventually
met some wonderful new friends like
ashurbanipal tezcatlipoca diana
cimeres baron samadi
gudrun solomon
loki volo
isis osiris
merlin oomingmak
anansie black elk kukulkan
and many other beings that surely
were at least as much a concern to God as
we are
today
lucky
beings
that were
as worried for
the condition of
errant humanity as
we claim to be today and
some of them have darn good
ideas and plans for putting things right
they, God and jojo from ghana know what needs to be done

Lora Makes Me Brave

her apple-butter smile
makes me feel much less like
the dinner of a hungry insect mother
she's not just from the village of the wild rose

she is the wild rose
i will make sure that her mom
gets her back home before i begin to
lose my cool in this idiotic town of dumb duckies

her black shiny head is nearby

is getting out of control (
haven't you thought of anything yet,
sweetie?  oh, that's a good idea!) wait, let me
take them off (they are steel-toed, you know) here

foul creature, shove those
in your gaping maw, and take this box
of cheap plastic pink hands while you're at it; i
won't be needing them any longer (what else, my dear,

the loopy thing's still drooling
... ah, a guitar - gotcha; AND a stick of
dynamite!  let me kiss you silly!  [kiss noises]
light the stick; here goes the guitar) there you go, evil

beast, are you satisfied now?
(it stopped salivating, but it's mouth
is still open - is it lit?  give it here, i'm gonna
toss it up in it's mouth ... boy, that mouth is as big as a

friggin seven-eleven, isn't it?
here goes!  wait, it's finishing the guitar
strings ... whoa, this wick is burning down fast; i gotta
toss this thing, quick - here goes!) right in the kisser!  (let's

book!) clip clop clip clop clip clop
clip clop clip trip clip clop clip clop clip clop
(there, we're about a block away now, check it out!) ss
ssssssss ... urp ... kkkaabbboooooommm !!!  i love you lora

whoa, not a scratch - yikes, it's skittering this way!

and it's muttering darkly

Look for the Lost

i've just lost a sparkling jewel
perhaps it dropped into a pool
it quickly flew away somewhere
it once rode in an ethiop's ear

i've mislocated a lovely feather
hard to keep in stormy weather
she spun away up high mach schnell
might have dropped into a well

i can't find my frightened sheep
they need their rations and their sleep
their downy wool was primed to shear
the hungry wolf is what they fear

if you help me find these things
i will melt down golden rings
and crush pure carbon in my hand
to help prepare your promised land

My Dear Son Svastika

hark
beloved son
we lost that war
because it was wrong
the initial effort wasn't evil but
we were carried away by the id forces that
are always present in wars of territorial
expansion and colonialism the Lord
knows that what they were
doing (and what others
are doing now) was
(and is) wrong
but now
we just have to grit our teeth and let the next battle
begin we have been genetically programmed to be
defeatists for too long and our striving against
this has made the Lord disfavor us and deliver us
to our own methods of self-destruction this time we
will
try to
remain
calm and
sell them the
ropes for their
own foolish demise

No More Reruns

enjoy syndicated television and video products in general
because the time will come when invisible giant robots

will be sent by princess kuan yin to demagnetize all of our
electronic media and the vidiots and couch potatoes

will be spit out of luck as far as classic television shows
are concerned those mighty droids will bring much of

our american culture to a grinding halt and the internet
junkies will really be hurting bad some of them will not

be able to deal with it and will cope by committing suicide
those of us that have been unrighteously persecuted for

minor thought crimes will rejoice although some shows we
love will be gone forever we'll have the unparalleled privilege

of watching you destroy yourselves because the source
of your white slavery power will have been nicely demolished

i will laugh at you as your entire world crumbles and i will
especially enjoy the liberation of the psychological vassals

Random Laughing

happy and not knowing why
pleased as punch
because my debt has been paid
the only thing that bothers me
is that no memory of this madness
will persist past the dawn

brother caveman
warned me about africa
the caribbean and puerto rico
but judiciously omitted
mention of native american and
scandinavian ancestry and the
sins of those fathers however
i may be among the first in my line
to not hate God

the Lord has been kind and merciful to
me and mine and this is why i have vowed
to be honest with Him in all ways
two wrongs don't make a right
so now that things have come full circle
and i have the power i will refuse to wield it
for the benefit of the nation without
His prior approval i cannot bear the unrighteous
exaltation of unrepentant thieves such as
myself furthermore i see the sieve that has
been fielded for the straining of the sighted
from those that will be morally blinded

i and the departed etruscans and tasmanians
are making an italian dinner for the hungry
appalachians, ethiopians, ainu, eskimos, gypsies, indians
and others who have been denied the strength
to fight against the high-tech forces of
oppressive pagan activity

the arabs, russians, chinese, spanish, mexicans and cubans
are helping to set the tables
it's an ancient recipe
oon-poisonous
and nourishing
in a flammable way

soon all will be ready
and the guests will arrive
we'll sit down and say grace
praying for the strength of israel

and the destruction of babylon
our scary home with the crazy mom
that screams and beats us
for our own good

she will escape and so will we
and the mormons will take note

the japanese will be sputtering in their sake

Root Cellar

let's walk down where we cnn be alone
away from the honkies and their court jesters

they call us injuns and think we are dunces
but we'll show them that we can clown too

they don't know how much we hate them and
what they have done to our mother earth

they don't know where we are really from
and what we can do they laugh at the forces

of nature that only we can truly command
a gift that the Great Spirit gave us after

He allowed the invaders to spread across
the land He knew that we would need a secret

weapon to fight the horror of what they have
done to us and the earth the numskulls

they call us aliens and crowd us into ghettos
and barrios few of our people are represented

in their reindeer games because we don't like
being known as civilization whores so let's go

down to the root cellar and sing the ancient
songs that make their stupid people laugh they

will find out that the hopi tribe knew that the
true white brother will soon be here to judge us all

Shaking Hands with Aliens

they are the superior
civilization up in the clouds
(Jesus will fight against the dragon
and his angels and they will quite literally
be cast down to the earth i might be killed
for telling you that so bluntly or maybe not
because you won't believe it until you see
it for yourself see i do know some
important truths) and
on the moon yes
ain't too nice
a cia friend has
told me of photographs that
he has seen depicting gigantic mining operations
on the dark side of luna hawkwind and amon duul
and p-funk knew
of them and their
(hollywood knows
it well) games
before we got wind of such weirdness
via the internet that evil web of deception
will result in the persecution of many knowledge 
crazy people
many of them
will go insane
trying to make sense of the consequences of
their meddlings and shocked by the star struck
methods that the men in black use against people
that represent
a threat to their
important activities
they want the nation to
keep getting down so that
we will remain on their schedule for
mass destruction revelations will tell you all about
it this subject is classified so i cannot comment any further
(you are being advised to pay attention and keep your mouth shut)

Shucks

looks like we'll have to stay for the horror show
before our new world arrives well let's get it on
i always liked an adventure and i read the book

Shut Up and Wear Your Badge

we knew that you were coming to occupy our land
build your towers of cold stone and steel
we know how weak you really are
your slaves laugh at you
and prove our point
they know how
guilty you are
even though
there was a time
when you toiled under
our whips and if you continue
to ignore your God you will taste
our wrath once more in a most amazing
way why yes you will trick yourselves out of it all

Some Think Jesus Was Born Blind

i don't have time for you and you (coiled up and ready)
don't know me and how uncool i can be (to smite those that mock)
i'm a wanted man and known throughout the land (our Lord and)
like a checkered dog but no worries no none at all
(want to roadblock) because i'm a boola
(beauty and truth) changed man boola
(they are evil and hate love)
but i still despise sports and brainless
(useless bodies born to kill) foolishness because i know who
(some of them carry briefcases) likes such things
(from a sidewinding elevator) most of all and i the mackerel
(one without wings) have met him in his green and red
(sitting on an ottoman) skin with glowing eyes and
to me it ain't no big (good morning to mickey)
surprise
because i've been a woolly Christian
for millennia now and you can't kill
a man born to invisibly kill the killers
let the coneheads try they won't
have tongues to lick the righteous
wounds they're gonna get (we're sinners too and have no power)
yes threefold yes i (without our Lord's Grace)
have permission
to breathe fire
yes i'm in love with you darling i admire your dark hair
(remember our escape let's)
of course they will fail where have you been
(get it right this time ok)
and where are you going can
(Jesus is our Lord)
i go with you all right let's visit branson and
(we don't need the nice suits or studios)
then we'll go to utah they'll know what we mean
(we love you reverend billy graham)
and then back to utopia er chicago
(we have to do it good man they)
no actually i'm not hungry at all
(are getting far too machia)
no i'm not testing you i trust
(vellian and we must)
you implicitly of course i
(take action)
remember when you
(soon)
proved that you
have so many
skins my lovey
(Christians, please pray for us)

The Garden of Baja

we will begin the construction of our new world there i have prayed
to the Most High to allow us the opportunity for such a chance

He says it's alright, and now we have to imbue with sight the businessmen
and the mexican government and then our holy buildings will rise

there is where we will get the story straight and learn the real meaning of
the number eight and nine and the Bible and other holy books will leap to life

it has been made known to me that we may face a series
of frightening persecutions there, and could ultimately
relocate to the (of all places) peninsula of antarctica

or, if we are very lucky, the dry valleys

that will entail a whole new series of problems, involving
argentina, britain (our sponsors), and chile but with
luck and persistence we shall ultimately prevail

it has been made known to me that she will be there after
fully realizing the sorry plight developing around her, and
after she finds that we are immune and have the cure

certainly there will be strong conditions set for being allowed to remain
with us; the Most High will not allow us to become hypocrites by losing our
cool; we can't immerse ourselves in what we are fleeing from

but what we'll be sacrificing will be replaced with previews of the
wondrous age to come and we'll be safe from plagues and catastrophes (
and false miracles
) brought upon the fools that will be laughing at us

the eagle will be with us, and the lion, and the good gorilla (even the woozy
polar bear, who'll freak out upon meeting the penguins), and the elephant,
and we will be able to communicate with them, even play games - this will
make many of us cry constantly, but there's no need; we're all good

poor twits that doubt the mercy and power of the Lord
they will be overcome with grief and horror by what
they have tricked themselves into and we'll be safe
and free from guilt because we'll have warned them

these are some of the things that john wasn't allowed
to record in the book of revelations, proclaimed by the
wonderful angel of the seven thunders; yes, Christ is
returning, and much of the world is dwindling in error

including us, but we will be strengthened because of
our faith, and our familiarity with the disappointing
and misleading doctrines of demons and men; read the
Bible, and do your best to curb your flesh and lose your

foolish pride
we just might meet before it all begins

Their Brains Will Melt

rock and roll is gonna do it to you
funk and soul too
i have arranged it that way
you are being rapidly disassembled
because you want to kill my babies
and i won't let my babies be killed
even if they deserve it
you don't deserve another breath
of air or another day on God's green
earth
you walk all over me now
but soon so soon i will crush
your little skulls and your brains
will squish between my toes i shall wear
your gold filled teeth around my neck
if you don't want to be my victim
pray to Yahweh to be spared
He really is the arriving Lord Jesus

repent - for the time of redemption draweth nigh

There is No Way Out of This Gas Chamber

dumb donkeys why do you
allow yourselves to be
so easily deceived?

i feel so sorry for all of you
why can't you see the trap that the
devil has carefully prepared?

i have been given permission
to warn you because satan
knows that you will laugh at me
and ignore my prognostications

and those of my girlfriends

what's the use
i feel like something out of
a warner brothers cartoon
maybe if i shot some fire
out of my mouth
or flew up into the sky
you'd pay attention
but i can't do those things
yet

i have a feeling that you will slowly begin to
realize that you are messing around with
something very unpleasant that has been
here much longer than any of you

i am only a chit
one golden horn
my real soul is safe believe it or not
you are lucky that i know the truth of the matter

Twilight of the White Hare Worshippers

you laugh
because our mighty gods
have been reduced to
dried-up rabbits on the run

you build fancy homes
from the soulful planks
that you ripped from our
ancient and beloved ships

you hoard your gold
and sit atop the heap
pointing a crooked finger
at our miserably shivering crew

you mock our pointy hats
and rude clothing
they can't hold a candle
to your brooks brothers gear

we are showered with guilt
even though many of us have
been forced to migrate into the
lowly flesh of those we hate

we still love to make things
crash and burn up
though we now haven't the
nerve to promenade so

we nearly had you
suckers after our long
climb back from the hell
you gave us in the middle ages

we cry in silence for
the hardy world we once had
and the simple technicality
allowing your kind to take it all away

Wait 'Til Terry Finds Out

how would you
feel if you woke up one morning and realized
that there really are hidden worldwide conspiracy cults
that were based in your home town
and you had become a target for their
heinous activities and you went through the period of stress and
mental anguish that they'd so lovingly designed and
custom tailored for you and
what if you suddenly saw the light
and discovered how to beat them at their own
game and removed the unreasonable burdens that
they'd placed upon you and
turned their blasphemous and unconstitutional institution into the
scapegoat and left their silly priests and priestesses
with egg on their faces and returned
to them all
of the misery
that they'd
hoped you'd
enjoy
wouldn't that be cool?

it would

What Now, Gurdjieff?

ninefoldness is interesting
your writings are fascinating
but i have found mention of
you on restroom walls
and that isn't too cool

what have you done to us
and for what purpose - are
you assisting in the
gathering of the tares?

how mean!  we were raised to
believe that the Lord was coming
to save us, and now we find that
it's quite possible that we may
be whisked away to some world
of horror ala the missing doctor

i presume that you knew of the
hot pot that may await those of us
gullible enough to have swallowed
your philosophy over the years
you are working for the serpent
mister man, and now so are we

noodles in the wok we are but what
mystifies me is what's in it for you
did the fowls of heaven promise
you a bite or two at their spooky feast?

sure they did; I'll bet you've
already got your frilly bib tied on,
fork and knife in your feathery paws
these idiots down here really think
they're gonna fly free and some of us will

anyhow, what matters to me is how
many of us really make it back home
from this suicide arena - the only
solace i've found is your writings and
my crazy girlfriends we love you man

You Love It

look at the moose
tammuz
he's driving an expensive car with
666 license plates he thinks
it good

but it ain't
that ain't even it
just the warm up and the pitch
the bat is what it's really all about
and it's swing

he's late for the party
in his cool car
speeding along
the car is laughing at him
because it knows of the future
spin-out that will leave it unscratched
and him nice and dead

strike - and a stream of tobacco
juice hits the green grass
don't let it fool you

the car doesn't hate him
but it can't cry for him
the car wants
to go to the baseball game and watch
the miss america pageant and guess
what state doll is going to win
but it can't, and that really
makes it want
to cry more than the
moose's fate and the stupid plates
that don't mean a thing to it

stupid moose

would not swim with the sharks
or be ethnically cleansed he killed them all with psychic
bad vibrations he knew they would not repent of their
toothy iniquities he had permission from
the air realm above he was tired of
their dumb bunny concept of righteousness which would
prohibit him from enjoying more progeny and also
involved him sprawling listlessly on a japanese

hiding in the shadows who vexed
all of the dummies that dared

Combinations

after they'd taken
their unlawful journeys and seen
the hidden dimensions they decided to
completely usurp the entire orb because it was
there the secret cult of greedy world bankers and
advertising executives first consulted many superior
mathematicians living in southeast asia (they were the
only ones that had keys to the green doors excepting
a dangerous indian tribe in brazil who wouldn't dream
of giving them entry) and thereabouts (no desert
there but lots of it in the desert) they carefully
listened to the hairy space cadets in old
hokkaido found many hidden
items using finely
tuned particle
beam
devices
dallied and
danced with
dervishes and
doctors from many
boneshaking bordellos
watched flying dinosaurs
in namibia and determined the
relationship between egypt and
the north sea and that's how they
started their chicken wire chicanery
program of seriously messing around
with your grey matter strudel noodles
they were promised a world of their own

think
you're so cool
because you finally
got the chicks on your side
what's up pathetic lover of lies?
or would you prefer me to call you by

i will burn something in your
front yard and laugh
when you call
me insane
and
whine
about the
suffering of
your ancestors
they deserved their
misery just like you do i am
not your judge but i have my opinions
don't bother the Lord with your sickening excuses

Hanging From Henrietta

why should we walk on the pained backs
of the poor and unprotected for profit
and fame you know it ain't right to sell
your soul you know it
still mammon calls
why can't we show
real love to those that
really deserve it instead of
secretly poisoning and exterminating
them oh you say that it has to be done
else we'll be overrun well you may be
right but i hope that you have
consulted the Most High
because if it isn't
what He wants
i'll wager
that
we have
some serious
national suffering
to do happy little fascists
i'll keep on trucking because i know
that we are also scheduled for destruction
so you say i'm supposed to be a girl well that don't
flush with me you mechanically glorified hermaphrodites

hindu wizard wends his way

he mutters and peeps a funny sound
consult him not for he does lie
his wisdom cuts and then you fry
he tells us that to kill is good
upon the blaze he tosses wood

his cortex beeps with techie gear
and of his doom he has no fear
the reason why he has such clout
is very hard to figure out
although he knows that none can win
he shrugs and gives the wheel a spin
so if you're sane and prone to vice
and flowers and fruits of paradise
lurk not near his fiery gaze
for he'll elude you in the maze

perched high in a tree
trilling for joy
to all that they see

dolphins jump high
on a clear blue day
no cares on their minds

they run to the sun
dust floats from their tracks

alone in tall grass
cool wind blows your hair
a smile on your face
i wish i was there

flygirl flygirl
why did you leave me?
wasn't i stupid enough for you?
did all of the nonsense finally begin to make sense?
you aren't
scared of them
you can't be
they made
sure that you wouldn't be frightened upon return
so where did you hide yourself
this time?  under the
couch?  on

the top
shelf?  come on
it's no use your horns are
showing i see you and all three of your
tiny heads get up we have a maintenance schedule
and so many heavy things to bring up from the sub-basement

Kosher Kindness

i've placed my whittle finger right
to stay the bugsy wave tonight
the tiny digit knows the score
and trusts me to protect the floor
for if i wasn't brave to use it
you be surprised how quick we'd lose it

i've seen you snarl i've seen you snap
because of karl and all his crap
his written words are in the millions
fanatics piled up past a billion
and not a one that likes your kind
a noose for you they'd love to find

in spite of your bright yellow hue
they want to make a shade of you
you dropped the righteous holy way
and called on beasts to fight the ray
pushing forth a demon's cup
yourselves is what you're screwing up

forgiveness is a simple task
try it while you wear a mask
now we're past the laughing vipers
it's time for them to pay the piper
for all the harm they have contrived
vengeance from above arrives

things that jump from spooky books
boiling pots and many cooks
haunting wicked website games
culminate in hellish flames
unfortunate how they've not learned
their malice only gets them burned

Laws of the Lawless

listen to leaders but plan their demise
party with fools but honor the wise

reconcile clowns of pleasure and pain
confound the clueless glass bead game

dull every safe sense to elevate smell
baffle the bourgeois with a spoonful of hell

learn all your lines but burn up the stage
to feed an animal put your arm in the cage

Lest He Smite

for noble and true posterity
you'll shun the fun geography
wonder and will for what is right
will bless you with the final sight

our children have the crisis switch
to call the wrath of one great witch
who knows the truth of all the games
and truly has prepared the flames

so if you cannot heed the call
of all for one and one for all
stones that fly inside the school
will lead us to that truthful rule

toys or the bugeyed auspex
halcyon vistas replace
the sleek gangster jostle
the bestial chartreuse
shadow of turning
is silenced

Merry Mechanics

a fairy tale of woe to tell
of merry work that's done in hell

to cheat ourselves out of our lease
we beat the elves with pails of grease

and curly shoes and pointy ears
who early come to oil the gears

and beams and buttons of the one
machine that glistens in the sun

they tweak the dials and knobs aplenty
it's leaks are plugged with penny candy

they smear the salve upon it's chassis
rub clear until it's gleam is glassy

labors done they eat their honey
mechanical fun is looking bonnie

their mother nature is replenished
but where their task of joy is finished

is the same place where they fall
when the toy destroys them all

it rears up on one fiery leg
and doesn't hear the wee folk beg

for pardon as their fate is sealed
the warden of their jail revealed

a fight they cannot win for fame
for sprites they know no other game

Nazifarianism

o
my
baby
flexing
her right
to stretch
the eternal
story to test
the souls that
claim to know a
version of truth
but cannot send
it to work we stay
ragged for the time
being soon we will be
softly smiling while the
puppets dig their graves
in the electronic fast lane
lovely faith of moral purity
protecting frightened ones
death to the corrupt system
that is enslaving the minds of
honest men we are taking the
angst out of order and the fear
out of chaos we have annexed a
true new world to this sssss age
come join us friends while you can
we know how worried you are and i
am not lying when i say that i repent

Nettlesome Zero

i am your protector for now
i know what is being done and
i won't allow it to fully blossom
i'd rather see this nation utterly destroyed
than idly stand by and allow totalitarian rule
and total moral decay to prevail
i have the real secrets that
can quickly turn the tables
i am sharing some of them
the profit lusters and their
advanced versions of
a technocratic hell
won't get far
it will not
happen here
guaranteed
if i can
convince you
to cooperate

Noah's Transmission

i'm gonna talk about things that you don't wanna hear
i'll say this very carefully and hope that it's clear
i'm sure you're all concerned about a nuclear war
but wait until your hear about what will come before

economic chaos is what we have to face
cash will be devalued at a very rapid pace
riots in the cities people shooting everywhere
energy and water shutoff add to the despair

these are just a few things that will soon come to pass
and if you don't believe me well then you're just an ass

bringing you guys down like this it ain't very nice
so now i'll make it up to you by giving advice

keep your brain off tv dancing movies and jive
work hard and save your money if you want to survive
keep your earnings out of banks or you will be poor
buy pure gold and silver coins their prices will soar

weapons and a vehicle you'll need close at hand
away from urban centers is where you should buy land
people they may laugh at you hoot giggle and bark
but people laughed at noah while he calmly built his ark

Nonagonal Hetaera Heuristica

i have watched over you ceaselessly even when
you made your stupidest moves
blackheart purty kitty
your eyes glow
in the dark
but it don't scare me
because i know your true colors
and how you were before your condemnation
how kind and creative you were how this evil situation
warped your sensibilities and made you run
for your gun we will make it out of
here my mouse yes we will
put on your armor
scraggly girl

Noone Repents

music soothes and combs your hair
invites you to the county fair
where schlubs in frills will roll the dice
and practice every tricky vice

wheels and deals and sinful wages
beasts that rattle their golden cages
noone knows the jolly elf
inside the home of hate itself

swift round shapes soar over roofing
clomping steps on cloven hoofing
they learn to use the sideshow ways
and run those rats inside their maze

the price of fame unholy game
gamblers try to stake their claim
to fortune smiling like a gun
bestowed upon a hopeless one

and when they sell and wish you well
they really smell you chained in hell
fire and lace and engines driven
the foolish face can be forgiven

Of One Blood

our desire for the peaceful union
of the tribes of man
cannot be
achieved by human
hands yes we are doomed to fail
gene manipulation
of sapient
scientists won't do
the trick only our gardeners can
fuse man correctly
according
to the record of the
soon to be glorious future world

Origin and Destiny

the valor of the strong determines

our final decisions will
ultimately be in your favor because
every stick has two ends and guilt far worse
than yours will kick in eventually nevertheless we will
go out fighting for our people while you whisper about our way

Pilot Light

blood words finally decided to be honest for a spell
he wants to be best man at our wedding
said he'd show up over the lake
it would be odd lady luck
and somehow i
believe
that
it might
not be a lie
because i prayed
to the Spirit for us to
be reunited and even though
you have moved into a new body i can
tell that it really is you i remember the giant
writing instrument the blue chair cage with the griffin
trapped inside and all of the insanity that we discovered when
our lives were one where did you dwell after jetting from your last
flesh and how is she feeling now without you and me probably
crummy surely she's forgotten the mothership and what
the mission is she wasn't very strong even though
her mom sure was trying to help her out as
best she could cuttlefish crystals
and the flickering phnntasms
from britain and the
other islands
left her

Plight of the Gibborim

ancient child from the age of gods
made meals of men and threw up clods
of peaty earth when challenged by
the human scourge that couldn't fly

they crept at night to seal his fate
their target locked against the slate
his hoary head was fast asleep
inside his bed the valley deep

such tiny men that ran from him
who'd fancied that they'd tan his skin
for when he stomped the whole earth shook
and every fish flipped from it's brook

he smashed them one he smashed them all
and after dining retched his gall
his honor could not lose it's hue
his cause of no concern to you

Poor Old Tired Horse

those wooly elephants they sure ain't pink
what passed today tomorrow don't think
no sir it no longer means a thing
to the sad old horse that danced in the ring

Praxis Generatrixor

far too bold for any kitten
wonder book that can't be written
it tells the tale from start to finish
the souls of men it would replenish
it doesn't leave a truth untold
the cycles of the world unfold
in ways that make a baby smile
and learned men reflect awhile
upon the goodness of all things
true mastery of spacetime brings

Quidnunc Cabaret

organized satanists

all of the evil spirits that have

Rara Avis

thoughts of space
and disks aglitter
sent shivers through
the human critter

and so he searched
for answers to
the puzzles of
the great gazoo

but when he chanced
upon some works
that detailed all
the future's quirks

the questing lad
soon found himself
enmeshed in
warps of time itself

his dreams of
giving mankind hope
for something past
mad future's rope

were dashed to bits
he wouldn't mock
the curtains of
the tempo clock

to look beyond
forbidden doors
was no big deal
or worry for

such a frail
and fitful guy
it really was
no wonder why

he pondered on
that final twist
for after all
they do exist

Reh (No)

an oracular medallion

admired it is
unlike the gluttonous
garbage disposal
that is really more than ignored
'tis abused
positive ok or not
a cretin throws away
a banana peel
without even thinking about the act
what if souls were
inside of these things
that are not
generally respected?

Rita Says It's Alright

rita says she loves us
but i won't play her game
she runs with other fellas
to one confusing dame

the lady loves to travel
river road or rail
a judge he bangs his gavel
to finalize the sale

and when they all go sailing
inside the dusty halls
the echoes of their wailing
are heard behind red walls

so if you're fond of fortune
and all that it entails
rita's roller torture
will startle your entrails

Run From the Sun

run run
run from the sun
electric black shadows
gotta run run run

stranded on a planet where the bad ones are made
laughing and dancing as the good guys all fade
emotional tornado spins your mind to the sky
some days all you can do is just hope to die
the light is getting brighter
it's getting hard to see
if i'm flowing with the glowing
or is that shadow me

See

i can help you to see
for the first time
it scares some
timid people
although
there's no
need to fear
it is weird holding
this hot torch
you're gonna
need to cope
with what
i mean
now
is the
time when
your eyes
will be opened
to my ways of
life and liberty
and why things
have drifted
away from
goodness
i don't want
those spiky
thorns in
my crown
to pierce
li'l old
me

Silver Pods in the Clouds

when i died
went for a ride
a life beyond this
was shown to exist

and as i sat upon a bed
madness whirling in my head
the kumbayah they sang my name
and flashed outside the windowpane

they smiled and told me to take heart
and showed me much of hidden art
planned out all my future wit
when i left a gloomy pit

precious life twist
listen to the grist
love is for all
pray to call

Spiritual Garbage Can

old london lost her colonies for lack of empathy
children live in refuse bins in a land of tax usury
lust for lucre drove the haushofer crowd puck
and we live under the sword of cultural usufruct

dwelling upon destruction makes hypocrites lie
national courage wanes and noone knows why
periphrasis becomes the norm when love chills
no care for those that suffer for cheap thrills

i know how much sooner the future will arrive
if all of the workers stand to defend the hive
long after brilliant flames ignite the dusky lake
life will exact a terrible price upon her stake

Sunshine Where There is None

a captious capon curses
my crusade against the whimsical plans they've made
of fairy magic and black cigars and
one way rides on shooting stars
i lose myself in reverie
rejecting wholesale
misery i have no time
for the vertex of the vortex
your swirling doom is what i seek
far away my love and i will sneak a peek
as your gyring sun finally delivers his cargo of fun
to lovely lowbrow nurses

The Language of Satanism

inversion is the key to understanding
why you have been presented with a degree
rhyme and reason intertwined
symbolic meaning of words rather
than literal although often both
are present and cooperative
also the nature of complexity (in
this arena) will bring the messengers nigh
because truly a complex mind is a weak mind
the aching achilles heel of western civilization is
pride based on massive amounts of acquired information
we are top heavy and ripe for destruction for we rely
on many vain doctrines of demons yes most of
man's highly touted wisdom has arrived via channel zero
so what should we do
to insure our physical and spiritual safety?
to hold back the floodgates of demons?
to stay sane and happy?
talk to your Creator
He does communicate
you haven't noticed
repent of your sins
and do not despair
you can still dance
sincere prayer to God really does help and heals
all effects of institutionalized generational evil
albeit (sometimes) conditionally
you will never know unless you
try to fight your lust greed
etcetera oh and your
fatal diet of puns
even my acquaintance satan knows the truth

The Ones That Know

formed our race
helped us grow
soon we'll face
the ones that know

on this blue ball
we stage our show
observing all
the ones that know

evils growing
hearts are low
what are we showing
the ones that know?

world peace ain't coming
'til our lawn we mow
our gardeners are coming
the ones that know

The Serpent's Lament

coat check boat wreck
ninety-nine times same
corner block pop rock
ice cream eating game

assumption consumption
greedy feet to score
conjunction confunktion
daydreams of a whore

platitudes of gratitude
but noone is content
economy dichotomy
the serpent will repent

Then K U

history's example shows us nothing but war's hell
cutthroat
few and far between have been the beacons of light
losing our footing on the planet we walk on
tightrope
modern day problems blow the old ones out of sight

Too Many Bastards

all our efforts
they have failed
to fix the scum
that we have jailed

when set free
jail term done
their life of crime
has rebegun

they'll rape your mother
they'll rape your wife
they'll torture you
and take your life

noone cares
noone's wise
not until
they're victimized

KILL - their mindless creed
DEATH - to them and their breed
HATE - they all project
OUR FATE - we shall protect

we've got the pill
to cure this sick
we're gonna kill
those bastards quick

degenerates
are on the run
i'll blow them down
with my gun

protect yourself
save your life
from the fire
of their strife

hear it out
hear the plea
survival is
your golden key

When Mars is Revealed

love
consider
the possibility
of a distant world

very populated and just teeming with
human culture and industry
quite different from our
sorry and trampled
old orb what if
we found
that
it
is
real
and much
closer than we
realize how would we
react to the very strangest
and most disturbing news of the
age if at long last mars was revealed

i have been there
and it ain't no

Where is My Wife

recall lost through anesthesia
is the worst part of amnesia

i'm searching for my former wife
i lost her in another life

i know she knew of bells and spells
flowery fields and fragrant smells

she also had uncanny wiles
o'er birds and beasts and crocodiles

the lords of this world know my plight
and want to keep her from my sight

but still i search and when i find her
i'll calmly creep up right behind her

wrap my arms across her chest
spin her round embrace her breast

it's been a long time since i kissed her
she may have been my only sister

World of Whores

people out there
every night they're
hunting love in clubs
a sexy dance
kick-starts romance
inside these passion pubs
a motel room
sweet honeymoon
soon they're on all fours
don't you see
we're living in a
world of whores

the sexual revolution is a pack of lies
body and soul diseases in disguise
discipline and honor they have locked their doors
can't you see we're living in a world of whores

yuk it up silly pup
you won't be laughing
when the skin is chafing
from your pubis that's covered
with pus-filled lumps

Would You

would you die
for a lie
and make peace
with your id
as you did
flip your lid?
count your damnings
kiss the sky
fly your
frilly freak flag
high
o my i
feed my sins to
the pit bull
christ critter
call the cosmic
bambi sitter whose
razor of love will shave
my psychic stubble away down
the drain and i don't need my fitful
brain pain is lusting for the insane goal
of law and order in the court countdown
decade will smash that flat splat but every
cloud has that gleaming shining scheming
sheen inbetween the days of doom drama
yell for your mama and she will be there
the end is fair it's au contraire if you
don't sow sour seeds to reap
sweet fruit what goes
around

comes around

Yacub

translucent eleemosynary sorcerer
dependant on the odd law of free will
who lovingly fashioned
pathologically analphabetic
creatures of blue doom
provided the same with
bits of bird and dog and goat and left
them their crafty pygmy brains
decided against the aqua hue
gave them what most of us
deem a fetching pinkish
cast and didn't forget
to leave some curl
they drank from
lustrous saucers of ambrosial milk poured down in
a forgotten valley
of the antediluvian age
yes he juggled their fuzzy androgens
pointing downward he bid them adieu
across the fresh desert they went
ignoring the peculiar beekeepers
gesticulating north of the shoe
(another series of gallant golems
would sack that beaky brood)
onward went the jolly orchestra
castrating mucks that stood in their way
stopping only when progress was blocked
by the shore skipped their saucers across
the foamy depths some were overcome by
such beasts as like to live in the brew the
coterie would often promote a mad hag
to the head of the set sometimes quite
against their better judgment this did
help them to charm sea monsters
who abandoned their secret
tasks to help tow the
troglodytes to
their home

it is possible that they will attempt to relocate
near the ancient city of babylon to be closer
to the restrained euphrates demons
that they are so

that
is what they are really secretly

Captain Fiery of the Morning Moon

and by my beard i've got a whale of a tale to tell
pass me that snifter of brandy

although i've romanced maidens on rocky shores
and chortled in the company of knaves and whores
thieved with the best of 'em and killed quite a few
i'm a fairly grave man and simple too

nothing could stop me
quake i did not
even when the foulest squall of all salted my ship
quite nicely
the bilge filled with the briny brew
of dead mens' bones and codfish too
it was raining razor blades
down we went and up a zot
but steer i did and we did not
pitch and toss to a bubbly doom
though we were forced
to dump our precious cargo
overboard
chains and all
we moored ourselves
at dawn
and as the storm wended southwest
the magenta sun
finally poked his portly frame above
the horizon
our crew cheered
mad alana my first mate even cracked a smile
although we were all sore
about the loss of our irons
we went about our business
of securing the vessel
suddenly I realized with a start
that what we had previously thought
of as our familiar light-bringing star
wasn't at all the blessed char
but a brightly shining sienna moon
the wonder of it
had the men gaping in awe
and stranger still
it was wearing a big top hat
and carrying a cane

it began to dance a gyring jig
across the morning sky
and then swung low around the starboard bow
singeing our sails with tendrils of lunar fire

and on the sweet head of my home port love
that bloody orb began to ululate
in unearthly caterwauling tones
then it removed it's dusty crown and spoke

everything spun from one sun and
where it comes from is where it goes to

was what it uttered and no more than that
'twas more than enough to lay us flat

after the flaming moon donned it's brim
every man began to battle his mates
to the death with whatever implements
of destruction were found within reach
some with their bare clenched hands

the deck quickly ran red with
the freely spilt blood of those
that were overcome by the carnage
which was every chap on board
just beyond four score
good blokes they were to the bitter core

only three of us survived the zany fray
up to the crow's nest we'd crept away
myself
my first mate
and my african gray parrot thor

zounds i say

the last of the mad warriors keeled overboard
after smashing himself in the head with a
scrying stone and chopping his left hand's
fingers off with cutlery from the galley

then the loony apparition winked at us three
and the good bird's plumage turned white as can be
my mate and i both got burns on the nape of our necks

then all became still
and the moon was sucked back below the
horizon until the sky was pitch black
no stars at all
for several hours
we sat with the chill wind whistling wildly about us
and thor squawking quietly to himself
we knew at last that it was all over
when the true sun finally appeared
after we gingerly clambered down
behold - there was no trace left of the
melee that we had witnessed scant hours before
none of the blood or gore no disarray
just missing men

with heroic difficulty
we steered the schooner to our destination
and found that particulars relating to our cursed
excursion had been wholly forgotten
the names of every man on board
why even all of their relations were missing
it was as if they'd never been

mad alana no longer had stomach for the seafaring life
she stepped on shore and went home to her crazy wife
the only toll it's taken on me is how my hair has gone gray
i tell you boys
i can name every one of those lost men to this very day

Death of the Nameless One

life and love for pennies skinny
if you chain your mind up vinny

bright sunrise breakfast served
a great surprise nation swerved

of fields of fear and rivers of mace
i sing quite clear of fire and lace

a life of craft and vain despair
the odor wafts throughout the air

lowest nailer in wicked slum
silly sailor who's time has come

western grieving duly pending
even steving grievous ending

Enunciating Urchins

beautiful and noble
free spirited strings of symbols
celebrating festivals of etymological insanity
stepping to the square dance of happy doom
googols of scrawlings
almost as many as stars
every word has a wealth of
startling secrets and bijouteries
uniquely it's own
tugging at our weary minds
their many shades
of meaning often seem
alarmingly contradictory
vague and foreign secondary
tertiary etcetera hook and eye
associations stomp ruthlessly on
ad infinitum defying the categorical
imperative they poke fun at us mock us
yes they do and there is a good reason
why anxious to eternally preserve
their independence
from vain humanity
they have conspired
to effect the death
of punctuation

apostrophes can stay

Germinating Lese Majesty

i have many more bushy heads where that one came
from cut one off and three more will grow back keep
hacking every spineless slug that has
rolled my way winds up wishing
they hadn't those who won't
leave my children alone
will learn the hard way
i am the righteous serpent of luminosity
brilliant and winged
do you believe that you can defeat me?
working for order
rather well read
licensed to kill
satanic nuts
keep away
dummies
or i will
whirr
how
i do
go
on

Hell Sweet Hell

pit of hades
a dim grey place
infinitely gravitous
darkly incandescent
where all tethers to
our merciful God
are detached i
want you people
to believe me because
i have actually been there
lonely and unpleasant
beyond description
you don't want
to go there
i was fortunate
enough to have
been slated for
rescue but you
might not be as
lucky be kind to
people and turn
from all iniquity
try as best you
can or soon that
will be the very real
end of your false sense of
worldly freedom reevaluate your
doubleminded thinking processes

I'll Walk Them Home

such exciting times
plug ugly pachyderms
costumed as magistrates
frolic with glee at the
unholy hippodrome bonfire

poets sputter florid verse
consulting the icon crow nick
eyes aglow he squawks
always less fattening
when properly fricasseed

the ghoulish metropolis topples
fission fungi squeal in shock
as their criminally selig
intestinal cathedral of styx
forgets the flood and ignites

seaweed psychosis and
supertramp sensibilities
discreetly destroy each other
the depraved foundation
was all for naught

In the Offing

every man has friendly ways
and dreams of something past the haze
of never ending good and evil
clashing in their ways medieval

human woe and murky frets
make him search for safety nets
but when the cords that would protect
do not hold his hopes are checked

breaking bread with sneaky souls
seeking peace but finding coals
makes a good man dream of death
and puts a rattle in his breath

older folks console the grad
assure the lad he's not been had
it's just the wicked way of want
before it gifts it must needs taunt

Isaac and the Tooth Fairy

lily of the valley
crash course teacher
insolence personified
burdened with life everlasting
didn't want to serve the fuzzy bums
her endless sundownings and
fiery fury at God for destroying her
beautiful ancient sphere
of stupendous celestial splendor
continue
why it was blasted to smithereens
still the gudgeons look to it's spotty remains
with profit on their minds
scratching their hairy faces
their primitive modes of travel poised
she pauses to laugh
and then carefully considers
all of the new beginnings she has witnessed
she fondly remembers canaan
and how well he bore the mantle of the serpent
for another man's preposterous act of indecency
that tainted the world anew
and how she flew to him
with love and understanding
and all of her knowledge
but he coldly rejected her
to his utter chagrin
she laughs again
and then begins to weep
for she doesn't hate the Lord
in fact her activities are very important to Him
this she knows very well
but why did He have to curse her with isaac?

Le Mat

master dragonslayer eheieh
is
yay
here
death
for the
vacuous
death cult
looms near
woe to the irretrievably wicked
seriously folks
we're going on a
world class super
kite tech witch hunt
to prune the shrubs of blasphemy
down to mere stumps you
and your imaginary friends are
being targeted pray for those that are
too stupid or saturated with hate to heed these
words stay humble and you just might be spared

Plutonic Snafu

my genius son
inquires as to why
the wicked prosper
while gnashing his
gold filled teeth
it's really quite
simple dear
boy i tell him
of the gravity
of lies the burden
of mad desire and
the enchanting
illusion of
human
imagination
also known as
maya still he balks
and quails it is not
easy to soothe
his frazzled
nerves his
knuckles
clench
and blanch
white as we
sit with our
uprooted
amigos
in the
smoky
jazz room
sipping exotic
liquor we discuss
impossible things like
reformation of the mind
and soul without miracles
as billie sings of the moony
atmosphere at the midnight
waterfront we quietly begin
to consider the long journey
homeward where soft pillows
and nodding heads will triumph

i
am
very
happy
with this
life many of
my weird perceptions
are being justified i now am certain
that there really will be horrendous race riots in our
major metropolitan areas before a
thermonuclear batlle
begins my poor
misguided
country
thinks
that
i am

you fools
are fighting a petty psionic war against mighty beings from
the future
we have no tricks up our sleeves
just the confidence that arises from our memory
of the future defeat
that you and
your pathetic forces
will suffer further down the ifalong
there is only one true happentrack
this is a sort of
jail where we
suffer for the crimes
that we have committed in the future past
your main error is your simple
and extremely limited
view of the great
process of
universal
unfoldment and
reunion of souls we are
stronger than you here in this jail
and you'd be well advised to leave us be
because we have been given emergency command over
many of your
so-called
intellectual
circles and dear earthlings
you haven't seen anything yet please
read the book
it isn't joshing you at all you don't have
the ability to recollect the world before
this one or others in the
long succession of planets of life
that have been
bestowed

mortals

have drawn the last straw
their imagination and dedication matter not

are absolutely absurd
they seek to overthrow

disgusting satanists
they will be stopped
we have the solution
we see the source
of their sick power
and know where
they are clustered
conspiracies with fallen angels
and zombie lackeys
fueling the engine of death
we know the horrible truth
the infernal dynamics
have been clarified
their age old plan of
so called illumination
and all it's forthcoming
fantastic manifestations
in the real world
will not destroy
our Lord's Salvation
depending on
how we react
to what should by now be obvious
our civilizations will be forgiven
or allowed to utterly degenerate
He
and we
that love Him
will have the last laugh

Stone Sheet Shears

lady luck a sword in hand
serpents fall throughout the land

weary of her well known ground
looks upon the sunset sound

skips across the deep blue sea
ship of fools arrives with glee

able gang of boys and men
questing on in search of yen

what the house is looking for
leads them to the nether shore

those that they call indians
bide their time as land grows thin

for they know of the spores
that will kill the conquerors

vixen vice wife of scratch
bright and pure she met her match

now she works for the reds
parents of the blood she shed

and it was so swiftly done
that is how the west was won

The Fountain of Shur

lovely hagar doesn't know
what her labor's waterflow
and silver moon will bring to light
far beyond her birthing night

children hit the sand dunes running
full of sparks and manly cunning
they live a rough nomadic life
and soon their tribes are torn by strife

battles fought from dusk 'til dawn
victims slain from prince to pawn
clashing swords and bloody threads
chieftains raising severed heads

their weaker sons they soon weed out
and cast them off without a doubt
that desert sun and lack of water
will surely make them vultures' fodder

the booted brood soon pass their test
by moving north and east and west
to many nations where they station
they bring their fathers' civilization

minds alive with plans and mappings
they relish life and all it's trappings
building is their greatest pleasure
halls that heap with piles of treasure

craftsmanship and golden fleece
refining arts of war and peace
surveyors of the swath of three
the birthplace of democracy

cities rise and cities fall
hagar's clan helped build them all
her pains endured were rough enough
good thing she's made of tougher stuff

The Lovelife of Monsieur String Kitty

i love her more than my string
(her girlishly dark ways make me stupid)
i'm silly as can be
and poor so
i scramble
claws clicking
and bring back little things
(hoping she'll like them)
like tiny pink flowers
tufts of cotton wool
bits of sandworn blue bottle glass
those weird big beetles
that buzz your face on hot summer nights
and beady eyed field mice
whiskers twitching
she happily receives the gifts her mind floating elsewhere
and loves me in return
by carefully puncturing my expectant heart
(i have a big ego and it takes a lot to phase me)
not a lot of you realize what i mean
let me tell you
she flings frisbees over cliffs
canines chase them
(i am no dog but i have been watching closely i am clever)
and often suffer very real
plummeting deaths
but not me thankfully
because i have a secret
still her mean spiritedness hurts
i'm more in love with the idea of her
than who she is in person
poor me she thinks
that i want to take something away from her
(that is why she is cruel)
i don't i am very giving
i get upset thinking of it
no i love her still
but i'll have my dreamy revenge
i might surprise her
by arriving unexpectedly
in the body of a small grey mammal
(that just might bite her toe)
on a cloudy autumn day
(we both like clouds and know what they are)
as she sits upon a sprouting oak stump
she'll kick at me
until she realizes who i am
and how i've cozily curled up
in the minds of all of her best friends
smelling of tuna and cream
i helped birth great ideas
gave kind advice like an elderly babysitter
(she's not a good listener)
i'll let her out of my alert mind
she really does love me and thanks very much
knows me from allegro non troppo
despite all of my frustration
how lucky i am!

Trilateralism Revealed

wake up
the miracles of satan begin with word magic nonsense
intricate riddles and puns
that intrigue vain materialistic minds
dividing and conquering
by capitalizing on competitive fear
and cultural iconoclasticism
graduating to mental retention
of infernal images and icons
that debase the higher faculties of reason
and subliminally encourage degenerate activity
inverting and convoluting logical thinking
percolates mass insanity yes it does
by elevating matter over mind
muslims and mormons and masons and catholic red carpets
lucifer laughs at them all
because he is preparing the ultimate slaughter
your safety is being seriously threatened
doxy minded westerners pay attention
or you will suffer the dire consequences
occult strongholds are orchestrating
the ultra eastern phenomenon
russia egypt china india arabia japan etcetera
the rotational purposes of the tao
are very difficult for materialistic folks to truly grasp
the ugly tug of war betwixt strife and peace
will eventually assault your physical well being
the mental burdens become spiritual chains
that force should not be underestimated
it will casually beat the stuffing out of you
that's one of the ways that the nazis
and other big time death cult organizations
quashed resistance and brought about radical political change
they sever the protection of God from the population
that they seek to control
by any means necessary
phantasmagoric amusements are spiritually deadly
ignore what the masses are dwelling on
shun them if need be
when the show kicks into high gear
it will become more than real
unbelievable events will precipitate
the fantastically advanced technology
and strong delusions
particularly human flight
will completely deceive many
art and life will fantastically intertwine
minds will be entranced and enmeshed
extract yourselves now if you want
permanent employment in the universe
remember the promises of God
His gifts are free
you may have to suffer and die
for the privilege of escaping the fires of hell
it is definitely worth it
endure to the end
and i will see you in court

Twisturnot

she's very pampered and spoiled
my robotic bird
she whirrs in from
(in reverse order)
that bleak outer world
she resembles the mothers of two old chums of mine
(neither of whom i ever spoke with often)
my enemies are her friends and vice versa
but none of that matters
because of the fiendishly orchestrated
recursive purposes for which we were created
even fools have holy work to do
she doesn't even get it yet which is tits
(are you listening?)
doesn't read much anymore
but considers herself well informed
and she is
sort of
i will leap and hop
(no bouncing)
when twisturnot finally remodels her
(my only real friend besides God dogs and fleas)
she does need that new chip
nine nine nine
(it could be a very silly place)
actually binomial expansion
isn't her bag
nor mine no
not at all
she'll finally recall
all of what is being done
and how we are changing the world
(without another invasion)
for the better
utilizing our truly superior technology

Voyage of the Unknowns

compressing the clockwise winding twirl
to the moment of now's sacred swirl
shows rivers of time as one great sea
unravelling ripples of history

where our world is another once was
cultured and full of flourishing buzz

(as regards that grand orb's spire
another nest egg spun still prior
a noble race but bumblers still
lack of law their bitter pill

their sordid tale reads like a thriller
in fact it might seem quite familiar
to those of us that live in books
and know the ways of ancient cooks)

when their shield began to fall
they hedged their bets and risked it all
employed a force that they'd just found
and sailed through time on wings of sound

they fled their drying civilization
in search of terran restoration
of what they called security
the natives found did not agree

for though their clothing seemed quite rude
their women coarse and manners crude
there was no doubt they too were men
although they wound up in a pen

when the new arrivals landed
gleaming ships that now were stranded
due to ire of homeworld mystics
they carried sets of flawed logistics

and so in time they sadly learned
the buccaneers could not return
to bring the good news of their find
fresh water food and peace of mind

bursting eddies of swift light swings
birthing worlds for training things
that snuff the air and count their yen
and dare to call their children men

Amaranth of the Gyrfalcons

topaz empress of ethereal beauty

predating the cult of the moll
finest child of a forgotten black continent

preserved on cave walls
before the shift of the poles
her fluid dance of life entrances

chaste weightless and pure
free of sorcery and shackles of guilt
a bulb of radiance soothing hysteria
no ancestral sins needing nullification

she does not hate herself
for there is no folly of man
she elevates the weak chastens the strong
and slays the obscene
an accomplished scientist bringing dreams to life

communicating with orders of beings unseen
allied with truth justice and beauty
transgressors of the law are checked
dark mother rejoices
and helps her future cause
knowing the reasons why

Bloodworm Baltimore Frenchfry

wait a while woman
don't be so vastly vain
consuming cold fire omen
cannot amp your pain

cyclic apex curve and sink
inner image fossils wink
atomic comic boomtown hurt
return to union death alert

lovely weather picture show
predator logic onward ho
eyes aglitter burning building
children hail violent yielding

woman precious coal
longing for the tall pine
spiritual home is my goal
your palace or mine?

Bravo America

another bun from the oven of unum
launchpad of lunacy
birthplace of bombasticity
home of the huddled masses
flippantly finding fault with everyone
ever and anon
starting over
where saints have a past
and sinners a future
your secret capital is known
and your formulas for world control
upside down endless struggles
of fate and will
chikka chikka go the crickets
corpulent decadence swells
oofy oozers oiling their onomatopoeias
freedom under new knowledge is what they call
their sordid initiation into surrealism
melancholy harpies wait for their share
as the crocus grows
invisible credit card amulets gleam
slap happy satanists date themselves
itty bitty teeny tiny rave mouse skin bird
takes a tinkle wham sizzle bam blap plop boom dirt nap
aim of the mad push joust era now moves to war
tobacco potentate stubs out his cigarette
and sips peculiar wine
nake no totice it is of co nonsequence

Closed Doors

take a peek at the retrogressive toga party
being thrown by the internationalist enemies
of free speech they unrighteously shut down
individuals for minor infractions by thrusting
hapless victims into spiritual isolation rooms

emotional pain resulting from the tenebrous
hypocrisy of sinful beings with political and
educational advantage acting as gods and
damning the good people of faith to a new
dark age of gruesome fascist oppression

entraining brain waves with the assistance
of next step nanotechnology synchronizing
ideas words images events to a disastrous
crescendo and ensuring that the necessary
destructive work of their evil empire is done

Death of the New World Order

you disgusting satanic flunkies
of the western world
are all doomed
you are wholly unrighteous
even satan hates you
your witchy poo
doggie in the window
gorilla for sale games
are ending the
inquisition has begun
your godless sodomite world
of oral anal ah so material increase
is swiftly crumbling away
we are not stupid
we are not sold
we are shutting you down for good
it is best for all concerned
including yourselves

know that your demonic lackeys
are bound to help us achieve our goals
your plans for secretly murdering us off
and harvesting our soul energy for gain
will not stand
you siphoners
your own wicked traps will ensnare you

i am taking responsibility
i am not afraid of you at all
i am personally destroying
your multicultural hell
because i can
come and get me you chumps

Disclaimer

i highly recommend
that this book not be placed
in the hands of children

although it contains
very little profanity
it is full of rich lies and truth
spiritually fattening stuff

it may stimulate insanity in some sane minds
it has been created for a special purpose

the beliefs and actions of people and nations
what we absorb mentally and spiritually
(not to mention physically)
delusions or verities
bring blessings or curses upon us
i challenge you to prove me wrong

we should choose carefully, no?

He has told us before

Eugenics Comes Around

scientific research minions
keen to polish their opinions
smirking geeks in strange alliances
deadly drugs and taboo sciences

tinkering throughout the night
sloshing gene pools left and right
they've finally found a way to clone
something from the twilight zone

mad professor draws a curtain
past a project that is certain
to raise the eyebrows of his peers
and bring to life their wildest fears

a soldier for the battle field
that fiercely fights and will not yield
is the goal of the research
done inside his test tube church

he wrings his hands and feels distraught
to gaze upon what he has wrought
beads of sweat run down his cheek
his fearsome creature isn't weak

cage door dangling from a hinge
varmint in a snarling cringe
nightmare stumbles outward reeling
void of love and holy feeling

his tiny skull and giant jaw
pinpoint his tormentor's flaw
breaks his neck with one deft twist
it knows that he should not exist

we're lab rats in a cosmic test
against a wall our backs are pressed
from man to God we stretch a gap
we're lost in hell without a map

Evil Children

mischievous moppets hands on their hips
pouty li'l poppets candy smeared lips

bad little tykes minds all abuzz
abandoning trikes and growing peach fuzz

ultra spoiled brats mall worlds they haunt
rotten little rats that get what they want

collegiate immorals hooked on carousing
pierced through with sorrows fraternally housing

no wasted seconds the graduates meet
business world beckons success is so sweet

fortunate fellows and ladies of fortune
the strumming of cellos colors their torture

don't think it's easy to get gain built
rich folks are sleazy and laden with guilt

Forecastle Forensics

politics don't help things much
religion seems to need a crutch
law and science keep on trucking
love and marriage always clucking
work and play and rest go on
regardless of our endless yawn
boredom is a great big greenie
playground for the lurking meanie

murmurs of occult tradition
shouting crowds that spark sedition
smooches on the blarney stone
evil psychics on the phone

jews and gentiles engines steaming
huffing hookahs with a demon
syntax and semantics blather
puts the brainlords in a lather

funny people and their plottings
secret rooms and roadmap dottings
oddballs in a deadly spin
dismantling us from within

pagan statues on a shelf
worshipping to bring great wealth
drinks are downed and sins are upped
moth and rust sure doth corrupt

martial arts of eastern hordes
fascinating bourgeois sports
burning candles all day long
incense beads and new age song

movements masquerade as peace
they often have a taint of beast
and violent loathing underneath
some bury bodies in the heath

children raised in ways of hate
parents grieving for their fate
knowing not what they should do
to save their babies from the zoo

wisdom speaks to all who'll hear
precious words that ring quite clear
if you don't like what you see
isolate your family tree

pray to find a sane escape
from horrors that would spook an ape
move your kids out of the way
plan to save them from the fray
psionic wars and ocean roars
a thousand years in a day for the Lord
whispering wind and flickering flame
the silent e knows nature's game

Going Home

Dear God
Lord Jesus Christ
do you still love me?
i'm tired and sad
and full of prophecies
that noone wants to hear

the world is swiftly rotting
before my astonished eyes
the vampires are restless
and i am swirling with hate

i know the horrors of the pit
that i seek to avoid
been there done that
i know why the demons
and their investigative bureaus
are following me
and i am grateful for Your Protection

but many of my thoughts are still silly
and mammonically inverted
like maggots on stool
my stupid toys are all breaking
hints of fire crackle all about
thick red smoke promises
to curl through the air

almost everyone else seems to be
cluelessly clinging to the ghastly decay
worshipping bellies and taking pride in their shame
secretly shaking their fists and swinging their arms

i am thoroughly confused
with the serious business of life
and plenty disgusted with it all
i am not a little bit angry
with the whole mismanaged affair

i've been very foolish
i am guilty of many sins
please forgive me
and my feeble friends
we want to return home

i beg You to help bring us out
of this awful place
i trust You with all my heart

Harrison Burns

dog eat dog weepy world
endless nights with a pretty girl
mammals file into a class of fears
creatures wander through the veil of tears

song and dance and vedic lore
piece of liver upon the door
churning crush of bitter bile
a great surprise along the nile

agents of force grimly nod
as mafia sports richen the sod
where love of life and leisure is lost
and magnetic gravity calls the cost

bugaboo banzai laughs out loud
psychedelic head held high and proud
chomps a cigar of substance unknown
insurance man shot the phone

Kilroy the Romantic

silent soldiers sharply dressed
line upon line
oompah band of techno gear
guns on stun
suits of saffron freshly pressed

general bids them fond adieu
jumps into jeep
rambles through a land of fear
the gnats sleep
sunset from an ocean view

captain strides aboard his ship
men all salute
holding back their inner leer
crazy coot
kilroy sees and does a flip

Knuckles of Zen

i don't like you nazi grues
or your muddy slumber party
advertisements from the potty
greedy ways have warped your minds
keeping people under binds
i'll destroy your hateful cruise

i despise your sordid art
wicked gangster occupations
unholy forms of recreation
and my heartbeat will not harden
if the Lord allows me pardon
your bogus world will fall apart

demonic gods cannot defend
kaballic zombie golem games
designed to neutralize your thanes
i'll expose your fairy tales
and balance out the evil scales
your deadly soul trade will soon end

The Lance of Lot

got a match?

extropian believers organize a marvelous
cult of valor for subnormal reckoning
pronouncing a worthy death
upon the pornographic
death cult witches
we are brave
and will
return the
condemnation
upon those that prey
on our disillusioned masses
with the trappings of babylonian
one world grandeur truly it won't work out

laugh suckers i want you to laugh laugh why don't
you laugh some more laugh idiots make me laugh funny man

Landing

what if they begin to realize
what?
oh howdy earthlings
good morning
nice hats
you'll have to excuse the mess
twice
it's been ages since i last cleaned
and i can't do a thing
with my hair
i'm late for a dinner date
hopefully she'll wait
at the train station
hold on
i see her there right now
smiling at homeless faces
anyway
since you're here
i might as well explain
exactly what's up
i am very serious
i'm going to prove that
none of you are really brilliant
no not one
that's right smarties

we're landing
such changes await!

Maat in the Ancient Rooms

what a surprise!
the brothers grimm grimaced
when our clock dish
spoon robots found
images and electric lights
books and celestial devices
and a cornerstone iron man
bogus as can be
preserved for the modern age
well prepared to leap and hop
now do you believe me?

Mice Sins

i have always loved mice
i won awards at two
elementary school science fairs
for running them through elaborate mazes

once when i was about twelve years old
i was speedily riding a bicycle west
through the village of skokie on a rainy day
i had my pet mouse in a basket on the handlebars
suddenly
i hit a lump in the road
or maybe it was a pothole
and the mouse flipped a few feet into the air
and landed perfectly under the front wheel
i was very upset
and carried the little carcass
to a phone booth
and called my mom to cry about it
she told me not to worry
and to come home
which i did

another unfortunate mouse of mine
lost it's life
by being smashed between an open
conventional oven door and the oven
when i set it down for a moment
while eating in the kitchen
the door sprung shut
i was inconsolable

yet another luckless mouse perished
as i was sailing it on a big sponge in my bathtub
i went to answer the phone
when i returned i found that the sponge
had soaked through
and the poor mouse had drowned

i am sincerely sorry that those three mice
lost their little lives
because of my carelessness
maybe i will be able to make it up to them somehow
in the future

Nova Raza

is there anyone real listening?
maybe a few dozen?
i am speaking to my proud neutron nation
we will allow them to exploit us only
a little while longer chill out
until our new unified hybrid race really kicks in
a new loving anger is what we need to achieve
it's going to be a grueling process
be nice gently stroke the poor brainless nappy heads
and strung out kitty kitty cow cow cracker effluvium
youngsters out on the streets
they are desperately seeking your approval
they want to play games with you
take you back home with them
share their stuff with you
trade hairstyling tips
cry over spilt milk
talk with you
most of their exalted heroes
want nothing to do with them
haven't the time to show them real love because
they prefer to hobnob with throngs of soulless
suburbanites at amusement parks you go girl or the
cannibalistic paste brained bourgeois media yes you or go thrill
seeking with jaded and drug soaked rock and film stars uh huh
such idiots are useless in the extreme
don't bother trying to be like the
cipherian citizen circus
because they suck
and secretly worship lucifer
really
even he would tell you that it's foolish
and wrong and possible to beat in court
(take heed happy initiates)
such dummies will swiftly become
highly prized mounted objets d'art
subsequent to the yes very real revolution
(which i by the way personally do not approve of)
they are so smug because they have been brainwashed
and fed a false rapture spiel and think that they
will escape destruction via a cab ride the traitors
if you know what i mean
(God is not a taxi driver but masons are)
you'll think i'm nuts until they land
don't look so downcast dolemites
there may be a true rapture before the
tea party but if so it will be spiritual
don't bother pointing out how externals
often match or don't match spiritual
inclinations ignore the gigantic pro death voodoo
cult aka the entertainment industry with it's
sick and twisted moving and shaking baal
worshippers that are merrily leading our
children over the edge of a jagged precipice to a
shuddersome doom everything is trashed anyway right?
remain calm
you are being protected
we know what will happen next

Rehabilitated Vampires

darkly muttering
danse macabre zombie boat
baby eaters
consulters of shadows
foul scribblers and readers
gathering gloomers
i'm talking to you
you know who you are
get off the fast track
you still have a chance
to avoid your molten doom
sincerely repent
unsear your minds
deny your destroyer
he is only a sorry figment of
your overworked
imaginations
(ha ha ha)
if you apply the
proper faith
against your
spiritual
impediments
be courageous
heaven awaits
all of you twits
your wonderful
imaginary friends
cannot stop you

a matter of degree

armed with common sense

creeping troublemakers

ready to fight the profane

survivors of all stripes
catastrophic crushers of

Surd String of Jude

vile sibylline psychological
strangleholds engineered
by disingenuous scholars
of natural selection and
the evil fruits of original sin
shadow magister mythology
is in effect
the objective being the illusion of material bondage
ignoring the dignity and sanctity of human life
the ghastly gamers press on
chained to their muses
sickening laborers
feigning innocence
antichristian in intent
delighting in acts of
horrid abomination
shunning things natural and good
choosing the procrustean way of death
mocking the translation of the saints
preparing the devastating surprises
awaiting those that will be left behind
to revel in sophisticated lies far
beyond the ordinary garden
variety prevarications
sorry fools seeking
the rule of a black beast and
yes they shall have it
an implosive orgy of
gloomy destruction
draws nigh
true believers will vanish
and thoughtless gigglers
will be left to suffer a dark fate
few will choose flesh martyrdom
to save their souls from falling sway to
the abundance of miraculous falsehoods
fantastic religious deception will
blanket the entire world
after the Spirit departs
beelzebub will begin to spend the souls
that he has stockpiled for his unholy holidays
even the chic fraternal commerce cults will be shocked
for foul deceivers will wax strong
the worst degenerate practices
will be rationalized and
even sanctified by
once righteous
institutions
you can't afford to laugh
the hour is late

Telluric Working Bounceback

for my confused pagan friends
(that i love most dearly)
such wise and bright people
in certain respects
(especially under a microscope)
i don't want you to burn
in a name   what's there?   have you looked?
you will find out   my amateur etymologists
beware of big words   i've done plenty of research
and know of the curving progression of
creative evolution      mad love that whirls
chasing it's tail      and no wonder
what did the woman say?
within silently rotating minds
money      is that all you want?
my         you are easily amused!
what of truth   justice   and order?
for the pacing ruler      in a not so small nation
and his sectioned consort      i observed her deaths
they have risen with the industrial voodoo oil barons
stepping over fetuses   such unusual mountain folk!
your process stands still      separate time channels
they are learning   she's dancing!   not fast enough
those unchained automatons      there they are
tigers all         yes i know
and well disguised      they smell funny
the hyperactive secret cosmonauts
we're worried   and for good reason
thought i remembered her   how wrong i was!
i think      that's not my home      down there
i live further south      at the top
(things are upside down)
you know
ho ho ho         (that steady diet of fish)
she shouldn't have said   that
joy and pain      fire and lace
i helped to pay their bills      unknowingly
and i'm still alive!      thankfully
God is infinitely good!      ask ivo
He is the source of all   mystery
luck            and domino effects
He holds the devil's leash   and ours
and is unafraid      know why?
ask baal   (still searching for spices)
i want to help you
i know important things that you don't
definitely
i am one of only a few survivors
of masonic sacrifice rituals      that's right
because Yeshua has been merciful to me   a common sinner
bothers you      don't it?
how dark she is   the bearer of good news
just lovely!      selena
what a mess!      she dropped her paper chase star
(disguised as a purse)
and i picked it up   and prayed for them both
fear the Lord   you sassafras beasts
seriously

The Emperor of Antarctica

after the
deceptive
fireworks
and before the
phantasmagoric
debacle of mars
the strength of
the underdog
and the mercy of the Lord
will stay the hands of hell
for a lucky group of
persecuted believers
electronic books of blood will be
read in the frigid land of promise
and a new wave flag will unfurl
over vast expanses of icy land
the time capsules will be found
in the ancient coal caverns
south of the scotia sea
onward to victoria land
ceramic domes will gleam
anticipating the advent
of true terra formation
plenty of harmony and
sanity and no sinister
vampiric system of
governmental rule
a righteous being
blessed by the
Most High
will protect
the meek and frightened ones
selected from all the tribes
of this war torn world
together they will
survive the hell
that the foolish
mammonites will
bring down upon
their rapidly
dissolving
civilizations
woe to them
and yay for
wondrous

Twenty Four Seven

white is a culture
not a color of race
working for the principles
of order and grace
black is the ruin
of societal pace
breaking up the patterns
for destruction and waste
white men can be found
with slanted eyes or dark face
black men can be found
with blue eyes and a briefcase

Years of Fears

secret weapons i have two one for me and one for you
if you'll listen to this story of our world's fading glory

a woman of uncommon grace
with steely wits and striking face
very soon will lead the stray
towards an unexpected way

stateside moral code is chafing
leaders far too busy laughing
never knowing why they snooze
morons snuck up on the noose

sporty sellouts to the devil
primitives they seek to level
soulless beings judge and jury
accusing victims with such fury

if you want to feel the tooth
of the art of battle truth
don't consider it alarming
it has a lot to do with farming

i know of the death devices
hidden in the land of isis
wily asian leaders found
the engines of unholy sound

martial powers quite terrific
china skips across pacific
spanish power bases shaken
southern regions swiftly taken
can't forgive their enemies
deutschland looses hearty sneeze
hopeless sinners perishing
mellow allies flourishing

arabs bully africa
with legends from apocrypha
hidden base along the east
holocaust of mutant yeast

godless people want to pin
their sins upon a mannequin
but when their golem will not yield
their voodoo game is soon revealed

jaundiced eyeball peers at pill
man of letters smiling still
proving life can still be fun
penguins beckon from the sun

aqua rising overdue turkish system kinkajou
onions soggy magazine england jolly submarine

Badchan Pom Mop Koradgee

so, you think that you know how to speak english?
i have been to the front porch of hell
yes, really
would you like me to describe it to you?
there aren't many details
beyond magnified misery
far beyond normal bounds
consequently, i understand the severe penalty
attached to the burdens of sin and the weight of iniquity
we are not righteous but the Lord is
there is nothing
in this flesh engine realm
worth losing
your passage to heaven
this won't make much sense
'til your time runs out
and you find yourself winking into a jail cell of
your own creation
it is horrible
you just don't know
surrender to Jesus
all of you

Darling Neutrina

the notion of
super luminal travel
past the immutable quantity and
photonic quenching of the paranormal
space time channel is possible
the universe is even more exciting
than we previously thought
blue shift protonic anomalies lurk
the propagation of light
through space
is not a constant
vacuum chambers
have proven that
zero point energy vortices are infinite

Demonic Migrations

ecologically
undernourished
orphans aweigh
(they must be fed)
umbilical cords snapped
overheated and dilapitated
aborted sky chariots crash in
the military industrial complex
the civilians must not know
captains major and minor
with frantic actions and
secret squirrel logic
(doncha know)
erect their tents
over the wreckage
electron microscopes
fire up throughout the night
the valiant presswomen lurk
nearby and get the story on film
but soon find themselves under
the gun of the law of the east
their hands are the last thing
left dangling from the hungry alien
snake's mouth as they are gobbled up
their dainty fingers snap in unison and
then they are gone to judgment
but somehow their story leaks
the principalities have been thwarted
and citizens have been prepared
for this by unlikely heroes like
bo diddley bill haley chuck berry et al
and the secret messages they left for
impressionable mankind
(boredom prevails and nonsense blossoms)
pop culture is the spooky puppet of the
emerging nouveau system
put your armband back on
so you'll look good at the guillotine
(false antidotes abound)
satan can and will be defeated
but don't let it go to your head
read much?
the vicious cauldron of art and life
(give me the eye)
is what's cookin' in de eastern kitchen
wicked chefs are desperate to get into
the game yes they love money that much
many of them have fiendish drug habits
(quoth the raven)
and have been horribly tricked into serving
the current lord of our world (drilling away)
guess who?  what iron curtain?  not again!  get it?

is God watching?  does He know?  of course!
it's all part of the serious worldwide show
the only show in or out of town

Freak

yes, i am a Jesus freak
and yes, i hate this world
no, i'm not afraid to die
and no, i won't go to hell

Jane

some deputy!
(rosy dropout)
last of the first
way cool ones
what?
what kind of an answer
is that?
unacceptable!
popping out of your
tin shack to scream
at me
woman
you are out of your
mind and
acting very strangely
we are not frightened
of course you and
your slugs will
be punished
a bomb for every hair on my head
(you can't hide)
now where are we going
to rebuild our fair city?
(sans the dummies)
yes
it was quite a cantina
and the steel drum band
(la la la la la)
played on
(madcaps)
i'm no culture vulture
(where's wendy?)
maybe perhaps i love
my true identity too much
(don't know)
but i am far more
enamored of you
than myself
you soothsaying charwoman

now is finished for good
poor things
(ha ha ha)

nah

Kicked from the Garden

problems with poisons
and the frustrated victims
of oppressive arrogance aside
we feel sadness for the passing
of the good things of this world
such as the occasional triumph
over unreasonable adversity
and the innumerable creative
illusions this is our temporary home
even soaked with tears it has appeal
your enemy satan is currently ruling
but even he is working for God strange
though it may seem he is being allowed
to finish his abominable experiments
in social engineering so that
prideful competition will be
conclusively proven
to be a sure path
to disaster

Modern Genetic Kitchen Miracles

changeling child
(too much stupid to be frightened)
you listen
the eating of
pork (often which
brings trichinosis)
may be more dangerous
than smoking the cigarette
(tobacco the devil's weed is,
but if puff you must, i'll buy you
another pack; if stay you will)
angry and stupid it makes one
partially human flesh it may
be; ask a well-informed italian biologist
and please to carefully look
if too hard to swallow that is
then also hear this
crustaceans and insects are bad too
waste scavengers
they were created to be
(perhaps easier that is to believe)
read leviticus
and touch them no more
no good to eat they are
uncross your legs
and stand up
i too am dizzy

Observational Stations

teeth and curls of silicon sages
perusing stacks of centaurian pages

mysterian fulcrum beginning anew
patriarchs pilloried in covert coup

women of wisdom dwindling still
consternation from emotional swill

morally neutral educational forces
ignoring all truth of original sources

pyramids of ice and igloos of stone
skeletal steel and skyscraper bone

flasks of alien reason uncorked
the inward eye is overworked

One Neo Eon

oi!
a trork of root beer, please
wait!
zex, man!

the bright and tender
oikofugic
bombilating buzz bee

flies skyward
through the flue

flits onward to the field of
softly swaying kurrajong
the bifarious bumble knows
the locations of uxb after uxb
but is summarily slapped dead
by the latrant wife of a labrose
shadow government congressman
(salamander king of the hillbillies)

dredged up evil treasure
insincerity and statesmanship
and paternosterian hopes
what a huggermugger!
lagotic lack of certainty
provides bucolic power for panic
there is a fatal flapdragon logic to error

Onon Nono

muse
where are you?
i grumble and pace
without your spark
until you return fitful
fears fill my days
there you are cut
that out schnook
pull up a stool
let's discuss forgiveness within reason
and the danger of the logic of irrationality
vile crumpet munching thing
the tree of knowledge is not that of life
and the world is swiftly passing away
amen
i would have never imagined
that i could offer you any inspiration
seeing as you're invisible and all
but i cannot forgo the warnings from
our Common Father
listen
the dead know nothing
your kind imitate the ancestors of the living
and cause much chaos and confusion with
the addictive lies that you impress upon us
us earthlings have important news for you
and your holy book destroying ilk
stop cringing
waah waah
i'm going to help you grow up again
what?
yes i know that there is something special
about our lake
don't distract me
with stories of that
(sing to the sky irate underwater world
aggravated with human industry and the
whispering poisons slowly seeping from
the sodden earth and their monarch's
anger because of interrupted commerce)
hidden realm
i know that they are preparing an oceanic
assault to expose the folly of drylanders
no
i haven't been reading too many tabloids
thanks
but no more evil treasure for me

silence, dryad
i'm thinking

now, what were we discussing?

The Bad Girls Conspire

amazing
fifty way
sundialling
diamond mind
valkyries meet
at the famous hotel
there is talk of nephilim
much strong wine is quaffed
the hubcaps are returned to their
proper places whilst scratch kitty bites
an innocent mousie that gets away after learning
it's gnarly lesson they drop all pretense and scheme on

You Wish

sweep mop buff
yes i too am a sinner
shoo those flies and
drop that grimy skull
show me love woman
you and
they have hexed yourselves
by trying to kill for profit
big money in them there choppers
suckers
and now that you have
been paid well suddenly
you are trying to defuse
your evil role model
hee hee hee
don't forget goodness and innocence
i won't allow you to cause
us trouble anymore
stop grinding your teeth
i have a future nation to protect
and i won't bend my knee to you
and your imaginary friends
so axe it
your clockwork terrorism is laughable
puffins are stringy on the dinner plate
and your comic book allies are feeble
God plus me makes a majority
we are being punished
for our erroneous
humanist philosophies
yes i know
you need to do some
soul searching
find your sandals
you'll be alright
despite your sins
i'll make sure of it
go back to church
say you're sorry
i did
it's what you really need to do
so that we can start over
or maybe you really want to drink blood?
there will be plenty of popsicles
for those that want them
nauseating
be for real
i can't live without you
i'm waiting

Abominable Exordium

hello fellow illuminati
we know well your plans
to purge most of the world's population
via plagues and artificially induced catastrophes
and how you are scheming to flee from judgment by jetting
away to other spheres in suction aircraft
without the Lord's permission

here are some more freaked out crayon scrawlings
for your animistically africanized necrophilic
festive royal family commie pom
tiki tiki taun taun videotic
touched by a fallen angel
worldwide secret society
snap

i hope that you enjoy them

we are hip to your miserable plans
diversity is all fine and well
but calculated insanity
and mechanized
immorality via
satanic
lies
will
end

fear of nakedness bloody gets
we know how the masons
and the witchcraft cults
got the high tech gear
and the spacecraft
through blackmail
of individuals in
contact with
antichrist
aliens
iao

the Lord will not be mocked by humans
or the fallen lem host of heaven

i am your unraveller and liberator
from satanic bondage
this is no funny joke
the experiment and
the show is over on
this side of the earth

you will pursue the obviously evil side
of the blasphemous crowley
formulas to your own demise
but you will do it somewhere else

not me or my strong house
we will serve the Lord Jesus
you will take that crap back to
your own neighborhood yeah we
are giving all you satanists the boot

reverse your course for the sake of posterity
or you will suffer incredibly and lose it all by
being transferred into another dimension
haven't you discovered why one third
of your life is spent in slumber yet?

the Lord is preparing to unleash
a massive healing for our nation
and later the rest of the world
the captives will be freed

high tech babylonian ancestor worship
and the mammonically charged buck
stops here
camptown ladies

or
you
will soon
wake up
to how very
serious the
situation really is

the united states of america and our multinational corporations
will no longer be allowed to promote psychotronically augmented
antichristian commercialism and satanic malthusian figureheads
and gobbledegook programs of phony miracles
on pain of national
destruction
our internal
and external
enemies and
their well laid
plans are being
temporarily thwarted
while you contemplate this
very urgent and serious message

Attention Space Creatures

that are not aligned with the Most High
you are doomed to fail He has created us all
and we should obey only Him relinquish your grasp
on the minds of humans and cancel your demonic illusions

Beautiful Uterus

is she ticklish?   i will find out
regardless of the   beastly lout
his nitwit fie   it ain't no test
upon dude's bean   my foot shall rest
determination   is my game
her beauty ways   dissolve my shame
and when our day   at last arrives
'twixt ours and theirs   worlds will collide
we'll tell them how   it all began
our love will beam   and vex their plan
they will not like   the things we say
but never mind   their endless nay
they'll see us rise   into the cloud
the earth will shake   they won't be proud
to finally know   what error brings
upon us all   when trust we fling
to those who want   the meager call
of dust and ash   from mankind's fall

but lucre i lack for reasons surprising
not for my dunce antisocial despising
only for sloth my ardor doth languish
no loving moth to order my slang wish
until disenchanted for her i will quest
her lubricous cheer i seek to possess

which are mostly ignored by the

because of close propinquity and false chauvinism

Ghetto Kids at the Movies

with the last few dollars
that mom can scrounge up
we tiptoe past crack dealers
and go to the movies
to watch y'all
blow things up
battle spooky ol' space creatures
cheat beat poison and kill each other
tutor us on each and every form of hate
shoot dominate and humiliate native people
all throughout the wide world
and engage in powder puff love

something about you reminds
us of ourselves even though
we haven't the foggiest why

we love you so much and give
you the time of day to prove it
maybe you are just too busy to
be our pals we thought so we're
sorry

we're not so bad
yet

where does our little money go?

Ignorance of the Obvious and Strong Delusion

sorry you calculating idiots a technologically backed antichrist
and bogus program of false miracles will never arise in the usa

ever so slowly you are beginning
to realize how badly you have
horribly deceived yourselves
all of this is on record and will be
presented to you on judgment day
the Lord and His angels know all of

the hidden things in the hearts of
mankind and He is fully aware of your
plots to elevate an unholy vampire icon
for the enslavement of the souls of
men you cannot hide from the truth
and the fact that you have lost your

demon saturated minds your desire to
indoctrinate me into your disgusting
system of neo pagan worship and to
treat me as another sacrifice if i'd be so
ignorant as to wholeheartedly refuse
your unholy fallen star adulation has

backfired on you all exactly as i
said it would and now the evils
that you have wished upon us
are devouring your minds and
flesh i told you but you laughed
and wouldn't listen only God is

pure and worthy of worship you
fools your phony gods hate humans
and even now are tormenting you
love is wasted on a vacuum and it
will soon become painfully obvious that
your intentions were absolutely wrong

we have nicely crossed the wires of
your entire twisted hidden network
and permission has been given to
dissolve every last one of you goons
that will not repent and acknowledge the
error of your sick and demented ways

i will not allow myself or anyone else on
this side of planet earth to be elevated into
your godless program of star wars death
but of course you are too smart
to take heed to what i have been
trying so hard to convey and you

will continue to whorishly lust after the
blood that your demons seek and require
for your stupid material realm of satanic
bondage why can't you straighten up and
forsake your evil ways and drop to your
knees and repent before it is truly too late

Kabuki Quisling Putsch

i'm still leaping over abysses and negotiating snaggy cliffs
or is that craggy?
thanks for asking
you and your plans are so transparent and
i have been given the honor of reminding you of
where you and i are from - where melodies are pure
you may have a brain tumor - it will go away
there are only seven more - and they have their own agenda
soon we will enact ours
i will not let them destroy our people
i don't exactly hate them i just think
that they are plain stupid no i am not
jealous of them in the least and that
is the real secret of my power
over them and their communist jazz
god (i am jazzier) keep looking my dear low road girl
i enjoyed the love that you sent me i am shocked
to find that you are actually concerned with my
welfare my more than one way queen i thank you
but why are you usually so haughty and chilly?
(you tried to kill me) you don't appreciate me you beast
of course i am an antisatanic abolishinistic
voice of eruptive discontent (i know that you love me)
casually anticipating the destruction of the fortresses
of high tech lynching devotees
how i desperately adore you
i could just strangle cupid
the land of nod 540 doors my quiver is full lout
ha
ding dong
wait
someone's at the door
hold on a moment
tromp clomp skip jump hop
who is it?
friends of who?
why come right in
she's in the room down the hall to the left
ah
back to you
my coal company tarbaby magnate
so they say
i do love you and i want us
to be ferocious catbird helicopter pirates
sprinkling crowd control love from high up above
we'll swoop down on unsuspecting homeowners
very early in the morning
(wearing sceery warpaint and not minding the
degeneration of the english language one bit)
land right in their well manicured backyards
and abscond with their silly lawn ornaments
oh we'll get things done and (until our mission begins)
snack on burnt bacon cigarettes and thermos coffee
on the way back our children will be mighty and will
enthusiastically repopulate the old new world
mhm the old new world
yes yes
flash
they will be astonished
when they see us in uniform with our weapons
running through the hallways of the spaceship
you are the very finest and moxiest woman in the world to me
(i ache for you) lovely little doggie (am i stupid or what)
my weird life makes perfect sense now and the only thing i don't
like about you
boink
is how untethered your spirit is
a catholic monk has implied that i will go plumb down
to hell if i marry you but i have more faith than that
our tour is the best tour on the planet and we will
research flywheel technology and wean them
from their oil dependency by improving their
character and integrity it will take time but
i just know that the best marvels lie just
ahead because we are natural masons
boy did they deceive you but good
but don't even trip and don't be
mad at me you just have to
pick yourself up and start
from the beginning again
we will be there when
poor old jack walks
the plank good
thing you didn't
do that i know for
sure that you'd be
miserable if you ran
that race yes i know
i share your mind from time to time you know and
if that isn't who he is then i sure as hell can't tell
vanity is the root of fascism but the force must
be there and they are using him as a funnel to
tap the awesome spiritual reserves of the
most oppressed peoples on earth for the
purpose of making hitler look like mister
rogers you know yes they will really be
able to fly beelzebub says so and even
(please) though (trust me)
i don't like accepting information from
demons i am pretty sure that it is true
and we will not be ruled by murderous
dogleg poseurs we're infinitely
more free than that slick
as catshit aren't they?
we're slicker
i like the secret world that we've built
(kerguelen) it is such a blessing to (is)
see an upbeat group of diverse people
truly enjoying themselves and each other
with a bare minimum of secret loathing lurking
when our bodies finally meet there will be much
confusion i'm not sure what will happen maybe you know
i am not corrupt tonight i am happy to be accused of treason
because i know it is they who are the traitors let's kick their
kettles and make them snap out of their ignorant funk once and for all

Keys to the Shell

buildings?  why you don't even know what one is
anymore you scuzzy snail tail tape measures
you null and void spools of film and coils
of rope har surrounded by space
curlique space ships (my
lost child) i have
rediscovered them
(all) they are (ours)
and i am ever so happy
ring dangling from my hand
keys jingling softly i whistle my tune
this is a test you are being closely observed
and now the g men will work for good
if they know what's good for them
(one exception destroys shadowy
unconstitutional rule) you have a
chance to gain your souls back
from big bad satan
good grief you lumps
your electronic idiot box meddling
is being brought to a screeching halt
vroom otherwise plan on rolling the credits
my flea flicker squirrelly good buddy girl agent
(who would like to no longer use
this world's first evil invention (the
comb) and consequently sometimes looks

us the psi power to secretly dispatch our many
enemies (we are (quietly) snarfing snarfers)
and their associates (it must be done
(and it is) they have far too much
innocent blood on their hands)))
and i we dim the lights snug in our
cozy four room home we curl
together in the southern wing
as groovy shanties quietly emerge
from our integrated hexadeciphonic
sound system do such things really exist
? in the morning we listen to the universal broadcasts
and solar snails bring happy mail from our (much loved)
deaf dumb and blind friends down in the basement
she tells me to wait before sending a reply
and thumps my chitinous head
when i sneakily attempt to defy her
another journey is what she has planned
i want to finish up my noodles first and then i
and she will bring some noble nature out of the worst
of the ghetto children how they need that loving inspiration
especially the sad orphans
nobody loves them enough and
they know how important discipline
from a father and mother figure really is
generations of children feel unwanted angry
and used it is truly sad to be amongst disillusioned
youngsters that curse sure seems to be forthcoming
people with fat pockets celebrating minor misfortunes of
their perceived enemies rather than being human enough to
care for some sad children that
(they feel like living abortions)
would be so happy to get some
sincere affection and attention
(not money and gifts love isn't
material) from the (busy busy busy) fancy
adults on tv that they admire so much or just ordinary folks
yes really she and i have worked amongst them and know it well

Khym and I Down In the Tunnels

she fed me plump strawberries
in the midst of a field of
tiny forget-me-nots
sunny and silent
the day beamed on
and we drank a toast

then the picnic supplies were nicely packed away
hidden in a nearby pine forest
and we journeyed to the present

at the base of the craggy sea cliff
hidden messy mossy old doors open
misty cold moist fetid
earthy air wafts upward
as we cautiously descend
down the leaf strewn shaft
angrily chittering shiny things
hurriedly skitter away into nooks
some crunch under our soft sneakers

gaggy vertigo gall
wells up in our throats
from the gassy putrid odors
of decay that become ever more
fragrant with each chancy tread ahead
we clasp our cold clammy hands for security
the ticking cell phone parcels are hidden somewhere
such a very fortunate thing that the numbers are unlisted
and the oddball maze is crooked - beyond our mapped blackenings

Little Lilith Jenny Wren

i am rarely lonely
stone soft and sunny sweet
my invisible consultant
she silently waits
she is no spinster
(say it again scary lady)
on the curbside cobblestones
(with her silly chinchilla)
sharing quiet thoughts with herself
my invisible friend she widely smirks
as i arrive from my world of lunacy
she looks into the glistening puddles of
misery division and joy multiplication
that our strange lives have become
her face is a bright eyed
black velvet painting

we've all been taught wrong
she says (as i crouch down)
in her least commanding viice
the vain beautiful people are the problem
that is the honest truth
not the ones that don't get far
no
rather
the ones that understand how
chaos and order create complexity
she is quite a looker herself
i think
shut up
she says
i am trying to explain what i mean
:
it's not just their outside beauty you know
people have it on the inside as well
beauty is complexity
and complexity can be sadly weak
when outnumbered by order or chaos
so the few prospects that are complex
(inwardly and or outwardly)

are early on subjected to
t h e   t r e a t m e n t
because we who are unseen
see what others cannot
and do what we must
to sustain our needs
we toughen and desensitize
disconnect damage and dismay we do
we make funnels of them
so that they will comply with our cruel wishes

magnetic individuals are our only meal tickets

everyone is beautiful
and that too is the truth
but until that becomes common knowledge

we will continue to feast

Lucifer Hoop

listen desperate man just what the hell is your everlasting
problem you people are really sick i know why you astaroth
beelzebub et al keep tricking stupid human people into
your service daedalus' ambitious dreams for his son
really went wrong and although aphrodite is the bomb
even she isn't worth losing my soul for especially since
she is just another of your zombies so keep on insulting
and attacking me i probably deserve it for being curious in
the first place it does irritate me to see so many of your little
lackeys exalted so highly when i know that i could make most of
them look like orangutans the mannish women and girlie men that
you seem to prefer so well sure i know that it is you that is really
running things on earth currently and not God and that is why so
many bogus denominations of our Lord's religion currently exist
you are very good at confusing and perplexing and at keeping
us frightened and discouraged and seeking false remedies
such as sex drugs and wok and wool i think that you're a
very miserable being and i'm sorry for bringing railing
accusations against you and your deluded flunkies
but can you blame me i have actually seen the
horror of your shiny eyed workers looming
near during the times when i almost died
and you are sometimes even very
honest about such things i
refuse to praise you
and i know what kinds
of bizarre perks that you
are constantly offering your
potential new recruits i cannot
believe how many foolish people
are willing to regularly prostrate
themselves for your creepy ends
such tainted glory really depresses
the hell out of me and i don't need a
new hat i am happy with mine just
fine and i appreciate the many
wonderful blessings that God
has allowed me to have i am
grateful to be alive after all
of the stupid things that i
have done please keep
your brain dead children
particularly the 3 amigos
away from my posterior and
out of my hair i would like to
strangle some of them your
super snazzy gifts are not
worth it so just keep them
away from me find some other
idiot to pin your creature feature
hopes on i am tired of your crap and
i'm hoping to continue working for our
Common Father only He is God only Him
you see eternity and true righteousness
are still far more exciting than anything yet
standing or crawling on this old groaning earth
i am far from perfect but i hope to be recreated
very soon so see ya insane old man and lotsa luck

My Good Menschen

from a gentile who is a fellow heir to the promises of abraham

to atheistic and worldly jewish people particularly entertainment industry magnates and ministers of defense finance and industry

i am a sinner along with everyone else but i am not the bad guy

why are you so often financially and politically ruthless and why do you tolerate such awful trash and bad humor
to be disseminated throughout the worldwide media when everyone knows that many of you have great
power over such things stop our culture from degenerating most of us are hoping for peace

why won't you perceive how badly we want to place you high in our minds obviously you are some of the smartest people on
earth although you do lack certain sensitivities realize that the asian mob is warm on
your heels and many of them are absolutely full of the devil

just think of how empty and inhuman the earth might be if it weren't for the scads of soulful contributions
to world culture that you have effected and helped birth and your deep love of humanity in general

the greatest gift that you have given the world is monotheism

our Lord God Yahweh

or rather He has given you to us don't disappoint Him and our tribes
we know that you feel underappreciated and angrily defensive because of this evil
and ungrateful society that we live in remember that your people often flourished when challenged
oppression has it's rewards for all individuals and groups it is principally because of your help that america is so
(often painfully) free but things are getting out of control anyone can realize that

don't you see that the many gentile war pigs
and their demon lords are just using you and your
creative minds as stepping stones to further their cruel and unusual political agendas you know it
yes aryans tend to be warmongers and many are to be eternally damned but many of the branches of mankind actively
seek innocent blood and are extremely treacherous don't dare to worship their many false gods
or subscribe to the vain and deadly nephilim philosophies that we are all being swamped with hey jude the angels that kept
not their first estate but left their own habitation are reserved in everlasting chains under
darkness unto the judgment of the great day yes really don't let them drag you down to the pit and later hell with them
humans are not angels of any kind yet but we can share their punishment if we are stupid enough to chain ourselves to
their deceptions yes this book is full of lies but some of them will actually come true doesn't make a difference
a lie that manifests is still a lie i think that God is allowing me to do this so that you will stop and think for a minute about
the fine mess that some of you are getting yourselves into fairies wear boots you guys Yeshua will return
in the sky with all of the holy angels of the Lord but sometime before that satan and his
children will create signs and lying wonders on earth that will be so incredible that's right
three dimensional that even the old prophets might be tricked if they were here
it has something to do with renegade angels and the burgeoning
hot patootie vampire cult and the bermuda triangle that you don't
hear so much about anymore (it just might be the electromagnetic
navel and time gate of this world) God knows what is really going on

we confused and sometimes sensible gentile believers love you guys and want to see you prosperous and happy
but not at the expense of our posterity

do not help to finish the blasphemous brainwashing puzzle plans that satanic gods have built up for mass destruction
they are especially licking their chops for your blood
antichristian baal worshipping fascist pagan homosexual humanist technocratic murderous funny money tactics
are not the way for israel or any other nation
hopefully you don't have a problem with my pointing that out
God is very angry with all of us and will bring the house down if we don't repent and quit messing around with our blessings

Poppa Wheelie

oh please!  we like him!  yes we do!
tell us more about the car!!!
the ragged little wartorn children cried in unison to chief oai
what'd he do after the moose?
ok my mice i will
settle down and finish your potatoes
i'll tell you how it was with him
obviously (or maybe not) he was the hero of our story

he was nicely nestled in the wild weeds 'neath
two shady trees and a hammock
he was only a tiny corgi model
with no major malfunctions
no driver and no license plates (he'd lied)
but he had overblown misty matchbox dreams of secret
masonic space cadets and how some of the worst sinners
wanted to treat the weak of the world like dumb animals or children
or souls to be bought and sold like so many cheap seats in a
vaudeville show and twiggy and grass happy commuters and
the big bad binary necks in nooses shadowbox world and it's
ticking tombstone bag of tricks to fix hicks scientific religion
of eunuchal mathematics that included such tough titty
neighborly niceties as radioactive vegetables
and pellets in telephones and poisoned
beer and ale and as his engine purred
he also mulled over such things as
beep beep
the raunchy ring of fire and showroom
stylin' and profilin' and growers packers and
shippers and words inside of other words and
the true spiritual roots of the usa and selfishness
and abused and starving and mistreated children all
throughout the world and greedy and lying satanists
and where all of that illegal drug money was going and
the pervasiveness of phony babylonian christianity and
tea parties and secret inventions of the fallen crunch angels
and what might be happening on other nearby worlds in other
time zones and how some of us colonials didn't want to be
co-opted into the cutesy malthusian 'international
community' pizza hut paradise because of
disenchantment with hypnotic mind control
techniques and underground cities and what their
old estate was like and coercion tactics and polar
shift secrets and that weird urantia book and
those were the days he also pondered on
the insidious old girl network and the glaring
lack of an american civil defense program and karl
marx and the meaning of the moonwalk and the hand of the
whore and moonrakers and the legendary cow and steppers
and non-linear time theories and the process of gradualism
and pie and hoosiers and people waiting for the bus and
pi and psychotronics and scalar interference
patterns and girls and woodpeckers and
Op No Ed   No On De   Tu Ef No
and how some buildings
like the field museum
may have shocking
vw xy zunk pux secrets
such as secret elevators and
six level sub basement catacombs
honk
and how the merry media had way too much evil power
and the cure and the lack of pity in simon city and
how because of these many frets he had been
galactically going nowhere fast sonny boy he
awooga
also considered the different teams of demons
and how to explain the odd elevator dreams and
the ungrateful and insolent art community and the
meaning of the voodoo snap and capitalizing on the fear of
nakedness and communist depopulation policies and haitian
secret police and white slavery and how God really doesn't care
how smart or stupid or pretty you are and how john lennon was
the coolest thing since sliced bread and how you know nothing
and incineration and how even though it took all of his strength
he forgave them all and his mia fiancee and how don't
look now but pretendo's finna kick your

those were a few of his thoughts
kiddies
why the long faces?
what's not to like?

Real Healing

if you want to stop working for
the serpent and receive healing
from all of the ailments that are
plaguing you
and inherit the marvelous eternal promises of God

here is what you need to do

acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Son of God and
that His is the only name given for our redemption

acknowledge and repent of all of the sins in your life
repent of any allegiances with false religions and cults
reject any initiation ceremonies that you have undergone
manipulations of the flesh and pagan ancestor worship have
nothing to do with Lord Jesus and the Salvation that He offers

do not be fooled by false religion
and doctrines of deception
read the book of jude

when you realize the truth
satan will aggressively seek
to confuse and oppose you so
that he can maintain control over
your soul and life

empty your mind as best you can
of all encrusted humanistic coding
images words it may be very difficult

(infernal symbolism allows earthbound demons
and their spiritual fathers in the fallen host of heaven
pantheon to have control over your mind soul and body)

then place the blood of all of the souls that have been
murdered by satan and his war machine constructs
all throughout time in a sphere above you

above them place the sphere of the Holy Spirit
above the Holy Spirit place the sphere of Jesus Christ
above the sphere of Jesus Christ place the sphere of
the Lord of Hosts
the Most High God Yahweh

put on your spiritual armor and apply your faith
to keep it seamless and impermeable

sincerely pray to be helped and to be able to help others
you will feel an immediate difference

thank God for the very tangible healing that you will receive

use common sense and avoid as many
truly unholy things and activities as possible - especially bad humor
keep your focus on that which is pleasing to God and keep praying
you will be very pleasantly surprised

The Legend of the White Boy

through the darkish night
knowing every cranny
teeth on edge
and wit aflare
they will not
with a slight hunch
he
crinkles his schnabel
and cautiously pads
along the dark alleyway
clutching his precious gift
big band meridian melodies waft through his mind
as he plots the desperately funny deed
she was absolutely unmaidenly
to me you see he chirps
and i inspissated her pelf
not a driblet of humanity
traditions blah blishuns
(saturday is so far away)
the settling is scheduled
they will destroy themselves
he thinks
but i must help them along
nudge them from the nest
the others don't know of
the powder puff crow
and the bulbously pendulous
palely ripening beatnik things
gorging themselves with death
(they must be stinking by now)
that must be harvested
for the good of mankind
somebody wants them badly but not
i
because i'm far too wise in the eyes
invited or not (obadiah will amerce)
something rustles inside of a red garage
they will not make a monkey out of me
and spoon feed daft trigonometry
to lumpens of choice that don't hear the voice
of helical wagner and serpentine pog moor
they will not
why
i actually heard the last horn and
know the end is near
(not enough time to finish my beer)
i know what
i will buy them a drink
yes they will drink and they will swallow down
and they will know what an angry jew can do

Trial Balloon Beezus

do you have questions
let me ask you a few
just who do you love
serious moonlighters
you are operating at the
zwivhuya expense of others
stop playing nasty pinball games
and let's be a little more concerned
with thems what really needs it charity is
what God expects of us and without fanfare it
is a fine way to get oneself back on track in a spiritual
sense stop believing in vain theories of eugenics and sniffing
yourselves ceaselessly feed shoe house those poor souls that
are floundering throughout the world there are all kinds and please
understand that our Lord identifies with them far more than us
because he sees how ungrateful most of us pampered
folks are after all of the blessings He has bestowed
upon us we have the nerve to shamelessly
dance around that which is displeasing
to Him i am so ashamed of myself
and that is why i am not
clamoring for the
victim status
advantages
that would
make me
forget
any of
my roots
think o' that
remember that
we are responsible
for helping to ease the
pain of the disadvantaged
children of the world because our
enjoyments are often at their expense
of course if they could promote a leader over
us he would treat us very harshly because we have
bubble gum brains and deserve the burnt witch cruelty that
our cultures are descending into the only way to truly stop
ourselves from utterly slip sliding away is to prove to the
Lord that we love Him by being kind to those who are
not as lucky as we is this irritating you well it
should i am really surprised that you
haven't realized how much more
important the have nots
are to the Lord than
most of us ingrates
are i am ashamed for
all of us maybe we will
get another chance soon

Within the Maze

ball on floor and squeaking shoes
they sometimes fall and yes they bruise

on they fly to win the game
the gallant men deserve their fame

the fans all cheer and hail their idols
but when they lose hands fill with midols

the teammates' strains cannot be told
pirahna swim outside their fold

their sanity is often pressed
for glory fame and all the rest

gangsters cruise the mighty moors
embezzlements and gambling lures

for every win there are dark prices
demon chiefs and sacrifices

so when you go to root and cheer
don't forget the victims' fear

Women Are Not Evil

although it sometimes
seems so they (do love money
a little too much) were some of
the first victims of disobediance
and the devilish blessings of nod
and often pioneer new forms
of transgression even so
men are far more guilty of
warmongering and harboring
the institutional sins and lies
that fly right rulers and
gung ho soldiers whorishly pursue
the true source of our human evil is
supernatural and lives deep
down in every human soul
women
most of them are full of concern care and love
and wrapped tight in shells of bitterness
they are the source of our flesh
none of us would be here
if it weren't for God
and the dears

Ram Gets Up

not minding his ps and qs and with apologies to noone in
particular he rose from the ditch into which he'd been
hurled and tried to reassure both himself and the
mice that his mission really was holy despite
having it so rudely interrupted he'd had his
fill of peeping tom turkey and creepy
beefaroni and now it was time to
really start bursting bubbles
they were going to get up
or blub away to nothing
by golly this was the
only way that he
could prove his
theory and yes
it was muy dan
gerous to pose
as the ultimate
dumb duckie but
very much so worth
it and not for the frills
either two stones with one
bird was more like it you betcha
saving others from experimentation
of this nature was important as well as
supporting da noble cause of conservation
of angular momentum what do you expect to
get out of this is what they asked him well the
girl would be nice but only if i can keep my soul i
like my curly horns very much don't ewe yes green
and red tibetan ground lizard men are not funny at all
they will kick your butt quite nicely over and over again
if you lose your faith in that next world don't you realize
that you are abusing the old religion of the pharoahs and
pretending that it's ok to harbor fallen angels skunk at
the garden party i yam they are intrepid and cruel and
scheduled for eternal destruction so they have nada
to lose unlike us they haven't been cast down to the
earth for nothing you know be careful what you
worship or put around your l'il neck if we don't
seriously repent and pray they will soon be
in business in grand ol' north america in
a very big cheesy way if i tell you
these weird things and you
don't believe them
well then i don't know what else to do i am just a little creep but
they are big ones God willing we'll make it out of here in time but
i'm not so sure about the
happy sorts please think
you need to stop the traffic and expose your mystery system
of demon worship if you continue to inculcate flesh with such
abominations it will be game over much sooner than you think
aren't there enough stars already yes you need to snap out
of it in a hot hurry da abortions must cease or the societal
damage will be phenomenal guess who is furious at you
hoorayers achtung was what i heard i am not for sale

--- letters to Lauren Cohn

    Below, are three letters that I wrote to Lauren Cohn, a television 
    news reporter who was working for ABC/WLS Channel 7 in Chicago at the 
    time (she now works for CBS/WBBM Channel 2), asking for her help in 
    publishing my book, ¢dhinn Voodoo Buddha; the letters were all written 
    throughout 1996.  Lauren Cohn is the only person that I sent a 
    complete copy of the draft version of the ¢dhinn Voodoo Buddha book 
    to.  I felt that she would understand the gist of what it was that I 
    was trying to do, and would assist me in getting my book published, 
    but, apparently, I was entirely wrong.  At least so far.

    I am trying to expose what may be some very serious, evil symbolic 
    design schemes that the Satanic community has been trying to cook up 
    and manifest over the course of the past hundred or so years; it 
    wouldn't be easy to quickly explain what I am getting at, but I am 
    certain that some of you are vaguely aware of what I mean.  That is 
    part of the reason why my company name is Swastika; to help remind the 
    readers of the murders that were so smoothly perpetrated against 
    millions of people in Germany (and all throughout Europe) during World 
    War II, and how the majority of the German (and other nationals, 
    please remember) citizens just 'went along' with what was happening, 
    without uttering any kind of significant protest.  The same thing can 
    happen here in America, and it already is, to a certain degree.  Wake 
    up, you dummies.

    I hope that somebody out there 'gets it,' and decides to help me.

--- LAUREN1.TXT

    Dear Lauren Cohn,

    I just might be wrong, but somehow, I get the feeling that I can trust 
    you.  I don't have time to scrawl out an elaborate explanation as to 
    why I am writing you - you might have some idea, anyway; perhaps you 
    know more than I.

    I am trying to publish a book.  I truly think that it would sell very 
    briskly.  I am under the (possibly delusional) impression that it must 
    be done before the end of this year, for reasons that would sound 
    slightly insane.  It's almost as if I am being externally impelled to 
    get it done.  I would like to title it ¢dhinn Voodoo Buddha;  
    enclosed, you will find a rough draft of some of the material (along 
    with a few other items).  Much of it is crummy, and I don't plan to 
    include all of it in any official submissions to publishers.  I am 
    extremely poor, and have very few resources for attempting to secure 
    an attorney to assist me in this matter.

    Although my main objective is not wealth, I have been advised that 
    there is a possibility that a reasonable amount of money may be 
    forthcoming re this endeavour.  I would be more than happy to agree to 
    cut you in on a percentage of any profit from the book's publication.  
    In writing.

    I realize that you are in a very demanding profession, and that your 
    schedule is very constrained; if you are interested in helping me with 
    this project, it might be fairly easy for you to simply forward the 
    manuscript to whoever might be able to get the thing rolling - be sure 
    to remind them of my agreement with you.

    Currently, I have plenty of time, but I expect to be very busy towards 
    the end of this year.  I hope that you will see the merits of what I 
    am trying to do.  If, on the other hand, you would rather not be 
    involved, please notify me in some way.  Either way, thanks for your 
    time.

    Now for the mash note.  I think that you are the very foxiest chick in 
    broadcasting today, and I wouldn't be surprised if you wound up in a 
    much better position sometime soon.  I'm sure (I know, from what they 
    tell me) that tons of dudes are slobbering all over you, and you 
    probably don't mind that at all.  Good for you.  I do have some good 
    advice for you.  Be even more aggressive in your delivery, and 
    modulate your voice up out of the occasional midwestern semi-monotone 
    range that you use - it'll allow you to farm a more definite response 
    from your viewing audience, which will improve everything else for 
    you.  Aren't I nervy?  Heh heh.

    Please respond.

    Good Luck,

    Dear Lauren Cohn,

    Hopefully, this letter finds you in good spirits and health...  I'd 
    like to thank you for reading and distributing copies of my book!  You 
    have been a very big blessing for me, and many other people.  Life is 
    very peculiar, isn't it?

    I like the way things are changing!  And so quickly!  Our Lord is 
    merciful and good.

    I don't want you to misunderstand my intentions.  I love all people 
    equally, but some people just seem to need a good kick in the 
    psychological rear-end every now & then.

    Hey, I have some more poems that I'd like you to check out!  I like 
    you, but I sense that you don't trust me.  I'd like that to change.  
    I'm not an idiot, you know.

    Please be my friend - you won't be sorry!

    P.S.  I am perfectly sane & sound, and I sincerely like you.

--- LAUREN4.TXT

    Dear Lauren Cohn,

    Although I am becoming somewhat discouraged by your lack of response, 
    I've decided to send you more of the projected material for my book, 
    ¢dhinn Voodoo Buddha.

    I have assumed from the beginning that you and your associates at 
    ABC/WLS are an honorable bunch of people, and I trust that you all 
    are.  Don't be put off by my strange approach.  I realize that you 
    have done some research, and that is all fine and well.  I am well 
    aware that many of you may not think very highly of me, but I am 
    certain that that will completely change in due course of time.

    There is a very important reason why I am in contact with you, but I 
    am unable to fully disclose it at this time.  This is a very troubling 
    age that we are living in; but just ahead lie even stranger twists and 
    turns, I assure you.  Please believe me when I say that all of us need 
    to pay attention and stay extra alert.  Certain people that are 
    involved with certain secret social and political agendas are being 
    very badly deceived.  I know things that are very unsettling, and I am 
    not talking about the activities of garden variety papaw patch 
    oddities.  Things that even you guys don't know, or suspect.  Yet.

    This may sound very silly, but I seriously need your help to publish 
    my book.  It must be done.  If it isn't, certain people that have read 
    it may turn into pumpkins.  Maybe.  I'm not sure, but that's what they 
    tell me.  As I mentioned in my first letter to you, money is not my 
    primary objective.  This test of trust and human nature is not solely 
    for me, you know.  You, and the other readers are intricately 
    involved.  Yes indeed.  Very much so.

    I have been well aware of the unpleasant mechanics involved in the 
    elevation of a new social parvenu (and most of the people that spend 
    time in the 'public eye') for quite some time prior to my legendary 
    hazing.  Moreover, I clearly see all of my options, including a few 
    that you (and crew) may not.  Because of the fact that I wish to 
    remain on the good side of God (insofar as it is fated for me to be - 
    hopefully, He will continue to be merciful and kind to me), a lot of 
    creepy hopes and anticipations (of certain world power alignments - 
    yes, really) are being thwarted.  They are 'paging' me constantly, and 
    it has taken much of my energy to fend off such lowly techniques of 
    manipulation.

    I am fortunate to have a strong faith in God.  You see, I have been 
    burdened with proper ownership of some very potent archetypal symbols, 
    most notably, the fylfot.  And others want to use it.  Yes.  It really 
    is mine, and I am restraining it.  Surprise.

    I am smart.

    That is why my book has to be published.  I have been told that 
    certain events will be postponed indefinitely as long as the book is 
    published and reasonably distributed within a certain time-frame.  If 
    it isn't, I will be forced to let the hieroglyphic fly.  No kidding.  
    I am only so strong.  Of course, not everything in the book is true; 
    much of it is pure fiction - but there are some heavy-duty nuggets 
    buried within.  Believe me.  Part of the agreement is that all 
    intellectual property rights must remain with me, but I cannot do any 
    book signings, or silly promenading.

    There is more material; much of it in essay and prose form.  Please 
    don't think that I am joking.  Many forces are hoping that you guys 
    will pooh-pooh what I am saying, as you have been.  Demons are licking 
    their chops.  If you flick me away, it is out of my hands.  I hope 
    that you will be kind and carefully consider the weird position that I 
    am in.  I have unwillingly become a sort of negative spiritual grand 
    central station.  It is no fun.  Can I get a witness?

    I believe that one of the main objectives of the book would be to 
    expose and bring to an end the rituals of pagan 'ancestor worship' 
    taking place in our nation, and their ultimate goals.  They, drugs, 
    and greed  are the main reasons why our nation is in line for some 
    serious punishments.  Of course, we do have a nice list of other 
    national sins that need to be repented of.  Such as voodoo cult 
    'videotape slavery' of people in our government and general 
    population, and psionic experimentation on our own citizens.  I 
    understand that many powerful people and organizations, including some 
    elements within our government, would be vehemently opposed to some of 
    the material being published.

    Incidentally, the 'Futureshok' and 'Alienation' pluggers that I 
    included in the items that I sent you were from (now-defunct) 
    businesses that I ran back in 1989 and 1990.  In my occultic phase.

    The nightlife and entertainment forces have long been spiritually 
    coopted by alignments antithetical to traditional American values, and 
    their political influence has begun to spill over into many hitherto 
    'unhip' bastions of Americana, which is why there is a massive 
    backlash brewing throughout the land.  Please keep in mind that I am 
    only an ambassador, and I am representing many angry voices of 
    discontent.  They are fed up, and things are truly ready to boil over.  
    I hope that you will contact me.  Remember our Lord.  I honestly like 
    you, Lauren.

    If you decide to view me as just another nitwit crackpot lunatic 
    looking for a soapbox to stand on, at least do me the honor of 
    dropping me a line.  I would greatly appreciate it.

    Anyhow, until such time as I can establish definite communications 
    with you, I will simply shut up.  I really would appreciate your help 
    with my book.  I don't mean to be a pest.

    Please be a friend, and write me.

    Odhi doo dha day,

    P.S.

    If you would like to do a little sleuthing of your own, and realize 
    what may be at stake, allow me to point you to a series of articles 
    that can be found in a back issue (published several months ago, I 
    believe; I can't recall exactly which one - my copy mysteriously 
    disappeared) of 'Aviation Week and Space Technology' entitled 'The 
    Post Cold War Nightmare.'  I am merely attempting to decode some of 
    what is going on - I am not a participant at all.  Just a concerned 
    and patriotic United States citizen.

--- a bit of prose related to the ¢dhinn Voodoo Buddha book

    Mon Dec 30 1996 5am

    She never calls, Dig Dogs.  Dragons, huh?  God forbid.  It's been that 
    way ever since I got here.  I hope that I've been able to flesh out 
    and clarify some of the more subtle dynamics of your religion of 
    Canaanite money-worship.

    I cannot honestly say that I have an infallibly clear line of 
    communication to our Lord.  He may be ready to allow the ever-lurking 
    Satanic forces to begin their mad little dance of world destruction.

    We have to deal with racism, but clearly and honestly.  The engine of 
    'traditional White racism' greatly gorges itself on the pathetic 
    garbage that is being promoted by certain forces in the 'entertainment 
    industry.'  The members of certain cultures (particularly in the music 
    industry) appear to be slated to remain in a perpetual state of 
    psycho-spiritual infantilism.  Pushing forth such blatant trash does 
    no one any lasting good, least of all the dimwits that bow down to 
    Satanic representatives in pacts of submission, and then proceed to 
    line their stinky pockets with cash by capitalizing on the misery of 
    their people back in the "'hood".  Sure, that's how many of the 'big 
    boys' have been doing it for centuries, but it still doesn't make it 
    right.  Anybody that feels good about the 'artistic' forces that help 
    to keep the horribly destructive inner-city cultures operating, is 
    truly sad.  More people are murdered in the urban areas of the United 
    States in one year, than on the entire continent of Europe.

    As I have mentioned before, I am not unaware of the many miserable 
    devices employed by the devil and his diligent workers to secure loyal 
    new recruits.  Moreover, I perceive that some of you are quite cross 
    with yourselves, and have been internally questioning as to whether or 
    not your lifestyle choices have been worth your material rewards.

    I realize that some of you have wholeheartedly aligned yourselves with 
    Satan, and his (ultimately destructive) causes.  Even so, it does not 
    diminish my love and concern for you poor deluded creatures.  I have 
    many pagan friends.  I have even tried to befriend a few Satanists.  
    Difficult people to reason with, at times.  I have attempted to pray 
    for the evil spiritual entities; I definitely do not recommend praying 
    for evil spirits to anyone.  I believe that it is one of the biggest 
    mistakes that I have ever made.  Those spirits are evil far beyond our 
    understanding of the word.

    When I find myself in a completely clear frame of mind, I entertain no 
    scatterbrained delusions of there ever being any lasting harmony 
    between the pink hand dollar-bill Masonic witchcraft cults and true 
    Christianity.  I am sticking my neck out and making this little foray 
    into your worlds solely for the purpose of getting you to realize the 
    truth of the Good News of the eventual return of Jesus Christ to our 
    world.

    Since America seems to be something of a psycho-spiritual barometer 
    for the entire planet, I feel that It is America's duty to accelerate 
    the cultural development and dignity of all the world's races.  If we 
    collectively refuse to sincerely accept this great social 
    responsibility, all of us will suffer tremendously in the future, and 
    much sooner than you'd think.  If we continue to promote negative 
    imagery and inane mental constructs of degenerate buffoonery in our 
    mass media, we will continue to reap the rewards of such a misguided 
    policy, in even more horrifying ways.  The dark fruits of evil 
    American (and Western, in general) culture, and their transit 
    throughout the rest of the world, via mass media, and other means, is 
    what I believe is meant by 'the overspreading of abominations' in the 
    Bible.

    I have taken it upon myself to distill and translate (in a symbolic 
    sense) some of the more positive attributes of Aryan philosophy (which 
    has become largely broken-down and ungodly over the past few decades, 
    I believe).  I hope that the readers understand what I mean by 
    'Aryan.'  Many of the people that consider themselves to be 'Aryans' 
    have become some of the most disgusting, depraved dirt-bags that have 
    ever skulked about on the face of this planet; I would be utterly 
    ashamed to be associated with many such individuals.  Aryans are 
    supposed to be wholesome leaders and role-models for the other racial 
    groups; this is not what we have been seeing within the ranks of 
    so-called Aryan culture (for the most part) over the past few decades.  
    The Aryan image has largely degenerated into one of paranoid, 
    faithless, reactive, jingoistic lunacy, which greatly grieves me, and 
    many other people that sincerely care about these matters.  I strongly 
    believe that it is wrong for anyone to feel ashamed of their cultural 
    background, be it singular, or mingled in origin.  Nobody should have 
    to apologize for their heritage, especially here in America.

    We already have a sort of negative technological Brahminism in effect; 
    only a small percentage of our population has full access to the power 
    of the electronic information matrix.  Those of you that worship the 
    many gods of the current system of power distribution on Earth need to 
    clearly understand some of the deeper things involved, regarding your 
    'participation' in the currently prevailing evil system of Satanic 
    psycho-spiritual bondage (yes, there is much more to learn beyond your 
    sickening 'initiations'); full realization of certain of these 
    concepts will help clarify some of the more cryptic truths of 
    Christianity, I believe, particularly issues pertaining to what 
    exactly is meant by the terms 'Mark of the Beast' and 'Mystery 
    Babylon,' as they are used in the New Testament.

    Please remember that we must continue to fight against fascism of all 
    kinds, on all fronts.  If allowed to germinate, the plant swiftly 
    grows, flowers, and puts forth incredibly prickly tart fruit.  It has 
    been enjoying a long and peculiar incubation here in America for quite 
    some time, and I must say that I am solidly amazed that it hasn't yet 
    percolated up into a more classic form, complete with spiffy uniforms, 
    sputtering, wild-eyed orators, and blatant cultic symbol worship.  
    Maybe that is in the offing, or maybe not.

    I am convinced that the real reason why this has not yet happened, is 
    because of the bastions of sincere believers in God that are even now 
    fervently praying for our world's continued stability.  We must 
    continue to defend our spiritual sanity, via monotheistic faith.  If 
    the preservative salt of sincere belief in our one true God is further 
    diminished, we will begin to rapidly decay, and ultimately hit rock 
    bottom.  This nation cannot afford to flirt with the hidden formulas 
    and combinations of madness.

    If the cultural platform for fascism that has been built up is not 
    corrected, if we as a society continue to remain blind to the truth, 
    and choose rather to follow the 'party line' of unscrupulous 
    materialism and baseless worship of things that are lesser than God, 
    well then, you can best believe that there are drooling beasts of many 
    spots and stripes waiting in the wings to make their entrance.  And 
    they will gladly rip our sacred cows to shreds.

    Many of us are bearing the brunt of inherited generational curses, 
    which is why so many people are foolishly seeking (what seems to be, 
    to many folks) spiritual relief from Satan, and his considerable 
    angelic forces.  All of you that have consciously made 'deals' with 
    Satanic intelligences had better rethink your actions, because after a 
    certain point, you will probably not be able to be saved.  The Lord 
    may very well turn His back on those of you that have chosen Satan as 
    your master.  Only fools are sold to the devil.  Rather, you should 
    sell yourselves to Jesus.  He is the real Master.  Really.

    There is something very special transpiring here in the United States 
    (in case you haven't yet noticed).  We have access to a nearly 
    complete range of the world's cultures here.  No modern American likes 
    to think that tiresome racial and social stereotypes based on archaic 
    genetic behaviorism theories hold any currency in this 'illuminated' 
    age, but, unfortunately, it appears that many of the old saws of 
    ancestral wisdom still loom large.  Humans appear to be more 
    interested in biological diversity and transcendance and 
    transmogrification of cultural inheritance than ever before, but the 
    weight of the past ever tugs at our reason, keeping us hesitant and 
    doubtful as to whether our emerging future will actually be worth the 
    price of admission.

    I strongly believe that one of the desperately needed antidotes to our 
    general cultural malaise lies in some of the regenerative musical 
    theories of the Far Eastern world.  Specifically, I am thinking of 
    Oriental musical theories based on the five universal tones.  Music 
    (and all art, for that matter) tends to mirror the contents of the 
    artist's soul.  Upon reflection, many of us may find that the baggage 
    of our life experiences exerts considerable gravity on our spheres of 
    emotion.  We need to shift our musical consciousness upwards on all 
    fronts, or we will continue to be spiritually puppeted and drained by 
    invisible demonic forces, that seem to thrive on what classically has 
    been called 'degenerative' musical modes and scales.  Not only is this 
    extremely important for us mature folks to understand, but even more 
    so for our children, and the younger generation in general.  If you 
    think that demons and their activities are only the product of 
    schizophrenic imaginations, all I can say in response is, wait and see 
    - in time, you will know absolutely for sure that they really do 
    exist.

    In the West, we have been raised under the cacophonic ordinances of 
    deeply degenerate popular music for nearly four decades, and the 
    accumulative effect upon our culture is beginning to make us suffer 
    tremendously.  The spiritual changes that we need to make in general, 
    may be helped along soemwhat by changing the forms of music that we 
    create and enjoy.  To me, it is remarkable how some (but not all, of 
    course) of the Asian (as well as many other world cultures) popular 
    music spills over with happiness, optimism and other emotions that are 
    nearly entirely missing from Western popular music sources.  More 
    uplifting music is the cultural yeast that we need, as well as prayer.
