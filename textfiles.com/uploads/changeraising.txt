         INTRODUCTION

The basis of this scam is pure confusion. It works on two ideas. The first 
idea is that a cashier should never, ever do two transactions at one time. 
If you take advantage of this mistake, a cashier doing two transactions at 
once, then you can scam them out of some money. The second idea is that 
people do not want to admit they are wrong, or confused. The cashier you 
pull this scam on is going to instinctively know that something is 
strange, but they will not be able to put their finger on it, and they 
almost definitely will not call anything out, saying they are confused.

The first time this happened to me, I was 19 years old, working at a 
convenience store. A guy came in the store and pulled this scam on me, and 
even though I knew something was weird about the transaction, I did the 
transaction and ended up $10 short on my till at the end of the night. I 
thought about it for hours and just could not figure out what happened, 
but I knew it was that transaction that made me short.

It wasn't until about a year later, I was watching TV, and someone 
demonstrated this scam on the TV show I was watching. Immediately I knew 
how I lost that $10 at the store I worked at.

You're not going to get rich, or get a lot of money doing this scam; it's 
just a few bucks here and there. It's almost just not worth the time. But 
it is fun, it is an extra $10 when you need it, I suppose. Nonetheless, 
it's very textile worthy. Best yet; it's a textile scam that actually 
works.

A big thanks goes out to Jason Scott of textfiles.com for hosting all of 
these files. I check textfiles.com every once in a while to see what is 
new in the uploads section. I searched "2012," and nothing came up! So, I 
figured I should probably write this file and submit it to Jason Scott so 
we can at least get one text file in for this year.

          THE SCAM

Here's how it works:

This scam is hard to keep up with, either watching it or reading about it. 
So please bare with me.

First, you go to a store with your pockets loaded with the following:

In your right pocket, a $20 bill. In your left pocket, a wadded set of 
nine $1 bills, and a separate $1 bill in the same pocket.

Go to a store and ask if you can get change for a $20. Hand the clerk your 
$20 bill, and get change.

The clerk will give you $20 in change (a $10 and two $5's, for example). 
Put this in your pocket. Now stop and say something like "Oh wait, you 
know what? Can you just give me a $10 bill for all these $1's I have?"

Now give the clerk your wad of nine $1 bills. The clerk will hand you a 
$10. The clerk should instinctively count the money and realize you gave 
them only $9. If they do not, say something like "you might want to count 
that to make sure there's the right amount."

The clerk will count the money, and realize you only gave nine $1 bills.

Now, say something like "You know what? Just give me change for the 
original $20." Now you need to put the $1 down on the counter to make $10, 
then put down change from what you first got, to make $20. The clerk will 
now give you a $20 bill.

Confusing? Let's make a quick rundown:

--
1: You have $30 in your two pockets.
2: You got change for the $20 in your pocket. You still have $30 in your pockets.
3: You ask for a $10 bill, and give them nine $1's. You now have $31 in your pockets.
4: The mistake is realized. You give the clerk a $1 to make it $10, then more change to make $20. You 
now have $20 in your pockets.
5: The clerk has lost track of the transactions, and gives you $20 for change.
6: You now have $40 in your pockets.
--

You just made $10

I know it's a little confusing. Just re-read the steps, practice with 
yourself and a friend, and you will see how it works. This method is 
virtually flawless. The beauty of this scam is that even if you are 
caught, or they spot that you are making a mistake, then it is exactly 
that; a mistake. No one at the store is going to accuse you of trying to 
fraud them out of $10; it's just not going to happen.

If you need a visual representation, then just search "change raising" on 
YouTube, there are a few videos demonstrating this little scam.
