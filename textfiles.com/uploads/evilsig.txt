  I)  INTRODUCTION
 ------------------

  Cigarettes are evil little sticks and many, many people smoke them while
  they do not care  about  their  health,  their  money  and  their  time.
  Cigaretts are a sick part of our society and in  fact  for  many  people
  they are a symbol which spread a kind of atmosphere,  they  are  a  sick
  part of many, many peoples lifes and that is really bad. So i decided to
  write a paper about that EVIL case.

  I really hope that everyone who smokes will learn  something  from  this
  paper or better: will STOP smoking forever with success.

  II)  WHY THIS PAPER
 ---------------------

  I write this paper to try to wake people up - to STOP smoking,  that  is
  right. Many years ago i was a smoker and i wasted lots of money for this
  sick sticks. Some years ago i stopped  smoking  and  it  was  the  right
  descision, sure. When i now see people smoking i  think:  why  are  they
  doing it? It is useless, in fact, it makes them just sick and takes away
  their money and their time too. This paper is just a little try to  make
  people think about their life, their health and how to use  their  money
  in better ways. We should fight this EVIL industry complex which  is  in
  many cases supported by the government too - we can do it  by  just  NOT
  buying cigaretts and STOP smoking them forever. These people do not care
  about your health otherwise they would not sell this TOXIC SICK stuff.

  When you tell people who smoke that it is not  good  for  them  in  most
  cases i became some really stupid answers without much  sense.  I  think
  all people should stop smoking because for their  health.  You  can  USE
  your money in much better ways than wasting it for  cigarettes  and  you
  can SAVE and PROTECT your healt by stop smoking. The sooner you stop  it
  - the better it is for your whole life and not to forget: FOR the people
  around you who breath the smog too probably.

  A lot of toxics right? If these 596 ingredients are not enough  to  stop
  smoking already then please read on because these EVIL sticks can  cause
  lots of BIG trouble to your health. If you wanna  know  more  about  the
  details of these ingredients then please make a research for yourself.




  IV)  WHAT CIGARETTES CAN CAUSE
 --------------------------------

  Here are some dangerous and serious health problems which cigarettes can
  cause. Everyone should really THINK about them and  should  tell  others
  who smoke about them. Here are some examples about what can happen:


  - abortion and miscarriage
  - birth defects
  - stroke
  - less sense of smell and taste
  - cold hands
  - loose teeth
  - gum disease
  - lung cancer
  - lips cancer
  - mouth cancer
  - stomach cancer
  - period pains by woman
  - impotence by men
  - asthma
  - cough
  - shortness of breath
  - heart attacks
  - leukemia
  - weaken the immune system
  - the so called smoker leg
  - amputation of legs and foots
  - THE DEATH


  Is that not enough to STOP it right NOW? I mean when  you  already  have
  a kind of cancer then it is too  late.  Then  you  have  really  serious
  health problems or you will face the death some  time  later.  Use  your
  brain - why do you have it ?




  V)  WHY TO STOP
 -----------------

  First of all it is not only your health which goes away while you smoke.
  You waste also lots of time while you do it. Think about all the moments
  where you have smoked and where you did nothing but smoking  -  add  all
  this moments together and think what you could  do  with  all  the  time
  otherwise. I think lots of better things.

  Second. You waste LOTS of money while you smoke. If you smoke  for  many
  many years you could buy a house from all this money or a very  big  and
  good car. Think about this, just for some seconds or minutes. It is your
  future what you smoke away partly, it is your life which is filled  with
  toxics while you smoke. You can do better  things  with  the  money  you
  waste for cigarettes: you can donate it to  poor  people,  you  can  buy
  good and healthy food and drinks from it, you can buy  your  loved  ones
  some nice gifts. Isnt this much better ?

  Third, we talked already a lot of it: your health, which faces the  most
  consequences from smoking and not only yours, also the  health  of  your
  children when you smoke next to them and all other people.  Your  health
  in fact is much more worth than all your money. Money  you  can  replace
  but health you can not replace so easy. Without smoking you feel fresher
  and you have more energy all day. Your home will not smell like hell and
  also not your breath. Kisses  will  taste  much  better  too.  And  many
  children will begin to smoke because their parents  smoke  or  they  see
  other people smoking.

  I think there are so much reasons more, i can not mention them  all.  It
  is your part i would say if you wanna stop smoking. I can only show  you
  the direction and give you some ideas but you must go this way  "alone".

  You must enable the part of your brain which is against stop smoking the
  cigarettes. ;-) Set this part from 0 to 1. 1 means "i stop smoking"  and
  0 means  "i smoke" . It is like shifting a switch. Or for the hackers of
  you it is a kind of brain hacking or wetware hacking. You could  see  it
  as a challenge for you if you want. It really is the  fight  worth,  you
  will not rue it in the future.

  If you do not smoke - PLEASE never begin. It is EVIL, dumb and TOXIC.




  VI)  HOW TO STOP
 ------------------

  Seriously and from my own experience: it is not always so easy  to  stop
  smoking and that is why the sooner you stop it the better it is. It  can
  be a long time to stop it forever. The longer you smoke  the  harder  it
  can be to stop it. Remember: it is never too late to stop it and  it  is
  it worth to stop it at any time.

  It is good when you have reasons to stop smoking like  mentioned  above.
  With this you have a goal to reach. Sure, stop smoking is a goal  itself
  but some more goals are much better and will help  you  to  continue  to
  stop it forever - it will make you stronger.

  The best way from my own experience is to stop it at one  day  and  stay
  away from cigarettes forever. So if you smoke one packet a day and  then
  you try to stop smoking and smoke every day a half packet can throw  you
  back again. Why? Because you did  not  get  the  point,  you  are  still
  smoking. Not so much like before but you smoke and this can be a risc to
  throw you back.

  Even if it feels hard it is the better way: stop it at one  day  and  do
  not start again. And when you had one day without smoking you  can  tell
  yourself: "When i accomplish it for one day i can do it the next day too
  and all days in my life." Believe it or not: it is all just  about  YOUR
  WILL. It is your mind, your brain which  makes  the  descision  not  the
  nicotine.

  Do always think about the health problems you can get  and  your  death.
  This sounds hard but it can help you a  lot  to  understand  why  it  is
  better for you to stop it. Look at pictures of lung cancer, smoker  legs
  or amputations. Make a bill and count all the money you smoked away till
  this day and then ask yourself what you could have bought from all  this
  money? Will you waste so much money again and again in the  future?  Are
  cigarettes something which is it worth to live for? To make all this can
  help you much.

  You should also always stay away from people who smoke. Because for your
  own health and second because it CAN throw you back  to  smoking  again.
  Instead of smoking with them you can inspire them to stop  smoking  too.
  But never forget: in their near you smoke passive  which  is  also  very
  very dangerous.

  In case you stopped it and you stared again then DO NOT give  up.  Throw
  your cigarette packet into the trash or into the toilet and let them go.
  This can happen and it is better to try it then just to say: i will have
  no success it does not matter. It matters. Again, do not  give  up.  Met
  people who do not smoke, they can also help and inspire you.

  I think there is no need for nicotine patches  to  stop  smoking  in  my
  oppinion. I think it is just money wasting too, really.  And  while  you
  take them you suck nicotine into your blood which is an addictive. I had
  success without this stuff.

  In some moments where you smoked you can eat a bubble gum or  make  some
  sport, think about important things (like stop smoking) and so on.  This
  is your part. In some hard parts of life it can happen  that  you  wanna
  smoke again because everything sucks - just do it NOT  and  think  twice
  before.




  VII)  ABOUT THE INDUSTRY
 --------------------------

  Yeah well. Our lovely toxic selling cigarette industry.  Death  to  this
  kind of industry. They sell you and your children the DEATH people,  the
  death. These people are only interested in money, money and more  money.

  Our governments are deeply involved in the  cigarette  industry  because
  they make taxes on them and they make so much money with this that  they
  have no interest to stop it. This is really evil. The  making  of  money
  for them is more important than to protect you from smoking.  All  these
  people are just evil vipers who speak twisted.

  Marlboro for example has many job and career campains and they push  for
  it. But of the costs of whom? Right, of the costs of all the people  who
  suck toxics into them like air. Of the costs of the people who died from
  smoking and will die in the future from it.

  The industry could use its money for more healthier  things  to  produce
  things like this which can not cause the death:


  - fresh food
  - good natural drinks
  - natural clothes
  - good books
  - world wide wireless FREE internet
  - building more schools worldwide
  - helping poor people
  - building nature friendly houses and cars
  - solar energy cells
  - wind mills
  - invent something usefull
  - and probably much much more ...


  These industries take away your health, your money and your time  -  and
  what do you get from them for this? Ehem, yeah, well, right, some  toxic
  and death causing ugly sucking sticks full of stuff which makes you  and
  other people sick and which can bring you the  death.  So  what  do  you
  think - is that a good deal?

  Do NOT support them. This industry is evil. It makes money with the life
  of others or better: the death of a hundred thousend of people worldwide
  every year.




  VIII)  CONCLUSION & LAST WORDS
 --------------------------------

  We have reached the end of this paper and i hope if you are a  smoker it
  has inspired and motivated you. I think  the  reasons  to  stop  smoking
  forever are lying on the hand. More people should take care of  themself
  and about their health and also about others, their children  and  their
  friends.

  If you really want it you will have success. Try it and just find it out
  for yourself. Your life will change after you stopped smoking  and  your
  whole view of life. Speak with your friends to stop smoking if they  and
  you smoke. And if you had success then try to inspire others to stop  it
  too.

  So i hope you had fun with this paper here and it was a  help  for  you.
  If you like this paper here then feel free to share it with others, make
  copys, print it or put it on your website if you want.

  Take care of you all.
