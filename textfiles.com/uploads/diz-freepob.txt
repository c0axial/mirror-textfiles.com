Free PO Boxes

Alright, I fibbed. This really isn't about obtaining free PO boxes,
rather it is a free (and legal) method to procure an equivalent of a
PO box known as Poste Restante (or General Delivery in the US).

PR is a free service offered worldwide, whereby a post office holds
specially labeled mail for the recipient for a certain period of time
(usually a few weeks). The recipient must come to the post office,
present a form of photo identification (cf. the requirements for a PO
box: typically two forms of ID and proof of residency), and retrieve
the letter or parcel.

To address PR mail, simply write 'Poste Restante' (or 'General
Delivery' in the US) in place of the street address, thusly:

Full Name of Recipient
Poste Restante
City, State/Province Zip/Postal Code
Country

To find out the specific PR policies at your location, simply
contact your local post office and ask them for the details (storage
time length, pickup location, etc). If your local post office states
that they don't support PR, then ask for the contact information for
the main post office in your area.

And there you have it, a simple, free alternative to paying for PO
Boxes :).
