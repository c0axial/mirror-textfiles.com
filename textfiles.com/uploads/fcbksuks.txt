Written as a "superwall" post on Facebook

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facebook officially sucks. I'm going to try to figure out how to cancel 
my account because Facebook is turning into a spam funnel. I can't just 
check my email anymore-- I instead log onto my email account SOLELY to 
delete facebook bullshit. Then I go onto facebook to see this crap that 
I'm being constantly emailed about and see that it's actually 14 
superwall posts about nothing. I mean, a poem about how a kid is abused 
as a child? Not only do these things appeal to people who care, but they 
also appeal to people who want to look like they care so that they have 
a better chance of getting laid by the arrogant deuch chic that 
forwarded it to them. "Hay, I bet if I forward this back to her, (and 
everyone else) she'll think I care." *ASSHOLE* And on top of that -- 
IT'S FAKE-- Yeah it is. A third grader could write that. The only reason 
I didn't think of that when I was four was because I had friends.

Yes I know I can shut it all off, but I never wanted to because I 
thought that I might just eventually be notified of something that 
mattered. Like me. I matter. And this site officially blows chunks.

But here- I wanna give you all a text egg, because inside every one is a 
special surprize. All you have to do is figure out how to crack it open.
