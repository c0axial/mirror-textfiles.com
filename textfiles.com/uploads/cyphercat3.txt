((MODUS 1)) CYPHERCAT
((MODUS 2)) CHAOS RUNES
((MODUS 3)) 33
((MODUS 4)) VISUAL BASIC TUTORIAL

((CYPHERCAT))
cyphercat is a creature of the night, but cyphercat is not 
essentially nocturnal. cyphercat is man, but he is also an
individual subject to boredom, and must incorporate features
of certain animals to get by with his daily life, or night
life, as the need strikes.
pissing is a need, as is going outside and allieviating 
boredom in the form of activities outlined in any text
phile you can score on the TEXTFILES website.
at night, if cyphercat needs to go out, he is always accompanied
by his utilities which make sneaking around (for practical 
purposes of not arousing attention and getting past those
goddamned barking dogs) the more easier:
* Flashlight
* Bottle of water (in case you have to sprint)
* Long cargo pants (with pockets for items, and for keeping your
legs away from poison ivy)
* Boots (Wal Mart variety, if you have to steal them, for
comfort and their utility)
* Pocket knife (for random markings on trees)
* Skateboard (De Facto Accessory for any night creature
to get from place to place)

With this, you can turn a 300ft jaunt down the road into
a Solid Snake sneaking mission and cure any boredom you
may have at any time of the night, whether you're dosing
ADX (Adderall) or DXM (Robotussin).

((CHAOS RUNES))
Chaos Magic, as a spiritual force, is a fraud, and cyphercat
is a grand wizard of chaos magicians. but cyphercat uses
chaos magic for its practical utility, namely that of 
BINDING multiply different ideas and things together for 
convenient reference through symbol systems.
CHAOS RUNES are your mark. They are your signature. They
are your trace that you leave. Like a cat. cyphercat has
a trace like the laughing man hack from Ghost in the Shell
stand alone complex. You leave your chaos runes and people
start to understand what kind of new animal you are.
You're not just some kid running around with a skateboard.
You're a creature of the night, forced to dwell in the light
of day, and you're just out to play.
But they'll know you've been there by the mark you leave.
RULES
Do make it simple and tech.
Do make it clever and try to combine letters.
Do make it unique and individual.

Don't try to be a graffitti artist.
Don't tag up anything you can get arrested for tagging.
Don't tag publicly if you can help it.
Don't tell other people about your tag, let them learn
about it or hear about it.

The rule of cyphercat is to be recognized incognito through
hearsay.
this is the way of all keepers.
stealth brothers.

((33))
33 is the magic number which defines young and old.
Simply put, as you get closer to 33, you get closer to your
first revolution.
If you are older than thirty three, then strive to get 
younger.
If you are almost 33, then plan to live forever.
This text file was prepared under the guidance of the
Freemasons of Salem, Massachusetts, and approved by

Your time has come to play. So take to the night and
play forever.
Be seeing you in time.
