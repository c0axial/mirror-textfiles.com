As I watch the election, the news and such brings me to a way of thinking I'm passionate 
about.  We live in a false reality. Church and government are corrupt. The media for both 
entertainment and politics have brainwashed the majority of the world.  Using the media and 
not just news but movies and tv has created ideologies and opinions for the person.  A 
person is left not making an opinion out of their own thought but basing everything they 
know around media.

Lets take Lycans for example.  If you do not know what a Lycan is, "google it" I don't want 
to get too far off topic. If I were to tell you a good place to learn about "Lycans" would 
be the Bible you would say "that's far fetched, or "I refuse that!" Both Christians and non 
believers would reject that.  They have based their ideologies on what the media says.  
Both movies and tv have created a false reality and anyone stepping outside that illusion is 
the one labeled "crazy or heretic!"

The TV tells you everything to believe.  It tells you what to think, what to wear and even 
what to eat. The media has such a strong hold on the world that both believers and non 
believers reject reality.  The false reality is more comfortable. Living the illusion and 
rejecting truth!

Politicians and even church pastors are living the illusion and rejecting truth. Only advice 
I have for you, is to not base your ideologies on movies because then, everyone would be 
scared of TRUTH!
