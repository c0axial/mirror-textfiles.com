TABLE OF CONTENTS

((MODUS 1)) Lockpicking for Aspiring Agents
((MODUS 2)) Recovering the glory of Hacking
((MODUS 3)) DXM

this is the second volume of cbbso (also 
known in elite circles as "corn on the
cob"). 
the purpose of this little zine is to 
take some of the experience and knowledge
i've gained in my 100+ years of hacking
everything imaginable and filter it back
out to you.
also, i know what the scene was like back
in 1984, and i know that a lot of you 
want to recapture some of what made it so
special.
you can't relive the days of those awful
modem handshakes, but you can get to the
essence. 
the hack phreak scene is the essence of
youth in a specific circle, in this case,
one involving computers, drugs, graffitti,
and writing about how to access security
checkpoints like a goddamn ninja.

((Lockpicking for Aspiring Agents))
FIRST you must have motive and purpose
in lockpicking. you have to master the 
locks you come across in the real world.
take the opportunity to look at every
lock you come across and think, "how hard
would it be to pick this?"
you should get familiar with certain types
of locks. you cannot hack every lock in
the world. you have to count your gains.
choose your targets as you wander around
your area.
you are not a profiteer, and you are not
a SPY, you are ANONYMOUS. 
SECOND you must carry around your tools
with you like a credit card. since you are
an introductory hacker, you only need a 
bobby pin and perhaps a flat piece of metal.
I use a specially made "twick", which i
rigged. 
THIRD you must visualize the picking 
process. think about how the bobby pin 
connects with the pin of the lock. feel
when you twist the pick you have made.
set it in place, breathe, and pick again.
timing and patience are two things you
would do well to build up at this point.

every agent starts with random, no-name 
targets for the rush. don't get greedy.
if you want to play this game for as long
as you can, start small and pick small
targets. buy a lock and practice picking it.

((Recovering the Glory of Hacking))
we were small fish when the mentor wrote
his words on the hacker manifesto. we were
little shits idolizing eric bloodaxe and
sitting in #2600 waiting for someone to 
type something.
we wanted to be part of a scene we were
way out of our league in. bored teenagers
that got high.
subversive. on the sly. we walk a fine line
in the night. in black we sneak around and
gain access, you know what it's like.
cyphercat lives in the matrix and this
is available to everyone.

forget about the girls for now. take care
of your duties. become john doe public.
watch and learn, observe. you have to be
anonymous. forget everything interesting.

cyphercat has yet to write his own utilities
in C++ or some other programming language
but the spirit of hacking lives in the
activities of picking locks and accessing
systems.

sitting in front of a computer now, and
reading textfiles in the glow of the
screen. something happened and I'M NOT
TELLING. that is the spirit of hacking.
i'm living it, you're reading it, and
good night.

((DXM))
cyphercat has a little bit to say about DXM.
it may as well be the very drug case ingests
to access the matrix. a very well balanced
DXM habit will vault you into the matrix,
where you will have your ass handed to you
by the God you grew up fearing. i had my
ass reamed by paul the apostle before i could
wander the matrix like a man.
but DXM takes you to the level of reality 
hacking in this body where you realize
that synchronicity is a joke for mortals
like us.
but for hackers who play, see you on the
net.

cyphercat out.
