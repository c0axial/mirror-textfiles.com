	Why do some people teach their children ideas or "morals" that are eventually going 
to be disregarded later in their life. Why do people teach their kids that their are some words 
that are bad and saying them is wrong when these kids are going to realize that it actually 
isn't wrong. I'm talking about expletives or, as some people like to call them, curse words. 
The idea of bad words is a completely arbitrary one. A word that offends one person will be 
considered eloquent by someone else. Our predominately christian society fails to realize this 
simple premise. Yet even the people who buy into the whole idea that saying a word can be 
immoral, still do it when they are angry. If they happen to be with somebody then they might 
say something like "oh, pardon my language back there", but they don't really have a deep 
concern for what they did. If on the other hand, a five year old says something like "shut the 
hell up" it is appalling to them. So people punish their kids whenever they say one of these 
words. Then sometime around third or fourth grade in their time alone with friends they pass 
around expletives to each other like doritos. Sooner or Later they find out their parents are 
full of shit, tell their parents they are full of shit, and get grounded for saying the word "shit". 
When they grow up they become good cursing Americans like everybody else, have children 
of their own and repeat the whole process. It isn't only fundamentalist christians doing this 
either. There are people who own every season of South Park on dvd that still try to convince 
their kids that there are words that are wrong to say. These people either know they are lying 
to their kids or are in denial. Either way it's not very good parenting.
