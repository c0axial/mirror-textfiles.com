	INTRODUCTION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	In this file I am going to present to you the simple method(s) for making 
drinkable alcohol; this is so easy a kid could do it. There isn't much to introduce 
here, as everyone on Earth (well, almost everyone) knows what alcohol is, and the 
effects it has when it is consumed. So let's just get right to the alcohol production.

	We make ethanol (drinkable alcohol) by the fermentation of sugar using yeast. 
In this recipe, you will need three basic ingredients:

	*-Sugar
	*-Water
	*-Yeast

	Lets start with the yeast. You will go to Wal-Mart, or wherever, and go to the 
flour/sugar/cake section to find typical Baker's Yeast. You will find two items, either 
the yeast in small packets (sold as three packets each), or a small container of yeast. 
I suggest buying the packets. If you would like, though, you can order yeast off of the 
internet that will be better. The thing about baker's yeast is the bread taste that it 
has with it (this stuff is used to make bread), but it is tolerable and will work. If 
you order the yeast off of the internet, search for any yeast used to make high 
concentrations of alcohol. Either will work.

	The sugar is easy; just get a cheap bag of sugar. You'll only need a few cups 
per gallon of alcohol you make, so just get a big bag and make a crapload of alcohol; 
simple as that.

	Water is not extraordinarily important. If you have decent tap water in your 
house, then this will due just fine. If your tap water is suspect, or if you would like 
a "cleaner" tasting alcohol, then just buy a few gallons of drinking water (these are 
like 80 cents each). Also, you will need the 1-gallon jugs anyway, so you may as well 
just buy the gallons of drinking water and use the water they have.

	For the materials, you will need only a pack of balloons, and the gallon size 
jug(s). I will explain in a minute. When it comes to the gallon size jugs, I suggest 
using the drinking water jugs of course, but if you are forced to use a milk jug, then 
be certain to clean it out using bleach and hot water; you are going to be fermenting 
sugar in here for a few days, so you definitely want to make for certain that you don't 
get any crap bacterial growth in them. Things must be clean; period!

	To start, add 3 1/2 cups of sugar to the gallon sized jug. Next, fill it with 
13 cups of luke-warm water. Now, in a sauce pan (pot), add 1 cup of luke-warm water, 
and dump a packet of yeast in it. Do not stir the yeast; it will disturb it. You want 
to activate the yeast, so just let it sit there for a little while to hydrate. You will 
begin to notice that the yeast is foaming and bubbling. Once the yeast has dissolved 
completely into the cup of water, you can stir it a little bit, and add it to the 
gallon jug with the sugar and water. 

	Put the cap on the jug, and shake the living crap out of it to get all of the 
sugar and yeast dissolved completely in the water. You should notice immediate foaming 
action. Now take the cap off, and put a balloon over the top of the container; secure 
it with tape. Now poke about 5 very small pin holes in the top of the balloon. Now 
it's time to wait.

	When you are making alcohol, a by-product is carbon dioxide. This carbon 
dioxide needs to escape from the jug while also not letting oxygen in. Oxygen is 
damaging to the fermentation process, so the balloon protects everything from oxygen 
while also letting the carbon dioxide out safely. In a few hours, you will see the 
balloon inflate and hear the carbon dioxide coming out. Put the jug in a good place 
(like in your closet), and allow it to ferment for about 7 to 14 days. This time is 
not specific, but you can judge when the fermentation is done by viewing if the 
balloon has deflated. Once the balloon has deflated a lot, and is no longer putting 
off any gas, then your alcohol is ready.

	You should notice at the bottom of the container some sediment; this is just 
yeast leftovers that taste like bread and will make you fart (it's true). Simply pour 
the strange smelling sugar wine into a new container, and leave the yeast behind. If 
you want it to taste better, let it sit for about a month. It is perfectly fine to 
drink, though. The concentration of alcohol is low, but drinking it serves as no
problem whatsoever.

         CONCENTRATION
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

	Your new alcohol isn't exactly that concentrated; it might have 9% alcohol by 
volume at best. If you want to take advantage of the alcohol content, you can 
concentrate it with varying methods. You may have heard of distillation, which requires 
that you heat the alcohol to a vapor, and recondense it by itself to yield more pure 
alcohol. There are many methods to do this, which I will not cover due to the fact 
that I am aiming for ease. Simply do an internet search for "alcohol distillation" to 
find out how this is done; it's not that hard.

	If you would like an easy way to concentrate your alcohol, though; simply put 
it in the freezer. That's right, putting your jug of alcohol in the freezer will allow 
you to freeze the water, leaving behind a more concentrated form of alcohol. Simply put 
the jug of sugar wine in your freezer for a while, allow a lot of the water to freeze, 
then pour off the liquid, which should be a higher concentration of alcohol. Discard 
the water, of course.

	Now for a practical concern; larger amounts. Due to freezer space, you can't 
throw a bunch of jugs in there at once. I suggest making 1 to 2 gallons of homemade 
alcohol every day for 7 days. Label them for each day that you make them, and stick 
them in your closet as you make them. After about 7 days or so, when the first batch 
is done, simply put it in your freezer for a while and pour off the more concentrated 
alcohol. The following day, do the same thing with the next batch. Once you have done 
all of the batches (7 to 14 gallons), you should be left with *at least* a gallon or 
two of more concentrated alcohol. Take the concentrated alcohol, and put it in the 
freezer one more time in a final attempt to remove some of the water. Pour off the 
alcohol leaving the ice, and you should have a very good amount of some fairly decent 
concentration of drinkable alcohol - maybe upwards of 25-30% alcohol if you have done 
everything right.

	If you would like, at this point you can add flavoring. Simply add any extract
flavoring that you would like to add. Go to Wal-Mart, or wherever, and buy a small
thing of rum extract, or whatever you want to add. Adding a bottle of this stuff to
your alcohol will give it a better taste.

	Do not be confused; you're definitely not going to be making quality alcohol
using any of method here, but this stuff is drinkable.
