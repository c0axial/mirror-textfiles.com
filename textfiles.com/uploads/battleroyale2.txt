 
                              OPENING CRAWL
                    At the dawn of the millennium, the
                    nation collapsed. At 15%
                    unemployment, 10 million were out
                    of work. 800,000 students boycotted
                    school. The adults lost confidence,
                    and fearing the youth, eventually
                    passed the Millennium Educational
                    Reform Act, A.K.A. the Battle
                    Royale Act.

          EXT.DAY

          A helicopter hovers overhead. A television news crew and a
          female reporter are covering the winner of a Battle Royale
          coming home. Soldiers are keeping the news crew from getting
          good shots as the camera probes as if this were documentary
          news footage.

                              REPORTER
                    This year, Zentsuji Middle School
                    #4's Class E was chosen from among
                    43,000 ninth grade classes. This
                    year's game, said to be more
                    blistering than the last...

          A military jeep pulls up, with Mai, the winner, in the back.
          Her school uniform is tattered and blood-stained, and she is
          carrying a doll, also blood-stained. She looks sullen.

                              REPORTER
                    Oh, look, there! There she is! The
                    winner is a girl! Surviving a
                    fierce battle that raged two days,
                    seven hours, and 43 minutes, the
                    winner is a girl!

          Mai lifts her head up and flashes a creepy smile. She wears
          braces.

                              REPORTER
                    Look, she is smiling! Smiling!

          The smile looks creepier, like a smirk.

                              REPORTER
                    The girl definitely just smiled!

          Close up of the girl's face. The evil grin makes her look
          like she's about to kill someone with her bare hands just
          for the hell of it.
 
          OPENING CREDITS

          FADE IN on the class picture of Shiroiwa Junior High, Class
          3-B.

                                                          CUT TO:

          Close-up of the teacher, Kitano. Hold a few seconds.

                                                          CUT TO:

          Close-up of Boy #15, Shuya Nanahara.

                              SHUYA (V.O.)
                    Mom left when I was in fourth
                    grade, and my first day of seventh
                    grade, Dad hung himself.

          INT.NANAHARA APARTMENT

          Shuya comes home from school to find his father hanging,
          with toilet paper draped around his neck.

          The toilet paper reads: "Go, Shuya! You can make it, Shuya!"

          Shuya looks at this shocking scene, goes into the bathroom,
          and throws up.

                              SHUYA (V.O.)
                    Everything was crazy. I didn't have
                    a clue what to do, and no one to
                    show me either.

          INT.SCHOOL CLASSROOM

          Kitano (the teacher) is erasing the blackboard, which reads,
          "We took the day off because we wanted to. Class B." No one
          else is in the classroom.

          A female student, Noriko Nakagawa, enters the class.

                              NORIKO
                    Good morning!

                              KITANO
                    What?

                              NORIKO
                    I'm sorry, I'm late and I don't
                    know what's going on.

          Kitano erases the blackboard and leaves the class, followed
          by Noriko.
 
          INT.HALL

          As Kitano passes a door to another classroom, Yoshitoki
          Kuninobu suddenly runs out of the door and stabs Kitano in
          the buttock with a knife. He runs down the hall, bumps into
          Noriko and drops the knife. Noriko picks up the knife, hides
          it behind her. Kitano limps over to a faucet and cleans
          himself off.

                              SHUYA (V.O.)
                    Soon after that incident, that
                    teacher left our school.

          INT.BASKETBALL COURT

          Shuya and the rest of Class 1-B are playing Class 1-A.

          The five players on the floor for 1-B are Shuya Nanahara,
          Shinji Mimura, Keita Iijima, Hiroki Sugimura and Yoji
          Kuramoto. From the looks of it, Nanahara, Mimura, and
          Sugimura at the least are talented athletes.

          The rest of the class cheers them on, with some of the girls
          dressed as cheerleaders. The new teacher, Hayashida, is also
          cheering them on.

                              SHUYA (V.O.)
                    No matter how crazy the world was
                    getting, we all managed to have
                    fun.

          The ball is tipped. Shuya, Mimura, and Sugimura pass the
          ball around and get plenty of screen time. As Mimura makes
          the winning shot as time winds down, the rest of the class
          runs to the floor to congratulate them.

          One girl, Mitsuko "Hardcore" Souma, the class trollop, does
          not join in the celebration. She simply leaves the
          gymnasium, alone.

          INT.BUS

                              SHUYA (V.O.)
                    And so, our compulsory education
                    was coming to an end.

          The class is on a field trip. The students are laughing,
          goofing off, not paying attention to their surroundings. The
          teacher, Hayashida, looks out the bus's windows and notices
          that the bus route is lined with military jeeps.
 
          The two girls sitting on either side of Hayashida, Satomi
          Noda and Yukie Utsumi, notice the distraction. Utsumi is the
          class vice president.

                              NODA & UTSUMI
                    Teacher!

                              HAYASHIDA
                    Sorry, I was distracted.

          The girl sitting next to Noriko, Megumi Eto, is the class
          photographer. Her camera is a Polaroid instamatic.

                              MEGUMI
                         (to Noriko, who is sitting
                         beside her)
                    Let's go.

          They go to where Kuninobu and Shuya are sitting.

                              MEGUMI & NORIKO
                    Sorry! Sorry, let us through!

                              NORIKO
                    Nanahara, I baked some cookies for
                    us to share. For you too, Nobu.

                              KUNINOBU
                    For real?

          Kuninobu takes some cookies. Megumi has her camera out.

                              MEGUMI
                    Look over here!

                              KUNINOBU
                    Okay.

                              MEGUMI
                    Say cheese!

          Megumi takes a photo of Shuya, Noriko, and Kuninobu.

                              MEGUMI
                    Noriko has been waiting to give you
                    the cookies.

                              NORIKO
                    Megumi!

                              MEGUMI
                    It's okay.
 
                              KUNINOBU
                         (to Shuya)
                    You eat some too.

                              SHUYA
                    No, you go ahead.

                              KUNINOBU
                    Noriko, thanks for getting me to
                    come back to school.

                              NORIKO
                    I'm glad too, Nobu.

                              MEGUMI
                    Picture's ready!

          Megumi gives the picture to Kuninobu, who looks at it.
          Kuninobu's head is cut off in the photo.

                              KUNINOBU
                    I'm hardly in it!

          Megumi laughs.

          INT.BUS NIGHT

          The bus enters a tunnel. Sinister music plays. The students
          on the bus are gassed, fall asleep.

          Shuya, who was sleeping on his arm, wakes up as the arm
          gives way. He notices that all the students and teacher have
          fallen asleep. He stumbles to the back of the bus to find
          Noriko's cookies.

          The bus driver and a guide, who sits in the front, are
          wearing gas masks. The guide notices the commotion, gets up,
          walks back to Shuya, and whacks him in the head with a
          baton. Shuya falls back asleep.

          EXT.ISLAND NIGHT

          A few seconds of the waves coming ashore at night.

          INT.SCHOOL (D-6 ON MAP) NIGHT

          The gas wears off. The students are surprised to find
          themselves inside a school room. Shuya wakes up, nursing the
          whopper he received on the bus. He gets up, and notices that
          he is wearing an electronic metal collar around his neck.
 
          After a few seconds of orienting himself, he notices the
          other students in the room, all with metal collars around
          their necks similar to the one he is wearing.

          He goes over to Noriko, notices the collar.

                              SHUYA
                         (shaking Noriko)
                    Hey, Nakagawa!

          Shaking her awake is not working too well. He goes over to
          Kuninobu, notices that he is wearing a collar as well.

                              SHUYA
                         (shaking Kuninobu)
                    Nobu!

                              KUNINOBU
                         (groggily)
                    Huh? What?

          The students wake up and notice that they are in a darkened
          room. Shuya notices an older guy with a bandanna around his
          head in the corner, Shogo Kawada. He looks menacing.

          In the other corner of the room is another guy who looks
          older than the rest of the class, Kazuo Kiriyama. He has
          wild hair, and looks even more menacing than Kawada.

          Light comes through the windows. The kids rush to look out
          and see a helicopter land. A military escort rushes to the
          helicopter and a guard, Lieutenant Anjo, opens the door.
          Kitano, wearing a track suit, comes out of the helicopter.

          The soldiers escort Kitano to the room. Anjo unlocks the
          door and gestures to Kitano.

                              ANJO
                    After you.

          Kitano enters, escorted by Anjo and a few armed soldiers.
          Someone turns the lights on. A soldier knocks over a desk.
          Kitano takes his place at the front of the room.

                              KUNINOBU
                    Kitano?!

          Girl #10 Hirono Shimizu is in Mitsuko Souma's clique.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Kitano?! Can't be!
 
                              KITANO
                    Okay, sit down.

                              ANJO
                         (shouting like a drill
                         instructor)
                    Sit down! Now!

          The class sits down on the floor. There are some chairs,
          which are taken.

                              KITANO
                    It's been a while. I'm Kitano, your
                    seventh grade teacher. I'm taking
                    Class B over again. Let's be
                    friends. We have two transfer
                    students: Shogo Kawada ...
                         (points Kawada out)
                    over there, and Kazuo Kiriyama ...
                         (points Kiriyama out)
                    over there. Be nice to them.

          Kitano goes to the chalkboard and writes "The BR Act" in big
          letters on it.

          Boy #10 Ryuhei Sasagawa has long hair and is a stoner type.

                              SASAGAWA
                    Where the hell are we?

                              UTSUMI
                    What's going on here?

                              NODA
                    Who are these people?

                              KITANO
                         (points to the board)
                    Do you know this law?

          Pause. Dead silence.

                              KITANO
                    No good. That's what this country
                    has become. Do you want to know
                    why?

          Kitano throws chalk at Yoji Kuramoto, who was whispering to
          his girlfriend, Yoshimi Yahagi. Yahagi is in Souma's clique.

                              KITANO
                    No whispering, dammit!
 
          Yahagi runs to Kitano and shouts the next line in his face.

                              YAHAGI
                         (to Kitano)
                    You asshole!

                              KITANO
                    When someone is talking, shut up
                    and listen.

          Kitano pushes Yahagi away in the forehead.

          Girl #13 Takako Chigusa raises her hand. She is a pretty
          girl, considered by the boys to be the second-most beautiful
          in the class after Mitsuko Souma, and a track star.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Teacher, may I go to the bathroom?

                              KITANO
                    Chigusa, can't you wait a little?
                         (to the class)
                    I missed you guys.
                         (to Kuninobu)
                    Kuninobu, man, my ass hurt. Before
                    I quit, I told you not to bother
                    coming, that you were no good. And
                    you really started boycotting
                    school. That's no good. You're no
                    good, but you thought you'd come on
                    the class trip anyway, huh?

          Kuninobu makes a face at Kitano, who slaps Kuninobu.

                              KITANO
                    Listen up! Because of folks like
                    Kuninobu here, this country is
                    absolutely no good anymore! So the
                    bigwigs got together and passed
                    this law. Battle Royale!

          We hear a sinister music chord.

                              KITANO
                    So, today's lesson is ... you kill
                    each other off until there's only
                    one left. Nothing is against the
                    rules!

          Boy #2, Keita Iijima, laughs. He is the class clown.
 
                              KITANO
                    What's funny?

          Girl #5, Izumi Kanai, is puzzled. She is in the same gang as
          Sasagawa, its only female member.

                              KANAI
                    Teacher, I don't understand what
                    you are saying. This can't possibly
                    ...

                              KITANO
                    Actually, your teacher, Hayashida,
                    deeply opposed the selection of
                    Class B.

          Soldiers wheel Hayashida's body in on a gurney, under a
          sheet. Kitano pulls the sheet off to reveal that Hayashida
          has been shot in the back of the head, execution style. The
          students gasp.

                              KITANO
                    Now, calm down! Okay, this is a no
                    good adult! You have to work hard
                    to become not like him!

          The soldiers wheel Hayashida's body out of the room.

                              KITANO
                    Time to watch the video. Don't fall
                    asleep, now!

          Anjo pushes the play button on the video remote control. The
          television turns on.

          The video has a cheesy splash screen with a title, "The
          Right Way to Fight a Battle Royale! by the BR Action
          Committee".

          The video training woman looks like she's in her
          mid-twenties. She looks way too perky and addresses everyone
          the same way a kindergarten teacher addresses her class.
          She's dressed as if she were going hiking and is wearing a
          T-shirt with the letters "BR" on it. She salutes the class.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Hello, everyone in Shiroiwa Junior
                    High, Class 3-B!
 
                              KITANO
                         (acting like a kindergartener,
                         addressing the video)
                    Hello!

          The rest of the class is silent.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    You are the lucky class chosen for
                    this year's Battle Royale!
                    Congratulations!

                              KITANO
                         (still acting like a
                         kindergartener)
                    Thank you very much!

          The rest of the class is silent.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Now, I'm going to explain the rules
                    for you. Listen well to fight right
                    and with gusto!

          The video graphic shows the video training woman in front of
          a topographical map of the island.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    You are on a deserted island that
                    looks like this! It's about ten
                    kilometers around, but we evacuated
                    everyone, so it's empty!

          Kitano suddenly pauses the video. He catches Girl #18 Fumiyo
          Fujiyoshi whispering something to Yukie Utsumi.

                              KITANO
                    I said no whispering!

          Kitano throws a knife at Fujiyoshi. The knife impales
          Fujiyoshi squarely in the forehead. She falls to the floor
          and dies. The students are startled.

                              KITANO
                    All right, move, move!

          He walks over to Fujiyoshi's body.

                              KITANO
                         (to Fujiyoshi)
                    Sorry. It's against the rules for
                    me to kill, isn't it?
 
          Kitano kicks the body over so that Fujiyoshi is lying on her
          back.

          A graphic reads: "GIRL #18: FUMIYO FUJIYOSHI DEAD. 41
          PLAYERS LEFT."

          Kitano stands over the body and pulls the knife out of
          Fujiyoshi's forehead. The students panic and start running
          around, heading for the door to the room. Soldiers get in
          the way and act as a riot squad. They fire automatic weapons
          at the ceiling to calm the students down. Then they aim for
          the floor to push the students back. Kitano looks at the
          chaos around him gleefully.

          In the chaos, a bullet grazes Noriko in the left arm. Kitano
          winces as Noriko gets hurt. Megumi, Kuninobu, and Shuya go
          over to Noriko and inspect the damage.

                              MEGUMI
                    Nakagawa!

                              SHUYA
                    Noriko! Noriko!

                              KUNINOBU
                         (to Kitano)
                    You asshole!

          Kuninobu charges at Kitano.

                              SHUYA
                    Nobu!

          Kitano catches Kuninobu and, using the same knife he killed
          Fujiyoshi with, slashes Kuninobu in the buttock. He passes
          Kuninobu to Anjo, who punches Kuninobu in the face, pushing
          him back.

                              SHUYA
                    Nobu! Nobu! Shit!

          Shuya attempts to charge at Kitano, but Shinji Mimura and
          Hiroki Sugimura restrain him.

          The soldiers draw their weapons, aiming for Kuninobu. Kitano
          waves them off.

                              KITANO
                    Okay, back to the video!
 
                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    The island's divided into many
                    zones. Every six hours, your
                    teacher will broadcast updates ...

                              KITANO
                    Four times a day!

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    ... about which zones are becoming
                    danger zones. If you are in these
                    zones, you should leave quickly
                    because the danger is ... okay,
                    about the necklaces you are
                    wearing. They are one hundred
                    percent waterproof and shockproof
                    ... and permanent! It monitors your
                    pulse, informing us of your
                    location and movements. So if you
                    linger in a danger zone, or cause
                    trouble, we can identify you and
                    transmit radio waves that trigger
                    an alarm and BOOM! It explodes! If
                    you try to rip it off, it explodes
                    too, so promise not to try that,
                    okay?

                              KUNINOBU
                    You assholes!

          Boy #20 Kyouichi Motobuchi is the president of the class. He
          has a nerdy disposition and wears coke bottle glasses.

                              MOTOBUCHI
                    Shut up! I can't hear the video!
                    Cut it out, Nobu!

          Kuninobu charges Motobuchi. The two of them grapple for a
          few seconds.

                              MOTOBUCHI
                    Cut it out!

          Anjo pulls Kuninobu away from Motobuchi. Another soldier
          pushes Motobuchi back.

                              ANJO
                    Quiet! Cut it out!

          Anjo now has Kuninobu in a headlock.

          Kitano pulls a small remote control out of his pocket.
 
                              KITANO
                    I really hate to do this ...

          Kitano pushes a button on the remote, detonating Kuninobu's
          collar. An LED in the collar starts blinking. Kuninobu
          panics, Anjo releases him.

                              KITANO
                    Better run, guys!

                              KUNINOBU
                    What is this?

          Kuninobu runs around the room. The other students push him
          away.

                              KUNINOBU
                    Help me!

          He goes to Mimura, who pushes him away, then to Shuya.

                              KUNINOBU
                    Shuya!

                              SHUYA
                    Nobu!

          Kuninobu's collar explodes, sending shrapnel into his neck,
          killing him. His body falls to the floor, next to Fujiyoshi.
          Shuya walks over to Kuninobu's body and starts crying.

                              SHUYA
                         (crying)
                    Nobu!

          Shuya finds in Kuninobu's possession the photo that Megumi
          took on the bus. On the back of the photo it is written,
          "Hey, Shuya, do you have a crush on a girl now?" Shuya cries
          some more.

          A graphic reads: "BOY #7: YOSHITOKI KUNINOBU DEAD. 40
          PLAYERS LEFT."

                              KITANO
                    What a shame. I looked after him my
                    own way.

          Shuya gets up. He has a determined look on his face.

                              KITANO
                    What's that look for, Nanahara?
 
          Shuya tries to charge Kitano but Mimura, Sugimura, and a
          couple of the other students tackle him. When he gets up
          after the tackling, he notices Noriko right beside him and
          restrains himself.

          Kitano walks back to the front of the class, unpauses the
          video.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Oh, I forgot one important thing.
                    There's a time limit on this game!
                    Three days. If we haven't got a
                    winner after three days, all the
                    necklaces automatically explode!
                    And no one wins! So as long as
                    we're here, let's fight hard so
                    that doesn't happen!

                              KITANO
                    Okay, any questions so far?

          Motobuchi raises his hand.

                              KITANO
                    Yeah, Motobuchi.

                              MOTOBUCHI
                    If I survive, may I go home?

                              KITANO
                    Sure, but only if everyone else is
                    dead. Mimura?

                              MIMURA
                    How were we chosen?

                              KITANO
                    By impartial lottery.

          None of the students believe Kitano, thinking that he had a
          part in the selection of the class.

                              MIMURA
                    One more?

                              KITANO
                    Sure.

                              MIMURA
                    Why are you doing this?
 
                              KITANO
                    It's your own damn fault. You guys
                    mock grown-ups. Go ahead and mock
                    us, but don't you forget: life is a
                    game, so fight for survival and
                    find out if you're worth it.

          A panel in the back of the room opens up. Soldiers wheel in
          racks with lots of olive-green kits on them to the front of
          the room.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    You will leave the room one by one,
                    but first you get a kit.
                         (shows a display kit)
                    Inside is food and water, a map and
                    compass, a flashlight and a weapon,
                    so check it out later, okay? The
                    girls might need personal items, so
                    you can all take them. Each weapon
                    is different. Not just guns and
                    knives, either! It's random, so
                    maybe you'll get lucky, maybe not.
                    It eliminates natural advantages.
                         (picks up an ax)
                    Ooh, this one's super lucky!

                              KITANO
                    We've notified your parents, so go
                    for it!

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Okay, you'll be leaving by class
                    number. When I call your name, I
                    want to hear a nice big "Here!" Boy
                    #1, Yoshio Akamatsu!

          Yoshio Akamatsu is the token fat kid in the class.

                              AKAMATSU
                    Here!

          Terrified, Akamatsu grabs his personal belongings. A soldier
          tosses him a kit. In fear, he runs out of the classroom.

                              ANJO
                    Go!

                              AKAMATSU
                    Okay!

          A graphic reads: "DAY #1, 1:40 A.M. THE GAME BEGINS."

                    Girl #1, Mizuho Inada!

                              INADA
                    Here!

          Inada grabs her bag. Girl #20, Kaori Minami, grabs Inada.

                              MINAMI
                    Whatever happens, you are still my
                    friend!

                              INADA
                    I know!

          The guard throws Inada a kit and she runs out of the room.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Boy #2, Keita Iijima!

          Without saying a word, Iijima grabs his bag and runs to the
          front. The guard throws him a kit. He holds the kit above
          his ahead for a second before the guard tosses him out of
          the room.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN

          Utsumi grabs her bag, walks to the front, the guard tosses
          her a kit, and she walks out of the room.

                    Boy #3, Tatsumichi Oki!

          Oki grabs his bag, runs to the front of the room. The guard
          tosses him a kit. He doesn't catch it, but goes and gets it
          before running out of the room.

                         (almost crying)
                    I'm going, Noriko.

                              NORIKO
                    Megumi!

          Megumi grabs her bag, runs to the front. The guard tosses
          her a kit, and she runs out of the room.

                    Boy #4, Toshimori Oda!

          Oda grabs his things, runs to the front. The guard tosses
          him a kit, and he runs out of the room.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Girl #4, Sakura Ogawa!

          Ogawa holds her boyfriend's hand (her boyfriend is Boy #21,
          Kazuhiko Yamamoto) for a second. She goes to the front of
          the room. The guard tosses her a kit. She angrily throws the
          kit at Kitano (who catches it and tosses it back on the
          rack) before storming out of the room.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Boy #5, Shogo Kawada!

          Kawada was tying his shoes.

                              ANJO
                    Shogo Kawada!

          Kawada runs to the front, catches his bag, and runs out. In
          the hallway, he suddenly stops running.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Girl #5, Izumi Kanai!

          Kanai grabs her bag, gets tossed a kit, and runs out.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Boy #6, Kazuo Kiriyama!

          Kiriyama strolls to the front of the room nonchalantly, like
          he owns the place.

                              ANJO
                    On the double!

          Kiriyama gets tossed his kit, and as he leaves, he bumps
          into Kawada, who is running back into the room.

                              ANJO
                    What the --?

          Kawada tosses the guard his kit.

                              KAWADA
                    You gave me the wrong kit!

                              GUARD
                    What the hell?
 
                              KITANO
                         (to the class)
                    You probably guessed, but they are
                    a little dangerous.

          Kawada grabs a different kit off the rack, stares at
          Kiriyama, and storms out of the room.

          INT.SCHOOL LATER

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Girl #14, Mayumi Tendo!

          Tendo grabs her bag, the guard tosses her a kit, she leaves.

                              VIDEO TRAINING WOMAN
                    Boy #15, Shuya Nanahara!

          Shuya hesitates. He doesn't want to leave Kuninobu's body.
          He gives the photo to Noriko (who is Girl #15).

                              ANJO
                    Shuya Nanahara!

                              SHUYA
                         (to Noriko)
                    I'll wait for you outside.

          Shuya grabs his bag, the guard tosses him a kit, and he
          leaves.

          EXT.OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL (D-6 ON THE MAP)

          Shuya finds a spot to wait. He notices Girl #14, Mayumi
          Tendo, coming back toward him.

                              TENDO
                    Nanahara!

          Shuya gets the flashlight out of his kit and shines it at
          Tendo. She has a crossbow bolt lodged in her neck.

                              SHUYA
                    What happened?

                              TENDO
                    What am I going to do? What is
                    this?

          Mayumi Tendo collapses and dies in Shuya's arms.

                              SHUYA
                    Tendo!
 
          Yoshio Akamatsu shoots a crossbow bolt at Shuya, but barely
          misses him, hitting Tendo's body in the leg. Shuya takes the
          bolt and throws it back at Akamatsu, causing him to fall.
          Shuya then turns off the flashlight, grabs his kit, and runs
          back to Noriko, who has just exited the school.

                              SHUYA
                    Noriko, don't!

          Shuya takes Noriko down a path away from Akamatsu, who falls
          down a small hill, dropping his weapon.

                              AKAMATSU
                    Shit! What am I doing?

          Akamatsu looks around for the crossbow. Boy #16 Kazushi
          Niida, who has just exited the school, enters the scene.

                              NIIDA
                    What are you doing?

          Niida finds the crossbow.

                              NIIDA
                    Isn't this yours?

          Akamatsu charges Niida, who shoots Akamatsu in the chest
          with the crossbow. Akamatsu dies.

                              NIIDA
                    Shit! It's for real!

          Niida runs away with the crossbow.

          A graphic reads: "GIRL #14: MAYUMI TENDO DEAD. BOY #1:
          YOSHIO AKAMATSU DEAD. 38 PLAYERS LEFT."

          EXT.BEACH NIGHT

          Shuya and Noriko run towards the beach area, where they find
          a small cave.

          INT.CAVE NIGHT

          Shuya and Noriko hide in the cave, where they sit down.

                              SHUYA
                    Is your arm okay?

                              NORIKO
                    I was frantic!
 
                              SHUYA
                    Let's see.

          Shuya pulls Noriko's jacket off and inspects the wound.

                              SHUYA
                    It's just a scratch. I'll wash off
                    the blood.

          Shuya checks his pack, and finds an aluminum pot lid.

                              SHUYA
                    What's this? Fight with a pot lid?

          Noriko finds her weapon: binoculars.

                              NORIKO
                    And this is mine. The bastards --
                    goddammit!

                              SHUYA
                    Maybe Mimura and Sugimura and us
                    could all escape ...

          Shuya starts to wash off the wound.

                              NORIKO
                    I don't think so.

                              SHUYA
                    Why not?

                              NORIKO
                    You won't like me for saying this,
                    but I don't trust any of them
                    either.

          INT.SCHOOL FLASHBACK

          Fumiyo Fujiyoshi, Mayumi Tendo, and Yoshimi Yahagi have
          locked Noriko in a toilet stall.

                              FUJIYOSHI, TENDO, & YAHAGI
                    Die, Nakagawa, you ugly shrimpy
                    nit!

          Noriko, frustrated, tries to open the stall door. We see the
          graffiti inside the bathroom, which reads, "Noriko Nakagawa
          is an ugly shrimpy nit! DIE!"

          INT.CAVE NIGHT

                              SHUYA
                    How about me?
 
                              NORIKO
                    What?

                              SHUYA
                    Are you scared of me too?

                              NORIKO
                    You are the only one I trust,
                    Shuya. Oh, I'm sorry.

                              SHUYA
                    Why?

                              NORIKO
                    I called you by your given name,
                    just like Nobu.

          Shuya starts to cry.

                              SHUYA
                    Nobu ...

          INT.ROOM AT FOSTER HOME FLASHBACK

          Shuya and Kuninobu are roommates at the foster home.
          Kuninobu is lying in the top bunk, while Shuya is quietly
          strumming a guitar below.

                              KUNINOBU
                    Hey, Shuya!

                              SHUYA
                    Huh?

                              KUNINOBU
                    Do you have a crush on anyone now?

                              SHUYA
                    Why? Do you?

                              KUNINOBU
                    Maybe I kind of like someone ...

                              SHUYA
                    Who?

                              KUNINOBU
                    Noriko Nakagawa.

                              SHUYA
                    From our class?
 
                              KUNINOBU
                    Yeah.

                              SHUYA
                    She is a nice girl ...

                              KUNINOBU
                    Right? You agree ...

          Shuya puts his guitar away.

                              SHUYA
                    She's really sweet.

                              KUNINOBU
                    She wrote me, saying, "Come back to
                    school! Let's all go on the school
                    trip together!" Even if she didn't
                    really mean it, it's nice to have
                    someone waiting for you.

          INT.CAVE NIGHT

          Shuya uses a bandanna as a bandage for Noriko's wound.

                              SHUYA
                    We were roommates in the foster
                    home after Dad died. When I was
                    bummed after I quit baseball, he
                    taught me how to play the guitar.

                              NORIKO
                    I had to invite him ...

                              SHUYA
                    No, he was happy he came back.
                    Really happy. But I couldn't help
                    Nobu either. He needed my help, but
                    I couldn't help him. I can't give
                    this up, I'll take revenge for him.
                    I'll protect you to the end, in his
                    place.

                              NORIKO
                    Thank you, Nanahara.
                         (pause)
                    You never got to taste those
                    cookies, did you?
 
          INT.SCHOOL NIGHT

          Kitano and the soldiers are now using the school as a
          hideout. Computer monitors are in the background. Kitano is
          lying on a sofa, eating the cookies that Noriko made.

          Anjo walks up to Kitano.

                              ANJO
                    Numai's gang took Kiriyama.

          Anjo reaches for the cookie bag. Kitano grabs the bag and
          closes it.

                              ANJO
                    Already started on the painting?
                    Not wasting time ...

          EXT.BEACH (I-6 ON THE MAP) PRE-DAWN

          Numai's gang, consisting of Boy #9 Hiroshi Kuronaga, Boy #10
          Ryuhei Sasagawa, Boy #14 Shou Tsukioka, Boy #17 Mitsuru
          Numai, and Girl #5 Izumi Kanai, have surrounded Kazuo
          Kiriyama.

          Numai finds the weapon Kiriyama was assigned, a paper fan.

                              NUMAI
                    What's this?

          Numai plays a bit with the paper fan. The gang laughs.

                              NUMAI
                         (to Kiriyama)
                    You got a good one!

          Numai hits Kiriyama in the head with the paper fan twice.

                              NUMAI
                    Some transfer student!

                              KURONAGA
                    You're Kitano's agent!

                              TSUKIOKA
                    Going to make us kill each other,
                    eh?

                              SASAGAWA
                    Well, none of us is killing anyone!

                              KANAI
                    You better come clean now!
 
          Kiriyama is cornered. Sasagawa aims his weapon, a 9mm Uzi,
          at his forehead at point-blank range. Numai aims his weapon,
          a Colt .357 revolver, at Kiriyama's head as well.

                              SASAGAWA
                    Are you listening?

          Kiriyama spits his gum at Sasagawa, distracting him. While
          Sasagawa is distracted, Kiriyama grabs the Uzi.

                              SASAGAWA
                    Asshole!

          Kiriyama opens fire on the group, killing everyone except
          Kanai, who is wounded.

                              KANAI
                    Why? Stop! Stop!

          Kiriyama finishes off Kanai with a second round of bullets.
          He starts cleaning up, taking the Uzi and the Colt .357 as
          well as Kanai's weapon, hand grenades. He leaves Kuronaga's
          weapon, a dagger, and Tsukioka's weapon, nunchaku.

          A graphic reads: "BOY #9: HIROSHI KURONAGA DEAD. BOY #10:

          EXT.CLIFFS (A-2 ON THE MAP) PRE-DAWN

          Boy #21 Kazuhiko Yamamoto and Girl #4 Sakura Ogawa have
          arrived at the edge of a rocky cliff. It looks like a
          hundred feet or more between where they are and the jagged
          rocks below. The sound of gunfire is in the distance.

                              YAMAMOTO
                    I'm so sorry, Sakura, that I
                    couldn't help you.

                              OGAWA
                    No, I'm grateful you came with me.

                              YAMAMOTO
                    What will happen to us?

                              OGAWA
                    I know one thing.

                              YAMAMOTO
                    What?
 
                              OGAWA
                    I'll never play this game.

          Ogawa tosses her backpack off the cliff.

                              YAMAMOTO
                         (almost crying)
                    Can't anyone help us?

                              OGAWA
                    Nobody can.

          They get up, and bravely face their fate.

                              OGAWA
                    Here goes ...

          They jump off the cliff together.

                              YAMAMOTO & OGAWA
                    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!

          INT.KITCHEN (HOUSE AT B-4 ON THE MAP)

          Megumi Eto is hiding, looking at her instant photo
          collection. Most of the photos seem to be of Mimura.

                              MEGUMI
                    Mimura ...

          The door creaks open. Megumi quickly turns off the
          flashlight and aims her weapon, a stun gun, at the door.

                              MEGUMI
                    Who's there?

          Mitsuko "Hardcore" Souma, the class trollop, is at the door.

                              MITSUKO
                    Oh, it's you, Megumi.

                              MEGUMI
                    Who are you?

          Mitsuko shines her flashlight at her face, identifying
          herself.

                              MEGUMI
                    Mitsuko!
 
                              MITSUKO
                    Are you going to kill me with that
                    stun gun?

                              MEGUMI
                    What? Oh, I'm sorry. I was never
                    friendly with your clique, but
                    you're okay.

                              MITSUKO
                    So, can I come in?

                              MEGUMI
                    Sure, come in.

          Mitsuko comes in, closes the door, and sits down next to
          Megumi.

                              MITSUKO
                    All pictures of Mimura ...

          Megumi puts the pictures away.

                              MEGUMI
                    Oh no.

          Mitsuko grabs Megumi's stun gun.

                              MITSUKO
                    Is this your weapon?

                              MEGUMI
                    Not much use, yeah?

                              MITSUKO
                    Not necessarily. One zap at
                    somebody with a bad heart and he's
                    pretty much a goner. Have you ever
                    used one before?

                              MEGUMI
                    Of course not, sorry.

          The girls laugh, Mitsuko's is fake. Mitsuko hands the stun
          gun back.

                              MITSUKO
                    Here.

          As Megumi grabs it, Mitsuko pulls it away at the last
          second. Mitsuko starts chasing Megumi around the kitchen.

                              MEGUMI
                    Mitsuko! Don't!
 
          Mitsuko eventually gets Megumi in a headlock with her
          weapon, a sickle, at Megumi's throat. The blade of the
          sickle causes Megumi to start bleeding from the mouth.
          Megumi winces in pain.

                              MITSUKO
                    This is my weapon. I thought it was
                    so-so, but actually it's not so
                    bad. I found Yoshimi and Kuramoto
                    dead next door ...

          EXT.NEXT DOOR NIGHT

          Boy #8 Yoji Kuramoto and Girl #21 Yoshimi Yahagi have
          committed suicide by hanging themselves (Kuramoto's weapon
          was the rope).

          Back to Mitsuko, who has Megumi Eto in a headlock with the
          sickle.

                              MITSUKO
                    ... strung up all cozy together.
                    That's not my scene! I'm not going
                    down without a fight!

          Mitsuko slits Megumi's throat with the sickle. Blood pours
          out of Megumi's neck.

          DAY #1 - 6 A.M.

          Kitano is playing Johann Strauss's "Radetzky March" over the
          island's loudspeaker system. Shuya and Noriko get out of
          their cave.

                              KITANO
                         (over loudspeaker)
                    Hello! How is everyone? It's now 6
                    a.m., time for the sleepyheads to
                    wake up!

          Mitsuko Souma puts her hair in a towel. Over the next line,
          Shuya and Noriko walk and Mitsuko Souma curls her eyelashes.
 
                              KITANO
                         (over loudspeaker)
                    Here's a list of your dead friends
                    in the order in which they died:
                    Girl #14 Mayumi Tendo, Boy #1
                    Yoshio Akamatsu, Boy #9 Hiroshi
                    Kuronaga, Boy #10 Ryuhei Sasagawa,
                    Boy #14 Shou Tsukioka, Boy #17
                    Mitsuru Numai, Girl #5 Izumi Kanai,

                    Sakura Ogawa, Boy #8 Yoji Kuramoto,
                    Girl #21 Yoshimi Yahagi, and Girl
                    #3 Megumi Eto.

                              NORIKO
                    Megumi? No! Why?

                              KITANO
                         (over loudspeaker)
                    Twelve dead, the pace is good! Now,
                    the danger zones: I'll read off
                    zones and times, so check your

                    friends die on you, but hang in
                    there! Back in touch!

                              SHUYA
                    Noriko ...

                              NORIKO
                    Megumi is dead ...

                              SHUYA
                    This will be a danger zone. We've
                    got to go south. Hurry!

          EXT.FOREST PATH (E-8 ON THE MAP) MORNING

          Shuya and Noriko are walking along the path on the side of a
          hill when Boy #3 Tatsumichi Oki jumps out at Shuya with his
          weapon, a hand ax. Oki swings at both of them a few times,
          misses. Shuya throws his backpack at Oki, recognizes him.

                              SHUYA
                    Oki?

                              OKI
                    I'll get you! I'll get you!
 
          Shuya and Oki fight. Oki swings his hand ax at Shuya, who
          uses his pot lid as a shield. They grapple, and tumble down
          the hill. When we next see them, the hand ax is stuck in
          Oki's head.

          Girl #9 Yuko Sakaki witnesses this event. From her vantage
          point, it looks like Shuya killed Oki.

          Shuya and Oki get some separation, and Shuya notices the ax
          in Oki's head.

                              SHUYA
                    Oki, are you okay?

                              OKI
                         (groggily)
                    I'm sorry. I'm fine! I'm fine!

          Oki collapses and dies.

          Yuko Sakaki runs away, frightened. Noriko comes down the
          hill.

                              NORIKO
                    Nanahara!

                              SHUYA
                         (frightened)
                    Did I kill him? Tell me the truth!
                    You were watching! Did I?

                              NORIKO
                    It was an accident!

          Boy #20 Kyouichi Motobuchi shoots at Noriko and Shuya with
          his weapon, a Smith & Wesson M19 pistol. He misses them
          both.

                              MOTOBUCHI
                         (crazed)
                    X equals minus b over 2a ...
                    Everybody's serious, huh, fine then
                    ... I'll survive, go to a good
                    school ...

                              SHUYA
                    Stop!

          Motobuchi shoots again, misses. He chases Shuya and Noriko
          out into a clearing, where Kawada shoots him with his
          weapon, a SPAS-12 action shotgun.
 
                              MOTOBUCHI
                         (to Kawada)
                    Get out of my way!

          Motobuchi charges Kawada, firing his gun at him. Kawada
          returns fire, shoots him with the shotgun twice. Motobuchi
          dies; Kawada takes Motobuchi's pistol and aims it at Shuya
          and Noriko.

                              KAWADA
                    What weapons do you have?

                              SHUYA
                    A pot lid ...

                              NORIKO
                    ... and binoculars.

          While keeping the pistol aimed, Kawada goes over to Oki's
          corpse and removes the hand ax from his head.

          Girl #7 Yumiko Kusaka starts shouting over a megaphone.

                              KUSAKA
                         (over megaphone)
                    Everybody! Stop fighting! Please
                    hear us out!

          Kawada, Shuya, and Noriko move towards Kusaka. Noriko uses
          her binoculars to get a closer look at Kusaka, who is with
          Girl #6 Yukiko Kitano (no relations) on a cliff. Kusaka is
          trying to draw attention to herself.

                              KUSAKA
                         (over megaphone)
                    This is Kusaka, with Yukiko, on the
                    cliffs of North Mountain! Everybody
                    come here! We'll figure this out
                    together! We don't want to fight!
                    Right, Yukiko?

          Kusaka hands the megaphone to Yukiko Kitano.

                              YUKIKO KITANO
                         (over megaphone)
                    This is Yukiko! Please join us!
                    Let's think this through together!

                              SHUYA
                    That's the right tactic.

          Shuya starts to leave.
 
                              KAWADA
                    Where are you going?

                              SHUYA
                    To bring them back.

                              KAWADA
                    Without weapons? I'm not the only
                    deadly one around here!

          Mitsuko Souma runs, ducks, and hides.

                              SHUYA
                    All the more if they are in danger
                    ...

          Kawada fires a shot into the air. Kusaka and Yukiko duck,
          scared.

                              SHUYA
                         (to Kawada)
                    You!

          Shuya and Kawada wrestle over the shotgun a little.

                              YUKIKO KITANO
                         (over megaphone)
                    Stop shooting!

                              SHUYA
                         (shouts)
                    Idiots! Run!

                              KUSAKA
                         (to Yukiko Kitano)
                    That's Nanahara! That was his
                    voice, right?
                         (over megaphone)
                    Nanahara! Over here! Come here!
                    Yukiko has always had a crush on
                    ...

                              YUKIKO KITANO
                    You idiot!

          Kazuo Kiriyama, positioned behind Kusaka and Yukiko Kitano,
          fires a burst of bullets into both of them with his Uzi,
          killing Yukiko Kitano and seriously wounding Kusaka. Kawada,
          Shuya, and Noriko look startled. Mitsuko runs off.
 
          Kiriyama walks nonchalantly over to the bodies, gets the
          megaphone, goes over to Kusaka (who is still moving), kicks
          her over so that she is lying on her back, and holds the
          megaphone to her mouth.

                              KUSAKA
                         (pained, scared as hell,
                         through the megaphone)
                    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!!

          Kiriyama finishes off Kusaka with another burst of bullets
          from his Uzi.

                              SHUYA
                         (shouts)
                    Kusaka! Kusaka! Kitano! Answer me!
                    Tell me it's not true! Answer me,
                    Kusaka!

                              KAWADA
                    He'll come here next! I'm off!

                              SHUYA
                    Go wherever you like! You're a
                    murderer yourself!

                    Nanahara!

                              SHUYA
                    Those were my friends! This is
                    crazy! How can they just kill each
                    other like that?

                              KAWADA
                    There's a way out of this game.
                    Kill yourselves right here and now.
                    If you can't do that, then don't
                    trust anyone. Just run!

          DAY #1 - NOON

          Kitano is playing Johann Strauss's "Blue Danube Waltz" over

                         (over loudspeaker)
                    It's noon. Is everybody getting
                    hungry? It's time to take a little
                    lunch break from the slaughter! Now
                    for the list of who went down this
                    morning: Boy #3 Tatsumichi Oki, Boy

                    Kusaka. A total of four. Calling
                    for peace was a good idea, but you
                    can't win them all. Now for the
                    danger zones and hours: an hour
                    from now at 1:00 p.m., I-4. Then
                    from 3:00, E-9. From 5:00, F-1.

          EXT.MITSUKO'S HIDEOUT (C-5 ON THE MAP) AFTERNOON

          Mitsuko walks back to find Girl #10 Hirono Shimizu pointing
          her weapon, a Colt .45 pistol, at her.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Mitsuko ...

                              MITSUKO
                    Hirono!

                              SHIMIZU
                    Oh great, I finally found you.

          Shimizu spins Mitsuko around and takes the sickle.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Is this your weapon, Mitsuko?

                              MITSUKO
                    Yeah.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Kind of lame, huh?
                         (goes around Mitsuko to face
                         her)
                    Yoshimi's dead, isn't she?

                              MITSUKO
                    With Kuramoto.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Huh? So you saw them. Well, I saw
                    Megumi's throat slit ... with a
                    sickle or something!
 
          Shimizu throws the sickle at Mitsuko. She hits a wooden
          post, narrowly missing Mitsuko's head.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Mitsuko! Do you have Megumi's
                    weapon?

                              MITSUKO
                    Of course not!

                              SHIMIZU
                    But it looked like someone was
                    there all night. I found a tampon
                    in the toilet. Megumi wasn't having
                    hers ... Mitsuko, you started
                    yesterday, right?

                              MITSUKO
                    What are you talking about?

                              SHIMIZU
                    Cut the crap, murderer! You screw
                    all the boys, but you had to steal
                    mine! You were pimping Yoshimi! You
                    probably hung them both!

                              MITSUKO
                    How can you ...

                              SHIMIZU
                    You piss me off, and I'll kill you!

                              MITSUKO
                         (crying and kneeling down as
                         Shimizu lowers the gun)
                    Come on! What is this? Stop joking
                    and forgive me!

          Shimizu starts kicking Mitsuko in the head.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Stop faking it!

                              MITSUKO
                    I've had it! Why does everybody
                    gang up on me? What did I do?

          Shimizu gives Mitsuko a swift kick.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Think about what you did! You think
                    you can get away with it!
 
          Shimizu kicks Mitsuko again. Mitsuko cries.

                              SHIMIZU
                    Cry your eyes out! Apologize to
                    Megumi and Yoshimi!

          Mitsuko tasers Shimizu in the gun hand with the stun gun
          that belonged to Megumi. Shimizu drops the pistol. The two
          of them reach for it like a fumble in football, with Mitsuko
          winning. She aims the pistol at Shimizu.

                              MITSUKO
                         (indicating the stun gun)
                    This was Megumi's ...
                         (indicating Shimizu's gun)
                    but this is what I was after.

                              SHIMIZU
                    You bitch! Murderer!

                              MITSUKO
                    And what's wrong with killing?
                    Everyone has his reasons.

          Shimizu throws her bag at Mitsuko and tries to run away. She
          gets about four steps before Mitsuko shoots her in the back.

          EXT.CLIFFS (I-5 ON MAP)

          Shuya and Noriko are walking near a cliff when Noriko
          faints.

                              SHUYA
                    Nakagawa, are you okay?

                              NORIKO
                    I'm okay, just a little tired.

                              SHUYA
                    You're dripping sweat and have a
                    terrible fever.

                              NORIKO
                    Yukiko had a crush on you, right?

                              SHUYA
                    What does that have to do with
                    anything?
 
                              NORIKO
                    Sorry, I'm just a little jealous,
                    that's all.

          Shuya checks his map.

                              SHUYA
                    There's a clinic outside the
                    village. Can you get up?

          Noriko falls unconscious.

                              SHUYA
                    Hey, Noriko, come on now ...
                    Noriko!

          EXT.CLINIC (I-8 ON THE MAP)

          Shuya, carrying Noriko, walks up to the clinic. It's a
          shabby house with a live chicken walking in front of it. He
          breaks down a gate as he comes.

          As he gets closer, he snags his foot on a tripwire that's
          connected to jar with a set of keys in it, a makeshift
          doorbell. Kawada opens the door, shotgun aimed at Shuya.

                              KAWADA
                    Pot lid and binoculars, what do you
                    want?

          INT.CLINIC

          Noriko lies on a sofa, her arm bandaged with a bandanna.
          Hypodermic needles and open vials are scattered.

                              KAWADA
                    Great. Even expired drugs work.

          Kawada starts cleaning up, frenetically.

                              SHUYA
                    May I ask you ...

                              KAWADA
                    What?

                              SHUYA
                    Why did you help us?

                              KAWADA
                    My father is a doctor. You may
                    believe that or not.
 
          Kawada finds some dried rice and starts making soup.

          EXT.MIMURA'S LAIR (E-4 ON THE MAP) LATE AFTERNOON

          Mimura's lair is an abandoned hotel. Boy #11 Hiroki Sugimura
          tracks down Mimura's gang (Boy #2 Keita Iijima, Boy #12
          Yutaka Seto, and Boy #19 Shinji Mimura).

                              MIMURA, SETO, & IIJIMA
                         (from inside, in unison)
                    Ready, go!
                         (pause)
                    Ready, go!

          The three boys are lugging a large electric generator up a
          flight of steps as Sugimura finds them.

                              SUGIMURA
                    Mimura!

                              MIMURA
                    Sugimura!

          Sugimura steps in to help.

          INT.MIMURA'S LAIR

          They get the generator up the stairs and turn it on. They
          connect Mimura's laptop computer and some portable phones to
          it. Mimura turns the laptop on. Mimura's wallpaper reads,
          "The Third Man".

                              MIMURA
                    Great, it still works.
                         (to Sugimura)
                    How did you find us?

          Sugimura shows him his GPS tracking device.

                              SUGIMURA
                    This is my weapon.

                              MIMURA
                    A sensor? Great weapon!

                              SUGIMURA
                    Have you seen Chigusa or Kotohiki?

                              MIMURA
                    No, I haven't.

                              SUGIMURA
                    Right, I'm off.
 
                              SETO
                    Already?

                              MIMURA
                    Sugimura, there may be a way out.
                    Won't you help us?

                              SUGIMURA
                    Sorry, but I have to see them.

                              MIMURA
                    If you find Nanahara, tell him
                    where we are.

                              SUGIMURA
                    Right, I'm off.

          Sugimura leaves.

                              IIJIMA
                    He always was a loner.

                              SETO
                    Why does he have to find Chigusa
                    and Kotohiki?

                              MIMURA
                    I thought he was into Chigusa.

          Mimura sits down at the laptop, and notices something about
          his collar.

                              MIMURA
                    Shit, so that's their trick!

                              IIJIMA
                    What is it?

          He gestures Iijima and Seto over to the computer, where
          Mimura runs an editor.

                              MIMURA
                         (typing)
                    They're listening. A microphone in
                    the necklace. Here's your mission:
                    Find the following: 1. Fertilizer
                    2. Pesticides 3. Charcoal 4. Sulfur
                    5. Kerosene

                              IIJIMA
                    Hey, what is this?
 
                              MIMURA
                    Just go! Hurry!

          Mimura starts cracking the Battle Royale computer network.

          EXT.FANTASY SEQUENCE

          Girl #13 Takako Chigusa is jogging along a road, wearing a
          yellow Adidas warm-up suit. Sugimura is behind her wearing a
          white T-shirt and black warm-up pants, carrying a stopwatch
          and a whistle around his neck, riding a bicycle. Neither of
          them are wearing collars at this point.

          An opera singer singing Franz Shubert's "Auf dem Wasser zu
          Singen" plays in the background.

                              SUGIMURA
                    Chigusa, how far can you run?

                              CHIGUSA
                    I'll always run in front of you!

                              SUGIMURA
                    Then I'll always protect you.

                              CHIGUSA
                         (laughs)
                    Promise?

          Chigusa turns off the road onto a dirt path. She turns
          around to face the road and runs back towards it. The
          transition between this and the next scene is seamless ...

          EXT.TEMPLE (E-2 ON THE MAP) AFTERNOON

          Chigusa is wearing the same warm-up suit, but she has the
          collar on. The bicycle and Sugimura have disappeared.
          Chigusa notices the collar.

          She runs up to the temple where her bag is, unzips her track
          suit showing a white T-shirt, and gets a towel out of her
          bag.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Hiroki ...

          Boy #16 Kazushi Niida enters. He's carrying the crossbow he
          got from Akamatsu earlier.

                              NIIDA
                    Hey, Chigusa, what are you doing?

          Chigusa tosses the towel back into the bag.
 
                              NIIDA
                    Are you still practicing?

          She zips the bag and walks away from him.

                              NIIDA
                    Hey, wait up! They all gossiped
                    about us!

                              CHIGUSA
                    You made it all up!

                              NIIDA
                    But you liked it. Come on, Chigusa,
                    stay with me.

          Niida touches Chigusa on the shoulders.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Don't touch me! Disgusting!

          Niida aims the crossbow at Chigusa.

                              NIIDA
                    If you run, I'll shoot!

                              CHIGUSA
                    What's that? You're ridiculous.

          Chigusa moves away from him again.

                              NIIDA
                    I'm in love with you, Chigusa, for
                    real, from before ...

                              CHIGUSA
                         (underwhelmed)
                    Wow, great, wash your face and try
                    again, if you survive.

                              NIIDA
                    Wait, you're a virgin, right?

                              CHIGUSA
                    You're starting to piss me off.
                    God, spare me from this idiot!

                              NIIDA
                    Sugimura couldn't do it with you!

                              CHIGUSA
                    Leave Hiroki out of this!
 
                              NIIDA
                    We're going to die anyway. Don't
                    you want to do it just once before
                    you die?

                              CHIGUSA
                    Shouldn't you be worried about your
                    life, instead of that useless
                    micropenis of yours?

          Niida gets in front of Chigusa and aims the crossbow at her
          face.

                              NIIDA
                    I have decided that this game is a
                    race, so I am playing for real.

                              CHIGUSA
                    So am I. Drop your weapon and let
                    me go, or I'll assume you're deadly
                    and kick your ass!

          She tries to pass him.

                              CHIGUSA
                    You have been warned.

                              NIIDA
                    Cut the crap! I've already killed,
                    and I could rape you now if I
                    wanted to!

                              CHIGUSA
                    Just try it!

          Niida fires the crossbow at Chigusa. The bolt scrapes her
          right cheek.

                              NIIDA
                    Are you okay?

                              CHIGUSA
                         (mad as hell)
                    You scarred my face!

                              NIIDA
                    It's your fault. You made me mad!

                              CHIGUSA
                    You're always blaming someone else!
                    That's why I hate your guts!
 
          Chigusa reaches into her bag and pulls out her weapon, a
          jackknife.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Come at me! I shall resist you with
                    every inch of my body!

          Niida gets frightened and runs, but Chigusa has a speed
          advantage, and catches him. She slashes him in the back.
          They grapple for a bit. He gets up, continues running.

                              CHIGUSA
                    You bastard!

          Chigusa easily catches up to Niida, slashes him in the back
          again, jumps on his back.

                              NIIDA
                    Let me go!

          Chigusa rides him for a bit and stabs him in the chest.

                              NIIDA
                    Leave me alone!

          She gets him on the ground, jumps on top of him, stabs him
          twice in the groin area, gets off him, then stabs him in the
          chest twice. Niida dies.

          When she gets up, Mitsuko Souma is in the background. She
          grins an evil grin, then aims her gun at Chigusa. Chigusa
          notices, then runs for her life. Mitsuko chases after her,
          firing four bullets at Chigusa.

          EXT.DAM (D-3 ON THE MAP)

          Chigusa is lying down, covered with dirt and blood, and
          close to death. Sugimura catches up to her.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Hiroki!

                              SUGIMURA
                    Chigusa, don't die! Hang on!

                              CHIGUSA
                    God, if this is a bad joke, please
                    stop it.
 
                              SUGIMURA
                    It's really me, Chigusa.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Hiroki ...

                              SUGIMURA
                    Who got you?

                              CHIGUSA
                    Mitsuko. Watch out for her, she's
                    dangerous.

                              SUGIMURA
                    I'm sorry.

                              CHIGUSA
                    For what?

                              SUGIMURA
                    Last night, I waited for you
                    outside the school. But you took
                    off at top speed, right? I called,
                    but I couldn't catch up.

                              CHIGUSA
                    I didn't know. Could you help me
                    sit up?

          Sugimura sits Chigusa up and props her against his shoulder.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Hiroki, are you in love with
                    someone?

                              SUGIMURA
                    Yeah.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Not me, right?

                              SUGIMURA
                    Not you.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Then stay with me like this. It
                    won't be long.

          Sugimura starts crying.
 
                              CHIGUSA
                         (looking upward)
                    God, could I tell him one more
                    thing?
                         (to Hiroki)
                    You look really cool, Hiroki.

                              SUGIMURA
                    You too. You're the coolest girl in
                    the world.

                              CHIGUSA
                    Thank you ...

          Chigusa dies. Sugimura props her head up by the chin, looks
          into her eyes, and notices she isn't moving by herself.
          Sugimura cries.

                              SUGIMURA
                    Chigusa!

          INT.CLINIC EVENING

          Noriko and Shuya are eating soup by candlelight. Kawada is
          lying on the sofa.
 
                              NORIKO
                    It tastes good.

                              KAWADA
                    Of course it does. My dad is a
                    chef.

                              NORIKO
                         (to Kawada)
                    Umm, thank you for everything.

                              KAWADA
                         (to Shuya)
                    Would you like a drink?

                              SHUYA
                    No.

          Kawada lights a cigarette, pauses.

                              KAWADA
                    I wasn't going to, but I guess I
                    want you to know.

          Kawada takes out a picture, hands it to Noriko, who looks at
          it. The picture is of Kawada and his late girlfriend Keiko.

                              NORIKO
                    She's pretty ... the same age as
                    you?

                              KAWADA
                    The same class. Ninth grade, Kobe
                    Junior High #5 Class C. We played
                    this game three years ago.

                              SHUYA
                    So you are ...

          Kawada takes off his bandanna, revealing a scar on his
          forehead.

                              KAWADA
                    I'm a survivor of this stupid game.

          Shuya and Noriko gasp.

                              KAWADA
                    I was desperate to protect Keiko,
                    even killed a friend so that the
                    two of us could survive.
 
          EXT.HILL - THE GAME THREE YEARS AGO - NIGHT

          Two minutes left until the collars explode. The hill is
          strewn with corpses. Kawada and Keiko, heavily wounded, walk
          into the scene.

                              KAWADA (V.O.)
                    But when only one of us could
                    survive, we changed.

          Kawada's and Keiko's collars start blinking. They hug each
          other. An unseen third player shoots Kawada. He falls down
          the hill, wounded. Keiko and the third player fire at each
          other. The third player dies; Keiko, wounded, falls down the
          hill near Kawada, who goes over to her.

                              KAWADA
                    Keiko! Keiko! Keiko!

          Kawada's collar starts blinking faster.

          INT.CLINIC EVENING

          Kawada puts his bandanna back on.

                              KAWADA
                    Really trusting someone is a hard
                    thing to do, but I've never
                    understood the meaning of the smile
                    she left behind.

          EXT.HILL NIGHT - FLASHBACK

          Kawada hugs Keiko for the final time.

                              KEIKO
                    Thank you ...

          Keiko dies. The collars stop blinking, as Kawada is the
          winner.

          INT.CLINIC EVENING

          Kawada takes a swig out of his flask. Shuya hands the photo
          back to Kawada.

                              SHUYA
                    I think I'll have that drink now.

          Kawada gives the flask to Shuya, who takes a swig.

                              SHUYA
                    But why play all over again?
 
                              KAWADA
                    They drugged me and dragged me here
                    to fix the game. But when I woke up
                    here, I vowed I wouldn't die.
                    Instead, I'm going to figure out
                    Keiko's last smile.

                              NORIKO
                    I don't ...

                              KAWADA
                    What?

                              NORIKO
                    I don't know how Keiko felt then,
                    but she must have ... um ...

                              KAWADA
                    My name? Kawada.

                              NORIKO
                    Kawada, I think she really loved
                    you or she couldn't have smiled the
                    way she does there.

          Close up of the photo of Keiko.

                              KAWADA
                    So you think ...

                              NORIKO
                    I'm sure if I were Keiko, I'd want
                    to trust you and thank you for
                    giving me a reason to smile like
                    that. I think I'd have said thank
                    you, too.

          Pause. Kawada thinks for a moment, gets up.

                              KAWADA
                    I really do know a way off this
                    island.

                              SHUYA
                    What? But how?

                              KAWADA
                    I can only tell you when the time
                    comes. Until then, this is my
                    guarantee.

          Kawada tosses the Smith & Wesson M19 that he got from
          Motobuchi to Shuya, along with a box of bullets.
 
                              KAWADA
                    Use it to protect yourself and ...
                    um ...

                              NORIKO
                    Noriko Nakagawa.

                    Shuya Nanahara.
 
          An automatic weapon is fired in the distance.

                              KAWADA
                    The candles!

          Kawada draws the curtains while Noriko and Shuya extinguish
          the candles.

                              KAWADA
                    Duck!

          They cover.

                              SHUYA
                    The noise ... who is that?

                              KAWADA
                    Probably the guy who signed up for
                    kicks. We had one too.

          EXT.PATH (I-6 ON MAP) EVENING

          Boy #4 Toshimori Oda is riding a bicycle as fast as he can
          pedal. Boy #6 Kazuo Kiriyama is chasing him on foot,
          shooting his Uzi at Oda.

          Oda, frightened out of his wits, gets off the bike and runs
          on foot to the clinic.

          INT.CLINIC EVENING

          Shuya, Noriko, and Kawada duck out of the way of the
          windows.

                              KAWADA
                    Quick! Give me the map!

          Shuya fetches his map and the three of them glance at it.

                              KAWADA
                    Listen, if we get separated, we'll
                    meet at the Takano Shrine. Don't
                    forget! Stay down!

          EXT.OUTSIDE CLINIC EVENING

          Kiriyama is still chasing Oda and firing his Uzi at him.

                              ODA
                         (to Kiriyama)
                    Hey! What did I ever do to you?
 
          Kiriyama shoots a barrage of bullets at Oda, who falls down.
          Oda plays possum.

          INT.CLINIC EVENING

          Kawada, Shuya, and Noriko lock the doors.

          EXT.OUTSIDE CLINIC EVENING

          Close-up of Oda, who covered his face with his map. He takes
          the map off his face and props himself up. He looks around:
          the coast is clear. Oda laughs.

                              ODA
                    Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! I made it,
                    thanks to my excellent bulletproof
                    vest!

          He hears a sound coming from above him. Pan up to Kiriyama
          on the roof of the clinic. He unsheaths a katana (Girl #7
          Yumiko Kusaka's weapon, obtained after she died), jumps down
          to Oda.

                              ODA
                    Aaaaaaaaaahhhh!

          Kiriyama decapitates Oda with the katana. Oda dies.

          INT.CLINIC EVENING

          Noriko, scared, hugs Shuya.

          EXT.OUTSIDE CLINIC EVENING

          A graphic reads: "BOY #4: TOSHIMORI ODA DEAD. 20 PLAYERS
          LEFT."

          Kiriyama takes the bulletproof vest from Oda and puts it on.
          He puts the katana back in its scabbard, then figures out
          that people are inside the clinic.

          INT.CLINIC EVENING

          Kawada pumps his shotgun, aiming for the windows, hoping to
          get a clear shot at Kiriyama. Shuya draws his gun and aims
          for Kiriyama.

          Kiriyama tries opening the door of the clinic, but it is
          locked and he is unsuccessful. He gets Oda's decapitated
          head, shoves a live grenade (obtained from Girl #5 Izumi
          Kanai when he killed her) in its mouth, and throws it
          through a window.
 
                              NORIKO
                         (screaming)
                    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

          Kawada, Noriko, and Shuya jump out of the way of the
          grenade's explosion.

                              KAWADA
                    Hurry!

          Kiriyama fires a burst into the clinic through a window.
          Kawada and Noriko dive under tables, ducking.

                              SHUYA
                    Are you okay?

                              KAWADA
                    Fine! She's all right too!

          Kiriyama fires another burst.

                              SHUYA
                    Take care of her!

                              KAWADA
                    Don't be crazy!

          Shuya runs through a window after Kiriyama. A grenade
          explodes behind him.

                              NORIKO
                    Nanahara!

          EXT.DOCKS (I-8 ON THE MAP) EVENING

          Shuya shoots at Kiriyama, who put on the bulletproof vest he
          got from Oda so the shot has no effect. Kiriyama shoots a
          burst back. Shuya shoots again.

          Sugimura, nearby, hears the sounds of gunfire. He gets out
          the tracking device and notices that Shuya and Kiriyama are
          running towards him.

          Kiriyama shoots again at Shuya, chewing up the ground with
          bullets as Shuya runs away from Kiriyama. Kiriyama notices
          that his clip is empty, removes it from the Uzi. Shuya fires
          a bullet at him from point-blank range, but since Kiriyama
          has the bulletproof vest, it has no effect (he fired at
          Kiriyama's chest). Kiriyama just smiles at Shuya and tosses
          the empty clip at him. Shuya fires another round at
          Kiriyama, who has reloaded the Uzi. It has no effect.

          Shuya flees, jumping off a small cliff into the ocean.
 
                              SUGIMURA
                    Run, Nanahara!

          Sugimura tackles Kiriyama, altering his aim so that he can't
          hit Shuya. Kiriyama fires the Uzi at Sugimura, who jumps
          into the water after Shuya. Kiriyama sprays a burst of
          bullets into the water, hoping to hit Sugimura.

          INT.MIMURA'S LAIR NIGHT

          Seto and Iijima have found all the items on the list and
          have brought them back to Mimura.

                              IIJIMA
                         (exhausted)
                    There's your order. Fertilizer ...
                    pesticides ... and kerosene ...

                              SETO
                         (exhausted)
                    Sulfur and charcoal. We even swiped
                    a little truck for it all.

                              IIJIMA
                    What are you going to do with all
                    this crap?

          Mimura tosses an underground anarchist magazine at Iijima.
          Its title is "The Ticking Clock".

                              IIJIMA
                    "The Ticking Clock". What is this?

          Iijima opens the magazine and postcards fall out. He picks
          up the postcards.

                              MIMURA
                    They are my uncle's postcards. He
                    was an activist in the 1960s. He
                    taught me stuff they never teach
                    you in school. He's still off
                    fighting in some corner of the
                    world.

          Close up of a postcard with a picture of a smiling woman.
          Iijima flips the postcard to the back. The message reads,
          "Someday, you'll smile like this."

          Iijima laughs.

                              IIJIMA
                    Forget it! We're not ...
 
          Mimura muzzles Iijima and points at Seto.

                              SETO
                    Shinji!

          Mimura gives the "quiet" gesture by putting a finger near
          his mouth.

                              MIMURA
                    Ssshhh!

          He takes out a small device, then puts his hand over his
          collar to block the microphone.

                              MIMURA
                    This is the bomb trigger he used to
                    try to blow up the Parliament with.
                    It's time we started our own
                    struggle, but there isn't much
                    time. So, do you join me, or would
                    you rather take me on?

          Seto shakes his head. He's joining Mimura.

                              IIJIMA
                    Can we really all go home together?

                              MIMURA
                    Yeah, I'll crush their systems.
                    When we escape, it will be
                    together.

          A graphic reads: "DAY 2 - 12:30 P.M."

          INT.LIGHTHOUSE DAY

          Shuya is waking up in a bed. He is heavily bandaged. Girl #2
          Yukie Utsumi is lying beside him. She is startled.

                              UTSUMI
                    You're awake!

                              SHUYA
                    Where am I?

                              UTSUMI
                    You are at the lighthouse.
 
                              SHUYA
                    Utsumi, why are you ...

                              UTSUMI
                    What a shock! I was on watch this
                    morning when Sugimura showed up
                    carrying you.

          EXT.LIGHTHOUSE NIGHT - FLASHBACK

          Sugimura comes out of the water, carrying Shuya. He takes
          Shuya to the lighthouse, where Utsumi is on watch.

          INT.LIGHTHOUSE DAY

          Back to Shuya and Utsumi.

                              SHUYA
                    Where's Sugimura?

                              UTSUMI
                    He's gone. He said that he had to
                    see someone.

                              SHUYA
                    I see. What time is it?

                              UTSUMI
                    Kitano just finished the noon
                    report.

                              SHUYA
                    What about Kawada and Nakagawa?

                              UTSUMI
                    They haven't been on the lists.

          Shuya breathes a sigh of relief.

                              SHUYA
                    Who died? I missed three reports.

                              UTSUMI
                    Five all together. Oda was on last
                    night's.

                              SHUYA
                    Ugh ...

                              UTSUMI
                    On this morning's, Kaori and
                    Mizuho.
 
          EXT.BEACH (H-3 ON THE MAP) EARLY MORNING - FLASHBACK

          In the background, waves are lapping on the shore. In the
          foreground, Girl #1 Mizuho Inada is lying on a rock with a
          bloodstain on her abdomen and a large alpinist's pick
          nearby. Next to her is a life preserver, and next to that on
          another rock is Girl #20, Kaori Minami, with a large knife
          impaled into her abdomen.

          A graphic reads: "GIRL #1: MIZUHO INADA DEAD. GIRL #20:

          INT.HOTEL (C-2 ON THE MAP) MORNING - FLASHBACK

          In what looks like a messy hotel lobby, the bloodied, naked
          corpses of Boy #13 Yuuichiro Takiguchi and Boy #18 Tadakatsu
          Hatagami lie on the floor. Mitsuko Souma, nearby,
          nonchalantly gets dressed as if nothing has happened, grabs
          her bag and sickle, and starts to leave.

          A graphic reads: "BOY #13: YUUICHIRO TAKIGUCHI DEAD. BOY

          Back to Utsumi and Shuya.

                              UTSUMI
                    ... And a message from Sugimura.
                    Mimura and the guys are in the
                    west, waiting to see you.

                              SHUYA
                    Mimura?

                              UTSUMI
                    Yeah.
                         (gets Shuya's map)
                    Here's your map. I marked it for
                    you.

          She sits next to Shuya and shows him the map.
 
                              UTSUMI
                    You're safe here. They're all my
                    friends. There's Haruka, Satomi,
                    Yuka, Chisato, and Yuko.

          Utsumi gets up.

                              UTSUMI
                    Nanahara, about that thing with Oki
                    ... Yuko saw it happen.

                    Of course it was!

                              UTSUMI
                    I'm sorry.

                              SHUYA
                    Let's all go join Kawada. He says
                    that he knows a way off this
                    island.

                              UTSUMI
                    Do you trust him?

                    He survived one of these games.

                    Right now, you rest up. Haruka and
                    Chisato are fixing lunch.

                              SHUYA
                    Did you bandage me, Utsumi?

                              UTSUMI
                    Yeah.
                         (laughs)
                    I never touched a guy before.
                         (laughs)
                    Do you like Noriko Nakagawa?

                              SHUYA
                    Why?

                              UTSUMI
                    I know all about you. Do you know
                    what that means?

                              SHUYA
                    What?

                              UTSUMI
                    Forget it ... I have to lock you
                    in. Some of them don't trust guys.
                    I'll bring lunch in a minute, okay?

          Utsumi leaves Shuya, goes out of the room, and locks the
          door.

          INT.LIGHTHOUSE KITCHEN DAY

          Girl #9 Yuko Sakaki is holding her weapon, a small vial of
          potassium cyanide. (It's marked "POISON - KCN".)

                                                          CUT TO:

          EXT.FOREST PATH DAY - FLASHBACK

          Yuko Sakaki watches Oki die. She is frightened out of her
          wits.

                                                          CUT TO:
 
          INT.LIGHTHOUSE KITCHEN DAY

          Yuko Sakaki, Girl #12 Haruka Tanizawa, Girl #17 Satomi Noda,
          and Girl #19 Chisato Matsui are in the kitchen when Utsumi
          runs in.

                              UTSUMI
                    Guess what? Nanahara's awake!

                              TANIZAWA
                    Really? Can he talk?

                              UTSUMI
                    Yeah. He seems hungry too.
                         (to Sakaki)
                    Don't worry, I locked his door.

                              SAKAKI
                    No, I'm sorry. I'm not worried
                    anymore.

                              UTSUMI
                    What happened with Oki was an
                    accident.

                              TANIZAWA
                    Of course. Shuya would never kill
                    anyone.

                              MATSUI
                    The spaghetti is almost done.

                              UTSUMI
                    Haruka, go get Yuka from watch. We
                    need to discuss something.

                              TANIZAWA
                    Roger!

          Tanizawa leaves to get Yuka Nakagawa. Utsumi goes over to
          the table where Noda is.

                              NODA
                    We're all dying tomorrow ...

                              UTSUMI
                    Don't start with that. We won't
                    give up until it's over, okay?
 
                              SAKAKI
                    I think that you'd better feed
                    Nanahara first, don't you? I'll
                    serve his.

                              UTSUMI
                    Thanks, Yuko.

          Sakaki gets a bowl of spaghetti, pours some broth on it,
          then puts the cyanide in it. Utsumi interrupts her.

                              UTSUMI
                    Are there still some painkillers
                    left? I need some for Nanahara.

                              MATSUI
                    They are in the cupboard.

                              SAKAKI
                    I'll get them.

          Girl #16 Yuka Nakagawa (no relations) runs down the stairs
          with Tanizawa. She is a happy-go-lucky girl.

                              YUKA NAKAGAWA
                    I hear that Nanahara is awake!
                    That's so great! You!

                              UTSUMI
                    What?

                              YUKA NAKAGAWA
                    Don't pretend, I know you're happy.
                    It smells great! Great job,
                    Chisato!
                         (grabs the bowl intended for
                         Nanahara)
                    Let me taste test!

                              SAKAKI
                    Uh-oh ...

                              YUKA NAKAGAWA
                         (takes a bite)
                    Super! Marry me, Chisato!

                              MATSUI
                    Come on, Yuka!

                              TANIZAWA
                    Calm down now! What did you want to
                    discuss, Yukie?
 
                              UTSUMI
                    Nanahara says that Kawada knows a
                    way off the island.

                              MATSUI
                    That Kawada?

                              NODA
                    Can we trust him?

                              UTSUMI
                    I can't tell yet. But once Nanahara
                    can walk, let's join Kawada and
                    Noriko ...

          At this point, the cyanide takes effect. Yuka Nakagawa puts
          her hands to her mouth, looks pained.

                              UTSUMI
                    What?

                              TANIZAWA
                    What?
                         (pause)
                    What's wrong?

          Yuka Nakagawa starts to pass out. She looks as if she's
          about to throw up any minute.

                              UTSUMI
                    Yuka!

          Chisato Matsui looks frightened of Yuka, and so does Yuko
          Sakaki. Yuka Nakagawa dies, slumps over into the spaghetti
          bowl.

                              TANIZAWA
                         (frightened)
                    She's dead! Why?

                              NODA
                    Not food poisoning!

                              MATSUI
                    I tasted it! I'm fine!

                              TANIZAWA
                    It's poison!

                              UTSUMI
                    Poison!

                              NODA
                    Aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!
 
          Noda panics, grabs Yuka Nakagawa's weapon (a 9mm machine
          gun) and aims it at the rest of the group.

                              NODA
                         (crazed)
                    Who? Who did it?!

                              TANIZAWA
                    Satomi, don't!

                              UTSUMI
                    It's just some mistake!

                              NODA
                    We're the only ones here!
                         (aims the gun at Matsui)
                    Chisato, you cooked it, right?

                              MATSUI
                    It wasn't me! Haruka cooked it too!

                              TANIZAWA
                    Me? Poison?

                              UTSUMI
                    It was nobody! Cut it out! Lower
                    that gun!

                              TANIZAWA
                         (to Noda)
                    You're suspicious yourself!

                              UTSUMI
                    Haruka!

                              TANIZAWA
                    The last two nights, you didn't
                    sleep at all. It just means that
                    you don't trust us ...

                              NODA
                    I forgot my sleeping pills.

                              TANIZAWA
                    Insomnia? At your age?

                              UTSUMI
                    Cut it out! Satomi, lower that gun!

                              MATSUI
                    Shut up, dammit!
                          (grabs the spaghetti pot and
                         slams it on the table)
                    Yukie, cut the leadership crap!

                              UTSUMI
                    Chisato ...

                              MATSUI
                    You screwed up the poisoning!

                              UTSUMI
                    How can you say that?

                              MATSUI
                    You schemed with Nanahara to escape
                    together!

                              NODA
                         (to Chisato)
                    Was it you?

          Matsui reaches for her weapon, a Walther PPK 7.65mm pistol.
          Noda shoots Matsui with the machine gun; Matsui dies.

                              UTSUMI
                    Chisato!

          Utsumi grabs Chisato's weapon and returns fire, wounding
          Noda. Upstairs, Nanahara hears the gunfire. Tanizawa reaches
          for her weapon, a 9mm pistol.

                              NODA
                    Goddammit!

          A crazed Noda opens fire on the other three, who cover.
          Utsumi and Tanizawa return fire. Noda covers.

                              NODA
                    Ouch! It hurts, you assholes! I'm
                    bleeding, dammit!

                              UTSUMI
                    Look who's talking!

                              TANIZAWA
                    You murderer!

                              NODA
                    Shut the hell up! You tried to
                    steal the gun so you're guilty!
                    Take that!
 
          Noda, still crazed, charges Utsumi and Tanizawa, who return
          fire. Noda jumps up onto the kitchen table and sprays Utsumi
          and Tanizawa with bullets. Tanizawa gets shot, dies. Noda
          and Utsumi are wounded. Noda aims the machine gun at Sakaki,
          who has been hiding under a table.

                              NODA
                    Not you, right? You don't belong to
                    their group ...

          Sakaki shakes her head no.

                              NODA
                    At least I'd thought I'd live until
                    tomorrow.

          With her last gasp of energy, Utsumi raises her arm and
          shoots Noda dead.

                              UTSUMI
                    What idiots ... we might all have
                    survived ... we're all so stupid
                    ... Stupid!

          Utsumi dies.

                              SAKAKI
                         (frightened)
                    It's not my fault ... It's not my
                    fault ... It's not my fault!

                              SHUYA (O.S.)
                    What happened? Utsumi!

          INT.LIGHTHOUSE DAY

          Shuya is banging on the door with a coat hanger.

                              SHUYA
                    What happened? Hey, Utsumi!

          Sakaki unlocks the door. She is crying.

                              SAKAKI
                    I'm sorry, Nanahara. I even forgot
                    that they are all my friends.

          Sakaki runs up the stairs while Shuya notices the carnage in
          the kitchen.

          INT.LIGHTHOUSE KITCHEN DAY

          Shuya runs down to Utsumi's corpse and cries.
 
                              SHUYA
                    Why? Utsumi? Why?

          EXT.LIGHTHOUSE OBSERVATION DECK DAY

          Shuya runs up to the observation deck of the lighthouse.
          Yuko Sakaki has committed suicide by jumping off the
          lighthouse's observation deck. Shuya sees her body on the
          rocks below.

                              SHUYA
                    How should I know what it means? I
                    don't know what any of it means!

          A graphic reads: "GIRL #16: YUKA NAKAGAWA DEAD. GIRL #19:
          CHISATO MATSUI DEAD. GIRL #12: HARUKA TANIZAWA DEAD. GIRL
          #17: SATOMI NODA DEAD. GIRL #2: YUKIE UTSUMI DEAD. GIRL #9:
          YUKO SAKAKI DEAD. 10 PLAYERS LEFT."

          EXT.TAKANO SHRINE (G-6 ON THE MAP) AFTERNOON

          Kawada brings some leaves to the temple. Noriko is napping.

          EXT.DREAM SEQUENCE RIVER BANK DAY

          Noriko is walking along a riverbank with Kitano. He looks
          sad.

                              KITANO
                    Are you okay?

                              NORIKO
                    What?

                              KITANO
                    If anybody sees us together,
                    they'll lock you right back in the
                    toilet.

                              NORIKO
                    It'll be someone else's turn.

                              KITANO
                    Are my classes boring?

                              NORIKO
                    Yes.
 
                              KITANO
                    How dare you! I go into class, and
                    you guys all look like a pile of
                    potatoes. Slapping them around
                    helped me tell them apart, I even
                    got to like them. But not anymore.
                    Now, you touch a student, you're
                    fired. You can't even lose your
                    temper when a student stabs you
                    with a knife!

                              NORIKO
                    I'll tell you just one thing.

                              KITANO
                    What?

                              NORIKO
                    The knife that stabbed you,
                    actually, I keep in my desk at
                    home. When I picked it up, I wasn't
                    sure, but now, for some reason, I
                    really treasure it. Our secret,
                    just between us.

                              KITANO
                    Listen, Noriko.

                              NORIKO
                    Yes?

                              KITANO
                    What do you think a grown-up like
                    me should say to a kid like you now
                    that you have told me this?

          INT.SCHOOL CLASSROOM

          Kitano is resting when he gets a phone call from his
          daughter, Shiori.

                              ANJO
                    Call for you.

          Kitano picks up the phone.

                              KITANO
                    Hello?

                              SHIORI KITANO
                         (on phone)
                    Hi, dad.
 
                              KITANO
                    Oh, Shiori?

                              SHIORI KITANO
                         (on phone)
                    Mom's feeling bad again.

                              KITANO
                    I'm on a business trip. I can't get
                    home until tomorrow.

                              SHIORI KITANO
                         (on phone)
                    Don't bother coming home. I'm
                    hanging up.

                              KITANO
                    Uh huh ...

                              SHIORI KITANO
                         (on phone)
                    Dad, don't breathe like that, your
                    bad breath stinks even over the
                    phone.

          Kitano hangs up the phone.

          EXT.TAKANO SHRINE AFTERNOON

          Noriko wakes up. Kawada is cooking the leaves to make tea.

                              KAWADA
                    Are you okay?

                              NORIKO
                    I had a dream ...

                              KAWADA
                    What dream?

                              NORIKO
                    I was alone with Kitano on an empty
                    riverbank.

                              KAWADA
                    It must have been scary.

                              NORIKO
                    But Kitano just seemed lonely.

                              KAWADA
                    Okay.
 
                              NORIKO
                    Before this, I always just thought
                    of myself as normal. I'd have a
                    normal marriage, age normally, just
                    like my Mom. But when this game
                    started, I realized it's just that
                    I was sheltered.

                              KAWADA
                    Some things are better not to know.
                         (looks up)
                    Rain is on its way.

                              NORIKO
                    I hope Nanahara can find us here.

          EXT.FOREST PATH AFTERNOON

          Shuya, in a weakened state, is walking along the forest
          paths, trying to get to the Takano Shrine to meet Noriko and
          Kawada. He is badly wounded and carrying the weapons the
          lighthouse girls had. He is using a walking stick. It is
          raining heavily.

          INT.ITALIAN RESTAURANT EVENING - FLASHBACK

          Shuya and his dad have gone out to eat, one day before Shuya
          starts seventh grade.

                              SHUYA'S FATHER
                    Wait!
                         (pause)
                    Another useless day. My phone never
                    rings. Even my cell phone is
                    useless. See, it's out of range.

                              WAITER
                    May I take your order?

                              SHUYA'S FATHER
                    Just wait.

                              WAITER
                    That's fine.

          The waiter exits.

                              SHUYA'S FATHER
                    I don't know how many resumes I
                    wrote. I'm just wiped.
                         (to the waitress)
                    Miss, please give me some water.
 
                              WAITRESS (O.S.)
                    Yes, in a minute.

                              SHUYA'S FATHER
                         (to Shuya)
                    Order what you want. You start
                    seventh grade tomorrow, go for it.

          Shuya laughs.

                              SHUYA'S FATHER
                    I say, "go for it," but I never
                    taught you anything.

          The waiter enters again.

                              WAITER
                    Your order?

                              SHUYA'S FATHER
                    I told you to wait!
                         (to Shuya)
                    Do you want to go somewhere else?

          EXT.FOREST PATH AFTERNOON

          Shuya falls. He remembers his father hanging himself and the
          "Go, Shuya! You can make it, Shuya!" toilet paper. He tries
          hard to prop himself up using the walking stick. The rain
          continues to fall.

          INT.DREAM SEQUENCE BASKETBALL COURT

          After the basketball game, Shuya sits on a folding chair on
          the court. A basketball bounces past him and up to the
          rafters, where Kuninobu catches it.

                              SHUYA
                    Nobu?!

                              KUNINOBU
                    Shuya? Look after Noriko, okay?
                    Promise you will protect her.

          Kuninobu waves goodbye.

          EXT.TAKANO SHRINE AFTERNOON

          The rain continues as Noriko suddenly jumps up.

                              KAWADA
                    Where are you going?
 
                              NORIKO
                    To meet Nanahara.

                              KAWADA
                    Hey! We're near a danger zone!

          Kawada chases after Noriko, who runs, and gets lost in the
          forest.

                              KAWADA
                         (shouts)
                    Where are you, Nakagawa?

          Noriko runs to a gazebo-like structure.

          EXT.GAZEBO AFTERNOON

          At the gazebo Noriko finds Mitsuko Souma taking shelter from
          the rain.

                              NORIKO
                    Mitsuko?

                              MITSUKO
                    What's up?

                              NORIKO
                    I'm looking for Nanahara.

                              MITSUKO
                    Did you get separated?

                              KAWADA (O.S.)
                    Where are you, Nakagawa?

                              MITSUKO
                    Who's that?

                              NORIKO
                    Kawada.

                              MITSUKO
                    Eh? Two princes protecting you.
                    You're a real princess.

          Mitsuko gets out a pistol and aims it at Noriko.

                              NORIKO
                         (shocked)
                    Mitsuko!

                              MITSUKO
                    Die, you ugly shrimpy nit!
 
          Before Mitsuko can fire the pistol, she sees something that
          startles her. Mitsuko run away. Noriko turns around to find
          Kitano standing there with an umbrella.

                              KITANO
                    Hey! You don't look so bad. Oh, you
                    got Nanahara with you.

                              NORIKO
                    Nanahara!

          Shuya enters the scene, looking like a train wreck. He
          falls, and Noriko runs to him.

                              NORIKO
                    Shuya! Shuya!

          Kitano offers them the umbrella.

                              KITANO
                    Don't catch cold.

          Kitano gives Noriko the umbrella and exits the scene.

                              SHUYA
                    You came to meet me?

          Noriko nods yes.

                              SHUYA
                    I brought weapons.

                              NORIKO
                    Weapons? Why?

                              SHUYA
                    I'm weak and useless. But I'll stay
                    by your side. I'll protect you.
                    That's why I brought weapons.

                              NORIKO
                    Oh, Shuya!

          Noriko embraces Shuya. Kawada watches.

          EXT.WAREHOUSE (G-3 ON THE MAP) AFTERNOON

          Sugimura follows his tracking device to the warehouse by
          bicycle. The device reveals that someone is inside. He limps
          inside. The rain continues.
 
          INT.WAREHOUSE AFTERNOON

          From behind some trash, Girl #8 Kayoko Kotohiki watches him.
          Sugimura finds a used water bottle, so he knows that someone
          has been here. Kotohiki climbs to a higher vantage point.
          She grabs her weapon (a Sig Sauer pistol), then accidentally
          knocks some aluminum cans over. She is frightened.

                              SUGIMURA
                    Kotohiki? Is that you?

          Kotohiki remains hidden and scared.

                              SUGIMURA
                    Kotohiki! Answer me!

          Kotohiki screams and shoots the full clip of the pistol into
          Sugimura. He falls into a puddle (the roof is leaky).

                              SUGIMURA
                    Hurry, run!

                              KOTOHIKI
                    What?

                              SUGIMURA
                    Someone will come, drawn to the
                    gunshots. Run!

                              KOTOHIKI
                    Why, Sugimura, why?

                              SUGIMURA
                    You're so cute!

                              KOTOHIKI
                    What are you talking about? What is
                    this?

                              SUGIMURA
                    I wanted to see you, to save you,
                    actually.

                              KOTOHIKI
                    Don't tell me ...

                              SUGIMURA
                    I have been in love with you,
                    Kotohiki, for a long, long time.

          Sugimura dies. Kotohiki is in shock. She starts crying and
          walks over to his body.
 
                              KOTOHIKI
                         (sobbing)
                    But you never even talked to me!
                    How could I have known? You never
                    said a thing! What am I supposed to
                    do now?

                              MITSUKO
                         (emerging from the shadows)
                    Die!

          Mitsuko shoots Kotohiki through the chest with the pistol
          she got from Shimizu. Kotohiki dies.

          A graphic reads: "BOY #11: HIROKI SUGIMURA DEAD. GIRL #8:
          KAYOKO KOTOHIKI DEAD. 8 PLAYERS LEFT."

          INT.SOUMA LIVING ROOM - FIVE YEARS AGO - FLASHBACK

          Ten-year-old Mitsuko comes home from school to her
          lower-class house find her mother having marital relations
          with a strange man.

                              MITSUKO
                    Hi, Mom.
                         (notices the stranger)
                    That's not Dad!

          Mitsuko's mother looks drunk or drugged.

                    Go upstairs, Mitsuko.

          Mitsuko obeys.

          INT.MITSUKO'S BEDROOM - FIVE YEARS AGO - FLASHBACK

          Mitsuko is doing her homework, distracted by the commotion
          below.

          Suddenly, the stranger knocks on the door. Mitsuko opens it.

                              STRANGER
                    I'm a friend of your mother's.
                         (pause)
                    She told me your name is Mitsuko,
                    right?

          Mitsuko nods. The stranger gets out a fashion doll.
 
                              STRANGER
                    I got you a doll. Her name is
                    Mitsuko, too.

          Mitsuko gasps.

          The stranger removes the clothes from the doll.

                              STRANGER
                    See? The doll has no clothes. Now,
                    it's time for the real Mitsuko to
                    undress ...

          Mitsuko is in shock. She pushes the stranger through the
          doorway to her room. He slips on the carpeting and falls
          backward down the stairs, dying after receiving a head wound
          at the bottom. Mitsuko looks down at him, making sure that
          he is dead.

          INT.SOUMA LIVING ROOM - FIVE YEARS AGO - FLASHBACK

          Mitsuko runs downstairs to her mother.

                              MITSUKO
                    Mom, what was that all about?

                              MITSUKO'S MOTHER
                    I needed money for drugs, so I
                    pimped. That guy paid me a lot of
                    money to have sex with both of us.

                              MITSUKO
                         (pointing out the stranger)
                    Well, he won't bother us anymore.

          INT.WAREHOUSE AFTERNOON

          Back to the scene before the flashback. Mitsuko picks up
          Kotohiki's Sig Sauer pistol, looks at it, throws it away.

                              MITSUKO
                    Nobody will rescue you. That's just
                    life ...

          Suddenly, someone shoots an automatic weapon at Mitsuko. She
          falls. Cut to Kiriyama, the shooter, who walks down to
          Mitsuko (who is playing possum) and takes her pistol. As he
          turns to leave, Mitsuko tasers Kiriyama in the groin area.
          Mitsuko swings her sickle at Kiriyama a few times,
          screaming. He parries her blows.

                              MITSUKO
                    Yaaaaah! Yaaaaah! Die!
 
          She gets off what would be a lethal blow, but Kiriyama is
          wearing the bulletproof vest, which provides some protection
          against the sickle.

          He pushes the sickle away. She tries tasering him again. He
          blocks. He kicks her away to get separation, then pulls out
          the pistol that Mitsuko had and shoots her. She falls and
          gets up again. He shoots her again. She gets up again to
          swing the sickle at him.

                              MITSUKO
                    Yaaaaaaah!

          He shoots her again with the pistol. She falls again, for
          the last time.

                              MITSUKO
                    I just didn't want to be a loser
                    anymore.

          Mitsuko Souma dies. A graphic reads: "GIRL #11: MITSUKO
          SOUMA DEAD. 7 PLAYERS LEFT."

          Kiriyama leaves.

                    Let's go west. We can still evade
                    the new danger zones. I've got to
                    see Mimura.

                              KAWADA
                    All right.

          They leave for the west.
 
          INT.MIMURA'S LAIR EVENING

          Mimura has been working on a little present for the Battle
          Royale computer. Seto and Iijima have been following the
          recipes in the anarchist magazine.

                              MIMURA
                         (relieved)
                    I did it! I got in!

          EXT.MIMURA'S LAIR EVENING

          Mimura, Seto, and Iijima are loading the bombs onto the
          truck. Mimura sets the bomb trigger.

                              MIMURA
                    In fifteen minutes, their system
                    will be back up. We blow up the
                    school and the game's over!

                              IIJIMA
                    I just saw someone over there ...

                              MIMURA
                    Nanahara?

                              SETO
                    Maybe Sugimura told him about us.

          Seto runs out to the noise.

                              SETO
                    Hey, Nanahara! Over here, quickly!

          An automatic weapon fires at Seto, killing him.

                              MIMURA
                    Yutaka!

          The bullets continue. Mimura and Iijima hide behind the
          truck.
 
                              MIMURA
                    Shit! Who is that?

          Kiriyama comes out of the bushes.

                              MIMURA
                    It's him! The transfer student!

          Mimura pulls out his Baretta pistol and fires at Kiriyama.
          Kiriyama returns fire with the Uzi.

                              MIMURA
                    I can't hit him!

                              IIJIMA
                    Aim calm!

          Mimura fires again at Kiriyama.

                              MIMURA
                    Missed again!

                              IIJIMA
                    Shut up.

          Kiriyama returns fire. Mimura tries to shoot again but he is
          out of bullets.

                              MIMURA
                    No good! Retreat!

          Kiriyama shoots Iijima as he retreats.

                              MIMURA
                    Iijima! Iijima!

                              IIJIMA
                         (laughs)
                    When we escape, it will be
                    together!

          Iijima dies.

                              MIMURA
                    Hey! Goddammit!

          Mimura runs back to the truck where the bombs are. Kiriyama
          shoots him, but before he dies, he sets off the bombs using
          the fighting stick that was Iijima's assigned weapon. This
          causes a big explosion that kills Mimura and blinds
          Kiriyama.

          A graphic reads: "BOY #12: YUTAKA SETO DEAD. BOY #2: KEITA
          IIJIMA DEAD. BOY #19: SHINJI MIMURA DEAD. 4 PLAYERS LEFT."
 
          Kawada, Noriko, and Shuya arrive at the scene. There are
          flames from the explosion all over the place. Kawada spots
          Kiriyama in the distance.

                              KAWADA
                    That's him. Stay here.

          Kawada goes after Kiriyama. Kawada cocks his shotgun,
          alerting Kiriyama to his presence. Kiriyama shoots at
          Kawada, hitting him a couple of times, in the leg, but
          Kiriyama can't get off a good shot as he is blind, and
          Kawada is still alive. Kawada shoots at Kiriyama a couple of
          times, once in the leg, then hits Kiriyama in the collar,
          which explodes, decapitating Kiriyama. Shuya and Noriko
          watch this battle, and when Kiriyama dies, they embrace.

          A graphic reads: "BOY #6: KAZUO KIRIYAMA DEAD. 3 PLAYERS

          Kawada, Noriko, and Shuya come to the beach. Kawada is
          limping.

                              SHUYA
                         (to Kawada)
                    Are you hurt?

                              KAWADA
                    No big deal. What matters is we're
                    all that's left now.

                              SHUYA
                    Yeah.

                              KAWADA
                    What will you do after this?

                              SHUYA
                    I don't know. I've never really
                    trusted grown-ups. My mom and dad
                    ran off or died because they felt
                    like it.

          INT.SCHOOL PRE-DAWN

                    I don't know how, until I become a
                    real adult.

                              KAWADA
                    You guys never will.

                              SHUYA
                    Why not?

                              KAWADA
                    I told you, didn't I, not to trust
                    anyone. Well, you both trusted me
                    too much.
                         (Pulls a pistol and aims it at
                         Shuya and Noriko)
                    You lose!

                              SHUYA
                    Cut the sick joke!

                              KAWADA
                    This was my way off the island.
                    Sorry, but I used you guys to save
                    myself.

                              NORIKO
                    Well, I don't believe it! What
                    about Keiko?

                              KAWADA
                    There's no Keiko. She was just a
                    story to lure you in.

                              SHUYA
                    But why us?

                              KAWADA
                    You were perfect, just gullible
                    enough.

          Shuya reaches for the automatic weapon behind him.

                              KAWADA
                    Hey, Nanahara. Can you really kill
                    me with that gun?

          Shuya and Noriko look worried.
 
                              KAWADA
                    Game's over. For real!

          Shuya moves to protect Noriko. Kawada lowers his weapon and
          fires two bullets.

                              RADIO HOST
                         (on radio)
                    Swing your arms. 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
 
          Kitano continues to stretch.

                              RADIO HOST
                         (on radio)
                    Stand with legs apart and exercise
                    your chest.

          Kawada appears, walking towards Kitano. He looks wounded.
          Kitano notices him, invites him inside.

          INT.SCHOOL CLASSROOM

          Kitano and Kawada are sitting.

                              KITANO
                    Nice job. I'm glad you and Kiriyama
                    were in the mix.

                              KAWADA
                    Are you not going home?

                              KITANO
                    There's no rush. Could you clarify
                    one thing for me?

          Kitano gets the remote control and detonates Kawada's
          collar. The collar blinks for a little while, then fizzes
          out.

                              KITANO
                    You can deactivate it, right?

                              KAWADA
                    What are you ...

                              KITANO
                    You cracked the system and swiped
                    that data, right? Are you avenging
                    Keiko?

          Kawada doesn't answer.

                              KITANO
                    That's fine. That's why you played
                    the game, right?
                         (pulls out a pistol)
                    But cheating is no good.

          Suddenly, the door to the room opens. Shuya and Noriko walk
          in, wounded, and armed to the teeth.
 
                              KITANO
                         (to Shuya and Noriko)
                    Hey! Was it fun surviving together,
                    love birds?

          Noriko aims a pistol at Kitano.

                              KITANO
                    I've had it. The kids make fun of
                    me at school, my own kid hates me.
                    I might as well take you with me.

          He pulls a black cloth cover, revealing his painting of the
          class. Noriko in the middle of the painting looks angelic.
          The rest of the class are bloodied, maimed, beaten, shot,
          stabbed, and decapitated.

                              KITANO
                    And the only one worth dying with
                    would be you, Noriko. If I had to
                    choose one of you, well, then it
                    would have to be you, Noriko.

          Noriko starts to cry. Shuya and Noriko aim guns at Kitano.

                              KITANO
                    What? Go ahead, shoot.

          Shuya and Noriko are still frightened of Kitano.

                              KITANO
                    Noriko, you can do it. Noriko, you
                    can do it!

          Shuya remembers his dad's final words: "Go, Shuya! You can
          make it, Shuya!"

                              KITANO
                    What's up? Shoot me or I'll shoot
                    you!

          Kitano raises his weapon. Shuya shoots Kitano with an
          automatic weapon.

                              KITANO
                    Ouch! That hurt, dammit!

          Kitano falls. Shuya fires another burst into Kitano, who
          shoots Shuya and Noriko with his weapon, a water pistol.

                              SHUYA
                    I made a promise to protect Noriko.
 
                              KAWADA
                    I know it. I know.

          Kawada, Shuya, and Noriko pull their collars off and throw
          them on the floor.

          The cell phone rings. Kitano gets up and answers it.

                              KITANO
                         (into phone)
                    Hello? Shiori? Listen, I won't be
                    coming home again. And listen, if
                    you hate someone you take the
                    consequences. Irresponsible? Who
                    the hell asked you?

          Kitano throws the cell phone onto the floor then shoots it
          with a pistol that he had in his back pocket. He finds the
          bag of cookies that Noriko had and grabs a cookie.

                              KITANO
                    The last one.
                         (eats the cookie)
                    The cookies sure were good ...

          Kitano dies.

          INT.BOAT MORNING

          Shuya, Noriko, and Kawada have fled the island on a boat.
          Kawada is steering.

                              NORIKO
                         (looking back at the island)
                    It's beautiful, even if it's where
                    everyone died.

                              SHUYA
                         (to Kawada)
                    You can even steer a ship?

                              KAWADA
                    Sure, my dad is a fisherman. Just
                    keep going straight and you have to
                    hit land. Give it a try?

          Shuya takes the wheel. Kawada goes out on deck and lies
          down.
 
                              KAWADA
                    We part soon. I doubt we'll see
                    each other again.

                              SHUYA
                    Why not?

                              KAWADA
                    It's for the best. It was only
                    three days, but there are a lot of
                    memories that I'd rather forget.

          Noriko goes out to Kawada.

                              NORIKO
                    Kawada?

                              KAWADA
                    Yeah?

                              NORIKO
                    Thank you so much.

          Pause.

                              KAWADA
                    Nanahara!

                              SHUYA
                    Yeah?

                              KAWADA
                    It's going to be tough going.

                              SHUYA
                    Yeah, I know.

          Shuya goes out to Kawada, who is starting to succumb to the
          injuries he received in the fight with Kiriyama.

                              KAWADA
                    I'm sleepy all of a sudden. It's
                    time for a nap. In meeting you
                    guys, I finally solved the riddle
                    of Keiko's smile.

                              NORIKO
                    The answer?

                              KAWADA
                    Her parting words. Thank you ...
                    and then ...
 
                              SHUYA
                    And then?

          Kawada is losing consciousness.

                              SHUYA
                    Kawada?

                              NORIKO
                    Kawada?

                              KAWADA
                    And then ... I'm glad I found true
                    friends.

          Kawada dies.

          A graphic comes up of a wanted poster with Shuya's and
          Noriko's pictures on it. It reads: "BOY #15: SHUYA NANAHARA
          & GIRL #15: NORIKO NAKAGAWA - WANTED FOR MURDER AND
          ACCESSORY."

          EXT.OUTSIDE CONVENIENCE STORE NIGHT

          Noriko, wearing a baseball cap for a disguise, comes up to
          Shuya, who is also looking like he's not trying to attract
          attention on purpose. Noriko comes up and shows him the
          knife that she has retrieved from her desk: the knife that
          Kuninobu stabbed Kitano with two years earlier.

                              SHUYA (V.O.)
                    Noriko slipped home last night to
                    bid her sleeping parents farewell.
                    She took the knife that Nobu used
                    to stab Kitano from her desk. Each
                    of us has a weapon now. Even if the
                    time comes to use them again, it
                    will never be an easy choice. But
                    we have no choice but to keep
                    moving forward.

                              SHUYA
                    Let's run, Noriko.

                              NORIKO
                    Yes.

                              SHUYA (V.O.)
                    No matter how far, run for all you
                    are worth ... RUN!!!!

          The class photo is displayed over the closing credits.
