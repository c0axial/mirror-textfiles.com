      How to get a free haircut by Ali.

One dude wrote a text on getting a free haircut, which was 
pretty lame, so here's my take on getting a freebie in barbershop:

- find some kiddo playing on the street who doesn't know you (hardest thing to do), 
- ask him if he wants a free haircut,
- go to a barbershop with that kiddo, and get your hair done, 
- then, tell the barber to cut "your son's/little brother's" hair, while
you quickly go out to buy some newspaper/gum/ etc.
- leave with a free haircut.
