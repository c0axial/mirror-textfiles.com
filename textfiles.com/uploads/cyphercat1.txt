TABLE OF CONTENTS

cyphercat here with the first volume of
cbbso (or "corn on the cob" for short).

all you cypherpunx out there who are 
edging to taste a bit of what makes 
cyphercat tick are in for a treat.

william gibson was a visionary. he defined
the cyberspace as we know it, and as it
actually is. for us who live in cyberspace,
it is as close to the real thing as you
can get.

but, i'm here to lend you a hand toward
your beloved cypherpunk utopia, kittens.

((Renoise))
Renoise is a music making program that 
you should spend a lot of time playing
around in.  First of all, every good
hacker should be a good musician because
hacking is a musical art. You need a 
rhythm and a sound when you hack. Renoise
is the program that you want to use to
instill this notion in yourself.
You don't need to hack Renoise, you just
need to get used to the samples, the
VSTs, and the other stuff that comes
with it.
Cyberpunk music has not been defined
as a genre (yet), but bare with me 
kittlings, because cyphercat listens
only to cyberpunk music.  all the time.
in the future, everyone is listening to
either Proswell, Machine Drum, or Ilkae.
They are the TRINITY OF CYBERPUNK MUSIC
and there is a satellite dedicated to 
playing their music AS THEY WRITE IT
24 hours a day. kind of like sirius 
except CYPHERPUNX sattelite doesn't
suck.
Get a hold of renoise, plug that in your
windows browser, and start making some
cyber punk music because you just might 
make it into the datastream in the 
space time that I inhabit.
Make lots of hacking music for the 
missions we all go on.

((Hack/Phreak))
Hack/Phreak will never die. Boxes come
and go, and cyphercat lives forever.
you see kittlings, the cyphercat is
playing out in cyberspace 24-7 in 
H/P mode.
Find a system and exploit it.
you want some homework?
tyler durden says:
"find a building, a computer, a garage,
anything. just find something that you
aren't supposed to access and access it.
figuring out how to access it is your 
homework and it's pass fail because the
only grade you get is A for accessing.
and nobody fails because everyone can
find their first hack. it's like 
losing your virginity."

((Girls))
ok kittens. take it from cyphercat, you
can put girls on the backburner.
they are cute and sweet and all that,
but porno and girls take away from your
hacking experience, and you really
need to be investing your time in 
hacking and lockpicking and whatnot.
When it comes to girls, i simply remind
myself that i will get laid when i get
laid and it probably will not be today
or tomorrow or tomorrow afternoon.
you see, your body wants to plan and
you just want to fuck, so your body can't
see outside of this wall of fuck 
you've built.
you have to bypass girls for a while.
it's like a smooth hack. trust me, when
you sit there hacking and going around
town and phreaking your body is going
to be good enough to nab any chick you
want when you get there.
just keep hacking and phreaking.
read, obsess over systems.
learn.

cyphercat out.
