THIS TIME:
	HOW TO CALL PROJECT MF
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
INTRO:
	Well, first Textfile 
that I have written, so please
hang on and give me feedback on
how I am doing! Contact info on
the bottom.

	Project MF is a PBX you
can call to use a blue box. Why
yes, you can still use a blue
box on this guy's PBX that 
allows the use of those tones!
This file will help you with
using Project MF!
-------------------------------

FIRST:
	First off, you'll need
a blue box. You can build one 
of these, or I actually made a 
blue box with Python 2.7, so
if you would like one, install
Python 2.7 and I'll give you
the folder containing the 
source code, MF tones that I
created, and instructions on
how to use it. Once you have
a blue box, you are good to
go to the next step!
-------------------------------

SECOND:
	You'll need to call 
the PBX (obviously)! The PSTN
number is 1(630)485-2995 and
it goes to a voice prompt. 
Just hit 0 on your phone, and
it will take you to a trunk
where you can use the blue 
box.
-------------------------------

THIRD:
	If you don't know how
to use a blue box, this will 
help you. First, you'll need 
to put a 2600Hz tone through
the mic to "hang up" the 
phone. From there, you will
press the key press button
(KP) before you dial a number.
Then, dial a number using the
keypad on the blue box, then 
press start (ST) to begin the
call. For Project MF, there is
a set of numbers that you can
call inside his PBX that will
play recordings. Some of them
are really cool, and some are
funny! A chart below will be 
provided for some of the
numbers that I like to dial
to listen to. Go to the site
projectmf.org for more numbers
you can put in.
-------------------------------

CHART:

KP-101-ST = "We're sorry!"
KP-102-ST = Monkeys howeling
KP-104-ST = "Moron!"
KP-105-ST = "MOOOOO!"
KP-108-ST = "I grew bored"
KP-600-ST = Echo test
KP-2111-ST = conference call
KP-xxx-xxx-xxxx-ST = outdial
