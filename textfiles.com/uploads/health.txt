  0) First Words
 ----------------
  Hello people, this here is a paper which gives you some health tips and
  it mentions also some facts about the risks of products which most
  people are using on daily basis. Most people have no idea what products
  they use and what these products can cause - it is very serious. I put
  lots of different issues together that people can become an overview of
  many dangers and risks to what they and their family maybe are affected
  daily without knowing it. If you are pregnant these toxins and poisons
  can and will also reach your unborn baby and will have effects on it.
  Also, many people are in contact with chemicals ( cleaning products )
  at work too like nurses - so the dangers are not only at home. Many of
  the intoxication and health risks can also happen to cats, dogs and so
  on.

  We begin with normal products for body and hair. Then we look at the
  products you use for your average household and then for alternative
  basic ways which can save energy, money and trash. After this we take a
  look at the radiation of mobile and cordless phones. And at least we
  handle the subject "dry air and house dust" which can cause asthma, the
  intoxication due to plastics (BPA) and aspartame / synthetical sugar. To
  every subject there are always solutions included of course - there is a
  way out of the fog.


  1) Natural Products
 ---------------------
  Most people today are using all kinds of chemical products for their
  body, hair, teeth, clothes, dishes, cleaning and more. When i went into
  a well known chemist which name stands for "good quality" in the public
  and sells wellness products for body and hair and asked "if they have
  100% natural products" then they simply said "No.". But isn't my body
  and hair made 100% natural? Of course it is - so why poison it with
  chemicals? This makes no sense at all. We don't feed a tree with poison
  - we give him pure clean fine 100% natural water. And the same we should
  do to ourself and our family - using 100% natural products.

  Sometimes 100% natural products cost a bit more of money but sometimes
  you can get them also very cheap and some products you can also make
  by yourself. But believe me even if they cost a bit more: they are their
  money worth. These chemical products may be cheap but they poison you
  and your loved ones - and that is the point. Before you use a product
  make a research on every ingredient which is in the product.
  

  1.1) Body & Hair
 ------------------
  Normal products even if they have a label "with natural oil" or "orange"
  include many other chemicals. It is normally so that chemicals are the
  main ingredients and that the natural ingredients are just a few percent
  of these products. You might think they are natural because of their
  label but if you read "the ingredients" on the back of the product you
  will see the true reality: chemicals. So now we take a look on what we
  can use which is 100% pure nature with pure nature ingredients for our
  body and hair.

  Your skin will absorb the chemicals and also all the perfumes and like
  said: they make your skin dry and then comes the industry again to sell
  you the next chemical products: to make your skin wet again: cream or
  something, also filled with chemicals. And with this you poison yourself
  even more - a circle of poisoning. So 100% natural products are a good
  blessing for yourself.

  So what can we use instead of chemical products for body and hair? See
  the next sections which follows.


  1.1.1) hemp and oil products
 ------------------------------
  What would be the world without the good old hemp? Normal hemp from the
  plant includes THC which can make people high. But the industry hemp
  does not include THC so it can be used for many other things too - in
  this case for body and hair lotion. Hemp lotions include lots of good
  vegetable fat from this plant which are good for your skin and gives
  your skin humidity and suppleness - they also clean the skin of course
  and will give your hair a good brilliance and supplenes too.

  Same with oil products, they include oils and fat like hemp which are
  the better solution for hair and skin. One oil product is avocado oil
  lotion for hair or skin. Some products also mix different kinds of
  plants or oils - for example a hemp/avocado lotion. Here is your point
  for what you want.

  Make sure that you always check ALL ingredients of the product which you
  wanna buy. Some products claim to be natural and are labeled as natural
  but include some chemical mixtures too but this is not mentioned on the
  front of the product of course - only on the back with special chemical
  names. So before you buy or use a product put all ingredients from the
  back of the product into a searchengine - and research them all to be
  save - with this you will not waste your money.

  Where do you find some good products? Well, just use a searchengine and
  type stuff like:

   - "100% nature products"
   - "100% nature hemp lotion"
   - "100% hemp oil avocado"
   - "100% natural lotion chemical free"

  .. and so on. This should help you out i think. Not every shop sells
  worldwide and some shops only sell their stuff to their country where
  they are - so i'll not include shops here, it would be too much, sorry.


  1.1.2) 100% pure soap
 -----------------------
  Pure soap is also a very good solution for a good cleaning and care for
  your (sensitive) skin but also for your hair too. 100% pure soap is made
  from plants only and here again the fat of the plants is also used. The
  perfume comes also only from other plants. But they also include some
  oil from other plants for example which makes the soap a bit oily of
  course. One ingredient as a perfume for example could be rose.
  
  Many other soaps also include chemicals or perfume which is not made by
  plants only. People with sensitive skin should not have problems with
  these soaps. They also give your hair a good brilliance and your skin a
  good cream like suppleness. To use and buy these products is a very good
  decision. But again: make sure you know all ingredients of the soap
  before you buy it - use a searchengine again and educate yourself.

  Again, i will not mention shops because this would be too much for this
  paper, do your own research and use a searchengine to find these
  products with a syntax like:

   - "100% pure soap"
   - "100% BIO soap"
   - "100% natural soap"
   - "natural soap chemical free"

  .. and so on.

  [ Ok, in section "8) Resources" i listed 2 good companies which sell
  the best 100% natural products you can get. ]


  1.1.3) selfmade products
 --------------------------
  This here is just a short section to mention some altenative ways for
  body and hair care. For your hair for example you could use an egg to
  wash it because it includes lots of good ingredients for your hair, for
  example protein - you could also mix the egg with milk, water or a bit
  of oil (sunflower oil).

  If you are not that dirty you can also wash yourself only with water.
  Simply said. Warm water is able to wash away all kinds of dirt and also
  sweat without leaving a trace. Also if you have very short hair, really,
  normal warm water is doing a very good fine job. There is much more to
  say and write about this topic, i just wanted to mention it only as a
  very little hint - there was a time before the industry i mean, a time
  where people had no chemicals, only nature products - if you wanna know
  more about that then: make a research.
  

  1.1.4) dangers of chemical body and hair products
 ---------------------------------------------------
  Chemical products can make your skin dry and can cause rash. A person i
  know had rash from a body product which is normally labeled with "for
  very sensitive skin" like for babies. This person never had rash from
  any product before. You can also INHALE the chemicals when you use them
  with hot/warm water while you are in your bath. I don't think that this
  is very healthy if this happens - think about it.
  
  I mean think about that many people using these products daily - who
  knows what can happen when people use them over a long distance of time?
  The chemical industry is not that old. It is a continues poisoning of
  the body, period. I mean it is a shame that the industry is selling such
  a crap to the people.

  Some chemical / toxic ingredients in such products can cause:

   - nervous system problems
   - embryo defects
   - irritation
   - redness
   - restlessness
   - liver cancer
   - allergies
   - kidney damage
   more ..


  1.1.5) ingredients of chemical body & hair products
 -----------------------------------------------------
  Here is a little list with some chemical ingredients:

   - perfume
   - sodium laureth sulfate
   - diethanolamine ( DEA )
   - triethonalamine ( TEA )
   - monoethanolamides ( MEA )
   - DMDM hydantoin
   - diazolidinyl urea
   - imidazolidinyl urea
   - quaternium-15
   - bronopol
   - amodimethicone
   - FD&C color pigments
   - cocamidopropyl betaine
   more ..

  Some of these toxic ingredients for example are for the lather of the
  shampoo. ( DEA & TEA ) To know more about every chemical and toxic
  ingredient in detail just put their names into a searchengine and you
  will find out for what they are used in the shampoo and so on and what
  they can cause.


  1.2) Teeth
 ------------
  Many of the products you use for your teeth include also many chemicals
  and toxins. But in this case you do not put them on your skin, in this
  case you put them inside of your mouth and your mouth will absorb a bit
  of them with the help of your saliva. One of these toxins is called
  fluoride.

  Once i saw, in little letters written, on a tooth paste tube a warning
  which said simply: "Do not give this product to children under 6 years."
  - so it is not healthy for children under 6 years. One time in a report
  they said something like this: "If your children swallows some of the
  toothpaste as big as they use it for their toothbrush then please send
  your children to the hospital for the detoxication!" - got that ?! It
  is _toxic_!


  1.2.1) 100% bio tooth paste
 -----------------------------
  To avoid the poisoning of yourself and your family it is recommended to
  use 100% bio toothpaste. This type of toothpaste does not include any
  kind of chemicals and no fluoride too.

  With such products there is no health problem when you or your kids
  swallow something of the toothpaste and what your mouth absorbs with the
  help of saliva - so there is no intoxication possible.

  Some of the ingredients of bio toothpaste can be: water, wheat, rye, oat
  , salt, peppermint oil, leaven and so on.

  You see, you could also make it for yourself with these ingredients
  above. Again, to find some of these products just get a searchengine and
  type in:

   - "100% bio toothpaste"
   - "bio toothpaste"
   - "100% natural toothpaste"
   - "toothpaste chemical free"

  .. and so on.


  1.2.2) dangers of fluoride
 ----------------------------
  Some time ago fluoride was used as a rat poison and poison for insects
  for example cockroaches - to kill and destroy them - yeah that is right.
  It was also used in sarin nerve gas. Fluoride was produced for the top
  secret "manhatten project" - by the US military - the first atomic bomb.

  Fluoride was and is also used as a key component in psychiatric drugs
  and was added to the drinking water for prisoners to keep them quiet
  during world war II in nazi prison camps and in soviet gulags in
  siberia. Fluoride is not only in your toothpaste - it is also already
  (or can be included) in salt and water.

  Fluoride can cause:

   - salivation
   - nausea
   - vomiting
   - pain
   - diarrhea
   - paralysis
   - muscular weakness
   - clonic convulsions
   - cardiac failure
   - dental deformity
   - arthritis
   - allergic reactions
   - cancer
   - death


  1.2.3) ingredients of chemical tooth paste products
 -----------------------------------------------------
  Here are some ingredients in chemical toothpaste:

   - sodium fluoride
   - sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS)
   - sodium laureth sulphate (SLES)
   - ammonium lauryl sulphate (ALS)
   - ammonium laureth sulphate (ALES)
   - triclosan
   - FD&C Blue Dye 1 and 2
   - hydrated silica
   more ..


  1.3) Clothes, Dishes & Cleaning
 ---------------------------------
  Many other cleaning agents can and do include chemicals. For example the
  cleaning agent for your clothes. The chemicals in it make your clothes
  harsh or hard but again you can use a second chemical product to make
  them soft again: the conditioner. Think about all the chemical perfumes
  which are in the clothes after washing - that is why they smell so fine
  after the washing - if you sweat after sport or something these perfumes
  or dry rests of the cleaning product could solve from the clothes and
  can be absorbed by the skin and can cause an allergic reaction due to
  the chemicals.

  The cleaning agent for your dishes also in most cases is a pure chemical
  product. Think about this: you use this cleaning agent in water and you
  put all your dishes into this chemical water. Your hands, if you do not
  wear cleaning gloves, are always in contact with these chemicals and
  your skin of your hands can and will absorb them. And think about the
  case when the water is hot and the chemicals are in the water already
  and the water gives free water steam with these chemicals included and
  you inhale them - this is toxic of course.

  Also, after you wash your dishes with this chemical water and you do not
  wash the dishes again with clean water to wash away the chemicals which
  are now on them due to the cleaning agent water - the chemical water can
  dry on them if you do not dry the dishes soon after - and if that is the
  case then they can be solved again if you eat a hot soup next time or
  drink a hot tea out of them.

  It is the same with normal cleaning products which you use for your
  windows, your house in general, your car, your furniture and so on. In
  most cases probably most people do not wear any sort of cleaning solves
  to protect them from the chemicals in the chemical water which they use
  for their cleaning. Here also the steam can be a health risk.

  All these chemical products are poisoning the earth by the way too. But
  there is a 100% natural solution from india for everything you can clean
  and wash: the washing nut aka. "Sapindus Mukorossi". ( details: 1.3.1 )
  
  
  1.3.1) the washing nut from india
 -----------------------------------
  Well, the washing nut from india is a fine nature product. This washing
  nut includes ingredients which are like soap and have the lather effect
  of soap. The smelling from it is very nutty and earthy - it smells fine.

  You can buy the pure washing nuts but you can also buy them milled as a
  powder. If you buy the pure washing nuts you have to make powder out of
  them. Then you can make a cleaning product with the help of water: you
  put some powder in warm water and then you wait a while until the powder
  has given away all its active agents. Then you can filter out the powder
  with a fine sieve and after this you can use this washing nut water for
  whatever you have to wash or to clean - it is very simple.

  The effect of the washing nut is very good but not that strong as some
  harsh chemical products - that is for sure.


  1.3.1.1) clothes
 ------------------
  When you use the washing nut for your clothes you will not need a
  conditioner anylonger because the washing nut makes your clothes fine
  and soft like silk. T-shirts made of cotton will become very fine and
  easy and feeling much more comfortable to wear.

  Stains are also no problem here - if the stains are strong you can just
  use more hotter water with the washing nut or/and use more washing nut
  powder. Because the washing nut includes no chemicals and is no risk to
  your health you can easy wash your clothes by hand too.


  1.3.1.2) dishes
 -----------------
  The washing nut will also make a fine job for washing your dishes. The
  more washing nut powder you use the stronger is the cleaning effect of
  it. Your dishes will be shiny and clean. Fat, oil, butter, milk and so
  on are no problem for the washing nut. And also your hands have no
  contact to any sort of chemicals like said. Here you can also make a
  cleaning agent for your dishes out of warm water and washing nut powder
  - you can fill it in a bottle and then you can use it for a few weeks.


  1.3.1.3) cleaning
 -------------------
  The pure and dry washing nut powder you can use also as abrasive for
  your kitchen, ground, table, stove and so on. Just make a bit powder on
  the dirt or the stain and then use a wet clout to make it clean - it has
  a great effect. Here also you can make yourself a cleaning agent or just
  put some of the powder in warm or hot water, mix it, wait a while and
  then use it. Such a mixture is perfect for your windows for example and
  many other things which you have to clean.


  1.3.2) dangers of chemical cleaning products
 ----------------------------------------------
  Chemical cleaning products have the following health risks:

   - they can be inhaled which can cause tissue damage
   - they can be inhaled when given to hot water
   - the skin of the body can absorb them
   - the skin of the hands can absorb them
   - they can cause an allergic reaction with your skin
   - they poison the earth / nature
   - you could eat them dry on your dishes after washing
   - they could react with your skin dry on your clothes
   - they can cause asthma
   - they can cause allergies
   - cancer, birth defects, miscarriage .. 


  1.3.3) ingredients of chemical cleaning products
 --------------------------------------------------
  Some ingredients you should avoid:

   - butyl cellosolve
   - chlorine
   - ethylene glycol
   - ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA )
   - formaldehyde
   - hydrochloric acid
   - nonylphenol ethoxylate ( NPE )
   - nitrilotriacetic acid ( NTA )
   - phosphates
   - silica
   - sodium hydroxide
   more ..


  2) Alternative Ways
 ---------------------
  Yeah, now as a little addition some alternative ways to save some energy
  , money and trash. Many things today are done by machines but do we
  always need this? For example there are electronic machines to cut our
  bread - i mean, is it too hard for us to cut the bread by hand? Did you
  ever cutted bread by hand or do you always used a machine to do that?

  I like doing things where i do not need a machine - even when such a
  machine does exist. Many alternative ways are not so dangerous as if you
  do them by a machine. Here are some examples what you can do by hand
  without any problem but where also machines exists which could do it for
  you:

   - cutting bread by hand
   - cleaning the teeth by hand
   - washing your clothes by hand
   - cooling your food in winter on your balcony
   - drying your washed clothes by fresh air only
   - open cans by hand
   - dry your hair with towel
   - use stairs instead of a lift if you can
   - walk or use a bicycle if you can
   - make coffee and tea by hand
   - cut some fruits by hand
   - securely destroy important paper by hand or burn them
   - press some fruits by hand
   - wash and dry your dishes by hand
   - writing a letter by hand instead sending email or SMS
   - reading a book instead of watching TV
   and so on ...

  There is not always the need to buy such products - in my oppinion it is
  a lot waste of money and energy - and the more you do such things the
  more you use your brain and do something for your physically fitness. In
  2.1 and 2.2 you will find some details on two examples. Do not forget:
  all the technical products you buy to do these things , for example an
  electronic toothbrush , include also lots of toxins - but this is an
  other issue which could be labeled "poisoning the earth" - this paper
  here is more about poisoning yourself / your body. But there are also
  some situation where you could need at least some of these machines,
  sure. I just wanted to mention this here a bit.
  

  2.1) Washing By Hand
 -----------------------
  The subject says it. Why not washing your clothes and your dishes by
  hand instead of using a dryer, a washing machine and a dishwasher? In
  many cases you can avoid these machines and you will at least save some
  energy. Many people maybe would say "i do not have the time, i need this
  machine" but is there really no life possible without at least some of
  these machines?

  For example washing your dishes by hand only and drying them with a
  simple towel. I mean, you save so much money if you do not buy the
  dishwasher. And think about if the machines is defect then you need to
  repair it which costs again lots of money or you buy a complete new
  product - "the best of the year" probably. Yeah, i think there is
  nothing wrong for at least washing your dishes without a machine.


  2.2) Cooling by Winter
 ------------------------
  Probably this is not something for everybody but think about the low and
  cold temperatures in winter, outside of your home. Why not use these
  natural temperatures for cooling your food and drinks while it is winter
  time outside? You can pull the plug from your icebox for this time and
  save at least the money for some months. I mean where is the problem
  when you open your balcony door instead of opening your icebox door?

  I mean, the temperatures in winter are mostly far under 0 degree celsius
  and you could put all your food and drinks into plastic boxes and put
  them on your balcony if you have one or somewhere else outside if
  possible. This can be also funny as a little back to basic trip.


  3) Dangers Of Electronics
 ---------------------------
  Mobile- and cellphones are spreading like grass today - most people want
  to have such a device that everyone can reach them nearly everywhere.
  Even young children around 10 years have already such a device. But what
  the industry is hiding from you and them are the evil health risks from
  these products - their unhealthy deadly radiation. Yeah, that is right:
  _deadly_ radiation.

  France for example is one of the countries who write on such products
  that you should not phone with them for a long time period. Think about
  how many people are using these phones today and how young they already
  are. The mobile phone industry does not exist that long so the side
  effects will be seen later but not yet. The worst is still to come
  scientists say.

  The radiation from cellphones can cause brain cancer and eye cancer
  specially because the phone is always in the near of the brain and the
  eye - and both brain and eye are made of sensitive material.


  3.1) Mobile/Cell Phones
 -------------------------
  Do you know the experiment with the egg and the two mobile phones? If
  not then let me tell it to you: you take a raw egg and you put it in an
  eggcup, then you take two mobile phones - one you put on the left of the
  egg and one you put on the right of the egg - and then you make a call
  with both of the phones ( the left is calling the right phone ). And
  guess what happens after one hour? The egg is done, it is cooked, it is
  hard - you can strip off the peel of the egg and you could eat it. Yes,
  that is what happens in this experiement, you can find this also as a
  video on the internet. This is what happens also to your brain - it will
  be cooked. Do you know this: your ear becomes hot when you phone for a
  long while? This is due to the strong unhealthy radiation beam.

  So it is better to avoid mobile- / cellphones. A scientist said that we
  have today 50.000 victims of cancer due to cellphones and because of the
  extreme spreading of this technology we will have probably nearly
  500.000 victims of cancer due to mobile phones in the year 2010.

  Children are the ones who are the most affected because they are still
  growing and their body is not fully developed. So if your child is
  using a mobile phone you should take it away - the radiation is really
  strong and unhealthy. Even if you are an adult then you should put away
  your cellphone too. Period.

  Also: while you phone the number of your white blood cells is raising a
  lot - the longer and the more you phone the more white blood cells your
  body will produce - this can cause leukemia.


  3.2) Cordless Phones
 ----------------------
  Believe it or not: the risks of cordless phones are even much higher
  than the risks of mobile phones. First, they are sending their radiation
  24 hours, every day and every year inside of your home - if they are in
  use or not - it does not matter. Second, here we have two devices which
  are sending radiation ( 24 hours / day ) - the station device and the
  mobile device - both are sending a strong radiation out which can cause:

   - leukemia
   - brain tumors
   - insomnia
   - headaches
   - erratic behaviour
   - listlessness
   - aggression
   - sleeplessness

  Again children are highly affected and i have read an article where some
  parents said that their children had very bad feelings and insomnia due
  to the radiation of their cordless phone - after they turned it off the
  kids were normal again and felt better soon after. To be save you would
  have to go 100 metres away from your cordless phone devices. So cordless
  phones are up to 100 times stronger than mobile phones.

  The charger of the phones sends a radiation of 6.0 volts per metre - and
  0,05 volts per metre is the level where you can say that you are save -
  so the radiation is very high and powerfull. Do not use or buy such
  products. Period.


  3.3) How To Avoid Risks
 -------------------------
  Simply do not buy a mobile phone or use a mobile phone. Do not give your
  children mobile phones. Also do not buy cordless phones. Tell all your
  friends and people you know about the dangers of such radiation and make
  a research with them or alone. Inspire them to drop their phones too.

  If you own a mobile phone or a cordless phone then stop using them right
  now. If your children have such a device then take it away from them too
  and explain them why that they also can inform their friends and the
  children at school too.

  Use and buy normal simple phones with a cord and use public telephone
  boxes too. That is all to do here. Avoiding the risks by avoiding the
  products. Period.


  4) Dry Air & House Dust
 -------------------------
  Dry air and house dust can cause health problems too. How will you
  become dry air? One of the main reasons of dry air is that there is not
  enough fresh air inside of the room. Another reason is in many cases
  that the heater is too hot. And of course if you have a carpet inside of
  this room and you do not clean it regular with a vacuum cleaner than the
  chances are even more higher.

  In the carpet you will find the so called house dust, and like said if
  you do not clean it regular the dust from the carpet will create a
  sensation and will be mixed with the dry air - and this is not good.


  4.1) Dangers And Risks
 ------------------------
  Dry air mixed with the house dust can cause asthma. Because of the lack
  of the fresh air it can also cause concentration trouble because your
  brain will not become enough oxygen - it can also cause breath trouble.

  Due to the dirt in the carpet there can be mites who live by eating your
  hair or your dandruff. These mites can make you even more sick specially
  when you have them in your bed. These mites will let their excrement on
  your carpet and in your bed - this is what can cause allergic reactions.

  House dust can also cause allergic reactions. And the mites can live
  inside of your pillow, bedspread and the bed itself. Mites are 0,1 mm to
  0,5 mm big - so they are very tiny. If your pets are playing on the
  ground or your baby / children then they can come in touch with these
  mites.


  4.2) How To Avoid Risks
 -------------------------
  You can avoid such problems by doing some simple things:

   - let fresh air into your rooms a few times a day regular
   - do not use carpet inside rooms where you sleep
   - turn of the heater while you sleep
   - use beds with synthetic cover - mites can not live on them
   - wash your quilt cover by 60 degree celsius - this is the heat what
     you need that the mites are dying
   - wash your bedding regular by 60 degree celsius
   - use 100% natural cleaning products against mites
   - use antiallergic bedding
   - do not heat rooms too much for too long
   - use wood for the ground if you can instead of carpet


  5) Toxic Plastics & BPA
 -------------------------
  We use plasic nearly everywhere where we can imagine. But pastics also
  include toxins which can bring intoxication and health risks to you.
  These toxins can be freed for example when you use food in a plastic
  case to make it hot in a microwave. Due to the heat of the microwave and
  water inside of the food, the plastic will freed some of its toxins and
  it will go directly into your food.

  You can say that you are always at risk to this when you use plastic
  things which are contacted to water or/and contacted to heat. These are
  the two main reasons to freed the included toxins in plastics. When your
  baby for example drinks out of a plastic bottle it is also at risk to
  get a intoxication for sure.

  These toxins can cause:

   - heart disease
   - diabetes
   - liver damage
   - thyroid hormone disruption
   - direct exposure damage
   - nerve damage
   - obesity promoting effects
   - pollute our ocean
   - loss of cognitive function and memory
   - damage of the developing nervous system by kids


  5.1) Where Toxins Are Included
 --------------------------------
  They are included in:

   - baby bottles
   - plastic drinking bottles
   - plastic food containers
   - canned foods
   - plastic toys
   - childrens clothing
   more .. ( make a research )


  5.2) BPA & Other Toxins
 -------------------------
  One of the main toxins in plastics is called BPA ( Bisphenol A ). You
  will find this toxin in many plastic things you use daily. A few
  examples where it is included you will find in the list above. But BPA
  is not the only toxin - another toxic plastic ingredient is called PBDEs
  ( polybrominated diphenyl ethers ) - this is what you can find in
  plastic toys and clothing for chldren.


  5.3) Solutions
 ----------------
  Here are some ways to come out of this plastic intoxication:

   - do not use food or drinks in mircowaves with plastic containers
   - do not use plastic bottles
   - do not use plastic containers
   - try to get products which use glass and aluminium instead of plastic
   - do not buy canned food
   - use BPA free plastic bottles
   - use BPA free baby bottles
   - take care that your children will not put plastics in its mouth
   - use glass, porcelain and stainless steel containers ( specially for
     hot and liquid food )


  6) Aspartame
 --------------
  Aspartame is a chemical sugar which is used for example in the so called
  "light" products - these products have no normal sugar, instead they
  include some chemical ingredients that make your products tasting sweet.

  One famous light product is cola light - in it there can also be this
  aspartame. Also in sugarfree chewing gum there can be aspartame included
  too. But it is included in many other (light) products too. ( make a
  research )

  Aspartame is also known as "nutrasweet" and "is" specially for people
  who have diabetes or people who make a diet because it includes no sugar
  like said. Aspartame is made by the company "monsanto". Some people
  already died due to aspartame.


  6.1) health problems
 ----------------------
  Aspartame can cause:

   - seizures and convulsions
   - dizziness
   - tremors
   - migraines and severe headaches
   - memory loss
   - slurring of speech
   - confusion
   - numbness or tingling of extremities
   - chronic fatigue
   - depression

   - irritability
   - panic attacks
   - marked personality changes
   - phobias
   - rapid heart beat, tachycardia
   - asthma
   - chest pains
   - high blood pressure
   - nausea or vomitting
   - diarrhea
   - abdominal pain
   - swallowing pain
   - itching
   - hives / urticaria
   - allergic reactions
   - blood sugar control problems
   - menstrual cramps and other menstraul problems or changes

   - excessive thirst or excessive hunger
   - bloating, edema

   - joint pain
   - brain cancer
   - death


  6.2) cane sugar
 -----------------
  As a replacement for sugar which is chemically handled, sweetener or
  specially in that case the toxic aspartame you can just use cane sugar.
  Cane sugar tastes very fine and is not chemically handled like the
  normal white sugar you eat or use. Cane sugar tastes spicy and is not
  that sweet - it is more mild and the main taste is the spicy aroma with
  a bit of the mild sweet besides. If you have never tried cane sugar then
  you should do it and use it as your normal sugar but that is just my tip
  here because i love cane sugar and normal white sugar can not replace
  this mild and spicy 100% natural sugar.


  7) For More Research
 ----------------------
  Here are some more intoxications which can happen to you. I will give
  you just the kewords and you have to do the research. I mean if you read
  the keyword you will already know what i mean. So put these keywords
  into a searchengine and make your own research - they are only included
  as an overview for further investigations and further research in this
  paper. So here are some more hints for health risks:

   - "dangers of vaccines"
