 Hi folks,

here is a little story which i have experienced  some  years  ago.  It  is
about a little one cent choin and how worthy it  is.  For  me  it  was  an
important experience which i probably will not forget.

I was on my way to work and while i was walking i saw a  little  one  cent
coin on the way and my first thought was like  "take  the  coin  up  as  a
choin of luck" but i didn't and thought instead "may another  person  will
find it, i don't need it". Yeah after work on my way to the train  which i
had to take to come home i searched again for this little one  cent  choin
but it wasn't there anyloner.

When i arrived at the trainstation then i wanted to  buy  my  ticket.  But
guess what? The money was not enough to buy the ticket.  ONE  CENT  lacked
and i remembered the little one cent choin which i didn't took up.

Thanks God, another person was on the trainstation and i had to ask him if
he can give me one cent that i can buy the ticket. Yeah that  didn't  felt
much comfortable. He gave me the one cent choin,  thanks  to  him,  and  i
could buy my ticket and traveled home.

Yeah, that was my little story about that little one cent choin. So  never
underrate how worthy a little one cent choin can be. I learned my lesson.

By the way while i write about money: don't forget the poor people,  don't
make treasures or share them with the poor people or donate as much as you
can to people on the streets, people without food, people facing  war  and
so on. _Please_. They _need_ your help! Thank you.

God bless you.
