Warning:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
This document is more accurate than my AHX one by far, considering I'm a
regular at using Milky. However, there are omissions, inaccuacies [well, maybe
, maybe not], and just plain hard-to-read sections in this. I apologise
beforehand, just in case something screws up.

About:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Are you a newbie to tracking? Are you a pro coming to tracking on the PC? Are
you familiar with Milky, but wonder where the shortcuts are? Is ModPlug too
much of a piece of crap to you? Schism too odd? Just need something to read?!
Then... this is the guide for you. 

Tips+Notes...:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
* Use FT2 edit mode rather than Milky. Trust me, it's easier. Especially since
this is the mode you're most likely to get help with, very few use Milky's
"modern" edit mode. Hell, this guide is written assuming you're using FT2
style. Don't expect many of these shortcuts to work in FT2 though, lots of
them are for Milky's new [or nicer] features.
* Go to Config > Resampling > No Interpolation if you are doing any of the
sample synthing tricks in this file. Trust me.

Keys [take note, written for a US key layout, sorry!]:::::::::::::::::::::::::
* Caps Lock or 1: note-off. This screws people up a lot, but note that on not-
Windows platforms, it's usually 1. Try 'em both to see which one works.
* Most of your keys with letters on them: insert note. You should know this.
* F1-F7: change octave. Note that the number after the F is the octave for the
Q key, not the one for Z.
* Ctrl-Alt-C: Copy. There's another shortcut, but I think that's Alt-F4, and
that doesn't work on some non-Windows platforms [namely because the window
manager likely has Alt-F4 bound to say... clicking the close button on the
window]
* Alt-F3 or Ctrl-Alt-X: Cut.
* Ctrl-Alt-V: Paste. There's another key shortcut, but it doesn't work on my
machine [I dunno if the window manager is picking it up or not]
* Alt-F6: Porous Paste. Mixes together what was underneath what you paste and
what you paste on top, rather than clearing it out like normal paste does.
Quite useful, especially for single-channel echo.
* Alt-Arrow key: Select. You do this before you copy or cut or whatever :D
* Shift-Up/Down: Change instrument.
* Shift-Left/Right: Move in orderlist.
* Shift-V: Volume scale the track.
* Ctrl-V: Volume scale the pattern.
* Alt-V: Volume scale the block you selected.
* Ctrl-Alt-Z: Undo.
* Ctrl-I: Bring up instrument editor.
* Ctrl-S: Bring up sample editor.
* Ctrl-A: Bring up advanced edit box.
* Shift-I: Interpolate. This is useful as hell. A special little tip is to use
it on effects: put an effect that has memory on. At the top and bottom of
where you want to apply the effect, put it there. Select the effect column
from the top of where you want it to the bottom, and interpolate. Then put in
the parameters for the effect at the top. Seems long, but it beats holding
down the effect letter for 64 rows. Much faster than it sounds.
* `: Change edit step [how many rows to skip when inserting notes]. Adds 1 to
it. Use Shift+` to decrease it. Seems not to work on OSX.

Getting Started:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
* Earlier revisions of this file assumed the reader had some knowledge of
using a tracker. I don't know why they did, you are likely reading this
because you don't. So, to business:

* Load up Milky. You should see the note grid. Pressing spacebar will change
between edit and preview modes [edit mode allows the user to input notes in
the grid, preview lets you test an instrument].

* Before we can even input a single note, we need an instrument. Click the
Sample Edit button [it might be abbreviated, maybe as Smp. Edit, depending on
your Milky resolution]. Rightclick in the big black box with a line [otherwise
known as the sample area], and click "New". In the dialog that appears, type
128 and press OK.

* Now, rightclick that area again, go to Generators > Sawtooth. Change volume
to 40. Press OK. 

* This is the most important bit of making an instrument this way [eg, not
using outside sample sources] -- set the loop. There should be a bunch of
radio buttons near the sample area, click the one that says "Forward".

*There, you have a sample! On to getting notes in the pattern! Check out the
Instrument Tips section of this document for more information on sample
making.


<todo: write this section in morebetterer fashion>
* Making notes in a pattern -- press space so the line is red, arrow keys
move the cursor, use the keyboard letters to input notes, function keys set
octave.
<yes, this needs a rewrite, why do you ask?>

Instrument Tips:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
* Want an easy echo effect? Does your sample loop?
Then... either A: make an instrument with an envelope like so:
==================
\  
 \ |\
  \| `, |`,
   \   \|  `,|``..
==================
if you want a fairly lazy echo. Try to keep the lengths of the fades the same,
and realize that this echo doesn't sustain. At all.

...or B: if you want sustain...
==================
|
`,
 |
 
==================
Use a really steep, really short drop that doesn't completely reach the
bottom. Sustain it at the first point, and have a really low fadeout [try say,
around 07C or so]. Remember, XM instruments don't stop at the end of the
envelope, unlike in IT. When you're ready to cut the note, use a note-cut or
Kxx on that. If working at speed 6, I like using K04, personally.

* Using the sample editor for anything described here? Then you'll need a
little setup. Remember -- unless specified, make sure your settings are as so
for any samples you make for the "Sample limited?" section below...
When making a new sample [right-click when on the wave area > New], set the
length to 100. When choosing your wave [right-click wave area > Generate >
anything but Noise or Silence], make sure volume is at 50.00 and period is at
1.0. Why? Prevents clipping, and these are the settings the sounds here were
created with. Also, I mention this here because this guide is written a bit
inconsistently -- I mightn't explain something earlier on that I eventually
get to later, so putting this before lets me ignore that issue because what
you need is before now.

Once you're comfortable [or feel like I'm hand-holding you too much], you can
do things differently. Actually, in normal use, I use 40.00 when I make
samples. Also, a lot of my samples are synthed by bouncing them out of another
tracker, Renoise, which has a bunch of DSPs and stuff, and supports VST/DSSI
plugins/instruments.

* Sample limited? Try synthing out samples in Milky. Try combining waves that
you generate with the built in sample editor. Drawing works too, but sometimes
things sound better with clean and well-formed chipwaves.

NOTE NOTE NOTE! When doing this, remember to turn off interpolation due to the
nature of these waves, unless you want muddy samples. Remember to do this in
the .WAV Disk Op menu as well [change the resampler to no interpolation on the
save as box, underneath where it says Quality].

One nice thing you can easily synth is a supersaw. Assuming instrument 1 is a
saw, put this at the top of your pattern, set it to speed 6, BPM 125, and
do a WAV disk-op on it [Ctrl-D, select .WAV and Save As in that order, then
hit record]:

00|C-5*1*****|C-5*1**X18|C-5*1**X28|C-5*1**202|C-5*1**102|

and that's it. Load the sample into Milky and clean it up a bit by cutting off
the very beginning: you'll hear the instruments detuning slowly until they
form a supersaw. Try changing the parameters on this one, for example, making
the values smaller produces a nice phasing instrument. Try to loop it well,
it's a bit tricky. Cut any excess sample you don't need, too: long samples are
huge.

Another nice trick is doing a kick drum. With sample 1 being a square and
sample 2 being a triangle at speed 3, 125 BPM.
00|C-5*110250|C-5*240250|
01|*****0C200|*****30200|
02|*****08200|*****20200|
03|*****04200|*****10200|
04|*****00***|*****00***|

Record that, load it back into Milky in another slot, and cut the silence at
the end off. Why mix the square and triangle, and why is the square so quiet?
Square alone sounds distorted. Nice for a gabber track, but you probably don't
want such a harsh sound. Triangle alone sounds wimpy. Seriously, mute the
channel with the square when testing how it sounds. You will hear how wimpy it
is on its own. The square would overpower the triangle at full volume, so it's
quieter, and the mix gives it a richer sound.

There's an even better kick drum if you want more of a clubby sound.
In Milky's sample editor, make a sine wave for instrument 1. Ping-pong loop
it. Then, at speed 6, 160 BPM...
00|C-7*140240
01|*****30200
02|*****20200
03|*****10200
04|*****00***
and do the record thing. The ping-pong sine has a sound like a low-pass
filtered square wave, so it retains the best characteristics of a sine
[smoothness, clearness], and a square [loudness, punch].

Take note, the BPM and speed values listed are just for best effect when
sampling these sounds. You can use a different BPM/speed combination, but then
you'll have to tweak the sounds to fit.
Take further note -- you don't have to bounce these sounds to samples and load
them back in if you don't want to, but you will have to deal with the channel
usage that this incurs. Also, changing the notes as needed too. 

With that in mind, here's a sound that doesn't lend well to sampling, PWM.
It works when sampled, and sounds the same almost, but looping it is annoying,
unless you want to spend a while figuring out where it sounds just right.

Here's what you do:
Make 2 sawtooth waves. Take the second one and go to Advanced > Backwards in
the wave area's right-click menu. Go to the Ins. Edit screen [the button is in
the top left corner of the Milky display, or just hit Ctrl-I] and change the
finetune to -003 or so.
Then, in your pattern...
00|C-4*1*****|C-4*2*****
and remember to substitute C-4 for the note you want. If you don't want the
sound to start over when you have a new note, for any note except the first
you use this instrument on in the pattern, use the effect 3FF.

So an example pattern would be
00|C-4*1*****|C-4*2*****
01|**********|**********
02|**********|**********
03|**********|**********
04|D-4*1**3FF|D-4*2**3FF
05|**********|**********
06|E-4*1**300|E-4*2**300   <--NOTE! 3xx has memory, so you only need to do 3FF
07|**********|**********      once on the pattern. You can just type 300 on
08|**********|**********      the rest [so, just type 3 in the first column]!
...and you can see where this goes.

Pattern Tips::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
* The 3FF tip is useful for a lot more than just the PWM not resetting, you
can apply that to most other samples, especially if it has a long attack and
you don't want it constantly restarting. If the attack is done with envelopes
instead of in the sample, you might just want to zero out the instrument
column [just type 0 over whatever is in it, DO NOT HIT DELETE], which will
prevent the instrument from restarting.

* Volume column effects are fantastic. Look those up in the official Milky
manual, which is the best reference for what you can do. One of my favorites
is vibrato and portamento. Set vibrato on first note, then use V0 in the
volume column down the pattern. Then, on the first note to portamento to, use
3xx [say, 330], and continue that down the pattern. You can even do things
like arps with vibrato [although, you'll have to set the vibrato with 4xy
somewhere else, either in the pattern above, or in some empty space above your
notes if there is any. There is the option of setting it with Sx and Vy on the
first 2 notes of the arp if neither of the previous options is avaliable, but
you won't have vibrato on the first row [or it might be screwed up from a
previous vibrato setting... take note!]]
