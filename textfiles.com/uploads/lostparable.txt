                                 The Lost Parable
                         ==================================

            And when they were come out of the synagogue, He bespoke His
         disciples and saith unto them, let us withdraw ourselves from
         this place. He spake so that the multitude heardest not, lest
         they throng Him.

            And so it came to pass that He gathered together Himself and
         twelve others that were His disciples, within a rude shack. Lo,
         He seated Himself in His glory on the matting. After they had
         eaten of the fruits of the land and had drunk of the wine of the
         grapes, He said unto Mark, Be calm, for thee have I chosen alone
         to serve me this day, take up this chillum and adore. Mark arose
         and finding the chillum empty cried out without faith. And He
         said unto them Why are ye so fearful? why make you this ado and
         weep? And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What
         manner of man is this, that cares not of the lack of Gange. And
         He heard their discontent and He seeth the tumult therein His
         brothers and so spake He unto them saying, Be still!

             Such was His tone that they were astonished with a great
         astonishment. I say unto thee that this day I didst go into the
         wilderness, to speak unto my Father who is the great One in all
         of the Heavens and He provided as I shall to you provide also.

             Then He in his great wisdom, unclasped the folds of His robe
         and brought forth a brick of Herb, that from the locality had
         been raised. And lo, He sheweth this and performed a blessing,
         and He suffered no man to go without, no less than such a weight
         as it measured one cubit by a cubit by a cubit saying. Verily I
         say unto you, may thee be well off thine faces, go forth and
         preach my gospel of love. And there was much musick and dancing.
         And they all saw visions and had dreams, for His Spirit was with
         them, and all was well forever.

             Here endeth todays reading. Those that hath ears to hear,
         let them hear. Those that hath hash, let them roll a spliff.
