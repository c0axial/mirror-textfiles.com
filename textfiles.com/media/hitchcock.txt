Trivia:
- Hitchcock makes his cameo appearance 4 minutes in wearing a cowboy hat
  outside Janet Leigh's office.

- The film only cost $800,000 to make yet has earned more than $40,000,000.
  Hitchcock used the crew from his TV series to save time and money. In
  1962 exchanged the rights to the film and his TV-series for a huge block
  of MCA's stock (he became their third largest stockholder).

- Robert Bloch's original novel was inspired by the notorious serial killer
  Ed Gein who was also one of the inspirations for the character of Hannibal
  Lector (The Silence of the Lambs/Manhunter).

- Hitchcock bought the rights to the novel anonymously from Robert Bloch for
  just $9,000. He then bought up as many copies of the novel as he could to
  keep the ending a secret.

- The shower scene has over 90 splices in it, and was not directed by Alfred
  Hitchcock.   The production designer [?] had such a good idea for the scene
  that Hitchcock let him direct it.

- During the shooting of the shower scene, Hitchcock arranged for the water to
  suddenly go ice-cold when the attack started.

- Hitchcock originally envisioned the shower sequence as completely silent,
  but Bernard Herrmann went ahead and scored it anyway and Hitch immediately
  changed his mind.

- The blood in the shower scene is actually chocolate sauce.

- The shot of Janet Leigh flushing the toilet is believed to be the first
  such shot in American cinema history.

- Hitchcock tested the "fear factor" of mother's corpse by placing it in
  Janet Leigh's dressing room and listening to how loud she screamed when
  she discovered it.

- There is a rumor that the MPAA refused to pass this film because they
  claimed to be able to see Janet Leigh's nipple during the shower scene.
  Hitchcock didn't edit it out, but merely sent it back, (correctly, it seems)
  assuming that they either wouldn't bother to watch it, or miss it the second
  time.

- Hitchcock insisted that audiences should only be allowed to see the film
  from the start so as not to ruin the surprise. This was unheard of back
  then as people were used to just coming in at any point during a movie.

- After the film's release Hitchcock received an angry letter from the
  father of a girl who refused to have a bath after seeing Diabolique and now
  refused to shower after seeing Psycho. Hitch sent a note back simply
  saying "Send her to the dry cleaners".

Trivia:
- Hitchcock's trademark can be seen on a neon sign in the view from the
  apartment window.

- The film was shot in a series of 8 minute continuous takes (the maximum
  amount of film that a camera could hold). At the end of each segment the
  camera zooms in on a dark object, ready to zoom out for the start of the
  next segment. Most of the props were on castors and the crew had to wheel
  them out of the way as the camera moved around the set.

- Hitchcock only managed to shoot roughly one segment per day. The last 4 or 5
  segments had to be completely re-shot because Hitch wasn't happy with the
  colour of the sunset.

Trivia:
- Hitchcock makes his cameo appearance about 11 minutes in wearing a gray
  suit walking past Gavin Elster's shipyard.

- The film is based upon the novel "D'Entre les Morts" which was written
  specifically for Hitchcock after the authors heard that he tried to
  buy the rights to their previous novel "Diabolique".

- San Juan Batista, the Spanish mission which features in key scenes in the
  movie doesn't actually have a bell tower - it was added with trick
  photography. The mission originally had a steeple but it was demolished
  following a fire.

- The screenplay is credited to Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor, but Coppel
  didn't write a word of the final draft. He is credited for contractual
  reasons only. Taylor read neither Coppel's script nor the original novel,
  he worked solely from Hitchcock's outline of the story.

- Hitchcock reportedly spent a week filming a brief scene where Kim Novak
  stares at a portrait in the Palace of the Legion of Honor just to get the
  lighting right.

- Hitchcock invented the famous combination of forward zoom and reverse
  tracking shot to convey the sense of vertigo to the audience. The view
  down the mission stair well cost $19,000 for just a couple of seconds of
  screen time.

- Hitchcock originally wanted Vera Miles to play Madeleine, but she got
  pregnant and was therefore unavailable.
