Cheers Quiz, 18-Apr-1991 edition.

Many thanks to Eric Jorgensen (jorgy@boulder.colorado.edu) and
Kevin Treu (kst@cs.virginia.edu), co-authors of the Cheers episode
guide, for their help in researching and proofreading this quiz.

The questions are sorted by topic, not by difficulty.  Estimated
difficulty ratings (enclosed in [square brackets]) are:

    0 = solvable by casual viewers
    1 = solvable by moderately devoted viewers
    2 = solvable by addicted viewers
    3 = research problem

+ and - can be used to adjust the value.  E.g., 0+ or 2-.
In particular, a rating of 3+ means that even watching every
single second of every episode won't help.

A `*' means that the information is contained in only one episode.
For these questions, the ratings are

   *0 = solvable if you watched the episode casually
   *1 = solvable if you watched the episode carefully
   *2 = a single line of dialog answers the question
   *3 = you need freeze-frame to answer this one


If the rating is given as [?], that means the question was
submitted by somebody else, and I didn't know the answer, so I
couldn't give it a rating.

Some of the questions are trick questions.  You will score
bonus points if you give both the obvious (wrong) answer
and the correct (trick) answer.

CHAPTER 13: Questions you aren't expected to be able to answer

Don't keep score on these questions.  If I were rating them,
they would all be [3+] level question.

157: While casting for Cheers, the search centered on three pairs
     for the two lead roles.  Of course, the duo of Ted Danson and
     Shelley Long won out.  Who were the two losing teams?

158: Why did Cheri Eichen (the creator of W2) choose the name she did
     for the character?

159: What is the relation between Heide Perlman and Rhea Perlman?

160: Who invented the character of Cliff Clavin?


CHAPTER 14: More useless trivia

The `evil foosball table' subplot of ``Achilles Hill'' is an
inside joke.  The Cheers actors are real foosball addicts.

Woody Harrelson likes to shoot spitballs at George Wendt
during breaks in filming.  If you look carefully, you can
sometimes see a spitball just above George's eyebrow.
(Woody is the prankster on the set.)

Each answer contains a reference to the episode(s) wherein the
answer can be found, contained in square brackets.  If the episode
is given as [?], then I don't know which episode it came from.
Episode titles are given in the Cheers Episode Guide being
produced by Eric Jorgensen (jorgy@boulder.colorado.edu) and
Kevin Treu (kst@cs.virginia.edu).

Scoring:

For most questions, score one point for each correct answer.
If a question has more than one part, score one point for
each part.  If you are asked to produce a list, score one
point for each item you can list.  Here are some examples:

   Who is the President of the United States?          =1
   What are the first two letters of the alphabet?     =2
   List the colors of the rainbow.                     =7
   How many synonyms for `stupid' can you think of?    =B

For the last question, you score one point for each synonym
you can think of.  So if you got the first three all correct
and thought of five synonyms, then you score 1+2+7+5 = 15.

For trick questions, the scoring is given explicitly.

Sections that begin with the word `incidentally' are for
personal edification and are worth no points.

A perfect score is 233 points from the regular questions,
plus 122 points from the 25 bonus questions (the `B' questions),
for a total of 355.


CHAPTER 1: The show itself

     [Show Down (Part 1); Power Play; Coachie Makes Three;
     Norman's Conquest; The Groom Wore Clearasil]

     Sometimes John Ratzenberger says `Here's a fascinating
     fact:  Cheers is filmed...'  [No Contest; Show Down (Part 2)]

     Many of the first-season episodes just show the `Cheers' sign
     with no voice-over. [Coach Returns to Action; Endless Slumper;
     The Spy Who Came in for a Cold One; Father Knows Last]

     Sometimes, we just hear the audio from the scene in progress:
     Cliff babbling. [Where There's a Will...]
     Coach listening to the radio. [No Help Wanted]
     Coach saying it's closing time. [I'll Be Seeing You (Part 2)]

     In the winter, you might see snow falling on the `Cheers' sign.
     [Christmas Cheers]

     For the second of a two-part episode, Ted Danson said `Last time
     on `Cheers'...' [Little Carla, Happy at Last (Part 2)]

  2: `Where Everybody Knows Your Name'.
     Written by Judy Hart Angelo and Gary Portnoy.
     Sung by Gary Portnoy. [flashes during the end credits]

     `Wings'.
     Norm and Cliff take a fishing vacation on Sandpiper Air, but
     end up spending all their time in local bars.  (Incidentally,
     Wings was created by Peter Casey, David Lee and David Angell,
     who also worked on `Cheers'.)

     `Major League Baseball'.
     The `Cheers' gang appeared in one of the pre-game shows for the
     1986 World Series between the Mets and the Red Sox.  It was a

     characters.  Throughout, Diane was enamored with the TV camera and
     could always be seen in the background waving.

     A spinoff sitcom `The Tortellis' based on Nick and Loretta died a

     for mentioning any of them.)

     The `Cheers' gang also produced a short film promoting US Savings
     Bonds sometime between 1985 and 1987.  Cliff comes in and
     describes his Florida vacation, and mentions that he paid for it
     from his savings bonds.

     The `Cheers' gang appeared in an `Energizer' promotion in 1991.

     George Wendt did one or two `Meisterbrau' commercials,
     pretending to a beer-guzzling sort of fellow.

     John Ratzenberger did a `Hallmark' commercial, pretending to be
     a mailman.

     (Most networks have a policy of not airing commercials that
     use characters from rival networks.  That's why George and John
     don't portray Norm and Cliff in commercials, but rather people
     who happen to bear a striking similarity to Norm and Cliff.)

        Pregnant in character (Frederick) in seventh season.

     Kirstie Alley:
        Pregnant in real life during summer between eighth and ninth
        seasons.  The writers intended to write her pregnancy into
        the plot (Who is the father?  Sam or Robin?), but Kirstie
        suffered a miscarriage and the plan was dropped.

    Incidentally, another quasi-regular, Mandy Ingber (Annie Tortelli),
    was pregnant in character, but we haven't yet learned what came of
    it.

  7: In the episode where Sam tries to get away for a ski weekend with
     his baseball buddies, Coach is trying to break his record for
     breaking the fewest number of glasses in a month.  But his hopes
     are dashed when he slips on a banana peel when making a tropical
     drink.  [Snow Job]

  8: When Sam destroys a priceless book that he was holding for Diane,
     he purchases it outright.  Diane confesses that seeing the
     literate, sensitive side of Sam has stirred new feelings in her,
     and the two kiss passionately.  But when Diane mentions that she
     expects $700 from Sam to pay for the book, Sam's demeanor changes:
     `Hold me Sam. ... Sam, you're holding me a little tight. ...
     Sam, I can't breathe.' [I'll Gladly Pay You Tuesday]

     When Kelly realizes that Woody can't afford the pendant he bought
     for her birthday, she gives it back.  When she says that love is
     more important than material things, they hug and she mentions
     that this means she won't have to buy Woody a Ferrari for his
     birthday.  At which point, Woody's eyes open wide:  `Woody,
     you're holding me a little too tight. ... Woody?' [The Gift of
     the Woodi]

     Andy-Andy's realistic rendition of the strangulation scene
     from `Othello' doesn't count. [Homicidal Ham]


CHAPTER 2: The Bar

  9: The Bull and Finch Pub in Boston.

 10: This was a trick question.
     The sign at the start of the show says `1895', but the bar
     was actually established in 1889.  Carla chose `1895' for
     numerological reasons.  [The Stork Brings a Crane]

     (Score one point for each year you mentioned, for a perfect score
     of 2 points.)

 11: Rebecca researched the bar's history for its 100th anniversary,
     and discovered that it was a House of Ill Repute.
     [The Stork Brings a Crane]

     Diane dreamt that it was an old house with a wine cellar,
     but that doesn't count since it was just a dream. [Diane's
     Nightmare]

 12: Officially 2am, though the actual closing time seems to be
     rather flexible. [Never Love a Goalie (Part 1); Little Carla,
     Happy at Last (Part 2); What's Up, Doc?]

 13: The sign above the door reads `Maximum room capacity 75 persons'
     (the `75' is handwritten).

     It is very difficult to see this sign because of its location,
     and the fact that even if you do see it, the camera is usually
     so far away that you can't make out very much.  Especially not
     the `75' part.

 14: Depends which episode you watch.  It's usually a closet.
     [Diane's Nightmare; Backseat Becky, Up Front]

     But sometimes it's a staircase into the basement.
     [Don't Paint Your Chickens]
     (Diane also dreamed that it led to a hidden basement.)
     [Diane's Nightmare]

     We often see Sam or Woody carrying crates out of it, but that
     doesn't indicate clearly whether it's a closet or a staircase.
     [2 Good 2 Be 4 Real; Don't Paint Your Chickens]

     Please Report any un-fairness [sic] to the proprietor.'
     The quotation is embroidered on a sign hung on the wall next to
     the corridor to the back room.  You can read it if you know where
     it is and the camera holds steady.

 22: The sign at the base of the stairs says
     ``Melville's Fine Sea Food''.

 23: We never see or hear Vic, the maitre d'. [Personal Business;
     Coach in Love (Part 1); Diane Meets Mom; How to Win Friends and

     John Hill bought Melville's.

     In addition to being generally obnoxious to Sam, he also

     At one point, Coach introduces himself as `Satchmo'.  Diane says,
     `Coach, you're thinking of Louis Armstrong.'  Coach replies, `No,
     but I like that even better.'  He later says to Sam, `You can call
     me Louis Armstrong.' But this doesn't count as a nickname, since
     nobody actually called him that. [Just Three Friends]

 89: Depends who you ask.  At the wedding ceremony, his name was
     Edward Raymond LeBec.  [Little Carla, Happy at Last (Part 2)]
     But we later learn that his real first name is Guy (rhymes
     with `me'), and that `Eddie' was just a name his American
     friends used. [Call Me, Irresponsible]

     the napkin on top of the glass and puts the straw on top of
     the napkin. [Never Love a Goalie (Part 1)]

         Voice: 'Lo everybody!

         Third panel:
         All: Norm!

         Fourth panel:
         Duke?: [pouring a beer] How's it going general?
         Voice: Ahead of schedule!
                Which is more than I can say for that beer!

         (Thanks to Daniel Callahan for finding this gem.)

     (3) When Norm becomes rich from his investment in Tan 'n Wash,
         everybody is mad at him and doesn't say anything when he
         comes in.  [Tan 'n Wash]

         On the first show with Rebecca, Norm comes in and only Woody
         yells `Norm!'  Norm leaves in disgust.  Later in the show,
         Norm comes in as part of `Operation Wayne Down the Dwain',
         pretending to be an average customer.  One of the customers
         yells `Norm!' and Norm tells him to shut up.
         [Home is the Sailor]

         When Frederick says his first word, `Norm!'.
         [Breaking in is Hard to Do]

         Incidentally, it almost happens when Sam and Diane are the
         only people in the bar when Norm comes in, but they stop
         their heated conversation to yell `Norm!'.
         [Coachie Makes Three]

102: The Hungry Heifer. [Woody Goes Belly Up; I'll Gladly Pay You
     Tuesday; The Bar Stoolie; Cheers: The Motion Picture; Airport V]
     Norm's opinion of the Hungry Heifer has varied.

     He also likes Wally's Pup Burger. [Finally (Part 1)]

     Some Hungry Heifer trivia:
       - Their `Carnivore Platter' consists of a steak, topped off
         with pork chops. [Woody Goes Belly Up]

     [Personal Business]

     Vera's parents live in ``one of those rectangular states.''
     [Coach Buries a Grudge]

107: We hear Vera's voice on a tape recording.  [Love Thy Neighbor]

     During the Thanksgiving food fight, Diane accidentally throws
     a pie in her face, so we get to see all of Vera except for
     her face. [Thanksgiving Orphans]

     We hear her voice and see her legs when she works as a hat-check
     girl upstairs at Melville's. [It's a Wonderful Wife]

     Her voice (and perhaps even her body) is provided by Bernadette
     Birkett, George Wendt's real-life wife.  No screen credit is
     given.  [It's a Wonderful Wife]

108: After he and Vera broke up, Norm dated Arlene Horsley.
     [Old Flames]

     Norm considered having an affair with the neighbor wife,
     Phyllis Henshaw. [Love Thy Neighbor]

     He was also goaded by the gang into having an affair with a

               Professor]
     Department store Santa. [Christmas Cheers]
     Interior decorator. [Norm, Is That You?; Call Me, Irresponsible]

     No points for saying he owned `Tan 'n Wash' because he didn't.
     He was just an investor. [Tan 'n Wash]

111: Ron and Phyllis Henshaw. [Love Thy Neighbor]

112: Bruce.  [Diamond Sam; Little Carla, Happy at Last
     (Parts 1 and 2)]

     In a first-season episode, Cliff says his dad left
     `a few years ago'. [Sam Turns the Other Cheek]
     But when dad comes to visit, Cliff says his dad left when
     he was nine years old.  [The Bar Stoolie]
     (Score one point for either answer; two if you got both.)

115: South Central Branch (SCB). [The Executive's Executioner]

116: Walt Twitchell (played by Raye Birk).

117: ``Curfew?  Come on, Norm.
     I can stay out as long as I want so long as I call by ten.''
     [Sam Turns the Other Cheek]

118: Of course not!  [Cliff's Rocky Moment]

119: Massachusetts  D86 4R3. [?]
     Note that Cliff drove a Studebaker in a previous episode.
     [Cliff's Rocky Moment]

120: ``I'm just one of those people who collects phone book cover
     art.''  [Bar Bet]

121: When the Sears catalogues are mailed. [No Contest; The Bartender's
     Tale]  It was particularly bad in 1985, when the Spiegel
     catalogues came out at the same time.
     (Score 1/2 if you got the basic idea.)

122: A trapeze artist. [Peterson Crusoe]

123: `Celibacy'.
     They are the categories on `Jeopardy' when Cliff is a contestant.

129: Explode.  (Because they were both very fat.) [Woody Goes
     Belly Up]

130: He once maimed someone in a bowling accident. [From Beer to
     Eternity] (Score 1/2 point if you said he killed someone.)

     Here's the story, in Woody's own words:

         I still don't know what happened, you know?  One
         minute I was picking up the 8-10 split, and the next
         thing I know, the 10-pin flies and hits old Sulley
         right between the eyes and he goes down like a sack of
         wheat.  Sam, I ruined a man's life.

     Sam says, ``Oh, come on, I'm sure you're exaggerating.''
     Woody continues:

         Oh no, no I'm not.  Old Sulley got too dim-witted to
         stay in bowling maintenance.  Last I heard, he was a
         clown at children's birthday parties.

     Sam asks, ``What's wrong with that?''  Woody answers:

         He wasn't invited to them.

     of St. Cletes; Birth, Death, Love and Rice]

134: Hester Crane is also a psychiatrist. [Diane Meets Mom]
     She is no longer living.  [To All the Girls I've Loved Before]

136: Dr. Bennett Ludlow (James Karen, the Pathmark spokesman).
     [Whodunit?]
     After Diane abandoned Frasier at the altar, Ludlow became
     his therapist. [Birth, Death, Love and Rice]

137: A session with marriage counselor Simon Finch-Royce (John Cleese).
     It cost him $1500, by the way. [Simon Says]

138: French.  [Little Carla, Happy at Last (Part 1)]
     Chinese.  [The Crane Mutiny]

     Lilith works at Boston General Hospital. [The Cranemakers]

     Finally (Part 1)]

145: A Mercedes.  [Executive Sweet; Hot Rocks]

146: `Backseat Becky' attended the University of Connecticut.
     (And no, we don't know where she got the nickname from.
     The story she told was a fabrication.) [The Last Angry Mailman]
     She majored in marketing. [Don't Paint Your Chickens]

     Incidentally, she wears a UConn sweatshirt at the slumber party
     she throws for Carla. [Slumber Party Massacred]  Oh, and she also
     didn't graduate on schedule.  She failed a course and had to make
     it up over the summer, thereby receiving her diploma in the mail.
     [Sammy and the Professor]

147: Susan Howe is an actress in low-budget horror movies.
     [Sisterly Love] (Score full credit if you just said she was an

     To fend off the advances of Martin Teal.   [One Happy Chappy in a
     Snappy Serape (Parts 1 and 2)]

     minutes earlier, she said Woody was her boyfriend (for the same
     reason).  [Adventures in Housesitting]

150: Rebecca promised to have sex with Sam if she lit up another
     cigarette.  When Sam caught her smoking, she reluctantly agrees
     to go back to her place.  She comments, ``It's all right; I'll
     just close my eyes and imagine someone appealing.''
     [My Fair Clavin]

     Sam pretends to be devastated after learning that he was promoted
     just to be a ringer on the company softball team and tries to
     take advantage of Rebecca's sympathy.  Fed up with fending off his
     advances, she goes completely limp and says emotionlessly, ``Take
     me here.  Take me now.  Please. Please.'' [The Sam in the Grey
     Flannel Suit]

     Rebecca loved him for his money. [Wedding Bell Blues]

     Jean-Marie Bolieur, charge d'affaires at the French Consulate.
     [Finally (Part 2); Where Nobody Knows Your Name]
     Score another point if you remembered Christine Davi.
     [Finally (Part 2)]

154: Robin took Rebecca to `Wally's Pup Burger', a greasy hamburger
     place. [Finally (Part 1)]
     He was found guilty of insider trading.  (He was using Rebecca
     to access the corporation data bank.)  [Cry Hard (Part 1)]

155: A `Women Of Boston Business Award' statuette, which Rebecca won.
     [Little Carla, Happy at Last (Part 2)]

     (Ha, fooled all you people who thought it was a pet name for
     Robin!)

156: ``This machine is for photocopying documents, not your butt.''
     [The Visiting Lecher]


CHAPTER 13: Questions you aren't expected to be able to answer

157: William Devane and Lisa Eichhorn was the ``big name'' duo.

     The other finalist was the duo of Fred Dryer and Julia Duffy.
     Curiously, Fred Dryer and Julia Duffy have appeared as guest
     stars on `Cheers' playing friends of Sam and Diane, respectively.
     [Fred Dryer in Sam at Eleven; Old Flames; `I' on Sports]
     [Julia Duffy in Any Friend of Diane's]

     (Personally, I think Fred Dryer and Julia Duffy would've made
     an interesting combination.)

158: It was the most uptight name she could think of.

159: Heide is Rhea's younger sister.  Interestingly, Heide had no
     writing experience when she started writing for Cheers.  Although
     James Burrows rejected her first story, he encouraged her to
     keep trying and accepted her second story.  Her early stories
     center on Carla because she felt she could do a better job than
     anybody else at writing for her sister.

160: John Ratzenberger created his own character.  He came in for
     a general audition and said, ``Hey, what if there's a bar regular
     who's a know-it-all?  This guy works for the government---he's
     a mailman or something.''  They were so impressed that he was
     promised six episode the first season and promotion to
     co-star status the next season.
