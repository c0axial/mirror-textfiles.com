This is a list of all installments of "The Adventures of
Lone Wolf Scientific" and when they first appeared--as well
as sneak previews of future installments:

I -- "The Computer Genius Goes to Work" -- The worst thing
that can happen to a globe-trotting computer genius is
gainful employment.  From a curb outside an artificial
intelligence company, computer genius S-max contemplates the
wreckage of his employment history.  He desperately hopes
the rescue mission is properly wired for his needs.
(1.21.91)

II -- "The Second Renaissance of Space Exploration
Technology and What Happened to It" -- Bashful boychild
software engineer Andrew.BAS stumbles unwittingly
into the neurosis and smashed dreams of the military-
industrial complex.  Within days he loses his soul while
waiting for a government security clearance.  (2.4.91)

III --  "When Men of Destiny Meet" -- Robbed of the last
vestiges of his engineering school idealism, the dimpled
young software engineer's spirits improve when he befriends
another man who also failed to get a job on the space
shuttle. (2.18.91)

IV  -- "Welcome to The People's Republic of Engineering --
Abandon Hope Ye Who Enter Here" -- Andrew.BAS, the kid
computer programmer who looks like the kind of computer
programmer Norman Rockwell would have drawn, is horrified to
learn that he will be writing batch files to aim nuclear
missiles.  Meanwhile, his new officemate gets into a snit
with their boss over anti-static boot mats.  (3.4.91)

V -- "Bad Days Befall The People's Republic of Engineering"
-- Super engineer-manager Gus Farwick contemplates his
newest problem employee and formulates ways to keep him
safely in his office.  (3.18.91)

VI -- "A Day in the Life of Two Defense Workers" --  S-max
and Andrew.BAS struggle to adjust to their new lives
as defense contractor workers.  When the computer builder
tires of his responsibilities keeping track of "super-string
defense links," he convinces his officemate that they should
design a closet-sized replica of NASA's Mission Control.
(4.1.91)

VII -- "The House Guest with 172 Soldering Irons" --
Andrew.BAS naively offers his homeless officemate a place to
sleep.  He and S-max are barely out of the company parking
garage when the generous-to-a-fault programmer begins to
regret his offer of hospitality. (4.15.91)

VIII -- "The House Where Andrew.BAS Lived" -- The home of a
computer programmer is always a special place.  It's where
free and perfect cerebral sensibility clash with a complete
ineptitude with tangible things.  Andrew.BAS's house is no
exception.  Overbearing houseguest S-max decides that, even
though it's nowhere near a Radio Shack, it's an ideal
place to inhabit indefinitely.  (4.29.91)

IX -- "The Ghost of Alan Turing" -- Monkish assembly
language wizard Austin Jellowack is pestered by an unwelcome
pal from a higher programming realm.  (5.15.91)

X -- "Tense Moments in Mission Control" -- A tense morning
at Dingready & Derringdo Aerospace is made even more so by a
visit from boss Gus Farwick.  Clipboard and camera in hand,
the conniving engineer manager is busy compiling
documentation to terminate the employment of his
two least favorite research engineers.  (6.3.91)

XI -- "Revenge on the Bureacratic Puppet Creature" --
Computer genius S-max discovers that the cans of twine that
his boss has put him in charge of are not "super-string
links between key defense systems," but plain old kite-
string. (6.24.91)

XII -- "The Last Words Bomb"  -- Revenge bent, S-max pilfers
the program code for Dingready & Derringdo Aerospace's
newest smart bomb.  Unfortunately, the short-tempered
computer genius cannot make sense of its inscrutable user-
interface.  (7.15.91)

XIII -- "A Humane Interface for a 'Peace-Keeping Tool'" --
When S-max begs his officemate to write a new user-interface
for a smart bomb, the programmer refuses, expressing
reluctance to use his programming talents to create a better
"instrument of death."  The computer builder explains to him
the concept of a "peace-keeping tool."  (8.5.91)

XIV -- "A Smart Bomb with a Language Parser" -- S-max
attempts to thwart The Last Words Bomb's language parser,
but to no avail.  He discovers that program code is often
more stubborn than human will.  (8.26.91)

XV -- "The High-tech Weapons Demonstration" -- Is
trouble on the way when Dingready & Derringdo Aerospace
demonstrates their newest crop of computer-guided weapons to
military dignitaries?  (9.16.91)

XVI --  "Two Guys in a Garage" -- When the bashful
programmer and the tempermental computer builder find
themselves without jobs, paychecks, government security
clearances, or viable character references, they decide to
do when any two desperate men would do: they start a high-
tech company together. (10.30.91)

XVII -- "The Early Days of a High-Tech Company Are Magic" --
Dreams of shrinkwrap and dollar signs soon give way to the
harsh realities of starting a high-tech firm when S-max and
Andrew.BAS haggle over who will be head of research, whether
moving the computer builder's dirty socks and old magazines
out onto the porch will inhibit his ability to design
innovative circuits, and whether programers have legal
rights in any of the 50 states. (11.18.91)

XVIII  -- "The Couch, the File Cabinet, and the Calendar" --
After the two entrepreneurs stay up all night bickering over
how the file cabinet, the calendar, and the research and
development should be arranged, an irrate neighbor
intercedes and offers some valuable business advice.
(12.9.91)

XIX -- "Engineering the Future of American High-Technology"
-- With a company name and sign on the door, and the
nettlesome question resolved of who will serve as vice
president of R and D on Monday mornings, the
two entrepreneurs set out to conceive the very future of
American high-technology. (1.7.92)

XX --"What Research and Development Was Always Meant To Be"
-- Computer genius S-max has a midnight brainstorm, and
Andrew.BAS is left wondering whether their business venture
can survive. (3.7.92)

XXI -- (UPCOMING 3.29.92) "What Is a Computer Operating
System?" -- S-max puts the finishing touches on his seminal
Coin-Operated Computer Operating System.  He reflects on the
role of the computer operating system in modern society--and
how it is about to be changed forever by the wirey
contraption with the rabbit-ear antenna on his desk.
