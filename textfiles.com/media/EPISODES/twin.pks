      A series of sudden images, as if illuminated by a strobe light with
      darkness in between:
    Cooper in a chair, the dwarf
    Laura's mother running downstairs [from episode 1000]
    Bob at foot of Laura's bed
    A bloody cloth [in the railroad car?]
    Laura dead
    Bob crouched at Laura's bed  [Sarah's vision]
      The One-Armed Man:
    Through the darkness of future past,
    The magician longs to see
    One..chants...out..between two worlds...
    Fire...walk with me.
    We lived among the people -- I think you say convenience store?
    We lived above it.  I mean it like it is, as it sounds.  I too
    have been touched by the devilish one; tattoo on the left shoulder.
    Ah, but when I saw the face of God, I was changed.  I took the
    entire arm off.  My name is Mike.  His name is Bob.
      Bob, crouched in some room full of clutter (tantalizingly
      unrecognizable metal objects) like an attic or basement.  He looks
      around and says:
    Mike?  Mike?  Can you hear me?  [he turns to look at the camera]
    Catch you with my death bag!
    You may think I've gone insane, but I promise I *will* kill again!
      A small mound of dirt with a gold necklace on it, surrounded by a
      ring of candles. A puff of wind; the candles blow out.
      An older Agent Cooper (in his 50s or so) is sitting in a red-carpeted,
      red-curtained lounge.  Laura Palmer is sitting a few chairs away from
      him, dressed in a slinky black dress and looking very elegant.  There
      is a strange scraping noise - a distorted silhouette of a person,
      backlit against a doorway -- it seems to be shuddering somehow -- the
      scraping noise gets faster.  Suddenly the distorted silhouette turns
      around.  It's The Little Man From Another Place.  The scraping sound
      was him rubbing his palms together.  He's got a cheerful, wide smile,
      and he says (in twisted, reversed backwards English)
    Let's rock!
      He sits in one of the chairs.  There is a pause.  A black shadow drifts
      slowly over the red curtains, over their heads. Laura puts one finger
      next to her nose, looking significantly at Cooper.  Then:

      LMFAP: [to Cooper]  I've got good news.  That gum you like is going to
    come back in style.  [noticing Cooper staring at Laura]  She's my
    cousin.  But, doesn't she look almost exactly like Laura Palmer?
      Cooper: [to LMFAP]  But she is Laura Palmer.
    [to Laura]  Are you Laura Palmer?
      Laura: [arching her back weirdly]  I feel like I know her,
    but sometimes my arms bend back.
      LMFAP: She's filled with secrets.  Where we're from, the birds sing a
    pretty song, and there's always music in the air.
      Slow jazz music begins to play.  The Little Man From Another Place
      stands and starts a jerky dance.  Laura stands, crosses to Cooper,
      kisses him, and whispers something in his ear.
      -- Cooper jerks awake, with his special Cooper Cowlick pointing straight
     up.  He calls Harry and says he knows who killed Laura Palmer --
     but it can wait till morning.

   -- Fight at the morgue: Ben and Doc Hayward won't let Albert continue with
      his autopsy.
      Albert: Mr. Horne, I recognize that your position in this fair
    community necessitates venality, insincerity, and a certain irritating
    manner of expressing yourself.  Stupidity, however, is not a necessarily
    inherent trait.  Therefore, please listen closely--You can have a
    funeral any old time.  You dig a hole, you plant a coffin.  I, however,
    cannot perform these tests next year, next month, next week or even
    tomorrow--I must perform them now.  <drill noise--VEEP VEEP!>

    mood. God, James is sweet, but he's so dumb. And right now I can only
    take so much of sweet. Hey, remember that mystery man I told you
    about? Well, if I tell you his name then you're gonna be in trouble.
    He wouldn't be such a mystery man anymore, but you might be history,
    man. I think a couple of times he's tried to kill me. But guess what?

    A kiddly divy, too, wooden shoe?

    Now if the words sounds queer,
    and funny to your ear,
    a little bit jumbled and jivy,
    Sing:

   -- The OAM arrives at the station to "sell shoes" to Truman (to Lucy)
   -- Truman questions James. Cooper demands and gets the locket on a thong
      from James.

     Sometimes, you just get lucky.
   -- Donna arrives at the station in Laura's shades and smoking and meets
      James in his cell.

   -- Cooper has Andy and Lucy look through the back issues of the last three
      years of Fleshworld for Theresa Banks.
      C to D: Diane, just received the back issues of Fleshworld. Good work.
          It's nice to see some cooperation with the law especially from
          a company that preys on human weaknesses.
   -- Hayward examines Jacoby. Cooper and Truman arrive. Cooper confronts
      Jacoby with the locket on a thong: I don't want any baloney, magic
      tricks or psychological mumbo jumbo.
      Jacoby said the night after Laura died, he followed Leo, lost him,
      saw and followed James and Donna and dug up the locket.
      J: Laura was, was in fact, no she was living a double life. Two people.
     Yeah, but then, then when I saw her the last time, she
     I dunno, she seemed to've reached a kind of peace herself. Now I
     believe that what she in fact, she had arrived at was the decision
     to end her life.
      T: Are you saying Laura wanted to die?
      C: Laura Palmer did not commit suicide.
      J: No, but maybe she allowed herself to be killed.

   -- Bobby visits Shelley, brings her flowers

      Ed: I never believed in fate, Agent Cooper. Always felt, you make your
      own way, you take care of your own, you pick up after yourself.

      Cooper: Albert, I would like to speak to Ed.

   -- Bobby runs into his father at the RR:
      MB: "Bobby, may I share something with you?"
      BB: "Okay."
      MB: "A vision I had in my sleep last night, as distinguished from a
    dream, which is mere sorting and cataloguing of the day's events by
    the subconscious. This was a vision, fresh and clear as a mountain
    stream, the mind revealing itself to itself. In my vision, I was on the
    veranda of a vast estate, a palazzo of some fantastic proportion.
    There seemed to emanate from it a light from within, this gleaming,
    radiant marble.  I'd known this place. I had in fact been
    born and raised there.  This was my first return. A reunion with the
    deepest well-springs of my being.  Wandering about, I noticed happily
    that the house had been immaculately maintained. There'd been added
    a number of additional rooms, but in a way that blended so seamlessly
    with the original construction, one would never detect any difference.
    Returning to the house's grand foyer, there came a knock at the door.
    My son was standing there.  He was happy and carefree, clearly living
    a life of deep harmony and joy.  We embraced, a warm and loving
    embrace, nothing withheld.  We were, in this moment, one. My vision
        ended and I awoke with a tremendous feeling of optimism and
    confidence in you and your future.  That was my vision of you. I'm
    so glad to have had this opportunity to share it with you. I wish
    you nothing but the best in all things."
      BB: "Thank you Dad."
      Bobby appears moved. Hank asks Briggs how the pie was and salutes him.
   -- Norma won't talk about Shelley and Bobby recognizes Hank as he who
      shot Leo.
   -- Cooper and Albert tell their theory of what happened on 2/23
    C: The night Laura Palmer was killed, it appears she made 2
       appointments. In her diary, she had written, "Nervous about
       meeting J. tonight." I now believe this was a refernce to James
       Hurley. She was nervous because she planned to tell him she
       didn't want to see him anymore. Before she snuck out of the
       house, she received a phone call.
    A: We believe it was Leo Johnson making a second appointment
       for some time later that night.
    C: Laura met James, was with him until 12:30 when, at the intersection
       of 21 and Sparkwood, she jumped from the bike and ran into
       the woods. We believe that it was there that she met up with
       Jacques Renault, Leo Johnson and Ronette Pulaski. Together
       they drove to the foot of the trail leading to Jacques' cabin.
       They climbed the trail, they were heard passing the cabin of
       the Log Lady. They reached Jacques Renault's cabin at approximately
       1 am. Drugs and alcohgol were consumed. Laura was tied up
       and had sexual relations with both Leo and Jacques. Waldo the
       bird was let out of his cage and attacked Laura. Leo and
       Jacques fought. Jacques went outside and passed out. When he
       came to, Leo and the girls were gone. We believe Leo hiked
       back down to his Corvette alone, leaving the girls behind.
    A: The reason being, there was a third man.
    C: Deputy Hawk found evidence of a third man outside the window
       of Jacques' cabin.
    A: The third man took Laura and Ronette to the train car, where
       they were tied up. Laura for the 2nd time, Ronette for the 1st.
    C: Using a blunt object, the killer hit Ronette and knocked her
       unconscious. He must've been so intent on killing Laura, he
       didn't realize Ronette regained consciousness and escaped.
    A: He either didn't know or he didn't care. He made a small mound
       of dirt and put the half heart necklace of Laura's on top. He
       then placed a small cut out letter R under the nail of her
       left ring finger. You'll recall he placed the letter T under
       the fingernail of Theresa Banks. He, uh, left a note written in
       blood, "Fire, walk with me."
    C: Here's the interesting thing. The blood on the note was tested.
       It doesn't match Leo's, Jacques', Laura's or Ronette's.
    A: So we surmise the killer wrote the note in his own blood. The
       rare type, AB negative. The towel that Deputy Hawk found five
       miles down the tracks was soaked in blood of that type. He
       also found, near the towel, scraps of faded paper.
    C: The scraps may have been left by the killer. They'll be sent
       back to Washington DC for testing.
    {Andy cries}
    A: I know, Andy, I know, I know, I know. It's what we call a real
       three hanky crime.
    Andy: Albert Rosenfeld. I don't like the way you talk smart about
          Sherrif Truman or anybody. You just shut your mouth! {Exits}
    C: Laura Palmer is dead. Jacques Renault is dead. Ronette
       Pulaski and Leo Johnson are in comas. Waldo the bird is dead.
       This leaves only the third man.
   -- Truman gives Pete a ride home. P: This smoke inhalation is nasty
      business. I feel like somebody taped my lips to the tailpipe
      of a bus.
      Josie left a note; she went to Seattle, she goes shopping every 3
      months. An Asian man calls, asking for her, then he makes a collect
      call to Hong Kong.
   -- Ben and Jerry meet with Hank. Hank confirms he put Catherine in the mill
      and they hope to frame the arson on her and Leo.
   -- Audrey meets with Blackie, she's not pleased with her not satisfying the
      owner

   Night
   -- Donna calls Norma about taking over Laura's Meals on Wheels route.
      She'll use the RR station wagon.
   -- At the Hayward Supper Club, Gersten plays the piano and Harriet
      recites a poem:
        "It was Laura
        And I saw her glowing.
        In the dark woods,
        I saw her smiling.

        We were crying
        And I saw her laughing.
        In our sadness,
        I saw her dancing.

        It was Laura
        Living in my dreams.

        It was Laura.
        The glow was life.
        Her smile was to say
        It was all right to cry.

        The woods was our sadness.
        The dance was her calling.
        It was Laura
        And she came to kiss me goodbye."
      Donna sits on her hands. Leland sings "Get Happy" and collapses.

   11:55 (Cooper to Diane)
   -- Cooper goes to bed. C to D: I'm dog tired. A man can only go long
    without submitting to a period of rest. As we know from experiments
    conducted on American GI's during the Korean War, sleep deprivation
    is a one way ticket to temporary psychosis. And I'm working on a
    3 day jag.
   -- Audrey prays for Cooper
   -- The Giant returns:
      G: "Sorry to wake you."
      C: "I'm not dreaming."
      G: "I forgot to tell you something."
      C: "You were right about the smiling bag."
      G: "The things I tell you will not be wrong. Better to listen then to
    talk."
      C: "I believe you."
      G: "Don't search for all the answers at once.  A path is formed by
    laying one stone at a time. One person saw the third man. Three have
    seen him, yes. But not his body. One only. Known to you. Ready now to
    talk. One more thing: you forgot something."
      C: "What?"
      { Flash of green gets zapped into Coop. He lies alone in the dark,
      blinking.  }
   -- Ronnette has a vision of Bob and Laura

   Morning
   -- Cooper talks to Albert about Tibet over breakfast:
      C: Buddhist tradition first came to the land of snow in the fifth
    century AD. The first Tibetan came to be touched by the Dharma was
    King Hathatha Rignamputsan. He and succeeding generations came to be
    collectively called the Happy Generations. Now some historians place
    them in the Water Snake Year, two-thirteen AD; others in the year
    of the water ox 173 AD. Amazing isn't it? The Happy Generations.
      A: Agent Cooper, I am thrilled to pieces that the Dharama came to King
    Hohoho, I really am, but right now I am trying hard to focus on the
    more immediate problems of our own century right in Twin Peaks.
      C: Albert, you'd be surprised at the connection between the two.
      A: Color me amazed.

   -- Andy tells Lucy he's sterile:
      Listen to me, Lucy Moran, you just listen.  When the Takoma
      Sperm Bank was looking for donors, naturally I applied.  It's my civic
      duty and I like whales.  A routine physical examination revealed that
      I'm sterile.  Sure I thought it meant I didn't have to take a
      bath, but the doctors told me the truth.  They told me I can't have
      babies.  So what I wanna know now is why are you having one and how?

      BRIGGS: I have a message for you.
      COOPER: From whom?
      BRIGGS: I'm not at liberty to reveal the nature of my work. This
    secrecy pains me from time to time. Any bureaucracy that
    functions in secret inevitably lends itself to corruption.
    But these rules I have pledged to uphold and I believe a
    pledge is sacred.
      Briggs shows Cooperthe message: /THE/OWLS/ARE/NOT/WHAT/THEY/SEEM/

	to because it's the only way to keep BOB away from me.  The

      has gone off and water is pouring over them all>
      Cooper: Call an ambulence! <Cooper kneels next to Leland and cradles
	Leland's head in his lap. For the rest of the scene he strokes
	Leland's hair and face, comforting him.>
      Leland: Oh God! Laura! I killed her. Oh my God, I killed my daughter.
	I didn't know. Forgive me. Oh God. I was just a boy. I saw him
	in my dream. He said he wanted to play. He opened me and I
	invited him and he came inside me. When he was inside, I
	didn't know. When he was gone, I couldn't remember. He made me
	do things. Terrible things. He said he wanted lives. He wanted
	others, others that they could use, like they used me.
      Cooper: Like Laura.
      Leland: They wanted her. But she was strong. She fought. She wouldn't
	let him in. Oh God. They had me kill that girl, Theresa. And
	they said if I didn't give them Laura, they'd have me kill
	her, too.
      Cooper: But she wouldn't let them in.
      Leland: They said she'd die before she'd let them. Then they made me
	kill her. Oh God, have mercy on me. What have I done? What
	have I done? Oh God. I love her. I love her with all my heart.
	My angel, forgive me.
      <Cooper looks to Albert, who shakes his head -- apparently Leland
      isn't going to live>
      Cooper: Leland. Leland, the time has come for you to seek the path.
	Your soul has set you face to face with the clear light and
	you are now about to experience it in its reality. Wherein all
	things are like the void and cloudless sky and the naked
	spotless intellect is like a transparent vacuum, without
	circumference or center. Leland, in this moment, know yourself
	and abide in that state. Look to the light, Leland. Find the
	light. 
      Leland: I see it.
      Cooper: Into the light, Leland. Into the light.
      Leland: I see... Her. She's there.
      Cooper: Into the light, Leland.
      Leland: She's beautiful.
      Cooper: Into the light.
      Leland: Laura?
      Cooper: Don't be afraid.
      <Leland dies. Wordlessly Cooper pushes his own hair back and looks up.
      The sprinklers shut off>

      offers to be friends.
   -- Cooper says goodbye to Truman, who gives him a green butt skunk hook
      and a Bookhouse Boy patch. He says goodbye to Hawk, Andy and Lucy,
      when Roger Hardy arrives with a mountie and tells Cooper he has been
      suspended from the FBI.
   -- Audrey gets Bobby in to see Ben, but gets kicked out. They go to
      get ice cream. B: Cup or cone? A: Mmmm...cone. I like to lick.
   -- Roger and the mountie question Cooper, who surrenders his gun and
      badge. They only knew of two deaths, and Cooper didn't know about
      Battis. Truman stands up for Cooper.

   -- Shelley brushes Leo's teeth. Bobby calls, Leo moves.

   -- Cooper and Briggs around a campfire:
      COOPER: At the time I did what I thought was right. I must now face
	the consequences.
      BRIGGS: You can do no more.
      (Cooper and Major Briggs, roasting marshmallows over a campfire.)
      COOPER: You know, Major, I find myself thinking a lot about BOB.
	If he truly exists.
      BRIGGS: Yes, I've pondered that same question continuously since this
	horror was revealed.
      COOPER:	I try to imagine him out there, incarnate, looking for
	another victim to inhabit.
      BRIGGS:	There are powerful forces of evil in the world. It is some
	men's fate to face great darkness. We each choose how to react.
	If the choice is fear, then we become vulnerable to darkness.
	There are ways to resist. You, sir, were blessed with certain
	gifts. In this respect, you are not alone. Have you ever heard
	of the White Lodge?
      COOPER: The White Lodge. No, I don't believe I have.
      (Briggs appears to ponder what he should say about this.)
      (Angle on the woods from the point of view of some unknown entity,
      moving through the woods.)
      COOPER:	Major, I'm going to take a moment here. I feel the call of
        nature. There's nothing quite like urinating out in the open air. I
	look forward to hearing more about this White Lodge.
	(Cooper moves off into the woods. Major Briggs laughs, gives
	the departing Cooper a "thumb's-up".)
	When I return. From my journey.
      (Lingering on Briggs, who looks off in the direction of Cooper's
      exit with a speculative expression. An owl hoots. Major Briggs looks
      up, alarmed.)
      (Cooper urinating in the woods. An owl hoots in the tree above him.
      Cooper watches the owl. Suddenly a brilliant white light appears
      behind him. Cooper turns toward the light.)
      (Angle on Briggs, bathed in blinding white light.)
      BRIGGS:	COOPER! COOPER!
      (A robed figure appears in the light, backlit. No features are visible.)
      (Cooper dashes through the woods to the camp site. The Major is gone.)
      COOPER: Major Briggs? MAJOR?
      (Cooper looks at the light. It seems to be receding into the woods.
      Cooper runs toward it. He reaches the top of a small hill and freezes,
      looking into the light. The light blinks out.)

	worlds.
      COOPER: Tell me more.
      HAWK: My people believe that the White Lodge is a place where the
	spirits that rule man and nature here reside.
      TRUMAN: Local legend. Goes way back.
      HAWK: There is also a legend of a place called the Black Lodge...
	the shadow-self of the White Lodge. The legend says that
	every spirit must pass through there on the way to perfection.
	There, you will meet your own shadow-self. My people call
	it "The Dweller on the Threshhold." 
      COOPER: "The Dweller on the Threshhold..."
      HAWK: But it is said, if you confront the Black Lodge with imperfect
	courage, it will utterly annihilate your soul.
   -- Dennis arrives. He and Cooper worked together in Oakland. An RCMP
      officer says he stole drugs.
   -- Nadine leg presses 600 lbs.
   -- Josie tells Harry about Eckhart. He took her off the streets in Hong Kong
      at 16 and taught her about life and business. She was afraid for her
      life when she met Andrew, a business aprtner. She says she believes
      Eckhart is responsible for Andrew's death. She escaped from the airport
      at Seattle.
   -- Roger has pie at the RR (story on Leland in his paper)

      over. Ben makes shadow figures.
   -- Cooper gets an envelope from Windom Earle. P to Q4.
      "Of course, you couldn't help but take note of my emphatically
      traditional opening. I must say, your responding move was nothing
      if not reflective of your predilection for the tidy and fastidious.
      See how my response to you begins to lead us towards a classical
      confrontation? But there's doubt in your mind: what are my true
      intentions? How will you answer this time? Hobgoblins, Dale...
      consistency...predictability, giving rise to patterns. We both
      know only too well how these patterns leave you vulnerable to
      attack. You with your wounds, I with mine, let me paint you a
      picture: my knights will skirmish, lanes of power and influence
      will open through my bishops and rooks, pawns will naturally
      be forfeit. I'm even prepared to sacrifice my queen because,
      I assure you, dear Dale, my goal will be attained at any cost;
      the king must die!"

Morning
  -- Bobby tries again to blackmail Ben, who's acting too weird for it to
     take. B: "You know what you need in this life? Balance, distance,
     symmetry." He's stacked his furniture. Eventually he hires Bobby to spy 
     on Hank; Bobby is thrilled.
  -- Cooper is discussing houses with a real estate agent (Irene).  A coin
     flip leads him to like Dead Dog Farm, an estate with a mysterious past
     where no one stays for long.
  -- Andy, Dick and Lucy visit with Nickie's case worker.  Nickie is an orphan
     who has been through many foster homes, and is the victim of "persistent
     random misfortune." Harry breaks up the meeting calling Andy to an
     emergency at the Great Northern.
  -- Harry, Doc Hayward and Andy investigate Dougie Milford, dead in his hotel
     bed.  Dwayne comes in and grieves, accusing the wife of murder by
     sex.  Andy doesn't cry.  "My Secret Life" by Chris Gerrity is found
     on the bed. 
  -- In the hallway, Hawk is talking/flirting with the widow. H: "When
     something big goes down, I'm the man."

10:10 (clock on wall)
  -- Nadine has joined the wrestling team and takes district champion Mike in
     one fall while asking him out.
  -- Mike complains to Donna about Nadine.
  -- James meets Malcolm Sloan - Evelyn Marsh's brother, Jeffrey Marsh's
     driver.  He says Marsh abuses Evelyn. Once a fortnight she breaks one
     of his things.
  -- At Dead Dog Farm, Cooper notices some tire tracks: "A Jeep, a four-
     wheeler and a luxury sedan." In the house he deduces a meeting took
     place in the past few hours. He finds baby laxative and cocaine dust.
  -- Dick fixes a flat (reading the instructions) while Nicky is irritating.
     While Nicky is not touching the car and facing the other way, the car
     falls off the jack.  Nicky panics and runs to hug Dick (who is unhurt).

Day
  -- Cooper comes to tell Harry about Dead Dog Farm, but instead visits
     with Air Force Colonel Reilly investigating Major Briggs.  Briggs is a
     great pilot.  "The owls are not what they seem" was broadcast from
     the woods, not deep space -- maybe from the White Lodge ("That's
     classified"). Cooper mentions seeing an owl before Briggs disappeared.
  -- James and Evelyn flirt and kiss.  James encourages her to leave her
     husband but she refuses.  When Jeffrey comes home she runs to greet him.
  -- Bobby, returning to Ben's office with photos, sees Audrey who flirts
     with him but doesn't kiss him.  Audrey goes to her secret listening place.
  -- Ben, who is working on a civil war model ("Gettysburg, day 1"), accepts
     the photos from Bobby and gives him a raise. Audrey eavesdrops.
  -- Pete and Catherine enjoy a romantic meal, served by Josie in a maid
     outfit.  Pete is bothered by Catherine's treatment of Josie, but is having
     too much fun to make an issue of it.
  -- Cooper brings Diane up to date:
     "Diane, I'm holding in my hand a nationally distributed newspaper. My
     opening move [P to Q4] responding to Windom Earle's opening move was
     printed in the personals column as per my instructions, but I have already
     received his response to this yesterday. He anticipated my response to
     his opening move perfectly. He's toying with me, Diane. I wonder where
     he is and what he's planning."
     Audrey knocks and offers Cooper Bobby's photos she has just stolen from
     her father's office.  Cooper identifies them as Hank, Ernie, Jean Renault
     and the mountie, meeting at Dead Dog Farm.  Denise comes in, and Audrey
     kisses Cooper on her way out.  Cooper briefs Denise.
     D: I may wear a dress but I still put on my panties one leg at a time,
        if you know what I mean.
     Cooper: Not really...

Night
  -- At the RR, Ed looks depressed, prompting Norma to suggest they can still
     be friends and to take his hand, all this secretly witnessed by Hank,
     sporting a 3:4 domino.
  -- Dick tells Andy he thinks Nicky is the devil.
  -- In Harry's office, Dwayne continues to accuse Lana of murder.  Doc says
     it was a natural heart attack.
  -- In the hallway, all the men watch Lana being escorted to a room. They
     begin collectively reciting Shakespeare.
  -- Lucy tries to call the sheriff to the phone, but gets no response.  She
     eventually finds all the men literally spellbound by Lana telling stories.
  -- Dennis visits Ernie at the RR. At the Great Northern, Cooper and Dennis
     interrogate Ernie.  They apparently want to let him off, using him to
     catch the big guys.  Dennis will pose as a buyer from Seattle and Ernie
     will arrange for a deal between Renault and Dennis.
  -- James hears Evelyn and Jeffrey fighting.  Malcolm tells James the first
     beating was four years ago. He swears to kill Jeffrey.
  -- Bobby goes home to find his mother sitting in the dark grieving over the
     Major's disappearance.  She flips on an owl lamp and Bobby tells his
     mother about the Major's vision. Suddenly the lights go out and the major
     materializes in the house, wearing a vintage pilot's outfit (leather
     jacket and goggles) and asking how long he's been gone.
     Betty: Is everything all right?
     Garland: No, dear...not exactly.

Morning
  -- Fade up on night time sky/field of stars.  Camera pans
     slowly to right.
        VOICE: (whispers) Cooperrr...                                 
     In the background, a chittering noise is heard. A yellow
     symbol consisting of three equilateral triangles overlapping
     slightly at their apexes (like the international radiation
     symbol) appears spinning in the center of the screen and
     rapidly moves towards the camera with a screaming noise.
     When it hits the camera, the screen erupts with flames.
        BRIGGS (V.O.): I remember stepping from the flames.  A
          vague shape in the dark.  Then nothing.
     Slow fade from flames to Major Garland Briggs.  He is
     seated on a throne of stone in the middle of a jungle.
     The camera moves slowly towards him.
        BRIGGS: 'Til I found myself standing by the cold
          remains of our campfire.  Two days later.
        HAYWARD (Distorted V.O.): Major, there are some new techniques
          that might help us break through your amnesia.
        BRIGGS: Well, my memories are immune from regression.
          I can feel them...
     A wolf begins to growl in the background.
        BRIGGS: ...they're palpable, the smells, the sensation.
          Everything is known to me, yet somehow beyond my reach.
        COOPER (distorted V.O.): Do you remember anything else?
        BRIGGS: Very little, save for one disturbing image
          of a giant owl, pervasive.
     The wolf continues to growl.
        COOPER (distorted V.O.): A giant owl?
     With a flash of light, we cut to a brief negative image of an owl flying,
     then to a close shot of the back of the Major's neck, where there is a
     small red scar identical to the 3-triangle symbol seen before.  Cut
     to Briggs face.  The flash is revealed to be from an Instamatic
     camera that Doc Hayward used to take a picture of the scar.  
     The camera slowly pulls back from Briggs.  The scene is the
     Sheriff's Station Conference Room, the time is apparently morning.
     Major Briggs, Agent Cooper, Doc Hayward and Sheriff Truman
     are present.
        COOPER: A giant owl? How big?
        BRIGGS: (fidgeting with his fingers) Enough to cloud my mind and memory.
        HAYWARD: (handing the instant picture he has just taken to Cooper)
          Three triangular scars behind the right
          ear, in perfect proportion.
        TRUMAN: Major Briggs...what exactly does your work involve?
        BRIGGS: That information...as I've repeated endlessly
          to myself...classified.  Though the keeping of
          secrets ... seems less meaningful to me now.
          (Pause.  The Major is nervous and shaken.)
          Perhaps there are sources of information that are
          so important as to transcend the human need
          to conspire.  Information of such weight that
          pertains not ... (Garland pauses.  He begins to
          lose control of his emotions.)  Oh, God!  Is
          this meant for the soul?!  My soul?
        COOPER: Major--perhaps you'd better start back at the beginning.
        BRIGGS: Are you familiar with...Project Bluebook?
        COOPER: Yes sir, I am.  The Air Force investigation into
          the phenomenon of Unidentified Flying Objects.
        BRIGGS: Officially disbanded in 1969.  But, there are those
          of us who ... continue in an _unofficial_ capacity.
          Examining the heavens as before...in the case of 
          Twin Peaks, the earth below.
     Cooper and Truman look at each other.
        BRIGGS: We are searching for a place called the White Lodge.
     Briggs stops talking as the door opens and two M.P.s step in.
        M.P. #1: Major Briggs?
        BRIGGS: I've been expecting you.
        TRUMAN: Now hold on just a minute, fellas.
        M.P. #1: Colonel Riley's orders.
        TRUMAN: I don't care what orders you got, this is my
          station and Major Briggs happens to be a friend of mine.
        BRIGGS: Harry (Briggs rises).   I'm afraid we will have to continue
          this discussion at a later date.
        TRUMAN: Are you sure you wanna to go with them?
        BRIGGS: (Nods) Yeah. (to Cooper) Goodbye.
        M.P. #1: Major.

     E: Ouch!  Will you mind the chest hair, will ya?
     H: You're sweatin' like a pig, Mr. Niles!
     E: Oh, thanks a lot!  That's nervous perspiration, man, hyperhydrosis.
        It's a childhood condition--and I didn't notice it 'til the war.  
        Korea, remember that?  Do ya?  I was leading a batallion up towards
        the 49th parallel.  We were just a bunch of fresh-faced kids.  I didn't
        know what kinda hell we were steppin' into.
     C: Ernie!  Ernie, I want you to focus on the here and now.  Repeat your
        instructions to me, step by step.
     E: Okay.  Uh...I take...Denise...up to Dead Dog Farm.  I introduce her to 
        Renault.
     C: Right.
     E: I, uh...take Renault through the buy...complete the transaction, and get
        the hell out of there, huh?
     C: Good.  Harry--that's when you come in. (Truman nods)  By golly...I sure
        wish I could join you fellas.  But I've temporarily lost my
        enforcement franchise.
     E: Heh, I bet.
     T: Well...I'v been givin' that some thought. (tosses badge to Cooper)
        Consider yourself deputized.  The bureau's loss is my gain.
     (Cooper looks at the badge--it's number 13.)
     C: (happily)  I hope I can live up to this.
     H: (finishes wiring Ernie)  He's done.  You might want to towel him off
        before we go! (wipes his hands, exits)
     E: Ah, come on!  (to Cooper and Truman)  Uh...how long will it, uh...
        take you guys to storm the farmhouse after, uh, I complete the buy?
     C: (pinning on his badge)  You go out, we come in.
     E: Can I, can I ask you a question?
     T: What, Ernie?
     E: Don't make me do this!  This isn't my line of work!  I'm a coward!  I
        don't do this kind of thing, I'm a CPA!
     T: Ernie.
     C: Ernie.
     E: (laughs nervously) Just a momentary lapse.  I'm okay, I'm...I'm cool. 
        Let's go do it, huh?
     C: Where's Denise?
     T: Haven't seen her.

      ponytail)
     D: (proudly)  You can call me Dennis!  Oh, I don't know, somehow it
        seemed...more appropriate.  (Cooper beams, absolutely delighted)

     D: Our investigation must proceed "sub rosa."  We may have to pick the
        lock.  Tricky business, that.  (Andy opens the unlocked door)  Voila!
        We enter!
     A: Where is everybody?
     D: Lunch!  Here we are, the case files.  N...N...N...(turns to another
        set of files) N!  Nales...Nester...Netherby...Needleman, Nicholas.
        Needleman, our little Nicky!
     A: We can read it in the car!
     D: Oh, patience, Andrew.
     A: (increasingly nervous) Dick!
     D: Sh!  The usual background information...mmm...birthplace...initial
        adoption...  mm-hmm!  First of several, it seems.
     A: Dick!
     D: (oblivious to Andy)  Ah, the plot thickens.  Where are thy secrets,
        little Nicky?
     (The Brewsters appear at the door, wave eagerly.  Andy sees them.)
     A: Dick!
     (The Brewsters enter.  Dick jumps up, startled, and clumsily hides
     Nicky's file in his trenchcoat.)
     B: Hi!
     (Andy, petrified, crosses and stands beside Dick.)
     B: We're the Brewsters.  (laughs)  I know we're a little early.  It's
        just that we're so darn eager to see him.  Can we see him?  Where's
        Donny?
     D: D--Uh, little Donny is...uh, dead.  (The Brewsters look horrified.) 
        Eh!  Dead tired, I mean.  I'm afraid little Donny, he isn't feeling up
        to snuff.
     B: Well, he was in perfect health only yesterday.
     (Dick is stumped.)
     A: Dick!
     D: Just a minute...*Woody*.  Let me finish helping these good people.
        Now--where were we?
 
Afternoon
  -- Ed answers the door to Donna who's looking for James. She'll deliver
     the money.
  -- Norma leaves and Nadine rescues Ed from Hank
  -- Bobby sees Ben, then Audrey. A: I think Daddy needs an injection.
  -- Catherine visits Ben
  -- James shows Evelyn the fixed car who seduces him as Malcolm watches
  -- At Dead Dog Farm, Ernie's shirt smokes, blowing the cover. Hawk calls
     for backup as Cooper exchanges himself for Ernie and Dennis.

Evening (1/4 moon)
  -- Evelyn leaves James in bed to go at it with Malcolm
  -- Jean, the mountie, and Cooper in the center room:
     C:  Is my death so important to you?
     R:  My two brothers die...I hold you responsible.
     C:  Why?
     R:  Well...before you came here...Twin Peak was a simple place.
         My brothers deal dope to the teenagers and the truckdrivers...
         oh...One Eyed Jack welcomed the businessman and the tourist...
         quiet people lived a quiet life.  Then--a pretty girl die,
         and you arrive...and everything change.  My brother Bernardo,
         shot, and left to die in the...the woods.  A grieving father
         smother my remaining brother with, ah...the pillow.
         Kidnaping...death...suddenly, ah, the quiet people...they're
         quiet no more.  Suddenly the...the simple dream, become the
         nightmare.  So.  If you die, maybe you will be the last to die.
         Maybe you brought, ah...the nightmare...with you.  And maybe...
         the nightmare will *die* with you.
  -- Dennis in a RR uniform, delivers food. Cooper shoots Jean with a 
     gun hidden in Dennis' panty hose and Dennis kicks the mountie's ass.
  -- Shelley wakes to intermittent power to find Leo
  -- Power's off at the station. Lucy says there were two fires and an
     explosion. Cooper finds a dead person pointing to a chessboard:

                       Cooper     

     T: So how does chess figure into all this?
     C: Because Windom Earle and I played a game every day for three years.
        He felt that all of life could be found in the patterns and conflicts
        on the board.  (pauses)  Because I never beat him.  (pauses)  Now it's
        my turn.  I'll publish my response in the Twin Peaks Gazette.  I don't
        know what else to do.
     T: Coop, you're gonna have to give me some more information here.
     C: Harry, I've brought some baggage to town I haven't told you about.
        (sits) Windom Earle was my first partner.  Everything I know about the
        law and the bureau, I owe to him.  Four years ago, we drew the
        assignment of protecting a material witness in a federal crime.  She
        was, uh...very beautiful...very gentle woman.  Her name was Caroline.
        She and I fell in love.  One night, I...failed in my vigilance.  An
        attack was made; I wasn't ready.  I was wounded and I lost
        consciousness.  (swallows hard)  When I came to, she was in my arms,
        she...she was dead, she'd been stabbed.
     T: The wounds on the vagrant.
     C: Identical.  The killer was never found.  My wound healed; Windom Earle
        went mad.  Institutionalized until his recent escape.
     T: So why is he after you?
     C: Harry--Caroline was Windom Earle's wife.
     (Truman has been sitting on the edge of his desk.  Now, he sits in his
     chair, taken aback.)
     T: So...he blames you for her death.
     C: (shakes his head, leans forward)  It's much worse than that.  I think
        he killed her.  And I think he committed the crime that she originally
        witnessed.  Harry-- Windom Earle's mind is like a diamond!  It's cold,
        and hard, and brilliant.  I think he feigned the insanity that sent
        him away, but at some point he lost the ability to distinguish between
        what's right and what's wrong.  You don't know what he's capable of,
        Harry...you don't know!
  -- Donna shows up at Wally's looking for James but finds Evelyn instead.
     Evelyn said he had done some work for her and then headed off to Mexico.
  -- Audrey ushers Jerry into Ben's office.  BEN: Jeb!  Dr. Jacoby is there.
     He says Ben's reversal of the South's fortunes is a healthy way for Ben
     to recover from his own defeat.
  -- Briggs staggers into the sheriff's office and collapses.  Lucy checks her
     lip stick.
  -- Briggs, Truman and Cooper at the station:
     (Briggs, Cooper, and Truman are all sucking down huge glasses of water.
      Lucy is standing nearby with a pitcher of water.)
     L: More?
     C: I'm fine.
     T: Fine, Lucy.
     B: Fine.
     (Lucy exits.)
     T: Major--what happened?
     B: Well, as men who have dedicated their lives to service, I know that
        you're able to understand how sacred I hold a pledge of allegiance.
        And the cost one must pay when breaking a pledge.
     C: It can be very great.
     B: Well, the Air Force, *I thought*, was not unlike other societies of
        men dedicated to the fight for the good.  (pauses, mops his brow)
        Gentlemen, frankly I'm worried.  When my superiors questioned me about
        my disappearance, they exhibited a degree of suspicion and intolerance
        bordering on the paranoic.  I must now admit that their motivation in
        the search for the White Lodge is not ideologically pure.  I believe
        that during my disappearance I was taken to the White Lodge.  I can 
        remember, virtually nothing.  But I have the clear, intuitive sense
        that there's...  much trouble ahead.
     C: Major?  What kind of trouble?
     B: I am unaware of the form it will take.  (pauses)  I will return.
        Until that time, I will be in the shadows if you need me.  Good day,
        gentlemen.
     C: Good day, Major.
     (the Major exits.)
     T: In the shadows.  Can you beat that?
     C: No...
  -- Jacoby, Lana (the widow Milford), Cooper, Truman, Hawk at the station
     (Cooper and Truman enter the meeting room after Hawk.  Jacoby and Lana
      are waiting there.)
     J: Good.  I wanted all of you to hear this.  I've just spent almost the
        last twenty-four hours with this charming young lady, and as you can
        see, uh...  I have no bruises, no broken bones...any claims by her
        deceased husband's brother that she's cursed or somehow responsible
        for a death is nonsense.  Now what she does, in fact, possess is a
        heightened sexual drive.  And a working knowledge of technique,
        anatomy, and touch, that few men have ever had the pleasure of
        experiencing, or the skills to match.
     T: Is it *hot* in here?
     C: Yeah.
     H: Yep.
     C: Lana, let me be the first to congratulate you.
     L: Thank you!  Well--I could never have done it without Dr. Jacoby.
     J: Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.  Okay.  Well, we're gonna go bowling.  See ya
        later, guys!
  -- Dwayne Milford is in the lobby with a shotgun, threatening to shoot Lana.
     Cooper suggests that the mayor and the widow go alone into the conference
     room to work it out.  Truman: Now what?  COOPER: We wait.
  -- COOPER: OK, long enough.  The cops enter the conference room to find the
     widow and the mayor making wedding plans.
  -- Catherine reveals Andrew Packard to Pete.

Dusk
  -- Eckhardt and a young female escort check into the Great Northern
  -- Truman shows Cooper a Seattle newspaper story -- Jonathan is dead.  Harry
     suspects Josie and asks Cooper to investigate.
  -- Doc Hayward tells Dick and Andy about Nicky's past.  His mother was an
     immigrant, maid at the Great Northern.  She was impregnated during a rape,
     died in child birth.  Nicky was in an orphanage, then adopted. 
     His adopted parents were killed in a car crash.  Lucy is indignant that
     the men had suspected Nicky of wrong-doing. She swats a fly.
 --  It comes down at the Marsh place.  Evelyn says Jeffrey died in a car
     crash, the brake lines were cut.  JAMES: You set me up!  Evelyn says she
     loves James, and hopes he gets away.  Police arrive.  James is sneaking
     away.  Donna is there in the shadows, and they run away together.

Night
 -- Leo walking through the woods.  Gratuitous owl shots.  There is a cabin
    with a light on. Leo walks in and meets Windom Earle.

   -- Evelyn and Malcolm tell the cops about James
   -- At Wallies, the cops watch an opera, while James and Donna talk

   -- Cooper and Truman question Josie
   -- Pete returns with a load of dry cleaning. Cooper takes a sample from
      a coat.
   -- Thomas calls Josie. Catherine listens.
   -- Ben continues on in the war. Johnny is present in his Indian headdress.
      Bobby trumpets.
   -- Evelyn and Donna trade words at Wallies until Malcolm comes for Evelyn
   -- Albert's report. The dead Asian man was Johnathan Kumagi. The fibers

Morning
   -- Cooper and Truman listen to Earle's tape. They decide to call Pete
      for Cooper's next move. Lucy: Paper and Pete - I'll do it alphabetically!
   -- Pete answers Lucy's call then serves breakfast to Catherine and Andrew.
      Josie enters, sees Andrew and faints.
   -- Truman reads the paper, an article on the Asian man's death
   -- Hank (on crutches) and Hawk in Truman's office. Truman accuses Hank of
      shooting Leo.  Hank says he was home with Norma then, and offers to deal
      info on Packard's death for freedom.  No deal.  Hawk kicks Hank's
      crutch out from under him.
   -- Albert's report reagrding the gun:
      A: This is the bullet we removed from you.  This is the one that was
         excavated from the dead man's skull.  Same bullets, same gun, same
	 killer.  Let's go get her.
      C: Albert, hold your horses.
      A: Coop--I appreciate any reluctance you might have for busting your
	 pal's old lady, but the woman ventilated you and left you for dead.
      C: (holds up his hand) Albert--I don't take it personally.  What about
	 the gloves, the powder tests?
      A: News at five.  All right, fine, you're not mad, but there's an
	 epidemic of multiple gunshot wounds following this chick around,
	 she is a menace.
      C: (nods) I'll talk to her.  Maybe she'll confess, turn herself in.
      A: Maybe she'll grow wings and join the circus. (leaves)
   -- Audrey working as concierge at the Great Northern.  Some hunk walks
      in; he claims to have seen Audrey years ago playing Heidi.  Audrey has
      mail -- a note containing a torn piece of paper with writing, and a
      note inviting her to "save the one you love" by attending "a gathering
      of angels" at the Roadhouse that night.
   -- Ed replaces some figurines on a shelf when Nadine returns from school
      early. She confesses to Ed her love for Mike.  NADINE: "It's time to
      call a spade a spade, Eddie: we're breaking up."
   -- Cooper pleads the truth from Josie. Catherine listens in.  COOPER: "I
      don't know what place Harry occupies in your heart, but I do know that
      you own his."  Josie is unresponsive.  After Cooper leaves, Catherine
      badgers Josie while oozing slime.  Catherine says Josie will have to
      see Eckhardt alone that night.  JOSIE: "He'll kill me."  Catherine
      casually exposes a gun in the book case which Josie grabs and fondles.
   -- Bobby, Ben, Jerry, Audrey and the hunk (old friend of Ben's, John
      Justice Wheeler aka Jack) plot business.  Ben reveals there is an
      endangered species on the mill/Ghostwood property: the pine weasel.
      B: I give you...the little pine weasel.  Found only in our tri-county
	 area...  it is nearly extinct.
      J: (happily) They're incredible roasted.
      Ben will use this fact to stop development until he is in the driver's
      seat.  BEN: "And then, I'm considering a run for the Senate."

1:16 (clock on wall)
   -- Earle the truck driver leaves the RR, leaving a note for Shelly. 
      Norma is on the phone with her sister (Andie), a nun who is
      coming to visit.  Shelly reads the note, identical to Audrey's.
      Ed comes in and proposes to Norma.
   -- Leo whittles under Earle's instruction
   -- Norma visits Hank in jail, asks for a divorce.  Hank promises to reform
      and asks for an alibi regarding Leo.  Norma refuses, although Hank
      swears he'll die if he goes back to prison.  HANK: "You're his whore." 
      NORMA: "I'd rather be his whore than your wife."
   -- Pete selects a move that will give Earle "sleepless nights" and not
      allow him to capture any pieces for 4-5 moves. It appears to be P to
      QN-3.  This is just about the only legal move in that corner of the
      board (to Cooper's right) that would prevent any immediate capture. 
      If the move had been P to QN-4, then the pawn would have been vulnerable
      to attack by the white king's bishop.  P to QR-4 would have been OK too,
      but it appears that Pete moved the pawn in the file of the queen's

      a positive ID of her in Seattle.
   -- Andrew visits Josie putting on makeup in her room.  He says he loved her
      though she didn't love him and she should go to Eckhardt who can
      get her out of the country.

Dusk
   -- James and Donna meet for a picnic in the mountains.  James is going to
      continue traveling around.  Donna will return to TP.  They will continue
      to love each other and meet again some day. Evelyn is going to stand
      trial.

Evening
   -- Truman comes to see Josie.  Catherine says she's gone to see Eckhardt.
   -- Eckhardt and Andrew meet in the elevator. Andrew says he is alive
      because Josie betrayed Eckhardt.  Something about Josie in love with
      Truman.  ECKHARDT: "I've already taken care of him."
   -- Ben, Audrey and Jack at supper.  Jack is in business of saving troubled
      businesses with environmental problems.  Ben is called away;
      attraction/repulsion/defensiveness between Audrey and Jack ensues.

9:30 pm
   -- Shelly, Audrey and Donna meet at the Roadhouse.  They put their three
      pieces of paper together. Earle watches from the bar.
      "See the mountains kiss high heaven
      And the waves clasp one another.
      No sister flower would be forgiven
      If it disdained its brother.
      And the sunlight clasps the earth,
      And the moonbeams kiss the sea.
      What is all this sweet work worth,
      If thou kiss not me?"
   -- Cooper practices fly fishing in his room.  Catherine calls to let him 
      know where Josie is. He grabs his gun and goes to investigate.  He hears
      a shot and opens Eckhardt's door.  Eckhardt stands up and dies.
      Josie and Cooper point guns at each other.
      J: He tried to kill me.
      C: Is that what you'll say about me, Josie--that I tried to kill you?
	 What about Jonathan?  Did he try to kill you, too?
      J: He...he was taking me back.
      C: Why did you shoot me, Josie?
      J: Because you came here.  I knew this day was going to come.  I'm not
	 going to jail!  I can't!
      (Harry enters, gun drawn)
      H: Put it down, Josie.
      J: Ah!  Harry?!
      H: PUT IT DOWN!!
      J: Harry--forgive me.  I never meant to hurt you. (takes several sharp
 	 breaths, closes her eyes, hugs the gun to her chest, and collapses on
	 the bed)
      H: (rushes to her, cradles her in his arms) Josie!  Josie?!  Josie!
         (looks up) She's dead.  
      (Harry and Josie on the bed disappear, spotlight appears.  BOB climbs
      onto the bed from the floor on the far side, laughing maniacally, until
      he is on his hands and knees on the bed)
      B: Coop!  What happened to Josie?! (continues to laugh)
      (BOB disappears, the little Man From Another Place appears, dances on
      the bed, and disappears.  Harry and Josie reappear as before.  Josie's
      face appears in the knob of the nightstand, crying out in torment)
