 In an attempt to revive their sex life, Peg (at Marcy's suggestion),
 lures Al to the Hop-On-Inn motel.  There they discover a couple of
 familiar faces on the adult video channel: Steve and Marcy.  When 
 Steve points out that Al and Peg must have been taped too, Al and
 Marcy want to break some legs, while Peg and Steve want to sue.
 In court, the details of the Bundys' sex life leave the jury so 
 unimpressed that they award them nothing, but Steve and Marcy's
 performance was worth $10,000.   [Note: this episode was never 
  broadcast as scheduled, because of numerous disagreements between
  the show's producers and the Fox network censors.  See Appendix V
  for more detailed information.]

 After Kelly's prank on the tap-dancing club, the principal dictates she 
 either join the club (of "geeks and dweebs") or leave school, which would
 leave her without a daily hot meal. Kelly must then do a Tap Dance recital,
 but she drops the idea at the last minute and does something slightly more 
 exciting (and erotic).  Also, Al gives the Bundy credo as: "When one Bundy
 is embarrassed, the rest of us feel better about ourselves."  We also find

 After asking the Bundys to watch their house while they're away,

 Sara V. Finney & Vida Spears

 After his friends both find dates, Bud is desperately seeking Susan-- 
 or any girl who'll date him -- while Al comes up with a million-dollar 
 invention that looks... desperate.  Al takes the battery and headlights

 The Bundys win a trip to England, courtesy of the village Lower Uncton,
 which can rid itself of a centuries-long curse by ridding the world of 
 male Bundys---and there are just two left.  Back in 1653, an ancestor 
 of Al's - Shamus McBundy, insulted a fat, ugly witch who then imposed 
 a curse on the village and all future male Bundys.  The Lower Uncton
 residents must kill the last male Bundys inside their city limits in 
 order to end the curse, while Upper Uncton people must insure they die
 outside the city so the curse does not get transferred to them.

                        APPENDIX V - THE LOST SHOW


 Here is a more detailed account of the events around the "missing" third 
 season episode: "I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT" (#310). [excerpted from Playboy]

 This episode is now called "The Lost Show" by the producers, since they
 feel they lost control of it, and subsequently it never aired as scheduled.
 The reason was the Fox network censors.  Producer Moye says they had 15 
 censor notes on the script, meaning 15 words or lines the censor considered
 "too graphic" or "over the edge" or "offensive to certain groups."  These 
 were the things they'd been hearing from the censor all along--at the rate
 of two or three a script--but 15 notes was a whole new game.

 "We were gonna play ball," says Moye. They made some changes and sent the 
 script back.  The censor was on the phone.  They made some more changes, 
 caught some more flak. "It got to the point where we had given them all 
 but four notes, which to us was bending double. We were really doing a 
 contortionist job."  Still, the censor wasn't happy.  By the end of the 
 week, they'd made 13 changes and "the integrity of the show was shot to 
 hell," says Moye. 

 The Lost Show is about sex.  It begins with Peg and neighbor Marcy 
 discussing ways to spice the Bundy's sex life.  How about a change of 
 venue?  Cut to the Hop-On-Inn motel.  See Al and Peg lean back in bed.
 Know they've done the wild--and as always with the Bundys, brief--thing.
 Later, we learn that Al and Peg were video-taped at the motel, as were 
 Steve and Marcy before them.  Cut to the courtroom, where Steve plays 
 prosecutor in the couples' lawsuit against the Hop-On-Inn.

 Unfortunately for the Bundys, Steve screens the video tapes in court. 
 Steve and Marcy win $10,000 for their multihour performance; Al and Peg's
 one-minute boogie is judged inconclusive.  Or, as the jury foreman says, 
 "No sex, no money."  The motel's lawyer doubts Peg's claim that in their 
 one filmed minute, she and Al had sex.  

 Says Peg: "All right, it may not be sex to you, but it is to me.  Just 
  because you have husbands who can last long enough to time an egg doesn't
  mean that what Al does doesn't count...  Is a crumb not a banquet for a 
  starving person?...  Is a fig leaf not clothing for the naked?"  

 Now Peg's off the witness stand.  She's being dragged back to her seat, and
 she's begging with every step: "You can't do this to Al!  He'll lose what 
 little confidence he has!  You were great, baby!  Please, oh, please, don't
 listen!  Don't give up!"  The courtroom clears.  Al and Peg are alone.  He 
 leads her behind the judge's bench...  The hands of the clock spin.  Then 
 we hear voices from behind the bench.

   Al:  "Now, was that sex, or was that sex?"  
   Peg: "That was SEX, Al", and she lights a cigarette and exhales 
         a cloud of smoke...

 As this episode ends, the camera slowly pans to show a closed-circuit 
 TV camera pointed directly behind the judge's bench...

                       APPENDIX VI - BUNDYISMS


    The Bundy credo:
      "When one Bundy is embarrassed, the rest of us feel better 
       about ourselves."   [From CAN'T DANCE, DON'T ASK ME (313)]


    Al Bundy's xmas story:  
      Twas the night before christmas, and all through the house,
       no food was a stirring, not even a mouse.  
      Stockings were hung 'round dad's neck like a tie, 
       along with a note that said "presents or die".  
      Children were plotting all night in their beds, 
       while the wife's constant whining was splitting his head.
      But daddy had money this year in the bank, 
       then they closed up early, now dad's in the tank. 
  
       ...and all of a sudden Santa appeared, 
       a sneer on his face, booze in his beard. 
      Santa I said as he laughed merrily, 
       you do so much for others do something for me.  
      Bundy he said, you only sell shoes, 
       your son is a sneak-thief, your daughters' a flooze.  
      Ho Ho Santa said, should I mention your wife, 
       her hairs like an a-bomb, her nails like a knife.
      As he climbs up the chimney, that fat piece of dung, 
       he mooned me two times, he stuck out his tongue.  
      And I heard him exclaim, as he broke wind with glee: 
       you're married with children, you'll never be free.
        [From IT'S A BUNDYFUL LIFE (part 1) (412)]


    Al pays the bills:
      Oh man we're broke, cha cha cha
      Everybody flat broke, cha cha cha
      Living in the gutter, cha cha cha
      Early grave, cha cha cha
      Alright now, everybody - shoot me!
        [From RAINGIRL (419)] 


    "I Care" by Al Bundy:
      When hooters jiggle around, 
       and I find nickels on the ground, I care.
      When a mustang engine purrs, 
       and the bathroom is not hers, I care.
      When the pitcher's on the mound, 
       and the wife is underground, I care.
      But when I've been playing this for days, 
       I will kill anyone who stays, I swear!

    To which Peggy adds:
      ...and if you really want a scare,
       check out his underwear, if you dare.
        [From MYSTERY OF SKULL ISLAND (614)] 


    "A man is a man all of his life, but a woman is only sexy 'til 
      she becomes your wife"  [Al Bundy, from RITES OF PASSAGE (616)]

    "At the Nudie Bar":
      Where the music stinks, and they water the drinks, the nudie bar.
      Where the girlies dance in their underpants, the nudie bar.
      Where you see their butt, and their trap stays shut, 
       at the nudie bar.

      Where you can't touch a breast, but you can cave in a chest,
       at the nudie bar.
      Where you look at a thigh, and blacken an eye, at the nudie bar.
      Where the beer gives you gas, but the Bundys kick ass, 
       ...at the nudie bar.  [From RITES OF PASSAGE (616)]


    "Psycho Dad" theme song:
      Who's that...<mumbled>    
      Who's the man with the itchy gun.  
      Who's the man who kills for fun!  
      Psycho Dad.  Psycho Dad.  Psycho Dad!   
      He sleeps with a gun, but he loves his son.  
      Killed his wife 'cause she weighed a ton... Psycho Dad!
        [From AL... WITH KELLY (501)]


    "Psycho Dad" new theme song:
      A little touched or so we're told 
      Killed his wife 'cause she had a cold
      Might as well, she was gettin' old
      Psy-cho Dad, Psycho Dad, Psycho Dad
      He's quick with a gun, and his job ain't done
      Killed his wife by twenty-one, he's Psy-cho Dad!

    "Psycho Mom" theme song:
      Who's the gal who needs no man?
      Killed him dead with the frying pan
      Did it 'cause he missed the can
      Psycho Mom, Psycho Mom, she's Psy-cho Mom!
        [From TEACHER PETS (621)] 


    "Old Aid" song:
      We are the old, we've got arthritis
      Our gums are weak (so weak), from gingivitis

      We are the old, we've got arthritis
      We are the ones who wear bifocals, and have bursitis

      There are people younger, but we heed another call
      We really need the money, our accountants took it all
      We sing to you, those who have money
      Once we was cool, but now we just dress funny
      We need your help, so please please dig deep
      Don't call after ten, 'cause we'll be asleep
      We have medicare, and anti-gas pills
      But without your help, we can't pay our alimony bills

      We are the old,   [they are the old]
      We have arthritis   [they have arthritis]
      Once we were gods, now golf excites us   [golf excites 'em]
      So write a check (a really big one), for our december
      There's one more verse, but we can't remember...
        [From ROCK OF AGES (709)]

    Marcy's song for Santa-Al:
      Bundy the no-man, 
       he's as bald as he can be.  
      With the hair in his nose and rot on his toes, 
       he's as bald as he can be.
      Bundy the no-man, 
       he's as bald as he can be.  
      He's into old age, 
       making minimum wage, 
       he's as bald as he can be...
        [From CHRISTMAS (712)] 


    The Bundy credo:
      Lie when your wife is waking
      Lie when your belly's aching
      Lie when you know she's faking
      Lie, sell shoes, and lie.

      Hooters, hooters, yum yum yum
      Hooters, hooters, on a girl that's dumb.
        [From THE WEDDING REPERCUSSIONS (725)]

  MWC producers/creators Leavitt and Moye have each made appearances in
  episodes, and several members of Leavitt's family have also appeared.
  Writers Larry Jacobson and Sandy Sprung were each in an episode as well.

  Christina Applegate seems to have had some of the most visible success 
  of the MWC cast, outside of the series.  She has had the leading role 
  in two motion pictures: "Streets", made in 1990, and "Don't Tell Mom 
  the Babysitter's Dead", in 1991.  Immediately prior to working on MWC,
  Christina was a regular on the ABC police drama "Heart of the City".
  Her character was 14-year old Robin Kennedy, daughter of the series'
  star, a police detective played by Robert Desiderio.  This show debuted
  in September 1986, and lasted less than a season.

  MWC staff members Kevin Curran and Larry Jacobson were both previously 
  employed as writers for Late Night with David Letterman.  Jacobson
  appeared in many comedy bits on Dave's show, and he has followed this
  up by appearing several times on MWC.

  NOW Comics has a series of comic books based on Married With Children
  which started back in 1990.  To date there have been over 20 issues.

  Married With Children is produced by Columbia Pictures Television, 
  and the show is taped on Friday nights at the following location:
    Sunset-Gower Studios
    1438 N. Gower Street
    Los Angeles, CA  90028

  Syndication notes:

  Four episodes that originally aired on the Fox network were omitted
  from the 1991 syndication package.  All of these were excellent and 
  very funny shows, and all of them dealt with SEX...

   #301 and 313 were finally released for syndication in May 1992,
   and #306 in October 1992.]

 Spinoff:

 In the spring of 1991, Fox started a new series called "Top of the Heap", 
 based on two characters they introduced first in the Married With Children
 episode: "OLDIES BUT YOUNG'UNS" (518).  The series was about Vinnie 
 Verducci (Matt Le Blanc) and his father, Charlie (Joseph Blogna).  Other 
 cast members included Joey Adams as jail-bait neighbor Mona who is always 
 chasing Vinnie, and Rita Moreno, as Vinnie's boss.  It should be noted that
 Vinnie is a reasonable approximation of what a male Kelly Bundy would be: 
 handsome and incredibly stupid.  Charlie is similar to Al, in that life 
 has not treated him well, but where Al struggles to get by, Charlie is a 
 constant schemer.

 The pilot episode of "Top of the Heap" was shown as the second half of a
 special one-hour Married With Children episode.  The first part was the 
 show "KIDS! WADAYA GONNA DO" (519), in which neither Vinnie nor Charlie 
 makes an appearance.  The second half-hour is the "Heap" pilot, and had 
 no connection at all to the "KIDS!" story.  Al Bundy makes an appearance
 in a scene where Vinnie and Charlie stop by Gary's Shoes to talk to him.
 Al, it turns out, had bet on Vinnie's boxing match the night before and 
 lost his T.V. as a result.  At the end of the episode, while Vinnie and 
 Charlie sleep, a masked figure enters the Verducci apartment through the
 window.  The mask is lifted to reveal Al, who steals the Verducci's TV.
 Subsequent episodes would feature cameo appearances by MWC characters 
 Kelly and Bud Bundy.  The series was canceled after only a few months.

 The Vinnie Verducci character was later reprised for a short appearance
 in the MWC episode "KELLY DOES HOLLYWOOD (part 1)" (609).

 In June 1992, Fox once again tried to reprise the Vinnie character in 
 the short-lived series "Vinnie and Bobby".  MWC co-creator Ron Leavitt
 was partially responsible.
