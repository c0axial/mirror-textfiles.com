Negative Cost: $31 million
  This biopic headlines Downey as Charlie Chaplin.   This story of his
life begins with his impoverished youth in London, continues with his
major achievements during Hollywood's Golden Age, his fears concerning
"talkies", his conflicts with J. Edgar Hoover, his exile from America
and his brief, triumphant return to accept his special Academy Award.
Downey will age from 19 to 83 in the process.   Aykroyd plays Mack
Sennett (of Keystone Kops fame), Geraldine Chaplin plays her real
grandmother, Hannah Chaplin.  Jovovich (RETURN TO THE BLUE LAGOON) is
Mildred Harris, Chaplin's child actress first wife.  Kelly (THE
CUTTING EDGE, THE BOY WHO CRIED BITCH) is Oona Chaplin, his last and
dearest wife.  Kline works with Attenborough for the second time (CRY
FREEDOM), this time as Douglas Fairbanks Sr.  Lane (COTTON CLUB, A
LITTLE ROMANCE) is Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's third wife and one of
the biggest stars of the 40's.   Miller (AWAKENINGS, OTHER PEOPLE'S
MONEY) is Edna Purviance, the Nevada secretary who became Chaplin's
first leading lady. Rhys (Royal Shakespeare Co., VINCENT AND THEO) is
Chaplin's elder half-brother Sydney who became Charlie's business
manager after abandoning his own acting career.  Tomei (OSCAR, MY
COUSIN VINNY) plays early silent screen star Mabel Normand and Travis
(AIR AMERICA, THREE MEN AND...) is would-be actress Joan Barry, who
almost destroyed Chaplin.   Formerly titled CHARLIE.  Film runs 144
minutes.   Truly outstanding word on Downey's performance.   Opened
December 17th at London's flagship Odeon Leicester Square and December
25th in New York, Los Angeles and Toronto.
