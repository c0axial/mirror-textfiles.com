OTHELLO							February 21 (NY)
Dir: Orson Welles
Cast: Orson Welles
  New York's Cinema II gets the honor of first presenting the restored film
of Orson Welle's rendition of Shakespeare's Othello.   Having been shown at the
Cannes Film Festival in 1952 and winning the Palm D'Or there, it then virtually
vanished from view.   Welles shot this film over a period of four years during
which he took breaks to do other projects and earn financing for this pet dream
film.  It actually was picked up for release by United Artists and opened on
9/12/55 at the Pathe Paris in Manhattan.  (That house is now the Loew's Fine
Arts).   Reviews were mixed and patrons were caught up in the frenzy of the
Cinemascope years.  It quickly disappered from sight.   The nitrate negative
was discovered in a New Jersey warehouse, where it was restored frame-by-frame
over a ten-month period.   The faulty soundtrack was restored with a new
digital stereo surround track and the film is now back to the original 91
minute director's cut.  Go see it.

D.P.: Michael Ballhaus
Start Date: 3/92, Upstate New York, Paris
  This $30+ million project was put into turnaround at Fox and has found a home

It is based on Edith Wharton's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Lewis stars in 
THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS for Fox and Pfeiffer can be seen meowing in BATMAN 
RETURNS for Warner Brothers and LOVE FIELD for Orion.   Production Designer is
Dante Ferretti (THE NAME OF THE ROSE), editor is Thelma Schoonmaker (who
else?), who edited CAPE FEAR, GOODFELLAS, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST and
RAGING BULL, for which she was Oscared.   This is one of only two pictures that
Scorsese is permitted to make outside his six-year exclusive deal at Universal.

Start Date: 6/18/90, halted 6/25/90, resumed 10/3/90, L.A., Novato, Sonora, CA.
Negative Cost: $31 million.
  Infamous production from first-time scripter Evans, whose initial
deal included big bucks and directing chores.  Production shuttered
after it became apparent he couldn't direct.  Rosanna Arquette was
paid off on her play-or-pay contract.  Donner brought in...rewrites
done.  Evans gets an exec producer credit. This story is of two brothers who
build a kind of flying machine to escape their abusive lives.  Now we'll see 
if a red wagon can fly!  Visual flying effects from Zoran Perisic's 
Oscar-winning Zoptic system used so effectively in SUPERMAN.  Additional 
Visual Effects from Apogee Productions. From Stonebridge Entertainment.  
Postponed from July 12 due to being behind schedule.  Promotional partners 
Dairy Queen and Kraft Marshmallows were very upset.  Columbia reimbursed DQ
some $2 million for expenses on the aborted promotion.   Original $15 million
budget shot to hell.   After languishing with a "Fall" release date, Columbia 
has decided on President's Day weekend 1992.  Yet another ending has been 
shot for this project (making about 19!) in the winter.   Advanced word is 
excellent.  Word is that there may not be any 70mm blowups after all.

THREE RIVERS						1993
Dir: Rowdy Herrington
Cast: Bruce Willis
Screenplay: Rowdy Herrington
Start Date: Spring '92
Negative Cost: $30+ million
  The biggest suspense with this long-in-the-works action film is how much is
Columbia paying Willis to star?   He signed for $13 million a couple of years
ago, but that was pre-BONFIRE and HUDSON.   With his fortunes again on the
rise, post-BOY SCOUT, how much of a cut will Willis take, if any?   Columbia

THE GOOD SON						1993
Dir: TBA
Cast: Macauley Culkin
Producer: Larry Mark
Screenplay: Ian McEwan
Start Date: late 1992, New England
  Production has been delayed a year as Macauley Culkin has been signed to play
the "bad seed" and he's tied up with HOME ALONE 2.   This film takes place in a
wintry environment so it will now be a 1993 release, rather than Fall 1992. 
Michael Lehmann of HEATHERS and HUDSON HAWK infamy was signed as director.  He
didn't think Culkin was old enough to play the character.   He was considering
two other boys for the part, but Fox inked Culkin instead and delayed the
picture.   Lehmann will not direct.  Mary Steenburgen's participation is up 
in the air, too.   Culkin will get somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.5-$2 
million.

children under 16 to see without their parents.

BLADE RUNNER	    2.35		     70mm	Fall		
Rating: "R" For violence.		       
Dir: Ridley Scott				      
Cast: Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Joanna Cassidy, Daryl Hannah,
Edward James Olmos
  Warner Brothers very successfully tested a 35mm reduction print of the 70mm
workprint that was previewed before the original 1982 theatrical release of
BLADE RUNNER.  Lack of narration, lack of upbeat ending and different cuts make
for superior film than the originally released product.  Scott will complete
that version for theatrical exposure in 1992, then home video.   WB is
apparently treating this as a new film for the reissue, which may be a mistake. 
Film has been postponed from 2/14/92 to a date TBA.   May be as late as the

UNTIL THE END OF THE WORLD     2.35	     		January 17 (wider)

Dir: Wim Wenders
Cast: William Hurt, Solveig Dommartin, Max von Sydow, Jeanne Moreau, Rudiger
Vogler, Sam Neill, Ernie Dingo, David Gulpilil, Lois Chiles, Allen Garfield
Producers: Jonathan Taplin, Anatole Dauman
Screenplay: Wim Wenders, Peter Carey
D.P.: Robby Muller
Start Date: 4/20/90, Venice Italy, France, Portugal, U.S., Japan, Australia,
Germany, USSR, China, Mali
Negative Cost: $26 million
  A huge-scale science fiction romance/road story filmed around the 
world in nine countries by Berlin's great Wim Wenders.  This futuristic (set 
in 1999) thriller concerns a man's efforts to retrieve a valuable invention 
(a device to permit blind people to see recorded images) and a woman's pursuit
of the mysterious man she loves.   Moreau plays Hurt's blind mother, Von Sydow 
is his father. Production was to have been in 65mm, but the demanding location 
requirements resulted in a 35mm production.  Title song is by the Irish group 
U2.  Other acts on the soundtrack include Neneh Cherry, Lou Reed, R.E.M., Patti
Smith, Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson. Early notices are quite positive 
on some aspects, but mixed on others.   Film ran a epic 178 minutes and 
apparently seems somewhat truncated at that length.  Wenders cut 21 minutes 
from the film for the American release.  Wenders also has a five-hour cut 
that he would like to make the film festival rounds and on home video.  
Opened in Germany to mixed business in September 1991.  Reviews in Berlin were 
dreadful, they loved it in Munich.   Opened on Christmas, 1991 in New York, Los
Angeles and Toronto.
