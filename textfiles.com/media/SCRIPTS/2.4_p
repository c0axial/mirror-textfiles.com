Scene 1. Police Station.
------------------------

Policeman:    And you've no objection to taking part in an identity parade?
Richie:       Oh, absolutely none whatsoever. Social responsibility is our
              byword. Er -- do we get the eight quid now or later on?
Eddie:        Oh yes, we love public service. We were just on our way to
              give blood, weren't we?
Richie:       Oh, that's right.
Eddie:        I get six quid a bottle, you know, 'cause mine's very rare.
              It's ninety percent proof.
Richie:       Pretty swarthy-looking bunch you've got here, Sarge! Which
              one's the criminal?
Policeman:    These are just the other volunteers, sir.
Richie:       [pointing]  That one!  What? Oh er, oh yeah, that's right,
              yeah.
Policeman:    Right then gentlemen, if you'd like to form a line we'll
              bring the suspect in.
Richie:       Right, and then we all fall on him and give him a good
              kicking, do we?
Policeman:    No sir, we have to let the witness identify him.
Richie:       What? Oh, oh yeah, that's right, that's right. Good policing,
              good. Right, come on , form a line everybody, form a line.

[A man enters escorted by several policeman.]

Richie:       Oh dear, whoops-a-daisy, here, he comes, dear oh dear oh
              dear. Look at that Neanderthal gait! Probably only learned to
              walk upright this morning. Hanging's too good for you,
              buster! Huh, I'm surprised he manages to mug old ladies with
              his knuckles scraping along the pavement like that!  [gorilla
              impression]  Ooh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-hello, hello, b-b-
              bll-b-b-bll-ll, me respectable citizen! Ugh, it's making my
              flesh creep, you vile scum!
Man:          Do you mind?
Richie:       Ooh, it talks! It talks! What are you gonna do next, go on a
              quest for fire?
Man:          Good afternoon everyone, I am Chief Inspector Grobbelaar.
Richie:       [gorilla voice]  Oh, I'm Chief Inspector Grob-- Oh.
Grobbelaar:   Now the suspects we are bringing in are highly dangerous so I
              don't want any of you lot fraternising with them too closely,
              okay?
Eddie:        Oh look, it's Spudgun! Ooh, and little Dave Hedgehog! Hello
              boys!
Spudgun & Hedgehog:
              Hi Eddie!
Eddie:        And what are you doing here?
Hedgehog:     We don't know. This bomb went off two hundred miles away and
              they suddenly come round and arrested us.
Spudgun:      I hope we're not I.R.A.
Hedgehog:     Ah, well it is a highly secretive organisation. We wouldn't
              know if we were.
Eddie:        Oh look, even if you were you'd be all right. You'd probably
              just get seventeen years in jail and then you'd suddenly get
              out scot free.
Spudgun:      If I go down I'm taking one of them with me.
Eddie:        Yeah? Why's that?
Spudgun:      'S just the way I fall.

[A shrill woman is led in.]

Woman:        That's him,  that's the one! Vicious little bastard! Ooh, me
              blood runs cold.
Spudgun:      'Ello Mum.
Mrs. Potato:  Send him down, electrocute him! Bring back the guillotine!
Spudgun:      I told you Ma, I promised I'd tidy my room tomorrow.
Mrs. Potato:  Where's my handbag, you thieving little bastard?
Spudgun:      What d'you know about my father?
Mrs. Potato:  Absolutely nothing.
Spudgun:      Just as I suspected.
Grobbelaar:   Shall we concentrate on the bag?
Eddie:        Well, it's a bit hard to concentrate on anything else, isn't
              it?
Grobbelaar:   Do you recognise any of these men?
Mrs. Potato:  I know all of them.
All:          Hi Mrs. Potato! Hello!  [etc.]
Grobbelaar:   No no, I mean who took the bag?
Mrs. Potato:  [pointing at Spudgun]  He did!
Spudgun:      I told you Mum, it was a cross-dressing party.
Grobbelaar:   Let me get this straight, you're accusing your son of
              borrowing your handbag.
Mrs. Potato:  That's right. Heinous villain!
Grobbelaar:   All right Jenkins, take her round the back and give her a
              good drubbing.
Mrs. Potato:  Oh shit.


Scene 2. The Pub.
-----------------

[Dogs bark outside as Richie and Eddie enter.]

Richie:       Eight bloody quid each, Eddie! You see, that's what you get
              for being a responsible citizen.

[Richie walks up to the bar and notices the new barmaid.]

Richie:       Oh, hello.
Barmaid:      Hello.
Richie:       You're new here, aren't you?
Barmaid:      That's right.
Richie:       Oh, good. In that case, er, hello, we're from the Health and
              Safety Inspectorate. And we'd like to examine two half-pints
              of best bitter and a couple of Cornish pasties please.
Spudgun:      Hey, Eddie! He he hey!
Eddie:        See they've got a bit of new staff on.
Spudgun:      Yeah, it's great isn't it?
Mrs. Potato:  Yeah, it's great isn't it! Means we don't have to spend any
              of the money we made on the line-up this morning. Now
              remember lads, don't get too sloshed. We got another one in
              Paddington this afternoon, right?
Hedgehog:     What's the crime this time, Mrs. Potato?
Mrs. Potato:  Flashing. And make it convincing.
Spudgun:      Yeah, good on you Mum. Do you want another drink?
Mrs. Potato:  Same again please love.
Spudgun:      Right. Another three bottles of brandy please dear!
Hedgehog:     Yeah, and I'm still not sure about this lager of yours, I'd
              better test another eight pints.
Barmaid:      There's a lot of you in from the Government today, isn't
              there?
Richie:       That's right my dear.  [leers at her]  And may I say how
              attractive you look in that short summer frock. It's quite
              lovely isn't it? Tell me, do you use Timotei? I'm sure that
              with beautiful hair like that you probably have to pop up a
              mountain, don't you, and find a stream and dip it in and
              flick it about the place. Are you a Page Three girl? 'Cause
              I'm sure if you wanted to, you could be.
Eddie:        Yeah, go on, take your top off and we'll give you an honest
              opinion.
Richie:       Shut up Eddie!  [elbows him in the groin]  You know, ha ha ha
              ha ha, it's funny but, in the short time I've known you I've
              fallen completely head-over-heels in love with you.
Barmaid:      What? That's ridiculous.
Richie:       I know, it's mad, it's crazy, but hear me out. Ever since,
              ah, I was wounded leading the charge at Goose Green in the
              Falklands conflict...

[The man sitting drinking at the end of the bar hears this and sits up,
interested.]

Richie:       ...I haven't been able to make love properly. No. And I was
              wondering that, seeing as you're a barmaid, you know, and we
              all know what you barmaids get up to, I was wondering if you
              could see your way clear to, you know...
Barmaid:      What, having you bunged out?
Richie:       Well, I've never actually been "bunged out" before but, boy,
              I'm game for anything!
Veteran:      What, was you in the Falklands then?
Richie:       Yes I was. Do you mind shutting up, I'm on the brink of
              shagging this barmaid! Tell me my dear, have you ever read
              The Joy of Sex?
Barmaid:      Ah, no, I don't read things like that.
Richie:       Oh well that's okay, we can just look at the pictures.
Veteran:      When was you out there then?
Richie:       During the conflict, when do you think? I didn't go there for
              my holidays!
Veteran:      Oh. So you're a veteran then?
Richie:       No I was not! What are you suggesting? I was in the thick of
              it. Someone else looked after the ponies.

[Tight-mouth Larry wanders in, completely drunk, singing and having trouble
staying upright.]

Larry:        Well you can tell by the way I use my walk,
                    I'm a woman's man, no time to talk,
                        Night Fever, Night Fever...
[He crashes to the floor.]

Richie:       That's Tight-mouth Larry, the book-maker!

[Larry throws up.]

Eddie:        He's not very tight-mouthed today, is he?
Richie:       [to the barmaid]  And now my dear, as regards...
Veteran:      When was you there then?
Richie:       Look, are you a professional bore or is this some sort of
              hobby?
Veteran:      'Cause I was in the Falklands too.
Richie:       Oh really, yes, I bet you were, yes, chap like you, yes, back
              in the Falklands, huh! Got any proof?
Veteran:      Well... got me service medal, yeah.

[Richie is taken aback, speechless with shock.]

Veteran:      You all right mate?
Richie:       Ha, ha, oooh yees, yes, yes, hahaha. I always get like this
              when I meet one of the old compadres. So... shit... great...
              You were there too, were you?
Veteran:      Yeah, I was in Two Para.
Richie:       What, you went twice?
Veteran:      What regiment was you in then?
Richie:       Well the English one of course! What are you suggesting?
Veteran:      No, what outfit was you in?
Richie:       Well, the green patchy one most of the time. With the twigs
              and the bit of leaf, you know, camouflage. I mean, ah, some
              of the chaps had their busbies on but, hur-hur, not many of
              them came back. No, I just remember looking down my rifle-
              sights at hordes of screaming Argies, all going "Nein nein,
              ve surrender Tommy-schweinhund!"

[Larry struggles to his feet.]

Larry:        Nah, nah, I tell you, I'm perfectly all right!

[He falls over again, banging his chin on the bar.]

Richie:       Yeah... So, ah, how did you get on?
Veteran:      Well...

[The veteran slaps his right leg twice, producing a hollow wooden sound.]

Richie:       Well...  [slaps his own leg twice]  What?
Veteran:      Well I lost me leg!
Richie:       Oh, oh, oh I see, oh. Oh oh, oh dear. Erm, how sad.  [pulls a
              face at Eddie]
Eddie:        No, look, there it is, there!
Richie:       Oh look, Eddie's found it for you! Look, there it is, right
              underneath your bottom! Ya, you silly banana, you should keep
              your eyes peeled! Hah, old commando like you should be able
              to keep track of his legs!
Veteran:      Nah, no no, this is me falsie!  [pulls up his trouser-leg]
              Look at that. Two and a half grand that cost me. Hand carved
              by naked Balinese maidens.
Eddie:        How d'you know they were naked?
Veteran:      'Cause I watched 'em do it.
Richie & Eddie:
              Hwooorgh!
Veteran:      That's why it cost so much.
Richie:       Two and a half thousand pounds, eh?

[Richie and Eddie go into a little huddle, thinking about this.]

Both:         No, we can't, we can't...
Richie:       Well, ah...  [long pause]  Ha ha ha!  It's great when we old
              war-horses get together, isn't it? Ha!
Veteran:      [to Eddie]  What, was you there as well?
Eddie:        Ah, oh, oh...  [Richie nods]  Yes.
Veteran:      Oh, what outfit?
Eddie:        Oh, I was in a little grey off-the-shoulder slinky number
              with the sequins, you know, and the split up the side... Oh,
              ha-haa, only joking! I was in Intelligence. They dropped me
              behind enemy lines. Quite a long way behind enemy lines. It
              was Guildford actually.
Spudgun:      What, by parachute?
Eddie:        No, they just dropped me. From the Army, you know. Fired.
              Flat feet.
Veteran:      Did you have to yomp from Goose Green to Stroud Hill?
Richie:       Well of course I did mate, we all had to do that didn't we?
              Well, there were no lavs. It was the open countryside. Yeah,
              haha, had to watch where you put your feet in them days. Ha-
              ha!  [makes squelching noise]  Hahahaha... must have been a
              bitch for you squatting on the one leg!
Veteran:      Yeah, but did you go to Stroud Hill?
Richie:       Well of course I did! We were all there, me and all me mates.
              There was me and, er, Ginger, er, Tommy, er... Tiddles, er,
              Spot, er, Joey, Snowy and, erm... Gorky.
Veteran:      There isn't a Stroud Hill in the Falklands.
Richie:       [long pause]  O-o-o-o-ooh, you were one of the ones that
              didn't find it, eh? Hah, oh, we had a good laugh about you!

[Larry has another go at standing up.]

Larry:        Right, well, here I am then!  [wobbles]  Oh, no I'm not.
              [crashes down again]
Eddie:        So, ah, what did you do then?
Veteran:      Well, I'd rather not talk about it.
Eddie:        Why, is it embarrassing? Shit your pants, did you? Cry, did
              you, eh?
Veteran:      Quite the opposite, actually.
Eddie:        What, you sucked water in through your eyes?
Veteran:      No. I took Harrison's Point single-handed.
Richie:       Oooh. Thhh. That can be nasty. I shut Tucker's finger in the
              tank door, didn't I Eddie?
Eddie:        I don't know, this is all a load of bollocks.
Richie:       Shush, shush, sh-sh-sh-shush! You'll have to, ah, excuse
              Eddie, his mind's just blanked it out.
Veteran:      What, 'cause it's so horrible?
Richie:       No, he's just got that sort of mind. Oh well, must mingle.
              Charmed!

[Richie hurries away.]

Veteran:      Yeah, that's where I got the G.C.
Eddie:        Oh yeah? You see a doctor about it? You probably got some
              germs in the cut, you see.
Veteran:      No, George Cross!
Eddie:        Oh, it was him was it? Well, you should have know better
              mate.
Richie:       And, ah, what did you do during the war, Spudgun?
Spudgun:      Nothing really, I was unemployed.
Richie:       Oh that's very convenient, isn't it?
Spudgun:      It is actually, I live round the corner from the dole office.
Richie:       That's not what I meant and you know it! I spilt blood for
              the likes of you! My appendix are up there on the top of
              Mount William.
Mrs. Potato:  And for what? For a few farmers and a flock of penguins, and
              to secure another term of office for that Margaret Thatcher.
Richie:       Oh, a Bolshie eh? A pink-o? Eh-d-d-d-d, eh-d-d-d-d-
              interesting isn't it. Eh-d-d-d-d-d-interesting. Notice you
              women never muck in when it comes down to a scrap.
Mrs. Potato:  Interesting in what way?
Richie:       Er... well, well, well, it's interesting because A, I said it
              and anything I say is interesting per se, and B, er, well,
              there isn't a B because the A was so great.
Mrs. Potato:  Have you any idea how women actually feel?
Richie:       No I haven't. That's my problem really.
Mrs. Potato:  Would you like me to tell you?
Richie:       [blowing on his palms]  Take the practical, if it's all the
              same with you.
Spudgun:      I think my Mum's right you know.
Richie:       Well then why don't you just go and live in the Soviet Union?
Spudgun:      'Cause it doesn't exist.
Hedgehog:     And it's horrible.
Richie:       Yeah, well, yes, well, that's precisely my point.
Spudgun:      Well it's a bit of a stupid point, isn't it?
Richie:       Ten years I was fighting in the Falklands, ten long years! We
              didn't have any toilets. We didn't have any telly. We didn't
              have any buses, we had to carry everything. Tents, equipment,
              ammo... whatever that is... Souvenirs... Shopping... Yeah,
              shopping. Shopping. I liberated Port Stanley Tescos you know.
Eddie:        Yeah, I was there when Prince Andrew got his undercarriage
              shot off. That was after the war though.
Veteran:      I don't believe a word of this, you never were in the
              Falklands.
Richie:       Oh. So you don't believe me eh?  [takes off his jacket]  All
              right.  [undoing his trousers]  Take a look at this!
Veteran:      I'd rather not.
Richie:       Oh come on, what's that!  [pointing down his trousers]
Veteran:      [peering down]  Well, it looks like a very small penis.
Richie:       No, not that! That!
Veteran:      Well, it's an appendix scar.
Richie:       Yes, an appendix scar. And how do you think I got that?
Veteran:      Well, from an operation to remove your appendix.
Richie:       Yes! ...Yes, yes, that's where an Argie took my appendix out
              with his bayonet.
Veteran:      I don't belive a word of this. In fact I don't belive it so
              much I'm gonna smash your face in.
Richie:       Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo, I'd like to see you try, hopalong!
Veteran:      Ah, good, 'cause you're about to.
Mrs. Potato:  Go on, give him one!
Veteran:      All right, I will!
Richie:       All right, let's see you try, buster! Eddie, hold me back.
Eddie:        Erm I can't, I'm very busy drinking.
Richie:       What?

[The veteran, still sitting, swings at Richie hitting him in the face.]

Richie:       Right, this time, this time buster!  [gets hit again]
Barmaid:      All right, that's enough you two, now calm down!
Richie:       Hah, hah, lucky escape for you there mate!
Barmaid:      Now you, it's on the management, what would you like?
Richie:       Oh. Sexual favours now is it?
Barmaid:      No.
Richie:       What do you mean, no? What's wrong with me?
Barmaid:      Well I would have thought that was patently obvious to
              everyone.
Richie:       Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! I'm not a homosexual if that's what
              you're thinking.
Eddie:        Well, you're not strictly heterosexual are you Richie?
Richie:       Judas! I've never done it with a bloke!
Eddie:        Yeah, but you've never done it with a bird either, have you?
              [to everyone else]  Has he?
All:          No, no...
Richie:       Well, yeah,  all right, yeah, all right, all right, yeah, but
              I mean, I'm heterosexual in intent.
Eddie:        The nearest you've come to being heterosexual is barricading
              yourself in a bedroom with a copy of "Amateur Photographer"
              and a jar of hand-cream.
Richie:       Yeah, but I mean... I've done it mentally. ...Boy have I done
              it mentally. Look at that bicep. yeah, you're bloody lucky I
              didn't hit you with that one mate! Yeah, you'd be on a drip
              in Casualty by now!
Veteran:      Oh what, you want some more, do you?
Richie:       Yeah, sure, of course I want some more! Come on boys, let's
              finish him off!
Eddie:        Nah, it's all right, we'll just watch. All the best!
Richie:       [putting up his fists]  Ho-hooor!

[The veteran punches him repeatedly , ending with an upper-cut that drops
Richie. Suddenly Tight-mouth Larry gets up to his feet, hanging onto the
veteran for support.]

Larry:        Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to stop this fight
              because... I need somebody to hold on to. I think I'm a
              little bit drunk. Ha! He-haaw, which way is my betting-shop?
              'Cause I've got an absolute dead cert for the three-thirty at
              Chepstow. "Sad Ken". He's a hundred to one, but he's bound to
              come in. Only, you see, it's a bit of a secret. Only us
              bookies know about it so, don't tell anyone.

[Larry looks around to see the rest of the pub behind him listening.]

Larry:        Right, um, let's just keep it a secret between us few people
              in here then, alright? No, I'll tell you what -- forget
              everything I said. Just wipe it from your minds. Hahaha.
              Alright? What did I say?
All:          We can't remember, Larry.
Larry:        Phew, thank God for that.

[Larry stumbles towards the door.]

Richie:       Chepstow.
Eddie:        Three-thirty.
Hedgehog:     Hundred-to-one.
Spudgun:      "Sad Ken".
Larry:        [from the door]  My secret is safe!  [stumbles out]
Richie:       Bloody hell Eddie, this is our lucky day. Free money from the
              police, free drinks from the saucy bit of all right behind
              the bar who I'm definitely on with later, and now a free tip
              from Tight-mouth Larry! ...Now let's see, doodl-dl-do, doodl-
              dl-do, that's sixteen quid we've got to put on "Sad Ken".
              Which is a bit of a shame, because this is the chance of a
              lifetime.
Eddie:        Yeah.
Richie:       Oh, if only I had a huge wad.
Eddie:        Either that or a huge pile of cash.
Richie:       Yeah... Hey, I've just had a great idea! Come with me to the
              lavatories.
Eddie:        That's not a great idea, that's the same cheap trick you try
              every Saturday night!
Richie:       Eddie, this is no time for being an ugly ignorant no-brained
              arse-head from Hell!
Eddie:        We're a bit stumped then, aren't we?
Richie:       Yeah. But come to the toilets anyway, I think I might have
              something of interest for you.
Eddie:        All right me old mucker, anything for a giggle!


Scene 3. The Gent's Toilet.
---------------------------

[Richie is having a pee while Eddie watches, laughing and pointing.]

Eddie:        Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Richie:       All right, all right, all right, you'd be laughing on the
              other side of your face if you were in my shoes.
Eddie:        No I wouldn't -- I'd have very wet feet if I was in your
              shoes.
Richie:       Hwoop -- oh damn! Oh well, who cares. We'll be living in fur-
              lined lizard-skin thigh boots from here on in if my plan
              comes to fruition. Now, let's go over it again.

[Richie turns to face Eddie. Eddie jumps back]

Richie:       Oh, sorry, sorry.  [zips up]  Right, now this is the plan.
              Okay? We take off his leg, we take it down the pawn-shop,
              right, put all the money on the horse, win, redeem the leg,
              and put it back on. He'll never know. What could possibly go
              wrong? Especially with a horse like "Sad Ken".
Eddie:        You're right!
Richie:       Okey-dokey. I'll distract his attention, you swipe the leg.
Eddie:        Righty-dokey matey-bloke flap old salty sea-dog amigo skip-
              jack jockstrap piano-tuner, let's see you balls this one up!
Richie:       Right-o!


Scene 4. The Pub.
-----------------

[Richie and Eddie come back in.]

Richie:       Cripes Eddie, we're in luck, he's fallen asleep. Quick, get
              his leg off.

[Eddie grabs the veteran's left leg, pulls it out straight, and twists it a
few times trying to get it off, with horrible crunching noises. The veteran
groans in his sleep.]

Richie:       Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie:        What?
Richie:       That's the wrong leg! That's the real one.
Eddie:        Well what shall I do with it?
Richie:       Twist it back round and slip it back in the socket. Shh!

[Eddie quickly wrenches the leg back into position and jumps back. The
veteran sleeps.]

Eddie:        Phew!
Richie:       Right. Stick your hand right up his trouser leg and undo the
              fastenings on his falsie.

[Eddie looks disgusted.]

Richie:       Hang on, I'll do it.

[Richie investigates up the veteran's trouser-leg.]

Richie:       There we are...  [finds something]  Hwoorgh! Eddie...
              [thinks again and undoes the fastenings]  There you go. Get
              down the pawn-shop, get what you can for that, and slap it
              all on "Sad Ken". I'll keep him unconscious.
Eddie:        Right.  [holding up the leg]  Best foot forward. I'll leg it
              down to the pawn-broker's.

[Eddie leaves, doing a three-legged walk with the false leg. Richie walks
along the bar gathering up all the left-over dregs.]

Richie:       [to barmaid]  Ah, morning!

[He puts a funnel in the veteran's mouth and pours the drink down him. The
veteran gulps noisily without waking up.]


Scene 5. A Pawn-shop.
---------------------

[The shop is full of people, all trying to get to the broker's hatch.]

Broker:       No it's not! No it's not!
Spudgun:      [holding up a rat]  Yes it is, I tell you, it's a mink. Look
              at that pelt.
Broker:       No it's not, that's the third time this week! Now bugger off!
Spudgun:      [holding up a set of false teeth]  What about some ivory
              then?
Broker:       [to Hedgehog]  Can I help you sir?  [to Spudgun]  Get lost!
Hedgehog:     A copy of "Health and Efficiency" please.
Broker:       We don't do those!
Hedgehog:     Ah, not much of a porn-shop then is it? All right then, how
              much for this telly?
Broker:       Telly, ten quid.
Hedgehog:     Ten quid? But it's practically brand new! And it's "Bob's
              Full House" tonight!
Broker:       Exactly.
Hedgehog:     Oh, I see what you mean. All right then, give us a fiver.

[Spudgun is trying to extract teeth from an old woman's mouth with a pair
of pliers.]

Spudgun:      Look, come on Gran, I only want the gold one at the back. Sad
              Ken's a dead cert!

[Eddie enters, carrying the leg.]

Eddie:        Out of the way, out of the way, I'm trying to ger my leg
              over!
Mrs. Potato:  Ooh, you saucy sod, it'll cost yer! What d'you say to two
              quid?
Eddie:        I'd say ta very much.  [takes the money]  How was it for you?
              [to the broker]  Right, how much for this carved wooden leg?
Broker:       Now, there's a nice bit of objet d'art! Must be worth at
              least two and a half grand.
Eddie:        Oh.
Broker:       I'll give you one pound fifty for it.
Eddie:        Let's haggle.
Broker:       All right, a quid.
Eddie:        No, let's haggle upwards.
Broker:       All right, 50p!
Eddie:        Blimey, they don't call you "Harry the Bastard" for nothing,
              do they?
Broker:       No, they call me Ted!
Eddie:        Well listen Ted. I've still got a photograph of you, a
              Chippendale, and an industrial size drum of Swarfega.
Broker:       Have you?
Eddie:        Ah-hah.
Broker:       Then I'll give you five hundred pound for the leg.
Eddie:        Thank you very much!
Broker:       Now bugger off!


Scene 6. The Pub.
-----------------

[Richie is singing lullabies to the near-comatose veteran.]

Richie:       Hush little baby, don't say a word,
        Daddy's got a dead cert in the three-thirty at Chepstow...
Veteran:      [stirs]  Oh, God, what's that horrible noise? Oh, I've just
              had a terrible nightmare about an insane git with a very
              small penis singing at me.
Richie:       Christ, he's coming round!  [to barmaid]  Quick, give us
              another seven bottles of Malibu.
Barmaid:      Cor, you Government types know how to put it away, don't you?
Richie:       [oily]  You're not wrong there, my dear.
Veteran:      Oor, sorry about that. Phwor, my head. I think I'll just walk
              it off.
Richie:       No! No! No, er, er, I'll, I'll, I'll walk it off for you.
              [walking around]  Aahh, ahh-haa-ha.
Veteran:      Cor, I, I feel completely legless!
Richie:       You don't know the half of it mate! Here, tell us another
              two-hour anecdote about Goose Green.
Veteran:      [slurred]  Well, there was me and Trigger...


Scene 7. A Betting-shop.
------------------------

[The shop is full. Eddie is just putting a bet on.]

Eddie:        Five hundred quid, on the nose, on Sad Ken if you please.
Bookie:       Certainly. Would you like to pay tax?
Eddie:        Well of course I wouldn't. What a ridiculous question!
Bookie:       Right then, here we are Marjorie, another bundle for the Sad
              Ken pile.

[He tosses Eddie's notes onto a huge pile of money.]

Old Man:      7p on Sad Ken, please.
Bookie:       7p?
Old Man:      Yeah, it's all Harry the Bastard would give me for my house.
Bookie:       Right then, that's it I'm afraid. Race on!
Eddie:        Right, here we go then. Acapulco here we come! Ahh, this is
              it boys. Untold wealth. Birds!
Spudgun:      Booze!
Hedgehog:     Budgerigars!
Commentator:  They're lined up now ready to go... and they're off! Ah well,
              they're nearly all off, there still stuck in the stalls is
              Sad Ken, er, oh and he's off now, he's gone now in completely
              the wrong direction, rather slowly. And I must say I think
              it's very sporting of them to enter a three-legged blind
              horse here this afternoon... And he's hit a tree, he's hit a
              tree, and he's down -- oh well, back now we go to the leaders
              -- ah, no, no, back with Sad Ken for now, and I'm afraid
              they've had to shoot him. Yes, Sad Ken has been shot... and
              so has the jockey.


Scene 8. The Pub.
-----------------

[Richie is still entertaining the veteran.]

Richie:       Ah, er, er, and after that I went to my secondary school.
              Where, ha, all the teachers had different names of course.
              There was Mr., er, ah, Baker, eh, Mr., eh, Mr. Derbyshire, ha
              ha ha, who interestingly enough actually came from Berkshire!
              Ah...
Eddie:        Richie.
Richie:       Shut up Eddie, I've got to keep this berk talking until Eddie
              gets back.
Eddie:        All right.
Richie:       Oh, it's you! Hah, and don't sneak up on me like that. You
              know what us old war veterans are like. They didn't call us
              the "Desert Scorpions" for nothing, you know.
Eddie:        No. They called you that because you're small, unpleasant and
              rather poisonous.
Richie:       Eddie, shut up, you're not as interesting as me.
Eddie:        Fair enough.
Richie:       Right! Where is the loot?
Eddie:        Hah. Well, brace yourself.
Richie:       Ah. Hup!  [holds his body rigid]
Eddie:        Because Sad Ken didn't turn out to be quite the wonder-horse
              that we expected.
Richie:       What? That's impossible.
Eddie:        Hmmm.
Richie:       Tight-mouth Larry said he was a hundred-percent cert.

[The landlord and Larry come in from the back of the pub, laughing. Larry
is waving a bundle of money.]

Larry:        Ha ha ha, well, we had you there, didn't we?
Landlord:     Good afternoon, suckers! As your friendly landlord I'd like
              to introduce you all to my niece, Veronica.  [indicates the
              barmaid]  Ha ha, how'd it go love, all right?
Veronica:     Yeah, it was just like you said. They all pretended to be
              from the Government.
Landlord:     Yeah.
Veronica:     Oh, and you were right about the complete git. He has got a
              small penis.
Richie:       Thank you very much. That's your name crossed off my little
              list.
Veronica:     Thank God for that.
Eddie:        Yeah, you might as well throw away that minute piece of paper
              now Richie.
Larry:        So how much did they get through at the bar then?
Landlord:     Two thousand quid.
Eddie:        That ought to be about right.
Larry:        Well that's all right, we made fourteen grand on the race, so
              minus two that's twelve.
Landlord:     Makes six grand apiece. Not a bad afternoon's work. Ha ha ha.
Richie & Eddie:
              Bastards!
Larry:        Great!

[The veteran is laughing.]

Richie:       Yeah, and you can shut up too -- Christ, Eddie, the psycho's
              coming round. Where's his leg?
Eddie:        Well... there it is, there!
Richie:       No no no, where's his other leg?
Eddie:        He hasn't got another leg!
Richie:       No, I mean quick, get down the pawn-shop and redeem his other
              leg!
Eddie:        Right, quick, give me five hundred quid!
Richie:       Right, quick, into the lavvies.
Eddie:        No, Richie! It's illegal! Besides, you'll never make five
              hundred quid that quick! You'd be lucky to get 10p a go!
Richie:       Come on Eddie, I've got a brilliant idea! Into the lavs!


Scene 9. The Gent's Toilet.
---------------------------

[Richie and Eddie run in, frantic.]

Eddie:        Okay, what's the brilliant idea?
Richie:       Panic! Hoooo, hooo, hooo!
Eddie:        Calm down!  [slaps him]  Look, I'll handle this. My uncle
              Percy used to be in the trenches in the first world war. Hah!
              You know what he used to say?
Richie:       What?
Eddie:        Aarrgh, bloody hell, Germans, thousands of them, oooh, shoot
              me , aargh, help me, I wanna go home, aaargh, aaargh!
Richie:       Eddie, shut up!
Eddie:        Aaargh, aaargh, aaargh!
Richie:       Shut up!  [slaps him]
Eddie:        Aaargh, aaargh, aaargh!
Richie:       [slap]  Shut up!  [slap]  Shut up! All right?

[Eddie, panting, nods. Richie looks reassured. Eddie punches him.]

Richie:       All right!

[Richie punches Eddie. They fight.]

Richie:       Hang on! This is a bloody good idea!
Eddie:        What, you want some more do you?
Richie:       No, no, no no no. Why don't we mug the first person that
              comes into the toilets?
Eddie:        Great idea!  [punches Richie]
Richie:       [holding his teeth]  What did you do that for?
Eddie:        Well you were the first person that came in.
Richie:       Yeah, but I haven't got any money!
Eddie:        [sighs]  Damn! Ha. Didn't work eh? Not much in this mugging
              game, is there?
Richie:       No, you dolt! I'm talking about the subsequent lavatarians!
              Look, the next person that comes in, right, we mug him,
              right? Or her. If she's a perv. Never know your luck!
Both:         Hwoorgh!
Richie:       Right. After we've robbed him, nip down the pawn-shop, redeem
              the leg, bring it back, and put it back on. Everything'll be
              tickety-boo. We'll be back home with our feet up in front of
              "Emmerdale Farm" before you can say...
Eddie:        Someone's coming into the toilet.
Richie:       "Someone's coming into the toilet." Someone's coming into the
              toilet!

[Richie pulls the condom machine off the wall. Eddie arms himself with a
toilet seat.]

Richie:       Quick Eddie, let him have it

[Richie bangs the man over the head with the machine and starts punching
him in the stomach. Eddie hits him with the toilet-seat, realises who it
it, plucks Richie's arm and points at his face. Richie starts hitting the
man in the face.]

Eddie:        It's Chief Inspector Grobbelaar.
Both:         Shit.


Scene 10. The Police Station
----------------------------

[Another line-up, including Richie, Eddie, Hedgehog, Spudgun and Mrs.
Potato.]

Mrs. Potato:  Get on with it, you filthy scum. Why don't you get a real
              job?

[Grobbelaar punches her. She falls back against the wall.]

Grobbelaar:   Happy with the line-up, gentlemen?
Richie:       Well, no, not really, I mean, you know that it's us, don't
              you? We don't stand a chance!
Grobbelaar:   That's the beauty of it, sir.
Richie:       Well, don't we get a make-up artist or something? Or some
              time to grow a moustache... or have a sex change?
Eddie:        I demand to see a lawyer! Preferably a female nudie one.
Grobbelaar:   If you'd like to shut up now sir, I'll go down the line and
              see if I can spot the felons.

[He walks down the line until he reaches Richie and Eddie, who are pulling
faces and bent over like hunchbacks.]

Richie:       Damn! All right, what happens now, copper?
Grobbelaar:   Well, I invite everyone here to fall on you and give you a
              damn good kicking.
Both:         What?
Grobbelaar:   In your own time gentlemen.  [blows a whistle]
Richie:       No, no!

[Truncheon blows land on Richie and Eddie's heads. Freeze-frame, roll
credits.]
