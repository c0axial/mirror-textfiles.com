@ Further modifications made by Sean Rouse... by no means is this complete
@ more lines need to be added.

  LATEST REVISION DETAILS:

     This copy is was edited and all that neat stuff by Rodney Horror. The lines
     here are ones used at Raleigh NC's Rialto theatre. These are NOT all of the
     lines!! They are just some of the more popular. You will notice that in
     Toucha-Toucha-Touch Me and Eddie's Teddy that the "Echos" were left out
     because they change so often. Well, enjoy!! Hope to see you at the late
     night, double featue, picture show!!!

        General Information:
                Audience instructions are in square brackets.  Text in quotes
                is to be shouted.  The instruction 'Echo' indicates that the
                following line is to be shouted in unison with the film.

                Whenever Brad appears, or is introduced in some way
                the line "Asshole!" is appropriate.
                When Janet is introduced or appears, the line "Slut!" is
                appropriate, or you prefer...
                the line "Nice" (Nissss)is appropriate to Janet.  Whenever

                Drag" or "It's Mary Poppins taking a shit" are
                appropriate.

                Before the movie starts, yet after the pre-show, it is
                customary to yell "4,3,2,1 Start the fucking movie!! 1,2,3,4
                forget the movie start the fucking!!"

            been almost inseparable since you met in Dr. Scott's refresher
            class.

Ralph:      Well to tell you the truth, Brad, that's the only reason I
            showed up in the first place. (chuckles)

            ah, if I may, ["You may not!"] ...to take you ["where?"] on a
            strange journey.  ["How strange was it? So strange they made a

            It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors ["asshole"]
            his fiancee Janet Weiss ["slut"], two young, normal, healthy kids,
            left Denton that late November evening, to visit a Dr. Everett Scott, ex-tutor,
            now friend to both of them.
            ["Is it true that you know about anal sex with porcupines?"]
            It's true there were dark storm clouds.
            ["Describe Oprah Winfrey!"]
            heavy, black, and pendulous, towards which they were driving.
            ["It it also true that you masturbated with Pee Wee Herman?"]
            It's true, also, that the spare tire they were carrying
            was badly in need of some air,["So's your fucking neck!"]
            but, uh, they being normal kids, on a night out ["it was a night
            in!"] [Begin yelling "Fuck that chin!" until chin has been fucked]
            well, they weren't going to let a storm spoil the rest
            their evening, were they?...On a night out... it was a night out
            they were going to remember... ["How long?"] for a very long time.

            [move hands as if they were windshield wipers]

            [echo stuff to Nixon speech....]

            ["How many motorcylces has that been Janet (Slut)?"]

Janet:      Gosh, that's the third motorcycle that's passed us.
            ["The slut can't count. It's the first!"]
            They sure do take their lives in their hands, what with the
            weather and all.

            Brad:       Yes, life's pretty cheap to that type. ["Yay that type"]

Janet:      Oh. ...What's the matter, Brad darling?

            ["Make a sound like a cow"]

Brad:       Hmmmm...We must have taken the wrong fork a few miles back. ["Wrong
            spatchula!"]

Janet:      Oh, but where did those motorcycles come from?

            [Imitate Twilight Zone theme.]

Brad:       Hmmm... well I guess we'll just have to turn back.
            [Repeat "Grab that tit!" until tit is grabbed] <BOOM!!!>

Janet:      Oh! What was that bang? ["A gang bang!"]

Brad:       We must have a blowout. ["Kill that New Kid!"] DAMMIT! [clap hands]
            I knew I should have
            gotten that spare tire fixed. ["Asshole!"]  Well, you just stay here
            keep warm and I'll go for help.

Janet:      But where will you go in the middle of nowhere?

Brad:       [chant "castle!"] ...Didn't we pass a castle back down the road
            a few miles?  [Cheer] Maybe they have a telephone we could use.
            ["Castles don't have telephones, asshole!" repeat when appropriate]

Janet:      I'm going with you.

Brad:       Oh, no, darling, there's no sense in both of us getting wet.

            ["She's allready wet!"]

Janet:      I'm coming with you! ["That'll be a first!"]
            Besides darling, the owner of that phone might be a beautiful woman,
            ["He is!"] and you might never come back again.

Brad:       Heh, heh, heh, heh.

            [they get out of the car "Kick it!".  NEWSPAPERS over heads, squirt

            OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE
            ["Where do you masturbate?"]
Janet:      In the velvet darkness,
            Of the blackest night,
            Burning bright, ["What's up your ass?"] there's a guiding star.
            No matter what or who you are.

Brad & Janet: There's a light... [light MATCHES on 'light']

Chorus:     Over at the Frankenstein place.

Brad & Janet: There's a light...
            ["Where's Santa Claus?"]

Chorus:     Burning in the fireplace...

            [MATCHES out on 'darkness' - "Darkness!" if any lights still on]
Brad & Janet: There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life.

            ["Sing to us oh, hairless one!"]
Riff Raff:  The darkness must go down the river of night's dreaming.
            Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming
            Into my life.  Into my life...

Brad & Janet: [off at 'Darkness'] ...in the darkness of everybody's life.
           ["and Betsy Ross used to sit at home and sew and sew..."]

}
}Brad:       I can see the flag fly
}            I can see the rain
}            Just the same, there has got to be

}
}            (repeat chorus))

Narrator:   And so, it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet
            ["unlike your neck"] and
            that they had found the assistance that their plight required.
            ["Are you sure?"] ...Or had they?

Janet:      Brad, let's go back, I'm cold and frightened...

Brad:       Just a moment Janet, they might have a phone.

Brad:       Hi! My name is Brad Majors, and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.
            I wonder if you could help us.  You see, our car broke down
            a few miles up the road... do you have a phone we might use?

            ["Look between Janet's legs" or "Castles don't have phones

Riff Raff:  You're wet.

            ["Janet, are you a slut?"]
Janet:      Yes ["why?"] it's raining.

            ["Are you an asshole, Brad?"]
Brad:       Yes.

            ["Riff, are you stoned?"]
Riff Raff:  Yes... I think perhaps you better both ["Get Lost"] come inside.
            ["I don't care where you come as long as you clean it up."]

Janet:      You're too kind. ["You're too fucking stupid bitch!"]
            Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of a place is this?

Brad:       Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

            ["Rich weirdos are out of season!"]
Janet:      Oh (forlornly)

Riff Raff:  ["Which way (do you fuck your sister)?"] This way.

Frank:      He'll do press-ups, and chin-ups, do the snatch,
            clean and jerk ["off"].
            He thinks dynamic tension ["what do you think of anal sex?"]
            must be hard work.
            Such strenuous living I just can't understand,
            When in just seven days, oh baby, ...I can make you a man.
                                                                        
Columbia:   EDDIE!

            HOT PATOOTIE (BLESS MY SOUL)

Eddie:       Whatever happened to Saturday night,
            When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright?
            It don't seem the same since cosmic light
            Came into my life, I thought I was divine.
            I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go,
            And listen to the music on the radio;
            A saxophone was playing in a rock 'n roll show.
            You climbed in the back seat, you really had a good time.

            Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll.
            [Echo "sex drugs and rock and roll" over "I really love..."]

            (Sax solo) [when Eddie stomps the floor, "Eat shit, and die"]

            My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled.
            My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt.
            I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
            And she'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine.
            Get back in front, put some hair oil on
            Buddy Holly was singing his very last song.
            With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along.
            It felt pretty good. Woo You really had a good time.

            Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll.
             (... for a total of twelve times)

Frank:      Oh baby... Don't be upset... ["What sort of a killing was it?"]
            It was a mercy killing... ["mercy mercy"]
            he had a certain naive charm, ["But what a muscle?"]
            but no muscle (Rocky flexes a bicep) ...Oh!

            I CAN MAKE YOU A MAN (part II)

Frank:      But a deltoid and a bicep.
            A hot groin and a tricep.
            Makes me, oooh, shake,
            Makes me want to Charles Atlas by the ["Balls!"] ...ha-ha-hand.

Frank & Transylvanians: In just seven days I can make you a man.

Frank:      I don't want no dissention, just dynamic tension.

            ["Sing it, Bitch!"]
Janet:      I'm a muscle fan.

Frank:      In just seven days, I can make you a man

            I'm sorry, however, if you found my words misleading, but you see,
            you are to remain here, in spirit, anyway.

Scott:      Great heavens!  That's a laser!

Riff Raff:  Yes, Dr. Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure
            anti-matter. ["Does that mean it doesn't matter?"]
            
Brad:       You mean...you're going to kill him?  What's his crime?

Scott:      You saw what became of Eddie.  Society must be protected.
            ["Fuck society!"]

Riff Raff:  Exactly, Dr. Scott.  And now, Frank N Furter, your time has

Riff Raff:  They didn't like me! ["Get real paraniod"] He never liked ME!

Scott:      You did right.

Riff Raff:  A decision had to be made. ["and I made it"]

Scott:      You're O.K. by me. ["Nanoo Nanoo, Shazscott!"]

Riff Raff:  Dr. Scott, I'm sorry about your ["dinner"] nephew.

Scott:      Eddie? ["No, Penelope!"]
            Yes, well, perhaps it was all for the best, heh, heh, heh.

Riff:       You should leave now, Dr. Scott, while it is still possible.
