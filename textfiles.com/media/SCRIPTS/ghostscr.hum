		      THE REAL GHOSTBUSTERS
			 "KNOCK, KNOCK"

.HE	076001 / REV. 3/4/86					     #


    FADE IN:

    EXT STREET - ROW OF HOUSES

    Nothing unusual about them.  We just keep hearing this
    CRASHING and BANGING from somewhere OS.  PAN from the row of
    houses back across the street.  A CROWD (seen more or less in
    silhouette) stands outside wooden barricades, looking at
    something we can't yet see.  PUSH IN as the SOUNDS grow.

    CLOSE - BARRICADE

    And there, painted dead-center on the sawhorse-type
    barricade, is The Symbol of the Ghostbusters.  At the sound
    of a particularly nasty CRASH from somewhere OS, a fist slams
    suddenly INTO FRAME, bashing the sawhorse.

			    MORELLI (OS)
		    (agonizing)
	     What are they doing in there?

    ANGLE - MORELLI, VICTOR

    MORELLI, a paunchy older man, stands with his son VICTOR, a
    few members of the CROWD visible in BG.  They stand on the
    other side of the barricade, looking with anguish at the
    source of the disturbance.	SFX CONTINUE.

			    VICTOR
	     It'll be all right, dad.  I'm sure the
	     Ghostbusters know what they're doing.

    OVERSHOULDER SHOT - MORELLI, VICTOR, BOWLING ALLEY

    A giant bowling-ball pin tops the building, keying us to its
    nature.  Victor pats his father's shoulder as we PUSH IN to
    increased sounds of detestation from within the bowling alley.

			    VENKMAN (VO)
	     That's it -- we've got 'em now.

    INT BOWLING ALLEY - WIDE ANGLE

    Where our four intrepid Ghostbusters - VENKMAN, STANTZ,
    SPENGLER and ZEDDMORE stand amid the debris, particle-beam
    throwers in-hand, an impressive sight.  They'd be a lot more
    impressive if they weren't surrounded by about thirty or so
    floating bowling balls hovering just below the ceiling,
    circling them, looking ready to do severe damage to the
    Ghostbusters.

			    VENKMAN
		    (to the unseen ghosts)
	     Okay, guys, give it up.  You've had
	     your fun, scared a few folks, but we
	     don't scare.  We eat ghosts like you
	     for breakfast.

    UPSHOT - STANTZ

    Summoning up his bravado, the circling bowling balls visible
    overhead in BG.

			    STANTZ
	     Peter's right!  You haven't got a
	     chance!  So go ahead -- take your best
	     shot!

    ANGLE - VENKMAN, SPENGLER, ZEDDMORE

    Who, as one, wince at this.

			    SPENGLER/ZEDDMORE/VENKMAN
		    (as one)
	     Oh, no . . . .

			    GHOST VOICES
		    (chorus, heavy reverb)
	     If you insist!
		    (maniacal laughter)

    UPSHOT - BOWLING BALLS

    Shooting down TOWARD CAMERA.

    ANGLE - TABLE

    Under which the Ghostbusters dive en_masse to avoid the
    hailstorm of bowling balls raining down all around them to
    TREMENDOUS CRASHES AND BANGS.

    UNDER TABLE - MEDIUM

    Where the four huddle, some holding their ears.  CRASH!
    BASH!  SMASH!  Venkman gives Stantz a withering look.

			    VENKMAN
		    (forced pleasantness)
	     Good thinking, Ray.  I like that.	But
	     somehow, I don't think you'll get
	     a gold star beside your name this week.

    EXT BOWLING ALLEY - CROWD

    Where Morelli and Victor stand with the crowd in BG as we
    HEAR more CRASHING AND BASHING from OS.

			    MORELLI
	     What noise!  You think we should go in
	     and help?

    Then: an OS CRASH OF BREAKING GLASS.  An instant later, a
    BOWLING BALL rockets THROUGH FRAME, hitting a tree so hard it
    goes right THROUGH IT, before hitting the ground so hard it
    buries itself in the cement.  Vincent looks to Morelli.

			    VINCENT
	     In a word . . . no.

    ANGLE - SPENGLER

    Huddled under the table, BASHES all around, as he pulls out
    the PKE meter.  Its wings rise, it FLASHES and BEEPS rapidly.

			    SPENGLER
	     This is it!  Energy level approaching
	     maximum.  We should get a visible force
	     five manifestation any -- second -- NOW!

    UPSHOT - CEILING

    With a FLASH! there appear five or six GHOSTS -- various
    grotesque forms floating around in the air.  They are not
    critical to the remainder of the story, so they can be just
    about any design.  They cavort, spin, whirl, and zoom.

			    GHOST CHORUS
		    (whoops, cackles, etc.)
		    (heavy reverb)

			    ZEDDMORE (OS)
	     Now's our chance!  Let's get 'em!

    WIDE - INCLUDES CEILING, TABLE

    As the Ghostbusters emerge from cover, raise their particle
    beam throwers, and FIRE!  Particle beams SHOOT OUT toward the
    circling ghosts.

    MEDIUM - GHOSTS

    As they are ensnared in the four-pointed pyramid of particle-
    beams that hit and HOLD them in a field of sheer energy.

			    STANTZ (OS)
	     That's it!  Careful now!  Easy!  Easy!

    WIDE - INCLUDES GHOSTBUSTERS

    As the trapped ghosts are lowered toward the ecto-trap.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Okay, they're in position!  Opening the
	     trap -- NOW!

    DOWNSHOT - THE TRAP

    The small doors open, and a beam of incandescent brilliance
    shoots out.

    WIDEN - INCLUDES ALL

    The beam from the trap catches the ghosts, and in a whirlwind
    of EFX, yanks them into the trap.  Its doors close.  All quiet.

    TWO-SHOT - SPENGLER, VENKMAN

    As Venkman brushes some dust from his lapel, eminently pleased.

			    VENKMAN
	     Hey, piece of cake!  Told you this'd be
	     an easy one!

    WIDEN

    PULLING BACK as the Ghostbusters head out of the bowling
    alley, REVEALING that the place is an utter shambles.

    EXT BOWLING ALLEY

    As the Ghostbusters emerge, triumphant, to the SHOUTS of
    approbation from the CROWD.  A smiling Zeddmore nudges Egon.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     I think they like us!

    Spengler eyes the crowd with cool scientific aplomb.

			    SPENGLER
	     I don't know -- it could be a trap.

    Zeddmore, rolling his eyes at the ever-cautious Spengler,
    grabs his hand and holds it up with his own two, waving to
    the crowd, taking it all in.  Spengler looks like he wishes
    he were somewhere else.

						 SMASH CUT TO:

    CLOSE - ECTO 1 FLASHING BEACON

    PULL BACK from the strobing light to reveal the Ecto 1 racing
    its way through busy streets, traffic parting before it like
    the Red Sea.  The Ghostbusters are inside, Stantz driving.

			    STANTZ (VO)
	     Boy, will I be glad to get home.  I'm exhausted.

    REVERSE ANGLE

    As the Ecto 1 races AWAY FROM CAMERA OVER:

			    ZEDDMORE (VO)
	     Yeah!  Home -- to some peace and quiet.

						      CUT TO:

    INT GHOSTBUSTERS HQ - BLACK SCREEN

    Nothing.  Darkness.  HOLD for a BEAT, under a CRUNCHING
    noise.  Then the garage door angles open.  The Ghostbusters
    stand silhouetted against the bright light outside.

			    VENKMAN
	     Peace and quiet, eh?

    REVERSE - GARAGE/OFFICES

    Where a line of partly-eaten food extends the length of the
    HQ, to where Slimer sits, munching.  A frazzled looking
    JANINE stands nearby, arms folded, unhappy.  Slimer, on the
    other hand, only looks up for a moment, then keeps on eating.

			    JANINE
		    (frustrated)
	     I tried to stop him.  You guys don't
	     need a receptionist, you need a baby
	     sitter!  A whole platoon of 'em!

    ON VENKMAN

    Not looking at all happy.

			    VENKMAN
		    (end of his rope)
	     Slimer . . . !

    ON SLIMER

    Who REACTS with trepidation and leaps into the air, doing a
    double-somersault before diving through a crack in the floor
    boards and disappearing.

    ANGLE - VENKMAN, STANTZ, SPENGLER, ZEDDMORE

    As they survey the damage.

			    VENKMAN
	     Just let me blast him.  Once.  Is that
	     really so much to ask?


			    SPENGLER
	     Not yet.  We haven't finished testing
	     him yet.  He's the only ghost who'll
	     sit still for us -- we can't let the
	     opportunity for science pass us by.

    ON STANTZ

    Who smiles in that way of his.

			    STANTZ
	     Besides -- I'm teaching him how to fetch!

    ANGLE - FLOORBOARDS

    As Slimer's hand comes back through the floorboards and tries
    to drag a chicken leg through after him -- without success.
    Venkman's FEET stomp THROUGH SCENE.

			    VENKMAN (VO)
	     Science -- I love it.  Well, come on,
	     let's get these little nasties put
	     away.

    PLOOP!  The chicken leg is yanked through the floorboards.

    INT - BASEMENT

    Where the Ghostbusters come down the stairs into the basement
    area where the containment unit squats, big and impressive.

    ANGLE - WALL CONTAIMNEMT UNIT

    As the Ghostbusters ENTER FRAME and stop in front of the unit.

    ON VENKMAN, ZEDDMORE

    Venkman holds up the trap.	It RATTLES, and there are SNARLS
    and GRUMBLES from within it.  He pushes it toward Zeddmore.

			    VENKMAN
	     Okay, Winston, it's your turn.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     My turn?  It's your turn.  I did dishes
	     Tuesday, remember?  We traded.

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    As Spengler sighs and comes between them, taking the trap.

			    SPENGLER
		    (a sigh)
	     Never mind, I'll do it.

    CLOSE - VENKMAN, ZEDDMORE

    They lean toward one another conspiratorially.

			    VENKMAN
	     Works every time.

    ON SPENGLER

    As he opens the containment unit door, inserting the trap.

			    SPENGLER
	     I don't understand what you're afraid
	     of.  Just because it blew up once
	     doesn't mean it'll blow up again, right?

    WIDEN TO INCLUDE ALL

    As, behind Spengler, they all take one big step backward kind
    of like a Busby Berkeley chorus line, saying:

			    ZEDDMORE/VENKMAN/STANTZ
	     Right.

    Spengler pulls the lever that moves the ghosts into the
    containment unit.  The others plug their ears, fearing the worst.

    ON SPENGLER

    Nodding, satisfied, as the containment unit does its thing.

			    SPENGLER
	     There.  Now that they're safely inside
	     the containment unit, they won't be
	     bothering anybody for a long, long time.

    WIDEN TO INCLUDE ALL

    Stantz, Zeddmore and Venkman step, smiling, back to where
    they had been a moment earlier, and Spengler turns to face
    them.

			    SPENGLER
	     Now we can get some rest.


						   WIPE TO:

    INT SUBWAY TUNNEL

    Still under construction.  PAN the length of it.  At the
    largest, most complete end, there are tracks freshly laid.
    Further on, it's a little more primitive, wires and metal
    sticking out at odd angles.  PAN into the darkness of the far
    end of the tunnel and PUSH INTO the darkness . . . .

    INT END OF TUNNEL

    Where some WORKMEN dig with digging machines and pick-axes.
    CAMERA LINGERS and PUSHES IN on two WORKMEN, each examining a
    layout of the growing tunnel.  Then:

			    THIRD WORKMAN (OS)
	     Hey, Bob!	Come take a look at this!

    Holding up a finger to mark his place in the discussion, the
    First Workman heads off toward the sound of the voice,
    picking up a lantern as he enters

    NEW DIG AREA

    Where freshly-dug dirt has been just pushed away to REVEAL,
    in the glow of hanging lanterns, what looks suspiciously like
    a door.  A very, very old door, with strange markings and an
    odd, mouth-like arperture surrounded by weird hieroglyphics.

			    FIRST WORKMAN
	     What is it?

    CLOSE - MARKINGS, ARPERTURE

    Looking very strange, very Lovecraftian in the half-light.

			    FIRST WORKMAN (OVER)
	     Beats me.	Hey, lookit all that weird
	     writing.  What d'you think it means?

    TWO-SHOT - FIRST, THIRD WORKMAN

    And neither of them says the following:

			    DOOR VOICE (OS)
	     DO -- NOT -- OPEN -- UNTIL -- DOOMSDAY!

			    FIRST WORKMAN
	     Hey, good guess.  How do you know?

			    THIRD WORKMAN
	     Who, me?  I didn't say anything.

    They suddenly REACT (PLEASE, don't overdo it!) to the sight

    CLOSE - THE DOOR - ARPERTURE

    The mouth-like arperture is moving, shaping the words:

			    DOOR VOICE
	     DO -- NOT -- OPEN -- UNTIL -- DOOMSDAY.

    WIDEN TO INCLUDE ALL

    As the Third Workman backpedals a step or two.

			    THIRD WORKMAN
	     Maybe -- maybe we ought to do like it says.

			    FIRST WORKMAN
	     Are you nuts?  We've got a subway
	     tunnel to dig.  We're not gonna stop
	     just 'cause some nut door says so!
		    (calling)
	     Okay, move those drillers in!  Let's go!

    Together, the two head OS as drilling machines ENTER FRAME and
    start toward the stone door.

    REVERSE ANGLE

    As the First and Second Workmen head AWAY FROM CAMERA.

			    FIRST WORKMAN
	     There, see?  You just hafta learn how
	     to take charge, how to give orders.

    Then, suddenly, from where they just left, there's a
    tremendous BLAST!  They spin around to see

    WIDE - THE DOOR

    Knocked off its hinges -- and from within, there's a swirling
    miasma of light and mist and glittering hellfire that churns
    out, getting bigger and bigger by the second, filling the
    tunnel like a horizontal tornado, throwing the drilling
    machines back the way they came.  Grinning fireballs -- the
    loosed spirits, creatures, and so on -- come shooting out.

    ON FIRST, SECOND WORKMAN

    Ducking the onslaught of energy, fury, and grinning fireballs
    that rush all around them, heading out into the tunnels.

			    FIRST WORKMAN
	     . . . oops.  RUN FOR IT!!!

    They do.

    WIDE - TUNNEL

    The entire complement of Workmen scatter everywhichway as the
    tunnel is filled with the escaping spirits.

			    WORKMEN
		    (general panic & confusion)

    ANGLE - SUBWAY TRAIN TRACKS

    As two fireballs hit either rail, shoot a link between them,
    and skate rapidly up the line, heading into the other
    tunnels.  Other fireballs do the same.

    WIDE - JUNCTION

    Where the rails of several lines meet.  The Fireballs ENTER
    FRAME riding one set of rails, and as they arrive at the
    junction, split off, each following a different line.

    INT SUBWAY STATION

    Where a few COMMUTERS stand beside a stationary subway train,
    taking on the last of its passengers.  ANGLE DOWN to the
    tracks.  A skating fireball zips TOWARD the train, and HITS!

    ANGLE - THE TRAIN - FRONT

    Momentarily glows with energy that crackles along its metal
    skin.  Then, for a BEAT, nothing happens.  Then the front
    windows of the train alter shape slightly -- become like
    eyes.  It seems to smile -- and it's not a pretty sight.

    ANGLE - SUBWAY PLATFORM

    A MAN and WOMAN race toward the train, which has begun to MOVE.

			    MAN
	     Wait!  Wait for us!

    ON SUBWAY TRAIN - DOORS

    The MAN AND WOMAN barely manage to dive in through the still
    open doors, smiling in relief.

			    MAN
	     Made it!  Boy, are we lucky!

    SLAM!  The doors close -- and they look suspiciously like a
    huge maw (or fist) closing.

    THE TRAIN

    Peels away from the station -- its graffiti markings
    shimmering and becoming like animal markings.  And the sound
    it makes is like a scream.

    ANGLE - FRONT OF TRAIN

    Heading straight FOR CAMERA, grinning maniacally, as wisps of
    spirit-trails begin to surround it.  Just as it seems about
    to pulverize the CAMERA we

						      CUT TO:

    EXT SUBWAY ENTRANCE

    Where some COMMUTERS come barrelling out of the entrance to
    the subway, chased by any number of four, six, and eight
    legged ghosties.

			    COMMUTERS
		    (screams & shouts)

    CAMERA ANGLES UP -- and there, in the distance, is
    Ghostbuster HQ.

    INT GHOSTBUSTER FIRE STATION

    Where Venkman lays back on his bunk, looking content.

			    VENKMAN
		    (contented sigh)
	     Now -- to get some rest!

    INT JANINE'S STATION

    She hangs up the phone and slams her hand down on the alarm.

			    JANINE
	     Okay, let's ROLL!

    SIRENS blare!  CLAXONS sound!  RED LIGHTS glare!

    UPSHOT - FIRE POLE

    Lickety-split, Stantz, Zeddmore, and Spengler slide down the
    pole.  PAN QUICKLY UP.

    ANGLE - VENKMAN'S BUNK

    As Venkman crawls with utter despair out of his bunk.

			    VENKMAN
	     It's a conspiracy.  I know it.

    EXT FIRE STATION

    As the door slides up, and Ecto 1 races out and away from the
    Ghostbusters HQ.

						      WIPE TO:

    INT SUBWAY ENTRANCE

    The bottom of the steps, where -- throwers in hand -- Stantz,
    Venkman and Zeddmore move cautiously to the bottom.  PULL
    BACK TO REVEAL that the station has changed -- a lot.  Layers
    of ectoplasmic slime drip from everything in sight, jagged
    stalactmites and stalagmites jut out from odd angles, and a
    thin mist hangs over everything.  In a very short while, this
    place has gone all to heck.  The Ghostbusters look around,
    taking this all in.

			    VENKMAN
	     Very nice.  Looks a little like
	     your room, Ray.

    ANGLE - STANTZ, ZEDDMORE, VENKMAN

    Looking up as HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER fills the station.  They
    look around nervously.  The laughter stops.  Then, suddenly
    Stantz stops, holds up a hand.

			    STANTZ
	     Listen!  Do you hear -- footsteps?

    A BEAT.  Yeah, there are footsteps, all right.  Suddenly,
    Spengler ENTERS FRAME behind them.

			    SPENGLER
	     Hi, guys.

			    VENKMAN/STANTZ/ZEDDMORE
	     YAAAAAGGGHHHHH!

    WIDEN

    As the others spin toward Spengler, weapons drawn, then relax.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Geez, Egon -- how many times do we have
	     to tell you -- don't do that!

			    STANTZ
	     So what's up?  What did you find out?

    ON SPENGLER

    Consulting his PKE meter, scanning with it as he speaks.

			    SPENGLER
	     I spoke with the situation officer.  He
	     says that whatever's happening, it's
	     spreading throughout the subway system.
	     If it isn't stopped soon, the whole
	     city will be in chaos.

    ANGLE - VENKMAN, STANTZ, ZEDDMORE

    Stantz is amazed, fascinated by this.  Venkman, DURING THE
    FOLLOWING, notices something OS that gets his attention.


			    STANTZ
	     That's amazing!  I mean, we're not just
	     talking simple haunting here.  This is
	     classic transformation.  It's like the
	     whole place itself is becoming evil,
	     coming alive.  Boy, this is great!

			    ZEDDMORE
	     I love a man who enjoys his work.	But
	     now what?	Maybe we ought to . . . .

    On this, Venkman slips away, heading toward what's been
    taking up his attention.

    OVERSHOULDER SHOT - VENKMAN

    Heading toward a figure in the mist: from behind, it seems to
    be a very attractive, well-dressed blonde woman.  She stands
    at the edge of the subway platform as Venkman comes from behind.

			    VENKMAN
	     Ah, excuse me, miss?

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    As Venkman comes up behind the figure, her back still to CAMERA.

			    VENKMAN (cont'd)
		    (a come-on)
	     I hate to bother you, but maybe you'd
	     better let me escort you outside.	It's
	     not safe in here.	Nasty, nasty stuff.
	     So what do you say we --

    Suddenly, the figure turns -- and we SEE that this is a
    skeleton, not a person, dressed to the nines.  The skull-face
    widens in a HYSTERICAL LAUGH.  If the thing expects this to
    have any effect on Venkman, it doesn't.  He leans forward,
    looks at the thing's teeth.

			    VENKMAN
		    (just a tad nervously)
	     Say, now, ah . . when was the last
	     time you saw your dentist?  Hmm?

    With a ROAR, the thing disappears, fades out, the clothes and
    wig dropping, empty, to the ground.  Suddenly, he looks OS to
    an approaching, clanking ROAR from somewhere down the line.

    WIDEN TO INCLUDE ALL

    As the other Ghostbusters join him at the platform's edge, a
    SUBWAY TRAIN, looking fairly normal, if slimed, makes its
    appearance.  It pulls up, slowing to a stop before them UNDER:


			    ZEDDMORE
	     It's a train.

			    STANTZ
	     Looks like it.

			    SPENGLER
	     But I thought the trains had stopped running.

			    VENKMAN
	     Hey, this is New York!  Nothing stops
	     this town!  I love this place.

    WHOOSH!  The doors open up right in front of them.	They
    ENTER.  The doors slide shut again.  And the seam where the
    doors join . . . disappears.

    INT SUBWAY TRAIN

    As it begins moving again.	The place is amazingly dreary
    looking -- dark, oppressive.  Spengler pulls a map out of his
    jacket pocket and examines it.

			    SPENGLER
	     This could be very helpful.  From what
	     I've been able to figure out, the
	     center of the disturbance is ten miles
	     down the line. This should take us
	     there in minutes.

			    VENKMAN
	     Terrific!	Listen, I'm going to get
	     some coffee, anybody want some?

    Venkman goes to one of the doors separating compartments and
    pushes the button.

    ANGLE - VENKMAN, DOOR

    The door opens -- and the other compartment is filled with
    walking skeletons, nasties, ghosts of all sorts.  They cram
    into the door, standing, not moving, implying that the other
    car is filled with them.  Venkman takes it all in for a BEAT,
    then looks over his shoulder at his companions.

			    VENKMAN
	     On second thought, maybe we should send
	     out for coffee.

    EXT TRAIN - HEADING AWAY FROM CAMERA

    With a tremendous ROAR, the whole train SHAKES as the battle
    is joined inside.  PAN UP toward the ceiling and PUSH THROUGH to:

    EXT STREET

    PEDESTRIANS walking along the otherwise quiet street, down
    which we SEE a bunch of manhole covers in a row -- and
    suddenly, one after another, they're BLOWN right off the
    street and into the air as the SOUND of battle below rages,
    blasts of particle-beams and ghost-wisps BLAMMING! through
    the open manholes with each explosion.  The Pedestrians look
    on, wide-eyed, as the disturbance moves from one manhole
    cover to the next, heading down the street.

    INT SUBWAY STATION - FURTHER DOWN LINE

    Looking very much like the one we just left, only even more
    dark, slimy, deteriorated and otherwise yucked-up.	Silence.
    Then: a light from around the railway bend.  A light.  MOVE
    TOWARD IT.	It FILLS THE SCREEN.  SFX: SUBWAY TRAIN.

    ANGLE - SUBWAY TRAIN

    The one the Ghostbusters entered, coming down the line.  Only
    now its windows are blown out, the wheels are buckled, the
    whole thing looking like it's been through a war.  Even the
    eyes/windows of the living train are crossed.  It barely
    manages to make it to the platform before grinding to a
    shuddering halt.  No sooner do the triumphant Ghostbusters
    emerge than, in a great flurry of dust and debris, the train
    collapses in upon itself -- then fades away out of existence.

    ANGLE - SPENGLER, STANTZ, ZEDDMORE

    Going to the far edge of the platform and peering off into
    the misty reaches of the tunnel.  Here it is filled with a
    strange, swirling mist that glitters and sparks -- shades of
    red, and black, and purple slide just under the surface of
    the mist -- looking half-alive, half-unknown.  Spengler holds
    the PKE meter in his hand --

    CLOSE - PKE METER

    The wands raising up, lights flashing, beeping like nuts.

			    SPENGLER (OS)
	     This is it.  End of the line.

    TWO-SHOT - SPENGLER, STANTZ

    Looking from the PKE meter to the tunnel.

			    SPENGLER
	     The source of the disturbance is about
	     one mile further on.  It's sending out
	     enormous amounts of poltergeist energy,
	     changing the nature of everything it touches.

    ANGLE - ZEDDMORE

    Looking over the edge of the platform, he sees something at
    its base.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Hey, what's that?  That doesn't belong here.

    And with a hop, he jumps off the platform edge down to where
    the tracks run.

    UPSHOT - PAST ZEDDMORE

    Who crouches beside a large stone slab jutting out of the
    ground.  Above him, on the platform, the rest of the
    Ghostbusters appear, looking down at him.

			    STANTZ
	     What is it, Winston?  What'd you find?

			    ZEDDMORE
	     I don't know, but it looks important.
	     Take a look for yourself.

    The Ghostbusters look to each other, shrug, then leap in
    after Zeddmore.

    WIDE - STONE SLAB - INCLUDES GHOSTBUSTERS

    As they congregate around the stone slab.  And now we can SEE
    that there is writing in some strange language graven into
    the stone.	This is clearly something very, very old.  (Note:
    this is not the door we saw earlier.)

			    STANTZ
		    (whistles)
	     Whatever it is, it's been been buried
	     for ages.	Looks like it came out of
	     the ground all by itself, maybe drawn
	     up by all the excess psychic energy
	     around here.

    TWO-SHOT - ZEDDMORE, SPENGLER

    Kneeling down beside the stone slab, Stantz's feet visible
    behind them as they examine the artifact.  Zeddmore gestures
    toward the hieroglyphics.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Can you read what it says?

			    SPENGLER
	     It's Sumerian.


			    ZEDDMORE
	     Can you read Sumerian?

    ON SPENGLER

    Raising his head, amazed that the question would even be asked.

			    SPENGLER
	     In my sleep, underwater, and with the
	     lights off.  Of course I can read Sumerian.
	     It'll -- just -- take me a while.

    With that, he bends down to begin work.

						      WIPE TO:

    INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - LATER

    Where Venkman is sitting in FG off by himself, unwrapping a
    sandwich that he takes from his jacket pocket.  In BG the
    rest of the Ghostbusters huddle over the stone slab.  They're
    too far for us to hear what they're saying.

			    VENKMAN
	     Have a sandwich, Peter.  Thanks, think
	     I will.  Say, how long have we been
	     waiting here?  Oh, a couple of hours.
	     Think we'll ever get out of here?  Naah.

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    As Venkman puts his sandwich, on the wrapping, down beside
    him and rummages around in another pocket -- TRUCK IN on the
    sandwich, where a bony hand rises from the ground beside it,
    moves slowly over the sandwich, hovers, about to grab it,
    when Venkman leans suddenly INTO FRAME.

			    VENKMAN
	     Move it or lose it.

    The bony fingers riffle for a moment, as if thinking it over,
    then PLOOP! they dive back under the ground again as we HEAR:

			    STANTZ (OS)
	     Peter!  We got it!

    And it's just as Venkman turns to look back at Stantz that
    the bony hand reaches out and ZAP! grabs the sandwich,
    disappearing again beneath the ground.  Venkman, resigned to
    his fate, rises and heads OS.

    ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDES ALL

    As Venkman joins the remaining Ghostbusters around the slab.

			    VENKMAN
	     This better be worth a sandwich, Ray.

			    STANTZ
	     Good news!  We finally figured out what
	     the stone says!  The world's going to end!

    ON VENKMAN

    Who nods, taking this in.

			    VENKMAN
	     You have a very strange definition of
	     "good news."

    TWO-SHOT - SPENGLER, ZEDDMORE

    Rising INTO FRAME from the stone slab.

			    SPENGLER
	     According to the stone, at the far end
	     of this tunnel there's a doorway into
	     -- the nether regions.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Translation: the place where all the
	     bad folks go when they've finished
	     living.

    And Zeddmore points ominously straight down.

    WIDEN TO INCLUDE ALL

    The CAMERA PULLING BACK to give some idea of the immensity of
    their situation, making them small against it.

			    SPENGLER
	     The door was hidden deep in the earth,
	     not to be opened until doomsday, the
	     end of the world.	Only somebody opened
	     it early.	It's like breaking open a
	     dam -- and it'll keep on spreading.

			    VENKMAN
	     Yeah?  So?

    ON STANTZ

    VERY serious looking as he begins:

			    STANTZ
	     Peter -- did you ever leave some old
	     socks in your closet too long, and the
	     whole closet began to smell like your socks?

			    VENKMAN
		    (defensively)
	     Maybe.

    WIDE - TUNNEL, GHOSTBUSTERS

    As Stantz gestures to their surroundings.

			    STANTZ
	     Same thing here.  Unless we do something
	     to stop it, soon the whole world will
	     look like this -- just like the nether
	     regions.  Eternal darkness.  And the
	     earth will be governed by ghosts.

			    VENKMAN
	     No more days at the beach?

			    ZEDDMORE
	     No more beach.

    ON SPENGLER

    Standing on this side of the mist, at the end of the tunnel.

			    SPENGLER
	     We've got to find the door and close it
	     again -- even if it means we'll never
	     come back ourselves.

    With that, Spengler arms his particle-beam thrower, and steps
    into the mist, disappearing from view.

    WIDEN TO INCLUDE THE REST

    Who look to one another.  Zeddmore and Stantz arm their
    throwers, and with determined looks, follow Spengler into the
    mist.  Venkman, alone, finally throws up his hands, arms his
    thrower, and follows them in, saying:

			    VENKMAN
		    (resigned)
	     All right, all right.  But if I don't
	     come out of this alive, I'm gonna be
	     real upset!

    And he, too, disappears into the mist.  PULL BACK SLOWLY to
    reveal the mist changing shape, taking on features -- and the
    side of the mist facing us looks, for all the world, like a
    grinning skull.  It LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, as we

						      FADE OUT:

			   END_ACT_ONE
.pa
			     ACT_TWO

    FADE IN:

    INT MISTY TUNNEL

    For a BEAT, all we see is grey, swirling mist.  Then, out of
    it, come the Ghostbusters, weapons at the ready, eyes alert.
    They stop to look at what awaits them.

			    VENKMAN
	     So let me get this straight -- if we
	     don't stop it, this is what the whole
	     world is going to look like?

    Spengler nods.

    THEIR POV

    A scene out of Dante's_Inferno.  Charred, blackened earth,
    faces in the surrounding tunnel walls that watch them pass
    (Note: comparable to the Gnome King's minions in Return_to
    Oz.)  Stunted, twisted trees that look suspiciously like they
    might once have been people, bubbling pools, everything very
    organic looking, but eerie, creepy.  REALLY go to town on
    this.  (NOTE: Through this and all nether-world scenes, we
    must see occasional, familiar-though-distorted things: torn
    up subway tracks, signs hanging akilter, shattered doors,
    twisted railings, on and on.  We're NOT in another place --
    this is the Same Old Place after something very nasty has
    come in and messed everything up, changing its nature.)

			    SPENGLER (VO)
	     After Doomsday, the end of the world,
	     this was supposed replace everything.
	     But somehow it was released early, and
	     it's taking over the world now.

    ANGLE - GHOSTBUSTERS

    Who come to a sudden halt, listening.  We, too, hear a SOUND --
    a steady beating kind of noise, like oars turning in oarlocks.

			    STANTZ
	     Listen!  Something's coming!  Over
	     here, quick!

    They run to some large rocks and duck behind them, weapons drawn.

    OVERSHOULDER SHOT - GHOSTBUSTERS

    Ready, poised . . . as from around the corner in front of
    them comes, of all things, a floating boat (maybe twelve
    feet long), being rowed along the air by translucent
    ghost/people.  They are chained to the oars, and manacled to
    the boat with length upon length of chain.	They MOAN AND
    GROAN with frustration and dismay as a skeletal GUIDE -- at
    the boat's prow -- points to the surrounding ground under:

			    GUIDE
	     Look, over there!	Some more dirt!  And
	     what's that?  A plane!  Oops, sorry --
	     more dirt.
		    (laughs cruelly)

			    1ST GHOSTLY ROWER
	     But that's all we've SEEN for the last
	     five hundred years!  Dirt!  Can't we
	     ever see something else?

    ON SKELETAL GUIDE

    Sneering with glee.

			    GUIDE
	     But you've only got another thousand
	     years to go!  Then five thousand years
	     to look at rocks!

    REVERSE ANGLE

    As the boat heads AWAY FROM CAMERA.

			    GUIDE
	     Don't row so fast -- after all, we've
	     got all of eternity for our little tour!

    And with that, they row around a corner and OUT OF SIGHT.

    ANGLE - GHOSTBUSTERS

    As Stantz and Zeddmore look, open-mouthed, at one another.

			    STANTZ
	     Did you see what I just saw?

			    ZEDDMORE
	     No.

    Reassured, Stantz nods.

			    STANTZ
	     Me either.  Let's go.

						      WIPE TO:

    EXT SUBWAY PLATFORM

    A normal one, for the moment.  Two COMMUTERS stand at the
    edge of the platform, facing CAMERA, each reading the
    newspaper -- so their faces are effectively hidden.  One of
    the Commuters lowers his newspaper, and checks his watch.

			    1ST COMMUTER
	     Hmmm.  The four-fifteen's running late
	     today.  Hope there isn't a problem.

    With that, he raises his newspaper.  There's an OS RUMBLE.

    WIDEN

    As suddenly a GHOSTLY SUBWAY TRAIN comes BETWEEN CAMERA and
    the Commuters.  It FILLS THE SCREEN, wildly distorted, eyes
    that used to be windows leering madly, goblins and an
    assortment of odd creatures hanging out windows, laughing
    hysterically, clinging to the top of the train, going WOGGA-
    WOGGA at the camera, and generally carrying on.  Then it
    finally passes OUT OF FRAME . . . and the subway platform is
    different.	It's as gloomy, dark, forbidding and slimy as the
    one we saw earlier, stalactites and stalagmites breaking
    through the tiled floor and ceiling.


    The clothes of the two commuters are rumpled, torn, slimed.
    They lower their newspapers, revealing disheveled hair and
    hats, ties thrown over shoulders, several days' worth of
    beard growth on their faces.  They exchange a glance.

			    1ST COMMUTER
	     Yes, I'd say there's definitely a
	     problem up the line.

						      CUT TO:

    INT NETHER REGION - WALL

    Stone eyes following the Ghostbusters, who we SEE only as
    four shadows falling across the wall, passing THROUGH FRAME.

    CLOSE - SPENGLER

    TRACKING WITH Spengler as he adjusts the PKE meter, trying to
    fix on the strongest waves of force.  The BEEPING increases,
    and the wings stick up at one point along the arc.	Spengler
    points that way, and nods for the rest to follow.

    REVERSE ANGLE

    As the Ghostbusters walk AWAY FROM CAMERA, Stantz and
    Zeddmore bringing up the rear.  Stantz checks his watch.

			    STANTZ
	     Oh, hey -- I just realized -- we're
	     missing the news!	Do you think they'll
	     mention us?

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Nope.  I think the world's got more
	     important things to think about than us.

    And they turn a corner, disappearing around it.  SUDDENLY:

    STATIC EFX -- "CLICK", "CLICK" SFX

    As of a television set when it's changing channels.  We SEE
    NEWS ANCHOR #1, at his desk, caught in mid-sentence.

			    NEWS ANCHOR #1
	     -- the question on everyone's lips:
	     Where are the Ghostbusters?

    STATIC EFX -- "CLICK," "CLICK" SFX

    Another News Anchor.  A corner of the SCREEN shows a diagram
    of the world -- and a black cloud is spreading, starting in
    the New York area.

			    NEWS ANCHOR #2
	     -- black clouds have been reported all
	     over New York, and in surrounding
	     states.  Reports coming in indicate
	     entire streets coming alive.  Says the
	     Mayor of New York, "Frankly, it's a mess."

    STATIC EFX -- "CLICK", "CLICK" SFX

    The third, and final News Anchor, pressing his earpiece to
    his ear.

			    NEWS ANCHOR #3
	     I'm being told that the Ghostbusters
	     entered the subway system two hours ago
	     and have not been seen since.  The
	     Mayor will say only, "Everything's
	     under control."

    STATIC EFX -- "CLICK", "CLICK" SFX

    EXT SUBWAY TRAIN DEPOT

    Where a couple of dozen subway trains rest, unused, waiting
    to be called into service.	They are under an overhang, and
    on tracks, the outside world open to them on one side, the
    subway tunnels available on the other side.

    ANGLE - TRACKS

    More of the fireballs we saw earlier skate along the tracks,
    heading for the subway trains.

    SERIS OF SHOTS - THE TRAINS

    As, one by one, they come to sinister, evil-looking life.
    PAN across them, each more nasty than the one before.

    REVERSE ANGLE

    As the subway trains BLAST their sirens, and horns, and
    bells, and anything else that will make sound.  It is like
    the HOWLING of angry creatures.  Then they dive en_masse into
    the subway tunnels like wolves in search of prey.

    INT NETHER REGION - GHOSTBUSTERS

    As the Ghostbusters parade THROUGH FRAME, continuing their
    search.  Suddenly, Spengler stops short, holding the PKE
    meter up.  His outstretched arm stops the following
    Ghostbusters, who group up behind him.  Spengler gestures OS.

			    SPENGLER
	     We're almost to the doorway.  See that?

    THEIR POV

    In FG there's another of those stunted sorta/kinda trees, and
    in the BG there's a cliff-face -- literally.  It's a
    veritable stone face, it's huge mouth frozen into an "o"
    shape, as if caught in surprise, or shock, or a yawn.

			    SPENGLER (VO/cont'd)
	     It's right through there.  Once we get
	     past that, we should be able to see the
	     doorway -- and close it.

    ON GHOSTBUSTERS

    Appraising this.  They take a couple of tentative steps
    forward, coming near the sorta/kinda tree.

			    STANTZ
	     I don't know -- I don't like the looks
	     of that place.

			    VENKMAN
	     Me either.  So I have a better plan.

    ON VENKMAN

    Who jerks a thumb in the direction they came from.

			    VENKMAN
	     Turn around, and run very, very fast
	     back the way we came, and never, ever
	     look back.

    WIDEN TO INCLUDE ALL

    As Spengler shakes his head, and starts toward the cliff,
    passing the sorta/kinda tree.

			    SPENGLER
	     Sorry.  We have to go ahead with it.  I
	     just wish I knew what that was.

    And suddenly, the sorta/kinda tree stirs, its knotted-wood
    face turning toward Spengler.

			    SORTA/KINDA TREE
	     It is the Place of Lost Souls.  All new
	     spirits must pass through there.

    ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING ZEDDMORE

    Who looks around, a little nervous.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     But we're not dead.

			    SORTA/KINDA TREE
		    (a shrug)
	     Nobody's perfect.

    CLOSE - SORTA/KINDA TREE

    Midway through the following, we RACK FOCUS on the cliff in BG.

			    SORTA/KINDA TREE
	     Which is too bad.	No one still alive has
	     eve come out of there in one piece.

    WIDE - INCLUDES ALL

    As they look to one another, resigned to their fate.

			    VENKMAN
	     See?  I knew I wasn't gonna like this.
	     Well -- come on.

    They follow him OS, not looking at all happy.  The
    sorta/kinda tree watches them go.

			    SORTA/KINDA TREE
	     Have a nice day!

    And then it goes back to its previous, non-moving stance.

    ANGLE ON CLIFF - MOUTH

    As the Ghostbusters momentarily stop before the mouth of the
    cliff passage.  Each puts a hand on the other's shoulder, a
    gesture of support.  Then: they enter the dark passage,
    disappearing into the blackness within.  PULL BACK to REVEAL
    the opening closing behind them.

    BLACK SCREEN

    HOLD for a BEAT.  Then: four sets of eyes, the Ghostbusters,
    move through the pitch black.  SFX: FOOTSTEPS.

			    STANTZ
	     I wonder why they call this the Place
	     of Lost Souls.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Yeah, I was wondering the same thing.
	     Aren't they all ghosts?

    Then, abruptly, one of the sets of eyes stops.

			    SPENGLER
	     Well -- maybe this is where the worst
	     ghosts of the lot get stuck because
	     they're too awful for anyone to see.

    A BEAT.  Then, suddenly, the darkness around them is lit with
    rows and rows and rows of eyes, all different shapes,
    surrounding them in the blackness.

			    VENKMAN
	     Egon . . . why do you always wait until
	     now to think up stuff like that?

    ZIP!  The four sets of eyes, the Ghostbusters, race OUT OF
    FRAME, the horde of others following them OS with a ROAR.

    DOWNSHOT - MAZE

    Through which the Ghostbusters run, each taking a different
    pathway through the winding maze.

    INT - PASSAGE

    Where they all come together again . . . only one's walking
    on the floor of the passage, another's walking on the roof,
    and the remaining two are walking along either wall, each of
    them at right angles to the one nearest him.  They pause for
    only the barest second, then keep right on running.

    EXT GORGE BETWEEN TWO CLIFFS - OTHER SIDE

    Where the Ghostbusters emerge at a dead-run.  They stop to
    catch their breath.  SFX: BREATHING HARD.  Then they look
    around.


			    STANTZ
		    (breathlessly)
	     Whew!  That was some run!	How long do
	     you think that tunnel is, anyway?

			    SPENGLER
	     I don't know.  I'll find out.

    An he goes over to one side of the cliff that contains the
    tunnel, and looks to the other side.

    ANGLE - FRONT SIDE OF CLIFF

    And we can SEE Spengler's head poke out around from the back.
    It looks for all the world like the tunnel can't be more than
    two inches deep.

    REVERSE ANGLE

    As Spengler looks back at the Ghostbusters, then around the
    corner again, then comes back to rejoin them.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Well?  How long is the tunnel?

			    SPENGLER
		    (very, very seriously)
	     You don't want to know.

    ON VENKMAN

    Shouldering his proton pack and heading OS.

			    VENKMAN
	     All right, I've had just about enough
	     of this.  We've got a world to save,
	     and it's about time we taught these
	     jokers who they're messing with.

    ANTHER ANGLE

    As the Ghostbusters head OUT OF FRAME.

    WIDE - PASSAGE

    As the Ghostbusters come to a final turn in the passageway.
    From around the corner, a brilliant LIGHT spears the dimness,
    changing color, almost STROBING with energy and pulsations.
    A tremendous WIND whips along this area, coming from the same
    direction as the light -- from around the corner.  The wind
    whips the Ghostbusters' clothes as they approach the corner.

    TIGHTEN


    As the Ghostbusters huddle up against this side of the
    corner, against the wind.  Spengler holds up his PKE meter.
    It oscillates, beeps and flashes like crazy.  Zeddmore points
    to the light from around the corner.

    (DIALOGUE NOTE: Until indicated otherwise, all dialogue
    should be spoken as if AGAINST THE WIND.)

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Is this it?

    Spengler nods, wind whipping his hair, clothes.  Venkman
    stands, looking determined.

			    VENKMAN
	     Then let's do it.

    With a shared glance, they brace themselves and head AROUND
    THE CORNER and OS.

    INT PASSAGE LEADING TO DOORWAY

    And the wind nearly blows them off their feet.  They cling to
    outcropping rocks as they, and we, see:

    THE DOORWAY

    Now much huger than it had been.  A HOWLING, TERRIBLE wind
    screams out of the doorway.  Flashes of spirits, living
    fireballs scream out of the region beyond.	The BACK-LIT
    doorway is so bright we can barely look at it -- the center
    of sheer, incredible power.  The impression we should get is
    that someone has opened the doorway to something very much
    like Hell . . . and like a leak in a pressure cooker, the
    contents are spilling out all over the place at high-speed.
    A veritable maelstrom of surging wind and light and sound.
    Scattered around are some of the tools and machines we saw
    earlier, but now turned to stone, or weathered.  And the
    talking door is thrown back on its hinges, barely hanging on.

			    ZEDDMORE (VO)
	     Whoa!  Hang on!  This place is like the
	     eye of a hurricane!

    REVERSE ANGLE - GHOSTBUSTERS

    Holding onto the wall, old machines, outcroppings against the
    wind.  A FIREBALL shoots past them, LAUGHING.

			    STANTZ
	     I'm just glad we don't actually have to
	     go in there!



			    SPENGLER
	     Ray -- I'm afraid that's exactly what
	     we have to do.

			    VENKMAN/STANTZ/ZEDDMORE
	     What?

    TIGHTEN - FAVOR SPENGLER

    As the other Ghostbusters huddle closer, against the wind.

			    SPENGLER
	     Our only hope is to yank back
	     everything that escaped.  That might be
	     enough to close the doors again.  But
	     our portable packs just don't have
	     enough power for that.

    ANGLE - STANTZ

    As the light of realization goes on in his head.

			    STANTZ
	     But there's plenty of power -- in
	     there!

			    SPENGLER
	     Exactly.  So we have to tap directly
	     into the center of the power-flow, and
	     hope it's enough to supercharge the
	     equiplment.

    ANGLE ON DOORWAY

    The light intensifying, the sound growing louder.

			    SPENGLER (OS)
	     The flow's reaching critical stage!  If
	     we don't do it now, the breach will
	     soon be too powerful for us to close
	     it.  It'll be the end of everything.

    TWO-SHOT - ZEDDMORE, SPENGLER

    As Zeddmore glances at the doorway in BG, then at Spengler,
    concern at the realities of the situation in his eyes.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Wait a second -- if we're inside when
	     the door closes . . . .

    Give it a BEAT as Spengler looks down, uncomfortable, then
    back at his companions.


			    SPENGLER
	     We'll be trapped, yes.  With no way
	     home.  Ever.

    ANGLE - INCLUDES STANTZ, VENKMAN

    As Stantz registers utter and absolute shock and dismay.

			    STANTZ
	     But -- I just got season tickets to the
	     Yankees!  The best seat I've ever had!

			    VENKMAN
	     Egon, you kidder -- I'll bet you knew
	     this all along, and just didn't tell
	     us, am I right?

    ON SPENGLER

    Who reluctantly nods.

			    SPENGLER
	     It's our only chance.  But I figured if
	     I told you the whole story, you
	     wouldn't want to do it.

    WIDEN

    As Venkman steps back, and they all stand, tilting against
    the wind.

			    VENKMAN
	     That's a terrible thing to say, Egon.
	     You're right, of course, but it's still
	     a terrible thing to say.

    ANGLE - VENKMAN

    Stepping INTO FRAME, and looking to the doorway.  RACK FOCUS
    on the doorway UNDER:

			    VENKMAN
	     Well, if we're gonna go out, let's do
	     it in style!  I've got an image to protect.

    WIDE ANGLE

    As the Ghostbusters form a single line across the passage,
    heads bent against the wind, and the force.  With the same
    move, they take one step forward.  Then another -- and they
    are pushed even harder by the waves of force and wind from

    THE DOORWAY


    Through which more wind, thunder, light and wailing SOUND
    screams out AT CAMERA.  The force is building, putting out
    more thrust.  Louder.  More frightening.

    THE GHOSTBUSTERS

    Struggling forward, inch by inch, fighting the gale intensity
    winds, grabbing onto rocks, old pieces of equipment, anything,
    just to drag themselves forward another few inches.

    MEDIUM - SPENGLER

    As his PKE meter overloads.  He tosses it away seconds before
    it EXPLODES, then continues on.

    ANGLE - ZEDDMORE

    Teeth gritted, pulling himself along the wall.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Just a little further, Winston -- you
	     -- can do it!

    TWO-SHOT - VENKMAN, STANTZ

    Taking a second's rest against the wall.  Venkman jerks a
    thumb toward the doorway.

			    VENKMAN
		    (loud - breathless)
	     Hey, Ray!	I'm -- going next door to
	     complain -- they're playing their
	     stereo too loud again!  Wanna come?

    TIGHTEN

    And they smile, in that strange way people do when they're
    sure they're about to buy the farm, but it's okay, sorta,
    because they're with friends.  (Note: go ahead, try to
    animate THAT one!)	But it's soon gone, and they press on.

    ANGLE - DOORWAY

    As the Ghostbusters crawl/walk/scrabble to the bottom of the
    doorway, immense power surging past just overhead.	With a
    mutual nod, they begin to climb, hand over hand, up over the
    edge of the doorway --

    INT DOORWAY

    SHOOTING OUT, toward the Ghostbusters, as they climb up over
    the rim and pause, halfway in.  Their faces go slack with
    amazement and numb shock.


			    VENKMAN
	     Okay . . . I admit it.  I'm impressed.

    THEIR POV

    Simply put: Hades.	The Underworld.  The Nether-Regions.  A
    place of swirling fireclouds, black lightning, distant shapes
    moving through the void, all suffused with a supernal,
    shifting light that leans toward the ultraviolet.  A place of
    sheer, utter desolation.  Think of the outer surface of
    Jupiter, and you'll have something very close to this.

			    STANTZ (VO)
	     Okay everyone, hang on -- this is it!

    REVERSE ANGLE

    As the four Ghostbusters take up their places: two on either
    side of the now-immense doorway, clinging to the sides lest
    they be hurled away by the wind.  They pull out their
    particle beam throwers.

			    SPENGLER
	     Arm nuclear accelerators -- now!

    QUICK CUTS: THE GHOSTBUSTERS

    Switching on their nuclear accelerators.  They HUM to life.

    CLOSE - SPENGLER

    Shielding his eyes against the wind and light.

			    SPENGLER
	     Activate auxiliary power receptors --
	     now!

    ON BACKPACKS


    As the Ghostbusters each push a button.  Out of the back of
    each of the devices a panel swivels around, revealing a
    small, dish-like antenna.  ENERGY WAVES floating through the
    surrounding ether are caught up on the receptors.  And the
    power indicators on the back of their packs GLOW brightly,
    moving further and further up.  POWER HUM.

    ON GHOSTBUSTERS

    Their particle-beam throwers vibrating and bucking.  They
    fight to keep hold of them.

			    SPENGLER
	     Full dispersion mode, wide angle --
	     fire -- NOW!

    They do, immensely large waves of particle beams shooting out
    of their weapons, much larger than when we saw them earlier.

			    STANTZ
	     Whooooaaaaaa!

    REVERSE ANGLE

    As the enormous particle beams shoot down the passage and
    angle off down the intersecting passageways.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Hold on!!!!!!!!

    QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS:

    EXT GHOST-TRAIN

    Zooming along the tracks, when suddenly it's hit by particle
    beams from behind.	The beams CRACKLE and SURGE along its
    surface.  The whole thing freezes, ghosts caught on it.

    SUBWAY PLATFORMS

    Hit by the particle beams, they GLOW.

    ANGLE - SUBWAY TRAIN RAILS

    Particle-beam energy shooting along the railways, heading
    AWAY FROM CAMERA.

    EXT SUBWAY ENTRANCE

    As GHOSTS make a break for the outside world, only to be
    snared by the emerging beams.

    INT DOORWAY

    The Ghostbusters are barely able to hold onto their equipment.

			    SPENGLER
	     Okay, another second -- now!  Activate
	     capture mode!  Pull them in!  PULL!

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    The Ghostbusters hit another switch on their weapons, and the
    particle beams begin to reverse, pulling back in toward them,
    as when they pull in a ghost to capture it.

    INT DOORWAY PASSAGE

    The whole area in front of the Ghostbusters is spiderwebbed
    with energy bolts, veins of energy that FLARE and CRACKLE
    like St. Elmo's Fire, or a Tesla coil.

    SERIES OF SHOTS

    EXT SUBWAY TRAIN

    The particle beams, reversed, flow off the train, stripping
    the ghosts and everything strange off the train as it goes --
    the motion similar to a banana being peeled, the demarcation
    is that clear.

    EXT SUBWAY PLATFORM

    Same thing -- stalactites and stalagmites retract, the awful
    look of the place is peeled back as the particle beams
    reverses.

    ANGLE - SUBWAY TRAIN TRACKS

    The first Fireballs we saw earlier are yanked back along the
    rails, one after another, speeding TOWARD CAMERA.

    EXT SUBWAY STATION

    The snared ghosts strain against the particle beams like dogs
    on a leash -- then are rudely YANKED BACK inside.

    INT DOORWAY - GHOSTBUSTERS

    Who look to one another as they hear a RUMBLING.

			    STANTZ
	     Uh, oh . . . .

    THEIR POV

    Everything that got loose is now headed right AT CAMERA, a
    veritable horde of -- things, swirling, caught in the beams.
    It's truly a nasty sight.

			    STANTZ (OS/cont'd)
	     Here_come_the_neighbors!

    INT DOORWAY - GHOSTBUSTERS

    Still firing their particle beams as the surging mass of
    ghosts and other creatures comes pouring in through the
    doorway.  The WIND is surging toward them now, carrying the
    things in with them.  It looks like someone opened the drain
    in a sewer, only all the yucky stuff is flowing horizontally.

    ANGLE - FAVORING DOORS

    As the doors move back on their hinges, and start to CLOSE.

			    SPENGLER (OS)
	     That's it!  Let's go!

    ANGLE - SPENGLER

    Trying to get his footing in the terrible wind -- and he's
    knocked off his feet!  The wind pulls him further inside.

			    SPENGLER
	     Ohhhhhh!

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Egon!!!!  Grab him!

    ON GHOSTBUSTERS

    Scrambling to their feet, they try to grab Spengler as he
    zips past overhead, but miss -- and the wind whips them UP
    AND AWAY, head over heels, flying deeper into the Nether
    Region.

			    STANTZ/VENKMAN/ZEDDMORE/SPENGLER
	     Whoa!  Yaaaaaghhhh!  Aarrgghhh!

    UPSHOT - GHOSTBUSTERS

    As, carried on the wind and waves of force, they're carried
    deeper within.

			    STANTZ
		    (yelling)
	     Just one chance!  Fire!  Everything
	     you've got!  Maybe it'll push us back!
	     GO!  GO!  GO!

    They do, firing their particle-beam throwers in front of
    them, putting out retro-fire like waves of force.

    ANGLE - THE DOORS

    Closing, fast.  The gap is narrowing.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Hurry!  The door's closing!

    ON THE GHOSTBUSTERS

    Their flight in is halted -- and they start to reverse, the
    particle-beams pushing them back toward the doors, faster --

    REVERSE ANGLE - SHOOTING THROUGH DOORS

    As the Ghostbusters come shooting TOWARD CAMERA, barely
    making it through the narrowing entranceway before the doors
    close with a fantastic BOOOOOMMMMM!

			    GHOSTBUSTERS
	     Yeeooww!  Heyy!!  Made it!  Yaahoo!

    MEDIUM - GHOSTBUSTERS

    Splayed on the ground, all looking as it did in the beginning
    -- a normal dig in a normal tunnel.

			    VENKMAN
	     Hey, that was great.  Really great.
	     Can we do it again?

    ANGLE ON DOOR

    As, once again, it intones:

			    VOICE OF DOOR
	     DO -- NOT -- OPEN -- UNTIL -- DOOMSDAY!

    CLOSE - VENKMAN

    Who shrugs.

			    VENKMAN
	     It was just an idea . . . .

						      WIPE TO:

    EXT GHOSTBUSTER FIRE STATION HQ - NIGHT

    PUSHING IN on the structure UNDER:

			    STANTZ (VO)
	     Boy, am I glad to be home!  I think I
	     could sleep for a week.

    INT FIRE STATION

    The Ghostbusters move toward the kitchen, and open the fridge.

			    VENKMAN
	     You sleep.  Me, I'm gonna raid the
	     fridge and eat until dawn!

    Then, abruptly, they stop.	Venkman looks very angry.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Well . . . we can always get pizza.

    THEIR POV

    Slimer is sitting in the now-empty fridge.	He's eaten
    everything around him.  He looks up at them, smiles.

			    VENKMAN (VO)
	     SLIMERRRRR!

    ANGLE ON GHOSTBUSTERS

    And they're physically restraining Venkman from doing serious
    damage to Slimer.

			    VENKMAN
	     Let me at him!  Let me blast him!	C'mon!

    ANGLE ON SLIMER

    Whose smile vanishes.  He looks around nervously, then PLOOP!
    he dives under the floorboards again.

    WIDEN

    As the Ghostbusters release a very steamed Venkman.  They,
    however, clearly don't share his animosity.

			    STANTZ
	     Take it easy on the poor guy, Peter.

			    ZEDDMORE
	     Yeah -- just because you've had a bad
	     day, that's no reason to take it out on
	     Slimer.

    ON VENKMAN

    Who shakes his head vigorously.

			    VENKMAN
	     I don't care.  I don't like him.  I
	     never liked him.

    WIDE - SPENGLER, KITCHEN

    Who looks from the spot where Slimer was, to Venkman.

			    SPENGLER
	     Maybe that's part of the problem.  Maybe
	     he eats because he wants to feel accepted.

    CLOSE - VENKMAN

    Listening . . . but not really:

			    SPENGLER (cont'd)
	     Remember -- he's a ghost living with a
	     bunch of guys whose job it is to bust
	     ghost.  How would you feel?

    And they all head off, leaving Venkman alone.

						      DISSOLVE TO:

    INT BUNKROOM - NIGHT

    The Ghostbusters are asleep -- except Venkman, who's sitting
    up in his bunk.  Thinking.	Finally, he gets up, heads OS.

    INT LOBBY

    A door opens, spilling light on Slimer, sitting looking very
    miserable in the center of the room, all alone.  He turns, sees

    SLIMER'S POV

    Venkman towering over him.	Holding a slice of pizza.
    Venkman waggles a finger at him --

			    VENKMAN
	     You breathe a word of this to anybody,
	     and I'll deny it.

    With that, he flips the slice of pizza right into Slimer's
    mouth.

    ON SLIMER

    Slimer smiles with infinite gratitude.

			    VENKMAN (OS)
	     G'night, Slimer.

    The door closes.  TOTAL DARKNESS.  A BEAT.	Then:

			    SLIMER
		    (a huge burp)
		    (LAUGHS)

    And on that note, we
