Scene 1. The Flat.
------------------

[Richie and Eddie are sitting on the sofa. Eddie has a newspaper and a
pen.]

Eddie:   Right. Ironmonger.
Richie:  Hmm. How many letters?
Eddie:   Er... ten.
Richie:  Right. What does it begin with?
Eddie:   Well... "I".
Richie:  Well write it down then.
Eddie:   No, "ironmonger" begins with "I", that's the clue.
Richie:  So put it down!
Eddie:   But there's only room for six letters!
Richie:  [thinks]  You'll have to spell it wrong.
Eddie:   All right... Er, "V"... "Z"...
Richie:  So what have you got?
Eddie:   "Vzzbux".
Richie:  Good, good start. Good. How does that help us with two down?
Eddie:   Erm... all right, two down... erm... "Fish", four letters, now
         begins with... "X".
Richie:  "X"? ...Xylophone, xylophone fish.
Both:    [think]  Nah, it'd sink, wouldn't it.
Richie:  [sighs]  You know, I'm not sure that "vzzbux" is right.
Eddie:   Mmmmm.
Richie:  Hey, I'll tell you what! Why don't we think of another word that
         means ironmonger but only has six letters?
Eddie:   Ha! Well, that'd be cheating, wouldn't it?
Richie:  Who's to know?
Eddie:   Ha! You're right me old pal, hahahaa! We get through a few
         scrapes, don't we?
Richie:  Yeah... So, where are we?
Eddie:   Er, right. "Ironmonger", six letters. ...Oh, got it! "Harold".
Richie:  Ha-- "Harold"?
Eddie:   Yeah, well he's an ironmonger, isn't he? Harold the Ironmonger.
         Remember? We ate his dog!
Richie:  Oh right, yeah-he-heah! We bloody won that bet, didn't we?
Eddie:   No we didn't, that's why we had to eat his dog.
Richie:  Oh, oh yeah, right. Okay, well, "Harold" it is.
Eddie:   Right.
Richie:  No, hang on, hang on, hang on... "Harold" only has five letters.
Eddie:   Well, I could make the "H" really big so that it filled out the
         first two squares.
Richie:  Weeeell, are there any words dangling off the first two squares?
Eddie:   Nope, you're all right there mate, the only one we've got so far
         is "Vzzbux".
Richie:  All right! Bung it in buster!
Eddie:   Right then. Huh, ah... well there's no room for the "D".
Richie:  Oh, for goodness sake, who prints these things?
Eddie:   Ohhh.
Richie:  What is the point of having a clue if it doesn't fit the little
         holes?
Eddie:   I think I'll just put "bollocks".
Richie:  Go-- no no no, come on Eddie. Let's do it properly or not at all.
Eddie:   All right then, not at all!  [tears up the paper]  God I hate
         crosswords.  [sighs]  We can't go on like this! Why did they take
         the telly away?

[The camera pulls back to reveal the empty table, a television-shaped
outline remaining in the dust.]

Richie:  You know very well why they took the telly away.]
Eddie:   No I don't.
Richie:  Yes you do, Edward Hitler. They took the telly away because
         according to you, while you were wending your merry way down to
         the telly shop with the rent money, you ran into a rather strange
         and wizened old man, who sold you five magic beans. Which,
         coincidentally, cost exactly the eighty-six pound twenty-three we
         owe in back rent to Rumbelows.
Eddie:   They are magic beans, you know.
Richie:  Oh yes. And here... is the magic beanstalk.  [holds up an empty
         flower-pot]  Well I'm glad I've got a head for heights because
         it's a whopper, isn't it? We shall be needing oxygen masks before
         we get to the top of that one, won't we, Sir Edmund?
Eddie:   Well it wasn't me who let us get behind with the rental, was it?
         How did we get eighty-six pounds twenty-three pence behind in the
         first place?
Richie:  [worried]  Err-r-r, all right, all right, let's change the
         subject. It's irrelevant -- in fact I forgive you.
Eddie:   It wasn't me who bypassed Rumbelows every week for the last three
         months, saved up the eighty-six pounds twenty-three pence, and
         took it five doors along to Dr. O'Grady's Personal Organ
         Enhancement Clinic, was it?
Richie:  Eh, cup of tea Eddie? Or some money?
Eddie:   We haven't got any money, that's the problem!
Richie:  Hey, I know, let's have a no-talking competition!
Eddie:   "For a mere eighty-five pounds--"
Richie:  Oh God.
Eddie:   "For a mere eighty-five pounds, you too can have your personal
         organ enhanced so that it is comparable in size to that of a
         fully-grown mountain gorilla."
Richie:  Yes, and when he said "comparable in size" I didn't realise he
         meant "an awful lot smaller than"!
Eddie:   You mean it didn't work?
Richie:  Well, I mean, yes, he did enhance it temporarily. But when it said
         on the door "Revolutionary new enlargement technique", I didn't
         realise he was just going to stick me in a cubicle for half an
         hour with a copy of Razzle! Eighty-five quid! I could have been
         watching Emmerdale Farm now.
Eddie:   Yeah... and then you could have got one for free!  [forearm
         gesture]
Richie:  All right, all right, look. We're both to blame. Why don't we just
         stop talking about it and sit down nicely and watch the -- oh
         bugger!  [sobs]  Oh come on Eddie, this is silly. There must be
         more to life than telly.  [Eddie shrugs blankly]  You're right,
         there isn't!
Eddie:   [sighs]  This is unbearable. We could be missing a Watchdog
         special on faulty bikinis.
Richie:  Oh don't.  [sighs]  Right, come on Eddie. We should try and be
         positive about the lack of telly. We should treat this as an
         educational, spiritual and cultural plus. So... tiddly-winks?
Eddie:   No no no, we ended up in hospital last time, remember?
Richie:  True. Oh, what a sad and tragic waste of a young, attractive life.
         Oohhh.  [leans on the organ, horrible screeching chord]  Hey!
         That's it!  [claps]  What about  "pin the tail on the donkey"?
Eddie:   We haven't got a donkey.
Richie:  Well, ah, "pin the tail on the chicken".
Eddie:   We haven't got a tail.
Richie:  Oh. Well, "pin the sausage on the chicken".
Eddie:   We haven't got a chicken.
Richie:  Well... "pin the sausage on the fridge"!
Eddie:   Or a pin.
Richie:  "Sellotape a sausage to the fridge"!
Eddie:   We haven't got a sausage!
Richie:  "Put a bit of sellotape on the fridge"!
Eddie:   It's not much of a game, is it?
Richie:  What d'you mean, you have to do it blindfold.
Eddie:   But we haven't even got a blindfold!
Richie:  Well then we'll have to improvise, won't we Eddie?

[Richie removes Eddie's glasses, pokes him in the eyes, and replaces the
glasses.]

Richie:  Okay?
Eddie:   [sighs]  All right. Give me a bit of sellotape and I shall stick
         it on the fridge.
Richie:  Here you are. Ooh, look out, it's the last bit, better be careful.

[Eddie sighs, and walks towards the fridge, the sellotape held out in front
of him. He sticks it carefully on the fridge and steps back.]

Eddie:   Is that it then?
Richie:  Yeah.
Eddie:   Who won?
Richie:  Dhoh, ha ha ha ha. Eddie, it matters not who won or lost but how
         you played the game.
Eddie:   Oh, you mean I won? Ha! Ha-ha.  [wets his finger, draws a figure 1
         in the air, waves his hands in the air]
Richie:  Yes, I suppose so, yeah, I mean if it's so important to you, yes.
         Yes, you did win. I mean for heaven's sake, Eddie, it's only a
         game!  [walking away, to himself]  Shit, shit, VD VD VD! Why do I
         bloody lose everything always?  [an idea]  So, ah, you think
         you're good at games do you, big boy? Well what about a real game?
         A game of champions. The clash of the great big minds. The battle
         of the Titans!
Eddie:   You don't mean...
Richie:  Yes!
Eddie:   A "see how much custard you can hold in your underpants"
         competition?
Richie:  Yeah -- no! Although that's a bloody good idea!
Eddie:   Ha-ha.
Richie:  Might come onto that later if my idea doesn't work out.
Eddie:   Okay.
Richie:  Although this time I really think we ought to let the custard cool
         down a little first.
Eddie:   And that handstand rule is a complete disaster.
Richie:  Hmm. Apart from that, bloody good game!
Eddie:   Absolutely. Mind you, you always have a considerable advantage,
         because your underpants are so stupendously huge.
Richie:  Too right matey! Okay, may the best man win!

[Wobbly dream-type transition into the custardy-pants contest. Rik is
staggering about, his stupendously huge underpants full to the brim.]

Richie:  So it's agreed then -- I'm the winner!

[Eddie is sitting on the sofa. There is custard everywhere -- all over him,
dripping from the ceiling...]

Eddie:   Yeah all right.
Richie:  Well I told you not to sit down!

[Wobble back to normal. Eddie and Richie are cleaning up, mopping down the
sofa.]

Richie:  Right. So -- you won the stick-the-piece-of-sellotape-on-the-
         fridge competition and I won the custardy-pants tournament. That
         makes it, er... ooh, one-all. Right. Time for a tie-breaker.
Eddie:   It's ten o'clock now. Probably missing a Late Show special on
         lesbian art.
Richie:  How do you feel about trying your luck, Eddie?
Eddie:   No, I'm not going out now. Even if I did score me underpants are
         all custardy.
Richie:  No, I mean what about a game of... chess?
Eddie:   [looking worried]  Chess?  [looks out of the window]  We haven't
         got a chess set, have we?
Richie:  Of course we have, you silly-billy. There's my antique chess set
         that my great-auntie Dorothy left me.I've got it safely under lock
         and key in my strong-box because it's so valuable. Well don't
         look! I'm getting my key from the secret place.
Eddie:   [whispers]  Behind the radio.

[Richie rummages behind the radio on the shelf.]

Richie:  Hang on a minute, what's the key doing embedded in this cake of
         soap? That's a bit dangerous, isn't it? Someone could take a copy
         of it from that!

[Eddie takes a key from his pocket, holds it up, and swallows it with some
difficulty.]

Richie:  I shall speak to the cleaning lady.
Eddie:   We haven't got a cleaning lady!
Richie:  Well I must get one and speak to her.  [gets out his strong-box]
         Ah, here we are!  [pats it lovingly]  This chess set was at
         Waterloo, you know. Wellington played on it the night before the
         big fight. All the men are carved out of antique ivory, and
         they're worth seventy-five quid each according to my great-aunt
         Dorothy.  [opens it, looks in, slams it shut]  Eddie! Where have
         all the pieces gone?
Eddie:   [clears his throat theatrically]  Pardon?
Richie:  This is ridiculous! There's only five pieces left!
Eddie:   Well, are you sure Wellington put them all back when he'd
         finished?
Richie:  Well of course he did, he wasn't a stupid man, he invented the
         Chelsea boot.
Eddie:   Well, never mind Richie, I'm sure we'll manage somehow. I mean, we
         are British, after all!
Richie:  Yes. That's right Eddie. That's the spirit, haha! I'd like to see
         some spic play a game of chess with only five pieces. Right, what
         colour do you want to be -- black or white?
Eddie:   [peers into the box]  White.
Richie:  Right, you win, there are no black pieces left.
Eddie:   Haha, hurray!
Richie:  Well, that was fun. What shall we do now?
Eddie:   This time we play with a full deck.
Richie:  But we've only got five pieces.
Eddie:   We can use other things for the missing pieces.
Richie:  Hoh, great idea!
Eddie:   Now let's see... we need sixteen prawns. Well we're in luck there,
         we've got a bag in the freezer that are four years past their
         sell-by date, we can use those.
Richie:  Ahhh, oh chess! God I adore chess! I should have been a chess
         champion. If I'd spent my whole life learning how to play chess
         better than everyone else in the world I could have been the chess
         champion. And I look a bit Slavic, don't you think?  [pulls face]
Eddie:   What's this pot of cress doing in the fridge?
Richie:  That's not cress, that's that yoghurt you started during the Gulf
         War.
Eddie:   Well you could have told me! Might as well finish it.
Richie:  Ho, yeah, a bit of chess. Hah, Gad, if only I had a smoking-
         jacket. Eh -- hang on!  [leaves]

[Eddie digs into his pot of greenery, lifts out a spoonful and chews it.]

Eddie:   Doesn't taste like banana and peach.

[Richie comes back in, wearing his raincoat inside-out.]

Richie:  Da-dah! What do you think, Eddie?
Eddie:   I think you've got your raincoat on inside-out. Are you off? I
         thought we were playing chess.
Richie:  No, no, no, it's a smoking-jacket, look, the quilting. All the
         sophisticated people are wearing them.
Eddie:   Well why have you got one on then? Anyway, you don't smoke.
Richie:  And nor does my jacket. Ah-ha, ah-hahaha! Oh God! Oh I feel just
         like Noel Wilde today.

[Eddie puts a bottle of sauce down on the chessboard.]

Eddie:   Right, here we go then. Now, that can be the king. Well it has to
         be, doesn't it? I mean, it's brown sauce.
Richie:  Ah.  [acting]  "Cigarette, my dear?" "Don't mind if I do my dear."
         "Have a bit of a biro to smoke it through." "Oh, ta very much. Mm,
         thought your new play was great, by the way." "Oh, there's only
         one thing better than having a great play, and that's having...
         two great plays." "That doesn't make any sense, Oscar." "I know,
         none of my stuff does you know. Hahaa." "Nice bit of biro by the
         way." "Ta very much."

[He takes a drag of his cigarette, using a biro tube as a holder, breathes
smoke out through his nostrils, and chokes.]

Richie:  [coughing]  Nice.

[Richie's side of the chessboard is populated with a wild assortment of
objects: a plastic skeleton, a tomato-shaped sauce bottle, a sausage, a
cactus wearing a crown, the brown sauce, a Cluedo piece, a bottle of food
colouring, a plastic Spiderman. A row of frozen prawns serve as pawns for
each player. Eddie completes his pieces with a mouldy pear and an apple
pierced by a nail.]

Eddie:   Right then, all set. A little unconventional, but most of it's
         fresh.
Richie:  Hoh, oh Eddie, Eddie this is so sophisticated isn't it?
Eddie:   Ha.
Richie:  I feel just like Lord Byron. And that other bloke, you know, Earl
         Thingy, with the long dressing-gown and the flappy stuff around
         his chin.
Eddie:   Really? 'Cause you look like a stupid git with his raincoat on
         inside out.
Richie:  Oh, Eddie, this is fantastic. Chess is the best idea we ever had.
         And it was one of mine, wasn't it?  [deep breath]  Right, this has
         got to be perfect. It's just two guys, right, no chicks, it's just
         man to man. Cultured. Urbane. Civilised. Male stuff. And I'm not
         being funny. Right, what do we need? Twiglets. You know, high
         society stuff, little dishes of nosey-picks scattered around the
         place.
Eddie:   Olives!
Richie:  Hey Eddie, you're catching on. Great idea!
Eddie:   Erm, we haven't got any olives. What about prunes?
Richie:  Well they look like olives, don't they, and they make you regular!
Eddie:   Tin of prunes coming right up, Mr. Byron.
Richie:  Right! Let's have a cocktail. Right, what would James Bond have?
Eddie:   Well, he'd have a load of birds 'round his gaff, and a corset on
         so no-one would guess he was sixty.
Richie:  Vodka martini, that's it, vodka martini. Shaken about the place
         but not spilt.
Eddie:   Right. Now how d'you make a vodka martini?
Richie:  Err... Well, it's got to have some vodka in it, hasn't it, and,
         er, what about vodka and, erm... martini? Or is that being too
         stupid?
Eddie:   We haven't got any vodka and we haven't got any martini.
Richie:  Oh. Well what have we got?
Eddie:   We've got... a wee drop of Pernod and half a bottle of ouzo.
Richie:  Well that'll do nicely! And don't forget to put a bit of salt
         around the rim.
Eddie:   I beg your pardon?
Richie:  Oh come on Eddie, I know what I'm talking about. Everybody in
         Hollywood does it.
Eddie:   I think I'll just put a bit of salt round the edge of the glass,
         if it's all the same to you.
Richie:  [looking out of the window]  Ah, perfect.  [calls]  Ah-ha-ha-ha-
         haar, watching your tellies are you? Addling your brains? We're
         having an evening of culture and poetry and chess you know, while
         you're sitting there vegetating in front of Emmerdale Farm, you
         poor sad peasants. Ha! What's happened by the way? Has Matt sorted
         out that problem with Amos in t'top field? ...Pardon? ...No I have
         not, it's a smoking-jacket! You ignorant git!

[Richie closes the window and takes off his raincoat. He walks over to the
table.]

Richie:  Eddie, it's a shame we have to live in this area, it really is.
         Hoh! Have we got any glace cherries?
Eddie:   No, I don't think we have.
Richie:  Well, bung a blob of marmalade in then, no-one will know.
Eddie:   A little taste...  [sips]  Dhhhhh! Ha-aaah! Right, here you go,
         skip-matey me old flapper, and the very best of luck to you, and I
         mean that very very sincerely.
Richie:  Right! Cheers. Ooh no, before you start drinking, as this is a
         special occasion, I -- ooh, do you think we should dim the lights?
Eddie:   Erm, well, we haven't got a dimmer. Shall I get my hammer?
Richie:  No, no no, we'll just narrow our eyes a bit.
Eddie:   Alright.
Richie:  Right.  [through slitted eyes]  Where are you?
Eddie:   I think I'm over here.
Richie:  Oh, there you are, right right right. Now, as I was saying, as
         this is a special occasion, and we've invented a new cocktail for
         ourselves -- Pernod, ouzo, marmalade and salt -- I think we should
         think of a special name for it. What do you think?
Eddie:   What about the, er, oh, the Bloody... Awful.
Richie:  Oh come on Eddie, take it seriously...
Eddie:   Oh, got it! The Esther Rantzen.
Richie:  E-- why?
Eddie:   Because it pulls your gums back over your teeth.
Richie:  All right then, the Esther Rantzen it is. Cheers!
Both:    [drink]  Dhhhhhh! Hhh, hhh...
Eddie:   "And on tonight's programme, an interesting misprint that says
         'penis'."
Richie:  Dhh, ho-hwooh, I see what you mean, yeah, hwooo, hhh. It's sort of
         lacking something, isn't it? Ah, mm, have we got any umbrellas?
Eddie:   Coming right up.
Richie:  [takes another sip]  Dhhh!  [gags]

[Eddie comes back with two full-size umbrellas.]

Eddie:   Here we go.
Richie:  Ah!

[They open an umbrella each and sit underneath them.]

Richie:  Oh, this is the life Eddie. Sophisticated living, gentlemen's
         rooms.
Eddie:   Yes. Here we are, underneath our umbrellas, drinking ouzo and
         salt, each behind his line of frozen prawns. That's what I love
         about you Richie.
Richie:  What?
Eddie:   You're completely insane!
Richie:  Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-haaaah! Ah-ha-ha-ho, wl-wl-wl-wl-wll-l-l-l!
         Oh gosh, I feel great! Of course, you know why I never got
         married, don't you?
Eddie:   Yep.
Richie:  Yeah, tragic isn't it?
Eddie:   No. Right, shall we get started?
Richie:  Right!

[Eddie reaches out his hand to move...]

Richie:  Oh no! Wait! I know what we need. Music! Of course. What could be
         better? What shall we have, oooh, James Last? Burt Bacharach?
         Oh... Moliere! Moliere! Oh, he could bash out a tune or two. Tum-
         tum tiddly-tum tum-tum-tum, tum -- and the other twiddly bits. He
         was Scottish you know.
Eddie:   Who, Vivaldi?
Richie:  No Eddie, I'm talking about composers. Honestly, it's football
         football football with you, isn't it? Hey, do you remember that
         night those girls turned up?
Eddie:   No.
Richie:  Yeah, it was a shame, wasn't it? Mind you, they bloody nearly did.
Eddie:   I think your mistake, Richie, was in turning out the lights on the
         steps and shouting out "Grab hold of this, it's the banisters."
Richie:  Worth a try, Eddie, worth a try. Hhhrrrrrrgh! Great days.
Eddie:   No they weren't.
Richie:  No, they weren't, were they?  [sighs]  Well you have to say that,
         don't you? Come on, hhhrrrrgh, great days!
Eddie:   [limply]  Rrrr, great days.
Richie:  Yes they were! Ha, come on, let's go out!
Eddie:   I though we were playing chess, Mr. Bond?
Richie:  Oh, yes, of course. Chess, wonderful chess. Ha-haaa. Hey, did I
         ever tell you about that time my great-uncle Roderick drowned in
         the Ugugu River?
Eddie:   No.
Richie:  Oh good, it's rather embarrassing. Hoh! Right, let's get on. Ooh,
         I feel great, bbrr, let's have a dance, ho-hoo, ho-hoo...
Eddie:   Richie, sit down! You're getting over-excited.
Richie:  Oh! Yes, right. Yes, of course. Ha, hrr, ha, hmm, sit down, yeah,
         hm, good idea. Hm, ahh. Okay. This is it. Everything's ready. Are
         you ready Eddie?
Eddie:   Yep.
Richie:  Right, all set.

[Eddie reaches out to move.]

Richie:  Ooh, one more thing?
Eddie:   What?
Richie:  How do you actually play chess?
Eddie:   You don't know how to play chess.
Richie:  Well, no. Ah-ha. But I know how to ride a bike so I'm sure I'll
         pick it up pretty quick, you know. Just tell me which pieces are
         mine and which way around the board we go. Do we get any money or
         anything?

[Eddie sighs and puts his head in his hands.]


Scene 2. The Flat, Later.
-------------------------

Richie:  Right. Let's just go through the rules one more time and then we
         can start properly.

[Eddie sighs heavily.]

Richie:  Now how does the racehorse move again?
Eddie:   It's not a racehorse, it's a knight.
Richie:  Where's the knight then?
Eddie:   Well he must have fallen off.
Richie:  He's not much of a knight then, is he?
Eddie:   Look, just put it back please.
Richie:  All right, all right... And that one's called a rook.
Eddie:   Yes.
Richie:  Why, does it nest in trees?
Eddie:   No, it's a castle.
Richie:  But it's called a rook.
Eddie:   Yes, some people call it a rook.
Richie:  Well which people? Blind ones?
Eddie:   [thinks]  Yes.
Richie:  Oh I see, I see, right. ...But the castle can move, you say?
Eddie:   That's right.
Richie:  Even though it hasn't got any legs.
Eddie:   Yes.
Richie:  Pfft, hahaha. It's not very likely, is it Eddie.  [holds up a
         sausage]  And this, this is also a bishop, you say.
Eddie:   Yes.
Richie:  And he bends sideways.
Eddie:   Correct.
Richie:  Well, there's no surprise there. Wonder what the Church is coming
         to these days. Right, let me get this sorted out. Now the bent
         vicar stands next to the queen.  [holds up cactus with crown]  And
         the queen goes in every direction.
Eddie:   That's right.
Richie:  And they let children play this, you say? I mean, it's pretty
         strong stuff, isn't it Eddie? You know, knights taking prawns, and
         apparently if a prawn goes all the way he turns into a queen!
Eddie:   Shut up Richie and play the game!
Richie:  Okay, okay, let's go.  [Eddie sighs]  Hey, I know! Let's pretend
         that I'm James Bond, right, and you're, you're one of the baddies,
         you know, Q or whoever, and if I lose I have to die.
Eddie:   [looks up]  Fair enough.
Richie:  Yeah, great. Yeah, we should have loads and loads of birds around
         the place, you know, all like Ursula Andress, you know, and
         everyone's in bikinis. Ah, I'll tell you what, shall I get some of
         my magazines out?
Eddie:   Richie! I've been here since ten o'clock last night. It's now five
         o'clock in the morning. We've finished off the Pernod, the ouzo,
         the Old Spice, even the industrial strength floor cleaner. Three
         litres of it. I've explained the rules of chess to you one hundred
         and twenty-four times, and I'm buggered if I'm going to let you
         delay the game another ten minutes while you scan though a few
         back copies of Amateur Photographer! Okay? Right. King's prawn to
         king's prawn four.

[He slams his hand down on the clock at the side of the door, smashing it
flat.]

Richie:  Why d'you have to do that?
Eddie:   Shut up, it's your move!
Richie:  My move? Okay.

[Richie studies the board as if sizing up and opponent, moving back and
walking from side to side. He walks out of the door and comes back in
through the other door, still pondering. He sits back down at the table.]

Richie:  Yes... yes... Am I black or white?
Eddie:   You're black!
Richie:  Oh.
Eddie:   You're those ones there!
Richie:  Oh right.
Eddie:   The ones in next to you!
Richie:  Right.
Eddie:   Now make your move!
Richie:  All right, all right, don't hustle me. I know your tactics.  [to
         himself]  Okay, right, this is it. What would Napoleon do? Lose
         the battle of Waterloo, that's no good to me. Right, this is it,
         only one thing for it. Attack! Attack! Attack! Over the top lads!
         Charge!  [machine-gun noise]  Argh, I'm hit! Oh, oh, get him back!
         No, leave me here. Oh, my arms and legs have come off. Oh, oh the
         blood! Oh the horror! I'm getting out of here. Shoot that prawn!
         [shot noise]  Arrrrghhh! Right, everybody, follow me. Du-du-du-du-
         daa. I can't follow you, I'm a bishop, I have to go sideways. Du-
         du-du-du-aaarrhhgh!  [machine-gun]  Hurray, it's the Queen's Own
         Ketchup!

[Richie squirts ketchup out of the plastic tomato over the board, making
machine-gun and explosion noises. He notices Eddie watching him and his
noises become more uncertain and die away. He puts the tomato down, hits
the flattened clock, and gestures.]

Eddie:   That's your move, is it?
Richie:  Yep. Get out of that one, Rommel.

[Eddie looks at the board and sighs. He picks up his queen, moves it to the
side of the board, then forward, then back, dancing it all around the
board, and then gathers up all the pieces and sweeps them towards himself.]

Eddie:   Check-mate.

[Richie punches him. Eddie falls backwards off his chair. The chess pieces
fly out of his arms. He staggers to his feet and pushes the table over. Its
edge lands on Richie's toes.]

Richie:  Aaaargh, aaargh, aaargh!

[Eddie hits him with a chair. He gets up, holding an umbrella, fingering
the tip., and advances towards Eddie. Eddie holds the broken frame of the
chair like a shield but Richie drives the umbrella in underneath it, into
his groin.]

Eddie:   Aaaaaaahhh!

[Richie drives him backwards, opening and closing the umbrella, backing him
against the fridge. Eddie manages to pick up a frying-pan and beat him off.
He pulls the umbrella out of his groin, holds it up to inspect it, and
notices that the tip is missing. He looks at the camera, shocked, then
beats Richie with the frying-pan. Richie ends up kneeling in front of the
fridge. Eddie grabs him by the hair.]

Richie:  Oh, no, no!

[Eddie slams the fridge door repeatedly on Richie's head. He looks round,
smiling.]

Eddie:   You know, it's funny. They say that television encourages
         violence. But I'm smashing his face in, and we haven't got one!

[Richie struggles to his feet, face bruised and nose bleeding.]

Richie:  Well that's where he's wrong, listeners, 'cause in fact we do have
         a telly. And here it is!
Eddie:   Well where did that come from?
Richie:  It was behind the fridge all the time. I hid it when the chaps
         from Rumbelows came round.
Eddie:   Well why didn't you tell me? I could have been watching television
         all night.
Richie:  Well I don't know, I thought it would be interesting, you know, to
         spend an evening without the telly for once. We could chat a bit
         more. You know, it's good for our relationship, to get a bit of
         interaction going.
Eddie:   Well... if it's interaction you want... cop a load of this matey!

[Eddie smashes the television down over Richie's head. Freeze-frame, roll
credits.]
