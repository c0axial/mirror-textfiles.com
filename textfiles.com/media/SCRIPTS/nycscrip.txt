              General Information: 
          Audience instructions are in square brackets.  Text in  
quotes is to be shouted.  The instruction 'Echo' indicates that the  
following line is to be shouted in unison with the film.  
  
          Whenever Brad appears, or, especially, introduces himself, 
the line "Asshole!" is appropriate.  With more discretion, the line 
"Slut!" is appropriate to Janet.  Whenever the Narrator (Charles  
Gray) appears, the following lines and variants are appropriate: "He's  
got no neck!"; "Bo-ring!"; "Charles Gray, he's O.K.!".  Dr. Scott may be  
booed.

           Note:  all audience lines are taken from the New York ones 
-- 8th Street Playhouse and Eastside Cinema -- with the exception of 
a very few of them. --Tina M.]

    [at opening bars of music,  
    "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, God said, 'Let there be  
     Lips', and they were.  And they were good."]  

Usherette(lips): Michael Rennie was ill 
            The Day the Earth Stood still 
            But he told us where we stand.  ["On our feet!"] 
            And Flash Gordon was there 
            In silver [echo: "purple"] underwear, ["Pervert!"]
            Claude Rains was the Invisible Man. 
            ["Outta sight!"]
            Then something went wrong 
            For Fay Wray and King Kong; 
            They got caught in a celluloid jam. ["Yay jam!"]
            Then at a deadly pace 
            It Came From... ["where?"] Outer Space. ["Thank you!"]
            And this is how the message ran: 
            ["Freeze!"]

Usherette(lips): I knew Leo G. Carrol 
            Was over [echo: "fucking"] a barrel 
            When Tarantula took to the hills. ["Lick it!"] 
            And I really got hot 
            When I saw Jeanette Scott  [echo: "Janet's twat"]
            Fight a triffid that spits poison and kills.
            ["What the fuck is a triffid?"]
            Dana Andrews said Prunes 
            Gave him the runes [Echo: "...shits"]

            Said George Powell to his bride,

            To the late night, double feature, picture show! 
 
Dentonian:  Here they come! (Dentonians cheer and throw rice) [throw RICE] 
  
Photographer: Let's get a picture.  Close together now.  The parents and 
            then the grandparents. Just of the close family.  Ahhh, 
            hold that.  Beautiful.  And... (snap) 
  
Ralph:      I guess we really did it, huh. ["Hit him!  Hit him back!"]
  
Brad:       I don't think there's any doubt about that. You and Betty have 
            been almost inseparable since you met in Dr. Scott's refresher 
            courses. 
  
Ralph:      Well to tell you the truth, Brad, that's the only reason I 
            showed up in the first place. (chuckles) 
  
Betty:      O.K. you guys, this is it. (everyone screams) 
  
Ralph:      Well Betty's going to throw the bouquet.  [throw BOUQUET] 
  
Janet:      ["Hey, Janet, do you have syph?"] I got it!  I got it! 
  
Ralph:      Hey big fella,["How would you know?"] looks like it could be 
            your turn next, eh? 
  
Brad:       Who knows. ["The Shadow knows!"] 
  
Ralph:      Well, so long, see you Brad.  ["See ya, sucker!"]  
            Guess we better get get going now Betty. 
            Come on, hop in.  (they drive away) 

["Think about it Asshole...this finger smells like Janet."]

[read sign: "Be just and fear not.  Be stoned and feel not!"] 

[When couple is seen running after the car: "Aw, shit, missed the bus 
 again!"]

Janet:      Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful? ["No"]  Didn't Betty look radiantly 
            beautiful?  ["No"]  I can't believe it.  An hour ago she was 
            just plain old Betty Monroe, and now...["Now she's a slut"] now 
            she's Mrs. Ralph Hapshatt.     (sigh) 
            ["Hapshit, will travel!"]
  
Brad:       Yes Janet, Ralph is a lucky guy. ["No he's not, she's got syph."]
  
Janet:      Yes. 
  
Dentonian:  I always cry at weddings.  ["I always laugh at funerals!"] 

Brad:       Everyone knows that Betty is a wonderful little cook. 
            ["She's the hottest baked potato in Denton...yay Denton!  The
            home of happiness.  What's a sign doing in a graveyard?  
            Advertising!  Hey, that sign has a heart-on!"]

Janet:      Yes. 

Brad:       Why Ralph himself, he'll be up for a promotion in a year or two. 
            ["If he doesn't get busted first!"] 

Janet:      Yes. 

            DAMMIT JANET 

Brad:       Hey Janet.  ["Sit on my face and wiggle!"]

Janet:      Yes Brad? 

Brad:       I've got something to say. 
  
Janet:      Uh huh. 

            ["Say it, Asshole!"] 

Brad:       I really love the... ["Starts with an S...sku...sku..."] skillful 
            way ["What a fuckin' genius!"]... you beat the other girls... 
            ["With whips and chains"] to the bride's bouquet. ["And
            that too."] 

Janet:      Oh Brad. 

            [audience echoes 'Janet's, 'Oh Brad's, 'Dammit, Janet's, and 'Brad 
            I'm Mad'] 

Brad:       The river was deep but I swam it. (Janet) 
            The future is ours so let's plan it. (Janet) 
            So please, don't tell me to can it. (Janet) 
            I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet I love you. 

            The road was long but I ran it. ["Backwards!"]
            There's a fire in my heart and you fan it. (Janet) 
            If there's one fool for you then I am it. (Janet) 
            I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet I love you. 

            Here's a ring to prove that I'm no joker. 
            There's three ways that love can woo. ["Sex, drugs and rock
            and roll"]
            That's good, bad, or mediocre. ["gay, straight, and mediocre"]
            ["How do you spell slut?"]
            Oh, J-A-N-E-T I love you so. [Echo: "I want a blow"]
            ["Don't drop it!"] 

["Can we have some black flowers please?"]

Janet:      Oh, it's nicer than Betty Monroe had. (Oh Brad) 
            Now we're engaged and I'm so glad (Oh Brad) 
            That you met Mom and you know Dad. (Oh Brad) 
            [Echo above line: "...you fuck Mom and you blow Dad"]
            I've one thing to say and that's Brad, I'm mad, for you too. 

            Oh Brad... 

Brad:       Oh... dammit. [Echo: "Oh...shit."]

Janet:      I'm mad... 

Brad:       Oh, Janet.  [Echo: "Oh...shit."]

Janet:      For you. 

Brad:       I love you too. [Echo: "I want to screw"]

Brad & Janet: There's one thing left to do - ah - oo. ["Bury a midget!"]

Brad:       And that's go see the man who began it. (Janet) 
            ["He's in the box!"]
            When we met in his science exam - it (Janet) 
            ["He's STILL in the box!"]
            Made me give you the eye and then panic. (Janet) 
            [Echo above line as: "...piss in my pants and then panic"]
            Now I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet, I love you. 
            Dammit, Janet. 

Janet:      Oh Brad, I'm mad. 

Brad:       Dammit, Janet. 

Brad & Janet: I love you. 

["The man you are about to see has no fucking neck.  Where's your fucking 
neck?"  "It's in his other fucking suit."]

Narrator:   I would like ["You would, would you?"], ah, if I may, ["You may 
            not!"]...to take you ["Where?"] on a strange journey.  ["How 
            strange was it?" As Chucky pulls out book:  "It was so strange 
            they made a movie out of it; not the book, the movie."]  It 
            seemed a fairly ordinary night ["ordinary?"] when Brad Majors 
            ["Asshole!"] and his fiancee Janet Weiss ["slut!"], two young, 
            normal, healthy  kids ["Normal?"], left Denton that late November 
            evening, to visit a Dr. Everett Scott ["Snot" (boos & hisses)], 
            ex-tutor, and now friend to both of them.  ["Is it true that 
            you're constipated?"]  It's true there were dark storm clouds... 
            ["Describe your balls!"] heavy, black, and pendulous, towards 
            which they were driving.  ["Is it true also that your mother's a 
            dyke?"] It's true, also, that the spare tire they were carrying 
            was badly in need of some air ["So's your fucking neck!"], but, 
            uh, they being normal kids, ["Normal?"] on a night out... well, 
            they weren't going to let a storm spoil the rest of their 
            evening, were they?  ["Certainly not"] ...On a night out... 
            ["Come a little bit closer, Chuckie..."] it was a night out 
            they were going to remember... ["How long?"] for a very long 
            time. ["What a fucking drip."]

["Hey Dick, have you ever been a quitter?"]

Nixon:      I have never been a quitter...["bullshit!"]  To leave office
            before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my
            body.  ["You call that a body?"]  But as President ["You call
            that a President?"] I must put the interests of America first.
            ["What does America need, Dick?"]  America needs a full time
            president...["What else?"] and a full time Congress...
 
Janet:      Gosh, that's the third motorcycle that's passed us. 
            They sure do take their lives in their hands, what with the 
            weather and all. 
  
Brad:       ["Say something stupid, Asshole!"] 
            Yes, life's pretty cheap to that type. ["So's Janet"]
  
Janet:      Oh. ...What's the matter, Brad darling? 

Brad:       ["Make a sound like a cow!"]  Mmm.
            We must have taken the wrong fork a few miles back. ["Asshole!"]
  
Janet:      Oh, but where did that motorcyclist come from?  ["Japan"; or hum 
            a few bars of the Twilight Zone theme]

Brad:       Hmmm... well I guess we'll just have to turn back. 
                    ["Look out!"]  (BOOM) 
  
Janet:      Oh! What was that bang?  ["A gang-bang!"]
  
Brad:       We must have a blowout.  DAMMIT!  I knew I should have 
            gotten that spare tire fixed. ["Asshole!"]  Well, you just stay  
            here and keep warm and I'll go for help. 
  
Janet:      But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere... 
  
Brad:       ["What's white and sells hamburgers and tastes like shit?"]
            Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  
            [general cheers] Maybe they have a telephone we could use. 
            ["Castles don't have phones, Asshole!"]  
 
Janet:      I'm going with you. 
  
Brad:       Oh, no, darling, there's no sense in both of us getting wet. 
            ["Janet's already wet!"]
  
Janet:      I'm coming with you!  ["That'll be a first!"]  Besides darling, 
            the owner of that phone might be a beautiful woman, ["He is!"] and 
            you might never come back again.  ["You should be so lucky."] 
  
Brad:       Heh, heh, heh, heh. 
  
            [they get out of the car "Kick it!".  NEWSPAPERS over heads,  
            squirt WATER] 
            ["Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch!"]
  
            OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE 

[When sign saying 'Enter at your own risk' is shown: "Can we have a 
 close-up on that sign please? --thank you.  I still can't read it -- 
 can you light it up for me?"  And when lightning flashes on sign, 
 "Thank you."]

["Watch out for the slut-eating tree!" -- right before Janet ducks a 
 tree branch.  Or, alternatively, "Turn around, bitch, I can't read 
 the sports page!"]

Janet:      ["Sing, bitch!"]
            In the velvet darkness, 
            Of the blackest night, 
            Burning bright, ["What's up your ass?"] there's a guiding star.
            ["That must hurt."] 
            No matter what or who you are. 
  
Brad & Janet: There's a light... [light MATCHES on 'light'] 
  
Chorus:     Over at the Frankenstein place. 
  
Brad & Janet: There's a light... 

            ["Where do you keep your grandmother?"]
  
Chorus:     Burning in the fireplace... 
  
            [MATCHES out on 'darkness' - "Darkness!" if any lights still on] 
Brad & Janet: There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life. 
  
            ["Sing to us, O hairless one!"] 

Riff Raff:  The darkness must go down the river of night's dreaming. 
            Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming 
            Into my life.  Into my life... ["It's the Incredible  
            Shrinking Riff Raff!"  "Watch that quicksand, Riff..."] 
  
Brad & Janet: There's a light...  [MATCHES again] 
  
Chorus:     Over at the Frankenstein place. 
  
Brad & Janet: There's a light... 

            ["Where's Santa Claus?"]
  
Chorus:     Burning in the fireplace. 
            There's a light, a light 
  
Brad & Janet: [off at 'Darkness'] ...in the darkness of everybody's life. 
  
            (in the stage version right after the first chorus Brad has this 
            extra verse: 
  
Brad:       I can see the flag fly 
            I can see the rain 
            Just the same, there has got to be 
            Something better here for you and me. 
  
            (repeat chorus)) 

["And Betsy Ross used to sit home and sew and sew and..."]  

Narrator:   And so, it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet and 
            that they had found the assistance that their plight required. 
            ["Are you sure?"] ...Or had they?  ["Nyah-ha-ha"]
  
Janet:      Brad, let's go back, I'm cold and frightened... 
  
Brad:       Just a moment Janet, they might have a phone. 
            ["It's Scooby-Doo in bondage!"]
            (doorbell rings, door creaks open)  ["Ding-dong, asshole calling"]

Riff Raff:  ["How do you say 'jell-o' in Spanish?"]
            Hello. 
  
Brad:       Hi! My name is Brad Majors, and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. 
            I wonder if you could help us.  You see, our car broke down 
            a few miles up the road... do you have a phone we might use? 
            ["Look between Janet's legs!"]
  
Riff Raff:  You're wet.  

Janet:      ["Hey Janet. are you a slut?"]  
            Yes - ["What's the weather?"] it's raining. ["No shit"] 
  
Bard:       ["Are you an asshole, Brad?"]
            Yes. 

Riff Raff:  ["Are you on drugs, Riff?"]  
            Yes... I think perhaps you better both ["get lost"] come inside. 
            ["I don't care where you come, as long as you clean it up" "I don't 
            care if you clean it up, as long as you come"]

Janet:      You're too kind.  Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of a place 
            is this? 
  
Brad:       Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos. 
            ["Yay, rich weirdos!"]

Janet:      Oh (forlornly) 
  
["Hey Riff, show us how you finger your sister"]

Riff Raff:  ["Which way?"] This way. ["Follow the bouncing thumb"]
  
Janet:      Are you having a party? ["No, it's my sister's bas mitzvah" 
            or "Do you see any fucking Tupperware?" -- depends on 
            where you are]
  
Riff Raff:  You've arrived on a very special night.  It's one of the 
            master's affairs.  ["Which one?"]
  
Janet:      Oh lucky him. 
  
Magenta:    You're lucky, He's lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky!  
            ["The banister's lucky!" instead of "we're all lucky"] 
            ha ha ha ha ha      

            ["Hey Riff, show us your Mummy!"]  
  
            THE TIME WARP 
  
Riff Raff:  It's astounding; 
            Time is fleeting; 
            Madness ["sucks"] takes its toll.

Magenta:    ["How long?"] Not for very much longer. 

Riff Raff:  ["How many balls do you have?"]  
            I've got to ["I've got three"] keep control.

Riff Raff:  With a bit of a mind flip

Riff Raff:  And nothing can ever be the same. 
  
Magenta:    You're spaced out on sensation. 
  
Riff Raff:  Like you're under sedation.

Columbia:   Well I was walking down the street just having a think 
            When this snake of a guy gave me an evil wink. 
            He shook me up, he took me by surprise 
            He had a pickup truck, and the devil's eyes. 
            He stared at me and I felt a change. 
            Time meant nothing, never would again.

Janet:      This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Brad. 

Brad:       They're probably foreigners with ways different than our own.

Frank:      How do you do, I 
            See you've met my 
            Faithful handyman. 

            He's just a little brought down 
            Because when you knocked 
            He thought you were the candyman. 

            Don't get strung out ["like a tampon"] by the way I look. 
            Don't judge a book by its cover. 
            I'm not much of a man by the light of day 
            But by night I'm one hell of a lover.  

            I'm just a sweet transvestite 
            From Transexual, Transylvania. 

            Let me show you around 
            Maybe play you a sound. 
            You look like you're both pretty groovy. ["Bull shit!"]
            Or if you want something visual 
            That's not too abysmal, 
            We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie. ["Who the fuck

            We're both in a bit of a hurry. 

Janet:      ["left"] Right.["left"]

            Isn't really to blame. ["No, Sue's to Blame (Blane)!"]

Janet:      Oh!  Brad! 

Brad:       It's all right Janet.  We'll play along for now and pull 
            out the aces when the time is right. 

Columbia:   Slowly, slowly! It's too nice a job to rush. ["Yay rush!"]

Brad:       Hi, my name is Brad Majors, and this is my fiancee, 
            Janet Weiss; ["Spell urinate!"] you are... 

Columbia:   You're very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory. 
            Some people would give their right arm for the privilege. ["Or
            their left tit"]

Janet:      Is he - Frank, I mean - your husband? 

Riff Raff:  The master is not yet married, nor do I expect he ever

            Goddammit, a reasonable request which you've chosen to ignore. 

Janet:      Brad, don't be ungrateful. 

Brad:       Ungrateful! [when Brad removes his glasses, "It's Superman!"  
            or, "Super Brad!"] 

Frank:      How forceful you are, Brad.  Such a perfect specimen of manhood. 
            So...["big"] dominant (crowd has flurry of laughs).

Janet:      No. (giggling) 

Riff Raff:  Everything is in readiness, master.  We merely await your

            And soon in the gym with a determined chin,

            A saxophone was blowing on a rock 'n roll show. 
            You climbed in the back seat, you really had a good time.

            My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled. 
            My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt. 
            I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt 
            And she'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine. 
            Get back in front, put some hair oil on 
            Buddy Holly was singing his very last song. 
            With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along.

Narrator:   ["I say that life is an illusion."]  
            There are those that say that life is an illusion ["like 
            your neck"], and that reality is but a figment of the imagination 
            ["So's your fucking neck!"].  If this is so, then Brad and Janet 
            are quite safe, ["So's your neck"] ... however, the sudden 
            departure of their host...and his ["neck"] creation...into the 
            seclusion of his somber bridal suite ["Sweet!"] had left them 
            feeling both ["Neckless"] apprehensive and uneasy, a feeling 
            which grew ["unlike your neck!"] as the other guests departed, and 
            they were shown to their separate rooms. 

            (Janet and Brad are shown to their rooms by Riff Raff and Magenta.) 
            ["Pink is for sluts... watch out for the basin ...

Janet:      Uhh! Who is it? Who's there? 

Frank (Brad): ["It's the plumber, I've come to fix the basin"]  It's only 
            me, Janet. 

Janet:      Oh, Brad darling, come in. ["and out, and in, and out"]
            Oh! Brad Oh Brad.  Yes, my darling...but what if... 

Frank (Brad): ["Don't worry, I brought a rubber!"]  
             It's all right, Janet, everything's going to be alright. 

Janet:      ["Don't touch the hair!"]  
            Oh, I hope so, my darling.  Oh...Ah...ahh OHHH! Oh it's you! 

Frank:      I'm afraid so, Janet, but isn't it nice... 

Janet:      Oh, you beast, you monster...Oh what have you done with Brad? 
            ["Nothing yet, he's saving the best for last"]

Frank:      Oh, well, nothing.  Why, do you think I should? 

Janet:      You tricked...I wouldn't have...I've never..never... 

Frank:      Yes, yes I know, but it isn't all bad, is it?  ["It isn't 
            all Brad, either"]  I think you really found it quite pleasurable. 

Janet:      Oh, stop...I mean help...Brad Brad!..Oh Brad!! ["Brad's not down
            there...Brad's never been down there!"]

Frank:      Shhh. Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you 
            like...This! 

Janet:      Like this..like how??! Oh, it's your fault...you're to blame... 
            ["No, Sue's to blame; can't you read the fucking credits?"] 
            Oh...I was saving myself... ["For what, a rainy day?  Well,

Brad:       Like this, like how? It's your fault, you're to blame, I thought 
            it was the real thing!

Frank:      Oh come on, Brad, admit it, you liked it, didn't you?  It isn't 
            a crime to give yourself over to pleasure, Brad. ["It is in New 
            Jersey"] We've wasted so much time already...Janet needn't know,

            from what Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their television  
            monitor there seemed little doubt that Janet was, indeed, ["a 
            nymphomaniac"]... its slave. 

Magenta and Columbia: [echo] Tell us about it, Janet.

Janet:      I thought there's no use getting ["laid"]

            And seat wetting. ["Yay wet seats", or "Hey, this seat's wet!"]

Frank:      ["What's your favorite fruit drink?"]
            I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here 
            with a purpose. [Echo: "...with a porpoise."]

Brad:       Dr. Scott! 

Dr. Scott:  Brad! What are you doing here? ["Oh, just fucking around"]

Frank:      Don't play games, Dr. Scott.  You know perfectly well what 
            Brad Majors is doing here. ["Getting good head"] It was part of 
            your plan, was it not?  That he and his female should check the 
            layout for you ["or lay the checkout"].  Well, unfortunately for 
            you all, the plans are to be changed.  You must be adaptable, Dr. 
            Scott; I know Brad is. {"Aw, you promised you wouldn't tell!"]

Dr. Scott:  I can assure you that Brad's presence here comes as a complete 
            surprise to me ["didn't you read the script?"].  I came here to 
            find Eddy. 

Brad:       Eddy!  I've seen him! 

Frank:      Eddy!  What do you know of Eddy, Dr. Scott? 

Dr. Scott:  ["Get conceited!"]

Frank:      ["What do you think of oral sex?"]
            Excellent.  Under the circumstances, formal dress is to be 
            optional. ["To-ga, to-ga..."]

Narrator:   Food has always played a vital role in Life's rituals. 
            The breaking of the bread, the last meal of the condemned man, and 
            now... this meal.  However informal it might appear, you can be

Dr. Scott:  It's all right! 

Brad:       Doctor Scott!

            EDDY 

            ["How long was he gay?"]
            From the day he was born ["Not the night but the day"] 
            He was trouble.  ["Not Monopoly but Trouble"] 
            He was the thorn  ["Not the rose but the thorn"] 
            In his mother's side. ["Not the back, but the side"] 
            She tried in vain... ["Not the artery but the vein"]

Scott:      He left home the day she died. 
            ["Hit it!", or "Rockin' Scott!"] 
            From the day she was gone ["Bop shebop bop"] 
            All he wanted ["Was Dr. Scott's cock"] 
            Was Rock 'n' Roll porn  ["and Dr. Scott's cock" "It's a naked

            And a motorbike. ["Whoooooo..."]
            Shooting up junk... ["What was he?"]

Columbia:   Everybody shoved him. 
            I very nearly loved him. 
            I said, hey, listen to me; 
            Stay sane inside insanity! 
            But he locked the door and threw away the key. 

Scott:      But he must have been drawn  ["Not colored but drawn"]
            Into something, ["What the fuck's a zum-zing?"]

            WISE UP 

            I'll tell you once;  I won't tell you twice. 
            You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. 
            Your apple pie don't taste too nice. 
            You'd better wise up, Janet Weiss. 

            I've laid the seed; it should be all you need. 
            You're as sensual as a pencil, wound up like an E or first string. 
            When we made it, didja hear a bell ring? [ring BELL] 

            Ya gotta block?  Well, take my advice. 
            You better wise up, Janet Weiss. 
            The transducer will seduce ya. 

Janet:      My feet!  I can't move my feet! 

Scott:      My wheels!  My God, I can't move my wheels! [Echo: "My God, I can't 
            feel my face!"]

Brad:       ["My socks!"] It's as if we're glued to the spot! 

Frank:      You are! ["Nyah-nah nah nah nah"]  So quake with fear, you tiny 
            fools!

Janet:      We're trapped! 

Frank:      (sung)  It's something you'll get used to.  A mental mind fuck 
            can be nice. 

Scott:      You won't find Earth people quite the easy mark you imagine. 
            This sonic transducer...it is, I suppose, some kind of 
            audio-vibratory, physio-molecular transport device? 

Brad:       [echo] You mean... ["A vibrator!"] 

Scott:      Yes, Brad, it's something we ourselves have been working on 
            for quite some time ["a working vibrator"].  But it seems our 
            friend here has found a means of perfecting it ["the perfect 
            vibrator"].  A device capable of breaking down solid matter and 
            then projecting it through space and, who knows, perhaps even 
            time itself. 

Janet:      You mean he's going to send us to another planet? 

Frank:      [echo] Planet, shmanet, Janet!

            ["So sit down"]  First you spurn me for Eddy, and then you 
            throw him off like an old overcoat for Rocky!  You chew people

            And what did it get me? ["A hole in your shirt!"]  Yeah, I'll 
            tell you - a big nothing.  ["At least it was big!"]  You're 
            like a sponge.  You take, take, take, and drain others of their 
            love and emotion.  Yeah, well, I've had enough! ["Peek-a-boo!"]
            You're gonna choose between me and Rocky, so named because of the 
            rocks in his head. ["Nobody flashes their tit at me and

Magenta:    Ahhhh!  I grow weary of this world!  When shall we return 
            to Transylvania, huh? ["When you can say your W's, bitch!"]

Frank:      Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both you and your brother 
            Riff Raff.  You have both served me well.  Loyalty such as yours 
            shall not go unrewarded.  You will discover that when the mood 
            takes me, I can be quite generous. 

Magenta:    I ask for nothing ["under 12 inches"]...nothing. 

Frank:      And you shall receive it...in abundance! ["What tastes good on 
            corn flakes?"] Come, we are ready for the floor show.

            ["Hey, where are Magenta's eyeballs?"]

Narrator:   And so, by some extraordinary co-incidence, fate, it seemed, 
            had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with 
            their friend, Dr. Everett Scott.  But it was to be in a situation  
            which none of them would have possibly forseen.  And, just a few  
            hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both  
            tasted ["Frank's cock"] ...forbidden fruit.["same thing"]  
            This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little 
            morals ["yay, little morals!"]...and some persuasion. 
            ["Yay, some persuasion"] What further indignities were they to be 
            subjected to?  And what of the floor show that is spoken of?  
            ["Yay floor show" ... "Where do you masturbate?"] In an empty

            ["Rates are cheaper"] What diabolical plan had seized Frank's 
            crazed imagination? What indeed?  From what had gone before, it 
            was clear that this was to be... ["Can we have a picnic?"] no

            (Frank is running around making preparations while the others are

Columbia:   It was great when it all began. ["Hip, hip"]
            I was a regular Frankie fan. 
            But it was over when he had the plan 
            To start a-working on a muscle man. 
            Now the only thing that gives me hope ["is smoking dope"]
            Is my love of a certain dope. 
            Rose tints my world, keeps me safe from my trouble and pain. 

            (Unfreeze - Rocky) 

Rocky:      I'm just seven hours old, ["and can't dance"]
            And truly beautiful to behold. 
            And somebody should be told 
            My libido hasn't been controlled. 
            Now the only thing I've come to trust ["Is Janet's bust"]
            Is an orgasmic rush of lust. ["Yay lust"]
            Rose tints my world and keeps me safe from my trouble and pain. 

            (Unfreeze - Brad) 

Brad:       ["What's two plus two?"]
            It's beyond me; ["What do you say when you masturbate?"]
            help me Mommy! 
            I'll be good; you'll see. 
            Take this dream away. 
            What's this? ["The floor!"] Let's see, 
            I feel sexy!

            Wo!  Here it comes again. 

            (unfreeze - Janet) 

Janet:      I feel released ["real cheap"]; bad times deceased. 
            My confidence has increased; reality is here. 
            The game has been disbanded; my mind has been expanded. 
            It's a gas that Frankie's landed! 
            His lust is so sincere.

Frank:      Whatever happened to Fay Wray? ["She went ape-shit!"] 
            That delicate, satin-draped frame? ["Describe the abortion!"]
            As it clung to her thigh ["What? the ape-shit or the abortion?"] 
            How I started to cry ["I'd cry too if I had abortion on my thigh!"]
            'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same. 

            Give yourself over to absolute pleasure. 
            Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh. 
            Erotic nightmares, beyond any measure 
            And sensual daydreams to treasure forever. 
            Can't you just see it?  Oh, oh, oh. 

            Don't dream it, be it. (four times)

            this trap before this decadence ["Yay, decadence!"] saps our wills.
            I've got to be strong, and try to hang on, or else ["my face will 
            shake"] my mind ["and my shoe"] may well snap ["crackle!  pop!"] 
            and my life will be lived...["Hey, America, show us your 
            underalls!"] for the thrills!

Riff Raff:  Frank N Furter, it's all over. 
            Your mission is a failure; 
            Your lifestyle's too extreme. 
            I'm your new commander; 
            You now are my prisoner. 
            We return to Transylvania. 
            Prepare the transit beam. 

Frank:      Wait!  ["What did you say when your mother caught you

Magenta:    How sentimental. ["You bitch!"] 

Riff Raff:  And also presumptuous of you.  You see, when I said WE were 
            to return to Transylvania, I referred only to Magenta and myself. 
            I'm sorry, however, if you found my words misleading, but ["F"]
            you see ["K"], you are to remain here, in spirit, anyway. 

Scott:      Great heavens!  That's a laser! 

Riff Raff:  Yes, Dr. Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure 
            anti-matter.  ["Does that mean it doesn't matter?"]

Brad:       You mean...you're going to kill him?  What's his crime? 

Scott:      You saw what became of Eddy.  Society must be protected. 
            ["Fuck society!"  "Society's already fucked!"]

Riff Raff:  Exactly, Dr. Scott.  And now, Frank N Furter, your time has 
            come.  Say goodbye to all of this, ["Goodbye, all of this"] and 
            hello ["Hello"] to oblivion. ["Hi, oblivion, how's the wife

Magenta:    But I thought you liked them.  They liked you. 

Riff Raff:  ["Get paranoid!"] They didn't like me!  ["Get real paranoid!"] 
            He never liked ME! 

Scott:      You did right. ["Brownnoser, is that a shitstain or a moustache?"

Riff Raff:  A decision had to be made. ["And I made it"]

            Yes, well, perhaps it was all for the best, heh, heh, heh.
