THE UNISEX PURITY TEST
VERSION 6.6b - 1500 QUESTIONS
 
  If you thought the millenial purity test was bad, well you ain't see
 nuttin' yet!

 This is the 1500 point Purity Test!
 
 We felt that the 1000 point version lost a lot of the "fun" of the
 earlier versions, so we re-wrote it, adding a few new sections, and
 a shitload of questions. This test is guaranteed to be nosier that
 your parents, more invasive than the census, and containing something
 to offend everybody.
 
 Also included is an answer form so that you can remember where in the
 test you were, or show to a friend.
 
 Enjoy (and I know you will).

 Genesis - History:
 
 Version 1 (100) - sometime before 1982
     Created at MIT's Baker House. Two parallel
     versions; one for male, and one for female. Very
     little is known about this version.
 
 Version 2 (247) - spring 1983
     Expanded to 247 questions. This marked the
     beginning of the unisex version. The story goes
     that they intended it to be 250 questions, but got
     tired that night and said "We'll think of three more
     tomorrow," and tomorrow never got there.
 
 Version 3.5 (400) - April 10, 1985
          First formal release. All former versions were
          short-lived and tended to be bug-ridden. Does not
          discriminate against gays or bi's. Added in
          Genesis/History section, instructions, scoring, and
          warranty.
 
 Version 3.5a (400) - April 13, 1985
          Found there were 431 questions instead of 400.
          After an all-night hack sessions, problem was fixed.
 
 Version 3.5c (400) - January 17, 1988
          Finished up at Yale. Final version of the 400 point
          test EVER! Feel special if you own a copy.
 
 Version 4.0 (500) - April 23, 1988
          Those snotty Yale kids thought that 400 wasn't
          enough for them. Added 100 questions "just ta show
          'em."
 
 Version 5.0 (1000) - sometime in the late 80's
          It was decided that 500 questions wasn't enough.
          Created to be the purity test to end all purity
          tests. However, it lost a lot of the "fun" of
          earlier versions and got boring to take.
 
 Version 5.0a (1000) - January 4, 1992
          A copy of the 1000 point version got into my (J. A.
          Pfaff's) hands. Big mistake. Typos were gotten rid
          of and the introduction was made clearer.
 
 Version 6.0 (11??) - April 19, 1992
          First re-vamping of the purity test. We of The
          Erotic Nightmare Revue finally decided that the 1000
          point version was TOO boring. Original goal set for
          1500 questions. Bestiality and Group Sex sections
          added. Extra credit done away with. Never
          released.
 
 Version 6.1 (1179) - April 20, 1992
          Second major rewrite. New goal of 1300 questions.
          RHPS and Kitchen Utensil sections added. Questions
          added here and there. One copy made.
 
 Version 6.2 (1208) - April 21, 1992
          Sections put in more logical order. Questions added
          here and there. One copy made.
 
 Version 6.3 (1275) - April 22, 1992
          Sections re-named to entertain and confuse
          everybody. Genesis/History sections reinstated.
          Never released, but original goal of 1500 looks good
          again.
 
 Version 6.4 (1372) - April 24, 1992
          Cult section added. Introduction from 500 point
          version put back in (it was deleted from 1000 point
          version). Disclaimer added. One copy made.
 
 Version 6.5 (1454) - May 1, 1992
          Time gap between updates due to RHPS playing locally
          and sickness of the editor. The plan was to finish
          before the weekend was over.
 
 Version 6.6 (1500) - May 1, 1992
          We couldn't stand being so close to the end so we
          worked all day. One copy made for checking and
          correcting.
 
 Version 6.6a (1500) - May 3, 1992
          Erased a question from RHPS and added to Kitchen
          Utensils so as to have 42 questions in each section.
          Slight errors edited out. Answer sheet made.
 
 Version 6.6b (1500) - August 17, 1992
          After a "Purity Beta Test Party," we all promptly
          forgot about making the final version. But,
          eventually, we got around to rearranging the
          sections, changing a few questions, and editing
          out every error (that we noticed). This was the
          version released to the general public.
 
 
 Instructions for Use:
 
 This is a fairly long test consisting of 1500 questions. It starts
 out tame and gets progressively worse (or better, depending on your
 viewpoint). There are many ways of going about taking this test. You
 can, of course, as your right, guaranteed by the Constitution,
 be anti-social and sequester yourself in your room and take this test
 all by yourself; however, we feel that the most fun way to utilize
 this test is to hold a Purity Test Party. All you need is one copy of
 the test, and a bunch of friends. (Lots of writing implements and
 paper would be useful too.) The person with the copy of the test is
 the test administrator; s/he reads the questions out loud and
 everybody else writes down their answers. We have no definite rules
 as to whether the participants are required to divulge their answers;
 that is up to the group to decide. However, being open with your
 answers leads to some great conversations. But no matter what you
 decide, each person's purity score should be made common knowledge.
 (The person with the highest score gets to be giggled at for the rest
 of his/her life.) This works great at parties and lets everybody know
 who's easy and who isn't, so you'll know who to go home with. Don't
 leave home without it.
 
 On the whole, this is biased for experience and, hence, age. If you're
 still too young to qualify, well, these things take time. Chaste
 makes waste. Virginity can be cured. Remember: the conjugation is
 "I am erotic, You are kinky, They are perverts"
 
 All questions in this test pertain to events that have happened to you
 subsequent to your weaning and babyhood/infancy. Anything that may
 have happened before that time is considered not standing and void.
 
 
 Definitions: (for the innocent, naive, or too busy)
 
 Necking: the kissing or stroking of a persons head or neck, the
    stroking of arms hands or back.
 Petting: the above plus the caressing or fondling of other
    portions of anatomy; through or underneath clothing.
 Sexual activity: all of the above, plus what your puerile
   imagination dreams up. Doesn't necessarily mean penetration (but
    it can).
 Posslq : "person of the opposite sex sharing living quarters."
    Bureaucrat for live-in lover.
 Masturbation: the rubbing/feeling of your genitals. Doesn't need to
    be to orgasm. Can be through clothing.
 Mutual Masturbation: You masturbating your partner and/or you being
    masturbated. Not necessarily both at the same time.
 
 
 Scoring:
 
 This is a yes-or-no test, so just make sure you have noticeably
 different marks for yes and for no. Common ones are an X and an O, a
 check mark and a smiley face, whatever. When you are finished, count
 up all of the "no" answers and divide that number by 15. That is your
 "percentage purity." Or, if you have less "yes" answers than "no,"
 count THOSE up and subtract from 1500. Then divide THAT number by 15.
 
 We would now like to bring to your attention that there is no passing
 nor failing score. Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much
 about getting a high score...even if you do get giggled at for the
 rest of your life.
 
          --- ALL TECHNICALITIES COUNT ---
 
 And, most of all, this is entertainment. Have as much fun in the
 taking as was had in the making.
 
 
 Note to the test administrator:
 
 Even though we tried to prevent it, this test can get monotonous. Try
 to "liven" it up by adding comments and goofiness wherever you want
 to. Encourage testees to be open with their answers. Taking a break
 is allowed, but not recommended. Plan on a few hours. Order some
 pizza. Get a keg. Have a party.

 Warranty:
 
 We hope that you have enjoyed this test. It does not come with a

 Disclaimer:
 
 The user of this test acknowledges that sex is a hazardous sport; that
 a person must copulate in control, and use good judgement at all
 times; that partners' conditions vary constantly and are greatly
 affected by weather changes and previous use; and that dirty sheets,
 variations in terrain and bed surfaces, spouses/pimps/managers, forest
 growth, rocks and debris, clothed obstacles, and many other natural
 and man-made obstacles and hazards, including other users and
 customers, exist throughout the bedroom area. Personal managers
 (pimps/spouses) and sado-masochistic operations and equipment are
 constantly in use and may be hazardous to those not copulating in
 control. Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting in
 injury can happen at any time, even to those copulating in control
 with proper sexual equipment. Inherent risks are part of the sport
 and may exist within your partner. As a condition of being permitted
 to use the facilities of your partner, the user of this test agrees to
 copulate in control and within the limits of his/her ability, and
 further acknowledges and accepts these hazards, dangers, and risks and
 assumes the risk of injury or loss to person or damage to property
 which might result from use of the partner's facilities.
 
 As a further condition of being permitted to use the facilities of
 your partner, the customer understands and agrees that: (1) in the
 event of a transfer of use by another or anything else in the
 management's opinion is misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or
 nuisance, this service may be revoked without refund; (2) the partner
 is the property of the harem and, upon request, s/he must be presented
 to any authorized representative of the pimp/spouse; (3) sexual
 equipment must be visibly displayed at all times when you are in any
 bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate. Your sexual partner
 is not transferable; see Theft of Services, V.S.A., sections 2581 and
 2582.
