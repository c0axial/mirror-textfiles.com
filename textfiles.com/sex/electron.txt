                       THE SEX LIFE OF THE ELECTRON

   One night when his charge was pretty high, Micro-Farad decided 
to seek a cute little coil to let him discharge.
 
   He picked up Millie-Amp and took her for a ride on his Megacycle.  
They rode across the Wheatstone Bridge, around the sine waves and 
stopped in the magnetic field by a flowing current.
 
   Micro-Farad, attracted by Millie-Amps characteristic curves, soon 
had her fully charged and excited her resistance to a minimum.  He laid 
her on the ground potential, raised her frequency and lowered her 
reluctance.
 
   He pulled out his high voltage probe and inserted it in her socket 
connecting them in parallel, and began short circuiting her resistance 
shunt.  Fully excited, Millie-Amp mumbled, "OHM - OHM - OHM - OHM".
 
   With his tube operating at a maximum and her field vibrating with 
his current flow, he caused her shunt to overheat and Micro-Farad was 
rapidly discharged and drained of every electron.
 
   They fluxed all night, trying various connections and sockets, 
until his magnet had a soft core and lost all of it's field strength.
 
   Afterwards, Millie-Amp tried self induction and damaged her 
solenoids.  With his battery fully discharged, Micro-Farad was unable 
to excite his field, so they spent the rest of the night reversing 
polarity and blowing each other's fuses.
