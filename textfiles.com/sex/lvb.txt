Sorry to those of you who have seen this before.  I am getting 30-40
requests per day for this article, and cannot keep up anymore.  Many
people would prefer I post it, rather than send it to them
it seems.  So here it is (again).
 
Just wanted to state one more thing, also.....several netters have mentioned
that they have gone to Cherry Patch II after calling to be sure Jennifer (or
Star) was working.  You will be mislead often by the hostess who answers the
phone, unless you call after 11pm Las Vegas time.  I got to know one of them
quite well....the one working after 11pm.  She won't lie, but others may. 
If you do call, be sure to get the name of the hostess and tell her you are
coming from out of town, if you are.  I would think they then would be
honest, but you never know.  I called the one I know, and Jennifer will be
working again 8/25 for three weeks.  Hope this helps....
