             Power and Trust                                
                 Lexi
      
      My approach to clear your mind
      Is supple switch to soft behind!
      
      Of your soul I seek perfection;
      Thus to your ass apply correction!
      
      The lash imparts its terse caress
      That inner peace you might possess.
      
      To our love I'll raise my glass
      Just before I spank your ass.
      
      As you lie across my lap
      You'll quiver with each well paced smack.
      
      The foolproof trapdoor to your mind
      Opens through a spanked behind.
      
      As paddle impacts nates skin
      Folly dissipates within!
      
      From globes of ass to globes of brain,
      A bridge is built o'er streams of pain.
      
      If anger, gloom, or ennui loom,
      A paddling brings their certain doom.
      
      Each smack sings of my devotion
      As hand impacts with fervid motion.
      
      Rubor, dolar, calor sweet;
      Redness, pain, and searing heat!
      
      As the nerves conduct their pain,
      A union forms 'tween tail and brain.
      
      Clenching teeth and kicking legs
      Soon my love for mercy begs!
      
      I'll keep on spanking hard your rear
      'till protest soon gives way to tears.
      
      I'll look into your teary eyes,
      And see my love's become more wise.
      
      I'll let you up and stroke your face,
      You'll respond with warm embrace.
      
      I love you, dear, no matter what
      But when you're bad I'll spank your butt!
