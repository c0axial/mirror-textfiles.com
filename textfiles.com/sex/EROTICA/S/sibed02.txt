                        [...from chapter 2...]


   I remember very clearly when I realized Alex was growing up, because
it momentarily frightened me.  I went into the bathroom one morning when
I was thirteen and found several fresh drops of dark blood on the tile
floor in front of the toilet, by the simple method of stepping in it. 
There was more blood in the bowl itself.
   I looked wildly at the backs of my arms and legs and checked quickly
in the mirror to see if I had a nosebleed.  There wasn't a mark on me. 
It had to be my sister, the only other person who ever used the Upstairs
bathroom.  So I hurried into her room.
   "Alex!" I said too loudly.  "Are you all right?  Where'd the blood
come from?"  She was sleeping on her stomach, but she awoke with a
start, raised her head, and stared at me in alarm.
   "What blood?!  Where?"
   "In the bathroom, on the floor!  Did you hurt yourself?"  She stared
blankly at me for a moment before her eyes registered comprehension. 
She let her head fall back on the pillow.
   "No, Dummy.  I just started my period during the night.  Sorry I
made a mess.  I'll clean it up when I get up...."  She began to drowse
off again.
   Her period.  Oh.  Yes, that WAS pretty stupid of me.  The boys'
Health classes in school covered the physical development of both sexes,
so I knew, in theory, what menstruation was.  I just hadn't put my foot
in it before now.  I slipped out of my sister's room, embarrassed and
sheepish.  Then I returned to the bathroom and mopped up the blood, now
smeared by my foot, and then went back to lie, wide awake, in my own bed
for the two hours before we had to get up for school.
   When the alarm went off, I climbed out of bed again and wandered
back to the bathroom.  Alex was already there, in her ubiquitous
sleeping tee-shirt, brushing her teeth.  She turned when I came in, her
mouth full of toothpaste.
   "I said I'd clean it up, Michael."
   "What?  Oh.  Well, I stepped in it and smeared it, and I didn't want
it to dry there.  Besides, I woke you up at five o'clock."  I was still
embarrassed, not because she had begun having periods but because she
hadn't mentioned it to me.
   My sister could read my expressions as fluently as I could read
hers.  "Michael? I didn't mean to embarrass you; I was still asleep.  I
started having periods a couple months ago, and I'm just not used to it
yet.  It makes me feel pretty weird."  She continued to look at me.
   I patted her on the back.  "That's okay, Alex.  You just caught me
by surprise.  I thought you had hurt yourself somehow.  This is a new
experience for me, too."
   Now I was succumbing to curiosity.  "Uh, are you using a-- a Kotex,
or what?  I mean, I don't want to pry...."
   She replied with her tinkly, high amusement laugh.  "No, they're too
bulky, you can see the outline right through your slacks.  I'm using a
tampon."
   I must have looked blank this time.  "Isn't that the same thing?"
   She laughed again and raised the front of her tee shirt above her
panties.  "No, it's not!  I'm using one now and it doesn't show at all." 
She saw my puzzled expression.  "In fact, I need to change it before we
go to school.  You can watch if you want to...."
   "May I?  We didn't get this kind of detail in Health class. 
Obviously."  I had no idea what this was going to involve but I
suspected it might make me a little sick.  Maybe I had better skip
breakfast this morning.
   Alex motioned for me to sit on the closed toilet seat while she got
down a cardboard box from the bathroom closet and dug from it a paper-
wrapped cylinder.  Then she pushed her panties down and put one foot up
on the seat of the old wooden chair we kept in the bathroom.
   This was also something new.  I noted with interest that she was
developing a sizable patch of auburn pubic hair, almost exactly the same
shade as the hair on her head,... and on my head, for that matter.  Then
I saw a white string dangling from her crotch.
   Holding a folded-over pad of toilet paper between her legs, she
tugged on the string and extracted a bright red something the size and
shape of a hot dog, which glistened wetly.  She wrapped it up carefully
in the toilet paper and dropped it in the wastebasket.  There was a
strange new aroma about her, very different but not exactly unpleasant. 
Just strange.
   She dabbed between her legs with another wad of toilet paper,
moistened this time to clean off any blood that had trickled around the
Tampax.  Then she quickly unwrapped the fresh pack, revealing two
telescoped cardboard tubes, like a large toy hypodermic.  Spreading her
labia with the fingers of one hand, she pushed the tube up into herself
with the other, depressed the "plunger," and withdrew the tube, which
was now tinged with red.  A new string dangled from her crotch.
   "See?" she said calmly.  "Nothing to worry about.  And I just gave
you a free shot at my pussy, too," she added with a grin.  She pulled
her panties up and turned back to the sink to wash her hands.
   I sat there another few seconds, thinking about what I had just
seen.  Neither of us was particularly body-conscious, so nudity was not
a big thing.  I had seen my sister naked a number of times and vice
versa.  But this was the first time I had actually been shown what lay
hidden between her legs ... and she had volunteered it.  Was she just
teasing me?  Or was there a message here I didn't yet understand?  I was
pretty sure none of my friends at school who had sisters had had such an
experience, or we all would have heard about it.  I, on the other hand,
wouldn't tell them, or anyone else, a thing.  And Alex knew it.
    Maybe that's why she did it, I thought.  Starting her period means
she's growing up and who else can she show that off to?  And she knows
she can trust me not to gossip about it at school.
   I reached over to my sister, now standing only a foot away at the
sink, and moved my hand lightly down the back of her thigh and the
inside of her knee.  I knew she liked that caress, and she did indeed
look over at me with a wide smile.
   "You have a very nice...," I began and then couldn't think of an
appropriate word.
   "Pussy?  I know.  Thank you, Michael."  Her smile was warm and
candid.  We were an odd couple, even at that age.
