"And now, let's meet our contestants!  First up is a sweet young

just having a conversation with her!  Her she is, a part time
movie actress, former ice skating champ, Lynn!  Lynn, what do you

Lynn-"Oh, Chuck, I think I can win at this game!  As a former ice

(IN THE BACKGROUND, A THUNDEROUS GONG RINGS OUT!)

Chuck-"My God, Jay!  Why did you gong Ashley?"

Jay P Morgan-"I thing we should hang her by her feet and...
     (GIANT CARD FLASHES ON SCREEN-"WHOOPS!)
Chuck-"Folks, that was no expletive deleted!  It was to keep our
contestants from finding out what they are in for!  And, for our
third prison-uh, contestant, meet the former manager of WWF
wrestler Randy Savage, the Lovely Elizabeth, the beautiful
brunette, and the First Lady of Wrestling!  Tell me Elizabeth,
how do you think you will do in our various tickling
competitions?"

Elizabeth-"To tell you the truth, Chuck, this is the first time
that I'll be competing in anything without a prepared script by
Vince McMahon!  Not even Rich Mancuso knows who will win!  By the
way, shouldn't Jesse Ventura be here to provide color
commentary?"

Chuck-"uh, no, Elizabeth, I'm the star around here.  Now, our
final contestant is-uh, it appears she is a little apprehensive!
Bring her in folks!"

Elvira-"ooooh!  I'll just wave my fingertips and POOF-she'll
float over her, just like that!  How's that for a laugh!"
Chuck-"Here she is, our final captu-uh contestant!  A 5' blond
sprite from Dallas, Charlene!  Charlene, what's wrong?"

Charlene-"Chuck, I'm nervous!  Tickle my feet and I'll tell you
or do ANYTHING to make you stop!"

Chuck-"That's right, Charlene!  That is what is going to happen
to all of you!  And, of course, all four of our contestants have
had their feet softened for the tickling to come!  Jamie Farr,
tell us what our mistresses have done to our contestants!  Uh,
Jamie?" (Jamie Farr is asleep.)

Chuck-"Well, let's just go to our mistress in charge, Mistress
Carla, a 6' tall black haired beauty!  Carla?"

Carla-"Hi, everyone!  I'm the Top Tickler around here, and my
four little weaklings have had their feet pampered to soften and
weaken them more than ever!  The four little wenches had a
powerful softening lotion rubbed into their feet-a combination of
Vaseline, Keri Lotion, and lemon juice.  After the concoction was
rubbed into their feet, I covered their feet with cotton socks,
and wrapped their feet in plastic bags, securing the plastic bags
around each ankle with a rubber band.  This was done last evening
before they went to bed; they slept with their feet encased in
the socks and plastic bags.  The combination of the lotions and
perspiration from the feet served to moisturize and soften their
tootsies even more!  Their feet were freed from this one hour
ago, and their feet were washed and buffed with a pumice stone to
remove ALL rough spots!  After the clean up was finished, we
adorned their feet with slippers with VERY thick fur lining!"

Chuck-"Oh, Carla, you have everything taken care of!! Now, I'll
turn the game over to your "sole" leadership!"

Carla-"Thank you, Chuck!  Now, our contestants will be put
through THREE different tickle tortures!  Lynn, Ashley,
Elizabeth, and Charlene-step forward and have a seat!"

     All four sit in their chairs; their wrists are strapped to
the chair.  Four large buckets are brought out by assistants and
secured to the floor, in front of each contestant.  All four
girls have their feet locked into each bucket.

Carla-"Now, the first competition is the Foot Powder competition.
The four of you will have your feet soaked in our special foot
powder, which will make your feet itch FEROCIOUSLY!  And, when
you scratch an affected area, the itching gets worse!  So, to
assist you in your itching, will be my four assistants-Marcy,
Marlene, Maria, and Mary.  The have been trained well, and can
take such torment!  They will rub their feet against yours,
compounding the itching even more!  Each of you will win $1 for
every second you can tolerate the itching.  You will signify that
you are ready to stop by saying, `uncle'.  The MAXIMUM time the
contest will last is 15 mintues, or 900 seconds!  Since there is
no laughter involved, this will be the easiest of the
competitions.  Your endurance will depend on your abilities to
withstand the most nervewracking sensations of all!  You'll need
nerves of steel!" (the competiton begins)

1 minute
Lynn-"oooh, that tickles!  It feels so good though!"
Ashley-"YOU'LL HAVE TO DO MORE THAN THIS TO MAKE ME CRACK!"
Elizabeth-"This is NERVEWRACKING!  I don't know how long I can
    hold out or if I'm supposed to last the whole 15 minutes; at
    least Vince McMahon gives me a script to follow when I'm a
    manager!"
Charlene-"NOOOOOOOO!   I'm going crazy; my feet itch too much!"

5 minutes
Lynn-"tee hee, tee hee, this isn't torture, this is fun!"
Ashley-(squirming violently against her binds) "EEEEEEHHHH, AHH,
       POUR IT ON-GOD, THIS IS DRIVING ME CRAZY-I'LL NEVER GIVE!"
Elizabeth-(biting her lips uncomfortably)-"This is AWFUL-ooohh,
          I'm going out of my mind!"
Charlene-"ooooh, hahaha, ahhhhh, this tickles too much; c-c-can't
          h-hold out much longer-aaaahhhhhh!"

10 minutes
Lynn-"my feet f-f-feel like they have a terminal case poison ivy-
      this is-hahaha-starting to get to me!  I have to hold out!"
Ashley-(screaming in terror)-"C-c-can't take much more-NO! I'm
      not giving up-OH GOD, my feet-the itching-driving me
      crazy!"
Elizabeth-"ooooooh, aaaaaahhhh, I never knew I was such a
          tenderfoot!-can't take much morrre!"
Charlene-(trying to keep her composure)-"1001, 1002, 1003...have
         to keep my mind occupied-1004, OH GOD, this is tooooo
         much!  Can't stand it anymore!"

13-15 minutes
Lynn-"Tee hee hee hee hee, hahahaha, I have to make it--hahahaha,
     it tickles sooooo much-worse and worse-(BELL RINGS-Lynn
     lasted the entire 15 minutes)-OH, it's over!!!!!  That was
     fun!"
Ashley-"NO MORE, NO MORE, NO MORE-I MEAN KEEP IT UP!  U-U (bell
       rings and Ashley lasted 15 minutes)-UNCLE!  Oh, I just
       barely beat the bell!
Elizabeth-"eeeeeee, I have to hang on-this is too much--my feet-
       the itching--hahahaha-starting to crack-tee hee hee hee
       hee-tickles too much-OK, OK,-no don't stop-OH GOD-(bell
       rings-15 minutes)-I don't know how I did it!"
Charlene-(shaking violently in her seat, in tears)-"I CAN'T ST-
        STAND IT!  AAAAAAAAAHHHHH, EEEEEEEEEEE, NO MORRRRRRRE-
        WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!?!?!?!?????   CAN'T STAND-OKAY,
        OKAY, (BELL RINGS- END OF 15 MINUTES) UNCLE!!!  oh God, I
        barely beat the bell!.
The four girls are release from the chairs.  Lynn jumps right up,
none the worse for wear.  Ashley jumps up, exhausted, but
rejuvenated.  Elizabeth is shaky, but manages to get to her feet.
Charlene, in tear, collapses on the floor.

Carla-"Well, somehow all four of you survived!  Of course, many
people do last through the entire time limit on the itching
powder.  However, there are other competitions to go!  The next
competition is one requiring much more endurance!  The 15 minute
soak in the powder have sensitized your feet even more!  Now,
here is our next competition: Make Me Laugh!  The soles of your
feet will be tickled with a feather; the object of the
competition will be to keep from laughing as long as you possibly
can!  One dollar for each second that you don't laugh!
Time limit will be 5 minutes!

Lynn:  That will be TOUGH!  I can laugh forever, but I don't
       think I'll be able to keep myself from laughing!
Ashley: GO AHEAD, TRY IT!!!!!  YOU'LL NEVER MAKE ME CRACK!
Elizabeth:  My gosh!  Me and my friends used to do each other
          when we were little girls-I NEVER could last!
Charlene:  (eyes wide with terror) NO!  I'LL DIE!!!!!!!!!!

All four contestent are strapped to their chairs, and their
ankles are locked in the stocks.  Carla's four assistants are
armed, each with a big feather.

Carla:  Oh, by the way.....all 4 of you will be tickled for
ENTIRE 5 minutes, so bursting out laughing will be of no relief
to any of you!  Again, the idea is to weaken your resistence!
OK, assistants-MAKE THEM LAUGH!

The tickling begins

30 seconds

Lynn is biting her lips, her feet twitching and squirming
Ashley is doing the same, but bucking violently against her binds
Elizabeth's is somehow keeping relaxed, smiling gently, but
    keeping in her laughter
Charlene's entire body is quivering, as she struggles not to
       laugh

1 Minute
Lynn is fighting back a smile; her jaw starts to quiver
Ashley is rolling her head, her eyes wide, fighting the
     sensations
Elizabeth's lips start to quiver; she's struggling
Charlene's entire body is still quivering; tears roll down her
           cheeks

1.5 Minutes
Lynn is now smiling ear to ear; her head shakes as she fights the
          urge to laugh!
Ashley-HAHAHAHAHAHA-I C-COULDN'T T-TAKE IT-HAHAHAHA-ANY LONGER!
Elizabeth bites her lips and squirms against the binds that hold
           her; her eyes are wide with terror
Charlene is sobbing; her lips are beginning to quiver, struggling
            to keep out the laugher

2 Minutes
Lynn is now biting her lips through her smile; her eyes squint
     shut, she is fighting so hard not to laugh
Ashley-HAHAHAH, TEEHEETEEHEE, S-STOP, IT T-T-TICKLES!!!!!!
Elizabeth-same as before, but tears are rolling down her cheeks
Charlene-AAAAAAAAUGH!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  NO MORE, PLEEEEEEASE!

3 Minutes
Ashley and Charlene are in hysterics; Charlene is crying at the
same time,  Lynn and Elizabeth are in a battle to keep from
laughing.  Lynn seems to have weakened, as tears start to flow
from her eyes.

4 Minutes
Ashley and Charlene are laughing harder by the second.
Carla approaches Lynn and Elizabeth:  Are your little tootsies a
little too ticklish?
Lynn and Elizabeth nod in agreement, both in tears.
Carla:  Well, suppose that while the feathers tickle the bottoms
of your feet, my long fingernails will scrape along your toes!
(she goes to work on Lynn and Elizabeth)

4.5 Minutes
Ashley, Charlene AND Elizabeth are in uncontrollable hysterics
Lynn is in tears and shaking violently in the chair

5 Minutes
Lynn bursts into tears and laughter when the 5 minute bell rings-
"I almost passed out!!!!" she exclaims through her sobs.

Carla:  Well, let's see how you all have done.  Lynn as lasted
through both competitions:  20 minutes, or $1200.  Elizabeth last
19.5 minutes:  $1170.  Charlene has 17 minutes credit, for $1020.
Ashley, you aren't as tough as you say you are.  You fell apart
on the Make Me Laugh competition, and have lasted 16.5 minutes,
for $990.  However, here is the big competition:  The Foot
Tickling Endurance Test.  There is NO time limit on this, and you
get a dollar for each second of tickling you endure.  That last
competition has taken a lot out of all of you; we should make
quick work of all four of you in no time!  This time, it will be
more than a feather tickling the soles of your feet!  Each of you
will slip into the Magic Sandals!  Notice that the  numerous
rubber prongs on sandles will lift your feet up.  Between the
rubber prongs will be small electrodes, which send vibrating
stimulation on your soles, which tickle even MORE than the
feathers or long fingernails!  Heightening the tortue even more
is the fact that all four of you will be standing the whole time,
increasing the tickling sensations even more!  Also notice that
there will be feathers placed between your toes, and that those
feathers are attached to very powerful vibraters!  To give, just
cry "Uncle!"

(All four girls look in horror.  All 4 step into the sandals, and
are locked in.  Each girl is tied to a pole coming up from the
floor, forcing them to stand.  A switch is thrown)

5 Seconds
L-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-THAT FEELS WONDERFUL!
A-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-I'LL OUTLAST EVRYONE THIS TIME
E-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-NOT EVEN RANDY SAVAGE WAS EVER THIS MEAN TO ME
C-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA-STOOOOOOOOOOOOP!  MY F-FEET T-TICKLE TOO MUCH!

The studio is filled with the sound of the hysterical laughter of
the 4 helpless, ticklish girls.  10 minutes into the torture:
L:  M-MY B-BRAINS ARE RATTLING!
A:  I'LL NEVER CRACK!
E:  P-PLEASSSSSSSS!  NO MORE!!!!!!  I DON'T MEAN THAT-HAVE TO
     LAST!
C:  MY SIDES ARE GONNA EXPLODE!

20 MINUTES
L-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH!
A-OH GOD, CAN'T STAND THIS-TOO MUUUUUUCH!
E-F-FEELS L-LIKE A T-T-TERMINAL CASE OF ATHLETE'S FOOT!
C-HAHAHAHAHAHAHA-CAN'T BREATH-UNCLLLLLLLEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
(Charlene is out of the competition. Final total:  37 minutes,
$2220 won-she is release and collapses)

30 MINUTES
L-ALL THOSE SKATING COMPETITIONS-JOGGING-NEVER WAS THIS BAD!
A-(IN TEARS-IS BITING LIPS TO KEEP FROM LAUGHING-DOESN'T EXCEED!)
E-(IN TEARS)-NO MORE!  UNCLE!!!!!
Elizabeth finishes with 49.5 minutes-$2,970
Upon being release, she falls asleep on the floor

At the 45 minute mark, Ashley cries:  "I'M GONNA WET MY PANTS!
UNCLE!!!!!!!!!  She finishes with 64.5 minutes and $3840.  Upon
release, she runs in tears to the bathroom!

60 minutes
Carla to Lynn-"Well, you have won!  Shall we turn the Magic
               Sandals off?
Lynn-"NOOOOOO!"
Carla-"My, aren't we stubborn!  Suppose we add to your torture?"
Lynn-"GO A-AHEAD! I-I HAVE MY S-SECOND WIND!  MY FEET FEEL
      WONDERFUL-HAHAHAHAHA!"
Carla-"Well, while you have been occupied, our 3 other
  contestants have been refreshed with a full body massage.  They
  are quite rejuvenated, and are prepared to add to your
  torment!"
Ashley, Elizabeth, and Charlene walk up to Lynn.  Carla removes
Lynn's halter top, exposing her underarms, breasts and ribs!
Carla-"LET HER HAVE IT!" Ashley comes up behind Lynn and tickles
her underarms Charlene goes to work on Lynn's ribs, while
Elizabeth titilates Lynn's breasts!

80 Minutes
Lynn-
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   MUUUUUUUUCH!
AAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGH!
UNCLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLE!"
Lynn lasts a total of 100 minutes: $6000!  As she is release, she
collapses, in tears, into the waiting arms of Ashley, Elizabeth,
and Charlene.  Ashley wipes the tears away.  Elizabeth assures
Lynn that "we'll take care of you!"  Charlene adds, "Hey, you
beat us fair and square!"

Carla-"Indeed, Lynn has beaten all of you!  The three of you will
be punished.....(Ashley, Charlene and Elizabeth get frightened
looks!) by pampering Lynn, with a bubble bath, and a massage, and
anything else she needs to help her recover!"

The 3 girls sighed with relief-this would be one punishment they
would be grateful for-one without tickle torture!  Lynn was
treated to a bubble bath and a neck, shoulder, and back rub by
all three girls, along with having dinner in bed....a very
deserved bonus!
