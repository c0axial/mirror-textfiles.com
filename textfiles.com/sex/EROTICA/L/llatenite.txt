     I've been waiting for you, Alice.  I've put on a fire, and curled up 
with a book, waiting for you to come home.  It's 2 am.  You finally get 
home from halfway across the country, tired and cold and in *no* romantic 
mood at  all.  Of course, you still give me a kiss and hug -- not just a 
cursory kiss and hug -- and explain that you just are not up for anything 
more now, that you are going to go get a bath and go to bed. 
 
     Up the stairs you go.  I watch you move, imagining how it would look 
with no clothes on.  I hear the water running, and wait just a little.  
Then I go upstairs, and slide into the bathroom to wash your back for you.  
You start to protest, and I grab your wrists and pull them behind your 
head.  You look lovely like that, with your arms raised and your breasts
jutting out.  I pull out the soft cloth cuffs we sometimes use, the dark 
purple cat collars.  I click them on your wrists, and then snap them 
together behind your head.  Its not terribly comfortable, but at least 
your hands can't get in my way now.  Tears start down your face, from 
exhaustion or discomfort, I don't know.  I kiss you and then wipe them 
away. 
 
     I take one of those big, soft sponges, and wash you, sluicing water 
over your back, and letting it run down your shoulders.  I kiss the back 
of your neck and push you against the back of the tub, washing your 
stomach with the sponge, and then your breasts.  You are, by now, feeling 
very warm as I start to scrub a little at the inside of your thighs, and 
lean over to kiss your upturned breasts.  Your eyes are closed, but you 
are certainly not surprised by my touches.  Eventually, I haul you out, 
and dry you off with a big fluffy towel, kissing you very hard, forcing 
my tongue into your mouth and pressing you close to me.   
 
     It is late, Alice, but there we are, you in your towel and I in my 
bathrobe.  It's much, much colder out in the hall or the bedroom than it 
is right here in the bathroom, and you don't want to leave.  I untie my 
robe, push your towel away, pressing my naked body close against yours.  
It is late, you say, as I unhook your hands.  And it is, as we sink down  
onto the bathroom floor.  We both smile, as we fuck, very very slowly,  
feeling very very warm. 
 
     You'll sleep well tonight, dear.
