Hi!

       I was reading a review of Marilyn Hamel's book "Sex Etiquette"
[Delacorte, 1984] and she warns about the lies men tell in order to get women
into bed. Most are typical "singles bar" lines. Here they are:

1) You're the prettiest lady I've seen all night. Are you a model?

2) I hate macho men who can't treat a woman as a human being.

3) I don't want you to think I just fall into bed with every woman.

4) I'm really getting fed up with the singles scene. I want a woman I can
settle down with.

5) Technically I'm still married, but we're not working at it.

6) I havn't had sex in six months, women just don't seem to warm up to me.

7) I have this great Mozart collection, would you like to come back to my place
and hear it?

8) Can I order us a bottle of champagne? I just made a killing on the
SuperBowl.

9) I'm not into one night stands. I only sleep with a woman if I want to see
her again.

10) Can I come in for a moment? I have to use the phone.

   Now: What do you think of these "lies"? Is the author unfairly tarring all
men by suggesting that these are invariably lies? And, how would women
respond to these statements and questions?

   Oh...one other question...what would you add to or delete from the list?

   Cheers!
   Rusty

Dear Rusty,

If *I* thought the guy was a great guy..and from my own perceptions I was
convinced that he was a straight shooter, I would believe any of those "lies".

If the guy, in my opinion, were a jerk or a nerd......NOTHING he could hand out
in the way of a line would convince me he was ok.

It all boils down to: how smart is the woman about men, and how bad does she
want to get laid?

Dear Debonair Dave,
A guy once told me that he is made VERY uncomfortable by women who look at his
crotch in an appraising sort of way...for him, it is a real turnoff.

Yet, as a woman, I have had my breasts stared at frequently, even during casual
conversations with men, even during BUSINESS discussions.

Now....can YOU tell me in your very debonair way, what is the DIFFERENCE?
Why is it okay for men to stare....but some men feel threatened by a woman
looking THEM over?

(I've never hung out in a PUB before..but if I had known it would be this much
fun I would have started years ago.....hmmm....maybe I should do this in real
life too!!! (grabbing coat...car keys...house keys.........SLAM!))

Dear Debutante Diane,

I never said anything about feeling uncomfortable about women staring at my
crotch. After all, I wore tight doubleknit pants for 18 years, (what do you
think the women are looking at??????)

If your friend is uncomfortable with it then it is a matter of "if you can't
stand the heat, get out of the kitchen!!"

I'll admit it would be hard staring at a guy's crotch in a business meeting
where we are generally seated, but it might liven things up a bit!! (Diane what
*ARE* you doing under the table?????)

One thing that catcher's taught me (catcher's are inevidiably women chaser's)
is to return a stare with a stare, and the longer it is held, the better the
sex. No I haven't put this to use lately, but it used to work!!!!!

Hi Diane!

    Gee, I have this great collection of MS.DOS software! Would you like to
come back to my place and run some programs? (wink wink)

    On a more serious note, how do you make that assessment so quickly? Is
there some secret signal that men convey to women about whether they are jerks
or nerds? Is it the plastic pocket protector? In my days in engineering
school we ALL wore plastic pocket protectors and had slide rules hanging from
our belts. (those were the days when we programmed with punched cards...on a
state-of-the-art IBM 360).

HI Rusty!

Hmmmmmm.......you have hi-tech etchings!
No, there is no SECRET signal that a guy is a jerk or a nerd. It is usually
pretty evident....and the plastic pocket protector, while not particulary
attractive (especially shoved into a polyester pocket!) would not be MY
criteria. If a guy is a jerk or a nerd, he would be a person who was not
intereted in ME, in my responses, or in my comfort in the situation. That would
be the first and most obvious reaction I would get. To paraphrase, a nerd is a
nerd is a nerd.

How DO other women determine the relative "nerdness" of a guy? I just go by my
perceptions and my intuitions. I have been known to be wrong. Sigh.

Hi Diane!

        Remember when Dristan used to used to use the "nasograph" in the TV
commercials? All it looked like was a kid's geometry protractor.

Be sure to include things like length of pants.....floods are always indicative
of a nerd. Do you think they wear them short so you can` see their white socks
better?

Is a nerd ALWAYS visible from his exterior? Or can a guy look like an absolute
PEACH and really be a nerd?

Diane:

        I know you and Rusty believe that the Nerdograph is a new invention,
conceived in the Pub while looking through the dregs of a brew or two, but I
can assure you that the Nerdometer was invented in Northern California several
years ago by some brilliant analysts. The instrument was found to be useless
after several months on the market due to some nerd who, while eating Cheerios
for breakfast, hacked the system and published several ways to beat the device.

        'ographs and 'ometers have gone the way of software - easily replicated
and defeated. The best system yet in use is still the eyeball test.

plastic pocket protectors and (shudder) polyester sport jackets...get short

Dear Rusty,

Having never been into the single bar scene, I can only tell you what I feel
about the one liners!

First of all, most of them are quite unbelieveable! I would never fall for
one, unless I was desperate for some companionship for an evening.....realizing
that it was a one night stand with no commitments on his part. But then, I
don't think I would find myself in that position.

Number 9 took the cake! I would be splitting my sides with laughter if a man
ever said that to me....grin. I can't see how it could get more two-sided than

   You bring up an interesting point about the "gullibility" factor. Do you
think some women actually want to believe the lies? And, are you convinced

Dear Rusty,

Hmmmmm......how can you convince someone that they are telling a lie if they
*REALLY* believe what they are saying? Don't some men believe that women
desire their bodies and that is all these women want? <Just wondering>

But, I also think some women want to be gullible at times. It is nice to
believe a fairy tale. If some man gives them a line, well, it is up to them
how gullible they want to be. I personnally don't care for gullible types when
it comes to lines about sex. A straight forward approach can be quite crude,
but honest! Since, I don't know about being "picked" up....does honesty pay?

I do like the one you mentioned, I had to chuckle at it......<still grinning>

Hi Cheryl!

   Dave S. just left a very similar message...the idea being that women who
allow themselves to believe the lies are perhaps trying to act out a fairly
ttale.

   (ahem)...I am used to women wanting my body...so it is not a big problem.
(if you believe that, can I show you some Florida vacation land?)

   Are there not times that both men and women would like to be able to believe
some of the lies? Do you think that some folks *like* to be gullible?

Fm: * Cheryl * 72167,1517
To: * Rusty * 75256,627 (X)

Dear Rusty,

Yes, there are times when men and women would like to believe those types of
lies. Why? Well, it probably makes them feel good that they are attractive to
the other (same, depending if one is gay) sex. Let's face it when you notice
someone looking at you (that you also find attractive) it feels good. So, why
wouldn't a "come on" line stroke the ego and make one feel good?

I think there are times when we want to be gullible and times when we don't. I
have seen naturally gullible people (my sister is slightly that way), but this
would have to be trying at times for the person. I would not want to be that
way *all* the time! <grin> But, sometimes it is nice to let down our common
sense side of our mind and be gullible!

Hi Cheryl!

  Ah yes! The ego! Of course it makes us feel good to know that other people
find us to be attractive. Are the times that we like to be gullible the times
that we need positive reinforcement of our "worthiness"?

  When we are a little down and feeling unloved it can be a very pleasant
experience!

  Err...would your gullible sister like to meet me? (just kidding)

I don't think being gullible necessarily means that we need positive
reinforcement of our own "worthiness". But, it is just nice to have the ego
stroked every now and then (whether the comment is pertaining to sex or doing a
good job at work).

Dear Rusty, I probably shouldn't even consider commenting, as I've never set
foot in a singles bar (or any other kind 'cept your pub!), and have never been
"picked up". But women DO talk, and you might be surprised how often I've
heard my women friends laugh at guys who tried lies like that on them! The one
I liked best was used on TWO of my friends by the same guy, a week apart. The
line was, "I'm sorry to be rude, but I couldn't help but overhear part of your
conversation. You have a WONDERFUL voice... I hear Southern girls are special
people...can we get acquainted?" The reason both women thought it was
particularly funny is that, at a bar in Dallas, he picked one girl from Ohio
and another from Canada! Seems to me, tho, that what happened to Dustin Hoffman
in Tootsie when as Tootsie Jessica Lange told him she wished a man would just
be honest and say he'd like to go to bed with her -- and the man tried it, and
got a drink thrown in his face -- would be VERY likely to happen in real life.
"You can't tell an important truth to a stranger", said the American Pschiatric
Association after a conference on falsehoods a few years back, and even St.
Thomas Aquinas said that "Lies are oft the balm which spares the heart." I
wouldn't say all men lie, but I would say that a lot of what passes for
flirtation in today's world might have been called "creative writing" in my
college truth-in-advertising classes! <hugs> Anne

HI Rusty!

I consider people who put out lawn flamingos....and serve soda instead of
Perrier..and drive old Chevies to be rugged individualists and therefore, very
far from nerddom!

What do you think Rusty?

Huggs, Diane

P. S. - How do you tell a female nerd?
Does she wear something, or do something to distingish herself from her more
soignee sisters?

Hi Diane!

   I happen to agree completely with your assessment of rugged individuals!

   Hmmm...female nerds...or "nerdettes" as they are called exhibit the
following tendancies: They wear cheap fake fur jackets and think they are
fasionable, change gentlemen friends quickly based upon material assessments,
and are freqently referred to as "airheads"

   Clear up your question??
   Cheers!

Rusty,

Airheads are more commonly found under the cover rather than before. Which is
a unfortunate risk that one must take when taking up after a "crotch-watcher"

Rusty, As one of the males who doesn't like macho characters, and tries to
treat women as humans, I am insulted by a woman who thinks that's a lie. Am I
supposed to lie and say that I *like* macho men to please her?! Some more of
that kind of skewed logic, and I'll really start treating women like they don't
know a good thing when they see it. I mean I'm obviously a good thing...<grin>

Dear Diane,
        Sounds like you (and the rest of the responders so far) take things too
seriously: c' mmon, give the guys a break! They're just trying hard to be witty
and personal in an impersonal situation. Relax! Enjoy somebody giving away his
self-esteem and lying just to get your attention! That's the biggest compliment
you can get these days and still keep laughing!

Dear Danny,

Well, maybe I'm strange, but the kind of man who gives away his self-esteem and
lies just to get my attention just doesn't appeal to me. I DON'T consider it a
compliment, either. I also don't think I take things too seriously. A man can
be witty and charming WITHOUT lying, don't you think? Or do you consider that
impossible?

Dear Lana,

     Think of this as an infinite loop: YES! I AGREE!!!!!!

     I once had a somewhat extended sorta relationship with a man who
lied--constantly. Harmless things, really (I guess). Lies that made him (in
his eyes) appear more macho, more intelligent, more productive. Of course, I
got to the point where I believed absolutely nothing he said. I even doubted
that his mother was of a certain nationality until a friend of mine had talked
to her on the phone and mentioned the accent. <smile>
     I excused him on the ground that he was young and trying to impress me. 
<blush> (Okay. Okay. So he was 26 and I was 40. My excuse is that he was
soooooo adorable. <bowing head in shame at being weak>)

     After a while, I became fascinated with the lying. He lied about
absolutely everything! Not to deceive me about anything. He just seemed to
live in a world of lies. He lied about his softball record. He lied about his
education. He lied about what television programs he watched. He could have
been an artist, but unfortunately he didn't have the best memory in the world. 
<smile> I used to sit and look at him when we were out to dinner and listen to
his stories. They weren't very good and they frequently conflicted with
something he had told me previously. It was utterly amazing.

     Let me give you an example of his skill. (By the way, this dear, little
thing and I have known each other for about 8 years) He had told me many times
that he had majored in history in college (so had I). Now I never tried to pin
him down. Unfair, I thought. But one night I asked him, "Which came first: 
the Renaissance or the Dark Ages?" He looked puzzled and said, "It was the
Renaissance, wasn't it?" POOR BABY!

     I hate lying and I usually know. I think that most people lie
occasionally and occasionally should be forgiven, overlooked, forgotten,
ignored, etc. But to lie about feelings, goals, etc., in a relationship is not
a nice thing to do. That's the point where I say, "Hey! It's been fun! Let's
meet for lunch sometime. Bye!"

Eleanor:

I had a colege roommate, Pat, who was like that. Everything had to be made a
little more fascinating than it really was. Except Pat could remember his lies
and string them together rather well.

But I caught him. Pathological lying is a precursor, if not an outright
indication, of serious emotional instability. I still wonder if he was lying
about the jewelry store thing. <sigh>

And the Hell's Angel's thing. <sigh>

And the attempted robbery with battery thing. <sigh>

Definitely a strange character.

DIANE (la huntress reincarnate, hmmmmmm?) Somehow, lady, you put me back into
early (incomplete!) classical studies mood. Second thing I absorbed in Latin
(first was, of course, that amor amas amatum stuff . . ) was agricola
agriclorum or some such . . why they thought hi-school kids gave a damn about
farmers . .?
However, having survived into adulthood (prolly because I ducked wisely out of
Latin . . and never tried Greek) then spent many years on the fringes of
agriculture right here in these U. States.
What, you may well ask, is the possible connection with your froodian slip? 
Aha . . . your 'umble scribe became SO very familiar with Foot-in-Mouth
disease. The hell with the cattle, have seen what it does to people. Me,
included. Dreadful. Awesome. Highly contagious. Primary symptom: pronounced
flush of facial (and sometimes other) areas. Only known cure: healthy
laughter.
ON THE OTHER HAND, once knew a lively lovely lass whom I could only describe as
"toe-licking-good!" Suppose the mal-ladies is related?

 "All the Girls Keep Getting Prettier at Closing Time"

You're right, Rusty:

Margaret Mead, rest her soul, would be compelled to agree with you. But why
stop with country?
 What about:
  "Show n Tell," Al Wilson, lead vocals; John Dean, backup vocals.
  "You're Breaking My Heart...So F*K YOU," Harry Nillson, lead; Judge William
   Kean, lead mallot.
  "Der Fuhrer," Ronny Reagan and the Raygunettes
 and who could forget,
  "It's My Party (and I'll cry if I want to)," Leslie Gore, lead; Ed Muskie,
  backup.

They weren't as MEMORABLE as your selection, but I just couldn't let these few
go unnoticed by posterity. !! SALUTE' !!
