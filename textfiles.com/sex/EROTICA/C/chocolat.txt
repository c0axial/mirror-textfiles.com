                  CHOCOLATE

The room is painted a deep rich red, you have chosen
the music and there are white candles all around the
floor, the light dancing wildly over your glistening
nakedness.  You lay face down on the floor and I sit 
naked astride your soft backside, a thigh each side.  I 
pull my fingers through your hair touch lightly on your
downy neck run them firmly dowm your back.  That
electrifying skin on skin sensation is getting
stronger.  I circle my hips as I slowly pour melted
chocolate between your shoulder blades watch it flow its
sensual path along your supple spine.  Some trickles
down your side, I reach out my hand to catch it.  As you
suck it hungrily from my slender fingers, your mouth so
strong and warm, I lick it from your back, I lick,
suck, lick 'til there is no more but I am still hungry.
I run my hands roughly over your tight buttocks
searching for more, you shudder as I bite then pull you
round to face me.  I am on you I want to be inside you,
my mouth on yours we kiss deep and long, our tongues
searching, increasing in force but we are insatiable.
You are still hungry I am still hungry, my long fingers
find your clit you run you taught thigh through my legs,
our hearts pumping pumping our bodies writhing in
ecstacy we climax together, I pull you close to me,
clinging together in this timeless space but I want
more you want more, your face between my legs
mine between yours we feed voraciously sucking licking
biting more and more 'til there could never be any
more, our world is created, we are inside each other I
roam free in your mind body soul you roam free in mine,
we are united.
