     The photo of someone (you?!?) in the rubber cocoon is very
nice.  I love to be cocooned for extended periods of time.

	I have discovered a very effective "solo" cocoon
technique:  use several yards of sheeting (I like silky tricot
or latex rubber, sometimes the one beneath the other!); by
fastening the bottom of the sheet snugly around the feet and
holding top and edge with the hands, I can roll myself up in
the sheet; when I get to the edge of the bed, I "wiggle-worm"
my way back to the other side, dragging more sheet with me;
then I repeat the process, over and over (depending on the
length of the sheeting) until I am quite tightly and
helplessly cocooned.  While it is possible to get out without
aid, it takes quite awhile, so the feeling of helplessness is
quite genuine.  (I've found a couple of material stores which
sell very nice nylon tricot in 108" widths as inexpensively as
89 per yard, so 30 or 40 yards is not a large investment; latex
sheeting, on the other hand, certainly is outrageously
expensive.)
