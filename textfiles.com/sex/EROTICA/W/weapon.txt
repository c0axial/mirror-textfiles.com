                              FIELD MANUAL 13-69
                             WAC, U.S., M1(M1A1)

          1.   The  WAC,  U.S.,  M1  and  M1A1  was designed  as an auxiliary
          component to  the BLANKET,  Olive Drab  shade  36.   The  WAC  is a
          breech-loaded,  recoil operated,  air cooled, pelvic action, ground
          environment weapon.  It may be put into action at any time and from
          any position or elevation.


                                     DESCRIPTION

          2.   The weapon has an average overall length of approximately 66
          inches, while the circumference will vary with age and usage fac-
          tors.  The weapon is equipped with SHOCK ABSORBERS, two (2) each,
          mounted approximately twelve (12) inches below the weapons sight-
          ing devices.   Size and resiliency of the shock absorbing  devices
          likewise  varies depending on age of equipment and general condi-
          tion of the weapon.   The shock absorbers may  be  used  as  hand
          grips  during  firing  operations.    The weapon's principle com-
          ponent, the breech, will be discussed in a subsequent section.


                        NOMENCLATURE & FUNCTION OF THE BREECH

          3.   PRINCIPLE COMPONENTS:  The breech of this weapon consists of
          three (3) components.   The first, COVER, Fur is not essential to
          firing.  However,  the Cover,  Fur is provided as standard equip-
          ment  on  all  models.    The  second major component is the LIP,
          Breech, Flexible, two (2) each.  During firing,  these components
          insure  a snug fit for the projectile and it casing.   Similarly,
          it prevents the entry of dirt or other foreign objects  into  the
          breech when the weapon is not in use.  The third, and most impor-
          tant component is the BREECH,  which is designed to accommodate a
          projectile of 38mm (approximately 1.5 inches).   Certain  models,
          depending  on age and frequency of usage,  may require a slightly
          larger cartridge.   (NOTE: Using personnel are urged  to  request
          armament technicians to ascertain precise bore size through pull-
          over gage measurements).   The length of the projectile is not of
          special significance other than increasing the efficiency of  the
          weapon.

               a.    The  Breech  is  equipped with a factory-assembled and
          sealed SYSTEM,  Internal Lubrication.   This  subsystem  prevents
          hangfires during operation of the weapon.

                b.    All newly assembled being brought into the service in-
          ventory are delivered with a tough protective  coating  which  is
          located between the Breech and the Lips,  Breech, Flexible.  This
          coating can effectively removed by simply loading  and  firing  a
          projectile.   Unusual noises accompanying this procedure need not
          alarm the  firing  personnel  as  they  will  soon  subside  with
          repeated firings.

                                LOADING AND OPERATION

          4.   GENERAL.   The weapon is most efficiently fired by a one-man
          crew.   However,  it is quite common for  the  gunner  to  become
          fatigued  while  operating  the weapon and it may be desirable to
          employ a multiple gunner crew in rotating shifts.  (CAUTION: Per-
          mit no more than five men to  operate  the  weapon  in  a  single
          firing  to  avoid  undue  and  dangerous  stress  on the weapon).
          Failure to observe the above listed caution normally  results  in
          extended  non-operational time while maintenance personnel rebore
          and refinish the weapon.

               a.  LOADING AND GUN DRILL:  The gunner's primary firing posi-
          tion is between the mobility devices of  the  weapon.    Mobility
          devices  should  be  flexed  at  the main joints and spread to an
          angle of 45 to 60 degrees to ensure minimum recoil effects.    At
          the  count  of  "one",  the gunner assumes the kneeling position,
          projectile in the right hand and aligned with the  breech.    His
          FINGERS,  Hand,  Left, are extended forward and downward to main-
          tain balance.   On the count "two",  the HAND,  Right is  brought
          smartly away  from  the  projectile  (which at this time should be
          secured between the Lips, Breech, Flexible).

               b.  FIRING:  To fire the weapon, the command "READY,   WIGGLE"
          is given.  On this command of execution, the gunner briskly slides
          the projectile fully into the breech and immediately commences  a
          gradual  rocking  motion with regular or intermittent lateral mo-
          tion (optional) until the projectile detonates.

                    (1)  Special care must be taken to  make  certain  that
          fusing  is  not  set for point detonation as such a condition in-
          variably results in a misfire.

                    (2)  Qualified and proficient gunners are authorized to
          employ variations to the primary firing position  outlined  above
          in para 4.b.   A unique feature of the weapon is the fact that it
          operates equally well in both indoor and outdoor environments  in
          an  almost  infinite  variety  of firing positions.   (NOTE:  the
          weapon is somewhat less efficient when operated in a totally ver-
          tical attitude)

                    (3)  The spent cartridge is withdrawn while the  weapon
          is  allowed  to  cool and a new,  fresh cartridge is prepared for
          firing.

                                      STOPPAGES

          5.  Once the weapon has been sufficiently and properly broken in,
          stoppages rarely if ever occur.  In rare cases, however, the gun-
          ner may find it difficult  to  insert  the  projectile  into  the
          Breech.    The  immediate  field action expedient to correct this
          condition calls for the gunner to manually operate manipulate the
          breech assembly (i.e. Cover,  Fur;  Lip,  Breech,  Flexible;  and
          Breech)  which  should activate the System,  Internal Lubrication
          (para 3.a.).  In extremely rare cases, use of JELLY, Lubricating,
          Type K-Y is authorized and encouraged at the  discretion  of  the
          operating gunner.


                                     MAINTENANCE

          6.    CARE  AND  CLEANING.    A significant design feature on all
          models of the weapon is the minimal crew maintenance necessary to
          keep the weapon in Equipment Serviceability Criteria (ESC) GREEN.

               a.   All weapons come equipped with an  internally-activated
          MECHANISM,  Adjustment and Purging, which like the SYSTEM, Inter-
          nal,  Lubrication,  is installed and sealed at the point  of  as-
          sembly.   This mechanism functions normally for a period of three
          to five days during each operational cycle of twenty-eight  days.
          Normal  functioning  of  the  mechanism during these brief periods
          seriously impairs the weapon's functionality and results in  an
          ESC rating of RED.  Gunners are warned to operate the weapon only
          at their own risk during these normally non-operational periods.


                                 SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

          7.   ABNORMAL CORROSION.   Gunners may occasionally discover that
          the breech and chamber of selected weapons produce a highly  cor-
          rosive  effect  on the projectiles and cartridges.   This is par-
          ticularly likely to occur in using units  who  fail  to  maintain
          complete and accurate Weapon Records Data (Form 2408-4a).   Where
          corrosion is observed,  gunners are required to make maximum  use
          of COVERINGS,  Latex,  Form-fitting,  for their projectiles.  The
          Covering,  a one-time use,  expendable  device  must  be  locally
          procured.

          8.   ABNORMAL BREECH EXPANSION.  A swelling condition immediately
          above the breech assembly is a critical safety hazard.   Such ex-
          pansion  is  invariably  preceded  by  a  repeated failure of the
          Mechanism,  Adjusting and Purging,  to activate during successive
          operational  cycles.   While failure of the Mechanism,  Adjusting
          and Purging,  to activate and functions in itself only a  short-
          coming,  such failure,  when coupled with the swelling and expan-
          sion described previously,  definitely constitutes a  deficiency.
          In such cases, maintenance personnel should place the weapon in a
          limited  operational status until such time as the weapon returns
          to a fully operational status.   The gunner who has  been  deter-
          mined to, or who is suspect of being responsible for creating the
          subject  safety hazard is advised to immediately put as much dis-
          tance between himself and the weapon as current transfer  regula-
          tions permit.
