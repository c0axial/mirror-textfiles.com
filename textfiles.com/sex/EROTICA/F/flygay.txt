Gay Pilots Association

Who?

GPA was founded by a small group of aviation professionals.  Our
members consist of pilots, air traffic controllers, mechanics and
anyone else associated with the aviation industry.

Why?

GPA was formed to offer pilots and other aviation industry
personnel a discreet way to connect and correspond with each other. 
We hope to help our members find anything from a relationship to
employment to an aircraft or just some good friends.

What?

GPA consists of a quarterly newsletter containing everything from
member submitted articles to our exclusive personals section. 
There are also columns for personal and professional advice,
regulatory updates, and a classified section containing headings
for help wanted, jobs wanted, buy-sell-swap, instruction and
professional services.

MAYDAY!

GPA's continued growth relies on the good ol' boy network to
increase our membership and visibility among the gay aviation
community.  We are solely a product of our members and their
support (donations, submissions, feedback and ideas).  Membership
is free but we ask for a standard donation of at least $20 per year
to cover the cost of operation.  With your donation you will
receive a subscription to the newsletter and a free personal ad.
