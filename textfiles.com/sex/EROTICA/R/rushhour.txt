                                Rush Hour

        I was right where I'd wanted to be for a long time -- she had started
slowly, flogging me gently, kissing me with her whips.  Now my mind was close
to snapping, waves of pain-as-pleasure eroding my last resistance.  I knew 
that as good as it was now, I couldn't take much more.  
        She settled it with a hard *crack* from one of her more devilish 
instruments....fire spread through my body and brain, and I could take no
more.....I breathed the word "yellow", scarce able to get it through my 
lips.  And then I screamed as blow after blow landed with stunning ferocity
on my backside.  I thrashed, I screamed, I howled and shook with this 
betrayal, and then gave in to darkness.
        When I awoke, lifting my head groggily, I found I was unbound, and
she was packing the last of her toys into her bag.  She turned and headed 
for the door without a backward glance.  
        "Wait!" I managed to croak.  
        "Yes?"  She paused at the door.
        "Why....Why did you keep going...after I called yellow...and so hard?
Are you so cruel?" 
        She seemed puzzled.
        "I was trying to make the light before it turned red.  Everyone 
knows yellow means go like hell."
        She blew me a kiss and walked out.
