          Thomas skidded his bike to a stop in front Pogo's and jumped 
       off.  He put down the kick stand and went inside.  The familiar 
       jingle of the little bells tinkling overhead as the door opened 
       and closed still held a kind of magic charm for him.  At first 
       he didn't see anyone and thought briefly that the old store was 
       empty, then old man Anderson's head peered at him from behind 
       the counter, just barely visible over the top of the counter. 

          "Oh, hello again Thomas," he called out raising up and 
       planting his hands on the counter top.

          "What can I do for you today?"

          "I came by to get that other pack of film," he smiled as he 
       walked up.  Anderson looked surprised. 

          "Already?  I wasn't expecting you back so quick," he said 
       with raised eyebrows.

          Thomas was about to say something about finding a lot of 
       things to photograph when he saw a mop of brown hair behind the 
       counter.  All he could see was just a mass of brown, curly hair 
       with a pair of light blue barrettes in the shape of bows on 
       either side.  Anderson saw his quizzical expression and 
       chuckled. 

          "Sherry, say hello to young master Thomas," he said.

          A pretty young girl of about seven or eight stuck her head up 
       and smiled shyly.  Beneath that mop of curly brown were a pair 
       of the most mischievous blue eyes he'd ever seen, as well as the 
       deepest dimples.  A splattering of tiny freckles crossed her 
       nose and he was suddenly struck by how much she favored Laura. 

          "Sherry's my granddaughter," Anderson explained, "and she's 
       spending the summer with us.  Grandma's in town today visiting 
       the doctor so Sherry's spending the day with me at the store."

          "You've got a terrific grandpa," he told her, smiling. 

          "I know," she giggled.  There was a musical quality to even 
       her girlish giggle that appealed to him. 

          "Now, now, you two will be making me blush!" Anderson laughed 
       amiably.  "Now what kind of film was that again?" 

          "Polaroid 600."

          "Ah yes.  Now where did I put that?  I have it around here 
       somewhere," he muttered rifling through the myriad of drawers 
       and cubbyholes around him. 

          Thomas leaned over the counter trying to see if he could help 
       spot the wayward film pack.  His gaze stopped on something pink 
       on the floor nearly out of sight at the base of the counter.  
       Leaning over further he saw it was a girls pink panty, trimmed 
       with white lace.  He looked more closely at Sherry.  She had on 
       a short baby-blue and white dress and white sneakers.  There was 
       nothing to indicate the panties belonged to her, yet Thomas was 
       suddenly suspicious.  Then he felt ashamed.  If he weren't 
       screwing around with Heather, he told himself, he wouldn't have 
       even thought it.

          Anderson was walking by and he looked the other way not 
       wanting him to see his guilt.  Out of the corner of his eye he 
       caught him trying to nudge the panty further under the counter 
       with his shoe while still searching.  When he'd finally got them 
       out of sight he glanced furtively in his direction.  Thomas 
       pretended not to have noticed anything, staring off in the other 
       direction.  This seemed to relieve him. 

          "Have you taken some sexy pictures of your sisters?" he asked 
       jokingly. 

          Thomas didn't flinch.  He kept his voice steady and replied, 
       "Uh-huh, but only of Heather.  Lots of 'em." 

          This time it was Mr. Anderson who looked around, startled.  
       Then he laughed.

          "You got me that time, ol' bud!  I wasn't expecting that.  
       Bring them in and let me look at them."

          "Well, I really couldn't do that.  They're kind of special," 
       he grinned.

          "Why not?  They aren't all that sexy, are they?"

          Anderson was trying to act nonchalant but Thomas could tell 
       he'd gotten to him.  And because he HAD gotten to him Thomas was 
       also pretty sure those were Sherry's panties behind the counter!  
       He wondered what he'd interrupted when he came in.  He recalled 
       Mr. Anderson had been out of sight behind there.

          "Sexy enough," he laughed.  "Besides, Heather wouldn't like 
       it if I showed them to anyone."

          "Oh, surely she wouldn't mind if you were to show ME her 
       pictures," he insisted.  Thomas didn't answer. 

          Old man Anderson continued to search while casting furtive 
       glances in his direction.

          "Ah, here we are!" he exclaimed producing the remaining film 
       pack.  He set it on the counter in front of him and scrutinized 
       him.

          "Well what do you say?" he smiled.

          "Thank you Mr. Anderson," he replied politely.

          "No, no, I mean the pictures.  All joking aside.  I know 
       there's nothing really sexy about them.  I just happen to think 
       your sisters are very pretty young ladies and I'd like to see 
       some photographs of them." 

          Thomas looked at him and smiled broadly.

          "I tell you what I'll do Mr. Anderson.  I happen to think 
       your granddaughter is also very pretty.  You take some pictures 
       of Sherry and show them to me the next time I come in.  I'll 
       take some of Heather just exactly like them and show you.  Fair 
       enough?" 

          Anderson looked at him hard for a moment, obviously trying to 
       determine if he was assessing Thomas's meaning correctly,  then 
       smiled. 

          "Fair enough!" he said slapping him on the shoulder.  He rang 
       up the film and Thomas stole a glance at Sherry.  She was 
       staring at him still smiling.
