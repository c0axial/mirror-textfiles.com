
THE SKY WAS DARK
THE MOON WAS HIGH
ALL ALONE
JUST HER AND I
HER HAIR SO SOFT
HER EYES SO BLUE
I KNEW JUST WHAT
SHE WANTED TO DO
HER SKIN SO SOFT
HER LEGS SO FINE
I RAN MY FINGERS
DOWN HER SPINE
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
BUT I TRIED MY BEST
I STARTED BY PLACING
MY HANDS ON HER BREAST
I REMEMBER MY FEAR
MY FAST BEATING HEART
BUT SLOWLY I SPREAD
HER LEGS APART
AND WHEN I DID IT
I FELT NO SHAME
AND ALL AT ONCE
THE WHITE STUFF CAME
AT LAST ITS FINISHED
ITS ALL OVER NOW
MY FIRST TIME EVER
MILKING A COW.
