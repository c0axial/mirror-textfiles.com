       It had been only three days since his last visit and Thomas 
       hadn't planned on going to Pogo's today.  It just sort of 
       happened that way.  He and Randy and Danny walker had spent the 
       entire day riding bikes and doing everything they could think up 
       to entertain themselves. 

          As morning turned to late afternoon he'd had enough.  They 
       had ridden together as far as Steve's house and Thomas left his 
       two companions.  Since Steve lived near the little store he 
       decided to spend some of his precious money on a soda.  He 
       didn't ask them to come along because he knew they'd ask him to 
       buy them a soft-drink as well.  This time when he entered the 
       store Mr. Anderson was clearly visible. 

          Thomas walked to the far side where the cold beverages were 
       and got a bottle of Big Red, then proceeded to the check-out 
       counter where a smiling Mr. Anderson greeted him.

          "Good afternoon Master Thomas.  I trust you are well?"

          "Hi Mr. Anderson.  I'm okay.  How about you?"

          "I'm old.  Anytime I can get out of bed I'm doing well," he 
       grinned taking the dollar bill Thomas slid across the counter 
       top.  When he returned with the change he plopped down a stack 
       of five Polaroids with it.

          "Here's a few photos I took of Sherry.  Look them over.  I 
       think you'll agree she's a pretty little girl," he said. 

          Thomas took the photographs and examined them.  He realized 
       they must have been taken the same day he'd picked up his film 
       pack because she was still wearing the same blue and white dress 
       and blue barrettes. 

          It was taken outdoors, as it turned out they all were.  She 
       was standing in a well manicured lawn with a the back of a smart 
       white frame house as a backdrop.  Thomas decided it must be the 
       Anderson's place.  Sherry was facing the camera with that big, 
       dimpled smile he liked so much.  The next two were pretty much 
       the same.  In the forth she was climbing a tree.  Anderson had 
       gotten beneath her enough that the camera was looking up her 
       dress.  He couldn't help but notice she was wearing the pink 
       panties he'd seen Mr. Anderson trying to hide, complete with the 
       same white lace trim. 

          It was the last photograph that surprised him.  This photo 
       was also taken outdoors but the house backdrop was gone, 
       replaced by a weathered, reddish-brown structure, probably a 
       barn.  Sherry stood, hands on hips, beaming happily at the 
       camera clad only in the pink panty and barrettes.  Even her feet 
       were bare. 

          Thomas's trance was broken as Anderson's gnarled hand covered 
       the pictures and pulled them away.

          "I believe it's your turn, my friend.  Here, you can keep 
       this one," he said sliding the first photo he'd looked at toward 
       him. 

          Thomas glanced up.  The old man's face was a mask, showing 
       nothing.  He took the photo and studied the girl again.  He 
       wanted the last one but knew without asking that Anderson would 
       not let him have it.  Not yet anyway.  And at that instant he 
       made a decision. 

          "I'll need another film pack," he said.
                     ......................................
           
           



          Two days later he was back.  Several customers were inside so 
       he flipped through Spiderman and Wonder Woman until he was the 
       only one left.  Then he wandered over carrying the two comics with 
       him. 

          Anderson took his money and rang them up without comment.

          "Anything else I can get you?" he asked handing him the 
       receipt.

          Thomas plopped five polaroids on the counter top.  Anderson 
       looked at him quizzically, an uncertain half-smile tugging at 
       the corners of his mouth.  He picked up the stack with hands 
       that trembled slightly.  The photos were of Heather, taken in 
       the little clearing of their "secret place".  Thomas made sure 
       she had on a dress and pink panties.  As with Sherry, the first 
       three were just of her smiling at the camera. 

          In the forth photograph however, he'd had to improvise.  
       Their hideout had no trees large enough for him to stand under 
       while she climbed over his head, so he had her hike up her dress 
       and put one leg up on a small, low-hanging limb like she was 
       climbing while he sat on the ground behind her.  The end result 
       was even better than the one Anderson took. 

          By the time Mr. Anderson got to the fifth picture his hands 
       were shaking.  There she was, hands on hips, wearing only her 
       panties and a gorgeous smile.

          Thomas watched him nearly drool as his eyes roamed over the 
       image, lingering on the little buds of her tiny budding breasts, 
       burning holes into the photo.  Then, in one quick motion, Thomas 
       retrieved them from his shaking hands before Anderson even had 
       time to protest. 

          "Here," Thomas said tossing the first photo to him, "you can 
       have this one."  He turned away and started for the door. 

          "Wait just a second," Anderson wheezed. 

          Thomas stopped and turned back, raising an eyebrow curiously.  

       Anderson smiled, and licked his suddenly dry lips.

          "How did you get her to..."

          Anderson seemed to grope for words.  A sheen of perspiration 
       glistened on his balding forehead and he swabbed at it nervously 
       with a handkerchief.

          "....to pose like that?" he finished lamely.

          "Oh, she'll do just about anything for me," he replied 
       vaguely.

          "Do you think she'd... uh... pose for me too?"  Anderson was 
       still licking his lips and watching him closely.

          "No.  If anyone else even suggested it, she'd go screaming to 
       our parents."  Thomas wasn't lying about either statement.  
       Anderson seemed to know that as well.

          "Wouldn't you get in trouble too?"  

          Thomas understood that the old man was trying to work his way 
       into a position of whereupon he might have some influence over 
       him.  He'd already planned for it. 

          "Yeah, but at least I wouldn't go to jail," he countered 
       simply and truthfully. 

          Anderson's hard stare slowly turned to a grudging smile of 
       respect.

          "But you can get her to pose for you anyway you want?"  Then, 
       without waiting for an answer he gushed, "Perhaps we could work 
       something out?" 

          Thomas shrugged.  He was in the drivers seat now and he 
       wanted to head this bus in a direction that would allow him to 
       park it in a pretty little brown-haired girls honey-hole!  But 
       he didn't want Anderson wise yet. 

          "Maybe we could trade...?" Anderson suggested when he didn't 
       answer.

          "Maybe you should bring me some more pictures of Sherry.  
       I'll duplicate with Heather any picture you bring me.  You sign 
       yours and I'll sign mine.  Even up trades.  When I can afford 
       the film," he added quickly.

          Anderson pondered a moment, all the while studying Thomas.  
       After a few more seconds of silent deliberation he smiled. 

          "It's a deal!  How soon do you want to do this?"  Anderson 
       seemed genuinely excited. 

          "How soon can you bring me some samples?"

          The old man looked around the empty store as though someone 
       might be lingering nearby, then motioned to him.

          "Come around here," he said indicating the narrow entrance.  
       Thomas moved behind the counter where the old man produced an 
       envelope with another five photos.  Thomas took them and propped 
       his elbows on the counter to study them.

          The first was a mate to the one at the barn, except Sherry's 
       panties were pulled down to her knees.

          The second: panties completely gone, back to camera.  Thomas 
       saw her bottom was nicely rounded and he wondered if old man 
       Anderson had forced his meat up her tight little butt yet. 

          The third: Sherry was bent over looking back at the camera 
       between her spread legs.  Thomas smiled at the similarity 
       between this photo, and the one he'd taken of Heather that first 
       day. 

          The forth: Sherry leaning against the barn facing the camera 
       with her legs parted.

          It was the fifth photograph that took his breath away.  They 
       were not at the barn.  It was obviously taken inside the house.  
       Sherry was on an ornate sofa squatting on her toes, knees 
       splayed wide open exposing the little button of her clitoris.  
       Her broad, dimpled smile was captivating as she proudly exposed 
       herself.  His eyes lingered on her sex.  Her pubic mound was 
       redder than in the other pictures. Her little button looked 
       slightly swollen and definitely a little redder than normal, 
       certainly much more so than in the other pictures.  He knew from 
       the photos and what he knew of Heather, that Anderson had taken 
       this last photo after giving her little sex-button a workout and 
       wondered about it.  He felt another flash of envy, then pushed 
       it aside. 

          "Well?" Anderson asked softly, scarcely breathing.

          "No problem," he replied.  "I'll take care of it soon.  I 
       don't have enough film now."

          Anderson produced another film pack and handed it to him.
          "It's on me," he said.  "You can have these as soon as you 
       bring your set." 

          "Great.  If things work out... who knows?  Maybe I could get 
       Heather to...."

          Thomas deliberately let his words trail off to entice him.
          "To what?"

          Anderson looked like he was about to explode.

          Thomas smiled, pocketing the film pack as he turned and 
       walked to the door.

          "Well, let's just wait and see before I make any promises.  I 
       wouldn't want to say anything before I see the kind of pictures 
       I'll have to work with."  He left the store before Anderson 
       could ask any more questions.  Thomas wanted him curious and 
       anxious for more.  He needn't have worried.
