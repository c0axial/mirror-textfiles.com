	He walks into the room with a proud step.  There she is, stradling a
chair with one leg over the top.  Her hair is falling down her back and her
lips are painted bright red.  Her body is clothed in black leather with her
nipples and cunt showing through slits in the leather.  He could see her
nipples hard and her cunt moist and he felt himself growing hard.  She raises
her finger to her lips as if to silence him but instead lets it fall between
her lips.  In and out it goes and then down the length of her body.  
	She stands up, her legs in stockings and high heels. She takes his hand
and leads him to the bed.  She unbuttons his shirt and slides it off his back. 
She starts a trail of kisses down his chest and stops at his navel while she
quickly sheds his pants.  Her kisses continue and then stops at his point of
pleasure. She laughs.
	She pushes him down on the bed and handcuffs him to the headboard.  She
smiles as does he.  She then gets on the bed and stands above him, letting her
hips gyrate to an unheard song. She goes down almost within his reach and then
moves back up.  His eyes glisten with desire.  He could smell her and his lips
desired her moistness.  He looks up at her pleadingly, but she simply shakes
her head.
	She sits on him.  His dick feels the wetness and strains to get more. 
She moves slowly, sliding up and down his torso.  Quickly she stands up and
then squats down near his face.  He could see her cunt clearly, breathing its
life.  Her finger starts spreading her own lips and running them up and down. 
Her hand moves back and in slides one, two, three fingers.  In and out, in and
out, faster and faster until he groans.  She then moves to her clit.  Opening
it up and leting him see.  Her finger grazes it, lightly, but he could see it
quiver.  Her finger unable to control itself starts to rub and circle as her
breath quickens.  Her moans start slow but soon they are continous.  At the
moment before orgasm she drops down and lets his tongue finsih the job as she
squeezes her nipples.
	She tries to get up but now that he has what he wants, he is not going
to let it go.  His tongue works magic and she finds she is not able to leave. 
Again and again the waves of orgasms come until she collapses with exhastion
atop his sweaty body.  She looks up and sees him smile and sees the gloating
look in his eyes.  She is not about to be taken.  She will get her revenge.
	Her head slowly moves down to his groin and she breathes on his cock. 
She hears him catch his breath.  She slowly takes his prick into her soft
inviting mouth.  The shaft hard and throbbing, her lips tightly around its base
while her tongue draws designs on the inside.  Her mouth becomes a  haven for
his dick and he moans at her deftness. Her mouth starts moving at a frantic
pace.  Her tongue moving with its own desire.  His body tenses and she stops. 
She removes her mouth, looks at him and smiles.  His eyes plead with her to
continue and at that her head goes down to finish the job.  
	He lays there for a while and then starts to struggle.  He wanted the
handcuffs off so he could touch her body.  She just smiles and shakes her head
no.
