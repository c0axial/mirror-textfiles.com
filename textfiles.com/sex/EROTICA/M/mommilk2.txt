MOTHER'S MILK

The heavy, pouring rain came down in sheets making visibility almost imposs=
ible.  Wayne struggled to see out the window of his Jeep Cherokee.  His mot=
her, Krista sat in the other bucket seat peering out through the suffocatin=
g deluge of water.  Every few moments, Krista turned and looked out the rea=
r window for a few seconds before looking back to the front.

"I hope that they are okay," she mumbled.

"Oh, they'll be fine," Wayne told her, hoping that he was right.

Wayne's whole family was driving up to their cabin in the mountain for a mi=
ni-vacation.  Tony, Wayne's father, Kim,  Krista's sister, and Wayne's litt=
le sister, Marie were in the second car somewhere behind them.  They had ta=
ken both cars because Kim had to return on Tuesday.  Wayne, Krista, Tony, a=
nd Marie were planning to leave the following Friday. =


When they had started out earlier that morning, it had been sprinkling, but=
 it had turned into a steady rain before very long.  The rain had continued=
 to intensify all morning long turning the drive into a real ordeal.

They had stopped both cars  in Emoryville around Twelve.  They had refueled=
 and eaten lunch. When they had stopped, Kim had talked Krista into letting=
 her take little Marie for the last leg of the trip since they only had abo=
ut an hour left to go.  Although Marie was only a month old, they didn't th=
ink being separated from her mother for an hour would hurt her.  Anxious to=
 get to the cabin, Wayne and Krista had left before than Tony and the other=
s.  They hadn't seen them or their headlights since they had left.  =


Glancing down at his watch, Wayne saw that it had been an hour since they h=
ad stopped.  =

"I think I see the turn off," he said, slowing the car.
"That's it," Krista confirmed as Wayne steered the car off the highway ont=
o the narrow black topped road.  =

"Be sure to stay on the road," his mother cautioned him, watching him care=
fully guide the car down the narrow lane, "if we get stuck, we'll never get=
 out of this mud."
"You've got that right," he chuckled nervously.
They crept down the road until they came to a rickety bridge.  Stopping the=
 car, Wayne got out and plodded over to the bridge and looked down.  The st=
ream, usually quiet and slow was now a roaring river of deep, muddy water. =
 Staring into the dark, swirling water below, he watched the surge of the w=
ater crashing against the bridge's supports.  They looked rather fragile, b=
ut they seemed to be withstanding to force of the river.
"What do you think?"
"What," he jumped, not knowing his mother had joined him. =

He had been staring into the water so intently, he hadn't heard his mother =
get out of the car and walk up beside him. =

"Do you think we can make it?"
"Uh, I guess," he muttered, "what do you think?"
"It looks okay to me," she said walking a few feet out onto the bridge and=
 timidly jumping up and down, "it feels sturdy enough."
"Okay, let's try it," he shouted over the noise of the river.
"God, I'm drenched," his mother laughed tiredly as they got back into the =
car, "I can't wait to get to the cabin and get a fire going."
"Well, here goes," Wayne said, putting the car into gear and slowly easing=
 it out onto the bridge.  =

The bridge seemed to be holding its own as they slowly inched across it.  T=
he bridge was at least fifty feet across, but it took them two or three min=
utes to creep three-quarters of the way across it.
Then, all at once, without warning, they felt the bridge wobble and shift u=
nder them.
"Oh, God," Krista screamed "It's collapsing."
As Wayne felt the first sickening lurch, he instantly slammed the accelerat=
or to the floor.  For one long, terrifying moment, it felt like the car and=
 the bridge were both going to crash into the water below.  But at the last=
 moment, the tires grabbed and shot the car toward the other side of the ri=
ver and safety.

Neither of them could speak as the car roared across the final few feet tow=
ard the shore.  Then, just as the front wheels touched solid ground, they f=
elt the back end of the car stagger and slip sideways even more.  Time seem=
ed to stop.  Holding their breath, they prayed until the car finally bounde=
d off the bridge.  Just as the back tires cleared the bridge, the bridge we=
nt crashing down into the water behind them.  Lady Luck had been riding wit=
h them.  =

Wayne slammed on the brakes, trying to keep the car from skidding off the r=
oad and into the mud.  After skidding several feet, the car finally stopped=
 only inches from the soft, treachery of the road's shoulder.
Wayne sat unmoving, his hands digging into the steering wheel for several m=
oments.  Finally, he looked over at his mother.  She was white as a sheet a=
s she sat staring out into the rain pouring down on the hood of the car.  A=
t last she turned and looked over at him, smiling weakly.
 "My, God, that was close," his mother sighed.
"You can say that again," he said.
After a few minutes, his hands had stopped shaking enough for him to open t=
he car door.  Pushing it open, he stepped out into the pouring rain once ag=
ain.  Closing the door, he saw his mother step out of the car on the other =
side.
Both of them wobbled back over to where only moments earlier the bridge had=
 stood.  Now there was nothing but a few broken, shattered pilings jutting =
up out of the cold, swirling water below.  The twisted, broken supports wer=
e the only evidence that the bridge had once stood there.
"Another five seconds and we'd be at the bottom of the river," he groaned,=
 feeling his legs almost buckle under him, "God, that was close."
Neither of them spoke for several moments as they stared down into the dark=
, muddy water rushing past them.  =

"Uh-oh, here comes Tony and Marie," his mother suddenly blurted out.
"Go get your cel phone and call them, quick," Wayne yelled as he started w=
aving his arms frantically, trying to get them to stop them before they dro=
ve off into the river.
Krista turned and dashed through the rain to the car.  Flinging the door op=
en, she dove inside.  Tearing open her purse, she jammed her hand inside an=
d pulled out her phone.  Quickly jabbing at the keys, she lifted it to her =
ear. =

"Come on, Damn it, answer it," she muttered, staring out at the other car =
as it slowly approached the opposite side of the river.
"Yeah, is this Kim," her sister finally said.
"Yes.  Thank God you answered.  The bridge is out."
"Yeah, we saw Wayne waving his arms and slowed down."
No one spoke for several moments as they all watched Wayne wearily trudge b=
ack to his car.  =

"Well, now what?" he asked, sliding in under the steering wheel.
"I don't know," she mumbled, trying to think what to do.
It was obvious that Tony, Kim, and Marie were not going to cross the river =
any time soon.  They could turn around and go back to Emoryville and spend =
the night.  Even though Krista was still nursing Marie, she had packed plen=
ty of formula so that wouldn't be a problem for the immediate future.  But =
with the bridge down and it still raining, she didn't know how long she wou=
ld be separated from her baby.  She and Wayne had all the food, so they cou=
ld go on up to the cabin and stay there until someone figured a way to get =
them back across the river.
She discussed their alternatives with Tony for several minutes.  Since it w=
as already one o'clock in the afternoon, he finally agreed that he, Kim, an=
d Marie would return to Emoryville and spend the night there.  He would che=
ck in with the Sheriff and let him know they were stranded.  He would get b=
ack with her later and let her know what kind of plan he and the Sheriff co=
uld come up with.  =

Closing her cel phone, she explained to Wayne what they had decided.  Agree=
ing with her, Wayne looked into the rear view mirror.  Both of them watched=
 anxiously as Tony slowly, carefully backed away from the river.  It seemed=
 to take hours, but finally his father's car backed out onto the highway an=
d disappeared into the torrential rain.
"Well, Lone Ranger, I guess we are on our own," Krista grinned tensely.
"I guess, so, Tonto," he replied, slowly shifting into low and letting out=
 on the clutch pedal.
At last they stopped in front of the cabin and both sat watching the rain b=
eat down on the hood of his car. The drive to the cabin had seemed to take =
hours, but Wayne hadn't gotten above five miles an hour. =

As they stared out into the downpour, it seemed like the rain was getting e=
ven heavier instead of letting up.
"Do you know how long a cubic is?" Wayne laughed wearily.
"Nope, but we may need to learn if it keeps up like this much longer," his=
 mother replied.
"Well, I sure don't want to have to start looking animals by the pair," he=
 grinned.
"I don't know," she sighed, "but I have a pair that are beginning to ache.=
"
"Pardon?" he blushed, not believing what he had heard.
"Don't be such a prude," she chided him good-naturedly, "it's been almost =
five hours since I nursed Marie and my breasts are getting a little full an=
d sore."
"MOTHER," he sputtered, turning bright red under all the water coating his=
 face, "you're embarrassing me."
"Okay, Mr. Prude," she laughed, opening her door, "let's get this car unlo=
aded."
Wayne stepped out into the rain, grateful for anything that would hide his =
crimson face.  He couldn't believe his mother had said what she did.  After=
 all, it was his mother and he hadn't been prepared for her remark.  Stoppi=
ng, for a moment, he stood in the pouring rain thinking about her breasts. =
 The thought of her breasts, big and swollen, full of mother's milk sent a =
bolt of excitement tearing into his brain.  Shuddering, he looked up and le=
t the cold wetness of the rain splash into his face, hoping it would wash a=
way his impure thoughts. =

At last, he looked and saw his mother impatiently standing by the rear of t=
he car.  Shamefully, he rushed around and threw open the trunk.  They both =
grabbed as much as they could and hurried over to the cabin.  He deposited =
his load on the porch and went back to the car while his mother unlocked th=
e cabin.  =

After the first load, he had made his mother stay inside while he trudged b=
ack and forth unloading the car.  It took him thirty minutes in the driving=
 rain to off-load all of the stuff they had brought, but at least it kept h=
is mind off what his mother had said for a little while. =

As he unloaded, his mother would sort it in appropriate piles.  When he mad=
e the last trip inside, he closed the door behind him and dropped the last =
things on the table.
"Here, here is your suitcase," his mother told him handing him his bag, "y=
ou hurry up and change into something dry before you catch your death of co=
ld.  Then you can start a fire while I change."
He kicked off his muddy shoes and plodded wetly into the single bathroom in=
 the cabin.  Closing the door behind him, he quickly stripped down and towe=
led off the rainwater.  He had been so wet, it felt like he had just taken =
a frigid shower.  Looking at himself in the mirror, he thoughts sudden went=
 back to his mother.  He wondered what she would look like naked.  Blushing=
 with shame, he could stop his cock from starting to swell.  Angry at himse=
lf for thinking such thoughts, he dried his hair and pulled out a pair of l=
oose shorts and a sweater.  A weird combination, he thought, but after he g=
ot the fire going, he knew how warm the small cabin would be.
The cabin only had four real rooms.  Two bedrooms, a bathroom and a combina=
tion den, kitchen, living room.  The big rock fireplace would have the whol=
e cabin warm in little more than an hour, if he remembered correctly.
Stepping out of the bathroom, he saw that his mother was waiting impatientl=
y for him to finish.
"It's about time," she remarked, striding purposefully toward the bathroom=
=2E "I thought you had died in there."
"You look like a drowned rat," he laughed as she walked by him her hair pl=
astered to her head wetly. =

Drenched and bedraggled from wading around in the rain all day, she was sti=
ll cute.  Cute.  The word seemed to be made for her, he thought, as he went=
 about starting the fire.  Yes, she was pretty, but not a raving beauty.  C=
ute, yes, that was her.  But very cute.  And her figure, he blushed just th=
inking about it. Her body looked great for her age.  He had had plenty of o=
pportunity to watch her during the summer as she lounged around the pool in=
 her swim suit.  But that was before she became pregnant with Marie.  He ha=
dn't actually seen her figure displayed in a swimsuit since Marie had been =
born, so he really didn't know what she looked like now.
Then, scolding himself for thinking about his mother in such a way, he set =
about getting the fire going. =

He could hear the shower running as he struggled to start the fire. Wonderi=
ng what she looked like, he thought about sneaking over and peeking through=
 the keyhole.  Scolding  himself for thinking such a thought, he went back =
to starting the fire.  =


Thankfully, he and his dad had brought in a week's supply of wood the last =
time they had been at the cabin. If they hadn't, he would never have gotten=
 a fire going.  As he tried, tiny tendrils of flame finally began to lick a=
t the wood and soon the fire was blazing away.  Squatting in front of the f=
ire, he poked at it as his thoughts returned to his mother.  He had heard t=
he other boy's talking about pregnant women and women with babies at school=
=2E  They had said that their breasts got gigantic and all full of milk and=
 stuff.  They even said that if a woman didn't have a baby to suck on her t=
its, they would get painful and have all kinds of problems.  Wayne  had nev=
er really thought of his mother like that until he saw her nursing Marie on=
e day.  Then he found it embarrassing to hear the boys talking about women =
that way.  But, in spite of himself, he found himself trying to sneak anoth=
er peek of his mother's breasts.  He had seen them once and it had scared h=
im.  He thought that they would just be bigger and he wasn't prepared for t=
heir size and whiteness.  Ashamed that he was thinking about her, he sudden=
ly found himself hard.  Blushing, he quickly stood up and started to straig=
hten himself.
Just as he grabbed his cock through his pants to reposition it, his mother =
stepped out of the bathroom.  She was wearing a soft, pink bathrobe and dry=
ing her hair with a big, white towel.
Both of them stopped and stared at each other for several uncomfortable mom=
ents.  Then, Wayne turned away from her and shoved his swollen maleness int=
o a more comfortable position.
"Are you okay?" his mother asked, strolling toward him with her arms above=
 her head drying her hair.
"Uh, Yeah, uh, sure," he muttered, looking back at her.
As she padded across the room toward him in her bare feet, he couldn't keep=
 himself from letting his eyes dip down to her jutting breasts.  In his inf=
lamed state, her breasts seemed to be huge as they swelled out under her so=
ft, cotton bathrobe.
"Are you sure you're okay?" she smiled at him with a questioning look on h=
er face, "You're face is fire-engine red."
"Yeah, uh, I guess it is just the fire," he mumbled, "I was too close."
"Oh," she said, stepping up beside him and dropping the towel to the floor=
=2E  =

She didn't say anything for several moments as she stood beside him warming=
 her hands.  He was afraid to move and stood waiting anxiously.  As he wait=
ed, he couldn't keep from glancing back down at the swell of her breasts un=
der the thick, fleecy bathrobe.  Was she naked underneath it, he wondered a=
nd felt his penis twitch again.
"Why don't you get us a glass of wine," she finally said, turning and faci=
ng him.  "We can have a little before dinner to celebrate our escape from d=
rowning."
"Uh, Sure, Good idea," he blurted out, glad for any chance to move away fr=
om her.
"I didn't get a chance to thank you for you what you did this afternoon," =
she said softly, leaning over and giving him a soft, loving kiss on the che=
ek.  "You probably saved our lives."
"Awww Mom," he said modestly as his face reddened once again.
Self-consciously, he stumbled back away from her.
"Really," she smiled at him, "we would probably have been swept to our dea=
ths if you hadn't reacted so quickly."
"Anybody would have done the same thing," he said, hoping she wouldn't not=
ice the bulge in his shorts as he hurried over to the cabinet. =

He found several bottles of wine in the cabinet and took one down.  As he w=
as awkwardly struggling to open it, he secretly watched his mother out of t=
he corner of his eye.  She was leaning over, letting the fire dry her soft,=
 short curly brown hair.  As he watched, her robe fell open just enough to =
give him a view of one, big, bare breast .  So she was naked underneath it,=
 he thought to himself as his penis lurched again and he nearly dropped the=
 wine bottle.
"Are you having a hard time?" she asked from across the room.
"Uh, no, it, the, cork, is, uh, just a little stiff," he muttered, wonderi=
ng if her pun had been by accident.
"Need some help, Hon," she asked him, turning slightly so that her robe ba=
llooned open ever wider.
"Uh, No, uh, Mom," he gulped, trying to keep his eyes glued on her big, sw=
ollen breast and uncork the bottle both at the same time.
He could see almost all of her big, white breast all the way down to the ri=
ng of dark, mysterious flesh surrounding her nipple.  Straining to see more=
, he couldn't quite make out her nipple.
"I sure am getting thirsty," she said at last.
Tearing his eyes away from her breast, he looked up to see that she had bee=
n watching him.  He blushed almost purple as he realized that she had known=
 he was watching and did nothing to stop him.
"Do you find my breasts interesting?" she said, finally raising up and pul=
ling her robe together.
"MOTHER," he groaned, his mind in a turmoil of confusion.
"Well, you were looking at them, weren't you?"
He couldn't speak.  Shamed and humiliated beyond belief, he couldn't find a=
ny words to express his mortification.
She didn't say anything else for several moments.  =

His hands were shaking so badly, it took him forever to fill the glasses wi=
th wine.  Still blushing brightly, he slowly stumbled back over to his moth=
er.  Wine dribbled and ran down the glass as he handed it to her with his t=
rembling hand.
"It's okay," she smiled softly, reaching out and taking his hand in hers t=
o stop the shaking.
He didn't know what to say or do.  She finally peeled his frozen fingers fr=
om around the glass and took it from him.  Smiling at him warmly, she slowl=
y took a long sip of her wine.
Suddenly coming to life, Wayne took a drink from his glass, almost emptying=
 it in his first gulp.
"My, you were thirsty, too" she laughed warmly.
"I sure was," he blurted out, finishing his drink.
Using his empty glass as an excuse to leave her presence once again, he wal=
ked back over to the bottle.
Refilling his glass, he turned and saw that his mother was sitting on the c=
ouch in front of the fire.  She had her long, lovely legs curled up under h=
er and she was smiling warmly at him.
"Come on over here and sit down by me," she smiled at him, patting the cou=
ch by her.
"Uh, uh, okay," he mumbled, tripping and nearly falling as he started towa=
rd her.
"Bring the bottle with you," she told him.
Stopping, he went back and got the bottle.  Carrying it with him, he walked=
 over and sat down on the couch next to his mother.  The air was filled wit=
h the clean, fresh fragrance of her soap as both of them sat staring into t=
he fire.  Time passed slowly as they made small talk and finished the bottl=
e of wine. =

"Why don't you lay your head in my lap and take a nap like you used to do =
when you were younger?" she finally asked him.
"Uh, uh, okay," he said, setting his empty glass down on the floor.

Maneuvering around on the couch, he gently lowered his head down onto the s=
oftness of her lap.  The clean, sweet bouquet of her freshly washed body fi=
lled his nostrils and brought back fond memories of his youth as he lay loo=
king up at her.  He saw her smile warmly as she slowly ran her fingers thro=
ugh his hair.  Her breasts, the source of his earlier embarrassment were no=
w jutting out  only inches above his face. Only the thick, fleecy covering =
of terry cloth hid them from his eyes.
Drinking in her pleasant scent, he slowly closed his eyes.  Listening to th=
e sound of rain splashing against the windows, he found himself getting dro=
wsy.  The dull roar of the continuous rain was broken occasionally when one=
 of the logs in the fire place would crack and pop.  Relaxed by the wine, t=
he fire, the rain and the almost intoxicating nearness of his mother, he fe=
lt himself slowly drifting off into sleep.
Wayne didn't know how long he had been asleep, but he could still hear the =
rain beating against the side of the house as he slowly floated back to con=
sciousness.  Letting himself awaken  slowly, he suddenly realized that his =
cheek was wet.  Had the roof sprang a leak, he wondered.  It wouldn't surpr=
ise him as hard as it was raining.  Slowly, he opened his eyes and found hi=
mself staring up at his mother's bare breast.  Stunned, he saw that his mot=
her's robe had somehow fallen open baring her breast.  Not able to believe =
his eyes, he saw that her big, bulging nipple was brushing against his chee=
k.  Then he saw a tiny trickle of white juice leaking out of the swollen pa=
p.  Staring at the distended pink knob of flesh, he watched in fascination =
as the little stream of mother's milk continued to seep out and run down th=
e soft, curving underside of his mother's  beautiful breast.
Almost immediately, he felt his cock swell to aching hardness as he gawked =
at her breast with utter fascination.  Afraid to move, he basked in the she=
er debauchery of the moment.  At last, he tore his eyes from her breast and=
 saw that she had apparently fallen to sleep, too.  Her head had fallen ove=
r and she now slept with her cheek resting on her shoulder.  Quickly lookin=
g back down to her breast, he drank in the captivating view of bared breast=
=2E  He had forgotten how pale and white her breast was when he had see it =
earlier.  But now that he was so close to it, he could even see the delicat=
e, blue veins of blood under the transparent skin covering her breast. =

His quest was over.  The prize was now before him, openly displayed for his=
 voyeuristic depravity.  He watched it as it slowly rose and fell each time=
 his mother took a breath.  What would it be like to suck on the hard, puff=
iness of her nipple, he wondered perversely.  No, he couldn't do that, he t=
hought.  That would be too much.  What would his mother say if she woke and=
 found him sucking on her breast?  She would probably kill him.  Staring up=
 at the bright pink nipple, he couldn't stop himself from slowly turning hi=
s head toward her.  As he did, the hard, rubbery knob slid across his cheek=
 and his lips moved ever closer to the forbidden fruit.  At last, the hard =
puffiness of her big, bloated nipple touched his lip.
Then as a tiny trickle of his mother's thin, white milk trickled down onto =
his lips, he became so excited, he was about to cum.  He had never felt suc=
h excitement.  His whole body was throbbing with electricity as he slowly o=
pened his mouth.  As his lips parted, her distended, puffy nipple slipped b=
etween his lips.  He didn't move for several moments, but at last he gently=
 sucked on her nipple.  =

For a moment, nothing happened.  Then he saw his mother's eyes flicker open=
=2E  Terrified of what she would do, he lay as still as he could.  Her eyes=
 looked out aimlessly for a moment and then suddenly swept down to his face=
=2E  He didn't know what to do.  Time stopped as they stared into each othe=
r's eyes for the longest time.
Finally, she moved ever so slowly, reaching down and cupping his head her a=
rms, pulled him toward her, forcing her nipple farther into his mouth.
"Yes, please," she whispered, pressing his face into the soft, yielding fl=
esh of her swollen breast.  "Nurse and make my breasts stop aching."
Wayne was stunned and did nothing for a moment.  Then realizing that she wa=
nted him to nurse, he slowly started sucking on the great, swollen pap. =

As he began to suck, he was distressed as the bloated nipple grudgingly gav=
e up a thin, watery fluid for several moments. Thinking there would be more=
 milk, he wondered what he was doing wrong.  Then, as he began sucking hard=
er, he was alarmed when milk suddenly began to pour from the nipple. Seeing=
 his mother smile down at him approvingly, he began to suck harder as the t=
hickening sweetness of her milk began to gush into his mouth.  Somewhere de=
ep in his memory banks, the delicate, sweet, sugary flavor of her milk trig=
gered forgotten memories of his childhood.  He was now a tiny baby, sucking=
 at her breasts as her milk now poured into his mouth.  But even though his=
 mind had reverted to infancy, his maturing body was alive with excitement.=
  Swallowing as fast as he could, he still couldn't keep up with the flow a=
nd some of the frothy, white milk leaked out of his mouth and dripped down =
his chin.  Some innate primal force was guiding him now as he pushed his fa=
ce into her breast with soft insistence. As he sucked, he could feel the he=
aviness of her breast pushing back against his mouth.  He couldn't get enou=
gh of her sweet, precious cream as it poured from her breast.  Wanting more=
 and more, he unconsciously raised his hand up to her breast.  Wrapping his=
 hand around the jutting fullness of his mother's breast, he softly, but fi=
rmly began to milk her.
"Oh, yes, Baby, take all of Mommy's milk and make it stop hurting," she mu=
rmured, pressing his face into her breast even harder.
As he sucked, he could feel the swelling of her breast slowly diminishing a=
nd her body begin to relax.  After several minutes, he was gravely disappoi=
nted when the flow of milk slowed to a trickle and then stop.  Downcast tha=
t her breast was empty and there was now no reason for him to continue suck=
ing on her breast , he felt his mother shift her body and suddenly her nipp=
le popped out of his sucking mouth.  Like a child without a pacifier, his l=
ips continued to move, searching for her breast.  Then, weak from the earli=
er adrenaline rush, he watched in amazed wonderment as his mother opened he=
r robe and lifted her other beautiful, swollen breast out.  Turning slightl=
y, his mother lowered the big, round softness of her breast with its gliste=
ning pink cup down to his lips.  It was like giving a drink to a drowning m=
an as she slowly lowered the large, swollen nipple down to his lips.  Just =
as before, when he started sucking on it, it took several moments before he=
r rich, thick milk to begin to flow freely.  But, at last when her milk did=
 start to flow again, it quickly filled his mouth to overflowing once again=
=2E  Hungrily, he pulled at the rubbery nipple with his lips and mouth suck=
ing more and more of the pleasing sweetness of her foamy milk into his mout=
h.
"Oh, Yes, My, Baby," she murmured as he continued to suckle her.
Wayne's  swollen cock was throbbing with such fire pain, he knew that he co=
uldn't keep from cumming much longer.  He had never been so hard.  It was l=
ike having a knife shoved into his cock as it pulsated with excitement.  He=
 had never been so aroused by anything in his whole life.  =

As he sucked and suck, he was once again disappointed when the flow of milk=
 begin to decrease.  Afraid that his mother would take her breast away from=
 him when it stopped giving milk, he wondered what he could do to postpone =
the inevitable.  As he feverishly tried to think of a way to keep sucking o=
n her breast, he gently ran his tongue over the lactating nipple and felt h=
is mother's body stiffen in response.  Surprised by his mother's reaction, =
he stopped sucking so hard and began to tease the big, swollen nipple with =
his tongue.  Less and less milk flowed out, but his tongue became more and =
more insistent as he tickled and teased the bulging nipple.
"Mmmmmm, Babbbyyyyy," she sighed as her whole body relaxed.
As Wayne played with her nipple, he felt her legs underneath his head slowl=
y part.  Then, he was stunned when he felt his mother's pelvis tilt and gen=
tly press up against the back of his head.  Was she becoming excited, he wo=
ndered as he felt his cock lurch perilously close to an eruption. =

Tweaking and toying with her nipple, Wayne could no longer taste the intoxi=
cating sweetness of his mother's milk.  Even though the flow of milk had co=
mpletely stopped, his mother made no move to stop him.  She must be enjoyin=
g what he was doing, he thought.  The very idea that she would let him play=
 with her nipple without nursing stunned him.  Shocked, he eagerly renewed =
his assault on her ripe, bloated nipple. =

As he played with her nipple, he heard her make soft, little mewing sounds.=
  Excited even more, he continued to pull and nip at her bloated pap as he =
massaged and kneaded the soft flesh of her breast with his hands.
While he had initially thought that sucking her breast and drinking her mil=
k was the most thrilling thing he had ever done, this was even more excitin=
g.  Thinking about what he was doing sent emotions flowing through his body=
 that were almost overpowering.  He was actually playing with his mother's =
big, beautiful breasts and she was not going to stop him.
The soft, insistent pressure of her groin against the back of his head was =
growing harder and harder the longer he kept teasing her nipple.  Then with=
out warning, he felt his mother's hand drop from the back of the couch down=
 to his stomach.  He didn't know if it was an accident or if she had done i=
t on purpose, but her hand was now resting only inches from his throbbing, =
aching cock.  =

He began to massage and knead the soft, pliant flesh of his mother's breast=
 more and more confidently as she made no move to stop him.  =

Then his heart almost stopped when he felt his mother's hand slowly inch to=
ward his over-ripe maleness.  Was she consciously doing it or was it just a=
 reflex.  Either way, his cock had a hair trigger and he knew that it would=
 take nothing to cause it to explode.
Suddenly the phone rang.  As it did, his mother's hand jerked and brushed a=
cross his primed readiness.
"Goddddddnnnnoooooo," he gasped out around his mother's nipple as he felt =
his penis erupt inside his shorts.
"Oh, Baby, I'm sorry," his mother whispered as she watched him strain and =
jerk as he ejaculated , "I'm sorry."
Wayne couldn't believe that it had happened.  He couldn't stop it.  To his =
utter shock and humiliation, he felt his mother slowly ease out from under =
him and get up.
"I'm sorry, baby but I've got to answer the phone, It's probably Tony," sh=
e said softly, pulling her robe closed and walking over to the telephone.
Wayne buried his head down under the pillows, wishing he could crawl in a h=
ole somewhere and die.  How could he have cum right in front of his mother.=
  He was so disgraced, he would never be able to face her again.  Trying to=
 bury his mortification under the cushions on the couch, he listened to his=
 mother talking on the phone as he felt tears of shame running down his fac=
e.
He couldn't make out what she was saying over the din of rain that was pour=
ing down on the house.   Then, all at once, he felt exhausted and unable to=
 keep his eyes open.  He didn't try to fight it and within moments, he was =
asleep.
The room was dark when he awoke.  Looking around, he saw that the fire had =
been built back up and was casting a soft, warm glow over the room.  He did=
n't move for several moments as he let his eyes grow accustomed to the dark=
=2E  After a few moments, he let his eyes slowly search the room.  Then he =
saw his mother sitting in the big, stuffed chair by the fire.  He couldn't =
believe his eyes as he watched her gently massaging her big, pendant breast=
s while she sipped on a glass of wine.  Even though he had cum only a short=
 time before, he felt his manhood spring back to life almost immediately. =

She seemed to be unaware of him as she had her robe untied and spread apart=
 so that her great, swollen breasts were uncovered.   His eyes drank in the=
ir unmatched beauty as he watched her fingers toy and pull at the big, dist=
ended nipples.  Watching her play with her breasts, it seemed like it took =
only seconds for him to become as hard as a rock.  =

Then stunned, he watched as her hand slowly slipped down from her breasts a=
nd traveled down between her legs.  The way she was sitting prevented him f=
rom seeing what she was doing, but when her head tilted back and her eyes c=
losed, he could imagine where her hand was.  He was already on the verge of=
 a second explosion as he watched his mother playing with herself.  Her mov=
ement was becoming more and more animated as he watched.  Her legs crept fa=
rther and farther apart and she began to make the same little mewing sounds=
 as before.  Her breathing was becoming ragged and uneven as her hand moved=
 faster and faster.
Then just as it had been with him, the telephone rang.
Wayne closed his eyes and feinted sleep as he heard his mother get up and w=
alk across the room.  He could hear her talking quietly to someone, but the=
 thrum of the rain made it impossible to distinguish what she was saying.  =
After several moment, he heard her set the phone down.  He waited for a few=
 moments as she slowly padded by the couch and sat back down in the chair. =
 Opening his eyes, he saw that she had spread open her robe again and was m=
assaging her breasts.
Slowly, he sat up.
"Do your breasts hurt?" he brazenly asked her not knowing where he had got=
ten the courage.
"Whut, what, uh, what did you say?" she sputtered, turning toward him.
He didn't speak for several moments as he let his eyes wander over her big,=
 bare breasts.  She seemed confused and initially didn't make a move to cov=
er her exposed breasts.
"I asked you if your breasts were hurting again?" he blushed as she looked=
 down at her bare breasts.
"Oh, I'm sorry," she mumbled, slowly closing her robe and covering her bre=
asts, "I didn't mean to embarrass you."
"I'm sorry, I just feel sort of funny inside when I see your breasts uncov=
ered," he smiled weakly.
"They do hurt a little," she smiled back at him, "but not like before."
"Your breasts are very pretty," he said lamely, not knowing what else to d=
o or say.
"Do you really think so? she said, this time blushing herself, "I thought =
they were a little too droopy."
"Oh, No, Mother, they're beautiful," he blurted out, his obvious excitemen=
t showing. =

"Well, Thank you, I guess," she laughed softly, taking another sip of her =
wine.
"Uh, would, uh, would you like for me, uh, me to, uh, to, uh, nurse you ag=
ain," he mumbled, ashamed that he had said it.
"What did you say?" she asked him with a puzzled look on her face.
"Oh, Nothing," he said, blushing again afraid to press his luck.
Did she know that he had cum before, he wondered as he sat smiling back at =
her inanely.  He wanted to say something, but he didn't know what to say.
"Why don't you get something to eat?" she told him, "I fixed some snack st=
uff while you were asleep."
"Hey, that's sounds good," he said, getting up and going over to the table=
=2E
"You were sleeping so soundly," she said loudly, trying to make herself he=
ard over the sound of the rain, "I didn't want to wake you after what happe=
ned."
Wayne didn't know what to do or say in response so he hungrily devoured ha=
lf of the food on the table.  He had been ravenous, but hadn't realized it =
because his sexual emotions had been overriding all other feelings.
Pouring him another glass of wine, he walked back and sat down on the couch=
=2E  As he did, his mother told him that they were stuck in the cabin until=
 at least tomorrow afternoon.  Tony had talked to the sheriff and found out=
 that the local national guard had a emergency bridge laying unit and that =
they could come out as soon as it stopped raining. =

Wayne didn't have to ask her when that would be as the rain continued to fa=
ll outside with a vengeance.  Looking down at his watch, he was shocked to =
see that it was already nine o'clock.
"Wow, it's getting late," he remarked, refilling his glass.
"Yeah, you slept for quite a while," she smiled back at him, slowly sippin=
g on her drink, "You've had a very long day.
Neither of them spoke for several moments.  Wayne got up and stepped over t=
o the door of the cabin.  Opening it, he watched the rain cascading down in=
 sheets.
"Boy, it's still coming down in buckets," he hollered back to his mother.
"I can hear it," she shouted back at him.
Closing the door, he walked over to the fire and warmed his hands.  He want=
ed to ask his mother if he could nurse her again, but he was too bashful so=
 he just stood there in front of the fire waiting for her to do or say some=
thing.
"Honey, I think I'm going to bed," he heard his mother say after a few mom=
ents, "It's been a long day for me too."
"It sure has," he answered, not knowing what else to say. "I think I will =
too."
Disappointed that his mother hadn't asked him to nurse again, he trudged in=
to his bedroom and pulled his clothes off.  The house was warm so he could =
sleep in the nude as he usually did.  Crawling under his covers, he gently =
stroked his swollen manhood as he listened to his mother getting ready for =
bed in the next room. =

Then suddenly, she stuck her head around the corner.  Startled, he knew tha=
t she had seen him stroking himself.
"Uh, Good Night, Baby," she told him, "I, uh, I  hope, that you sleep well=
=2E"
Then before he had a chance to respond, she disappeared back around the cor=
ner.
"Uh, Night, Mom," he shouted out.
He got no response, but after a few minutes, her light went off leaving the=
 house dark except for the faint glow from the fire in the living room.  Ly=
ing in his bed, thinking back over the events of the day, he slowly drifted=
 off to sleep.
Suddenly, he found himself awake.  Something had woken him up, but he didn'=
t know what.  The fire was almost out and the house was dark, but he didn't=
 hear anything out of the ordinary as he listened.  Then he heard the sound=
 of another log being placed on the fire.  As he watched,  the glow from th=
e fire slowly grew brighter.  Then he heard his mother put another log on t=
he fire.  He couldn't see the fire from his bed, but he could still see the=
 faint glow of it.  Staring out his door into the living room, he was surpr=
ised to see his mother suddenly appear at the door.  He knew that it was to=
o dark for her to see his eyes so he didn't have to pretend he was asleep. =

His mother stood in his doorway for the longest time.  He wondered what she=
 was doing as she stood peering into his room.  Although the glow of the fi=
re was weak, Wayne's eyes had grown accustomed to the dark and he could see=
 that his mother was wearing a very, very thin nightgown.  Even in the dim =
light of the fire, he could easily make out the silhouette of her beautiful=
 body as she stood looking into his room.  Lying on his back he suddenly fe=
lt his cock surge back to hardness as he stared at the outline of her body.=

Wondering what she was doing, he couldn't believe his eyes when she slowly =
moved and stepped into his room.  He couldn't believe that she was actually=
 coming toward his bed.  =

Suddenly the captivating aroma of her bewitching perfume enveloped him as h=
e felt her sit down on the edge of his bed.  His heart almost stopped beati=
ng as he waited to see what she would do next.  Then he felt her slowly lif=
t the covers and ease down under them.  She was now lying in his bed next t=
om him.  He thought he was going to have a heart attack as he suddenly felt=
 her warm body press up against him.
"Wayne, are you  awake?," he heard her whisper.
"Uh, yes," he muttered, his mouth so dry, he could barely speak.
"Do you mind if I come in here for a while?" she asked him, pressing herse=
lf up against him insistently.
"Uh, No," he groaned, feeling her big, firm breasts pressing into his arm.=

She didn't say anything for several minutes.
"Baby, my breasts are hurting again.  Would you  nurse me?" she finally wh=
ispered. =

"Oh, Yes," he gasped as he felt her push the covers down and spread her go=
wn open.
"Thank You" she sighed.
Rolling over toward her, he pushed his face down onto her swollen breast.  =
Like a piglet searching for nourishment, he hunted for her nipple.  Almost =
immediately he found the hard, swollen pap jutting up from her swollen brea=
st and locked his lips around it.  Hungrily, he began to suck on it.  Just =
as before, only a small trickle of milk oozed from his mother's nipple init=
ially.  Sucking harder, he felt the flow increase and he was quickly reward=
ed with a mouthful of her sweet, frothy milk.  Gluttonously, he pulled and =
sucked on her gushing tit reveling in the delightful taste and warmth of he=
r sweet, creamy milk.  As he sucked and pulled on her breast, he realized t=
hat his throbbing cock was pressed up against his mother's hot, firm leg.  =
Her gown must have ridden up her leg because  there was nothing between his=
 cock and her bare skin.  Aflame with desire, he couldn't stop himself from=
 pressing his burning hardness against her leg even harder.   He knew that =
she must feel his steel hard penis mashed up against her leg, but   she mad=
e no effort to move her leg back away from him.  Inspired by her lack of ob=
jection, he continued to press his swollen hardness into her leg as he suck=
ed and fondled her swollen tit.
"Oh, yes, baby, it feels so good," he heard his mother whisper to him.
In his feverish state, he didn't know if she meant his cock or the way he w=
as sucking her tit.  Everything was happening too fast for him to fully com=
prehend it.  He was overwhelmed by the emotions pouring through his mind.  =
It was too incredulous to fully fathom.  He was lying next to his dear, swe=
et mother, sucking her breast and rubbing his cock against her leg.  It cou=
ldn't really be happening.  He must be dreaming, but he knew he wasn't.
Slowly the flow of milk from her breast diminished as he ravenously suckle=
d her like a starving man.  As he sucked, he was able to pull less and less=
 of her pure, precious milk into his mouth until at last the flow stopped a=
ltogether.  =

"Do the other one, baby," she cooed, her hands coaxing him over to her oth=
er breast.
To reach her other breast, Wayne had to straddle her and lean over her.  Cl=
umsily, he raised himself up on his hands and rolled his leg over hers.  He=
 was now lying with his mother's leg between his legs and his rock hard coc=
k pressing down against her hard, firm thigh.  Then he leaned down and quic=
kly sucked her other swollen pap into his mouth.
"Oh, Yes, Baby," his mother groaned as he began to suck on her other breas=
t.  "You make me feel so good."
Unable to control himself, he began to thrust his aching hardness against h=
er leg as his mouth pulled on her big, hard nipple.  He knew that she could=
n't help feeling his naked cock rubbing against her as he ground it down on=
to her leg.  Just the feel of her hot, smooth skin on his prick was sending=
 him rushing headlong toward another eruption.  Knowing that there would be=
 no way to disguise his ejaculation this time, he still couldn't stop humpi=
ng his cock against her leg.
Just as before, the flow of milk was very slow at the start, but all at onc=
e it began to pour into his mouth.  Within moments his mouth was filling wi=
th her the delicate, womanly flavor of her hot, sweet milk.  =

His head was swimming with pleasure and lust as he sucked and pulled on her=
 nipple.  Wrapping his hand around her big, pliable breast, he squeezed and=
 clutched her big, soft breast, trying to coax even more of her wonderful c=
ream from her breast.
"Oh, Baby," his mother murmured as he ravaged her breast with his sucking,=
 pulling mouth.  =

Gulping loudly, he sucked hungrily at his mom's breast.  He couldn't get en=
ough of her frothy, sweet milk.  Holding on tightly with both hands to the =
soft abundance of her breast, he urged her to give him more and more.  He h=
ad never experienced such power and desire before as he lay atop his mother=
, nursing.  =

As she lovingly ran her hands through his hair, she held his face mashed do=
wn against her breast.   Then woefully, he felt the muscles in his mother's=
 leg harden as she tried to move her leg out from underneath his thrusting =
penis.   Disheartened, he slowly lifted his leg and let her leg slip out fr=
om under him.  Then, in a flash of comprehension, he realized that he was n=
ow lying between her long, shapely legs.
"Oh, Wayne," she moaned softly.  =

Encouraged by this new development, he renewed his attack on her breast unt=
il, much sooner than he wished, the flow of thick, frothy milk slowly dimin=
ished to a trickle and then stopped.
Unwillingly to forfeit his vantage, Wayne continued to tease and taunt her =
bloated nipple.  As he did, he turned slightly and pressed his hard malenes=
s against the warmness of her soft, smooth inner thigh.  =

As he lay atop her now, his stomach was pressing down on the soft, fuzzy ma=
t of hair covering her soft underbelly.  He was so keyed up, he felt like h=
e could feel every one of her curly, pubic hairs individually tickling his =
stomach.  Then, like a bolt of lightning, it came to him.  There was nothin=
g between him and his mother.  It was his own bare skin against her bare sk=
in.  He couldn't believe it, but she must have opened her gown all the way =
when she had laid down next to him.  It was to good to be true, he thought =
as a perverse thrill ran through his body.  Infected by the perverted lust =
that was rigidly obvious, he mashed his belly down on her and felt another =
jolt of excitement tear into his overloaded brain.  He could feel his mothe=
r's wetness pressing up against him as she gently thrust herself up against=
 his stomach
Oh, baby..." she moaned softly.
 Drowning in emotions that he had never felt before, he ever so slowly let =
his mother's nipple slip out of his mouth.  But he kept his mouth pressed a=
gainst the hot, smooth skin of her breast.  Slowly, he began kissing his wa=
y up her breast on onto her neck.
"Oh, Baby,"she gushed, arching her neck against his insistent lips.
Lifting his body, he determinedly kissed his way up her neck.  Stopping for=
 a moment, he gently nibbled at the soft, fragrant skin just below her chin=
=2E  Then his lips traveled up over her chin and quickly down onto her lips=
=2E  =

"Oh, Christ," she groaned, pulling his face down and mashing her lips agai=
nst his.
With their lips pasted together, their bodies pressed together erotically.
In his squirming passion, Wayne suddenly found himself with the head of his=
 great, bloated penis resting against the soft, fleshy opening of his mothe=
r's wetness.   Only a rapidly decaying fear of his mother's reaction separa=
ted him from the dark wicked mysteries of her most sacred of  sacred places=
=2E  Then, as he felt the heat exuding from her weeping lovewound, he felt =
her gently tilt her hips and gently press herself against him.  =

Holding himself back one moment longer, he continued to grind his mouth aga=
inst hers and slowly slid his tongue into her mouth.
Suddenly, he felt his mother's hands on his tight, clenched ass.  As she gr=
abbed hold of his ass, he felt her dig her long, pink fingernails into him.=
  =

Unable to postpone the inevitable any longer, he slowly pushed the head of =
his cock into the burning, cleaving opening of his mother's drooling vagina=
=2E
"Arrggghhhhhhhhh," he heard his mother gasp as their lips broke apart.
Gasping for breath, Wayne felt beads of perspiration pop out on his forehea=
d.  He was feverish and confused.  Should he stop?  This was so wrong.  The=
y were about to commit a mortal sin. A sin so evil and heinous, he would fo=
rever be branded as a Motherfucker.  But, even as his mind reeled in chaos,=
 he knew that there was no way to stop now.  They had gone too far.  There =
was nothing anyone could do to stop their inescapable plunge into the wicke=
d depths of incestual love.  =

Finding her lips again, he hungrily kissed her, deep and long.  As they ki=
ssed, he slowly eased his cock down into her flaming core.  This couldn't r=
eally be happening, he feverishly thought as his cock slowly slipped deeper=
 into the scalding depths of her tight, clutching womanhood.  He was fuckin=
g his dear, wonderful Mother.  He would surely go to hell for what he was d=
oing, but it would be worth it.  He was fucking his mother.  =

The feeling was indescribable.  It was like thrusting his cock into a tight=
, burning sheath of silky softness that lovingly clenched and squeezed him.=
  Unbelievably, it was hotter and wetter as he went deeper and deeper insid=
e the secret, intimacy of her very soul.  There was nothing else to live fo=
r, now.  He was submitting himself to the most wonderful experience a boy w=
as capable of imagining.  While the physical pleasure was incomparable, the=
 fact that his mother was his willing partner in the wickedness was most im=
portant to him.  While he wanted to make love to her for so very long, he c=
ould never have done it without her concurrence.  Now she was more than his=
 mother, she was his soul-mate.
"Oh, My Fucking, God, Mother," he gasped, finally breaking their lip lock.=

"Oh, Wayne, My Baby, " she cried out, thrusting herself up against him.
Wayne's cock slid effortlessly into his mother's warmth. His origin. His so=
urce.  The fiery oven of his birthplace.  It felt like heaven.  Even though=
, he was reveling in the wicked delight of making love to his mother, he wa=
s slightly surprised.  It should have felt a little dirty and perverted.  H=
e should have had some guilt, but he couldn't believe how natural and wonde=
rful it felt.  Making love to the beautiful woman was incomparable to anyth=
ing, he would never be able to make love to another woman.  =

Overcome by the delicious feelings pouring from his cock, he tentatively  p=
ulled his great, throbbing cock out slightly and then pushed it back down i=
nto her fiery sheath once again. The sensation of her wet, hot flesh wrappe=
d around his aching cock sent fire coursing up his cock and into his reelin=
g mind.  The exquisite pleasure spewing from his loins was rapidly becoming=
 too intense to tolerate.  =

He realized that his mother must feel the same way as she arched her hips p=
ulling him even deeper inside her scorching cunt.  As he entered her, he co=
uld feel her bare breasts pressing up against chest.  His chest was wet fro=
m the milk that still leaked from them.  =

Thrusting himself into her, he finally felt the head of his cock thud up ag=
ainst her cervix at the same instant his belly touched hers.  They were mad=
e for each other and fit together perfectly.  =

Holding himself deep inside of her hot, sucking cunt, he bent down and quic=
kly kissed her again.  His mother returned his kiss, and soon his tongue sn=
aked its way into her mouth. Mother and son embraced and kissed deeply with=
 their hips flattened against each other.  =

The passion that was pouring through his body rapidly blossomed into a whit=
e-hot spasm of ecstasy as the tension in his loins reached the boiling poin=
t.  =

"Momph!" he tried to warn her but it was too late. His cock erupted violen=
tly inside her, sending a huge gusher of his white-hot lavacum spurting out=
 into his mother's vagina. =

"Oh, Wayne..." His mother gurgled, wrapping her legs around him, and pushi=
ng her hips up against him.
"Wayne, MY, Baby ..." she cried, her voice softening into a whimper as his=
 body continued to spasm and writhe.
Over and over again, he felt his cock jerk and spurt gusher after gusher of=
 his thick, hot cum deep into his mother's hungry, sucking cunt.  It was pu=
re heaven as wave after wave of pleasure washed over his body.
"Oh, My, God, Mother, I Love You," he gasped as he thrust himself down int=
o her again and again.
Finally, his mighty monster relented and stopped firing off inside of her. =
 Exhausted by the huge expenditure of physical and emotional energy, Wayne =
collapsed down on top of her.  =

Neither of them spoke as they lay pressed against each other for several mo=
ments.  Then, as if reading each other's minds they began kissing and lovin=
gly fondling and caressing each other. =

As they petted,  Wayne was surprised to find that his cock, still buried in=
side his mother hadn't softened at all.  After a few moments, he slowly beg=
an to slide his cock in and out of his mother's deep, wet cunt.  Within mom=
ents, they were gently fucking as his mother eagerly returned his thrusts. =
 Soon, their bodies were moving in a heated rhythm.
"Oh, Wayne, I love it," she moaned as he fucked her. =

Mom ... Mom ... Mom." he heard himself moaning involuntarily as their hips=
 clashed together over and over.  Their pent up passion overcame them and s=
uddenly they were going at each other like two clawing, biting animals.  Th=
ey were unable to get enough of the other as they fought for release from t=
he burning, festering desire.  =

"Fuck Mommy, Fuck Mommy," he heard his mother grunt every time he slammed =
his hard cock into her.
Their hips slammed together loudly as they fucked, sending splatters of the=
ir lovemaking flying all over the bed.  The loud slurping of her cunt as it=
 sucked on his dick could even be heard above the roar of the rain crashing=
 down on the roof, but still they fucked.
At last, after twenty or thirty minutes of fierce, ball busting fucking, Wa=
yne felt his scrotum begin to tighten.  He could feel himself nearing the p=
oint of eruption as his mother writhed and groveled below him, urging him t=
o fuck her harder and harder.
"Oh, Fuck, Baby, I feel it CUMMMMNNNNNN!", she finally screamed as her bod=
y tensed and her muscles became as hard as boards.
Wayne felt her cunt lock down around his cock, squeezing it so hard he coul=
dn't stop it from exploding.
"FUCKMOTHERCUMMNNNN," he bellowed out at the same time a brilliant flash o=
f lightning filled the room.
Terrified by the blinding bolt of lightning, he felt like the head of his c=
ock had been blown off inside his mother.  =

Then the whole house shook as thunder followed the lightning.
He couldn't stop cumming inside his mother.  Over and over again, his cock =
gathered itself and spewed out load after load of his thick, creamy cum int=
o her clinging cunt.  He quickly filled her to overflowing.  He could feel =
his cum oozing out around his spasming cock and running down the crack of h=
is mother's upturned ass.
Time seemed to stop as they groaned and fucked.  At last, there was no more=
 and they collapsed in each other's arms.  Consumed by their sinful escapad=
e, they immediately fell asleep.
