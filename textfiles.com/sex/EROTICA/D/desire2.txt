                         *****THE DESIRE TO KNOW*****
                              *****CHAPTER 2*****

        About a week had passed since Paula had gone to the psychiatrist,
    and Paula was out on a dinner date with a man she had met recently at
    lunch. Okay, I know that sounds weird. She met him while she was eating
    lunch at a local deli, they had both sat down at the same table at
    pretty much the same time, and instead of one of them getting up, they
    stayed and ate lunch together. It was after they chatted all through
    their lunch hour that he had invited her to dinner and she accepted.

        His name was Frank, and he too was an attorney. 37 years old and
    twice divorced, he was a very distinguished looking man. About 6'2" and
    195 lbs. With close cropped brown hair, and a matching mustauche that
    had just a hint of grey imbedded in it.

        I don't know how it happened, but during their meeting at lunch, he
    had gotten started talking about his two ex-wives, and he had made the
    comment that if they had been a little less demanding, he may still be
    married to one of them. Paula had let it pass over her head, but he was
    saying that he wanted a submissive woman.

        They had been sitting at the dinner table for about 45 minutes and
    Paula found that was was quickly losing herself in his deep set eyes.
    To her, it seemed like he was not looking at her, but looking IN her.
    It unnerved her, as more than once she found herself having to avert
    her eyes from his penetrating gaze.

        While he was talking, Paula found herself thinking back to certain
    little things that had happened when he picked her up for dinner.
    First, when she opened the door and told him that she was just about
    ready, he looked at her and made a comment about her wearing too much
    makeup. Once they had gotten into his car, Paula had crossed her long
    legs and quickly found that his hand had reached out to bring her
    crossed leg down to the other one.

        She would have said something to him about that, but he had been
    talking the whole time, and not stopped when he pulled her leg down.
    Paula didn't know what the problem was with her crossing her legs, but
    he had repeated that same act again when Paula had crossed her legs a
    few minutes later.

        A third thing that had happened was that he had not even consulted
    her about what she wanted to eat. Frank had just picked up his menu and
    ordered for both of them. Paula didn't mind that so much seeing as he
    DID select something that she liked.

        She was replaying the scene in his car again when he invaded her
    thoughts. "Paula.. Are you listening to me?" He asked sharply, Looking
    straight into her eyes. The woman shook her head as if trying to
    dispell the images in her head. "I'm sorry, what were you saying?"

        "I was SAYING" He said, voice rising with the last word. "That
    there is a conversation going on at this table and you should pay
    attention when someone is speaking to you."


        Paula was a little taken back by the curtness of his words. She
    looked at him as if she were about to tell him where to get off, but
    then looked away quickly and said "I'm sorry. I guess my mind was
    wandering."
    "Look at me when i'm talking to you, Paula!" Frank said, getting the
    attention of the couple that was sitting at the next table. She snapped
    her eyes back in his direction, and saw that he looked quite upset.
    Paula found herself thinking to herself that she would be glad when
    this evening was over, this guy was an asshole.

        But the strangest thing happened when he brought her home and
    walked her to her door. He has kissed her lightly on the cheek and
    asked if she would like to go to the opera the following night. That in
    itself wasn't strange, but the fact that Paula found herself accepting
    that invitation WAS a bit strange, seeing as she had already decided
    not to see him again.

        Frank did not seem to want to be invited in, as he had told her
    that he would pick her up at 7:00 and then turned to walk toward his
    car. Paula watched him drive away then went inside her house mentally
    kicking herself for not telling him to fuck off.

        Frank and Paula went out several times in the next two or three
    weeks. The goodnight scene was always the same, with Frank kissing
    Paula on the cheek and invited her out again. Paula always accepting
    and then wondering why she continued to see the guy.

        He picked her up for dinner one night and looked at her very
    strangely for a few moments, then announced matter of factly that they
    weren't going anywhere until she took off some of that "gunk" that she
    had on her face. Paula's jaw dropped when she heard that, telling him
    that she had not spent 45 minutes applying makeup just to take it right
    back off again.

        I suppose one might think they were having an argument, PAULA was
    certainly ready to fight. But Frank very calmly stuck to his original
    statement until Paula decided the hell with it and went back upstairs
    and washed it all off, thinking she would call his bluff.

        She went back downstairs, face bare of all makeup and half expected
    him to say that perhaps it was okay with him if she DID wear it. (Paula
    did not think she looked good without it) But Frank only nodded his
    approval when he saw her, telling her that he did not want her to wear
    makeup anymore.

        She had finally had enough of it, and was just in the process of
    telling him to get out of her house when he opened the door and took
    her by the elbow, ushering her to the car, saying that their
    reservations were for 8 and they were already late. Paula just did a
    slow burn and crossed her legs, yes, only to feel his fingers pull them
    level again with authority.

        Alright, you wonder why Paula still goes out with him even though
    he seems to be a boorish oaf? I'm glad you asked that question. You
    see, there was something about Frank that totally captivated the pretty
    attorney. Only she hadn't the slightest idea of what it was.


        A few nights later, at their usual restaurant, they were in the
    middle of a conversation about the Persian Gulf situation when out of
    the blue, Frank told Paula to go into the ladies room, remove her
    panties and bring them out and hand them to him.

        Paula had been in the middle of making a point when he blurted out
    that request/command, and had stopped talking abuptly and stared at him
    mutely, as if she hadn't heard what he said. "I said" Frank started "Go
    into the ladies room, remove your panties and bring them out to me." He
    repeated what he had just said moments before.

        Paula was quite ready to get up and leave him sitting there without
    a date. Her mouth opened as if she were about to speak, but then she
    closed it again, and with one more look at him, saw something in his
    eyes she had not seen before. The look was not to be ignored or taken
    lightly, so Paula stood and walked toward the ladies room, feeling
    butterflies in her stomach for some reason she could not understand.

        A few minutes later, She returned from the restroom carrying her
    white panties bunched up in her hand. She sat down at the table and was
    promptly greeted with Frank's extended hand, awaiting the panties.
    Paula quickly handed them to him, hoping against hope that no one would
    see what she was handing him. To her great dismay, Frank took his sweet
    time about folding them neatly and putting inside his jacket.

        When her panties had been tucked away safely, Frank began their
    conversation again, just as if it had not been halted a few minutes
    before. Paula sat there stunned, and embarrassed, and in fact was not a
    very talkative lady for the rest of that evening.

        It was to turn out to be an evening of several firsts for the
    pretty attorney. When they left, instead of bringing her to her
    doorstep, Paula found herself being escorted to HIS doorstep. It was
    quite cool outside and the blowing air felt strange on her pantiless
    bottom.

        Frank opened the door of his house and they both walked into the
    darkened room. He turned on the light and took Paula's coat, hanging it
    up while she looked around. The living room was very neatly furnished,
    not at all what one would expect from a 37 year old man who lived
    alone.

        He returned after making a drink for himself, not even bothering to
    offer one to Paula. He bade her to sit on the sofa and he would be
    right with her. Paula mechanically moved to his sofa, sitting down and
    began to cross her legs, but automatically pulled them down as she knew
    what would happen if he found them crossed.

        Frank sat down next to her and set his drink on a lamp table next
    tot the sofa, and then pulled her panties out of his pocket. Paula
    blushed when she saw them, remembering how he had gotten them. He was
    holding them out and speaking to her.
    "When I tell you to do something, I expect it to be done immediately.
    Do you understand that, Young lady?" He asked her condescendingly.


        Paula tentitively took her panties from him, and blushed deeply
    before biting her lower lip and nodding yes to his question.
    "Fine." He said. then continued while Paula sat there in a very subdued
    state of mind. "Just to make sure that I was understood, I'm going to
    give you a sound spanking to get my point across." He said, and began
    taking off his jacket.

        When she heard the word, `spanking', Something inside of Paula
    began to spin in circles and made her feel as if she were on a
    merry-go-round traveling at 100 miles per hour. It seemed to her that
    it was happening in slow motion. Frank took her gently by the arm, and
    pulled her toward him, laying her over his legs.

        She KNEW she ought to struggle. To push away from him and bolt from
    his house, then run all the way home. But the woman didn't have the
    strength to fight against him. She heard a voice, her own, sounding very
    far away and very alien. it was pleading with him, telling him that she
    promised to be a good girl if he didn't spank her.

        Frank had to catch his breath when he lifted her skirt up and
    feasted his eyes upon her voluptous asscheeks. Paula was laying
    underneath him, moaning and grinding her pelvis into him, saying
    something he could not comprehend. Her eyes had been closed since the
    moment he announced that she would be getting a spanking, but her
    mind's eye could see all sorts of throwbacks to her dreams.

        So realistic were these pictures in her mind, that Paula could only
    believe that it WAS a dream. Frank had draped his left hand over her
    waist and was preparing to bring his right hand down. He expected her
    to fight, or at least protest. But the pretty woman was doing nothing
    except rotating her ass as if in search of something.

        Paula's dream became a harsh reality when she heard a pop, then felt
    the unmistakable stinging sensation centered somewhere behind her.
    Before it could register in her brain, another pop and stinging feeling
    jolted her. Frank was taking his time, making damn sure that his heavy
    hand fell where he wanted it to.

        Frank had slapped her bottom nearly 20 times before the thought
    occured to Paula that she was actually getting a spanking. No, this was
    not a dream as she realised that her ass never got stingy and hot
    during her dreams. She still didn't cry out or struggle, though.

        For some reason, the idea that Paula wasn't making any noise made
    Frank believe that he was not spanking her well enough. He remedied
    this by holding his palm cupped and bringing it down a little harder.
    Now Paula gave him the first indication that she was feeling it. But
    she still didn't cry out, but merely thrust her hips downward, not
    aware in the least of his growing hardon.

        By the time Frank had finished spanking her, Paula's ass was almost
    uniformly reddened from his strong slaps. He stood her up in front of
    him, and saw that although her hands immediately flew back to rub her
    scorched bottom, her eyes had a very distant look about them. As if she
    weren't really there.



        Paula WASN'T that far gone. She was standing in front of him,
    relishing the stinging on her asscheeks. Trying to really get into
    contact with her feelings. But something was bringing her back into
    Frank's living room.. It was his voice.
    "Paula! Look at me when i'm talking to you!" He snapped at her,
    bringing her out of her dreamlike state and into what she saw as a
    surreal happening. She looked at him, and it almost frightened him to
    see the look of pure adoration in her eyes.

        Her ass was smarting, but she felt nothing but warm feelings. The
    warmth centered from her freshly spanked ass and radiated outward,
    making her feel warm all over, in and out.
    "Do you know why I spanked you, Paula? " He was asking. She nodded
    silently and continued to relish the feelings.
    "Then tell me why." He said. Frank wanted to be perfectly sure that she
    understood what was happening.
    "Because I wasn't fast enough in doing what you asked me to do." She
    replied, with a hint of a crack in her voice. There were no tears
    in her eyes, but they did look misty.
    "You'll also be able to tell me what will happen should you not do
    as I ask, won't you" Frank asked, searching her face for some sign
    of emotion.
    "I suppose i'll get another spanking" She whispered, lowering both
    her eyes, and her skirt, keeping her hands clasped behind her
    back as if they were cuffed that way.

        It's strange, but except for light kisses on the cheek; this
    spanking was the first real contact they had together. Frank patted the
    sofa next to him and had Paula rest her hot butt on it. She sat down
    and let her head be pulled to his shoulder when his arm went around
    her. He was stroking her hair and whispering in her ear that he thought
    she looked very sexy.. She murmured a thank you and just let herself
    sink deeper into her mind.

        Now Frank took her chin in his hand, tilted her face up toward him.
    She gazed at him and let her lips part slightly. He brought his face
    down and kissed her gently at first, then rising in intensity when
    Paula responded by darting her own tougue into his mouth. Now it was
    becoming clear to him, the effect the spanking had had on her.

        To put it simply, Paula was on fire. Frank's hand slipped down her
    shoulders to her back. Paula took this as a hint to move closer, and
    soon was on his lap, her breasts crushing against his chest while she
    leaned over and kept her mouth busy on his.

        Sex, was never something Paula had put a lot of energy into. Or to
    be more accurate, it was never something she really thought of as
    something to make her lose control of her senses. But here she was,
    Straddling this guy's lap and going after him like a woman possessed.

        Both were breathing heavy and in fact already passed the point of
    no return. Frank let his hands glide down the silk material of her
    blouse and was soon cupping her ass through her skirt. Paula reacted to
    that by moaning into his mouth and smashing her pelvis into his. She
    felt his erection and decided instantly that she simply MUST have it.


        Now the hunted becomes the hunter. Paula kept him pretty much
    pinned down to the sofa while she did things she had only dreamed of in
    the past. She rolled her hips over his still covered cock while her
    tongue danced within his mouth. Frank somehow got his hands between
    them and was in the process of unbuttoning her blouse. Once undone, He
    fondled her tits through her bra while the blonde woman chewed on his
    bottom lip.

        Frank then found the control he had momentarily lost. He put his
    hands on her shoulders and pushed her back a little, so the kiss was
    broken. Paula's mouth was open and he still felt her hot breath on his
    face. Now he reached to her shoulders and slid the blouse from her. She
    helped by shrugging it off, then got back into the act herself by
    undoing his tie and shirt.

        Moments later, Paula was on her knees in front of him, undoing his
    pants and taking his cock out through the fly of his shorts. She didn't
    give it time to get cold as she engulfed half of it in her mouth with
    one motion of her head.

        Harry Reems would have been envious of Frank at that moment, Paula
    sucked his cock with all the passion that the porn stars lacked. As a
    matter of fact, she was fast bringing him to orgasm. Too fast for
    Frank, He tried to push her head away from his groin but Paula shook
    her head in such a way that he could only sit back and shoot his load
    into her mouth.

        Paula felt the first blast hit the back of her throat and then
    suddenly went down farther, feeling the knob of his dickhead bump into
    her throat causing her to gag a little.

        For a full 30 seconds, Frank felt his spasming cock being drained
    by her eager mouth. Paula kept it in her mouth long after his orgasm
    subsided and he became flaccid. He smiled to himself while Paula loved
    his now soft cock.

        After a few moments, Frank realised that he still had one hot
    lady on his hands. Somehow he found his voice.
    "That was very nice, Paula." He said, his hand stroking her cheek while
    she gazed up at him.
