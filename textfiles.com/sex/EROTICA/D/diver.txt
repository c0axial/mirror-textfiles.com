                              ---------------------

I went for a warm-water diving holiday - blue skies - clear water - my
club-mates all had other plans, or they had used up their holiday leave - and
so they got left behind

You never know who you'll end up diving with - it's a mixture, good and bad -
but it's warm - We need our cold-water wetsuit tops on, over our swim gear, but
it's warm enough to leave off the neoprene pants that are a must back home -
When I get there we have an odd number in the party - we start by diving with a
three - then the next new arrival is buddied with me - she isn't bad-looking -
on the thin side - but she starts off like a real pain - chip-on-shoulder
feminist -

We start a boat dive - get our kit together - I go to check her over before we
dive - she says 'don't treat me like a beginner - I don't need this macho diver
stuff - I'm an underwater archaeologist' - well I come from a club where we
look after each other - we take safety seriously - I hope I'll get the same
from you - she shrugs

we start the dive from the boat after a longish trip out round the coast - a
shallow-water boat dive should be safe and easy - no more than ten metres -
lots of light, warmth and colours - oh we can't make up our minds to agree
which way to go - signal troubles and squabble - she swims well but wants to
lead off anywhere and everywhere - I follow - hardly any time to look at the
wildlife -

rocks and weed and crud - something wrong - we're both tangled up in something
- I signal her to wait while I try and get rid of whatever it is - I get out my
knife and start cutting - she's really nervous - fidgets and flaps - getting
more tangled up - is it net or is it line - can't see as it's practically
invisible in the water - just a bit of weed caught in it - I give her stronger
signals to stop fart-arsing about - point my index-finger - show flat of hand -
ring with thumb and first finger -  meaning -  you - stop right there - ok? -
at last she gives back  - ok - she stops moving around and I set to work - only
a few strands round my fins - wow - she's got in a mess - lots of tangled stuff
- knife isn't the best for nets, but it's all I've got - a very little air into
her jacket - so she'll rise up out of the net as she gets free - bit of air
into mine too - I work to free her head first and then on down - what's this,
more net stuff round her regulator valve - cut it free - stay far enough off
not to get tangled again myself we swap more signals while I work - check
there's no more panic - she gives 'ok' back - right, now her body's free and
out of the net, only her legs to do, there are strands around her knife-sheath
and fins - eventually we get her entirely free - at last - better check though
I'm pretty sure we're all ok -

oh fuck, she may be a pain, but she's got good legs - I get a slight stir about
the cock and wonder what the rest of her is like - well, now the main work is
done, but I run my hands all down her thighs, to make sure there's nothing
entangling them - I do it slowly and thoroughly  -  ok - ok - wow - she seems
calmer now - we ascend gently by a couple of metres, and agree to surface -
thank-you she says, on the surface, near the boat, and gives me a really nice
smile - I'm sorry I panicked - you weren't too bad at all, I reply - do you
want to get out of the water or shall we go down again? - she says, the others
are still down - we've plenty of air - I want to dive with you - I check -
twenty-five minutes, about 120 atmospheres left in each bottle - we agree to
dive again -

it's really different this time - she follows me - we stop and look around -
the fish come up and look at us too - we give ok signals again and hold hands -
she squeezes mine - lovely soft hands - she's trying to tell me something not
in the signals -

then she signals 'wait' - I want to tell her 'don't worry - take your time' - I
take my mouthpiece out and hold it in one hand - I take her hand in my other
and kiss her hand - my cock tells me to do something more - I blow a few
bubbles at her mask and laugh into the water - then quickly replace my mask -
her eyes sparkle - she's got the point - I don't think she wants to try and
take her own mask out - perhaps she guesses we can have fun down here as well -

after a bit we manage a quick kiss underwater - have some fun - we share air -
safety drill of course, and deadly serious - still about a hundred atmospheres
left in both our air-bottles - we're back within sight of the anchor-line - the
water is warm and surely no need to go up yet? -

now a nonstandard signal - we hold hands - I use my finger to draw a circle on
her palm - and press through the middle - shall we?  -  yes ok - wonderful! - I
slide my finger slowly through the ring of her 'ok' -  I - want - you - hard -
but hell - we can't hug, what can we do in this gear - we gently stroke each
other's thighs - we're floating a little way off the line, I hold on by a few
rocks and wavy fronds - I'm getting more excited - harder - she opens her legs
apart - she's astride me - ride a cock sea-horse, lady! - my cock is hard on -
I want to burst - oh fuck, I want to get closer than this, I want to thrust and
ram her now - hell with all this diving gear in the way between my throbbing
tool and her wet flesh - maybe there's a way - I unfasten my wet-suit lower
strap, push the lifejacket strap to one side - she gets the idea and helps do
the same with hers - my cock is tight against my briefs - now I press my tool
against her bikini briefs - by the friction I feel her softness - again - and
again - oh fuck, this is too good - but all the fins, knives, and spare
snorkels on our legs and feet are still in the way - we can't strip off without
tangling up again - I stroke her thighs again - she strokes mine - there's only
one way to do this - 'wait' - 'ok' - I get out my knife again - put it into my
bulging briefs - to one side, where they are narrow against my hip, I start
sawing - with a few strokes I slice through -

my cock bursts out hard and free - she cups and strokes it - oh wonderful, I
can't wait - I give 'same for you' and get 'ok' - now my knife goes in between
her hip and the side of her bikini - I saw and cut through, peel away her
bikini front, put knife away - I stroke her lovely soft hair and - at last -
the soft opening to her pussy cunt - wow! - there's something more slippery on
there than seawater - something to let me slide in easily - I massage and
stroke her - my cock is extra sensitive as it's been in seawater for over half
an hour - with one hand I keep us steady - with my other hand I hold her lovely
arse and stroke and press - my cock slides in - first the head - I go mad -
must be mad - what a place to do it - then full length inside her - fuck this -
my instinct takes over - with my free hand I mould, slide, stroke her around my
cock - slide and screw - fuck, then ram - she gets more excited too - her hands
grasp my lifejacket - she steadies herself astride me - my free hand caresses
her arse - soft to squeeze - locks us together - we pant and press, cram my
tool, shove it right in - deep fucking strokes - she has that way of moving -
writhing - maddens my lust - harder and faster - faster and harder - I buck and
ram and slam and ball and fuck and fuck and screw -

we get more excited - our pubic hair tangles and strokes - oh, there's a
mouthpiece not to forget! otherwise I'd be coming with all this - hold on too -
a gentle tidal surge slowly wafts us, to, then fro - we fuck in a rhythm in
time with the tide - waft left - slide, thrust, buck, ram - waft right - fuck,
screw, fuck and again - harder and stronger - what a fuck! - what a slam! - - a
wet slippery hot mad bucking ramming fuck! - I fuck her cunt hotter and hotter,
her juice runs - she clings to me tight and wet inside - as I bang and fuck in
every ram of my driving ramrod tool - my cock thrusts madder and harder - take
it! - ram! - fuck! - fuck! - then with a massive hot ram - FUCK! - I explode -
shoot - burst - blow - fill - flow - with slower thrusts I fill her soft hot
cunt with all my creamy spunk - jet! - spurt! - blow! - wwow! - I gulp air and
blow - massive gusts of bubbles surround us for a moment before they disappear
upwards to the surface - she's doing the same but smaller gusts -

we hold tight together - cool down - calm down - as I part my tool from its
work well done - she gives a little tremor - a ribbon of spunk comes out too
and curls into the seawater - makes little rings and chains - a liquid link
from me to her and back again - what sign can I make but 'ok?' - it comes back
ok - a squeeze and slide of the hand - ok, ok - we recover, and prepare to
finish the dive - both together we fold back the cut flap of her bikini and
fasten back the wetsuit - same for my briefs and suit, no longer bulging much,
my load released and gone - still 40 atmospheres left and it's time to go up -
we've done it properly -

on the surface I realise, I know her but we have hardly spoken or kissed - she
says, thanks for everything, I got close to panic but you really cut me free -
I say, you were cool enough and hot enough too, I love you, I want you again -
she says, hero - we get to the side of the boat and climb out of the water -

long journey back to the jetty, all the usual clearing up with diving gear - I
say, 'what will we do for swimming things now I've cut them up?' - 'oh, easy,
I'll soon mend them' - 'I didn't think you did that sort of thing' - 'just for
a few people' -

later we have our evening meal together - and back to her room - for a first
proper kiss - I tell her - you've got a lovely soft mouth - she says she really
goes for my thick black beard - we hug - her boobs are big enough, nipples hard
enough to tickle in with my chest hair - and her arse and cunt - soft and
delicious as before - we slowly approach and merge together in a long dreamy
fuck, hazy with memories of wine, water, bubbles, tide, ebb, flow, creamy flow -

next morning we start to prepare our things for the new day's diving - of
course we'll dive together again - you'll need these she says - hands me back
my mended sliced swim- briefs - she's sewn the mend with some tape to reinforce
it - its a bit ragged and that's ok - inside the tape I see she's sewn a word  -
hero.
