                         *****THE DESIRE TO KNOW*****
                              *****CHAPTER 1*****


        Charles had been a good friend of Paula's ever since they had met
    in junior high school. There had been several boys picking on her and
    Charles had stepped in to help her, getting his ass kicked in the
    process. They had became friends after that and remained so ever since.

        But that seemed like it was about to change. You see, Charles' job
    has him traveling around the country on occasion. And when he does, he
    needs someone to stay at his apartment and make sure his animals get
    fed, plants watered.. etc. He usually had his little sister do this but
    on this occasion she was busy.

        He had ended up having to ask Paula, who said she would do it, as
    long as he didn't mind if she had her date for the upcoming Saturday
    come over to keep her company. He said it was alright so it was all
    set. He went on his trip satisfied that his apartment would be in good
    hands.

        It would have been, but on Saturday night after Paula's date and
    she had fucked up a storm and Paula had slipped into a blissful sleep,
    her date decided to get up and smoke a little crack. No need going into
    a long explaination of exactly what happened after that, but when Paula
    awoke the next morning, she found that her date had ransacked the
    place. Of course he was nowhere to be found.

        For the better part of that day, Paula had tried her best to return
    the apartment to it's original shape. She had been successful enough,
    except for a reading lamp that Charles kept on the desk of his study.
    That had fallen on the floor and had broken into several pieces. Paula
    figured she would have to replace it, and just put it all into a bag
    and left it there on his desk.

        Once Charles returned from his trip, Paula discovered to her dismay
    that the broken lamp was worth as much if not more than most people's
    cars. It had been in his family for several years and was irreplacable.
    Paula could only say she was sorry that it happened but that it had not
    been her fault.

        She spent the next few minutes explaining to him what had happened
    and how she had found the apartment when she awoke the next morning.
    After listening to her story, Charles had replied that she may not be
    at fault, but was reponsible for the damage all the same. Paula agreed
    with that, but said that she didn't know what she could do to make
    amends.

        She could see in his eyes something that she'd never seen before.
    It was a look that said to her that he didn't buy her story, and she
    wasn't about to get away with it. One look at him was enough to make
    her begin crying and saying over and over again how sorry she was.

        They worked it out in the following manner: Paula would pay him
    400.00 a week for one year, until he was paid a total of 20,800
    dollars. He had told her that it would not completely repay her debt,
    but would go a long way in restoring his faith in her as a friend.


        Paula truthfully told him that she could not afford to give him
    that much money every week. But Charles seemed to have a solution ready
    for that. He told her that he would pay her that much every week, to in
    effect be his maid. She would come to his house every day for a year,
    clean the house, feed the animals, make his dinner, and be available
    for whatever he might ask of her until midnight, when she would be
    allowed to return to her own home. For her services in that manner, he
    would pay her 400.00 a week, and would in turn deduct it from her
    salary until the year had elapsed.

        She covered her face with her hands and began to cry harder, not
    caring at all for his solution, but knowing she would do it all the
    same. She could not afford to pay him that much money, she only hoped
    that he would not ask anything unreasonable of her.

        Paula finally agreed to his terms, and they set about to writing a
    contract for their deal. Paula, being an attorney, knew that the
    contract was binding and if she were to break it, he would be able to
    sue her.

        Once they signed the contract, Charles asked her if she wanted to
    begin right then, or would she rather wait until the next day. Paula
    figured that there was no sense putting it off, so she told him that
    they might as well start right then.
    "Okay then, you can start by taking off all of your clothes." Charles
    told her to her great dismay.

        Knowing she was trapped, she did just that, sobbing and sniffling
    the whole time until she had shed all of her clothes and was standing
    naked, and extremely embarrassed in front of him. Paula knew that she
    would have to let him fuck her if he wanted. Under normal
    circmumstances, Paula would have liked that very much. But like this,
    the pretty attorney could feel nothing but humiliated.

        "Now" Charles said, breaking her thoughts "Each day when you come,
    the first thing you will do is take off all your clothes." Paula looked
    at him in horror when she understood what it was that he had just told
    her. All she did was nod. He told her to get her ass busy and cook his
    dinner, he was hungry.

        Things like this only happen in the lowest grade of films. They
    don't happen to real people. But Paula had let herself be trapped into
    this situation and legally, she knew that there was nothing she could
    do about it. She had signed a binding agreement than in effect made her
    Charles' slave for the duration.

        Charles made Paula stand with her hands behind her back at the side
    of the table while he ate his dinner. What she prepared, made no
    differnce. What DID matter was that the food was not exactly to his
    liking. After he dabbed his lips with the napkin, he scooted his chair
    back and beckoned for Paula to move closer.

        She very slowly moved the two or three steps to his chair and stood
    there with her hands still clasped behind her back. He told her that he
    expected to be fed better than that, and that he would now give her
    something to serve as a reminder of that.


        Before Paula could digest those words, Charles had lashed out and
    caught the woman by her arm. Pulling her over his lap just as she began
    to struggle.

        He could have easily overpowered her, but the only thing he did
    during the lovely attorney's fighting was to calmly mention the
    contract, and that she would desist that instant. Defeated, Paula let
    her head hang over his legs in dejection and saw the floor looking
    awfully blurry through her tears.

        A moment later, Charles began to pommel her cute asscheeks with his
    beefy right hand. The sharp cracking the slapping caused sounded like
    pistol shots. Paula cried out in agony with each stroke, pitifully
    sobbing as the full impact of her ordeal was STILL not being made known
    to her.

        As her bottom cheeks began to get very red and sore, Paula could
    only wonder how she ever could have called this man a friend. Charles
    spanked her until he figured that she was no longer reacting to the
    strokes. Once he stopped, he stood the pretty attorney up and told her
    to go and draw his bath.

        In the bathroom, Paula turned on the water and then dropped to her
    knees, letting out her anguish while the tub began to fill. A few
    moments later, Charles walked into the bathroom garbed in a robe. After
    leaningover and checking the temperature with his finger, he shrugged
    the robe from his shoulders and then stepped into the tub.

        He made Paula remain kneeling on the side of the tub, and give him
    his bath. She found that no matter how hard she tried, she just could
    not bring herself to look directly at him. She had bathed him as per
    his instructions. Then again as ordered, Got a towel and dried him off
    when he stepped out of the tub.

        Still on her knees, Paula was shocked when his cock seemed to bob
    up against her cheek. She looked at saw that it was beginning to rise,
    and that she was undoubtedly the one who would have to take care of it.
    Once she had completely dried him off, Charles told her to stand up and
    bend over the toilet.

        Paula had begun to cry again as her worst fears were about to be
    realised. When she bent over, Charles took her by the hips and forced
    her to open her legs. A few seconds later, she felt something nosing
    around her cunt... His cock was now hard and rubbing up against her
    pussy lips, leaving pre-cum in it's wake.

        Then without warning, Charles brought his cock to her opening and
    savagely thrust it inside of her. I suppose it should come as no
    surprise that she was pretty well lubricated, but that in no way
    detracted from the absolute agony of his sudden entry.

        Paula squealed in pain and sobbed loudly when he began pounding
    into her cunt with long, vicious strokes. The only thing that made the
    brutal penetration bearable was the fact she Paula was so well
    lubricated, not that she would have believed it.



        Charles tightened his grip on her hips and slapped his thighs
    against her still somewhat sore bottom, causing the pretty attorney to
    nearly bump her head on the wall several times.

        Mercifully, the searing pain of his sudden intrusion began to
    subside, to be replaced with an almost heavenly feeling of numbness.
    Once Paula had become accustomed to his bulk and the pain started to
    lessen, she was able to relax a bit and found to both her delight and
    her dismay that she was actually beginning to enjoy being fucked by
    this pig whom she called a friend.

        More than merely enjoying it, the blonde haired woman was slowly
    climbing toward what would have to be a mind blowing orgasm. Now, Paula
    was moaning in pleasure when Charles sent his cock cannonading into her
    burning pussy. Charles picked up the change in his `maid' and reached
    his hand around her to roughly manipulate her clitoris.

        Paula reacted by shoving her sexy ass back at him and wrigging
    while she waited impatiently for the next bonejarring thrust.
    "MMmmmmm God yes! Harder.. Fuck me harder!" She wailed out at the
    bathroom wall. She could hear him bleating in her ear from behind, not
    aware that she was about to be left unfulfilled.

        Her pussy was just too much for Charles. He was having a lot of
    trouble keeping himself from coming and soon began stroking into the
    velvet like confines with short, powerful strokes. Paula groaned and
    undulated her hips in a wicked manner while she climbed steadily toward
    her own climax.

        But she wasn't to have it, Charles howled in her while his hot load
    erupted from his balls and bathed the pretty attorney's pussy after
    it's discharge. "No Damn you! Wait for me you bastard!" Paula screamed
    at him. But he was too far gone to even have heard a word she was
    screaming at him. All he could do was just grab her flared hips tightly
    and revel in his own pleasure.

        Paula was once again beginning to sob, but this time in
    frustration. Charles put his hand on her back and started to pull out
    of her gripping cunt.......




        Paula awoke with a start and found that she was still crying. Tears
    were rolling down her pretty face as she reached under the blanket,
    clawing at her panties and started rubbing her cunt furiously. This had
    been one of her most vivid dreams and her burning pussy reflected this
    while she maddeningly began to work toward the orgasm she was cheated
    out of in her dream.

        She was chanting something incoherently while in her mind's eye,
    that wonderful cock was slamming into her pussy with reckless abandon.
    She cried out long and hard when her burning climax erupted through her
    soul like lava from a volcano, consuming everything in it's path.


        Minutes later, Paula had done her best to compose herself and
    finally began to stop crying. The dreams were beginning to come with
    more frequency that when they first started about 3 months earlier.

        You see, about 3 or 4 nights a week, Paula dreams of being held in
    a situation where she was not in control. Not that she understood why
    things like that would move her so, but there was no denying the fact
    that she always woke up after one of these dreams drenched with sweat
    and a hot pussy screaming for attention. Attention, she always did her
    best to satisfy. Most of the time, she would pull a vibrator from her
    night table and work it into herself, but this night was far too urgent
    to wait until she could get to the phallic shaped vibrator.

        The dreams began innocently enough. She had the flu and was laying
    in bed watching an old Elvis Presley movie. Blue Hawaii to be exact.
    Anyone who has seen the movie will recall a scene toward the end where
    the King finally has enough of the spoiled brat and took her over his
    knee. Paula's cunt convulsed at that point for reasons she did not
    know. But later that night, in her sleep, it was the pretty attorney
    who found herself draped over Elvis' knee getting her bottom swatted.

        Getting out of bed was fast becoming a chore for the usually driven
    lawyer. She couldn't wait to get to work and start her duties at the
    law firm where she was employed. That is, until lately when Paula began
    finding it harder and harder to get up, dressed and out the door. Today
    would be no exception, but she wasn't going to work. No, the dreams had
    gotten the best of her and she was going to see a psychaitrist about her
    problem. So after a few minutes lounging in the afterglow of her
    climax, Paula struggled out of bed and made for the bathroom.

        28 years old, Paula was no stunning beauty by any means of the
    word. But she had a fresh look about her that made her sexy in most
    men's eyes. Her lithe 5'7" frame seemed to glide across the floor when
    she walked, carrying her 130 lbs. very nicely.  It had been only since
    she began having trouble getting out of bed that Paula decided to style
    her hair in a way that would not need much upkeep. So she had her
    shoulder length blonde hair cut into a permanent. Not real tight curls,
    but tight enough that each one seemed to bounce in a different
    direction when she walked or the wind hit it.

        After a shower and a light breakfast, she dressed herself in a sky
    blue pleated skirt and matching blouse. She always seemed to like to
    wear clothes that didn't contrast her ice blue eyes. In fact to me,
    Paula's eyes are her best quality. They had that aire about them that
    has never failed to make stong men go weak in the knees when she
    glanced their way.

        She stopped to buy a newspaper on the way, figuring that she'd read
    it while waiting for the doctor to see her. As she was paying for the
    paper, she saw something that made her pussy convulse. It was a
    swinger's magazine that had a picture on the cover of a scantily clad
    lady, on her knees with her hands bound behind her back. She was
    kneeling in front of a man wearing all leather and holding a wicked
    looking riding crop over his head as if he were about to strike her
    with it.

        Trying her best to wipe the lewd thoughts from her mind, Paula
    quickly paid for the newspaper and made her way down the street.


        Paula had barely had time to begin looking at her newspaper before
    the doctor's receptionist informed her that the doctor was ready to see
    her. She was quite nervous as she stood up and made her way into his
    office.

        The young attorney told the doctor in great detail about her
    dreams, and even related specific details when she was prompted. She
    felt herself blush when she did so, but she had told herself that no
    matter what, she wanted to be rid of this problem. But after just
    chatting back and forth for several minutes, the doctor told her
    something she wasn't sure she wanted to hear.

        He began by telling her that before you can dream something, it
    would have to be in your mind to begin with. The fact that the dreams
    are that vivid would probably mean that it's very prominent in her
    mind.
    "But, I don't like things like that!" Paula protested loudly and
    suddenly. The doctor raised his eyebrows, and gave her a `Yeah, sure
    you don't' look.
    "I think a more accurate thing to say would be that you are not AWARE
    that you like things like that." He said, causing Paula to open her
    eyes wide and stare at him in disbelief.

        "There's nothing wrong with having these feelings." He was trying
    to reassure her, now. " You have a high pressure job where you have to
    make a lot of decisions that effect people, correct?" Paula nodded
    silently.
    "A lot of people are in the same situation as you, and you'd be
    surprised how just how many people I see in here just like yourself."

        Paula wasn't sure she believed him, but she did begin to relax a
    bit. he continued. "Being sexually submissive is in my opinion a
    perfectly natural reaction to having such a high pressure job." She
    looked at him quizzically so he continued. "Most submissive people
    simply do not want to have to make any decisions once they leave work."

        She was listening to him, not really sure if she was actually
    comprehending what he was saying, but listening to him all the same. He
    was in effect, trying to tell her that she was submissive but just
    haven't recognized that fact as of yet.

        Paula spent the better part of the session listening to him explain
    the psycological aspect of sexual submissiveness, and where she herself
    might fit in.  The jest of it all, seemed to be that it was ok for her
    to have those dreams. Which, when you come right down to it, was not
    what the pretty attorney wanted to hear in the first place. She WANTED
    to hear how wrong it was for her to have those dreams, and how terrible
    it was for her to harbour those thoughts in the first place.

        The doctor had told her that she ought to make an appointment to
    see him again next week, but she had declined to do so, citing that she
    really didn't believe he would be able to help her. So off she went,
    back home where she didn't know what she was going to do.
