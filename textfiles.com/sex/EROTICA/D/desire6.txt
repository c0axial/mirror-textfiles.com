                        ***** THE DESIRE TO KNOW *****
                              **** CHAPTER 6 ****


        Paula did as she was asked, walking to the sofa and sitting next to
    him. Once sitting, Frank told her to turn her back toward him. Paula
    was becoming quickly more and more confused as she slid her bottom on
    the sofa, turning away from him. She turned her head to look at him
    over her shoulder, but was promptly told to look the way she was
    facing.

        Her stomach started to tighten up as the prospect to imminent
    danger presented itself to her. A few seconds later, she nearly jumped
    out of her clothes when he reached over and took both of her arms in
    his hands, pulling them behind her.

        Paula was now getting quite nervous as she heard a click and then a
    cold feeling on her arms. Frank had produced a pair of handcuffs from
    the bag and snapped them on her wrists.
    "What are you doing?!" Paula cried out, trying to pull her arms back in
    front of her and turning her head at the same time to again look behind
    her.

        Frank was smiling at her, saying that he just wanted to give her a
    little gift. Nervous and confused, Paula watched while he again reached
    into the bag and came out with a jewelry box. He opened it and pulled
    out a gold bracelet.

        Paula couldn't see her wrists, but she felt him wrapping the
    bracelet around her wrist, just above the steel cuff. Now his arms were
    around her waist, standing her up and leading her toward one of the
    walls. Her confusion reached a new height as his hands then pressed on
    her shoulders, a clear signal that he wanted her on her knees.

        She didn't resist and let herself slip to her knees, but Frank kept
    pushing. He wanted her on her stomach, where she found herself a few
    seconds later.

        Frank then got a towel and placed in on her back, under her wrists.
    Now the nervousness the pretty blonde was feeling turned into fright as
    she saw him plug something into the wall.

        He knelt alongside her and lifted her hands up. Paula felt the
    tightening in her shoulders when he did this. It wasn't all that
    painful, but didn't feel all that natural, which of course it wasnt, as
    arms were not made to be manipulated in this manner.

        Frank had plugged a soldering iron into the wall and was waiting
    for the element to heat up enough for the job it was to do. Holding
    Paula's hands up, he could feel the shaking that came from within her.
    He understood that she was scared, be he wasn't going to hurt her. No,
    he had something else in mind.

        Once the iron was hot enough, he broght it to Paula's wrist and
    began to fuse the clasp on the bracelet. Paula jumped when she felt the
    warmth turn hotter. She cried out once or twice during the process as
    the heat got a little too extreme for her.


        It took about 2 minutes for the soldering iron to render the clasp
    on the bracelet useless. he then unplugged it and sat the still red hot
    iron into it's holder, and helped the still shaking blonde to her feet.

        He then got the key to the handcuffs and released her arms. Paula
    instantly brought her arms in front of her to see exactly what it was
    that he had done. It was a very nice bracelet, obviously real gold.
    There was also an inscription on it, it said "Property of Frank
    Calledano" in shimmering letters. Paula turned her wrist over and then
    understood what Frank had done. The bracelet was not meant to be
    removed.

        "As long as you belong to me, that identificaton bracelet will
    remain on you." He said, looking into her eyes. The gesture moved her
    in a way she could not explain, or comprehend and she nodded her head,
    with her eyes getting a bit misty. He had just told her that she
    belonged to him, that she was his property, and she was all of a sudden
    the happiest woman alive.

        Paula wanted to be held at that moment. She reached out and wrapped
    her arms around him, or rather would have if he had not grabbed her
    arms with his hands.
    "Take off your clothes, Paula" He said shortly, and sternly as he
    dropped her arms and proceeded to put the things he had taken out away.

        She had not put anything except the shorts and t-shirt on that
    morning, save for a pair of house slippers. Stripping naked was a
    matter of simply slipping off the loose fitting garments. Paula stodd
    there holding the removed clothes in her hands.

        Frank walked back into the room and took them from her, tossing
    them on the sofa and telling her to bring him her purse. Paula's eyes
    showed confusion as she did what he wanted. He took the purse and
    opened it, reaching inside and taking her keys out. Before she could
    ask what he was doing with her keys, Frank dropped the purse on the
    sofa and said.
    "You go into the bathroom, and take a bath. Do not get out of the tub
    until I came back and tell you to get out. Is that clear?"

        Paula said that it was, but wasn't at all happy about what she
    thought he was about to do.
    "Fine. I'm going to your house and get a few things, i'll be back in
    about 30 minutes."
    She was going to ask him what he needed to get from HER house, but
    changed her mind quickly when he suddenly slapped her bottom not too
    lightly and told her to go wait for him in the tub.

        She didn't utter another word as she made her way to the bathroom.
    The prospect of a 30 minute soak in the tub was indeed a rather
    appealing one. But the idea of him in her house while she wasn't there
    to watch what he up to wasn't something she would choose to do under
    normal circumstances.

        The water felt wonderful. She sighed and just laid back, letting
    the soothing warmth engulf her.


        Actually, the idea of a bath wasn't a bad one at all. She had been
    working around the house all morning and was sure that scent we all try
    to keep masked had brought itself to the forefront.

        While waiting, and enjoying the bath, Paula couldn't help but
    wonder what Frank was up to.  It wasn't hard at all for her to realise
    that she wasn't just there to receive a bracelet and take a bath.

        Her answer came when Frank returned and walked into the bathroom.
    He set a small bag full of her toiletries on the wash basin and then
    told her to meet him in his bedroom after drying herself off.

        Padding naked into his bedroom, the first thing to catch her eye
    was the two suitcases she recognized as her own, sitting on the bed. He
    told her to open them, and make sure that all she would need for the
    next two weeks was there.
    "The next two weeks?" She looked at him, puzzled.
    "You need to be trained. It'll be much easier if you're here, instead
    of at home." He replied as she blushed at his answer.

        So her vacation had already been planned out for her, without her
    knowledge. Paula opened one of the suitcases and found an array of
    skirts, blouses.. etc. The other one contained more intimate type of
    apparel. In particular, there were 4 short nighties that she never
    wore. She usually slept in a long t-shirt, but it seemed as if Frank
    had something else in mind for her sleeping attire.

        Moving the nighties aside, Paula was a bit shocked to see her
    vibrator sitting in the suitcase. She immediately felt herself blush
    deeper than she had before.

        Frank stood back near the doorway, watching his lover rummaging
    through the suitcases. Her ass still showed faint reminders of the
    previous night's action, in the form of 2 or 3 small bruises. He made a
    mental note to himself to take a little more care not to cause those
    bruises again.

        When he was satisfied that Paula had ample time to survey the
    contents of the suitcases, Frank opened 2 drawers in his dresser and
    told her to put what she could in them, and hang the other things in
    the closet.

        He left the room then, leaving Paula to the task at hand. Frank had
    a special evening planned, and went to prepare for it.

        It wasn't at all hard for Paula to realise that he had plans of her
    spending time at his house. But the only thing she didn't know, was
    WHY. After packing away her clothes, she went back into the living room
    and found Frank sitting on his sofa looking through what looked to be
    an address book.

    "You're finshed?" He looked up and asked when he felt her presence in
    the room.
    "Yes." She said. It seemed as if she was not at all aware that she was
    standing around totally naked. She was aware alright, it's just that
    she wasn't bothered by it.


    "Can I ask you something?" Paula wanted to know. Frank nodded his head
    and closed the book to give her his attention.
    "Why do I have all these clothes over here?"
    "Because you're going to be staying here for a couple of weeks." frank
    replied matter of factly.
    "No, I figured that." She started "What I meant was, WHY am I going to
    be staying here?"
    "Oh" he said, understanding the question. "It's just that it'll be much
    easier for me to train you if you're staying here."

        Paula opened her mouth as if she wanted to speak, but nothing came
    out. After a few moments of silence she finally spoke again.
    "Train me?" She looked at him strangely.
    "Yes, train you to be my slave." Frank answered, then opened his book
    and returned to his reading.

        Suddenly, the implications of her `belonging to him' took on an
    altogether new meaning than it had earlier in the afternoon.

        I said that Frank had a special evening planned. He had gone into
    the bedroom and laid out a few of Paula's things. Actually, a skirt,
    blouse, stockings and garter belt. He told her this is what she'd be
    wearing that evening, and that they would be dining at a favorite
    restaurant of his.

        Paula had around 2 hours to herself after the conversation she had
    with Frank. Although she had come to grips with the idea that she liked
    the things he did to her, she wasn't able to fully comprehend the idea
    of being a slave, even though it made her pussy twitch when he said it.

        She wasn't at all surprised to find that he had not laid out and
    panties for her to wear. Paula had to admit that she felt deliciously
    naughty whenever she dressed without them. Once she had gotten dressed
    for the evening, her and Frank left the house, and 45 minutes later
    were enjoying a nice conversation over dinner in a very chic
    restaurant.

        While having coffee, Frank asked her if she would like to go out
    dancing. He knew a great place not far from there. Dancing, she hadn't
    been dancing in the longest time.
    "Yes, that would be fun." she said.

        They had been there for about an hour, and had danced at least six
    times in that time. She WAS having a good time. It was when everyone
    suddenly left the lounge, except them, and another couple who was
    sitting at a table near them that Paula began to thing that something
    was not right.

        Another song started and Paula found herself being led onto the
    dance floor. She noticed that the other couple did the same. Except
    they didn't actually `dance' on this occasion. Paula was being held
    with her back to the other couple, swaying back and forth.

        She felt those twinges of nervousness stirring inside of her
    whenever something out of the ordinary began to happen.


        The song ended and another quickly started. Paula gasped softly
    when she felt his hands moving lower down her body. Franks hands were
    now on her bottom. They had gripped the material of her skirt and were
    slowly raising it up her curvacous legs.

        Paula turned her head and looked behind her, catching a glimpse of
    what appeared to be the same thing that was happening to her before
    Frank whispered sharply into her ear to turn back around and look at
    him.

        It was true, while Frank was slowly revealing Paula's legs and
    thighs, the other man was doing the same thing with the woman he was
    with. The only difference, is that the other woman KNEW what was going
    on whereas Paula hadn't the slightest idea.

        Paula looked up into his eyes and pleaded with her own for him to
    stop what he was doing. She whimpered in protest when she felt her
    skirt being raised past her stockings. He smiled down at her then
    started whispering in her ear again. "Yes my love, he's watching us
    just as i'm watching them."

        Now Frank's hands were on her bared for all to see ass. Paula
    struggled briefly to get away, until she heard a sharp smacking sound
    then a soft crying out from behind her. Frank was whispering to her,..
    "Your ass is much nicer than her's." The only thing Paula had
    remembered about the other couple was that the woman was short and
    dark.

        His fingers were massaging her ass while he described to Paula what
    was happening behind them. Everything he described was also happening
    to her at that same time. She could help herself, she turned around and
    looked at the bared ass of the other woman before being given a sharp
    slap on her own bottom and being told again to turn around.

        Paula was being put on display! But the pretty attorney could stop
    herself from getting turned on at the nasty thought. Frank then gently
    pulled her asscheeks apart and told her that the other woman's asshole
    looked as if it was well traveled. Paula nearly jumped out of his grip
    when she felt a finger probing her anus.

        The blonde woman had never had anything in her ass and wasn't sure
    she cared to either. Frank seemed to get the idea and backed his finger
    away. He brought his finger down and raked it on her pussy, chuckling
    when he found it wet. "You naughty bitch! " he whispered "You like
    this!" It wasn't a question, and Paula was quite embarrassed to realise
    it was true.

        She looked up at him shyly and had to smile at the look on his
    face. He whispered for her to part her legs and stopped the swaying
    movements. Now he just held his hands on her ass, as they stood still
    on the dance floor.

        Behind her, Paula could heard the other woman utter a "Yes master"
    a moment before she heard a series of rapid fire smacks. She knew the
    other woman was getting a spanking and suddenly began to anticipate
    getting one of her own as it seemed to be the flow of the event.


        She asked the question with her eyes while she listened to, and got
    more turned on by listening to the woman getting spanked behind her.
    The woman and been told to turn and grab her ankles while her date
    smacked her ass with sharp reverberating slaps.

        After he stopped at the only sounds Paula could hear where the
    woman's soft cries, Frank told her that she had `won' and would now be
    getting her prize.

        Before Paula could register the fact that it had been some sort of
    contest between the two men, She yelped in surprise when she felt soft
    hands on her hips. They weren't Frank's. Paula knew right away that
    they were the hands of the nameless brunette she had been in some kind
    of competition with.

        She looked up at Frank and was about to call a halt to this latest
    twist when she felt something warm touch her right in the center of her
    cunt. The smaller woman had her face pressed against Paula's asscheeks
    and had begun to probe her tongue into the pretty blonde's cunt.

        No doubt about it, the dark haired woman knew how to please another
    woman. Paula sighed and held on tighter to Frank while the lovely cunt
    lapping began to take Paula on that climb to her summit of passion.

        Frank then pressed his mouth to her's and somehow got one of his
    hands between them. Paula tightened up momentairily when Franks hand
    somehow got caught on her pubic bush, but she relaxed when his finger
    searched for, then found her clit.

        The combination of the brunette woman's light, fluttering tonging
    of her twitching pussy and Frank rubbing her clit would normally had
    been enough to send her flying. But add to that the fact that it was
    all happening in a public place, and she was ready to literally
    explode.

        Behind her, the smaller woman's friend had taken his pants down and
    was kneeling behind her, lining up, then thrusting his prick into her.
    This caused a muffled sigh from the sucking woman and had her fucking
    her tongue into Paula all that much more urgently.

        Paula's fingers dug into Frank's shoulders. She probably would have
    cut into flesh had he not been wearing a dinner jacket. The brunette
    was about to bring her off when Frank recognised that and abruptly
    pulled her away. She leaned into him to keep her balance while the
    woman who had been doing the magnificent job on her lowered her head
    and pushed her plump ass back at the man who was pounding into her.

        Frank led Paula back to their table and told her to get her purse
    as they were leaving. Just before they walked out, Frank turned to his
    friend and said "Good luck next time!" then ushered her out of the door
    with a pointed pat on her bottom.
