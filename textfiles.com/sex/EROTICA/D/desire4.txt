                        ***** THE DESIRE TO KNOW *****
                              **** CHAPTER 4 ****


        Paula found it terribly hard to keep her mind on her work the next
    day as the anticipation of the night ahead took almost her full
    attention. What made it worse was that this was a court day. Her
    opponent was running circles around her in what should have been an
    open and shut case.

        She had eventually triumphed, but only after a long recess and a
    trip to the ladies room to relieve herself somewhat. After court, the
    senior partner of her firm took her aside and voiced his concern over
    her lackluster performance. She told him that she had a lot on her mind
    and that it would not happen again.

        In the end, He had suggested that she take a couple of weeks
    vacation that she had built up, and try to work out what was on her
    mind. Although she tried to protest, her boss would hear none of it. He
    told her that they could not afford to have someone that wasn't working
    on all cylinders, and that she deserved some time off in the first
    place.

        So Paula went home knowing that she was going to have to do
    something, and quickly, with what had been dominating her thoughts for
    the past couple of weeks. She decided that if she went back to work
    after her vacation, and still couldn't keep her mind on it, she would
    have to tell Frank that she wouldn't see him anymore. Thrilling as it
    may be, it just wasn't worth ruining her career over.

        But the pretty blonde had what she imagined would prove to be a
    very interesting evening ahead of her. Paula dressed herself with the
    utmost care on this particular occasion. Making sure everything was
    just right, from her skirt all the way down to her prettiest panties
    and stockings.

        She stood in front of the mirror wearing only her hose and panties,
    scrutinizing herself. Once satisfied that she looked acceptable to what
    she was beginning to learn were Frank's exacting standards, she pulled
    her skirt on over the cinnamon colored stockings and completed her
    outfit with a somewhat modest bra and blouse.

        By the time Frank made his appearance at her door at 7:45, Paula
    was going absolutely out of her mind with anticipation. When she opened
    the door for him, Frank took her by the elbows and kissed her briefly
    in such a way that took her breath nearly out of her. Paula knew that
    dinner was going to be much too long for her.

        She was right. Time seemed to crawl all during dinner. Although she
    did her best to follow along with their conversation, it was becoming
    increasingly hard to do so, especially when Frank looked at her with
    penetrating glances that made her squirm her bottom against her seat.

        Frank seemed quite interested in what Paula related to him about
    her day in court. As a matter of fact, his eyes got a strange gleam in
    them when he was told that she would be on vacation for the next two
    weeks. He didn't tell her what was on his mind, but that two weeks
    would definitely be two weeks that she would not forget.


        The disappointment on Paula's face was clear when instead of
    returning to Frank's house as she figured he would, he pulled up in
    front of her own house. Frank normally waited until she had unlocked
    and opened her door before kissing her goodnight and leaving. But when
    Paula opened her door that night, Frank put his hand gently on her
    shoulder and lightly pushed her inside, where he followed and closed
    the door behind him.

        Paula turned and looked at him imploringly, not at all sure what he
    was doing. Just when she thought she knew what was happening, he would
    do something unexpected to leave her befuddled once again.

        Frank glided past her and walked into the living room, headed
    straight for the bar and made himself a Scotch & Soda, not even asking
    her if she wanted one. Paula moved to and stood on the side of her
    sofa, unsure of what she should do, or say at this point.

        She watched him closely when he moved to a chair and seated
    himself. There was no doubt about it, he was playing her like a well
    tuned violin, carefully picking the next note to play.
    "Sit Down, Paula" He said, gesturing to the sofa she was standing
    against, using her hand to keep her balance.

        She sat, in a whirlwind of doubt, and a surreal vertigo.
    "I told you that we'd discuss your little stunt of last night." He
    started, pausing to gauge her reaction, her eyes were glued to him,
    absorbing every word.
    "Of course you remember that, don't you?"  The woman nodded wordlessly
    in answer to his question.
    "Answer me!" he snapped, causing her to blink rapidly several times as
    if snapped out of a daydream.
    "Yes, I remember" She said in a small voice, averting her eyes.
    "Alright, have you been thinking about it?" He wanted to know, it was
    a silly question to ask.
    "Yes, I have" again in a small voice.
    "Paula, look at me when you're speaking" He said sternly, causing her
    to look up quickly.
    "Yes, I've thought about it" She answered again, this time to his
    specifications.

        One thing was obvious, sitting still was something the pretty
    attorney couldn't do even if he told her to do so. She held her legs
    closed and squeezed her thighs together, causing pangs of deliciously
    forbidden pleasure to churn from within.
    "That's fine, Paula. Now tell me whether or not you believe that you
    should be punished for what you did last night."

        This wasn't something she thought about at all. No, she thought
    about actually HAVING it happen, not whether she deserved it or not.
    "Uhh.. If I was wrong.." She tried to choose her words as to not give
    the wrong impression.
    "Alright then, do you think you were wrong?" He pressed on.

        Of course she didn't think she was wrong, it was an impossible
    thing to stop herself from climax once it had already started. But
    somehow, she sensed that this wasn't what he wanted to hear.


        "Yes, I was wrong." She answered after a brief pause.
    "Well, then it's clear that if you were wrong, then you should be
    punished." He stated. "Is that correct, Paula?"  He was making her
    crazy.
    "y Yes, that's right." She said slowly, losing what little composure
    she had somehow maintained until then.

        Frank sat back and coolly sipped his drink.
    "Good, I wouldn't want to punish you unless you agreed it was the right
    thing to do." Paula's mind raced, trying to figure out what he was up
    to. "Just do it, for god's sake!!" she screamed at him in her mind. She
    didn't know the appropriate thing to say at this moment so she said
    nothing at all.

        What followed was a very thick silence between them. Frank
    continued to nurse his drink while she sat in tortured silence.
    Finally, when he had drained his glass, he spoke to her.
    "Stand up, Paula!" He barked, getting up himself and bringing his glass
    to the bar. He laid it down and turned in time to see her gracefully
    rise from the sofa. He didn't see her trembling, but she was shaking
    all over at that moment.

        He walked toward her and stopped just short, behind the piece of
    furniture Paula used to keep herself steady. Frank studied her in a way
    that goes way beyond some man undressing a woman with his eyes. The
    way he looked at her caused goosebumps to rise on her skin. Finally, he
    motioned for her to join him behind the sofa.

        Heart fluttering a mile a minute, She gingerly took the 3 steps to
    where he was standing. She stopped in front of him and instinctively
    averted her eyes from his gaze. Taking her by the arm, Frank guided her
    to stand up against the back of the sofa, facing away. Drawing in a
    deep breath, Paula waited somewhat impatiently to feel him raise her
    skirt.

        He did nothing of the sort of this occasion. After several seconds
    of silence from behind her, Paula turned her head and asked him with a
    silent plea to do it, she was not having much success in having to wait
    like this.
    "Lift your skirt and hold it up, Paula" He said in response to her
    unspoken request.

        She did as she was told, bringing her skirt up and bunching it
    around her waist, where she held it with tightly clenched fists. Even
    the cool air of her living room felt extremely hot to the blonde
    attorney at that moment.

        Frank put his hands on either side of her hips and slid her panties
    down her legs. The slight scratchy sound of the cotton panties rubbing
    against her stockings was the only sound in the room save for each of
    their breathing, which was getting kind of ragged.

        Now with Paula's ass in view providing a delectable sight for him
    to feast his eyes on, Frank set about to the task of spanking those
    shapely buns of her's


        The first time was slow, and steady. Frank put an arm around the
    front of her waist and begin to sting her bottom with several rapid
    fire slaps. Early on, Paula just drew in a sharp breath when she felt
    the first slap. But when the next one came just as the stinging began
    to register in her brain, she cried out involuntarily at the shock.

        Her ass darkened in hue in an astoundingly quick time. Once, after
    a particularily sharp stroke, Paula lost her balance and began to fall
    forward, causing her to release her iron grip on her skirt to brace
    herself against the sofa. The swampy feeling in her cunt was there, but
    at that moment, the burning in her ass far overpowered it. It then
    dawned on her that this was a REAL punishment, that Frank was not
    joking when he said he was going to punish her.

        And he wasn't finished. He told her in a calm, steely voice to lift
    her skirt back up the way she had it. As her now visibly trembling
    hands went down to do his bidding, she turned her head toward him and
    gazed through glassy eyes at him. There was nothing in his face that
    could be seen as forgiveness.

        When her bare bottom was presented to him again, Frank resumed the
    spanking. Paula no longer cried out at his vigourous smacks, but
    grunted beteeen her childlike sobs. Tears pours down her cheeks, but
    Paula never attempted to shield her ass from the blows. Something in
    her mind told her that would not be the smartest thing for her to do at
    that time.

        When Frank had Paula's sexy bottom a uniform, very bright pink. He
    stopped spanking her and bade her to turn around and face him. She
    started to let her skirt drop, but the look on his face told her that
    she'd better not. Now he put his arms around her back and held her
    close to him, the closeness made the 28 year old woman feel like a 6
    year old. She let her sobs ring out loud and clear as she buried her
    head in his shoulder.

        He held and soothed her for a few minutes, until sobs subsided to
    choked back ones and sniffles. He stepped back a little and tilted her
    chin up toward him. Her eyes were swollen and red from the crying as
    could be expected.
    "Paula, you're going to have to learn that when you disobey me, you're
    going to be punished."
    She stared at him mutely, now harboring thoughts of telling him to get
    out of her house, and her life.
    "Now, I want you to go over to the corner, and press your nose into
    it. You have much to think about." Frank said, gesturing toward a
    corner over his right shoulder.

        The intense burning was beginning to lessen a little. Enough to
    stop her from lashing out at him. Yes, she had plenty to think about.
    When she stepped away from her, she obediently made her way to the
    appointed corner and stood with her nose pressed into it, her hands
    still holding the skirt over her scorched bottom.
    "I'll be expecting you to think about how you're going to be obeying my
    orders in the future. I'll want to hear it in detail, so be prepared"
    He said in warning.



        Frank had prepared himself another drink and once again took his
    place on the chair he occupied when first coming in. From where he sat,
    he had the perfect view of Paula, standing in the corner like a naughty
    child. Watching her shifting her weight from foot to foot wasn't
    exactly what he wanted to be doing at that moment, but he knew there'd
    be plenty of time to enjoy other activities.

        There she was, a full grown adult standing in a corner of her
    living room, ass bared and on fire, while the one who caused it sat in
    a cozy chair watching her. She at once felt silly, chastised,
    humiliated, and sexually excited. No doubt about it, this spanking had
    been twice as bad as the one she had gotten earlier that week. The
    crying had stopped, but Paula still let out a stifled sob every now and
    again.

        Paula began to think about what it would be like to have to answer
    to Frank about every little detail, no matter how miniscule, in her
    life. Her first impulse was to dismiss the idea as being a silly one,
    but her next thought was of how bored she had become with men who were
    too willing to let her have everything she wanted.

        The fact that Frank was the first man in her life who acted the
    agressor somehow caused her to be drawn to him. It was only now that
    Paula began to realise just that. Not that it made these strange
    feelings seem any more natural, but at least now she was beginning to
    get a handle on the situation.

        Steadily, the heat in Paula's bottom spread out over the rest of
    her body. By the time she'd been standing in that corner for 20
    minutes, her nipples ached to be set free of their bonds. A little
    farther below, the heat onher ass snaked around and played havoc on her
    pussy and clit, setting them ablaze with that hot, itchy feeling that
    screamed to be scratched.

        Frank let her stand in silence for about 45 minutes before getting
    up and walking toward her. Paula held her breath when she heard his
    footsteps, wondering what he would do next. She only hoped it had
    something to do with her hungry cunt.

        He stood right behind her and let his fingertips lightly move over
    her ass. The first touch made Paula jump a little, but very quickly
    relax as she let herself go to his wandering fingers. With his breath
    on her neck, and his hands lovingly massaging her tender bottom, he
    asked her in her ear if she had been thinking about what he sent her
    there to ponder.

        She nodded yes, and was promptly rewarded with a reproaching
    squeeze of her still somewhat sore asscheeks.
    "Yes" she said under her breath. Now his hands roamed down, caressing
    each of her thighs while asking her if she was going to make it a point
    to obey his every command.
    "Yes" again came softly from her lips.
    "Good. And you know you'll be punished when you do not, right Paula?"

        His hands were doing wonderful things to her. "Yes" a third time in
    answer to his third question.


        "Then I believe we'll do just fine" Frank whispered, then put his
    hands over hers, taking them away from her skirt, letting it fall over
    her alluring legs and ass. Putting his hands on her shoulders, he
    turned her around to face him, and began undoing the buttons on her
    blouse while she looked up at him with that smoldering hunger in her
    eyes.

        Paula reached out to do the same for him, but Frank stopped her
    with a look that told her it would probably be in her best interests
    not to perform that particular task. He slipped her blouse off of her
    and then reached around to unhook, and remove her bra as well. The
    blonde's nipples stood at rigid attention when they were set free.

        Frank brought his hands up to them and started rolling each nipple
    between his thumbs and forefingers. Paula moaned in appreciation and
    leaned back a little, pressing her back and bottom against the corner
    she was still in. Gradually, his fingers on Paula's nipples tightened,
    until eventually the pretty attorney moaned in a mixture of pleasure
    and pain.

        He squeezed, She let out a small cry. He let up until Paula caught
    her breath, then squeezed again. With each new clamping down on her
    tender nipples, Paula found that the pain definitely became the same
    type of pleasurable pain afforded to her asscheeks a little while
    earlier.

        When his fingers released her aching, tingling nipples and began to
    inch downward, Paula groaned out her displeasure that he'd stopped
    manipulating her breasts in the fashioned he had. Groping for, and
    finding the zipper of her skirt, Frank undid it and let it fall down
    her legs.

        Paula stood before him, still clad in her shoes, stockings, and
    panties that had been rolled down to her thighs, still in the place he
    had put them. Now Frank stepped up to her, putting his hands on her
    warm bottom and pulling her close. Bringing his mouth to her's, He used
    his tongue to gently urge her lips to part, allowing him to explore the
    inside of her mouth with a sensual swirling motion.

        It was a kiss that literally took the blonde woman's breath right
    out of her. She drew in several breaths when he moved his mouth to her
    ear and began to whisper.
    "Oh baby, i'm so glad i've found you." It was the first time he had
    said anything like that to her. It was clear to her that he was feeling
    the same way as he felt, as she could plainly feel the bulge in his
    trousers while he held and whispered to her.
    "I'm going to teach you everything." He said. "You will learn to be
    mine.. Mind, body, and soul" His tongue grazed her earlobe and caused
    her to shiver. Then his hands were on her shoulders, firmly, but gently
    pressing down. Paula didn't need to be told that he wanted her on her
    knees, where she dropped to at his silent prompting.
