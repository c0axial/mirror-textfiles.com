			"NOT ANOTHER WORD!"
			  (a short story)


It was hard to believe!  Her last year of High School!  Donna Pularski
came home Friday afternoon at 5:00pm.  Already the first month of school 
was over!  She was anxious to get ready for her date!

Her mom greeted her at the door.

		"Mr. Baines called this afternoon," 
		 she said, somewhat calmly.


			!-------THUD!--------!


Donna's heart stopped!  Mr. Baines was the principal at the school!
.......He did NOT call often!

	 Mrs. Pularski looked at her daughter and her beet red face!
	 She knew.  

		"Yes..........He said you were absent today....and
		Wednesday.......and went home Tuesday after second
		hour because you were 'sick'!" 
		she spat out the words.

		"Seems your good friends Pam Davis and	Jane
		Kirby were also 'sick'!"

		"DO YOU THINK WE ARE STUPID!"                           
			  she yelled at the top of her lungs!

	(This was BAD! Donna worried to herself!)

		"Get 'em off and get downstairs!
		 ..........over Godzilla!"  Mrs. Pularski screamed!

	(OH NO! Donna gulped but didn't say a word...this was REAL BAD!)

"Godzilla" was the nick name the family used for the monstrosity of an 
 arm chair that her Dad bought at a charity auction.  It was fabric padded
  and almost two people could sit in it.  Mom and Dad fought over it. 
   Mrs. Pularski could barely move it to vacuum.  She wanted it out!  
    But Dad prevailed.....as always.


There was nothing worse than being over "Godzilla"!  You were stripped 
naked and tied!  Only twice before had it ever happened to her.  
Once last year, when she took the car without permission, and damaged 
the whole front end.  The other, three years ago for getting caught
smoking.


Maybe she thought, even though she wanted to protest being stripped......
.....after all she was 18!........that she  should just take it,  
get it over with before Dad  came home,
and...... MAYBE.....get to go out  tonight!

She went downstairs to the rec room, followed by her mother.  Without 
 too many words, she gathered up her courage and took off all her clothes 
  while her Mother watched!  GOD!  she felt so embarrassed being treated 
   like a child!  She literally had to hop up over the back of the 
    mammoth chair.  Her feet dangled.

Her mother tied her wrists to the heavy arms.  Then felt her legs being 
 pulled apart and  tied  to the heavy rear legs.  She just sort of
balanced 
  with her tummy on the back of the chair.  Arms stretched out and feet 
   tied wide and off the floor.

	"You are  now going to tell me what you and your friends did
	  when  you ditched school!" her mom yelled.

		SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!             
	SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!

		Her heavy hand descended rapidly before Donna
		could even reply!

		"By the way........I called Mrs. Davis and	 
		Mrs. Kirby and already got the "story"!
		You better make it good!"  She was in a fury!
		SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!

		Donna felt the heat in her bottom,  but it wasn't too bad.

	The truth was best she thought.

		"OHHHH! PLEASE STOP!" Donna yelled,
		trying  to sound more hurt than she actually
		was.  "We just met a couple of guys and rode 
		around in their car!  That's all!  I swear it!" 
		she added, somewhat convincingly.

	Mrs. Pularski was not convinced.

Just then her 16 year old  younger brother Michael, and his two friends 
Bill and Keith, burst in the front door, joking and yelling like animals, 
and shot right down to the rec room!


	"Oh........sorry Mom," he apologized, looking at his nude
	sister!  "We were just  going to play some computer games,"
	he finished......staring!


		"Michael......go upstairs and get my........"   
		Mrs. Pularski started to say......

		"GET OUT!    GET OUT OF HERE!"
		Donna screamed when she realized who
		was there.  She could not see too well behind her.  

		"GET THE FUCK.......out of......."Donna stopped in
		mid sentence.


OOOPS!........TOO LATE!   The "F" word was out of her mouth!

	You could hear a pin drop.

	Mrs. Pularski DESPISED crude language!

		"WHAT!!!!!!!        HOW DARE YOU
		TALK THAT WAY IN THIS HOUSE!"
		Mrs. Pularski shrieked!


	SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! 
	her Mom went crazy spanking her with her open hand.......
	........while the mesmerized boys watched!!

		"AAAAARRRGHHHHHH!!!" Donna
		 screamed at the stinging hand!                 
	
		 "PLEASE........I'M SORRY......PLEASE
		 SEND THE BOYS AWAY!!! she begged.
		 At 16, Bill was Michael's age, that was bad enough!
		 but Keith was a senior and in four of her classes!

			"I SHOULD THINK NOT!" she shouted
			back at her daughter.  "Why should they
			be forced out of their play area because
			of YOU!" she added.  "Michael, as I was
			saying, before being so CRUDELY 
			interrupted........Go get my HAIRBRUSH!"


Michael needed no encouragement. He was up and back down the stairs with
the brush like a rifle shot!

	"You boys go play your games!  I have some WORK to do!"         
	  Mrs. Pularski ordered.

The boys sat around the computer, only about 10 feet away from "Godzilla."
 They could see.......and hear......EVERYTHING!

	"SPLAT!........the brush came down on Donna's bare cheeks!

		"YEOOOOOOOOW!"  she screamed and kicked, drawing the few 
				 inches of slack rope taut.

	"SPLAT!  SPLAT!   SPLAT!   SPLAT! over and over the brush swatted 
	the now flaming red cheeks!
	SPLAT! SPLAT! SPLAT SPLAT!......they came faster and harder....
	...more  rhythm in the swing.

		"AGGGGGGGHHH!!  NO MOOOOORE!

	
		SPLAT! SPLAT!...........SPLAT! SPLAT!

		......she was pausing.....letting the sting travel!

The boys more often than not, turned from the computer and 
 watched wide eyed.  As the big  chair was only a foot from the
  wall, their view was from the side.  They  could see Donna's head
   and face rise and scream.  Her full breasts were hanging down.

Mrs. Pularski was laying on the strokes like a mad woman!  She 
finally stopped, breathing heavily.  Donna was screaming her head
off!

	"Now.....Miss Priss.......You will stay like this till your
	 FATHER comes home!" she panted out the words.


	 "And NOT ONE WORD FROM YOU!" she added.


	"BUT MOM!  HE WON'T BE HOME FOR AN HOUR!" Donna wailed!


		SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!
		the brush crashed down and Donna WAILED!

	"I SAID:  NOT ONE WORD!"  Mrs. Pularski again
				   shrieked!

	"PLEASE!"  Donna begged, "AT LEAST SEND THE BOYS AWAY!"         

		SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!
		the hairbrush bit into the tortured globes!

	Donna could barely speak.  She just jumped and twitched
	as if electrocuted!!!  Even after the brush stopped, she
	still bucked and rocked on the chair!

	"ANY THING MORE TO SAY?.......(silence)......WELL?
	(not a word).........GOOD!.......I have to fix your father's
	dinner now,"  Mrs. Pularski stated as she walked up the stairs.

 They boys could hear the pots and pans banging around upstairs
 in the kitchen.  They smiled to each other and walked over.....behind
 the chair.

	"Oh my," Michael chided.  They really were quite shocked!
	Donna's ass looked like someone had painted it red!  A
	mass of red flesh, a few purple marks, welts from the oblong
	shape of the brush....and hand prints!

Michael knelt down next to his sister and whispered to her:

	"Remember when you told Dad about my smoking last
	week and he whalloped me?  Just over my jeans though,
	not on my bare ass like yours!  But you shouldn't have
	told!" he taunted her.

(HE'S RIGHT! Donna reasoned.  Why was SHE getting it bare and not HIM!)

	"Your nose is full of snot and your mascara is all runny!
	  "You don't want Keith to  see you like this do you?"
	    he  wiped her face with a Kleenex.

	"But Keith isn't looking at your face.  He and Bill are
	kneeling down behind you.  You know what they're
	looking at?" he gleefully smiled as she raised her
	head up in shock!

	"NOT A WORD!" he reminded, as  her mouth opened
		      to speak........or scream!

	"We can see everything you know.  Your cute little ass all red.
	  Your pussy peeking through.....and, oh yeah, your little
	   brownie!" Michael chuckled and teased her.
	

Donna lowered her head......thoroughly shamed!   She could hear
them giggling behind her, but could not see them.  She strained and
tried to close her legs.....impossible!!!

Bill, always a bit more daring,   touched one bottom cheek!

	"OOOOOOOO!  IT'S HOT!"  he mused!

She felt other hands touch her inflamed cheeks and she squirmed.

	"Nnnnngggnnooooo," she implored

	"AH......AH.......NOT A WORD!" Michael shook his
					finger at her.

They became bolder and poked at her cheeks here and there.  Bill
slid a finger between her cheeks and touched her anus!

	"Mmmmmnnngggnnn," Donna gasped and jumped.

Seeing that she was going to stay quiet, Bill teased at the little hole
again!  leaving his finger there and rubbing the contracting pucker!

The  cheeks quivered and the legs strained, protesting the rude
touch!  He  continued to tickle it and they giggled as she twisted
and tried to move her hips to avoid the insult!

	"Nnnnn....Nnnnn.....Nnnnn....." she mewed and twisted.

The finger touched the little piece of skin between her  holes and
scratched it!

	She jumped and the ropes creaked!  The boys giggled softly.

The finger left her and she  sighed.  Her body raised and fell in
rhythmic heavy breathing.

	THEN!  SHE FELT IT!  The finger teasing apart
	the folds of her slit!  No  way   could  she see
	behind her.  She could only FEEL the finger worm
	its way inside!

Her reflexes took over and she strained against the ropes with all
her might!  The finger KNEW what to do!    It stroked her clit
back and forth!!!!!     More soft giggles!  The finger seemed to take
particular delight in snapping at her clit with its nail....over and over.



	"nooooooo....nmmmm......" she whispered as the
	  finger flipped the soft morsel to hardness.

She relaxed and  contracted as the finger stroked her to arousal.
Donna seethed   through clenched teeth as the pleasure raced up
her body.  Her breasts swelled and the nipples erected....they throbbed 
in time to her temples......pounding.

	"Agghhhhh....ooo..ohhhhh......" the sounds of passion
					  moaned.

A  boy whispered.
Unseen hands reached around and pinched  her nipples lightly. Then
pulled, twisted and rolled them, as the whisper continued.  The
finger continued.  She could feel an orgasm boiling
inside.....churning....
....as her clit was rolled and rubbed.

Two new fingers  slid up her channel while the clit was still being  
tormented.   They opened up like a pair of scissors, then closed, and 
started a slow piston like movement.....sliding in and  out.

	"MMMMMMMMMMNNNNNGGHH!" she  panted out.

The boys smiled as they watched her squirm.  She tried to hold on,
to save herself from the embarrassment of cumming before the
boys. But the teasings were too much.......she felt herself slip from
the edge and fall into the chasm of bliss!!!


	"AAAGGHHHMMMMMMmmmmmmmm," she grunted,
				  as the climax reached her every pore!

They whispered again and someone wiped her wet sex lips and
legs roughly with a cold moist cloth.  Then   pulled apart her
bottom cheeks and  wiped at her anus!  They giggled again.  They spent
quite some time teasing the crinkled pucker, chuckling at her contortions
to avoid their probes and touches!

			   HONK! HONK!

Michael smiled as he heard his father's familiar two taps of the horn
announcing his arrival.

	"Daddy's home Donna," he leaned over and  whispered
			       in her ear.

	"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh..........." she just groaned.

"HONEY?  I'M HOME!   he shouted,   PETE AND DAVE ARE
WITH ME.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A COUPLE OF BEERS,"
he added from the landing  just inside the front door.

	"Just a minute," Mrs. Pularski replied, and joined him
	on the landing and told him everything that happened
	and that Donna was down stairs......over "Godzilla".

The heavy foot steps descending the stairs, shocked Donna out
of her stupor.  The boys were at the computer as if nothing happened 
when her Father.......and his two friends!......entered the
room.

	"Well, Precious," he said as he stared at the reddened hind
	quarters, "looks like you really did it this time!"

Donna hung her head, knowing what a sight she must be!  

	"Me and the guys here, are going to have a beer, and then
	you're gonna get six with the strap!  In the meantime, you
	better come up with some answers as to what you did 
	while 'riding around' today!!"

	"Help me turn this chair around......too close to the wall
	for swinging," Mr. Pularski asked his two friends.

The three men grunted and lifted the chair, with Donna in it, and
placed it in the center of the room....her ass facing the window!!

The picture window, with its adjacent slider windows, filled the
center of the room with light.  To make matters worse, Mr. Pularski
flipped the light switch, and four 8 foot fluorescent tubes came to
life!   Donna cringed with new shame and embarrassment!!!

	"You boys want a beer too?" her Dad asked Michael
				     and his friends.

	"YEAH!  SURE!" they gleefully replied and left the computer
			and joined the "men" at  "the bar!"

	"You going to break the State receiving record this year,
	Keith?" Mr. Pularski asked the tall boy, while passing out
	beers to all.  He threw Keith his.

	"I hope so, sir.  As long as Mike here keeps throwing it
	to me, I'll catch 'em!" Keith answered.

(JESUS CHRIST!  Donna  thought to herself, Here I am tied over
this fucking chair, displaying EVERYTHING I own, and these
cocksuckers are talking about FOOTBALL!)

	"Keith got 27 campus request visits!" Michael exclaimed
					       to his Dad!

	"REALLY!  WOW THAT'S ALL RIGHT!" Mr. Pularski
	replied, "Any from......."
	
	"YEP!" Keith interrupted, knowing what was coming,
	"Going down to South Bend, next week!"

High fives and yelling all around at Keith's up coming visit to
Notre Dame!  Donna closed her eyes!  
UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE!!!!!! she thought.

	"Well it's time," Mr. Pularksi said, crushing his beer can and
	removing his wide leather belt.

	"I am sorry Precious, but it's gotta be done," he addressed
	his daughter.  The men and boys watched.....fascinated!!

		WHACK!........the belt crossed both her cheeks!
		The sting was horrible!  Like a hot iron!
		Her head snapped up and her mouth opened in
		a wordless shriek.


		WHACK!.......again the leather kissed the red
		cheeks.  She started to shake.....no......vibrate!!
		Shaking like someone possessed!

		WHACK!...............WHACK!..........WHACK!

	"AGGGGHHHH........YEOOOOOOOWWW!....her
	shriek ripped the room......the cords in her neck
	standing out.......her whole body a mass of shudders.

		WHACK!............the final blow hit home.

	"ack...........ack.......ack......" she tried to scream but
	     couldn't!   NEVER!  had she felt such a searing sting!

	"I'm sorry Darlin' " Mr. Pularski told her as he passed
	the belt back into the loops of his jeans, " I will listen
	to what you have to say after dinner......and it better
	be good." he added.

		"DINNER'S  READY!!!"  Mrs. Pularksi
				       shouted from upstairs.

	"OK!" Mister yelled back, "Precious, I'll be down
	after dinner," he addressed his daughter, and they
	all filed out of the room, big shoes stomping up
	the stairs.

Donna writhed in shame and agony.  Surely her bottom was on fire!
Ruined! forever!

Keith was the last to leave.  He went to Donna and raised her head
and looked into her tear filled eyes.

		"You are a very brave girl," he smiled and
					     kissed her hard on the
mouth!!

She fought at first, then in a second, kissed back!  They held it
for 10 seconds.  Then Keith left the room.

Donna gasped..........then breathed heavily.......alone in her misery.

She could hear them upstairs eating and talking......every word.  She
heard
 her Mother ask her Father if he would drive her to the store to exchange
  some shoes after supper...it would only take a minute, she added.

She heard her Father's agreement and his instructions to Michael.  "Tell
 Donna I'll deal with her after I come home from the store.  Meantime she
  stays like she is......she'll learn SOMETHING today."

There was no such thing as "a minute" with her Mom in a store...it would
 take hours!  She heard her parents leave the house........and the
giggling
  boys coming down the stairs!!!!!!!
