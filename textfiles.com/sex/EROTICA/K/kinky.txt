Sb: #Is He Just *TOO* Kinky?
Fm: * Cat * 70267,2177
To: ALL

To All:

Experimentation is a normal part of an
*ongoing* sexual relationshio.... BUT
...what do you do when *HE* wants to
try something and you sort of sit up
and think ......... "HE'S JUST TOOO
KINKY"!!

I think we have all had this happen at
some time or another.  What do we do?

a. NOT try it because you are
uncomfortable with it. b. DO IT even
though you are uneasy with it. c.
ESTABLISH some guidelines.

So.....what do *YOU* think???  If
guidelines, what should they be??? 
Let's hear *EVERYONES* input on this!!

What I generally do is try it, once. 
There have been a lot of things that
Jim has wanted to try, that I've felt
uneasy about, but have gone along with
it anyway.  Some were fun, some we just
laughed about and never tried again.  I
know that trying new things sexually is
not easy for many women, but I try very
hard to be accommodating--who knows
when i might find a new favorite thing
to do??

Marte:

I agree with the adage "try it you'll
like it", sometimes.... but must admit
in the past there have been things I
have tried and did not like it ......
Do you think there is a dividing line??

Well, I haven't liked everything we've
tried; neither has Jim.  If one of us
finds something not to our liking after
trying it, we say so, and that is that.
It hasn't caused any problems yet

I guess I don't have any answers to
this one..but I sure do have more
questions! How do you explain to your
man of the moment (or however long
you've had him around) that sometimes
you feel wildly inventive - want to try
all the new and unusual things he has
in mind - and at other times would only
like to have a prim everyday missionary
on top sort of experience. I find
myself being at different levels of
willingness at different times. The
rhythms in my marriage don't seem to
conincide very well. When I am a wanton
woman...he has no need for
experimentation. When I am on hold, so
to speak, he has just read the lastest
issue of Playboy. Sigh...how do you
solve this one? Dina hehe..that
is..Diane

I think it sounds like you have an
advantage over most couples in that you
can talk about it openly.  I think a
lot of relationships dont have this
ability!!

Have you ever had anything that you
were not able to talk about?

that unfortunately is really the
truth... have you ever tried making a
date ahead of time... say a week...and
then just both building up to it!! Some
people think making a "date" for sex in
marriage is wrong, but isnt that what
we did when we were single. I mean when
we were getting ready for a date, we
usually knew it would end up with
sex.... and the thinking ahead of time
about it was part of the fun!!!  Just
one suggestion..smile.

There have been, on occasion, things
that we have not talked about because
the potential for hurting the other
person was too high.  In most cases,
after sufficient time had passed, we
were able to discuss it.  But yes,
there are some things that we don't
talk about, mostly having to do with
fantasies and other "things of the
mind."

I don't know just what to say, because
he thinks some of my preferences are
*TOO* kinky. He goes along, but he
doesn't enjoy, so I seldom persuade. I
am going to try a new approach though:
shave an area that wants attention.
Maybe then he'll enjoy it too. If not,
C'est la vie. Get it somewhere else if
I must have it, I guess. Hugs

Funny.... if we are a cross section,
perhaps the title should have been "Am
I Too Kinky!!".

In the past (marriage) he really was
*too* kinky, but current relationship
luckily is equal.

But how do you handle "setting ground
rules or guidelines"?

to Fantasy Inn, what do you think
about the following:

l. Should deep fantasys be talked about
or just kept to ones self.

2. Do you think there is a difference
between what we would like to do and
what we would only like to fantazice
about.

What is kinky for one, may not be for
another.  So, I feel that establishing
some guidelines should be considered. 
By that I mean the couple should
discuss the matter in great detail, out
of the bedroom, and as matter-as-fact
as possible.  That way, each person's
feelings could be presented, without
having one of them soooo turned on,
that a arguement would  ensue. Nothing
worse than try to discuss a problem
with sex, while the other person is
breathing heavily <smile>.

Cat,   For me, it's really quite easy,
if he doesn't enjoy something, I get
eery little pleasure from it, so I
simply don't insist. Now and then I ply
him with a glass or two of wine (we're
cheap drunks) and then he doesn't seen
to mind, but much of the time I settle
for less in both what I want and how
much I want, and I know he gives a
little more than he really wants. If I
really need more or something he
doesn't like, I am free to get it
elsewhere, but I seldom use that
freedom. If it were him, rather than me
that had different needs, I would
probably draw the line a something that
could be physically painful or
damaging, but would indulge him
occasionally, unless it was something I
simply could not do, in which case, I
would let him get it elsewhere. He has
the same perogatives and freedoms, but
has indulged them even more rarely than
I have. We've simply adjusted.

We always discuss our fantasies, but
then I guess we are a bit strange, so
we do all sorts of things that don't
work for others. We never lie, or fail
to inform the other on more than
trivial matters (like surprizes). We
have a truly open marriage. I have
always felt equal to my husband (and
other men as well), and he has always
accepted that. We have NEVER seperated
the roles into male/female. Discussing
fantasies if fun, and often leads to
mutual satisfaction, as we decide to
try them out.
   As for the fantasies that we really
don't want to indulge, it is often
titillating to talk about them too.

Let me butt in here to say that I think
there are at least *some* guys here on
HSX that are doing things in compusex
that they would LOVE to do in real
life, but for whatever reason, they
can't do in real life. I sort of feel
sorry for them, and for all of us who
can only experience in fantasy what we
would love to experience for real!

Not all bark and no bite.....but mind

it lead to more adventuresome
things....after you give voice to
it????? Diane

I know that some men are....the ones
who are *heavily* married in real life
and see this as an opportunity to fool
around without guilt or "sin." They
build walls between the computer life
and real life to justify this behavior.
What puzzles me is, do they think the
people on the other end of the line are
not real?  Do they think that the
feelings they arouse are just
electronic figments of someone's
imagination?

Cat, like what for instance? I have
tried most of my realistic fantasies.
The only one I haven't tried has too
high a risk factor: I fantasise about
being loved by my husband, and his
younger brother simultaneousely, and
John and I both agree that even if it
were possible, we would not want to
take the chance of alienating his
brother. I don't really know if John
would mind, as his brother and he are
practically look-alikes, and there is a
great deal of love between them. In
fact, if I lost John, he would predict
(rightly) that I would set my cap for
his brother, who is divorced.
    Fantasies that we simply MUST
indulge, probably. As for the men on
here and compusex, I think it is indeed
another outlet.    Hugs    Karena

Cat, As I mentioned in the previous
note, sometimes indulgence carries too
high a risk, and sharing it is a good
substitute.     Hugs     Karena

Communication is probably a lot of the
key to the variance to what is
"c5
ortable" and what is not.

Funny how we can be so very open with
one person and yet so closed with
others.

Diane and All

your message really is an entire
subject in itself.  But do you wonder
if sometimes Fantasys just are better
off being left as fantasys.

Do you think that the *some* men on
here who would LOVE to experience the
things they do here in real life, would
be happier if they did???

Do you sometimes wonder if being on
here (cis) is sort of like having the
"interactive fantasy".

Sometimes I agree that the talking
about it is really part of the fun and
even though we might not *really* want
topo experience all that we talk about,
at least by opening the communication,
we can more fully express what we would
really like to do!
