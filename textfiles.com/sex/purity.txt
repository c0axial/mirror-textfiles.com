Disclaimer of Liability
 
	The user of this test acknowledges that sex is a hazardous sport; 
that a person must copulate in control, and use good judgment at all 
times; that partner's conditions vary constantly and are greatly affected by 
weather changes and previous use; and the dirty sheets, variations in 
terrain and bed surfaces, spouses/pimps/managers, forest growth, rocks and 
debris, clothed obstacles, and many other natural and man-made obstacles and
hazards, including other users and customers, exist throughout the bedroom 
area.  Personal managers(pimps/spouses) and sado-masochistic operations and 
equipment are constantly in use and may be hazardous to those not copulating
in control.  Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting in injury 
can happen at any time, even to those copulating in control with proper 
sexual equipment.  Inherent risks are part of the sport and may exist 
within your partner.  As a condition of being permitted to use the 
facilities of your partner, the user of this tests agrees to copulate in 
control and within the limits of his/her ability, and further acknowledges 
and accepts these hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes the risk of 
injury or loss to person or damage to property which might result from use 
of the partner's facilities.
 
	As a further condition of being permitted to use the facilities of 
your partners, the customer understands and further agrees that: (1) in the 
event of a transfer or use by another or anything else in the management's 
opinion is misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or nuisance, this service 
may be revoked without refund; (2) the partner is the property of the harem 
and, upon request, he/she must be presented to any authorized representative
of the pimp/spouse; (3) sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all 
times when you are in any bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate.
Your sexual partner is not transferable; see the Theft of Services, V.S.A., 
sections 2581 and 2582.

Purity Test Genesis/History
 
Version 1 (100) Created at MIT's Baker House. Two parallel versions: one 
		for male, and one for female.  Not much is known about this
		version.  It was sported to CMU by ps in 1982.
Version 2 (247) Spring 1983- CMU/jb, pd, kr, ps, ts, mt, et al. Expanded to 
		247 questions.  This marked the beginning of the unisex 
		versions.  The story goes that they intended it to be 250 
		questions, but got tired that night and said, "We'll think 
		of three more tomorrow," and tomorrow never got there.
Version 3.3c.1 (400) on 05-Dec-1984
		First formal release general of this test, version 3.xx. 
		All former versions were short-lived and tended to be 
		bug-ridden.  Does not discriminate against gays or bi's.  
		Good correspondence of scores (especially in the higher 
		school ranges) between this version and version 2. Added 
		Genesis/History section.
Version 3.4 (400) on 29-jan-1985
		Internal version; never released.  Source code accidentally 
		destroyed, much to the consternation of one of the authors. 
		Cleaned up many bugs.  Added sections: Disclaimer of 
		Liability, Instructions for Use, Scoring, and Warranty 
		Information.
Version 3.5 (400) on 10-Apr-1985
		Rebuilt from the 3.3c.1 source and the 3.4 (only surviving 
		copy) Xerox X9700 laser printer hardcopy. Cleaned up some 
		bugs in 3.4; wiped out a duplicate question. Added in 
		verbose history section.  
Version 3.5A (400) on 13-Apr-1985: CMU/da, fa, tc, no, dt, sv, rz, et al.
		Found that we had 431 questions instead of 400.
Version 3.5B (400) on 18-mar-1986: Yale (Pierson College)/as Intermediate 
		release, with footnotes integrated into main body of text 
		and some grammatical errors cleaned up.  Begun in Fall, 
		1985; finished in April for the benefit of a friend at MIT 
		(where it all began), who hadn't seen any versions except 
		the antique Version 1.
Version 3.5C (400) on 17-Jan-1988: Yale (Pierson College)/mmd 
		(CLARINAET@YALEVM)
		Grammatical errors corrected. Introduction and history added.   
Version 4.0 (500) on 23-Apr-1988: Yale (Stillman College)/dfc, ad, dcg, mlm,
		and Dartmouth (Alpha Theta)/alb. Original 400-question 
		version expanded to 500 questions. Transferred to LSC by 
		jlf and smc. Donated to jlp from pct.
Version 5.0 (576) date uncertain:  orst.edu/ pdh.  A late night remembrance 
		of an antiquated purity test.  
Version 5.1 (1000) on 14-May-1990:  orst.edu/ pdh.  The 576 expanded with
		1000 questions.  Some impossible-to-do questions. (the undead?)
		Made without any of the additions of any previous Purity Tests.
		First true omnisex version same for girls and guys.
Version 5.2 (1000) on 24-Aug-1992:  LSMSA (Louisiana School for Math, Science, 
		and the Arts)/"Gifties": Griffin, Phoenix, and Sickling.  A 
		rebuilding the PT1000 using the 1000 format and the 
		PT500 questions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions for Use:
 
	This is a very long test consisting of 1000 questions. It starts 
out tame and gets progressively worse (or better, depending on your 
viewpoint).  There are many ways of going about taking this test. You can, 
of course, as your right, guaranteed by the Constitution, be anti-social 
and sequester yourself in your room and take this test all by yourself; 
however, we feel that the funnest way to utilize is to hold a Purity /test 
Party. All you need is one copy of the test, and a bunch of friends.  (Lots 
of writing implements and paper would be useful too.)  The person with the 
copy of the test is the test administrator; he/she reads the questions out 
loud and everybody else writes down their answers.  We have no definite 
rules as to whether the participants are required to divulge their answers; 
that is up to the group to decide. However, each person's purity score 
should be made common knowledge.  (The person with the lowest score 
gets to be giggled at for the rest of his/her life.)  This works great at
parties and lets everyone know who's easy and who isn't, so you'll know 
who to go home with. Don't leave home without it.
 
Definitions:
	
	All questions in this test pertain to events that have happened to 
you subsequent to your weaning and babyhood/infancy.  Anything that may 
have happened before that time is considered not standing and void.
	Also, for the section of the test which involves animals, humans
(although they really are animals) do not count.
	The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating you 
AND/OR you masturbating someone else, not exclusively both at the same time.
	Necking is the kissing or stroking of a person's head or neck.
Petting is that plus the caressing or fondling of other portions of anatomy; 
through or underneath clothing.
	We would also like to define having sex in the homosexual case; 
homosexual sex has occurred when both partners are of the same sex and one 
partner has an orgasm while there is some contact between the genitals of 
both partners.
	We would now like to bring to your attention that there is no 
passing nor failing score.  Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much 
about getting a high score... even if you do get giggled at for the rest of 
your life.

I. Scoring
 
Congratulations! You are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper containing lots
of itty-bitty answers to the Purity Test. Sworn to excellence of workmanship, we
now give you directions on how to calculate your Purity score. There are several
methods; the calculator method works best.  Also there is the a la mainframe 
method.  (A DEC Station-5000 works great as a PC.) 
 
Scoring method:  Count "yes" answers.
		 Subtract that number from 1000.
		 Divide the result by 10.
		 The result is your percentage purity.
 
The higher the number, the more pure you are; in the same vein, the lower 
the score, the more of a sleaze bag you are.
 
For your reference, we include calculator directions:
	For people with real calculators  (HP):
		   (# of NO answers)  [ENTER] 10 /
	For people with other (dinky) calculators:
		   (# of NO answers) / 10=
