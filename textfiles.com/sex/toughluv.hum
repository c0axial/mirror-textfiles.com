think you'll find it relevant even if you are High School age or younger,
because dating and relationships are a hot subject for every age group.

INTRODUCTION

Some marriage-minded singles will try anything to snare a spouse.  Groveling
for the affection of reluctant sweethearts, such suitors refuse to take "no"
for an answer.	Their persistence may not be a sign of undying devotion; rather
it may reveal inhibiting insecurity or low self-esteem.

On the following pages, Dr.  James Dobson offers 16 suggestions to help singles
build satisfying romances based on self-confidence and mutual respect.	In
addition, he stresses that "a bad marriage is far worse than the most lonely
instance of singleness."

TOUGH LOVE FOR SINGLES

The idea of "loving toughness" is of great relevance to single adults,
especially those who desire to be married.  Some individuals become so highly
motivated to find a mate that they begin to violate the laws of freedom and
respect in romantic relationships.  That is like turning a fire hose on a
flickering flame.  All that remains is black smoke and ashes.

I heard of one young man who was determined to win the affection of a girl who
refused to even see him.  He decided that the way to her heart was through the
mail, so he began writing her a love letter every day.	When she did not
respond, he increased his output to three notes every 24 hours.  In all, he
wrote her more than 700 letters -- and she married the postman.

That is the way the system works.  Romantic love is one of those rare human
endeavors that succeeds best when it requires the least effort.  Those who work
the hardest at it are the most likely to fail.	And speaking of people who try
harder, no one beats a determined young man named Keith Ruff, whose story was
told in the Los Angeles Times, Feb.  21, 1982.	The headline read:

"MAN SPENDS $20,000 TRYING TO WIN HAND OF GIRL WHO CAN SAY NO."

A love struck man holed up in a $200-a-day Washington hotel has spent, at
latest estimate, close to $20,000 demonstrating that he won't take "no" for an
answer to his marriage proposal.

On bended knee on Christmas Day, 35 year old Keith Ruff, once a stockbroker in
Beverly Hills, proposed marriage to 20 year old Karine Bolstein, a cocktail
waitress at a Washington restaurant.  He met her in a shoe store last summer.
The pair had gone out a few times over a two month period before the proposal.

To his proposal, she looked down and said "No."

Since then, Ruff has remained in Washington and demonstrated his that she
reconsider by sending her everything but a partridge in a pear tree.

That may be next.

He is, he thinks, "close to spending all of my money.  I'm not an Arab sheik."

The tokens of his affection include a Learjet, placed on standby at the
airport, "in case she wanted to ride around"; between 3,000 and 5,000 flowers;
a limousine equipped with a bar and television, parked outsider her door; a
gold ring; $200 worth of champagne; catered lobster dinners; musicians to
serenade her; a clown to amuse her younger brother; a man dressed as Prince
Charming bearing a glass slipper; cookies, candy, and perfume; and sandwich
sign wearers walking around her home and the restaurant where Bolstein works,
conveying the message "Mr Dennis Keith Ruff LOVES Ms.  Karine Bolstein."

Ruff gave her father a basket of nuts and $300 worth of cigars "to pass out to
his friends at the Labor Department.  It may sound goofy, but I like him."

He also had flowers delivered to his beloved's mother, who works at the French
Embassy.  "I don't think her mother likes me.  She called the police, but I'll
keep sending gifts to her also.  How could anyone be so mad?"

Ruff says he has not worked in some time, describing himself as being of
independent means.  He said he will spend his last dime and will beg for money
if he has to, that he will "keep on trying for 10 years, 20 years.  I'll ask
her to marry me 50,000 times.  It doesn't matter how many times she says no.  I
will do everything in my power that's not absurd or against a reasonable law.
I wouldn't stop if she became a nun.  I've never felt this way before!"

Bolstein, meanwhile, said she is flattered, but too young to get married.  She
also said the house looks like a funeral parlor.

Ruff said, "I don't want to force her to love me, but I can't stop."

Ruff said he spends a lot of time in his hotel room planning what to do next
and occasionally crying.  He said Bolstein called him once.  "But I hung up on
her.  I didn't like what she said."

Reality to me is disturbing," he said.  "I'd rather close my eyes and see her
face.  I'm living with hope.  And some very big bills."

There are several things ol' Ruff needs to know about women, assuming Miss
Bolstein hasn't gotten the message across by now.  He could cry in his hotel
room for the next 50 years without generating the least bit of sympathy from
her.  Very few women are attracted to sniveling men who make donkeys of
themselves in view of the whole world.	Who wants to marry an unambitious
weirdo who grovels in the dirt like a whipped puppy?  Good-bye, romance!
Hello, poorhouse.

On a much smaller scale, of course, the same mistake is made by singles in
other places.  They reveal their hopes and dreams too early in the game and
scare the socks off potential lovers.  Divorcees often fall into this trap --
especially single women who need a man to support them and their children.
Male candidates for that assignment are rarities and are sometimes recruited
like All-American athletes.  I've seen no better illustration than the
following item, also appearing in the Los Angeles Times.  It was submitted to
Virginia Klein for use in her column "Living With Divorce":

Q.: I am a recently divorced, professional man with an unusual problem.  I
hope you can help me.  A woman I dated once called me before I even had a
chance to make a second date with her and wanted to know why I hadn't called
her again.  After our second date she began to call almost daily with offers
for dinner, something funny she'd read and thought I'd enjoy, etc.  The crazy
part is that this same routine has just started with another woman I'm just
beginning to ask out.  If such behavior is typical, maybe I should have stayed
married!  How do I extricate myself from this frenzied dating and have a nice,
quiet social life?

Isn't it obvious what is occurring here?  The women being dated by this
"professional man" are chasing him around like a hound after a rabbit.  And
predictably, his natural impulse is to run.  If they are interested in pulling
him toward them, they simply must not invade his territory.  Instead, they
should maintain a sense of decorum in their responses to him.

TIPS FOR LOVING TOUGH

Let me be very specific with those of you who are single but wish not to be.
(No insult is intended to those who are single by design and wish to remain
unmarried.  That is a legitimate choice that should be respected by friends
and family alike.)  I have listed 16 suggestions that will help you conform to
the principles of loving toughness in matters of the heart.

1.  DON'T LET THE RELATIONSHIP MOVE TOO FAST IN ITS INFANCY.  The phrase "too
hot not to cool down" has validity.  Take it one step at a time.

2.  DON'T DISCUSS YOUR PERSONAL INADEQUACIES AND FLAWS in great detail when
the relationship is new.  No matter how warm and accepting your friend may be,
any great revelation of low self-esteem or embarrassing weaknesses can be
fatal when interpersonal "valleys" occur.  And they will occur.

3.  REMEMBER THAT RESPECT PRECEDES LOVE.  Build it stone upon stone.

4.  DON'T CALL TOO OFTEN ON THE PHONE or give the other person an opportunity
to get tired of you.

5.  DON'T BE TOO QUICK TO REVEAL YOUR DESIRE TO GET MARRIED [or desire for a
long term affair for you High Schoolers] -- or that you think you've just
found Mr. Wonderful or Miss Marvelous.	If your partner has not arrived at the
same conclusion, you'll throw him or her into panic.

6.  MOST IMPORTANT: RELATIONSHIPS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING "TESTED" by cautious
lovers who like to nibble at the bait before swallowing the hook.  This
testing usually involves pulling backward from the other person to see what
will happen.  Perhaps a foolish fight is initiated.  Maybe two weeks will pass
without a phone call.  Or sometimes flirtation occurs with a rival.  In each
instance, the question being asked is, "How important am I to you and what
would you do if you lost me?"  An even more basic issue lies below that one.
It wants to know, "How free am I to leave if I want to?"  It is incredibly
important in these instances to appear poised, secure and equally independent.
Do not grasp the other person and beg for mercy.  Some people remain single
throughout life because they cannot resist the temptation to grovel when the
test occurs.

7.  EXTENDING THE SAME CONCEPT, keep in mind that virtually every dating
relationship that continues for a year or more and seems to be moving toward
marriage will be given the ultimate test.  A breakup will occur, motivated by
one of the lovers.  The rejected individual should know that their future
together depends on the skill with which he/she handles that crisis.  If the
hurting individual can remain calm, the next two steps may be reconciliation
and marriage.  If not, then no amount of pleading will change anything.

8.  DO NOT EXPECT ANYONE TO MEET ALL YOUR EMOTIONAL NEEDS.  Maintain interests
and activities outside the romantic relationship, even after marriage.

9.  GUARD AGAINST SELFISHNESS IN YOU LOVE AFFAIR.  Neither the man nor the
woman should do all the giving.  I once broke up with a girl because she let
me take her to nice places, bring her flowers, buy her lunch, etc.  I wanted
to do these things, but expected her to reciprocate in some way.  She didn't.

10.  BEWARE OF BLINDNESS TO OBVIOUS WARNING SIGNS that tell you that your
potential husband or wife is basically disloyal, hateful, spiritually
uncommitted hooked on drugs or alcohol, given to selfishness, etc.  BELIEVE
ME, A BAD MARRIAGE IS FAR WORSE THAN THE MOST LONELY INSTANCE OF SINGLENESS.

11.  DON'T MARRY THE PERSON YOU THINK YOU CAN LIVE WITH;  marry only the
individual you can't live without.

12.  BE CAREFUL TO DEFEND THE "LINE OF RESPECT" even during a dating
relationship.  A man should open doors for a woman on a formal evening.  A
woman should speak respectfully of her escort when in public, etc.  If you
don't preserve this delicate line when the foundations of marriage are being
laid, it will be virtually impossible to construct them later.

13.  DO NOT EQUATE HUMAN WORTH WITH FLAWLESS BEAUTY OR HANDSOMENESS!  If you
require physical perfection in your mate, he or she may make the same demands
of you.  Don't let love escape you because of the false values of your
culture.  In the same vein, be careful not to compare yourself with others --
which is the root of all inferiority.

14.  IF GENUINE LOVE HAS ESCAPED YOU THUS FAR, DON'T BEGIN BELIEVING "NO ONE
WOULD EVER WANT ME."  That is a deadly trap that can destroy you emotionally!
Millions of people are looking for someone to love.  The problem is finding
one another!

15.  REGARDLESS OF HOW BRILLIANT THE LOVE AFFAIR HAS BEEN, TAKE TIME TO "CHECK
YOUR ASSUMPTIONS" with your partner before committing yourself to marriage.
It is surprising how often man and women plunge into matrimony without ever
becoming aware of major differences in expectation between them.  For example:
a. Do you want to have children?  How many?
b. Where will you live?
c. Will the wife work?	How soon?  How about after the children are born?
d. Who will lead in the relationship?  What does that really mean?
e. How will you relate to your in-laws?
f. How will the money be spent?
g. Will you attend church?  Which one?
These and other "assumptions" should be discussed item by item, perhaps with
the help of a premarital counselor.  Many future struggles can be avoided by
coming to terms with potential areas of disagreement.  If the differences are
great enough, it is even possible that the marriage should never occur.

16.  FINALLY, SEXUAL FAMILIARITY CAN BE DEADLY TO A RELATIONSHIP.  In addition
to the many moral, spiritual, and physical reasons for abstaining from sexual
relations until marriage, there are numerous psychological and interpersonal
advantages to the exercise of self-control and discipline.  Though it's an
old-fashioned notion, perhaps, it is still true that men do not respect "easy"
women and often become bored with those who have held nothing in reserve.
Likewise, women often disrespect men who have only one thing on their minds.
Both sexes need to remember how to use a very ancient word.  Its pronounced
"No!"

These 16 suggestions are not guaranteed to win the hand of a lover, of course,
but they will certainly beat the approach of Mr. Keith Ruff.  And you'll save
$20,000 in the process!

[Okay, so maybe it is more aimed at post High School aged people.  I still
think these concepts are very helpful for HS'ers attempting to have a serious
relationship with a girl or guy.... -Servant-]
