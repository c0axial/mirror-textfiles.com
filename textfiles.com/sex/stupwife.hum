I haven't written any files in a few months now, so I guess I should get back
into this.  I have realized that all the files I have written are impractical,
and you could never do that unless you really believed you were the hakk master
or something.  So in this file I will just tell you an easy way to scam cards
out of housewives and various types of retards.

Ok.  Cut school one day and just stay home.  Dig through the phone book and
call anyone, let's say, ohh i don't know, uh, CHRIS SHERWIN maybe?  Ok.  Call
his house, if his mom doesn't answer call someone else, she might be a working
bitch.	If she answers, do this:

YOU: Is this the residence of Mr. XXXXXX?
THEM: Why, yes it is.
YOU: This is TRW computer filing systems.  A recent mixup with our datafiles
     has somehow made us lose your credit history reports.  We need some
     information.
THEM: Ok.  (sometimes they don't believe you, call someone else then.)
YOU: Social Security number? (this sets the stage for the bigger shit)
THEM: 742247657438, etc.
YOU: What type of major credit card do you use? VISA/MC/AMEX,etc.?
THEM: Mastercard.
YOU: Please read it off starting with expiration date (makes it sound good).
THEM: 11/88, 5432-3557-0006-2404.
YOU: You will be recieving a complete explaination in the mail.  Thank you.

Now.  Any fool knows that TRW does not contain credit cards, so get a computer
goober/tard who doesn't know anything, or doesn't care.

In short, just call the bitch and say you are someone important from some 3
letter company and ask for her cards.  I know that the usual bitch won't give
them to you and will ask for your number to call you back, so you might want to
goto a telephone booth and wait for the call.  Surf Monster and I tried it on
10 people and about 6 did not give us anything.  But make it sound good, people
are stupid, they will believe anything if you sound official.
