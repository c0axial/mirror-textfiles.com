        It was a lazy Saturday afternoon.  Here I was leisurely browsing
through our library database on psychological abstracts. Whittling away the
time until a good TV show came on. When suddenly, out of nowhere, the
following
alphabetical listing showed up.

Sexual Harassment
Sexual Intercourse Human
Sexual Masochism
Sexual Reproduction
Sexual Sadism
Sexual Satisfaction
Sexuality
Shamanism
Shame
Sharing Social Behavior
Sheep

For some reason the sequence seems more than just an alphabetical list. Isn't
this also the life cycle of an adult human male?
