and seasonings and mix well.  Put half of stuffing into each heart and sew
shut.  Dust hearts with flour, sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Melt shortening

remaining ingredients, Cook, covered, very slowly for about 1 1/2 hours.  When

heart falls open in zigzag shape.  Serve with pan juices.

COCK-Y CROQUETTES

1 raw egg, lightly beaten
1 medium onion, shopped fine
bread crumbs
2 T butter

  Put ham through meat grinder, or chop coarsely in food processor.  Boil
potatoes in their skins.  When potatoes are done, mash them (leaving skins on)
and add egg, mixing thoroughly.  Add chopped ham and onion and mix well.  Shape
croquettes in either male or female parts, or both.  Carefully roll each "part"
in bread crumbs; it may be necessary to pat them back into shape afterward.
Melt the butter in frying pan till hot.  Carefully put croquettes in hot butter
in separate pieces.....  fry each separately.  Turn once or twice carefully and
cook till brown.  When done, put them on heated platter, putting proper or
improper parts together.  In fact, you can put them so much together that your
guest will hate to take them apart.  And that's VERY Cock-y Croquettes!
