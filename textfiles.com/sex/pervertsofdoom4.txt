     About a month ago, I went for a walk at my college.  As I walked along, I
suddenly felt an urge to take a shit.  So go I did-straight to the campus where
I might be seen should an "accident" happen!  Pretty soon, I saw a couple of
girlies sitting on a campus bench and the pressure in my bowels was tremendous
by then.  So, as I approached them, I relaxed my sphincter muscles and felt the
ecstatic sensation of a large volume of soft, warm mess filling the seat and
crotch of my underwear.  I had really filled my pants and after passing the
girls, I heard one of them say, "Look!  He's messed in his pants!"

     After a few more steps, i looked over my shoulder and both of them were
staring with open mouths.  I smiled, winked and continued my delightful,
squishy stroll.  I got back to my car and got in.  Oh!  What a feeling!

Yeah, we're back.  POD! in full effect, '91.  Bringing you nothing but the
coolest real-life sex-text ever.  And don't you forget it.
