     Welcume to the Gourmet sex guide. This guide will help you becume
   a gourmet in the wide wonderful world of sex.  First of all gourmet
   sex does not start in the kicten {it may end up there in time} but
   it starts with you.  Always remeber to have safe sex so if you are
   ready to start put your rubbers on and contuine on.


   There will be two parts to this first chapter:

                                          #1-Defintions of body parts.
                                          #2)<ercises for your parts.


   Part 1 Defintions:

      The Ear: This is used for many other things besides listening.
  This orifice can be used for stimulation.  This can be done by blowing
  in the ear or by the use of the tongue. {see next defintion for other
  uses and where the tongue can be found}
     Some girls like to have there ears explored or {ear fucked} by
  a tonuge.  Simply move the tonuge in and out of the ear: Caution-
  excessive nosie such as yelling is not allowable nor is excessive
  slobbing in the ear- this can cause Ear Infections and is very hard
  to cure.

     The Tongue: This is the fleshy part that hangs around in your mouth.
  It has many uses such as sticking it out at your mom or other authoritative
  figures.  Other uses are licking {and with the mouth } sucking.
     This tool can be used to explore the entirer body in your search
  for sensitive areas.

     The Vagina: This has many names-The Tunnel of Love, The Cave, Love
  Canal, Fuck Box, Hot Dog Bun, Juice Sluice, Hot Oven, etc.etc.etc.
     The vagina is the entrance to the Uterus {this wholle thing is
  located between a girls legs, this information is for the lamers out
  there}  The Uterus is where babys are conceved if not carefull {if
  anyone who is reading this did not know this PLEASE stop here..there
  is no reason for you to contune on...please see your mom or sex ed.
  teacher for the Birds and the Bee theory}
     This is the place where all guys wish to enter someday..but please
  remeber that before you enter that the following condistions are met.
     Your area must be clean and washed..covered with a rubber {that
  definition will follow} and that the area is well lubricanted.
  { you do not lubricate it with motor oil nor cooking oil-exception is
  crisco}  Lubricantion can be done by stimulation of other body part
  incudling the Clitoris.

    The Clitoris: Is the female version of the male penis.  It becomes
  hard and erect and may turn colors. {CAUTION: If it turns black she
  is ether dead or you have a black girl there, ether way do not panic
  just check to make sure she is breathing-if not please see section on
  necrophilla}  This is located just above the entance to the vagina.
  {For more information see chapter on Techniques}

     The Penis: This is the fleshy part of skin which hang from the body
  of the male.  It become erect when stroked and turns colors also.
  This part of the Bo0y offen has a mind of it's own, sometimes it 
  becumes hard to tell which brain of the male species is in control, the
  large brain located in the seat of his pants or the one in the tip of
  his cock. 
    The penis cums in four size: Small, Medium, Large and OH MY GOD!!!!
  Most wonmen prefer the medium and up sizes...but small has it's uses
  to.  Remeber it's not the meat--it's the motion!!!!


    The Breasts:  These are large globule mammarry glands which hangs 
  from the upper half of the female body.  Most men have a mother complex
  and can not think of anything else.  Tits are overrated, they too
  come in four sizes: Small, Medium, Large and the type you need a wheel
  barrow to carry them around in.  Just remember that more than a mouth
  full is a waste.  Also these are very sensitive area that can be sucked
  on {incudling the nipple} or held and rubbed.  


    The Mouth:  This is area is used for kissing and other things such
  as eating, making loud nosies, chewing, sucking, and making faces.
    There are two types of kissing you can do with the mouth such as
  french kissing {this uses the tougne see that area for more help}
  and the regular kissing with mouth closed.  Ether one is good and
  should at ways be used to start other things going.  A kiss is the
  start of something good, and a kiss can tell you alot about how other
  things might flow. {see other sections to cumm for further infor.}

   #2--Exercise


     Exercise for your penis:
        
      Many of you might have heard of the G-Spot.  This is located in
  in the vagina and you can help stimulate it with the following penis
  exercise. 
     First lock the door {don't want your mom or anyone else seeing you
  do this, they may think that you are sick and demended person}
  Next get a good hard on {you can think of a way} then place a light 
  piece of paper across it {tissue paper is best for first timers}
  now lift you cock up and point the tip of it to the roof. 
    Now repeat this process ten times and rest.  Do 3 repertitions a day.
  On the third day increase the weight and repeat the process.  Keep
  increasing the weight untill you can lift a wet bath towel with ease.
   You will now process a super cock, able to lift any woman in to climax
  with ease.
