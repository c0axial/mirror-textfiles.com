
     Why Must Girls Squat To Pee?
     ----------------------------


            |QUESTION:|
  I'm  an 18-year-old guy. Some of my friends and I are confused as  to
why a female must squat or sit before she can pee.
  Is  it  because  she has the equivalent of an extremely  tiny  penis,
normally hidden from view, which only pops out when she squats?


             |ANSWER:|
  A  woman needn't squat or sit to urinate.  She can also urinate in  a
standing  position  (or in any other position, for that  matter).  But,
since she can't control the direction of the flow of urine, this is apt
to be a messy business.

   Females urinate from the urethral opening, a very small hole located
between  the  clitoris and the vaginal opening, and surrounded  by  the
vaginal lips called the labia majora.
 
    Clitoris Is Like Small Penis
 
   When  you ask about whether the female has the equivalent of a small
penis, you may be thinking of the clitoris. Actually, in terms of fetal
development, the penis is more like an enlarged clitoris.
 
  The clitoris is a small knob of tissue located above the urethra.  In
the  embryo, a group of specialized cells becomes the clitoris.  If the
fetus is male, the same tissue develops to become part of a penis.

   Unlike  the  penis, the clitoris has only one known purpose -- as  a
focus  of  erotic sensitivity in women.  The clitoris is  much  smaller
than the penis, but has an equal number of sensory nerve endings. Hence
it is potentially far more sensitive than the penis.

   Structurally,  the  clitoris  is like a penis in miniature,  with  a
shaft, a glans, and a hood.
