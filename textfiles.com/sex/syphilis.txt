                                   SYPHILIS

        Syphilis is caused by a corkscrew-shaped germ called treponema
    pallidum. In most cases, the germs enter the body through breaks in
    the moist surfaces of the sex organs or other areas.

        Syphilis occurs in four main stages: 1-> primary, 2-> secondary,
    3-> latent, and 4-> late. The symptoms of primary syphilis develop
    about three weeks after infection. A small sore called a chancre
    appears in the area where the germs entered the body. The infected
    person may not notice the chancre, which disappears in a few weeks.
    Secondary syphilis occurs 6 weeks to 6 months later. At that time, the
    victim may feel ill and develop a rash and fever. The rash may be
    unnoticed, and all the symptoms disappear within several weeks.

        There are no symptoms during the latent stage, and a blood test is
    then the only way of finding the disease. If the condition is not
    treated, late syphilis will occur within 10 to 30 years. During late
    syphilis, the bacteria may attack the brain, heart, skin, spinal cord,
    or other party of the body. At this stage, the disease can cause
    blindness, deafness, heart disease, insanity, or paralysis.

        A pregnant woman who has syphilis but is not treated can and most
    likely will pass it to her unborn child. The woman may have a
    miscarriage, or the infant may die upon birth. If the baby lives, it
    may be born with the disease.

        If syphilis is treated during the first three stages, it can be
    cured easily with penicillin or other antibiotics. During the late
    stage, treatment can prevent the disease from becoming worse, but
    probably cannot cure it.
