                               Element   : Woman
                               Symbol    : WO
                               Discoverer: Adam


Quantitative Analysis: Accepted at 36-28-36, though isotopes ranging from
                       25-10-20 to 60-55-60 have been identified.

Occurance: Found wherever man is, but seldom in the highly reactive, energetic
           singlet state.  Surplus quantities found in all urban areas.

Physical Properties: Undergoes spontaneous dehydrolysis (weeps) at absolutely
                     nothing, and freezes at a moments notice.  Totally
                     unpredictable.  Melts when properly treated, very bitter
                     if not well used. Found in various states, ranging from
                     virgin metal to common ore. Non-magnetic, but can be
                     attracted by coins and sport cars.  In its natural shape
                     the specimen  varies considerably, but it is often changed
                     artificially so well that the change is indiscernible
                     except to the experienced eye.
 
Chemical Properties: Has a great affinity for AU, AG, and C (in the crystalline
                     form.)  May give violent reaction if left alone.  Will
                     absorb great amounts of food matter.  Highly desired
                     reaction is initiated with various reagents (such as
                     C(2)-H(5)-OH and sexy aftershave lotions.)  An essential
                     catalyst is often required (must say you love her at least
                     five times daily). Reaction accelerates out of control
                     when in the dark and all reaction conditions are suitable.
                     Extremely difficult to react if in the highly stable pure
                     form.  Yields to pressure applied to correct points.  The
                     reaction is highly exothermic.
 
Storage: Best results are obtained between the ages of 18 and 28 years.  A
         short time after this, specimens begin to deteriorate, sometimes
         rapidly.
 
Uses: Highly ornamental.  Used as a tonic for low spirits.  Used on lonely
      nights as a heating agent (if properly prepared.)  May be trained to cook
      food, although great care must be exercised.
 
Tests: Pure specimens turn rosy tint if discovered in raw, natural state.
       Turns green if placed besides a better specimen.  Turns blue if proper
       reaction conditions are not met.  Often shows signs of illogical
       behavior patterns.
 
Caution: Most powerful reducing agent known to man (income and ego).  Highly
         explosive in inexperienced hands.  Specimen must be used with great
         care if experiments are to succeed.  Some of this species have been
         known to cause confused thinking and varying levels of insanity.
 
Note: It is illegal to possess more than one permanent specimen, however, a
      certain amount of exchange is permitted.
