      Apologies
      ~~~~~~~~~ 
      We apologise to all users of this test for the appalling use 
      of Michael J. Fox's pituitary gland.  It is quite untrue that one 
      night while he was sleeping we snuck into his room, put him under 
      anesthesia, opened him up, and actually weighed it.  All rumours 
      that it was .365 pounds are totally false.  Apologies are 
      extended to Barry Manilow for using him as weight 
      standards.  But think about it this way, someday, millions of 
      years in the future someone will be saying, yeah, I only weigh 
      one and a half Manilows (Okay, it IS a pretty scary thought).  
      We must of course apologise to Malta for laughing that it was 
      even a real country.  So sorry.  Apologies to all those who 
      didn't get their nut in the last nut question, it should be in 
      there now.  Especial apologies to Kim Morris who's filbert nut 
      has been sitting around waiting to be added for quite a while.  
      Finally, apologies to the Welsh for laughing at their country 
      too and to anyone else we may have offended either on purpose 
      or by accident.
       
      Thanks & Acknowledgements
