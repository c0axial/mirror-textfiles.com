                          SCORING

The following are some suggested  varients:

Imaginary Score = Number of things that you have not done but have
                  wanted to do at one time or another.

McCorquodale Number = Purity - Imaginary Score = number of things you
                      haven't done and haven't ever wanted to.
                      McCorquodale has a Mc Corquodale number of zero.

Simay Quotient = 100 X (Imaginary Score/Number of yes answers)
