Subject: Interesting positions I have discovered
Contact: reg3

Good evening.

	Recently, whilst engaged in--well, let's be perfectly frank,
this is an open forum after all--intercourse with my wife, i
discovered an amazing new position, in which the female partner
occupies what might be called the "dominant" or "top" position, rather
than the more proper bottom position.  We were curious as to whether
anyone else has tried this revolutionary concept.  We're rather afraid
to admit it in public, since I think it falls outside of the bounds of
general decency and propriety...but, as the common people say, life is
too short not to "live it up" a little, eh what?

	ive never told anyone else about this before, but i thought
you all might like to hear about it.  it all started one night when i
was studying for a physics test all alone in a classroom and this girl
walked in and sat down and started studying.  i couldn't help but
notice her most prominent features.  i had a hard time concentrating
on my textbook.  all i could think about was introducing myself to
her.  i imagined myself walking up to her--actually walking up to a
real woman--and GREETING her.  i reached down and started idly playing
with my calculator as i fantasized.  i thought of asking her out for
frozen yogurt.  i thought of "accidentally" brushing against her round,
soft hands.  i couldn't stand it.  i had to do it.  but then she got
up and left.

Hey I dont know about all you guys but I get really aroused whenever a girl
says "Have a nice day" to me.  Is this weird?  Should I go see a shrink?
The short women in "Willow" really turn me on to.

Dear Prudes and Virgins Digest,

This is ever so awkward, but i was wondering what your readers would
consider to be...ummm....attractive... in the way of nightwear.  Do the
readers prefer cotton, flannel or rayon full lenghth nightgowns?  Is there
a tendency towards prints or solids?  Fitted or roomy? 
This is truly a burning question on my mind, as just the other evening as
my husband Percy and I were each reading various exerpts from Better Homes
and Gardens Do-It Yourself Guide to Home Remodeling and Percy commented
that perhaps to lend excitement to our marriage in much the same way our
new storm windows add pizazz to our living room I should invest in some new
nightwear. I hope your readers can assist me in my shopping endeavors.

Subject: Wild fantasies
Contact: hrb

	Dear P and V Digest
	Just the other day I engaged in the most unbelievable 
	fantasy :^). I needed to study for my Chaucer exam and 
	ducked into what I'd hoped to be an unused classroom. 
	Well, this was the furthest from the truth.  There was a 
	young man in this room, but I was feeling a bit, shall we
	say devil-may-care, and i brought my books in and sat in a desk
	about two or three rows over from the young man. He was 
	quite attactive, what with his neatly manicured hands and
	crisply shaved sideburns, and his shirt was neatly pressed 
	as well.  I very much wanted him to approach me, and to
	offer me a refreshment of some sort.  We could discuss 
	literature or this season's choice of music here with the 
	University Symphony or perhaps the social happening next week 
	at the Christian Center.  My thoughts ranged even further into
	the future, about how, if we were married, we could have wild,
	frenzied family picnics.
	His shoes were neatly buffed, and he was reading what appeared
	to be some scientific manual or text, and he must have
	been an intelligent and well-mannered young man, and he would
	been an excellent conversationalist, and, well, just thinking 
	of him *talking* to me got me so....ruffled.... i just had to
	go get a lemonade from the Cafeteria and I left quickly
	even before I could review my most recent notes.

	in my school read News and I wouldn't want them to get the wrong
	impression of me.
