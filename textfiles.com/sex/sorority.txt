     Here it is, by psuedo-popular demand, the one and only, true to life,
TRUE COMPLETE VERSION OF SORORITY GIRL JOKES.  This includes jokes from
previous Canonicals on rec.humor, as well as from other sources.  I have
formatted it as Question indented, Answer isn't.  Maybe is isn't the best
format, but it's a lot easier than having to type a few hundred q's and a's.
Also, there may be a few listed twice.  I've had this archived for a while,
and haven't had time to look through it.  If you find any doubles, or know
any that aren't on here, post them, and I'll be sure to add them.  Enjoy!
