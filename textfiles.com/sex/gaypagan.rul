All:
        Welcome to the new Gay & Lesbian Pagans Echo!
        This echo has been designed by myself to fill a gap that I have
noticed in the Pagan community.  Through my contacts in the Pagan community I
have noticed that there is a high population of Gay & Lesbian Pagans.  They
sometimes are looked on as equals, where at other times they are accepted as
a group, but aren't favourable for Wiccan practise.  This I have noticed
comes mostly from those Trads that believe very strongly in a Polarity
principle that doesn't include Homosexuals.
        This board is to help educate the public and the community about the
Homosexual Pagan community, our differences in ritual working, magick
systems, etc.
        All are allowed here, and are most welcome here but we have a few
fundamental rules that must be respected for a genuinely friendly atmosphere
to exist, and they are:
                   RULES FOR THE GAY & LESBIAN PAGANS ECHO
1)        The Wiccan Rede is respected here and it goes:
                "An it harm none, Do what thou wilt"
          In translation; as long as your actions or messages do not harm or
offend another member of this Echo, you may discuss any topic provided it
agrees with Rule 3.
2)        Flames, prejudice remarks, slander, vicious rumours, and the
"Outing" of an alias member are NOT to be tolorated here.  We believe very
strongly that all members have the right to there own religion and lifestyle,
thus prejudices of such will not be tolerated.
        a) The highest offence in this echo that can be commited is the
"Outing" of one of its members.  "Outing" is the willing exposure of the true
identity of a Gay or Lesbian with connection to their life style, wether this
lifestyle is accepted by yourself or not.  Abuse of this rule will not result
in a warning as the others do, but will result in the immediate
recommendation to your Sysop for your expulsion from this Echo.  "Outing", in
my experience, has been known to get people fired, cut off from family,
custody battles for children, physical abuse, and sadly deaths.
                Our policy on "Outing" is a NO TOLERANCE POLICY!
3)        Please try your best to stay on topic here.  The main stay topic is
the discussion of the conflicts and differences between Gay and Lesbian
Magick systems and Wiccan Traditions, and the eduation of the general public
and the Pagan community as to the Gay & Lesbian lifestyle, so that prejudices
may be finally eliminated.  There are plenty of Gay & Lesbian general chat
boards out there, so I would appreciate if the generic chatting of non-Pagan
related topics is kept to a minimum.  Meet the person, then take it into
private mail please.
        A little about myself; My name is Sewna Silvara, and I am a Bi-Sexual
Wiccan.  I have been in Craft for approxamately 3.5 - 4 yrs and have studied
Runology for close to 10 years.  I am currently a Priest in a Celtic
Tradition that I have developed with the assistance of my Teacher and
Magickal Partner, called; Triskelion, and I am the Sysop of the Triskelion
Temple where this echo originates from.
        I really hope this board gets going, ard attracts many users in the
future.  Only you can make it work.  Please if you have any suggestions for
this area, or comments on the above, I would very much like to hear them.
