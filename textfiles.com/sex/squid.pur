It's a party game, it's a hearty salad, it's birdcage lining, it's .....

            ===================================================
            The Official, Sanctioned DoD Squid Purity Test(tm).
            ===================================================

All questions are asked in the context of a street motorcycle ridden on public
highways, unless otherwise noted.


Scoring:  The number in parenthesis after each question is the number of
          points you must add to your cumulative total if your answer to
          the particular question is "yes".  Some questions have special
          instructions.

          On the multiple choice questions, points are as follows
             [a] -1 point
             [b] +2 points
             [c] +4 points
             [d] +7 points
             [e] +10 points


          When you are done, add your points up and divide by 33.96
          This will give you your "squid percentage".


Enjoy.
