                        Abstract

The surgical management of two patients presenting with
incarcerated, apparently self-inserted foreign bodies is
reported.  The large volume of prior literature on this subject is
reviewed, with a tabluation of 182 previous cases by type and
number of objects recovered and with a discussion of patients'
age distribution, history, complications, and prognosis.
Management problems addressed include history, differential
diagnosiss of reported pruitis ani, and handling of suspected
assault.


                        Case 1.
A 39-year-old married white male lawyer presented with a
self-inserted perfume bottle in his rectum that he was unable to
remove using various objects, including a back scratcher.  He had
inserted this bottle on previous occasions.  Edema of the rectum
and sigmoid colon precluded the successful manual removal of the
object in the emergency room. ... The 3 by 17 cm object, "Impulse
Body Spray," was removed manually after a spinal anesthetic.
