------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Francisco -  The best places in the city do not serve
alcohol. They are movie theater style establishments, with total
nudity and  "lap-sitting" in their bikinis.   Stiff cover
charges - Mitchell Brothers $25, New Century $20, Market
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Francisco:
Street Cinema - $15   Quality varies, particularly at the
Market Street Cinema, but the Cinema  offers the most bang for
the buck and the largest amount of women.   There have been a
few sex changers that have found there way into the
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Francisco:
Cinema - a definite bummer once you realize it. But $5 gets you
a lap sit for one  song  (3 to 5 minutes).

These places all advertise in the movie section of the San
Francisco chronicle. Avoid the tourist trap joints on Broadway that
serve watered down drinks for big prices and hound you for tips.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Francisco:
At the Market Street Cinema, they specialize in minor porn stars with big
tits, although they sometimes have big name stars such as Alicia Monet or
Cameo.  There is a new star weekly.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Francisco:
At the Mitchell Brothers (the first and most infamous lap-dancing place in
town), they have three special rooms.  One is the Ultra Room, a peep show
type setup, in which customers enter private booths with one way mirrors.
Two girls are in a center arena.  There is a slot in each booth to slip
the performers tips.  The girls go from booth to booth soliciting tips.
The girls can masturbate with fingers or dildos or can perform sex on each
other.  

Another room is called the Green Door room. Here about 6 girls take a shower
on stage and perform sex  on each other for two songs.  The stage is
surrounded by tables and booths.  The girls, still rather damp from
their showers, then go from table to table or
booth to booth soliciting tips.  They will lie on top of the tables and
masturbate or have sex with another girl.  The customers are not supposed
to touch the girls at this point, although some of the girls will stretch the
rules.  Once a girl gave me a dildo to lick so it would be nice and wet before
putting it in her cunt.  Then she had me lick it dry afterwards.  Another time
one girl used her fingers to feed me the other girl's pussy juice repeatedly.
They both seemed to get a big kick out of this.

The most infamous room is the Kopenhagen Lounge.  This is a big very dark
room surrounded by mirrors and couches.  The guys sit on the couches and
point flashlights at the girls as they perform their opening number, which
consists of having sex with each other.  Then, the girls go from guy to guy
soliciting tips.  A few years ago, the girls could sit on your lap stark
naked, face to face, and grind their naked crouches into yours.  Then they
changed this and made the girls put on bikinis or lingerie first, although
most girls would discreetly pull these aside.  Now, they only allow the
girls to perform sex acts on themselves or each other.  You cannot touch them.
They usually climb on top of the couches and stick their pussies an inch
from your face and finger themselves or fuck themselves with dildos.

The Kopenhagen was a lot more wild in the old days.  You could literally 
have sex with your clothes on.  Almost all the girls would let 
you suck and lick their
tits.  Some would let you use the dildos on them.  Others would let you
play with their pussies.  Not that many would let you kiss them on the lips.
Of course, the main attraction was having a
beautiful naked girl grind her pussy on your pants-covered cock as your hands
roamed all over her.  Some guys could
come this way and wore condoms.  I never did, but at least twice the girl
came as she ground her pussy on my cock.  (I didn't believe it at first,
but they convinced me it was true). One time, a girl gave me a blow
job through my pants.

Occasionally, porn stars will have limited engagements at the O'Farrell.
This is not as common as it used to be.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Francisco:
At the New Century, a big name porn star is featured weekly.  They also
have a room called the Playpen, which is like the Mitchell Brothers'
Copenhagen Lounge.  Here, they still allow touching.  The girl will straddle
you on the couch face and to face and grind her pussy on your cock.  However,
they must keep their bikinis/lingerie on.  They can take their clothes off
completely, but then you can't touch them.  The room is discreetly very dark
so the rules are usually stretched beyond the breaking point.  

The New Century also has a room called the Arena which is a peep show like
the Ultra Room in the Mitchell Brothers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Francisco:
There is also another peep palace called the Regal ShowWorld.  Here you enter
a private booth, and slip $5 into a slot.  Then, a partition is raised 
showing a naked girl separated from you by a glass window.  You can talk to
the girl through a phone.  On weekends, they often will have a porn star
use one of these rooms.

Of course, the New Century, Mitchell Brothers, and Market St. cinemas all
feature lap-dancing.  For those of you unfamiliar with this, it involves
the girl sitting on your lap either sideways or with her ass facing you.
They try to grind their ass or leg directly on your cock.  At the same time,
they may use their hands or lips to stimulate you.  A common technique is to
unbotton your shirt and play with your nipples.  You may also touch them 
anywhere except the breasts and pussy.  However, I have found that this
rule can often be stretched.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Francisco:
Stay off of Turk street as well.  Overpriced and mainly TVs.
==============================================================================
CANADA

Up here in Montreal, the strip bars (and there are LOTS in Montreal) tend
to be strictly no-touching.  If a dancer likes you she may bend things as
far as to blow in your ear, swish her hair across your face or rub noses,
but that's about it.  I'm told that in the northern suburbs of the city (In
an area called Chomedey) there are touch bars, where the girls encourage
you to fondle and/or french kiss them.  Of course, they only do that when
you're paying them to dance at your table.  I've never been to a touch bar,
but I'm told that the charge per dance is something like 10-12 dollars
(Canadian, natch).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Montreal:
If you are ever in Montreal, check out Club Super Sexe ( yes, that IS
the correct name ).
This place is classy and the chicks are gorgeous. If you are big
spender, for five bucks
the girls will dance if front of your face and take it all of. Of
course, not touching allowed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Montreal:
I'll vouch for the bars in Montreal. I had an opportunity several years ago
to go bar hopping in the downtown area during a convention. My favorite club
was "Les Filles d'Eve" (The Daughters of Eve). Smallish, but comfortable. The
dancers doubled as the waitresses so they weren't allowed to sit at your table
and talk. Stirling's point about most of them not speaking english too well is
very true. My high school French wasn't up to the task either. But if you have
a weakness for ladies with accents, like I do, this is not a problem. One 
thing I liked was that the dancers were allowed a lot more latitude in touching
themselves there than here in Atlanta. 
==============================================================================
COLORADO

Denver:
It has been a while (about 5 years) but when I use to live in Denver,
Shotgun Willie's (on Colorado Blvd., near Colorade 4 theatres, if
my memory is correct) was a great place.  The women were at least cute
and many were better than that.  There are six stages going at the 
same time (on busy nights, less during off hours).  Most of the seating
at the place was "snack bar" seating.  The dancers are only allowed to
become topless because they serve alcohol but when you tip, the G-strings
are pulled back pretty far so you get a good look.  Cover was $6 or so
with a 2 drink minimum (drinks were $3-$4).  A private dance cost about
$10.  Most of the time I got my hands slapped when I touched but on off
nights, you could get away with more.  No big-name stars I ever saw.  They
were written up as one of the 10-best strip-clubs in the country by 
Penthouse or Playboy.  The atmosphere at the club was also somewhat classy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denver:
There is also another place on 88th and Federal the goes bottomless.  They
don't serve alcohol.  Prices are about the same.  The women are not as good
looking but the dancers are quite a bit more raunchy.  This place can be
very entertaining on a good night.  It's a hole in the wall with 2 stages 
so you won't see any big star there.  You can buy table dances.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denver:
Denver has a relatively active topless scene in the city of Glendale
(enclosed within Denver, 10 minutes from the airport and adjacent to the
very upperclass Cherry Creek neighborhood of Denver) and in Adams County
(just west of the city).

In Colorado, a club can be at best topless if alcohol is served; total
nudity is legal if no alcohol is served (places called "Pop Shops" for the
soda pop they sell at $3 or $5 a class). Everyplace I know of has an
official "Touch and Go" policy; touch a dancer between mid-thigh and navel
or on the breasts and you may be escorted to the door. Enforcement varies,
and some places let some girls get away with creating "contact" that if the
guy initiated it would get his ass tossed out the door. By observation, the
better a relationship you have with a dancer (i.e. long-term "customer",
good attitude, etc.) the more likely she is to be interested in bending the
rules. The classier the joint is, the more likely gentleman-like behavior
will reap rewards. As far as I can tell, no touring strippers do shows in
Denver.

The adult-newspaper-of-record in Denver is the Rocky Mountain Oyster, which
can usually be obtained _gratis_ at the adult bookstores around town.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denver:
SHOTGUN WILLIE'S - Probably the best-known club, in Glendale on Colorado
Boulevard at Virginia. Very classy joint; five stages; lots of beautiful
women, many can actually dance; good sound system, mediocre lighting (if you
like that sort of thing). Very white-collar; suits and ties are not out of
place. Not a boobs-in-your-face place, but close enough. Alcohol.  Has a
line of merchandise that the girls are required to push, which some do with
more grace than others. $5 cover last I knew; $4 beers, reasonable
selection.  $20 table dances, officially no-contact. See above.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denver:
MILE-HIGH SALOON - A block away from Shotgun's and east of Colorado Blvd. on
Virginia, worth driving an extra block. Same grade of dancers; better sound
and lighting system; three stages plus bar-top; big, airy place, including
comfy VIP lounge; satellite TV and lots'o'tubes; very friendly staff. No
pushing of merchandise. Dancers generally circulate and will sit and talk
even if you don't buy'em a drink (dancer's drinks are the same price as
yours, and are as real as yours), and often suggest table dancing; they
almost invariably take "no" with grace. One of the few clubs around with
female DJs (most nights). Alcohol. Same prices as Shotgun's; has a kitchen,
though, with surprisingly good food and a menu that goes beyond burgers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denver:
PT'S - 1601 W. Evans. Caters to the swing crowd, it appears; on weekends,
they host top-optional dancing for couples, that sort of thing. Still a
dance club, though; relatively pretty dancers. Roughly the same prices as
Shotgun's.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denver:
DIAMOND CABARET & STEAKHOUSE - 1222 Glenarm, downtown near I-25. Newest
class-joint in Denver; seven stages, glass shower for bachelors and the
like. The restaurant is attached but separated; supposedly has really good
steaks. Roughly same prices as Shotgun's.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denver:
SATURDAY'S - East Colfax, near the Air Force Base, just on the edge of the
city (almost Aurora). Pop shop, full nudity; reasonably good-looking
dancers, but the dancing talent is lower than at the above- listed clubs.
Lots of military, scattering of white-collar men but more blue-collar.
Either premiere second tier or bottom of the top. $5 cover (I think...),
$4.00 near-beer and pop, no real food. Private dances ar $12 or $15. Couple
pool tables, pinball machine.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Denver:
THE FEDERAL HEIGHTS STRIPS - A series of second-tier clubs, with and without
alcohol, along Federal Blvd (US 287), Pecos St., and Broadway between
roughly 52 Ave and 85 Ave.  Names like Cheerleaders, that sort of thing.
Adult bookstores scattered along the strip on Federal. The girls aren't as
classy as the above three clubs, nor is the club decor; working-class
clientele, in general. Usually a $5 cover, private/table dances at $12-$20
depending on the place.
Boulder:
A nice place to stop, eat and drink is the Bus Stop near Boulder.  Bikers,
trucker, locals, and college kids go there for the inexpensive drinks
and food.  They have topless dancers that you can watch or ignore.  
I've seen beautiful women there and some real dogs.  I guess it's whatever
passes through town.  You can buy table dances later in the evening.
==============================================================================
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

Washington DC:  there is supposed to be a nice place a few blocks
from the White House, but I never made it there yet.
==============================================================================
FLORIDA

Cocoa Beach Florida area:
Backroom (or INner Room) Caberet
nicest strip joint I've been to. no cover before 7pm.  girls get
topless w/a G strip on one stage.  about 50 girls there at a time.
when they're not dancing on stage, they're walking through the
room topless and letting the audience feel / touch their bodies
for $3. it was one the best investments I ever made! one in particular
pushed her breasts into my face and let me lick the nipples while
holding them.

the girls also do private table dances for $3 to 5. full contact dances $8.
and six girls full contact on stage with audience member dances $30.

very friendly girls, nice looking, soft, one girl I remember was a little
Oriental with almost a flat chest but with nipples that stuck out erect
about 1 inch from her chest.  she kept wandering the crowd and saying 
"Buck Me!".  if you did, you got to suck those magnificant nipples!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cocoa Beach Florida area:
the second place there was similar, but bills itself as having 100
girls.  and has slightly higher prices.  I forget the name, but both
are on route A1A within a mile or two of each other near Cocoa Beach.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orlando:  Rachels up on 436 (Semoran) just into Seminole County is
GREAT!!!  Very nice women. They have an upstairs which I assume is total
nudity, but they only let members up there.  Also, Club Juana is in that
area, and is total nudity.
==============================================================================
GENERAL

Deja Vu is a franchise operation, with around 25 clubs scattered around the
country. In addition to Louisville, there are 2 Deja Vus in California, 6 in
Michigan, 6 in Washington, 4 in Tennessee and one each in Colorado, Illinois,
Minnesota Ohio and Wroclaw, Poland (!).

I've been checking out the local strip joints whereever I go, and think Deja
Vu is likely to be the best bet in any city that has one. For more information,
call 1-800-234-3785 and order a copy of Deja Vu magazine. It costs $5.00 and
includes a free admission pass to any Deja Vu club, which generally costs the
same (Louisville has lowered their cover to $5, but no longer give you the
first drink free).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A side note: For international travel, the best reference I've ever seen is 
"The Sex Maniac's Bible", by Tuppy Owens. It's published in London, but can be
ordered in the U.S. from "Good Vibrations", 1210 Valencia Street, San
Francisco, CA 94110 (sorry, can't find their phone number).  Don't know where
to order it in Europe, but the author gives her address as P. O. Box 4ZB,
London, W1A 4ZB, and surely she could tell you.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my experience, full contact happens in  Florida, Mississippi,
Michigan, Colorado and California.

FL and MS clubs had little alcoves you went to with the lady of your
choice.  How far you could go, depended on how much you spent and whether
or not the vice squad was cracking down.

MI has very strict controls on what you can and can not do.  No
touching of the breasts, buttocks and genitals, but you could lick
their breasts and buttocks.  Lots of other little rules too.

CO & CA both have "he can't touch her, but she can touch him" rules. 
Another words, cup your hand and a breast might just move into it.  :)

All the above states tie nudity to alcohol.  Topless only if alcohol is
served, no alcohol if nude.  FL and MS both have private clubs where
you can bring you own though.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For those interested, there are 2 biographies of strippers:

"Queen of Burlesque:  The Autobiography of Yvette Paris" by Yvette Paris
"Naked is the Best Disguise:  My Life as a Stripper" by Lauri Lewin

There is also a novel out called "Topless" by D. Keith Mano.  The author
has written for Playboy, and researched topless bars before writing the
story.
==============================================================================
GEORGIA

Atlanta:
1. The Gold Club, rated number one in the country in USA Today a few months ago.
              very high class, usually suits go there, about 20 -30 girls
              dancing at any particular time all about the bar. Very clean 
              and high tech place. Tables dances (I beleive 10-15 dollars),
              cover: 6 dollars, parking: $4 , beer: $4, if you don't tip the 
              waitresses at least a dollar they get very pissed, so beers are 
              really $5. Every women I have ever seen in there was a 10.
              If you don't have cash, don't go, they will treat you like shit.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atlanta:
2. Tattletales.   Right accross the street from the Gold Club, a little smaller 
              and sleezier, but also cheaper, women are 7-9's. Will dance
              3 songs for you at a table or just standing around for 10 bucks.
              I swear to God the last time I went there this one girl made her
              pussy pucker! If you treat the good they will usually come to you
              after the dance and sit on your lap and give you a kiss and not  
              even expecta  drink. Motley Crue sings about tattle tales in 
              there song Girls Girls Girls.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atlanta:
Gold Rush Showbar - south side
This is the place for nationally-known acts. Penthouse Pets, Playmates, XXX
actresses... Upscale decor.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atlanta:
The Gold Club - Buckhead
The nicest of Atlanta's clubs. More dancers than you can shake a stick at.
On prime nights (Fri, Sat) there are usually about 50 dancers per shift. All
are very attractive. Definitely what was referred to in Top Gun as "A 
target-rich environment". Cover varies by time of day from $4 to $6. Most
drinks are $4 (even cokes) (Southerners call all soft drinks 'cokes' <grin>).
4 stages. Table dances are $10. They periodically do a 'Revue' where all the
dancers are on-stage at once for 3 songs. During revues you can pick dancers
off the stage for half-price table dances. My only complaint with The Gold
Club is that it is usually very crowded. It is right next to a MARTA rail 
station - very convenient. Valet and small self-park lot available. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atlanta:
Cheetah III - Downtown
An acquaintance of mine manages this club. It is very similar to The Gold Club.
I just don't like driving all the way down there when I can ride a MARTA train
to The Gold Club and avoid all that DUI hassle on the way home. I do recommend
it if you are downtown already.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atlanta:
Tattletales - Midtown
Nice decor. Good quantity and quality of dancers. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Atlanta:
Coronet - Roswell Rd.
I haven't been here but I hear it is nice. This is one of those non-alcohol-serving clubs I mentioned, so it is BYOB. I mention it becuase 
it has one unusual feature - it has both male and female dancers. They rotate
each hour as to what sex is dancing. It might be fun to talk a female travelling
companion into going here... <wicked grin> 
==============================================================================
HAWAII

Honolulu:
Club Femme Nu, Honolulu.  Great place, a little expensive though.
Beers $5, dancers drinks are $20.  Mostly a no-touch place.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Honolulu:
Hey I'm surprised there's been only one mention of Honolulu, we must have
the most strip bars per capita in the U.S.!  There's generally 2 types of
bars featuring female entertainment here, the strip bars with dancers and
the hostess bars.

The strip clubs all feature full nudity, the vast majority
of them have no cover charge.  These used to be real strip clubs where the
dancers actually put on a show but now most of them are just out for the tips
so they just go around to each guy sitting at the stage and spread their
legs to allow you a quick peek, then expect a tip put into their garters.
Some will allow you to stick it in their g-strings or if you put a dollar
in your mouth, they'll grab it with their tits.  If you don't give them a tip
they get REALLY pissed off so don't sit at the stage if you are cheap.
At the top clubs like RockZa, Femme Nu, Club Rose, Klassic Kat, and Dancers,
they do have a nominal cover charge of one or two dollars and the women
there are really gorgeous, especially at Rock Za but sometimes they are so
aggressive for tips it's a turn off.  Some of them still have shower shows
where one or more women will shower in front of you and you can stick wet
dollar bills onto their bodies.  The generally rule is no touching of breasts
or genitals and most of them are pretty strict about that, but there's the
occasional dancer who's more friendly that others.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Honolulu:
What does this have to do with a.s.m.?  There's one club that used to be
called Club Cheri but now is called Wild Horse which features porno stars
past and present with a different one every week.  Almost every big name
star has been here, including Ginger Lynn, Teri Weigel, etc.  Some of them
even let you take pictures with them nude (they are nude, not you!)
for a few dollars.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Honolulu:
Then there are the hostess bars.  There aren't any dancers here, but the
bar girls are in different states of undress and you buy them drinks so they
will come and sit with you.  The drinks are VERY expensive, at least $20
for something that looks a lot like water, but it's not the drinks you are
paying for but the company.  At some places they just talk but at others
they will fondle you and you can do the same.  Usually this is to get you
to agree to go into the back where you can get different services for
different prices...it's kinda expensive though.  Usually if you aren't
interested in going to the back, they'll finish their drink and go away
unless you are willing to fork up another $20 for another drink...one
drink usually lasts only for 10 minutes or so...kinda expensive for a
cheap feel.  Some of the ones that might be worth checking out are
Magazine Girl and Bon Soire...it's very dark and discreet in there.
==============================================================================
ILLINOIS

Champaign-Urbana:
In Champaign-Urbana there are several bars with dancers.  One , Malibu
bay Lounge, has dancers Mon-Sat, cover is $5.  While up on stage, they
go topless, but for table dances are covered (usually a bikini top).
They are not big enough to get name stars, but will get dancers from 
out of town (last headliner was featured in Cheri).  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Champaign-Urbana:
A few other bars also feature dancers one or two nights a week.  These
are Silver Bullet Bar (women exotic dancers on Monday and Tuesday, male
dancers on Wednesday), and Club Sierra.  
==============================================================================
INDIANA

Indianapolis:
Brad's is a classy place, and quite large.  I forget what the cover
was.  They do have name stars.  I was there on a weeknight, and the 
place was crowded.  They have a large main stage, with 2 dancers.
The dancers are topless, not totally nude.  The table dances were
done well.  The dances included rubbing themselves against you, from
their breasts to their buttocks.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indianapolis:
The Red Garter is a small bar just south of Union Station.  Cover is a 
dollar.  There is a runway down the middle, with chairs around it.  
The dancers are topless, but not nude.  They will touch you, but you
are somewhat limited in touching them.  One dancer used one of the
bars over the stage to raise herself up.  She then wrapped her legs
around your head, and thrust her crotch into your face.  I doubt that
they get name stars, but they get headliners from out of town.  The
dancers will come and drink with you, and are fairly friendly.  There
is a smaller stage over to the side where you can have a "private" 
dance (not really private, anyone can see over).
==============================================================================
KENTUCKY

Louisville:
Here in Louisville, Ky., there is a place called Deja Vu which is not 
bad.  There is a $6.00 cover and no alcohol is served.  The girls 
dance through two songs, by the end of which they are completely nude. 
 Between the songs the parade around in what ever manner of undress 
that they achieved during the first song, to solicit tips from those 
sitting around the stage.  You will be asked by those not dancing if 
you want a table top dance or couch dance, the prices ranging from 
$5.00 to $10.00, but the policy is that if you touch them, you can be 
tossed out.  Two doors down, and affiliated with it is a dance bar 
where alcohol is served, but the dancers only dance, no nudity.  Can't 
remember the address, even though I live in the area, but it is a 
pretty classy place.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lexington:
   o If you're in Lexington, go to Pure Gold.  Ask for toni.. she has 
     a god-like body.
==============================================================================
LOUISIANA

New Orleans:
TOPLESS SHOWBAR:  small one stage place, seven or 8 girls, topless
for the most part with G string..

nice dancing routines. I remember one girl there with the pointiest nipples
and the most trianglular breast I've ever seen.   this place was one of a
dozen or so on Bourbon Street.  the girls would sit and talk to the 
audience when not dancing.

no cover charge
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Orleans:
MOTHERS TOPLESS AND BOTTOMLES CLUB (?) not sure of the name
also on Bourban street, also no cover.

stuck up girls. they wanted $20 to do a "private" dance, or $10
to do a table dance.  otherwise, they kept their clothes on and
only flashed their breasts.  very bad experience from my perspective.
==============================================================================
MASSACHUSETTS

Boston:  The NAKED I Club
no cover charge paid, nice looking girls, two stages, dancing on
the stages only, but the dancers circulated in the crowd and tried 
to get you to buy them drinks. if you did, they'ld sit and talk to
you

the girls took everything off in their routines.  full nudity!

one of the stages was called the "Pussy Galore Bar".  they'ld get within
inches of the audience and shove their pussy towards the front row of
lucky guys.
==============================================================================
MICHIGAN

Detroit: Tycoons (on 8 Mile Road) is quite good.  For $5 you'll get a
dance, for $10 you'll get an in-your-face-and-crotch dance.
==============================================================================
MINNESOTA

Minneapolis:
In Minneapolis, the best nude bar (in my opinion) is SOLID GOLD.
Don't miss it.  The women are "only" topless -- but they're
beautiful, and there are many of them visible at any given
time.  The girls dance on a main stage, and inside numerous
cages.  Upstairs they have wrestling and boxing (although I've
never seen that).  The cover charge (last time I checked) is 
$5 on weekdays, $7 on weekends.  On some nights you can get in
for free if you bring a date.  I don't think they have any big
stars there, but they have big other things.

So anyway, if you only go to one nude bar in Minneapolis, go to
Solid Gold.  It's great.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minneapolis:
At the places on Broadway you sit at tables or in a theater, there's a two
drink minimum (probably over $20 now for two beers, haven't been there in
a while), the girls strip to g-strings, and at some at least, will later
come over and sit on your lap for a few dollars.  The more you pay, the
longer she stays. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minneapolis:
The ones in other parts of the city (O'Farrell, Market St. Cinema, New
Century, etc.) have theater seating, do not serve alcohol, and the girls
strip nude.  If you have a seat at the stage and tip them while they dance,
they'll spend some time in front of you exposing themselves, maybe hovering
their tits or pussy inches from your face, but again, you can't touch them,
although they may touch you.  The only exception was when a girl was laying
on the runway and I, sitting right there, briefly held her hand.  A nice
moment.

After dancing, the girls dress into an outfit that by law I was told must
have a fabric connection between the top and bottom, so not only no exposure,
but no bikinis either.  They go through the audience asking each if they
"would like to have some company" and then for a few dollars will sit on your
lap.  Again, the more you pay the longer she stays and you may not touch her
tits or pussy.  She will sit there and you may talk or hug her, or as they
seem to prefer doing, perform a "lap dance".  This is where they sit on your
lap with their back to you and move their ass back and forth over your crotch.
Because of the otherwise lack of contact and hands off policy, I never found
this very erotic or stimulating, so I don't go for it.  But a (generally
beautiful) girl on your lap is still always a very pleasant experience.

Some of the other things these places offer is a group of booths surrounding
an area where two girls go at one another and a more intimate darkened room
where you sit on sofas around a stripping girl and shine flashlights on her.
At the O'Farrell I think these were known as the Ultra Room and the Amsterdam,
respectively, but I don't know if they're still there.
==============================================================================
NEW YORK

New York City:
I've never been to New York, but on a "48 Hours" program on Times Square
they said that lap dancing itself was illegal.  This surprised me since I
thought NY more open than SF, at least I've heard you can get golden shower
videos there, which you can't here.  And taken together, I wouldn't have
thought even more contact would be allowed in Florida.
==============================================================================
OHIO

Cleveland:
Crazy Horse West, Downtown, or River showboat.  cover charge, 
fully nude and topless depending on location.  there are three.
often have playboy models, famous girls, or big breasts. eg. the 
week I was in Cleveland, the attaction west was The Morrell Sisters
and downtown has someone with a 74 inch bustline.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cleveland:
Tiffanies.  never been there yet.  was "opening soon" last time
I past through town.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cleveland:
Circus.  accepts coupl
   er. coupons for admission, cover charge otherwise.  nice girls,
   topless mostly. lots of stages.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cleveland:
Amber Lounge.  features oil wrestling and the like.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cleveland:
Juicy Lucie's .  full nudity, juice bar only.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cleveland:
Pinkie's Showbar.  full nudity, juice bar only.
==============================================================================
PENNSYLVANIA

Pittsburgh:  Don't bother...at least not with the one (Fantasy's) I've been
in.
==============================================================================
TEXAS

Austin:
If you get to Austin I can suggest several.
The Best is THE LADY 

  The outside may cause people to question how good it is, but once inside
  it is nice and clean. There is no cover before 8:00pm and a $4.00 cover
  after 8:00. The dancers are pretty and most of them are honestly friendly.

  Since they serve alcohol Texas law restricts them to topless dancing only
  and under the law dancers and customers may not tough each other when the
  dancer is dancing. Table dances are $10.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Austin:
Also Good is EXPOSE

  I personally find the club too small. The dancers are pretty and willing
  to talk to the customers. There is a cover charge which varies with the time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Austin:
Tied for the bottom of the list are:
THE RED ROSE, THE YELLOW ROSE and SUGARS

  Even though I visit these regularly most of the dancers are very stuck up.
  If you are not the MTV muscian or "Daddy Warbucks" type they will not talk
  to you. On the other hand you may be lucky each of these clubs have a few
  pretty and nice dancers but they are generally busy with the regulars who
  seek them out. There is a cover charge here which varies with the time of
  day at these clubs. At lunch time they do not have a cover charge and I
  will definetly recomend the food at SUGARS it is good at a good price.

Austin:
New to Austin is JOY

  Since my girlfriend has worked at all of the above clubs I am know these
  clubs quite well. I have not been to JOY yet. I know that they have a
  cover charge and that is about it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
San Antonio
In San Antonio I can say STAY AWAY FROM LIPSTICK

  Several of my girlfriend's friends have worked there and say that this is
  just a rip off joint. the dancers will dance topless on stage and try to 
  get you to pay for a provate session. The club will do their best to get
  as much of the non refundable money from you before they deny you a private
  dance room.

  I have been there once with some friends. Since I was warned by ex-dancers
  from this club we left as soon as the dancers and waitresses began their
  little scam and they got no money from us.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dallas:
Caligula XXI is a nice place, Lots of pretty girls, topless only.
They can have as many as 6 stages going at any one time: 1 Main
stage and then the girls rotat through the 5 others.  Then they are
available for table dances.  Cover ranges from $1.00 to $3.00 then
finally $5.00 at night.  They do have main attractions, last week
was Teri Weigel, currently is Ginger Lynn, TracI ToppS is comming 
soon.  Happy hour from 6 to 9 (i guess)  I've gotten to know several
of the girls and most are really nice girls.  lots of plastic :)
Do they Dance??  well.. that is a matter of opinion.. specific to
the girl, she may be all over you, or stand apart from you..
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dallas:
I've been to a few others, Cabaret Royal (much over rated)
and then a few _lower_ class places when you "just wanna have fun"
