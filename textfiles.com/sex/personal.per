I like sports, music, reading, and all sorts of fun things,
dancing romantic talks and walks and dining out.  Also I am
looking for a girl who likes the same things as I do.  She
should be slim, petite 5'4"-5'6" and have similar interests

I am a single male 5'9" with jet black short hair.  I like music of all kinds,
especially classical and rock, along the lines of NewOrder, Joy Division,
Bauhaus, Floyd, Led Zep, George Winston (pianist), Genesis, Spyrogyra, Bach,
Brahms, Alphaville, Yaz, Erasure and Peter Schilling.  I'm about 20 ( I would
not like to reveal my true age) and I am a great conversationalist.  I make a
considerable amount of money and I am looking for that special someone to
share my intimate moments.  I'm not into that macho stuff or that obviously
shallow attempts at sensitivity.  I like to be spontaneous and occasionally
wild.  I am not bad looking.  So, if you are looking for a true love type
deal, E-mail me.  (Female responses only please) (Although I have nothing
against homosexuality, I am not one myself).
