This was faxed to a friend of mine, but he isn't sure who sent it to him. This
joke works best if you print it out and leave it sitting around the office or
anywhere it will stand out and get noticed.

Hello!

I'm from outer space, and I've made myself look like a piece of paper.  While
you hold me, I'm having sex with your fingers.

I know it feels good to you, because you're smiling.  I'm very horny, so give
me to someone else when you've had enough.

Thanks!

Sincerely,
A Stranger in a Strange Land
