
         "Indoor Golf"
      General Rules of Play

  1.  Each player will furnish his own equipment for play, normally one club
and two balls.

  2.  Course to be played must be approved by the owner of the course before
play can begin.

  3.  Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and keep
the balls out of the hole.

  4.  Course owners reserve the right to examine the length of the club to
avoid damage to the hole.

  5.  For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft.  Course owner
s are permitted to check the stiffness o f the shaft before play begins.

  6.  The object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the
course owner is satisfied.  Failure to do so may result in being denied
permission to play the course again.

  7.  Players are cautioned to select the proper hole for play.

  8.  It is normally considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately
upon arriving at the course.  The experienced player will usually admire the
entire course, with special atten- tion to the well-formed bunkers.  He should
also assure himself that the hole is properly lubricated to aid in stroking.
Additional lubricant may be added to the club if necessary - pre- ferably by
the course owner.

  9.  Players are cautioned not to mentio na any other courses they have played
to the owner of the course currently being played.  Upset owners have been
known to damage a player's equipment for this reason.

  10.  Players should assure themselves that their match has been properly
scheduled, especially on a different course being played for the first time.
Previous players have been known to get irate if they find some- one else
playing what they considered their own private course.

  11.  It is considered outstanding performance, time permitting, to play the
same hole several times in one match.

  12.  Course owners shall be the judge of who is the best player.  It is
consider ed bad form for a player to reveal his score to other players or that
he even played the course.  Players who have contracted for exclusive right s
to play a private course are caustioned that information reaching th e owner
that he had played some other courses may result in the contract bein g
cancelled and a suit for damages institued.

  13.  Players should not assume a course is in shape for play at all times.
Some owners may be embarassed their cou rse is temporarily under repair and the
player is advised to use tact in this determination.  More advanced players
will find alternative means of play when this is the case.
