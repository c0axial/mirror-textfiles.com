                            MALE MENSTRUATION 

     So what would happen if suddenly, magically, men could menstruate and 
women could not?   Menstruation would become an enviable, boast-worthy, 
masculine event. Men would brag about how long, and how much. Boys would
talk about it as the envied beginning of manhood. Gifts, religious 
ceremonies, family dinners, and stag parties would mark the day.
     To prevent monthly work loss among the powerful, Congress would fund a 
National Institute of Dysmenorrhea. Doctors would research little about heart 
attacks, from which men were hormonally protected, but everything about 
cramps.
     Sanitary supplies would be federally funded and free. Of course, some 
men would still pay for the prestige of some commercial brands such as Paul 
Newman Tampons, Muhammad Ali's Rope-a-Dope Pads, John Wayne Maxi-Pads, Joe 
Namath Jock shields--"For those light bachelor Days."
     Statistical surveys would show that men did better in sports and won more 
Olympic medals during their periods. Generals, right-wing politicians, and 
religious fundamentalists would cite menstruation ("men-struation") as proof 
that only men could serve God and country in combat. ("You have to give blood 
to take blood".), occupy high political offices  ("Can women be properly 
fierce without a monthly cycle governed by the planet Mars?"), be priests, 
ministers, God Himself ("He gave his blood for our sins"), or rabbis 
("Without a monthly purge of impurities, women are unclean").
     Male liberals or radicals, however, would insist that women are equal, 
just different; and that any woman could join if only she were willing to 
recognize the primacy of menstrual rights ("Everything else is a single 
issue") or self inflict a major wound every month ("You MUST give blood for 
the revolution.").
     Street guys would invent slang ("He's a three-pad man") and give 
"fives" on the corner with some exchange like, "Man, you, lookin' good!" 
"Yeah, man I'm on the rag."
      TV shows would treat the subject openly. (Hill Street Blues: The whole 
precinct hits the same cycle.) So would newspapers, (SUMMER SHARK SCARE 
THREATENS MENSTRUATING MEN; JUDGE CITES MONTHLIES IN PARDONING RAPIST.) And so 
would movies. (Newman and Redford in 'Blood Brothers'.
     Men would convince women that sex was more pleasurable at "that time of 
the month." Lesbians would be said to fear blood and therefore life itself, 
though all they needed was a good menstruating man. Medical schools would 
limit women's entry ("They might faint at the sight of blood."). 
     Of course intellectuals would offer the most moral and logical 
arguments.  Without that biological gift for measuring the cycles of the moon 
and planets, how could a woman master any discipline that demanded a sense 
of time, space, mathematics--or the ability to measure anything at all?
     Liberal males would try to be kind. The fact that "these people" have no 
gift for measuring life, the liberals would explain, should be punishment 
enough.
