RUMOR HAD IT that women were planning to take part in this year's Nude 
Olympics, and so when the first appreciable snow fell during exam week, there 
was an added dash to the event. According to the DAILY PRINCETONIAN, "an 
estimated 125-150 people participated," and another 500 cheered them on.

There were no stats on the women, but apparently they didn't steal the show. 
Though most men didn't seem to mind sharing the turf--"Women always have the 
right to run naked in my backyard," one Holder resident told the PRINCE, "I'm 
no male chauvinist"--
objection was reported. "I think it's ridiculous for these feminists to shout 
about pornography, and then come out and cheer and scream their heads off," 
complained a sophomore man who boycotted the event.

In addition to wrestling, sit-ups, push-ups, jumping jacks, and wheelbarrow 
races, there was the traditional run through the campus and into Firestone 
Library, where one athlete said, "We just jogged around and kissed the books."
