                      A Message From The Surgeon General

    This brochure has been sent to you by the Government of the United States.  
In preparing it, we have consulted with the top health experts in the country.  

    I feel it is important that you have the best  information  now  available 
for  fighting  the AIDS virus,  a health problem that the President has called 
"Public Enemy Number One." 

    Stopping AIDS is up to you, your family and your loved ones.  

    Some of the issues involved in this brochure may not  be  things  you  are 
used  to  discussing  openly.  I can easily understand that.  But now you must 
discuss them.  We all must know about AIDS.  Read this brochure and talk about 
it with those you love.  Get involved.  Many schools, churches, synagogues and 
community groups offer AIDS education activities.  


    I encourage you to practice responsible behavior  based  on  understanding 
and strong personal values.  This is what you can do to stop AIDS.  

                         C. Everett Koop, M.D., Sc.D.
                                Surgeon General


                          What AIDS Means To You

    AIDS  is  one  of the most serious health problems that has ever faced the 
American public.  It is important that we  all,  regardless  of  who  we  are, 
understand this disease.  

    AIDS  stands  for  acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome.  It  is a disease 
caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV -- the AIDS virus.  

    The AIDS virus may live in the human body for years before actual symptoms 
appear.  It primarily  affects  you  by  making  you  unable  to  fight  other 
diseases.  These other diseases can kill you.  

    Many  people  feel  that  only  certain  "high  risk groups" of people are 
infected by the AIDS virus.  This is untrue.  Who you are has  nothing  to  do 
with  whether  you  are in danger of being infected with the AIDS virus.  What 
matters is what you do.  

    People are worried about getting AIDS.  Some should be worried and need to 
take some serious precautions.  But many are  not  in  danger  of  contracting 
AIDS.  

    Your  children need to know about AIDS.  Discuss it with them as you would 
any health concern.  


                             How Do You Get AIDS?

    There are two main ways you can get AIDS.  First,  you can become infected 
by  having  sex -- oral,  anal or vaginal -- with someone who is infected with 
the AIDS virus.  

    Second,  you can be infected by sharing drug needles and syringes with  an 
infected person.  

    Babies  of  women  who  have been infected with the AIDS virus may be born 
with the infection because it can be transmitted from the mother to  the  baby 
before or during birth.  


                           Can You Become Infected?  

    Yes, if you engage in risky behavior.  

    The  male  homosexual population was the first in this country to feel the 
effects of the disease.  But in spite of what you may have heard,  the  number 
of heterosexual cases is growing.  

    People who have died of AIDS in the U.S.  have been male and female,  rich 
and poor, white, Black, Hispanic, Asian and American Indian.  


                         How Do You Get AIDS From Sex?  

    The AIDS virus can be spread by sexual intercourse whether you are male or 
female, heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual.  

    This happens because a person infected with the AIDS virus  may  have  the 
virus  in  semen  or vaginal fluids.  The virus can enter the body through the 
vagina, penis, rectum or mouth.  

    Anal intercourse, with or without a condom, is risky. The rectum is easily 
injured during anal intercourse.  

    Remember, AIDS is sexually transmitted, and the AIDS virus is not the only 
infection that is passed through intimate sexual contact.  

    Other sexual transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes and 
chlamydia, can also be contracted through oral,  anal and vaginal intercourse. 
If  you  are  infected with one of these diseases and engage in risky behavior 
you are at greater risk of getting AIDS.  


                 You Won't Get AIDS From Insects -- Or A Kiss

    No matter what you may have heard,  the AIDS virus is hard to get  and  is 
easily avoided.  

    You  won't  just  "catch"  AIDS  like a cold or flu because the virus is a 
different type.  The AIDS virus is transmitted through sexual intercourse, the 
sharing  of  drug  needles,  or to babies of infected mothers before or during 
birth.  

    You won't get the AIDS virus through  everyday  contact  with  the  people 
around you in school,  in the workplace,  at parties,  child care centers,  or 
stores. You won't get it by swimming in a pool, even if someone in the pool is 
infected with the AIDS virus.  Students attending school with someone infected 
with the AIDS virus are not in danger from casual contact.  


    You  won't  get  AIDS  from  a  mosquito  bite.  The  AIDS  virus  is  not 
transmitted  through  a mosquito's salivary glands like other diseases such as 
malaria or yellow fever.  You won't get it from bed bugs, lice, flies or other 
insects, either.  

    You won't get AIDS from saliva, sweat, tears, urine or a bowel movement.  

    You won't get AIDS from a kiss.  

    You won't get AIDS from clothes,  a telephone,  or from a toilet seat.  It 
can't  be  passed  by  using  a glass or eating utensils that someone else has 
used.  You won't get the virus by being on a bus,  train or  crowded  elevator 
with a person who is infected with the virus, or who has AIDS.  


                        What Behavior Puts You At Risk?

    You are at risk of being infected with the AIDS virus if you have sex with 
someone  who  is  infected,  or  if  you  share drug needles and syringes with 
someone who is infected.  

    Since you can't be sure who is  infected,  your  chances  of  coming  into 
contact with the virus increase with the number of sex partners you have.  Any 
exchange  of infected blood,  semen or vaginal fluids can spread the virus and 
place you at great risk.  

    The following behaviors are risky when performed with an infected  person. 
You can't tell by looking if a person is infected.  


                                RISKY BEHAVIOR

    Sharing drug needles and syringes.  

    Anal sex, with or without a condom.  

    Vaginal or oral sex with someone who shoots drugs or engages in anal sex.  

    Sex  with  someone  you  don't  know well (a pickup or prostitute) or with 
    someone you know has several sex partners.  

    Unprotected sex (without a condom) with an infected person.  

                                 SAFE BEHAVIOR

    Not having sex.  

    Sex with one mutually faithful, uninfected partner.  

    Not shooting drugs.  


                              What About Dating?

    Dating and getting to know other people is a normal part of  life.  Dating 
doesn't  mean  the  same thing as having sex.  Sexual intercourse as a part of 
dating can be risky. One of the risks is AIDS.  

    How can you tell if someone you're dating or would like to date  has  been 
exposed to the AIDS virus?  The bad news is, you can't.  But the good news is, 
as long as sexual activity and sharing drug needles are  avoided,  it  doesn't 
matter.  

    You  are  going to have to be careful about the person you become sexually 
involved with, making your own decision based on your own best judgment.  That 
can be difficult.  

    Has  this  person  had any sexually transmitted diseases?  How many people 
have they been to bed with?  Have they experimented with drugs?  All these are 
sensitive, but important, questions. But you have a personal responsibility to 
ask.  

    Think  of it this way.  If you know someone well enough to have sex,  then 
you should be able to talk about AIDS.  If someone is unwilling to  talk,  you 
shouldn't have sex.  


                          Do Married People Get AIDS?

    Married people who are uninfected,  faithful and don't shoot drugs are not 
at risk.  But if they engage in risky behavior,  they can become infected with 
the  AIDS  virus  and  infect  their partners.  If you feel your spouse may be 
putting you at risk, talk to him or her. It's your life.  


                      What Is All The Talk About Condoms?

    Not so very long ago,  condoms (rubbers or prophylactics) were  things  we 
didn't talk about very much.  

    Now,  they're  discussed on the evening news and on the front page of your 
newspaper,  and displayed out in the open in your local drug  store,  grocery, 
and convenience store.  

    For  those  who are sexually active and not limiting their sexual activity 
to one partner, condoms have been shown to help prevent the spread of sexually 
transmitted diseases.  That is why the use of condoms is recommended  to  help 
reduce the spread of AIDS.  

    Condoms  are  the  best preventive measure against AIDS besides not having 
sex and practicing safe behavior.  

    But condoms are far from being foolproof.  You have to use them  properly. 
And you have to use them every time you have sex, from start to finish. If you 
use a condom, you should remember these guidelines: 

    (1)  Use  condoms  made of latex rubber.  Latex serves as a barrier to the 
virus. "Lambskin" or "natural membrane" condoms are not as good because of the 
pores in the material. Look for the word "latex" on the package.  

    (2)  A  condom  with  a  spermicide  may  provide  additional  protection.  
Spermicides  have  been  shown in laboratory tests to kill the virus.  Use the 
spermicide in the tip and outside the condom.  

    (3) Condom use is safer with a lubricant. Check the list of ingredients on 
the back of the lubricant package to make sure the lubricant  is  water-based. 
Do not use petroleum-based jelly,  cold cream, baby oil or cooking shortening. 
These can weaken the condom and cause it to break.  


                    What Does Someone With AIDS Look Like?

    It is very important that  everyone  understands  that  a  person  can  be 
infected with the AIDS virus without showing any symptoms at all.  

    It is possible to be infected for years,  feel fine, look fine and have no 
way of knowing you are infected unless you have a test for the AIDS virus.  

    During this period, however,  people infected with the AIDS virus can pass 
the virus to sexual partners, to people with whom drug needles are shared, and 
to children before or during birth.  That is one of the most disturbing things 
about AIDS.  

    Once symptoms do appear,  they are similar to the symptoms of  some  other 
diseases. As the disease progresses, they become more serious. That is because 
the AIDS virus keeps your body's natural defenses from operating correctly.  

    If  you  are  concerned  whether you might be infected,  consider your own 
behavior and its effects on others.  If you feel you need to be tested for the 
AIDS virus, talk to a doctor or an AIDS counselor for more information.  


                           Is There A Cure For AIDS?

    There is presently no cure for AIDS.  

    Medicines  such  as AZT have prolonged the lives of some people with AIDS. 
There is hope that additional treatments will be found.  

    There is also no vaccine to prevent uninfected  people  from  getting  the 
infection.  Researchers  believe  it  may  take  years for an effective,  safe 
vaccine to be found.  

    The most effective way to prevent AIDS is avoiding exposure to the  virus, 
which you can control by your own behavior.  


                         Should You Get An AIDS Test?

    You  have  probably heard about the "AIDS Test." The test doesn't actually 
tell you if you have AIDS.  It shows if you have been infected with the virus. 
It looks for changes in blood that occur after you have been infected.  

    The  Public  Health Service recommends you be confidentially counseled and 
tested if you have had any sexually transmitted disease or shared needles;  if 
you are a man who has had sex with another man;  or if you have had sex with a 
prostitute,  male or female.  You should be tested if you have  had  sex  with 
anyone who has done any of these things.  

    If you are a woman who has been engaging in risky behavior and you plan to 
have a baby or are not using birth control, you should be tested.  

    Your  doctor  may  advise  you  to  be  counseled  and tested if you are a 
hemophiliac, or have received a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985.  

    If you test positive, and find you have been infected with the AIDS virus, 
you must take steps to protect your partner.  

    People who have always practiced safe behavior do not need to be tested.  

    There's been a great deal in the press about problems with the test. It is 
very reliable if it is done by a good laboratory and the results  are  checked 
by a physician or counselor.  

    If  you  have  engaged  in  risky behavior,  speak frankly to a doctor who 
understands the AIDS problem, or to an AIDS counselor.  

    For more information, call your local public health agency. They're listed 
in the government section of  your  phone  book.  Or,  call  your  local  AIDS 
hotline. If you can't find the number, call 1-800-342-AIDS.  


                         The Problem Of Drugs And AIDS

    Today,  in some cities,  the sharing of drug needles and syringes by those 
who shoot drugs is the fastest growing way that the virus is being spread.  

    No one should shoot drugs. It can result in addiction, poor health, family 
disruption, emotional disturbances and death. Many drug users are addicted and 
need to enter a drug treatment program as quickly as possible.  

    In the meantime,  these people must avoid AIDS by not sharing any  of  the 
equipment used to prepare and inject illegal drugs.  

     Sharing drug needles,  even once, is an extremely easy way to be infected 
with the AIDS virus.  Blood from an infected person  can  be  trapped  in  the 
needle or syringe, and then injected directly into the bloodstream of the next 
person who uses the needle.  

    Other kinds of drugs,  including alcohol,  can also cause problems.  Under 
their influence,  your judgment becomes impaired.  You could be exposed to the 
AIDS virus while doing things you wouldn't otherwise do.  

    Teenagers  are  at  an  age  when  trying  different  things is especially 
inviting.  They must understand how serious the drug problem  is  and  how  to 
avoid it.  

    Drugs  are also one of the main ways in which prostitutes become infected. 
They may share needles themselves or have sex with people who  do.  They  then 
can pass the AIDS virus to others.  

    For  information  about  drug  abuse  treatment  programs,   contact  your 
physician,  local public health agency or community AIDS  or  drug  assistance 
group.  


                                AIDS And Babies

    An  infected  woman can give the AIDS virus to her baby before it is born, 
or during birth. If a woman is infected, her child has about one chance in two 
of being born with the virus.  

    If you are considering having a baby,  and think you might  have  been  at 
risk  of  being  infected with the AIDS virus,  even if it was years ago,  you 
should receive counseling and be tested before you get pregnant.  

    You must have a long talk with the person with  whom  you're  planning  to 
have a child.  Even if you have known this person for a long time,  there's no 
way to be sure he or she hasn't been infected in the  past,  possibly  without 
realizing it. That person needs to think hard and decide if an AIDS test might 
be a good idea. So should you.  


                         Talking With Kids About AIDS

    Children hear about AIDS, just as we all do. But they don't understand it, 
so  they  become frightened.  They are worried they or their friends might get 
sick and die.  

    Children need to be told they can't get AIDS from everyday contact in  the 
classroom, cafeteria or bathrooms. They don't have to worry about getting AIDS 
even if one of their schoolmates is infected.  

    Basic health education should be started as early as possible,  in keeping 
with parental and community standards.  Local schools have the  responsibility 
to  see  that  their students know the facts about AIDS.  It is very important 
that middle school students -- those entering their teens --learn  to  protect 
themselves from the AIDS virus.  

     Children must also be taught values and responsibility, as well as skills 
to  help  them  resist peer pressure that might lead to risky behavior.  These 
skills can be reinforced by religious and  community  groups.  However,  final 
responsibility  rests  with  the  parents.  As  a parent,  you should read and 
discuss this brochure with your children.  


                          Helping A Person With AIDS

    If you are one of the growing number of people who  know  someone  who  is 
infected, you need to have a special understanding of the problem.  

    No one will require more support and more love than your friend with AIDS. 
Feel free to offer what you can, without fear of becoming infected.  

    Don't  worry  about  getting AIDS from everyday contact with a person with 
AIDS.  You need to take precautions such as wearing rubber  gloves  only  when 
blood is present.  

    If  you  don't  know  anyone  with  AIDS,  but you'd still like to offer a 
helping hand,  become  a  volunteer.  You  can  be  sure  your  help  will  be 
appreciated by a person with AIDS.  

    This might mean dropping by the supermarket to pick up groceries,  sitting 
with the person a while,  or just being there to talk.  You may even  want  to 
enroll  in  a  support  group  for caregivers.  These are available around the 
country. If you are interested, contact any local AIDS-related organization.  

    Above all, keep an upbeat attitude. It will help you and everyone face the 
disease more comfortably.

       True or False

    6.  People  who  provide  help for someone with AIDS are not personally at 
       risk for getting the disease.  

       True or False


                                    ANSWERS

    1.  True.  It is risky behavior that puts you at risk for AIDS, regardless 
       of any "group" you belong to.  

    2.  A  &  B.  The AIDS virus is not spread by insects,  kissing,  tears or 
       casual contact.  

    3.  True.  However,  the most effective preventive measure against AIDS is 
       not having sex or shooting drugs.  

    4.  True.  You cannot tell by looking if someone is infected. The virus by 
       itself is completely invisible.  Symptoms may first appear years  after 
       you have been infected.  

    5.  True.  You  should be counseled about getting an AIDS test if you have 
       been engaging in risky behavior or think you have been exposed  to  the 
       virus.  There  is  no  reason  to be tested if you don't engage in this 
       behavior.  

    6. True. You won't get AIDS by helping someone who has the disease.  


               The Difference Between Giving And Receiving Blood

    1.  Giving blood.  You are not now,  nor have you ever been in  danger  of 
        getting  AIDS from giving blood at a blood bank.  The needles that are 
        used for blood donations are brand-new.  Once they are used,  they are 
        destroyed.  There  is  no  way you can come into contact with the AIDS 
        virus by donating blood.  

    2.  Receiving blood.  The risk of getting AIDS from  a  blood  transfusion 
        has  been greatly reduced.  In the interest of making the blood supply 
        safe as possible,  donors are screened for risk  factors  and  donated 
        blood  is tested for the AIDS antibody.  Call your local blood bank if 
        you have questions.
