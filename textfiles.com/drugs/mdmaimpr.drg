	From "Ecstasy, The MDMA Story", by Bruce Eisner:

	    MDMA is usually a white crystalline powder.  A reddish or
	    brownish tint is sometimes seen, and indicates the presence of
	    manufacture by-products.  The smell of the powder also gives a
	    clue to these by-products.  The strong smell of solvent
	    indicates that the material still is damp with ether from
	    manufacture, and the smell of sassafras indicates isosafarole
	    that hasn't been converted to MDMA.  However, experience has
	    shown that these two impurities have little impact on the
	    potency of the drug.

	I wouldn't take this as the last word, by no means, on the
	possibilities of contaminants.  In fact, Eisner also recommends
	sending samples to a testing laboratory.  He sites:

	    S.P. Lab, 55426 N.W. 79th Avenue, Miami, Florida 33166.  They
	    ask for a sample wrapped in foil or plastic, enclosed in an
	    envolope, with a slip of paper telling the alleged content, 
	    cost, any undesirable side-effects noticed, $25.00 per sample,
	    and a five-digit number to identify the sample.  After 14 days, 
	    call (305) 757-2566 for the result.
