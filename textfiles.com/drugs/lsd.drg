---------------------------------------
 1. Grind up 150 grams of baby Hawaiian
    wood rose seeds
 2. In 130cc of petroleum ether, soak
    seeds for 2 days
 3. Filter solution thru a tight screen
 4. Throw away liquid and allow the 
    seed mush to dry
 5. For 2 days allow the mush to soak 
    in 110cc of wood alcohol
 6. Filter the solution again saving
    the liquid and labelling it #1
 7. Re-soak the mush in 110cc of wood
    alcohol for 2 days
 8. Filter and throw away the mush
 9. Add the liquid from the second soak
    to the solution labeled #1
10. Pour the liquid into a cookie tray
    and let it evaporate
11. When the liquid has evaporated, a
    yellow gum remains
12. Scrape the yellow stuff into 
    capsules.
Order the seeds from a wholesaler 
>only<!!!! Cuz other seeds may have tox-ic chemicals in 'em. You can get the
seeds used in the solution from:
      Chong's Nursery & Flowers
      P.O. Box 2154
      Honolulu, Hawaii
I couldn't find out the zip code so callthe operator and get it from her.

Later...   and get wasted!
