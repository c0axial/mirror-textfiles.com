MAKING LSD
------ ---
           
                                       
   Common LSD, being of the strangest drugs, available to people on the
black market, is not too hard to make in your average run-of-the-mill
kitchen. LSD (Lysergic acid Diethylamide) is a complex organic mixure that
gives some people (most) a trip to the moon or other nearby celestial
body.


ITEMS NEEDED:
----- ------
 
1-About 200-250 grams of MORNING GLORY SEEDS or BAY HAWAIIAN WOOD ROSE   
SEEDS. The Morning Glory seeds can be obtained at most plant nurseries.   

2-200 cc. of petroleum ether

3-Small piece of window screen or a strainer

4-A couple of large glasses           

5-cookie tray (an old one, never to be used again)

6-260 cc. of wood alcohol (call your local drug store).                     

7-Capsule containers (jel)

=========================================================================

Let's get started:
 
1.  Grind up about 170 grams of Morning Glory Seeds.                   

2.  In 145 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two or three days.

3.  With screen, filter the liquid thru it and save the seed mush and 
allow it to dry completely.

4.  Let the mush soak in 130 cc. of 
wood alcohol.

5.  Filter solution again only.  Save the liquid in a large glass jar.

6.  Soak the seed mush again in 130 cc. of wood alcohol for two more days. 

7.  Filter out the mush and keep the liquid.  Now, get the liquid that was
saved in step 5.

8.  Now, pour both liquids in a cookie tray and let it dry.                   

9.  When all the liquid has dried, a yellowish gummy looking substance will
appear on the cookie sheet.        

10. Take the yellow gum and put this into capsules.

=========================================================================

You can get the capsules just by buying something like DEXITRIM or some 
other pill.  Even CONTACT comes in jel capsules.  Just empty them out and     
put the yellow gum in the capsules.  Allow the capsules to sit over night   
for best results.
