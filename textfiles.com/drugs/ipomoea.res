The main psychotomimetic constituent of the seeds of both species
[Ipomoea tricolor & Rivea corymbosa] are ergine (d-delta-lysergic acid
amide) and isoergine (d-delta-isolysergic acid amide) which occur together
with minor alkaloids: chanoclavine, elymoclavine, and lysergol.
Ergometrine appears to be present in the seeds of I. violacea, but
absent in R. corymbosa. The total alkaloid content of R. corymbosa seed
is 0.012% ; of I. violacea, 0.06% - and, indeed Indians use smaller quantities
of the latter than of the former.

I. violacea, often referred to by it's synonyms I. rubro-caerulea and
I. tricolor, is represented in horticulture by a number of "varieties,"
such as: Heavenly Blue, Pearly Gates, Flying Saucers, Wedding Bells,
Summer Skies, and Blue Stars - all of which contain the hallucinogenic
ergot alkaloids.

"The main constituent of the seeds of Rivea corymbosa is ergine or d-lysergic
acid amide. Minor alkaloids present are the related d-isolysergic acid amide
(isoergine), chanoclavine, elymoclavine and lysergol. The seeds of Ipomoea
violacea have a similar composition, but instead of lysergol, they have
ergometrine (ergonovine). Later, very minor amounts of two alkaloids
ergometrinine and penniclavine - were found in I. violacea by chromatography.
the total alkaloid content of the seeds of Ipomoea violacea is approximately
five times as great as that of the seeds of Rivea corymbosa: 0.06% in the
former; 0.012% in the latter. This difference in the alkaloid content
explains why Indians employ smaller doses of seeds of the Ipomoea than of the
Rivea.

Seeds of various Morning Glories contain
 Ergolines:  ergine,isoergine,ergonovine
 Glucosides: turbicoryn [apparently in Rivea corymbosa only]

called Tlitlitzen (Aztec word for "The Divine Black One")
to the Aztecs, Black is a "hot" color,
a property of psychotropics associated with light

The investigation of a third magic drug, ololiuqui, took an unexpected turn.
Ololiuqui [also called coaxihuitl (Aztec), badoh (Zapotec), yucu-yaha
(Mixtec), xtabentum (Maya), flor de la Virgen, yerba del las serpientes
(Spanish), snake plant, etc.] is a green twining herb of three species of the
wild American morning glory, with long white blossoms and round brown (badoh)
or black (badoh negro) seeds. The priests ate this plant to induce visions
and satanic hallucinations, believed to have been messages from the gods. The
patients of professional soothsayers (piuleros) drank alcoholic beverages
(pulque, aguardiente, etc.) containing the crushed seeds; in the ensuing
sleepy-narcotic state they revealed information about themselves that the
piulero could use to forecast the client's future or prescribe for his
illness. The brown seeds have been identified as Rivea corymbosa; the black
seeds, as Ipomoea violacea.
