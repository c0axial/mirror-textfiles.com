How To Make LSD (Kitchen)
-------------------------

[1> Grind up 150 grams of morning glory seeds or Hawaiian wood rose seeds.
[2> In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
[3> Filter the solution through a tight screen.
[4> Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
[5> For two days allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alcohol.
[6> Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it "1".
[7> Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of wood alcohol for two days.
[8> Filter and throw away the mush.
[9> Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled "1".
[10> Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evaporate.
[11> When all the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains. This should
     be scraped up and put into capsules.
     30 grams of morning glory seeds = one trip
     15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = one trip
Many companies, such as Northop-King, have been coating their seeds with a
toxic chemical, which is poison. Order seeds from a wholesaler, as it is
much safer and cheaper. Hawaiian wood rose seeds can be ordered directly from:
