The 5-hydroxy derrivative of DMT, bufotenine, or N,N-dimethyl-serotonin,
is another naturally occuring tryptamine found to occur in South
American Snuffs (also Bufo). Intravenours administration of of
bufotenine was reported by Fabing and co-workers (59,60) to be 
hallucinogenic in man. THis finding is in conflict with a later
report by Turner and Merlis (253). Apparantly, due to its low
lipid solubility (65), bufotenine does not readily cross the
blood-brain barrier (64,183). The initial observations made by
Fabing et.al. (59,60) may be the result of peripheral toxic
manifestations.
	Bufotenine has been found to be behviourally inactive,
or only weakly active in most animals studies...
