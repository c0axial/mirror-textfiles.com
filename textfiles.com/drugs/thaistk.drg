Congratulations, you have just described Thai Stick to a T.  Ah, what
memories that brings back!  In this area it was popular (and more or less
available) until the late 70's.  *Sigh*  Those were the days.

	Reports of Thai Stick being dipped in opium are apocryphal.
	I know of no studies that verify that Thai Stick has ever been
	dipped in opium, and I suspect that these rumors were a result
	of people not believing that marijuana could be that potent unless
	something else were added.
