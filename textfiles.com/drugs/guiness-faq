There has been much posted about Guinness to this group, and much
of it could be used to spawn a new group alt.guinness.folklore.
I find a great deal of irony in this:  there is probably more
"folklore" about Guinness than any other beer, yet it was the
Guinness people that underwrote the famous "Book of Records" to
settle arguments often based on rumours rather than fact.  So, in
an attempt to "set the record straight" I offer:

"No other brewery uses as much roasted barley as Guinness, which
prepares its own."  (MJBC, p 181)
 
"The brewery...uses several varieties (of hops), among which
Goldings are perhaps the most influential." (MJBC, pp 180-181)
 
<In an earlier thread, someone claimed that Guinness used hops
from Texas.  There is no such mention of hops from Texas in MJBC,
but I am willing to be convinced.  However, the Extra Stout that
used to be brewed at the Park Royal Brewery in London used
"English and American whole hops"  RADA. p 163>
 
Guinness "...uses its original yeast, though this has been
selected down from several strains to one, which was arrived at
in about 1960.  It works at high temperatures (around 25'C/77'F),
and it is very dispersed, having neither risen to the top nor
sunk to the bottom, when it is removed by centrifuge."  (MJBC, pp
181)
 
"Dublin makes five or six principal versions of Guinness, in a
total of 19 variations, and exports around 40 percent of its
output." (MJBC, p 181)
 
All the grain used by Guinness is grown in Ireland.  The non-malt
grains used in the domestic product is 25% flaked barley and 10%
roasted barley. (MJBC p 181)
 
 
                       II.  Guinness FAQs
 
Q:   I've seen Guinness sold in Germany even when the
     Reinheitsgebot applied to imported beers.  How can that be?
 
A:   "In line with the German Purity Law, the barley is replaced
     with pale and roasted malt in Continental Europe." (MJBC p
     181)
 
Q:   What types of Guinness are there?
 
A:   MJ states 5 or 6 main types in 19 variations.  So far, we've
     been able to identify (Detailed specifications are listed in
     the last section of this FAQ):
 
     Draught Guinness (Ireland, NA), is smooth full-bodied and
          creamy.  Despite its body, it is a rather mild beer (OG
          1039, 3.4% abw, 4.2% abv).  This beer is pasteurized.
          There are many local variations of this product.  The
          canned "Pub Draught Guinness" using the draught-flow
          (tm) system is a packaged version of this beer.
 
     Bottle Conditioned Guinness (Ireland) had similar
          specifications to the Draught Guinness, but the
          presence of the yeast provides for a "...spicier,
          fruitier, drier, more complex and lively, fresh
          character." (MJBC, 182)
 
     Bottled Guinness (Britain) has similar specifications to the
          above two beers, but it is pasteurized.
 
     All Malt Guinness (Continental Europe) is available both
          draught and bottled.  It is slightly stronger and also
          has a little more of the characteristic stout bite.
 
     Guinness Extra Stout/Guinness Original (bottled, available
          widely) is stronger with even more stout bite.  MJ
          reports this to be 4.8% abw, 6.0% abv, but one poster
          says that in advertising from Guinness Imports, the
          strength is listed as 5.6%.  This product is licensed
          for production widely around the world.
 
     There is a strong bottled version (Belgium and others) that
          is somewhat sweeter and stronger (7.5% abv)
 
     Foreign Extra Stout (primarily tropical countries) is also
          about 7.5% abv.  However, this is blend of Guinnesses,
          included one aged for three months.
 
     In Nigeria, which bans barley, Guinness is made from
     sorghum.
 
Q:   What do the numbers on the Guinness labels mean and why
     isn't there a set of numbers on the Pub Draught (tm) cans?
 
A:   We are still looking into this, but we believe there are
     licence numbers for the different styles of Guinness,  We do
     not know why they are not on the Pub Draught (tm) cans.
 
Q:   What is a Black and Tan?
 
A:   Guinness (or some other stout) mixed with another lighter
     coloured beer such as a pale ale or lager.  There is now a
     separate section of this FAQ on Black & Tans.
 
Q:   What is Black Velvet?
 
A:   Guinness and Champagne in equal proportions (MJBC p 176)
 
Q:   How does the draught-flow can work?  What's that plastic
     thing in the can do?
 
A:   The simple, non-technical answer is that the little plastic
     bladder is filled with nitrogen, not nitrous oxide or
     nitrous dioxide as claimed by a couple of posters.  Since
     the can's contents are under pressure, some of the Guinness
     is forced into the plastic bladder through a pin-hole.  When
     the can is opened, the nitrogen and beer mixture is released
     creating the lovely foamy head.
 
     Nitrogen is used because it creates smaller bubbles than
     carbon dioxide, which can also leave a tinny taste.
 
Q:   Where can I get more detailed information on this?
 
A:   Here.  Thanks to Joel Plutchak, who saved this information
     that someone else (unattributed) posted.  (I would be happy
     to give credit to the original poster.  email me)
 
     "The problem has always been the fact that draught Guinness
     is (or should be) dispensed with a mixture of Nitrogen and
     CO2 gasses rather than the conventional CO2 alone.  The
     nitrogen is used because it makes very fine bubbles while it
     is not absorbed into the brew as the CO2 is, thus it does
     not "over-carbonate" the beer.  Also a special faucet is
     preferred which, in combination with the gasses, creates
     that wonderful creamy brown head which lasts to the bottom
     of the glass.  The new can combines the original kegged
     stout recipe with technology which creates the draught
     effect to a tee.
 
     "Dr. Alan Forage, creator of the technology, was on hand to
     explain the mechanics of the new can.  This is the way the
     system works:  The 16.9 ounce can (containing 14.9 ounces of
     beer) is fitted with a small plastic device (Guinness calls
     it a "smoothifier") which sits in the bottom of the can.
     This device has a pocket or cavity which is open to the
     atmosphere via a pin hole in its top.  The can is evacuated
     of oxygen and filled with beer.  Prior to sealing the can, a
     dose of liquid nitrogen is added to the beer.  The can is
     closed and as the liquid nitrogen warms a pressure is
     created.  The pressure forces about 1% of the beer and
     nitrogen into the plastic cavity.   When the can is opened,
     the pressure is released and the small amount of beer in the
     cavity is forced back through the pinhole quite violently.
     The agitation created by this "geyser" mixes the nitrogen
     with the beer in such a way as to reproduce the tap handle
     character.  Open up the first empty can you have in order to
     see what the "smoothifier" looks like."
 
 
Q:   Why does the bottled Guinness taste so different than the
     draught or canned "draught-flow" product?
 
A:   (U.S./Canada answer):  These are two entirely different
     beers.  The bottled Guinness if Guinness Extra Stout, while
     the others are simply Guinness.  The Extra Stout uses more
     roast barley and has somewhat higher IBUs, resulting in a
     harsher, sharper flavour.  Which you prefer is a matter of
     personal taste.
 
     (Ireland answer):  The bottled product is bottle
     conditioned, meaning the presence of live yeast.  The yeast
     gives it a very different character.
 
Q:   What's the significance of the harp symbol on Guinness
     products?
 
A:   Arthur Guinness & Sons deliberately chose the harp symbol as
     its logo or symbol to appeal to nationalist pride in
     Ireland.  The harp is also a symbol of Ireland.
 
Q:   What products besides the various Guinnesses does Guinness
     produce?
 
A:   Arthur Guinness & Sons also own Smithwicks (pronounced
     without the "w") and Harp lager.
 
Q:   What do the numbers on the Guinness labels mean?
 
A:   We don't exactly know, but we are working on this.  They may
     be product codes, or license numbers.
     ejoynt@whoi.edu (Ernest H. Joynt, III) offered the following
     information:
 
     Guinness Extra Stout (purchased in the US)
          L/A1    821212
     Guinness Foreign Extra Stout (made in Trinidad)
          L/AU    771712
     Guinness Special Export Stout (8.0% abv, made in Dublin)
          A/RM    571012
 
     The letters and numbers preceding the six-digit number are
     actually written with the first letter over the other two.
     For example, the Guinness Extra Stout is "L over A1".
 
     The Pub Draught Guinness (tm) does not have this type of
     numbering on the can.
 
Q:   Is the Guinness family still involved with the Guinness
     company?
 
A:   The family still has a large financial stake in Arthur
     Guinness & Son PLC, but have not been directly involved in
     the management since 1992.
 
Q:   I've heard that Guinness contains oysters.  Is that true?
 
A:   No.  At one time, oyster shell may have been used as finings
     to rid the beer of unwanted solids, but this was not in this
     century, and may not have ever been done by Guinness.  There
     are oyster stouts that contain oyster, oyster extracts, etc.
 
Q:   Doesn't Guinness contain oatmeal?
 
A:   No.  It is a rather common misconception that Guinness (and
     all other stouts) contain oatmeal.  Oatmeal Stout is a
     distinctive style stout.  The revivalist of this style was
     Samuel Smith's Brewery in Yorkshire, England, at the request
     of its North American agent, Merchant du Vin of Seattle.
 
Q:   How does one spell Guinness?
 
A:   Never!  That's a waste of nectar!  Oh, Sorry.  I thought you
     said "spill".
 
     Guinness is spelled exactly as you see in the question --
     two "N's", two "S's" and a "U" before the "I".  The "G" is
     always capitalized.  Unfortunately, it is misspelled in the
     index of the 1991 Pocket Guide to Beer (only one "N").
 
Q:   Doesn't Guinness contain {insert name of animal} {insert
     your favourite word for urine}?
 
A:   No.  It is not part of the formulation, and there is
     virtually no opportunity for this to happen by chance.  We
     cannot be as unequivocal about Labudmilloorsons, however.
     ;-)
 
Q:   Is Guinness really good for you?
 
A:   Medically, possibly.  Its alcohol is low enough to have a
     relaxing effect.  The bottle-conditioned product may produce
     a mild laxative effect due to the live yeast.  Too many
     bottles of the bottle-conditioned product can have an
     extreme laxative and diuretic effect, which is not good for
     you.
 
     There is medical folklore about Guinness and stout, in
     general. "In some countries, stout is seen as an
     aphrodisiac, or as a beneficial bath for newborn babies."
     (MJBC p 177)  Since most research indicates the aphrodisiac
     effects are primarily psychological, there may be truth to
     the former.  Too many may have an adverse affect on
     performance, however.
 
     Of course, if you feel as good as I do after enjoying and
     Guinness, then there is no question that it is good for you!
 
Q:   But isn't Guinness high in calories?
 
A:   Not especially.  "Guinness is not notably high in
     calories..." (MJBC, p 177)  This refers to the draught,
     bottle-conditioned and draught flow (tm) product, which are
     fairly low in alcohol.  Calories in beers come from the
     alcohol and the residual sugars.  The higher the alcohol,
     the higher the caloric content.
 
Q:   What's the proper thing to say when someone {buys you a
     Guinness/ gives you a 4-pack of Draught-flow cans/gives you
     your own cask}?
 
A:   Whale oil beef hooked!  ;->
 
Q:   Is there a Guinness smiley/emoticon?
 
A:   (:-{d) (licking the rich, creamy Guinness foam off the upper
     lip.)
 
 
                      III.  "Black and Tan"
 
Q:   What is a Black & Tan?  What is a Half-and-Half?
 
A:   The answer depends on who you ask.  The all-Guinness Black &
     Tan is Harp's Lager and Guinness.  (Harp's is brewed by
     Guinness at Dundalk).  Many consider the classic Black & Tan
     to be Bass Pale Ale and Guinness.  (To some Irish, they
     appreciate the fact that the Irish comes out on top!)  I've
     been in a pub that used Smithwicks and Guinness.
     (Smithwicks is also owned by Guinness.)  However, there are
     many variations involving a stout or porter and another
     lighter coloured beer, either lager or ale.  The Black & Tan
     name is derived from hunting dogs that had a black and tan
     mottled colouring.  There was also a regiment of British
     soldiers recruited to serve in Ireland after the First World
     War.  They had a reputation for being quite brutal.
 
     A half-and-half is often just another name for a Black &
     Tan.  However, in many North American Irish pubs, the
     Bass/Guinness combination is called a Black & Tan, while the
     Harp/Guinness combination is called a Half-and-Half.
 
     Guinness promotional advertising refers to a Black & Tan as
     being the Bass and Guinness version.  Ken Papai described
     the ads as follows:
 
          Here is the Guinness Import Company (c) 1992 ad on
          their beer card/beer coaster that they distribute at
          pubs and beer shows:
 
 
          THE TRUE COLORS OF HALLOWEEN  (picture of black & tan
                                        in a pint glass)
 
          Guinness                      (picture of a harp, the
                                        Guinness trademark and
                                        logo)
 
          Bass Ale                      (Bass logo)
 
          BLACK & TAN
 
 
     When your bartender is a 240 lb., 6'4" fellow named
     O'Malley, a Black & Tan (or a Half-and-Half) is whatever he
     says it is!
 
Q:   How do I pour a Black and Tan?
 
A:   Steve Glover, who has tended bar in Ireland, says that the
     layered Black and Tan is an American affectation that they
     were happy to do for extra money :-).  Otherwise, both beers
     (they used Smithwicks and Guinness) were simply poured in
     the same glass fully mixed.
 
     If you want a layered drink: Carefully.  Practice.  With a
     special spoon.  There are many answers.
 
     I have had success pouring the Harp or Bass vigorously so
     that it develops a good head.  Using a Black & Tan spoon,
     pour the Guinness slowly over the back of the spoon.  I will
     remain layered for some time.  (You can make your own by
     bending the bowl of a spoon back so that when you lower it
     into the glass, the bowl is concave down.)
 
     The Guinness promotional beer coaster cited above offers the
     following advice:
 
          HOW TO POUR A FRIGHTENLY PERFECT BLACK & TAN
 
          1.   Hold your pint glass at an angle, and fill just
               over halfway with Bass Ale on tap.
 
          2.   Slow the flow control on the Draught Guinness tap
               down to a trickle.
 
          3.   Fill to the top, letting Draught Guinness hit the
               side of the glass.
 
                              or...
 
               Pour Draught Guinness over an upside-down spoon to
               disperse the flow.
 
          4.   Let settle, and enjoy the True Colors of
               Halloween!
 
Q:   Why does the Guinness float on top of the other beer?
 
A:   "Quality always rises to the top" (Jon Binkley)
 
Q:   Should I order a Black & Tan in Dublin?
 
A:   Some have posted that this is not advisable, as you might
     stir up tempers.  Steve Glover posts that ordering a Black
     and Tan is no problem.
