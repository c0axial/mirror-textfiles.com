Cooking With Hash
-----------------
        Hash is also an excellent way to enhance your cooking. It has had a
long history in the kitchen, going all the way back to the early civilizations
around the Ganges River. It is also noted that many famous personalities
throughout history had experiences with hashish. Marco Polo on his return to
Italy mentioned frequently in his diary a strange substance that put a man in 
a drunkenlike stupor, yet it was unlike anything he had experienced before.

Hash Cookies
------------
4 cups sifted flour                     1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder                1/2 cup butter
4 eggs                                  3/4 cup honey

Mix baking powder, salt, and flour together in a bowl, then add to this the
eggs and honey. Work the mixture with your hands until it forms a dough.
Roll the dough out and cut into three-inch squares. Now put dough aside and
work on the filling.
1/2 cup chopped dates                   1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup raisins                         1 whole grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground ginger                1/8 oz. powdered hash
1 teaspoon cinnamon                     1 cup chopped figs
1/2 cup ground almonds                  1/2 cup ground walnuts

Put  all the ingredients into a pan and mix with 1/2 cup water. Heat until
fruits are softened and water has evaporated. Pour mixture into a skillet, add
three tablespoons butter, and heat for five minutes. The filling is now ready.
Place a heaping tablespoon of filling on each piece of pastry. Fold up the
edges of the pastry, to keep the filling in, and bake at 350 degrees for about
25 minutes. This recipe usually makes between two and three dozen cookies.

Hash Soup
---------
3 eggs                                  1 teaspoon powdered hashish
2 oz. sifted flour                      2 oz. small noodles
1/4 can cooked peas                     4 tablespoons canned tomato paste
1/2 cup chopped chicken livers          1/2 cup chopped turnip
1/2 cup chopped onion

Take a large pot and grease the bottom with 1/4 cup olive oil. Place in the
pot the half chopped onions, chicken livers, and turnip. Cook for half hour
over low heat. Now add a pint and a half of water, three tablespoons butter,
four tablespoons tomato paste, the peas, and the noodles. Mix flour with a
cup of water and make a paste. Stir paste and powdered hash into the pot. Add
salt and pepper, and boil for 15 minutes, stirring constantly. As soon as the
soup is off the fire, add the eggs and serve immediately.

Hash Brown Bananas
------------------ 
4 bananas                               2 slices bacon
2 teaspoons powdered hash               4 tablespoons brown sugar

Cut the bananas into a skillet and fry until slightly brown. Do not overcook.
At the same time, fry the bacon in the same pan, for it adds an interesting
flavor to the bananas. Mix the powdered hash with the brown sugar. Then wrap
each fried banana with a strip of bacon, and serve with hash and brown sugar
sprinkled on top.

Hashish Brownies
----------------
1/2 teaspoon salt                       1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup cake flour                      3 eggs
1 cup sugar                             1/2 cup sweet butter
3 oz. unsweetened chocolate             5 grams powdered hash

Melt the chocolate and butter together, then add sugar and hash. The mixture
must be beaten until it is creamy. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt
together, and then add to mixture. Pour the mixture into a cookie tray and
bake for thirty minutes at 375 degrees. When cool, cut brownies into small
squares and top with chopped nuts.
