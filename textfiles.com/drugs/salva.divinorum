                               SALVIA DIVINORUM
                              "Pipiltzintzintli"
                            Mint family (Labiatae)


A woody  perenial  herb 4 to 6 feet tall  with  square,  hollows stems.  The
leaves are dark green, 6 to 8 inches long, with toothed edges.  The  flowers 
are blue or white on spikes.  Only  found  in  cultivated by sorcerers in an 
isolated area in southern Mexico.

                         
                          Cultivation and Propagation
                         
Is is propagated in much the same  manner as coleus.  It needs a loose, rich 
soil.  Is is best grown as a tub  plant and brought indoors when the weather
begins to cool.  It may be grown outdoors  in frost-free areas.  This salvia 
is generally grown from cuttings, but I know of one instance in which it was 
grown from seed.  The  seed  should be germinated in the same way as coleus.  
Cuttings  should  be  taken  in spring, after the plant has had alot of sun.  
Cut  1/2-inch  below  a  node  and root in no more than an inch of water.  A 
pinch of rootone may be added to  the water and shaken to dissolve it.  This 
will help prevent stem rot and will  stimulate  rooting.  When the roots are 
1/4-inch long  the  cutting  should be potted.  Longer roots may be damaged.  
Plant in a 2-inch pot with good potting soil.  Grows rapidly after the roots 
are established.  I have found that this plant is susceptible to stem rot if 
over-watered.  It is often attacked by aphids, white flies, spider mites and 
mealy bugs.

                                  Harvesting

Harvesting  the  leaves  for  use  as a hallucinogen should not be attempted 
until one has at least four one-year-old plants.  An equal  number of leaves 
should be harvested from each plant so that  the shock to one plant will not 
be great.  Dosage may vary; begin with 10-20 fresh leaves.  fresh leaves are 
used, as the active  principle  is believed to be unstable.  Considering the 
rarity of  the  plant,  the leaves should be chewed, because when the juices 
are expressed much of the active principle is wasted.
