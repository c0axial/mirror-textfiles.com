Prepration of A. muscaria

This method is not something simply read from a book and passed along. 
It is a tried and true method (by myself an many others).  This 
wonderful carpophore has a oddly dangerous "taboo" surrounding it which 
is undeserved.  Granted, it does contain some toxins.  These have been 
HIGHLY overemphasized, *PLUS* there has been a great deal of 
misinformation about this mushroom (and its species cousins.).  This is 
due to a number of reasons which I will try to make clear here. 
   
First; the procedure.  
Make sure the cap to stem ratio is kept about 3:1, the same as it is 
found per mushroom in the natural state.  Dry on screen in the oven on 
the lowest setting with door cracked open.  This only takes an hour or 
so at most.  Render into a powder in a small electric coffee or spice 
grinder/mill; the finer the better.  I try to attain a powder size like 
baking powder and certainly finer than coffee.  This WILL NOT affect 
the activity of the end product, it only makes ingestion more 
difficult.  Use around 1 cup water per dose and start with a bit more 
than this to allow for evaporation during processing.   
The lower end dose/person is 8 grams dried and the upper end is 15 to 
20 grams dried.  What follows is the most important part of the entire 
ritual of preparation.  Bring the water up to within a few degrees of 
190 degress (F).  Use a high quality candy thermometer or better yet, a 
lab thermometer.  This temperature shouldn't vary more than 22 degrees 
on the upper end.  A little simmering won't kill it, but it is an 
indication that one has reached at least 212.  You'll find stirring 
lowers the temperature very quickly, but it's best to keep a close eye 
on things throughout.  Once 190 has been reached, stir in the powered 
material and leave to steep at least 30 minutes.  I usually leave it 
there for at least 1/2 hour to 3/4 hour, stirring frequently. 
Allow to cool until warm enough to drink.  That's all there is to it! 
   
The active principle in A. muscaria was, until quite recently, thought 
to be muscarine.  Dr. Albert Hofmann and Dr. Richard Schultes have 
discovered, in tandem with Dr. Eugster in Switzerland and Dr. Takemoto 
in Japan,  MAINLY ibotenic acid and muscimole as the active 
principles.  The ibotenic acid fraction is converted, via the 
refluxing in water, into muscimole.  Inconsequential amounts of other 
alkaloids ARE present, but largely inactive mentally. 
Muscarine IS the TOXIN of this mushroom, which is converted to 
muscimole during the reflux as well.  It remains intact in the raw 
mushroom, however! 
Part of the reasons behind the medical misinformation surrounding A. 
muscaria is due to the fact that many people who have presented to 
physicians with stated "mushroom poisoning" were generally thought to 
have ingested A. phallodies.  They then usually promptly administer 
atropine, which would be fine if one HAD INDEED ingested this toxic 
mushroom.  But it only exacerbates toxic effects of the raw A. muscaria 
several hundred fold, sometimes resulting in the death of the patient 
(and this only infrequently..)  Known deaths recorded from it are rare. 
These have usually been children who ate HUGE amounts of the RAW 
mushroom.  One child died only after eating almost two dozen large 
raw specimens.  

Abstain from ALL OTHER drugs for 24 hours previous to ingestion, with 
the exception of sativa/indica or tobacco.  Likewise during the entire 
experience and 8 or so after.  From 1/2 to 1 1/2 hours after ingestion 
(preferably on an empty stomach) you will begin to get drowsy.  You may 
notice (on higher doses), slightly blurred vision, watery eyes and/or a 
bit of a runny nose.  One will begin to feel increasingly relaxed.  At 
this point it is important to lie down in a area where you will not be 
disturbed and sleep. 
This stage is critical.  I find a alchemical analogy of the body, in 
this case being the alembic, in which the crude product is transformed 
into the purest soma.  Dreaming can be EXTREMELY intense, and sometimes 
the transition from dreaming to what seems a clear and lucid dream upon 
awakening presents itself.  Awakening and arising is like a caterpillar 
methmorphosizing into a butterfly.  This is not like anything else. 
It is mostÿcertainly NOT like psilocybin!  The more you become familar 
with the glorious qualities, the better the symbiosis between the two 
of you will be.  Superior pain relief, floating euphoria, effortless 
movement and general feelIngs of peace and well beIng.  Another thing I 
noticed is the almost complete and effortless quieting of the "internal 
chatter" inside my mind.  My friend, Triple Six, and I both agreed that 
it lends itself perfectly to long periods of meditation.   
These are all at the 8 to 10 gram level. 
Above that (which one should have a non-ingesting guide; but I suppose 
if I need to be telling anybody that, they shouldn't even be 
contemplating this anyway) one may experience out-of-body experiences, 
seeing and communicating with praternatural entities, unity with the 
object of ones attention, ESP, feelings of flying and many differing 
types of ecstacy. 
   
Today, this mushroom is totally legal.  Don't frivolously abuse it, and 
it will probably remain that way.  It is unique in that it doesn't lend 
itself to abuse by ignorant, impulsive, impatient and/or irresponsible 
people.  It seems to have a built in safeguard in that it requires the 
user to follow a few more rules and attend to more detail in order to 
achieve success.  If not used correctly, it screens out others by 
making them so sick, they are in no hurry to repeat the experience.  
Used incorrectly, it is uncomfortable at best and dangerous at worst. 
Used correctly, it is pleasurable at its worst and limitlessly 
creative, intensely ecstatic, universally benefical and incredibly 
healing at its best!
