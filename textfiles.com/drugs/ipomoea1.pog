   Common Name: Badoh Negro, Piule, Tlitlitlzen
Botanical Name: Ipomoea violacea L.
         Usage: Oaxaca, southern Mexico. Known to Aztecs as Tlitliltzen
                and employed in the same way as Ololiuqui, Ipomoea is
                called Piule by the Chinantec and Mazatec, and Badoh Negro
                by the Zapotec.
                In southern Mexico this vine is respected as one of the
                principal hallucinogens for use in divination,
                magico-religious and curing rituals.
   Preparation: A drink is prepared from about a thimbleful of the
                crushed seeds.
       Effects: The alkaloid content is 5 times that of Turbina corymbosa:
                accordingly the natives use fewer seeds. The same alkaloids
                are found in other Morning Glories, but usage is restricted
                to Mexico (see Ololiuqui)

   Common Name: Ololiuqui, Badoh

Botanical Name: Turbina corymbosa [synonym: Rivea corymbosa]

       History: The seeds of this Morning Glory, formerly known as Rivea
                corymbosa, are valued as one of the major sacred
                hallucinbogens of numerous Indian groups in southern Mexico.
                Their use goes back to early periods, and they were important
                in Aztec ceremonies as an intoxicant and as a magic potion
                with reputedly analgesic properties.

         Usage: At the present time small round seeds are utilized in
                divination and witchcraft by Chinantec, Mazatec, Zapotec, and
                others and, as has been recently stated, "today in almost all
                villages of Oaxaca one finds seeds still serving the natives
                as an ever-present help in the time of trouble."

   Preparation: The seeds, which must be collected by the person who is to be
                treated, are ground by a virgin on a metate, water is added
                and then the drink is filtered. The patient drinks it at
                night in a quiet, secluded space.

       Effects: Ergoline alkaloids were found to be the psychoactive
                principles, lysergic acid amide and lysergic acid
                hydroxyethylamide, closely related to the potent hallucinogen
                LSD, being the most important constituents.
