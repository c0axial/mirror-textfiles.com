
Here, I'll start with Twain's third category of misinformation, statistics.
This is from Rick Blum's _Students_and_Drugs_, Library of Congress Call Number
73-75936, page 78.
     
Distribution of Grade Points
     
Drug              Non-Users             Users
     
Tobacco                3.0                2.8
Alcohol                3.5                2.8
Amphetamines           2.7                2.8
Sedatives              2.8                2.85
Tranquilizers          2.8                3.0
Marijuana              2.8                2.75
Hallucinogens          2.8                2.9
Opiates                2.6                2.72
Special substances     2.6                2.7
     
I suppose the point of this is that if you're going to do any drugs at all,
drop acid.
     
Does that make sense?
