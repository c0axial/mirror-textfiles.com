Glasses:

   Use frshly washed glassware.  Place glasses face down on a thin towel for
drying.  Use a stemmed glass for cocktails served with no ice so that the hand
holding the glass will not warm the drink.


Frosting A Glass:

   Keep in a refrigerator (or bury in shaved ice) until glass is frosted.  To
"sugar-frost" a glass, wet the rim of a pre-chilled glass with lime or lemon
then dip into powdered sugar, or salt per recipe.


Chilling A Glass:

   Refrigerate or fill each glass with shaved or crushed ice before mixing.
Shake out the melted ice before pouring the drink.


Shaking and Blending:

   Drinks containing fruit juices, sugar, eggs, cream, etc.  should be well
shaken.  To attain a frothy quality, use an electric blender.  Also use a
blender for punches, sours and fruit and egg drinks.


Stirring:

   Stir drinks with clear liquors including ice.  Stir drinks containing a
carbonated mixer very gently.  Don't stir liqueurs.


Adding Sugar:

   Sugar should be put in the mixing glass first, then add the liquor.
Powdered sugar is best used with alcohol because it dissolves easily with
alcohol at low temperatures.  Some bartenders prefer syrup because it blends
instantly.  Store syrup in bottles and keep cool.  If you want to make your
own, here's how:  dissolve one pound of granulated sugar in one-half pint of
hot water.  Stir slowly adding water to make desired quantity (usually one
pint).


Using Ice:

   Ice goes into the mixing glass, shaker or drinking glass before drink.  Use
cubes, as a rule, for old- fashioneds, highballs, or any on-the- rocks drinks.
Cracked or cubed ice is best for stirring and shaking.	Crushed or shaved ice
for frappes and other tall drinks or for sipping drinks through straws.


Bitters:

   Only a dash or two.	Made from combinations of roots, bark, berries and
herbs.	They are aromatic and bitter in taste.	The four brands below are most
popula:.  ANGOSTURA BITTERS-made in Trinidad ABBOTT'S AGED BITTERS-made in
Baltimore PEYCHAUD'S BITTERS-made in New Orleans ORANGE BITTERS-made in England


Twist or Peel:

   When using a twist of lemon peel, rub outer skin of peel around the rim of
the glass to coat it with its natural oil.  Add some of its oil to the drink by
twisting the peel over the glass.  Then add the peel itself.


Fruit or Juices:

   Wash fruit first.  Slices should be 3/8 inch thick and slit up the center to
saddle on rim of glass.  Keep garnished on a bed of ice or in a cool place.  In
drinks containing fruit juices, you must pour the liquor in last.


Serving Beer:

   Chill beer like champagne; surround with ice cubes and turn gently a few
times.	Don't serve it too cold for it goes flat.  Don't shake bottle or can
before opening.  Open gently to prevent gushing.  Once opened, serve promptly!
Don't tilt glass to allow beer to slide slowly down side!  Instead, pour beer
into center of glass, holding bottle or can at a high angle until a head comes
up.  Then pour beer more slowly.  Most people prefer a firm head, about 1 inch
deep.


Eggs:

   To separate the white of an egg from its yolk, crack open on the edge of the
glass, then shift the yolk back and forth from one half shell to the other
until all the white drops into the glass.  Always put the egg into the mixing
glass before the liquor.  When shaker is used include (cubed or cracked) ice to
help blend the egg with the other ingredients.


Serving:

   When serving the same cocktail for more than one, mix the drinks in one
batch.	Set up all the glasses in a row and partially fill each glass (half).
Then go back and top off each glass.


To Flame Liquor:
(Brandy, Rum, Gin, Whiskey)

   Prewarm the glass, vessel, and liquor.  First preheat one spoon of liquor
over a flame and set afire.  Then pour flaming liquor carefully into remainder.
It will set the rest aflame.


The Strainer:

   Strain cocktails into serving glasses with a wire strainer.


Vermouth:

   Vermouth is a white appetizer wine.	It is often flavored with about 40
different herbs, roots, berries, flowers, and seeds.  There are many vermouth
brand labels, each with its own formula.  The dry (French) has a light gold
color and has a nutty flavor.  Sweet (Italian) vermouth has a more syrupy
quality.  Keep bottle corked or it will go stale.
