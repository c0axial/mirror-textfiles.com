          AGING AND ALCOHOL ABUSE                                               
                                                                                
                                                                                
Alcohol abuse among older men and women is a more                               
serious problem than people generally realize.  Until recently                  
older problem drinkers tended to be ignored by both health                      
professionals and the general public.  The neglect occurred                     
for several reasons: our elderly population was small and                       
few were identified as alcoholics, chronic problem drinkers                     
(those who abused alcohol off and on for most of their                          
lives) often died before old age; and, because they are                         
often retired or have fewer social contacts, older people                       
have often been able to hide drinking problems.                                 
                                                                                
Some families may unknowingly "encourage" drinking in                           
older family members if they have the attitude that drinking                    
should be tolerated because older people have only a                            
limited time left and therefore should be allowed to "enjoy"                    
themselves.                                                                     
                                                                                
As more people learn that alcohol problems can be                               
successfully treated at any age, more are willing to seek                       
help to stop drinking.                                                          
                                                                                
Physical Effects of Alcohol                                                     
                                                                                
Alcohol slows down brain activity.  It impairs mental                           
alertness, judgment, physical coordination, and reaction                        
time -- increasing the risk of falls and accidents.                             
                                                                                
Over time, heavy drinking can cause permanent damage to                         
the brain and central nervous system, as well as to the                         
liver, heart kidneys, and stomach.                                              
                                                                                
Alcohol can affect the body in unusual ways, making                             
certain medical problems difficult to diagnose.  For                            
example, the effects of alcohol on the cardiovascular                           
system (the heart and blood vessels) can mask pain, which                       
may otherwise serve as a warning sign of heart attack.                          
Alcoholism can also produce symptoms similar to those of                        
dementia -- forgetfulness, reduced attention, confusion.  If                    
incorrectly identified, such symptoms may lead to                               
unnecessary institutionalization.                                               
                                                                                
Alcohol, itself a drug, mixes unfavorably with many other                       
drugs, including those sold by prescription and those                           
bought over-the-counter.  In addition, use of prescription                      
drugs may intensify the older person's reaction to alcohol,                     
leading to more rapid intoxication.  Alcohol can dangerously                    
slow down performance skills (driving, walking, etc.),                          
impair judgment, and reduce alertness when taken with                           
drugs such as:                                                                  
                                                                                
*   "Minor" tranquilizers: Valium (diazepam), Librium                           
    (chlordiazepoxide), Miltown (meprobamate), and                              
    others.                                                                     
                                                                                
*   "Major" tranquilizers: Thorazine (chlorpromazine),                          
    Mellaril (thioridazine), and others.                                        
                                                                                
*   Barbiturates: Luminal (phenobarbital) and others.                           
                                                                                
*   Pain killers: Darvon (propoxyphene), Demerol                                
    (meperidine), and others.                                                   
                                                                                
*   Antihistamines: both prescription and over-the-                             
    counter forms found in cold remedies.                                       
                                                                                
Use of alcohol can cause other drugs to be metabolized                          
more rapidly, producing exaggerated responses.  Such                            
drugs include: anticonvulsants (Dilantin), anticoagulants                       
(Coumadin), and antidiabetes drugs (Orinase).                                   
                                                                                
In some people, aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach                       
and intestines.  Alcohol also irritates the stomach and can                     
aggravate this bleeding.  The combination of alcohol and                        
diuretics can reduce blood pressure in some individuals,                        
producing dizziness.                                                            
                                                                                
Anyone who drinks -- even moderately -- should check with                       
a doctor or pharmacist about possible drug interactions.                        
                                                                                
Who Becomes a Problem Drinker?                                                  
                                                                                
In old age, problem drinkers seem to be one of two types.                       
The first are chronic abusers, those who have used alcohol                      
heavily throughout life.  Although most chronic abusers die                     
by middle age, some survive into old age.  Approximately                        
two-thirds of older alcoholics are in this group.                               
                                                                                
The second type begins excessive drinking late in life, often                   
in response to "situational" factors -- retirement, lowered                     
income, declining health, and the deaths of friends and                         
loved ones.  In these cases, alcohol is first used for                          
temporary relief but later becomes a problem.                                   
                                                                                
Detecting Drinking Problems                                                     
                                                                                
Not everyone who drinks regularly or heavily is an alcohol                      
abuser, but the following symptoms frequently indicate a                        
problem:                                                                        
                                                                                
*   Drinking to calm nerves, forget worries, or reduce                          
    depression.                                                                 
                                                                                
*   Loss of interest in food.                                                   
                                                                                
*   Gulping drinks and drinking too fast.                                       
                                                                                
*   Lying about drinking habits.                                                
                                                                                
*   Drinking alone with increasing frequency.                                   
                                                                                
*   Injuring oneself, or someone else, while intoxicated.                       
                                                                                
*   Getting drunk often (more than three or four times in                       
    the past year).                                                             
                                                                                
*   Needing to drink increasing amounts of alcohol to                           
    get the desired effect.                                                     
                                                                                
*   Frequently acting irritable, resentful, or unreasonable                     
    during nondrinking periods.                                                 
                                                                                
*   Experiencing medical, social, or financial problems                         
    that are caused by drinking.                                                
                                                                                
Getting Help                                                                    
                                                                                
Older problem drinkers and alcoholics have an unusually                         
good chance for recovery because they tend to stay with                         
treatment programs for the duration.                                            
                                                                                
Getting help can begin with a family doctor or member of                        
the clergy; through a local health department or social                         
services agency; or with one of the following organizations:
