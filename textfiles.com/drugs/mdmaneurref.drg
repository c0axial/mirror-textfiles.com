Thank you for the references.  Unfortunately, these studies seem to
be mostly concerned with the mechanism of axonal damage and not the relevance
of high dose regimens to human use.  Thus, while they are informative
articles they don't address the issue being disputed: whether MDMA is safe 
in humans.

Why not cite the few human studies which exist?  Like the L-Tryptophan
challenges and the spinal taps.  And why not cite the literature
which discusses the relevance of these studies to humans?  Like
Ricaurte's writings on fenfluramine or Charles Grob's writings on
MDMA.

Note the phrase "axon degeneration."  The lack of consistent use of a
term in these references should indicate a lack of consensus about the
best term for the phenomenon.

20 mg/kg 2/day for 4 days for both studies, I think.  Not comparable to 
human recreational or therapeutic doses.  The conclusions of this
study were that "the predominant effects of MDMA on serotonergic
systeems throughout the brain are mediated on 5-HT axons and terminals...
(and that) ...not all regions may be equally vulnerable to the
neurodegenerative effects of MDMA."  Most interestingly, they found
difference in rate of recovery.

Here Gibb's lab used a single high dose (20 mg/kg).  They were looking
at the mechanism of neurodegneration by giving adrenalectomies.

Here, Dave Nichols lab demonstrates that DA plays a role in MDMA-induced
neurotoxicity.  It is important work, but how does it bear on the issues
of whether MDMA neurotoxicity exists in humans, whether the axonal damage
has any functional/behavioral correlates, and to what extent recovery
occurs?

See above.  By the way, Nichols believes that MDMA has therapeutic
uses.

>self-administration and neurotoxicity. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 39:

Ah, now this might have some bearing on the issue.  I haven't seen the study
yet (blush), so I can't comment much.  Certainly repeated injections
of MDA across several days, as happened here, isn't the kind of behavior 
one finds much in humans, but it IS interesting to see the relationship 
between reinforcing doses and neurotoxic doses.  

I once tried to give cocaine-drinking rats MDMA solutions to see if they'd 
like it.  Initially, they did, but then they all went cold turkey.  
The data suggests that they increased their dosage until they reached 
a dose which produced dysphoria (whether it was due to the amount taken 
or the fact that they had been taking repeated doses I cannot say).  They
all stopped by the third day.   However, the doses at which they 
stopped self-administering seemed far too low to produce neurotoxicity.  
I suspect that the fact that the rats had been trained on cocaine also 
played a role in their failure to continue self-administration.  
I regret not being able to do more experiments along those lines, 
but California was calling out to me...  :-)

If the experimenters limited the rats' ability to self administer the MDA,
so that their intake paralleled human patterns, then this would be
particularly interesting.  Although, frankly, I guess I don't know much
about patterns of MDA use in humans.  It is such a rare drug.

Could you perhaps tell us more about this study?

This is an exploration of the gluatamate hypothesis of neurotoxicity.
13.8 mg/kg given 3 times (every 2 hours).  Ouch!

Same Battaglia regimen as above.  They found that it was the fine axons
which were selectively damaged.

An important piece of work.  Finally, we're getting down to the monkey
business.  George Ricaurte et al found that squirrel monkeys given
5 mg/kg twice a day for 4 days hadn't completely recovered at 18
months and had in fact seemingly returned to an earlier state of
damage.  Papers like this really make you realize how difficult it is
to say when "neurotoxicity" has taken place and when it has been 
repaired.  

He got increases in 5-HT in one area ("hyperenervation" of the hypothalamus).
Others have gotten similar effects with phenethylamine "neurotoxins" and it 
seems to happen in the areas from which the neurons originate, as if new 
growth sprouts out from there.  And he also got partial recovery 
(63% of controls) of 5-HT levels in the thalamus.  But all the other
sites looked as if they were down at what you'd expect 2 weeks after
the high dose regimen.

At one point he basically says that we have no idea what is happening
here.  I'll second that.  Importantly, he has still-unpublished (I think)
data that fails to find any neurotoxic effects from a less punishing,
human-like regimen.

>Schechter MD (1991) Effect of MDMA neurotoxicity upon its conditioned
>place preference and discrimination. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 38:
>539-544

This is interesting.  They trained rats to discriminate 1.5 mg/kg MDMA
from vehicle and then established that the same dose produced
conditioned place preference, meaning the rats liked it.  Then, they
 gave the Battaglia regimen of 20 mg/kg 2/day for 4 days.  They
found that the high dose regimen didn't change the place preference,
but did make the rats more sensitive to 1.0 mg/kg on the discrimination
task.

Note the difference between giving single injections of 1.5 mg/kg and
giving 8 injections of 20 mg/kg.  One is pleasurable and probably not
damaging, the other is damaging and unpleasurable.  The question then
is whether there are pleasurable and damaging doses.  There are
probably pleasurable and damaging regimens, since repeated low doses
seem to be damaging.  But what about isolated or infrequently given
doses?

An interesting paper.  It made me think, "would 5-HT2 AGONISTS also
protect against the neurotoxicity?"  That would be of interest to
the people who take LSD and MDMA at the same time.

Suggests hyperthermia contributes to neurotoxicity.

Well, if you have any other references feel free to post them, particularly
if they use non-adversive doses of the drugs.

"The treatement of these [5-HTergic] disorders in the adult is achived by 
using specific drugs that act on the serotonergic neuronal receptors to
produce a pharmacologic change in the functioning of the 5-HT system.  These
drugs have proven extremely useful in correcting the chemical imbalance.
Unfortunately, the morphlogical deficits that underlie the chemical imbalance
often remain unchecked.  In many instances, pharmacologic treatment must
be sustained indefinitely with the added burden, in many cases, of
increasing dosage due to decreasing efficiency of the drug/receptor 
interaction.  Can the serotonergic system be morphologically reorganized
in the adult brain using the same growth factors active during development?
  In this article we will present evidence that serotonergic neurons are
plastic in the adult brain, that is, that they can sprout and innervate new
target areas.  Furthermore, the signals and molecules for sprouting
in the adult brain are to a large extent similar to those functioning
during early development.  However, to activate these mechanisms, the
adult serotonergic neurons must first be damaged or blocked.  The adult
brain detects the lack of serotonin and "reactivates" certain development
programs to encourage their growth into the "chemically" deafferented area.
Our work suggests that this reawakening of develpomental processes
involves the 5-HT1A recetors located on astrocytes..."

"Pharmacologic intervention can alter the growth of serotongeric neurons.
Compounds such as MDMA (Ecstasy) have a bell-shaped curve (Azmitia, 1990).
At a low concentration the drug can stimulate growth of cultured
serotonergic neurons.  However, at a higher dose, the drug is a powerful
serotonergic toxin.  5-Methoxy-Tryptamine, a commonly used 5-HT receptor
agonist, has a profile opposite that of MDMA.  In culture, low doses of
this drug can inhibit fetal development, while high doses stimulate
growth (Whitaker-Azmitia, 1986).  When this drug i sinjected into
pregnant animals, the development of the 5-HT system is similarly affected and
the behavior of the animals is abnormal (Shemer, 1988).
