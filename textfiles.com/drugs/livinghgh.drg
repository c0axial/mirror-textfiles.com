 _Living high : daily marijuana use among adults_ by Herbert Hendin ... [et
al.].  Describes an intensive study of the impact frequent use has on a
number of adults living in the NYC area.  The authors studied a relatively
small number of individuals who voluntarily responded to a newspaper ad
inviting frequent marijuana users to participate in the study.  The book
provides a good description of how frequent marijuana use can negatively
effect the lives of _individuals_, and/or exacerbate existing their
existing problems.
