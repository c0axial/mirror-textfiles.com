Okay 2C-B is 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.  Its the phenethylamine
analogue of DOB.  The 2C is because its had a 2-carbon chain sticking off
of the phenyl ring (which is why its a phenethylamine instead of an
amphetamine), and I *assume* the B is because of the Br atom in the 4
position.

Doses are 12-24mg, Duration is 4-8 hours.  Doses of 100mg have been taken
safely.  2C-B seems to be an extraordinarily colorful hallucingen similar
to LSD -- apparently somewhat analytical and dissasociative in higher doses
or in those sensitive to those effects.   

Quote from Ecstasy: The MDMA Story...

[begins with a quotation from Alexander Shulgin]:

      2C-B... is a tool...  which ties the mental processes directly 
    and constructively into the physical soma.
      The analgesic effects experienced with many, if not most,
    psychedelic drugs, are not present with 2C-B.  On the
    contrary, there is increased body awareness of every kind,
    including skin sensitivity, heightened responsiveness to
    smells, tastes, and sexual stimulation.
      One experiences increased consciousness of physical
    health and energy, or, on the other hand, sharpened 
    awareness of any body imbalance or discomfort.
      2C-B allows for rich visual imagery and intesnse eyes-
    closed fantasy without the cluttering up of the mental field
    with too much elaboration...  It is a superb tool for learning
    and growth.

[...] At high doses (above 30 mgs.), 2C-B is intensely hallucinogenic,
and, like any major psychedelic, can be frightening for certain people.
In small doses, it becomes a mild sensory enhancer but does not have the
strongly empathogenic qualities that MDMA has.
    Perhaps the best use that has been found for 2C-B is as a synergist
with MDMA.  When taken together, the MDMA pushes the non-specific 2C-B
reaction in a more warm and emphathetic direction.  Because 2C-B is a 
psychedelic drug, and therefore not fully predictable, its action can take
the user in many different directions.  But if the set and setting are right,
2C-B can enhance the desire for sexual orgasm during an MDMA experience.
The synergy of the two substances can on occasion be a true aphrodisiac.

Shulgin writes in PiHKAL:

"The most succesfful reports have followed a program in which the two drugs
are not used at the same time, nor even too closely spaced.  It appears that
the optimum time for the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline
recovery of the MDMA."

DOB:  2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Bromoamphetamine.  The only chemical difference is
      the addition of an extra carbon to the chain.  This turns the
      phenethylamine into an alpha-methyl-phenethylamine (because the 
      addition of a carbon means attatching a methyl group to the
      alpha carbon of the phenethylamine) also called a phenylisopropylamine
      or simply an amphetamine.


CH3O    /\\     / \     NH2 
    \ /    \\ /     \ /  
     ||      |       |

    / \    // \     
  Br    \//    OCH3     
             
DOB has a potency of 1.0-3.0 mg and duration of 18-30 hours.  Its very
similar to LSD.  It seems to be more colorful than LSD and less dissociative
than 2C-B based on the reports I've read.  The index of safety is probably
something like over 1,000 times the effective dose. 

2C-D (LE-25): 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylphenethylamine.  This is the 2 carbon
     homologue of DOM (2C-B is to DOB as 2C-D is to DOM).  The difference
     between 2C-D and 2C-B is simply the replacement of the Br atom with
     a methyl group.

CH3O    /\\     / \     NH2 
    \ /    \\ /     \ /  
     ||      |

     ||      |        
    / \    // \     
 H3C    \//    OCH3  

2C-D has a potency of 20-60mg and a duration of 4-6 hours.  Seems to also
be very colorful.  Shulgin notes:  "Wow! This particular compound is what
I call a pharmacological tofu.  It doesn't seem to do much by itself, always
teasing, until you get to heroic levels.  But a goodly number of experimental
therapists have said that it is excellent in extending the action of some
other materials.  It seems to boost the waning action of another drug, without
adding its own color to the experience."  At 150mg+ it appears it might be
a full blown 2C-B-like psychedelic, however.  No info on the toxic dose.

DOM (STP): 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylamphetamine.  Again, simply the addition
    of an extra carbon to the chain to turn the phenethylamine 2C-D into
    the ampehtamine DOM.  And the replacement of the Br atom in DOB with
    a methyl group would give you DOM also.

 
CH3O    /\\     / \     NH2 
    \ /    \\ /     \ /  
     ||      |       | 
     ||      |       | 
     ||      |       CH2 
    / \    // \     
 H3C    \//    OCH3   

DOM has a potency of about 3-10mg and a duration of 14-20 hours.  This was
first synthesized by Shulgin, and is what he calls his "Problem Child" (in
reference to Albert Hofmann's name for LSD).  It gained a considerable
amount of use in the 60's and people taking 30mg+ (a whopping dose) had
some very dissasociative, bad trips.  It was known as STP, which stands for
the motor oil additive actually, but was also known as "Serenity, 
Tranquility and Peace".  From the descriptions it seems LSD-like, with
possibly even more of a head-trip.  5-10mg seems *much* more appropriate
from the descriptions with very good effects.  Only at higher (20-30mg)
doses does it appear to get really nasty. 

And for chemical comparison, MDA and MDMA:  3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine and
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine respectively...  They're somewhat similar
to DOM and DOB -- all the ring substituents need to be knocked off and
replaced with the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring.  Then for MDMA you've got the
addition of a methyl group to the nitrogen amine.

MDA:

     O     /\\     / \     NH2 
   /   \ /    \\ /     \ /  
  /     ||      |       | 
H2C     ||      |       | 
  \     ||      |       CH2 
   \   / \    //      
     O     \//  

MDMA:
       
     O     /\\     / \     NHCH3 
   /   \ /    \\ /     \ /  
  /     ||      |       |

  \     ||      |       CH2 
   \   / \    //      
     O     \// 

Also we might as well throw in amphetamine if you all haven't figured out
what that should look like yet (replace the NH2 with NHCH3 to get
methamphetamine -- identical substitution as between MDA and MDMA).
Also, if you knock off the CH2 from amphetamine, you'll get phenethylamine
which is the prototype chemical for all the drugs I've listed so far, although
itself its inactive.

amphetamine:

    /\\     / \     NH2 
  /    \\ /     \ /

 ||      |       | 
 ||      |       CH2 
  \    //      
    \//  
 
And just for kicks here we have good old LSD which looks nothing like all
these other chemicals:

                     / C2H5         
          H.     CON    
            '. /     \ C2H5

   HN-------

Hope you enjoyed that.  Chem dweebs please check to make sure I got
everything correct.  I didn't have time to go over this with a fine-toothed
comb.

(I have fixed some character-set lossage)

#20 2C-B; 4-BROMO-2,5-DIMETHOXYPHENETHYLAMINE

SYNTHESIS: A solution of 100 g of 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde in 220 g
nitromethane was treated with 10 g anhydrous ammonium acetate, and
heated on a steam bath for 2.5 h with occasional swirling.  The
deep-red reaction mixture was stripped of the excess nitromethane
under vacuum, and the residue crystallized spontaneously.  This crude
nitrostyrene was purified by grinding under IPA, filtering, and
air-drying, to yield 85 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-beta-nitrostyrene as a
yellow-orange product of adequate purity for the next step.  Further
purification can be achieved by recrystallization from boiling IPA.

In a round-bottomed 2 L flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and
placed under an inert atmosphere, there was added 750 mL anhydrous
THF, containing 30 g LAH.  There was then added, in THF solution, 60 g
2,5-dimethoxy-beta-nitrostyrene.  The final solution was a dirty
yellow-brown color, and it was kept at reflux temperature for 24 h.
After cooling, the excess hydride was destroyed by the dropwise
addition of IPA.  Then 30 mL 15% NaOH was added to convert the
inorganic solids to a filterable mass.  The reaction mixture was
filtered and the filter cake washed first with THF and then with MeOH.
The combined mother liquors and washings were freed of solvent under
vacuum and the residue suspended in 1.5 L H2O.  This was acidified
with HCl, washed with with 3x100 mL CH2Cl2, made strongly basic with
25% NaOH, and reextracted with 4x100 mL CH2Cl2.  The pooled extracts
were stripped of solvent under vacuum, yielding 26 g of oily residue,
which was distilled at 120-130 deg C at 0.5 mm/Hg to give 21 g of a white
oil, 2,5-dimethoxy-phenethylamine (2C-H) which picks up carbon dioxide
from the air very quickly.

To a well-stirred solution of 24.8 g 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in 40
mL glacial acetic acid, there was added 22 g elemental bromine
dissolved in 40 mL acetic acid.  After a couple of min, there was the
formation of solids and the simultaneous evolution of considerable
heat.  The reaction mixture was allowed to return to room temperature,
filtered, and the solids washed sparingly with cold acetic acid.  This
was the hydrobromide salt.  There are many complicated salt forms,
both polymorphs and hydrates, that can make the isolation and
characterization of 2C-B treacherous.  The happiest route is to form
the insoluble hydrochloride salt by way of the free base.  The entire
mass of acetic acid-wet salt was dissolved in warm H2O, made basic to
at least pH 11 with 25% NaOH, and extracted with 3x100 mL CH2Cl2.
Removal of the solvent gave 33.7 g of residue which was distilled at
115-130 !C at 0.4 mm/Hg.  The white oil, 27.6 g, was dissolved in 50
mL H2O containing 7.0 g acetic acid.  This clear solution was vigorous
stirred, and treated with 20 mL concentrated HCl.  There was an
immediate formation of the anhydrous salt of
2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-B).  This mass
of crystals was removed by filtration (it can be loosened considerably
by the addition of another 60 mL H2O), washed with a little H2O, and
then with several 50 mL portions of Et2O.  When completely air-dry,
there was obtained 31.05 g of fine white needles, with a mp of 237-239
deg C with decomposition.  When there is too much H2O present at the time
of adding the final concentrated HCl, a hydrated form of 2C-B is
obtained.  The hydrobromide salt melts at 214.5-215 deg C.  The acetate
salt was reported to have a mp of 208-209 deg C.

DOSAGE: 12 - 24 mg.

DURATION: 4 - 8 h.

QUALITATIVE COMMENTS: (with 16 mg) A day at the Stanford museum.
Things were visually rich, yet I felt that I was reasonably
inconspicuous.  The Rodin sculptures were very personal and not
terribly subtle.  I saw Escher things in the ceiling design, when I
decided to sit in a foyer somewhere and simply pretend to rest.
Walking back, the displays seen in the bark of the eucalyptus trees,
and the torment and fear (of others? of themselves?) in the faces of
those who were walking towards us, were as dramatic as anything I had
seen in the art galleries.  Our appetites were enormous, and we went
to a smorgasbord that evening.  A rich experience in every possible
way.

(with 20 mg) The drug effect first became known to me as a shift of
colors toward golden and rose tones.  Pigments in the room became
intensified.  Shapes became rounder, more organic.  A sensation of
lightness and rivulets of warmth began seeping through my body.
Bright lights began pulsing and flashing behind my closed lids.  I
began to perceive waves of energy flowing through all of us in unison.
I saw all of us as a gridwork of electrical energy beings, nodes on a
bright, pulsating network of light.  Then the interior landscape
shifted into broader scenes.  Daliesque vistas were patterned with
eyes of Horus, brocades of geometric design began shifting and
changing through radiant patterns of light.  It was an artist's
paradise Q representing virtually the full pantheon of the history of
art.

(with 20 mg) The room was cool, and for the first hour I felt cold
and chilled.  That was the only mildly unpleasant part.  We had been
hanging crystals earlier that day, and the visions I had were
dominated by prismatic light patterns.  It was almost as if I became
the light.  I saw kaleidoscopic forms -- similar to, but less intense
than, when on acid -- and organic forms like Georgia OUKeefe flowers,
blossoming and undulating.  My body was flooded with orgasms --
practically from just breathing.  The lovemaking was phenomenal,
passionate, ecstatic, lyric, animal, loving, tender, sublime.  The
music was voluptuous, almost three-dimensional.  Sometimes the sound
seemed distorted to me, underwater like.  This was especially so for
the less good recordings -- but I could choose to concentrate on the
beauty of the music or the inadequacy of the sound's quality, and
mostly chose to concentrate on the beauty.

(with 24 mg) I am totally into my body.  I am aware of every muscle
and nerve in my body.  The night is extraordinary -- moon full.
Unbelievably erotic, quiet and exquisite, almost unbearable.  I cannot
begin to unravel the imagery that imposes itself during the finding of
an orgasm.  Trying to understand physical/spiritual merging in nature
-- .

EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY: Four quotations were chosen arbitrarily
from literally hundreds that have worked their ways into the files.
The vast majority are positive, ranging from the colorful to the
ecstatic.  But not all are.  There are people who choose not to go
into the corporeal but, rather, prefer the out-of-body experience.
They express discomfort with 2C-B, and seem to lean more to the
Ketamine form of altered state, one which dissociates body from mind.

There have been reports of several overdoses that prove the intrinsic
safety of this compound.  Prove is used here in the classic British
sense; i.e., to challenge.  "The proof of the pudding is in the
eating," is not a verification of quality, but an inquiry into the
quality itself.  (The French simplify all this by using two separate
verbs for prove.)  One overdose was intentional, the other accidental.

(with 64 mg) "I found only mild visual and emotional effects at the 20
milligram dose, so I took the remaining 44 milligrams.  I was
propelled into something not of my choosing.  Everything that was
alive was completely fearsome.  I could look at a picture of a bush,
and it was just that, a picture, and it posed no threat to me.  Then
my gaze moved to the right, and caught a bush growing outside the
window, and I was petrified.  A life-form I could not understand, and
thus could not control.  And I felt that my own life-form was not a
bit more controllable." This was from the comments of a physician who
assured me that he saw no neurological concerns during this dramatic
and frightening experience.

(with 100 mg) I had weighed correctly.  I had simply picked up the
wrong vial.  And my death was to be a consequence of a totally stupid
mistake.  I wanted to walk outside, but there was a swimming pool
there and I didnUt dare fall into it.  A person may believe that he
has prepared himself for his own death, but when the moment comes, he
is completely alone, and totally unprepared.  Why now?  Why me?  Two
hours later, I knew that I would live after all, and the experience
became really marvelous.  But the moment of facing death is a unique
experience.  In my case, I will some day meet it again, and I fear
that I will be no more comfortable with it then than I was just now.
This was from the comments of a psychologist who will, without doubt,
use psychedelics again in the future, as a probe into the unknown.

Many of the reports that have come in over the years have mentioned
the combination of MDMA and 2C-B.  The most successful reports have
followed a program in which the two drugs are not used at the same
time, nor even too closely spaced.  It appears that the optimum time
for the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline recovery of the
MDMA.  It is as if the mental and emotional discoveries can be
mobilized, and something done about them.  This combination has
several enthusiastic advocates in the psychotherapy world, and should
be the basis of careful research when these materials become legal,
and accepted by the medical community.

A generalized spectrum of 2C-B action can be gleaned from the many
reports that have been written describing its effects.  (1) There is a
steep dose response curve.  Over the 12 to 24 milligram range, every 2
milligrams can make a profound increase or change of response.
Initially, one should go lightly, and increase the dosage in
subsequent trials by small increments.  A commonly used term for a
level that produces a just perceptible effect is Rmuseum level.S This
is a slightly-over-threshold level which allows public activities
(such as viewing paintings in a museum or scenery watching as a
passenger in a car) to be entered into without attracting attention.
There can be considerable discomfort associated with being in the
public eye, with higher doses.  (2) The 2C-B experience is one of the
shortest of any major psychedelic drug.  Wherever you might be, hang
on.  In an hour or so you will be approaching familiar territory
again.  (3) If there is anything ever found to be an effective
aphrodisiac, it will probably be patterned after 2C-B in structure.

There are two "Tweetios" known that are related to 2C-B.  (See recipe
#23 for the origin of this phrase.)  The 2-EtO- homologue of 2C-B is
4-bromo-2-ethoxy-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CB-2ETO.  The
unbrominated benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a
melting point of 47.5-48.5 deg C, the unbrominated nitrostyrene
intermediate a melting point of 76-77 deg C, and the final hydrochloride
a melting point of 185-186 deg C.  The hydrobromide salt had a melting
point of 168.5-169.5 deg C.  It seems that one gets about as much effect
as can be had, with a dosage of about 15 milligrams, and increases
above this, to 30 and to 50 milligrams merely prolong the activity
(from about 3 hours to perhaps 6 hours).  At no dose was there an
intensity that in any way resembled that of 2C-B.

The 2,5-DiEtO- homologue of 2C-B is
4-bromo-2,5-diethoxyphenethylamine, or 2CB-2,5-DIETO.  The
unbrominated impure benzaldehyde (2,5-diethoxybenzaldehyde) had a
melting point of about 57 deg C, the unbrominated impure nitrostyrene
intermediate a melting point of about 60 deg C, and the final
hydrochloride a melting point of 230-231 deg C.  The hydrobromide salt
had a melting point of 192-193 deg C.  At levels of 55 milligrams, there
was only a restless sleep, and strange dreams.  The active level is
not yet known.

I have been told of some studies that have involved a positional
rearrangement analogue of 2C-B.  This is
2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (or 6-BR-DMPEA).  This would be
the product of the elemental bromination of DMPEA, and it has been
assayed as the hydrobromide salt.  Apparently, the intravenous
injection of 60 milligrams gave a rapid rush, with intense visual
effects reported, largely yellow and black.  Orally, there may be some
activity at the 400 to 500 milligram area, but the reports described
mainly sleep disturbance.  This would suggest a stimulant component.
The N-methyl homologue of this rearranged compound was even less
active.

	Well, in a thread recently, there was some talk aabout bromo
mescaline, and mention was made of the entry in the Student Handbook of
our esteemed institution that deals with the drug in question.  Well, it is
Reed folklore that tells us that bromo mescaline was first synthesized here
at Reed (BTW, it is not folklore that Dr. Demento graduated from Reed),
but the drug is real, to which several friends can attest.  Since I have the
ol' Student Handbook right in front of me, I'll tell y'all what it sez.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
From _The Reed College Student Handbook_, in the "Drug Article That Ate Reed
College", by Marty Smith:

   Bromo-mescaline. The most terrifying hallucinogen known to man. The effects
last 3-5 hours, the visuals are awe-inspiring and the head trip is light,
usually.  The catch is, first, for it to act like bromo, you have to snort
it. This is really intense, because in about two to five minutes, you're
tripping you ass off, the world is melting. The incredible speed with which
this happens is one of the things those who like it like about it. However,
when it gets up your nose it hurts. This is probably an understatement. It's
really amazingly painful. You'll be suprised that you would actually do this
to yourself. It has been described as having red hot knives shoved up your
nose, or being kicked in the face by a psychedelic horse. You may briefly
entertain notions of dying.  This all dies down after about twenty minutes,
though, and you're lucky there will be no nausea at all afterward. (It helps
to have eaten a starchy meal about an hour and a half earlier.) Otherwise,
you might have about 20 minutes of mild nausea. The visuals are real good.
To have visuals this intense on acid you'd have to be on so much that you
couldn't talk.  On bromo you could discuss them reasonably coherently.
   A word about dosage. One hit is one fourtieth of a gram.  This is a
fact. Do not say something stupid like, "Oh, let's do a lot," and hoot up a
couple of lines the size of your thumb. I have some friends who did this,
and they ended up lying under some bushes, at night, in the rain, unable
even to yell for help, and now they will not do drugs for the next five
million jillion years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's the straight dope (none of the many puns intended).

=========================================================================

Ah, the memories this brings back. I was at Reed in 1979, and bromo was 
plentiful and popular at Reed at that time. The descriptions of its
effects that I've read on this board are, I would say, rather accurate.
The effects are different, and more dramatic, than LSD.

At the time, it was usually sold in single dosages in clear gel capsules.
I didn't snort it (I didn't care for the pain), but found the effects to
be most effective when eating it as well. I ate 3 capsules one night
when I was bored, and had the most earth-shattering experience of my 
life. Hallucinations were so intense that I could not recognize people and
could not understand what they were saying. I saw spinning pinwheels made
of knife blades reflecting all the colors of the rainbow on the walls. I
thought I was shivering from cold at one point, and remarked as much to
a friend of mine (this before I was hallucinating so heavily that I couldn't
recognize or uderstand people). He told me I wasn't shivering at all; I
realized he was right, and the sensation that I was shivering suddenly
changed to a sensation that I had powerful electrical energies pulsing
through my body.

I had many more bizarre experiences that night (including a mild panic
when I thought I was moving backward in time), but I don't want to drone
on here. Suffice it to say that the drug is real, and the descriptions
of its effects on this board are not exaggerations.

yes, i believe that "bromomescaline" 2-CB aka CBr...  2,5-dimethoxy-4-
bromophenethylamine.  the reason why it probably burns going up your nose
is that it may lack any kind of anaesthetic action (unlike MDA, MDMA, and
particularly cocaine), while still being in the form (probably) of a
hydrochloric salt (where the HCl comes from).

culled from the MDMA FAQ:

} CBr is 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Bromophenethylamine.  The
} "sometimes frightening" part probably comes from taking more than the

} Hi:
} 
} There has been quite a flow of stuff on the subject of BROMO on 
} alt.drugs entry.  Maybe you can post some parts of the following
} that might answer some of the comments, questions, or errors
} being put out there on the topic.
} 
} (1)  Bromomescaline is without doubt 2C-B.  The dosage, the 
} duration, the nature of the experience, all seem consistent with
} this assignment.  Also, as you have indicated, the replacement of
} a methoxy group (of mescaline) with a bromo atom gives the 
} isomeric structure (a little rearrangement needed) of 2C-B.
} 
} (2)  It releases bromic acid.  Of course not.  Bromic acid 
} (HBrO3) is an unstable chimera which is substantially unknown.  
} Probably what is meant is that it releases hydrobromic acid 
} (HBr) but then there is no experimental evidence that HBr is 
} released either.  I suspect that the bromine atom stays on the 
} drug molecule all the way through the kidney, and that there 
} is no release of this element at any time in the body.
} 
} (3)  It is illegal, or a scheduled drug.  No so.  2C-B was added
} to the German law in January of this year, but in the US it is 
} still an unnamed drug in Federal law.
} 
} (4)  It burns on snorting (insufflation).  It sure does, but this
} is most likely due to the fact that it is extremely insoluble in
} water, and probably sits on the mucous membranes for quite a 
} while until it dissolves and is absorbed.  And until this happens
} it irritates and blisters the skin at the sites where the solid
} particles of the drug happen to settle.  Once absorbed, the
} pain disappears, and the effects start.  A challenge to this
} would be to snort the acetate or the hydrobromide salt, both of
} which are quite a bit more soluble in water.  These should have 
} the same psychological effect, and they should act even more 
} quickly (no slow dissolving) and act with little or no pain.

Their report surprises me somewhat. Definitely atypical, although it
does seem to be the case that people's response to 2C-B varies
markedly. Most people find it to be very good, over a range of
dosage levels.

>Anyone care to relate personal experiences, or point me in the direction

Here is an anonymous discussion of the effects of 2C-B:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For me, 2C-B seems to be in a different league from all other drugs.
No other experience has come close to that of 2C-B. Superficially,
it seems to lie somewhere between MDMA and psilocybin, i.e. it is
both entactogenic (in a way I find more wholesome and satisfying
than MDMA or MDE) and psychedelic. Unlike psilocybin, it leaves
the ego much more intact - the mind remains clear and comfortable
throughout. Unlike MDMA it is unlikely to cause inappropriate
emotional bonding between people - only to encourage appropriate
bonding.

My first experience with 2C-B was with four doses, each of about
20-25mg of the hydrochloride, spaced by 40 minute intervals. The
experiment was conducted in private with one other person. 
Because of the spaced doses, the onset was gradual and gentle.
I was slowly lifted out of my ordinary life, and taken to a
state of pure heaven. Laurie Andersen once said "Paradise is
like where you are right now, only much much better" and this
about sums it up. Everything around me was somehow transformed
into absolute perfection. There were mild visual distortions
which were tasteful decorations but in no way got in the way.
All sensation became the most pleasurable possible - food,
touch, sound, sight, sex were all simply perfect, but none
of this was at all overwhelming. Throughout I remained totally
calm, rational, and in control, just feeling better than I 
have ever felt before. There was a sense of "this is the best -
I have finally arrived - I am complete and need never look 
further than this." 2CB is heaven, but it is also mundane - 
there are no fireworks, no fake euphoria - the change is
so subtle you could almost forget it is there. We weren't
moved to do anything differently - just to exist in this in
this beautiful state and behave normally.

With one foot in heaven and one foot on earth, just after the
peak, I found myself in a state of introspection. I felt so
indescribably emotionally beautiful that it brought me to
tears. Then, all the cares and worries of recent weeks came 
flooding at me, but not at an unbearable rate. It was as if
the 2C-B were saying "I have given you 2 hours of perfect 
bliss, but you are about to return to your normal life. Here
are some issues which are bothering you, and now is the 
perfect time to do something about them". The self-analysis
was honest and useful - not distorted and certainly not
superficial - and it was compelling and motivating.

The comedown was slow and gentle. There was no sense of loss,
no desire to regain the state immediately (or at all!); on 
the contrary, the subtle return to normality was welcome. 
Every state between heaven and earth felt just right.

If it is impossible to adequately describe any drug induced
state in words, this is doubly true with 2C-B. For me, the
2C-B experience is unparalleled, so I would recommend that
people try it. Some do not seem to enjoy it, some do not seem
to understand it, but many do.

A few final notes: My experiences suggest that there is nothing
that can be added to the 2C-B experience - nothing can make
it better than it is, and so all other drugs should be avoided
contemporaneously. Also, insufflation seems to increase the
potency 2-3 times, as well as somewhat shortening the duration.
The onset is rapid (half to three minutes) and somewhat disorienting, 
and can approach the feel and intensity of smoked DMT, particularly
in a visual sense. The burning pain associated with snorting 2C-B
can detract from the experience initially.

With respect to US laws, 2cb (aka Nexus, Zenith) wasn't scheduled until
late 1993.
Its actual chemical name is 4-Bromo-2,5-Dimethoxyphenethylamine.

The Feds were alerted when a rather rich fella in Tampa, FL took some to
relieve impotence, as it was being promoted. When started tripping he
called the DEA and the next thing you know... 

See _Federal Register_, Vol. 58, No. 212, Thurs. Nov 4,1993 page 58819-20.

	2cb unfortunately is now scheduled. I had the opportunity to
experience it about a year ago before scheduling and I'll tell you a bit
about it.
	A friend of mine and I weighed out 25mg each and proceeded to
ingest it via insufflation. Needless to say, it was the most painful
annoying long lasting burn I have ever felt. It burned my sinuses and all
the way down the back of my throat as I got the "drips". My face felt like
it was going to fall off. Combine this with virtually instant
disorientation and nausea, you get two guys that are scared shitless. I've
done my share of excessive hallucinogen doses. But this didn't even come
close to comparing to any of them. It felt like we jumped out of a
building and were free falling faster and faster into a psychedelic world
which didn't seem all that great in lieu of the aforementioned symptoms. I
was actually pretty sure we had od'd and contemplated calling 911.
Unfortunately, I couldn't even make it to the phone if I tried. We had a
sober friend watch us and make sure we were physically ok. As the trip
picked up speed and intensity, shit got really strange. On most
hallucinogens, you can make things move if you stare at em for a bit, but
in this world, EVERYTHING is moving and doesn't stop. Which made me start
to feel motion sickness. I saw 4 foot fluroescent spheres float by with
intricate fractal patterns on them. Our 'guide' wasn't all that bright and
was flipping tv channels and stopped on True Stories of The Highway
Patrol. Not a good thing to watch in this state of mind. We then proceeded
to wheel of fortune where I can swear the people were in the middle of the
living room and letters were flying by us. The experience was like going
from sober to 1000mcg in about 5 minutes. It was actually pretty scary
because we both thought we'd finally done it and were gonna die. But we
were too tweaked to express it. About an hour into it, we realized we were
going to live and the nausea and burning had for the most part subsided,
save the fact that my nose and sinuses were swollen for about 2 days.
After about an hour, it gets kind of like an intense LSD trip.. the
coolest thing is there is really no analytical game playing as with LSD
and you can pretty much discuss what's going on with a good deal of
coherence.  The effects dropped off pretty rapidly and by the 4 hour mark
we felt almost totally sober. 
	I've done 2cb via capsule and have never had it affect me that way
at even 2 and 3 times the dose. It's something I'll never do again because
of A. the pain and B. the intensity. It was too much too fast. I might eat
it again though if it ever becomes unscheduled ;). I did notice something
interesting though. At sea level, a 20 mg dose is pretty mellow... kinda
like LSD but feels more like Mescaline. Yet, we also did it at a
campground in the mountains 6000 feet up. It took under 20 minutes to hit
orally while at sea level it was over an hour. Mind you both times this
was done with a full stomach with exactly the same type of food. I thought
it curious that it was so much more intense at altitude than sea level and
know it wasn't just a fluke situational thing.. any ideas?

Have fun.. good luck and be careful. If you're gonna snort it, be prepared
for lots of pain and a 50% chance of hurling. Also, don't do what a guy we
know did and call 911 because he thought he was gonna wig out. He got
transported to the hospital and by the time he got there about an hour had
gone by and it was tolerable. Needless to say, he felt like an idiot.
Moral: No matter where you are, hold tight, about an hour into it.. you'll
mellow way out. 

It's also kinda hard on the body too.. really tweaky. Nice thing about it
is, that when it's over, it's over. No lingering head buzzing and loops
like the end of an LSD trip where you're no longer hallucinating but are
still unable to sleep. This stuff has a really sharp peak and drop off.

Peace.

M.
