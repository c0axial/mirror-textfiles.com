LSD Dosages
-----------

        The basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of acid is
available and what medium of ingestion is used. Chemically the potency of
LSD-25 is measured in micrograms, or mics. If you're chemically minded or
making your own acid, then computing the number of mics is very important.
Usually between 300 to 500 micrograms (mics) is plenty for a five to eight
hour trip, depending on quality, of course. I have heard of people taking
as much as 1500 to 2000 mics. This not only extremely dangerous, it is also
wasteful.
        LSD comes packaged in many different forms. The proverbial sugar
cube is pretty passe', in the sense that other more feasible methods have 
taken its place. The most common are listed below.
[1> The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried drop of LSD on it, is
        always around. Usually one spot equals one trip.
[2> Capsuled acid is extremely tricky, as the cap can be almost any color,
        size, and potency. Always ask what the acid is cut with, as a lot
        of acid is cut with either speed or strychnine. Also note dosage.
[3> Small white or colored tablets have been known to contain acid, but, 
        as with the capsuled acid, it is impossible to tell potency, without
        asking.
[4> I have heard about some characters who attempted to shoot acid. Shooting
        any drug is a bad scene. Stay away from it. I cannot imagine what
        their rush was like, but would certainly advise against this form of
        drug abuse.
