This is a history of drug use/prohibition  based on the Appendix of
*Ceremonial Chemistry* by Thomas  Szasz.   The book is published 
by "Doubleday/Anchor"  Garden City, New York, 1975.    I included his
references.   I have added several items of interest and I have deleted
some things I did not feel were relevant (Szasz documents the parallel
course of relgious history).  All unattributed items (no footnote) 
are from the book.

There are some real jewels in this collection.   The entry for 1949 is
especially profound.    

Note how many times governments have banned vaious drugs.   At one time
tabacco was illegal in more than a dozen states!   Fat lot of good it did.

I saw Szasz speak not too long ago, he is a wonderful person, absolutely
brilliant and very charming.   The book is now in its second edition.

		"A sensation of fullness is felt in the head, soon to be
		followed by a universal feeling of delicious ease and 
		comfort, with an elevation and expansion of the whole moral
		and intellectual nature, which is, I think, the most 
		characteristic of its effects. . . . It seems to make
		the individual, for the time, a better and greater man. . . .
		The hallucinations, the delirious imaginations of alcoholic
		intoxication, are, in general, quite wanting.  Along
		with this emotional and intellectual elevation, there is
		also increased muscular energy; and the capacity to act,
		and to bear fatigue, is greatly augmented. [Quoted in 
		Musto, op. cit. pp. 71-72]

1869		The Prohibition Party is formed.  Gerrit Smith, twice
		Abolitionist candidate for President, an associate
		of John Brown, and a crusading prohibitionist, declares:
		"Our involuntary slaves are set free, but our millions
		of voluntary slaves still clang their chains.  The lot of
		the literal slave, of him whom others have enslaved, is indeed
		a hard one; nevertheless, it is a paradise compared 
		with the lot of him who has enslaved himself to alcohol." 
		[Quoted in Sinclar, op. cit. pp. 83-84]

		[Brecher et. al. op. cit. p. 272]

1884		Sigmund Freud treats his depression with cocaine, and reports
		feeling "exhilaration and lasting euphoria, which is in no
		way differs from the normal euphoria of the healthy person. . .
		You perceive an increase in self-control and possess more
		vitality and capacity for work. . . . In other words, you
		are simply more normal, and it is soon hard to believe that

1889		The John Hopkins Hospital, in Baltimore, Maryland, is opened.
		One of its world-famous founders, Dr. William Stewart Halsted,
		is a morphine addict.  He continues to use morphine in large
		doses throughout his phenomenally successful surgical career
		lasting until his death in 1922.

1894		The Report of the Indian Hemp Drug Comission, running to 
		over three thousand pages in seven volumes, is published.
		This inquiry, commissioned by the British government, 
		concluded: "There is no evidence of any weight regarding the
		mental and moral injuries from the moderate use of these
		drugs. .. . . Moderation does not lead to excess in hemp any
		more than it does in alcohol.   Regular, moderate use of ganja
		or bhang produces the same effects as moderate and regular
		doses of whiskey."  The commission's proposal to tax bhang
		is never put into effect, in part, perhaps, because one of
		the commissioners, an Indian, cautions that Moslem law and
		Hindu custom forbid "taxing anything that gives pleasure
		to the poor." [Quoted in Norman Taylor, The pleasant assassin:
		The story of marihuana, in David Solomon (Ed.) *The 
		Marijuana Papers*, pp. 31-47, p. 41]

1894		Norman Kerr, and English physician and president of the
		British Society for the study of Inebriety, declares: 
		"Drunkenness has generally been regarded as . . . a sin
		a vice, or a crime. . . [But] there is now a consensus of
		intelligent opinion that habitual and periodic drunkenness
		is often either a symptom or sequel of disease . . . . The 
		victim can no more resist [alcohol] than an man with ague
		can resist shivering. [Quoted in Roueche, op. cit., pp. 
		107-108]

1898		Diacetylmorphine (heroin) is synthesized in Germany.
		It is widely lauded as a "safe preparation free from
		addiction-forming properties."  [Montagu, op. cit. p. 68]

1900		In an address to the Ecumenical Missionary Conference, Rev.
		Wilbur F. Crafts declares: "No Christian celebration of the
		completion of nineteen Christian centuries has yet been 
		arranged.  Could there be a fitter one than the general 
		adoption, by separate and joint action of the great nations
		of the world, of the new policy of civilization, in which
		Great Britian is leading, the policy of prohibition for the
		native races, in the interest of commerce as well as 
		conscience, since the liquor traffic among child races, 
		even more manifestly than in civilized lands, injures all
		other trades by producing poverty, disease, and death.
		Our object, more profoundly viewed, is to create a more 
		favorable environment for the child races that civilized
		nations are essaying to civilize and Christianize." 
		[Quoted in Crafts, et. al., op. cit., p. 14]

1900		James R. L. Daly, writing in the *Boston Medical and Surgical

		Indians, Alaskans, the inhabitants of Hawaii, railroad workers,
		and immigrants at ports of entry." [Sinclar, op. cit. p. 33]

1902		The Committee on the Acquirement of the Drug Habit of the
		American Pharmaceutical Association declares: "If the
		Chinaman cannot get along without his 'dope,' we can get
		along without him." [Quoted in ibid, p. 17]

1902		George E. Petty, writing in the *Alabama Medical Journal*,
		observes: "Many articles have appeared in the medical 
		literature during the last two years lauding this new agent
		. . . .  When we consider the fact that heroin is a morphine
		derivative . . . it does not seem reasonable that such a 
		claim could be well founded.  It is strange that such a claim
		should mislead anyone or that there should be found among
		the members of our profession those who would reiterate 
		and accentuate it without first subjecting it to the most
		critical tests, but such is the fact." [Quoted in Lennard
		et. al., op. cit. p. 1079]

1903		The composition of Coca-Cola is changed, caffeine replacing

		petitions the President of the United States "to induce 
		Great Britain to release China from the enforced opium 
		traffic. . . .We need not recall in detail that China
		prohibited the sale of opium except as a medicine, until 
		the sale was forced upon that country by Great Britian
		in the opium war of 1840." [Quoted in Crafts et al., op.
		cit. p. 230]

1905		Senator Henry W. Blair, in a letter to Rev. Wilbur F. 
		Crafts, Superintendent of the International Reform 
		Bureau: "The temperance movement must include all poisonous
		substances which create unnatural appetite, and international
		prohibition is the goal." [Quoted in ibid.]

1906		The first Pure Food and Drug Act becomes law; until its
		enactment, it was possible to buy, in stores or by mail order
		medicines containing morphine, cocaine, or heroin, and without
		their being so labeled.

1906		*Squibb's Materia Medical* lists heroin as "a remedy of much
		value . . . is is also used as a mild anodyne and as a
		substitute for morphine in combatting the morphine habit.
		[Quoted in Lennard et al., op. cit. p. 1079]

1912		A writer in *Century* magazine proclaims: "The relation 
		of tobacco, especially in the form of cigarettes, and
		alcohol and opium is a very close one.  . . . Morphine is
		the legitimate consequence of alcohol, and alcohol is the
		legitimate consequence of tobacco.  Cigarettes, drink,
		opium, is the logical and regular series."  And a physician
		warns: "[There is] no energy more destructive of soul, mind,
		and body, or more subversive of good morals than the 
		cigarette.  The fight against the cigarette is a fight for
		civilization."  [Sinclar, op. cit., p. 180]

1912		The first international Opium Convention meets at the
		Hague, and recommends various measures for the international
		control of the trade in opium.  Supsequent Opium Conventions
		are held in 1913 and 1914.

1912		Phenobarbital is introduced into therapeutics under the trade
		name of Luminal.

1913		The Sixteenth Amendment, creating the legal authority for
		federal income tax, is enacted.  Between 1870 and 1915,
		the tax on liquor provides from one-half to two-thirds
		of the whole of the internal revenue of the United States,
		amounting, after the turn of the century, to about $200
		million annually.  The Sixteenth Amendment thus makes possible,
		just seven years later, the Eighteenth Amendment.

1914		Dr. Edward H Williams cites Dr. Christopher Kochs "Most 
		of the attack upon white women of the South are the 
		direct result of the cocaine crazed Negro brain."

		crimes.  The effect is the same on the white man, though
		the white man being further evolved it takes longer time
		to reduce him to the same level." Negro leaders join
		the crusade against alcohol. [Ibid., p. 29]

1916		The *Pharmacopoeia of the United States* drops whiskey and
		brandy from its list of drugs.  Four years later, American
		physicians begin prescribing these "drugs" in quantities 
		never before prescribed by doctors.

1917		The president of the American Medical Association endorses
		national prohibition.  The House of Delegates of the 
		Association passes a resolution stating: "Resolved, The 
		American Medical Association opposes the use of alcohol 
		as a beverage; and be it further Resolved,  That the use
		of alcohol as a therapeutic agent should be discourages."
		By 1928, physicians make an estimated $40,000,000 annually
		by writing prescriptions for whiskey." [Ibid. p. 61]

1917		The American Medical Association passes a resolution declaring
		that "sexual continence is compatible with health and is 
		the best prevention of venereal infections," and one of 
		the methods for controlling syphilis is by controlling alcohol.
		Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels prohibits the practice
		of distributing contraceptives to sailors bound on shore 
		leave, and Congress passes laws setting up "dry and decent
		zones" around military camps.   "Many barkeepers are fined
		for selling liquor to men in uniform.   Only at Coney Island
		could soldiers and sailors change into the grateful anonymity
		of bathing suits and drink without molestation from patriotic
		passers-by." [Ibid. pp. 117-118]

1918		The Anti-Saloon League calls the "liquor traffic" "un-American,"

		he characterizes the Indian peyote religion a "habit 
		indulgence in certain cactaceous plants," calls the belief
		system "superstition" and those who sell peyote "dope vendors,"
		and urges the passage of a bill in Congress that would prohibit
		the use of peyote among the Indian tribes of the Southwest.
		He concludes with this revealing plea for abolition: "The
		great difficulty in suppressing this habit among the Indians
		arises from the fact that the commercial interests involved
		in the peyote traffic are strongly entrenched, and they 
		exploit the Indian. . . . Added to this is the superstition
		of the Indian who believes in the Peyote Church.  As soon
		as an effort is made to suppress peyote, the cry is raised
		that it is unconstitutional to do so and is an invasion of
		religious liberty.  Suppose the Negros of the South had
		Cocaine Church!" [Thomas S. Blair, Habit indulgence in
		certain cactaceous plants among the Indians, *Journal
		of the American Medical Association*, 76:1033-1034 (April

		"Public opinion regarding the vice of drug addiction has
		been deliberately and consistently corrupted through

		shallow pretense that drug addiction is a 'disease'. . . .
		has been asserted and urged in volumes of 'literature'
		by self-styled 'specialists.'"  [Alfred C Prentice, The
		Problem of the narcotic drug addict, *Journal of the
		American Medical Association*, 76:1551-1556; p. 1553]

1924		The manufacture of heroin is prohibited in the United
		States.

1925		Robert A. Schless: "I believe that most drug addiction today
		is due directly to the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act, which
		forbids the sale of narcotics without a physician's 
		prescription. . . . Addicts who are broke act as *agent
		provocateurs* for the peddlers, being rewarded by gifts
		of heroin or credit for supplies.  The Harrison Act made
		the drug peddler, and the drug peddler makes drug addicts."

		than a million lepers among our people.  Think what a shock
		the announcement would produce!  Yet drug addiction is far
		more incurable than leprosy, far more tragic to its victims,
		and is spreading like a moral and physical scourge. . . .
		Most of the daylight robberies, daring holdups, cruel murders
		and similar crimes of violence are now known to be committed
		chiefly by drug addicts, who constitute the primary cause
		of our alarming crime wave.   Drug addiction is more 
		communicable and less curable that leprosy. . . .
		Upon the issue hangs the perpetuation of civilization,
		the destiny of the world, and the future of the human
		race." [Quoted in Musto, *The American Disease*, p. 191]

1928		It is estimated that in Germany one out of every hundred

		and social philosopher: "Opium and morphine are certainly
		dangerous, habit-forming drugs.  But once the principle
		is admitted that is the duty of government to protect
		the individual against his own foolishness, no serious
		objections can be advanced against further encroachments.
		A good case could be made out in favor of the prohibition
		of alcohol and nicotine.   And why limit the governments
		benevolent providence to the protection of the individual's
		body only?  Is is not the harm a man can inflect on his
		mind and soul even more disastrous than any bodily
		evils?  Why not prevent him from reading bad books and
		seeing bad plays, from looking at bad paintings and statues
		and listening to bad music?   The mischief done by bad
		ideologies, surely, is much more pernicious, both for
		the individual and for the whole society, than that

		commitment to an institution," by the World Health
		Organization in 1962. [World Health Organization,
		*The Treatment of Drug Addicts*, p. 5]

1964		An editorial in *The New York Times* calls attention
		to the fact that "the Government continues to be the tobacco
		industry's biggest booster.  The Department of Agriculture
		lost $16 million in supporting the price of tobacco in the
