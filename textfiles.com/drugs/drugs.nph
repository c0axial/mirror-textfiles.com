       This is one of a series of compilations I am creating of the
       various techniques used to perphorm actions that aught not be
       perphormed (but will be done anyway, so why not do it right?).
       I am expecting to have maybe ten or so of these compilations
       by the time I am done.  I realized the need phor some phorm of
       organization of this sort of inphormation when I came across
       phour meg of shit like this.  Out of that phour meg, two meg was
       totaly redundant, one meg was corrupted to the point of not
       being able to read it, and of the other meg, everything that
       was actually usephul was scattered everywhere in bits and pieces.
       Now I personally am a strong proponant of peacephul world Anarchy,
       but I would really rather not try to make something phun like
       nitroglycerin (to use something extremely dangerous that I saw
       phrequently in all that shit) without having a complete set of
       instructions.  Whenever it was possible, I have given credit to
       the author of the original article, although I phound many
       articles which were the same, word phor word, but with dipherent
       authors, phorcing me to chose one of them.  Sorry if I chose
       wrong.

       The compiler of this phile apologizes to the authors of the
       articles within phor any alterations done to their documents.
       This was unavoidable, as most of these texts were nearly 
       unreadable by the time I got them.  I assume this is due to
       various changes made by people who had been in possesion of
       them bephore me, and to the slow corruption of the data as it
       was sent over innumerable fone lines phrom modem to modem. To
       avoid the phurther corruption of this inphormation, I would
       ask two things:

          1. That any comments, notes, additions, etc. be placed at
             the very end of this phile, not just stuck wherever you
             pheel like it.  I have put a sample addition in at the
             end of this file for convenience.  Please leave:
                -  Your name (your phake name that would be used phor
                   BBS' and such, not your real name)
                -  The date
                -  Where you can be reached (BBS' etc.)
                -  The inphormation you wish to leave
          2. That any random corruptions phound while reading (such
             as the word "MARIJUANA" appearing as "MARI´UANA") are
             phixed (I'm sure that some smartass will be tempted to
             phix the example I have just given.  Please don't).

       Thank you phor your cooperation in this matter.  Please give
       this phile to whoever you can, knowing that it will probably
       have grown substantially by the next time you phind it.  Also,
       when you do phind it again, and it is a newer version than you
       have, delete the older version and only distribute the newer
       one.

                                 POT
                                 ---


   Pot, grass, or marijuana is available anywhere in the country, as
the black market is widespread and thriving very well. Marijuana goes
under a whole slew of names, such as Acapulco gold, Panama red, Vietnam
green,  and New York white. All of these names depict the potency and
place of natural origin. Mexican and Vietnamese marijuana are probably
the best on the American market. Middle Eastern grass is also highly
prized, but not so readily available. There is no way of knowing what
you are buying, without first trying it, as most grasses look alike and
smell very similar regardless of potency. The most interesting of all
the different types of grasses is New York white, as it is natural
growth of high potency in a large metropolitan city. It is often found
in vacant lots, growing by the side of alleys, and in schoolyards; but,
strangely enough, the place where it has cropped up in abundance is in
the sewers. The Department of Health and Sanitation have attempted to
explain this phenomenon in several published reports. They have stated
that the practice by illegal users of dumping marijuana seeds down the
toilet, to prevent arrests, has resulted in massive subterranean growths.
These growths were held directly responsible for many floods and blocked
sewers. Apparently, according to the report, the conditions in the sewers
are ideal for the growth of marijuana. It is damp and warm, and there is
enough debris lying around to make good fertilizer. The sewer plants
usually reach a height of of between 12 and 15 feet and are bleached
white because of the lack of sunlight. This could answer a lot of
questions - such as what the rats were doing in the middle of the Park
Avenue mall.

                            GROWING POT I
                            -------------


   Most seeds are fertile, but the best are from Mexico. Never in any
circumstances throw seeds away, since marijuana is a weed and will grow
almost anywhere. The first step is to soak your seeds overnight in clean,
lukewarm water. Your container should be a standard planter box. If this
is not available, a plastic dish tray about two inches deep will serve
just as well. Fill the container with washed fine sand and shredded
sphagnum moss. If this is not readily available, you can use regular
soil. The soil should be packed firmly, and watered well so that the
excess water is allowed to run off. Dig furrows the full length of the
container about 1/2 inch deep. Now you are ready to sow your seeds. Do
so every inch. Fill in each furrow with soil, moss, and water. Cover the
container with a clear plastic sheet, and place it in a warm location
where there are at least six hours of sunlight a day. The plants now
remain on their own until they develop their first true leaves.
   Even if the material mentioned about is not available, almost the same
degree of success can be accomplished by placing the seeds on several
layers of water-soaked paper towels. Now cover the seeds with a plastic
sheet just as above, and expose to sunlight.
   In about one week, signs of life should start to appear. Within two
weeks, definite little leaves should be present. This is the time to
transplant. The plot you intend to use for your transplant should be
carefully prepared. Manure should be used for at least one week in
advance of the actual transplant. The soil should be similar to the
original soil used in the germinating box. All other weeds, in the
general area of your plot, should be pulled up to allow your plant as
much freedom of growth as possible.
   The original germinating box should be watered the day before you are
going to transplant, so as to make the move easier on the plants, and cut
root damage to a minimum. The plants should be placed in holes two to
three inches deep, depending on the size of the plant. The earth around
the plant should be loose, and, if possible, some earthworms should be
added. If there is a lack of sunlight, a simple ring of tin foil around
the plant can be very helpful. The first few days are the most critical
after the actual transplant. If the plants survive the shock, there should
be no reason why they shouldn't grow into healthy, fully grown plants
(which means, in certain climates, fifteen to twenty feet high).
   Very little care is needed after this stage, with the exception of
fertilization. For fertilizers, one can use manure, soluble nitrogen,
nitrate of soda, sulfate of ammonia, or rotting garbage (which has always
been popular). To produce a stronger plant, one can clip off the lower
leaves; do this only when the plant reaches a height of at least three
feet. The ground surrounding your plant should be kept clear of other
weeds but, strangely enough, insects ignore marijuana and do not harm it.
   As a rule, it is better to wait until the plants have gone to seed
before they are cut, but, if you're greedy, you can kill the goose that
laid the golden egg. The best agent for drying is the sun, but if you
live in the city it could prove embarrassing and dangerous to have five
to ten foot marijuana trees on your fire escape - in this case a sun lamp
can be used. When using the sun, drying usually takes about two weeks.
With a sun lamp, the pot is smokable after only three or four days. When
drying is done, separate the leaves and crush them. This will be the
finest smoke, unless you have a female plant. If so, save the blossoms
for the most potent smoke there is. The stems and twigs can be chopped
up and smoked in a pipe, or sold to a friend.
   Grass is basically a weed and can be grown anywhere, including indoors
with artificial light. A sun lamp works well from a distance of two to
three feet. For an interesting experiment, use infra-red light on part
of your crop and a sun lamp on the other part, then compare. A bathtub
or cement mixer is an ideal planter for the city dweller.

                            GROWING POT II
                            --------------


   This method is slightly more complicated than the last, but has
achieved really good results. First of all, you need a germinating box.
This is constructed as follows: Take one wooden milk crate and cut away
the sides to six inches from its bottom. Cover the opening with clear
plastic, leaving one flap open. Nail a strip of wood across the top and
fix to it a sixty-watt light bulb. Now you have your germinating box.
You will need Kitty Litter and milorganite. Take one part manure or
milorganite and mix with five parts Kitty Litter, and fill the germinating
box with two or three inches of this mixture and saturate with water.
Now, place seeds, 20 to 30 per square inch, on top of the soil and cover
with a quarter inch of milorganite and Kitty Litter. Keep the sixty-watt
light bulb on twenty-four hours a day. When the seeds have broken the
surface, use the bulb only as a supplement for regular sunlight.
   The plants should be grown in the germinating box for one month, and
then transplanted. To transplant, select a spot with reasonably fertile
soil, and of course reasonably safe from being discovered. When this is
done, dig a hole about one foot deep and as wide as necessary. Leave each
seedling room enough to grow; in other words, don't crowd them together.
   To help stimulate growth, use peat, milorganite, manure, or any of the
fertilizers mentioned in the first method, before planting. After planting,
water your plants, and use about a cup of hydrated lime per square yard of
your plot.
   Marijuana usually takes four to eight months to mature, but it does
adapt amazingly well to almost any growing season. You can usually tell
the female plant, as it will be the smaller of the two. It should be
treated with special care.
   To cure your crop, the ideal method is to hang the plants upside down
in a barn or similar structure, where the ventilation is good. Now let the 
crop take its time. If you are in a hurry for some reason, and do not have
a barn available, you can dry your crop in the oven at a temperature below
200 degrees. A sun lamp can also be used as in the first method. Grading
marijuana goes as follows: The most potent type of all is the female
blossom (the sticky cluster of small leaves and seeds just near the tip of
the female plant). The small female inside upper leaves are also very
potent. They are often found covered with resin and are considered the
second grade. The third grade is the upper female leaves, which are potent
but not as much as the first two grades. The fourth and final grade is
made up of the male blossoms and all the male leaves on the upper half
of the stem.
   If you decide against growing your own pot, for one reason or another,
you still should have no difficulty in obtaining grass. When buying grass,
or anything illegal, there are several important things to remember. First,
and probably most important, is not to buy on the street, and in no
circumstances buy from a stranger. Believe it or not, the cops are paying
out millions of dollars a year to keep plainclothesmen wandering around
the streets trying to bust people. There is another reason that buying
on the street is a bad scene: You don't get a chance to try the stuff
before you buy it. The chances will be very good that when you get home,
you will find that you have bought some of the best-tasting parsley or
oregano that you have ever smoked.

                            Cooking With Pot
                            ----------------


   Many people after cleaning their grass throw away the seeds, stems,
and twigs. I would highly recommend that you save these, as there are
many recipes for these odds and ends. A tasty hot drink that resembles
tea can be made very simply by tying up all the waste from your stash
into a muslin ball or into a piece of cheesecloth. Use the quantity you
have on hand, as the quantity will determine the strength and potency.
Now, drop the cheesecloth containing the grass into a kettle of water,
and bring the water to a boil. Allow the kettle to boil for a few minutes,
and then remove it from the flame and let it steep for another five
minutes with the grass still inside. After this, the drink is ready.
Just add sugar and lemon to taste.
   If you decide against growing pot, and want to eat your seeds, there
is an interesting recipe for "seed pancakes". It is prepared by lightly
toasting a quarter of a cup of seeds into a large frying pan. Now, take
the seeds from the frying pan and add them to a mixture of one cup of
pancake mix, one egg, a quarter cup of milk, and one tablespoon of butter.
Beat this mixture until it is smooth and creamy. Heat a frying pan with
a small amount of butter, then pour in pancake batter. Turn the pancakes
as they start to look done, or when the edges begin to turn brown. Repeat
procedure until all the batter used. Serve pancakes with butter, maple
syrup, and honey.
   For a stimulating drink (sounds like all the rest of the cookbooks),
place eight ounces milk, a few spoonfuls sugar, a tablespoon malted milk,
half a banana, a half tablespoon grass, and three betel nuts in a blender.
Keep the blender working full speed for a few minutes, then strain and
serve.
   If you like candy, it's very simple to make some using pot. Take a
quarter cup of powdered grass and add water until it equals a full cup.
Mix this with four cups sugar and two and a half cups corn syrup. Now
heat in a large pot to 310 degrees, and add red food coloring and mint
flavoring. Remove the pot from the stove, and allow the mixture to cool
a little, before pouring it onto wax paper. When the candy's cool, cut
it into squares and eat.
   One of the most common recipes for cooking with pot is spaghetti. This
recipe doesn't take too much special preparation: Just when you add your
oregano, add at the same time a quarter cup grass, and allow it to simmer
with the sauce. Be sure to use well-cleaned grass, unless you can get into
eating twigs and stems. Another way of serving pot with spaghetti is to
grind it up very fine and mix it with some ground cheese. Then sprinkle
the cheese-pot mixture over the sauce just before eating.
   Dessert is probably the most important stage of the meal, since it
will be the last thing your guests remember before they pass out all
over your table. For an interesting dessert, grind a quarter ounce of
grass very finely and add enough water so it forms a paste. Now separately
dissolve one and a half cups sugar into two cups milk. Add to this your
pot paste and one lemon rind grated. Beat in a half cup heavy cream, until
the mixture is firm and thick. Now pour the mixture into ice cube trays
and freeze. Just before you're ready to serve, rebeat the frozen mush until
it becomes light and fluffy.
   Since everyone has a private recipe for an aphrodisiac, why shouldn't
I put one in here? I've heard people tell me, in all seriousness, that
they believe the only true aphrodisiac is a case of beer in the back seat
of a '56 Chevy. Well, if you're not into that, you might as well try this
recipe, because it's got to work better than a case of beer. Pound one
tablespoon unground mace, two cantharides beetles, one teaspoon fresh red
saffron, and one teaspoon of the best quality grass you can find. Pound
all the ingredients together until they form a powder. Now add one pint
of water and heat to the boiling point. After boiling for a few minutes,
reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes or so, until the liquid is
reduced to about a quarter of a cup. This can be served as a drink or
over brown rice. I have not tried this recipe, as I have been unable to
locate any cantharides.
   If you happen to be in the country at a place where pot is being grown,
here's one of the greatest recipes you can try. Pick a medium-sized leaf
off the marijuana plant and dip it into a cup of drawn butter, add salt,
and eat.

                            HOW TO MAKE HASH
                            ----------------


   Hashish, or hash, is nothing more than the essence of the marijuana
plant extracted and hardened into a block. Hash is usually smoked in a
pipe, although there are many recipes that employ it as an ingredient.
   I have heard people say that hash has a different effect than pot.
This is not true, in the sense that there is no difference between the
two, with the exception being that hash is a good deal stronger. The most
amazing thing about hashish is the price on the black market. I say the
price is amazing because, with one kilo (2.2 lbs.) of grass, a person can
easily make seven or eight ounces of hash.

   The process for extracting the essence of marijuana is a simple one,
but it requires the utmost care. You need a kilo of grass (pot, for you
oatmeal-brains out there) to begin with, and a screen to sift it through.
A kilo of grass usually comes in a block, compressed together, so break
down the block and gently put it through the screen. Remove all the dirt
and foreign objects, but do not take out the stems. The seeds should
also be taken out, as they are much too greasy for good hash (but save
them!). Now that you have separated the kilo and sifted it, place it
in a large pot and cover with rubbing alcohol (about one and a half
gallons per kilo). Now boil the mixture for about three hours. Be sure
to use a hot plate or electric stove rather than gas, as alcohol is
highly inflammable, and should never be exposed to a naked flame. After
three hours, strain liquids out of the pot and store in a plastic
container labeled "solution 1". Now take the mush you have left and 
repeat the boiling with fresh alcohol for another three hours. After two
alcohol extractions, each time using fresh alcohol, follow the same
procedure but substitute water for alcohol, but for only one hour. This
boiling procedure with water should be performed twice. Once these
procedures have been performed, strain off the liquids again and store
in another container, and label "solution 2". Now reduce volumes of both
solutions by boiling in separate pots, turn down the heat as each solution
begins to thicken. When each solution is reasonably thickened, combine
them and boil a little more on the hot plate. At this point the solution
should have the consistency of modeling clay. Now heat a cupful of
turpentine, and add to the mush. Be extra careful with the turpentine,
as even the vapors are flammable. Add 2 ozs. of pine resin and stir pot
for ten minutes, under low heat. Now pour mush into a baking tin, two or
three inches deep, and heat in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.
After this you should have some really good hash but, if the hash is
still greasy after this last step, just leave it in the oven for another
ten minutes or so until it dries out. Be careful not to burn the hash.
   This last recipe is for the extraction of hashish from marijuana,
but in the Middle Eastern countries, where they can afford it, there is
another method for the preparation of hash. When the hemp or marijuana
plants are drying, they are hung upside down in a room lined with burlap.
As the plants dry, the resin and smaller leaves fall onto the burlap.
When, after a few weeks, the burlap is taken up, the material covering
it is the finest-quality marijuana extraction possible. This substance
is taken and boiled, then compressed together to form a hard solid.
   Hash can be smoked either in a pipe or by mixing it with tobacco in a
cigarette. Traditionally, hashish has been smoked in a hookah or water
pipe, which is nothing more than a large pipe that takes the smoke and
cools it by running it through water. The hookah is more than just a pipe
in many Middle Eastern countries, since it has more than one hose, and
more than one smoker can participate at a time. I have heard that
substituting wine or flavored brandy for the water is a fantastic way
to get there.

                           COOKING WITH HASH
                           -----------------


   Hash is also an excellent way to enhance your cooking. It has had
a long history in the kitchen, going all the way back to the early
civilizations around the Ganges River. It is also noted that many
famous personalities throughout history had experiences with hashish.
Marco Polo on his return to Italy mentioned frequently in his diary a
strange substance that put a man in a drunkenlike stupor, yet it was
unlike anything he had experienced before.

Hash Cookies
------------
4 cups sifted flour                     1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder                1/2 cup butter
4 eggs                                  3/4 cup honey

Mix baking powder, salt, and flour together in a bowl, then add to this the
eggs and honey. Work the mixture with your hands until it forms a dough.
Roll the dough out and cut into three-inch squares. Now put dough aside and
work on the filling.
1/2 cup chopped dates                   1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup raisins                         1 whole grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon ground ginger                1/8 oz. powdered hash
1 teaspoon cinnamon                     1 cup chopped figs
1/2 cup ground almonds                  1/2 cup ground walnuts

Put  all the ingredients into a pan and mix with 1/2 cup water. Heat until
fruits are softened and water has evaporated. Pour mixture into a skillet,
add three tablespoons butter, and heat for five minutes. The filling is now
ready. Place a heaping tablespoon of filling on each piece of pastry. Fold
up the edges of the pastry, to keep the filling in, and bake at 350 degrees
for about 25 minutes. This recipe usually makes between two and three dozen
cookies.

Hash Soup
---------
3 eggs                                  1 teaspoon powdered hashish
2 oz. sifted flour                      2 oz. small noodles
1/4 can cooked peas                     4 tablespoons canned tomato paste
1/2 cup chopped chicken livers          1/2 cup chopped turnip
1/2 cup chopped onion

Take a large pot and grease the bottom with 1/4 cup olive oil. Place in the
pot the half chopped onions, chicken livers, and turnip. Cook for half hour
over low heat. Now add a pint and a half of water, three tablespoons butter,
four tablespoons tomato paste, the peas, and the noodles. Mix flour with a
cup of water and make a paste. Stir paste and powdered hash into the pot.
Add salt and pepper, and boil for 15 minutes, stirring constantly. As soon
as the soup is off the fire, add the eggs and serve immediately.

Hash Brown Bananas
------------------ 
4 bananas                               2 slices bacon
2 teaspoons powdered hash               4 tablespoons brown sugar

Cut the bananas into a skillet and fry until slightly brown. Do not overcook.
At the same time, fry the bacon in the same pan, for it adds an interesting
flavor to the bananas. Mix the powdered hash with the brown sugar. Then wrap
each fried banana with a strip of bacon, and serve with hash and brown sugar
sprinkled on top.

Hashish Brownies
----------------
1/2 teaspoon salt                       1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup cake flour                      3 eggs
1 cup sugar                             1/2 cup sweet butter
3 oz. unsweetened chocolate             5 grams powdered hash

Melt the chocolate and butter together, then add sugar and hash. The mixture
must be beaten until it is creamy. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt
together, and then add to mixture. Pour the mixture into a cookie tray and
bake for thirty minutes at 375 degrees. When cool, cut brownies into small
squares and top with chopped nuts.

                                   LSD
                                   ---


   I think, of all the drugs on the black market today, LSD is the most
interesting and the strangest. It is the most recent major drug to come to
life in the psychedelic subculture. Huxley experimented with mescaline many
years before psychedelics reached their mass-market proportions, but this
experimentation was not with the same frame of mind as these drugs are
handled today. Probably the great-granddaddy to the whole psychedelic
community was Antonin Artaud, who personally experimented with peyote in
Mexico. The difference between Huxley's and Artaud's experimentation was
that Huxley managed to keep his experiences under laboratory controls,
which he set up himself, whereas Artaud allowed his experiences to become
part of his life. Artaud was changed by his encounters with peyote, but is
this bad? A dirty shirt is also changed when it is washed. Through this
change, Artaud was able to see and understand ideas and concepts on a
different level. He was able to tear apart rationalizations, without
regard for contemporary methods of organization, or even contemporary
versions of truth. Artaud found, in his own way, his own truth and his
own structure of values. They locked him up....

   I died at Rodez under electroshock.
   I died. Legally and medically dead.
   Electroshock coma lasts fifteen minutes. A half an hour or more and
then the patient breathes.
   Now one hour after the shock, I still had not awakened and had stopped
breathing. Surprised at my abnormal rigidity, an attendant had gone to get
the physician in charge, who, after examining me with a stethoscope, found
no more signs of life in me.

   This passage is taken from The Artaud Anthology, published by City
Lights Publishers. I find it extremely difficult to throw this off as the
ravings of a madman for, if that be true, then there can be no truth, only
madness and sanity, logic and illogic. If one then accepts the acceptable,
he finds a narrow channel is clear, but the presence of illogic and the
so-called insanities will always pry and harp in the distance.
   LSD has never caused insanity. It does not have that power. Only man
can distinguish between sanity and insanity. I have never seen an insane
bird. Granted there are some individuals who shouldn't take psychedelics,
but this is, and must be, their choice. All LSD does is allow a man to
look upon ordinary things, everyday things, and even on himself, many
times for the first time, with clarity of vision. He can look and not
be hampered by false-propped values and socially limited scope. He can
look upon the world and see beauty where it did not exist before. He can
perceive the ugliness for the first time. He can roar with laughter at the
multitude of absurdities surrounding him. He can look into himself and see
truthfully the mildew and the rot.
   LSD cannot bring out latent qualities in your personality. It cannot
make you into a crazy, just as it cannot make you into a warmer, more
beautiful person. What LSD can do is show you what you as a person are
comprised of, and break down truthfully your make-up. LSD is not a religion,
and I've never found anything really divine about it at all. The real
religion, if you want to put it in those terms, is the being itself. LSD is
nothing more than a medium to discover the essence of being.
   LSD, or acid, has been illegal for and last decade or so; therefore
it is readily available on the black market. When buying anything on the
black market, there are a couple of things to note, but these are especially
important with acid.

[1> Never buy from a stranger, or on the street.
[2> Never front money.
[3> If you are holding a large amount of money, do not go anywhere alone
    with someone you do not trust. Many people who have got into dealing
    pot and acid are, in reality, junkies.
[4> When going to make a deal for dope, do not take a weapon with you. This
    is provoking violence and legal hassles. If you don't trust the guy,
    then don't deal with him.
[5> Never buy a large quantity of any drug without first sampling it.
[6> When making a deal for acid and you are at the dealer's apartment, do
    not accept food or drink from him; for the real acid may be in the food
    rather than the cap you sample.
[7> Bad acid is nothing more than speed, or rat poison.
[8> A long time ago there was a substance called L.B.J. going around. If
    you happen to come across it, do not buy it. L.B.J. is a mixture of
    acid, belladonna, and heroin. It is the freakiest, worst, most fucked
    up trip you will ever go on. Belladonna in quantity is a deadly poison.
[9> About 99 percent of all of what is claimed to be T.H.C. (synthetic pot)
    that is for sale on the street is not really T.H.C. at all. The expense
    of making synthetic pot is said to be about $15 per capsule, and a
    capsule of alleged T.H.C. usually sells on the street for about $3 - $6.
    Obviously the vendors are either philanthropists (not likely) or they
    are selling you something other than T.H.C.
[10> When buying grass, watch out for damp grass or grass sprayed with
     sugar, as this adds a lot of weight to the dope.
[11> Another favorite con game is "in the front, out the back". This usually
     occurs when your dealer tells you he is going up to an apartment to get
     your stuff, but you have to front the money, and wait for him on the
     street. You may be waiting a long time.
[12> Do not attempt to smuggle any drugs across the border from Mexico. The
     federal government has imposed a crackdown and they're busting people
     left and right.

                       MAKING LSD IN THE KITCHEN
                       -------------------------


[1> Grind up 150 grams of morning glory seeds or Hawaiian wood rose seeds.
[2> In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
[3> Filter the solution through a tight screen.
[4> Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
[5> For two days allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alcohol.
[6> Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it "1".
[7> Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of wood alcohol for two days.
[8> Filter and throw away the mush.
[9> Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled "1".
[10> Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evaporate.
[11> When all the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains. This should
     be scraped up and put into capsules.

     30 grams of morning glory seeds = one trip
     15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = one trip

Many companies, such as Northop-King, have been coating their seeds with a
toxic chemical, which is poison. Order seeds from a wholesaler, as it is
much safer and cheaper. Hawaiian wood rose seeds can be ordered directly

        To make synthetic acid, you need a basic understanding of chemistry
and access to a lab. Since I don't quite understand all the chemical hocus-
pocus, I'm going to cop out and quote you the patent for it. If you don't
understand chemistry, just skip this recipe and go on to the next one for
acid, it's much simpler.

Preparation for Lysergic Acid Amides:

   This invention relates to the preparation of lysergic acid amides
and to a novel intermediate compound useful in the preparation of said
amides.
   Although only a few natural and synthetic amides of lysergic acid
are known, they possess a number of different and useful pharmacologic
properties. Especially useful is ergonovine, the N-(1(+)-1-hydroxyisopropyl)
amide of d-lysergic acid, which is employed commercially as an oxytocic
agent.
   Attempts to prepare lysergic acid amides amides by the usual methods
of preparing amides, such as reacting an amine with lysergic acid chloride
or with ester of lysergic acid, have been unsuccessful. United States
Patents #2,090,429 and #2,090,430, describe processes of preparing lysergic
acid amides and, although these processes are effective to accomplish the
desired conversion of lysergic acid to one of its amides, they are not
without certain disadvantages.
   By my invention I have provided a simple and convenient method of
preparing lysergic acid amides, which comprises reacting lysergic acid
with trifluoroacetic anhydride to produce a mixed anhydride of lysergic
and trifluoroacetic acids, and when reacting the mixed anhydride with a
nitrogenous base having at least one hydrogen linked to nitrogen. The
resulting amide of lysergic acid is isolated from the reaction mixture by
conventional means.
   The reaction of the lysergic and the trifluoroacetic anhydride
is a low temperature reaction, that is, it must be carried out at a
temperature below about 0 degrees C. The presently preferred temperature
range is about -15 C. to about -20 C. This range is sufficiently high to
permit the reaction to proceed at a desirably fast rate, but yet provides
an adequate safeguard against a too rapid temperature and consequent
excessive decomposition of the mixed anhydride.
   The reaction is carried out in a suitable dispersing agent, that is,
one which is inert with respect to the reactants. The lysergic acid is
relatively insoluble in dispersants suitable for carrying out the reaction,
so it is suspended in the dispersant.
   Two gallons of trifluoroacetic anhydride are required per mol. of
lysergic acid for the rapid and complete conversion of the lysergic acid
into the mixed anhydride. It appears that one molecule of the anhydride
associates with or favors an ionic adduct with one molecule of the lysergic
which contains a basic nitrogen atom and that it is the adduct which reacts
with a second molecule of trifluoroacetic anhydride to form the mixed
anhydride along with one molecule of trifluoroacetic acid. The conversion
of the lysergic acid to the mixed anhydride occurs within a relatively
short time, but to insure a complete conversion the reaction is allowed
to proceed for about one to three hours.
   The mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids is relatively
unstable, especially at room temperature and above, and must be stored at
a low temperature. This temperature instability of the mixed anhydride
makes it desirable that it be converted into a lysergic acid amide without
unnecessary delay. The mixed anhydride itself, since it contains a lysergic
acid group, also can exist in the reaction mixture in large part as an
ionic adduct with trifluoroacetic anhydride or trifluoroacetic acid. It
is important for maximum yield of product that the lysergic acid employed
in the reaction be dry. It is most convenient to dry the acid by heating
it at about 105-110 degrees C. in a vacuum of about 1 mm. of mercury or
less for a few hours, although any other customary means of drying can
be used.
   The conversion of the mixed anhydride into an amide by reacting the
anhydride with the nitrogenous base, such as an amino compound, can be
carried out at room temperature or below. Most conveniently the reaction
is carried out by adding the cold solution of the mixed anhydride to the
amino compound or a solution thereof which is at about room temperature.
Because of the acidic components present in the reaction mixture of the
mixed anhydride, about five mols or equivalents of the amino compound are
required per mole or equivalent of mixed anhydride for maximal conversion
of the mixed anhydride to the amide. Preferably a slight excess over the
five mols is employed to insure complete utilization of the mixed anhydride.
If desired, a basic substance capable of neutralizing the acid components
present in the reaction mixture, but incapable of interfering with the
reaction, can be utilized. A strongly basic tertiary amine is an example
of such a substance. In such case, about one equivalent of amino compound
to be converted to a lysergic acid amide, as well as any unconverted
lysergic acid, can be removed from the reaction mixture and can be
re-employed in other conversions.
   A preferred method for carrying out the process of this invention is
as follows:
   Dry lysergic acid is suspended in a suitable vehicle as acetonitrile,
and the suspension is cooled to about -15 C. or -20 C. To the suspension is
then added slowly a solution of about two equivalents of trifluoroacetic 
anhydride dissolved in acetonitrile and previously cooled to about -20
degrees C. The mixture is maintained in a low temperature for about one
to three hours to insure the completion of the formation of the mixed
anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids.
   The solution of the mixed anhydride is then added to about five
equivalents of the amino compound which is to be reacted with the mixed
anhydride. The amino compound need not be previously dissolved in a
solvent, although it is usually convenient to  use a solvent. The
reaction is carried out with the amino compound or solution of amino
compound at about room temperature or below. The reaction mixture is
allowed to stand at room temperature for one or two hours, preferably
in the dark, and the solvent is then removed by evaporation in vacuo at a
temperature which desirably is not greatly in excess of room temperature.
The viscous residue, consisting of the amide together with excess amine
and amine salts, is taken up in a mixture of chloroform and water. The
water is separated and the chloroform solution which contains the amide
is washed several times with water to remove excesss amine and the
various amine salts formed in the reaction, including that of any
unconverted lysergic acid. The chloroform solution is then dried and
evaporated, leaving a residue of lysergic acid amide. The amide so
obtained can be purified by any conventional procedure.
   Dispersants suitable for the purpose of this invention are those
which are liquids at the low temperatures employed for the reaction
and are of such an inert nature that they will not react preferentially
to the lysergic acid with trifluoroacetic anhydride. Among suitable
dispersants are acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, propionitrile, and
the like. Additional suitable agents will readily be apparent from
the foregoing enumeration. Of those listed above, acetonitrile is
preferred since it is non-reactive and mobile at the temperature used,
and is relatively volatile and hence readily separable from the reaction
mixture by evaporation in vacuo.
   A wide variety of nitrogenous bases such as amino compounds can be
reacted with the mixed anhydride to form a lysergic acid amide. As
previously stated, the amino compound must contain a hydrogen atom
attached to nitrogen to permit amide formation. Illustrative amino
compounds which can be reacted are ammonia, hydrazine, primary amines
such as glycine, ethanolamine, diglycylglycine, norephedrine,
aminopropanol, butanolamine, diethylamine, ephedrine, and the like.
   When an alkanolamine such as ethanolamine or aminopropanol is reacted 
with the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids, the
reaction product contains not only the desired hydroxy amide but also,
to a minor extent, some amino ester. These two isometric substances arise
because of the bi-functional nature of the reacting alkanolamine.
Ordinarily the amino ester amounts to no more than 25-30 percent of the
total amount of reaction product, but in cases where the amino group is
esterically hindered, the proportion of amino ester will be increased.
The amino ester can readily be converted to the desired hydroxy amide,
and the over-all yield of the latter increased by treating the amino
ester, or the mixture of amide and ester with alcoholic alkali to cause
the rearrangement of the amino ester to the desired hydroxyamide. Most
conveniently the conversion is carried out by dissolving the amino ester
or mixture containing the amino ester in a minimum amount of alcohol and
adding to the mixture a twofold amound of 4 N alcoholic potassium hydroxide
solution. The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for several
hours, the alkali is neutralized with acid, and the lysergic acid amide is
then isolated and purified.
   It should be understood that, as used herein, the term "lysergic acid"
is used generically  as inclusive of any or all of the four possible
stereoisomers having the basic lysergic acid structure. Isomers of the
lysergic acid series can be separated or interconverted by means known
to the art.
   This invention is further illustrated in the following specific examples.

Example One:
   Preparation of the mixed anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids:
   5.36 g. of d-lysergic acid are suspended in 125 ml. of acetonitrile
and the suspension is cooled to about -20 degrees C. To this suspension is 
added a cold (-20 degrees C.) solution of 8.82 g. of trifluoroacetic
anhydride in 75 ml. of acetonitrile. The mixture is allowed to stand at
-20 degrees C. for about 1 1/2 hours during which time the suspended
material dissolves, and the d-lysergic acid is converted to the mixed
anhydride of lysergic and trifluoroacetic acids. The mixed anhydride can
be separated in the form of an oil by evaporating the solvent in vacuo at
a temperature below about 0 degrees centigrade.

Example Two:
   Preparation of d-lysergic and N,N-diethyl amide:
   A solution of the mixed anhydride of lysergic acid and trifluoroacetic
acid in 200 ml. of acetonitrile is obtained by reacting 5.36 g. d-lysergic
acid and 8.82 g. trifluoroacetic anhydride in accordance with the procedure
of example one. The acetonitrile solution containing mixed anhydride is
added to 150 ml. of acetonitrile containing 7.6 g. of diethylamine. The
mixture is held in the dark at room temperature for about two hours. The
acetonitrile is evaporated in vacuo leaving a residue which comprises the
"normal" and "iso" forms of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide together with
some lysergic acid, the diethylamine salt of trifluoroacetic acid and like
by-products. The residue is dissolved in a mixture of 150 ml. of chloroform
and 20 ml. of ice water. The chloroform layer is separated, and the aqueous
layer is extracted with four 50 ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform
extracts are combined and are washed four times with about 50 ml. portions
of cold water in order to remove residual amounts of amine salts. The
chloroform layer is then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the
chloroform is evaporated in vacuo. A solid residue of 3.45 gm. comprising
the "normal" and "iso" forms of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide is
obtained. This material is dissolved in 160 ml. of a 3-to-1 mixture of
benzene and chloroform, and is chromatographed over 240 g. of basic alumia.
As the chromatogram is developed with the same solvent, two blue
fluroescing zones appear on the alumina column. The more rapidly moving
zone is d-lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide which is eluted with about 3000 ml.
of the same solvent as above, the course of the elution being followed by
watching the downward movement of the more rapidly moving blue fluorescing
zone. The eluate is treated with tartaric acid to form the acid tartrate
of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide which is isolated. The acid tartrate
of d-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide melts with decomposition at about
190-196 degrees centigrade.
   The di-iso-lysergic acid N,N-diethyl amide which remains absorbed on
the alumia column as the second fluroescent zone is removed from the column
by elution with chloroform. The "iso" form of the amide is recovered by
evaporating the chloroform eluate to dryness in vacuo.

Example Three:
   Preparation of d-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide:
   A solution of the mixed anhydride of lysergic acid and
trifluoroacetic acid is prepared from 2.68 g. of d-lysergic acid and 4.4 g.
of trifluoroacetic acid anhydride in 100 ml. of acetonitrile by the method
of Example One. This solution is added to 6:03 g. of diethylaminoethylamine.
The reaction mixture is kept in the dark at room temperature for 1 1/2 hours.
The acetonitrile is evaporated, and the residue treated with chloroform
and water as described in Example Two. The residue treated comprising
d-iso-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide is dissolved in several ml.
of ethyl acetate, and the solution is cooled to about 0 degrees centigrade,
whereupon di-iso-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide separates in
crystalline form. The crystalline material is filtered off, and the filtrate
reduced in volume to obtain an additional amount of crystalline amide.
Recrystallization from ethyl acetate of the combined fractions of
crystalline material yields d-iso-lysergic acid N-diethylaminoethyl amide
melting at about 157-158 degrees centigrade. The optical rotation is as
follows:

        26
   [x] d  = + 372 degrees (c. = 1.3 in pyridine)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                           

                               LSD DOSAGES
                               -----------

   The basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of acid is
available and what medium of ingestion is used. Chemically the potency of
LSD-25 is measured in micrograms, or mics. If you're chemically minded or
making your own acid, then computing the number of mics is very important.
Usually between 300 to 500 micrograms (mics) is plenty for a five to eight
hour trip, depending on quality, of course. I have heard of people taking
as much as 1500 to 2000 mics. This not only extremely dangerous, it is also
wasteful.

   LSD comes packaged in many different forms. The proverbial sugar
cube is pretty passe', in the sense that other more feasible methods have 
taken its place. The most common are listed below.
[1> The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried drop of LSD on it, is
    always around. Usually one spot equals one trip.
[2> Capsuled acid is extremely tricky, as the cap can be almost any color,
    size, and potency. Always ask what the acid is cut with, as a lot
    of acid is cut with either speed or strychnine. Also note dosage.
[3> Small white or colored tablets have been known to contain acid, but, 
    as with the capsuled acid, it is impossible to tell potency, without
    asking.
[4> I have heard about some characters who attempted to shoot acid. Shooting
    any drug is a bad scene. Stay away from it. I cannot imagine what
    their rush was like, but would certainly advise against this form of
    drug abuse.

   There has been in the last few years a great deal of discussion about
the correct treatment for victims of bad LSD trips. When an individual
does go into a panic on acid, it is an extremely delicate situation. 
Although it has been said that tranquilizers, such as thorazine, will help
to calm the person down, be very careful, as certain drugs react violently
with tranquilizers (STP). My advice in a situation of that sort is just to
attempt to create an atmosphere of reassurance and sympathy. In no
circumstances, except real uncontrollable panic, should a person on acid
be taken to a city hospital. If you want a really freaky experience, spend
a couple of hours at any city hospital and watch the people die in the
halls!
   Talk to the person on acid and remind him that he is under the
influence of acid. Try to calm him down. Even a change of environment can
effectively reverse a bad trip.

                            HOW TO MAKE DRUGS
                            -----------------


  IN NO WAY AM I RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR ANY INJURIES CAUSED BY THE USE/MISUSE
OF THESE DRUGS.  YOU SHOULD TREAT THESE DRUGS LIKE ALCOHOL.  USE THEM ONLY
AS AN ADDED EXPERIENCE IN LIFE, RATHER THAN AN ESCAPE.
 
  THESE RECIPES ARE ALL FOUND IN A BOOK WHICH HAS RELIABLE SOURCES.
ALL SHOULD WORK IF MADE PROPERLY.
 

--> BANANDINE (MADE FROM BANANA!)
 
BANANAS DO CONTAIN A SMALL QUANTITY OF A MILD SHORT LASTING PSYCHODELIC
DRUG. THERE ARE BETTER WAYS OF GETTING HIGH BUT THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF
THIS IS THAT BANANAS ARE LEGAL (OF COURSE!)
 
1]  OBTAIN 15 LBS OF RIPE YELLOW BANANAS
2]  PEEL THEM ALL, EAT THE CHOW, KEEP THE PEELS.
3]  WITH A SHARP KNIFE, SCRAPE OFF THE INSIDES OF THE PEELINGS, AND SAVE
    THE SCRAPED MATERIAL.
4]  PUT ALL SCRAPED MATERIAL IN A LARGE POT AND ADD WATER.  BOIL FOR THREE
    TO FOUR HOURS UNTIL IT HAS ATTAINED A SOLID PASTE.
5]  SPREAD THIS PASTE ON COOKIE SHEETS AND DRY IN OVEN FOR ABOUT 20 MIN.
    TO A HALF AN HOUR.  THIS WILL RESULT IN A FINE BLACK POWDER
    ROLL IT UP AND SMOKE ABOUT 3-4 OF THOSE DUDES
 

--> COUGH SYRUP? (SURE, WHY NOT?)

MIX ROBOTUSSION A-C WITH AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF GINGER ALE AND DRINK.  NOTE
THAT YOU CAN OVERDOSE ON THIS ONE!
 

--> GLUE...YUCK!

PUT HALF A TUBE OF AIRPLANE GLUE ON ANY (I MEAN, IN ANY) PLASTIC BAG AND SNIFF
IT.  IT'S REALLY GROSS BUT SOME PEOPLE REALLY GET INTO IT..
 

--> HEROINE

DON'T WASTE YOUR LIFE ON IT...
 

--> PEANUTS!

1] OBTAIN A POUND OF PEANUTS.
2] SHELL THEM, SAVING THE SKINS AND DISCARDING THE SHELLS.
3] PORK OUT ON THE NUTS WHILE WATCHING DR. WHO ONE NIGHT.
4] GRIND UP THE SKINS, ROLL THEM, SMOKE THEM.


--> TOAD SKINS? YOU'RE CRAZY!!

1]  COLLECT 5-10 TOADS
2]  KILL THEM AS PAINLESSLY AS POSSIBLE AND SKIN THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
3]  ALLOW SKINS TO DRY ON THE FRIDGE FOR 4 TO 5 DAYS, OR UNTI THEY ARE
    BRITTLE.
4]  CRUSH INTO A POWDER AND SMOKE.  DUE TO THE BAD TASTE, MIX IT WITH MINT
    OR SOMETHING ELSE.
