Suggestions and Precautions for the Use of Hallucinogenic 
Drugs

1. Know your sources.  Many fake and adulterated versions of 
psychedelics are sold on the streets.

2. Do not attempt to pick wild psilocybin mushrooms without 
knowing what you are doing.

3. Cultivated psilocybin mushrooms vary greatly in potency.  
Get advice about dose before eating any.

4. Do not take psychedelics unless you are in good physical and 
psychological shape.

5. If you are trying one of the hallucinogenic drugs for the first 
time, take it with an experienced companion.

6. Take psychedelics only in comfortable settings on occasions 
when you have no responsibilities for at least the next twelve 
hours.

7. Remember that you may feel tired or drained of energy the 
following day.

8. Do not take psychedelics on a full stomach; you are less likely 
to feel nausea or other discomfort if your stomach is relatively 
empty.

9. Do not combine psychedelics with other drugs.  However, 
the interesting effects of psychedelics sometimes wear off while 
their stimulation continues.  If you feel agitated, restless, and 
unable to sleep at the end of an experience with one of these 
drugs, it may be appropriate to take a hypnotic dose of a 
sleeping pill or a minor tranquilizer.

10. Remember that hallucinogenic drugs can affect perception 
and thinking.  Do not drive, operate machinery, or engage in 
hazardous activities while under their influence.

11. Take psychedelics by mouth.  They are more likely to cause 
bad reactions by other routes of administration.

12. The best experiences with these drugs result from saving 
them for special occasions and the right circumstances.  Taking 
psychedelics just because they are available is less likely to 
produce valuable results.  Taking them to get yourself out of bad 
moods may intensify these moods.  Taking them frequently and 
carelessly reduces their potential to show you interesting aspects 
of yourself and the world around you.
