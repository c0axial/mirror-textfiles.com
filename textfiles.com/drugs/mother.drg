		       
		     My version of "Mother" by Pink Floyd.
		     =====================================

Mother give me a hit from the bong
Mother do you think this high will last very long?
Mother do you think they will try to smoke my bowls?
Oooh-ahhh
Mother should I hide it all?
Mother, Clinton smoked and he's our president
Mother it's outlawed by our government
Mother will they put me in jail to do some time?
Oooh-ahhh
Am I just wasted and high?
Hush now baby baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all your hemp dreams come true 
Mama's gonna share all of her drugs with you
Mam's gonna keep you flying high as if you had wings
She'll get you high, inhale and feel it's sting
Mam's gonna keep baby TOASTY and STONED
Oooh baked
Oooh baked
Oooh baked
Of course mama's gonna help pack the bowl

<solo>

Mother do you think the weed's good enough...for me
Mother do you think the weed's dangerous.....to me
Mother will it tear my little brain cells apart?
Oooh-ahhh 
Mother can I get it at K-Mart?
Hush now baby baby don't you cry 
Mama's gonna weigh all your 60 bags for you
Mama won't let any oregano get through
Mama's gonna light up when you get in
Mama will always find the new shipments come in
Mama's gonna keep the pot seed-free and clean
Oooh baked
Oooh baked
Oooh baked
You'll always be baked with me
Mother surely meant to be so HIGH...
