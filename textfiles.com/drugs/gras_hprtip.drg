okay, here's the text of the Hash and Weed Tips, available at The
Grasshopper, in Amsterdam.  I don't personally agree with everything,
but found the handout intriguing.  Oh, and Trent -- you said that
some people on this net have a scientific orientation, and some
have an orientation through experience...but some people might just
have both :-)  -- but your post was greatly appreciated because I'm
a big fan of keeping talk on the net respectful and kind :-)


Throughout the world and through the centuries, Hash and weed have been
used by people from different cultures.  But like with other stimulants,
using hash and weed is not without risk.  This is why we have compiled a
few hints for:
*Sensible use*
-Hash and weed originate from the cannabis plant (cannabis sativa).  The
effective substance is called Tetra-hydro-cannibol (THC).  It's effect
lasts 2 to 4 hours.  Hash and weed affect our consciousness, so that one
starts feeling comfortable.  Some people become talkative, others
reserved.  Some become active, others relaxed, one does not know in
advance how it will effect one; it may work out differently every time.
-Use hash for your pleasure, but not to smoke away stress and
uncertainty. You do not solve problems by lighting a joint.
*More advice*
-Your concentration will diminish when using hash and weed.  Sometimes
you even forget, what you said a moment before.  So do not use at
school, at your work or if you still have to study.
-Your reactions will also diminish under the influence of hash, so do not
drive!
-Eating hash or weed, like space cake, should be advised against.
Especially in the case of inexperienced users it could have a totally
adverse effect.
-Hash and weed often do not mix with alcohol.
-Sometimes you can become quite sick after using hash and weed; if this
happens, find a quiet spot and eat or drink something sweet.  AFter an
hour the worst will have passed.
*Who should not...?*
-Do not use hash or weed if you take medicines.   This also applies to
diabetics and epileptics.  And do not smoke when you are pregnant.
Do not buy hash and weed in the street.  find a cosy hash coffee shop,
and let people inform you about what to buy.
Avoid problems, do not carry hash or weed with you when you cross
borders.
