Q. WHAT IS COCAINE?

A.  Cocaine is an extract of the leaves of the coca plant
native to Central and S. America.  It is odorless, color-
less to white in a crystalline or powdery consistency.  It
acts as a stimulant drug with a primary central nervous
system action.  It effects the brain and body as speed or
amphetamine, though it is not chemically related.

Q. WHY DO PEOPLE THINK COCAINE IS SAFE?

A.  Cocaine does not create a physical dependence and
withdrawal as heroin.  Regular cocaine use does not cause
severe withdrawal symptoms in all people.  Rather, a
dependence for the brain stimulation is created.  It can
become a self-perpetuated and self-consuming drive for the
"high".  The high is short-lived and may give way to bad
mood, paranoid psychosis and sensory hallucinations.  At
high doses, cocaine may cause death.

Q. DO WE HAVE A COCAINE PROBLEM?

A.  Yes!  It is estimated that nearly 22 million people
have used cocaine, over 1 million are profoundly dependent,
and there are more than 5 million regular users.

Q. WHAT ARE THE MEDICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH COCAINE?  

A.  A steady physical deterioration and general health
failure are common.  Loss of energy, insomnia, sore throat
and nose bleeds, headaches, sinus problems and runny nose.
Lost sex drive or poor or decreased sexual performance.
Trembling, seizures or convulsions.  Nausea or vomiting.
Constant licking of lips or grinding of teeth.  Constant
sniffling or rubbing the nose.  Loss of consciousness,
trouble breathing or swallowing, heart palpitations and lack
of interest in personal health and hygiene.

From a psychiatric perspective, anxiety and irritability,
depression, panic, delusions and paranoia, lack of concen-
tration, hearing voices, loss of interest in friends and
non-drug related activites, memory problems, thoughts of
suicide, blackouts and compulsive behavior are key
indicators of cocaine dependence.

Q. WHAT OTHER INDICATIONS ARE THERE TO DEPENDENCE?

A.  Ask yourself:  do you need cocaine?  Do you think
you are addicted?  Are you unable to refuse it when it
is available?  Can you stop for one month?  Do you use
cocaine for perhaps 24 hrs. continuously?  Do you miss
work?  Do you prefer cocaine to talking with friends?  To
family activites?  To sex?  To food?  Do you use it alone?
Do you use cocaine before breakfast?  Do you fear being
discovered as a user?  Do you sell cocaine, or support your
buying through some illicit activity?

Q. CAN YOU DIE FROM COCAINE?

A.  Yes, many ways.  About 1,000 milligrams is said to be
lethal.  Personal tolerances and how the cocaine was taken
play an important role in determining a lethal dose.  Death
is fairly rapid in most cases, usually through convulsions
and heart and lung failure, and can occur in snorters,
injectors and free-base smokers.  Death can also come as a
result of heart attack, stroke or arrhythmia.  Suffocation
and drowning in one's own secretions can occure as well.
