LSD

Being trapped in another world all alone not knowing who you are, what 
you are, or where you are.  This could be very terrifying if you don't 
know what to expect, its all in your mind.  All you believe is hwat 
you see, but the questions is, is it really there?  You get the 
feeling of death and you look at the world in a much broader way.  The 
things you experience are outrageous.  You see things that are really 
not there, such as peoples faces disintegrates in front of you.  The 
walls move, the floor is like a wather bed, but once you look back it 
starts over.  You start to think everyone despieses you at this state 
of mind.  Also during this time you think your insane, but are you?  
Everything has a question, but no answers.  No one, can control the 
way you think, but you and you alone.
