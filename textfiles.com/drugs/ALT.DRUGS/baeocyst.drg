----------------------
baeocystin and norbaeocystin is present in Psilocybe Baeocystis, the book
"Magical and ritual uses of herbs" describes a case where a 7 years old
died of P.Baeocystis overdose , Baeocystin and norbaeocystin is a mild
respitory inhibitor (I think) , the book warns people with
respitory-diseases against this  
mushroom . You will probaly find references to studies in this book
(aviable from Rosetta).
