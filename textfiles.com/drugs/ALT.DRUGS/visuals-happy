Well, the first time i did Acid was about a year ago  (12/26/95) and was
one of the coolest things i have ever done.  I had never thought id do
drugs really, but id allways talked about doing Acid.  So one day a friend
of mine comes over and tells me he got some, just out of the blue. So
I diddnt know if id do it, but he said that he was going to so i was gonna
go and watch him.  I go to his house and he takes one.  Right now im under
the impression that his parents are gone and will be gone for the remainder
of the night(we are still in highschool BTW).  So he starts trippin out, 
and it looks totally cool, so i want to try it.  We each take about 3/4 or
one each.  So wile im waiting i decide to go to the store.  We walk there
and hes having 
quite a good time walking, and im just enjoying watching him.  I get to 
the store and buy some laffy taffys (love the things)  which turned out to
be a great choice.  So as we walk back i start getting the wierd writhing
thing, and we stop to smell flowers.  They were just killer.  I think i 
smelled one rose for about 15 min. straight.  We make it back to his house
and his parents are there.  This kinda bothers me, cause im seeing stuff
and laughing at everything.  So we go to his room and hang out.  Pretty soon
his parents come in and want him to rap a present for a wedding.  This was
totally freaky, but we have to do it cause we dont want them suspicius.  
We start wrapping, and totally get into it.  This was the nicest damn 
present ive ever seen.  

Later, we go for a walk around the block.  Its just getting dark and the
street lights are coming on.  We walk for a wile and i bump into my ex-
girlfriends mom.  We were pretty close so i had to stop and talk.  She 
started talking about he trip she to to las vegas, and suddenly every 
thing that she said was the most hilarious thing i had ever heard. It was
sooooo hard to talk, cause i was giggleing so much.  She must have thought
I was crazy.  Evently we got away and moved on.  We came to a street light
and i started stareing at it.  I could swear it was a huge eye.  The haze
around lights(well, i dont know if every one sees this but i do now since 
i did this) was huge and thick, and sorta looked like an eye.  My friend
was yelling about this car that was crawling like a worm.  He tried to show
me but i just diddnt get it.


Once again we went back to his house, and went to his room.  At this point 
i started to eat my laffy taffys and reading the jokes.  One joke inpaticular
which i still rember, almost killed me.  I had a peice of taffy in my mouth
and read "Where does a general keep his armies?"  I pondered it a bit and
read the answer. "In his sleeveies".  I started laughing so hard i inhaled
a bit of taffy and was choking.  I really diddnt care, because i had read
the most funny joke on earth, and if Montie Python is to be believed i 
should have died anyway.  Finaly i got better, just as i started peaking.
The first thing i did was look in the mirror.  I thought "Lets see somthing"
First thing i did was try and look mean.  Almost instantly  I grew horns,
a gotee and thin mustashes, and my eyebrows got real long and thin.  Of 
course i diddnt think it was myself, i thoutht it was the mirror, and i had
made it mad.  I became very scared of pissing off the mirror, and would not
look in it the rest of the night.  

Now I was really freaking out.  I made my friend leave with me and go to 
a diffrent friends house. I dont know why i wanted to leave, i just knew i 
had to.  

The friends house we were going to was about a mile away, and it was totally
dark outside.  It started out fine.  I saw faries flying around, and became
puzzled that so many people had windows in their houses.  As i was walking
i saw a dog in the road ahead of us, and almost died.  It, for some reason
scared me so bad that i had to cross the street and walk on the other side.
Later down the road we passed these two guys that kinda looked like us.  All 
of a sudden I had the feeling that i had jsut seen my self in about 6 years.
I got really excited about this and started talking loud.   When i finished 
talking  all the sound in the world went away.  Everything was totally 
silent.  It was a kinda errie, calm feeling, like every thing had just taken
a few minuits off to relax.  It made me feel good walking down the street.

A little later we got to our other friends hous, just as i started coming
down.  We talked and hung out, and had a pretty killer time.  She started
playing some music with a lot of samples in it, and it totally made me 
trip out.  I listend to it for a real long time, just listing to the voices
The cd was KMFDM v. Pig (which is a great cd BTW). After a wile we split
back to my first friends place, and started talking.  We decided that the
english language has too many unfriendly words like "Though" and that we
should patition the govermet to re-write it.  Think about it.  You can say
"Though"  whith just three letters- tho-.  I thought that the "ugh" made the
word unfriendly, which makes people not want to say it. I suppose this 
conversation loses something.....  Anyway,
After a wile i just layed down and enjoyed the light show.  I had the most
amasing open and closed eye visuals.  In his textured cieling i saw thousands
of skulls moving and growing and rotating (dont worry, I like skulls). When
I closed my eyes i millions of neon lights making pictures and landscapes.
I also saw some disturbing H.R. Giger type pictures.Scary. Eventually i 
fell into tone of the most peacefull sleeps i have ever had.

I have done Acid twice since, about 3 monthes between each. I have no 
intention of making it a habit, and in fact i might never do it again. But
I am glad i did do it, because since that time, I found out what i enjoy.
Its just having fun, and enjoying myself.  I have now applied that to my
every day life, and I have not been this happy in my life.  I do not 
believe that it was the drug that made me feel this way, I believe that it
let me accually see what i liked to feel, and I myself decided to be 
happy.
