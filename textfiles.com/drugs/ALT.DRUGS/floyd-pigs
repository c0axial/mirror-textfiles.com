Acid
   When Pink Floyd went on tour in April of 1994, I had a chance to see 
them in Houston Tx.  A friend of mine gave me some acid and said "don't 
worry, it's real good, no strictnine or nothing."  So I took it.  I 
never ,in a million years ,would have thought the acid was that good.  I 
saw a van full of midgets at the main gate of Rice stadium. Then when I 
got inside and actually saw Pink Floyd  I lost it.  My friend and I just 
stood there, paying homage to the immortal Floyd.  At one point I 
started crying just because it was the happiest moment of my life,  Then 
the pigs fell
