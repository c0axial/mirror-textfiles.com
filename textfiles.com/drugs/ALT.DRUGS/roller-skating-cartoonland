- Anyone dare say how their first time trippin' went? I took two hits within a half hour of each other.  And went rollerskating.  Damn, it seemed like cartoon land.  The wood floor seemed torise and fall like a piano keyboard, my feet seemed to melt right intothe floor.  Seemed more like a roller coaster ride than rollerskating.  I'm a very good skater and never did fall on my ass.It was drizzling when I drove back at night, the windshield wipers hadrainbow trails.  Tiny drops of rain came through as tie dyed T-shirtcolors, then the undertones of the Grateful Dead became crystal clear. --  rec.drugs.psychedelic
