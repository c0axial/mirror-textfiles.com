In response to questions referring to the time it takes the body to
cleanse itself from detectable urine traces, according to a national
report titled, "Drugs, Crime, and the Justice System", (published from the
Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice):

Single Use :                               3 Days
Moderate Use (4 times a week):             5 Days
Heavy Use (Daily smoking):                 10 Days
Chronic Heavy Use:                         21-30 Days

Although do keep in mind that there are many factors that effect the
outcome of the tests (potency of drug taken, testing methods,
metabolism, etc.) so this is just a estimate figure-so be careful out there.
