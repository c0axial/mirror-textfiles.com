This information is only for people who are mature enough to respect the
dangers involved with injecting heroin. These dangers include physical 
and mental addiction and the possibility of contracting a terrible 
disease like AIDS or hepatitis if the user doesn't take the time to be as
sanitary as possible and NOT SHARE NEEDLES.
-Alcohol swabs are available in a box of about 100 for $2 at Safeway.
-A commonly used syringe is the U-100. It is 1CC which is divided into 
100
 "units".
-The bottom of a soda pop can is commonly used as a "spoon" to dissolve 
 the heroin in. The bottom is torn off of a can as close to the bottom as 
 possible.
Procedure:
 The "spoon" is thoroughly cleaned with an alcohol swab. In this example 
black tar heroin is used. In my area a $15 chunk is about the size of 2 
tic-tac candies side-by-side and works just fine. It has no smell exept
for a faint smell of vinegar. It comes wrapped in plastic inside a tiny
balloon. A chunk is placed in the spoon. The syringe is used to suck up
about 50-75 units of water and squirt it into the spoon. The spoon is 
then heated from the bottom with a lighter to make it dissolve better.
The plunger can be pulled out of the syringe and used to stir the heroin
solution. The end of the plunger should be clean before putting it back 
in the syringe. A piece of cotton is rolled into a ball a little bigger
than a tic-tac. It is a good idea to clean one's fingers with an alcohol
swab before rolling the cotton. The cotton is dropped into the heroin and
it puffs up like a sponge. The tip of the syringe is pushed into the 
center of the cotton and the plunger is slowly pulled back until all of
the heroin is sucked in. This cotton is necessary to filter out any 
particles and such in the heroin solution. The area on the body chosen 
for injection is thoroughly cleaned with an alcohol swab. I think the
spot on the bend of the arm is so commonly used because it's so darned
easy to get the needle into the vein properly. The needle is placed 
almost flat on the skin so it doesn't get wiggled around too much. The
needle is inserted so it goes down the length of the vein and not across
it. Going across it just makes it way too easy to accidentally poke
through the other side or pull out. Holding the syringe almost flat 
against the skin after the user feels the needle is deep enough in keeps
the syringe from accidentally being jostled around and the needle being 
pulled out or pushed through the side of the vein.
 Now for the tricky part. The user has to make sure that the needle is
in the vein before injecting. If the heroin is injected when the needle
isn't in the vein the heroin will just form a big heroin blister which
takes hours and hours to get absorbed by the body. Usually it will burn
while it's being injected if it's not going in the vein. This is one way 
to tell if it's not going in the vein. The user should also keep a close
eye to see if a blister is forming. When the needle is inserted the 
plunger is pulled slowly a tiny bit to see if blood comes in. This shows 
that it's in the vein. Sometimes when the plunger is pulled, only a slow
trickle of blood comes in and the rest is air. With practice it's easier
to tell if this trickle indicates a good enough insertion into the vein. 
Injecting a tiny bit of air ( about an eighth-inch ) with the heroin is 
harmless but if the user is nervous about this the syringe could be 
tilted 
so the air floats to the other end. From personal experience a quarter-
inch (about 10 units) of air being injected with heroin is harmless
but there's no need to make a habit of it. With a little practice the 
user can be pretty sure the heroin is going in the vein without first 
checking for blood but still checking for a burning feeling where it's
being injected or a blister forming. 
 When trying heroin for the first time the user, of course, starts out 
with a tiny bit to see how his or her body reacts to it. As with pain 
pills sometimes the stomach gets queasy when the body isn't used to it.
In the case of an overdose the only thing I know to do is to keep to 
person up and walking around to keep the heart going. If medical 
attention is needed I'm pretty sure the paramedics use a drug called 
"narcan" which blocks the effects of opiate narcotics like heroin.
