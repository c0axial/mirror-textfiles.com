    State: Alabama
Date: June '94
Location: Birmingham
Pot: $450 to $500/Quarter-pound; $40-45/Quarter-ounces. Quality: Most of this
    pot is the standard stuff....not light, but not dark green, and usually
    takes about 3 good bong hits to be stoned for a while...
  * Light green fluffy stuff: $170 an ounce, or $50 a quarter ounce.
Acid: When available, $5 a hit, $7 to $10 to the younger people.

Date: June '94
Location: Fairhope
Pot: $400/quarter-pound, sometimes a pound for $1200 or so...
Acid: $5/hit. Easier to get than in Birmingham
Shrooms: "So plentiful that there is no market...everyone goes and gets them
    themselves...you can pick 2 or 3 pounds of them by yourself in an hour or
    so, if you go to one of the better fields..."


    State: Arizona
Location: Dead Concert, Buckeye Lake
Date: June 11, 1993

           Color: Light to middle green

Location: Phoenix
Date: June '94
Weed: $250-300/ 1/4 lb, $750/lb. Dark green with very small buds, none bigger then about
    1 inch in length.  The smoke is mild, with a quick reponse.  High ranges
    from intense with visions to mild and depressed. Appears to be a strain of
    indica and stavia mixed, or perhaps its the fruits of a stavia and indica
    harvest mixed together. Supposedly a import from South America.
  * Mexican Weed: $5.00/gram, $15.00 1/8th oz, $25.00 1/4 oz, $40.00 1/2 oz,
    $75.00 1 oz, $160.00 1/4 LB, $300.00 1/2 LB, $500.00 1 LB, $8000/20 kilo.

Location: Incline Village area (North Lake Tahoe, California/Nevada border)
Date: February '94
Marijuana:
    * Mex (shitweed): $25/eight. It's actually better than what the name says.
    I got really worked on this stuff.
    * Green: $50/eigth. This had some really KIND bud in it- juicy and thick.
    The smell was wonderful, and you can get pretty high after three bong
    hits.  Unfortunetly kind of expensive for me.
LSD: $5 a hit, or about $3 if you buy a lot of it. Quality is unknown.
Mushrooms: $20 for an eight, about enough for 2 people. Quality also unknown.
-Everything else is pretty hard to find.  Actually, shrooms and not pot are the
    most common and easy-to-get drug around here.

Location: Los Angeles area
marijuana: $25 a quarter -- mediocre stuff, but it gets the job done.
hashish: $10 a gram.  No point of comparison, but it's pretty potent.

 [3rd source, December '93]
LSD: Strawberries (kind of old) and Celtic shields: $50/sheet wholesale,
    $60/sheet if 2nd in line, $100/sheet if not. Shields are uneven in
    quality--tends to be either high or weak in quality. A few dud hits per
    sheet as a rule.
 [4th source, March '94]
Weed: Mex: $20/eigth on the street, $60/ounce from most Mexicans
    'Ganje' Killer dope $60/eighth for *fat* eights. Might be $50-55 for
    slightly lesser grade. $320/oz if you can find the right person. "Best
    Weed Santa Barbara has ever seen!" High Times quote)
Hash: not too bad quality, ~30/quarter.
Hits/Shrooms: Very hard to find, but average prices ($3-5 'cid, $20/eight
    shrooms).
Opium: Be real careful here.  There is some shit going around that smells like
    Jasmine.  I think it's that Black Opium insence found in the back of HT.
    It's $20/eighth, but don't waste your money.
*Everything above except for the Kind prices are from around the Venice beach
area.  The 'ganje' I've only been able to find up in Santa Barbara, but it's
well worth the trip.

      is comprised of seeds and stems.  Color is uniform (no orange hairs)
      and there are no crystals. Readily available.

Marijuana: Good red hair commercial mexican- $90/OZ, $900/5 pounds
[3rd source, March '94]
MJ: 750-1000/pound for commercial mex. to get below $900 you need to know an
    importer, preferably a mexican insider.  A friend got a pound for $650, but
    it was moldy and didn't smell too good.  Still stony though.


    State: Delaware
Location: Newark
Date: July 24th '93
"Just about anything is available here, nobody seems to have any trouble
finding weed, hash, LSD, speed, coke or crack. MDMA availability seems to
be highly correlated with certain parties where there is little or no
beer and many weird looking people dancing all night that happen about 
once or twice a month. Shrooms, microdots that are alledgedly mescaline
(but more likely one of its more potent analogues), ketamine, PCP,
heroin and various pharmacuticals are all available but if you don't
know the right people it might take a week or two to find them.
Alcohol: $1.75 domestics, $2.75 imports, $1.75+ mixed drinks. in a bar
Marijuana: $45-55/quarter, decent stuff, good availability
LSD: $4/hit; Recent brands: Snowmen, plain grey blotter; Availability: fair

    State: Indiana
Location: Portage
Marijuana: $45 - 1/4 or $150 an ounce. Mediocre stuff, kinda dry. Hard to come
    by lately. [August '93]
[2nd source, October '93]

    to get. $45 1/4, $120 ounce.
LSD: Very good stuff. $3/dose, $90 half-sheet of 50. Availibility is good.
    Usually takes a day to get.
[3rd source, 20 December '93- Portage and surrounding cities]

    hits, one joint gets even the heaviest smoker stoned. Very easily obtained.
    Delivered right to your door. $40 a 1/4 oz., and $120 an oz.
Note: Slightly less than an ounce is only a misdemeanor in Indiana! They are
searching a lot of vehicles, lately, so if you have an ounce or more, be
careful, it's a stiff felony! Chesterton, Indiana, or neighboring city just
spent a whopping $10,000 for a drug sniffing dog they now carry around to
search vehicles on the spot. First month's statistics are 5 marijuana busts. Be
warned!


    State: Iowa
Location: Des Moines
Date: April '94
Marijuana: 1/8 oz - $25, 1/4 oz - $45-50, 1/2 oz - $85-100, 1 oz - $140-170.
    From the sources I've seen, bags are mostly buds, very little shake. Buds
    are full of red hairs and have a strong, green odor, usually around 2-3
    inches long.  General rule is to get it when shipments first come in, and
    you'll end up with the longer buds with very few seeds, but a few big
    stems.  Very intense high, 1 or two bong hits will send you flying, a
    couple bongloads will knock you on your ass.
LSD: $5-6  Everyone says it takes a couple hits to work
Shrooms: $35 for an 1/8 oz., but I haven't seen 'em.  Pretty rare.
[They really depend on how well you know the source, and availability.
(Everyone seems to run out at the same time around here)]

   would get a 20 bag (for $20) and hope that its large.

Marijuana: $10/gram


    State: Texas
Location: Austin
Date: April '94
Marijuana:
  * Commercial Mexican: $25/quarter. Bricked, *very* dry, seedy. Greener than
    other recent batches, fewer red/orange hairs. Harsh smoke, lots of cough.
    High is somewhat shallow, but has a decent duration.
  * Commercial Mexican: $25/quarter. Same source as above, but much lighter
    green, damper. Better, smoother toke, fewer seeds and stems. Stonier.
  * G9: $90/qtr from the grower, $100+/qtr further down the line. This is
    supposedly a (Northern Lights x Skunk #1) x (a whole slew of hybrids).
    Whatever it is, it's the most potent smoke I've ever encountered in my
    life. Let me repeat that. In my life. It looks like a vivid green and
    red thai stick, with very little of the white crystalization seen on
    some of the other Kind in town. The sticks are approximately 1 inch wide,
    and about 1/2 inch thick. A .25 inch slice from a bud, cut into 4 pieces,
    will absolutely fry a half-dozen people. Frighteningly good.
  * Afghani Hash Plant: $100/quarter. Beautiful buds, a little loose. Leaves
    (when dried) are a lighter green than I'd expected from an Afghani, with
    whitish tints in some places, interspresed with brilliant shoots of deep
    red and orange. Very energetic, spacey high.
  * Green Spirit (Big Bud x Skunk #1): $90/quarter. Intense smell from the
    skunk, the dried bud looks like it's been dipped in a sugar glaze there's
    so much resin dried on it. High is very spacy, long-lasting (4-6 hours from
    1 bowl) and good to groove on. Still around from last time (when I in-
    correctly identified it as Green Vision. I blame the drugs :-).
  * Local Skunk Bud, misidentified last time as Jamaican: $75/quarter. This
    was grown outdoors locally (allegedly 300+ lbs.). Big fat nuggets of 
    smooth green smoke, a bargain at the price, especially considering that
    it is moderately-seeded. Lots of people are starting gardens from this
    stuff. The high is medium duration, but very strong and mellow. If the
    seeded bud is this potent, I can't wait to try some of the Sinse from
    it...
  * Reputable friends have reported seeing unharvested Hindu Kush #3, 
    Northern Lights #2, Thai Skunk (Thai x Skunk #1), (Haze x Skunk #1),
    Skunk #1 and 4-Way (Skunk x NL x NL x Skunk). It sounds like upcoming 
    months will be Kind indeed here at the home of the the Armadillo.

marijuana: "$100/oz or $1050/lb - excellent quality - 2 to 3 toke high"
 [2nd source, September '93]
LSD: 50 hits of Mindblaster (paper)/$2.50 per hit "A little on the weak side

Location: Houston
Date: Early august '93
Marijuana: Indica, Huge light green buds and stink really bad. (Not sinse,
    had fair amount of seeds)- Incredible killer dope.
    US$120 / quarter ounce
[other source, October '93]
Marijuana: Mexican: US$30 a quarter oz. Typical summer mexican buds - mostly
    greenish brown flat gnarly looking buds.  Fortunately it's usually not too
    compressed.  Will definitely get you high if you smoke enough...  Loaded
    with small, smooth, black seeds...  very stemmy.  Always available unless
    it gets REALLY dry (hasn't happened this summer).  Buy the kind instead of
    this if you can...
    - Kind buds:
   Thai:  US$120 a quarter oz. Was available in august. Outdoor grow kind.  No
    seeds.  Big brownish kinda-dry buds with harsh smoke that tastes a bit like
    it has gasoline fumes in it...  Gets you quite stoned with only one good
    hit though.  Overall it's pretty good.
   Colombian gold hash buds:  US$140 a quarter oz.  also available in august.
    From same source as the Thai. No seeds. Big light brown (almost beige) buds
    with traces of green. Gets you VERY stoned in short order.
   Northern Lights:  US$100 a quarter oz.  was available in September. Local
    hydroponic grown...  No seeds.  Nice sticky dark green "fluffy" buds.
    Takes about 5 mins to kick in but gets you nice and high as opposed to
    stoned.  Wears off rather quickly though (in about an hour or hour and a
    half)... :(
   Indica!: US$120 a quarter oz. Available in mid october (about a week ago).
    Probably outdoor grow skunk buds. Huge fluffy, sticky light green buds.
    Very fresh so it's most likely local grow.  Moderate amount of seeds.  Not
    quite as strong smelling or as nice tasting as it has been in the past but
    unbelievable nonetheless.  One good hit gets you REALLY REALLY high.  Two
    gets you very stoned.  Awesome stuff.  You bet I'm saving the seeds.

mexican brick :  usual winter mex.  Small crushed buds, dark green, some red
    hairs evident in the shake, stemmy with lots of seeds. Not bad overall for
    brick, and at $25/quarter-oz I don't complain.
kind bud#1:  very dark green sativa.  large dense buds but not very strong
    smelling.  one or two seeds found.  VERY high THC content - one large bong
    hit I was mortally wounded, which is unusual... $120/quarter-oz
kind bud#2:  exactly the same as #1, from the same source even, but with less
    THC.  Probably just a different plant from the same stock.  Excellent bud
    though.
kind bud#3:  some weird strain of indica.  not as green or strong smelling as
    indica usually is.  light green buds dappled with red. big and very
    lightweight fluffy buds with no seeds and not much stem, so nearly the
    entire bag was smokeable.  lots of big crystals and very tasty... very
    potent and a great deal at $110/quarter-oz
LSD:  a clear liquid in a small vial.  $5 for a couple of drops on a
    sugar-cube.  good stuff

[other source]
Location: Washington, DC
Date: July '93
Marijuana: ~$200/ OZ (most common, actually a little expensive). Price most
often depends on WHO is selling.  High quality stuff gets around (in small
quantities) but is generally cheaper (~ $100-150 / OZ). Not much "killer"
stuff around.  The most common is quite seedy and brown, but the buds are
generally kind.  When quality stuff makes it this far it tends to come from
Oregon/N. California and is seedless, green smelly buds.
The $200/OZ stuff can generally be scored in under a month.  Everything else
fluctuates tremendously as there are no other regular sources. Price has
been steady for over a year now. Most of this, of course, depends on who you
know... On the street you'll be easily ripped off.
