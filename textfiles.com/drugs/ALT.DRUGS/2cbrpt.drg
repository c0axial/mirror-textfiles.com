Ah, the memories this brings back. I was at Reed in 1979, and bromo was 
plentiful and popular at Reed at that time. The descriptions of its
effects that I've read on this board are, I would say, rather accurate.
The effects are different, and more dramatic, than LSD.

At the time, it was usually sold in single dosages in clear gel capsules.
I didn't snort it (I didn't care for the pain), but found the effects to
be most effective when eating it as well. I ate 3 capsules one night
when I was bored, and had the most earth-shattering experience of my 
life. Hallucinations were so intense that I could not recognize people and
could not understand what they were saying. I saw spinning pinwheels made
of knife blades reflecting all the colors of the rainbow on the walls. I
thought I was shivering from cold at one point, and remarked as much to
a friend of mine (this before I was hallucinating so heavily that I couldn't
recognize or uderstand people). He told me I wasn't shivering at all; I
realized he was right, and the sensation that I was shivering suddenly
changed to a sensation that I had powerful electrical energies pulsing
through my body.

I had many more bizarre experiences that night (including a mild panic
when I thought I was moving backward in time), but I don't want to drone
on here. Suffice it to say that the drug is real, and the descriptions
of its effects on this board are not exaggerations.

Their report surprises me somewhat. Definitely atypical, although it
does seem to be the case that people's response to 2C-B varies
markedly. Most people find it to be very good, over a range of
dosage levels.

Here is an anonymous discussion of the effects of 2C-B:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For me, 2C-B seems to be in a different league from all other drugs.
No other experience has come close to that of 2C-B. Superficially,
it seems to lie somewhere between MDMA and psilocybin, i.e. it is
both entactogenic (in a way I find more wholesome and satisfying
than MDMA or MDE) and psychedelic. Unlike psilocybin, it leaves
the ego much more intact - the mind remains clear and comfortable
throughout. Unlike MDMA it is unlikely to cause inappropriate
emotional bonding between people - only to encourage appropriate
bonding.

My first experience with 2C-B was with four doses, each of about
20-25mg of the hydrochloride, spaced by 40 minute intervals. The
experiment was conducted in private with one other person. 
Because of the spaced doses, the onset was gradual and gentle.
I was slowly lifted out of my ordinary life, and taken to a
state of pure heaven. Laurie Andersen once said "Paradise is
like where you are right now, only much much better" and this
about sums it up. Everything around me was somehow transformed
into absolute perfection. There were mild visual distortions
which were tasteful decorations but in no way got in the way.
All sensation became the most pleasurable possible - food,
touch, sound, sight, sex were all simply perfect, but none
of this was at all overwhelming. Throughout I remained totally
calm, rational, and in control, just feeling better than I 
have ever felt before. There was a sense of "this is the best -
I have finally arrived - I am complete and need never look 
further than this." 2CB is heaven, but it is also mundane - 
there are no fireworks, no fake euphoria - the change is
so subtle you could almost forget it is there. We weren't
moved to do anything differently - just to exist in this in
this beautiful state and behave normally.

With one foot in heaven and one foot on earth, just after the
peak, I found myself in a state of introspection. I felt so
indescribably emotionally beautiful that it brought me to
tears. Then, all the cares and worries of recent weeks came 
flooding at me, but not at an unbearable rate. It was as if
the 2C-B were saying "I have given you 2 hours of perfect 
bliss, but you are about to return to your normal life. Here
are some issues which are bothering you, and now is the 
perfect time to do something about them". The self-analysis
was honest and useful - not distorted and certainly not
superficial - and it was compelling and motivating.

The comedown was slow and gentle. There was no sense of loss,
no desire to regain the state immediately (or at all!); on 
the contrary, the subtle return to normality was welcome. 
Every state between heaven and earth felt just right.

If it is impossible to adequately describe any drug induced
state in words, this is doubly true with 2C-B. For me, the
2C-B experience is unparalleled, so I would recommend that
people try it. Some do not seem to enjoy it, some do not seem
to understand it, but many do.

A few final notes: My experiences suggest that there is nothing
that can be added to the 2C-B experience - nothing can make
it better than it is, and so all other drugs should be avoided
contemporaneously. Also, insufflation seems to increase the
potency 2-3 times, as well as somewhat shortening the duration.
The onset is rapid (half to three minutes) and somewhat disorienting, 
and can approach the feel and intensity of smoked DMT, particularly
in a visual sense. The burning pain associated with snorting 2C-B
can detract from the experience initially.

	2cb unfortunately is now scheduled. I had the opportunity to
experience it about a year ago before scheduling and I'll tell you a bit
about it.
	A friend of mine and I weighed out 25mg each and proceeded to
ingest it via insufflation. Needless to say, it was the most painful
annoying long lasting burn I have ever felt. It burned my sinuses and all
the way down the back of my throat as I got the "drips". My face felt like
it was going to fall off. Combine this with virtually instant
disorientation and nausea, you get two guys that are scared shitless. I've
done my share of excessive hallucinogen doses. But this didn't even come
close to comparing to any of them. It felt like we jumped out of a
building and were free falling faster and faster into a psychedelic world
which didn't seem all that great in lieu of the aforementioned symptoms. I
was actually pretty sure we had od'd and contemplated calling 911.
Unfortunately, I couldn't even make it to the phone if I tried. We had a
sober friend watch us and make sure we were physically ok. As the trip
picked up speed and intensity, shit got really strange. On most
hallucinogens, you can make things move if you stare at em for a bit, but
in this world, EVERYTHING is moving and doesn't stop. Which made me start
to feel motion sickness. I saw 4 foot fluroescent spheres float by with
intricate fractal patterns on them. Our 'guide' wasn't all that bright and
was flipping tv channels and stopped on True Stories of The Highway
Patrol. Not a good thing to watch in this state of mind. We then proceeded
to wheel of fortune where I can swear the people were in the middle of the
living room and letters were flying by us. The experience was like going
from sober to 1000mcg in about 5 minutes. It was actually pretty scary
because we both thought we'd finally done it and were gonna die. But we
were too tweaked to express it. About an hour into it, we realized we were
going to live and the nausea and burning had for the most part subsided,
save the fact that my nose and sinuses were swollen for about 2 days.
After about an hour, it gets kind of like an intense LSD trip.. the
coolest thing is there is really no analytical game playing as with LSD
and you can pretty much discuss what's going on with a good deal of
coherence.  The effects dropped off pretty rapidly and by the 4 hour mark
we felt almost totally sober. 
	I've done 2cb via capsule and have never had it affect me that way
at even 2 and 3 times the dose. It's something I'll never do again because
of A. the pain and B. the intensity. It was too much too fast. I might eat
it again though if it ever becomes unscheduled ;). I did notice something
interesting though. At sea level, a 20 mg dose is pretty mellow... kinda
like LSD but feels more like Mescaline. Yet, we also did it at a
campground in the mountains 6000 feet up. It took under 20 minutes to hit
orally while at sea level it was over an hour. Mind you both times this
was done with a full stomach with exactly the same type of food. I thought
it curious that it was so much more intense at altitude than sea level and
know it wasn't just a fluke situational thing.. any ideas?

Have fun.. good luck and be careful. If you're gonna snort it, be prepared
for lots of pain and a 50% chance of hurling. Also, don't do what a guy we
know did and call 911 because he thought he was gonna wig out. He got
transported to the hospital and by the time he got there about an hour had
gone by and it was tolerable. Needless to say, he felt like an idiot.
Moral: No matter where you are, hold tight, about an hour into it.. you'll
mellow way out. 

It's also kinda hard on the body too.. really tweaky. Nice thing about it
is, that when it's over, it's over. No lingering head buzzing and loops
like the end of an LSD trip where you're no longer hallucinating but are
still unable to sleep. This stuff has a really sharp peak and drop off.

Peace.

M.
