im gonna write this to y'all just to tell you newbies what's gonna happen when you put those nice colorfuil little pieces of paper on your tounge for the first time (and you know that you will... sometime).first of all.. your gonna feel kinda shaky.. but that's cool... just chill kinda and that will pass. Ok... now find something really nice to do, like  pet your dog. if you find something that you truly love to do, it may jsut be the best thing that you have ever done in your life.allrighty.. now that you have gotten used to being tripped up, go outside. turn your head left really fast and right reall fast. if this shit is good, you wont really be able to tell what's going on on that side of your head... like there is too much info goin into your head. its a lot of fun. after a while, every time you make a little movment, you will either see a dark green, or a greenish-purple.now... if you are in a place where you dont wanna get caught just DONT TALK.. because if you do, you are busted.. you are gonna say something really stupid... believe me... my friend busted me this way :(this is gonna last for about 6 hours... at least the intense part. and then you will chill and feel groovy for the next 6 hours and then you should probably go to sleep.oh yeah... i forgot to tell you that if you are on a good trip, even if you are tired, you wont WANT to go to sleep because it is so cool to be on this wild trip.whoever told you that it is like the realworld just cooler, was wrong. its a lot like you are in another world and somehow you got into this one and you have to deal with all of the confusing shit of everyday life :)a common thing to say is 'hey... am i really talkinG? can anyone hear this?' yes... everyone in the room can hearr you... dont worrk.love.... zerozero SWITCH IN SWITCH ON SWITCH OFF
