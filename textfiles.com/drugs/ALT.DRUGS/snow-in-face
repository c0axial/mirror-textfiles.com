Hey.. what up?

I just wanted to tell you about a nice little story that happened early 
january this year. Well.. I was sleepin over at my friend's house 
for the night.. and this was the first time he had tripped. well.. a 
week earlier, i bought some acid from a shady-ass gangsta who 
goes to my school, so I wasn't too optimistic about the whole 
thing. well... this is where the story begins:

first.. we drop... and wait.. and wait.. half an hour... then me and 
my friend start throwing the remote control to the tv back and forth 
and *ZING* out pops the battery! hits my friend right on the 
dome! then we laughed for about an hour and that signaled the 
start of the trip. Then, for about half an hour we stared at a wall 
and thought it was movin. at about 2:00am, i had the urge to go 
outside.. so we went outside, right into a field, with trees all over 
it. it was snowing and cold as hell. well.. have you ever seen the 
video "So Whatcha Want" by the beastie boys? well.. it was 
exactly like that. everything was bright and pink and orange 
because of the snow, and all the the trees formed dome over our 
heads... it was some wild shit. well.. then we smoked a bowl of 
pot and lay down in the snow. we were staring up at the orange 
sky (i say that like it is normal to see an orange sky or something 
:) and the snow was falling down and hitting us directly in the 
face... every once in a while you could feel one melt on your 
eyeball, then the water dripped down your face, warping the 
image even more. it was then when i said "that's the most 
beautiful thing ive ever seen" .. and we stayed out there for around 
half an hour doing the same thing. we got cold and went home.

sure the story aint that great. but if you ever got the chance, you 
really got to do the same thing.

oh yeah -00- i guess the acid wasnt that bad after all.. cause i 
havent gotten anything half as good since then!
