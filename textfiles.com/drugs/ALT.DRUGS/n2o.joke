Dave Barry Calendar, 3/30/93

You know how, during the Preflight Safety Demonstration, flight attendants
tell you that in the event of an emergency, oxygen masks will pop out of the
ceiling?  My question is:  _Who_wants_oxygen_?  If I'm going to be in an
emergency seven miles up, I want _nitrous_oxide_, followed immediately by
Emergency Intravenous Beverage Cart Service, so that I and my fellow
passengers can be as relaxed as possible.  ("Wow!  Those are some beautiful
engine flames!")

have fun
