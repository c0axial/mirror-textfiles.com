I'd like to relate one of my most powerful trips to date to you people out there. Last weekend, two mates and I picked up some acid that was called 'Jesus Christ'. The sheet had a huge, detailed picture of Jesus on the cross on it, and the detail of the drawing was incredible. I dropped a half at about 2 o'clock in the arvo, and about an hour later I was frying beyond belief. This stuff was _strong_.   I sat down in a comfortable chair on my mate's porch, and simply stared over the neighbourhood. I simply could not believe how powerful this trip was. It was like someone was injecting me with power beyond my wildest dreams. I looked at my hands and saw a huge display of constantly changing heiroglyphics which seemed Aztec or Incan in origin. I remember thinking 'I could have the answer to those lost civilizations here in my hand.'   I spent 4 hours sitting on that porch not talking to my mates, (who were too fried to notice.) just journeying out to places I had never even known existed. Eventually the sun went down, and the trip subsided a little, so I went back inside, and we smoked some primo buds to complement the trip nicely. After that, the trip seemed a little more casual, but that peak is definately something I'll definately remember forever, as it took on hugely mystical qualities. I hope to get a few more of these type of trips, as I have a lot of uncharted territory to explore in the realm of my mind... -- rec.drugs.psychedelic
