I tried acid for the first time last night, Thanksgiving.  A friend (B) and I each bought two hits in the form of sugar cubes from a friend of his.  We ate them both on the spot.  B's friend asked if we had any bud, which was not case, so she sold us some, saying that we would be needing it.  We then returned to B's place.    On the way, we spent the whole time speculating whether or not we were feeling any effects yet.  By the time we got home, I decided that I was definitely feeling something: a vague sense of dreaminess and unreality.  When we got there, we immediately smoked a bowl or two.  Then things started to get strange.  We both noticed that we were feeling very energetic; we felt up for anything.  We decided to smoke another bowl.  I know that I successfully packed it, because each of us got one hit.  But the next thing I knew was that I was holding the bowl in my hands, as if to pack it, but it was empty, and all the bud was gone.  I was very confused but decided not to worry about it.  I stared at B, and watched as his face changed into someone else's.  I then noticed some visual effects-everything seemed to wave, like seaweed under water.  Wow!  B started immitating motorcycle noises and laughing hysterically.  He got up and left the room and I followed him.  We went into the bathroom, where we looked at ourselves in the mirror for a while (try this, it's very strange) and B made some more motorcycle noises.  I left the bath room and encountered a non-tripping friend in the hallway.  I started to talk with him, but soon realized I was unable to talk.  I apologized to him (or something) and went back to B's room, where B was listening to a tape of some computer class lecture.  We both had fun trying to understand it.  He then started taping our conversation (unbeknownst to me).  I said some hilarious shit (some of it very embarassing), such as, "Do you feel really low to the ground?".  We listened to some music-incredible!  The music seemed to pass through my body, I could feel it, in warm waves of energy.  Then B started saying a lot of nonsense very loudly and laughing.  He got up and left the room, and I followed him, but couldnt find him.  Paranoia struck hard-I was convinced that B was flipping out or something.  I was very nervous just standing in the hallway, so I decided to return to the room and wait for him.  Then some chick, who I had never met before, walked into the room and asked where B was.  This was the bad part of my trip.  I thought that she was a paramedic or something, that B had run out in public acting insane and had been busted.  At one point I imagined that she was questioning me and writing notes on a clipboard.  Finally, after centuries of paranoid delusions about this chick, she started to get really nervous because i was behaving pretty damn strangely.  She left, looking for B.  She found him and they returned.  But I was pretty uncomfortable around her, so I decided to lie in B's bed and focus on the music.  I thought a great deal, and it seemed that whatever it was I thought about, I understood it completely, at every possible level.  After about 3 hrs (which seemed like minutes), I noticed that B and the chick were no longer in the room.  I figured that my trip would be over pretty soon anyway, so i decided to walk home.  A great journey!  Buildings seemed bent, and sometimes they seemed to take on personalities, to express sentiments.  The cold wind made my eyes water, and through my blurred vision,  all the lights (there were Christmas lights everywhere) looked like distant colored stars.  I could see spectra and tracers.  It was wild.  Finally I got home, and B called me up.  He was freaking out because he couldn't find me and didn't know what to do about it.  He panicked and called various drug counselling numbers and talked to them for a while (don't ask me why).  I've got a hilarious message from him on my answering machine, which he had left while I was still walking home.  We had a good laugh over it.  We decided to meet at Burger King, which we did, and just talked about our experiences until the trip faded, and we finally crashed.
