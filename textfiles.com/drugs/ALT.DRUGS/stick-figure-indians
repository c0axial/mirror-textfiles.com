I took a large eight of mushrooms this summer by myself when my mom left 
town for a while. This was my first trip ever. I started to feel something about
30 minutes into it, and  I felt like smoking some herb, so I did. Suddenly, a
bunch of orange and greyish lines started spinning around me, and the music I
was listening to became very meaningful and reminded me of myself. I looked
out the window and the clouds were spectacularly alive, so I went outside and
lied down looking up at the clouds. I saw these stick-figure Indians with
spears dancing around in the clouds, and it was like they were putting on a
show just for me. In another cloud, I saw a giant flying saucer just floating
there. After that I started to come down. The visuals only lasted about an
hour, but it was the coolest drug experience I've ever had.
