My mouth went dry, I started yawning, I sat back and tried to relax, but Ifound myself trapped in a strange place where the music was flowingthrough my body. Big multi-colored beams of energy were coursing throughme in perfect rhythm. Somebody, somewhere, was crying and I felt thedepths of hell sucking me down, down, down. The walls melted and werereplaced with a giant grotesque face that looked very familiar, but Icouldn't recognize who it was. I stumbled outside just in time to see abird fly by with about a thousand identical birds following right behindone after the other. A friend, who was just as stoned as I, but could holdhis mud better, took me down to a dock, and along with a couple of thelocal ladies we went for a boat ride out on the lake. We slowly motored alongslowly as the stars danced in perfect little individual patters. I put myhand in the water but it came out dry, and as I laughed with the wonder ofit all, my lady friend stripped me naked and rubbed me all over with asoft animal fur. I had never in my life felt anything as sensual and sexwith the beautiful, willing stranger seemed natural and appropriate, but Ijust couldn't do it. All of a sudden everything turned very funny and forhours we laughed and joked and actually became very good friends. Ourfriends in the front of the boat were not having the problems that we wereexperiencing, and the noises of animal lust that floated back to us onlyprovoked more laughter. It was an excellent night, we watched the sun riseover the mountains and then climbed into bed and held each other so closeit felt like we were one person. We made love when we woke-up, andsometime in the late afternoon we decided we were in love.  Well, there it is, my first trip. I hope your experience was as interesting and fun. Do you have the nerve to tell me about your first time? L.C. -- rec.drugs.psychedelic
