hahhahaha
one time on the way to a dead show in maryland, i got pulled over for
no reason, and the cops said that my boyfriend looked suspicious and asked
us to step out of the truck. we did, and he proceeded to separate and question
us. we were from out of state, if that means anything. he wanted to search
my truck, and as i knew i didn't have anything, i didn't really care, but
i wasn't so sure about my boyfriend. i told him not to bring anything in my
truck, but he is a little weasel and not to be trusted. the cops said they 
would hold us there all day if they wanted, and asked me to sign a permission 
slip to search my truck. i said i didn't give my permission, but they could 
search my truck because they were going to anyway, but i refused to
sign their paper. they searched, tearing up our bags and stuff, 
and didn't find anything. but after they let us go, my boyfriend 
told me he hid some sheets inside his sneaker under the liner.
the cop had stuck his hand in the stinky shoe, but i guess
he didn't suspect anything. there was also a piece of shit electric 
guitar that had been stuffed full of shit under some plate that was 
screwed on the back. we were lucky.i was lucky, because that
is one of the states where they will confiscate your vehicle
for such "offenses" and i owed a bunch of money on it. well, 
fuck them. here's one for us!
