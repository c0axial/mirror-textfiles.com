The Rose. Experience with Lsd.

   About 6 months ago me and my girlfriend  were Runaways. We lost about 15 -
25 pounds each so are body wait was extremely low and we were very weak. When
we finally had to return home. Me and my Girlfriend Dropped 2 hits of this
Acid called "The Rose" each. We were staying with friends who had Pink
Floyd's movie "The Wall".  Me nor My Girlfriend had ever seen the movie
before. My friends (who where not Tripping) left to goto a party leaving us
alone. We had not tripped in about 3 months. But after about 30 minutes i
Experienced Nothing i have experienced before with Lsd. Everything in the
room was changing colors. The Ceiling had screaming faces swirling about. But
the strangest Part of the Trip was the feeling inside my head. It was as if
my entire Thinking process was wiped out. I could barely remember my name,
nothing made sense to me, it was as if my thoughts were intoxicated (with
Lsd). My hearing seemed to be as distorted as my sight. All the sounds i
heard were not Distinct sounds but a blur of multiple sounds colliding with
one another. After the movie (which i would recomend to anyone) We went for a
very interesting walk around the neighborhood we began to come down, and
after 6 hours it was over. I have probably tripped over 30 times now and i
have to say that was my best experience in Lsd and i hope to find it again
someday.
