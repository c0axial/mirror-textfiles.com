 Long ago and far away...

 At approximately noon I injested roughly 5 hits of acid of indeterminate
 quality and origin. I was used to that sort of dose, in fact I was used to
 far more, although I had had none of this particular batch. After around
 45 minutes, I began to feel it. Arriving at a friends house around 1:30 I
 was offered a hit of mescaline,, I accepted it without a thought.

 For the next few hours, everything was fine if a bit intense, but it was
 nothing I could not handle. Around 4:00 one of the people I was with, who
 had taken about the same dosage and combination started showing signs of
 being unstable and went for a drive with a non-tripping friend. At this
 point the seeds of paranoia began to sprout, if he was having problems-I
 could too. Maybe the acid or mescaline was "BAD"...

 About 5:00 the phone rings, it is the non-tripping friend. The other
 fellow has collapsed, and paramedics are attempting to revive him. It
 comes over the phone that he is dead. At this point my already tenuous
 grip on reality shatters. I know that I to will die. My mind is strangely
 calm and resigned, but my body went berserk. I can renenber vividly what I
 thought, but only know what I did from the comments of others present.
 Among the acts I attempted or committed were: Urinating on someones foot.
 Attempting to dive into an empty swimming pool (I saw it as full), calling
 my girlfriend's parents and hysterically telling them that all of the
 women in the world were going to die from toxic chemicals in the water
 (Dan Rather told me this on the TV) and bursting into a stranger's
 apartment completely nude (somehow, my friends convinced them that I was
 drunk.

 After being corraled back to the apartment, I apparently beat my head
 against the wall and promptly passed out. What happened next was an
 experience the fundamentally changed my perception of reality.

 I found myself on top of the apartment building I was in. I *Knew* that I
 was not in my physical body. Inexplicably I dove off - headfirst into the
 concrete parking lot below. Upon hitting the concrete a symbol flashed in
 my consciousness, it looked much like an inverted Mercedes Benz logo made
 of bone. I found myself
 in a place that is very difficult to describe, it was decidedly physical,
 yet I had no body. It was as if I was crushed between two giant planes.
 Completely liquified,pulped, a bloody mush, yet still in possession of a
 sense of touch. It hurt. I heard a deafening, piercing siren. I tasted a
 bitter, metallic, blodlike taste.

 I can't say how long this lasted, but I was unconscious for over an hour.

 When I came to, I had a terrible headache, but I was back. Incidently, my
 friend was revived. He was technically dead for a while, but came back.
 Unfortunately he doesn't remember a thing.

 In retrospect, I see the allegory in some of my extreme behavior
 (especially the girlfriend part). And I've come to understand the grinding
 planes as the opposing forces of the acid and mescaline on my fragile
 psyche. I just wanted to share this and see if anyone had had any similar
 experiences.
