My first time was fun, but somewhat uneventful.  My girlfriend's firsttime was more interesting.  She dropped two hits, figured out themeaning of life, and decided that she had to escape her physical body. She proceeded to dive through a glass coffee table.  After that nightshe had been afraid of tripping again until I finally got her to do iton the beach the other night.  Her second time was much better. -- rec.drugs.psychedelic
