I did 3 hits of white blotter on friday.  Saw great colors and bonded 
with Pink Floyd, damn that axe is scary, so I decided to do my last 4 
hits on saturday.  My parents were up visiting me at school and took me 
out for pizza.  I dropped right in front of them, and ordered an orange 
juice and one to go.  They didn't even notice, I just sliped them in my 
mouth.  I didn't get trails that night, I got "jumps."  Nothing moved, it 
just jumped from one spot to another.  Then I cried for hours an was sure 
that I was insane.  All I could think was that my parents are the only 
people who will love me no matter what I do, and they will eventually 
die.  Then who's going to love me?  No matter how I tried to avoid that 
thought, everything circled back to it.  It was horrible.  My advice, 
spread your trips out.  I almost turned into psycho girl from hell.
