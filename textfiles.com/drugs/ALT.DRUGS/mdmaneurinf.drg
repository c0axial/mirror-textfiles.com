>Ricaurte (personal communication,1992) and associates at Johns Hopkins
>University recently completed the data analysis portion of a  primate study

> Strassman (personal communication,1992) recently completed an FDA-approved
>human study  in which the physiological and psychological responses of ele

>measures included x-endorphin, ACTH, prolactin, corticol,  growth hormone, 
>baseline and maximum rise temperature and pupil diameter responses. 
>Psychological measures included the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the

>corticol,  growth hormone,  baseline and maximum rise temperature responses,
>across all four doses of DMT and placebo. The standard analytic tool was
>ANOVA with repeated measures.  The only significant difference between the "
>MDMA Positive" and "MDMA Negative" groups was that the maximum change in

>negatives, across all doses of drug/placebo.
