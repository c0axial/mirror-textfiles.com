Subject: LSD

Only my second time.  It started out awesome, then it became 
scary.  I was with my bestfriends and one of them looked really 
weird to me.  Her tongue was like a snakes and her head started 
to spin around.  I freaked!!!  I had to go into another room 
with other people trippin.  ever scince my friends head spun 
around it was really scary.  Another friend turned into the 
devil and i looked in the mirror and turned into a demond.  
My heart started to beat really fast and i thought i was goin 
to die.  I finally got over my fear of my bestfriend and went 
into the room with them again.  They were watching Wizard of OZ 
 and everything was just unreal.  I'm so happy i servived.  I 
wanted the trip to end really bad when i saw the devil.  I kept 
thinking I was going to die.  I had to have my bestfriends 
brother keep on telling me i was going to be fine and when i 
woke up everyone will be okay.  I'll probably end up doing it 
again but i hope it's alot better.  all in all i like trippin 
but i hate the devil!!!!!  The first time was so much better!!!


I hope your experiences were better then mine!!

lova ya and keep on parting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
