Supposing one were to decide to grow shrooms, and wanted to know
which would be the best kinds for growing, both in jars, and 
naturally in one's own area.. here's the general ideas about 
a few of the different types that I have come up with from my
knowledge; it would be really nice if people could add on to 
this list:

p. baeocystis -- the "potent" psilocybe, grows in the pacific
northwest.. I'd guess that this would be really good to get but
I'm not sure how easy it would be to grow.  I also read that 
besides being si
slightly hallucinogenic, it *might* be poisonnous -- but the
author was unsure.  Perhaps, though, the amount of poisonous
chemicals would have no effect because it is so potent in 
psilocybin/psilocin that you'd need to take more than enough 
to get a strong trip before you ingested enough poison.. that's
just a guess, though -- I really know very little about this 
kind and I'd like to see what others know.

p. coprophelia -- supposedly very week as far as the psilocybes
go, but a source I read said that it was the species that was
the most widespread in North America.  I'd assume it would be
easy to grow.

p. cubensis -- grows in many places, and its seasons are all
year round.  Perhaps it is these growing conditions that makes
it the most common, and sold in mushroom kits more often than
any other type (actually, the only one I know about coming
from kits)

they also grow relatively large.

p. semilanceata -- "Liberty caps"  I read a file from ftp.hmc.edu
where one person's friend said that they were, out of all the
types he had tried, his favorite variety.  He also said that 
most people who tried this variety tended to have visuals of
mushrooms..... hmm.. is this just some weird coincedince?

p. montana -- this seems to grow better in less humid, cooler
climates, in comparison to the others.  But it also looked like
it was common across the U.S. in a field guide that I read.
"Chiefly sandy soils in woods, heaths" -- anyone know about
the potency?

Do not assume that I grow or would grow mushrooms because I 
don't take big risks -- but I just thought that people would
be interested in what I know, and I certainly would be 
interested in more info on this because I have friends who 
are interested in growing shrooms, although they haven't grown
any yet.  I think there are a lot of people out there who
would probably be interested in what kinds would be wild in
their area, how to get them and grow them, how potent different
varieties are, and how to identify the variety that they just
bought so they kno dosages (hmm.. that's difficult because it's
probably hard to identify dried shrooms) ...

If only shrooms were legal we wouldn't have to worry about 
ingesting unkown quantities, picking poisonous shrooms, and
getting caught...  :(
