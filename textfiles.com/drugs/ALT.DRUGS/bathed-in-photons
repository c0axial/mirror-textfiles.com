well now.. It was about March... after Mardi Gras.  I had gone home with a friend from boarding school for the weekend and we were looking for something to do.  My friends friend hooked us up for about $6 and in the parking lot at shwegman's, we ate the 1cmx1cm piece of paper.  I noticed that there was part of a design on it and was just one piece of an obviously bigger medium. After an hour, I got dry mouthed and we went to another supermarket..  after purchasing some drinks, I got one of those little rubber balls that bounces real high.  I noticed some cool tracers comming off of it, which I still see, not just from that one time though..We then went to a party and we were starting to think it was real weak acid.  So we smoked a bowl... Then it hit me.. Like electricity being sucked from a plug... The world was buzzing.. I could actually feel the streetlight upon my skin.  BTW, it was night... I didn't want to go inside of the party so I stayed outside and layed on the hood of some guys car.  Bathed in photons from the light, I looked down the street to find a ballet taking place.  Of course though, it was just an oak tree, lit from underneath.  IT was spinning, not fast though, and the vines that were wrapped around it made it look like a big bear made out of leaves.  Then it had a girl in a tutu sitting on it's shoulders.. Then a car pulled up.. I got real paranoid(thinking of cops) but let it slide.. Lokking at the tree once more, it was now a big balloon shaped like a bear, like the kind you'd see at the Macy's Day Parade or the Rose Bowl..Soon after, we went to my friends sisters house.. Her cat was amazing.. shifting patterns of color like waves on a beach.  when it turned its head, its ears would go down into its head, and then come back up.  The ceiling was amazing.. intricate patters like mayan heiroglyphs... totally cool*8* --  rec.drugs.psychedelic
