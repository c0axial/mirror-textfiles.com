Whippits are extremely easy to use.  

First you need to find a source.  In Phoenix, head shops and adult bookstores 
sell them.  They are little canisters that look like CO2 cartridges, except 
that they contain NO2.  A box of ten whippits or "Chargers" shouldn't cost you 
more than $10.00 or you're getting ripped.  I pay $7.50 for a box of ten.  

Once you get the whippits, you need a cracker.  There are a few varieties: 
plastic, metal, and fancy.  Plastic are by far the cheapest but because the 
nitrous oxide coming out of the canister is extremely cold, they have a 
tendency to break.  I've used a plastic cracker for about 30-40 whippits 
before it broke.  Metal crackers are more expensive but will last you a 
lifetime.  Then there are fancy ones with designs, and even large 
glass/plastic bottles that hold 5 charger's worth of nitrous.  

The cracker is in two pieces with threads.  You put the charger in the cracker 
and start twisting the cracker (like a nut on a bolt).  At one end of the 
cracker, there is a metal point that pierces the metal on the charger.  There 
are also holes on this end.  So, you put your charger in, twist the cracker 
until it's tight, and get your balloon ready.  When the cracker is tightened 
all the way, no gas should escape (or very little).  This way, you can fill up 
 a balloon as much as you want, then stop the gas flow by tightening the 
cracker again.

It's easier done than said.  

The box of chargers says:

        Chargers are specially made for making whipped cream in ISI-Cream 
        Whippers.  Do not use for any other purpose.  Misuse may be physically
        harmful and dangerous to your health.  

        10 Cream Chargers.  One Charger will whip: up to 1/2 lt. (1 pint) of
        liquid whipping cream.  Colour silver.  Material recyclable.  Contains
        10 cm^3 (0.61 cu. in) pure N2O under pressure.  Weight: net c. 8g 
        (0.28 oz.)  NSO, gross c. 28g (1 oz.).  Keep cool and dry, (temp. not
        to exceed 50 degrees C/122 degrees F).  Keep out of sun and heat. 
        Never dispose of full chargers.  Keep out of reach of children.  Use 
        cream whipper and chargers only in accordance with instructions.  Do
        not inhale!  Dispose of box in empty condition only. 



Have fun..  remember to breath once in a while.
