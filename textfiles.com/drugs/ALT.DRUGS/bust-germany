I have a bit of trouble in Germany to keep my drivers
 licence.This is because of a story, happend 2!! years
ago. The police suspected me that I `m dealing with drugs
(bullshit), the special forces stopped my car, they couldn `t
find anything, I was doing a piss test (they found THC )
NOW ( 2 years later ) they asked for a second test ( I had the 
driving licence the whole time, nothing happened), and now I was
panicing, because I did not had a clue, how long it is staying
in the blood.
Thanks to your information, I feel much more secure now !!!!!

Making a piss test, if police have the idea you are stoned,
slowly getting a sort of fashion in here, as well as regular
checks afterwards, if the connect you somehow to drugs (that you
can keep your licence)
