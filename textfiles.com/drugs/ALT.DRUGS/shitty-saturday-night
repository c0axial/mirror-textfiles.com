This looks like fun... not that I get to do this anymore :(LSD was the first thing I ever tried aside from alcohol.  I hadn't smoked anypot, or for that matter, any tobacco before this...My first time was about a week after I broke up with my girlfriend.  We brokeup, actually, after an argument over drugs, but that's a long and dull story.I'm gonna tell the story the long and (hopefully) interesting way... if you get bored, that's what the N key is for...A friend and I had only one tab between us.  It was tiny, and actually kindainoccuous looking.  "There a certain part of this that has the good stuff on it?"My friend turned it over.  There was a brown spot on the other side, andsomething about the brown spot just screamed out DRUGS!!!!  "This brown spotis where the magic is."  He'd tripped once, the week before, and comparedto me this was the voice of experience.  He cut it in half, taking great painsto make sure that we each got the same amount of that brown cherry on top ofthe paper.  (btw, I now know that it didn't matter)."What do you do with this?" I said  "Do you lick it?""Swallow.  And wait about an hour."An hour later, absolutely nothing interesting had happened.  We concluded thatwe'd been ripped off, so we walked to the grocery store.  When we got to the grocery store, I noticed that I could see everything inmy visual field without rolling my eyes.  I could read the print on a box of cereal out of the corner of my eye without turning to look at it.  SomebodyI knew slightly waved at me from the other end of the aisle, and something about it seemed so mellow and dreamlike.  I thought of the fireman waving atthe beginning of Blue Velvet, it was sorta like that.  All we bought was a box of Rice Krispie Treats cereal.We visited some friends and ate the cereal.  It was like a feast, y'know?We turned off the lights and listened to the Grateful Dead tribute album, which was new that year.  The light shining in from the window kept fading,and in the growing darkness one of my non-tripping friends said, "You know,you guys are having a really cool Saturday night and we're having a shittySaturday night. And the Hell of it is we're all doing the same thing..."  I thought that was profoundly funny.  My other non-tripping friend said, "You know you're tripping when you can't get it up."  I learned later on thatthis is also not necessarily true, but I was never able to get it up on acidafter that.  I've fallen in love, and I've seen some of the most erotic imagery, but no matter what I never could get hard while baked.That's pretty much it... I felt really, umm, close, I guess to other points inmy life a lot of the time.  At one point I felt like I'd been in junior high only yesterday and I'd be a ninety-something too frail to fart tomorrow.  And I spent a lot of time looking in the mirror. My face changed into theforms of all the other bearded men I know of, like Abraham Lincoln, Jesus, andJim Morrison.  I fell asleep on the couch at some point.  I woke up the next morning feeling great, but I realized after breakfast in the dorm that I'd forgotten to zip my fly.  -- rec.drugs.psychedelic
