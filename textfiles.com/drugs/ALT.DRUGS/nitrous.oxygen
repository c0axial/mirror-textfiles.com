There's no problem with inhaling up to about a 79%-21% N2O-oxygen mixture, as
air is only 21% O2 anyhow.  Mixtures like that are what you get at the dentist's
office, and as mentioned above ("anaesthesia machine..."), this is no problem.
It's obviously worse to blow out all the oxygen in your lungs and replace it
with N2O, but really, folks, in the worst case, you hold in the N2O (possibly taking
another hit immediately after exhaling the first and breathing a few times) until
you pass out, and then your body takes over the breathing for you.  This will
definitely cause irreversible brain damage (printed in scary BIG LETTERS above),
but not very much, I imagine.  Same story with taking a drink or two, or with
holding your breath too long, for that matter.  Now, if you're dumb enough to start
right in again on the N2O upon awakening, you're asking for more trouble...
