alt.drugs FAQ : "How do I prepare marijuana or hash to be consumed with my
                 THC absorbing gastrointestinal system?"
 
Well, this is the very Beta version of the FAQ for eating marijuana (I mean
way* beta, i.e. version 0.005b).  Any additions are welcome:  send them to
mtymp15@staff.tc.umn.edu.  My initial request for information yielded a few
decent replys, and I thank you guys for putting up with my badgering for more
details.
 
Most recipes call for the manufacture of a certain quantity of "Bud Butter,"
which is then used as butter would normally be used in a cooking situation.
THC is not a water-soluble compound, so butter would naturally be a good
carrier substance for injestion.  One version of a recipe for this kind of
butter is included, the recipes are not.  Use your imagination and you will
find better food to make than the recipes I got.  I have* included a couple
interesting recipes that sound very* good regardless, and any information you
have about experiencing a trip on these recipes would also be fun to throw into
the FAQ.
 
OK... enough of my blabber... here is the (small) collection.  My comments are
in [brackets].

Making "Bud Butter" ****
 
Melt a pound of butter in a pan.  Mix 60-70 (or more grams of thoroughly sifted
pot in it.  Let it boil carefully a couple of minutes until the butter has
gotten a green color from the grass.  Then squeeze the butter through a fine
strainer.  While you use the strain, keep the leaves away in a corner of the
pan by using a spoon.  Squeeze hard to get out as much of the butter as possible
...
[The cooking time has varied from "a couple of minutes," as above, to 10-15
minutes from other baked epicurian masters.  10 minutes works fine for my
"friends."]
 
To warm up the pan a little will make the butter flow easier.  Also strain the
butter that is gathered in the deeper parts of the pan.  If you don't want any
remaining leaves in the butter, you can strain it through some muslin.  A
problem concerning this is that you will loose some butter in the muslin.  Don't
throw the leaves, they still may* contain viable THC.  The leaves can be cooked
in milk or vodka and become a tasty and effective drink.  Hot milk or vodka
might also be poured through the muslin, thereby saving some of the hashish
butter.  You can fry more leaves in the same butter in you want to increase its
strength.
...
 
[General "word on the street" is that the bud left over after the extraction is
worthless and should be thrown away... I left the comment in the recipe because
boiling the used pot in milk really* does taste good.  I have not experienced
consuming the beverage at what might be called a "baseline," so I do not know
if it has psychoactive qualities.  Film at 11.]
 
A simpler and stronger version of the cannabis butter (or ghee)... by mixing
melted butter with hashish or hashish oil instead of pot.  It is not necessary
to fry this as long as in the case with the pot.  Just warm it up and mix it
until the hashish or hashish oil is dissolved in the butter.  You can put as
much hashish (or hashish oil) into it as you want.  Another plus is that there
are no remaining leaves with THC to worry about.
 
[Ahh... to have pounds and pounds of hash lying around just waiting to be used
to cook a nice breakfast.  Not.]
 
Making Tea ****
 
A FOAF is a cook whose closer friends (certainly not me) enjoy such
intoxicating pleasantries. From what I've heard, the cannabinoids
won't dissolve in water at any temperature. Browsing through my FOAF's
cookbook, Adam Gottlieb's _The Art & Science of Cooking With Cannabis_
(20th Century Alchemist, 1974), one might come across
 
"HOT BUTTERED BHANG
 
"In a saucepan, melt half a cube (1/8 pound) of butter or ghee. Crumble
a good handful of marijuana tops or leaves (1/3 - 1/2 ounce [!$WoW$!]).
Stir the grass into the molten butter. Continue stirring over medium
heat for one minute. While it is hot or sizzling, add 8 ounces of
vodka. Be cautious that the hot butter does not make the mixture
spatter. It is best to pour in the vodka swiftly. Continue to boil for
30 seconds or more, stirring all the while. A pinch or two of powdered
cardamom seed may be added during the boiling. . . .
 
"After boiling as much as desired, strain the liquids. Press the mash
in a strainer with the back of a spoon to remove all the juices.
Discard mash or boil it again in fresh vodka to salvage more
materials. Sweeten to taste with honey if wanted. Pour the liquid into
4-ounce wine glasses. . . . Serves two. [!!]
 
"This recipe is not only an efficient method of extracting the active
principles from marijuana, and an excellent medium for assimilation
(alcohol, butter and honey), but it also has a delicious and
satisfying flavor. It is reminiscent of hot chocolate, but is much
more pleasant to drink. It is one of the most swiftly absorbed
cannabis concoctions. The effects of the grass may be felt in less
than fifteen minutes. Cheers!"
 
[Another fine application for ghee.  Clears the sinuses and mental pores.]
 
Chocolate Buds ****
 
Last week I celebrated my promotion (like getting tenure at U of
Chicago).  After giving every one a "Hemp Saftey Course" including the
video of "Hemp for Victory" I brought out a batch of brownies.  The "pro's"
in the group said they tasted like "liquid hash".  Most people said they
felt good till 4pm the next day.  So I thought I'd share the recipe with
the net:
        Start with Hershey's Premium Baking Bar Unsweetened Chocolate.
On the back is a recipe for brownies which includes 1 cup butter, 4 squares
of chocolate, 2 cups sugar, 4 eggs, 1 cup of flour, and vanilla extract.
Start with dry hemp leaves and grind them in a coffee grinder to a fine
powder.  Put in a measuring cup until ~75 ml of "green flour" is made.
Fill to the 1 cup mark (250 ml) with regular flour.  Proceed with recipe
on box: Heat oven to 350 F, Grease 13x9x2 (inch) pan.  Heat butter and
chocolate and stir with wooden spoon until smooth.  Stir in sugar.  Add
eggs one at a time.  Add vanilla extract and stir in flour mixture.
Add nuts if desired (a very nice touch I think) and bake for 40 minutes.
It seemed to take 10 minutes longer than the box suggested (30 minutes)
to be completely baked through.  Makes 3 dozen brownies.  Take 2 and wait
an hour.  Take 4 and cruise for 12 hours.  Enjoy!
                    [^^^^^^]

Stir-fry Bud ****
 
1 Red Pepper
1 Green Pepper
1 Yellow Pepper
1/2 small onion
butter
herbal seasoning of your choice
 
%  Slice the peppers lengthwise into strips about 1/2-3/4 inch wide.
%  Chop the onion.
%  Throw everything together in a skillet with the butter and sautee.
%  Serve over rice.
%  Wait an hour.
%  ENJOY!
 
tips:  It's best to use real butter because herbal seasonings are fat
soluble.  You want the butter to carry the goodies.  Use of a
vegetable-oil-based margarine won't work as well.  If you're cooking
this with friends, take turns standing over the skillet stirring the
veggies and seasonings.  You don't want one person to have *all* the
fun, as the vapors can be quite intense.

Gaspo's "Zauber Cuchlis" (magic brownies). ****
 
 
Ok, I normally use hash (thats the most available), but you could just
substitue grass by grinding it up reall fine (use a pepper grinder, and
you can get rid of those stems too, but they have a harder taste).
 
Rules:  warn your guests too wait one hour after the first brownie until
        they have a second one.  The buzz from eating is different than
        smoking it, and even the heaviest smokers may have a hard time
        recognizing the effects at first.
        I would appreciate hearing what other mutations this
        recipe takes.  Since this was originally distributed
        on usenet, just email me what you mucked with
 
Ingredients:
 
200g    butter (margerine wont work)
200g    unsweetened shokolade
250g    sugar
4       eggs
200g    flour
splash  vanilla extract
100g    dark shokolade (regular candy type)
 
Directions:
 
1)      over low heat, melt butter in saucepan.
2)      once butter is just slightly bubbling, mix in ground up hash
        and stir for 5-10 minutes, taking the pan off the heat every
        now and then to keep the butter from steaming too much (the
        magic actually steams out too i think.
3)      melt unsweetened shokolade (reform type) into butter, stirring
        constantly.
4)      when all shokolade is melted totally, splash a few drops of
        vanilla in.  If you can hear the vanilla sink to the bottom
        and "sizzle", the the mix is hot enough.  so, remove from heat.
        if it doesn't sizzle, then your low setting is low enough.
        I usally just turn off the heat, but leave the pan on
        the burner (ceramic stove).
5)      stir in the sugar little by little (so it dont clump)
6)      once all the sugar is mixed in, beat the eggs and mix them in.
7)      add the flour (stir in first so it dont blow all around), and
        use an electric mixer on LOW (its a waste to splash magic all
        over the kitchen.) untill the whole bit is smooth and no lumps
        or pockets of flour.
8)      break dark shokolade into nickel size chunks, and stir in.
9)      pour mix into shallow pan (2-3cm), and pop in medium heat
        oven for about 30-40min.  NOTE: I never time the puppies, I
        just look at 'em and know.  A toothpick will come out with
        just a little brown color when they are done.
 
NOTES:
 
        The longer you cook the hash and butter together, the sooner the
effects seem to come on.  Don't let the butter bubble too much, or you
can taste the hash in the end-product.
        Vary the sugar according to the "bitterness" off the hash.  I
can't really explain that, but if you eat raw hash too, you'll know what
I mean.
        Vary the flour to get chewy/fluffy brownies.
        about 1dl of buttermilk is pretty good too added just before the
sugar, add extra five minutes before adding the eggs.
        when you put the dark shokolade in, this is the time to add
other things like chopped walnuts, M&M's, pecans, and so on.  I like
this white shokolade with prailenes added (also looks cool with white
swirls in the end product).  I'm going to try caramel one of these days
too.
        Hash oil will work too, although it if you can smell any
alcohol in the oil, you should heat the alcohol out before mixing
into the butter.
 
Thanks to "Captain Cohen" for being my test subject for all the
variations and mutations.  Like you really hated it......

Banana Cake ****
 
Hi !  I finally got my shit together and found the recipe for you ...
It's basically a normal banana cake, except we prepared the dope in the
following way.  We took the butter and slowly melted it in a BIG wok.  Then,
when it had all melted we threw in the dope ,and stirred it all around, making
sure the dope was covered in butter.  Then we just followed the recipe as
normal, throwing in the dope/butter mix when it asked for it.  Oh, let the
dope/butter simmer slowly for a while, to get all the THC.  We left the dope in
the butter when we made ours, and it gave us a HUGE spin out ...
 
Banana Loaf ;)
 
125 g butter
1 cup sugar - we actually put in 2 cups, and it tasted just perfect
2 eggs
2 bananas (ripe ones)
1/3 cup of milk - well enough to give it the right texture, wett, but not runny
1 teaspoon vinegar
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
 
Oven Temperature : 180 C (350 F)
 
Cream butter and sugar.  Add eggs.  Beat it all well.  Mash up the bananas.
Stir them into the bowl.  Mix milk and vinegar in a cup.  Sift the flour and
baking soda in a separate bowl.  Add flour and milk to the butter bowl.  Mix
it all well.  Spread evenly in a greased 22 cm x 12 cm loaf tin.  Bake it
for 1 hour. (we actually cooked ours longer - basically cook it until you can
stick a clean dry skewer in the middle, and come out with a clean dry skewer)
 
Leave til next day to slice and butter.
 
We cooked ours at about 5.30 pm, and went to a party as soon as it was ready.
They were devoured in about 5 seconds ...
 
Re : how much dope to use ...
 
        We made the equivalent of 3 of these, and used an ounce of leaf, and
everyone was blown out.  Obviously, the more you use, the more blown out you'll
get.
 
Well ... enjoy !!
 
send me a piece ;)
 
[Be sure not to use the Federal Postal System.  My cake smelled a little...
not so normal.  UPS is great (although a piece may be missing from the cake
when it arrives)]
 
BreakFAST (!) ****
 
try adding 2 heaping tablespoons of manicured, cleaned, finely choped buds
to your breakfast cereal (3 works better), add milk and sugar like normal
and wala. works, stays with you and is different!
 
["AND is DIFFERENT!"  Yes... have we had our head checked?  Last time I ate
2 "heaping" tablespoons of buds was when I was in the back seat of a police
car.  Not fun.]
 
Well, I hope you had as much fun reading this as I did making it.  =)  No pun
intended.  Send all questions and Allen Ginsberg snippets to:
