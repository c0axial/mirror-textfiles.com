I don't know if all the questions have been answered in regards to cloud 9,
the alleged e substitute.  I hardly have all the answers.. But what I do know, 
is the following.  Friday night two friends of mine tried cloud 9. One of them 
was intoxicated from drinking about 6 or 7 beers.  The other was sober. The 
capsules that cloud 9 come in are huge. They swallowed the capsules and waited.
Within an hour they were both extremely sleepy, yet felt an urge to chat with
people at the same time. It was not in any way comparable to e, according to
both of them. Oh well.... Sorry about the bandwidth if you guys already know
all this.

	I don't think Clound 9 is GHB... it's a whole lot of organic material.
Ground up herbs and such... it didn't taste salty like GHB...

A friend of mine has purchased and tried Cloud-9. I read the brocure
it's distributers mail out on request, and it's very vague and unspecific,
and it tries to make this herbal placebo sound like a good replacement
for MDMA. Not a chance...

He bought the caplets from a health food store, for around $10 a piece.
He said it produced a definate warmth sensation, but it was very minimal,
and that a cup of coffe was way more psychoactive. He said it was a total
waste of money, and he wouldn't take it in the future even if it was free.
It's a placebo "sugar-pill".

At that price, there's far more worthwhile herbs and synthetics to spend
my money on.

	Well I've heard a lot about people asking about cloud 9.  I would
just like to tell you all that I have tried it and didn't notice a thing
once and noticed a little another time.  The first time I tried it I went
to a rave and I felt real active and excited.  The second time I sat
around my house and felt little more than awake.  The people who make it
say that you have to get out and be real active for the stuff to work. 
(It supposedly feeds off chemicals already in your body, like adrenaline
and stuff)   Thats mainly what I've found.  If anyone has any more direct
questions, just email me and I answer all of em.  

BTW, I was talking to someone about it through email and I seemed to have
lost his address,  If this was you then send me your address again.
(I think his name was Tom)


					Bye bye.

I've tried it...The experience was VERY similar to a caffine coctail 
(caffine and ephidrine) dose.  IMHO, It's nothing like "X".  Save your
bucks, and buy some no-doze and mini-thins, if you're into that kinda
thing.

Okay, I called some time ago, and obtained the stuff.
My roomate with a friend tried a capsule each. Waited but nothing happened.
I tried two capsules, again nothing happened. 

Did not even feel any stimulant effects ! A cup or two of coffee will
definately be stronger.

For all those posts with a stiry like :  I met such and such at and she/he
couldn't stop smilling .... etc, etc... FOAF said she/he was on 
*some new pill*  called Cloud ...

These stories are : a) a hoax to make people on the net get interested
             
               or 
 
                    b) confused reviews since some clubs throw parties
                       under names like "white cloud", or cloud whatever.
                       At these usually all dress in pure white ( as opposed
                       to the pure black of the 80's) and take X and 
                       generally have lots-and-lots of fun. 

So, I recommend to perspective buyers to beware. 

Actually I am surprised
that almost none on the net has relayed any personal tries of this 
hoax, of cloud 9 passing as a XTC substitute. On the bright side none has
said anything positive either.

There was that front page story in the Colorado Daily you might
(should) have read about two weeks ago...If I remember correctly, of
the four or so people who were willing to share their xperiences with
Cloud 9 bought at Nootrophia or Ground Zer0 in Boulder, one person
just felt sick after taking one or two capsules, one person reported
empathogen-like effects after taking it for three days continuously,
one person didn't notice anything . . . .

I had been wanting to take it after first hearing about it On The
Hill, and then right after that it's populartity exploded wheen it
started showing up on rave flyers at Wax Trax.  Soon after that was
when the Colorado Daily front-page article appeared, and the police
said they were going to do their tests on it and I'm sure the Daily
will publish what the plice want to say about it (if that's worth
anything).  Odds are they'll just say "it's a bunch of natural stuff
which you could mostly get at Alfalfa's or Wild Oats market and so any
effects that compare to those of ecstacy are largely psychosomatic."
I would suppose it would be extremely dissappointing to get one's
hopes up for this shit, especially anyone who's had any experience
with any of the designer drugs it's supposed to mirror (but mild
enough to be legal), like ecstacy.  TSS.  I think the interest in
Cloud 9 is from the same group of people who approach lsd with that "i
would but i want to do it naturally, so i'll do shrooms instead of acid"
mindset, just replace ecstacy with acid and Cloud 9 with shrooms.
But, of course, the parallel is flimsy at best, since not only or lsd
and shrooms fairly different, but ecstacy and Cloud 9 are not even on
tthe same level of intensity with each other.  

Here's a reprint of Nootrophia's flyer on Cloud 9, for what it's
worth.  It's vague, promotional, meant to sell the stuff, probably
doing mmore harm than good:

NOOTROPHIA PRESENTS CLOUD 9

   effect.   Each capsule is 850 mg.

	As I mailed kotobi@unm.edu, Cloud 9 is total and complete CRAP!

	I saw an ad for it in Sin and I thought it would be cool to try out,
since I was running a smart bar in the city at that time. I called the info
line and left my name and phone number as requested and recieved a return phone
call at about 8:00 p.m. the following day. I talked to a very nice lady on 
the phone and she described her product and how they were looking to find a
distributor for our area, because they didn't have one yet. They offered to
sell us a 100 count bottle for $5 a piece, the 'wholesale' price, I guess. I
thought to myself, "Damn! That's a lot of money!" But we said it was too
expensive and declined her offer.
	I receieved another call back with another offer for a 10 count bottle
for $30 + shipping. Some friends and I accepted and recieved the bottle three
days later. We decided to give it a try at the Halloween rave. Well, one friend
got completely sick, flushed and generally irratated. Another got nothing at
all, no 'increases energy, mild euphoria, increased sexual response,' NOTHING!
I took it and was milded irratated, kinda like a niacin flush, and a bit
sick.
	Later that week, I opened up one of the capsules I had left to see
what was in it. It looked and smelled EXACTLY like the ephedra that Durk &
andy use in their 'Thermogen Tea' formula. The powder was a fuzzy brown and
smelled vaguely spicey.
	My guess is all it is is EPHEDRA and maybe some ginseng or kava kava.
It's not worth $15-$20 a pop, especially when they recommend taking TWO pills.
I suggest locating some Mini Thins and taking some of those before you take
'the legal alternative to MDMA.' Its better and a hell of a lot cheaper! Don't
buy the sale pitch that its a cot effective alternative to Ecstasy. It's a
complete RIP-OFF! You're probably better off buying from the shadey E-dealer
than you are from the Cloud 9 peddler. At least you might wind up with
something good from the dealer!!

	Another alternative I've found that works is 'Happy Camper' available
from any GNC store at the mall. It comes in a nice happy yellow,green and red
bottle of 60. It's got kava kava, gotu kola nut, siberian ginseng, guarana?
and other natural stimulants that really work! Take about two or three and if
like it share with yer friends! A couple of those, a smart drink with 
l-phenylalanine and you'll be better off than taking that crap Cloud 9 stuff.

	Spread the word about this product: SAY NO TO CLOUD 9 !!!

	Peace, love & respect,

 It took Cloud 9 about a month ago, and except for a BRIEF burst of energy 
similair to honey it did nothing, especially at $15 a pop. Take X instead
it definatly is not an alternative or a substitute in any way shape or form.

	I was at the giveaway in Colorado when Nootropics was first trying
to market the stuff.  After taking it, and talking to about another dozen
people at the club, we all agreed that it was EPHEDRINE (white cross).

Well, I did it with my friends last thursday.  Boy, it was something. 
It's not at all like ecstasy though.  I tried x once and supposedly it
was more heroin than x so I guess I can't really say.  

I took one dose, which is two capsules of cloud 9.  I also took one
capsule of nirvana-6 which is supposed to boost/enhance the effects.  I
was very skeptical after reading a post here that described a cup of
coffee being stronger.  That is not altogether true, at least with me. 
Later we smoked some sticks of tea and so this is cloud 9 together with
the effects of THC.    

We did as prescribed, taking it on an empty stomach.  I had lunch at
around one o'clock and took the pill at around six that evening.  After
about an hour I started to feel something.  First, I could feel a
strange weirdness in my stomach.  Not butterflies, but kind of like the
feeling you get when you dose on acid and the first tremors of it affect
your stomach.  The whole time I was on cloud 9 I also felt a nervous
tension I also get with acid.  Except this was very low key.  On acid,
my whole body tenses; my jaw and head especially.  Cloud 9 did not do
that but gave a very similar tension emanating from my stomach at a very
low volume.  

If I tilted my head back so I could look straight up at the sky and then
slowly face forward at a normal angle, my whole scalp tingled.  Every
time I ran my fingers through my hair it plowed a path of tingling
sensations in my scalp.  My other friends felt the same.  I liked that a
lot.  That was about the only physical sensation I noticed, that and my
stomach feeling strange.  Later my stomach started to hurt a little, but
as soon as I started to talk again it went away.  Later, the tingles,
which lasted about two hours, went away and then at one point my heart
seemed to beat with irregularity.  It felt like my heart was being
overtaxed, kind of like heartburn but no burning sensation.  

My friend took two doses, six capsules in all, and he felt all those
effects in the first half-hour.  We were having a carnival at our school
and he felt sick after we rode the pirate ship which goes up and down
really high.  I had the greatest time on it though, lifting my hands up
every time we went to the top.  My friend though declined from riding
anymore after that.  

We all had strange periods where our stomachs would start to hurt.  But
if you keep talking, we found that it went away.  You know, get your
mind off it then all will be better.  

In terms of being an ecstasy substitue, nay I say.  I did feel like
doing things instead of just sitting around and stuff but everyone else
seemed really beat.  And I guess it could feel like the after effects of
an all nighter with coffee and vivarin.  I am not going to try this
again.  I don't think it's worth $20.  In terms of mood, I felt good
however, but that's because I like anything that alters my brain even a
little bit.  But if you're expecting some drastic things to happen,
you'll be disappointed.  It does give you a light, tense feeling for
about seven hours.  

I told my friends who weren't on it about the tingling scalp and they
just laughed saying it's not worth it.  If you like your scalp to
tingle, then this is the drug ( I mean vitamins) for you.

	According to my experiences and friends,  CLOUD-9 is as good
	as a placebo.  
	Nothing came on. Absolutely nothing. Not even caffeine-like
	effects. Not even a mild stimulation. These are the results of
	3-4 times of taking Cloud-9 myself and independent friends.
	All pills came from the same Cloud-9 sealed bottle. 

	Try sugar next time, or parsley. Parsley you can smoke.

	Caveat Emptor, or whatever.
