TI  - Methcathinone: a new and potent amphetamine-like agent.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the effect of
      N-monomethylation of phenylisopropylamine derivatives on amphetamine-
      like activity. In tests of stimulus generalization using rats trained
      to discriminate 1.0 mg/kg of (+)-amphetamine from saline, the N-
      monomethyl derivatives of 1-(X-phenyl)-2-aminopropane, where X = 2,4-
      dimethoxy (2,4-DMA), 3,4-dimethoxy (3,4-DMA), 2,4,5-trimethoxy
      (2,4,5,-TMA), and 2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxy (MMDA-2), did not
      produce amphetamine-appropriate responding at the doses evaluated.
      However, the N-monomethyl derivative of cathinone (i.e.,
      methcathinone), like cathinone, resulted in stimulus generalization.
      Further studies with this agent revealed that (a) in the amphetamine-
      trained animals, methcathinone (ED50 = 0.37 mg/kg) is more potent
      than racemic cathinone or racemic amphetamine (ED50 = 0.71 mg/kg in
      both cases), (b) methcathinone is capable of inducing release of
      radioactivity from [3H]dopamine-prelabeled tissue of rat caudate
      nucleus in a manner similar to that observed with cathinone,
      amphetamine, and methamphetamine, and (c) methcathinone is more
      potent than cathinone as a locomotor stimulant in mice as determined
      by their effect on spontaneous activity. The results of the present
      study provide evidence for a structural analogy between the
      prototypic psychostimulants amphetamine/methamphetamine and
      cathinone/methcathinone, and lend further support to the concept that
      amphetamine and cathinone correspond in their pharmacological
      effects.

Maybe not.  I have some notes comparing cathinone (the active principle
of qat) with amphetamine.  Rosecran et al. found that cathinone lacked
DA agonist activity, and showed less disruption of behavior in animal
studies.  This is in Harris (ed.), _Problems of drug dependence_, NIDA,
Monograph #27.  I don't know whether this generalizes to methcathinone.
