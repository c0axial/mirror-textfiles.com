    OK this story is about one of the most intense funnest happiest 
trip I have had yet.  It involves eight people of the name Dylan(me)(17), 
Chris(16), Luke(16), Nick(16), Michelle(19), Chasity(16), Brook(16), and 
Amy(16). It was a very slow night I was in my home town chilling out 
smoking a big fat joint over at my X-girlfriends house getting baked like 
any other night. Well we good old Chris wich has pulled alot of cool
things off in this town has a trusty friend in another town call him
with a offer for a new Vitamin-A in town. This acid went for 7$ a hit.
I thought first no fucking way I have had damn good trip for 3$ a hit
before.  Well anyway I thought that I would do it since I had a pocket
full of cash and if it wasn't good then I would get some different kind
I had lined up the next day so I wouldn't be totaly depressed about
getting ripped off.  So it get's there I look at it and am emidiately
mesmerised by the thickness and the size of this hit. It was called
Alice 'N Wonderland if you ever run across this particular acid or
one called Jesus Christ( GOOD LUCK! ) BUY BUY BUY AND BUY!!! So 
among the eight people I am talking about 5 take theirs emidiately. We all split 
up in two different cars and go off are own ways. I remember getting
in the car with Chris and Shannon was driving but she was sober, so she
was kinda like our keep us inline person. Well me and Chris haven't 
dropped yet when we see the first cop drive by we imediately dropped
due to fear of getting busted.  Well I remember Luke in the front seat
he was going on and on about how he wasn't feeling anything and he dropped
like 20 minutes ago when he said that. Well I was getting pissed off
really bad. I thought I got ripped off, not by anyone there or anything
I just felt like somebody had cheated me. I set there thinking that
for about 10 minutes in the back of a car.  The next thing I new we 
and the other car met up with Brook, Chasity, Tom(the sober driver in that
car),Nick, and Amy well we all got out and bamb I got happy as Luke got
happy I thought hmmmmm did I take a better dose or did luke confinse him
self it was bad. Well we decide to go to a party that was really lame, but
fun going to see the so called party, I remember getting out of the car
and running to the door yelling PARTY PARTY!!! Michelle the girl who
was suppost to have the party answered the door and said the party was
over it was like 12:00 a.m. or something must be a really lame party
I thought without saying good-bye I ran back to the car heading back
to my x-girlfriends house (Karina now Chris's girlfriend at the time)
we get there Karina's mom was in a bad mood everyone refferred to her
as Momma Chris well I would have gone crazy if there were like 16 people
in my house half of them half my age tripping their nuts off because momma
chris is usually the nicest women in the world until she gets mad wich 
she did that night, so we split out of there and headed back to the car
were we lost Chris and it was the two cars off again on a wild goose chase
to no place. Well now are numbers are down to seven. I was in the back
seat of Shannon's car and was getting the peak of my life aafter about
two hours of tripping I started to loose my vision and everyone was phrea-
king out. I somehow reamianed pretty calm as so did Chasity and Brook.
Luke and Nick were alright at first but they sort of started getting
scared wich is unusuall for them to get scared wich made me kind of 
scared, but then again nothing could measure to the time I did Jesus 
Christ and that's what I told my self that night about a million times.
You see Acid is increadible in the way it distorts everything but
still makes it so clear, I think acid is just basically a circle mind fuck
where you keep thinking around and round in circles and you just
have to keep it posotive to get through it and have fun. Ok back to the
story we were all crusing having fun being in retard tripping stage at
this point, so finally we split up one more time and am not able to
find one another's car's so we go to Shannon's house and I light a cig-
erette like it's a candy stick, then walk inside her house with a big
talking parrot and a huge fluffy scary looking dog. This dog looks like
it's nose is in my eye when it was sniffing me. I kinda phreaked and
got up and had a huge nice rush like I just did a big fat line of
uncut peanut butter crank or something and walked very fastly out the
door when I sawl like four people just walking around the yard that
wasn't there I even almost went to go talk to somebody that I thought
i recognized before i caught my self and said hellooo!!!!!!!!!!! Well
i went back inside and tried to avoid the annoying dog, and concentrate
on the talking parrot wich was a very good decision well we got ahold 
of the other car by pager wars finally they all show up at Shannon's
house when they get out of the car I immediately get like 4 or 5 different
hugs. Well it just so happens that shannon(the sober person)in our car
has a problem with her car wich means people are stuck at her house
so we come up with a solution cram 7 people in a little red convertable.
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMM let's think about this, well fuck it I'm tripping I
said and don't give a fuck. so my 6ft. 2" body crams in the back of this
car with Brook(A girl I am not attracted to in the sober world but am
in the tripping world somehow) on my lap and chasity squashed up over my 
left leg. Well we drive around trying to find a place to go, and that
would be Aaron's house wich I used to hate but like now, and so We enter
the perfect place to trip and chill out talk, talk, talk, visualize, hal-
uncionize, and confinse boy I had to do alot of that that night. I mean
Luke felt like he was a dick to everyone that night I was like no youv'e
been cool your just tripping, and he was going on about how he had been
clowned so bad and everyone wasn't getting along with him, wich I totally
understand that has happend to me multiple times when I tripped so they
(Nick, and Luke) were saying how the trip was wired and it wasn't right
they were kinda scared well I was chilled out and told them the same
thing I told my self the hole night I had doubts, and that was I had
tripped like twice as hard once before and I was fine two days later
after that incedent and eversince, so they got in aa really good mood
and we all just talked and brook wich I guess I liked that night for
god knows why was talking to me and I was like in a trip hipnotic 
thing were I liked her or something, well Chasity, Amy, and Brook all
go back to Amy place I think it was and end up calling us and we talked
to them all night on the phone it was the perfect thing to do when you
were tripping, and I had Luke and Nick trying to hook me up with Brook
over the phone (don't get me wrong brook is a nice person as a friend
but i think friends in the real world is all I can see in her) ok well
that went on for like two hours getting no where and so I said fuck it
quit asking her, and felt really really stupid but it was verry funny
at the same time, Well I remember smoking more cigerettes and laughing
and talking about everything and just having the funnest time I ever had
at 4:30 in the morning in an old enemies room. So it got to about six and
I was coming down unfortunately I was still tripping but all peak was
gone. Well I remember coming down relly good and going home the next
day and falling asleep and having the coolest dream ever about me going 
to disney world. ?????????? I dunno but that was a hell of a night. Trip-
ping is something that can be very emotional and fun but only if you
treat it right and don't do it to much. I might do it every month or
two for a nice cool party night, but I have seen people that cant add
for a while because they were doing it on a everyday basis. This story
is true and there is alot more to it. Ohh yeah well Chris went home
and talked to Karina all night and did real good by himself be occupied
on the phone for his trip and Michelle was tripping and left the scene
at the beginning wich made her really not part of the story except that
she tripped. I hope you like this lame Biography story.
