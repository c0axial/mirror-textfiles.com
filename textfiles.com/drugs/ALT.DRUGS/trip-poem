Subject: My first trip

Red Roses, Red Roses, Red Roses. They pricked my finger and their poison got
into me system. !8hrs. of pure fun. Didn't know what was going on but then
again I didn't give a shit.  I've got a poem to show you what I mean: "The
Long and Winding Trip"

sitting down on a mountain high
shootin up to see the sky
watching all the birds fly by
you can see everything when your high

colors of no immagination
all things of variation
everything is one fixation
with the sky you have a relation

lasts for only thirteen hours
you seek out unknow powers
thoughts and feelings- showers and showers
prettiest things look like flowers

trip has gone from sweet to bad
everything you see suddenly clad
can't come out, your going mad
a peaceful state is what you had.

LSD has become the world to me. Thank you for letting me share my poetry.
Time to drop my hits, I have 3. Will I have more, lets wait and see. Thanx a
lot.

Nico Blue, says "high"
