This story begins at about 11:00pm one night a few months ago. My friend (we'llcall him T) finished work and came straight over to my house. We then went and picked up our 16 year old drug fiend friend (called M). T and I are both 21. M had just scored some of the famous MicroDots. Apparently these were really fucking strong trips. I was sick with a cold and had been taking prescrition medicine for it and because of this I (rather foolishly) decided notto have one, but the other two were really excited. We went to T's house and Mand T ate their acid in T's backyard before we went inside so T could get changed.  We said goodbye to T's mum (luckily the acid hadn't hit them yet; if sheonly knew.She is a regular church goer) and we left to go to what M had told us was a T Party. We drove to house nice littlesuburban house, went around the back and inside to find about 8 other 16 year olds all with big smiles on their faces. The house was owned by a guy called P'sparents (who were home). As the acid hadn't hit them all yet it was decided thatto bring on their trips,smoking some of the wondrous purple headed buds that oneof the kids had, would be in order. We all went up to a shed in the backyard and starting smoking. I had onesingle cone and was fucked,so to see 16 year olds having 2 of the strongest piecesof acid available at that time (to us) and then have 10 or so cones made me feelquite inadequate (not to mention dissapointed that I had not had any acid).  It was about then that all of a sudden T began clutching at his face, trying to peel an imaginary spider web off his face. The fun had begun. T went outside for a minute and then came back in to tell us that it was a whole different world outside. He was now grinning broadly.I found an old phone on thefloor of the shed and hit it to make a ringing sound. All of them looked aroundstunned. I then started dialing on then phone but I had to stop this as theywere all getting a little freaked out by this.By this time I was real angry thatI had had no acid, but I was really smashed from the cone (must have been the cold) so I was not too worried.  We all went inside the house again where an episode of Kung Foo was on. Again T broke the silence by all of a sudden asking if David Caradine really hadgreen hair or not. The answer was no and he was shocked.He remains shocked aboutthat to this very day. P decided he needed to go for a walk down the road to getsome cigarettes and he needed T to go with him as he was not old enough to buythem. P and his girlfriend and T all went on what seemed like the mission of alife time. The rest of us stayed inside and watched TV whilst the other threewent and had what was described later as a 'big adventure'. I will now relate itfrom the graphic descriptions T has given me. It may not sound the best but Treally seemed to enjoy it. P has a huge park across the road from his house and so the 3 cigarette getters decided to walk through it their way down the road.They crossed the roadand headed for the park when all of a sudden T told the other two to stop.  'Watch out for the wolf in the tree' he said, slightly scared. The othertwo told him that it was in fact just a tree. He looked hard and saw that they were correct. Cool, he thought. Out onto the large expanse of open grass they walked, all the time looking around and immensly enjoying the experience. Slowly, T began to hear a low flying plane and, not quite as slowly, an ideaformed. 'Duck', T yelled 'They're bombing us' Instantly T was in World War 2 and the plane was about to bomb the fieldthat they were in.T and P's girlfriend G both ran and dove on the ground,coveringtheir heads with their hands. P laughed at them and told them to get up.T lookedaroung relieved and them spotted the most beautiful cat that he had ever seen. He got up and ran over to it, picked it up and cradled it in his arms.The other two laughed at him alot since T was holding a stick in his arms and Iimagine that would look really quite funny. By now T was reeling. He had onlyeaten acid once before and it was quite weak and he wasn't really prepared forthe intense experience that he was having..But fuck he was having fun.He was now seeing everything alot lighter that normal and his vision was like looking inthe reflection of a glass window (his vision being what you could see behindyou by looking in the reflection). Time to get those cigarettes. They finally arrived in the very, very well lit service station (gas station for all of the Americans). P then reminded T that it was T that had to actually go in and do the buying. T had forgoten this and was a bit dubious, buthe went in anyway. The whole time he had a feeling of everyone watching him andhe expected to start seeing things again at any time and he didn't really knowhow he would deal with that. Nothing happened though he he made it out, withonly slightly less of his sanity than he had before he went in. The three of them started slowly walking back to P's house, all the timelooking at how beautiful the trees and the grass and everything looked.When theyfinally made it back to the house they found that all of the bud had been consumed by these unstoppable teenagers (Fuck, I felt old). Everyone (except me)was now tripping quite hard. On went the 'trippy music' and an appropiate videowas found to be watched (GhostBusters 2). One guy called G was having greattrouble lifting his drink to his mouth becase it was 'too heavy' so he triedholding his hand in the one position and moving his mouth to the drink but thisdidn't work either. Eventually someone helped him and he went back to his ownlittle world again (G had had 2 microdots and 15 or more cones and spent the next three hours or so simply saying 'I'm fucked'...and he was right). On went the video and T was into it straight away. He felt that he was in the movie; living it. He imagined that all of the main characters were hisfriends and his friend were the Ghostbusters (ie. I was Venkman or someone andhe was one of the others and so on).  At one stage during the video, T jumped up in fright, lent over to me and said 'The heater just growled at me'. The heater made another slight noise and T ran over to to the other side of the room. He wasn't scared really and hewas laughing the whole time but things got just a little too wierd for him fora minute and he had to just get away for a bit. He told G his problems, sortedout reality again (slightly) and then returned to his seat to continue his lifeas a GhostBuster. There were many 'trippy' things in this movie such as the bath tub comingalive and T enjoyed all of them immensly. The movie finished and we started watching the American infomercials that have started invading our TV screenshere in Australia. That proved also to be a very strange experience for all ofthem and I have never seen so much interest in Blue Blockers before. After a while all of the others started dregging out and I started shutting down (it was about 4:30 am by now) so T, still tripping very hard, offered to drive me home, an offer that I gladly accepted. Luckily for both of us I lived within easy walking distance, so the drive was not long and relatively safe. It only took a minute or two and T dropped me off and I wentinside to ponder over a night that I don't think I will forget in a while. T left my house and (rather foolishly he now admits) he went for a driveby himself. He drove for about ten more minutes until he saw a big, scarypolice car and the foolishness of the solo drive fully hit him. He drove to hisgrandparent's house of all places,stopped the car,got out and sat on their frontfence for 20 minutes in a effort to regain his mind enough to drove back to P's house. After a while he was ready. Back he drove to find the rest of the them all in various states of sleep.(either fully,almost or well on the way).T stayedthere for about 30 minutes more until he decided it was time to go. The sun wascoming up as he got home and inside he went for some well earnt sleep. Mistake. T lay on his bed and tried to sleep but for about 2 and a halfhours more he hullucinated every time he closed his eyes. Finally he drifted offto sleep. When he awoke, he ran me and we discussed the nights events with somefriends over some excellent cones....But that's another story. It is certaintlya night that neither I (nor definately he) will forget in a hurry.
