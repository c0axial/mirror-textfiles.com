Well, when I lived in Alaska, I'd once had a call from the state troopers
saying they'd seized a package from a rivate courier service addressed to me
containing four ounces of marijuana, along with some flimsy evidence...
 
I avoided calls, and one day while asleep two officers came by and the door
was answered by someone else who awoke me. I went to the door, and they intr
oduced themselves and their reason for visiting. They asked for a personal
interview at their station. Luckily my Godfather was who originally answered 
the door, and let know they're two dimentional. . .I said I'd have to call my
lawyer, they let me do so, he was not immediately in his office.
 
I escorted them to their car and took business cards, and answered their 
question about who my lawyer was, and never heard from them since.
 
Although my laywer has been nearly disbarred since then for ethical 
misconduct, and I currently no longer live in the United States.
