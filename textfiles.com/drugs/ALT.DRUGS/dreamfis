O.K. from a book "The Hallucinogens" - Hoffer & Osmond

'Even a variety of fish produces hallucinations.  Roughly (1960)
described the dream fish present near Norfolk island.  The inhabitants
stated consuming this fish would produce nightmares.  In order to test
this claim, Joe Roberts, National Geographic photographer, consumed
some of the fish, broiled.  The next morning he reported "It was pure
science fiction." He saw a new kind of car, pictures of monuments to
mark man's first trip into space.  The fish is Kyphosus fuscus,
closely related to the silver drummer caught off New South Wales.
The author, Roughly, also tried the fish and had weird dreams.'

: Yup, a file I happen to have (in Finnish, I'm afraid) has the following
: list of psychotropic fish:
: Abudefduf septemfasciatus (Sergeant major)    Pacific Ocean, Africa
: Epinephelus corallicola (Grouper)             Pacific Ocean
: Kyphosus cinerascens (Bluefish)               Indonesia
: Kyphosus vaigiensis (Brass bream)             Indonesia
: Mugil cephalus (Flathead mullet)              The tropics
: Mulloidichtys samoensis (Golden goatfish)     Indonesia
: Neomyxus chaptali (Mullet)                    Indonesia
: Saganus oramin (Rabbitfish)                   Indonesia, West Africa
: Upeneus arge (Goatfish)                       Indonesia

: (Halstead, Courville: Poisonous and Venomous Marine Animals of the World,
: Vol 2, U.S.Government Printing Office 1967)

: Other than that, it just states that "nobody is known to have died from
: consumption".  No mention of what the active ingredient is or anything.
: I'd venture a guess at either a DMT relative or bufotenin relative,
: which crop up in the venoms of other animals.

Someone should do an analysis :)
There is also an hallucinogenic catipiller, or so says "chemistry in the
market place" (cant remember the author just now). Unfortunately he doesnt
provide a reference.
