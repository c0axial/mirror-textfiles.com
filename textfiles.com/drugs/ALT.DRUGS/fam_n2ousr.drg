Hello everybody,

I promised to send out this list I have, with well known people, using
n2o (nitrous oxide) as a drug. I am sorry, but this list is somewhat
Anglo-saxon-oriented, but what can you expect? The original list was
published in 'The book of lists' by Wallechinsky et al. And it gives
also lists of famous people usingcocaine, hash, morfine, LSD, mescaline
heroine and opium. If anyone is interested, well, let me know or buy the
book. It is a bit old, but still as interesting as an old 'Guiness book
of records'.

Thomas Wedgwood, 1771-1805, English Physicist
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, 1772-1834, English Poet
Robert Southey, 1774-1843, English Poet

William James, 1842-1910, American Philosopher
Theodore Dreiser, 1871-1945, American Writer and Journalist

Well, that's it. Be happy with it and I am not responsible for any
mistakes, that has been made by the authors of the Book of Lists.
