-- Anyone dare say how their first time trippin' went?It was too intense!!!  I probably should not have combined mescaline andacid for my first time...  But, I was young and foolish!  It took yearsbefore I'd try anything psychedelic again, although I do have some fondmemories of that fateful day.  The plain white walls became covered withincredible, complex wallpaper patterns, and mist rose from the floor tiles.  In the mirror, I saw my face morph back and forth into that of a snow leopard.The raindrops outside turned into tiny little prisms, and I could see sound-waves.  Unfortunately, my then boyfriend came over and punched me, and thetrip became hideously evil.  I was sooooo frightened that I would never comedown.My last trip?  Grateful Dead, front row center, last show of summer tour...I never stopped dancing!!!  Thanks for the fluff, Mr. Bloop, if you're outthere! :)Peace,:) Hilary--  rec.drugs.psychedelic
