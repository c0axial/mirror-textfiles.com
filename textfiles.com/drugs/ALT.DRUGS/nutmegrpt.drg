There was a big Saturday night rave occuring (big by Brisbane's standards
anyway)My friend and I due to being short of money were unable to buy any
chemicals so we decided to give nutmeg a whirl.We wandered up to the local'healt  
health food store where we purchased two different types of nutmeg.
The whole nutmeg was then ground down to a fine powder.I decided to try
the batch from Indonesia while my friend opted for the stuff from Sri Lanka.
My Indonesian Nutmeg was of a lighter colour where my friend's was a dark
rich colour.This was the main reason he chose it, he later stated.
We both consumed it at 6.30 pm since I had read on the network that it took
up to 5 hours to come on. Bullshit to say the least , after the consumption
of 3 tablespoons each I started to feel a bit drunk within 20 minutes.
Within 1 hour I felt really drunk, my speech was slurred , I could not walk
in straight line and generally felt fucked.What was I going to feel like 
in 4 hours? This thought scared me.One hour passed and I started to feel more
energetic , the phone rang and I answered it knowing it would be my friend.
My friend was on the line telling me he felt really stoned and had totally
lost it in front of his parents just previously.Since I would be meeting him
in about 1 hour I got ready to go.When I arrived at his house to go to the 
rave I was feeling darn good. The nutmeg was acting like virtually every 
drug I have ever taken. I had all the effects of alcohol , the increased 
confidence as well as all the others. My thought process changed as well
with me coming up with some weird abstract shit, that always happens when
I have a smoke.By about 10 pm I was peaking, I was having mild hallucinations
and quite good ones if I closed my eyes. Nutmeg was also a very funny drug
My friend and I were laughing uncontrollably and could not get into the music
as much as we have liked to. I started dancing but had to quit since I was
laughing at people on the dance floor. I quit before I got my head kicked in.
By 12 pm the spin was just as intense as it was 2 hours earlier , and my
face started to show the signs. My eyes were so red and I could not keep them
open , I generally looked wasted.My friend was doing unreal , he was sitting
in a corner laughing hysterically looking like an asylum patient.
By 2 am the intensity had not declined and I was getting really tired of the
spin. Minutes later my friend ran out of the rave with me following as soon
as possible. I managed to see him throw up and pass out.(NO shit)
I thought this was going to last as long as LSD but I was wrong , the nutmeg
spin lasted longer.I left the rave at 6am still spinning off my dial.My 
friend was still outside although he had crawled 10 metres to be found
sleeping under a tree.The next day was a blur as had been the night before.
My friend who is postman , did not go to work on Monday. Took an extra
2 hours to do his run on Tuesday(Got in huge trouble) and rode his bike
into an embankment on Wednesday spilling all the mail onto a main road.
He did not straighten up until Friday. I was completely straight on 
Tuesday.All in all I quite liked nutmeg but hte intensity was too much,
the feeling generated could not be defined, but fucked comes in to mind a lot
I think I will stick to E's but they are damn hard to come by lately.

=============================================================================

	The Natural Highs FAQ made Nutmeg sound like a substance
definitely worth avoiding, but after talking to a friend of mine, I
decided to give it a try.  It didn't do much, but I was extremely groggy
for the remainder of the following day (something I didn't relate to the
Nutmeg for quite some time)...

	I didn't give up, however, and I decided that I had a neat
alternative to watching the Super Bowl...  I kept a little account of
what happened - it reads as follows:

January 31, 1993 -
 
        4:35 P.M. : I toss enough nutmeg in my mouth to make closing
it difficult (due to a snap of the wrist that was a bit more zealous
than I'd planned).  Ice water as a chaser (that -has- to be relatively
safe).
 
        5:05 P.M. : Another 3/4 tbsp or so, and water.
 
        5:20 P.M. : Felt like about a tablespoon this time.  I've been
eating quite a few itty bitty rice cakes, due to hunger.
 
        5:35 P.M. : Effectively finished off my bottle of nutmeg...  I
barely coaxed down 2 more mouthfuls of about 1/2 tbsp each.  Let's
assume about 3.75 tbsp over the past hour.
 
        6:13 P.M. : Mild headache
 
        8:00 P.M. : Slightly dizzy, especially when walking.
 
        8:51 P.M. : Unbelievably dizzy, and my hearing is indefinate.
I feel soooo heavy.  I am sinking constantly, and my vision is slowed.
Neat. Pleasant.  Relaxed.
 
        9:08 P.M. :  Same as above, but I am spinning, also.  This is
still very relaxing and peaceful.  My head is swimming especially, and
my motions feel much different than I am used to - sort of as if the
motions are dragging behind the limbs that are moving.
 
        9:20 P.M. : Just got off telephone - my short-term memory is
virtually nonexistant - I couldn't repeat something I'd said 10
seconds ago.  I had been watching Acidwarp, and - wow.  It was
unbelievable.  Somehow my vision seems amplified.  I noticed patterns
I'd never seen before, and I felt like I was "in" many of them.  I am
spinning in 10 ways at once, slowly. On my way to bed.
 
 
February 1, 1993 -
 
        6:05 A.M. : I wake up, with a bit of a headache, and a mild
spinning sensation.  I'm a bit tipsy, a little less balance than I'd
like, but I'm not moving inefficiently.
 
        6:06 P.M. : Almost all the effects are gone, I had cottonmouth
pretty bad all day, and I was weak - not tired, but weak, and my head
was never quite still.  Not at all unpleasant, just a bit of an
inconvenience.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I went back and edited that a tad, because a few of the errors I made
were embarassing - I dropped some punctuation, spelling, even a word or
two...
 
	Anyhow, I really enjoyed this.  I used pre-ground nutmeg, bought
relatively recently...  It's not something I plan to use regularly, but
I have some whole nutmeg I plan try try freshly-ground...  I've also
heard good things about mixing it with mace.  I never felt sick, apart
from certain times during the hangover on Monday (I had P.E. that day at
school - somewhat nasty, I'll admit.)

	For thsoe of you that missed it, "Acidwarp" (which I referred
to) is this wonderful PC VGA kaleidescope program written by Noah
Spurrier.  I always liked it, but I am definitely glad I thought to
watch it while I was on the nutmeg.  Also - I went to sleep listening to
music (Skinny Puppy, actually..)  That was nifty, as I heard things
differently.  Most of the new things I heard were in the higher ranges,
which made the entire CD sound different.  I noticed some spoken words
I'd never heard before and can't find again - either they're not meant
to be heard consciously, or I was putting it there myself.

	The only unpleasant part of this at all was the hangover, and
that was even kind of nice - it was refreshing to have something to do
at school...  I found that I felt as if I was falling, most of the time.
 If I leaned to the side, I kept going that way for quite some time.  If
I leaned to the left, and then the right, I kept falling in both
directions for quite some time.  I would have to say that this was, all
together, a positive experience.  Anyone else have a story to share?
 
=============================================================================
 
I tryed Nutmeg a few months ago, about 3 Tb worth all at once with a cold 
milk to wash it down. Took about 2 hours to kick in and felt like a big 
pot buzz but with the dizzyness one gets after drinking too much, very 
prone to giggle at one point. I have no visuals like say LSD but I did 
seem to like to view colorful patterns (this book on fractals I have was 
nice to look at) my short term memory was impared, but not too extreme
 
The next day I was in a daze, if any of you out there ever want to try 
this make shure it's a friday, vacation, or you have extra sick days 
because I wouldn't suggest you go to work/school after doing nutmeg I 
had school the next day, real lousy like walking in your sleep, It wasn't 
bad per say, but way too much thinking and walking then I was in the mood 
for.
 
but overall I give nutmeg a thumbs up, didn't feel sick once, well I felt 
ill downing it though .. very icky, the high has it's nice points and 
when it was over no trouble getting to sleep (prepare to CRASH hard after 
wards, and sleep like a log) unlike acid

have fun

=============================================================================

[quoted text deleted -cak]

I've tried nutmeg once, years ago.  Clueless as to how much my friend and
I took, but we tried it with everything; water, milk, soda, straight, and
it tastes like shit no matter how you take it.  Afterward...nothing.  The
night went by and nothing happened.  However,  when I woke up in the
morning, the walls were breathing for several minutes.  My friend reported
spider webs covering the floor of the classroom he was in.  Other than
that...nothing.

My two cents...it's not worth it.

Safe and happy travels.

Peace

Steve

Hey - whoever's been posting things here that said Nutmeg can get you fucked up
was full of shit.  i ate 8 whole nutmegs in two hours and 15 minutes -- the 
last four i ate were in a ten-minute time span, and that was 2 hours and 20 minutes ago, and i haven't felt a thing.  i wish people would post facts here, not
bullshit they heard from a FOAFOAFOAF.  For all those curious out there, let me
save you from wasting your time.  As for intoxicating effect, Nutmeg does

		J A C K    S H I T !!!!!!!!

so don't bother.


btw, smoking banana peels doesn't do shit either  :)

		      My Experience On Nutmeg



   I went to the local natural foods shop and bought a big bag
of pre-ground nutmeg.  It was about 2 bucks and there was a lot.
My friend and I were doing this together -- we each got a glass
of water, put 2 tablespoons in, stirred up the water, and tried
to drink it.  We realized it was hard to get down with one glass,
so we tried more, I forget how many it took.  Let me warn everyone
that the stuff tastes like absolute shit and it is *impossible*
to eat without water -- I think when you put it in your mouth,
it absorbs a lot of water or something, so you can't produce any
saliva to swallow it... that's just a theory and I'm not really
sure.  Anyways, by this point my friend got pretty sick to his 
stomach -- luckily I felt no sickness.

   About 3 hours later, the effects began.  This was the second
major mind altering drug next to alcohol that I had done.  I told
my friend that I was feeling something and he said it must be 
placebo.  I thought he might be right, but I realized as it got
stronger, no -- this was for real.. I was *definately* high. My
friend still didn't believe me.  The high must have been comparable
to marijuana, however at that time, I hadn't tried pot yet, so I
can't be sure; but I remember losing concentration a lot and paying
too much attention to pointless things.  We went into a video store
and I'd stare at a poster, and then realize that we were supposed
to be looking for a movie.  We got What About Bob.. payed for it,
and started to walk home.

   Still, my friend had no high, and he didn't for the rest of the
night -- I think I consumed a little more than him, because he was
to sick to have it all, but I don't think it was too much of a 
difference.  By this time, my high had grown a lot.  My mind was
thinking in a network of thoughts;  worthless thoughts that all
seemed to fit together; well, I can't say worthless because I can't
quite remember exactly what they were.  But every 10 seconds I'd
have a new thought, and it would remind me of another thought I
just had, and another thought that reminded me of that, and so on..
these thoughts were linking together and forming some pattern, and
my mind was just thinking more and more and more thoughts..

   I don't remember how long this lasted.  I don't know if the next
stage was a continuum of this or if the thoughts went away.  It's
been 2 years since the experience so I can't quite remember.  But
by this time, we were home and the movie was plopped into the VCR.
As the moviewent on, I had no clue what was going on.  No concept
of the plot at all.  I didn't even know who Bob was.  I tried to
focus on the movie, but my mind just *couldn't* -- it was impossible
to comprehend.  My mouth was getting REALLY dry.  I got a glass of
water (or my friend got it for me, can't remember), I'd drink it,
and once it was done my mouth wasn't any better at all.  So I'd keep
drinking water -- to no avail.  I was getting hot and sweaty.  The
high now wasn't too pleasant.

   I think the movie was over when I decided to go upstairs and go
to sleep (this was at my friend's house), but I can't remember.  I
walked up the stairs... suddenly I was in his room (which is right
next to the top of the stairs) and then I was halfway up the stairs
and then I was in his room again -- it was like time was being 
distorted.. imagine this:

	my experience of time
<-------------------------------------->
Event A     Event B    Event C   

the above is this clipping of me walking up and down the stairs had I
not been experiencing this time hallucination. Below is what I really
perceived -- with the hallucination.

         my experience of time
<------------------------------------->
Event A     Event B    Event A    Event C    Event B   

This time hallucination lasted about 15 seconds and was over.. INTENSE..
It freaked the hell out of me!  (Scientifically, what happened, is that
I remembered the past events (being at the top, middle, or bottom of the
stairs) so vividly that my mind actually relived them -- I read about it
about a year later... can't remember the name for the phenomena)

  So I ran downstairs as fast as I could and told my friend.  He helped
me walk upstairs so nothing would happen like me passing out and rolling
down the stairs and breaking my neck or something (exaddurated).. I went
upstairs and lay down... ahh...

   And then.. in the background.. there was this feeling.. no, a sound,
rather.. maybe a feeling... anyways it was this... "feelound" in the back
of my brain.. it gradually grew louder and more intense.. louder.. LOUDER..
And now it was so loud that it HURT my HEAD -- it got LOUDER and LOUDER
AND I COULDN'T STAND IT AND IT WAS SPLITTING MY BRAIN IN TWO -- IT WAS
SO INTENSE AND SO STRONG AND SO PAINFUL THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!!!!
AAAHHHH!!!!AHHHH!!!!!AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(and then i moved my head slightly)



silence.


 
   But the feelound came back.. and it grew.. and it GREW. AND IT GREW!!!
AND IT WAS TEARING MY BRAIN APART AGAIN -- AAAHHH!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

and i twitched my head..

and it started, again, very silently.  And I twitched my head so it wouldn't
grow.. and I twitched my head.. over and over and over.. I kept twitching
my head so the horrible feelound would not take control of my sanity.. So
I kept twitching my head until I realized that I better get to sleep and 
I couldn't get to sleep if I kept twitching my head like this..

   So the feelound came back.. it grew and GREW AND GREW AND GREW!!!!!!!!

twitch. 

   no, I couldn't let it do that.  It would be easier to get to sleep by
twitching my head over and over than letting the feelound conquer my brain.
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. it's 2 in the morning and I HAVE TO GET TO SLEEP!!
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..
No!! I have to do SOMETHING!! ANYTHING!! I can't go on like this all night!!!
What can I do?  No -- my friend is asleep, and won't listen to me... anyways,
even if I told him, he couldn't do anything.. What would he do anyways, take me
to a hospital where they'd know I did drugs?  Tell his parents so they'd know
I did drugs?  No.. nothing can be done...... Nothin... it's so late, nothing
can be done... Oh my god, this sucks.  This really sucks big time.. I'll never
do any drug again.. NEVER NEVER NEVER... It's not worth it ... This SUCKS...
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. 
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. 
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..

twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..
twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch.. twitch..
etc. etc.. for so long I didn't think it would ever end.

   The next morning-- I was awake, my mom came to pick me up... I was really
zonked.  I felt spaced.  I still couldn't concentrate.. I now had to go to band
camp today.. well, my mom was taking me there and I saw my face in the mirror
and it was whiter than hell.. "Have you been drinking?", my mom asked.  "No."
I got to the high school band room and we took attendance, etc.. people wondered
why I was so pale.  I told some of them.  We got on the buses and I just sat in
my seat, completely out of it.  I didn't really talk to anyone the whole ride up..
We got there and it was a relief to have a room to be in.. but there were a lot
of responsibilities at band camp - not really the first day, though..

   But the second day came, and I was still in a dreamy/zonked/out-of-it/hangover.
I was lost.  I was confused.  I had to work on my music!!  My instructor explained
the mallet parts to me and I tried to do them well, but I didn't understand.. He'd
say something and I was lost.. What was wrong with me, he must have thought..

   The third day, still there, but less... the fourth day, basically gone, maybe
a little bit left.. And finally, I could continue with my life... No, I didn't keep
up with the idea that I should never do drugs.  I figured it was just nutmeg.  And
it was, basically.  I've always had strong reactions to drugs.. The first time I
smoked pot, it hit me like a 2x4 and I literally fell down -- or I spontaneously
lay down because the onset was so overwhelming and unexpected.  The second time I
did shrooms was my friend's first time, and interestingly enough, his experience
was stronger.  I had a hard time dealing with shrooms, mostly because of the 
conditions in which I was.  But nutmeg's different -- it doesn't matter if it's
set or setting -- if you're going to have a bad reaction, you're going to have it,
at least if it's something like a feelound -- I wish I could have stopped the 
feelound.. Maybe I could have just stood up and walked around and it would have
gone away because I'd be constantly moving.. But I was too zonked to even think
about that.. Twitching was easier, anyways.. but the overall experience wasn't
really worth it, even without the feelound.  The dry mouth, the 3 day hangover..
Personally, I'll never do nutmeg again in my life, I guess that goes without saying,
though.  If you DO decide to do it, have a mild tranquilizer (chemical that will
put you to sleep) on hand -- valerian root is a good one which you can get at many
natural foods stores.. or just plain sleeping pills.  If I just had sleeping pills,
I would have only had to go through 5 - 10 minutes of the feelound instead of a
whole hour or two (maybe it wasn't even half an hour, I don't know, I have no idea,
but it felt like eternity).  But my best advice is to go with other drugs (if any)
and find out about what the drug does before you do it!
