This is a true story...
I pulled out of our culldesac one sunny afternoon and turned right headed
up a steep hill near our house.  I just happened to be headed to a buddys
house and had an 1/8 of skunk next to me in my Subaru.  The Subaru has
only got 4 cyls and I usually gun it to get up the hill.  So I was going about
40 (in a 25 residential) and I noticed a county sheriff coming down the hill
toward me.  I really didn't slow down much when I saw him because didn't
suspect he'd have his radar gun on....but he did!  and he circled around
and turned the lights on.  
My heart really started beating fast, I was stoned and had this bud, so I
tossed the weed down by my left foot and placed my shoe over the pot!
(Like this is really gonna help!!)
Anyway I rolled my window down (So the car could air out a bit} and slowed
to a stop.  I gave the sheriff my drivers license and insurance.
He said he had me on radar going 45 miles an hour!
He walked back to his car.
{At this point I'll have to say I have no warrants or anything outstanding on me}
For some reason I got out of my car (Hands visible, moving slowly} and went
back to his car and said:
  "Sir I couldn't have been speeding, I live in that culldesac and I am
    very careful in the neighborhood..." blah blah "...By the way, since you
    said you had me on radar for 45 miles an hour, can I see the readout on
    the gun...I can't believe I was going that fast!?"

   ....Silence of the sheriff....for awhile...more silence...I had said my peace...
    "Well you know", he said, "I have to push this button before this gun will
     retain the speed on the display..." 

He then commences to show me this radar gun and the various readings
it gives and how it works...and the more he talked about it the more I 
think he realized that this radar gun was a piece of crap!!

He ended up just giving me a warning and  telling me to slowdown!
I had visions of ending up in jail with an 1/8th of weed!
