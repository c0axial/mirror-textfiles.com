	My high school's advisor of Sigma Alpha Delta (Students Against
Drinking/Drugs-- the local misinformation joint) recently asked me to
critique two pamphlets she had received. Today I began work, but I didn't
get to the second one. (I am not finished with the first one yet.)
	If you'd like to send me suggestions about how to discuss the points
mentioned, or how to improve what I have said, please do so. This advisor is
of the "compassionate" temperament. When I was speaking to her today I
emphasized that I want legalization not because I or others want to smoke
pot, but I want it because it would make drug use less dangerous. (That was
what she picked up-- I said more, but she didn't pick up onthe rest of what
I said..)
	Note that she told me today, *sort of* that she is infavor of
alcohol prohibition. I told her how under alcohol prohibition and limited
tobacco availability the situation was worse, and I don't know if I got that
point across. Remember that when you make your comments. Someone else
commented though, that legalizing drugs is differeing from ending the
prohibition of alcohol because alcohol was in widespread usage, while most
drugs right now have been illegal for a long time and there isn't public
support for legalization.  I couldn't think of anything to say to that-- any
ideas?
	Thanks.

	Well, I finished everything that I want to say-- here it is. Send me

	After reading this piece, I was *amazed* at the lengths to which
the Prohibitionists continue to lie. I really shouldn't be amazed, but I
was.  The pieces you gave me provided absolutely *no* references so that
I may check out their claims to see how valid they were. Because they
didn't tell me exactly which studies they were describing, I am unable
to look at the exact study, and see if the study was done impartially.
	When I say things, I *will* provide references, so that if you
doubt anything that I say, you can check it for yourself and not that
what I am saying is true. Some things I will say are merely guesses, but
I will clearly mark that which I am guessing and the solid facts. This
will be in sharp contrast the the materials you gave me. My facts will
have evidence to back them up.
	With regard the PRIDE surveys, and having had the "pleasure" of
taking one of these, I must say that they are not very good. I don't
have the survey at hand, so that I may criticize it in full (If you have
a copy of one, I would appreciate it if you could show it to me) but I
remember a few things. The survey has one classification "LSD, PCP, and
other hallucinogens." This classification is misleading, because LSD and
PCP are incredibly different drugs. LSD is a psychedelic
(mind-manifesting) drug, while PCP is merely a disassociative
anesthetic. The term "hallucinogens" is very vague, as any drug, taken
to huge dosages, can produce hallucinations. The difference between
"hallucinations" produced by psychedelic drugs and those produced by
large doses of alcohol or opiates, is that the alcohol/opiate
hallucinations are because the user's body is dying. The hallucinations
from psychedelic drugs (LSD, DMT, etc.) are a direct result of the
drug's interactions with the brain's neurotransmitters.
	The survey also lists a "continuum" of drug experiences. I don't
remember the exact details, but the marijuana pamphlet you gave me
mentioned the "very high, bombed, or stoned" characterization. Drugs are
different, and a cocaine experience cannot be classified along the same
continuum as a psychedelic experience.  Would Terrence McKenna's DMT
flash in the Amazon in which he used the I Ching to develop a fractal
map of novelty conservation in the world count as "very high, bombed, or
stoned," or would it count as a "buzz"? Where would the Massachussets
program which reduced the recidivism of inmates to a number near 3% lie?
(This program involved the legal administration of psilocybin or LSD, I
forget which, to Massachussets prison inmates by Dr. Timothy Leary so
that they may overcome their predisposition to violence.  This is
documented in Leary's autobiography, _Flashbacks_, and _Storming Heaven
: LSD and the American Dream_ by Jay Stevens.)
	I don't have an answer to every claim that pamphlet about
marijuana makes about marijuana. I am not all-encompassing. Note the
following quote from DEA Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Young:
marijuana is "one of the safest therapeutically active substances known
to man."
	I think that is about it for the preliminary comments. I am very
glad that you have given me this opportunity to tell you about my point
of view.	
	(Please excuse any typographical errors, I have an AP Lit.
presentation to write, an AP Lit. paper to write, AP Physics C homework,
AP Latin homework, and 2 college applications to finish.. I don't have
time to proofread.)

In a recent article, the Prohibitionists said:

	Surveys are inaccurate. As I said above, the PRIDE surveys have
a great deal of ambiguities and misconceptions. Surveys do not measure
much more than the *visibility* of drug use. While visibility of
marijuana use in 1979 was high, use was probably no different. President
Carter was in favor of decriminalization, saying that, "Penalites
against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an
individual than the use of the drug itself." (October 2, 1977: Source:
_PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story_, by Dr. Alexander T. Shulgin)

	Just one simple comment: The only lobbyists for marijuana
legislation *I* notice in the popular media are the ones in favor of
stricter regulations, drivers license suspensions, and other such
tryannical marijuana legislation.

>Thus, it is important for parents, educators, youth, and concerned

	Just because it is classified as something doesn't mean it is.
Marijuana is "classified" under the Controlled Substances Act under
Schedule I: "no medical use", but marijuana is useful as an
anti-convulsant, an analgesic, and muscle relaxant. It has been used for
chronic bronchitis, tetanus, asthma, glaucoma, postpartum psychosis,
appetite stimulation, migraine headaches, and opiate withdrawal.
(Source: _Marihuana Reconsidered_ by Dr. Lester Grinspoon, M.D., 1978.)

>CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE CRUDE DRUG
>
>While marijuana marketeers promote the drug as a "natural organic

	True, but misleading. The 31 August 1990 issue of the magazine
Science notes that of the over 800 volatile chemical present in roasted
coffee, only 21 have actually been tested on animals, and 16 of these
cause cancer in rodents. Yet coffee remains legal and is generally
considered fairly safe. (Source: "Too Many Rodent Carcinogens:
Mitogenesis Increases Mutagenesis", Bruce N. Ames and Lois Swirsky.
_Science_. Vole 249, 31 August 1990, p. 971.)

>and metabolizes rapidly out of the body.) Like the banned pesticide DDT,
>which is also fat-soluble, cannabinoids accumulate in the body with
>repeated use. Delta-9-tetrahydracannabinol (THC) is the most potent
	This is also true but misleading. Cannabinoids are fat soluble
as are innumerable nutrients and, yes, some poisons like DDT. For
example, the essential nutrient, Vitamin A, is fat soluble. Thus, what
one could do, is say, "Like the essential Vitamin A, cannabinoids
accumulate in the body with repeated use." Sounds a bit different
doesn't it? (Source: _Marijuana and Health_, Institute of Medicine,
National Academy of Sciences, 1982. & "The A Team" in _Scientific
American_, VOl 264, No. 2, Feb. 1991, p. 16.)

	In fact, marijuana use does not create a tolerance, but a
sensitization. No one has found "evidence of pharmacological tolerance
in human beings at recreational doses; instead, it still seems that
experienced users are more sensitive to the desired effects at lower
doses." (Source: _Marihuana Reconsidered_, ibid. p. 381)

>experience withdrawal symptoms (irritability, restlessness, sweating,
>decreased appetite), and have difficulty stopping use. Because of the
	Dependency on marijuana is *highly* dependent on the individual.
Terrence McKenna, who used to smoke *many* joints per day, had no
trouble quitting his use of marijuana. In a study of Jamaican heavy
users, where marijuana use is socially acceptable, many users do not
become greatly upset when their supply is cut off, usually for economic
reasons. E.g. "When you don't have money, you don't buy it." (Source:
_Ganja in Jamaica_, by Vera Rubins and Lambros Comitas, 1976, p. 137.)

	A real world example of what can happen when marijuana is
readily available is Holland. The Dutch effectively decriminalized
marijuana in the 1970s. Since then, heroin and cocaine use have declined
substantially. Actual studies show that most hard drug "addicts" start
with alcohol and tobacco. (Source: "A Comparison of Marijuana Users and
Non-users" by Norman Zinberg and Andrew Weil (1971). "The Economics of
Legalizing Drugs" by Richard J. Dennis, _The Atlantic Monthly_, Vol 266,
No. 5, Nov 1990 p. 130.)  It is important to note that a correlation
does not mean causality. The person's marijuana use probably did not
*cause* them to try cocaine. The marijuana user who tries cocaine is
probably already predisposed to illegal drug use, and if marijuana were
unavailable, would use more often the more dangerous cocaine.

that the effects of marijuana are in any way similar to opiates, nor
does it mean that the effects of marijuana and opiates are in some way
"more severe" than alcohol just because they have natural receptors. 
Actually, the fact that alcohol does *not* have natural receptors *may*
mean that it more dangerous than marijuana and opiates, because it
affects the ENTIRE brain, and not just certain portions, but this is
just postulation.

	Not rarity. Absence. No one has *ever* died of a marijuana
overdose. Although the LD50/ED50 ratio (the ratio of lethal dosage to
intoxicating dosage) for alcohol varies from 4 to 1 and 10 to 1, in
order to die you would have to consume 40,000 times as much marijuana as
is needed to get "stoned." (Source: _Marihuana Reconsidered_, ibid. p.
227.)

>PROVOKER OF MENTAL ILLNESS

	Again, a correlation does not imply causality. In this case, it
is may be likely that a person likely to use marijuana is more likely to
have a mental disorder. Thus people who use marijuana may be more likely
to be schizophrenic merely because marijuana attracts schizophrenic
users. Although my reasoning for the results is postulation, there is
nothing said here which would mandate a causal relationship.

	Smoked marijuana *does* contain more carcinogens that tobacco,
but marijuana does not need to be smoked. "Brownie Mary", an 80-year old
woman, was arrested for giving marijuana brownies to AIDS patients.
(Marijuana is useful for treating the side effects of AIDS medication.)
Many people do not do this now because of the prohibitive cost. Under a
legal system, marijuana would be cheap enough to make brownies from. 
Totally non-carcinogenic cannabis drinks such as "bhang" would also be
economical under a legal system. Additionally, "water-bongs" and related
marijuana-smoking paraphenalia reduce the number of carcinogens in
marijuana smoke, but because of drug paraphenalia laws, they are
difficult to obtain.
	Marijuana additionally, unlike tobacco, dilates the bronchial
passages, making it a useful treatment for asthma and chronic
bronchitis. This bronchiodilation promotes the self-cleaning of the
lungs. And, because tobacco is so greatly addictive, a heavy tobacco
smoker consumes much more tobacco than a heavy marijuana smoker.

not been replicated in other studies. Testosterone levels vary widely
from day to day, and from hour to hour. It takes a *very* large decline
to affect sexual performance. (_Marihuana Reconsidered_, ibid. p. 388).

	The "amotivational syndrome" varies widely from user to user. In
Jamaican communities, they have found that ganja use actually
*motivates* the Jamaicans to work hard. "The major reason given for
_ganja_ use is the perceived stimulus to energy and work motivation. .
.'I get a strong sensation toward my work.' . . . Non-smokers have
attested to increased work drive among regular smokers." (Source: _Ganja
in Jamaica_, ibid. p. 131.)
	With regard to anecdotal evidence, I conducted a survey on the
Usenet electronic bulletin board alt.drugs with regard to marijuana use
and grades. The results of that survey are in _The Free Journal_ Volume
II, Issue 2.  The people surveyed were generally either honors students,
students attending highly competitive schools, or people with
highly-skilled jobs, usually in the real of computers. If you would like
to see the complete sample, please tell me. I will have to retrieve it
from the archive at the University of Washington.

From the article:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	Note: This survey was done informally.  No formal conclusions
should be made from this survey.  All results are merely anecdotal.

	Thirty-seven regular marijuana users were surveyed, in addition
to nine ex-users.  I asked them their average daily dosage of marijuana,
their self-opinion of their intelligence, their "success" in the
intellectual field, and what other mind-altering drugs they use.
	I found that the mean daily dosage in grammes (Some estimates
were made, such as 1 joint = .7075 grammes.) was 0.865 g/day, with a
standard deviation of 1.188.  (Approximately 1.22 joints/day)
	Nearly all of the respondents (87%) thought of their
intelligence as something above average.  No one considered themselves
below average.  Twenty-two people provided GPAs, and the mean was 3.695,
ranging from 2.900 to 3.980 at institutions such as Stanford and M.I.T.
where the highest possible GPA is 4.0 (Unlike Libertyville's 5.0
maximum). The standard deviation was .276.  Of the 19 replies with SAT
scores, the mean was 1359 with a standard deviation of 121.15.  The
scores ranged from 980 to 1570.
	Of the 8 moderate users within two standard deviations from the
mean of consumption the mean consumption was .850 g/day with a standard
deviation of .248.  The mean GPA was 3.30 with a standard deviation of
.245.
	Of the 32 light users below two standard deviations from the
mean, the mean consumption was .179 g/day with a standard deviation of
.153.  The mean GPA was 3.407 with a standard deviation of .386.
	Of the 6 heavy users above two standard deviations the mean
consumption was 3.805 g/day with a standard deviation of .654.  The mean
GPA was 3.450 with a standard deviation of .636.
	From these data, it could be inferred that among the people
surveyed marijuana had no effect on ability to do well in school.  The
light and heavy users had only an insignificant increase in GPA above
the moderate users.
	Of the respondents, 65% have used LSD, 30% have used psilocybin,
50% have used alcohol, 13% have used caffeine, 11% have used nicotine,
4.3% have used opium, 4.3% have used speed, 2.2% have used amanita
muscaria, 2.2% have used dativa, 2.2% have used diprenhydramine
hydrochloride, 10.8% have used xtc, 4.3% have used amphetamines, 4.3%
have used nootropics, 4.3% have used nitrous oxide, 2.2% have used
valium, 2.2% have used kava, 2.2% have used MDA, and 2.2% have used
cocaine.
	Here are some comments from the replies which I have found to be
a good cross-section of the people.  (If you want a completely accurate
view you will have to look at the entire sample, which is available from
Sameer Parekh.)

Comments
	"I think regular marijuana use is detrimental to schoolwork
(from personal experience), but I don't believe it's made much
difference in my professional life (if this is hypocritical, so be
it!)."
	"My grades have improved tremendously since that time when I was
the really gifted kid who didn't work up to potential.  I have learned
that there are many rewards for postponing self-gratification until
after the work is done, and I think that marijuana has helped me learn
that."
	"The only negatives that it has produced in my life are the fear
of governmental retribution for my personal action, and lack of
understanding of people who feel my action is 'bad.'"
	"Good luck, but I must agree with other reservations about the

	Some logic here is a non-sequitor. The fact that they beleived
that they weren't impaired means that they *were* impaired? It makes no
sense. What should be done is impairment testing-- before each flight
the pilot must be put through a short test in which he must make quick,
stressful decisions. If the answers are not quick enough or bad, then
the pilot would not fly that day. This set-up would also protect
travellers from fatigued, angry and otherwise impaired pilots as well.

	If a person tests positive for marijuana, it does not mean that
they are intoxicated. As this pamphlet says, marijuana can be detected
in the urine for 14 days, and a sober driver may still test positive for
marijuana. Marijuana is involved in relatively as many accidents as
alcohol (relative to the number of users in the general population). It
was also noted, however, than in 85% of the accidents in which marijuana
was involved, alcohol was also involved. For people intoxicated solely
on marijuana, the accident rate was *much* lower. This implies that
marijuana poses less of a danger to driving than alcohol. (Source: Dale
Gieringer, "Marijuana, Driving, and Accident Safety," _Journal of
Psychoactive Drugs_, ibid.)
	I do beleive that driving while impaired laws for alcohol should
also apply to marijuana. Someone dumb enough to operate a deadly machine
while intoxicated, tired, angry, or otherwise impaired deserves to be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

needed is to use some farmland to grow the hemp, and clearcutting of
forests can be decreased dramatically.

	This second article fails to make a distinction between
different kinds of drugs. It pretends that marijuana is as dangerous as
cocaine, or even tobacco and alcohol. There are two methods of
classifying drugs which I find useful.
	One method is the body/mind drug division. Body drugs are those
which appeal to the body: relaxants and stimulants such as caffeine,
speed, alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and heroin. These drugs appeal to the
terrestrial circuits of the human psyche. The "mind" drugs are drugs
which appeal to the senses or creative centers of the mind, such as
marijuana, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and most other psychedelics. This division is
based mostly upon effects.
	The second method is the hard/soft division which is most
popular. Hard drugs are the drugs which hurt the body extensively, such
as tobacco, alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and speed. Soft drugs are not as
dangerous to the body, but they may have psychological dangers. These
include marijuana, the psychedelics, caffeine (which *is* bad for the
body, but not *very* dangerous.), and others.
	Using these categories, it is much easier to have a rational
attitude about these drugs, based on their risks, dangers, and benefits.

	It would be hard to find an organ or a system in the body that
is not damaged by legal drugs. I'm not limiting myself to just alcohol
and tobacco when I say legal drugs-- I include drugs such as caffeine,
acetaminophen, ephedrine, and other over-the-counter and prescription
drugs.
	All drugs have a danger. High doses of Tylenol can cause a heart
attack. (I think.) Moderate doses of Tylenol ease the pain of headaches
and help ease fever symptoms. Antihistamines induce drowsiness which is
incredibly dangerous if a person has to drive or operate other heavy
machinery. Used properly, however, they can help ease the symptoms of
the common cold. Ephedrine (synthetic adrelalin) can cause a heart
attack in high doses, but used properly, is a very valuable
bronchiodilator for asthmatics. LSD has the potential to release a
latent psychosis in a person, yet it can also be used to cure
alcoholics, adjust convicts to life outside prison, and it can also help
in psychotherapy. (Source: _Storming Heaven_, ibid.) MDMA, in high
dosages, deteriorates the axons in the brain, but used with moderation,
is a valuable tool in psychotherapy, as it allows the patient to open up
to his/her therapist. (Although listed as Schedule I in the United
States, it is being used successfully in Western Europe for
psychotherapy.) (Source: _The MDMA Story_, by Bruce Eisner)

A quote from a friend of mine:
------------------------------
"Ha!  This is called 'getting to know yourself'.  And let's not confine the
emotions to anger, fear and paranoia, but let's include love, contentness,
happiness.  People are changed?  Very possibly: metaprogramming?  This is
ridiculous.  People feel emotions they have not felt.  I went to a
high-school football game and felt emotions I had never felt, simply bound
up in the group mentality and cheering and all.  Emotions we have had to
keep in check?  *That* sounds dangerous to me.  Bottling something up may
cause explosions."

that most illicit drugs. One need not just look at deaths per year. One
can look at deaths per year *PER USER*. Even if usage went up (which it
probably won't) the deaths per year *PER USER* will not change. This
number is a rather reliable measure of drug danger, in my opinion.  From

	Table 4 presents the estimated per capita death rates for each
drug. (While a number of people have died as a result of marijuana
_enforcement_, there are apparently no confirmed deaths traceable to
marijuana use.) The figures for cocaine and heroin have been adjusted
downward, in accordance with the previous analysis, to include only
those deaths due to drug use per se. The unadjusted death rate for these
drugs is in parentheses.

strength and toxic reactions and infections due to uncontrolled black

	"repeatedly rejected"? What does that mean? Is that another one
of those arguments saying, "People are against it, so obviously it's a
bad idea"?  Like I said, in ante-bellum South, the majority of the
people thought that Blacks were less than human. It doesn't mean that
they were right.

	If they take great pains to protect the public, they would ban
alcohol and tobacco. But it has been established that Prohibition of
alcohol in the 1920's did *not* work. Ann Landers agrees that
Prohibition of alcohol in the 1920's did not work and that the solution
is education. The government doesn't make tobacco illegal because it
would cause "unemployment" of tobacco farmers. They give subsidies to
farmers and tax the users. That defies all logic, for the money then
goes in a circle.

>useful drugs are tested for years before they are allowed on the market,
	By testing these medicines for years, more people die from not
having access to potentially life-saving drugs than would be saved from
a deadly drug entering the market. We *know* that people will die from
the disease, and they have a chance to either live or be killed from the
drug. "Delays on Propranolol, used to treat angina and hypertension,
resulted in at least 30,000 avoidable American deaths a year during the
period the FDA blocked its entry." (Source: "We *Can* Have Affordable
Health Care" by Vincent H. Miller & Jarret B. Wollstein.)

	I already talked about the medical uses of marijuana. I talked a
little bit about the psychiatric uses of LSD, also. Cocaine is legally
available as a prescription medicine, and is used rarely as an
anesthetic. (It is listed in Schedule II, which means that the
prescription needs to be in triplicate and other paperwork has to be
filled out. Even for *research* to be done on a Schedule I drug, you
need special permission from the DEA.)
	I think that PCP is used as an anesthetic in veterinary
medicine. (I could be mistaken.)

rate had been declining, but with the event of the new wave of drug
laws, violent crimes have increased sharply -- 32% between 1976 and
1985. (Source: "Ending Our Drug Nightmare" by Jarret Wollstein)
	Drug laws produce a black market. A black market means high
prices. High prices mean that people have to steal and prostitute
themselve to afford to buy the drugs. High prices mean high profits.
High profits mean the drug dealers can afford to buy guns. Guns in the
hands of drug dealers mean violence.

	If cocaine were legal, people would probably not use crack. It
is the same situation with alcohol Prohibition. During the Prohibition
of alcohol, people started using stronger alcohol products because it
was illegal and they wanted "more bang for the buck." With cocaine
illegal, people turn to crack, because *it* provides "more bang for the
buck." (And more danger.) With a legal system, I would not find it
surprising if people began to turn from crack to cocaine, and maybe from
cocaine to chewing coca leaves, a much safer form of ingesting the drug
than the purified chemical. This would be possible because of the
economics. Under a legal system, using coca leaves would be economically
feasible. Most drug-enforcement officials' goals are not to "eradicate"
the drugs, but to raise the prices. This escalation of price hurts
innocent people who get shot by stray bullets, it hurts Colombian judges
who get killed by rich drug lords, it corrupts law enforcement officials
because the drug dealers can afford to pay for huge bribes, and it hurts
the addict, because he/she must steal or prostitute himself to pay for
the drug. (Source: _A Weekend with Terrence McKenna_, speeches by
Terrence McKenna given at Esalen Institute.)
	By raising the price of heroin from five cents to five dollars,
the only result is that the addict must steal (or even kill) in order to
get the drugs. (_Licit & Illicit Drugs_, ibid. p. 522.)

Drugs would be available at your corner pharmacy, and there is no motive
for a corner pharmacy to push drugs on youngsters. Does the corner
pharmacy push _alcohol_ on youngsters? No. Young people do buy alcohol,
but they don't go through black market channels to buy it, they go to
the corner liquor store and lie about their age.

>In the final analysis, legalization is wrong because drugs are wrong
	It is amazing that a species of plant can be "wrong."
	"Wrong" is subjective. Morality cannot be legislated. One
religion may state that bisexuality is immoral, yet another may mandate
bisexuality. (A few Native American religions had bisexual rites of
maturation.) If person A thinks being bisexual is immoral, he has no
right to stop person B from following the dictates of his religion.
	With the drug issue, the Native American Church uses peyote
(which contains mescaline) as a sacrament. By banning their use of
peyote, the government is trampling on the religious freedoms of this
country's native peoples.

	Laws were not devised to "send messages." Laws exist so that
people may co-exist in harmony without hurting each other. Devices such
as television, radio, and the newspapers are the proper media which the
government should use in order to make it's statements that it is not
acceptable to ruin one's mind an body.

>other countries have tried legalization and that policy has failed.
	There is a fundamental difference between legalization and
decriminalization, which happened in Holland. Decriminalization
maintains the black market because it does not make selling the drugs
legal, it only makes possession legal. In Amsterdam, marijuana is
effectively legal, and there are few problems with marijuana. In fact,
after marijuana was made easily available, heroin use went down
substantially. (As I stated above.)

increase. There *is* evidence that the number of users will go down.
(The situation in Amsterdam..) It is often the laws themselves which
create the widespread drug use.
	LSD's popularization was intensified by a wave of prohibitive
legislation. Many cases in which people claimed to have killed people or
jumped off of buildings while using LSD were not true. After the
anti-LSD laws were passed, LSD availability increased and LSD demand
increased. (Source: _Licit & Illicit Drugs_, ibid. pp. 370-2).

	It has often been part of the American government to smuggle
and deal in illegal drugs. When the CIA was aiding the Afghan rebels
during the Soviet occupation, they established a hashish-smuggling ring
in order to fund the activities of the rebels. The period when the
Soviets were in Afghanistan provided hash users in the United States a
very rich supply of very-strong Afghani hash.  When the Soviets pulled
out of Afghanistan, the CIA staged an elaborate "bust" in order to close
up the Afghani smuggling operation. (Source: _A Weekend with Terrence
McKenna_, ibid.)
	It is rumored that George Bush orchestrated a cocaine smuggling
operation in order to fund military aid to some of his allies. Noriega,
the famous drug trafficker, was put in power under the auspices of the
United States CIA, which as I have stated in the last paragraph, uses
drug smuggling to fund many of its operations.
	The major reason why drugs are illegal in the United States is
not danger, nor is it public opinion. In the late 1970's, public opinion
was in favor of legalization. The Reagan/Bush years, with their
misinformation campaigns, have managed to reverse that opinion. They
wanted to keep drugs illegal because it is in their best interests to do
so.
	Under an illegal system, the government has an excuse for
limiting free speech, taking completely innocent people's property
without a trial, shooting people for possession of *one* joint, and
spending more money on the nation's police and military forces. The
government's covert operations agencies such as the CIA have drug
smuggling as an easy way to earn a great deal of money from the
illegality of the drug trade. Under a legal system the CIA would not
earn so much money smuggling drugs. The money the CIA earns from drug
smuggling would be a "blank check" for the CIA--they can use it however
they want, without the supervision of Congress, because Congress knows
nothing of it.

>USE OF ILLICIT DRUGS MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED A VICTIMLESS CRIME 
> 
	The last section merely says how the *black-market* causes all
these problems. It does not say that the drugs are that which creates
the problems. Making drugs illegal is a crime which created the black
market and all the deaths from unregulated drug supply, drive-by
shootings, and other "drug-related" (in fact, "black-market related")
crime.
	By raising the prices of these drugs the DEA is the group
responsible for the violence. William Bennet was proud when he said, "We
have raised the price of and ounce of pot past the price of an ounce of
gold!" In doing so, the DEA is responsible for the violence which is
tearing apart the inner-cities.

>All citizens must speak out against the common myth that illicit drug 
>use is a victimless crime. The victims of drug use are everywhere;
>residents of drug-infested neighborhoods, citizens against whom criminal
>acts are perpetrated by users and traffickers, the business community, 
>and society at large through taxes supporting prisons, law enforcement, 
>medical services, and increased insurance rates.
	These victims of "drug use" are in fact victims of drug
prohibition. Like I said before with legalization, addicts wouldn't
steal from innocent people because they would be able to afford the drug
without stealing. Taxpayers wouldn't have to pay for the huge prison
costs if drugs were legal, because the users would not be in prison. 60%
(Source: _A Weekend with Terrence McKenna_, ibid.) of all drug-offenders
in prison are in there because of marijuana, a drug safer than aspirin.
	Other victims of drug laws are rape victims and murder victims
of rapists and murderers released from prison. Because of mandatory
sentencing laws, people who sell marijuana, one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man, must stay in jail for
maybe seven years *at a minimum* and rapists and murderers are set free
on parole to ease up the prison crowding.

	Legalization would eliminate the profits which have attracted
the most violent criminals to the trade.

>lives to protect us in our homes and in our communities. 
	Drug cartels would not exist in a legal system. Coca leaves
could be purchased by a reputable pharmaceutical company such as Baxter,
and Baxter would never have a motive to kill a foreign leader. Elderly
people and innocent children would not be caught in the crossfire of
rival drug gangs, because drugs would be sold at pharmacies. When was
the last time there was a shootout between alcohol-sellers over turf?
During the Prohibition of alcohol.

>We must be as adamant about "casual" users as we are about addicts. And 
>whereas addicts may also deserve your help, "casual" users deserve our

>and corruption which they help finance.

	My final point: The only way to stop the war in our cities is to
remove the high profits from the illegal drug trade. To remove the high
profits drugs should be legal. That way innocent people do not die from
crossfire, drive-by shootings, turf wars, and muggings from people who
have to pay prohibitive costs for illegal drugs.
	Thank you for reading my points. I respect you a great deal for
showing interest in my viewpoint. I hope you will take these points into
consideration when you think about issues in the future. Thank you.
