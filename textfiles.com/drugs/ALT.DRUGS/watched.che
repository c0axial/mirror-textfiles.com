This is from Psychedelic Chemistry by Michael Valentine Smith.  Available 
from Loompanics Unlimited, PO Box 1197, Port Townsend, WA 98368 USA.  A
catalog of books is available for $3.00.  I'm fairly impressed with this
book because it documents most sources -- journal articles and patents.

Also, in the front of the book there appears this note:

  Orders for certain chemicals used to make psychedelics (especially
large orders in suspect areas) are sometimes checked by narcs.  Indole,
lithium aluminum hydride, trimethoxybenzaldehyde, phenyl-2-propanol,
diethylamine, olivetol and ergotamine are among those watched.  The vast
majority of the homologs and analogs described here are, however, legal
to manufacture and use.
  [not sure if this last statement is accurate after the Designer Drug laws]
  For lists of proscribed drugs, see the Code of Federal Regulations 21:
part 300 to end, the U.S. Pharmacoepoeia 19:690 or write to the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, Dept of Justice, 1405 1st St. N.W., Washington
D.C. 20537.  There are also state laws to contend with.
  A current list of DEA watched chemicals appears in the back of this book.

The copywrite date on the book is 1981, and naturally I didn't get permission
to reprint this and will burn in hell forever.  Spelling errors are also
probably mine and I expect them to lengthen my stay in copywrite purgatory...

Its more difficult than that.  The DEA has three tiers of observation when
it comes to chemicals.  First tier is the actual illegal drugs, which can be
bought from chemical supply companies (for biochem and chem research).
These are watched very carefully, with the research groups being subjected
to rigourous security checks, and all material has to be accounted for.
Second tier is chemicals that are direct precursors to illegal chemicals, or
combinations of chemicals that can be used to manufacture illegal chemicals.
These are watched closely, and will merit detailed survelliance if not
ordered by reputable research groups or companies.  The third tier are all
other chemicals not commonly found in public.  The DEA watches all
individuals that order chemicals very closely, so expect to be questioned
and required to account for what you ordered, legally.  Many chemical supply
companies will not ship chemicals to individuals.

Even creating a front company works only some of the time, if the chemicals
you order are not obviously usfull for drug (or explosives) manufacture.
Often illegal labs use three or more front companies to avoid detection (and
a large number get busted anyway).

To answer your question: which chemicals are DEA watched?  All of them!

        Well, here's the complete list of controlled substances
as contained in the 1992 Sigma catalog.  I'm not a chemist, so I
can only accept responsibility for transcription errors.  Net
chemists please check this over and comment.
        In general, 'a' means 'alpha', 'B' means capital 'beta',
and 'd' means 'delta', while 'delta' means capital 'delta'.  'D'
and 'L' mean 'dextro' and 'levo'.  Read the list and you'll know
what I mean.
        I haven't checked this against any other lists of controlled
or watched chemicals, and I can't guarantee that this is a complete
list or a completely accurate one.  However, there has been discussion
along this line in alt.drugs and I thought I would offer this as a
start at least.  Alt.drug gurus: should/could this be placed in an
anonymous ftp depository?
