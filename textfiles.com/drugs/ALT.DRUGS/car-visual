My first trip was the best I've ever had. I dropped at 11:30pm. I started
noticing a change at around 12am. I was standing in 7-11, kinda disoriented.
I turned around and it hit me. The room strated shifting, and the shelves
started beding. 3 of us were tripping. All I remember is that whenever we
wanted to light a cigarette, we'd ask for a light, start laughing and
remember about 1/2 later that we were holding an un lit cigarette. Adam and I
were sitting outside behind a car. the car was on the right side curb. A car
rolls by and he says it's a cop and runs away. I was left sitting there
alone. Now I heard the car, saw the lights, but I didn't exactly see the car.
When I got up to run away. Everything stopped. The sounds went away, and the
lights went away to. I tell thats the biggest most life-like trip/visual I've
ever had.        Love Nico Blue@}--->-------
