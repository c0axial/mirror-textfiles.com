DRUG RELATED NEWSGROUPS

NOTE:  If you do not have one of these newsgroups on your list, you should
       send a polite letter to your system administrator asking the newsgroup
       be added.  Please use these newsgroups to cut down on cross-posting
       and to seperate traffic.  Please do not mass cross-post.

alt.drugs

  This is the catch-all newsgroup.  This doesn't, however, mean you should
  cross-post every single article in any of the other alt.drugs.* groups
  here.  If it fits into another newsgroup, you should use the other
  newsgroup and not cross post.

alt.drugs.chemistry

  This group is for the discussion of the synthesis and extraction of
  psychoactives.  It does not include neuropharmacology questions which
  should go into alt.psychoactives

alt.drugs.culture

  This group is for trip stories, best music to listen to while stoned,
  other discussions of set + setting and in general the psychosocial aspects
  of the use of drugs.

alt.drugs.pot

  Growing tips go here and not in alt.hemp.  Stuff about hemp as rope,
  fuel, food, etc should go into alt.hemp.  On Usenet "Pot == you get stoned
  off of it, Hemp == you don't", apparently.

alt.drugs.psychedelics

  LSD, MDMA, DMT, Mushrooms, etc.  Probably Ketamine would be included
  in here as well.  Synthesis/extraction threads would be better placed
  in alt.drugs.chemistry.

alt.hemp

  For the *alternative* uses of marijuana.  We're talking rope, fuel, food,
  and other uses of help.  If it has anything to do with marijuana as a
  drug it should be in alt.drugs.pot

alt.psychoactives

  This group is for the discussion of nootropics ("Smart Drugs") and
  for the neuropharmacology of drugs.  It should not have threads about
  psychedelics (unrelated to neuropharmacology) or threads about
  antidepressants (unrelated to neuropharmacology) on it.  And under
  most circumstances questions which might seem to require some
  degree of neuropharmacology to answer would probably be best left
  in other newsgroups -- i.e. "What happens if i mix Prozac and LSD?"
  should probably go in alt.drugs.psychedelics (and/or
  sci.med.psychobiology).  On the other hand, discussion of neuropharmacology
  of all drugs are encouraged.  If you'd like to know what receptors LSD
  binds to, or how MDMA causes the release of serotonin this is the place
  to go...

talk.politics.drugs

  Political discussion should, in theory, wind up here rather than in
  alt.drugs.

sci.med.pharmacy

  Discussion of legal, medicinal drugs.  Questions about antibiotics, etc
  should go here

sci.med.psychobiology

  Discussion of legal, medicinal, psychoactive drugs.  Questions about
  Prozac, Zoloft, Ativan, Valium, Buspirone, etc should all typically
  go in here unless it has to do with getting high off the drug or
  mixing the drug with an illegal psychoactive.
