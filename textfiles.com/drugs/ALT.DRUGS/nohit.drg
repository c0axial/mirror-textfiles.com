You may have heard about "no-hitter" that Bob Milacki's of the Oakland A's
pitched last week.  No-hitters are pretty rare and this one made the
news everywhere.  One of the local TV stations refered to it as
Milacki's "no-no," a term that originated with Dock Ellis's no-hitter
back on June 20th, 1970 for the Pirates.

  Dock pitched that game on acid.  That fact didn't come out until almost
  15 years later.  Here are some interesting excerpts from Eric Brothers
  account of the game in the August 1987 issue of High Times magazine:

  "Dock woke up late.  Why shouldn't he?  As far as he knew, the team had
  an off day and he planned to take full advantage of it.  Three hits of
  LSD were ready and waiting in the refrigerator.

  "A few minutes later, his girlfriend returned with coffee, donuts, and
  the morning paper.  At noon, they dropped acid.  Dock put on a record,
  while his girlfriend read the paper.

  "Dock, it says here you're pitching today!"

  "Whaaaa...?  said Dock groggily.  He snatched the paper, scanned the box
  scores, and read:

  	  PITTSBURGH AT PADRES
  	     DOUBLEHEADER
  	(6 P.M.) - Ellis (4-4) vs.
  	     Roberts (3-3)

  [He makes it to the game and after having someone help him find his
  locker, he suits up and enters the game.]

  "Dave Roberts, the Padres' pitcher, had an easy first inning, ending
  with Roberto Clemente hitting one back to the box.  Dock marched to the
  mound, wondering if he'd last the inning.

  "His fingers tingled as he squeezed the ball.  He squinted to see
  catcher Jerry May's hand signals.  He nodded his head and went into his
  windup, falling slightly off balance in the process.  The ball hit the
  ground about two feet in front of the plate and skipped into May's
  glove.

  "May signaled for a fastball outside.  Dock wound up and threw a hot one
  over the the corner of the plate - a swinging strike!  In was no
  ordinary pitch:  The ball burst from Dock's hand and left a blazing,
  cometlike tail that remained visible long after the ball was caught.

  "Dock felt wobbly on the mound and his stomach was churning with acid
  cramps.  His concentration, however, was superb.  As long as he kept to
  his fastball, the comets kept burning across the plate.  All he had to
  do was steer the ball down the multicolored path.  Dock had a crazed
  look in his eyes and his lack of control was evident to the batters,
  many of whom were feeling increasingly vulnerable in the batter's box.
  Dock easily retired three batters in a row [in the second inning].

  [the seventh inning:]

  "The Pirates were clinging to their 1-0 lead.  Dock was staring at the
  scoreboard when he realized he'd pitched hitless ball for seven innings.
  He smacked Cash on the arm.

  "Hey, look," said Dock, pointing at the scoreboard.  "I've got a no-no
  going!"

  Cash gave him a blank look.  "A no-no?" asked Cash.  He'd never heard
  the term before.  But Cash wanted to keep the pitcher loose and happy,
  so he smiled and said nothing.

  [He finished the game without a hit.]

  (Dock had a pretty good year in 1970.  He went 13-10, and helped the
  Pirates win their first of three divisional championships.  The fact
  that he pitched his no-hitter on LSD was not revealed until April 8,
  1984. [no details given])
