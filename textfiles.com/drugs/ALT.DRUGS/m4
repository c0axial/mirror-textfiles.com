> what is 'hash oil'? 

Its a thick black oil made from hash.  The hash is heated and pressed to 
release the oil.  (Same process used to make hash from marijuana, but carried
to an extreme.)  Its almost like a tar; very sticky, very thick.

> how is it used?

I've never seen it in the US, but When I lived in England, some 10 years ago,
it was occasionally available.  It came in two forms; sometimes it would be
in a little plastic vial.  Other times it would come in a piece of aluminum
foil.  From what I recall, the point was not to burn it, as that would burn
off the active ingredients; but you wanted to inhale the vapor from it.

The usual procedure was to get some heat resistant tube; the favorite was a
the clear plastic tube that is the body of a bic disposable pen.  Pull out the
end cap, and pull out the ink/ballpoint thingy.  Result: a clear plastic tube.
Then, smear a small amount of the oil on a piece of aluminum foil.  Hold the
foil with pliers.  With the oil on top, heat from beneath with a lighter.
Hold the end of the tube above the patch of oil.  As you begin to apply heat,
suck like hell.  The pliers (or something) are necessary because foil is
an excellent conductor of heat, and you can burn yourself.  It may take
several heatings to use up all the oil from a smear.  (You'll note this takes
three hands!)

For a nicer piece of equipment, take an old tablespoon.  Bend the handle so
that the handle bends away from the bowl, and then back so that it is pointing
up away from the bowl.  Attach same pen tube to the handle so that it points
down into the bowl of the spoon.  Smear oil into bowl of spoon, and heat
spoon from bottom. (This only takes two hands.)

Another technique, if you roll your own cigarettes, is to smear a streak of
oil on a cigarette paper, and then roll a cigarette with this paper.

I grew up in England, and when I was in high school (pun intended? ;-) there,
all we could ever get was hash.  For some peculiar reason, no one ever thought
to use pipes.  So we had to roll cigarettes with roll-your-own tobacco, and
put crumbs of hash in them.  Sometimes, to avoid the tobacco, we'd use
disassembled clove cigarettes, or herbs like tarragon.

If you've never used hash, (which I've never seen in the US,) it comes as a
brown-green brick, which is VERY hard.  You warm a corner over a lighter to
soften it, and break crumbs off of it.  You can't roll j's with this stuff; its
solid.  (Sometimes, good stuff is very dark in color, even black; this is
usually very soft, and if squeezed, drops of hash oil may sweat out.)

I don't seem to recall it being very common to find head shops where you could
buy smoking equipment proper, but tobacco and rolling papers were very common.
I don't think equipment was common, because I do remember a couple of pieces
of homemade equipment; one friend of mine made a bong in his ceramics class.  I
made one with a thistle tube, cork, glass tubing, and erlenmeyer flask from
a chemistry set of mine.

No, make that very, Very, VERY sticky.  Sticks to everything.  stays under
your fingernails for weeks after you've tried everything imaginable to get
it out (and you try everything imaginable because the milligram or so that's
stuck there is worth some money).  It ruins clothes; the only thing that
will take it off your skin or countertops is denatured alcohol or a similar
solvent.  The stickiest shit I have ever seen.

>> how is it [hash oil] used?

It turns up at dead shows occasionally.  A "friend" had some that came from
jamaica, which is where he assumes it was made.

"friend" says the smoke is better than the vapor.

Don't use a ballpoint pen unless you like to waste money (oil, same
difference).  This stuff costs a fortune--"friend" says $35/gram when you can
get it.  It's really not worth it at that price.  Anyway, as far as heating it
vs. warming it, "friend" says he's tried it both ways.  Both ways it's real,
real hard on your throat (worse than the harshest weed--almost as bad as that
"black morrocan" lettuce O shit).  It's a little harsher if you do the vapor
thing.  "friend" says seems to be more effective smoked, plus you waste less.

best vapor method:  put an old knife on a stove burner ("friend" used an
electric stove; use a gas job at your own risk).  let it get nice and hot (red
hot isn't too hot, but of course you don't wanna deform the knife...).  Get a
paper towell tube or similar-size tube.  GATHER EVERYONE AROUND CLOSE.  use a
real thin screwdriver or similar instrument to get a little dab of oil, stand
ready with the tube, press the screwdriver against the hot blade and suck.
don't take too much; it's got incredible expando properties.  The stuff will
smoke uncontrollably till it's gone, so make sure everyone gets in their suck
without letting too much go to waste (it's good if everyone has their own
tube). 

The aluminum foil method is okay, but "friend" thinks it's a little more
wasteful.  Eventually ya gotta throw that foil out.

"friend" says best way to do it is to roll it with some herb (tobacco kills).
Another good way to smoke it (according to friend) is to line a screened bowl
with rolling paper or leaf and put a drop in there.

However you do it, take SMALL hits.  the shit is lethal on your lungs.

Actually, now that friend thinks about it, the best way to do it is to put
about 10 grams in a 13x7" brownie pan with your favorite brownie recipe.  cut
into ~1.25" squares.  Eat one and have a wonderful night (sex is highly
recommended).  Eat two and become part of your favorite couch for 5 hours or
so.  Eat 5 or 6 and find out what heroin's like without having to mess with
needles. 

Of course $350 is a hell of an expensive pan of brownies.

>I always found that hash oil was much stonier than hash. (Whatever that
>means.....)  It gave me more of that feeling in my eyes of being in a smoky
>room when I was stoned on plain hash or mj leaves.

friend likes good hash better.  Easier to smoke, tastes better.  Right about
the buzz tho.  VERY intensly relaxing, almost paralyzing.

>Of course, this was all long ago, and I don't do that sort of thing anymore....

Of course, neither does friend.
:^)

A word of advice (from friend):  BE CAREFUL when buying this shit.  It's real,
real easy to get ripped off, and doling out $35 for a gram of roofing tar is
quite a bummer.

Is hash oil mentioned in a faq?  I'm too lazy to look.  If it's not it should
be. 

Oh, friend tells me to add one more thing: heating up the vial will make the
stuff a lot easier to deal with (liquifies it).  Also makes it more prone to
spillage, so take great care when handling it in its liquid form.  You can
heat the vial with a lighter or put it on an electric stove burner.

God, my friend is such a drug-craving unAmerican lowlife.:^)

 Use acetone instead of alcohol. THC is SUPER soluble in acetone - soak
 the ground-up leaves in acetone, then distill it off. best purity from
 any solvent I've ever tried. Next best choice is petroleum ether. Seriously,
 alcohols are too H2O - soluble for really good purity - lots of other
 nonpsychoactive stuff gets in the oil.

  P.S. once you've got the oil, it's REALLY sticky & hard to handle. mix with
  2 parts powdered leaf to form good hash.

   you're welcome.

Subject: THC extraction

Just for fun.  Here are some exerpts from the Experimental section of
a paper by Adams, Hunt, and Clark, JACS 62, 196 (1940).

    The hemp used in these experiments grew wild in Minnesota during
    the season of 1938.  It was cut in August, after flowering had
    begun but before seed had "set" in the female tops.  It was stored
    for six weeks in a room where a fan assured circulation of air in
    order to dry it completely.  No molding occurred.  The material
    was then beaten and shaken to remove the coarse stems which ammount-
    ed to about one-third of the total dry weight.  The stems were dis-
    carded and the relatively fine material that remained was extracted
    with 95% ethanol [equivalent to Everclear] in the manner described
    below.

    Four 20-gallon (75-liter) crocks, each holding approximately 23 lb.
    (10 kg.) of material, were set up in series for countercurrent
    extraction.  Each crock held approximately 61 liters of solvent of
    which about 41 liters were withdrawn at each transfer, the remain-
    der being retained by the hemp.
    ...
    The operations just described were carried out by Dr. John R. Matchett
    and his assistants in the Narcotics Laboratory of the Treasury
    Department, Washington, D.C.  They kindly furnished us with a gener-
    ous supply of ethanol extract. [don't you wish you had connections
    like that?]

The rest of the procedure involved removing ethanol and low boiling
components under reduced pressure (about 30 mm) and gradually increased
temperature (up to 200 C).  The remaining oil was distilled at 3 mm,
between 100-220 C.  This crude oil (180-200 g) was disolved in petroleum
ether (b.p. 30-60 C) and washed twice with water.  The pet. ether was
distilled off and the oil distilled at 2 mm, collecting the fraction
boiling at 175-195 C, yielding 90-110 g of "purified red oil."

So that's how the big boys did it back then.  University of Illinois
students and alums should note that the author Adams is none other than
Roger Adams for whom the chem lab is named.

At the time this paper was written it wasn't known just what the active
ingredient in pot was.  Cannabinol was the first compound identified in
red oil, and cannabidiol had just recently been isolated.  From the
conclusion of the introduction:

    Red oil probably contains other products closely related to canna-
    binol or cannabidiol in structure, such as partially hydrogenated
    cannabinols, isomers of cannabidiol, or molecules like cannabidiol
    with less unsaturation.  A large number of closely related compounds
    is possible.  The active marihuana principle or principles may be
    among this group of substances.  On the other hand, the possibility
    of the presence in red oil of a very potent active compound, entirely
    unrelated structurally to cannabinol or cannibidiol, is not excluded.

Very soon after that is was determined that THC was the active principle.
Roger Adams synthesized THC and several related compounds, some of which
were several times more potent than THC.  Roger Adams has a number of
interesting papers, Joe Bob says "check it out."

I don't personally own these books; I just saw them in a "books by phone" 
catalog along with a bunch of other books--you know, Knuth's _Art of
Computer Programming_ volumes 1-3, Wirth's _Algorithms + Data Structures_...

_Cannabis Alchemy_, by Gold, 1990

Also, there was much discussion of "double boilers".  You use a double boiler
whenever you are trying to heat, and evaporate volatile liquids.  It should
be reasonably obvious that this is necessary to boil off the [acetone|alcohol|
isopropyl alcohol] which you would mix with the hash.  A double boiler is
simplely a large pot with water in it, which contains a smaller pot with the
"pot" in it.  The water in the large pot boils, heating the smaller pot but
never exceeding the temperature of the boiling point of water.  Thus, there is
a much smaller risk of blowing yourself up.  

When dealing with flammable liquids like these solvents, proper ventalation
is required, and flames are an absolutely contraindicated.  There is a stupid
text file running around the net on how to "make" Methamphetamine, which is
actually a procedure for extracting psudoephedrine.  One of the brilliant
suggestions by the authors of this article was to evaporate by placing a
solvent on a hot water heater.  This is dumb.  Real dumb.  Particularly if
you've got a gas hot water heater with a pilot light.  (Can you say "Kaboom"
boyz & girls?  I knew you could...).  Be a little careful.

I don't ever touch marijuana anymore, but I had to comment on the correct
method of smoking hash oil. When I was younger I had a girlfriend who lived
in Calumet, in a little house on the edge of town. Across the road was
an old tailings heap covered in long grass that waved in the wind. Anyway, 
she loved to drink ginger brandy and she loved to get high. She had some
hash oil that summer and we smoked it together. Actually, I had more fun 
smoking it being high afterward. It was really too strong. But the smoking
method was a kick, and it didn't waste any of the oil. 
    We would sit at her kitchen table and heat a small, thin glass pipe
with a crook in it, but no bowl (there had been a bowl once, but it had
broken off, and it was not needed for the method) and heat the lower part 
WITH A PROPANE TORCH. Once the glass was glowing red, one of us would 
dip a wire loop into the hash oil and apply it to the inside of the lower
extremity of the glass tube while the other person inhaled.
    The oil vaporized instantly, but some always precipitated on the inside
of the pipe. After a few hits, we would 'cook' the pipe with the torch along
its length to get this resin out. 
    I maintain that this method, as opposed to others described, is truly
efficient and easy--AND YOU GET TO WAVE A FLAMING PROPANE TORCH AROUND
WHILE GETTING UNREASONABLY HIGH!!

Subject: HASH EXPERIMENTATION

I read with interest a compilation of older net messages regarding the usage of
hash oil and hash block.
.
What I say here may not be 100% correct, but if not, I'm sure someone will
straighten me out a few points. Spelling etc etc etc is not my strong point, so
please bare with me.
.
If you have heard it all before, let me know! I'll keep my big trap shut next
tyme! Similarly, NZ supplies of things may be different from USA.
.
OIL.
.
Usually brought in capsules that used to contain prescription drugs. It is very
dark in colour (darker usually is the better quality) but has a slight
brown/green tinge to it depending on process used to make and the quality of
ingrediants.
.
It just so happens that this particular oddity is almost as common as grass in
New Zealand, and represents better value for money. The average J over here
would set you back $6 NZ - That's 1/3 of a B @ $20NZ. I have never payed more
than $40NZ. This represent a good deal of stoning, about double value for money
from the original green!
.
BLOCK.
.
This stuff is not as common as the above. Harder to make, and best made in
*large* quantities - Thus the home manufacturing idea goes out the window,
unless you are charging the earth.
.
Again, $30-40NZ for an average block, although occasionally one or two come
along a little more expensive. I think the expensive stuff (well... These are
street prices, so I know it's ALL looking expensive... Work out our exchange
rate by the way...) comes from inland resources, where as the cheap is Jamican
origin, or therabouts.
.
My prefered of the two? Well, let's just say that you loose $5 worth of hash
for ever $30 you manage to intake. You probably loose less (money speaking) of
oil than block. For that reason - OIL!
.
However, (oh gawd, here we go!) block is truley magnificient when dropping
shavings of the stuff straight onto an element. It isn't really a portable
drug, block, as it needs a lot of work to take.
.
CONSUMPTION.
.
Don't know about you guys, but we just use some sort of funnel placed over the
approx area of burning. Works fine, never bothered with anything more

just drop block onto it. For oil - Try a laying out some decent size spots (1x1
inch) and get all your mates around with straws!
