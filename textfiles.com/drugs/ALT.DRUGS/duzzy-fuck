here's the scenario....we were at the zoo and tripping like 
mother fuckers. we went to see the gophers because we like 
small furry creatures, and have you ever seen "12 monkeys"? 
because our lives were being ruled by these large fuzzy 
animals. fuzzy ducks is all we could think about. duzzy fuck? 
she's out like a peanut. a salty peanut. nope. don't smoke 
dope. you got a joint? nope. it be a lot cooler if you did. the 
screen saver rocked our world. can i tell you that the biggest 
houses in the world exist on big bend. especially when your 
tripping balls. gotta go get some midnight munchies. later 
days.
p.s. i'm sober. this i swear.
