	An arab confection containing mostly Hashish.  Theophile Gautier 
	mentions it in "Le Club des Hachichins".  By the way, a number
	of Gautier's works are available in english, I recommend them
	highly.  The folks who regularly read this group would like
	his works, Gauthier was rather fond of recreational pharmaceuticals
	it seems. ;-)

	Can't get it in Cairo without risk anymore. . . try Amsterdam
	the coffee houses should be able to set you up for illumination. ;-)
	But remember as ol' Theo would have said: "Ceci vous sera defalque 
	sur votre portion de paradis".
