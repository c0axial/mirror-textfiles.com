 I love painting on psychedelics.  Such a wonderful experience.The glowing color on the end of your brush. The way it coats the translucentcanvas. The textures, oh my, the textures. Not only are you aware of thetextures, you actually learn them. Of course, many times, Ill get up and do a jig.  Releasing any frustrationsand learning the solutions. When the going get jiddywedgidderti you gottaget perkalamentalatory.-- rec.drugs.psychedelic
