Report #B
A Report on The Use of Cannabis Hemp as a Source of
     Raw Materials in the Production of Paper:
American Grown Hemp Can Supply our Paper Needs.
          
      The Institute for Hemp has just completed this report on the use 
of hemp as a source of raw materials for the production of paper.  
This report also contains two additional sub-sections, one on the 
history of paper-making another on the cultivation and collection of 
hemp hurds. 
     
     
     The main part of the report draws conclusions from the study, 
conducted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture and published in 
Bulletin #404, and given current technology, cultivation techniques 
and production rates. 
     
     
     This report blows the lid of current paper making techniques.  
The report clearly shows that 1 acre of hemp will = 8.1  to 16.2 
acres of trees used for paper.  This report also shows how we can 
reduce the toxic emmissions from paper production techniques.
     
     
     This report is fully documented and resourced.  An average of 
4.1 footnotes per page makes this the most completey 
documented study on hemp as a source of paper ever conducted.

Yes, I caught, purely by the chance of flipping channels, the last 15 or 20 minutes.
I don't remember the guest's name offhand, but he is now working at CUNY Medical
School.  He gives a lot of lectures to groups of politicians and medical people
explaining his position.  WHat is his position?  Well, he spoke a lot about the
legalization of marijuana, though he does support legalization for ALL drugs
(with like an 18 year old age limit).  His reasons are basically the true and
reasonable reasons (goodbye objectivity :) we've all heard ... social costs of
the prohibition and WoD vs. social cost of the few who might develop problems.
Everything he argued was well articulated, supported with facts, and convincing.
As well, Buckley asked him whether he thought legalization would come and when.
Having somewhat of a finger on the pulse of a lot of imporant people in politics
and medicine, he indicated that he is very confident that marijuana, at least for
medical usage, will be availabe very shortly, and recreational use not far after
that.  He was also optimistic about total legalization, but seemed less sure
about putting as clear a timetable on it.  That's pretty much the sum of it...
