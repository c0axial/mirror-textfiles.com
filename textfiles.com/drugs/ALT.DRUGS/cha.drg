                          Canadian HEMP Association
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Who are we?

A national organization to facilitate and promote the growth of
a hemp industry in Canada.


     What is Hemp?

"Hemp is an alternative agricultural crop with significant 
economic and environmental benefits  for the Canadian 
farming and Industrial communities."

     Hemp, isn't that marijuana?

No.
Industrial hemp is a special low THC version
of the cannabis sativa plant grown for fiber and biomass. 
It can not be used as an intoxicant.

     Why Hemp?

Hemp is an alternative, renewable resource
capable of providing:
     100% Tree-Free paper products.
     All of our energy needs through biomass fuel production.
     A stronger more durable textile, made from 
     100% natural fibers, grown without pesticides.

     How can you help?

We are a non-profit environmental organization supported by 
membership and donations from both the private and 
business sector.  Please join with us, and 
help make a hemp industry in Canada, a reality.
