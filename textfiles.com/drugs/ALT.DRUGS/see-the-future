I am a Canadian citizen, i have taken acid/mushrooms and Marijuana before,
some of the stories written by these people are kinda wierd.  I have 
never had hullusionations or any wierd things popping out at me.  Every 
time i had taken any of theses drugs i seem to be able to see the future 
so to speak. Sounds weird i know .. It seems i can talk and it is like a 
large variety of ways to interpret what i said, like a giant telephone 
company plugging people words into other people's minds. Like tripping 
conversations , my memory can actually reacall more and more when i take 
these drugs.. It seems that my imagination grows or i have a need to find 
out what actually LSD does. My hearing seems to have been expanded by 100X 
at the bare mininum. Sorry to bother you with this crazy letter , i just 
wanted to share a little bit of my experiances, I love things that can be 
interpereted in wierd ways.. Ok man thanx for reading, and input you can 
give will be greatly appreciated. thanx
