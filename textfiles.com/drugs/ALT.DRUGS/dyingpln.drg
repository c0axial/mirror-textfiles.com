There are a few things that may be wrong:
1) If the leaves are turning brown or wilting you may be over fertilizing it.
   Solution: Flush the soil of the fertilizer salts with clean water.
2) You may be over watering. The plant's roots need oxygen.
   Solution: Don't water as often. It's O.K. for the soil to dry out a little,
             just don't let it get to dry. 
3) It may not be dying. It may be in shock from the transplanting.
   Solution: None that I know. All you can do is wait.
4) The change in the light spectum from natural sun to artifical light can
   damage a plant (not getting the spectrum it needs or the spectrum it is 
   used to).
   Solution: Get a different light, or put it back outside.
5) The soil may have a nutrient difficiency other than what is in the 
   fertilizer you are using. (You will have to describe what the plant
   looks like for a diagnosis.)
6) If the light is on 18 hrs, you want to use a vegetive fertilizer instead
   of a flower ferilizer. Or, turn down the light cycle to 12/12 (light/dark)
   to force flowering (if this is what you want). I do not think this would
   kill it, but I could be wrong.  

I hope this helps.
