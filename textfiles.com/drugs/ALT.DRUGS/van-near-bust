This exciting but uncomfortable (you'll see why later!) episode 
happened to a group of friends last summer.

It was the end of another school year and so a large group of us decided to 
take a little camping trip.  We agreed that we'd spend our weekend in the 
lovely, if a bit touristy, location of Acadia which is a popular 
vacation spot on the coast of Maine.  Since there were so many of us 
we had to ride down in three different vehicles.  I guess I was lucky 
enough to get into one of the indesreet little compact cars.  Some of 
my friends, however, rode down in an old dodge van.  The van was not 
bad in itself but the paint job was.  Next to various words written 
in spray paint such as "the groove mobile", "peace", and 
"Fukengruven" where the words DARE to keep kids of drugs.  This was 
enough to get the van pulled over.                                    
             Now this is when the "episode" occured.  The poilce 
pulled the van over on the highway without giving a reason and then 
proceded to ask questions like all cops do.  "Do you have any illegal 
drugs in the car?" etc.  The driver (who I'll call D) said no of 
course, and in fact they did not have any drugs in the car, which was 
unusual.  Someone did have a pipe though (I'll call her R).  Soon, 
for no reason another cop car pulled up, and then another!  They ran 
D's license and found it clean but just then yet another cop car 
pulled up with a dog in the back.  By now R was getting scared.  She 
couldn't really afford the $200 fine for the pipe.  Being female I 
guess she just had one more place to put it then guys do and she did!
The cops proceded to search the car (probable cause? Don't ask me!) 
ripping everything up (the bed, the tapistries, the paneling the 
cushions, the backpacks, the trash etc.).  Well the didn't find 
anything and the searches they did on my friends didn't turn anything 
up...but the dog did smell R's crotch a lot.  Well I guess dogs do 
that a lot anyway  :).
