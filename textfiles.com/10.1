<b>THE 10 YEARS OF TEXTFILES</b>

<small><i>In which a general welcome is extended, and the ground rules are laid out</small></i>
<p>
Welcome to the textfiles.com tenth anniversary celebration section, a 
collection of artifacts, essays and links composed for the textfiles.com
family of sites by its creator, Jason Scott.
<p>
In October of 1998, this website was created, and for the last decade has provided
history, nostalgia, reference, controversy, hilarity, and enjoyment for millions
of users around the world. As we round this important milestone, I thought it a fun
idea to look back on the beginnings of the site, history and trivia of both it and
the era it was meant to capture, and a tour of some of the more interesting bumps and
heights along the way.
<p>
The sections on the menu to the left can be clicked to directly, or you can follow
section by section through all of them as one large tour and essay. 
<p>
Thanks for the memories.
<p>
