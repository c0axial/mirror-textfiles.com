THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CAME TO ME FROM JOE LISMAN, K7PZH OF DOS PALOS, CA.
HE GOT IT FROM RAY MILLS, W6WIM, ALSO OF DOS PALOS.  THE INFORMATION SHEET WAS
TITLED:

The antenna boom is made out of schedule 40 pvc pipe, 1" size, which is 1.5"
in diameter, actual size.  The boom is approximately 42" long.  The cross
pieces are 1/4 inch bicycle flag poles made out of fiberglass, or you could
use fiberglass fence posts available from Orchard Supply Hardware stores in
California.

There it is folks and I hope that you are able to build it from these crude
instructions.  REMEMBER FOR VERTICAL POLARIZATION, YOU FEED A QUAD FROM THE
HORIZONTAL SPREADER END.  I think that one of the uses of packet should be the
desimination of information.  This is my attempt at a construction article.
How about some more homebrew projects with illustrations on packet radio.
I would be interested in reports from anyone who builds this antenna. Good
luck and I will look forward to your commeDoug, KI6DS @ K6RAU-1
