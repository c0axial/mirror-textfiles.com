Congratulations:



     You've made a wise move.  You are about to get a taste

of the unique but most successful strategies of the master

Private Investigator, Mr. Michael Enlow, himself.  He is

often referred to as the greatest private investigator in the

world!  This free report and introductory presentation is

sweeping the country like a raging fire!



     In case you didn't know, Private Investigators will

not share their investigative concepts.  They are guarded

secrets; the cherished nuggets of gold that make them what

they are.  I'm sure you're wondering why Mr. Enlow is doing

this.  Well, frankly, it's because he, like you, has finally

reached the conclusion that our judicial system simply don't

work without a little help . . . crooks don't get what they

deserve without a little personal touch . . .



     Perhaps we will let Mr. Enlow himself explain.  We've

included excerpts from some of his writings.  They are self

explanatory . . . it's time we protect our privacy and yet,

at the same time preserve our judicial system.



     It all started back in 1976, when Mr. Enlow dropped out

of high school and ran away from home in hopes of making

fortunes in the "oil field."  Well it didn't turn out quite

that way.  The story that follows is a true one, and a

perfect example of how anyone with the will power can reach

their desires and goals. . .



          "Where there's a will there's a way."

Dear Friend:



     I'm at somewhat of a disadvantage. I'm a high school

dropout who failed english several times.  If you are looking

for literary style--you may find my writing annoying,

confusing, and a bit outside of the ordinary." However, if

information is what you want... I'm your man.   You see,

information brokering, (investigating) was my specialty and

my retirement ticket that enabled me to retire at 34 years

old and make the contributions you are reading now. So, let's

get on with the story...



     Unlike the average private investigator, I learned the

hard way.  There's nothing like the nicks and bruises of

learning on your own.  If I had to do it all over again, I

would do it just exactly the same.



     It all started when I was just seventeen years old.  I

was in a state of rebellion, not unlike many kids when they

leave the nest.  I ran away from home with only two pair of

jeans and a couple of T-shirts.  I hitch-hiked to Louisiana

and arrived in the swamps of south Louisiana around midnight

on a Wednesday night.  I remember it all so well, even the

strange sounds I heard as I walked along the edge of the road

between two "Bayous." I honestly expected to be eaten by an

alligator before reaching my destination.  No kiddin'!



     Early the next morning, I found a job at a "labor camp."

A labor camp is a place where people who had little or no

money--people like me--could work for room and board.



     I began working in "pipe yards" rolling three-ton pipes

along racks and onto forklifts.  I was working at least 12

hours a day, and when I say work, I mean WORK.  It was

nothing like the sheltered life I lived at home, but when I

left home I was determined to show everyone I could make it,

one way or another, and I wasn't about to quit.



     However, after only three weeks I realized I wasn't

making any progress.  Once the labor camp took money out for

my rent, meals, steel toe boots, hard hat, etc., I was only

clearing $35 to $40 a week!  Can you believe that?  I was

working twelve hour days, seven days a week, and I was

earning peanuts!  Oh well! I knew there had to be a better

way, so I put my mind to work and decided to use one of my

"hidden talents" to better myself.



     I struck off one Friday evening to "find help." I

dressed as best I could and walked to the nearest lounge.

Then, I really "went to work."  It wasn't long until I saw

exactly what I was looking for. (Now, pardon me, and remember

we are talking about survival.)  There she was, cute, well

built, and best of all, SHE HAD  A CAR! (just what I needed

to get myself a better job).  Well, later that evening I left

with her, and eventually made a home with her.



     My new friend was going through a divorce and had a two-

year old daughter.  (Later, I learned she was only 16 years

old, but, heck, I was only seventeen.)  Her mother and dad

didn't like me at all, and they made it perfectly clear.



     I used her car to find a better job.  I became a "tack-

welder,"  and boy, was I excited.  I was making a whopping

$5.00 an hour.  Somehow I just knew I was well on my way to

the top!  A couple of weeks later I made friends with a

welder.  He taught me his trade, and soon I increased my

income again.



     Then, once again, I got a better job offer.  This time

working on a dredge.  By this time my girlfriend and I had

our own apartment and were slowly making progress toward

"being somebody."  On the day we were to leave so that I

could get started with my new job, her dad was having an

outdoor garage sale.  As I was fumbling through the usual

garage sale items (unpaired shoes, old vases, remnants of

fads gone bad, etc.) I noticed something unusual.  There was

a small .25 caliber automatic pistol for sale!  I had to have

it.  I always had a fascination with guns.



     Later that evening my little darling and I left to go to

the nearby city.  Once we checked in the hotel, she asked me

to go to the vending machines to get a cold drink.  I left

the room and all hell broke loose.  Suddenly, police surround

me with bright lights and pistols drawn, screaming, "FREEZE!

YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!"  They immediately searched me and "lo

and behold" what did they find in my coat pocket but my new

unloaded .25 caliber automatic pistol.  (This made me out to

be a certain criminal.)



     The police booked me at the local sheriff's office with

a variety of charges, including carrying a concealed weapon.

I discovered that "Cutie's" dad REALLY DIDN'T LIKE ME! He had

set fire to our apartment, damaged my roommate's car, set me

up with the gun, and told the cops that I "ran off" with his

"minor child."



     Well, I paid my fine in the first parish for "carrying a

concealed weapon."  Extradition proceedings then commenced to

take me back to the parish where we had been living to face

the other host of charges.



     I refused to allow the court to appoint me an "indigent

defense" lawyer, and told the Judge, "I will represent

myself."   Well, if any of you have ever had any dealings

with Louisiana law, you know they are very different from any

other state in the U.S.  Remember this!  You'll see that I

had a lot to learn about the "Bayou Country."



     I called my dad and told him of my predicament.  He

said, "Well son, you got in trouble, you'll have to get out."

I made up my mind, I would beat these charges. After all, I

was innocent.



     The first day I was in jail this real big black guy

decided he wanted my breakfast.  He slid my tray over to him

and began to eat! I took it back and he said, "meet me behind

the camera and we'll see whose breakfast it is." (The "chow

hall" was closely monitored by security cameras.)



     Now, I believe if there is no way out, get the first

punch and make it count. That I did. I nailed that guy in

places that would make Mohammed Ali stop and think.  While I

was only 140 pounds, I was a country boy who had fended for

myself all my life. I won his (and everyone else's) respect

from that day forth.



     The guards caught us fighting, and since I

obviously had the upper hand, I was the one punished.  They

put me "in the hole." The hole is a small cubicle in concrete

about 3 feet tall, 3 feet deep and 3 feet wide with steel

grating on the front.  Part of the punishment of getting

thrown in the hole was ration of only bread and water.  This

went on for days.



     I knew no one in this part of the country, had no money,

and no outside contact with the world.  On top of this

"Cutie" never came to visit.  In fact, I have yet to see or

hear from her.  It turns out this was a ploy by the father to

take his daughter and granddaughter and leave town while I

was in jail. Back then, I knew little about investigating or

I would have tracked him down and . . .  Oh well, maybe it's

better I didn't know.



     A week or so after sitting in jail I went before the

judge for arraignment. I plead not guilty. I had often heard;

you don't get a fair trial with an indigent defender, so I

chose to represent myself. I asked the judge for access to

the necessary law books to prepare my defense.  The judge

agreed to my request, and I had the entire law library at my

disposal.  I studied diligently.  Days . . . weeks .  . .

months passed . . . and I was beginning to wonder if I were

ever going to be brought to trial.



    I LEARNED THAT YOU HAVE TO FILE A MOTION FOR A SPEEDY

            TRIAL OR THEY MAY NEVER GIVE YOU ONE!



     So, I filed a handwritten motion for a speedy trial and

soon thereafter the court sent notice of a court date.  I

began to prepare as best I could from my PRISON CELL.  Low

and behold, I discovered a law that said I could file a "Writ

of Habeus Corpus."  This law requires the sheriff to present

you before the judge and show just cause to hold you in

custody.  Guess what happened?  The court dismissed the

charges.  "Cutie's" dad didn't appear to present his

allegations.  I was free!  The judge listened carefully as I

described the entire ordeal.  He strongly recommended I sue

the affiant who was responsible for my false imprisonment.



     Now, let's get to the fun part. The entire time of my

incarceration, I wrote letters to the district attorney,

telling him I was innocent, that I was framed.  He never

replied.  I asked him, in front of the judge if he had

received my letters.  He said he had, but refused to say why

he hadn't answered my letters.  It was then that I made a

statement that this certain District Attorney will never

forget.  I said, "With all due respect Your Honor, may I make

a statement?"  The Judge said "proceed." I looked at the

District Attorney and said, "Mr. District Attorney, I shall

return.  Someday you will see me again, I will be standing in

this exact spot defending people like myself."  He smiled and

turned his head away.



     I continued my studies of investigative procedure, and

the legal guidelines of procuring and presenting evidence.  I

studied Forensic Science, Psychology, The Louisiana Code of

Criminal Procedure, and every other book I could find.  I

ordered books from colleges across the U.S. and read. . .

and read . . . and read.



     It was seventeen months later, but finally I became the

investigator for the Indigent Defender's Office, working to

defend people who were financially unable to hire an

attorney. (Indigent Defendants made up about 80% of those

accused of crimes)



     The D. A. almost fainted that first day I appeared in

court for the Indigent Defender's Office. He looked through

his glasses, then over his glasses, then turned his head and

looked back.  "YES IT'S ME . . . suit and all! I'm back."



     THEN I GAVE HIM HELL!  He had to work for his money. I

would utilize little known forensic procedures of examining

evidence that were unfamiliar to him.  He would often need a

recess, to study.  I would find witnesses "out of the blue."

I left no rock unturned.  Whether it was a murder case or a

NSF check case, he had to work hard to stay ahead of me.



     Now you may think this was an act of vengeance, but

really it wasn't. I simply took advantage of the opportunity

to show this district attorney, that he should answer his

mail! He should listen to both sides of a story, and realize

when some guys say, "I'm innocent," or  "I'll kill your

ass!", THEY MAY MEAN IT!  I believe he really didn't believe

I was going to be back.



Who would believe that a long haired punk could ever be

anything more than "a hippie." I tried telling him in my

letter I came from a good home with Christian parents and I

was a good person.  I didn't steal, kill, or do anything

illegal. In fact, I had never even had a traffic ticket.



     Shortly thereafter I started my business.  You see, the

entire time I was working for the Indigent Defender's Office,

I was passing business cards to every attorney I met.  Also,

I was gaining a lot of recognition because of the fight I was

giving the D.A.  People were circulating the story of the

"thorn in the side of the D.A."



     The attorneys liked me, and my win ratio in the court

room was speaking louder than words. It wasn't too long that

I was receiving so many requests to do work for the lawyers

in the area, that I abandoned my post as the investigator for

the Indigent Defender's Office. (I heard the D.A.'s Office

threw a celebration!) I decided to put my mind to work making

money.



     I went after it with all that was within me and in no

time at all . . . I become recognized as "the agent to call

if you had problems," earning $100,000.00+ a year.

Now the moral of this story is...NEVER TAKE ANYONE'S WORD FOR

GRANTED! HE MAY BE SERIOUS!  Never make decisions--financial,

personal or otherwise--based on outward appearance, financial

status, what you've heard, etc.  You may regret them!



     In the case of the District Attorney, he had probably

received many such letters, saying I AM INNOCENT and he

ignored mine as just another. He didn't believe me in the

courtroom when I said I'd return.  However, I became a

nightmare to him.



=============================================================



     So you see, we need to be careful who we offend. We need

to know who we are dealing with.  The arts and sciences of

investigating go way beyond what television portrays.  There

is nothing private today.  We have to know how information is

obtained, from where, and if you do, you can more

successfully secure your privacy.



     Now, we promised to teach you 11 insider secrets that

can help you to get anything on anyone.  Well, again, we will

refer to writings by the "Millionaires Investigator" himself,

Mr. Enlow.  This is a piece that was published during

November 1991 that should help you to find almost anyone,

even if they're hiding!



             NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT INVESTIGATING!



     I will show you my way, and I do have an impressive

track record. I will reveal the hottest and most advanced

resources available to you. I WILL NOT HOLD BACK!  I'm going

to lay the cards on the table.  I will give you every source

I have. In fact, you will soon pick up the phone and get many

investigative answers for the price of a telephone call!  I

intend to show everything I have learned in over fifteen hard

years of footwork.



     As I explained to many of you by phone, I am associated

with what I believe is the most professional network of

investigators in the world.  In actuality, there

are over 700 of us across America.  We are referred to as

Legal Investigators, mainly because we do mostly legal

related work.  To qualify to belong to our association, your

credentials must meet certain guidelines. (Our approval

process involves thorough investigation of your character,

professionalism, qualifications and experience.)



     This is why we can get the job done, we have the sources

and contacts.  We also make it our business to know about the

most up-to-date advancements in investigative procedure and

forensic science.



     First, I will elaborate on what many of you have asked.

How do I find someone?  Finding people is very easy, provided

you "know the ropes."



     There are usually two basic kinds of missing persons.

They are people who are missing on purpose (they wanted to

disappear), and people with whom you have simply lost touch.

Those missing on purpose may be escaped cons, husbands who

are tired of paying child support or alimony, and debt

skippers.  The second type are people who have lost touch

over a period of time.  I have learned the techniques for

finding people will usually work on either of these two types

of missing persons, although the first type are usually

somewhat harder to find.



     Believe it or not, there are easy ways to find these

people.  In fact, every one of them can usually be located by

telephone, IF you have the right information.  The most

common mistake of a "skipper" is that he or she will not

usually detach themselves from their previous lifestyle or

their old acquaintances, (i.e. family and friends).  Many of

them will keep their old habits.



     When I am finding someone, I first ask myself, "Who

would they be in touch with?"  If someone else already knows

where they are, why should you go to the expense and headache

of finding them yourself.  Just ask whoever knows! I guess

you think I'm off my rocker don't you?  NO! You just ask!

Want to know how?



     First, determine with whom your subject may be in touch.

Then decide on a suitable guise for your pretext call.  You

may be a car salesman, insurance adjuster, pizza delivery

man, or whatever is suitable for your specific need.  Then

design a pretext.  Always write down the exact details of who

you are, what your business is about, who you will name as

being involved in your "make believe story" and as many other

details as it takes to make your story believable.  Study

your pretext before making the call!  DON'T SOUND PARANOID!

Act normal.  Talk slow and with authority.  Then throw your

pitch, using as many details as you can. Remember you want

this person to come out and tell you where your subject is.

(Beware of impersonating an officer, this can get you in

serious trouble)



     Another major rule of thumb in pretext is to never use

the exact name of the party you are looking for.  Use a name

that sounds near the same.  For example, if you are trying to

find Dave Jenkins, ask for Dale Jenkins.  There is a

psychological effect that lends credibility to your pretext

and often triggers the release of the information you are

after.  Think about it, if someone (a bill collector) were

trying to find you, wouldn't you think they would get your

name right?  You bet!  And the effect of not calling the

exact name lends credibility to your pretext.  They will

almost always give you what you are looking for.  Let me give

you an example:



     Not long ago, a young lady who was  having difficulty

getting a subpoena served on her husband came to my office.

She had previously hired other P. I.'s to help her find this

"missing husband," and despite their enormous fees they were

absolutely unsuccessful.  She came to me, pleading for my

help.  I asked her a few questions and learned that the

husband was a Junior, and the Senior lived not too far out of

town, so I designed the following pretext and the call went

like this:



            Dialed father's house.



Mr. Jones:  Hello.



Mr. Enlow:  Yes, Mr. Jones?



Mr. Jones:  This is he.



Mr. Enlow:  Mr. Jones, my name is Bill Gatlin with XXXXXX

            Insurance Co.  We are adjusting the claim

            involving the accident between Ms.  Forman and

Mr.

            Briggs on October 6th., and I need to get

            your statement as to what you saw. Is that ok?



Mr. Jones:  What accident?



Mr. Enlow:  This is Mr. Thomas Jones, isn't it?



Mr. Jones:  Yes it is.



Mr. Enlow:  Mr. Jones I'm taking about the accident involving

            the small blue Chevrolet belonging to Ms. Forman

            and the black GMC pick-up of Mr. Briggs that

            collided at the intersection of 4th and Ellen

            there in Canton on October 6th.  You did witness

            this accident, did you not?



Mr. Jones:  I don't know what accident you are talking about.



Mr. Enlow:  Mr. Jones, let me be sure I have this right, you

            were not a witness to this accident?



Mr. Jones:  I don't know what accident you are talking about.



Mr. Enlow:  ...and you do live at Canton.



Mr. Jones:  Yes, but I haven't seen an accident.



Mr. Enlow:  Well maybe I picked the wrong Jeff Jones from the

            phone book. The witnesses said the Jones I needed

            to see lived in Canton. Do you know of

            any other Jeff Jones' who live in Canton?



Mr. Jones:  Not unless it's my boy. He's a Junior.  He may be

            who you need to see.



Mr. Enlow:  Is there a number where I can reach him?



Mr. Jones:  Yes. His number is 566-2190.  He lives right out

            there in that trailer park off 138 highway.  His

            truck is usually there.  It's a white Chevrolet.



Mr. Enlow:  Ok. Well, I'll check with him.  I'm sorry I

            bothered you Mr. Jones.



Mr. Jones:  Oh. No problem.



Mr. Enlow:  Thank you.



Mr. Jones:  Goodbye.



     Now you can how easy it can be to get the inside scoop

on finding people really fast?



     Would you like to know a fast and easy way to get exact

forwarding address information?  It's simple.  What you do is

address a standard envelope to the target you are trying to

find, and insert a blank piece of paper.  This will make it

look like a standard letter. (The P. O. may get P.O.'d about

you using this one if you do it too often.)  Then you

proceed, addressing the letter using the last known address.

BUT...in the left hand corner of the envelope write:



                       DO NOT FORWARD

                ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED



     Guess, what will happen?  You will have your target's

current address back in the mail in a matter of only a day or

so. The best part of all is that he or she doesn't even know

you're on their trail.  Ok. What if you get a P. O.  Box and

need a street address, what then?



     To get the current street address of someone who has a

P.  O.  Box, in a business deal, you may file a "Request for

Box-Holder's Address."  You will need to send a letter to

your postmaster as follows:



            REQUEST FOR BOXHOLDER STREET ADDRESS



     Pursuant to provisions of Postal Service Regulations--

(Administrative Support Manual, Section 352.44) I, the

undersigned, request that the address of the following holder

of P. O. Box _____in ______________________________________

                        (City)          (State) (Zip)

be provided.  The reason for this request is that said

boxholder is conducting a business known as__________________

through said post office box, and as a customer require his

street address in order to pursue a complaint regarding

service or (quality) (Non-delivery) (other)__________________



Dated:_______________________Signature______________

_________



                             Printed Name____________________



     Ok, I want to go a little further.  Do you have a last

known address or just a phone number.  Well, I'll show you

how to use this information to get a world of information.



     Would you like to be able to pick up the phone and get

someone's current address or phone number in a matter of

minutes?



     Ok, here's how you do it!  Basically what you will be

doing is accessing a little known database which has

statistical information on almost everyone in America!  (This

includes you and me.)



     Here's a telephone number where you can often get the

information you need by simply picking up your telephone and

making one phone call.  There is a charge of $2.00 per minute

via your telephone bill.  However, you will usually get more

information from these people in ten minutes than with most

private investigators in hours. Most private investigators

charge anywhere from $35 to $50 an hour, here you can get

your answers for as little as $5 to $20. (I am in no way

whatsoever affiliated with the people who operate this

service.)



     Now, to maximize this service you will need the last

known address or the telephone number of the person you are

trying to find.  Then dial 1-900-288-3020 and shoot away!

That's it!  In a matter of minutes you will usually get the

exact address or phone number.



     If you really want to get serious, they will also

provide you with the three nearest neighbors names, phone

numbers and addresses!  With this information and a slight

amount of creativity you could design and use a suitable

pretext to interview the neighbors. This may provide the

leads you need to find your target, in the event they have

moved from the address you have. It's amazing how many trails

or information we leave behind us . . . ..

============================================================



     So as you can see, with a little creativity and

instruction almost anyone can be their own private

investigator.  We mail this letter across the country to

people like yourself everyday.  Guess what?  Mr.  Enlow once

said, you have a common trait with most successful private

investigators. . .you are a do'er!  You don't just sit back

and wait on something to fall out of the sky!  You are the

kind of person with the attitude that it takes to be a world

class "super spy." You are a make it happen person.



     You obviously have a problem of your own (evidenced by

the fact that you ordered this free report) and you intend to

make the best of it!  This is the personality traits that

brought Mr. Enlow fame and fortune.  At 34 years old, Mr.

Enlow now enjoys the better things in life, simply counseling

others with the information that will allow them to get the

answers they so desperately need.  And in this day; "The

Information Age" we all need to know more.



     Ok.  Let's move on to the next topic.



    





     Did you know there are hundreds and hundreds of

electronic surveillance supply houses.? Wonder how they

manage to stay in business when there are not many court

orders issue a year allowing the use of such gadgets?



     Well, my friend, I will tell you, they are making a

tremendous amount of money selling electronic surveillance

equipment.  Their customers are Federal, State, and Local Law

Enforcement Agencies, corporations, and a few dishonest

private investigators, who are all illegally using these

concepts in their investigations.



     A very popular book on electronic surveillance came out

in 1967 and listed some of the buyers of electronic

surveillance gear.  Everyone was quite surprised to find Avis

Rent-A-Car, various hotel chains, Coca-Cola, various life

insurance companies, and the like, were spending millions for

specialized bugging devices. But to find out that Walt Disney

was a major customer really blew my mind.



     In my career, I have discovered hundreds of illegal

electronic surveillance applications.  Bugs are everywhere;

in small businesses, large corporations, people's homes,

conventions, and you name it.  In fact, if you don't believe

me, try programming a typical scanner to search and scan the

35 to 50 megahertz band.  Just ride around your city and

listen.  I never get bored on stake-outs because I am usually

within range of some really hot listening.  I just wonder how

many thousands of illegal electronic surveillance

applications are in place at this very moment.  It is

astounding!



     I will start by describing some of the ways electronic

surveillance is done.  First, there is what we call hard

wiring.  Basically, this is the same as having an everyday

microphone plugged into a tape recorder.  When you speak into

the microphone whatever you say is recorded onto a tape

or sometimes intercepted by the listener using earphones.



     Then, there are electronic transmitters which intercept

the signal via microphone and transmit it via radio signal to

a receiver of some sort.



     Finally, there are the more advanced long range

listening devices like the laser mic, the shotgun microphone,

the parabolic microphone, and others which can pick up a

whisper for long ranges.



     Now, I will elaborate on a few types of electronic

surveillance and the ways you can protect yourself from them.



First let's discuss. . .



                         HARD WIRING



     This type of electronic interception requires the use of

wire to carry the signal to you or some other listening

device.  There are many ways that hard wiring is done.  Wires

the size of a human hair can be used to transmit a signal to

a microphone.  They are often painted over, concealing them

from view.



     At one end is the microphone, and the other is a tape

recorder or someone who is monitoring with headphones.  This

method of electronic interception is the oldest in the

industry, yet very effective.



     Wires are sometimes hidden under carpet, in air

conditioning ducts, along baseboards, and almost anywhere you

can imagine.



     There is even a conductive paint, which closely

resembles fingernail polish, that will transmit the minute

electrical impulses from the microphone to the recorder.



     There are so many different ways for this type

application that I will not attempt to cover them all.  I

will just tell you of a few we have discovered in our

countermeasures searches.



     Once, in checking a certain client's business for bugs,

we located a very cleverly installed hard-wire system.

Obviously someone had access to the office for a considerable

length of time, or maybe did a little breaking and entering

to get into the office.



     Anyway, this particular application was a small

microphone element about 1/4th inch in diameter, placed in a

small hole in a  picture frame.  A 1/4 inch hole drilled into

the rear of the picture frame held the microphone in place.

A small 1/8th inch hole continued through the frame to allow

the sound to reach the microphone.



     Then, a couple of small jumper wires were run from the

mic to the wall and thumb tacked to the wall.  At this point,

conductive paint, as described above, continued down the

seams of the paneling walls to the baseboard.  Behind the

baseboard the conductive paint met with another set of wires

connected to some old phone wires.



     A recorder was concealed in the basement near the phone

junction box.  Every sound made in our client's office was

recorded onto cassette tape by the use of a long play tape

recorder.  (Many times agents will change the play and record

speed of tape recorders by changing the size of the internal

pulleys.  This will enable a standard tape recorder to record

from 4 to 15 hours on one side of a tape.)



     The applications of hard-wiring are so numerous there is

no way they can all be covered in one letter, but let me tell

you of another clever hardwire we discovered.  We received a

call from a lady who, believing that she was bugged,

requested that we sweep her home for illegal electronic

surveillance devices.



     After a very thorough sweep by several of my agents, we

billed the client and told her there were no electronic

surveillance devices on the premises.  Although with the

advancement of modern technology, we simply cannot guarantee

100% that we will find them.  There are bugs now which are

activated by remote control.  If the person who is bugging

the premises hears that a sweep is about to be done, he can

de-activate the bug until we have cleared out.



     Anyway, let me tell you of this most unusual hard-wire

by an amateur.  A few days later the lady called again and

said she knew without a doubt that she was bugged.  She

insisted we must have missed something.  This time yours

truly went to the location and ran every test we had

equipment to run.  Still, I could find no bug.  Then, I began

a physical inspection of the entire house from attic to

basement.  I noticed something very strange.



     The stereo, situated in the center of the  home, was on

and the cassette deck was playing.  Closer inspection showed

that it was recording!  I couldn't find a microphone, or at

least there wasn't one plugged into the microphone jack.  It

didn't have it's own built in microphone so how could it be

recording?  I stopped the tape and when I played it back,

there was a perfect recording of our client and myself as I

was questioning her.  I checked the back of the stereo and

noticed one of the speaker wires was running into the cabinet

of the stereo.  I disassembled the stereo and damn if the

wire wasn't connected to the microphone jack on the inside

and routed to the speakers.  THE SPEAKERS WERE BEING USED TO

CONDUCT MICROPHONE SIGNALS TO THE TAPE RECORDER!  And it

worked like a charm.



     On top of this, the husband had changed the record/play

speed of the recorder to accommodate 8 hours of recording.

This was one of the most sophisticated "home-made" jobs I had

ever seen, but it worked!  Every night while the wife was

working as a nurse he could review everything that happened

at home the day before, and was overhearing her telephone

calls, and her visitors.  It was just like him being

invisible. I have to credit this guy, that was quite a

design.



     My best advice on detecting any type of hard wire

installation is to look for any alteration in the carpet

where wiring may have been routed under the carpet.  Watch

for any unusual sets of wires near and around your telephone

wires.  (You should always be familiar with the type and

number of wires near your outside telephone connection box,

and watch out for any new pairs that may appear.)



     Another type of hard-wire system is a direct telephone

tap.  This only requires a standard tape recorder with both a

microphone and remote control jack and an "auto recorder

control." These are about $25.00 and are available at any

Radio Shack or other electronic supply store.



     The auto recorder control is a small box about 3 inches

square and has two wires coming out of it.  It also has two

switches on top of it to set it for record or playback mode.

There is a gray wire which plugs directly into any extra

telephone jack or cut and spliced into the telephone line.

The other wire with two plugs connects to the tape recorder.

One small plug goes to the remote jack of the tape recorder

and the other larger plug to the microphone jack on the

recorder.  Then, press the record button on the recorder and

it's all set.  The auto recording control will keep the

recorder dormant until the phone is in use.  It then

activates the recorder to clearly record both sides of the

conversation.  As soon as the phone is placed back on the

hook the recorder stops recording and waits for the next

incoming or outgoing call.  This feature prevents the tape

recorder from playing constantly and allows for the recorder

to only be active during calls.



     Most people who use this method of information gathering

will plug the auto recording control into an extra telephone

jack in the home or business, and conceal the recorder

underneath a bed or behind some other object to prevent it

from detection.



     However, in those cases where there are no extra jacks,

they will cut the telephone jack wire coming out of the auto

recording control and strip away the insulation from the red

and green wires.  Then, they will splice it into the phone

wire in the attic or anywhere on the premises telephone line.

Nearly all phone systems operate on a single grey or white

cable. Once the insulation is removed the cable contains a

red, green, yellow, and black wire.  This cable carries

approximately 40 to 50 volts and will seldom shock if handled

improperly, allowing for amateur surveillance applications.



     Once the insulation is stripped away, these two wires,

the red and green, should be matched with the red and green

in the telephone wire and then properly taped to insure no

static will occur.  In 99% of the applications we've found we

seldom find them with static, clicks, hums, or any other

problem which might alert someone of a bug.  I have also seen

instances where people have used bubble gum to seal the wires

once spliced.  (We've also found beautiful fingerprint

impressions in gum.)



     We've seen cases where extensions of people's phones

have been requested by investigators.  They design a ruse to

the phone company to have an extension installed in a

predetermined location, often under the guise of an "office

extension."  Then, they connect the recording device and

after monitoring calls for several weeks, disappear from the

location before the person bugged receives the phone bill

reflecting the added expense for a second line.



And then. . .



                 THERE IS THE CORDLESS PHONE



     Now, many of you purchased my book, Darkness to Light,

which tells how cordless phones transmit a signal that can be

intercepted by a common scanner.  But for those of you who

missed out, I will elaborate.  Cordless phones transmit a

signal up to a mile away!  BEWARE OF DISCUSSING CONFIDENTIAL

BUSINESS ON ONE OF THESE PHONES!



     The box your cordless phone came in very clearly advises

you that these phones are transmitters.  Yet, every day

millions of people, both at work and home, continue to use

these phones and spread their business throughout the

airwaves.  There is little that can be done to stop people

from hearing your calls, short of purchasing a scrambling

device.  Then, the party to whom you converse would also have

to have such a device to understand you. This would so

restrict the use of your cordless phone that you may as well

use a regular phone.



     If you suspect someone may be intercepting your calls,

and you wish to recognize how it is done, it works like this.

Nearly all cordless phones transmit in the 46.00 to 47.00

megahertz band.  To intercept the cordless phone, the

operator will use the search feature on the scanner and

program 46.00 as the low and 47.00 as the high and touch the

search scan key.  If a cordless phone is in use in the area

it will lock in on that frequency.  He or she can then hear

both sides of the conversation in crystal clear for up to one

mile.  The use of a good low-band antenna with the scanner

will increase the reception range of a cordless phone.



     Many private investigators will drive by a subject's

home searching these frequencies and then scan for

information that will provide leads that later help them to

document evidence.



     It is arguable whether this is an invasion of privacy or

a violation of Federal Law because of the notice on the

carton in which the phone came.  It clearly states they are

not private.  Many investigators and attorneys argue that

people waive their rights to the expectation of privacy when

they use such a telephone.



     Do you want to go a step further?  There is now a device

called an "auto scanner recording control" which will allow

the scanner to be connected to a tape recorder.  The recorder

only records when the cordless phone is in use.  Private

investigators will sometimes determine the appropriate

frequency of the subject's phone, and then place a battery

powered scanner with the recorder control and recorder in a

water tight container.  He or she will conceal the equipment

in hedges, culverts, etc., near the subject's house.  Then,

after a few days, retrieve the past few days telephone

conversations, never entering upon the subject's property or

touching his phone lines!  And if the tape isn't long enough

he or she will use a long-play recorder that will record

hours of conversation.



     Many surveillance providers and spy shops sell recorders

that will record 10 or more hours of conversation on a single

cassette tape.  If you are a business man who often uses a

tape recorder for business, this may be a real help to you.



     The concepts mentioned above are only a "touch of the

iceberg" of what is happening in illegal electronic

surveillance.  I could write an entire book on just this

topic.  Since we only have only so much space to write each

month, I will have to continue this topic in future issues.

However, if you have specific questions or comments, you may

call my office of send a fax and we will try to answer your

questions.



     Please don't be so foolish as to believe, "It couldn't

happen to me", or you may find a lot of your deals going

sour.  Or perhaps, someone may decide your secret is worth

more than your bank account....



    BEWARE:  IT IS HAPPENING MORE THAN YOU WOULD BELIEVE!



     I have turned down many multi-thousand dollar jobs to do

industrial spying, and if I am getting these offers, so are

many others.  You can never be to careful.



     There are devices which will help you to detect illegal

telephone taps, transmitters, and conventional hard-wire

bugs, but the best protections is to follow a few rules:



     a.  Never say anything on the phone you wouldn't want to

         hear in the courtroom.



     b.  Never trust anyone.  If what you say could hurt you

         and your business, shut-up.



     c.  If you must discuss very confidential business,

         create a loud background noise that will hinder the

         less expensive electronic devices, i.e., a radio

         or television with loud volume, a fan running in the

         same room, etc., and talk quietly.  (You would be

         amazed how effective this background noise is

         against electronic invasion of your privacy.)



     d.  When discussing very delicate issues, never meet in

         anyone's office.  Meet in public places and be sure

         to be observant of any bulges which could be

         concealed tape recorders, etc.



     A good private investigator will let "Ma-Bell" do the

work, so beware.  Let me explain. . .



     Some time ago, a lady called my office in extreme mental

anguish.  She explained how she and her husband were going

through this awful, dirty, mud-slinging, child custody

battle.  He had decided to take matters into his own hands.

He took their three year old daughter and disappeared.



     She managed to get a contempt judgement and criminal

charges were filed against the husband for parental

kidnapping.  She learned that he had left the state, and

therefore, was successful in getting the F. B. I.  involved

in

the case. She also hired a couple of private investigators.

Well, to make a long story short, many months passed and she

was no closer to finding her little girl than when she began.



                    Then she heard of me.



     When this lady called my office, I really didn't want to

get involved, considering the "Boys in Black" (F.B.I.) were

already working on the case.  After all, they're much better

qualified than a small town private eye. Right?  Well. . .

after listening to this lady crying and pleading, I couldn't

resist.  So, I agreed to accept the assignment with the

understanding that she would tell no one of my involvement.

(F.B.I. Agents generally don't like P. I.'s.)



     I interviewed the client for information regarding the

husband's family, friends, acquaintances, social security

number, date of birth, habits, etc., and went to work.



              In no time at all I found him!



     I found him in a suburb of North Little Rock, Arkansas

living under an assumed identity.  I quickly packed up and

took off.  Before I left, I called the local law enforcement

authorities to be sure I could count on them to serve the

arrest warrant and assist me in recovering the child.



                          BUT...



     When I arrived at the husband's apartment, it was

vacant!  That was just the beginning!  What really "set me

off" was a note taped to the wall that said, "Ha!  Ha!  Mr.

P. I."  Talk about a blow to my ego and a fire in my gut!



     I called the client to report what I'd found.  I didn't

tell her about the note; I just told her what had happened.

That jerk made me look like a fool and the cops got a good

laugh out of it.  Oh well.  (I later found out that one of

the local cops had warned the subject that I was enroute.)



     The client's money was spent, and the baby was still

missing.  Now what do I do?  Well, being the "good Samaritan"

that I am (and considering the cute note he left me) I told

the client not to worry, that I would put my mind to work to

solve her problem.  I promised to relocate and return her

child soon.  I also agreed to do so at no additional charge

if I wasn't successful.



     After exhausting every lead I had, I decided there was

only thing left to do, steal his mother's telephone bill out

of the mail box! But wait, I couldn't do that, that's

illegal... Back to the drawing board...



     I laid awake at night, tormenting myself with the fact

that this jerk had pulled a "fast one" on me... and that damn

note...  Who did this guy think he was?  Didn't he know who I

was?  Yeah, I was going to find him!  You betcha!



     Now remember, I had already used the client's entire

budget during the first attempt to locate the subject, and

I had to improvise if I was to successfully complete this

assignment without losing a lot of money.  (Not that I

wouldn't have spent my own money to find this contemptible

wimp!) Anyway, I devised a short cut remedy to this problem.

And here's how it was done:



     I used two tape recorders, ready with fresh batteries

and tapes.  On one I recorded the sound of a telephone dial

tone.  On the other I connected an "induction pick-up." This

is a small suction cup microphone you stick to the ear piece

of the phone which allows you to record both sides of a

telephone call.  Then, I called the mother and the call went

something like this:



ME:  Hello, Ms. Blank Blank?



MOM: Yes.



ME:  This is Dr. Kincaid at the Southwest Medical Center.

     Are you the mother of Suzanne Blank?



MOM: No, I'm the grandmother. . .What's wrong?



ME:  Well, Suzanne has had an accident and I must speak

     with her mother or father to authorize additional

     medical treatment. . . Hello. . . HELLO! ! !



     Then I pressed the play button on the second recorder

and played the dial tone into the mouthpiece of the phone.

And, I bet you'll never guess what grandma thought.  Yes, she

thought we were disconnected...click...click...click...went

the pulse dial sounds of a dialing telephone.  I know you'll

never guess who she called.  That's right, "good ole grandma"

called her baby boy, the lousy jerk who left me the cute

little "Ha, Ha note."



     Meanwhile, tape recorder number one is clearly recording

grandma's attempt to call the subject.  Needless to say, in

no time at all I had the subject's phone number and his alias

name, address, place of employment, etc.  The following

morning the Fed's took care of the rest.



     Yes, I did feel bad about upsetting grandma, but not

half as bad as I felt about that note!  Besides that, she had

lied to me and told me she had no idea where her son may be,

and I really don't like liars!



     Here's the point.  CREATE!  THINK!  There is no problem

or situation that can outwit you if you really put your mind

to work.



=============================================================



     One of the most damaging problems with small businesses

is their inability to collect delinquent accounts.  What does

"The Master" have to say about that?  Well, here it is

directly from the guru of collections himself. . .



     Do you remember I said in my promo material I would show

you ways of collecting those tough to collect debts.

Remember that?  Well, here's a trick that works fairly well:



     Tell the debtor you have waited a long time for your

money.  Tell them you are going to have no choice but to turn

them over for collection if they can't co-operate.  Ask for a

date when you can expect payment. . .and then ask them to

send you a check so you can get your accountant off your

butt.  Tell them, you will hold the check until a time when

they will call you and allow you to process it on through the

bank.  If they are still reluctant. . .tell them to send you

a check and they don't even have to sign it.  Again say, "I

just have to get my accountant (superiors) off my back."

This will usually be agreeable and you will simply ask him to

call you once he is ready to make the check good.  He'll be

thinking you can't do anything with an unsigned check, just

like you are...



     Now, here's the trick.  Once you get their check, call

their bank.  Tell them you have a check on Mr. So and So and

you need to be sure the check is good. If it isn't, then wait

and try again another day.  When it is good and there are

enough funds in the account to get your money, here's what

you do:



     Write or type the word "over" on the line where the

signature would normally appear.  On the back, type "lack of

signature guaranteed." . .and add your company's name, and

your name and title. Then endorse or stamp your deposit

notice on the check and cash or deposit it.  This guarantees

your bank that you'll take back the check as a charge against

your account if it isn't honored.  Most banks will then

process the check and remit the funds.



     Now you've got your money. . . and even if the bank

doesn't honor the check, you've got a tangible item to show

there is no dispute of the debt, and the debtor admits he

owes the money.  If you must pursue further collection

action, this check will help you to collect your money.  I

wonder if this is legal?  Ask your lawyer.  .  . .  .I just

work here . .  .



               You Still Don't Have Your Money?



     What now?  Ok.  Here's what I would do.  I would put the

debtor under investigation.  I would run a "trash run" (grab

his/her garbage) for a couple of weeks and see what they're

doing with their money.



     Could it be they're spending their money on drugs,

expensive clothing, jewelry, etc.?  The garbage will yield

information about an individual's lifestyle, spending habits,

and perhaps a few "inside secrets" they don't want the world

to know.  Things that may give you a bit of an edge when it

comes to negotiations . . . like, the discovery of drug

paraphernalia . . . Certainly, if they can afford drugs, they

can pay you.  Right?



     Suppose you research records on the debtor and learn

that he is delinquent in child support payments in another

state.  Or, maybe he is wanted for traffic violations or some

other crime.  Perhaps you discover a little "hanky-panky" is

going on at his work place and you learn enough to where he

could encounter some real serious problems . . . Do you

suppose you might could negotiate some kind of deal?



     I hope you're not thinking that I would suggest

blackmail.  I am not saying you should blackmail anyone.  But

remember, once you've filed suit, during the discovery

proceedings you will be asked a lot of questions.  If the

debtor learns that you know about their tax evasion . . .

drug use . . . misuse of corporate funds, etc., he will

usually have an instant change of heart and pay up.



     Larger accounts are naturally the more difficult ones.

However, if everything's on the up & up and you can verify

the debt, it can be rather simple . . .



=============================================================



     You know how time has a way of creeping up on you?  And

sometimes you just have to have those fast answers.  Like

background information or other records from across the

country?  There are ways. . .



                BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS



     Actually it's easier than you think.  If you've been

reading the Inside Secrets you already know a lot of ways to

get into some pretty "hard core" information.  You simply

can't trust people . . . you have to check them out!



     Would you walk across the Mojave Desert without taking

enough water?  Would you schedule a flight to Iraq without

considering the chance of trouble?  I wouldn't--and I don't

believe anyone in their right mind would.  But, think about

it!  Over a hundred people at the seminar raised their hand

as someone who has suffered loss at the hand of a con.  This

can be avoided.



     In fact, anything can be done, if you know how.  You can

handle a King Cobra, if you know what you're doing.  Whoa!

Wait a second!  You say, not me?  Well, what if you used a

burlap sack?  You see, there is a way!  But, every time we

make a move forward without weighing out the possibilities. .

. the facts" we take the chance of getting burned.  Do you

see what I'm saying?  Never walk into any deal blindfolded.

You have to know the facts about the business: the location,

the people you will be dealing with, the accountant, and on

and on.  You will almost always save yourself a lot of

trouble by simply doing a little footwork.



     If you want to accomplish a positive end result, you

have to use plain old good business sense.  You have to put

on your "Sherlock cloak and hat" and check things out.  And

if you don't know how . . . well . . . frankly, that proves

you're already doing great subscribing to my newsletter.



     I know this may be "off the beaten path" but I believe

the subscribers to my newsletter are the smartest, most sane,

savvy, sharp, business people on earth. . ..



     Now, whether you're considering marriage, divorce, a

lawsuit, a merger, a partnership, or simply trying to get the

"inside scoop" on someone for reasons of your own, a

background investigation is almost always the first thing to

do. It can literally make the difference between success and

catastrophe.  Let me give you a few scenarios where a

background investigation is in order.



     Suppose you are looking at an investment opportunity

that is so good that it's one of those we call "too good to

be true." What do you know about the investment company . . .

the prospective partner--the trends in the industry. How long

have they been in business?  How accurate are their profit

and loss statements?  Who are the officers of the

corporation, and what are their backgrounds--their

failures and successes?



     Maybe you are an employer in consideration of hiring a

new employee?  Is all the information on the application true

and factual?  Will he or she be a liability risk?  Is he or

she a habitual claimant looking for a chance to sue you?



     Perhaps you are an employee looking for employment with

a promising and rising company.  Maybe you are a seasoned

employee being transferred to a different location.  Is this

new location stable, will you have job security?  Are you

making a good move?



     What about personal relationships?  Are you considering

marriage?  Is he or she authentic and truthful?  Can you

trust this person for life?  Are there secrets . . .  things

that he or she is not telling you?



     Are you involved as a plaintiff or defendant in

litigation?  Often there are facts about the opposing party

that would help you win the case?  How do you find out?  I'll

show you.



                PONDER BEFORE YOU WANDER . . .



     Do you know what is the oldest profession on earth?  No

.  .  .  No . . . No!  I know exactly what you're thinking.

Prostitution.  Right?  Well, maybe it is, but following

closely behind is the art of "Investigating" . . .  Gathering

data about one's opponents dates back to ancient biblical

time.  And guess what?  Although we now have hi-tech

surveillance gear, on-line computer data research capability,

and all the other modern technology, the art of investigating

still requires some old-fashioned "gum-shoe" preparation.



              PLAN YOUR WORK--WORK YOUR PLAN



     Before you begin seeking answers on someone or something

you need to develop your "road map."  Ask yourself and write

out the legendary 6 guides: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and

How?  If you get the answers to these 6 variables of each

question you have, you will have left no stone unturned.



     Once you have written all the questions you want

answered, ponder very carefully as you ask yourself the 6

variables of every question you may have.  Write down your

questions.  Then repeat each question, filling in the who's,

what's, when's, where's, why's and how's.



     There's no use investigating if you don't know what

answers you want to find.  By carefully planning an

investigation, not only are you laying out a road map to

conducting a successful inquiry, but you are also clearly

defining your primary concerns. (Probably a few you've

overlooked before.)



     From birth our minds are often programed to overlook

even the most obvious.  The planning of an investigation is

the most important phase.  Take your time, write down every

question you would ask the target of the investigation if

given that liberty.  Go slow, diligently, and very carefully.



   Now.  Do you have your road map?  Ok. Then let's begin.



     First, let's look at what we're trying to get.  A

background investigation usually consists of a compilation of

facts--much like unto a personal "dossier."  The only

difference is the subject usually provides these facts, but

now, you are gathering the "real facts."



     A complete personal dossier should consist of the

following information--name, address, telephone number, birth

date and place of birth, education, vocation, avocation,

family, social security, driver's license number, vehicles

owned, property owned, credit rating and history, opinions of

business associates and neighbors, hobbies, habits,

restaurants preferred, profile of friends, profile of

enemies, litigations, previous addresses, unusual mail,

magazines favored and subscribed to, club memberships,

medical history, and any other information you can find.



     A company dossier should consist of the following

information--name, address including parent and sister

companies, telephone numbers, key employees and their

personal statistics, owners, corporate officers, products or

services, suppliers, buyers, competition, profit and loss

statement, Standard & Poor's ratings, Better Business Bureau

standing, Dunn and & Bradstreet rating, real property owned,

prior or active litigations, growth rate, security, employee

morale, and any other suitable and important data.



                    INFORMATION IS POWER!



     The cost factor in gathering data is important to you

and should be.  That's why you subscribe to the Inside

Secrets, to learn how to get the "inside scoop" cost

effectively.  However, when compared to the possible losses

there's no comparison to the greater risk of not having the

information.



                  GATHERING THE INFORMATION



     Begin with known sources.  You may have access to data

within your reach that you're overlooking.  It is a common

practice for investigators to develop sources in police

departments, insurance companies, credit bureaus,

manufacturers, etc.



     It is always good to have friends (or contacts) who are

knowledgeable in different occupations.  If your inquiry is a

legal matter involving his or her areas of expertise, their

knowledge can sometimes prove invaluable.  The defense or

prosecution of a legal matter almost always requires the

investigator to provide detailed "expert" information.



     I have always maintained what I like to call my

"intelligence files."  They include hundreds of sources in

different businesses and agencies, as well as the names and

addresses of every client, witness, experts, attorneys, etc.,

with whom we have associated.  Should we have a need for

information in one of their areas of expertise . . .  or even

in their geographic area, this compilation of information is

often priceless.



     Continue with unknown sources.  Hang out at a local bar

or restaurant that you know the target often visits.  Pick up

the garbage.  Read the previous issues of my newsletter. . .



             GET INFORMATION AND TAKE SHORT-CUTS.



     For example: Suppose you were trying to gain insight on

a certain person with whom you are considering a business

venture.  There are thousands of data files that contain

information on each of us.  With the know-how or the

contacts, you can compile a complete dossier on that person

in only a matter of minutes.  Imagine the look on your

prospective partners face when you know of his criminal

record. . .  or the multiple D.U.I.'s on his driving record,

or the newspaper story about his tragic accident that took

4 lives. . .



     When I started the Investigative Technology Agency, I

searched for the very best sources of computer information to

gain maximum benefit for the most reasonable price.

Eventually we were paying thousands of dollars a month in

subscription, on-line, and search fees.  So, I launched an

investigation to find companies like mine who were interested

in a co-op effort to get access to multiple databases without

the individual monthly dues and on-line fees.



     Finally, I found several information providers who could

supply almost any kind of information I wanted almost

anywhere in the world.  I have recently discovered we can

even get mailing lists through one of our sources.  So, a few

months ago I sought a deal with some of our information

providers to run inquiries for my subscribers at a volume

discounted rate. They, like the bureaucrats, believe their

information is proprietary.  They release this information

only to law enforcement authorities or licensed private

investigators.



                      NO ONE TRUSTS YOU!



     So, as I have never allowed anyone or anything to get in

the way of progress, I've remedied that problem.  I've

subscribed to the necessary data sources (over 600 in total)

and added the necessary staff to service exclusively our

subscribers through my agency. We call it this new service:



                          FAX-CESS



     That's right, Fax-Access.  When you need information on

anyone, or any company, simply fill in the blanks on the form

we provide, check off the types of searches you want, and fax

to our office at (601) 783-2111.  We run your inquiry through

"E.  T." (That's the name of our main computer) and out pops

the report, which we will immediately fax back to your

office.  We can do these searches very inexpensively.



     Unlike the bureaucratic jerks who feel you shouldn't

have access to such information, we completely trust in your

integrity.  And as always, stand for what I believe.

Since we happen live in the "information age" then let's use

it!  Let's utilize every tid-bit of information in our day to

day business affairs.  You are entitled to any information

you need.



                        PUBLIC RECORDS



     The ability to access public records via computer makes

the job a whole lot easier, but there are alternatives, some

of which aren't available through "Fax-Cess." For example:



Marriage Records:  Marriage records will provide the name and

address information of the spouse and information about their

birth place and date and other information about their

parents.  Often you will discover that the spouse may have

been previously married and divorced, and guess what?  The

prior husband or wife will usually reveal a ton of "juicy"

facts on your target.  (Usually about 50% truth . .  . the

rest coca.)  In the "Marriage License" files, you will also

find names and addresses of those who witnessed the wedding.



Registrar of Voters Records: The voter's registration files

will usually contain name, address, occupation, description,

state of birth, registration date, and the signature of the

target.



Criminal Files: While criminal records are available via

data-base research, they are also available on a state wide

basis in many states, simply for the asking.  Criminal record

searches are the heart of good background investigations.

These records can dramatically diminish your risk in almost

any venture.  They are accessible through state and county

repositories.



     If you are a business person who needs frequent

background information on prospective employees, I would

recommend you obtain a copy of A Guide To Background

Investigations, published by Financial Control Publishing,

Inc., 1820 South Boulder Place, Tulsa, OK 74119, or ask your

local book store to order ISBN # 0-941233-14-6.  This manual

will provide you with the addresses of state and county

criminal repositories, as well as the names and addresses of

other record compilers, such as, Workman's Compensation

Records, Driving Records, College and University records for

education verification, etc.



                       ANOTHER WAY. . .



     Let me reveal a secret of how to get facts fast.  This

is a great plan to use in emergency situations.  Start with a

plan as I instructed.  Quickly review the information on your

target.  Verify the data by name, address, and phone number.



     Once you ascertain the address, go to your local library

and review the various "Criss-Cross" directories to match

name with telephone number.  Next, refer to the "City

Directory" usually published by R. L. Polk Co., and/or Cole

Directories.  Here you will be able to determine the names,

addresses, employment status, etc., of all the nearby

neighbors.



     Most of the directories are published annually and are

updated with new information.  This leaves a great paper

trail that can help you get "history" on your target.

Use the older directories (usually maintained for years

prior) and go back from year to year checking out your

target.  You may discover previous information from years

past, i.e., spouses names, previous addresses, prior

telephone numbers, prior employers, etc.



     With all this new information and a little creativity in

designing a suitable pretext you could really get the inside

scoop, particularly from neighbors who didn't like the

target.  Trust me, people will rattle off anything about your

target if you are prepared with the right pretext.



     Another thing about pretext--it is just as important to

plan your pretext as it is to play your investigation. A

seasoned private investigator has mastered the art of "little

white lies" that we call pretext.  You, on the other hand,

will need to design and carefully write out your pretext.

There's nothing that will destroy the effectiveness of a

pretext quicker than stuttering, trying to remember the

details of who you are and why you are calling.



     Always design a pretext that will allow you to go either

way with regard to "liking" or "disliking" your target.  This

will allow you the flexibility to "share" the emotional

feelings of the person you are questioning.  Have you ever

noticed how no-one will say anything bad about someone until

they realize that you too don't like the person in question?

Then they will open up and man . . . talk about a "low-down

piece of scum."



     If your target is a "high-profile" subject, you may dig

up articles from newspapers (local, state, and national) Most

libraries maintain what is called a "newspaper morgue" or

micro-film of the past issues of newspapers.    The New York

Times Index, the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, The

Business Periodicals Index, the General Science Index, etc.,

are great references for this kind of research.  You mean big

time P. I.'s actually refer to such references.  You bet they

do.  Knowing what reference to go to can help you get

information fast.

=============================================================



     Mr. Enlow is notorious for his determination to WIN

every case in which he is involved. . . He once shared the

following story in is writing that is certainly worthy of

mention.  While it may be the nastiest trick of all, it

works!



=============================================================



    Now let's talk about the nastiest, yet most effective

means of gathering inside information. . .



     The most disgusting, nasty, smelly, and foul places in

the world is where private investigators will usually find

their best inside information, or the clues that put them on-

top of information.  Yes, you guessed it... the garbage.

They will usually ask one of the neighbors to determine the

day and time of garbage pick-up and then early that morning

intercept the target's trash.



     You wouldn't believe what they often find.  Along with

the target's discarded mail, (which has their name right on

the envelope) they sometimes find marijuana seeds,

drug paraphernalia, credit card receipts, personal notes,

pictures, broken VCR tapes with really hot porno flicks,

alcohol containers, the target's signature, on and on and

on...



      They know what the target likes to eat, where they eat,

what they read, what church they attend, what job contracts

they've had, and overall almost any and everything you could

possibly dream of learning about an individual.



     I realize this is a very distasteful job, but when your

butts in the sling or hundreds of thousands of dollars are on

the line, who cares?



     Beware of what you throw in the garbage.  I burn my

garbage.  However, that is illegal in some places, so, I

would recommend that you take your garbage to the dumpster

yourself.  Place it in a pile with a number of other garbage

bags, so that yours is not easily picked up.



     If you suspect that you are under surveillance or

investigation, consider planting false information in the

garbage.  This is like inviting the investigator right into

your web, assuming he or she knows what they're doing.

(Sometimes, P.I.'s  stumble right over the garbage, not

realizing that it could be valuable evidence.)



     If you suspect someone is checking you out, throw a page

of your appointment planner in the garbage indicating you

will be at such and such place at a certain time.  This will

usually help you determine the identity of the person making

inquiries about you.



     For example, on one occasion I knew I was under

investigation, so I planted a sheet off my desk calendar

in the trash.  It indicating that I would be at a certain

hotel, at a certain time, on a certain date.  I placed a

video camera in the window of the hotel and connected it to

the television where I could lay back and watch any cars that

may be circling the hotel.



     I recorded the license numbers of the ones I found

suspicious, and in no time at all, I knew exactly who was

investigating me.  Then, the real setup began. I was able to

plant even more information which led to a false report, and

subsequently, cost him considerably.



     Even now,  I have a client who has a business dispute

with one of his clients.  It has become a real cat-fight,

particularly since they have now attacked my client's

integrity and done everything they can to cause him trouble.

He "trashed" them!



     Well, to make a long story short, do you remember me

telling you that NO ONE CAN STAND A FULL SCALE INVESTIGATION?

Well, that advice is real.  Be careful who you tackle.  He or

she may be up to date on tricks like the garbage check,

records searches, neighborhood inquiries, and who knows what

else.



     This guy really screwed up.  You see, my client simply

took advantage of the situation, grabbing up every tid-bit of

information he could find, even the garbage.  Using that

information, he now has proof that the guy has been defaming

his character.  He even has enough legal elements of proof to

pursue litigation to recover damages.  Turn about is fair

play!



     You see, the garbage may be a distasteful way of getting

information, but sometimes it pays big dividends. As I have

always said, there isn't a problem without a solution, it

just takes a little creativity... a little thinking... a

little determination.



=============================================================



     Sometimes when the world seems to be closing in. . . we

just want to disappear.  Have you ever felt that way?  Well,

Mr. Enlow wrote the book on it.  How about a little taste of

how you can actually disappear and establish a new identity.

Ok, let's do it. . .

=============================================================



                DISAPPEAR--NEVER TO BE FOUND!



     I get a load of letters from people trying to find

missing persons.  Actually, I'm not sure if I have more

letters from people trying to find someone, or from those who

want to know how to disappear and never be found.  Who am I

going to write to if you all move off and change your

identities?  Oh well, let's talk a little about missing

persons, why people disappear and some of the reasons.



     Everyday, there are hundreds of people who are reported

missing across the U. S.  How many are missing on purpose?

Well my guess is, the greatest percentage.



     I've felt like disappearing at times, haven't you?  I

think we all have.  Statistics indicate that the majority of

missing persons disappear because of an unhappy marriage.

Mostly husbands, and sometimes wives, obviously "get fed up"

with their partner.  They will often stay gone forever.  And

the interesting thing is, the spouse won't report their mate

as missing.  They're glad to get rid of the rascal.  The

other percentage of missing persons consists partially of

fugitives or escaped prisoners and missing children.



     Rather than try to go into the hundreds of tracing

techniques, I'll get right to the point and tell you how

those who have successfully disappeared did so.



                     FIRST THINGS FIRST.



Well. . .tell me. . .



1) Are you ready for a new name?

2) Are you ready to say good-bye to all the

   Family\Friends\Attorneys\CPA's\Wife, Children and everyone

   else for that matter?

3) Ready For A New Car?

4) Ready To Launch A New Career?



                     The Number One Rule!

                Plan Your Disappearance ALONE!



                     The Number Two Rule!

         You Must Completely Detach . . . You're Dead

             (No One Ever Said It Would Be Easy)



     Yes, your life is history . . . No more family, Bills,

Banks, or contacts whatsoever with the old life.  No more

credit . . . no more nothing . . . you've been born again.



     If you really want to disappear and never be found, you

have to follow the rules.  Trust me, if someone hands over a

$5000 retainer fee and pays my customary $200 an hour, I will

find you if you didn't.



So here's your chance to do it right.



1) Sell Everything - (Discretely if possible)



2) Whatever you can't sell, get rid of, that includes Cars-

   Bikes-Boats-All personal possessions including that nice

   unique jewelry.  (Remember, You Asked For This).



     Why do you have to sell everything, even your jewelry?

Well, it's like this:  If I were asked to locate you with

little or no leads, I would try to find something unique

about you, your apparel, your jewelry, etc.



     If I wish to find you, I would run classified ads

offering a reward for the person who "stole my unusual custom

designed diamond ring with initials on the top!" Think about

it!  If I ring callers in on an 800 number, and watch the

call count, I'm most likely to get a good lead to where you

are.  Right?  So you see, you can keep no identifiers!



                          NEXT. . .



     Move by train - Alone - Always remember: A Secret is

something only one person knows!  That person is you!

Frequent flyer points are not something to accrue at a time

like this.  If you want it done right, remember, fewer people

expect you to travel by train.



     Now.  Are you going to use your own name to purchase

your escape tickets?  Of course not!  So what do you do?

Well, first you order the catalog of Delta Press.  They can

be reached at 501-862-4984 or by writing P. O. Box 1625,

Dept. 92S., 215 S. Washington, El Dorado, AR 71731.  They

have a couple of really great books of sources for obtaining

new identification documents, from birth certificates to

Divorce Papers to Clergy Credentials.  They also sell what

they call their "New I. D. Kit."  It's really hot for anyone

who may need to establish a complete new identity.



               NEW IDENTITY . . . ALTERNATIVES



     When it comes to establishing a new identity there are

several ways one can go about it.  Let's touch on these

briefly:



     a.  Assume an existing identity.  DON'T DO IT!



     b.  Use your original identity if you are an adopted

         child.



     c.  Find an identity.  This is the easier one, and most

         difficult to track.  One would simply go to a

         cemetery in their new town and try to find a grave

         of someone who was born at about the same year. He

         or she would then order a copy of their birth

         certificate on stationary using "the deceased

         parents'" names on it.  I would be sure to use a

         mail drop address in the event someone's suspicion

         is aroused.



     Once you have a new birth certificate, it isn't so

difficult to go to the Social Security Office and get a new

Social Security number.  Just explain that you and your

parents have been living in Canada and you've never applied.



     Getting your driver's license follows after that.  These

people seem to be the most curious of all.  The best way to

deal with them is to "take your time."  First, take a local

Driver's Education class, and then your teacher will go with

you to get your license.  The license office will then for

some unknown reason seldom ever hassle you in their presence.



     Should anyone get curious and begin asking questions,

remember that you are an "Army Brat" who lived in an area

where fewer people own cars  (Some place very remote but

foreign.  I would also make sure there's an Army base there!)

and you've never had a drivers licence.  Wait--You drive so

well!???  Remember, you've never driven. Slam on brakes! Gas

the engine in park!  Play it up!  Play it up!



     So, now what do you do?  You get established in a nice

secluded area.  Get your story down pat (to cover all

possible questions) and then you get a job.  Have your story

down pat regarding your past employers in England?



     Then, set up house and buy a new car.  Be sure to

register it under your mail box address.  By the way it

should be registered in your company name: like "J Supply,"

or something like that.



     Rent your apartment under your "girlfriend's" name.

(Actually, some "bar fly" for you guys, and one "stud muffin"

for you ladies)  Pay them $100.00 or so not to tell anyone

about you and be sure to thank them as you explain how you

were in so much danger.  "My husbands so crazy" or "My wife

is bleeding me dry - I just needed to get away!"



   Now. Remember these most important rules . . .



       Under No Circumstances Do You Ever Look Back.



        DO NOT FORWARD ANY MAIL OR ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS!



   You are a new person, forget the past!  Change your

appearance--beard--hair color--associations, etc.



   And always remember--You're dead... You'll have to

renew your subscription under your new identity...



                               Peace.



                  Michael E. Enlow

                  Private Investigator/Consultant



=============================================================



Now.... here's a chance to get some more creative

investigation techniques FREE:



            Free Report By Michael Enlow, Private

          Investigator Reveals 11 Inside Secrets

               That Can Help You Get Almost

                    Anything On Anybody!



     Now, a lot of people have asked for this report and for

a lot of different reasons.  I don't know, exactly, what the

reason was in your case, but let me ask you:  Do you have any

of the following types of people in your life?



     *    Jealous competitors who want your trade secrets?

     *    Ambitious employees who want your success?

     *    Competitive co-workers who want to get an edge?

     *    Unscrupulous partners who just want your money?

     *    An unfaithful spouse who's compromising your self-

           respect?

     *    An unhappy spouse plotting divorce?

     *    Clients who arouse your suspicion with chronic late

          payments, bounced checks, questionable ethics, lame

          excuses?

     *    People who don't arouse your suspicion but

          nevertheless control your future (such as bankers

          controlling your cash, accountants controlling your

          books, manufacturers controlling your products,

          etc.)?



     Do you have money in any financial institution in the

U.S.?  Are you investing in a company or venture you can't

keep tabs on daily?  Are you writing a book?  Inventing new

products?  Enjoying hobbies or activities you'd rather not

have anyone know about?  Are people lying to you?  Do you owe

people money?  Do people owe you money?  Have you ever been

conned?  Are you suspicious, paranoid, or even just plain

curious about how this crazy new world is running just beyond

the reach of your senses?



     If so, and if you'd like to have a profound advantage in

just about every situation you come upon, this is going to be

some of the most interesting and exciting reading you've ever

done.



     What I'm going to tell you about in this letter, is how

to acquire and use, what I like to call, the "information-

edge".  The information-edge, is nothing more than the

advantage you gain by knowing something that someone else

does not know.  And in the information-driven society we live

in today, this advantage can quite often be the difference

between sink or swim in practically every area of life-

business, personal, financial, or other.



     To gain this advantage, you need to have more than a

open line to the town gossip.  You need specific, high-

powered, techniques and strategies that allow you to find out

things your competitors, co-workers, etc. don't know how to

find out.



     That's where I can help you.  You see, gathering

information is what I do for a living.  As a private

investigator, people come to me to find out things they don't

know how to find out for themselves.  I then employ little-

known (sometimes, embarrassingly simple) techniques and

"secret" sources to uncover those answers.



     What kind of information can I find out?  Actually, a

better question might be, "What can't I find out?"  With

today's technology and a little know-how just about anything

about any company, any person, or any topic can be learned

(and in an astonishing short amount of time).  Information

that can help you on your job, give you answers in your

personal life, or provide a crucial advantage f or your

business.



     In no time flat, I could have a file a foot thick on you

just by knowing your name and hometown. (Including things you

didn't even think were possible to know--and without ever

leaving my desk!)



     What I am going to do, is list several (much more than

eleven) techniques I've learned, invented, and incorporated

in my investigations over the years that will probably blow

your mind.  If these concepts intrigue you, I'd like to

immediately send you (absolutely free) a special insider's

information package which explains and details all of these

ideas (plus dozens of others) thoroughly and tells you how to

use them yourself.



     Here's what I'm talking about:



1.   How to use a simple (and legal) one-hour background

     check that can turn up the most amazing things about

     that potential new employee, spouse, or associate of

     yours.  Does he or she have a criminal record?  Are

     those credentials for real?  Is he or she a

     habitual claimant looking for a chance to sue you?



2.   A fast and easy way to get the exact forwarding address

     information of anyone.



3.   An extremely little-known "magic" phone number (used

     almost exclusively by P.I.'s) that will help you track

     down almost anyone (even if they're hiding).



4.   How to get unpublished telephone numbers.  Legally!



5.   Dozens more tips on skip-tracing.  How to find virtually

     anyone.



6.   How to get your name on the mailing list of every

     competitive company in the world.  (Get the scoop on all

     the million dollar ideas and marketing tests they

     develop and use that knowledge to your advantage.)

     Espionage?  No, common sense!



7.   How to get free up-to-the-minute knowledge on virtually

     anything from the largest and most powerful research

     organization in the world!



8.   How to tap into the most sophisticated business

     information system ever conceived!  (You don't have to

     wait to learn this one. See the News Flash at end of

     this document.)



9.   How to virtually eliminate employee theft.



10.  A powerful (and very sneaky) way to collect all money

     owed to you.  It works like a charm almost every time

     (and without breaking any knuckles).



11.  How to detect drug abuse without the knowledge of your

     suspect.



12.  How to find and prosecute a con artist. (Get back not

     only your loss but a hefty fee as well!)



13.  How unopened mail is read.



14.  Suspect an employee of selling trade secrets?  Spouse

     having an affair?  Learn the fastest and easiest way to

     find out if two people know each other, if they're

     communicating, and what they're communicating about

     (they won't even have a clue you're on to them!).  No

     illegal bugging or tapping necessary.  In fact, you

     won't even need to get out of your chair!



15.  How to hear everything that happened in your office

     while you are away (using a nifty technique to get 10

     hours of recording time from a regular 90 minute

     cassette!).



16.  Dozens of innovative money-collecting tips that work

     like a charm.



17.  If you have to sue someone to get your money... two

     shrewd techniques that will almost always get them to

     pay up without having to go to court.



18.  A mind-boggling trick for taking photos in the middle of

     the night that look like they were taken in broad

     daylight!  (No special film needed!)



19.  Has someone taken out an invisible "office extension" of

     your phone line to monitor your calls?  Ma Bell may be

     an unwitting accomplice, but she can also tell you who's

     involved.



20.  How burglars pick their targets and several simple,

     inexpensive ways to dramatically reduce your chances of

     being robbed.



21.  Do you use a cordless phone?  Beware!  Anyone within

     miles can eavesdrop on both sides of the conversation

     using an everyday police scanner. . .



22.  Even more unbelievable: Simply by switching two wires

     (or by a common malfunction), the base of your cordless

     phone becomes a highly effective bugging device that

     transmits (for anyone to hear) everything that happens

     in your house or office 24 hours a day!



23.  Check you've been waiting for arrives unsigned.  Send it

     back for signature, right?  Wrong!  Deposit it fast.

     It's what you write on it that counts.  (Totally legal.)



24.  Instant tip-off on an application that a prospective

     employee is probably lying.



25.  Rifling your garbage is a common way investigators find

     out almost everything about you and slimeballs get their

     mitts on your customer names, credit card numbers and

     your signature.  Even shredding machines can't totally

     stop them, but a few "tricks" can protect you (and even

     turn it to your advantage).



26.  Shoplifters.  Who are they?  How can you detect them?

     How do they shoplift?  How can you prevent them?  And,

     how do you apprehend and prosecute them?



27.  How to get the street address of a P. O. box holder just

     by filling out a simple form.



     Have you ever had someone know something they couldn't

possibly have known?  Listen.  There are hundreds of

electronic surveillance equipment manufacturers, in the

United States alone, producing massive amounts of newer,

smarter, tinier, harder to find, impossible to trace, and

easier-to-use espionage products every day.  (Radio

Shack,alone, sells thousands of phone-tapping devices.)  



     Someone is using this equipment, and, increasingly,

there's a good chance somebody is using it on you.  Scary,

isn't it?



     Don't be naive.  You can learn how these devices work,

how to detect them, and easy-to-take precautions that will

virtually eliminate the chance of anyone using them on you:



28.  How to use a regular voltage/ohm meter to determine

     whether or not your phone is being tapped.



29.  How to make your cordless telephone conversations much

     less detectable.



30.  How a common nail and a piece of wire can be used for

     listening in on a phone call... from outside the house!



31.  Four simple rules you should always follow to guarantee

     the absolute best protection from espionage, and

     surveillance.



32.  Scads of surveillance devices, the differences between

     them, how they're used... and, of course... how to stop

     them.



33.  A dozen ways tape recorders alone can be used to damage

     you (or give you just the ammo you need).



          Example:  During delicate business or legal

negotiations, someone may have a tape recorder in his or her

briefcase with a microphone element glued to a small hole.

He or she will exit the room for a break, leaving the locked

briefcase there on the table--recording everything the other

side has to say!  Later, of course, that "private"

conversation tells them just what wanted to know.  The

victims are dumfounded.



     It is part of my job (along with my associates... of over 600

of the brightest P.I.'s in the country) to keep up on all the

latest, smartest, and most astonishing underworld gadgets

that come along.  Some of these devices can be very dangerous

when used against you.  Some very useful for your protection.



     Here's just a few examples of the "James Bond-type"

stuff that's out there:



34.  The "Bug Smasher":  An amazing device from Israel that,

     when hooked to your phone, instantly renders almost all

     listening devices totally useless.



35.  The CN stun gas security system:  Possibly the most

     potent method on Earth for eliminating burglary.



36.  Several devices con artists, spouses, competitors,

     employees, criminals, partners, or anyone can get at

     your local Radio Shack and how they are used to bug your

     house, track your car, and tap your phone.  (And how to

     stop them.)



37.  A very effective (and legal) phone device you can use to

     find out just about everything you wanted to know about

     your lines--if and when employees are abusing your

     phone, how many calls come in that are not answered

     immediately, who's calling who (and when), and much

     more.



38.  Video Cameras that can tape through a hole the size of a

     panel nail!



39.  The rifle microphone:  Hear whispers hundreds of feet

     away!



40.  One of the most powerful and dangerous surveillance

     devices of all:  Simply connect it to your home or

     office phone.  Then, when you're away, call that line,

     and key in a touch tone before the ringer goes off.  It

     will turn on the mouth piece just like the phone was off

     the hook.  You'll hear everything within earshot-shot

     and no one will know you're there!



     In your free insider's info package, you'll

learn about these gadgets and many more (every bit as

sneaky), plus, where you can get them and how to use them

correctly.



     Do you ever have to deal with lawyers?  Well, I do.  

A lot.  In fact, I'm actually a "legal investigator".  I've 

worked closely with hundreds of attorneys, and I know 

a lot about how they operate...



                 Including Some Things

            They'd Rather I Kept To Myself!



     But, of course, I'm not going to.  Instead, I'm going to

reveal some insider's techniques I've learned that can,

literally, save you thousands of dollars in legal fees and

enormous amounts of time and hassle.  Make no mistake... this

is juicy stuff.  And if you work with attorneys to any

degree at all, you need to know it.  Examples:



41.  Breach of contract = lawyers, headaches, and hassle,

     right?  Wrong!  You can easily write all your contracts

     so as to almost always prevent the need for legal action

     if broken.  (Lawyers could do this of course.  But it

     just wouldn't make good business sense.)



42.  What to say during an initial consultation that will

     allow you to hire the very best attorneys money can

     buy... for a small fraction of their normal retainer!

     (Just hearing you have the "big guns" can often times

     cause the other side to beg for a settlement!)



43.  How and where to get a little-known publication that is

     considered to be the best book ever written about

     lawyers.  In it are hundreds of secrets they don't want

     you to know!  If you have to deal with attorneys in any

     way, this book will revolutionize the way you do

     business.



     Sooner or later, you (or someone close to you) might be

in a serious predicament that requires some real private eye

"footwork".  (Or, maybe you'll be extremely curious about

something that just can't be found out in any other way.)

When that happens, you'll be prepared, because I'm going to

show you all the tricks o f the trade when it comes to the

"Magnum P.I." stuff and how to pull them off without a hitch.



     The what to.  The how to.  The when to.  And the when

not to.   Previously undisclosed techniques that will keep

you out of danger and find you the answers you're looking

for, like these:



44.  How a stake out is done.  How to keep from arousing

     suspicions. And how to stay out of trouble.



45.  How to follow someone while driving in the city without

     being spotted.



46.  How to follow someone on foot.



47.  Following someone in a rural area?  How to make your

     vehicle look different every time they turn around.



48.  A bizarre trick that lets you see better in the dark by

     naturally increasing the "night purple" in your eyes.



49.  A professional P.I.'s checklist for undertaking any

     surveillance mission.



50.  Tip-offs that you're being followed.



     And more!



     Using secrets like these, you'll be able to do your own

investigative work better, faster (and a lot cheaper) than 

to hire a detective! After all, many of the same techniques

you'll learn enabled me to retire at the age of 35 -- with 

a success ratio seldom equalled in the industry. And that's 

in spite of the fact that just about all my cases are the 

"impossible" ones abandoned by other investigators.  

I charge $5,000 up front and $100 per hour (plus expenses).



     Some people consider that outrageous, yet people

throughout the country are begging to hire me every day.

I don't tell you all of this to brag, but to establish the fact 

that...



              I'm a Player--Retired at 35 Years

           Of Age.  I Know What I'm Talking About

             And I Want To Share It With You!



     The insider's information package, which explains in

detail all of the 50 concepts mentioned above (plus many

more), consists of two parts.  Part one is a very unique and

very personal three part video training series called, A

PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH MIKE ENLOW.  This was originally

made exclusively for the use of my older brother, Bobby, who

wanted to get into private investigating and wanted me to

show him the ropes.  For this reason, it's a little bit

"rough".  However, I may also add, for this same reason it is

also very powerful--There is information "shortcuts" using

inexpensive alternatives that I would have never shown anyone

BUT MY BROTHER...  There were no producers or directors...



     Just me in front of my camera, pouring out all of my

most cherished trade secrets--describing, delineating, and

even demonstrating tips, tricks, and secrets techniques one

right after another for over 2 1/2 hours... I held nothing

back!  Revealing tricks that I'd only share with my own

brother.



     Part two of your free insider's information package is

my latest book, Private Investigation Made Simple.  In it are

hundreds of my most creative info-gathering shortcuts

(million-dollar techniques that business executives,

entrepreneurs, attorneys, and others have paid as much as two

hundred dollars to get) all boiled down to the core concepts

and ideas or doing it my way--the easy way...  You'll see

information you never expected to see in print and learn how

to do things you never realized were possible.



     Ok, friend. I know, you're asking, why am I willing to

send you this incredible insider's information package... and

send it FREE?  The answer is simple...



                        It's A Bribe!



     It's a shameless bribe to get you to sign up for a trial

subscription to my new newsletter, "Inside Secrets".



     Here's the deal:  I know from my experiences that you

will find the varied nature of my newsletter so valuable that

you will become a client and customer for a long long time. I

want you to become addicted to my way of making life more

enjoyable, successful, secure and become more powerful in

your day to day activities.  So, for a limited time I'm

testing to see how right I am... I believe you will find the

information in the free gifts worth twice my subscription

cost, not counting the powerful info you will receive monthly

over the course of a year.



     So, if you will agree to a 1-year trial subscription to

my newsletter, I will send you the entire insider's

information package I've described above, containing both the

video training, and the book... and...



                     YOU GET THEM FREE!



     All I ask is that you read 3 issues and give me a fair shake...

If you're not absolutely satisfied at the end of the 3 month

period you can cancel your subscription and I will immediately 

send you a complete pro-rata refund...



                And You Will Still Get To Keep

                   The Video And Book--Free!



     However, I know, once you start reading "Inside

Secrets", you'll want to keep getting it forever.  And if any

of the above has intrigued you, I'm sure you will.  Because

every month you will get a fascinating update on the latest,

smartest, trickiest, most down-and-dirty, nitty-gritty

research and investigative strategies known to man--The same

type of information I've described in the 50 concepts

above... only more...and better!



     The right techniques and secret sources to give you

quick answers to your worst problems.



     Look, the days of doing business on "hunches", outside

appearances, and blind trust are gone.  If you want to

compete and get ahead in the fast-paced '90s, you need this

kind of hard-nosed info.  It is not a luxury.  See for

yourself why successful entrepreneurs, professionals, and

business people all over the world are reading every word of

every issue.



     How much is a subscription to "Inside Secrets"?  Well,

I'll give you a hint, even though I've spent over 17 years in

the field developing original strategies--and have poured

many many hours of writing and research into this material,

you can get it all...
