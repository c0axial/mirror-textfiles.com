    THIS FILE WILL MERELY EXPLAIN HOW

YOU CAN GO FISHING QUICKLY, CATCH A

HELL OF A LOT OF FISH IN A SHORT TIME

AND WITH MINIMAL EFFORT, AND <OF

COURSE> BY USE OF AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE!

<NO FUN OTHERWISE, RIGHT!?>  

 

    NORMALLY WHEN YOU GO FISHING WITH

AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE <NORMALLY!?>, YOU

WOULD SIMPLY CHUCK A CLUSTER OF M-80S

OR A FOURTH OF A STICK OF DYNAMITE

INTO THE WATER AND WATCH THE FISH COME

FLOATING UP.  THEN YOU WOULD SCOOP

THEM OFF THE TOP OF THE WATER AND MAKE

HASTE IN YOUR EXIT BEFORE SOMEONE

COMES TO SEE WHAT THE HELL THAT BOOM

WAS.



ANOTHER WAY IS THIS.  YOU WILL NEED THE

FOLLOWING LIST OF MATERIALS:

 

  [1] JAR  <OR CAN>  <WITH LID>

  [2] A LITTLE SODIUM

  [3] A NAIL

  [4] A BUNCH OF COTTON BALLS

 

FIRST - CLEAN OUT THE JAR <OR CAN>.

       MAKE SURE THERE IS NO MOISTURE

       LEFT IN IT.

 

SECOND - PLACE THE SODIUM IN THE

         BOTTOM OF THE JAR <OR CAN>.

 

THIRD - PACK THE REST OF THE JAR <OR

        CAN> WITH THE COTTON BALLS.

        THE AMOUNT OF COTTON BALLS

        BETWEEN THE OPENING AND THE

        SODIUM WILL DETERMINE THE

        LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE THE

        BOOM.

 

FOURTH - IF YOU'RE USING A JAR, PUNCH

         A FEW HOLES <WITH THE NAIL>

         IN THE LID.  NOT A LOT, JUST

         A FEW.  (THE MORE HOLES, THE

         FASTER IT GOES BOOM).

 

FIFTH - WRAP IN AN AIR-TIGHT PLASTIC

        BAG UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO USE

        IT.

 

SIXTH - TOSS IT INTO THE WATER WHERE

        YOU WISH TO DEPTH CHARGE FOR

        FISH <OR WHATEVER.  IT WILL

        THROW UP ABOUT EVERYTHING.> 

        MAKE SURE THE WATER IS DEEP

        ENOUGH, BECAUSE IF IT AIN'T

        YOU WILL GET HURT <<BAD>>.

 

SEVENTH - COLLECT WHATEVER FLOATS

          (PUTTING IT MILDLY) TO THE

          SURFACE..

<< AFTER THE EXPLOSION, YOU IDIOT!! >>

 

IF IT SHOULD FAIL TO GO OFF DO NOT

STICK AROUND... LEAVE IT!

 

EIGTH - LEAVE THE AREA.  FISHING IN

        THIS MANNOR HAPPENS TO BE

        ILLEGAL.

 

[: NOTE :]  THESE SHOULD NEVER BE USED

IN SWIMMING POOLS OR AREAS WITH



 

 

     HAPPY FISHING... <OR HUNTING>
