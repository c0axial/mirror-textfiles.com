This is a great way to waste someone's
disk drive! Read on...

---------------------------------------
Materials:

 1 diskette
 1 razor blade
 1 sheet wet-sanding paper
 1 pen
 1 pair scissors
   super glue
---------------------------------------
Procedure:

Using the razor blade, carefully cut
open the seals on the top rear of the
disk. Flap it open and remove the 
magnetic media.

Turn the sandpaper upside-down. Place
the magnetic media on the back of the
sandpaper and trace it. Then cut out
the circle of sandpaper with the
scissors.

Glue the sandpaper (sand side up) onto
the BACK of the magnetic media. Place
the magnetic media back into the disk
casing so that the sandpaper is on the
bottom.

Glue the flap shut.

Give the disk to the intended vitim.
---------------------------------------
Explanation:

Single-sided disk drives read from the
BOTTOM of the disk, not the top, as 
you may expect. As the read/write head
passes across the spinning sandpaper,
it will be slightly ground beyond any
further read/write capabilities. This
method of revenge has been tested on
various losers and on my school's disk
drives, and works like a charm.


The disk bomb is a wonderful way to get
back at a person you just can't stand,
one who constantly asks for games, etc.

---------------------------------------
Materials:

 1 diskette
 2 blue-tip matches
   clear nail polish
---------------------------------------
Procedure:

Carefully crush the heads of the blue-
tip matches (they must be blue-tip or
this will not work!) into powder. Mix
the powder to be sure all of the blue
igniting chemical that the matches are
treated with is mixed in.

Spread this powder very thinly on the
surface of the disk inside the read/
write access hole.

Carefully pour a very small amount of
the nail polish on the powder and 
spread it out on the disk surface in
the read/write access oval.

Wait about an hour for the nail polish
to dry.

Turn the inside of the disk so that 
the powder mixture is not seen.

Give the disk to the intended victim.
---------------------------------------

If this is done properly, within 30 sec
of boot-up, the friction caused by the
spinning diskette will ignite the pow-
dered sulfur. The burning sulfur will
then ignite the plastic diskette, melt-
ing it, causing a great mess inside the
victim's drive.
