    How to make great smoke bombs



Here is a mixture for great smoke  bombs 4 parts of sugar to 6 parts

potassium nitrate (salt peter).  Heat  over low flame until it melts, stir

well. pour it into future container.   before it solidifes, imbed a few

matches as fuses into the mixture.   One lb. fills a block nicely with thick

white smoke.










          NITROGEN TRI-IODIE



Petroleum jelly and potassium chlorate  in a 1 to 1 ratio by weight makes a

totaly safe when wet compound but is  highly explosive shock sensitive when

dry.  3 grams of potassium iodide 5  grams of iodine in a beaker with 50ml

of water mixed all together. Add 20ml  of ammonium hydroxide (ammonia water 10

%) filter and the resulting solid is  called nitrogen triiodide.  When wet is

very safe but upon drying becomes very  explosive and shock sensitive, to

the point of a feather setting it off.  To set off the above explosives

all you really need to do is put some  of the mixture on or in something and

then drop it sort of like an inpact  bomb.  It explodes on inpact with

another object!







              Jackpotting



JACKPOTTING was done rather  successfully a while back in (you

guessed it) New York.



What the culprits did was: sever  (actually cross over) the line between

the ATM and the host. insert a  microcomputer between the ATM and the

host. Insert a fradulent card into the  ATM.  (card=cash card, not hardware)

What the ATM did was: send a signal to  the host, saying "Hey!  Can I give this

guy money, or is he broke, or is his  card invalid?"  What the microcomputer

did was: intercept the signal from the  host, discard it, send "there's no one

using the ATM" signal.  What the host  did was: get the "no one using" signal,

send back "okay, then for God's sake  don't spit out any money!" signal to

ATM.  What the microcomputer did was:   intercept signal (again), throw it away

(again), send "Wow!  That guy is like  TOO rich!  Give him as much money as

he wants.  In fact, he's so loaded,  give him ALL the cash we have!  He is

really a valued customer." signal.   What the ATM did: what else? Obediently

dispense cash till the cows came home  (or very nearly so).  What the crooks

got: well in excess of $120,000 (for  one weekend's work), and several years

when they were caught.







            Mace Substitute





    3 PARTS: Alchohol

  1/2 PARTS: Iodine

  1/2 PARTS: Salt



 Or:



    3 PARTS: Alchohol

    1 PARTS: Iodized Salt (Mortons)



 It's not actual mace, but it does a  damn good job on the eyes..







              Pool Fun



   First of all, you need know nothing  about pools.  The only thing you need

know is what a pool filter looks like.  If you don't know that.



   Second, dress casual.  Preferably,  in black.  Visit your "friends" house,

the one whose pool looks like fun!!)  Then you reverse the polarity of

his/her pool, by switching the wires  around.  They are located in the back

of the pump. This will have quite an  effect when the pump goes on.  In other

words. Booooooooooommm!  Thats right,  when you mix + wires with - plugs, and

vice- versa, the 4th of july happens  again.



   Not into total destruction??? When  the pump is off, switch the pump to

"backwash".  Turn the pump on and get  the phuck out!  When you look the next

day, phunny.  The pool is dry.  If you  want permanant damage, yet no great

display like my first one mentioned,  shut the valves of the pool off. (There

are usually 2)  One that goes to the  main drain and one that goes to the

filter in the pool.  That should be  enough to have one dead pump.  The pump

must take in water, so when there  isn't any...



    Practical jokes:  these next ones  deal with true friends and there is


*no* permanent damage done.  If you  have a pool, you must check the pool

with chemicals.  There is one labeled  orthotolidine.  The other is labeled

alkaline (ph). You want orthotolidine.  (It checks the chlorine).  Go to your

local pool store and tell them you're  going into the pool business, and to

sell you orthotolidine (a CL detector)  Buy this in great quantities if

possible.  The solution is clear.  You  fill 2 baggies with this chemical.  And

sew the bags to the inside of your  suit.  Next, go swimming with your

friend!  Then open the bags and look  like you're enjoying a piss.  And

anyone there will turn a deep red!   They will be embarrased so much,

Especially if they have guests there!   Explain what it is, then add vinegar to

the pool.  Only a little.  The "piss"  disappears.

              Car Fun



     How to have phun with someone  else's car.  If you really detest

someone, and I mean detest, here's a  few tips on what to do in your spare

time.  Move the windshield wiper  blades, and insert and glue tacks.  The

tacks make lovely designs.  If your  "friend" goes to school with you, Just

before he comes out of school.  Light  a lighter and then put it directly

underneath his car door handle.



     Wait...Leave...Listen.  When you  hear a loud "shit!", you know he made

it to his car in time.



     Remove his muffler and pour  approximately 1 Cup of gas in it.  Put

the muffler back, then wait till their  car starts.  Then you have a cigarette

lighter.  A 30 foot long cigarette  lighter.



     This one is effective, and any  fool can do it.  Remove the top air

filter. That's it!  Or a oldie but  goodie: sugar in the gas tank.  Stuff

rags soaked in gas up the exhaust  pipe.  Then you wonder why your

"friend" has trouble with his/her  lungs.  Here's one that takes time and

many friends.  Take his/her car then  break into their house and reassemble


it, in their living or bedroom.  Phun  eh?  If you're into engines, say eeni

mine moe and point to something and  remove it.  They wonder why something

doesn't work. There are so many  others, but the real good juicy ones

come by thinking hard.







      Department Store Fun reprinted



   Many of the department stores in my  area use a large plastic device stapled

to the clothing as a security  precaution.  Several years ago, an

adventurous friend of mine got ahold  of one of thes somehow, and we took it

apart.  Inside was a heavy paper strip  laminated to aluminum foil (?).

As I recall, this paper strip was  about half an inch wide and 3-1/2

inches long.  When this device got  close to a pillar or column at the

exits of a store, an alarm would sound.

    My friend put this paper in his  wallet, and we had a lot of fun

wandering in and out of various stores  at a local shopping center.  We

would enter when a group of people  would enter, or exit with several other

shoppers all together..  When we  entered a local Sears in the shopping

center in the main corrider of the  indoor mall, a loud bell rang.  A

family with kids was just leaving.   The nearest clerk ran out the entrance

to look at everyone standing around.   A plain clothes security guy appeared

out of nowhere.  Everyone had a good  time.  The next store we went in was

also packed with people and the  manager (?) got paranoid when the alarm

went off.  If you move about  discreetly and don't wear a jacket or

coat, you can liven up the busiest of  stores.  But don't go into an empty

store with one of these in your  wallet.  That's a no-no.  Could please
