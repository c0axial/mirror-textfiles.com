the files that we produce in this series.


Simple Pranks
-------------
   The following ideas are basic ones that everyone should have the balls to
do.

   If you really hate someone, take a bunch of tacks and some fishing line
and go to there house at night (or day if your really gutsy).  Take the tacks
and push them into the door molding.  Then string the fishing line around the
tacks in any way you like.  Then stop by there house in the morning and watch
them try to leave the house.

   Find a nice quiet road in your neighborhood in which only one or two cars
come by every half-hour.  Find two mail boxes or light control boxes that
are across the road from each other.  Take two tin cans (big ones) and some
fishing line and put holes in the cans near the top.  Tie the line through
the cans and put one on one mail box and the other on the other mail box.  
Leave enough string to hang about fender level on the car.  Then watch your
surprise as a car comes by.

   Of course theres the old trick where you put dog shit in a bag, light it on
fire, and leave it one someones porch and ring the doorbell.  For a new twist,
do the above, run to the back door and have a friend tell you when the person
stomps the fire out.  Then ring the back doorbell and make the asshole walk
through the house with dog shit on his shoes.

   Also, take some heavy duty rope or sturdy rope that can stay together when
two people tug on it.  Find two houses whose front doors are right across from
each other.  Tie the rope to one door, run it across the street and tie it to 
the other door.  Then have a friend ring one doorbell while ring the other
doorbell.  Get far enough away and watch a tug-of-war between two neighbors.

School Pranks
-------------

   Try this during a lab when you have to use a Bunsen Burner.  Hold a 
quarter or half-dollar over the burner near the end of the period and then
toss it into the hall when the bell rings.  Somebody will learn real quickly
not to pick up things off the ground.

   If there is some asshole in school that you really do not like then go to
his locker with a tube of crazy glue.  Now it all depends on what you want to
do you can either put glue in the keyhole of his lock, if he has a key lock, 
or you can glue the dial of his lock if he has a combination lock.  Or you can
glue the u-bar of the lock in place.  Now if you really feel like taking a
little time then you can get a rubber and pull it around his lock.  Watch and
see if he even touches it.
   
   There is this stuff called 'skunk' what it basically is is some real smelly
powder that smells real bad and covers a BIG area.  You can pick this stuff up
at any hunting shop.  Now, find a car with a open window, slit the bag and wip
the powder into the car and leave.  You can also do this to the teacher that 
is a major pain in the ass.  Just dump it in his room and stay clear for about
a week.  Dump this stuff through the slots in the locker of the asshole that
you hate.

Bathroom Pranks
---------------

   To get revenge on some dork you hate, have someone go to his house and
sleep over there.  Give him some Saran Wrap and tell him to place it on the
toilet under the two lids.  Make sure that it covers the half of the toilet
near the seat hinges because thats where most guys aim to take a leek. 
Then wait to hear the report about what happened from your friend.

   Go to any bathroom with a tube of Ben Gay or a bottle of Atomic Foam.  I
recommened Atomic Foam.  Spread it all over the toilet seat and leave.  You
probably won't be able to see the results of your prank but you should know
what it will do.  You can also use toothpaste to make the seat slippery.

   The obvious is to flush Cherry bombs down the toilets to wreck the
pluming.

     Well thats about it for now.  If you want to see more files, please leave
E-mail to Elliot Ness at The Inner Sanctum or The Superbird thanx.
