	--------- ALCOHOL BURNER

  Once the Militant has his chemicals, he sets up his still.  It is small,
efficent and safe.  In it he makes things like tear gas, prussic acid and
occasionally distills alcohol.

  First, a flask is fitted with a one-hole rubber stopper.  A short length of
thin glass tubing is inserted into the hole.  A five foot length of thin rubber
tubing is fitted over the glass tube and coiled into the ice bucket and out
through a hole in the bottom.  The end of the tube is fitted over another glass
tube which is in a two-hole stopper stuck into a bottle.  The other hole
contains another glass tube to which is attachedanother length of tubing which
is long enough to reach outside to get rid of any noxious or poisonous fumes.

  The equipment for the still is cheap and simple to get.  Most of it can be
bought from your local drug store.  They carry tubing, stoppers, glass- ware
and many chemicals which they sell freely to doctors, students, etc.  if you
get on good terms with your druggist, and he doesn't know you're a freak, you
can buy most of your stuff from him.

  A ring stand or tripod for the flask is more handy than the can in the
diagram (Above^).  But a tin can with slits cut in it for ventilation and the
removal of the burner is usually adequate.

  The checklist of equipment is:

[1] ALCOHOL LAMP.
[2] RING STAND, TRIPOD, OR TIN CAN.
[3] 500 ML OR LARGER FLASK (PYREX).
[4] ASSORTMENT OF ONE AND TWO-HOLE AND HOLELESS STOPPERS OF VARIOUS SIZES.
[5] ABOUT SIX YARDS OF 3/16" (INTERNAL DIAMETER) RUBBER TUBING.
[6] ABOUT A FOOT OF SIX MILLIMETER (EXTERNAL DIAMETER) LABORATORY GLASS TUBING.
[7] CHILD'S PLASTIC BUCKET.
[8] RECIEVING BOTTLE.

  The hole in the bucket is made slightly smaller so the tube will fit snugly
and prevent leakage.

  Full strength wood alcohol for the lamp can be bought at the drug store.
Rubbing alcohol, although 30% water will burn in the lamp, but not so well.
You can distill the pure alcohol off the water from rubbing alcohol.

  This is best done over a gas or electric stove.  First a large with a ouple
inches of water in it is put on the burner while the others are turned off.

  The still is set up as in the illustration except the recieving bottle is
larger and doesn't need a tube going outside (For distilling alcohol).  The
flask is filledwith rubbing alcohol to just under the neck and set in the pan
of boiling water.

  In this setup a coathanger wire with a loop in it's middle is put over the
neck of the flask, and secured to the sides of the pan.  The reason for this
being that as the alcohol evaporates, the flask gets lighter and lighter until
it rises in the water and topples over, shattering.

  Another consideration is to make shure the tube does not flop over and
collapse.  This can be prevented by hanging a string from the ceiling by which
the the tubing is held above the flask.

  The tubing should be further supported so that it does not touch the hot edge
of the pan and melt.

  When the action starts the alcohol will fairly flow into the collecting
bottle.  WHen it stops, all that is left in the flask is water.  If this were
left alone, water would start dripping, much slower than alcohol, but this is
not wanted.

  This is the only case where you should distill over a stove.	A stove is
Harder to control than an alcohol lamp.  It is also harder to clean up than a
table in case of an accident.

Later on, look for more soon!
