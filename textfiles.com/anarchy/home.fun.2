          Nitroglycerin Recipe

         ----------------------



     Like all chemists I must advise  you all to take the greatest care

and caution when you are doing this.   Even if you have made this stuff

before.



     This first article will give you  information on making nitroglyerin, the

basic ingredient in a lot of  explosives such as straight dynamites,

and geletin dynamites.





Making nitroglycerin



1. Fill a 75-milliliter beaker to the  13 ml. Level with fuming red nitric

acid, of 98% pure concentration.



2. Place the beaker in an ice bath and  allow to cool below room temp.



3. After it has cooled, add to it  three times the amount of fuming

sulferic acid (99% h2so4).  In other  words, add to the now-cool fuming


nitric acid 39 ml. Of fuming sulferic  acid.



   When mixing any acids, always do it  slowly and carefully to avoid

splattering.



4. When the two are mixed, lower thier  temp. By adding more ice to the bath,

about 10-15 degrees centigrade.  (Use  a mercury-operated thermometer)



5. When the acid solution has cooled  to the desired temperature, it is ready

for the glycerin. The glycerin must be  added in small amounts using a medicine

dropper.  (Read this step about 10  times!)  Glycerin is added slowly and

carefully (i mean careful) Until the  entire surface of the acid it covered

with it.



6. This is a dangerous point since the  nitration will take place as soon

as the glycerin is added.  The  nitration will produce heat, so the

solution must be kept below 30 degrees  centigrade! If the solution

should go above 30 degrees,  immediately dump the solution into the

ice bath!  This will insure that it  does not go off in your face!



7. For hte first ten minutes of  nitration, the mixture should be gently

stirred.  In a normal reaction the  nitroglycerin will formas a layer on

top of the acid solution, while the  sulferic acid will absorb the excess

water.



8. After the nitration has taken  place, and the nitroglycerin has formed

on the top of the solution, the entire  beaker should be transferred slowly and

carefully to another beaker of water.



When this is done the nitroglycerin  will settle at the bottem so the other

acids can be drained away.



9. After removing as much acid as  posible without disturbing the

nitroglycerin, remove the  nitroglycerin with an eyedropper and

place it in a bicarbonate of soda  (sodium bicarbonate in case you didn't

know) solution.  The sodium is an  alkalai and will nuetralize much of the

acid remaining. This process should be  repeated as much as necesarry using

blue litmus paper to check for the  presence of acid.  The remaining acid

only makes the nitroglycerin more  unstable than it already is.




10. Finally! The final step is to  remove the nitroglycerin from the

bicarbonate.  His is done with and eye  dropper, slowly and carefully.  The

usual test to see if nitration has  been successful is to place one drop of

the nitroglycerin on metal and ignite  it.  If it is true nitroglycerin it

will burn with a clear blue flame.



** Caution **

nitro is very sensative to  decomposition, heating dropping, or

jarring, and may explode if left  undisturbed and cool.







   This is a guide for Anarchists and  can be funny for non-believers and 12

and 13 year old runts, and can be a  lexicon of deadly knowledge for True

Anarchists... Serious damage is  intended to be dealt here. Do not try

this stuff unless you want to do a lot  of serious Anarchy. 



[Simulation]



Asshole - 'Listen, you little teenager  punk shit, shut the fuck up, or I'll

knock you down!'



Anarchist - 'O.K.....You can't say I  didn't warn you. You don't know my true

power...' (soooo casually)



Asshole - 'Well, what do you mean?

Anarchist - '<demoniac grin>'



As you can see, the Anarchist knows  something that this asshole doesn't...

         [Operation Fuckup]



Geta wheel barrel or two.Fill with  gasoline. Fill with gasoline. Get 16

rolls of toilet paper, unroll & drench  in the gasoline. Rip to shreds

in gasoline. Get asbestos gloves.   Light a flare (to be punk), grab glob

of saturated toilet paper (you can  ignite the glob or not). Throw either

flaming or dripping glob into: any  window (picture is the best)front doors

rough grain siding and best of all,  brick walls.



First of all, this bitch is near  impossible to get off once dried, and

is a terror to people inside when lit!  After this... during the night,

get a pickup truck, a few  wheel-barrels, and a dozen friends with

shovels. The pickup can be used only  for transporting people and equipment,

or doing that, and carting all the  dirt. When it gets around 12:00 (after

the loser goes beddie - bye), dig a  gargantuan hole in his front yard until

about 3:00. You can either assign  three or four of your friends to cart

the dirt ten miles away in the  pickup-bed, or bury his front door in

15' of dirt! After that is done, get  three or four buckets of tar, and coat

his windows. You can make an added  twist by igniting the tar when you are

all done and ready to run! That is if  the lose has a house. If he lives

inside an apartment building, you must  direct the attack more toward his

car, and front door. I usually start  out when he goes to work...I find out

what his cheap car looks like, and  memorize it for future abuse...It is
 always fun to paint his front door  (apt.) hot pink with purple polka-dots,

and off-neon colors in diagonal  stripes. You can also pound a few

hundred or so four inch nails into his  front door (this looks like somebody

really doesn't like you from the  inside). Another great is to fill

his keyhole with liquid steel so that  after the bastard closes his door - the

only way to get back in is to break it   down. If you can spare it, leave

him an axe - that is, implanted three  inches into, and through the door! Now,

this next one is difficult, but one of  the best! Get a piece of wood siding

that will more than cover his front  door completely. Nail two by fours on

the edges of the siding (all except  the bottom) so you have a barge - like

contraption. Make a hole at the top  that will be large enough for a cement

slide. Mix about six or seven LARGE  bags of QUICK drying cement. Use the

cement slide to fill the antichamber  created by the 'barge' that is around

his door. Use more two by fours to  brace your little cement-filled barge,

and let the little gem dry. When it  is, remove the 'barge' so only a stone

monolith remains that covers his door.  Use any remaining cement to make

a base around this so he can't just  push it over.When I did this, he called

the fire department, and they thought  he meant wood, so they brought axes. I

watched with a few dozen or so other  tenants, and laughed my damn ass off!

This is only his door!After he parks  his car for the night, the fun really

begins...I start out by opening up the  car by jamming a very thin, but

loack - inside and out! Then proceed  to put orange-juice syrup all over the

seats, so after he gets through all  the other shit that you do, he will

have the stickiest seats in the world.  You can then get a few Sunday


papers, and crack one of the windows  about four inches. Lightly crumple the

papers, and continue to completely  fill the inside of his car with the

newspapers. A copy of the Sunday New  York Times will nicely fill a

Volkswagen! What is also quite amusing  is to put his car on cinder

blocks, slash his tires at the top,  and fill them with cement! Leave the

cinder blocks there so that, after he  knocks the car off of them, he will get

about 3 miles to the gallon with those  tires, and do 0 to 60 in about

two minutes! It is even more hilarious  when he doesn't know why the hell why!

Another is to open his hood, and then  run a few wires from the sparkplugs to

the METAL body. The sure is one HOT  car when it is running!  Now, I like to

pour two pounds of sugar down his gas  tank. If this doesn't blow every gasket

in his engine, it will do something  called 'carmelizing his engine'. This  is

w

sugar to carmel, and you literally  must completely take the engine out and

apart, and clean each and every  individual part! Well, if this asshole

does not get the message, you had  better start to get serious. If this

guide was used properly & as it was  intended (no, not as kindling for the

fire), this asshole will either move  far away, seek professional

psychological help, commit suicide, or  all of the above!







          Unstable Explosives

         ---------------------



  Mix solid Nitric Iodine with  househould ammonia. Wait overnight and

then pour off the liquid. You will be  left with a muddy substance. Let

this dry till it hardens.  Now throw  it at something!!!!







              Weird Drugs

             -------------



Bananas:



1. Obtain 15 pounds of ripe yellow  bananas



2. Peel all and eat the fruit. Save  the peelings



3. Scrape all the insides of the peels  with a sharp knife.



4. Put all the scraped material in a  large pot and add water.



5. Boil 3 or 4 hours until it has  attained a solid paste considtency.



6. Spread paste onto cookie sheets and  dry in ofen for about 20 minutes.  This

will result in fine black powder.  Usually one will feel the effects after

smoking three to four cigarettes.



Cough syrup:




mix robitussion a-c with an equal  amount of ginger ale and drink. The

effect are sedation and euphoria.   Never underestimate the effects of

any drug!



!Toads:



1. Collect five to ten toads, frogs  will not work. The best kind are tree

toads.



2. Kill them as painlessly as  possible, and skin immediately.



3. Allow the skins to dry in a  refrigerator four four to five days, or

until phe skins are brittle.



4. Now crush the skins into powder and  smoke.  Due to its bad taste you can

mix it with a more fragrent smoking  medium.



Nutmeg:



1. Take several whole nutmegs and  grind them up in an old grinder.



2. After the nutmegs are ground.   Place in a mortar and pulverize with a

pestle.




3. The usual dosage is about 10 or 15  g ra-s. A larger dose may produce

excessive thirst,anxiety,and rapid  hart beat, but hallucinations are rare.



Peanuts:



1. Take 1 pound of raw peanuts (not  roasted)



2. Shell them, saving the skins and  discarding the shells.



3. Eat the nuts.



4. Grind up the skins and smoke them.





         How to hotwire a car



  The easiest way is to just get under  the dashboard and start crossing wires.

Of course this could short out the  entire electrical system so there is a

better way.



  When you get in the car, look under  the dash.  If it's enclosed then Don't

bother.  Most new cars are like this  unfortunately.  However you could cut

through the dash.  If you do cut just  do it near th ignition.



  Once you get behind or near the  ignition, look for two red wires.  In

older Cars this was the standard color  code.  If they aren't there you'll just

have to try whatever else you can find.



Pull out the two wires and cross them.  The car should start.  If it dosen't

run.







      More Fun Stuff for Terrorists



              Carbide Bomb



This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise  extreme caution.... Obtain some

calcium carbide. This is the stuff  that is used in carbide lamps and can

be found at nearly any hardware store.  Take a few pieces of this stuff

(it looks like gravel) and put it in a  glass jar with some water. Put a lid

on tightly. The carbide will react  with the water to produce acetylene

carbonate which is similar to the gas  used in cutting torches. Eventually

the glass with explode from internal  pressure. If you leave a burning rag

nearby, you will get a nice fireball.
