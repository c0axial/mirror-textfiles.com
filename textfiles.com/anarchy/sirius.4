    I just came back from trashing AT&T, since they decided to build thier
headquarters in my town and are now installing thier computer and testing them,
we decided to hot them, we found lots of printouts, chips (yes, but probably
broken), and manuals that were thrown out......I'm writing this to tell you,
that you too, can get this stuff FREE from AT&T or local bell
And you have most of the equipment at home:
  1) Crow Bar
  2) Wire cutturs
  3) bags
  4) a Car
  5) about six kids
  6) guts
  7) Flashlights
 
ok now that you have all that you need cloths, basic black or blue with NO
white and gloves, cover your faces with shoe polish.
 
Ok now that you are all set hop in the car and drive around back, make the
driver stay in the car, and the rest proceed to the fence (usauly there is one)
and cut a little whole for all to fit through, now send the fattest kid around
front to act as a guard in case someone comes he can run and warn everyone
else. Now take the crow bar and shove it under the corner of the dumpsters
cover and wedge up (they are putting locked covers at night) and boost the two
smallest up into he dumpster, they throw whatever they can find that looks
decent and the two remaining kids put them in bags and throw them over the
fence and go back for more. For the kids inside, look for hardcover books,
manuals, parts, and printouts, and if your lucky, you might find regular paper
that someone scribbled codes onto.

  Now if the guards do come shut the lid as best as you cans, telling the kids
inside to dig under (the guards won't look anyway and if they do it will be a
second, so there safe) now climb through the fence and take the bags to the car
and drive away, go around the block and wait, then one of you go and get the
two kids or whatever.

  Now that your are all safe, wasn't that fun? well now we search through the
junk watching TV and drinking....this is perhaps the best part because you are
all excited and thrilled at what you got!!
