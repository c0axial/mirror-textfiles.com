  WELCOME TO A FIRST IN A SERIOUS ON HOW TO 'RIPP OFF THE WORLD'.  THE TOPIC OF
OUR DISCUSSION TODAY WILL BE ON HOW TO BRING HBO/SHO/SPORTSCHANNEL INTO YOUR
HUMBLE DOMAIN.	THIS PROCEDURE I INTAILS SCALING YOUR LOCAL TELEPHONE POLE-SO I
MUST WARN YOU-IF YOU SLIP AND PLUMMET TO THE GROUND AND DIE REMBER- DOUBLE
DENSITY WROTE THIS ARTICLE.( A BRIEF ASIDE, DOUBLE DENSITY(HENCEFORTH KNOWN AS
ASSHOLE) IS THE REIGNING SYSOP AT SHADOW WORLD.)

  ENOUGH OF THE MOCKERY AND LETS START TO INSTAL YOUR 'PAY' CABLE CHANNELS.  THE
FOLLOWING IS NEEDED TO INSTALL THE SERVICES:


    [01]  LADDER
    [02] TWO PAIRS OF PLIARS

  ONCE YOU ARE DONE PILAGING YOUR HOUSE FOR THESE ITEMS YOU ARE READY TO PROCEDE
TO THE NEXT STEP, FINDING THE CABLE WIREST.  THE EASISEST WAY TO DO THIS IS JUST
TO TRACE THEM OUT FROM YOUR HOUSE TO THE WIRE AND THEN TO THE CORRESPONDING
TELEPHONE POLE.

  ONCE HAVING LOCATED YOUR TELEPHONE POLE YOU ARE READY TO BEGIN YOUR ASSAULT.
SET UP THE LADDER AND CLIMB THE POLE.  THE LOWEST WIRE ON THE POLE IS YOUR
TELEPHONE-DONT MESS WITH THAT!	AND THE HIGHEST CABLE IS YOUR POWER- NO WARING
NEED BE ISSUED ABOUT THAT WIRE).  OKAY NOW YOU SHOULD BE ON YOUR LADDER NEXT TO
THE TELEPHONE POLE.  EITHER TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE POLE 1-2 FEET, THEIR
WILL BE YOUR CABLE WIRE (WHICH THEN LEADS TO A SILVER BOX).  IF YOU LOOK
CAREFULLY AT YOUR CABLE FIRE YOU WILL SEW A RED AND BLUE AND WHITE TAG ON IT.
THIS TAG TELLS 'MR.CABLE' WHAT SERVICES YOU HAVE.  AT ONE END OF YOUR
CABLE-RIGHT BEFORE IT JOINS THE MAIN CABLE WIRES THEIR WILL BE A CABLE WOUND
UP.(THIS FUNCTIONS AS THE RESISTANCE THAT BLOCKS AOUT SHO/HBO ETC ).  PRIOR TO
THIS CABLE(IT IS USIALLY RAPPED IN A CIRCULAR FORMATION AND SECURED TO THE CABLE
FIRE.) THIER IS A 75OHM MALE CONNECTER CONNECTED TO THE COIL.  UNSCREW
THIS(USING THE TWO PLIARS-YOU DID REMBER THEM DIDNT YOU?).  NOW ONE END OF THE
COIL IS DICON ECTED.  NOW GO TO THE SILVER BOX-WHERE

  THE SECOND PART OF THE COIL CONNECTS AND DISCONTECT THAT AS WELL.(LET THE CO
IL PLUMET TO THE GROUND-YOU DONT NEED IT AGAIN.) .  NOW CONNECT THE WIRE THAT
GOES DIRECTLY FROM YOUR CABLE FIRE TO THE SILVER BOX.  AND THAT WILL CONCLUDE
THE INSTALATION OF THE 'PAY' TV'S.

  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION LEAVE EMAIL AND I WILL GET BACK TO YOU POST HASTE.
