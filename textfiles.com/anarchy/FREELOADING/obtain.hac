                             Change Machine Fraud

 I.
   There are certain types of money changing machines...The one YOU need is
the kind where ya put yer bill in the tray <lengthwise> ,push the tray in to
get yer change...

 II.
   Once you got the right machine,get a $5 or a $1 ,it helps if the bill is
WRINKLED...Then tear a notch in the bill on the lower left side of the bill.
Cut the notch about 3.5 cm. from the lower left hand corner...

III.
    Now, go to the machine..put the bill in the tray and slide it in...  Now
what will happen is the machine will have so far read the bill right and it
will spit out yer change..  Then when it reads the notch, it will think the
bill is fucked up and reject it  and like you will have the change  and yer
bill...

 For this to werk right you must have done this right..it does take practice
but once you can do this your local Money Changer will be yer bank...
