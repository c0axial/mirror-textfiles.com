EVER FIND A ATM CARD THAT SOMEONE LEFT AT A MACHINE OR FOUND
A PURSE OR WALLLET WITH A CARD IN IT?
HERE IS A PROFITABLE WAY TO DO SOMETHING WITH THAT CARD.
IT MAY SOUND TO SILLY BUT IT WORKS.

1.GET PHONE # AND THE ADDRESS FOR THE NAME ON CARD.{THIS IS
NOT SO EASY SOMETIMES BUT WORTH CALLING AROUND A COUPLE OF
CITIES IN THE AREA}

2.ASK FOR THE PERSON BY FULL NAME.

3.SAY"HELLO MY NAME IS (AKA)AND I AM CALLING FROM (THE BANK
CARD NAME)24 HR. HOTLINE AND SOMEONE HAS REPORTED YOUR CARD
AS BEING FOUND.THIS CARD WILL BE CANCELLED AND A NEW CARD AND
PIN NUMBER WILL BE ISSUED WITHIN 5-10 WORKING DAYS,AND YOU
WILL NEED TO GO TO THE BANK TO PROGRAM IN YOUR NEW PIN
NUMNBER ONCE YOU RECIEVE YOUR NEW CARD. I NEED TO KNOW IF
YOUR CURRENT ADDRESS IS ******* OK,AND THE CARD SHOULD BE
THERE IN 5-10 WORKING DAYS, ALL I NEED NOW IS THE CURRENT
PIN NUMBER YOU ARE USING SO THAT I MAY DE-ACTIVATE THIS CARD
AND ACTIVATE THE NEW ONE.

4. IF ANY QUESTIONS COME UP,ASSURE THEM THAT THE CURRENT CARD
IS NO LONGER VALID BUT YOU NEED TO DE-ACTIVATE IT TO GET THEM
A NEW ONE.

5.ONCE YOU GET THIS NUMBER GO IMMEDIATLY TO A SAFEWAY OR ANY
OTHER NO-CAMERA ATM MACHINE (DON'T WAIT TO LONG,THEY MIGHT
GET SMART AND CALL THE BANK BACK TO VERIFY.)DO NOT USE ANY
BANK ATMS MOST ARE FILMED.

6.IF ALL GOES WELL YOU COULD USE THE CARD FOR 2 OR 3 DAYS.
GO TO A MACHINE AFTER MIDNIGHT {LIKE 12:05} THE SAME DAY YOU
FIRST USE THE CARD,THIS SHOULD GET YOU ANOTHER $2-300.00
BEFORE ANYONE CLUES IN.

THIS MAY SOUND LIKE IT WON'T WORK BUT YOU WILL BE VERY VERY
SUPRISED AT HOW STUPID PEOPLE ARE TO GIVE SUCH INFORMATION.
{ JUST THINK THEY WERE DUMB ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE CARD IN THE
MACHINE IN THE FIRST PLACE.}

CAUTION: I RECOMMEND USING A PAYPHONE WITH COINS NOT HOME
PHONE OR CALLING CARD AND SOUND PROFESIONAL AND SPEAK QUICKLY
SO THEY CAN'T THINK QUICKLY ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING UNTIL
YOU HANG UP.

P.S. I HAVE TRIED THIS,IT WORKED 4 OUT OF 5 TIMES WITH A NET.
OF $1800.00 SINCE 6/89. I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU ARE READING
THIS BUT I'M SURE I'M DOING VERY WELL BY NOW.

                         YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD SIGN MY NAME
TO THIS? BANKS ARE PRETTY NASTY WHEN THEY GET RIPPED OFF!!!
