RADAR JAMMING: MOTORISTS FIGHT BACK!
 
WRITTEN BY THE SCARLET ARMADILLO
 
PLEASE DO NOT POST WITHOUT THE ABOVE
LINES OR I BE ALL DEPRESSED!
 
WARNING: THE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS IS NOT
ILLEGAL, BUT THE OPERATION OF A RADAR
JAMMER WILL PUT YOU IN VIOLATION OF
SEVERAL FCC REGULATIONS AND IF CAUGHT
BY A POLICE RADAR UNIT, YOU CAN BE
CHARGED WITH OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE,
A NASTY OFFENCE. BUT FRANKLY, WHO GIVES
A FLYING FIDDLERS FUCK!
_______________________________________
 
PRINCIPLE OF RADAR JAMMING:
 
POLICE RADAR OPERATES BY SIMPLY SENDING
OUT A SIGNAL OF A KNOWN FREQUENCY AND
THE RECEIVING OF A REFLECTED SIGNAL. 
WHEN THE SIGNAL IS REFLECTED OFF A CAR,
THE FREQUENCY IS SHIFTED DUE TO THE 
DOPPLER EFFECT. THIS FREQUENCY SHIFT
IS THEN PICKED UP BY THE POLICE UNIT,
AND WITHIN A FEW MINUTES YOU ARE 
GIVING THE COP YOUR LICENSE, $50, OR
TAKING A BREATH TEST!
TO JAM THAT UNIT, WE WILL EMPLY A
MICROWAVE SOURCE THAT WILL "FOOL"
THE POLICE UNIT. BY SWITCHING THIS
CIRCUIT ON AND OFF, PULSES ARE PRODUCED
IN THE POLICE UNIT THAT ARE ROUGHLY
EQUIVALENT TO THE PULSES THAT ARE 
PRODUCED BY THE DETECTION OF YOUR CAR.
IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED SPEED
READING ON THE RADAR UNIT, WE MUST
PULSE AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE 
FREQUENCY OF THE POLICE UNIT. THE RATES
ARE 31.4HZ (PULSE PER SECOND) PER MPH
OF SPEED ON THE "X" BAND AND 72HZ ON
THE "K" BAND. THUS FOR A SPEED OF
45 MPH THE POLICE UNIT MUST RECEIVE
A SIGNAL OF FREQUENCY 45 MPH * 31.4HZ
OR 1413HZ ON THE X BAND AND 45 MPH * 72
HZ OR 3240HZ ON THE K BAND. 
THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS IF THE
POLICE EVER CHANGE THERE RADAR TO GO TO
ANOTHER BAND, ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO
IS CHANGE THE CIRCUITRY TO MATCH THEIR
FREQUENCY. 
_______________________________________
 
CIRCUIT OPERATION:
 
THIS JAMMING UNIT CAN WORK IN ONE
OF TWO MODES: MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC.
IN MANUAL MODE YOU WOULD HAVE THE
UNIT SEND OUT A CONSTANT SIGNAL
OF THE CORRECT FREQUENCY FOR THE NICE
OFFICER TO PICK YOU UP AT THE CORRECT
FREQUENCY. THE COP WILL PICK YOU UP
AT THE SPEED YOU WANT HIM TO SEE. IT
DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 
THOUGH IF YOU SET THE JAMMER TO SEND
OUT A SIGNAL EQUIVALENT TO 20 MPH AND
YOU WHERE FLYING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT
75 MPH AND PASSED BY A RADAR UNIT, 
OLE SMOKEY MAY SUSPECT SOMETHING. 
THOUGH AS LONG AS HE DOESNT FIND THE 
JAMMER IN YOUR CAR HE CANT PROVE 
DIDDLY SHIT IN COURT.
THE OTHER MODE IS THE AUTOMATIC MODE.
IN THIS MODE, YOU SEND HIM A FRACTION
OF THE SPEED YOU ARE TRAVELING AT. 
IF YOU SET IT AT 75% AND YOU ARE
TRAVELLING AT 70 MPH, THE COP WILL GET
A SIGNAL EQUIVALENT TO 53 MPH. THIS
IS THE BEST MODE BECAUSE WHAT IF YOU
TURN OFF THE INTERSTATE IN MANUAL
MODE SET AT 55 MPH AND GO DOWN A 
30 MPH STREET! YOU WILL GET PULLED
OVER FOR DOING 55 MPH WHEN YOU WERE
ONLY DOING 30 MPH. (BUT OFFICER, I
FORGOT TO TURN OFF MY RADAR JAMMER!)
THE PROBLEMN WITH THIS MODE IS THAT THE
JAMMER CANT JUST LOOK AT YOUR SPEEDO-
METER TO SEE WHAT SPEED YOU ARE DRIVING
AT, IT MUST RECEIVE A SIGNAL FROM
A WHEEL OR AXLESHAFT PULSER.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIT.
 
SINCE A TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THIS
UNIT IS VERY DIFFICULT SINCE IT IS
QUITE COMPLEX, I WILL TRY TO GO INTO
THE MANUAL MODE OPERATION AND JUST
PARAPHRASE THE AUTOMATIC OPERATION.
 
YOU USE A 555 TIMER TO MAKE A MASTER
PULSE TRAIN. TIE 8 & 4 TO V+, 1 TO
GROUND, SMALL (.01UF) CAP FROM GROUND
TO 6, SHORT 2 TO 6, THEN A RESISTOR
FROM V+ TO 7, AND A VARIABLE RESISTER
FROM 7 TO 6. THAT VARIABLE RESISTANCE
WILL ADJUST THE FREQUENCY. THE OUTPUT
SIGNAL IS AT PIN 3. NOW TAKE THAT
SIGNAL, SPLIT IT UP AND DIVIDE IT
BY 23 AND 10. TO DIVIDE BY 23, USE 2
4522 PROGRAMABLE DIVIDE BY N COUNTER, C
ALL THEN IC-1 AND IC-2. TIE PIN
3 FROM 555 TIMER TO PIN 6 OF IC-1.
GROUND 14,10,2,4 OF IC-1 AND 5,14,2,10
,4 OF IC-2. V+ AND GROUND ALSO GO TO
THE PROPER PINS TO POWER THE CHIPS.
TIE 5 & 11 OF IC-1 TO 11 & 13 OF IC-2.
THEY FORM ONE COMMON NODE, THAT YOU
WILL THEN CONNECT TO V+. THEN TIE 3,12
OF IC-1 TO PIN 3 OF IC-2. TIE PIN 1
OF IC-1 TO PIN 6 OF IC-2. THE OUTPUTS
OF THIS DIVIDE BY 23 COUNTER IS PIN
13 OF IC-1 AND 12 OF IC-2 WHICH ARE
TIED TOGETHER. IN A SIMILAR FASHION,
DIVIDE THE SIGNAL COMING OUT OF THE
555 BY 10. TAKE THE DIVIDED BY 10
SIGNAL AND THEN DIVIDE THAT GUY BY
72 IN A SIMILAR FASHION AS THE DIVIDE
BY 23 CIRCUIT. CALL THE TWO CHIPS THIS
TIME IC-3 & 4. TIE PINS 5,2,10,4 OF
IC-3 AND PINS 14,2,10,4 OF IC-4 TO
GROUND. THEN TIE PINS 11,14 OF
IC-3 AND 5,11,13 OF IC-4 TO V+. TIE 
PIN 3 TO PIN 3 TO PIN 12 OF IC-1, THEN
PIN 1 OF IC-3 TO PIN 6 OF IC-4. THE
OUTPUTS ARE 13 OF IC-4 AND 12 OF IC-4.
THIS SIGNAL YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE TO
ANOTHER CIRCUIT TO DISPLAY THE SPEED
YOU ARE TRAVELLING AT. YOU NEED 4521
CONNECTED TO A 4511. THE 4511 IS A
BCD TO 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY. THE
SEVEN SEGMENT OUTPUT IS CONNECTED
TO TWO 7 SEGMENT LED ASSORTMENT. 
PINS 1 AND 2 FROM THE 4521 WILL 
DETERMINE WHICH 7 SEG. LED IS SENT
THE PROPER INFORMATION. 
NOW TAKE THE DIVIDED BY 23 SIGNAL AND
TAKE IT TO ONE INPUT OF A 4 INPUT
AND GATE. THEN TAKE THE DIVIDED
BY 10 OUTPUT TO ANOTHER AND GATE. 
TAKE THE DIVIDED BY 72 OUTPUT AND 
TAKE THAT TO AN INPUT ON BOTH AND 
GATES. 
 
OPTION: IF YOU HAVE A RADAR DETECTOR,
MAKE UP A CIRCUIT TO OUTPUT 5 VOLTS
FOR LETS SAY ABOUT 20 SECONDS WHEN
IT GOES OF. CONSIDER THE RADAR DETEC-
TOR A TRIGGER INPUT TO A 555 TIMER
WITH AND RC COMBO TIED TO PIN 6 AND 7.
A GOOD R IS 1M OHMS AND A GOOD C IS
20UF. THIS IS A TIME CONSTANT OF 20
SECONDS. THEN TIE THE OUTPUT, PIN 3 OF
555 TO AN INPUT ON BOTH AND GATES.
THIS WILL CAUSE A 20 SECOND JAMMING
SIGNAL WHENEVER THE RADAR DETECTOR
GOES OFF.
 
THE OUTPUTS OF THE AND GATES ARE
TAKEN TO SIMPLE AMPLIFIERS WHICH IN
TURN ARE TAKE TO THE GUNN DIODES WHICH
ARE SENT TO THE PROPER ANTENNA. 
 
YOU NEED TWO DIFFERENT GUNN DIODE
OSCILLATORS FOR X AND K BAND. FOR
THE X BAND USE MICROWAVE ASSOCIATES
PART MA 86651-D OR GENERAL ELECTRIC
PART C 2070-J. FOR THE K BAND USE
EITHER MA 86791 OR GE C1238-A. IT IS
SOMETIMES POSSIBLE THAT AT SHORT
RANGES, THE POLICE RADAR MAY HAVE MORE
POWER THEN YOUR SIGNAL. IN THAT CASE,
YOU MAY WANT TO USE TWO GUNN DIODES 
FOR EACH BAND. THEN YOU NEED ANTENNAS.
FOR X BAND USE MA 86551 AND FOR K USE
MA 86552. FOR INCREASED POWER, YOU
WILL NEED TWO OF THESE EACH ALSO.
 
 
 
THE DESCTRIPTION OF THE AUTOMATIC MODE
IS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE IN A TEXT FILE,
SORRY!
 
ALL THIS SOUNDS GREAT RIGHT? YOU ARE
PROBABLY RUNNING OUT TO RADIO SCHLACK
NOW TO GET THE PARTS RIGHT? WELL WITH
ALL GOOD NEWS COMES BAD NEWS. THE BAD
NEWS IS PRICE. YOU ARE GOING TO NEED
OVER 30 DIFFERENT IC'S WHICH WILL MAKE
FOR COMPLICATION AND PRICE PROBLEMS.
THE KILLER THOUGH ARE THE GUNN DIODES.
THE 1983 PRICES ON THE GUNN DIODES AND
ANTENNAS ARE:
 
MA 86551  $15.00  (X BAND ANTENNA)
MA 86552  $29.00  (K "  " "     ")
MA 86651-D $116   (X BAND GUNN DIODE)
MA 86791  $125.00 (K "  " "  " "   ")
 
THUS IF YOU WANT THE HIGH POWER JAMMER
YOU ARE LOOKING AT $575 FOR THE 
TRANSMITTING EQUIPMENT ALONE! THAT
IS NOT TO MENTION ALL THE OTHER 
SUPPORT HARDWARE. THE MORAL IS, IF
YOU WANT TO BEAT SMOKEY, YOU HAVE TO
PAY FOR ALL OF THIS. YOUR BEST BET
RATHER THEN MAKE THIS IS TO BUY A
SIMPLE RADAR DETECTOR. IT HAS SAVED ME
DOZENS OF TIMES IN 24 MONTHS.
