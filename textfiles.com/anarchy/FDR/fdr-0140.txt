        I am not responsible for anything you do with this!  This

Ever wonder how they make a noose?  Heres how to make one.  Get a
piece of rope.  Stretch the rope out on the floor and fold it in
half.  Bring the one end of the rope back to the end with the loop
on it.  With the part you are bringing back, lay it next to the loop
and put the loop in the middle of the rope.  The rope on the floor
should look like this now:


                               /------------------------
                               \-----------\        ^
     --------------------------------------/        |
                                                    1
                                      ^ 
                                      |
                                    Loop

Now take the piece labeled "1" and wrap it in circles around the 
loop.  Leave some of the loop showing.  It should look like this now:

                             | <-String being wrapped
                   2-> /-----|
                       \-----|||||-\  
     ------------------------|||||-/  <- Loop
                               ^
                               |
                     Already wrapped string

When you are done wrapping the string, pull on one of the pieces of
rope going up the wrapped part.  When the part labeled "2" starts to
get smaller, keep pulling that one until you get to the wrapped part.
KEEP SOME OF "2" SHOWING!  Stick the end of the string being wrapped
in "2", and pull on the same piece of rope you pulled to make "2" 
smaller.  Thats it!  Just pull up and down on the wrapped part to make
the loop bigger and smaller.  It will take some practice to get it 
perfect.  Try it with big rope at first, once you get the hang of it
you can make a noose out of wire, small rope etc.  Sorry about all
the cheesy pictures.  If I knew somebody with a scanner I would have
included gifs.
