  Well, here I am in the third pack, struggling again to make it decent. 
Calling everyone who doesn't have their texts done, to make SURE they have them
done. I love this. This text was inspired by a VERY good friend of mine, Andy 
L. You know who you are, well this morning you gave me some good advice and it 
will show in my work. This text deals with the creation of basic destruction 
devices that can be VERY usefull for any Anarchist. I hope you enjoy and 
(extensivelly) use these concoctions. Well enough shit from me.....here I go!!

 -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-

1. Thermite - This is a very usefull powdered substance. This powder can give
	      up to 2200C (half the heat of an ATOM bomb). It can be used to
	      melt through pretty much anything. Things such as fortress fones
	      (pay phones) or common locks are no match for thermite, which is
	      the reason it is used by professional thieves so extensively!!

A. Ingredients.....
   -----------
	1. 10 grams of powdered aluminum
	2. 10 grams of iron oxide (rust)
	3. Magnesium Strip
	
B. Procedure.....
   ---------
	1. Basically just mix the two substances together, until as homogenous
	   as possible. 
	2. Can be made in larger/smaller amounts as long as ratio of 50/50 is
	   kept.

C. Igniting.....
   --------
	1. Lit with a magnesium strip.

** Thermite is perfect for getting into things that have locks....

 >----------------------------------------------------------------------------<

2. Molotov Bomb - Also reffered to as a cocktail bomb, is a very simple yet 
		  effective explosive. Is used ALOT in guerilla warfare or
		  common rebellions. Will produce a good amount of fire!!!

A. Ingredients.....
   -----------
	1. Gasoline
	2. Bottle
	
B. Procedure.....
   ---------
	1. Fill one bottle 3/4 full of gasoline.

	bottle with it). Be sure to leave about 15 inches of excess rag to
	light.
	3. Light and toss.

C. Igniting.....
   --------
	1. Any lighter or match will light gasoline.

** This was used by Russians and later adapted by the French in the second 
world war against German tanks. they would open the hatch, light the rag and 
toss it in!! Gasoline can be replaced with just about any flammable!!!

 <---------------------------------------------------------------------------->

3. Tennis Ball Grenades - A small impact grenade.

 :----------------------------------------------------------------------------:

4. Smoke Bomb #1 - Generate a GREAT amount of smoke!!!

A. Ingredients.....
   -----------
	1. 6 grams of Zinc Powder
	2. 1 gram of Sulphur Powder

B. Procedure.....
   ---------
	1. Just mix the two parts together.
	2. Can be made in different quantities as long as the 6 to 1 ratio is 
	   kept.

C. Ignition.....

** Perfect for a "fire" at school or to make your own smoke bombs.

 O----------------------------------------------------------------------------O

6. Makeshift Delay Wick - Perfect for anything with a wick!

A. Ingredients.....
   -----------
	1. Wick
	2. Any explosive
	3. A cigarette

B. Procedure.....
   ---------
	1. Cut the wick in half.
	2. Cut the filter off of the cigarette.
	3. Insert one of the wicks into the front of the cigarette.
	4. Insert the other into the cigarette (this wick should be attached to
	   the explosive)
	5. Should look like.....

	------------)#########(--------|***********|
	   *1         *2        *3         *4

*1 - The first wick which you will light....
*2 - The cigarette which is attached to both wicks....
*3 - The second wick (relays flame from cigarette to explosive)....
*4 - The explosive....

C. Ignition.....
   --------
	1. Light the first wick and the flame will eventually get to explosive.

** If you don't know how this delay wick works then (to put it bluntly) you're
stupid but for you morons here's how it works. When you light the first wick, 
it will burn up to the cigarette.....which will be lit. The flame on the 
cigarette will reach the end of the cigarette and light the second wick (which 
should be about a centimeter into the cigarette) and which in turn will light 
the explosive. So as you can see, this is a small, cheap and long delay wick. 
The delay can be adjusted by the size of the cigarette. Sometimes if there is 
no wind the cigarette will not light. But I have yet to see this happen.

B. Procedure.....
   ---------
	1. Mix the two together!!!
	2. Will form acetylene (VERY flammable, used for blowtorches)

C. Ignition.....
   --------
	1. Just mix!!!

** This can be very valuable, for instance, try having a lit match over the
concoction (step back)!!!

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Napalm - Thickened...powered up....gasoline!!!

A. Ingredients.....
   -----------
	1. Unleaded Gasoline
	2. Polystyrine (also known as styrofoam)

B. Procedure.....
   ---------
	1. Mix the two together until the gas is saturated (won't take anymore)
	2. Leave it for 5 minutes and MAKE SURE it won't take anymore, for 
	   sometimes after sitting there for a bit, it takes more.
	
C. Ignition.....
   --------
	1. Pour and light!!!

** This is a very usefull chemical, for it burns like a bitch!!! But the smoke 
and gas that it releases are poisonous, so be carefull!!!

   Well, that's all for this text file. I know it's very basic and is for the 
beginning home chemist. As for you pro's out there...there's already tons of
great texts on how to make complicated and HIGH impact explosives!!! So I hope
you enjoy'd the text and start using these ideas, you can read as many texts as
you want but until you start to use the recipe's you've never really felt the
undescribable feeling which you'll aquire from seeing something being utterly
destroyed!!! All of the recipe's that are listed in this text are relatively
safe (considering you use common sense) and have been all executed by myself.
So have fun and hopefully you'll aquire a Taste For Destruction (lame closing)!
