			   Page One....Introduction

  Glad you decided to join us in another text from Purple Tentacle. This one is
entitled " Stuff you can do in a vacant house". This text and the ideas are 
used when you find out somebody has gone on vacation and left all their 
valuables at their home, and you then gather a group of friends and get in the 
house, and then...well, that's where you decide what to do.
  This is divided into a series of parts; actually rooms, for easier anarchy
and quicker fun. So while your editing this you can just search for your title,
and know what to do. At the end of the text, there is a list of equipment you
will need to perform these ideas successfully. It also tells you how to build 
'em so you CAN do the ideas. Have a blast...
   Actually, when I was thinking of writing this text, is was simply going to 
be a walk-thru, and then you would follow it around the house. But that wasn't 
too creative, and the idea kinda sucked. So I have changed it to a kind of 
"multiple choice" text, so you can have more fun!  
   Note: This text has been written based on the fundamental house design. Some
of the rooms may not be in the house you're in, and some rooms may not be disc-
ussed in this text because of lack of anarchial possibilities. Be creative! 
Also, some rooms were totally pointless to put in with the text, such as a 
laundry room. ( WOW! The anarchy is just rolling in there! )

   DISCLAIMER: Don't come crying to me saying I told you to do it.

 -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=--=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=-
			 Page Two....Outside the House

1. Tear all flowers and other plants out of the ground. Make the gardens look 
   like a shithole, and then, just for fun, put the flowers in upside down or
   in the mailbox. You can also kill about three or four cats and put them in
   the garden with the heads sticking out and the rest of the body covered in
   dirt and soil.

2. With your trusty knife scrape interesting anarchy signs and other pictures
   into the paint on the garage. If you want you can scrape all the paint off
   and remove the wheels that make the garage door open and close, so it just
   kinda falls on the next person who opens it. If the garage is wooden, just
   burn it. (WARNING: If you are going to burn it, burn it AFTER you raid the
   house, so the cops come later and you get something out of it.)

3. Spray paint the house. Write a lot of vulgarities, such as mother jokes or
   death and rape threats. If you are going to write rape threats, be certain
   it's the correct sex your addressing, or else it's written proof that your
   a faggit. Use black spray paint on the windows, and make sure you destroy,
   or at least get rid of, the can when your done or fingerprints will lead a
   little path towards your house.

4. Coat the doorhandles with vaseline and fill the locks with superglue. This
   way nobody can get in without velcro gloves and a portable ram. This idea,
   along with #2, should only be used after you have raided the house. If its
   used before you raid, you won't be able to get in either.

5. Smash the windows, using the nearest garbage can or heavy object. You can
   even use your head if you want, but I advise against. Use the glass so you
   can cut abusive words and pictures into the siding and/or wood. Then throw
   all the glass at the family's cat or dog. 

6. If there is siding on the side of the house, tear it off and stuff it all
   down the chimney. This idea is most useful in the winter time because the
   fireplace is used most often then, and the smoke from the fire won't be able
   to escape through the chimney, so it comes back down and fills the house,
   suffocating the people inside. If there isn't any siding, just brick, then
   kill a cat or dog and stuff the animal down the chimney instead.

7. Remove the fence and move it to a seperate, more inconvienient spot on the
   property, such as around the front door or the garage. Even around the dog
   house, so the furry little shit can't get out. You can play fun games if you
   trap the dog inside the dog house. ( See next idea )

8. If you happen to fence the dog in his/her house, use the remaining poles and
   play the following game, entitled: Blind Man's Pinada.
	NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 to 6
	OBJECT: To kill the dog.
	HOW TO PLAY: Each person takes a turn of stabbing the fence pole 
	through the roof of the dog house, until somebody fatally spears the 
	dog. That person would then win.
	BONUS: Any person who spears it but doesn't kill it, get's a free turn.
	There is also a prize for whoever spears the dog the most without 
	killing it.

9. Before you read this idea, let me warn you that although this works quite 
   well, it isn't the most pleasant thing to do. Say you have nothing to do,
   and a lot of money, and your REALLY itching to fuck up this house, go down
   to your local farmhand store, or white rose, or whatever, and buy lots of
   huge bags of cow manuer. Now, during the nightime, visit their house and
   get all the manuer out of the bags, and pack it solid against the front 
   door. There is usually some kind of small shelter in front of the door, so
   this helps. Next put some worms in it, so it keeps fresh for a while. Just
   for an added touch, put a white bed sheet over the part that would be seen
   by the public. Hell, you can even put some dead animals in their, so the 
   soil stays fresh. If you have anything left, put in on the back door.

10. Coat the house in gasoline and burn it. Not an easy task, I know, but if 
    you manage to get into the house, you pour gasoline everwhere, including 
    the hot furnace. Now, after trailing the gasoline through the house, trail 
    it out in the garage, and light the trail of gasoline. Now run. Make sure 
    before doing this that nobody sees you. Also, if you want anything out of 
    this, take some stuff from the house while you're in it.

			     Page Three....The Pool

1. Throw many black garbage bags and garbage cans in the pool. The next time 
   the owner(s) use the pool, it'll be like swimming in shit! Just so it takes
   a lil bit longer, cut large holes it the garbage bags, and take the lids off
   of the garbage cans, so the garbage leeks out and spreads throught out the 
   pool.

2. Kill some animals, such as cats, dogs, chipmunks, birds, etc., and throw 
   them in the pool. When the next person uses the pool, watch the expression 
   on his/her face! It'll be hilarious, especially if it's a woman, because 
   they are a little more caring towards the safety of animals. If you get alot
   of animals,pile them up inside the changing hut, so you can carry out both 
   idea #1 and #2.

3. Pour oil in the pool and light it, followed by throwing live cats into the 
   massive flame. It's also fun to get a group of cats and a group of friends,
   tie the cats to a piece of wood or something that floats, and have bets, to
   see which cat can safely float from one end of the flaming pool to the other
   without dieing.

4. Beat the shit out of all the mechanical equipment that works the pool. For 
   example, bust up the filter with a wrench or a chainsaw, and that long thing
   that crawls around the pool. Take all the filters and shit and sell em to a
   pawn shop or something, so you can make money out of all this. 

5. Clog up the filters and the water pumps with tremendous amount of wood and
   metals. Hopefully, the overflow will cause a large explosion, which in turn,
   if the equipment is placed beside each other, will cause a chain reaction of
   pool equipment bursting into flames. To make sure the explosion does 
   somethin I recommend a large coating of gasoline or gunpowder.

6. Remove the covering of the pool before a large storm of wind, rain, and/or 
   snow. This way, all the shit in the air will be in the pool. If it happens
   to be a snow storm, and the next day you find some yellow snow on the ground
   (don't ask me how you'd do this) somehow move the yellow snow into the pool.
   When the snow melts, the piss will contaminate the pool. If you want, you 
   can piss in the pool too.

7. Buy a whole bunch of pucks full of rat poison or something toxic,and replace
   the chlorine in the water pumper with the rat poison, or whatever you bought
   or stole. Hopefully one of the people who use the pool will accidentally 
   swallow some water, and die.

8. Remove the parts in the front of their car, (see Page 4 #2) and chuck them 
   in the pool. Immediately, those parts will be ruined, and the weight will 
   make them hard to remove. This will also ruin the car.  

9. If you can, hotwire the car and drive the whole car into the pool. 
   I know this sounds difficult, but if you can it's absolutely the best.
   While your at it, drive over the garden or through the back door. This works
   best in a country home, because the next door neighbours are four miles 
   away, and nobody will see you.

10. Find the local asshole, and ambush him. Tie him up, put him in a bag, and 
    throw him in the pool. Make sure he/she doesn't know who you are, incase
    he/she escapes. Ranked most outrageous and stupid idea by Purple Tentacle.

 -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=--=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=-
			Page Four....Inside the Garage

1. Pour all the chemicals in the garage on the ground, and don't let any of 
   them escape. (By saying "escape" i mean get out the garage. If there's a car
   in there, open it up and puncture the engine,the carburator, and the gas 
   tank.This way all the fluid and gasolines will flow on to the ground and mix
   with the other chemicals. Now, take a plaster gun, close all the entrances 
   to the garage, and seal the edges of those entrances with plaster. By the 
   time the owner opens the garage, the fumes will have built up so much, that 
   he will suffocate within a matter of minutes. What's that you say? What if 
   he doesn't stay in the garage? Well, curiosity killed the cat, and it will 
   kill the owner too. He/she will probably stay to inspect the liquids on the
   floor, and not notice the invisible fumes in the ground. Just for extra fun
   set up a tight tripwire that goes across the garage just behind the door, so
   when the owner steps into the garage, he/she will trip, fall, and maybe even
   go unconcious because of the large unexpected hit of their head on the floor
   This will almost guarantee suffocation, because while the owner is knocked
   out the fumes will enter his nose and mouth, and kill him/her.

2. Remove all the frames from any bicycles in the garage and use them to smash
   up the car, if there is a car, that is. If not, then just use the frames to
   break into the house or damage pool equipment. Don't forget to wash off the
   fingerprints!

3. Remove the wheels of the garage door, and make it so the garage door will 
   topple over and crush somebody the next time it's tried to be opened. You
   can do this by using a wrench, probably found in the garage, and removing
   all the nuts and bolts that attach the garage to anything stable. It will
   just sit there until somebody tries to move it, and SPLAT.

4. If there is a car in the garage, you can have a lot more fun that meets the
   eye. Most of the time, there are bottles of spray paint and/or chemicals on
   a shelf at the back or in a closet somewhere. Use them to spray paint stuff
   on the surface and the inside of the car, that is, unless you want the car.
 
5. Blow it up. Be sure that nobody sees you entering the garage or leaving the
   garage, or you'll be in jail and in debt quite a while. A useful bomb would
   be a series of overloaded time bombs. (see end of text for instructions.)

6. If you want more ideas on how to fuck up the car specifically, read Guile's
   text CARKILL.TXT.

 -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=--=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=-
			 Page Five...Front Entrance

1. Destroy everything that's breakable, just to add some more cost to the owner
   and his insurance. Closets, mirrors, windows, flower pots, whatever's break-
   able. Now, I bet your thinking "What about all the noise that would attract
   neighbors?" Well, I have your solution. Cover the windows and any glass with
   duct tape, and then smash it. The duct tape will silence the noise, and it 
   will make almost the same sound as if you dropped a box of pins.

2. Burn the carpet and all the coats that may be hanging in the closet. This 
   one is just add on some extra cost to the insurance bill when the owner gets
   back from his vacation. Be creative; burn a neat symbol into the carpet by 
   pouring some lighter fluid, (or gas from the garage/car,) and lighting it. 
   Extinguish it as soon as it hits the ground and singes the picture into the 
   carpet, or a flame will catch the whole carpet and the design won't be 
   recognizable. 

3. Use a long pole or something heavy to create large, massive holes in the 
   floor and then dump all the furniture in the hole. This may sound hard, but
   if you brake away the floor in the between the studs, a gaping hole will 
   appear so you can throw miscellaneous shit down there.

4. Using the same principals as idea number 3 on page 3, (the garage door,) 
   this idea, unhinge the front door and prop it up so the slightest touch will 
   knock it over and cause some unexpected damage to the next person who 
   touches it. A smalll puddle of oil or grease outside the door adds to the 
   phun, because who ever is the next person to approach the door will slip, 
   hit their head on the ground, and hit the door with their feet, which would 
   then make the door fall on top of them.

5. Just simply spray painting all valuable possesions and everything else in 
   the hall with red paint can cause severe costs to the owner and severe 
   enjoyment, and some welcome laughs, to you. Spray paint different designs, 
   phrases, or a big anarchy symbol on everything, including walls.

6. Remove the numbers on the front of the house and switch them around with the
   other numbers on the house, or make three different houses in a row have the
   same number! To really confuse some unsuspecting others use the phone in the
   empty house and order pizza, chinese, and really expensive steak, ( and lots
   of it, too! ) for the number house that you have made three of. For example,
   if you switched the houses #'s with somebody elses and eventually made it so 
   that there were three houses in a row that had number 52, and ordered three,
   or two, or however many you want, different types of food to numbere 52, the
   delivery people would get really confused!

      			 Page Six....Living/Family Room

1. Steal all the TVs, VCRs, Radios, etc. and make sure the room is bone dry. 
   The owners will probably want to come back from there vacation and watch 
   the dumb videos they made on their TV, but darn! It's not gonna be there! 
   Just so they have to go through more trouble, snap all the incoming TV wires
   and tie them together. Make sure that you take all the connecting wires that
   YOU will need to watch it, or else stealing it was pointless.

   *WARNING* You may want to have a getaway car ready, because it doesn't look 
	     too good when a group of kids are walking out of a dark house and
   	     carrying TVs.

2. If you don't want the electronics, ( only god knows why,) just trash them. A
   swift kick to the front of the screen will cause some problems. If you want,
   you can create a large explosing by smashing the front of nething electrical
   and throwing it in the sink, which you have already filled with water. Stand
   back.

3. Burn all the furniture and smash everything in the house. Knock over stuff
   flip over couches, break stools and small tables, etc. I know this is very
   basic but it is probably the most enjoyable thing to do in this whole text
   file.

4. With help from some friends, throw all the furniture down into the basement
   or put it in front of every possible entrance to the house. That way nobody
   can get into the house and the owners will probably have to wait a while in
   one of those shelters, until the pigs can stop thinking of donuts and start
   thinking about how to get into the house! BTW:You may want to think of ways
   to get out of the house before you do this, because you yourself may become
   trapped!

5. If you have A LOT of nails and A LOT of friends and A LOT of time and a 
   small hammer, you can really have some phun. While you're standing on a 
   chair, lift a small chair, (just for starters) and put it upside down on 
   the ceiling, and then hammer and nail it so it stays there. This is where 
   your friends come in and help, incase you haven't noticed. Eventually, after 
   you do it to everything in the house, it will look like the whole place is 
   upside down, and it just might send the owner crazy.

6. Clear all the furniture out of the room and do whatever else it takes to 
   make a lot of room. Now go kill a cat or something with blood and bring it 
   back to the house. Draw a large pentagram on the ground with the blood and 
   put six of your candles (hell, everybody carries candles!) on the six points
   of the big pentagram. Now you can worship Satan, but you don't have to. 
   You can just leave it there and make the neighbours and the next person who 
   enters sick.

 -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=--=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=-
  			    Page Seven....Kitchen

1. Steal everything you can get your hands on. Cutlery, Microwaves, even a damn
   fridge can be taken if you have the proper transportation. Hell, if you had 
   enough time you could take the tiles on the ground! But if you're gonna take
   some stuff, I advise plates and cutlery, especially silver and china. 

2. Throw some metal tins and cans in the microwave, and set the timer for about
   ten minutes. This should give you enough time to lead a trail of gasoline to
   the furnace from the microwave, so a large explosion goes off and levels the
   house while you run away. If you enter twenty minutes, you can trail gas all
   the way to the furnace, the microwave, AND the garage where most of the chem
   stuff is stored.

3. Remove all the food from the fridge and replace it with some small animals
   and children. They don't have to be dead, just immobilized so they dont go
   and squirm and scream. A simple way to do this is push a pillow over their
   face until they go unconcious.

4. If there isn't enough room in the fridge for the kids/animals, cut them in
   to little bits and hang them from the ceiling. ( idea courtesy of Cannibal
   corpse t-shirt. BUY IT! ) Kids are recommended.

5. Cover all the food in the house with rat poison, or something toxic and
   inconspicuous, like the imfamous Iocaine powder. ( No smell, taste, and
   dissolves instantly in water..if you can find any tell me! ) Now devise
   a way to blame it on the deceased's spouse, ( like a suicide note or an
   elaborate puzzle.)

6. If there are any things in the house that would fit in the microwave or
   the stove, such as as statues or china plates, this idea is a quick and
   easy way to cause expense to the owner(s). Put all the small stuff into
   the microwave and/or stove, and melt them until it is about half melted
   and half of it is just soft. Now put it back to it's orginal space, and
   try to imagine how long it will take the owner(s) to realize that those
   objects have been severly damaged.

7. Set it on fire. Simple, yet effective, because once the kitchen is in a
   blaze, the rest of the house will burn down with it, because there are 
   always doors that enter the kitchen that allow you to enter from all of
   the surrounding rooms. ( That's scientific. )

  			    Page Eight....The Basement

1. Luckily, there will be a workroom in the basement..you know, where the
   power tools are stored. If there is one, remove all the power tools and
   especially the extension cord(s), if there are any. Now plug the tools
   into the wall with the extension cord, and calmly, and as quietly as 
   you can, begin to cut away the foundations of the house. ( If you hear
   creaks directly above you..look out. )

2. Usually, the owner(s) will have put the stereo equipment in the basement.
   Take it. And don't give it back. Maybe sell it. But don't give it back.

3. If there is a bathroom, laundry room, and/or sink in the basment, you're 
   in luck. If you simply clog the drain with someone or something, the sink 
   will start to overflow, and eventually flood the house. If you just HAPPEN
   to have ripped open something electrical, like a socket, and exposed some
   wires, the water will probably cause an electrical fire, and explosion, and
   then the fire will travel all the way through the house via the electric 
   wires and fuse box. Wow, the things a sink can do.

4. Sometimes people who are of European backgroud keep a liquor cabinet in the
   basement, or a bar, or something to that matter. Knock yourself out! Have
   3 or 4 beers, some wine, whiskey, order some pizzas with all the spare  
   change or sold stereos. Always remember, IT ISN'T YOURS SO IT'S NOT YOUR 
   LOSS!

5. Maybe some neat looking rugs and/or priceless vases, etc. have been placed
   in your new house. :) These would look good on your property, wouldn't they?
   Especially in the form of 3-digit bills! If you don't get my drift already,
   steal them and sell them in a pawn shop.

 -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=--=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=- -=-
			   Page Nine....The Bedrooms 

1. If you begin in the Children's Bedroom, set fire to all their toys. This 
   minor anarchial prank will cause complete distress to the little shits and
   maybe even drive the parents insane, or drive them to drinking or slaying
   the children.

2. Again, if you're in the kids room, and there are some story books lying on
   the shelves, take a pen and one of the books, and begin to re-write the 
   story, using word substitution. For example, take the sentence from the
   ever-popular Green Eggs and Ham " I will not eat green eggs and ham." Now
   cross it out and write " Get that fuckin shit out of my face, asshole! "
   Get my drift?

3. If you happen to have some kind of drugs and/or cigarettes on you, you can
   plant the cigarettes/drugs in the kiddies room. Make sure it's some place
   where the kid will find it, and not the parent. Once the kid sees it, and
   reads the little note you attached that says SMELL ME, he/she will probably
   sniff the white powder, resulting in instant addiction. Later on in the week
   after the kids sniffs the coke, ( or whatever drug,) confront the kid and
   tell him/her that if they go and steal stuff from their parents that they 
   can have some more! From there on, it's all up to you. I suggest swapping
   sugar with cocaine after the child has gotten addicted, so you get the real
   stuff and the kid gets the sugar.

4. Put some bullets in the little kids room, or some guns or some pornos or
   something that would get the kid in deep shit. Either in deep shit or in
   the family's honour roll, depending on the sexual preferences and tastes
   of the father(s) and mother(s). ;)

5. Spray paint SATAN IS SLEEPING BESIDE and such ideas on the kids wall, with
   some red spray paint. If you know the name(s) of any siblings, you could
   write I HATE (siblings name) and (siblings name) SHALL DIE THIS NITE AND
   I SHALL EAT HIS HEART!!!!

6. When in the adult bedroom, you can really fuck up somebody's marriage life
   by placing a different size bra/panties in the male's cupboard, and leaving
   a note that says " Thanks for the wonderful night...don't tell your wife and
   I won't tell mine."  Hehehehe...

7. Switch the clothing and "little toys" and anything else that can be found in
   the female's drawers and closet with all the clothing and "little toys" that
   are found in the male's drawers and closet. This won't look too healthy when
   the kids come in and see daddy in scantyhose!

   HOW TO CREATE GUNPOWDER:

   a) Necessary Equipment: Potassium Nitrate (75%)
			   Charcoal (15%)
			   Sulfer (10%)

   b) Procedure:  First, grind each of the substances into a fine powder. MAKE
	 	  SURE THIS IS DONE SEPERATE FROM EACH OF THE OTHER POWDERS!
		  
		  Second, mix the fine powders together and place anywhere you
  		  want. If you want to have some way of lighting it from a far
  		  away place, coat a rope in gas and stick the rope in the gun
	 	  powder, and light the end of it.
