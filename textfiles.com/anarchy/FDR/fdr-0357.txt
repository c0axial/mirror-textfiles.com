Canadian Firms lose $20 bilion dollars every year to internal 
thefts.  Here are the ways theses thefs took place.


I.\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/Taking Money from the Till\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/    

     Of course you wouldn't just take it out of the machine because
the machine takes account how much money should be in the register. 
But suppose you're a cashier and somebody buys $100 worth of goods. 
You ring it up and after the customer leaves (and nobody is
watching of course!) you cancel the sale and put the 100 bucks into
your pocket...
   One woman investigated by a forensic accountant Don Holmes, at Ernst & 
Young did a varriation on this standard method. 
She worked at a Lumber Store, and at the end of each day she worked
she would destroy the sales made inside the cash register and do
her own fictious record with a lower total.  By pocketing the[37m
diffrence, she did the company out of $500,000 over 18 months. [37m
What she didn't know is that the counter in the register recorded[37m
every transaction she made with a sequential number.  She was[37m
undone when Holmes discouvered gaps between the numbers from one[37m
day to the next.[37m
   One other way is to take it directly from the customer into your[37m
pocket... A\If you work at a local varitey store It'll be easy just[37m
take to money without ring it in... B\If you work at a store where[37m
merchandise is recoreded with a serial number well it's a bit[37m
harder because the customer may notice what you're doing.[37m

[37m
     This only works if you are a trusted senior manager of just a[37m
manager of a non-chain store (Chains can usually hire accountants[37m
to and have experiences with Internal thefts.  Also what is[37m

control of all the receipts.  If you can keep them from knowing how[37m
much cash is accutally being taken in, it's pretty obvious taht you[37m
can keep alot of it to yourself.[37m
     By swiping amounts of $50-$200 in this ways over a period of[37m
5 years, a woman investigated by Ted Baskerville, partener at Peat[37m
Marwick Thorne, took home $500,000, thats 100,000 a year +your[37m
salary already, from a firm in Toronto. The case hasn't yet gone to[37m
court but Baskerville said that she was able to dominate the staff,[37m
and because she knew teh weaknesses of an accounting system that[37m
hadn't kept with pace with the growth of the business.[37m

[37m
     Well you just don't walk out the door with an armload of[37m
stuff.  You could do what they do in Janie's Addiction video[37m
"Caught Stealing" where a man walks into the store with a bag and[37m
goes straight into the washroom and put on an outfit that would[37m
make it look as if you were pregnant, then put on some makeup.[37m
Within the outfit are pouches that you fillup while you roam the[37m
store's warez.[37m
  But if you want to be sucessful starting a Time-Hounoured Plan[37m
that will enrich yourself at the company's expense you have to be[37m
a little more sophiticated.  One of the cases solved by Holmes was[37m
when a Manager of a Company set up a competing company which sold[37m
the same product. He sold the products of the company he worked for[37m
to his  competing company and with his authority to reduce the[37m
amount owing though cresit debts.  He would even send customers to[37m
his own company .[37m
   Other ways include a purchaser of a construction company over-[37m
ordered materials to sites a day before it was to be used, at night[37m
the uneeded materials were picked up and sold on the Black Market.[37m
