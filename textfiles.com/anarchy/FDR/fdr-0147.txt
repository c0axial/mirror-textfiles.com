        Hello friends... This txt file will show you how to do
a fucking lot with a paper clip.  I never realized how useful they
can be.  On with it...

Luggage Locks:

        Ok, you know those crappy locks that you put on your luggage bags'
zipppers... well, they are a bitch to open with a screwdriver, cause you need
something small to get up the twisted inside of one... you cant smash it
where you are, so use your paperclip.
 [lock picture]
            /---\       Step 1: Straighten out the paper clip
            |___|       Step 2: Make a bend, a tight curve at the end
            |ø  |               of the clip to form a hook.
            |ø ø|       (use the opening of the keyhole to bend against)
            -----       Step 3: Keep twisting up and to the left in a
                                circular motion.  If you get stuck,
 [Paper Clip picture]           pull it out a little and try again.
 +---------------------+\       If it is jammed, twist the clip to
 |                       |      break it, and remove as much of the clip
 |       Hook-->      _ /       as you can. Then jigggle in air, and the
 |    <--Handle                 broken piece should fall out.

Note: The first time I did this with biokiller, at my gâandparent's house,
      He got it and I didnt.. to bad we didnt know what we were trying to
      do then  :)

Fake Locks:

        We all have seen fake locks.. the ones that only take a screw driver
to open, but you dont have one.. this takes a second.  Bend the paper clip
in two, next bend the two ends together, and hold sturdy.

Door Locks:

        Youre friend is locked in the bathroom, or you locked yourself out,
or, in my case, I use it to lock others out while I am away.  So, you need
to open a door with a little hole in it.  there are two kinds.. turn and
push.. In a turn, you need a flathead screw driver, and you put it straight
into the hole.  Using a paper clip, just make a loop like in the previous
way, but this time, try to flatten the heads of it, but be carefule, if it
is pounded on too hard, it will become flimsy and break... thats why I use
really cool thick paper clips.  The second type of lock will cause much less
fustration than the previous methor, which I dont reccomend if you have
anything that can be used instead.  In this really easy second method for
the push door locks.  Make the clip straight, and push straight in... if you
dont get it immediatlym try around the sides, or next to the center.... some
locks are made with the hole off-center..they suck.

Chains:

        Ok.. I tried this, and ALMOST got it to work... it can work, but it
take a bit of practice.  This is how to open chain locks from outside, once
you have opened the door.  This requires a Large paper clip.
Step 1: Push door open as far as it will go, Straighten paper clip
Step 2: Put paper clip as far in as you can still hold it reasonably well
Step 3: Close Door on paper clip so it takes the shape of the door.
Step 4: open door, and pull out clip.  make a loop facing yourself
Step 5: Turn the loop upside-down. Try to put the loop facing up so
        it catches the knob on the chain.
Step 6: Close door and slide theclip up.  When it stops, open the door
        a very little bit and push out.
Note:  When I almost got this to work, I used 2 or 3 wired together, so it
       was long enough.

Computer locks:

        My latest discovery.. I just did it!  I was sitting here, and I said
"What the hell"... it worked, but then I couldnt get it unlocked.. I tried
3 times, but then I got it... Bend the clip in two.. then insert it with
on head in the "gâoove" that the lock is pointing to.. in other words...
if it is in the locked position, put one of the heads into the locked gâoove
that should be on the right side, not the one on top.  put the other head on
the opposit side... so it is straight across.  Then hold it firmly, and turn.
It worked almost immediatley for me... note.. I think there is a notch, or
something that must be knocked... so, when yoou turn, the notch, which is in
between the locked and unlocked "gâooves", is a little hard to turn, with
the paper clip, but I did it in a sec... nothing to it!

Chapter 2:

Good old fuse popper/shocker:

        Someone did this in my last school... It can cause death, so dont do
it unless you wear rubber gloves, or something to stop yourself from getting
fried.  Once again, bend the clip in half.  Insert it into the socket in the
bathroom or something... the shocker part, is if your dumb enough to
electrocute your self.

Cool Ring:

        So.. big ass harry says he is going to beat your ass after school...
well, this wont help unless you use it right, but get a large paper clip and
roll it around a marker the size of your finger, after you have straightened
it out fool...  Then, put on the ring... ben the 2 sends so they face out..
I have used it to cut things.. works fine for me...

CB melt down:

        You are trying to watch TV, when your neighbor cranks up his 1900
Watt CB... it gives you bad reception... He is breaking the law, and should
be punished :)

        Sharpen a paper clip's end, after you straighten it out, or use a pin
But, this manual shows how to use paper clips, so try this.  If you dont
want RF burn, do it with care, when he isnt transmitting, or with protective
clothing and gloves on...

        Find his coaxial cable that should go to his antenna, and poke it
in half way.. when he keys up.. his system will melt down.. this can also
cause human suffering, or death.

Note: This needs the clip to be a conductor, as well as all the others with
electricity, so if the clip is coated or plastic, it wont work.

Stop Doors from Closing:

        If you are going somewhere that you think you might be locked in or
out, then get a large paper clip... use a small something, like a pencil
and wrap it around it.  Put this in the hole that is drilled in the frame
of doors.. if it isnt long enough... pull on each end.

Phree Phone Calls ala Bishop:

        Bishop told me this.. I never got it to work, but it does...
Everyone has done it... put a paper clip connecting the small hole
under the keypad of a payphone to the metal in the microphone in the
handset.  Dial your number... leave it in until the phone rings once
or twice.
