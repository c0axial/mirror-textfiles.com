           MAD! PRESENTS....


MAD! SOURCE BOOK
PART #3 REVISED ADDITION.

WELCOME TO THE NEW EDITION OF THE MAD!
SOURCE BOOK.  THIS REVISION FEATURES A
NEW FORMAT OF LISTIINGS THAT IS EASIER
TO READ AND MUCH NICER TO LOOK AT.  THE
INFORMATION COMPILED HEREIN HAS COME
FROM MANY SOURCES, AFTER MANY HOURS OF
HARD WORK.  I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS
IS POSSIBLY THE GREATEST COMPILATION OF
HARD-TO-FIND DATA, THUS CONFIRMING THE
IDEA THAT COMPUTERS WILL PAVE THE WAY
TO "FREEDOM OF INFORMATION".  READ ON.


BOOKS.

MOST BOOKS CAN BE ORDERED USING THE
ISBN NUMBER, AND/OR THE INGRAM NUMBER,
FROM ANY STORE THAT DOES ORDERS, SUCH
AS COLES BOOKS. GOOD COMPANIES ARE
DBI BOOKS, LOOMPANICS UNLIMITED, AND
PALADIN PRESS.

  STEAL THIS BOOK!
  BY ABBEY HOFFMANN

ALTHOUGH NO LONGER IN PRINT, THIS IS
ANOTHER CLASSIC THAT IS VERY HARD TO
