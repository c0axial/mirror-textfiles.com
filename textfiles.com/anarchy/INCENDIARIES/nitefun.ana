So...it's a Wendsday nite and you're bored,GET UP AND HAVE SOME PHUN!!  This
phile is just a collection of ideas for some minor anarchy/terrorism/pyro
stuph...


1) Shit Bomb:

Get <or make> an M-80 or any other small explosive; a paper bag full of shit,
and other stuff;some wire;and a few friends...	first go to a house that has a
garage opener and get into the garage,for me, that's pretty easy,the garage
doors in my development have plywood panels which can easily be removed with a
utility knife.	Next get into the garage and get to the garage opener.Go to the
sect.  where the light bulb is and take off the cover and the bulb and connect
the wires to the sockett,then connect it to the M-80 and put the M-80 inna the
bag....get out,and make it seem as if no one was ever there...Then when the
jerk opens the garage...BOOM!!	his whole garage is lined with SHIT!


2) Winter Water Bomb:

Get a heavy HOLLOW glass globe/>block< and drill a small hole in it.Then fill
it with water,you may want to add something in it also..ie.  hard-to-remove
dye,something that will stink,some kinda paint remover,urine...etc.  fill it to
the VERY top and then fill up the hole as well as possible,with molten
glass/krazy glue/or somthin'...then when it's really kold,go to the the
neighborhood bum's house and place it in his yard,near his car,porch...  when
it gets cold enough for the water to expand...BOOM!!...shards of glass will be
all over his yard!!


3) Iodine Crystals:

These things are pretty old,but they are one of my favorite for the following
reasons:

1) they're cheap to make
2) they're easy to make
3) they're good enuf to do some decent damage

To make 'em just get some Ammonium Nitrate (fertilizer) and some Iodine
crystals...Dissolve about 1 teaspoon of Iodine to every 2 oz.  of ammonium nitr
ate...let it sit/evaporate overnite and you'll have yerself a buncha goop/may-
be crystals to fool around with....  Put 'em in the halls...on your chemistry
teacher's seat...make 'em into small balls and go 'egg' some houses...


Egging houses:

Me 'an BarbeQ think it's kinda expensive to waste eggs on egging houses...
besides,you can't do much in the winter either...so we've come up with
somethin' else...  Get some Glad Wrap(tm) and put shit/worms/anything else
that'll be good in it and wrap it and throw!  this way,you don't get anything
on you and it's a LOT cheaper than using eggs...


'Egging' houses II:

Get some urine and phreeze 'em inna cubes (NO asshole,you don't use your frig,
remember,it's winter) or whatever and wrap then in Glad Wrap(tm),and then you
know...


Bleaching Lawns:

Old but still great!


Phreak Out:

Get anything that'll produce a 2600 and go to your friendly neighbor hood
asshole's house and mooch your way in,then say some shit like ' Hey Snedrick,
think I could use your fone and tell my mom that you're coming over tommorrow
to play with my Atari 2600?  '...Once he says ' golly gee,of course yya can '..
blast a few 2600's and get him in some shit which he won't eveÿn know why
MaBell's after him...


Foaming Mailbox:

Dump a box of baking soda in a mailbox and then fill a balloon with vinegar
and mount it on the top of the underside of the cruddy maibox...then attach a
small needle to the lid and leave it open...then when someone see's it open, he
goes to close it and then the fun starts...


Foggy Mornin':

Get about four pounds of sugar and six pounds of potassium nitrate (saltpeter,
you can get it at the pharmacy)<make that confectionary sugar> and mix both of
'em well...Now you have ten pounds of what will be a GIANT smoke bomb...  Get a
container that'll hold it,and start melting the mixture in parts over a
stove,untill you've melted all of it and made a HUGE smoke Bomb...Oh
yeah,forgot to mention,you need a fuze alsÿo...any will do...  NOTE:I've never
done this,but Me and BarbeQ plan to...


another comment:  Make some and throw them iiinto the sewer,it'll look pretty
suspiicious...


Fireball:

This one is great at night...Get some Carbide (in lamps) ,bottle,and a candle.
fill the bottle with water and light the candle...get into the middle of the
street and make sure there aren't any cars coming down the street.Place the
candle down and open the bottle,drop a few peices of carbide and re-cap it
quickly,then get outta there...what will happen is that the bottle will explode
due to a build-up of aceteylene and then ignite with the candle flame.	pretty
k-k-k-k-k-k-k00l...but it's pretty dangerous if you're not careful...


Star light,star bright...

Easy one,but expensive...Get some alchohal (cheap) and get inna the middle of a
DARK street...then pour all of the alchohal inna a cheap metal bowl...	now for
the costly part...obtain some magnesium ribbon (or rip it offa your science
teacher) and take a few long strips and line them accross the bowl..  the light
it and ring all of the doorbells (or explode an M-80)...then view it from a
distance....

well,that's about it fer now,<yawn!>it's kinda boriiing...
