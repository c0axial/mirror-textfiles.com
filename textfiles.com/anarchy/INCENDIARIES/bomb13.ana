                            ): Mace Substitute :(
 
 
           3 PARTS: ALCHOHOL
           1/2 PARTS: IODINE
           1/2 PARTS: SALT
      OR:
           3 PARTS: ALCHOHOL
           1 PARTS: IODIZED SALT (MORTONS)
 
    It's not actual mace, but it does a damn good job on the eyes....
 
                           ): Co2 Canister Bomb :(
 
 
  Take a Co2 canister and cut the top almost off, but leave a little to
  form a hinge. Let out the Co2 and insert a M80 into it. insert fuse
  through hole in top. Close the top by welding or epoxy glue. When ready
  to ignite just light... pretty neat eh??
 
 
                         ): Unstable Explosives :(
 
  Mix solid nitric iodine with household ammonia. Wait overnight and then
  pour off the liquid. You will be left with a muddy substance. Now, take 
  some rubber gloves and mold medium-sized portions of the mud into spheres.
  (Note: Shaping into spheres is optional) Carefully, take the spheres and
  throw them at something!
 
                              ): Jug Bomb :(
 
  Take a glass jug, and put 3 to 4 drops of gasoline into it. Then put the 
  cap on, and swish the gas around so the inner surface of the jug is coated.
  Then add a few drops of potassium permanganate soultion into it and cap it.
  To blow it up, either throw it at something or roll it at something.
 
                          ): Hindenberg Bomb :(
 
    Needed:
 
         1 Balloon
         1 Bottle (preferably a pop bottle)
         1 Bottle of Liquid Plumr
         1 Piece Aluminum Foil
         1 Length fuse
 
  Fill the bottle 3/4 full with liquid plumr and add a little piece of foil
  to it. Put the balloon over the neck of the bottle until the balloon is 
  full of the resulting gas. This is highly flammable hydrogen. Now tie the
  balloon. Now light the fuse, and let it rise. When the fuse contacts the
  balloon, watch out!!!
 
 
                            ): Napalms, etc. :(
 
   Most fire bombs are simply gasoline filled bottles with a fuel soaked rag
   in the mouth (The bottle's mouth, not yours). The original Molotov
   Cocktail, and still about the best, was a mixture of on part gasoline
   and one part motor oil. The oil helps it cling to what it splatters on.
 
   Some use one part roofing tar and one part gasoline. Fire bombs have been
   found which were made by pouring melted wax into gasoline.
 
 
                           ): Match Head Bomb :(
 
   Simple saftey match heads in a pipe, capped at both ends, make a great
   bomb. It is set off with a regular fuse.
 
   A plastic baggie is put into the pipe before the heads go in to prevent
   detonation by contact with the metal.
 
   Cutting enough match heads to fill the pipe can be tedious work for one
   but an evening's fun for the family if you can drag them away from the TV.

        Over low flame till it melts. Stir well, then pour into container.
             Before it solidifies, pit a few matches in for fuses.

                         ((((((: THERMITE :))))))
 
   Thermite is a powerful substance which can burn through practically 
 anything, save tungsten. It is especially of use in trying to crack open a
 fortress fone. Now, here's how you make it:
 
   It is very simple. The first step in making thermite is to make hematite.
 Layman's terms, hematite is iron oxide (rust). Here is a good method of 
 making large quantities of rust. You will electrolyze a metal rod, such as
 a common nail. You will need a source of D.C. power as well. An electric
 train transformer is perfect. Attach the rod to the positive wire.
                                                     ^^^^^^^^
 Then, place the rod and the negative wire in opposite sides of a glass jar
 filled with water. Put a little salt in the water, just enough to make it 
 conduct well (a teaspoon). Let the setup sit overnight. In the morning, there
 be a dark red crud in the jar. Filter it all out of the water or fish it out
 with a spoon. Now you will need to dry it out. Heat it in an iron pot until
 it all turns a nice light red color. The other ingrediant you will need are
 are aluminum filings. You can either file down a bar of aluminum, or (as I
 suggest), buy aluminum filimgs at your local hardware shop. (if you buy the 
 bar, use no less than 94% pure aluminum. It's called 'Duralumin'.) That's 
 almost it. Now, mix together the rust and the filings. The ratio should be
 8 grams of rust per 3 grams of aluminum filings. That's thermite!!!
 
   Now, to light it! Stick a length of magnesium ribbon in a pile of the
 thermite. (Either steal it from your Chem. Lab or buy it at your local
 hardware store. If not, oreder from a chemical supply house, it's pretty 
 cheap.) The ribbon should stick into the thermite like a fuse. Now, light
 the magnesium with a blowtorch. (Don't worry!! The torch isn't hot enough
 to light the thermite.) When the burning magnesium reaches the thermite, it
 will light. When the thermite burns, get back! That stuff burns at 1000 F!! 
 Not only that, but it can vaporize carbon steel! It does wonders on human
 flesh.
 
                   (((: Shock Sensitive Explosive :)))    
 
  When petroleum jelly and potassium chlorate are mixed in a one to one ratio
 by weight, it makes a totally safe wet compound, but when dried it becomes
 highly explosive and shocksensitive. It's useful because you can whip up 
 just the right amount. There are several good places to put it. (Door hinges
 and other places.)
 
  Mix 3 grams of potassium iodide and 5 grams of iodine in a beaker with 50ml
 of water. Then add 20ml of ammonium hydroxide (ammonia water 10%). Filter 
 this substance and the resulting solid is called nitrogen triiodide. When 
 this is wet, it is safe, but when dry becomes highly explosive & shock
 sensitive.
 
 (To set off above explosives, put the mixture on or in something, then drop
 it sort of like an impact bomb. It, like a handgrenade will explode on
 contact with another object.)
