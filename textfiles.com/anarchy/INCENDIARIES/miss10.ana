+-----------------------------------++  Basic Explosives ][ by Milamber  ++   Part ][ : Kitchen Chemistry     ++-----------------------------------++ Thanx to all I thanked in Part I, ++ And special thanx to J.C. !!!!!!  ++-----------------------------------++  An Underground Library File      ++-----------------------------------+Part II-------Kitchen Chemistry-----------------   All the explosives in this file are fairly safe to make, easily made, and the materials are easy to get.  They are not very powerful, and are excellentfor terrorizing your neighbor.  A lot of the explosives hereafter use only two ingredients and therefore, do not recquire much in the way of detonators... I have some casings which I will describe in the following:Pipe Casing-----------This casing consists of two things: A pipe sealed on one end, a glass, sealablecontainer, and rocks.  The liquid is usually sealed inside the jar.  The solidis usually placed inside the pipe.  It worx like this: Place the liquid in thecontainer and seal it tightly!!!! A good idea would be to coat the joining withwax, or Vaseline.  Then put the solid down the pipe. Put some rocks in, and slide the jar in carefully... Place some more rocks in and seal the top of the pipe as best as possible...  A baby jar and appropiate pipe work great.  When ready to detonate, hit the pipe against something, this will break the jar, and let the stuff combine.  Then get rid of it!!!!!!!!!!!Jar casing----------  This casing is easier to make, all you need is a film container and a jar.One ingredient is placed in the plastic film container and capped.  A needle isused to punch small holes in the cap, about 1-2 holes will do.  Then placethe other ingredient in the jar.  WHEN, & only WHEN you are ready to detonate,drop the film container in the jar, close it, and get rid of it, NOW!!!A maynaise jar worx pretty good, although glass causes immense damage to people in the immediate vicinity, however, so be careful. 3 liter plastic coke deals are good too!!Coke Can Casing--------------- This is a variation of the jar casing, and is generally great for the classroom.  Fill the can with an ingredient, after letting the can dry in the sun, then take about two small paper towels and wrap the solid ingredient inthis... When ready to detonate force the paper towel with the solid inside it,down the little hole... drop it in a trashcan and move away.  Use small am'tsin order to spare yourself some problems....Time Delays:------------  These delays only work with the 2nd and 3rd variations:  Coat the solid inVaseline, or in the case of Idea#2, coat the top of the ingredient in the filmcontainer with a liquid soap.  This slows down the reaction.A (Not 5-6) Rule on Xplosives:------------------------------   Treat all explosives like a pressure sensitive H-Bomb.  There will be notrouble if you do.Formula #1----------  Crystal Drano and gasoline react violently... I think that this would be a good one for idea #1 and idea #2. In idea #1 place the gasoline in the container, and place the crystal Drano in the pipe... In idea #2 place the Drano in the 36 mm film container. and th gas in the jar.  I would put a delay on this one.Formula #2----------  This one is probably only good for idea#1, and it is extremely dangerous.  Inthis case, you need to get Calcium Carbide at a Hardware store (Calcium C. lamps use it)  Place the C.C. in the pipe.  Place the water in the jar, and wrap a wrag soaked in gasoline around it.  When ready to use, simply light therag, and break the jar... GET RID OF IT THEN!!! DANGEROUSER than the others, as the expanding gas blows the pipe apart, then gas is lit, and it explodes.Formula #3----------  This is an oldy, but goody, and the materials are beyond easy to get. Thematerials are: Baking Soda and Vinegar.  This one works for all three ideas,and is especially good for three, since it won't explode, just foam up because of the hole in the top.  It never hurts to be safe, so play with the am'ts... In idea#1 place the vinegar in the jar the same in #2.  In #3, placethe vinegar in the can.Formula #4----------  This one uses Granulated pool Chlorine and PineSol.  If it is not in a closedcontainer, a gout of flame will fire up. If in a container, an explosion results because of pressure. Very much like Formula #1.  Play with it in idea#3.  Place the solid in the paper towels and use small am'ts first.Thermite:--------- Thermite, is a mixture, of 25% aluminum filings, 75% iron oxide filings.When lit, by something like black powder, (I.E. Thermite core) it burns FIERCELY.  Recquires a fairly high temperature to start.Napalm------  The BEST formula for Napalm is gasoline and styrofoam.  Let it dissolve, andspoon out xs gasoline.Smoke Mixture-------------  This is mixture that burns fiercely, when fresh and low when not, but in anycase it gives off a dense white smoke.  It is composed of Potassium Nitrate andSugar in a ratio of 6 parts p.n. to 4 parts sugar.  Mix this all together, thenheat over a low flame.  It will slowly form a thick brown syrupy mixture.  Whenstill in a liquid form, pour it into a mold.  When still syrupy, it burns witha hot flame about 1 foot high.  Smoke Mixture #2----------------  This is a mixture of 6 parts charcoal, 3 parts potassium nitrate, and 1 partsulfur.  Mix well... It is very much like black powder, but smokes more, andstinks to the point of driving people away.  Less heavy on the potassium nitrate than the other.Nut Busters-----------  These are easy to make, and may be altered in power easily.  Take a shotgunshell, determine the gauge yourself, but start with a 20 gauge.  Tape a largemarble to the primer.  You may, or may not want to remove the shot.  I would STRONGLY suggest it.  All you do then is throw it.  The weight of the marble pulls it down, hits the primer, and puff.  Don't forget to be behind something if you leave the shot in.SODA BOMBS----------Ingredients:  Granulated Pool Chlorine (At least 75% Calcium Hypochlorite) - Sugar - Water - 2 Liter Soda Bottle     Take a quarter of Chlorine and place it in an empty and dry 2 literbottle.  Put the same amount of sugar and place it in the bottle too.  Addenough water to make the mixture soapy.  Put the cap on and throw it away!!!It splatters a noxious and blinding chemical when it goes off.  As the sugarand chlorine dissolve in the water, they will react with each other.  The Bombis as loud as an M-80.  The bomb will take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5minutes to go off.  So if it doesn't explode, still stay a way and come backthe next day and examine it.  If it doesn't work, try adjusting the amounts ofsugar and chlorine.  ** I didn't write this one, but thanx to whoever did **Black Powder------------Composition: 74% Potassium Nitrate(Saltpeter) 15.6% Charcoal 10.4% Sulfur Grind this all together, until you have a fine powder.  Put in a container andmix until it is nearly black.  Add some rubbing alcohol and mix together some more.  Use your imagaination on ways to mix it, just don't get it too hot.Black powder is used for a lot of things, including blasting, so don't forgetabout black powder, just because you want to make C-4!!! The ingredients maybe obtained at a drug store. ** Note:  Make sure you grind the Charcoal into a very fine powder!!! **Amidpulver----------  Amidpulver is a flahless, almost smokeless powder.  (When fired from a gun. It goes easier on the potassium nitrate than black powder, although it absorbswater from the air, and this deactivates it.  Store in a waterproofed containerCompositions:                     Amid #1   Amid #2Potassium Nitrate:    40%       14%Ammonium Nitrate:     38%       37%Charcoal              22%       49%Of the two, #2 is the better formula.Ammonium Nitrate is a fertilizer, and can be obtained at a feed store.+------------------------------------++  Call these TOXIC boards:          ++   The Mob 313-782-9519             ++   D.A. ][ 313-271-1095             ++   D.A.
