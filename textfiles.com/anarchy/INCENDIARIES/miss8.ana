+-----------------------------------++  ADVANCED EXPLOSIVES BY MILAMBER  ++        AND BEAVER CLEAVER         ++   PART I : PRIMARY EXPLOSIVES     ++-----------------------------------++  THANX TO J.C. FOR HIS HELP WITH  ++  PRIMARY EXPLOSIVES!!! THANKS TO  ++ DRAGON MASTER FOR VARIOUS RECIPES ++          ON EXPLOSIVES!           ++-----------------------------------++  AN UNDERGROUND LIBRARY FILE      ++-----------------------------------+INTRODUCTION:------------- TO BEGIN, IT IS NECESSARY TO REMEMBER THAT SECONDARY EXPLOSIVES ARE DETONATEDONLY BY ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE.  NAMELY, THE PRIMARY EXPLOSIVES.  IN THIS FILE, WEWILL DISCUSS HOW TO MAKE THESE EXPLOSIVES.  YOU WILL NOTE THAT IS MUCH MOREDANGEROUS TO PREPARE PRIMARY EXPLOSIVES. HOWEVER, THE EXPLOSIVES IN THIS FILEARE SAFE TO MAKE AS LONG AS ONE IS CAREFUL, SO USE COMMON SENSE AND READ ALLOF THE DIRECTIONS A FEW TIMES BEFORE STARTING.  DO NOT JUST START WITHOUT READING ALL OF THE CAUTIONS ON AN EXPLOSIVE!!! DDNP ----  DDNP IS A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE USED IN THE FABRICATION OF DETONATORS.  IT IS TO BE USED WITH A BOOSTER EXPLOSIVE SUCH AS PICRIC ACID OR RDX.MATERIALS:----------  PICRIC ACID (SEE FILE #IV)     FLOWERS OF SULFUR(DRUG STORE)  LYE(DRUG STORE)  SULFURIC ACID  POTASSIUM OR SODIUM NITRITE  WATER  TWO HEAT RESISTANT GLASS CUPS  STIRRING ROD  SCALE  PAPER TOWELS  TEASPOON AND TABLESPOON  EYEDROPPER  HEAT SOURCE  CONTAINERS  TAPE PROCEDURE --------- 1. IN ONE OF THE GLASS CUPS, MIX 1/2 A GRAM OF LYE WITH TWO TABLESPOONS WARM WATER. 2. DISSOLVE ONE TEASPOON OF PICRIC ACID IN THE WATER-LYE SOLUTION. STORE UNTIL STEP 5 3. PLACE 1/4 OF A TEASPOON (1 ML) OF WATER IN THE OTHER GLASS CUP.  ADD 1/2 A TEASPOON (2+1/2 GRAMS) OF SULFUR AND 1/3 OF A TEASPOON (2+1/2 G) OF LYE TO THE WATER. 4. BOIL SOLUTION OVER HEAT SOURCE UNTIL COLOR TURNS DARK RED.  REMOVE AND ALLOW TO COOL. 5. IN THREE PORTIONS ADD THE SULFUR-LYE SOLUTION TO THE PICRIC ACID-LYE SOLUTION.  STIR WHILE POURING.  ALLOW MIXTURE TO COOL. 6. FILTER MIXTURE THROUGH A PAPER TOWEL INTO A CONTAINER.  SMALL RED PARTICLES WILL COLLECT ON THE PAPER.  DISCARD THE LIQUID. 7. DISSOLVE THE RED PARTICLES IN 1/4 OF A CUP BOILING WATER. 8. SEE STEP 6.. EXCEPT DISCARD THE PARICLES LEFT ON THE PAPER  ------- 9. USING AN EYEDROPPER SLOWLY ADD THE SULFURIC ACID TO THE FILTERED SOLUTION UNTIL IT TURNS ORANGE-BROWN. 10. ADD 1/2 TEASPOON(2+1/2 G) MORE OF SULFURIC ACID TO THE SOLUTION.  ALLOW TO COOL TO ROOM TEPM. 11. IN A SEPARATE CONTAINER, DISOLVE 1/4 TEASPOON(1.8 G) OF SODIUM OR POTASSIUM NITRITE IN 1/3 CUP(80 ML.) OF WATER. 12. ADD THIS SOLUTION IN ONE PORTION WHILE STIRRING TO THE ORANGE-BROWN SLOUTION.  ALLOW THE MIXTURE TO STAND FOR 10 MINUTES.  THE MIXTURE WILL TURN LIGHT BROWN.*****CAUTION: KEEP MIXTURE AWAY FROM FLAME. MIXTURE IS NOW A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE***** LEAD PICRATE ------------  LEAD PICRATE IS USED AS A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE IN THE FASHIONING OF DETONATORS.IT IS TO BE USERD WITH A BOOSTER EXPLOSIVE SUCH AS PICRIC ACID OR R.D.X.MATERIALS:----------LEAD MONOXIDEPICRIC ACIDMETHYL ALCOHOLDISH OR SAUCER (CHINA OR GLASS)TEASPOONIMPROVISED SCALEFLAT PANCONTAINERSHEAT SOURCE(OPTIONAL)WATER(OPTIONAL) PROCEDURE --------- 1. WEIGH 2 GRAMS OF LEAD MONOXIDE AND PICRIC ACID. PLACE EACH IN A SEPERATECONTAINER. MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTAINER THAT YOU PLACE THE PICRIC ACID IN IS, IF IT IS METAL, TIN OR ALUMINUM. 2. PLACE 2 TEASPOONS (10 ML) OF ALCOHOL IN A DISH.  ADD THE PICIRC ACID TO THEALCOHOL AND STIR WITH A WOODEN OR PLASTIC ROD. 3. ADD THE LEAD MONOXIDE TO THE MIXTURE WHILE STIRRING.   ** CAUTION AT THIS POINT THE SOLUTION IS A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE - KEEP AWAY FROMHEAT AND FLAME!!!! ** 4. CONTINUE STIRRING THE MIXTURE UNTIL THE ALCOHOL HAS EVAPORATED.  THE MIXTURE WILL SUDDENLY THICKEN. 5. STIR MIXTURE OCCASIONALLY TO PREVENT LUMPS FROM FORMING UNTIL A POWDER HAS FORMED.  A FEW LUMPS WILL REMAIN. ** CAUTION, BE VERY CAREFUL OF DRY MATERIAL FORMING ON THE INSIDE OF THE CONTAINER ** 6. SPREAD THIS POWDERED MIXTURE (THE LEAD PICRATE) IN A FLAT PAN TO AIR DRY. NOTE: -----  IF POSSIBLE DRY THE MIXTURE IN A HOT, NOT BOILING WATER BATH FOR TWO HOURS. ** EXPLOSIVE IS SHOCK SENSITIVE WHEN DRY AND ONLY LESS SO WHEN WET ** MERCURY FULMINATE -----------------  MERCURY FULMINATE IS A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE USED IN THE FABRICATION OF DETONATORS.  IT IS TO BE USED WITH A BOOSTER EXPLOSIVE SUCH AS PICRIC ACID ORR.D.X.MATERIALS:----------NITRIC ACIDMERCURYETHYL ALCOHOL 90% PUREPAPER TOWELSTEASPOON MEASURE (ALUMINUM OR WAX COATED)HEAT SOURCECLEAN WOODEN STICKCLEAN WATERGLASS CONTAINERSTAPE PROCEDURE: ---------- 1. DILUTE 5 TEASPOONS OF NITRIC ACID WITH 2 AND 1/2 TEASPOONS OF CLEAN WATERIN A GLASS CONTAINER BY ADDING THE ACID TO THE WATER. 2. DISSOLVE 1/8 TEASPOON OF MERCURY IN THE ACID WATER SOLUTION.  DARK RED FUMES WILL FORM.  DO NOT INHALE FUMES!  NOTE: IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ADD ONE DROP OF WATER, AT A TIME TO START THE REACTION. 3. WARM 10 TEASPOONS OF ALCOHOL IN A CONTAINER UNTIL THE ALCOHOL FEELS WARMTO THE INSIDE OF THE WRIST. 4. POUR THE METAL-ACID SOLUTION INTO THE WARM ALCOHOL.  REACTION SHOULD STARTIN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.  DENSE WHITE FUMES WILL BE GIVEN OFF DURING THE REACTION.  ALLOW 15 TO 20 MINUTES FOR RECTION TO FINISH. FULMINATE WILL SETTLETO THE BOTTOM.   ** CAUTION THIS REACTION GENERATES LARGE QUANTITIES OF TOXIC FUMES. DO THISSTEP OUTDOORS.  DO NOT INHALE FUMES ** 5. FILTER THE SOLUTION THROUGH THE PAPER TOWELS.  CRYSTALS MAY STICK TO THE SIDE OF THE CONTAINER.  WASH THEM DOWN WITH A SQUIRT OF WATER. 6. WASH THE CRYSTALS WITH 6 TEASPOONS OF ETHYL ALCOHOL. ** HANDLE DRY EXPLOSIVES WITH EXTREME CARE ** TRANSPORT ONLY WHEN WET!!!! TETRAMINE COPPER ][ CHLORATE (TACC) ------------------------------------  THIS IS A PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE THAT CAN BE MADE FROM SODIUM CHLORATE, COPPER SULFATE AND AMMONIA.

STORE IN A COOL DRY PLACE **SOME OF THE FOLLOWING MAY NOT BE PRODUCED DUE TO UNAVAILABILITY OF NECESSARYCHEMICALS.  I WILL TRY TO HAVE A FORMULA FOR PRODUCTION OF THE NECESSARY CHEMICALS IN ABOUT 1-3 MONTHS.LEAD AZIDE---- -----   RATE OF DETONATION:4500 M/SEC.THIS IS SENSITIVE CRYSTALS LIKEMERCURY FULMINATE, BUT EASIER TO MAKE. AND SAFER. IT IS USED IN DETONATERSAND CAN BE STORED FOR 15 MONTHS AT UP TO 80 DEGREES WITHOUT DECOMPOSITION.IT IS MADE BY SLOW ADDITION OF DILUTE SODIUM AZIDE TO DILUTE LEAD ACETATEOR LEAD NITRATE WITH CONSTANT STIRRING. RAPID MIXING OF MORE CONCENTRATEDSOLTUTIONS MAKES AMORPHOUS AZIDE, WHICH IS MORE STABLE. DEXTRINATED LEAD AZIDEIS MADE BY ADDING A SOLUTION OF SODIUM AZIDE CONTAINING A LITTLE SODIUMHYDROXIDE TO A SOLUTION OF LEAD NITRATEOR ACETATE AND DEXTRIN. THE PRECIPITATE LEAD AZIDE IS WASHED WITH WATER ANDSTORED LIKE MERCURY FULMINATE. IT SHOULD CONTAIN AT LEAST 20% WATER WHEN STORED.LEAD STYPHNATE---- ---------LESS SENSITIVE THAN MERCURY FULMINATE OR LEAD AZIDE(WHICH ARE SENSITIVE TOEVERYTHING), BUT MORE SENSITIVE TO HEAT. BASIC LS IS MADE BY MIXING SOLTIONSOF LEAD ACETATE AND  SODIUM OR MAGNESIUM STYPHNATE. THIS IS PRETTY USELESS,BUT CAN BE MADE INTO A SALT BYTREATMENT WITH DILUTE NITRIC ACID OR BY TREATING A SOLUTION OF LEAD NITRATEWITH SODIUM STYPHNATE IN THE PRESENCE OF ACETIC ACID. THIS IS USED IN BLASTINGCAPS. IT CAN BE STORED UNDER WATER OR MIX OF WATER & ALCOHOL.+------------------------------------++  CALL THESE TOXIC BOARDS:          ++   THE MOB 313-782-9519             ++   D.A. ][ 313-271-1095             ++   D.A.
