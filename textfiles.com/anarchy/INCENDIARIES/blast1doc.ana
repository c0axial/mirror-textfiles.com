                       Making Explosives Report #1
                              by: Blackbolt

     This is the first of several reports on the building of
     explosives from commonly available materials. Some basic
     preparations are discussed in this report that I feel
     everyone has the right to know, despite itsdestructive
     nature. This report will be followed by others relating to
     the same subject.

                               Nitric Acid
     The first thing we will discuss is the making of nitric
     acid. This is the one ingredient in many high explosive
     compounds that will be the most difficult to get your hands
     on. Some chemical companies sell this acid, but they insist
     on sending it motor freight, so it costs a bundle just to
     get the stuff to your house. Besides, if you ordered it, the
     government would know you had it and that is not good (They
     know just as well as I do what some ordinary guy wants to do
     with nitric). The first step in making the acid is to obtain
     the needed materials: Battery acid      (Auto parts store)
                           Potassium nitrate (Drug or fertilizer
                                              store)
                           Two glass jugs    (Juice jars, etc.)
                           Some rags         (Old clothes)
                           Some tape, NOT
                            cellophane       (Duct tape, etc.)
                           Heat source       (Fire, Torch, etc.)
                           Water             (The faucet, dummy)
     The first thing you need to do is to concentrate the battery
     acid (Sulpheric acid). To do this, just boil the acid until
     dense, white fumes appear, and no it is not fun to breath
     them (At ALL), so don't do it. You will need equal
     quantities of acid and granulated pottasium nitrate. Put the
     two chemicals into one jar and then press the other jar's
     mouth to the filled jar's mouth and wrap the joint with
     rags. Next, wrap the rag joint with tape. Then lay the
     assembly horizontal and raise the filled bottle above the
     empty bottle. Next, apply heat to the filled bottle until
     red fumes appear, then pour water over the empty bottle.
     Continue this procedure until there is you have about as
     much condensed liquid as the amount of sulpheric acid that
     you put in. Let the assembly cool, throw away the rags and
     tape and pour out the condensed liquid, this is your nitric
     acid.
                              Nitroglycerin
     Nitroglycerin is one of the first popular high explosive
     compounds that came into use. It is very sensitive
     when frozen and causes headaches when absorbed through skin.
     Nitroglycerin (Nitro) is oxygen positive, which means it
     releases oxygen when it decomposes. It is also the explosive
	  ingredient in dynamite. Nitroglycerin, like all high
	  explosives requires a detonator to set it off, so don't run
	  off and try to light it with a match. However, a good way to
	  test any homemade explosive brew is to put a teeny drop on
	  an anvil and then hit it with a hammer. The procedure to
	  manufacture the oily substance is pretty easy to follow,
	  but the directions  must be  followed  exactly. Use a
	  stainless  steel  thermometer to  keep  immersed in the
	  nitration  vessel at  all times, and  if at  any time  the
	  temperature  goes above  20 degrees C,  or if red   fumes
	  appear  dump  the  entire mixture  into a  large volume
     of cold water. If this is not done, an unpleasant accident
     will occur and I can assure you that it would not be very
     enjoyable to be anywhere nearby if this happened. The first
     step is to obtain equal amounts of concentrated supheric
     acid and concentrated nitric acid. Pour the nitric into the
     nitration vessel and then pour the SULPHERIC INTO THE
     NITRIC. Mix and let cool before proceeding. Next, add
     glycerin drop by drop into the acids. It is a good practice
     to have the nitration vessel sitting in a container of cold
	  water. Also, stir the mix constantly as you add the glycerin.
	  After you have added about 1/6 the volume of the mixed acids of
	  glycerin, slowly pour the whole mix into about 10 times its
	  volume of cold water. You will see a layer of oil form in the
	  bottom of the water container, this is your nitro. First, pour off
	  as much excess liquid as you can without losing any nitro. Then
	  pour in more water to restore the fluid to its original volume, then
	  pour off again. Repeat this procedure at least 4 times. Make sure you
	  end up with the container holding the original volume, then
	  neutralize the solution with potassium carbonate (Preffered), or
	  sodium bicarbonate. Don't add too much. After neutralization, let the
	  mixture settle and then suck the nitro off the bottom with a turkey
	  baster. Store it out of the light in a plastic or glass container.
	  Then wash your hands, crack open a beer, turn on the TV, and
	  congratulate yourself for making your first nitro!

          Have fun, be careful, and keep your eye out for more of these
	  reports
