======================================

  CONDENSATION IN A CAR'S GAS TANK PUTS A LAYER OF WATER ON THE BOTTOM.  GELATIN
CAPSULES FILLED WITH ONE PART CALCIUM CARBIDE AND ONE PART PURE SODIUM ARE
DROPPED INTO A CAR'S GAS TANK.IN A FEW MINUTES THERE IS AN EXPLOSION THAT YOU
HAVE TO SEE TO BELIEVE.

  GELATIN CAPSULES,FILLED WITH MORE GELATIN FOR STRONG FINGERNAILS, ARE BOUGHT
AT THE SUPERMARKET.THE GELATIN IS EMPTIED FROM THE CAPSULES AND A B-B IS PUT
INTO EACH TO MAKE IT SINK TO THE BOTTOM.SLIVERS OF METALLIC SODIUM AND CHUNKS OF
CALCIUM CARBIDE ARE THEN PUT INTO THE CAPSULES.

  THE CAPSULES ARE CARRIED IN A PLASTIC BAG TO KEEP THEM DRY.

  THREE OR FOUR CAPSULES ARE DROPPED INTO A CAR'S GAS TANK.SEVERAL MINUTES,OR UP
TO A HALF HOUR LATER, THE CAPSULES DISINTEGRATE AND THE MOISTURE TURNS THE
CARBIDE INTO EXPLOSIVE GAS AND ALSO IGNITES THE SODIUM.THE BURNING SODIUM
IGNITES THE CARBIDE GAS AND THERE IS AN EXPLOSION THAT'S WORTH THE TIME IT TOOK
YOU TO MAKE THESE LITTLE BEAUTIES.....

  NOTE:SODIUM IS STORED IN KEROSENE, AS IT IGNITES ON CONTACT WITH MOISTURE.IT
SHOULD BE HANDLED CAREFULLY,WHILE WEARING DRY CLOTH GLOVES AND GOGGLES.
