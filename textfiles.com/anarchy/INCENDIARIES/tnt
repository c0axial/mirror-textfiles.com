Probably the most important explosive
compound in use today is TNT
(trinitrotoluene).  This and other very
similar types of high explosives ar all
used by the military, because of their
fantastic power- about 2.25 millions
pounds per square inch, and there
great stability.  TNT also has the
great advantage of being able to be
melted at 82 degrees F., so that it
can be poured into shells, mortars,
or any other projectiles.  Military
TNT comes in containers which
resemble drycell batteries, and are
usually ingnited by an electrical
charge, coupled with an electical
blasting cap, although there are
other methods.

Preparation of TNT

1. Take two beakers.  In the first
prepare a solution of 76 percent
sulfuric acid, 23 percent nitric acid
and 1 percent water.  In the other
beaker, prepare another solution of 57
percent nitric acid and 43 percent
sulfuric acid (percentagess are on a
weight ratio rather than volume).

2. Ten grams of the first solutions
are poured into an empty beaker and
placed in an ice bath.

3. Add ten grams of toluene, and stir
for several minutes.

4. remove this beaker from the ice bath
and gently heat until it reaches 50
degrees C.  The solution is stirred
constantly while being heated.

5. Fifty additional grams of the acid,
from the first beaker, are added and
the temperature is held for the next
ten minutes, and an oily liquid will
begin to form on the top of the acid.

6. After 10 or 12 minutes, the ou too will have to take
a nice long shower.
