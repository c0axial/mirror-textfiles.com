    One simple, but effective trick is to apply the simplest of 
plastiques to an outlet and blow it out.

        First take two paperclips and bend them straight.  Next,                     |     | 
you take a pencil with an eraser and insert them like this:

    Hopfully you should be able to figure out my quite awkward 
drawing.  Anywayz, now you spread your plastique all over the socket 
(making sure none acually gets inside the outlets)(this should be done 
in a bathroom).  And finally, as you probably guessed, you stick your 
psychotic-looking "tool" into the socket, so that each paperclip goes 
into each outlet.  This step should be done with extreme care, making 
sure you have not put too much plastique on unless you are planning to 
have finger fricasee for supper.  As you now should have noticed, 
there is a bright flare of light, and a popping sound.  This is an 
electric explosion, and it ignites the plastique, sending flaming 
Bits 'O' Jelly everywhere.  This makes for quite a mess, and I'm sure 
you will feel most proud of yourself.  If at all possible, make sure 
to get a look at the custodian's face after going in there!

    For those amateurs who do not know how to make plastique, here is 
a simple method: 
                     
                          <InGrEdIaNtS> 
 
                1. 2 parts petrollium jelly (vasoline) 
                2. 1 part gasoline 
 
    Simply mix these ingrediants in a container (not one you have to 
eat in).  This substance usually has to be ignited electricly, so 
don't go lighting it with matches, and then come bitching to me that 
it doesn't work.
