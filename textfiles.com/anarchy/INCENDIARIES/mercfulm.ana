When employing the use of any high explosive,an individual must also use some kind of
detonating device.Blasting caps are probably the most popular today,since they are very
functional and relativly stable.The prime ingrediant in most blasting caps and de
tonating devices in general is mercury fulminate.There are several methods for preparing
mercury fulminate.

Method No.1 for the preparation of
      Mercury Fulminate:

1. Take 5 grams of pure mercury and mix is with 35 ml. of nitric acid.

2.The mixture is slowly and gentle heated.As soon as the solution bubbles and turns
green, one knows that the silver mercury is dissolved.

3. After it is dissolved, the solution should be poured,slowly,into a small flask of
ethyl alcohol.This will result in red fumes.

4. After a half hour or so,the red fumes will turn white, indicating that the process
is nearing its final stage.

5. after a few minutes, add distilled water to the solution.

6. The entire solution is now filtered, in order to obtain the small white
crystals.These crystals are pure mercury fulminate,but should be washed many times, and
tested with litmus paper for any remaining undersiable acid.


  Method No. 2 for the preparation of
   Mercury Fulminate:

1. Mix one part mercuric oxide with ten parts ammonia solution.When ratios are
described,they are always done according to weight rather than volume.

2. After waiting eight to ten days,one will see that the mercuric oxide has reacted with
the ammonia solution to produce the white fulminate crystals.

3. These crystals must be handled in the same way as the first method described, in that
they must be washed many times and given several litmus paper tests.

 



    Many other fulminates can be made in the same manner as above,but i will not go into
these,since most are extremely unstable and sensitive to shock.All fulminates including
mercury fulminate,are sensitive to shock and friction,and in no circumstances 
should they be handled in a rough or careless manner..
