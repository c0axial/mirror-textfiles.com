DISCLAIMER: Why the hell do people always write these stupid things??? If some dumb fuck gets hurt while he trys to make this thats there problem not mine.  If they want to they can spend a half a year trying to find out my name and address and then spend a couple hundred dollars to sue me, I dont care.


Ok, now that we got that out of the way I can tell you what all this is about.
Now that the end of the year is coming and many people are graduating from High School there will be a lot of people making pranks at school.  So i decided to do the same.  The first thing you will need is some water proof wick, the stuff that i bought was $2.00 (Get it at any hobby store that sells rockets and stuff like that) and i got 10 ft. of it and the wick burns at 30 sec/ft. which is pretty slow for wicks. The second thing you will need is a water proof container.  I used a little bottle of Carmex and just took all the shit out of it and made a little hole in the metal top.  Just about any glass or metal container will work. If you find that the container has a little hole in it or that water slowly leaks through the lid then just use some wax to seal the holes.  The last thing you need is some explosives. A good explosive that can be easly made is that shit that they put in the model rocket engines.  Just go to the store and buy some rocket engines (not bottle rockets) and make sure you get the big ones (they cost about $3 for two or three).  Then just take a screwdriver or something sharp and scrap out all the black powder shit from it. Now take they black shit and grind it up into a fine powder.  It is important that you do this because if you just use the big chunks it wont work as good.  You can always use firecrakers too. Just crack them in half and and squeeze and twist them at the same time and the silvery stuff will come out. You will be surprised at how much powder there is in some firecrackers.  Of course a home brewed explosive of your own kind can also be used.  

Now for the construction of the toilet bomb. First thing to do is fill up the container with your explosive and if you want a crack toilet put some BB's or small rocks in there too.  Now take about 3 feet of the wick (or enough wick to make it burn for a minute or two) and stick it all the way down into the explosive. Now take the cap and make a hole in it and screw it on.  Now get a candle and get some wax and seal up any holes in the container and put some wax around where the wick goes through the cap.  After you do this and the wax dries be careful not to move the wick around too much cause it will crack the wax and tCall The Works BBS - 1600+ Textfiles! - [914]/238-8195 - 300/1200 - Always Open
