                     - DECENT BOMBS FROM JIFFY MARKERS -
           
        Anyone who has ever went to school MUST know what a Jiffy marker 
is... Ya know, those little boxes of 3 inch markers... asstd. colors...
and you always went to use 'em in class to make posters and shit with but
they were all worn out and dead? yep.. Well next time just snag yourself
a couple of em... and follow these directions....

- The REAL BORiNG class after social or whatever... go and grab some 
  paperclips off of the teachers desk.
- Proceed to remove the marker lid... and unscrew the plastic part that
  has the worn out tip thing in it...
- Take out the little clear plastic washer thingy... and then bend your
  stolen paperclip into a hooky thingy so that you can wrench out the 
  fluffy ink thing from inside the marker...
- Chuck the fluffy ink thing at some lamer....
- Screw the marker back together... dont forget the plastic washer thingy...
  and take your casing home... (Notice how HOLLOW and METALLiC your marker 
  seems, you can almost imagine it bursting into little pieces of shrapnel 
  as you sit there.
- OK... Decision time... I can think of 3 simple ways in which to use this
  newly aquired casing.... 

  1. MATCH HEAD bomb... (SiMPLE)
      Just take a bunch of matches... grab some scissors... and proceed to
  remove the heads from the matches... put the heads in the empty casing and 
  discard (or keep and make log cabins out of em) the match sticks... 
  Basically your done... cept for the fuse... Which will come later...

  2. GUN\BLACK powder... (MoRE DiFFiCULT)
      Ok... GUN\BLACK powder... Personally... id Buy decent Gun\Black powder,
  But... not everyone has access  to buying the stuff... so heres a quick
  little recipie c\o THE PRECEPTOR -
         
         iNGRîDiîNTS:Salt Peter (Used in pickling)
                     Aluminum Filings (Steal it from the I.A. Room)
                     Sugar
                     and a DAB of oil

         MiX em together... put the dab of oil on the mixture...
         there ya go....

   But if you're gonna buy the best and most reactive powder to get is 4x
   gun\black  powder... if ya need help on places to buy it... call
   M’D and we'll give ya an address\name of place... Just stuff the marker
   with the powder and you're almost done...Fuses still remain
   separate near the end here...

   3. MODEL ROCKET ENGiNE.. (EXPENSiVE)
       Nuff said.. just buy or steal some rocket engines... and then cut em
   up and take the shit you get... grind it up into fine powder... put it in
   the marker casing and do the fuse thingy...

                                   FUSES

    THEORETICAL FUSeS USed...

    STRiNG FUSE #1   (Taken from a TFiLE by DARK CREEPER 1986)
    
      Material Required:
      -----------------
                                   ÚÄ 
      Soft Cotton String           ³  Potassium Nitrate 25 parts
      Fine Black Powder ÄÄÄÄÄ> or Ä´  Charcoal           3 parts
      Piece of Round Stick         ³  Sulphur            2 parts
      Two Pans or Dishes           ÀÄ 

      Procedure:
      ---------

      1. Moisten fine Black Powder to form a paste or prepare a
      substitute as follows:

          A. Dissolve Potassium Nitrate in an equal amount of
          water.
          B. Pulverize charcoal by spreading thinly on a hard
          surface and rolling the round stick over it to crush to
          fine powder.
          C. Pulverise the sulphur in the sam manner.
          D. Dry mix sulphur an charcoal.
          E. Add Potassium Nitrate solution to dry mix to obtain
          a thoroughly wet paste.

      2. Twist of braid three strands of cotton string together.

      3. Rub paste mixture into twisted string with fingers and
      allow to dry.

      4. Check the actual burning rate of the fuse by measuring the
      time it takes for a known legth to burn. This is used to
      determine the length needed for the desired time.

      
STRiNG FUSE #2

      MATERIALS NEEDED...
       YARN
       WAX
       BLACK\GUN POWDER (Fine Grain)
       
       - Take the wax... melt it.. 
       - Dip the string in the wax...
       - Sprinkle Powder on the string.. .(it sticks to the wax..)

TAPE FUSE  

       MATERIALS NEEDED...
        Scotch tape
        GUN\BLACK POWDER (fine grain)

       - take a LONG piece of tape... 
       - Sprinkle Powder on the sticky side... 
       - light it and run like hell..
         (VERY fast Fuse)


        THESE fuses.. Hard to get to work... BUT its not all you can try.
One would think that the felt tip which travels through the cap into the
opening would be a good fuse.. BUT its not.. .even when removed and soaked
in hard liquor it still wont remain lit through the opening in the cap.
BUT just remove the felt thingy... put the fuse through the hole so that 
it will ignite the contents of your little BooMer... 

        Watch yourself and others when playing with these things.. and
the usual... if you blow your arm off while doin this.. I and îDJî will not
be hld responsible... Have fun...
