  Welcome back to Pyro-Tech magizine hope you all enjoyed the last
  issue,I would like for some of you out there to send in some ideas
  though,it's kinda hard to gather enough information to make one of
  these magizines every month,this issue probally won't be as long
  as the first one but I don't really know because I haven't started
  to type any of it yet,well enough with the intro shit,let's get this
  mutha' fuckin' file started­­­


ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

                          The Spoke Gun
======================================================================


   Intro : (Shut up,I don't care if you hate intros,I like to write
           them!) The spoke gun is a simple yet sorta powerful gun
           that you can use to bug your little brother or sister
           or use in school(At your own risk).


  Items needed:
 
  1. A spoke - Avalible from your next door neighbors new bike
  2. A couple of boxes of matches
  3. A sheet of aluminum foil


  How to make:

  1. Rip a spoke off of your neighbors bike and shape it like this

                   -------------------===
                  /     |                 \
                 /  ----|                  The thingy that joins the
                /       Spoke              spoke to the wheel
               /

  2. Take some matches and file off the tips,put the grounded up match
     tips and pack them into the little hole where the fastener of
     the spoke is.

  3. Tear off a peice of foil and roll it into a little ball,and pack
     it into the end of the spoke.

  4. Now to shoot your gun all you have to do is hold a match or
     lighter under the end of the spoke and bang! The foil shoots off
     a pretty decent distance.

   Another intro : All this is,is a thing to make to annoy your room-
                   mate or people in school.

   Items needed:

   1. Matches
   2. Foil

   How to make

   1. Cut one half square inch of foil and wrap it neatly and tightly
      around the end of a match.

   2. Hold lighter under the end of match and it will shoot up about
      four or five feet.


   To make a launcher simply shape a paper clip sp it will stand up
   hold a match at the same time.


======================================================================
                          Unstable Explosive
======================================================================

  Intro : This is a pretty decent sized explosion, but just remember
          to make sure that you don't throw it near anyone(Ha ha)!

  1. Mix solid nitric iodine with household ammonia.
  2. Wait overnight
  3. Pour off liguid
  4. Dry mud on bottom till hard (Like concrete)
  5. Throw something at it!!!!


======================================================================
                         Medium Explosive
======================================================================

    Intro : This is a nice little explosive if you let it harden
            you can throw it and it will explode

  1. Mix 7 parts potassim chlorate to 1 part petroleum jelly.
  2. To ignite use an electric charge or a long fuze.

======================================================================
                             Car Bomb
======================================================================

    Intro : All I have to say is be carful when using this one

  1. Put liquid drano into a pillbox (The kind you get when you're on
     a prescription)
  2. Close the lid and put it into someone's gas tank,make sure the
     car isn't running though.


 
======================================================================
                             Smoke Bomb
======================================================================

    Intro : This is a smoke bomb,I don't know if it works or not
            but they say four pounds of this stuff will fill a block
            If it does tell me.

  1. Mix 3 parts sugar to 6 parts epson salts
  2. Put in a can, and heat it over a low flame untill it melts
  3. Let it get hard(Show some playboys to do this)
  4. Stick in a match for a fuse before it gets too hard
  5. Stick it in a public bathroom and light it.


======================================================================
                          Car Smoke Screens
======================================================================

   Intro :  Another fun topic other then destroying cars is protecting
            them and their contents from pursuers.  A diagram  would
            fit only a few of the vehicles but this explantation
            should be under-stood by anybody at all handy with cars
            and trucks.

    First a hole is drilled in the exhaust manifold the size of the
  nozzle of a paint or plant sprayer.  When the nozzle is welded in
  place a length of gas line is affixed to the nozzlw tube and feed
  into the driver's compartment.

    The gas line is then attached to the spary unit inside the
  driver's compartment under the dash.

    To use, the container is filled with castor oil, bought at any
  local grug store.  Burned castor oil will blot out everything on the
  road behind you.  A friend (of the author) tried this and just put
  in a few short squirts to see what it would do.  The effect from his
  exhaust pipe was so wild it looked like a bomb had been dropped on
  the freeway.

    He was so startled he allowed himself to be pulled over by a cop
  and he almost got locked up for it.  He could have gotten away if he
  had made a smokey run for it.

    It is the hot exhaust manifold which turns the castor oil into
  smoke.  Smoke screens in war are made using this simple principle. 
  Crank case oil to be thrown away is great for making smoke screens. 
  It could also highlight the udea of recycling in your area.

    On the road, the smoke not only causes pursuers to slow down in
  order to see, but it causes panic among the other motorists on the
  road.  This makes the police stop the chase as the trafic hazards
  are greater then your capture would be to them.

                             Mailbox Systems
======================================================================

    Mailbox systems are the link between information and the
  underworld. If you have ever called one, then you will know the
  advantages of having one,especially the ones that are  open to whole
  underworld, rather than just a select few.  There are two types  of
  mailbox systems that are widely used. The first type we will talk
  about is the multiple mailbox systems, or commonly referred to  as 
  message  systems.  These  systems  have  several mailboxes set up on
  one number.  Usually, you  can access other  mailboxes from that 
  number  by  pressing '*' or '#'.  Sometimes you  just enter
  themailbox number and you are connected.  These are the safest
  systems to use to protect information from US Sprint and other long
  distance  companies. Since US Sprint and other companies  call  the
  destination  numbers, it is safer to  have 800 mailbox systems, and 
  most  of  the time, the  multiple mailbox systems  are on 800
  numbers.  The  passcode on  these  systems can vary in length and
  can be accessed by several  different methods, so it is impossible
  to explain exactly how to hack these systems.
 
    The other type is the single mailbox system.  These  are usually
    set up in a reserved  prefix in an area  code.  (Ex: 713-684-6xxx)
    These systems are usually  controlled by the  same type of
    hardware/software.  To access the area  where you  enter the 
    passcode, just hit '0' for a second or so. 
    The passcodes are  four (4)  digits  long.  The only way to hack
    these is manually.  The best thing you could do is to  find one
    that does not  have a recording from a person, but just the
    digitized voice.  If you hack one that  someone already  owns,
    they will  report it and  it will not last as long.

       Here is a list mailboxes or prefixes to help you get started

                     How To Tap Your Own Phone Line(s)
======================================================================

       --This article was origanally written by the Time Lord--



    Intro : Many of you, like me, would (and probably already have)
  like to find other means of recording/tapping phone lines in your
  own home. Maybe it's a VMB message that talks at 100 words/second or
  maybe just saving some telephone conversations that you'd like to
  save for future blackmail.  Whatever the case, here is the simple
  (and so fucking obvious) solution...

  Materials needed:


  Here's what you'll need: 

    1. Telephone extension cord RCA-type extension cord (the type for
       stereos)

    2. Knife (anything that will splice wires) Electric Tape (Almost
       any type of tape will do)

    3. Stereo/Amplifier (Duh!)

    4. The IQ of a small rock

  How to make:


    For those of you who have ever spliced wires together, skip this
  paragraph and read on to the advantages of your concotion.  For the
  rest of you dumbshits, here's how to do it: First off, chop off
  about 2-3 feet (hell if its long, chop as much as you want!) from
  the telephone cord, making sure to keep the telephone prongy-thingy
  (the one you plug into he wall) on one end and four (or two
  depending) cut-off wires (inside the main cable) on the other.Do the
  same with the RCA extension cord, making sure to keep
  the RCA-adapter-thingy (the one ya plug into the stereo) on one end
  and two cut-off wires (inside the main cable, usually one bare metal
  and the other in another wire...) on the other.
     
    Next, "splice" the ends together by picking the two middle wires
  from the phone cord (the red and green wires, if that helps) and
  cutting the rubber around them with the knife so that bare wire is
  showing.  Next take two of them (one from the rca and one from the
  phone cord) and wrap them around each other. Use the electric tape
  to cover up this connection (make sure no bare wire is "peeking"
  out).  Then do the same with the other two.  Then maybe wrap some
  more around the lot just for the hell of it.

People with two lines


    If you have two lines the middle two on the phone cord (red and
  green) are line 1 and the two outer ones (black/blue and yellow) are
  line 2.  So you can pick which line you want to hook up to.

Results
-------

    Now you have one big-ass cord!  Okay, now take the phone end and
  plug it into (guess where!) any open phone outlet (Don't worry it
  won't take your phone "off the hook" no matter how long you leave it
  plugged in).  Take the RCA end and plug it intothe auxillary
  /cd/phono outlet in the back of your stereo.

    Turn on the stereo and you're ready to rock!  The input level is
  pretty low so "pump up the volume!!!".  It should only come out of
  one speaker, but you will able to not only record and listen to your
  own conversations, but anyone in the house using that phone line
  will also be picked up (Blackmail sisters, brothers, and parents!!!)

Reasoning
---------

    The reason I wrote this was that a pretty good friend of mine
  took his whole fucking phone apart to do the same thing I just
  explained (and he can't record others conversations without there
  being a difference in sound, i.e. the person at your end sounds "far
  away")  I wanted to save the rest of you dumbshits from yourselves!

    Why the fuck should I have one???  Like someone's gonna really
  track me down for writing a fucking g-file!!!  Personal greets go
