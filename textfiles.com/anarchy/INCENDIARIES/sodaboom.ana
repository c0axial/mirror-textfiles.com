   This is an anti-personnel bomb meant for milling crowds.  The bottom of a
soft drink can is half cut out and bent back.  A giant firecracker or other
explosive is put in and surrounded with nuts and bolts or rocks.  The fuse is
then armed with a chemical delay in a plastic drinking straw.

   After first making sure there are no children nearby, the acid or glycerine
is put into the straw and the can is set down by a tree or wall where it will
not be knocked over.  The delay should give you three to five minutes.	It will
then have a shattering effect on passersby.

   It is hardly likely that anyone would pick up and drink from someone else's
soft drink can.  But if such a crude person should try to drink from your bomb
he would break a nasty habit fast!
