--------[Typed by Chris Jones]---------

Materials:
1.  DRY two liter bottle
2.  Measuring cup
3.  Chlorox bleach
4.  Ammonia
5.  Funnel
6.  (Optional) gas mask

Procedure:

1.  Put the funnel in the two liter 
bottle.

2.  Pour in one-half cup of Chlorox.

3. Pour in one-half cup of ammonia.

4.  Pull out the funnel FAST, screw
cap on lightly on and THROW FAR!!!!

For all of you that scientificly,
what happens is enough chlorine gas
accumilates that it eventually blows
the cap off.

--------------[=NOTE=]-----------------
Chlorine gas causes leumonia which
is phneumonia of the lungs. It is
very painful as well as fatal so don't
fuck with it too much.
And make sure that your dog isn't 
around when you throw it and trys to
go get it.
