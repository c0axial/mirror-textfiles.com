CASTEXPL.ONE - Plastic Explosives
 
[CAST EXPLOSIVES]
 
Potassium Chlorate 33 parts, Potassium Nitrate 33 parts, Sugar 24 parts,
Powdered Coal 10 parts. Mix in enogh water to dissolve the chemicals and make
a stiff putty. Form by hand to the disired shape and allow to dry
 
 
 
 
 
NOTE:  Sodium Chlorate can be substituted for Potassium Chlorate in most
formulas.  Sodium Chlorate contains more oxygen than Potassium Chlorate. Sodium
Chlorate is moisture absorbent.
 
NOTE: Sodium Nitrate can be substituted for Potassium Nitrate in most formulas.
 
 
[PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES #1]
 
A plastic explosive used by Germany during WWII. Potassium Chlorate 96%, Fuel
oil 4%. Or Sodium ChlHrate and fuel oil.
 
 
 
[NITROGEN TRIIODIDE]
 
Mix 1 pint of laundry type Ammonium with 4 ounces of drug store type Iodine.
Shake well for 5 minutes. Pour the mixture through a Mr. Coffee Filter.  Throw
away the liquid. The dark red mud like material in the filter is nitrogen
Triiodide. When dry it is very unstable. very very very sensitive to friction, 
heat, shock, static electricity, etc. Apply w
and allow to dry. Very High Explosive. So sensitive that it will explode when
touched with a feather.
 
[PLASIC EXPLOSIVES #2]
 
Mix 8 parts Potassium Chlorate to every 1 part Vassaline.  Heat over a small
flame (Like a match) for 2 minutes.  Use an Electronic Detonator to set off.
 
[ANS]
 
Grind up 10 lbs. of Ammonium Nitrate in a blender.  Mix in 1 lb. Sulfur.  Mix
well.  Place 1/4 of the mixture in a 6x6x6 cardboard box.  Use the cardboard
tube from a toilet paper roll.  Cut the tube in half.  Tape one end shut.
Place fuse in one side of the Tube.  Fill tube with FLASH POWDER.  Tape the
other end of the tube shut.  This is the detonator for the ANS.  Place the
detonator in the center of the box and fill the box with ANS.  The above
mixture will make 2 5 lb. boxes of ANS.
