   This article will deal with the production of type 'C' plastic explosive
compound.  If you have not read my other two articles, you will need to so you
can get some safety precations and the recipe for making R.D.X.  All of the
type 'C' plastic explosives (that includes C-2, C-3, and C-4) are exceedingly
powerful and should be used with utmost care.  (See K.I.P.E.  Part II for
detonation chart).

   This explosive is just a copy of a British explosive that was adopted early
in WWII.  This explosive is the choice explosive of the type 'C' compounds
becuase of its relative ease of maufacture and the easy aquisition of the
plastizer compound.  This explosive was available in standard demolition
blocks.

     This explosive was standardized and adopted in the following composition:

R.D.X.......................... 88.3%
Heavy mineral oil.............. 11.1%
Lecithin.......................   .6%

   (All percentages are by wait)

   In this composition, the lecithin acts to prevent the formation of large
crystals of R.D.X.  which would increase the sensitivity of the explosive.
This explosive has a good deal of power and is relatively non-toxic, (except
when ingested).

   It is also plastic from 0-40 degrees celcius.  Above 40 degrees the
explosive undergoes extrudation and becomes gummy although its explosive
properties go realatively unimpaired.  Below 0 degrees celcius it becomes
brittle and its cap sensitivity is lessened considerably.

   Manufacturing this explosive can be done two ways.  First being to dissolve
the 11.7% plastisizing in unleaded gasoline and mixing with the R.D.X.	and
allowing the gasoline to evaporate until the mixture is free of all gasoline.

   The second method being the simple kneading of the plastisizing compound
into the R.D.X.  until a uniform mixture is obtained.

   This explosive should be stored in a cool-dry place.  If properly made the
plastique should be very stable in storage even if stored at elevated
temparatures for long periods of time.

   It should be very cap sensitive.  A booster will be a good choice,
especially if used below 0 degrees celcius.

     This detonates at a velocity of 7900 M/second.
