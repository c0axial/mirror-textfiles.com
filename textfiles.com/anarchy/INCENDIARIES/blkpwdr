      Black powder revolutionized the art and practice of war after
 it was invented by the Chinese over 1000 years ago. It remained
 the basic gun charge right up until World War II and it is still
 used in Black powder rifles, muskets, and cannons, not to
 mention terrorists use it in pipe bombs in the middle east!
