  The best methods of blowing up a car requires getting under the hood.  Explo
sives are placed as near the occupants as possilbe.  NOTE- THIS ARTICLE IS FOR
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT CONTENT TO PSYCH OUT THE DRIVER WITH SOME PRACT ICAL
JOKE.  IF YOU HAVE HIS LAST RIDE IN MIND, THEN READ ON:

  The fuse, homemade, commercial or safety, is wrapped a few turns around the
exhause manifold.  After a few min- utes on the road the exhaust manifold gets
almost red hot and ignites the fuse.

  This way is more certain than wiring the car because since it blows up on the
road the wreck will do the victem in even if the blast doesn't.  Besides, if
the intended victim is a passenger instead of the driver, the driver may start
the engine before the passenger gets into the car...  You can see how
embarrassing that would be to the bomber, can't you?

  Old-fashioned types, like the Mafia, love to wire cars.  They are too set in
thier ways to change and besides, they get a charge out of seeing a car blow up
before thier eyes instead of imagining it going to hell on the road.

  They usually use about three sticks of dynamite, two lengths of electric wire
with two alligator clips for quick attachment, and an electric blasting cap.
The cap is stuck into a dynamite stick and its two wires are connected to the
two electric wires.  Then one alligator clip is clamped to the input side of
the coil and the other is fastened to any metal surface in the car's frame as a
ground.

  This is very simple and you'd think anyone could do it.  But sure enough,
there are always morons who will attach one clamp to a spark plug and one to a
ground.  This usually results in mis fires and no end of frustrations.
