         Chapter One: THEFT
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

           Theft is one of the  most common forms of Anarchy,  almost
         everyone  duz it at one point in their lives...Even the Pope
         probably stole dime-store  candies when he  was a  kid...Not
         everyone, however, will  perform this maneuver  to the  same
         extent or with the same  rate of success. The CARELESS  ones
         get eliminated  by the  forces of  good. Regardless  of  the
         motive, the objective is alwayz the same...To acquire at  no
         cost and with minimal effort, items which are not originally
         or rightfully yours...There  are two  sub-classes of  theft.
         These are single party theft and multiple party theft ( with
         accomplish ).....Regardless of the type of theft, there  are
         three important elements  to consider: Planning,  Execution,
         and ESCAPE. The latter is probably the hardest part and must
         be planned  carefully.  A  plan is  alwayz  required  for  a
         successful theft  and should  offer  a high  probability  of
         success with as little risk as possible.



         Part A: Single party theft
         --------------------------

         It is a good idea to make a surveillance sweep of the target
         area beforehand in order to decide on the best route to  the
         desired item and a quick escape route. Alwayz have at  least
         one alternative escape route in case of unexpected interven-
         tion by  cops  or  onlookers which  render  your  first  one
         impassible. Once you have entered  the target area, time  is
         of the  utmost importance...Get  in and  out as  quickly  as
         possible...Be discrete and do not attract attention.  Alwayz
         make a quick scan for mirrors or cameras, try to stay out of
         direct sight  of others.  Sometimes, the  easiest things  to
         take are items which  are kept right in  front of the  cash-
         ier..all it takes is for him to turn his back for one second
         and before you know it...FREE JUNK FOOD! Be alert, if  there
         are other people present, do not go directly to the  desired
         item. Browse a  little, but take  the first reasonably  safe
         opportunity to  make yer  way over  to it.  Pocket the  item
         quickly without looking at  it or fumbling  with it. DO  NOT
         rush out of the  area immediately if you  don't have to,  be
         casual and maybe even make a purchase. If you are confronted
         however, GET  THE FUCK  OUT Take  the quickest  one of  your
         escape routes that you can, if you are perused then you must
         leave a  difficult trail  to  follow. Dodge  on and  out  of
         buildings or cars, backtrack, hop fences or do what ever you
         have to do to lose them. If possible, motorized transport is
         a good idea...( cover the license plate ) If not, then  work
         with what  you have,  create obstacles  as you  go, such  as
         throwing objects at your persuers or knocking things down in
         your wake. Sometimes, a good cop chase can really give you a
         good feeling...It sure satisfies the Rambo in me! If you are
         forced to deviate from your plan due to unexpected interfer-
         ence, follow  your instincts...........but  remember that  a
         true Anarchist duzn't get caught  at the scene! If it  seems
         inevitable that you  will be caught,  stash the goods  some-
         where safe  until you  can collect  it. After  you have  bin
         caught then it's all over..unless,  you lie like a bitch  or
         your captor turns out to be  a friend of the family. If  you
         escape, then you have  successfully completed your  mission.
         Hopefully you will have the phoresight not to hit a store in
         your neighborhood or one that  you go to regularly. Try  not
         to hit the same place every time....that's dangerous! For an
         added challenge, you may want  to try to swipe items  stored
         behind the cashier's counter. There are wayz to do this such
         as the classic "Can I use  yer phone? I'm stranded and  need
         to call home" Heh, if they let you then your only problem is
         how to  distract their  attention. For  this reason,  it  is
         often easier to execute  a successful theft  if you have  an
         accomplish...


         Part B: Multiple party theft
         ----------------------------


           In a multiple  party theft,  the basics are  the same  but
         certain adjustments must be made to yer plan. First you must
         decide who will  do what....One person  has to distract  the
         attention of onlookers while  the other performs the  actual
         crime. You should  have included  a signal in  your plan  so
         that the you can discretely inform  yer buddie that you have
         the goods and it's  time to leave. A  third person may  have
         been posted as a look-out and if so, must also be kept aware
         of what's goin' on. One of  the important tricks is to  make
         it look like you don't know any of yer  accomplishes...don't
         walk in together or leave  together, unless you get  burned.
         If you are confronted, then  it is not alwayz necessary  for
         all the members of yer team to flee if you have successfully
         convinced the teller you are not together. The guy with  the
         goods has to split BUT while the Cashier is chasing him,  or
         callin the cops, what better opportunity will the other  two
         have to fill their pockets? If it becomes necessary for  all
         parties to run, at least you  now have an added benifit  due
         to the fact that if you  split up, it's harder to catch  all
         of you. It is an unwritten  rule that a guy who gets  caught
         can't squeal on the others if there is a chance they can get
         away with it. You should  have a specified rendezvous  point
         and time if you  split up so all  the parties ( minus  those
         who were bagged ) can meet and decide on appropriate actions
         to take to insure no  further problems will arrise. After  a
         few hits with the  same people, you  should have a  kick-ass
         team and will  be able  tackle anything!  One thing  though,
         alwayz watch your back `cuz as Stalin said.."You can't trust
         anyone, not even yourself."


         Part C: Other forms of theft
         ----------------------------

             Well, if yer not into stealin' from convenience  stores,
         there are many available  sources of "low-cost" items,  such
         as cars, houses, purses & wallets and my personal favourite-
         ...school lockers! Cars  are easy...just get  a 1.5 ft  long
         piece of flexible but sturdy  wire (coathanger will do)  and
         bend a loop at  the end to fit  over the lock button.  Slide
         the wire through the gap  between the window and the  middle
         section of the car (not the  top of the window)... Now  loop
         the end around the lock button and pull. For newer cars that
         do not have the lockbutton but have the switch by the  lever
         on the inside door pannel, you need more equipment. You will
         need a flashlight,  a mirror  and a  coathanger. Before  you
         begin, look  through the  opposite window  at the  door  yer
         gonna open and memorize where evrything is positionned. Now,
         tape the  mirror to  the  outside of  that window  with  the
         reflective surface facing into the car. If you have a friend
         helping you, you  don't need  the mirror as  yer friend  can
         stand on the opposite side of  the car and see through  that
         window where you have to move Now slip the coathanger in  as
         above and use the window to bend  it as you insert it so  it
         touches the inside of the  door....using the mirror or  your
         friend to guide yer movements, unlock the door and there you
         go! If you are in a hurry or don't need to worry about noise
         or anything, just throw a brick through the window. Remember
         to search the dashboard,  glove compartment and back  window
         ledge. If you have a  lock pick set and  can use it, go  for
         the trunk to! I'll deal with  locks and picks in a  separate
         issue dealing specifically with  the tools and their  usage.
         Motorcycles are a sinch to swipe. All you need are a pair of
         vice-grips, a screwdriver  and a dime.  Jam the  screwdriver
         into the ignition, clamp the vice-grips to the shaft of  the
         screwdriver and  twist.....  -=SNAP!=- Now  just  press  the
         start button and away you go!  When you've had yer phun  and
         ya wanna ditch  the bike,  drop the dime  into the  ignition
         keyhole and give it a quarter turn to turn off the engine.



            Now, the most risky but often most profitable source is a
         house. Before you even approach the house, fone to make sure
         they're not in. If you don't have their number or they are a
         bunch of rug-pilots who  don't have a  fone, ring the  door-
         bell.....once you have  established the fact  that they  are
         not home, you can decide on  your method of entry. To  break
         into a  house,  Your two  sources  of entry  are  doors  and
         windows. Before I start  describing methods to bypass  locks
         and bolts, remember that  if you think  there is a  security
         system on the  house FORGET  IT and move  on...why risk  it?
         Anywayz, there are many types of door locks and for most you
         will need a lock pick set  which will be dealt with in  vol.
         II. If you have a  lot of time and  are in a deserted  area,
         you can use various power tools to destroy the door  itself.
         Windows are the  harder to  reach but  more simply  bypassed
         entry routes.  There  is  either  a  deadbolt  or  a  simple
         twist/pull lock for both, you just blow a hole in the window
         just above the lock (with a bee-bee gun) or bar and use wire
         or a thin screwdriver  to knock the bar  out or release  the
         lock. Apartment buildings are  also a good target...just  go
         into the front doors and press every intercom button on  the
         pannel. Some deluded  idiot will  let you in.  If not,  wait
         `till a resident comes in and pretend to be fumbling for the
         door key..he will  of course,  open the  door for  you...Heh
         Once you get  in, make sure  no one is  home....then grab  a
         pillow case or a garbage bag and take evrything that is even
         remotely valuable! Once  you have  done that,  cut the  fone
         line and GET THE PHUCK OUT !!! Mission Accomplished....


          NOTE:
          -----
           HITTING HOUSES  IN YOUR  OWN  NEIGHBORHOOD MAY  RESULT  IN
           APREHENSION AND CAN COMPLICATE PREGNANCY....


             LOCKERS!!!! YEAH!! The easiest way to get money or goods
         for nothing. One way is to  write down the serial # and  the
         combination of the lock your  using this year and then  next
         year, find it and voila! In the mean time, you have to  find
         alternate methods to  keep you  busy for a  whole year,  but
         look...there are hundreds  of lockers!  With little  peckers
         you can stand behind  them and simply  watch them enter  the
         combination. If you  want to  hit a locker  belonging to  an
         older student, you have to be covert about it. You might  as
         well start close to home by easily breaking into the lockers
         on either side of yours. This method is simple but  requires
         time and  you will  need a  hex-driver. Look  at the  inside
         pannel of yer locker that forms the wall separating it  from
         the ajacent one. If the heads of the bolts are on your side,
         you will have no problems. Just unscrew the bolts and remove
         the pannel....hmmm...now why didn't you tink of that before?
         Well,  now  you  know.  Most  of  the  schools  supply  spin
         combo-locks that are hard to pick so if all else fails,  use
         those heavy duty metal shears to cut through the shank. Once
         yer in, you are on yer own...... Have phun!

           The last  type of  theft  I will  discuss  is the  art  of
         picking pockets.  This method  is  becomming more  and  more
         difficult    with     the     advent     of     self-defense
         lessons...yes!...even little  Grandma  Johnson  could  be  a
         black belt. Basically all  you have to do  is either run  by
         the victim and snatch it (copyIIpc is optional) heh, or wait
         `til they put it down somewhere where you can whisk it away.
         Once you have the purse or wallet, there are many things you
         can do...  Money!  I'm sure  you  can  all find  a  use  for
         that....Credit Cards!  Now we're  talkin! You  can go  crazy
         ordering and  carding  everything  you desire  (not  to  yer
         house)....You may find a spare key in there to, if so,  look
         at the I.D.  in the wallet  to find out  their  address  and
         away you go! Geez, what a week for the poor sucker eh! First
         his wallet now  his house  and car!!! Heh,  always be  thor-
         ough.....

         NOTE: ALWAYS LEAVE THE SCENE AS YOU FOUND IT SO THE VICTIM
               WILL TAKE LONGER TO NOTICE A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED.
