NAPALM IS IN ITSELF A VERY SIMPLE SUBSTANCE...IT CAN BE USED FOR MANY
THINGS...(I.E.	GETTING BACK AT YOUR NEIGHBOR!!) HERE'S WHAT'CHA NEED:

================
GASOLINE
JOY OR PALMOLIVE (I PREFER JOY)
A COKE CAN WITH A SAWED-OFF TOP
AMMONIA PELLETS
A DRILL
SOME BENDABLE WIRE
A NAIL
=================

FIRST, MAKE A MIXTURE OF 1/2 JOY,AND 1/2 GASOLINE..  TAKE THE COKE CAN, AND
FILL IT HALF FULL WITH THIS WONDERFUL MIXTURE...  IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

	  -^-^-^-^-^-^-^-
	  !		!
	  !		! <-COKE CAN
	  !		!
	  !=============!
	  !=============!
	  !=============! <-MIXTURE
	  !=============!
	  ---------------

NOW, TAKE THE DRILL (OR SOME SHARP OBJECT) AND PUT A HOLE THROUGH THE AMM- ONIA
PELLET BIG ENOUGH FOR THE NAIL..  PUT THE NAIL THROUGH THE PELLET (WHICH I
MIGHT ADD CAN BE PICKED UP AT ANY FARM SUPPLY STORE) AND WIRE THAT TO THE TOP
OF THE CAN SO THE NAIL CAN BE SLIP- PED OUT EASILY, ALLOWING THE PELLET TO
DROP...WARNING:DO NOT LET THAT PELLET FALL INTO THE MIXTURE, AS YOUR WIFE WILL
SOON BECOME A WIDOW
