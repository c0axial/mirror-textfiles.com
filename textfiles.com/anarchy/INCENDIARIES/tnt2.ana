Probably the most important explosive compond in use today is TNT
(trinitrotoluene). This and other very similar types of high explosives are
all used by the military, because of their fantastic power- about 2.25
millions pounds per square inch, and there great stability.  TNT also has
the great advantage of being ableto be melted at 82 degrees F., so that it
can be poured into shells, mortars, or any other projectiles. Military TNT
comes in containers which resemble dryu cell batteries, and are usually 
ingnited by an electrical charge, coupled with an electical blasting cap,
although there are other methods.
 
Preparation of TNT
 
1. Take two beakers.  In the first prepare a solution of 76 percent sulfuric
acid, 23 percent nitric acid and 1 percent water.  In the other beaker,
prepare another solution of 57 percent nitric acid and 43 percent sulfuric
acid (percentages are on a weight ratio rather than volume).
 
2. Ten grams of the first solutions are poured into an empty beaker and
placed in an ice bath.
 
3. Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.
 
4. remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until it reaches
 50 degrees C. The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.
 
5. Fifty additional grams of the acid, from the first beaker, are added and
the temperature is held for the next ten minutes, and an oily liquid will
begin to form on the top of the acid.
 
6. After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath,
and cooled to 45 begrees C> when reaching this temperature, the oily liquid
will sink and collect at the bottom of the beaker.  At this point, the
remaining acid solution should be drawn off, by using a syringe.
 
7. Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid
while the temperature is SLOWLY being raised to 83 degrees C.  After this
temperature is reached, it is maintaind for a full half hour.
 
8. At the end of this period, he solution is allowed to cool to
60 degrees C>, and is held at this temperature  for another full half hour.
After this, the acid is again drawn off, leaving once more only the oily
liquid at the bottem.
 
9. Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently
heated to 80 degrees C.  All temperature increases must be accoumplished
slowly and gently.
 
10.Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second acid
solution are added, and the temperature is raised from 80 degrees C>
to 104 degrees C., and is held for three hours.
 
11.After this three hour period, the mixture is lowered to 100 degrees C.
and held there for a half hour.
 
12.After this half hour, the oil is removed form the acid and washed with
 boiling water.
 
13.After the washing with boiling water, while being stired constantly, the
TNT will begin to solidify.
 
14.When the solidification has started, cold water is added to the beaker,
so that the TNT will form into pellets.  Once this is done, you have a
good quality TNT.
 
NOTE: the temperatures used in the preparation of TNT are EXACT,
and must be used as such.  DO NOT estimate or use aproximations.
Buy a good centigrade thermometer and be sure it is calibrated.
This mixture is not forgiving to screw-ups!
