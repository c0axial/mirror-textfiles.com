Sodium, the pure element. Obtained from a chem lab or supply.

Gelatine capsule, medicinal vehicle. Obtained from better pharmacies and health food stores.

Fill cap with sodium. Drop in gas tank. Cap disintegrates. Sodium sparks in contact with the water that has collected at the bottom of *everyone’s* gas tank. Gas ignites. Car goes boom. Much easier and cleaner than Drano/Lysol combustion.

Use a few sodium capsules for assured explosion.
