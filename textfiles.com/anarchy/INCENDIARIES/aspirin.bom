                 !!!!!!!!        W A R N I N G      !!!!!!!!
 
 
               1ST. IT IS A FELONY TO MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES !
               2ND. THIS PROCEDURE IS SIMPLE BUT DANGEROUS !
               3RD. IF YOU MAKE IT, USE IT ! DO NOT STORE THIS MATERIAL.
 
 
KEEP THIS HARDCOPY IN YOUR SAFE HIDING SPOT WITH YOUR SMG YOU WILL NEED IT
                         WHEN THE "RED DAWN" COMES !

                            PLASTIQUE FROM ASPIRIN
                               (TRINITROPHENOL)
 
 
THIS IS HIGHLY TOXIC, USE RUBBER GLOVES, SHOULD BE DONE WHERE THERE IS
                            PLENTY OF VENTILATION.
   USE GLASS CONTAINERS FOR MIXING, STORING, ETC. THIS COMPOUND REACTS WITH
    METAL AND CREATE SALTS THAT ARE VERY SENSITIVE PRIMARY EXPLOSIVES THAT
     COULD TEND TO PUT A DAMPER ON YOUR WEEKEND (AS WELL AS YOUR LIFE !).
   THIS PROCEDURE DOES WORK, AND SHOULD TAKE ABOUT THREE HOURS TO COMPLETE.
    THE EXPLOSIVE CHARACTERISTICS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS C4 BUT EASY TO MAKE.
             ITS DET. VEL. IS APROX. 7000 M/SEC, HIGHER THAN TNT.
                     A NUMBER 6 CAP USUALLY WILL DO O.K.
 
 
                                  EQUIPMENT ;
                              1 BEAKER  , 600 ML
                                  PYREX DISH
                              PYREX BOWL (LARGE)
                               ELECTRIC FRY PAN
                              MORTER AND PESTLE
                                COFFEE FILTERS
                          GLASS RODS (FOR STIRRING)
                                RUBBER GLOVES
 
                                "INGREDIENTS";
         ASPIRIN, NOT BUFFERED, CHEAP GENERIC, 1000 IS USUALLY GOOD.
   SULFURIC ACID, 98 % , GAS STATIONS (THEY USE IT FOR CHARGING NEW BATTS.)
                    METHYL ALCOHOL (EASY TO FIND STUFF...)
      SODIUM NITRATE (SALT SUBSTITUTE) OR POTASSIUM NITRATE (SALT PETER)
 (THE POT. NITRATE IS USED FOR PICKLING MEAT AND AS A DIURETIC FOR ANIMALS.)
                    COOKING OIL (FOR BATH TO HEAT CHEMS.)
                                     WAX
                                   VASELINE
                                     ICE
                                    WATER
                               DISTILLED WATER
 
                                  STEP ONE.
                (A) POWDER THE ASPIRIN TO A FINE CONSISTENCY.
        (B) PLACE THIS POWDER IN WARM METHYL ALCOHOL, STIR VIGOROUSLY.
                       (NOT ALL ASPIRIN WILL DISSOLVE.)
    (C) FILTER OUT THE REMAINING POWDER, ADD TO MORE ALCOHOL (NOT AS MUCH
                  THIS TIME.) FILTER AGAIN, COMBINE ALCOHOL.
   (D) ALLOW THE ALCOHOL TO EVAPORATE IN THE SHALLOW DISH. THIS WILL LEAVE
                  ALMOST PURE ACETYSALICYLIC ACID CRYSTALS.
 
 
                       STEP TWO. NOW THE FUN BEGINS....
 
   (A) MAKE A HOT OIL BATH. ELECTRIC FRY PAN, NOT QUITE 3/4 FULL WITH OIL,
    SET THERM. ON 150 DEG. PLACE BEAKER IN BATH ADD ACID TO BEAKER (150ML)
    (B) ADD 40 GRAMS OF ACID CRYSTALS TO 150 ML SULFURIC ACID (ALREADY IN
                BATH). DISSOLVE ALL CRYSTALS. TAKE OUT BEAKER.
 
 
 
                STEP THREE.   I RECOMMEND DOING THIS OUTSIDE !
  (A) SLOWLY (!!!) START ADDING 58 G OF SODIUM NITRATE (OR 77G OF POT. NIT.)
    TO THE BEAKER WHILE STIRRING CONTINUALLY. A RED GAS SHOULD BE FORMED.
    THIS IS NITROGEN TRIOXIDE, IT IS VERY POISONOUS IN VERY SMALL AMOUNTS !
                            STAY AWAY FROM IT !!!
    IF THE MIXTURE FOAMS (AND IT PROBABLY WILL) JUST WAIT FOR THE FOAMING
                                 TO SUBSIDE.
             (B) ALLOW MIXTURE TO COOL TO APROX 30 TO 40 DEG. (C)
        (C) DUMP THIS INTO TWICE ITS VOLUME OF CRUSHED ICE AND WATER.
             (D) FILTES"OUT THE BRIGHT YELLOW CRYSTALS THAT FORM.
 
                           STEP FOUR (ALMOST HOME)
 
  (A) PLACE THE FILTERED YELLOW CRYSTALS IN 200 ML BOILING DISTILLED WATER.
                  LET THE WATER COOL AND FILTER THE CRYSTALS
                  THIS IS NOW VERY VERY PURE TRINITROPHENOL
   (B) REMOVE MOST OF THE OIL FROM THE OIL BATH. PLACE A PYREX DISH IN THE
        BATH ADD ENOUGH OIL TO HEAT THE DISH WITHOUT CONTAMINATING THE
       T.N.P. HEAT THIS TO 80 DEG (C) AND HOLD IT THERE FOR TWO HOURS.
            MAINTAIN THE TEMP WITH A THERMOMETER. REMOVE FROM HEAT
 
                            STEP FIVE (AT LAST !)
  (A) MAKE THE T.N.P. CRYSTALS AND POWDER THEM TO A FACE POWDER CONSISTENCY.
      (B) MIX THE CRYSTALS WITH 10 % WAX AND 5 % VASELINE (% BY WEIGHT)
          (C) KNEAD THIS (RUBBER GLOVES !) TO A UNIFORM CONSISTENCY.
       (D) SHAPE INTO 4 X 4 X 1/5 SLABS. YOU MAY USE AS MUCH OR LITTLE
        AS THE JOB REQUIRES. REMEMBER, T.N.P. IS STRONGER THAN T.N.T.
         (THE MILITARY USED THIS FOR FILLER IN ARTILLERY SHELLS CIRCA
                      1888 (DERIVING IT FROM COAL TAR))
 
                        REMEBBER THIS IS STILL TOXIC.
      ALSO AFTER STORAGE (OR CONTACT WITH METAL) IT WILL FORM DANGEROUS
          PRIMARY EXPLOSIVE SALTS. A SLIGHT BUMP COULD GO BOOOOOOM !
                                SO USE IT !!!
  GOOD LUCK AND I WISH YOU WELL WITH THOSE TREE STUMPS (NEIGHBORS CAT, ETC.)
 
                           THE SURVIVOR WAS HERE !
