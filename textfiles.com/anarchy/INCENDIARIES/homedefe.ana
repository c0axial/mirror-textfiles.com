[-]	    HOME DEFENSE 101	    [-]
[-]		LESSON I	    [-]

  WELL IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY SOME GUY BREAKS INTO SOMEONES HOUSE AND BEATS THE
HECK OUT OF HIM AND TAKES HIS MONEY THIS SERIES OF FILES IS DESIGNED TO STOP ALL
OF THAT STUFF.	THESE FILES WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE HARDWARE TO GET , THE
TACTICS TO USE , AND THE TRAPS TO SET THAT WILL LET YOU DEFEAT THE HOME INVADER.

  THE BASIC PHILOSOPHY OF HOME DEFENSE 101 IS TO CREATE SECURITY .  OUR
PHILOSOPHY TO THE MATTER OF HOME INVASION IS

  LET THE BURGLAR COME IN YOU SHOULD WANT HIM TO ENTER YOUR HOME.

  I KNOW ALL OF YOU ARE SAYING TO YOURSELF "AWW SHIT DAVES GONE OF OFF THE EDGE
AND WANTS TO BE A VIGILANTE " BUT PUT IT THIS WAY IF AN ALGAE SUCKER ENTERS YOUR
HOME AND YOU GET HIM BUSTED OR KILLED ITLL EITHER A) END HIS CAREER AS A
CRIMINAL (RIGHT AWAY) OR MAKE HIM THINK TWICE BEFORE ENTERING A HOUSE.

 BASIC METHODS OF DEFENSE
 ------------------------
  NOW THE STANDARD HUMAN HAS A GUN OR TWO IN HIS HOUSE TO DEFEND HIMSELF MOST OF
THE TIME THE GUNS AREN'T EVEN LOADED .  WELL AT LEAST MY OLD MAN HAS A 357
PYTHON ALWAYS LOADED IN HIS DRAWER IF YOU WANT TO DEFEND YOURSELF NUMBER 1 IS
BUY A GUN WEAPONS WILL BE COVERED IN FILE 2

  THE BASIC HOME DEFENSE TIPS ARE DO THESE TO YOUR HOME:

-A) PROVIDE SOME OUTSIDE LIGHT IF YOU HAVE A BIG YARD OR GARDEN
-B) HAVE SOME ADEQUATE DEADBOLT LOCKS ON YOUR DOORS (IF YOU DO SOME INSURANCE
    COMPANIES DECREASE YOU HOME INSURANCE RATES IF YOU DO SO LOOK INTO THAT )
-C) GET A DOG , ALTHOUGH THEY SHIT, THEY ARE MANS BEST FRIEND AND BARK WHEN
THAT FAVORATE BURGLAR IS ENTERING YOUR HOUSE ,NOTE YOU DONT HAVE TO GET A DOB-
ERMAN THAT RIPS APART TOYOTAS FOR FUN A LITTLE DOG IS JUST AS GOOD JUST ONE
THAT BARKS SO YOU KNOW WHATS GOING ON WHEN SOMEONE ENTERS YOUR HOUSE
-D) BE PREPARED THINK TO YOURSELF BEFORE YOU SET YOUR LITTLE HEAD DOWN TO BED
 "WHAT WOULD I DO IF A BURGLAR/MANIAC ATTEMPTED TO BREAK INTO MY HOUSE
TONIGHT!

  BASIC HOME SECURITY
  -------------------

  BASIC HOME SECURITY IS A MIXTURE OF TRAPS, WEAPONS, AND TACTICS THAT ARE
DESIGNED TO DEFEAT THE SCUM (FROM NOW ON WE WILL USE SCUM AS A TERM FOR A HOME
INVADER) WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO GET UP AND BLOW HIM INTO NEXT TUESDAY

  I- TRAPS

  TRAPS ARE GREAT AS A GAG OR FOR DEFEATING THE HOME INVADER , THEY CAN BE
ANYTHING FROM A BUCKET OF COLD WATER POURING ON SOMEBODY IN WINTER TO A TRIP
CORD THAT ACTIVATES A SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE IN THIS FILE WELL GO OVER THE
SPRINGING DOOR "SURPRISE" TRAP

  SPRINGING DOOR SURPRISE TRAP
  ----------------------------
  INGREDIENTS:

  2 OR 3 PULLEYS
  1 U SHAPED WALL BRACKET
   LOOKS LIKE THIS

     --     --
      !     !
      -------

THEY CAN BE SCREWED INTO WALLS WITH WOOD SCREWS
1 METAL STRIP THAT FITS WALL MOUNT (IT FITS BETWEEN THE EDGES OF THE
  MOUNT AND HANGS BY A CENTRALLY PLACED SCREW)
1 STRONG CORD OR WIRE OR FISH LINE
1 BUCKET FILLED WITH ICE COLD WATER

  OK THIS TRAP WORKS AT MY HOUSE BECAUSE I HAVE STAIRS AFTER ENTERING INTO MY
HOUSE DIRECTIONS PUT WALL MOUNT INTO WALL ABOVE DOOR AND ADD METAL STRIP SO
STRIP IS BETWEEN EDGES OF DOOR MOUNT AND TOP OF DOOR SO WHEN DOOR IS OPENED THE
STRIP MOVES ADD PULLEY SO BUCKET OF ICE COLD WATER IS SUSPENDED ON A PRETTY HIGH
STAIR SO WHEN DOOR IS OPENED THE STRIP WILL MOVE THE WIRE (WHICH IS WRAPPED
AUROUND THE METAL STRIP) WHICH WILL MOVE THE PULLEY S WHICH WILL SEND THE BUCKET
OF ICE COLD WATER INTO THE ENTERERS STOMACH.  (I TELL YOU IF I WAS BREAKING INTO
SOMEONES HOUSE AND A BUCKET OF ICE COLD GOT ME IT WOULD BOTHER ME SOMEWHAT).

[+]	       PART II		    [+]

  OK , THE PRIMARY WEAPON IN ANY HOME DEFENDERS ARESENAL SHOULD BE A HANDGUN AT
LEAST ( I PREFER THE SUBMACHINE GUNS AND ASSAULT RIFLES, BUT THATS JUST ME) OH
YEAH ALMOST FORGOT ANY GUN ENTHUSIAST OR HOME DEFENDER SHOULD BE A MEMBER OF THE
NRA AND HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE AMERICAIN RIFLEMAN SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE 15 BUCKS
(I THINK)

  THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION
  1600 RHODE ISLAND AVENUE
  N.W.,WASHINGTON D.C.
  20036

  NOW I MEAN THIS MAGAZINE IS GREAT AND IM GOD DURN GLAD I SUBSCRIBE TO IT.  IT
KEEPS YA INFORMED OF ALL OF THE NEW GUNS , SIGHTS AND STUFF, ALSO SOLDIGER OF
FOURUNE AND EAGLE ARE GREAT MAGAZINES ALSO.  BELOW ARE 2 EXCERPTS FROM "THE
ARMED CITIZEN " , A MONTHLY ARTICLE IN THE AMERICAIN RIFLEMAN .  (THESE ARE FOR
ALL OF YOU IDIOTS THAT THINK GUNS ARE HARMFUL AND SHOULD BE BANNED).

  WHEN A MAN ARMED WITH A PISTOL ENTERED AN ALBUQUERQUE, N.  MEX.  MOTEL OFFICE
AND ASKED FOR CASH , OWNER , DENNIS BRANDY OPENED THE CASH REGISTER AND PUT THE
MONEY ON THE COUNTER.THE ROBBER THE DEMANDED CASH FROM THE SAFE, AND AS BRANDY
WALKED INTO A SMALL OFFICE TO GET IT HE OPENED UP A SMALL FILE CABINET, PULLED
OUT A .44 CALIBER REVOLVER, AND SHOT THE GUNMAN TO DEATH.  ( NOW IN THAT
CIRCUMSTANCE , IN MY OPINION , THE ROBBER KILLED HIMSELF , HE DID THAT BY
ATTEMPTING TO ROB THE PERSON AND BY DRAWING A GUN ON THE OWNER , HE LEFT THE
OWNER WITH NO OPTION EXCEPT TO KILL THE GUNMAN , THAT IS WHAT WE CALL PROBABLE
CAUSE <-- REMEMBER THOSE TWO WORDS KIDDIES WE WILL USE THEM LATER )

  A MAN CARRYING A PISTOL BROKE INTO JAES MULLINS' CHICAGO , ILL.  HOME AND
THREATENED TO SHOOT HIM AND HIS WIFE IN THEIR BED AS HE ROBBED THEM .  THE
GUNMAN THEN FORCED MULLINS' WIFE DOWNSTAIRS WHERE HE BEGAN SLAPPING HER, MULLINS
GRABBED HIS 16 GAUGE SHOTGUN, WAITEDS FOR HIS WIFE TO BREAK FREE , THEN FIRED,
KILLING HER ASSAILANT (WELL IN THAT CASE LOOKED LIKE THE OLD GOD OF PROBABLE
CAUSE STRIKES AGAIN) (BOTH ARITCLES TAKEN FROM THE AMERICAIN RIFLEMAN , JUNE
1980 , VOL 128 , ISSUE 6).

  HANGUNS
  -------
OK THE HANDGUN IS A GOOD WEAPON BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE , STOPPING POWER , AND
PORTABILITY.

THE HANDGUNS THAT I SUGGEST IN USE FOR HOME DEFENSE ARE :

  THE COLT M1911A .45 AUTOMATIC - GREAT GUN CARRIES ALOT OF STOPPING POWER ,
CARRIES 7 ROUND MAGAZINES , PLUS ONE IN THE BELLY (FOR ALL OF YOU PEOPLE
NON-PROFICIENT IN FIREARMS, THIS MEANS ONE EXTRA BULLET CAN BE CARRIED IN THE
FIRING CHAMBER WHILE THE MAGAZINE REMAINS FULL) COMES IN 2 COLORS , MIDNIGHT
BLUE AND BLACK , I THINK SILVER TOO BUT IM NOT REALLY SURE

  THE WALTHER PPK - BRITISH GUN FIRES A 7.65 MM SHELL WHICH IS A NICE CALIBER
FOR A PISTOL , USUALLY YOU FIND THAT CALIBER IN A RUSSIAN AKM ASSAULT PISTOL ,
THIS BRITISH BOMBER CARRIES 7 SLUGS AND ITS A PRETTY SMALL PISTOL SO THE ONLY
TIME IT CAN BE SEEN IS WHEN YOU WANT IT SEEN , PERFECT GUN FOR A THROUGH THE
TRENCHCOAT SHOT.

  COLT PYTHON - GREAT GUN FIRES A .357 MAGNUM CARTRIGE SO YOU KNOW THIS IS A 1
SHOT PISTOL, ITS A REVOLVER , CARRIES 6 SHOTS GREAT FOR TAKING OUT THAT FAVORITE
ENGINE BLOCK OF YOUR ENIMIES CAR , REALLY A SHARP GUN , I SHOULD KNOW , MY OLD
MAN HAS ONE .

  COLT COBRA .38 - COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE .38 SNUBNOSE THIS BABY CARRIES A .38
SHELL AND ITS 2 INCH BARREL MEANS ONCE AGAIN THAT THIS BABY IS ONLY SEEN WHEN
YOU WANT IT TO BE SEEN , CARRIES 6 SHOTS REALLY A GOOD DECEPTIVE GUN.

  BROWNING HIGH POWER- REALLY AN EXCEPTIONAL PIECE CARRIES 16 9MM SLUGS IN ITS
MAGAZINE GOOD POWER AND HANDLES RECOIL EXCEPTIONALLY WELL.

  THE DAN WESSON MODEL 29 ,.44 MAGNUM- YUP HER IT IS THE GUN USED BY DIRTY HARRY
THE .44 THE MOST POWERFUL HANDGUN CARTRIGE IN THE WORLD AND COULD BLOW YOUR HEAD
CLEAN OFF SO YOUVE GOT TO ASK YOURSELF ONE QUESTION...	(GOT CARRIED AWAY) THIS
BABY IS SECOND PLACE IN MY PICK FOR THE BEST HOME DEFENSE HANDGUN THIS IS ONE OF
THE BEST "1 SHOT" PISTOLS THERE ARE 6 SHOT AND AN 8 1/4 INCH BARREL THIS GUN IS
PURE DYNAMITE.

  THE AUTOMAG- THIS IS THE BEST HANDGU IN THE NON-PROFICIENT IN FIREARMS, THI
CARTRIGE THAT HAS TO BE MODIFIED CARRIES 7 STEEL PIECES OF DEATH IN ITS MAGAZINE
, THIS IS THE GUN YOU USE IF YOU WANT NO SURVIVORS A PERFECT 10 HANDGUN IF I
EVER SAW IT THE PURE SIGHT OF THIS GUN SHOULD SENT MOST INTELLIGENT PEOPLE INTO
RUNNING AND SHITTING IN THEIR PANTS SIMULTANEOUSLY , THIS GUN IS #1 FOR HOME
DEFENSE.

  THE ASSAULT RIFLES AND SUB-MACHINEGUNS
  --------------------------------------
NOW THESE ARE THE WEAPONS MADE FOR HOME DEFENSE THESE WEAPONS ARE PERFECT DUE TO
THE FACT THAT ONE OF THESE (CONVERTED MIND YOU) ARE USED THE DEFENDER DOESNT
NEED ANY TALENT IN SHOOTING A SM(WELL USE SM AS AN ABBRIEVIATION FOR SUB
MACHINEGUN FROM NOW ON) BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE ABLE TO SLING 3 ROUNDS PER SECOND
AT SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TALENT IN SHOOTING ILL G PHILE A FEW FULL AUTO CONVERSIONS
IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS SOON AS I GET THEM IN.

  THE UZI- THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS SMS I REALLY DONT LIKE THIS GUN
I FEEL THE MAC 10 AND 11 ARE BETTER THE UZI STILL IS A PRETTY GOOD WEAPON, THE
UZI WAS INVENTED IN 1950 IN ISRAELTHIS GUN CAN HOLD 32 9MM PARABELLUM SHELLS ,
IT WORKS ON THE BLOWBACK PRICIPLE THIS PRINCIPLE IS THAT THE SHOT FIRED MOVES
THE NEXT SHELL INTO THE FIRING CHAMBER , THIS ALLOWS FOR A FAST FIRING RATE AND
ALLOWS FOR A SMALL JAMMING CHANCE.

  THE INGRAM MAC 10 - THIS I FEEL IS THEBEST SUB MACHINE GUN MADE , IT HOLDS 30
45 CALIBRE SHELLS , THE .45 HITS WITH MORE DAMAGE ON IMPACT THAT IS WHY I FEEL
IT IS SUPERIOR TO THE UZI , THE INGRAM MACS ARE ALSO EASILY FITTED WITH
SILENCERS AND FLASH SUPPRESSORS THESE MECANISMS DONT DISTRUB THE WEIGHTING OF
THE GUN AS MUCH AS THEY DO ON OTHER SMS THE MAC 11 IS MUCH LIKE THE MAC 10
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT FORES 9MM PARABELLUM AMMO SO I SAY GOT FOR THE MAC
10 YOULL BE GLAD YOU DID.

  THE AR-15 - THE AR -15 IS THE COMMERCIAL VERSION OF THE M-16 THE ONLY
DIFFERANCE IS THE AR-15 IS SEMI AUTOMATIC AND THE M16 IS FULL AUTO WITH A LITTLE
CONVERSION THE AR-15 CAN BE MADE FULL AUTO A M-16 TECHNICALLY , THE AR-15 FIRES
A 5.56MM SHELL WHICH IS .223 CALIBRE NOW YOU MAY BE SAYING THAT IS BARELY MORE
THAN A .22 SHELL WHY IS THE M-16 THE STANDARD ARM OF OUR ARMED FORCES , THE FACT
IS THAT THE 5.56 MM SHELL THE MILITARY USES HAS MANY MORE GRAINS FER CARTRIGE
THAN .22 SHELLS.

  SO WHEN LOOKING FOR A GUN FOR HOME DEFENSE REMEMBER TO LOOK FOR:

 1) POWER
 2) CONCEALABILITY
 3) AMMO CAPACITY
 4) RELIABILITY
