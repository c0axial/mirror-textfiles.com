Exploding Target.


Patented 12 February 1985, US patent number 4,498,677. The patents
abstract is as follows: An explosive target for firearm marksmanship
has a hollow rectangular block-shaped body assembly including an
internal bore containing an explosive charge which detonates upon
projectile impact. A charge retaining disc forcibly inserted within the
bore retains the charge adjacent the rear wall of the body assembly. A
target imprinted on the front wall of the body assembly is coaxially
aligned with the bore.

The patent provides that: "Any suitable stable explosive compound which
will detonate upon projectile impact may be used in practicing the
invention and there are many well-known commercially available
explosive compositions which should be suitable for this purpose.
However, I have found the following formula to be most satisfactory.

Potassium chlorate                       18       Parts by weight
Sulphur                                   6             do
black fine powdered aluminum (400 mesh)   6             do
Bran                                      2-2.5         do

The aforementioned dry ingredients which include discrete loosely
associated granular components are preferably mixed in dry form to
produce the explosive charge."

This 60/20/20 - 3/1/1 combination of Chlorate/Sulphur/Aluminum is
similar to formula in Shimizu's Fireworks, Thunder #3  (43/26/31), and
Tenny Davis (2/1/1) page 117.  Perhaps the increased percentage of the
chlorate is to make the mixture more sensitive.

It should be noted that the actual device may differ greatly from the
device described in its associated patent as the patent filing date is
22 March 1983, and changes/improvements may have been made since then.

The patents cites five other patents as references, they are as
follows:

727,419. 1903. Flying target. A round target comprising three discs,
the inner disc one being a "fulminate" one. "By the term 'fulminate' I
do not mean only an explosive or detonating substance, since material
which when hit or pierced will smoke, ignite, or burn more or less
slowly may be included by such term." There are no suggestions in the
patent as to what these substance may be composed of.

1,091,116. 1914. Impact illuminated target for pleasure shooting. "My
invention consists in a target having its impact-surface treated with a
flash-light composition igniting on the impact of the bullet to produce
a circumscribed illumination of the target about the point of impact of
the bullet upon its surface." "As an example of such a preparation, I
may instance a composition of chlorate of potash, magnesium and
collodin applied with an ordinary brush."

1,145,585. 1915. Target. Small animal figure &c. covered with a "paint
having therein a small proportion of explosive material, such for
instance as well-known match-making chemicals, with a component of
explosive chlorates or the like incorporated therein." The following
compositions are suggested:

Yellow flashing

Red phosphorus            3  Parts.
Potassium nitrate         2    do
Antimony sulfid (sic)     1    do
Glue (5% solution)        1    do

Red flashing

Red phosphorus            3  Parts
Strontium nitrate         1 1/2
Lithium carbonate         1
Antimony sulfid           1
Glue (5% solution)        1

Green flashing

Red phosphorus            3  Parts
Barium nitrate            3
Antimony sulfid           1
Glue (5% solution)        1

If you are thinking of reproducing any of the above composition, make
me a beneficiary of your life insurance policy first, I could use the
money!

4,243,228. 1981. Remotely-perceptible impact-indicating projectile
target. There are no pyrotechnics involved in this patent.

These targets are advertised in the Shotgun news, $26.50 per 40 targets
post paid, form Proven Products, POB 731, Higganum, CT. 06441. The add
also states that they are "Legal and safe for public use." Lots-of-luck
trying to convince the local PD your not shooting off fireworks
