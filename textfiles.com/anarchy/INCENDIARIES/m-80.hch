How to Make M-80's:
        This file deals with how to make M-80's or similar type small 
        explosive charges that make LOUD noises.
 
        The hardest part with making M-80's is the powder.  The kind of powder that 
        you want is the silver type used in firecrackers.  It is made of 
        Potassium Perchlorate KClO , Aluminium & Sulfur. You can take apart 
        firecrackers...or, you can make it out of the above ingredients.  Get 
        each of these in as fine of powder as you can.  Obtain a postage or 
        any small scale and mix them BY WEIGHT in the following ratios.
 
        1 pt.  - Powdered sulfur
        1 pt.  - Powdered Aluminium
        2 pts. - Potassium Perchlorate KCIO
 
Do not use potassium chlorate, it will explode violently when mixed with 
sulfur.

Stir the powder well with a piece of wood in a plastic bowl.
 
        Next, you will need something to contain the powder in. Get some thick 
        cardboard tubing with a diameter of « to 3/4" You can find tubing 
        anywhere. I have found a gold mine where I work, I just grab the 
        Cardboard tubes register receipt tape is wrapped around.  The thicker 
        the sides of the tube are, the better.  The actual M-80 I have. 
        (Not Home Made) is 1 «" long and has a diameter of «".
 
        Third, you will need fuse, where I live, a sporting goods store sells 
        it under the name to cannon fuse for 15 cents a foot, but it really 
        should be waterproof fuse.  You can pull it out of any number of 
        fireworks.
 
        If you have gotten all that, now you need end-plugs.  I personally 
        use one of those hot melt glue guns.  Works great.  You can use 
        Elmer's Glue-All but it takes a long time to dry.  Or, you can get a 
        piece of wood dowel that  telescopes into your tube, cut ¬" thick discs 
        and smear Elmer's on them.
 
To Assemble:
        Put in one endplug, with whatever method you are using, let it dry, 
        harden or whatever it has to do. Drill your fuse hole in the center of 
        the tube.  Put in the fuse and pour the powder in.  Put in the other 
        endplug. Glue or whatever and Viola, a M-80.  Don't worry about pouring 
        hot glue on the powder mixture, it won't ignite.
 
        I have never had a homemade M-80 I wasn't proud of. The powder mixture 
        detailed above has some astonishing capability.  Use the above well, and 
        try not to hurt yourself (or anyone else.)  Unless you hate them that 
        is...
