
			      HOW TO MAKE TNT
			  THE ANARCHIST COOKBOOK
     
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND IN USE TODAY IS TNT 
(TRINITROTOLENE).  THIS AND OTHER VERY SIMILAR TYPES OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES ARE ALL
USED BY THE MILITARY, BECAUSE OF THEIR FANTASTIC POWER - ABOUT 2.25 MILLION 
POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH, AND THEIR GREAT STABILITY.  TNT ALSO HAS THE GREAT 
ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO BE MELTED AT 82 DEGREES F., SO THAT IT CAN  BE 
POURED INTO SHELLS, MORTARS, OR ANY OTHER PROJECTILES.	MILITARY TNT COMES 
IN CONTAINERS WHICH RESEMBLE DRY CELL BATTERIES, AND ARE USUALLY IGNITED BY AN 
ELECTRICAL CHARGE, COUPLED WITH AN ELECTRICAL BLASTING CAP, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 
OTHER METHODS.

PREPARATION OF TNT
1. TAKE TWO BEAKERS. IN THE FIRST, PREPARE A SOLUTION OF 76% SULFURIC ACID, 23%
   NITRIC ACID, AND 1% WATER. IN THE OTHER BEAKER, PREPARE ANOTHER SOLUTION OF 
   57% NITRIC ACID AND 43% SULFURIC ACID (%'S ARE ON A WEIGHT RATIO RATHER THAN
   VOLUME).

2. TEN GRAMS OF THE FIRST SOLUTION ARE POURED INTO AN EMPTY BEAKER AND PLACED 
   IN AN ICE BATH.

3. ADD TEN GRAMS OF TOLUENE, AND STIR FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.

4. REMOVE THIS BEAKER FROM THE ICE BATH AND GENTLY HEAT UNTIL IT REACHES 50   
   DEGREES C. THE SOLUTION IS STIRRED CONSTANTLY WHILE BEING HEATED.

5. FIFTY ADDITIONAL GRAMS OF THE ACID, FROM THE FIRST BEAKER, ARE ADDED AND THE
   TEMPERATURE IS ALLOWED TO RISE TO 55 DEGREES C. THIS TEMPERATURE IS HELD FOR
   THE NEXT TEN MINUTES, AND AN OILY LIQUID WILL BEGIN TO FORM ON THE TOP OF 
   THE ACID.

6. AFTER 10 OR 12 MINUTES, THE ACID SOLUTION IS RETURNED TO THE ICE BATH, AND 
   COOLED TO 45 DEGREES C. WHEN REACHING THIS TEMPERATURE, THE OILY LIQUID WILL
   SINK AND COLLECT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BEAKER. AT THIS POINT, THE REMAINING 
   ACID SOLUTION SHOULD BE DRAWN OFF, BY USING A SYRINGE.

7. FIFTY MORE GRAMS OF THE FIRST ACID SOLUTION ARE ADDED TO THE OILY LIQUID    
   WHILE THE TEMPERATURE IS SLOWLY BEING RAISED TO 83 DEGREES C. AFTER THIS 
   TEMPERATURE IS REACHED, IT IS MAINTAINED FOR A FULL HALF HOUR.

8. AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD, THE SOLUTION IS ALLOWED TO COOL TO 60 DEGREES C.
   , AND IS HELD AT THIS TEMPERATURE FOR ANOTHER FULL HALF HOUR. AFTER THIS, 
   THE ACID IS AGAIN DRAWN OFF, LEAVING ONCE MORE ONLY THE OILY LIQUID AT THE 
   BOTTOM.

9. THIRTY GRAMS OF SULFURIC ACID ARE ADDED, WHILE THE OILY LIQUID IS GENTLY    
   HEATED TO 80 DEGREES C. ALL TEMPERATURE INCREASES MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED 
   SLOWLY AND GENTLY.

10. ONCE THE DESIRED TEMPERATURE IS REACHED, 30 GRAMS OF THE SECOND ACID       
    SOLUTION ARE ADDED, AND THE TEMPERATURE IS RAISED FROM 80 DEGREES C. TO 104
    DEGREES C. , AND IS HELD FOR THREE HOURS.

11. AFTER THIS THREE-HOUR PERIOD, THE MIXTURE IS LOWERED TO 100 DEGREES C. AND
    IS HELD THERE FOR A HALF HOUR.

12. AFTER THIS HALF HOUR, THE OIL IS REMOVED FROM THE ACID AND WASHED WITH     
    BOILING WATER.

13. AFTER THE WASHING WITH BOILING WATER, WHILE BEING STIRRED CONSTANTLY, THE 
    TNT WILL BEGIN TO SOLIDIFY.

14. WHEN THE SOLIDIFICATION HAS STARTED, COLD WATER IS ADDED TO THE BEAKER, SO 
THAT THE TNT WILL FORM INTO PELLETS. ONCE THIS IS DONE, YOU HAVE A GOOD QUALITY
TNT.
     
NOTE: THE TEMPERATURES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF TNT ARE EXACT, AND MUST BE   
      USED AS SUCH.  DO NOT ESTIMATE OR USE APPROXIMATIONS.  BUY A GOOD 
      CENTIGRADE THERMOMETER.
