     THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY TECHNICAL MANUAL
"IMPROVISED MUNITIONS HANDBOOK".  THE BOOK ORIGINALLY CAME WITH PICTURES,
BUT I WILL JUST TYPE UP THE STEPS, SO YOU'LL HAVE TO IMPROVISE ON WHAT IT
WILL LOOK LIKE (AS IF IT REALLY MATTERED).  I DON'T SUGGEST DOING THEM,
(DISCLAIMER, EH?) BUT I'M TELLING YOU HOW TO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW.  HAVE
PHUN.

PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER 
------------------------ 
     A PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER CAN BE MADE FROM POTASSIUM CHLORATE AND
PETROLEUM JELLY.  THIS EXPLOSIVE CAN BE DETONATED WITH COMMERCIAL #8 OR ANY
MILITARY BLASTING CAP. 
  
MATERIALS REQUIRED                     HOW USED 
------------------                     -------- 
POTASSIUM CHLORATE                     MEDICINE 
                                       MANUFACTURE OF MATCHES 
PETROLEUM JELLY (VASELINE)             MEDICINE 
                                       LUBRICANT 
PIECE OF ROUND STICK 
WIDE BOWL OR OTHER CONTAINER FOR 
              MIXING INGREDIENTS 
  
  
PROCEDURE 
--------- 
1.  SPREAD POTASSIUM CHLORATE CRYSTALS THINLY ON A HARD SURFACE.  ROLL THE
    ROUND STICK OVER CRYSTALS TO CRUSH INTO A VERY FINE POWDER UNTIL IT
    LOOKS LIKE FACE POWDER OR WHEAT FLOUR. 
2.  PLACE 9 PARTS POWDERED POTASSUIM CHLORATE AND 1 PART PETROLEUM JELLY IN
    A WIDE BOWL OR SIMILAR CONTAINER.  MIX INGREDIENTS WITH HANDS (KNEAD)
    UNTIL A UNIFORM PASTE IS OBTAINED. 
  
  
** NOTE ** STORE EXPLOSIVE IN A WATERPROOF CONTAINER UNTIL READY FOR USE!!!!
  
  
POTASSIUM NITRATE 
----------------- 

 Note from editor (EGGMAN): Part of this part of the file is missing so I
                            am erasing this whole part.
  
INITIATOR FOR DUST EXPLOSIONS 
----------------------------- 
AN INITIATOR WHICH WILL INITIATE COMMON MATERIAL TO PRODUCE DUST EXPLOSIONS
CAN 
BE RAPIDLY AND EASILY CONSTRUCTED.  THIS TYPE OF CHARGE IS IDEAL FOR THE 
DESTRUCTION OF ENCLOSED AREAS SUCH AS ROOMS OR BUILDINGS. 
  
MATERIALS REQUIRED: 
------------------- 
A FLAT CAN, 3 IN. (8 CM) DIAMETER AND 1-1/2 IN. (3 3/4 CM) HIGH.  A 6-1/2
OUNCE 
  TUNA CAN SERVES THE PURPOSE QUITE WELL. 
BLASTING CAP 
EXPLOSIVE 
ALUMINUM (MAY BE WIRE, CUT SHEET, FLATTENED CAN, OR POWDER) 
LARGE NAIL, 4 IN. (10 CM) LONG 
WOODEN ROD - 1/4 IN. (6 MM) DIAMETER 
FLOUR, GASOLINE, AND POWDER OR CHIPPED ALUMINUM 
  
***NOTE***: PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES (COMP. C-4, ETC) PRODUCE BETTER EXPLOSIONS THAN

            CAST EXPLOSIVES (COMP. B, ETC) 
  
PROCEDURE: 
---------- 
1.  USING THE NAIL, PRESS A HOLE THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE TUNA CAN 3/8 TO 1/2 
    INCH (1 TO 1-1/2 CM) FROM THE BOTTOM.  USING A ROTATING AND LEVER ACTION, 
    EMLARGE THE HOLE UNTIL IT WILL ACCOMMODATE THE BLASTING CAP. 
  
2.  PLACE THE WOODEN ROD IN THE HOLE AND POSITION THE END OF THE ROD AT THE 
    CENTER OF THE CAN. 
  
3.  PRESS EXPLOSIVE INTO THE CAN, BEING SURE TO SURROUND THE ROD, UNTIL IT IS 
    3/4 INCH (2 CM) FROM THE TOP OF THE CAN.  CAREFULLY REMOVE THE WOODEN ROD.

  
4.  PLACE THE ALUMINUM METAL ON TOP OF THE EXPLOSIVE. 
  
5.  JUST BEFORE USE, INSERT THE BLASTING CAP INTO THE CAVITY MADE BY THE ROD. 
    THE INITIATOR IS NOW READY FOR USE. 
  
***NOTE***: IF IT IS DESIRED TO CARRY THE INITIATOR SOME DISTANCE, CARDBOARD 
            MAY BE PRESSED ON TOP OF THE ALUMINUM TO INSURE AGAINST LOSS OF 
            MATERIAL. 
  
HOW TO USE: 
----------- 
THIS PARTICULAR UNIT WORKS QUITE WELL TO INITIATE CHARGES OF FIVE POUNDS OF 
FLOUR, 1/2 GALLON (1-2/3 LITERS) OF GASOLINE OF TWO POUNDS OF FLAKE PAINTERS 
ALUMINUM.  THE SOLID MATERIALS MAY MERELY BE CONTAINED IN SACKS OR CARDBOARD 
CARTONS.  THE GASOLINE MAY BE PLACED IN PLASTIC-COATED PAPER MILK CARTONS, 
PLASTIC OR GLASS BOTTLES.  THE CHARGES ARE PLACED DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE 
INITIATOR AND THE BLASTING CAP IS ACTUATED ELECTRICALLY OR BY FUSE DEPENDING
ON 
THE TYPE OF CAP EMPLOYED.  THIS WILL DESTROY A 2000 CUBIC FEET ENCLUSURE 
(BUILDING 10 X 20 X 10 FEET). 
  
***NOTE***: FOR LARGER ENCLOSURES, USE A PROPORTIONATELY LARGER INITIATORS AND

            CHARGES.
