     1.0__________________PREPARATION_OF_LEAD_PICRATE_

     Lead Picrate is used as a primary explosive in the fabrication of
     detonators. It is to be used with a booster explosive such as picric
     acid or RDX.




     MATERIALS REQUIRED (For 1 detonator):

     - Litharge (lead monoxide) (field prepared; also is used in plumbing
       and ceramic cements)
     - Picric Acid (field prepared)
     - Wood alcohol (methanol) (some antifreezes and paint removers)
     - Wooden or plastic rod
     - Dish or saucer (china or glass)
     - Teaspoon
     - Improvised scale



     PROCEDURE:

     1. Weigh out 2 grams (or equal amounts) by weight of picric acid and
        lead monoxide.

     2. Add the picric acid to 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of methanol in a
        container (dish or saucer) and stir.

     3.  Add lead monoxide and stir.

     4. Continue stirring and allow the alcohol to evaporate. NOTE: The
        mixture will suddenly thicken.

     5. Carefully break up this mixture and stir occasionaly until a
        powder is formed (a few lumps will remain).

     6. Remove and spread out to air dry. NOTE: if possible, dry at 100
        degrees C (212 F) for two hours.

     2.0___________________PREPARATION_OF_PICRIC_ACID_FROM_ASPIRIN_

     Picric acid can be used as a booster explosive in detonators or as an
     termediate to preparing lead picrate or DDNP.


     MATERIALS REQUIRED:

     - Aspirin, 20 tablets (5 grain/tablet)
     - Alcohol, 95% pure
     - Concentrated sulphuric acid (boil battery acid until white fumes
       appear)
     - Potassium nitrate (saltpeter)
     - Water
     - Canning jar (1 pint)
     - Hot water bath
     - Paper towels (for filter)
     - Glass tube or rod
     - Glass containers
     - Dish (ceramic or glass)
     - Heat source
     - Cup
     - Teaspoon



     PROCEDURE:

     1. Crush 20 tablets of aspirin in a glass container and work into a
        paste with a teaspoon of water.

     2. Add approximately 1/3 - 1/2 cup (100 ml) of alcohol with stirring
        and filter through a paper towel into another glass container.

        If aspirin is pure enough (usually cheap priced aspirin are) then
        Steps 1, 2 and 3 can be omitted and can proceed and add crushed
        aspirin to Sulphuric Acid.

     3. Discard the solid left on the paper and pour the liquid from the
        container into the dish. Evaporate the alcohol and water on a hot
        water bath, leaving a white powder.

     4. Add this white powder to 1/3 cup (80 ml) of concentrated sulphuric
        acid in a canning jar.

     5. Heat the jar in a simmering hot water bath for 15 minutes and
        remove. Stir; solution will gradually turn black.

     6. Add 3 level teaspoons (15 gm) of potassium nitrate in three
        portions with vigorous stirring. After heating put jar in cold
        water and add potassium nitrate.

     7. Allow the yellow-orange solution to cool to room temperature with
        intermittent stirring.  Solution is darker than yellow-orange.












     8. Pour the solution into 1-1/4 cups (300 ml) of water (cold if
        possible) and allow to cool.  Upon pouring, solution is now yellow-
        orange.

    9. Filter the mixture through a paper towel and wash the light yellow
       material (picric acid) with 1/8 cup (25 ml) of water through paper
       towel. Takes considerable time to filter if genuine filter paper is
       used.

     10. Dry at 160-200 degrees F for two hours. The yield is 4.0-4.5
         grams.

     3.0__________________PREPARATION_OF_TETRAMMINECOPPER_(II)_CHLORATE_

     Tetramminecopper (II) chlorate is a primary explosive that can be made
     from sodium chlorate, copper sulphate, and ammonia.


     MATERIALS REQUIRED:

     - Sodium chlorate (obtain as medicine, weed killer, defoliant, or by
       field method)
     - Copper sulphate (obtain as insecticide, water purifying agent, or by
       field method)
     - Ammonium hydroxide (obtain as household ammonia or smelling salts)
     - Alcohol, 95% pure
     - Wax or clay
     - Water
     - Narrow mouth bottle (wine or coke)
     - Wide mouth bottles (mason jars)
     - Tubing (rubber, copper, steel)
     - Teaspoon
     - Improvised scale
     - Heat source
     - Paper towel (for filter)
     - Pan



     PROCEDURE:

     1. Measure 1/3 teaspoon (2.5 gm) of sodium chlorate in a wide mouth
        bottle, then add 10 teaspoons of alcohol.

     2. Add 1 teaspoon (4 gm) of copper sulphate and stir the mixture just
        under the boiling point for 30 minutes (heat can be supplied by a
        pan of hot water). The mixture will change colour.  NOTE:  Keep
        solution away from flame.

     3. Keep volume of the solution constant by adding additional alcohol
        about every 10 minutes. Remove solution and let cool. Filter
        through folded paper towels into another wide mouth bottle.  Keep
        the liquid.

     4. Add 1 cup (250 ml) of ammonia to the narrow mouth bottle. Placing
        tubing that it extends about 1-1/2 inches inside bottle, then seal
        tubing to bottle with wax (pitch, clay, etc.).

     5. Place tubing into solution from step (3) such that the end of the
        tubing is projected about 3/4 of the way into the solution. If the
        narrow mouth bottle is not taller than the wide mouth bottle, then
        elevate the narrow mouth bottle so than the tubing falls into the
        flask.

     6. Bubble ammonia gas through solution until colour of the solution
        changes from a light green to a dark blue (approximately 10
        minutes) and continue bubbling for another ten minutes.

     CAUTION: At this point the solution is a primary explosive. Keep away
              from flame!

     7. Reduce the volume of the solution to about 1/3 of its original
        volume by evaporating in the air or in a stream of air.

     8. Filter crystals through a folded paper towel and wash once with 1
        teaspoon alcohol, dry overnight (16 hours).

     CAUTION: Explosive is shock and flame sensitive. Store in a capped
              container.

     4.0___POTASSIUM_(OR_SODIUM)_NITRATE_AND_LITHARGE_(LEAD_MONOXIDE)_

     Either of the nitrates are needed to prepare DDNP and litharge is
     required for the preparation of lead picrate.


     MATERIALS REQUIRED:

     - Lead metal (small pieces or chips)
     - Potassium (or sodium) nitrate
     - Wood (methyl) alcohol
     - Iron pipe with closed end or cap (one end only)
     - Iron rod (screwdriver)
     - Paper towels
     - Glass jars, wide mouth (2 each)
     - Pan (metal)
     - Heat source (such as hot coals or blow torch)
     - Improvised scale
     - Cup



     PROCEDURE:

     1. Mix 12 grams of lead and 4 grams of potassium (or sodium) nitrate.
        Place the mixture in the iron container (iron pipe) and heat in a
        hot bed of coals or by a blow torch for hour or more.

     2. Remove the container and allow to cool. Chip out the yellow solid
        with the screwdriver and add to 1/2 cup (120 ml) of methyl alcohol
        in the jar.  Orange- Brown solid, cream colour in alcohol.

     3. Heat the mixture in a pan of hot water until it reacts. Solution
        turns darker upon heating.

     4. Filter the mixture through a paper towel into the second each time
        and air dry before using in explosive preparation (for example,
        lead picrate).

     6. Place the jar with the liquid in the hot water and heat until
        alcohol has evaporated. The remaining powder is the nitrite, snowy
        liquid; some white powder appears but not much.

     NOTE: Sodium nitrite has a strong tendency to absorb water from the
           atmosphere and should be stored in a closed container.

     5.0_________EVAPORATION_OF_COPPER_SULPHATE_(PENTAHYDRATE)_

     Copper sulphate is a required material for the preparation of TAC.



     MATERIALS REQUIRED:

     - Copper wire or pieces
     - Sulphuric acid (battery)
     - Potassium nitrate or nitric acid (field grades)
     - Alcohol
     - Water
     - Two heat resistant glasses or jars, one pint
     - Paper towels
     - Metal pan (for hot water bath)
     - Wooden rod
     - Improvised scale
     - Cup



     PROCEDURE:

     1. Place 10 grams of copper into one of the jars and add one cup (240
        ml) of sulphuric (battery) acid. To this mixture add 12 grams of
        potassium nitrate, or 1-1/2 teaspoons of nitric acid. NOTE: Nitric
        acid gives a product of greater purity.

     2. Heat the mixture on a hot water bath (near boiling) until the
        bubbling has ceased (requires about two hours).

     CAUTION: This reaction evolves strong toxic fumes and therefore must
              be performed in an open, well ventilated area.

     3. Pour the hot blue liquid into a second vessel (keeping the
        unreacted copper in the first jar) and allow to cool at room
        temperature.

     4. After the crystals have formed, carefully pour away the liquid and
        break up the crystals. Then add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of alcohol to the
        powder and stir.

     5. Pour the solution through the towel filter and wash the solid left
        on the paper three times, using 1/2 cup (120 ml) portions of the
        alcohol each time.

     6. Allow the product to air dry for two hours.

     6.0__________________MISCELLANEOUS_NASTIES_



     FIREBOMBS: Most fire bombs are simply gasoline filled bottles with a
                fuel soaked rag in the mouth. The original Molotov
                cocktail, and still about the best, was a mixture of one
                part gasoline and one part motor oil.
                The oil helps it to cling to what it splatters on.  Some
                use one part roofing tar and one part gas. Fire bombs have
                been found which were made by pouring melted wax into gas.




     NAPALM:    About the best fire bomb is napalm. It has a thick
                consistency, like jam and is best for use on vehicles or
                buildings. Napalms are simply one part petrol and one part
                soap. The soap is either soap flakes or shredded bar soap.
                Detergents are out. The soap must be melted with the
                petrol to form napalm.
                The easiest way is to fill a sink with very hot water, and
                place the bottle containing the mixture into it. The water
                will melt the soap flakes, thus combining with the petrol.

                WARNING : PLACING A CONTAINER OF PETROL NEAR ANY SOURCE OF
                          HEAT WILL PRODUCE EXTREME QUANTITIES OF PETROL
                          VAPOURS TO BE RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

                It is recommended that you preform this task in a well
                ventilated area, and far far away from a nacked flame.



     MATCH HEAD BOMB: Simple safety match heads in a pipe, capped at both
                ends, make a devastating bomb. It is set off with a regular
                fuse. A plastic bag is put into the pipe before the heads
                go in to prevent detonation by contact with the metal.
                Cutting enough match heads to fill the pipe can be tedious
                work for one but an evening's fun for the family if you can
                drag them away from the Tv.




     FUSE IGNITION FIRE BOMB: A four strand homemade fuse is used for this.
                It burns like fury. It is held down and concealed by a
                strip of bent tin cut from a can. The exposed end of the
                fuse is dipped into the flare igniter.  To use this one,
                you light the fuse and hold the fire bomb until the fuse
                has burned out of sight under the tin. Then throw it and
                when it breaks the burning fuse will ignite the contents.
                I recomend using Napalm for this...













     CAST EXPLOSIVES:     Potassium Chlorate 33 parts, Potassium Nitrate 33
                parts, Sugar 24 parts, Powdered Coal 10 parts. Mix in
                enough water to dissolve the chemicals and make a stiff
                putty. Form by hand to the desired shape and allow to dry.



     PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES #1: A plastic explosive used by Germany during
                WWII.  Potassium Chlorate 96%, Fuel oil 4%. Or Sodium
                Chlorate and fuel oil.


     NITROGEN TRIIODIDE:  Mix 1 pint of laundry type Ammonium with 4 ounces
                of drug store type Iodine. Shake well for 5 minutes. Pour
                the mixture through a Mr. Coffee Filter. Throw away the
                liquid. The dark red mud like material in the filter is
                nitrogen Triiodide. When dry it is very unstable. very very
                very sensitive to friction, heat, shock, static
                electricity, etc.
                Apply wet, and allow to dry.  Very High Explosive. So
                sensitive that it will explode when touched with a feather.


     PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES #2: Mix 8 parts Potassium Chlorate to every 1 part
                Vassaline. Heat over a small flame (Like a match) for 2
                minutes. Use an Electronic Detonator to set off.


     ANS:       Grind up 10 lbs. of Ammonium Nitrate in a blender. Mix in 1
                lb. Sulphur. Mix well. Place 1/4 of the mixture in a 6x6x6
                cardboard box. Use the cardboard tube from a toilet paper
                roll. Cut the tube in half.  Tape one end shut. Place fuse
                in one side of the Tube.  Fill tube with FLASH POWDER. Tape
                the other end of the tube shut.  This is the detonator for
                the ANS.  Place the detonator in the centre of the box and
                fill the box with ANS.  The above mixture will make 2 5 lb.
                boxes of ANS.

     6.10________________The_'mail_man'_High_explosive_system_

     The mail man is a basic explosive unit which can house a variety of
     primary explosives.


     MATERIALS REQUIRED

     - A length of copper pipe ( or lead ) , with a diameter of 25mm.
     - A role of duct tape, or strong plastic tape.
     - A length of PVC pipe, of 50mm dia +
     - Previously prepared base explosive of your choice.
     - 2 metal caps, same diameter as PVC pipe.
     - 10mm of 5A fuse wire.
     - 2 lengths of 1.5mm insulated electrical wire.
       ( as used in David Ried kits )
     - A Tamiya 7.2V connecter set.  ( any connecter set will do )
     - A vice.
     - A soldering iron, and some solder.
     - Pair of alligator clips.


     PROCEDURE

     1.  Solder the ends of the fuse wire to the lengths of electrical
         wire.

     2.  Crush one end of the copper pipe and fold it over to form a seal.

     3.  Fill the copper pipe with the base explosive you have prepare,
         insert the fuse wire so it is as close to the middle as possible,
         and leaving enough wire poking out the top of the copper pipe.

     4.  Crush the other end of the copper pipe, making sure you don't cut
         the wire in the process.

                You now have constructed the core of the Mail Man.

     5.  Solder the wires poking out from the copper pipe to one of the
         connecters from the connecter set.

     6.  Wrap the copper pipe in tape until it fits snugly into the PVC
         pipe. Make sure you have sufficient tape on the ends of the copper
         pipe as they are the weak points.

     7.  Insert the core into the PVC pipe, secure the steal caps, then
         wrap tape thoughly around the PVC pipe making sure you have put
         enough tape on the ends to hold the caps.

     NOTE : Don't tape the connecter up, It must be outside and accessible.

     WARNING:  THIS BOMB CAN NOT BE DETONATED SAFELY WITH A CONVENTIONAL
               FIRE WORKS FUSE. IT HAS TO HAVE AN ELECTRIC DETONATION
               SYSTEM.












     You now have the basic mail man explosive. It should resemble the
     following diagram.

     CAUSION : IF MADE CORRECTLY, THE MAIL MAN IS A LETHAL EXPLOSIVE. IT
               WILL CAUSE FATAL INJURIES, AND AROUSE THE INTEREST OF YOUR
               LOCAL POLICE.




     USING THE MAIL MAN

     As this explosive will remove all traces of the target, you should
     detonate it at a safe distance. That is why the connecter set is
     needed. I recommend that you make a cable, at least 20m long, from an
     extension cable. Solder the other connector to one end and the
     alligator clips at the other end.

     place your bomb wisely, plug in the connecters and clip ONE alligator
     clip onto a car battery. ( or any other 12V battery with a discharge
     of 40A + ) When you are ready, touch the other alligator clip to the
     battery to detonate.





     CAUSION : IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU BE BEHIND A WALL, OR SOME OBJECT
               TO THAT EFFECT AS THE BLAST WILL THROW SHRAPNEL IN ALL
               DIRECTIONS.

     Now that the feds have outlawed fireworks, you'd better save all the
     M80s you can find.  Extremely versatile devices, M80s are excellent
     propellants for other substances.  For example, this stunt started out
     as a dorm prank at Clapper Packer University but soon escalated into
     more deadly sport, which went like this.

     Put some fresh feces, the looser the better, into a large Baggie.
     Gently break the glass on a large-wattage light bulb, but do not
     disturb the filament.  Even more gently attach the filament to the
     fuse of the M80.  Screw the bulb carefully back into a ceiling socket.
     Finally, move the bag of feces up and around the light fixture. Be
     certain the fuse and filament do not touch the feces, but see that the
     M80 is into the substance. Tape the bag to the ceiling.

     Naturally, all this presupposes you have access to the mark's room or
     to a room where the mark is likely to be the one who comes in and
     turns on the light.  One cautionary note:  Be sure the light switch is
     off when you screw in the bulb. If it's not, you have about four
     seconds to avoid getting nasty coverage from the M80's blast.  Done
     correctly, this is a spectacular stunt.

     As the designer of this one, George Dierk adds, "You don't have to
     limit your spatter substance to feces.  Paint, cheap perfume, acid,
     and CS gas all have their place."

     Gun powder has a lot of uses in addition to filling up a portion of
     cartridges.  If your mark has an outdoor barbecue, you could sprinkle
     a cup of old-fashioned black powder around the bottom of the grill.
     When the powder ignites it will do so with a huge, whooshy flash,
     accompanied by a great white cloud of smelly smoke. I would hate to
     imagine the multiple effects of such a pyrotechnical display on one of
     those fancy grills powered by LPG.

                              W o w  !!!

     Don't let your imagination rest with the cookout grill.  Remember
     fireplaces, wood stoves, ovens, etc.  The experts suggest you use
     black powder rather than the more modern smokeless powders.   Black
     powder really works!

     If you can't get a regular smoke-bomb device, a smoke grenade, or
     something real from the military, make your own.  According to Doctor
     Abraham Hoffman, the noted chemist, you combine four parts sugar to
     six-parts saltpeter (potassium nitrate).  You heat this mixture over a
     very low flame until it starts to blend into a plastic substance.

     When it begins to gel, remove it from the heat and allow it to cool.
     He suggests you stick a few wooden match heads into the mass while
     it's still pliable.











     You also add a fuse at this point. The smoke device is nonexplosive
     and nonflammable. But a pound of this mixture will produce enough
     thick smoke to cover a city block. Watch which way the wind blows.


     John E Warrenburger likes to mess up people's nervous systems.  One of
     his favourite nonlethal tricks involving nonexplosives is a good bit
     of cardiac theatre.

     John says, "I bundle a few of those road flares -- the ones in the red
     jackets -- together and wrap them with black plastic tape.  Connect
     this with some coiled wiring to a ticking alarm clock and place it so
     your mark will get the full visual and aural effect."

     Applause, applause, John.  Only God and the mark's launderer will know
     how dastardly the frightening effect of the bogus bomb is on the
     mark's nervous system.
