                                 The Destructor

Materials:

1 CO2 Cartridge - Used in BB guns - come in a pack of five - Target sells them
                  for $1.50 a pack.
2 Size D Estes model rocket engines - found in most hobby stores where model
                                      rockets are sold. (Any size will work but
                                      D's have the most powder)
2 Solar igniters - usually come with the engines - used to ignite the bomb
1 Bottle of fast drying model glue
1 Scissors
1 Funnel
1 roll of masking tape
1 hammer
1 container (jar, cup, glass)
1 20 foot wire (+ and -)
1 6 volt (or 12 volt) lantern battery


Procedure:

  The CO2 cartridge is the body of the bomb and when it explodes will fragment
.. so stand back..  Metal flies!!

  If you have a CO2 BB gun then you will have many empty cartridges. For those
of you who have never bought CO2 cartridges you will have to find some other
way of emptying them. I have done this on accident before, simply insert a nail
in the top of the cartridge and watch the CO2 gas come out!! Very cold if you
let it touch you. I do not suggest doing it this way, so if possible, ask a
friend who has a CO2 BB gun for their empty CO2 cartridges.

Make the hole bigger:

  Once you have an empty cartridge you have to make the hole bigger, otherwise
it is very difficult to get the explosive compounds into the cartridge. Take a
nail and pound the hole bigger. The size of the hole is very important. If it
is too big the cartridge will act as a rocket instead of a bomb.

Prepare the explosive ingredients:

  Unroll the model rocket engines with a pocket knife, until you have the black
chunk of boosting compound. Throw away the unrolling paper. You may remove the
block of clay since this is not explosive. Powder the chunk with the hammer
until you have fine powder. To make the fine powder, lay down some wax paper
on the floor. Find a screen mesh, and filter the powder, leaving the big pieces
on top and the fine powder on the wax paper. Then pour the powder on the wax
paper into a container. After you have the two size D engines powdered and in
the container you are ready to put the powder into the CO2 cartridge.

Get the ingredients in the cartridge:

  Make a funnel out of paper (a floppy disk jacket works well, with the end
clipped off) and tape it around the end of the cartridge. Slowly pour the
powder from the container into the funnel. You may have to use a toothpick to
help the powder through the funnel and into the cartridge. If your powder is
not fine enough it might jam in the hole and you will have to remove the funnel
and clear the passage. Shake the cartridge every so often until you can't hear
the powder in there. The cartridge is now full of explosive powder.

Prepare the igniter:

  Clip the paper protector of the igniter with a scissors and bend the wires so
they are relatively straight. (Be careful not to break the igniter when bending
the wires) Coat the igniter with glue except for the ends, and let it dry for a
few minutes. Then insert the igniter into the cartridge leaving the ends
exposed. The tip of the igniter must touch the powder for the powder to ignite.
This should be no problem if you have enough powder in the cartridge. Put glue
around the igniter and the tip of the cartridge and let dry.

Connecting the bomb:

  Then bend the end wires of the igniter and connect to your 20 foot wire.
Put tape around the end wires and cartridge. The Destructor is now ready to
detonate.

Detonating the bomb:

  When you have found a place to detonate The Destructor, stretch the
wire the full 20 feet and then touch both wires to the two negative and
positive connectors. This will send a 6 volt charge through the wire and to the
igniter.  The igniter will ignite the explosive compounds in the cartridge and
in a matter of seconds........   BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
