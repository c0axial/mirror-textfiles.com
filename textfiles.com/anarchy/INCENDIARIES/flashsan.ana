       Mixing Your own Flash Powder
It is easy to get a file on how to make salutes, or how to make "meal powder,"
but, in the files I've read, they just use the generic term "flash powder" to
mean the explosive stuff in your fireworks.
There are 2 types of explosives.  Type I uses a non-explosive flash powder.
"How can this be?" you ask?  Well, the retort from a type I explosive comes
from the rupturing of the case, not from the detonation of the powder.  But
we've all lit off M-80s, which have only a flimsy casing, which couldn't
possibly account for the loud, ear-ringing bang you get from one.  That comes
from a more powerful powder which explodes when lit.  This is a type ][
explosive.  Potassium and barium nitrate powders, as well as black powder are
used in type I explosives.  Potassium chlorate and perchlorate powders are used
in type ][ explosives.  The list below has formulas for both types.

Potassium perchlorate mixtures:
1-  50% potassium perchlorate
    25% dark pyro aluminum
    25% sulfur flour

2-  70% potassium perchlorate
    30% black german aluminum

3-  50% potassium perchlorate
    30% black antimony sulfide
    20% sulfur flour

4-  75% potassium perchlorate
    25% dark pyro aluminum

5-  60% potassium perchlorate
    40% sulfur flour


Potassium chlorate mixtures (note 1)

1-  50% potassium chlorate
    50% red arsenic sulfide

2-  60% potassium chlorate
    25% sulfur flour
    10% potassium nitrate
     5% red arsenic sulfide


Barium/potassium nitrate (type I)

1-  50% potassium nitrate
    30% sulfur flour
    20% dark pyro aluminum

2-  50% potassium nitrate
    50% 100 mesh magnesium

3-  60% potassium nitrate
    30% sulfur flour
    10% charcoal dust

4-  50% barium nitrate     (note 2)
    50% 100 mesh magnesium

5-  50% strontium nitrate  (note 2)
    50% 100 mesh magnesium

note 1- Chlorate mixtures are EXTREMELY dangerous.  Don't mix them unless you
like playing russian roulette.

note 2- These mixtures give colored flashes.

Mixing fireworks is very dangerous, and, I personally would never, ever, not-in-
a-million-years ever mix them.  For all you sickos out there who do, I assume no
responsibility for any damage you fiendishly cause, or any injury that results
from the manufature or use of the explosives detailed here.  This was for
information purposes only, blah, blah, blah.
