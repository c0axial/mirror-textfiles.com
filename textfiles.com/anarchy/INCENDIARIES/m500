      The information in the following file is for entertainment
purposes only. This stuff DOES work, but we are not telling you 
to do it. You are responsible for your own actions.

 
 
 
Ok, first you need the chemicals, you can get them from a
chemical supply house or from a message sent to me on this system
from any interested person that wants to buy them a lot cheaper
than the supply house will sell them to you for.
Just send a message to Phil Rudd on Board #4 and please make it Private.
Ok, now the chemicals consist of:
1.sulphur (yellow powdered)
2.powdered aluminum- alcoa#422 (400 mesh or higher)
3.potassium chlorate- chunky
The Tubes (Cardboard, and appropriate size for m-80's or m-100's or
           whatever size you want.)
And you need sometning to plug the ends. (Like hot glue or Bondo)
Fuse.  (obtainable from hobby shop. Rocket Fuse)


To start, Plug one end of the tube with hot glue or bondo. Put 2 or 3
small cotton balls in the end or 1 large one. This will hole the glue
 or bondo in place, and absorb any moisture while in the tude.
When the end of the tube you sealed is dry, Poke a hole in the middle of
the tube that is just big enough to push the wick in.
Ok, now cut a piece of wick to put in the hole you just made.
A good size wick is 2" for m-80's and 5" for m-500
Now for the powder mixture. Follow this EXACTLY as I have stated.
or you might be sorry. I have made these countless times and never
had an accident so here it goes!

Get a plactic container and a PLASTIC spoon. No Metal!!! Pour
4 parts by volume or 2 parts by weight of the potassium chlorate
Crush it with a plastic spoon, then add 8 part by volume
or 1 part by weight of the powdered aluminum and mix
together then add the sulpher 3 parts volume or 1 part by weight 
and mix all together now you have the famed SILVER POWDER
that they use in m80s and firecrackers.
Now, take the powder and fill the open ends of the tubes. Then
Put a small ball of cotton in the open end and seal it like you did
 before.
Don't worry, if you use hot glue, it will not ignite the powder.
 
You now have a real m-80 or whatever you made. (like, if you use an
 oatmeal box, you have an m-3000 or something!)

    A few cautions follow:

 (1)  Never smoke around the powder, even if it is not mixed
      yet. 
 (2)  Never make large amounts. A good amount for each batch is
      about a Cigar box full.
 (3)  Never use any metal spoons or metal bowls. They could set
      off the mixture when you are mixing it.
 (4)  Never plug the ends with any sharp or Extremely hard
      material. Bondo is sometimes dangerous because the ends
      fly out a high velocity and can act like bullets! Windows
      have been broken by flying bondo!

       I usually use tubes that are 4 inches long and have a 1 inch
 inside diameter. The cardbaord sghoule be relatively thick if you
 want a good noise. Toilet paper tubes are too thin. The cardboard
 on a 4" X 1" tube should be 1/16 - 1/8 of an inch thick.

     Good luck and don't blow your hands off, or you won't be able
 to call this sytem and type anything!!
