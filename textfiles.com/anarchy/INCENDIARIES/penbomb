                              EXPLOSIVE PENS

     Here are the instructions for building a device no agent should be
without.  From the mind of "Q" himself, a device for your evaluation.

Materials......

           [1]-(1) "Felt" Tip Pen
           [2]-(1) "Ball" Point Pen
           [3]-(1)  High quality firecracker!
           [4]-(1)  8 gram measure potassium parmagranite (optional)
           [5]-(x)  Scotch Tape
           [6]-(1)  Large Paper Clip
           [7]-(2)  Packages of matches
           [8]-(1)  Pair of scissors
           [9]-(1)  Length of Beige thread

Assembly......

[1]- Use thread to friction saw the felt tip pen in half at the point
     where the cap "snaps" onto the pen. (about mid-section)
[2]- Remove the innerts of the felt tip pen, and throw them away.
[3]- Pull the innerts out of a bic ball point pen and remove the ball
     point assembly at the front of the pen.
[4]- Use scissors to widen the hole in the "felt" end of the pen.  Insert
     the ball assembly and make sure it is a tight fit.  It should now
     look as if the felt tip pen was constructed as a ball point pen.
[5]- Cut off abrasive strips from the packs of matches.  It is best if they
     have not been used. Tape these to the top of the firecracker near
     the fuse, the strips should run parallel to the outstreched fuse.
     Wrap fuse over the top of one strip and tape down so fuse runs parallel
     to abrasive strips.
[6]- Unbend paperclip and tape a match to the metal rod, the match should
     be parallel to the rod and it should be taped tight using as little
     tape as possible.
[7]- Insert the match head 1/5 of the way between the abrasive strips
     and wrap tapou too will have to take
a nice long shower.
