         Common Rocket Fuel
         ------------------

         Materials:

1.) Potassium Nitrate (KNO ) or 
                          3
    "Saltpeter". This can be obtained
    from a drugstore, or ordered from
    a chemical supply house.
                          
2.) Sugar (Powdered is the best)

         Procedure:

1.) Mix the two together 1/2 Nitrate
    and 1/2 Sugar.

2.) Take an old cooking pan, and
    melt the two together. There
    is NO way for it to ignite.

3.) It should turn into a fudgey
    looking compound. Pour this
    compound into a rocket engine
    such as a cardboard tube, and
    set a fuse into the compound
    and let the compound harden.

         Chlorate Mixtures
         -----------------

NOTE: The main ingredient for this
      experiment is potassium or 
      sodium chlorate.  Both of these
      will do equally well.  However,
      both may prove difficult to
      find.  Probably the only way to
      get it would be to order it 
      through a chemical supply house.

Materials: 
----------

1) Potassium chlorate or sodium 
   chlorate.

2) Powdered charcoal

3) Powdered aluminum
 
4) Sulfur

Procedure:
----------

NOTE:  There is no set procedure for
       making chlorate mixtures.
       The only special thing ABOUT
       chlorate mixtures is that
       they have a chlorate in them.
       Experiment with diffiernt 
       proportions of each of the 
       ingredients. All of the
       chlorate mixtures I made had
       no set procedure and I just
       experimented with the 
       proportions of each of the
       ingredients. Most of your 
       mixture, however, should be
       potassium chlorate or sodium
       chlorate.

1)  Make sure that you mix the 
    sulfur and charcoal and aluminum
    first.  You may grind  these in
    a mortar and pestal to get a good
    mix of these ingredients.

2)  Add potassium chlorate or sodium
    chlorate.  Mix them VERY CAREFULLY
    in the mortar and pestal.  DO NOT
    GRIND the mixture once the 
    chlorate has been added or it will
    ignite and burn the shit out of
    you.

3)  You now may use the mixture for
    whatever you want to.  Chlorate
    mixtures are some of the best
    compositions there are and, in 
    my experiences, they are the best
    except for model  rocket 
    propellant (procedure for making
    this is given later).

Materials
---------

1.) Zinc (Zn) <---NOTE: This is not the
                        same as Zinc
                        Oxide!
2.) Sulfur (S)

Procedure
---------

1.) Mix the two together 1/2 and 1/2.

2.) MAKE SURE that you mix them very
    well. The best way to do so, is to
    put the mixture in a jar with a lid
    and shake it up for 15-60 seconds,
    until it is all a greyish color.

3.) To ignite, use a fuse, or throw a 
    match into the powder. WARNING,
    this burns very very quickly, and
    produces smoke. Also it burns at
    a fairly high temperature. It will
    surprise you when you throw a match
    into it. There will be a delay, and
    then all of a sudden, it will flash
    up, and is capable of burning the
    hell out of you.

Common Uses
-----------

1.) Rocket Fuel
2.) Bombs <--- NOTE: The best way to do
                     this is to take
                     it and compress
                     it into cardboard
                     tubing.
3.) Smoke bombs (Cardboard tube w/ big
                 hole.)
4.) Flare bombs.
5.) The rest is up to your imagination

          GOOD LUCK!

         Nitrate Compound
         ----------------
Materials
---------

1.) Potassium Nitrate (KNO )
                          3

2.) Aluminum Powder (dust) (Al)

3.) Sulfur (S)

Procedure
---------

1.) Take 2 Tablespoons KNO
                          3

2.) 2 Tablespoons Al

3.) 1/2-1 Tablespoon S

4.) Mix and shake, until all is one
    solid color. Silver-grey. 

5.) You can light this with a fuse
    or throw a match into it to light.
    You may experiment with the ratios.
    Here are a few tips:

    a.) To make more smoke add more
        sulfur to the mixture.
    b.) To make it burn slower, add
        more Potassium Nitrate.
    c.) To make it burn faster, add
        more Aluminum Dust.

        Rocket Fuel No.2 (high grade)
        ----------------

NOTE: This is the best composition
      for rocket fuel.  It is one
      of the best compositions I have
      ever tried.  Only mercury 
      fulminate was better, and I
      don't care to describe that!

Materials:
----------

1)  Model rocket engine (any engine
    will do, but the bigger ones like
    C or D engines are recommeded).

2)  Hammer 


Procedure:
----------

1)  First, using the hammer, knock
    out the ceramic nozzle of the
    engine.  The color of the nozzle
    is light gray.  

2)  When you start to see black grains
    in the gray of the nozzle powder,
    put the rocket engine in a shoe
    box or something else to catch
    the propellant.  Now hit the 
    engine with the hammer to get the
    propellant out (careful, not too
    hard). 

3)  When all the propellant has been
    removed and is in the shoe box,
    grains will be in size ranging 
    from dust to pieces about 1/2 inch
    in size. You may take out the 
    propellant and use it for 
    whatever you wish.  WARNING: DO
    NOT EVER GRIND THIS MIXTURE!
    It might explode in your face!
    Use it only in the form you got
    it from the engine.  Also, since
    I don't know what model  rocket
    propellant is made out of, I don't
    know how poisonous it is.  As a
    rule, however, do not let it get
    on you and always wash after 
    experiments with it (this is just
    a good procedure for any experi-
    ment dealing with chemicals).
