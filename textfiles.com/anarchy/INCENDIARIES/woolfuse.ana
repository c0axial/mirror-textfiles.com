     Well first of all I reccommend
that you read the file on my board
about landmines... If you can't then
here is the conecpt. You can use an
m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other
type of elxplose that will light with
a fuse. Now the way this works is
if you have a 9volt batery, from a
radio ctlred car or what ever and
get either a solor igniter (preferably)
or some steel wool you can create
a remote ignition system. What you
do it set up a schematic like this.

        ------------------>+ batery
 steel ||                ->- batery
 wool  ||                /
  :==:---  <--fuse       \
       ||                /
       ---- spst switch--\

So when the switch is on the currnet
will flow through the steel wool or
igniter and heat up causing the fuse
to light.
     Note: For use with steel wool
try it first and get a really thin
peice of wire and pump the current
through it to make sure it will heat
up to light the explosive.

**********************************
Now the thing to do is plant your
explosive whereever you want it to
be but bury it and cover the wires
obviously... Now take a this wire
fishing line is good about 20 lb.
test and tie one end of the wire
to a secure object. Have your switch
secured to seomthing to and make a
loop on the other end on the line.
Put the loop around the switch such
that when pulled it will pull the
switch and set off the explosive.

to ignite the explosive... The thing
to do is to experiment with this
and find your best method... Let me
know on any good kills, or new
techniques... On my board...
