Ok, here I go a ramblin again... Today, I spent the whole day modifying
some "Safe & Sane" fireworks I bought across the street. So, I decided to
share my knowledge of this hobby for the readers of DnA. If you stocked up
during the holiday, then read on, otherwise, keep this file until next year,
and then read it then.

Ok, how many lamerz out there have NEVER tried any of those weird anarchy
shit found in such text files such as the Jolly Roger's Cookbook, the 
Anarchist's Cookbook, etc?? Well, I hope you said yes, becuz if you have, 
you most likely wouldn't be alive still. The recipes found in those articles 
are there only for PURE reading enjoyment only... doing some of the stuph 
in there would certainly mean your doom. So maybe you're an anarchist at 
heart, but don't want to risk your dick, what do you do??? Well, here are
a couple of ALMOST foolproof explosives derived from common class 'C'
fireworks.

As you might have already guessed, even such safe shit can cause serious
injury or blindness. I take no resposibility in your actions... but that
shouldn't stop you!! This file was meant to be enjoyed at your expense
(or arm... ;) I would like to give credit to my kewl neighbor who helped
me actually build and devise some of these things.

Equipment
~~~~~~~~~
Some class 'C' fireworks in your possession should include the following:

        ş A large amount of Picolo Pete's

        ş A large amount of TNT Ground Bloom Flowers

        ş A large amount of Junior Smokey Pots  
        
And if you decide to make some of the accompanied accessories, you should 
have the following:

        ş 3/4" PVC Pipe

        ş 1" PVC Pipe Link

        ş Some copper wire

        ş 3 3-5" Screws        

        ş Epoxy

Ok, here is where the fun starts. Let's start with the basics. Almost every-
body knows the trick on how to make Picolo Pete's blow up. What?? You don't
know it?? Well, all you have to do is take off the stand it came on, strip
off all of the outside covering that surrounds the Picolo Pete, and get a
hammer, and pound it all around the middle of it. This compresses the powder,
and if you light it, it should start whistling, and when it get's about half
way through, it'll make a substantial bang. Taking this idea even further, 
I have devised a way to lanch them a wayz before they explode. Just follow
the schematics, it should be self-explainitory:

 ³                                              triangular formation
 Opening where you can light the
 Picolo Pete

Now all you have to do is place the modified Picolo Pete into the front end,
and let it slide down to where the wire is. The wire should cover the 
diameter of the tube, and will stop the Picolo Pete from sliding down any
further. Now, using the screws as a stand, position the device at an angle
and light the fuse to the Picolo Pete. Stand back and watch it shoot off and
explode. Other shit you can do with this is get a fairly thick nail, about 
2 inches or so and using a hammer, pound it into the back end of a TNT
GBF (Ground Bloom Flower). Make sure the nail goes in straight, if there is
a slight angle, it won't fly straight. Then stick it into the gizmo you made
above and do the same thing you did for the Picolo Pete. This one is 
unpredictable at times, but should fly up and do some weird spins in the air.
You can also make what is called a "nigger chaser". All you have to do, is
strip a Picolo Pete down until there is only one layer of cardboard between
it and the powder inside. Launch this through the gizmo, and when it falls
on the ground, it will thrash wildely around. If you want to make small 
generic explosives, burn off one of those Junior Smokey Pots and save the
shell. Then, using a hammer, pound the powder out of a Picolo Pete. Pack the
powder into the shell of the JSP and then epoxy the top with a fuse. After
the epoxy dries, what you will have is a small cherry bomb type explosive.
Of course, if you're too lazy to do these fine tricks, just go down to TJ
and buy a whole shit load of M-80's and Skyrockets. Well, that's it, if you
have any more suggestions, pleaze send me some mail at Digital Decay, late.
