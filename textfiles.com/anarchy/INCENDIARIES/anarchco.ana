	-Introduction-

  This file is for those of you who do not own a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook,
and I am going to retype some recipies for bombs and traps and the like.  If you
have a copy of the book, then please abort this file now, as it will do you no
good to read it.

	-Whistle Trap-
  Do you have a gym teacher that you would like to get rid of?	Well, you have
come to the right place.

	Ingredients:
   His Whistle (of course!)
   Iodine crystals or other friction-sensitive explosives
   Sand
   Glue

  Take the whistle and steam it for a while until it comes apart in its two
natural halves that it was molded together in.

  Cover the inside with a very light layer of glue, and put the iodine crystals
all over the inside of the whistle.  make sure that the crystals are not
submerged inside of the glue, or it will not work.  Just sprinkle them all over
the inside.

  Next take the sand and make a ball of it using the glue.et it dry and you
should have a little rough ball of sand.

  Now, insert the ball of sand inside and glue the two halves together.  The
next day when your gym teacher tries to blow his whistle, the ball will fly
around inside of the whistle and blow his head off!



	-Ball Point Pen Trap-

  An ordinart metal or plastic retractible ball point pen can be turned into a
lethal weapon in a matter of minutes.  The refill ink cartrige is removed and in
it's place is put a small amount of tetryl (see below on how to make it) Above
the charge is placed a firing pin.  The pin will be held under pressure at the
top end of the pen by the pen's own spring.  The tension is released by
reversing the firing pin motion.  When the user pushes the button at the end of
the pen, the firing pin is then relesased and goes crashing into the tetryl and
thus blows the victim's hand off.

	-Lamp Trap-

  A personell booby trap can be made by taking any oil or kerosene lamp and
draining it of all it's fuel.  Now replace the oil with high octane gasoline.
When lit, this will cause a massive incenedary explosion.  A candle can also be
booby-trapped by simply stuffing a small amount of lead azide or tetryl pellets
into the wax at the top of the candle.	It will be detonated by the fire on the
wick.


	-Molotov Cocktail-

  This is an incendairy bomb, which bursts into flame upon breaking.  A soda
bottle is two-thirds gasoline and one-third oil.  A fuse is made of an old
gasoline-soaked rag, and stuffed into the mouth of the bottle, with a large
portion of it sticking out.  The bottle is then corked tightly.  To use it,
simply light the rag and throw it at the enemy.  The cocktail will explode upon
breakage, and the enemy will not be able to extinguish the fire with water.
These are extremely easy to make, and easy to store.  According to reports, they
can disable a tank.

	-Tamping-

  Tamping is not an explosive, but rather a way to control the power and
direction of the explosion.  In other words, if a pound of black powder is
ignited with a match, the explosion will occur but most of the destructive force
will take the path of the least amount of resistance-- the atmosphere.	Now, if
the same pound of black powder was placed inside an iron pipe, and sealed at
both ends, except for a tiny hole for the fuse, the explosion could be regulated
with ease.This tamping operation is necessary for any forms of demolition in
order that the operation be succesful.	A stick of dynamite when placed on a
concrete roadway untamped will create a very small crater, perhaps a few inches.
If the same stick of dynamite were tamped, by placing several sandbags on and
around it, the explosion would create a much greater crater.  The tamping is
ABSOLUTELY necessary for the destruction of bulidings, bridges, and other large
structures.

	-How to Make Tetryl-

  Tetryl is commonly used in compounds containing TNT, and it works great by
itself.  Method for the preperation of tetryl:

  1.  A small amount of dimethyllaniline is dissolved in an excess amount of
concentrated sulferic acid (sulferic acid=battery acid).

  2.  This mixture is now added to an equal amount of nitric acid.  The new
mixture is kept in an ice bath and is well stirred.

  3.  After about five minutes, the tetryl is fltered and washed in cold water.

  4.  It is now boiled in fresh water, which contains a small amount of sodium
bicarbonate(baking soda).  This process acts to neutralize the remaining acid.
The washings are repeated as many times as necesary according to the litmus
paper tests.  When you are satisfied that the tetryl is free of acid, filter it
from the water and allow it to dry.  When tetryl is detonated, it reacts in very
much the same way as TNT.


	-How to Make TNT-

  Probably the most inportant explosive compound in use today is TNT
(trinitrotoluene).  This and other types of high explosives are all used by the
military, because of their fantastic power--about 2.25 million pounds per square
inch, and their great stability.TNT also has the great advantage of being able
to be melted at 82 degrees F., so that it can be poured into shells, mortars,
and any other projectiles.  Military TNT comes in containers which resemble
dry-cell batteries, and are usually ignited by an electrical charge, coupled
with an electrical blasting cap, although there are different methods.

	Preparation of TNT:

  1.  take two beakers.  In the first, prepare a solution of 76 percent sulferic
acid (battery acid), 23 percent nitric acid, and 1 percent water.  In the other
beaker, prepare another solution of 57 percent nitric acid and 43 percent
sulferic acid (percentages on a weight ratio rather than volume).

  2.  Ten grams of the first solution are poured into an empty beaker and placed
in an ice bath.

  3.  Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.

  4.  Remove thebeaker from the ice bath and gently heat it untill it reaches 50
degrees C.  The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.

  5.  Fifty additional grams of the acid, from the first beaker, are added and
the temperature is allowed to rise to 55 degrees C.  This temperature is heald
for the next ten minutes, and an oily liquid will begin to form on the top of
the acid.

  6.  After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath, and
cooled to 45 degrees C.  When reaching this temperature, the oily liquid will
sink to the bottom of the beaker.  At this point, the remaining acid should be
drawn off, by using a syringe.

  7.  Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid
while the temperature is *slowly* being raised to 83 Degrees C.  After this
temperature is reached, it is maintained for a whole half hour.

  8.  At the end of this period, the solution should be allowed to cool to 60
degrees C., and is heald at this temperature for another full half hour.  After
this, the acid is again drawn off, leaving only the oily liquid at the bottom.

  9.  Thirty grams of sulferic acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently
heated to 80 degrees C.  All temperature increases must be accomplished slowly
and gently.

  10.  Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second solution
of acid are added, and the temperature is raised from 80 degrees C to 104
degrees C., and is heald for three hours.

  11.  After this three hour period, the mixture is lowered to 100 degrees C.
and is held there for a half an hour.

  12.  after this half hour, the oil is removed from the acid and washed with
boiling water.

  13.  After the washing with boiling water, while being stirred constantly, the
TNT will begin to solidify.

  14.  When the solidification has started, cold water is added to the beaker,
so that the TNT will form into pellets.  Once this is done, you have a good
quality of TNT.

  ***NOTE***:  the temperatures used in this preperation of TNT are exact, and
must be used as such.Do not estimate or use approximations.  Buy a good
centigrade thermometer.
