   Have you ever tried to make a bomb, something that actually goes BOOM!?
Then find out that it only flares up?  The Destructor is a simple yet powerful 
bomb to make, using general components found at most hobby stores.
   
   The following is all you need to make one Destructor:

1 CO2 Cartridge - Used in BB guns - come in a pack of five - Target sells em 
                  for $1.50 a pack.

2 Size D Estes model rocket engines - found in most hobby stores where model
                                      rockets are sold. (Any size will work but
                                      D's have the most powder)

2 Solar ignitors - usually come with the engines - used to ignite the bomb

1 Bottle of fastdrying model glue 

1 Scissors

1 Funnel

1 roll of masking tape

1 hammer

1 container (jar, cup, glass)

1 20 foot wire (+ and -)

1 6 volt (or 12 volt) lantern battery

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Procedure:

 The CO2 cartridge is the body of the bomb and when it explodes will fragment 
scraple.. so stand back..  Metal flies!!

 If you have a CO2 BB gun then you will have many empty cartridges. For those 
of you who have never bought CO2 cartridges you will have to find some other 
way of emptying them. I have done this on accident before, simply insert a nail
in the top of the cartridge and watch the CO2 gas come out!! Very cold if you 
let it touch you. I do not suggest doing it this way, so if possible, ask a 
friend who has a CO2 BB gun for their empty CO2 cartridges.  

                              Make the hole bigger:
 Once you have an empty cartridge you have to make the hole bigger, otherwise 
it is very difficult to get the explosive compounds into the cartridge. Take a 
nail and pound the hole bigger. The size of the hole is very important. If it 
is too big the cartridge will act as a rocket instead of a bomb. 

                      Prepare the explosive ingrediants: 
Unroll the model rocket engines with a pocket knife, until you have the black 
chunck of boosting compound. Throw away the unrolling paper. You may remove the
block of clay since this is not explosive. Powder the chunk with the hammer 
until you have fine powder. To make the fine powder, lay down some wax paper 
on the floor. Find a screen mesh, and filter the powder, leaving the big pieces 
on top and the fine powder on the wax paper. Then pour the powder on the wax 
paper into a container. After you have the two size D engines powdered and in 
the container you are ready to put the powder into the CO2 cartridge. 

                     Get the ingrediants in the cartridge:
 Make a funnel out of paper (a floppy disk jacket works well, with the end 
clipped off) and tape it around the end of the cartridge. Slowly pour the 
powder from the container into the funnel. You may have to use a toothpick to 
help the powder through the funnel and into the cartridge. If your powder is 
not fine enough it might jam in the hole and you will have to remove the funnel 
and clear the passage. Shake the cartridge every so often until you can't hear 
the powder in there. The cartridge is now full of explosive powder.

                              Prepare the ignitor:
 Clip the paper protector of the ignitor with a scissors and bend the wires so 
they are relatively straight. (Be careful not to break the ignitor when bending 
the wires) Coat the ignitor with glue except for the ends, and let it dry for a 
few minutes. Then insert the ignitor into the cartridge leaving the ends 
exposed. The tip of the ignitor must touch the powder for the powder to ignite. 
This should be no problem if you have enough powder in the cartridge. Put glue 
around the ignitor and the tip of the cartridge and let dry. 

                              Connecting the bomb:
 Then bend the end wires of the ignitor and connect to your 20 foot wire.
Put tape around the end wires and cartridge. The Destructor is now ready to 
detonate. 
                              Detonating the bomb:
 When you have found a place to detonate The Destructor, stretch the 
wire the full 20 feet and then touch both wires to the two negative and postive 
connectors. This will send a 6 volt charge through the wire and to the ignitor.
The ignitor will ignite the explosive compounds in the cartridge and in a 
matter of seconds........   BOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 There are many, many uses for The Destructor and I'm sure you have one..

Detonating it under water and watch the fish float to the top. (It actually 
does explode under water, if ya put enuff tape around it)

Putting it in someones mailbox..  hehe..

Putting it in a glass jar and watch the glass fly 50 feet up in the air.

Burying it a foot under ground and watch the sand and rocks fly 50 feet up in 
the air. (hand grenade simulation) heh..

Lowering it into a manhole and hear it echo all over the city.. manholes 
actually jump up from the force..
