      The process I am about to describe is called Oleoresin.
 The compuond I am about to describe is called Oleoresid Capsicum.

      First, get some red pepper seeds, you can find them in a food
store or in a nursery for plants.  You will need 4 ounces of them.
     The next step is to grind them up in a blender or in a mortar
 
     Put the seeds into a coffe percolator with 16 ounces of distilled
 alcohol and percolate for 1/2 hour.
 
    After the 1/2 hour is up, you remove the alcohol liquid and what you
 have left if a couple table spoons of red liquid.
    The red liquid is added to 1/2 pint of mineral oil. You can get
mineral oil at any drug store.  Once mixed, you have one nasty eye
 irritant!

      The way you use it is to put in a spray bottle and spray
 it on your favorite enemy, or whatever!!! You could use the
 top from a Windex bottle, cut the tube short enough and put it
 in a medicine bottle. That way it is smaller.
