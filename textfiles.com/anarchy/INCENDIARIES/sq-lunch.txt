 \______________/          version 1.0                  

This is probably not the best rocketlauncher ever made,
but I hope it will work properly and don't blow you
apart. =)

You need:
 Big pipe, anykind of pipe you find suitable.
    preferrably plastic but drainpipe might work.
 Pipe cap that fits the pipe very good.
 Tiny vent that fits your gas can. (lighter)
 Alot of gas cans that fits your vent. (alround gas 
    for lighters)
 Spark plug.
 Battery to the spark plug.
 Switch, the kind that pops back when you release it.
 Cables.
 Strong tape.
 Something to fire with the same diameter as the pipe.
    (that fits exactly in the pipe!)
[Something small that stops the projectile from sliding]
[   over to the end of the pipe.                       ]
 Drill with two drills, one the same diameter as the vent
    and the other as the spark plug.
 Epoxy glue.

About the pipe
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
* It should be quite thick so it woun't break.
* It should still be light enough to carry. (and aim)
* It should not be to wide, becuse it will take longer time
  to reload. I think 5 cm would be good.
* It shold not be to short, atleast 1 meter.
* The ammo must fit very tightly in the pipe.

The construction
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
First, take the pipe and drill two holes in it, one for the
vent and the other for the spark plug. I think it would be best
if you put the refill hole (vent) on the top within 5 cm of
the back edge, and the spark plug hole on the pipe cap.
Screw the cap on the pipe and glue so it will stay in place.
Put the spark plug in the hole you made for it and glue well
with epoxy. Mount the vent in its hole.
Make the following circuit:

---
  I             _
  I +-----------o------ (+)
 <==I
  | +------------------ (-)
  |
---

<==I         Spark plug mounted in pipe
- or +       Cable
(+) and (-)  Battery poles
  _
--o--        Switch

You can attach the electronics to the pipe with some tape.
Let the glue dry.
Now you can try it by filling it with some gas and then
pressing your button and the gas should go <POFF!>
(Swedish sound) and you can see some flames (don't put your
face above the nozzle when firing)
If you want to, you can attach a small plastic or metal piece
inside the pipe that prevents the ammo from blocking the vent.

                        VENT

                            I
----------------------------

You can also make grips on the pipe or something else that
stops it from flying away when fired. =)
