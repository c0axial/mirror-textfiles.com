Dear Camdyman,
	I have figured out how to take apart a shotgun shell I will 
show you how later in the letter so people who nead it can use it!!
I would like to take back what I have said it the last 2 or 3 letters
about the sale of explosives. I dont support that and now wont take in 
anypart of selling thanx candyman.

How to take apart a shotgun shell without loseing a hand or so!!

materials>>
Shotgun shell 12gage or 21gage
A Sheet of paper
and Two Cups!>

Procedure:

-Put the ShootGun shell in the center of the paper.
take the knife and cut through the ShootGun shell about one cenameter
from the top end. It will look like this.

          | _____|___________:__]
          |   |             Cut across this{ : }
              |
            metal
       

NOW LISSEN UP THIS IS IMPORTANT!!!
If you are useing a 12gage there WILL NOT BE ANY WHITE POUDER IN THE 
SECTION YOU JUST CUT!! But if you are using a 21gage there will be 
a type of white gunpouder in the section you just cut so cut carefuly!!
You CAN use the pouder for whatever!!

For the 21 just put the pouder away for now in a plastic bag!!

-then take out the round sheets of wadding if you see them.
-Then you take out the iron balls! IF you are using a 12gage
there will be 50 or so small balls!! {ouch}  If it's a 21gage
then there will be six big iron ball. [now that's painful!!]

-Next you will want to make another cut right befor the metal peice
then take out the wadding again from the metal part and there will
be a huge batch of small balls of gunpouder!! or a finely grained
batch of gunpouder {VAREYS WITH THE TYPE OF SHELL}then put the  
gunpouder in one of the empty cup and if your smart you will know     
not to play with the littel round thing sticking out the
back of the shell!!! **SHESH**  
     
Ok with the shit of a shell left you can put it in a plastic bag or 
the cup and burry it toss it in a river or come up with something 
to do with it just rember if you hit the back end after you are done
IT CAN STILL GO OFF!!

Thanx for lissning I have done this and it is safe BUT I dont sugest
you try this because I am not responible for what mite happen if you
get caught or blow your fuckin hand off!!  

so have phunn..
