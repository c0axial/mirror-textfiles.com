Doorstop Bomb
-------------

        Take a .22 caliber bullet and remove the lead. Pack a wad of paper
        in the open cavity and make sure that the gunpowder is still firmly
        packed in place. Now, take a BB and tape it to the firing cap.  Go
        to the door stop (the spring kind with the rubber tip work great!)
        and remove the rubber cap and slip the shell into the hole in the
        center of the spring. Pack it in there tightly, wrap tape around the
        shell if it does not fit snuggly}~PNext, replace the rubber cap if you
        can. You want the end with the BB taped to it sticking out of the
        stopper. When someone opens the door into the stopper, bam! You can
        leave the lead in the shell if you wanna risk killing the victim or
        an innocent bystander.


Flashbulb Fun
-------------

        If you take a flashcube and pull out the little bulbs in it, you will
        discover that when you smash the little power suckers, they go off!
        They are real hot too! Just about hot enough to be an igniter.
        Try taping one to a doorstop with a fuse of your favorite pyrotechnic
        taped to it. Try taping one to the inside of a gas pump "Holster",
        if you wish. Just make sure that the bulb will get a good smack and
        it will go off. Don't try it in your hands or anything like that
        because the magnesium in the bulb will burn the living hell out of
        you.


House Bomb
----------

        O.K. so this one is really sick. Go into the home of your victim
        and tape or superglue a couple of kitchen matches to the bottom
        of the door so that the tips will drag on the ground. Now tape or
        glue some light grit sanding paper or emery cloth to the floor in
        the path of the oncoming matches. That was easy, now you go around the
        house and put out the pilot lights and crank up the gas. Get em all
        out first or you may be part of the bomb. Now, get out of the house
        before you sufficate! Stop!! DON'T USE THE SAME DOOR TO LEAVE!!!!
        O.K. you can sit back and wait for the bar-b-que family to get home
        and watch the fireworks or you can move away to the nearest friendly
        neighboring country. If you do decide to stay, don't stand too close,
        or you may end up a tater tot.


Wimp Startler
-------------

        Simple, cheap, safe. Blow up a clear balloon inside of a light fixture
        so that it touches the lightbulb. If possible, have it on top of the
        bulb because heat rises and will pop the balloon sooner (before the
        geek says, "Gee, its kinda not as bright as it used to be." When the
        light goes on, the balloon goes off. Nothing great but you won't go
        to jail for it.


Light Igniter
------------

        If you smash even a burned out light bulb and twist the ends of the
        element together, it makes a beauty of a starter for any fire needed
        explosion device. Just tape on the old fuse and leave.


Starter Startler
---------------

        You can take a wire and run it from the coil in your pals car to the
        steering wheel (if it's metal) or to the ignition key slot. When quizmo
        goes to start his car- buzzzzzzzzzzzzzap! Nothing like smoking fingers!
        This one has interesting side effects on pace maker patients.


Party Balloom
-------------

        Before your next party where smoking and drinking will occur (I do so
        hate cigarette smoke), fill up a few balloms with natural gas from the
        stove or bar-b-que. When you pals (or enemies) get loaded and start
        popping the ballons, like they always will. Some dork will decide to
        pop a few with his stogey. If all goes well, one of them might give him
        a little surprise.


Auto Annihilator
----------------

        You owners of pick up trucks are already in possesion of urban assault
        vehicles. All you need is some nice size rollable objects, some cord,
        and some duct tape. Tape over the latch that hold the tailgate shut.
        Tie a cord from the inside of the cab to the tailgate to hold it
        closed. Now, put a bowling ball, shopping cart, tire, large diameter
        steel pipe, etc. in the bed of the truck. It must be large enough to
        roll over the gap between the tailgate and the bed. So now your
        cruising along the interstate at 65mph and some prick pisses you off.
        Just pull ahead of him, floor it, and release the tailgate cord.
        Now look in the rearview mirror. Where is the asshole? Oh, that's him
        spinning out of control with a grocery cart stuck in his grill. Or
        is that him over there in the ditch along side of the road. No!
        wait! that's him speeding up to catch you! No problem. You were smart
        enough to have a few more goodies tied to another cord, like a bowling
        ball. Let her rip! Wham! Yeah, that's him with the broken steering
        rods smashing into the divider. I knew he was back there somewhere.
        Try it going up a steep hill or a bridge to take out more happy
        motorists.


Flare Fun
---------

        Take the glass off of a light bulb and fill it with the yellow
        make from grinding up the inside of a road flare. Tape the glass
        back on and screw it back into the socket. Give a new meaning to
        the "Red Light" district.


Non-Handymans Bomb
------------------

        Go to the nearest auto parts store and pick up a pack of road flares
        and an aerosol can of starter fluid. Take the flare and duct tape it
        to the can so that the first inch or so of the flare will burn with
        out touching the side of the can. When you wanna blow it up, use the
        handy little scratch-n-start piece of the flare and let it blow.
        Not too difficult, eh?


Fun With Cyano
--------------

        You call it superglue, we call it fun. Any Cyanoacrilate glue will
        do the job. It is the best prankster material ever produced by a
        manufacturer. Here are a few ideas to get you started. Glue the door
        to the school shut. Glue car doors, car locks, and car trunks. Glue
        money to the floor at the mall. On a busy day at the mall, put some on
        a coin and roll it infront of some lozers. It won't dry until it hits
        their skin because it needs moisture to dry. Spill some on your enemies
        pants. Glue the dictionary shut. Glue books to the table at t8e#
          library. Glue windsheild wipers down. Glue gaps caps on. The
        possibilities are endless. Cyano takes a while to dry on metal
        surfaces. When you put a few drops of cyano in baking soda or on saw
        dust, it turns to a rock hard substance. Fill the desired spot with
        the powder, and apply as much glue as necessary.
