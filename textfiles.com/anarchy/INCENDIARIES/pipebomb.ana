Assembly
^^^^^^^^

1)  Place pipe in a machinest vise and with drill, drill a 1/2 inch hole in
    the center of the pipe.

2)  Screw a pipe cap onto the pipe and fasten tightly.

3)  Insert electrical fuse into the 1/2 inch hole.

4)  Place pipe upright with cap on bottom and fill with the gunpowder.

5)  Wrap tape around fuse and pipe a couple of times to keep the fuse in place.

6)  Stuff a wad of paper into the extra cap for packing the powder into the
    pipe tight to make a better explosion.

7)  Pack the gunpowder by hand first and put in more gunpowder if needed and
    then screw the cap with the paper in it on the pipe for even more packing.

8)  Antipersonal device is ready for planting and detonation.

Planting
^^^^^^^^

1)  Tape pipe bomb inside of a tire on a car.  This works especially well on a
    teachers car that you do not like at school.

2)  Run one alligator clamp from the fuse to the starter terminal to make a hot
    wire running between them.

3)  Run Second alligator clamp from the other wire of the fuse to any ground to
    the car like the axilor springs.


Should look a little like this: (note: I am no artist.)

Don't forget the wires between the starter and bomb fuse and the ground.

Detonation
^^^^^^^^^^

All there is left is the detonation of the bomb.  When the unexpected victim
goes to start his car, the electrical charge coming through the starter will
set off the bomb and blow the tire to smithereens.
