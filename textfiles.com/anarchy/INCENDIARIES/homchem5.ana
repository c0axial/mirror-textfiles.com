                              ------------

  "In Unconventional Warfare operations it may be impossible to use
cnventional military munitions... It may be necessary instead to
fbricate the required munitions froe locally available materials...
Te purpose of this Manual is to increase the potential of Special
Frces and querrilla troops by describing in detail the manufacture of
mnitions from seemingly innocuous locally available materials."

  "Each item was evaluated both theoretically and experimentally to
ae saftey and reliability... Saftey warnings are prominently 
iserted in the procedures where they apply but it is emphasized that
SFTEY IS A MATTER OF ATTITUDE."

                       SECTION I:  EXPLOSIVES             
---------------------------------------------------------------------

LTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER -- This explosive can be detonated with
                           commercial #8 blasting cap.

TRIALS:
--------
 tassium Chlorate
 etroleum Jelly (Vaseline)
 ound stick or rolling pin
 ontainer for mixing ingredients

REDURE:
---------

 pread Potassium Chlorate crystals on a hard surface. Roll round
   stick over crystals to crush into find powder until it looks
   roughly like wheat flower.

)Place 9 parts powdered potassium chlorate and 1 part petroleum
   jelly in mixing container. Mix ingredients with hands (knead)
   until a uniform paste is obtained.

o: Store in a waterproof container until ready to use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

OSSIUM NITRATE -- Potassium nitrate can be extracted from many
                    natural sources and can be used to make nitric
                    acid, black powder, and other pyrotechnics.

ARIALS:
---------
 trate bearing earth ( fertile soil containing decayed matter, dirt
  from burial grounds, etc..), about 3-1/2 gallons.
 ine wood ashes, about 1/2 cup
 ucket, 5 gallon or so
  pieces cloth larger than bottom of bucket
 allow pan at least as large as bottom of bucket
 hallow heat resistant container
 ater, 1-3/4 gallons
 wl or screwdriver
  gallon alcohol (rubbing alcohol is ok)
 eat source, Paper, Tape

PCEDURE:
---------

 unch holes in bottom of bucket. Spread one piece of cloth over
   holes inside of bucket.

)Place wood ashes on cloth and spread to make a layer about the
   thickness of the cloth. Place second piece of cloth on top of the
   ashes.

)Place dirt in bucket.

)Place bucket over shallow container. Bucket may be supported on
  sticks.

)Boil water and pour it over dirt in bucket a little at a time.
   Allow water to run through holes in bucket into shallow container.
   Be sure water goes through ALL of the dirt. Allow drained liquid
   to cool and settle for 1 to 2 hours.

)Drain liquid into heat resistant container. Discard any sludge in
   bottom of container.

)Boil mixture over fire for at least 2 hours. Small grains of salt
   will begin to appear in the solution. Scoop these out as they 
 form, using any type of improvised strainer (paper, etc.).

)When liquid has boiled down to half its original volume, remove
   from fire and let sit. After half an hour add an equal volume of
   alcohol. When mixture is poured through paper, small white
   crystals (potassium nitrate) will collect on top of it.

)To purify the potassium nitrate, re-desolve the dry crystals in
   the smallest possible amount of water. Remove any salt crystals
   that appear (step 7); pour through filter and evaporate or gently
 heat the concentrated solution to dryness.

0 Spread crystals on flat surface and allow to dry. The crystals
    are now ready for use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

MOVISED BLACK POWDER -- Black powder can be made in a simple, safe
                          manner. It can be used as blasting or gun
                          powder.

ARIALS:
---------
 tassium Nitrate, Granulated, 3 Cups (see above)
 ood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups
 ulfur, powdered, 1/2 cup
 lcohol, 5 pints (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc)
 ater, 3 cups
 eat source
 buckets, 2 gallons each, one of which is heat resistant
 lat window screening, 1 foot square
 arge wooden stick
 loth, 2 feet square

REDURE:
--------

)Place alcohol in one of the buckets

)Place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfer in the heat
   resistant bucket. Add 1 cup water & mix thoroughly with stick
   until all ingredients are dissolved.

)Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture. Place bucket on heat
   source and stir until small bubbles begin to form.

TN: Don't boil mixture. Be sure ALL mixture stays wet. If any is
        dry it may ignite!!

)Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while 
   stirring vigorously.

)Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through
   cloth to obtain black powder. Discard liquid. Wrap cloth around
   black powder and squeeze to remove all excess liquid.

)Place screening over dry bucket. Place workable abount of damp
   powder on screen and qranulate by rubbing solid through screen.

T If granulated particles appear to stick together and change
     shape, recombine entire bach of powder and repeat steps 5 & 6.

)Spread granulated black powder on flat dry surface so that layer
   about 1/2 inch is formed. Allow to dry. Use radiator or direct
   sunlight. This should be dried as soon as possible, preferably
   in one hour. The longer the drying period, the less effective
   the black powder.

AION: Remove from heat AS SOON AS granules are dry. Black powder
       is now ready for use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

IIC ACID -- Nitric acid is used in the preperation of many explo-
              sives, incendiary mixtures, and acid delay timers.

ARIALS:
---------
 parts Potassium Nitrate, see above for improvised P.N.
  part CONCENTRATED sulfuric acid (from car battery)
  bottles or ceramic jugs, narrow necks are preferable
 rying pan
 eat source
 pe (paper, electrical, masking, ect..but not cellophane!)
 aper or rags

PTANT: If sulfuric acid is obatined from car battery, concetrate
          it by boiling until white fumes appear. Don't inhale
          the fumes!!

REDURE:
---------

 lace dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug. Add sulfuric acid.
   Do not fill bottle more than 1/4 full. Mix until paste if formed.

AION: Sulfuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing. Fumes are
        also dangerous and shouldn't be inhaled.

)Wrap paper or rags around the necks of two bottles. Securely tape
   necks of bottles together. Be sure bottles are flush against
  each other and that there are no air spaces.

)Support bottles on rocks or cans so that the empty bottle is
   SLIGHTLY lower than the bottle containing paster so that the
   nitric acid that is formed in recieving bottle will not flow into
   other bottle.

)Build fire in frying pan.

)Gently heat bottle containing mixture by moving fire back and
   forth underneath the bottle. As red fumes appear periodically
   pour cool water over empty recieving bottle. Nitric acid will
  begin to form in the recieving bottle.

AION: Don't overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may
        shatter. As an added precaution place the bottle to be
        heated in a can filled with sand or gravel. Heat the outer
        container to make nitric acid.

)Continue above process until no more red fumes are formed. If 
   the nitric acid formed in the recieving bottle is cloudy pour
   it into cleaned bottle and repeat steps 2-6.

AION: Nitric acid should be kept away from all combustibles and
       should be kept in a sealed ceramic or glass container.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

EILIZER EXPLOSIVE -- An explosive can be made from fertilizer grade
                       ammonium nitrate and either fuel or moter oil
