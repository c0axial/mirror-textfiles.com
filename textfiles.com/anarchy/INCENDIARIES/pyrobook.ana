HOW TO MAKE GREEK FIRE
----------------------

   1 parts  sulfur (live)
   2 parts  charcoal (of willow)
   6 parts  saltpetre (potassium nitrate)

  Grind each element into a fine powder SEPERATLEY with a mortar and mix.

  When lit and thrown flaming, it carries the flame wherever it goes and
splatters fire where it lands.

  The Greeks used this to win war at sea.  The enemy had never seen anything
like it and eventually perished.

HOW TO MAKE GUN PROPELLANT
--------------------------

   1.0 parts  sulfur
   1.5 parts  charcoal (carbon)
   7.5 parts  saltpetre (potassium nitrate)

(Looks farmiliar...)
As with Greek Fire, it is ground seperately and mixed.

This formulae produces Gun Propellant that burns at 1312 feet per second.
Or 400 meters per second if you think in metric.

MERCURY FULMINATES
------------------

  Mercury Fulminate is a medium-power explosive that is commonly used in
blasting caps, detonating devices in general, and as a stand-alone explosive.

  All fulminates, including mercury fulminate, are sensitive to shock and
friction, and in no circumstances should they be handled in a rough or careless
manner.

MERCURY FULMINATE #1 (Shock Bomb)
---------------------------------

  Shock Bombs, or more properly, fulminate of mercury [Hg(ONC)2], are bombs that
explode when jolted in any way, such as landing on someone's feet or shot from a
distance with a BB gun.

  Add mercury (found in thermometers and strange gadgets at Radio Shack) to
nitric acid (chemicals catalogs).  DON'T TOUCH THE MERCURY.  Now CAREFULLY add
alcohol (rubbing alcohol or anything:  drug or grocery store) to the mixture and
voila!	Instant Shock Bomb.

  I reccomend ripping the top off of a Coke can and stuffing a paper towel in to
make it less likely to blow up when you don't want.  GENTLY transfer the mixture
to the Coke can and, if you want, it with another can to make it look more
innocent.

  Now place it somewhere and throw a rock at it, shoot it with a wristrocket or
BB gun and BOOM!

MERCURY FULMINATE #2
--------------------

[-1-]	Take 5 grams of pure mercury and mix it with 35 ml. of nitric acid.

[-2-]	The mixture is slowly and gently heated.  As soon as the solution
	bubbles and turns green, one knows that the silver mercury is
	dissolved.

[-3-]	After it is dissolved, the solution should be poured, slowly, into
	a small flask of ethyl alcohol.  This will result in red fumes.

[-4-]	After a half hour or so, the red fumes will turn white, indicating
	that the process is nearing its final stage.

[-5-]	After a few minutes, add distilled water to the solution.

[-6-]	The entire solution is now filtered, in order to obtain the small
	white crystals.  These crystals are pure mercury fulminate, but should
	be washed many times, and tested with litmus paper for any remaining
	undesirable acid.

MERCURY FULMINATE #3
--------------------

[-1-]	Mix one part mercuric oxide with ten parts ammonia solution.  When
	ratios are described, they are always done according to weight
	rather than volume.

[-2-]	After waiting eight to ten days, one will see that the mercuric oxide
	has reacted with the ammonia solution to produce the white fulminate
	crystals.

[-3-]	These crystals must be handled in the same way as Method #2 above, in
	that they must be washed many times and given several litmus paper
	tests.

HOW TO MAKE A HIGH SCHOOL BOMB
------------------------------

  I wouldn't know about this but the local newspaper reported a story on a car
being totaled and a lady suffering serious burns on her torso after it exploded
in her lap on the 4th of July.	Anyway they reported the formula used...  Easy.

  Add clorine to brake fluid in a glass bottle and run.

  Don't ask why it's called a high school bomb, that's just what friends of mine
who already knew about it called it.

CONVERTING A SHOTGUN INTO A GERNADE LAUNCHER
--------------------------------------------

  A 12- or 16-gauge shotgun is propped up with a set of folding legs, so as to
form a tripod, with the butt of the gun being the third leg at about a 45-
degree angle.  The angle can be varied, for aiming, by moving the legs back and
forth.	To build a grenade launcher, one must take an open shell and remove all
the shot.  Once this is done, replace it with a smooth cylindrical stick, which
has been cut down to a close fit.  When the shell is loaded into the gun, the
stick should extend out the muzzle of the gun.	To the extended portion, a flat
rubber base should be fixed and a "Molotov Cocktail" placed on it.  This will
send the burning bottles over a hundred yards with a good deal of accuracy.
This is a good weapon for encirclement.

HOW TO MAKE A GOOD MOLOTOV COCKTAIL
-----------------------------------

  A "Molotov Cocktail" is a bottle filled with a flammable liquid such as
gasoline, mixed with oil or soap powder to thicken it.	A fuse, usally a rag
soaked in gasoline, it attached to the cork, lit, and thrown.  The bottle breaks
on contact with another hard object, and the gasoline ignites, causing a burst
of flame.  These were used with a great degree of success in Hungary, against
things as big as tanks.

HOW TO MAKE A HOMEMADE GRENADE
------------------------------

Parts:

  5- to 6-Second Fuse (see to Pyro Book II)
  Cardboard Tube (cardboard mailer at post office (best), or paper towel roll)
  Iron Scraps (found at any machine shop, tell them its to fill a punching bag)
  Non-electric Blasting Cap (use mercury fulminate above)
  TNT (I could tell you but someone else already has.  Find it.)
  Wooden Handle (any hardware store or hobby shop sells dowels)

FORMULAS FOR AMMONIUM NITRATE COMPOUNDS
---------------------------------------

  Here are fifty-six formulas for ammonium nitrate compounds.  Ammonium nitrate
is a neat explosive that can be detonated with almost anything.

  There are two reasons for listing all fifty-six compunds.  First, they are all
different and, reasonably enough, all blow differently (some are more powerful,
alt`ough I have not tried all 56).  Some require more care than others too.
Secondly, you may not have all the materials for one, but you might have all you
need for the another.

  Enough talk.	Here they are.	All ratios are according to weight, not volume.


`1)  ammonium nitrate	60		 2)  ammonium nitrate	34
     potassium nitrate	29.5		     pota~sium nitrate	34
