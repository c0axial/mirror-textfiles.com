         Chapter Two: DESTRUCTION
         =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

           Ahhh, there's nothin' like a good hour of destruction
         to  releave all  that tension after  failing yer math  exam.
         Yeah you remember, the one you were supposed to be  studying
         for while you  were mixing  explosives in  the garage.  This
         form of Anarchy  allows for more  creativity than most.  You
         can stck to  doing mild  damage with  yer hands  or you  can
         obtain a wide variety of weapons for more severe effects. It
         is usually easier to  make yer own weapons  and there are  a
         large number  of G-phyles  dealing  with the  production  of
         explosives and simple  weapons. For a  successful strike  on
         your target area, you will need the following:

         o Camouflage (dark clothing, mask)-   To prevent discovery
                                               & Identification

         o A small bat or solid stick/bar  -   To eliminate peo-
                                               ple/dogs who get in
                                               the way & to increase
                                               destructive power

         o A small, "efficient" weapon     -   For serious emergen-
                                               cies only!
                                               (knives or mini-
                                               chucks are good)

         o Flashlight                      -  So you can see what
                                              the phuck yer doin'

         o Several projectiles             -  To increase fire
                                              power and range
                                              ( rocks or anything
                                              will do )

         o Smoke Bombs                     -  A valuable tool,
                                              documented here after

         o FIRE                            -  .......... A  MUST!!!!

         o Explosives                      -  Not compulsary for the
                                              job but they sure
                                              add a spark to the
                                              evening!

         o Spray Paint                     -  To mark out yer
                                              territory & let the
                                              world know you were
                                              there.....
         o Lock Picks & a Bag              -  Just in case an easy
                                              target for theft
                                              presents itself while
                                              yer vandalizing.



             Now, in case you aren't up on the latest "do it yerself"
         weapons info. here are a few of my favourites.....

         Part A: Home-Made Weapons
         -------------------------

         Mini-Chucks
         -----------

            These little  babies  are easy  to  make and  are  easily
         concealable. All you  need are  a pair of  those metal  nut-
         crackers and a 2 foot length  of chain. First, take the  nut
         crackers and cut through the hinge with metal-shears,  being
         sure to leave the rivets intact.  Now open up the last  link
         at each end  of the chain  and close them  around the  rivet
         shaft  on   the   metal   bars.  HEY!   Look   what   you've
         done....little nun-chakaus.

         Tennis Ball Bombs
         -----------------

            This is  a  great idea  I  picked up  from  the  D.O.A.'s
         Anarchy Handbook. Cut a one inch slit in the tennis ball and
         stuff it  full of  wooden match-heads.  (A little  gunpowder
         adds to the effect) Once the ball is fimrly packed, it  will
         detonate on  contact with  a solid  surface pruducing  large
         amounts of flame and flaming projectiles.

         Flaming Darts/ Exploding Darts
         ------------------------------

            Take ordinary darts and wrap  an oil soaked strip of  rag
         around the shaft. Then just light and throw. For an  explod-
         ing dart, tie a cherry bomb  to the shaft using a twist  tie
         and light the fuse.

         Molocov Cocktail
         ----------------

            Fill a Pepsi bottle  half way to  the top with  gasoline,
         insert a rag, light and throw....instant hell fire!



         Part B: Interesting Ideas
         -------------------------

            Try out these nasty thoughts on yer local loser:


         Personalized  Lawns
         -------------------

            Sure! Why not leave yer  initials on the guys lawn  using
         gasoline or  weed-killer? Better  yet,  if yer  artistic,  a
         graphic picture of him pumping the local stray  dog.....heh,
         long-lasting damage!

         Hose Through The Mail Slot
         --------------------------

            Stick the end of the garden hose through the mail slot in
         his door, then crank  the fawset and run  like a fucker!  If
         you do this  at 3am,  his house  will be  floating down  the
         street before he even wakes up.


         Address Switching
         -----------------

            Use yer trusty screwdriver to switch address numbers  and
         steal mailboxes  throughout the  neighborhood. Heh,  if  you
         find the right numbers, you can  make three houses in a  row
         with the same  address, the phun  part is when  you order  a
         party-size pizza to that address. (If you are really on  the
         ball you can rip off the delivery car while Guido is walkin'
         from door to door).



         Part C: The Phun Part
         ---------------------

            Once you have all  yer equipment, yer  ready to go.  Easy
         targets are mail boxes, bird feeders, X-mas lights (when  in
         season) and greenhouses. The weapon you will use most is the
         bat or steel bar you brought along in yer trusty Anarchist's
         bag. Remember to spray  paint the traditional encircled  "A"
         where ever you go to let the world know Anarchy is alive an'
         well. If you posess a slight sadistic streak, domestic  pets
         can make amusing targets. The classic "cemeny shoes" is good
         to drown the neighboors cat in their pool. Fire can be  used
         in countless ways to destroy almost anything. The good  part
         is once you've set the fire,  it will continue to do  damage
         while you are  runnin' to the  next target. The  interesting
         thing is when you  are spotted and chased.  Now you have  to
         use some direct methods to evade capture. Start off mild  by
         simply running. If they persist, create obstacles as you  go
         by knocking things down in  yer wake, jumpin' fences,  cars,
         etc.. If that fails, try a  few smoke bombs lobbed over  yer
         shoulder to block their view....NO! Hmmmm well it's time  to
         get serious because  you smoke  too much to  stay ahead  for
         long. Sooo, use the explosives....that  should do it but  if
         not, just  turn  around, whip  out  the projectiles  or  the
         weapon of yer choice an' just  beat the livin' phuck out  of
         `em. Now  you can  go home,  being sure  to spray  paint  an
         encircled "A" on Mr.  Johnson's bleeding forehead...(heh,  I
         doubt he'll chase you next time)
