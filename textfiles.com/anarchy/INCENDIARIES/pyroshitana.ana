Part 1

                      How to make a "Shotgun grenade"

  When I lived back in the boonies of Va. I learned how to make a fire
  cracker that was almost as powerful as 2 m-80's! Here how to make
  it....

The stuff that you need is this...

1. Used Shotgun shell...most anygauge....but 12 gauge is better.... 2.
Some gunpowder... 3. A fuse....Water proof fuses are better... 4. Some
Elemers glue (Note: Use the stuff that dries clear...)

Ok after you have gotten all of that stuff you are ready to make one!

First step...Push the primer out with a 2 point screwdriver...(Phil.
Head) then throw the primer away and put the fuse through the hole...put
some glue in the hole to hold the fuse...let glue dry.....

Next step...pour gunpowder into the empty shell....

next step...pour glue into the rest of the last part of the shell...let
glue dry....then....**BOOM** Enjoy!

Note: These bombs are very dangerous and could easily kill you...just
watch yourself..also to make them more deadly...get some tape and some
nails and take the nails to the sides of the shell...and run like hell!
if this thing goes off....one of those nails could easily go through
you.....Enjoy!

Part 2


                   How to make an "Apple bomb"

Well this bomb is *Extreamly* dangerous we suggest you use a long
fuse... You will have fun with this one...... this one could easily
destroy a car...so watch out....

Supplies....

1. Applesause jar... 2. Gun powder.... 3. REALLY long fuse... 4. Nails
gor Anti-personel use....

Get a Apple sause jar and fill it with gun powder..... Put a hole in the
top of the cap.....Put the fuse through the cap and put a drop of glue
so to make it stay...if you want to waste a ton of shit by schrapnel
then tape nalis to the side of the GLASS jar....If explosion dont get
them the glass will...If the glass dont get them the NAILS
will.........I really suggest you use a long fuse..(Water proof) and run
like hell...becuase I know what these babys can do! Drop one in a pond
and run and after it explo des go back and collect the dead fish...Well
enjoy this one!



Part 3

Just look at parts 1 and 2 and follow the instrutions for making them
anti-personel....



Part 4

                           How to make Electric fuses...

Go down to A toy store and buy one of those little model launching
kits...use one of those...they work well...but you can only use them
once...because the wires het wasted after the shit explodes....If you
want to know how to make a timer get a Cigerette and light it and tie it
to the fuse to the point where the cigerette will start the fuse when
the "Cherry" burns down to the tip of the fuse and starts the fuse......
