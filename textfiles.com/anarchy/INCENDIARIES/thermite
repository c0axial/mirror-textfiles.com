      Thermite is a powerful substance which can burn through
 almost anything, even tungsten, and here is how to make it......

      First, you need hematite. Hematite is Iron Oxide, in rock form.
 If you don't want to buy it, you can make it by electrolizing a 
 nail. (An iron nail).
  to electrolyze the iron nail, place it in a jar of water which
 has a couple teaspoons of salt dissolved in it. Then, get a DC power
 source, like a train transformer, and attatch the positive wire to
 the nail, and attatch the negative wire to another nail and place that
 in the glass of water, as far from the positive nail as possible. Let
 this run overnight.

    While that is going, you have to get some Aluminum filings or
 Aluminum powder. You can get this by filing an Aluminum bar. You also
 might be able to find this at a hardware store. It is called Duralumin.
  If you choose to use the bar, it has to be more than 90% pure.
 (The bar method is easier and 90% is not hard to find.)

     In the morning, get the jar and you will see a dark, red shit in
 The glass of water. Filter the water through a coffe filter and 
 collect all the red stuff. This is RUST!! Throw the water away.
 Get an iron pot or pan and heat the red stuff until it is a
 light red and dry.

      When it is cool, mix the two together. There should be 8
 grams of rust to 3 grams of Aluminum, and that's thermite.
 
   Now, how to set it off.
    You must get a length of Magesium Ribbon. You have to put the
 Magnesium into the pile of thermite. The Magnesium is a kind of wick,
 which burns white hot!! You can get them from Chemical Supply houses.
     All you have to do is light the Magnesium. This
 can be done with a small torch like they sell at Radio Shack. The
 ribbon should be at least 9 inches long. You can try rocket wick,
 but it usually is not hot enough to set off the thermite.
 
     When the Magnesium burns down to the Thermite, it will ignite
 and burn the shit out of anything around it. KEEP BACK!!!  
 Thermite can vaporize Carbon Steel. Think what it would do 
 to your skin??     Fucking OUCH!!!!
