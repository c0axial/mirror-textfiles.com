ZoNE's Guide To Altering Fireworks                   01/25/90

     This phile has come from many, MANY Fourth Of July's
 
experiance...  All of the fireworks used in this text file
 
can be purchased at just about EVERY fireworks stand there
 
is..  C'mon...  You've all bought Ground Bloom Flowers,
 
Whisteling Petes, and Sparklers...  And I'm sure many of you
 
have boughten TOO many of them, so you just light them off
 
more than one at a time and paying little to no attention to
 
them.  Well, from now on, you'd better believe you're gonna
 
pay attention to them!  I mean, lighting a Ground Bloom
 
Flower and expecting it to spin around on the ground, and the
 
next thing you know, it launches straight up into the air,
 
and you will very rarely see it ever again...  Now that's
 
quite a sight!  So, I guess I'll get on with the file...

==========================
 
Part 1 - Sky Bloom Flowers
 
==========================
 
 
   Items Needed :
 
 
  1) Ground Bloom Flowers
 
  2) A Power Drill
 
  3) A Moderately Sized Bit
 
 
   Steps Taken:
 
 
  1) Take your Ground Bloom Flower, turn it upside down, and
 
     drill straight down the middle until you get roughly
 
     1/4 of an inch from the top.
 
 
  2) Get some matches, light it up, and run you pyromaniac
 
     ass off!
 
 
   What It SHOULD Do:
 
 
      What this should do is begin to spin and then take
 
flight.  It will fly so high, that you will not be able to
 
see it again.

Part 2 - Nigger Chasers
 
=======================
 
 
   Items Needed :
 
 
  1) 1 Whisteling Pete
 
 
   Steps Taken :
 
 
  1) Break about 1/4 of the end off (The side WITHOUT the
 
     fuse)
 
 
  2) Unwrap the paper surrounding the insides of it until
 
     there is very little left.
 
 
  3) Lay the baby down, light it, and watch the fucker go!
 
 
   What It SHOULD Do :
 
 
      What it should do is begin to move at a very fast rate
 
   in the direction you pointed the front of it.  After going
 
   in that direction for a little while, it will then turn
 
   and start going, basically, where ever the fuck it wants!
 
   And if you unrapped enough of it, it will even take
 
   flight!  So, I would recommend to keep your ass back!

Part 3 - Sparklers No More!
 
===========================
 
 
    Items Needed :
 
 
   1) About 15 Sparklers
 
   2) Electrical Tape
 
 
    Steps Taken :
 
 
   1) Get all your sparklers and hold them in your hand, then
 
      make a tight fist.
 
 
   2) While making the fist, beging to tape all the sparlers
 
      tightly together, leave about 1 inch un-taped at the
 
      top so you can light it.
 
 
   3) Once you have it tighly wrapped in tape, light the
 
      fucker! Ka-Ka-Ka-BOOOOM!!!
 
 
    What It SHOULD Do :
 
 
      What this should do, is once you light the 1 inch you
 
   left for a fuse, you run like hell...  Then, when the
 
   heat/sparks get under the tape, it starts being
 
   pressurized.  Once it get's far enough under the tape, it
 
   just says 'FUCK IT!' and blows up EVERYWHERE!  And you
 
   thought M-80's were loud...
