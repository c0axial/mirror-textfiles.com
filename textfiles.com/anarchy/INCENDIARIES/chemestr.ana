MATERIALS: CALCIUM CARBIDE, A TIN COKE CAN, RUBBER CEMENT, WATER, MEDIUM SIZED
TEST TUBE THAT WILL FIT COMFORTABLY WITHIN THE TIN CAN, A CORK WIDER THAN THE M

THIS WEEK WE'LL START WITH AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THE CARBIDE BOMB

WELL A CARBIDE BOMB CONSISTS OF A BASIC CHEMICALL REACTION BETWEEN CALCIUM CARB
IDE AND H2O. WELL FIRST GO TO ANY HARDWARE STORE AND BUY CALCIUM CARVIDE. THEY
SHOULD HAVE IT BECAUSE CARBIDE CAMPING LAMPS USE THE STUFF. THE STUFF SHOULD LO
OK LIKE SMALL PIECES OF GRAVEL. NOW YOU GO AND FIND SOME KIND TIN CAN AS IN A U
SED COKECAN... WELL DRINK THE COKE (BURP).... NOW PUT IN THE CALCIUM CARBIDE SO
 IT FILLS ABOUT 1/4 OF THE CAN... NOW GET A TEST TUBE. FILL THE TEST TUBE (MEDI
UM SIZE) FULL OF WATER. NOW PLACE THE TUBE INSIDE THE CAN THROUGH THE MOUTHPIEC
E. NOW YOU ARE FACED WITH AN OPEN MOUTH PIECE.. WELL MOST PEOPLE CAN'T FIND A P
ROPHANE TORCH TO MELT A PIECE OF METAL ON THE OPENING... SOO... WHAT YOU CAN DO
 IS TAKE A CORK LARGER THAN THE OPENING OF THE MOUTHPIECE. NOE TAKE A KNIFE AND
 ETCH IN A RING ABOUT 1/4 - 1/2 INCHES ABOVE THE SMALL END OF THE CORK. NOW CAR
FULLY WEDGE IN THE CORK (IT MAY TAKE A WHILE) INTO THE MOUTHPIECE. AFTER IT SLI
PS INTO THE WEDGE IN RING. LET IT SIT FOR A DAY SO IT SOMEWHAT RETRNS TO A BLOA
TED CORK.. OR TAKE A FEW( I EMPHASIZE FEW) DROPS OF WATER AND PLACE TEM ON HE C
ORK.. IF ANY WATER GETS IN YOU WILL HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY SEEING, WRITINMG, WAL
KING... THINGS LIE THAT. NOW TAKE RUBBER CEMENT AND PLACE IT AROUND THE CRACKS
BETWEEN THE CORK AND THE TIN CAN. LET THE GRENADE SETTLE TILL THE GLUE DRIES. N
OW YOUR READY TO GO... GET YOUR LITTLE SISTER OR ANYONE YOU HATE AND SA COME HE
RE LETS PLAY CATCH.. WELL THROUGH THE CAN MAKE SURE IT HITS THE GROUND NEXT TO
THE TARGET  VERY HARD.. SO THE TEST TUBE BREAKS.. NOW HOT GASES FORM ... PRESSU
RE BUILDS AND ( OHH NOO!)
			  BOOM!
