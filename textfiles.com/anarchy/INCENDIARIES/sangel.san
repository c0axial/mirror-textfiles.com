                           By:-+-NaTaS-+-

	Ho hum,and a bottle of rum,I am back with another release,well really
2 for SANctuary.Lets cut through cow and get to the beef.Well i guess you have
figured that this is about Gelled Soemthing.CAN YOU READ!!!,Its gelled gasoline
very nice and flammable so before i continue let me make these fine points.
	This author is not responsible for any actions the reader may take
upon reading this file,strictly INFORMATIONAL.If you do decide to try this.I
would suggest doing this in an area that is secluded,away from trees,and has
alot of concrete.Ok,thats about it now lets go.
	Ok,well we all know what gell is,and we all know what gasoloine is
at least I hope you do.If you dont,stop reading this file NOW and go flush
your head in el toilet.Well this is how to make gelled gasoline,several
diffrent ways,so pay attention.

Using Lye and Rosin Powder:
	You will need the following,so put this file away and go get it:
Gasoline,60 parts by volume,From your local station
Lye,2 Parts by voloume,Food and drug stores
Water,1 or 2 parts by voloume,Your faucet or use EVIAN (for you preppies)
Rosin Powder,15 Parts by volume,Food and Drug Stores

Measure the gasoline out and put it in a clean,dry container.DO NOT USE AN
ALUMINUM container!!!Break the rosin into small pieces and add to the gas.Stir
the mixture for about five minutes to mix up the rosin,in a seperate container,
dissolve the lye in the water,once again DO NOT USE AN ALUMNIUM Contaioner!!Add
the lye-water to the gasoline and stir until it all thickens.In one or two days
the stuff will thicken like butter,dont eat it,holy jeesheesh.And store until
you are ready to use.

Using Soap and Alcohol:
	Go gather up these items:
Gasoline,36 Parts by volume,your moms car
Ethyl Alcohol,1 Part by volume,Your local liquour stor,or local drunk
Laundry Soap,20 Powder parts by volume OR 28 flake parts by volume,your kitchen

Put the correct amount of gasoline in an container.Add the alcohol to the gas.
Then add the soap to the gasoline-alcohol mixture.Stir until it thickens up,
about 15 minutes.You are done,EASY.It will be like butter in 1 or 2 days,then
store till ready to use!!!

Eggs and Stuff
	This is a long list so go out and get this scuff:
Gasoline,85 parts,your car
Egg WHITES,14 parts,your kitchen

Then you can use one of these additives,olong with the above:
Table Salt,1 PArt
Leaf Tea,3 parts
Sugar,2 parts
Borax,2 parts
Saltpeter,1 part
Epsom Salt,1 part
Washing Soda,2 parts
Baking Soda,2 Parts
Asprin (crushed),2 parts

Seperate the eggs WHITES from the egg YOLKS.Sore the egg WHITES in your frezzer
until you are ready to use them.Now get the egg whites and put them in a
container,add gasoline,add table salt (or another additive) and stir until it
gets jelly lke,You MUST use this stuff within 24 hours,If you want it to be
thicker,reduce the volume of the gasoline,

Wasnt all that easy,sorry for the shortness but I gots school and seeing how it
is like 7 in the morning this will make do.There will be a delay on the other 
release seeing how something screwed terribly wrong and i have to re-test,if
you're ionterested the other file was a file on REMOTE DETONATION,using a
simple RC Plane Controller,Wekk thats about all,if you need help,want info
