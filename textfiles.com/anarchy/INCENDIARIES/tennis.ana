  ---------------------------------------------------    As we know, Tennis is
a popular sport around the world. In tennis you use these hollow round green
balls known as Tennis balls. What people do not know is that these wonderfull
little balls can used for other things(no not to jack off with). They can be
used as a handy explosive or noisemaker. You will need the following:       1.
A tennis ball (new if possible)       2. a knife       3. a box of matches
(the type that will strike on anything)       4. tape (strong) First you take
a knife and cut a small round hole on the tennis ball. Next you will cut off
the macth heads of each match and drop them into the hole until the tennis
ball is full of them. Make sure you do not drop the tennis ball because it
will not be too fun to stay in the hospital. Tape the hole up very well so
that it is air tight. Make a few of these and one day when a geek is walking
down the street or when you want to get a big bang or attention, throw the
ball. It is not too fun to be where the ball lands. To make the explosion more
powerfull, you can use gunpowder mixe[:%#CJ#1so. Have fun!!!!
