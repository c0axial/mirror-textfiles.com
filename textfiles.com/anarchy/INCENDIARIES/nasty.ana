    MISCELLANEOUS NASTIES FROM THE
    BOOK THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND
  BY KURT SAXON TYPED BY THE PENGUIN

FIREBOMBS:  MOST FIRE BOMBS ARE SIMPLY GASOLINE FILLED BOTTLES WITH A FUEL
  SOAKED RAG IN THE MOUTH (THE BOTTLE'S MOUTH, NOT YOURS).  THE ORIGINAL
  MOLOTOV COCKTAIL, AND STILL ABOUT THE BEST, WAS A MIXTURE OF ONE PART
  GASOLINE AND ONE PART MOTOR OIL.  THE OIL HELPS IT TO CLIMB TO WHAT IT
  SPLATTERS ON.  SOME USE ONE PART ROOFING TAR AND ONE PART GAS.  FIRE BOMBS
  HAVE BEEN FOUND WHICH WERE MADE BY POURING MELTED WAX INTO GAS.

NAPALM:  ABOUT THE BEST FIRE BOMB IS NAPALM.  IT HAS A THICK CONSISTANCY, LIKE
  JAM AND IS BEST FOR USE ON VEHICLES OR BUILDINGS.  NAPALMS ARE SIMPLY ONE
  PART GAS AND ONE PART SOAP.  THE SOAP IQ EITHER SOAP FLAKES OR SHREDDED BAR
  SOAP.  DETERGENTS ARE OUT.  THE GAS MUST BE HEATED IN ORDER FOR THE SOAP TO
  MELT.  THE USUAL WAY IS WITH A DOUBLE BOILER WHERE THE TOP PART HAS AT LEAST
  A TWO QUART CAPACITY.  THE WATER IN THE BOTTOM PART IS BROUGHT TO A BOIL AND
  THE DOUBLE BOILER IS TAKEN FROM THE STOVE AND CARRIED TO WHERE THERE IS NO
  FLAME.THEN ONE PART, BY VOLUME, OF GAS IS PUT IN THE TOP PART AND ALLOWED TO
  HEAT AS MUCH AS IT WILL AND THE SOAP IS ADDED AND THE MESS IS STIRRED UNTIL
  IT THICKENS.	A BETTER WAY TO HEAT GAS IS TO FILL A BATHTUB WITH WATER AS HOT
  AS YOU CAN GET IT.  IT WILL HOLD ITS HEAT LONGER AND PERMIT A MUCH LARGER
  CONTAINER THAN WILL THE DOUBLE BOILER.

MATCH HEAD BOMB:  SIMPLE SAFETY MATCH HEADS IN A PIPE, CAPPED AT BOTH ENDS,
  MAKE A DEVESTATING BOMB.  IT IS SET OFF WITH A REGULAR FUSE.	A PLASTIC
  BAGGIE IS PUT INTO THE PIPE BEFORE THE HEADS GO IN TO PREVENT DETONATION BY
  CONTACT WITH THE METAL.  CUTTING ENOUGH MATCH HEADS TO FILL THE PIPE CAN BE
  TEDIOUS WORK FOR ONE BUT AN EVENING'S FUN FOR THE FAMILY IF YOU CAN DRAG THEM
  AWAY FROM THE TV.

FUSE IGNITION FIRE BOMB:  A FOUR STRAND HOMEMADE FUSE IS USED FOR THIS.  IT
  BURNS LIKE FURY.  IT IS HELD DOWN AND CONCEALED BY A STRIP OF BENT TIN CUT
  FROM A CAN.  THE EXPOSED END OF THE FUSE IS DIPPED INTO THE FLARE IGNITER.
  TO USE THIS ONE, YOU LIGHT THE FUSE AND HOLD THE FIRE BOMB UNTIL THE FUSE HAS
  BURNED OUT OF SIGHT UNDER THE TIN.  THEN THROW IT AND WHEN IT BREAKS THE
  BURNING FUSE WILL IGNITE THE CONTENTS.
