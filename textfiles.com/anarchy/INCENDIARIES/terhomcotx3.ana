Dept. Store Fun
---------------

        Most department stores have those little clamp on deals that they stick
        on clothes to keep people from stealing them. Do what you must do to
        get one of these (a friend who is employed there, hold the place up,
        whatever). Find some lady with 3-5 kids, a stroller, a huge purse and
        lots of other stuff that would make her look suspicious. Stumble by and
        plant this little devices in one of her pockets and wait by the exit.
        when she walks out.. Bells! Cops! the works.. And to top it all off,
        one embarrased lady! Another way is to take the thing home and rip the
        little metal thing out of it (looks like a piece of card board with
        metal wrapped around it). Place it deep in your wallet or in your pants
        and wait around by the entrance. When you see the same type of person
        going out, you go in! Same effects. Only problem is, you have to get
        back out! I suggest just leaving the little prize on someone in the
        store and leaving (don't hang around, or do it at the same store twice,
        the Cops may get suspicious of you).

Street Fun
----------

        Take some fishing line and run it across the street. Next, hang rocks,
        bolts, sinkers, etc. at windshield level. Find a telephone pole or a
        tree to run it across on. Another thing to do is to use light string
        to tie 2 garbage cans together and run the string across the street.
        If you can't figure out what that does, you shouldn't be reading this
        file!

Bolt Bomb
---------

        Take a bolt, 2 washers, and 2 nuts. Screw on the first bolt, place a
        washer after it. Put gun powder on the washer, put the next washer on,
        and screw on the last nut so that the nut is hanging out past the end
        of the bolt and the 2 washers are pushed together. Drop the bolt on the
        bottom nut and it will explode. Nothing big, but it is re-usable. Kinda
        like the space shuttle. Uh, scratch that last part.

Spoke Gun
---------

        Take a bicycle spoke and that little nut that holds it onto the rim.
        Screw the spoke into the the nut a little bit. Powderize a match head
        and push it into the nut. Pack a wad of paper into the nut with another
        spoke. Hold the device from the end that doesn't have the screw on it
        and then hold a flame under the nut. When it gets hot enough, it will
        blow up and send the paper flying. This is small scale. If you wanted
        to, you could use a piece of threaded rod and a 1 1/2 inch long nut to
        make the results a little more interesting. You can even add your own
        projectiles. Just be sure that the paper is in tight enough to compact
        the powder.

Flour & Gas
-----------

        Take a new bag of ordinary household flour and pour gas on it. Light
        it and drop it off of something high onto a hard surface. No explosion,
        but it gives a nice efect. Kinda like an Atomic Bomb.

PineSol & Cl
------------

        Wrap some cholrine up in a paper towel and tie it up tight. Next, tape
        it high on the inside of a Mayonaise jar (See illus. 'A'). Fill the
        bottom of the jar up (don't touch the paper!) with PineSol. Screw the
        top back on and place it on the ground. When ready, knock the jar over
        and run like a bat out of hell (haul the mail, cruise, mobeelin', bust
        ass, do what you have to do, just get away!). It will explode, and
        release alot of chlorine gas. Don't breathe it in! It will kill you!

( illustration A )
                     /========\ <- Lid
                     |       *| <- Chlorine
                     |       *| <-
                     |        |
                     |'.'.'.'.| <- PineSol
                     |.'.'.'.'| <-
                     \________/ <-


Hefty Gas
---------

        Fill a hefty bag with gas from a gas stove. Tape a fuse to it and light         it. Have a book of matches at the end of the fuse to insure ignition.
        Woof! No more hefty bag! Or if you want to add some fun to it, forget
        the fuse and just shoot bottle rockets at it. Same effect.

Door Shock
----------

        For this, you will need a 12 volt transformer. Strip about 1 inch off
        of the end of each wire. Run the wires out of your bedroom door. Place
        some electrical tape on the bottom of the outside door knob and then
        tape the bare wires down so they won't touch. Disguise the wires so
        they won't look suspicious. Turn on the transformer and wait for a
        victim. This is the ultimate in privacy protection devices. Don't
        use more than 12 volts. You can kill somebody.
