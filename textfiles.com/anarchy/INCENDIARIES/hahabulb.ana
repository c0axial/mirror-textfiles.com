	  EXPLODING LIGHT BULBS

	   (_>SHADOW HAWK 1<_)

  I ACTUALLY GOT THIS FROM A MOVIE, AND HAVE TRIED IT [IT WORKS!!!].  OK YOU
MAY HAVE TO DO THIS A COUPLE TIMES BEFORE YOU GET IT.  HERES WHAT YOU NEED:

A FEW LIGHT BULBS
  TORCH [ONE THAT WILL MELT GLASS, RADIO SHACK SINGLE CYLENDER MODEL WILL DO]
  SOME GASOLINE
  SOME LIQUID SOAP
  SOME EPOXY GLUE

HERES WHAT YOU DO:

  1) MAKE A HOLE IN THE LIGHT BULB LIKE THIS:



		   *
		  ---
		  : :
  MAKE HOLE HERE  : :  OR HERE.
		\ / \ /
		 /   \
		:     :
		:     :
		 \---/
	     NOT HERE!!!!!

  2) MAKING THE HOLE, LIKE IN THE DIAGRAM [DONT MAKE IT ON THE BOTTOM, BECAUSE
IF THE SEAL YOU WILL MAKE SHOULD BREAK, THE PERSON/ROOM YOU WANT TO ELIMINATE
WILL NOTICE THE HOLE [AND THE GASOLINE ON THE FLOOR!!!] WHEREAS THE IF ITS ON
TOP IT WILL STILL WORK...

  3) NOW CAREFULLY FILL THE LIGHT BULB ABOUT HALF FULL WITH GAS, AND THEN THE
REST WITH SOAP [HOLD ON ANGLE IF YOU HAVE TO].	NOW EPOXY THE HOLE SHUT, AND
SCREW IT IN...

HAVE PHUN
