     Well in this file we will discuss different ways of making traps.  And we
will also talk about some different kinds detonators.  

DISCLAIMER----NEITHER I NOR ANY MEMBER OF MY GROUP BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
DAMAGE,CHAOS OR DESTRUCTION DONE BY ANY INFORMATION IN THIS FILE IT IS FOR 
INFORMATION PUR

 Note from the editor (EGGMAN): Well looks like line noise got in the way
                                of his disclamer, big deal.

ITEMS WE WILL DISCUSS
---------------------
1.ROAD TRAP
2.WALK TRAP
3.BOOK TRAP
4.DOOR-HANDLE TRAPS
5.LOOSE FLOORBOARD TRAP
6.ASSORTED DETONATORS

                                 THE ROAD TRAP 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

THE FIRST TRAP I WILL DISCUSS IS A BASIC ROAD TRAP.  YOU NEED A WIRE-TRAP 
ACTION TO COMPLETE THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT.  IT IS EXTREMELY SIMPLE TO MAKE,
SINCE ALL THE EQUIPMENT CAN BE GATHERED IN OR AROUND YOUR HOUSE.  THE GREAT 
ADVANTAGE TO THIS IS THAT IT WILL EXPLODE WHEN THE CAR IS DIRECTLY OVER IT. SO
INSURING MAXIMUM DESTRUCTION.

                                            +-------OTHER WIRE----------------

TO CONSTRUCT THE ROAD TRAP START BY DIGGING THREE HOLES ACROSS THE ROAD. IN 
TWO OF THE HOLES PLACE THE EXPLOSIVE CHARGES, AND IN THE THIRD PLACE A REGULAR
CAR BATTERY.  CONNECT THE FIRST WIRE FROM THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF THE BATTERY
VIA EACH OF THE BLASTING CAPS, IN EACH CHARGE, TO A METAL PIN ON ONE SIDE OF 
AN ORDINARY CLOTHES PIN. THE SECOND WIRE SHOULD BE DIRECTLY CONNECTED FROM THE
POSITIVE TERMINAL ON THE BATTERY TO THE OPPOSITE METAL PIN ON THE SAME CLOTHES
PIN. THE CLOTHES PIN MUST BE KEPT OPEN BY A SMALL WOODEN WEDGE, WHICH IS 
ATTACHED TO A THIN BLACK WIRE (ROPE) STRETCHED ACROSS THE ROAD. WHEN THE SEMI-
INVISIBLE WIRE IS PULLED THE WEDGE WILL BE PULLED OUT OF THE CLOTHES PIN THUS
CLOSING THE CLOTHES PIN. WHEN THE CLOTHES PIN IS CLOSED THE TWO METAL PINS 
WILL CONNECT AND COMPLETE THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT, THUS EXPLODING THE CHARGES.

 Note from editor (EGGMAN): Wow, two notes from me in one file - apparently
                            this file is not complete, too bad.
