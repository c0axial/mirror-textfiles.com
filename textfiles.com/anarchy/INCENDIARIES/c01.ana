             Well here it  is, the path  to true Anarchy.....Are  you
         worthy of the title of a  true Anarchist? We will soon  see.
         The Black  arts are  Theft, Deception,  Destruction and  all
         sub-forms of  Anarchy.  To master  the  techniques  involved
         takes time and  patience but most  of all, it  has to be  in
         your blood! You  can always  tell the  difference between  a
         True Anarchist and  a dabbler....Pulling the  fire alarm  at
         school duzn't cut it  ( Although that can  be phun during  a
         slow day )...Anyone can do that, BUT, can you do it  without
         getting caught? Well, that  is the tough  part. Even at   an
         early age one can see the signs of Anarchy emerge...if a kid
         watches Mister Rogers all  day, forget it  but if he  builds
         crude weapons out of household items and delights in tortur-
         ing the family pet, his sister etc.. then he has  potential.
         Anarchy usually  starts  off small  and  grows over  a  long
         period of time...at first,  primitive forms of Anarchy  such
         as crank calls, nicky nine doors and petty theft will  begin
         the process.  At this  point,  frequent failure  or  getting
         caught may put a stop  to the increasing chaotic  tendencies
         within the  person in  question. If  the little  bastard  is
         successful in his  endeavors, however,  he will  move on  to
         bigger and  better things.  The real  phun stuff  starts  in
         highschool..there are endless possibilities for amusement at
         the expense of others....these will be documented latr.  One
         thing to remember however is  that there are many  obstacles
         which stand in your path such as COPS, locks, alarms and  of
         course, the most important thing  to watch out for is  care-
         lessness on your part. It is becuz of carelessness that many
         good hellraisers have met their fate. Well, enough bullshit,
         let's get started!
