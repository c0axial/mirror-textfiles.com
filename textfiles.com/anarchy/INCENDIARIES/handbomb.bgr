comon sense to protect you.

2. Make sure any vehicle used to transport explosives is in proper working
condition, with a tight wooden or nonsparking metal floor, with sides and
ends high enough to keep explosives from falling out. Truck should be covered
with a fireproof, rain proof tarp. Wiring should be insulated and fire 
extinguishers should be carried.
