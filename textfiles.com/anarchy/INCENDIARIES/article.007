     The good people here at Dna have asked me to write an article 
concerning legal (and not so legal) self-defense items that ordinary, 
law-abiding citizens can purchase, carry, and use with impunity.  And here it
is (yes Paz, I've finally finished it!).  So with all that aside, here we go:

     
     To start off with, I thought I would address some of the items that 
you might NOT want to be seen walking our fair streets with, some of these 
items include:


1. Guns.  I know ALOT of people's first ideas on self defense are,
"I'll go out and get myself a gat!"  People LOVE guns, with good reasons.  
Guns are nasty, deadly, and quick.  They are also VERY dangerous.  For the 
common person, it is more likely that they will injure themselves, or an 
innocent bystander, than they are to hurt the person they are intending to.  
If you feel you HAVE to carry a firearm, my advice is to go out and get 
tested (and practice on as much as possible) on a police sponsored combat 
range (the kind with the targets that pop up at you), or at a video range 
(one that gives the same targets, civilian and enemy, but in a video 
scenario, and let you know EXACTLY where you've hit or not hit them).  If you 
feel you NEED a gun, then I suggest the following..

Revolvers are VERY nice, they are in some ways more accurate than semi-auto, 
they do not jam (and if they do, it's almost always a defective round lodged 
or jammed in the cylinder), and you can leave them loaded for extended 
periods of time.  They are easier to clean and maintain, and the slower rate 
of fire often causes someone to pause when they might have shot someone they 
did not intend to.  If you want to carry a semi-auto, I suggest the Colt 
1911, .45 semi-automatic.  This is a design that has been PROVEN since about 
1906 to be effective.  It carries 8 rounds in a grip-magazine and is 
recoil-operated.  It is accurate, and dependable.  It's boxy shape makes 
it easy to conceal (though some models are a BIT on the bulky side).  And the 
.45 round will, in most cases, be incapacitating, or deadly, after only one 
hit.  There are a TON of other good guns on the market (and a very limited 
space in the magazine), so if you want to carry one, get one, and make sure 
you are VERY comfortable with it, and it's release from the holster, before 
you hit those dark streets.   FBI statistics say that about 80% of most 
gunfights happen when all combatants are within about 10 feet of each other, 
and most others happen with one person running away, and firing over their 
shoulder.  My basic advice is, as I said before, these things are unsafe, and 
will, in the end, cause you more grief than relief. Take it from someone who 
carried one for about 2 years.  
        

2. Knives.  I am not a big supporter of knives either.  This is basically 
because it is almost impossible to "incapacitate" someone with a knife.  With 
our technology today, the only time I see it as being advisable to walk 
around with a sharpened piece of steel in your pocket, or on your hip for 
defense is at Renaissance Faires.  Knives come in a variety of sizes and 
shapes.  The legal limit is 3 inches of blade length.  Anything over 
that length (and not exceeding, I believe, 16 inches) needs to be carried in 
a sheath outside of clothing (even jackets and coats).  Double edged knives 
(daggers) are VERY illegal, and will be confiscated, and you will be taken 
away by the boys in blue for even having one in your car.  Again, don't do 
it, it's not worth it.  By law, any knife that is operated by a 
spring-mechanism (like a switchblade) is illegal.  Also any gravity fed, or 
one handed-operation knives.  A note on fighting with a knife.  The golden 
rule of knight-fighting is:  Never get in a Knife-fight, you can't 
win!  You can only lose by varying degrees!  In this day and age, 
there is no place for two grown people to go about carving each other up 
like a couple of neanderthals!  


3.  Nun-chucks (sorry, I don't have my Mutant Turtle-to-English Dictionary 
handy at the moment).  Things like this, and almost any other "martial arts 
weaponry" should really stay on the Dojo wall.  Things like Sai's, Tunfa's, 
Shurikan's (throwing stars), Swords, and Spears all take YEARS to master (so 
you don't knock yourself out, as anyone who's ever played with nun-chucks 
knows happens alot, or slicing any of your fingers off!).  YES, you can get 
very proficient with these items given a short amount of time, most of them 
are very simple in principle, but in a fight which might only last seconds, 
and could lead to someone becoming DEAD, I would personally have something in 
my hand that I am SURE I know how to use.  Wouldn't you?  


4.  Concealed weapons.  This is a very round-about, and blanket category 
which covers any concealed, or hidden weapon.  Things like sword-canes, 
belt-buckle knives, throwing stars disguised as Gawd knows what, or any funky 
little do-dad.  Most of these take some time to draw (time you may NOT have 
in a fight), and cops can recognize most of them in an instant.  They are 
simply not worth the night in jail.  And since most of the items in the 
market are concealed knives anyways, you most likely have to kill your 
opponent (at a VERY close range).  Besides, do you really want to face off 
against two or three gang-bangers with your pants around your ankles, because 
you're holding the belt, trying to get that nifty knife out??

5. Other dumb things.  This concerns really bad ideas like  mugger alerts 
(those little boxes that make a horrible sound when the cord is pulled), 
whistles, and other sundry items.  These devices are designed to alert people 
to the fact that you are being, in some way, abused.  But let me pose this 
question, how many people listen to car-alarms these days?
 

Okay, now that we've spent a LONG time discussing things that are not a
good idea, let's talk about some things that might be a bit more intelligent 
to carry about with you:


1. Pepper-spray.  Cayenne pepper-spray can be bought at almost any gun
shop (and at Spy Tech in Costa Mesa..just had to include that).  I believe 
you need a license to carry one.  Though you can get this by being over 18 (I 
believe) and attending the class (which is like two hours long..wank wank 
wank wank).  It was originally used by mailmen to guard themselves against 
dogs.  It is a replacement for mace (which I believe you CAN get, but you 
need to take certain self-defense classes, and is a big drag which takes TOO 
long to obtain).  Many stores will sell it under the counter (esp. if you are 
young, pretty, blonde, and have a good sob story.  So send your girlfriend in 
to get it if you can.), I think it costs anywhere from 15-30 bucks (haven't 
priced it for about 3 years, so your guess is about as good as mine. It works 
okay, and is fairly accurate.  I wouldn't trust my LIFE to the stuff, but it 
should buy you a couple of seconds.


2. Stun Guns.  The police would have you believe that these are the
best items for self-defense.  In my opinion, they're good, but have some 
SEVERE draw-backs.  The biggest being you actually have to TOUCH someone with 
it for it to work (the self-propelled model, called a 'tazer' is listed by 
most police agencies as a firearm which requires the proper permit.  Thanks 
Uncle Sam).  The second being that it is not as effective on certain people.  
People who are very fat (or muscular) or jolt themselves with electricity on a 
regular basis will not feel the effects as much as the 'average' person.  
Also, certain types of clothing will lessen the effect, heavy leather 
coats/jackets being the worst.  Using it on someone will deaden whatever part 
of the body it touches, arm, leg, etc. for a few moments.  My advice is 
ALWAYS go for body-mass or the head (the same goes for using a hand gun).  
But like I said, you actually have to TOUCH someone with it, so go easy, 
chummers.  They can be obtained at nearly any gun store, Spy Tech 
(again a plug..haha), swap meet, just about anywhere (I know of a couple of 
adult stores that sell them, and not the kind you shock yourself with, what a 
world we live in.  But if this world were perfect, you wouldn't be reading 
this, go figure).  They come in all ranges of voltage, I believe the highest 
being about 90,000 volts (but I could be wrong).  And in all sizes, from 
hand-held models to things that look like cattle-prods.  There is even a 
model, I call it a 'Stun Sword' that has wire around the shaft, or blade, of 
the weapon(yes, weapon.  these can be just as offensive as defensive, esp. 
this model), and two prongs at the top.  It delivers 90,000 volts to some 
poor jerk no matter WHAT part you hit them with.  It's worth the investment.  
Just remember: Take it OUT of your pocket before turning it on, it does NOT 
impress the babes to hear that you are responsible for mugging yourself!  And 
you can carry one on your person, I think it can't be concealed, though.


3. Flashlights.  yes, you heard me right, flashlights.  One of the BEST 
things to outfit your car with is a 5 or 6 cell Maglight <tm>.  I have a 5 
cell that I keep between the seat and the driver's door.  They are perfectly 
legal (you can even get a special holding clip for your car.  What a world!), 
and make GREAT clubs (10,000 sadistic police officers CAN'T be wrong!).  At 
night, flashing that several hundred candle-power light in someone's eyes 
just before smashing they greymass all over the pavement is an added 
advantage. You can get them at swapmeets, or gunshows (also a great 
place to find stun guns, btw) for ridiculous prices (I believe I paid 
something like $25. for mine), AND you get the convenience of having a 
flashlight in yer car!  What a deal!  You can also carry them in backpacks or 
duffle-bags.  Many's a night that I have felt more secure walking down a dark 
street, knowing that heavy piece of metal is right over my shoulder.  Again, 
you have to touch someone, but having that nice, balanced, club in my hands 
makes me feel ALOT better!


4. Walking sticks.  Here we are!  The walking stick is Gawd's answer to the 
prayers of the average citizen!  Even forgoing all the neat-o extras you can 
have inside a cane, like blades and guns (don't worry about those, they are 
VERY illegal.  Though you can get a nice 12 gauge cane-gun from Griffen Arms, 
Inc.), they are still one of the best things you can have.  Imagine being 
able to walk down the street with a club, no, a MACE (just like a Medieval 
Knight) at your side, ready for action, with IMPUNITY!  You can.  There is no 
law prohibiting someone 18 years of age, or older from having a walking 
stick, or cane.  I personally own one, that has an oak shaft and a 3 pound 
brass ball at the end (purchased from the Tinder Box pipe and tobacco store 
in Orange, for about $40, as a Prom accessory!  and they let me in with it 
because my leg was hurt!).  The police always stop me, they search first me, 
and then the cane.  They twist the handle, tug at it, look at the tip, 
everything.  After a few minutes they give up, and ask me where the knife is, 
or the gun.  I simply smile, and say, "Why occifer, I don't know 
WHAT you mean..."  You can get walking sticks at ANY good tobacco shop, or 
craft fare (some GREAT ones, even custom ones, can be obtained at your local 
Renaissance Faire), the better quality stick you have, the longer and better 
it will serve you.  A cane is ALWAYS at hand, and ready to be used.  You 
still have to touch your opponent, but it gives you a GREAT advantage.  
The only problem you will have is that it DOES mark you.  The cops WILL 
hassle you about it, even if you walk with a limp, so be ready for it!
 
5. Assorted Blunt Instruments.  This is another cover-all classification that 
covers just about any other blunt weapon you can name.  The basic problem is 
walking around WITH a club in your hands.  The cops ARE going to look at you 
funny if you're walking down the street lightly tapping a baseball bat 
against the curb.  If you have a car, that is the best place to keep it.  
Though I recommend carrying a T-Ball bat (they're lighter and you can fight 
better with it), just make sure you have a glove and a ball on the seat too.  

Some other items include:  

Brass knuckles.  These are good, but you have to be in VERY close to use them, 
and they ARE illegal to carry.  But, it's better than naught, and VERY easy 
to conceal.  

Jacks and saps. These are essentially a bag with either grape-shot, or some 
form of weight at the end.  A bag of marbles (esp. if you have a few ball 
bearing, or pachinco balls mixed in) works great for this person! I have a 
sock full of domino's that's guaranteed to put someone to sleep.  If you're 
still in school, get the lock off your P.E. Locker and drop it in a sock, if 
you need protection in a hurry.  This tool is a bit awkward to use, but VERY 
effective.  

Chains.  A bike chain (a chain used to lock a bike to a post) is a VERY nice 
little tool. I personally recommend getting a bag, or pouch on your bike 
just for carrying one (no matter what type of lock you use.  Keep all the 
'gorilla grips in your backpack)  It's close at hand, and the cops can't 
say diddly.  It's even BETTER if there's a lock at the end.  Any Ghost Rider 
fans out there??  

Sawed-off Pool Cues.  I know this one is a BIT difficult to transport.  But 
I've found no better non-lethal tool in my varied travels.  If you don't care 
about the cops searching your car (or they just never do), keep one on the 
floor infront of the back seats.  It's best to cut it to about 3 to 3 and a 
half feet long (starting from the big end).  I've seen no better barroom 
brawling, or infighting weapon.  I carried one in my car for about a year.  
If you can find a cue that screws together, then just use the heavy end.  
There are even some out there that have steel centers, mine did (it was for 
'balance'..yeah, right.  I balanced a few brain-cases with it!), covet these 
like gold!  It's a good idea to have one in your room, just incase.  They're 
less awkward than a baseball bat, and you can use one in close quarters.  

Broken Bottles.  Bottles are everywhere (well, almost), and chances are 
you'll be standing right next to one when something breaks out.  Remember, 
just like with knives, these are lethal, and using one on someone, whether 
they die or not is considered 'Assault with a lethal weapon', so go lightly.  
But they're cheap and easy to find.  When in a bad neighborhood, and having 
no weapon at hand, I always try to get a drink that comes in a glass bottle 
(thank Gawd they're getting more popular.  Let's hear it for recycling!), 
just in case...  

Hat Pins.  A few years ago, there was some moron telling old ladies to use 
the large pins (sometimes up to 5 inches long) in their hats as weapons.  I 
don't know about you, but if I'm being rushed by a 300 pound, drunk, Samoan 
gentleman, one of the LAST things I want to do is jab him with this 
itty-bitty pin, don't know about you.  Some guys in LA get a major thrill out 
of sticking pins and needles in their bodies (and they're not even shooting 
junk), I doubt that this is going to faze them much.   


A good idea is to use some of these tools in combination.  Like using pepper 
spray to blind someone and then stepping in with your stun gun (to give him a 
kiss goodnight).  When trying to decide what item<s> to carry, just remember, 
if it doesn't FEEL legal, then it probably isn't.  The cops cannot take away 
your stun gun, or pepper spray (though you DO need a license for the spray).  
Consult the local ordinances for the laws regarding what you can and can't 
carry, and how you can carry them.  If you cannot obtain legal books (if 
you're too lazy to go down the local public library), then the nice man at 
your local gun store will probably be able to tell you, and even let you 
purchase a few goodies.  Though I prefer to shop "off-market", that choice is 
up to you.  Hope this has helped someone.  Just remember:  It's a real crappy 
world.  You have the RIGHT to defend yourself, don't let them take it away.
