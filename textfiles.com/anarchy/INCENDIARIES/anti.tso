                         THE ULTIMATE BOOBY TRAP

                                   OR

                      AMMONIUM NITROGEN TRI-IODIDE

Every reference I've read concerning ammonium nitrogen tri-iodide
has it as an interesting scientific curiosity with no practical ap-
plication, "ANTI", as I call it; being anti enemy, is guaranteed to be
the most effective booby trap trigger ever discovered. I got the formula
from "Chemical Magic", one of the books in GRAND-DAD'S WONDERFUL
BOOK OF CHEMISTRY. ANTI is simply iodine crystals soaked in strong
ammonia. The book advises making up just a little bit and demonstra-
ting how it can be set off by the touch of a feather.You see it is an
explosive. In fact, it's a high explosive; a fulminate!
The reason other writers have dismissed it as having no practical
application is probably because they don't think along the lines
of improved weaponry. But I do. I made about a teaspoonful and spread it
out an eighth of an inch(0,3cm) thick on my work table and let it dry.
Then I barely touched it with a feather. Instead of the snap-crackle-pop
effect described in the book, it was a real explosion. The table was
pitted and my ears rang. After having made far more than required to
demostrate this amazingly unstable substance, I was struck by its
heretofore unmentioned potential as a weapon.
Imagine a high explosive anyone can make and which is harmless while
moist but devastating when dry. Say you put a moist piece about the
size of a grain of rice into a pipe bomb three fourths full of powder
and screw on the cap. When its moisture diffuses troughout the pipe,
in about an hour, it is dry and any vibration will cause it to explode,
thereby igniting the powder, Crushed into a paste, a dollop about the
size of a bean on a stick of dynamite, once dry will explode the dynamite
at the slightest vibration. Such a pipe bomb or a stick of dynamite
under the car seat of an enemy would have him out of the way an hour
down the road. I'm sure you can think of many other ways to use it.  

To make it, all you need is iodine crystals and strong ammonia.You can
get both from most pharmacies located near hospitals. I would advise
against asking for both at the same place. If your pharmacist doesn't
stock iodine crystals he can order them for you at about $12.00 for
four ounces. You might tell him  you are thinking of making up some
first aid kits and want to make your own tincture of iocine. Four ounce
is enough to last you a life time.

The strong ammonia can be gotten under the pretense of being a butter
fly and moth collector. Ammonia in bottles with some cotton on the bot
kills them very quickly. The store ammonia is weaker and the soap sticks
to the scales so strong ammonia is an absolute necessity. But if you
don't want to bother your pharmacist you can distill your own ammonia.
Two 28 ounce bottles will provide 14 ounces of strong ammonia, free
from the soap and gunk in all household cleaning ammonias.
Anyway, to make ANTI, just drop iodine crystals into ten times their
volume of strong ammonia. A few grains will prove the process. After
about ten minutes soaking, swirl and pour the iodine crystals into a
coffee filter. Then remove the filter from its holder and scrape up the
crystals and/or paste with a knife or spatula. Crystals are best for
strewing around for people to step or sit on, causing coronaries.
Paste is best for spreading on things and also for stability in the
rate of drying. A small pile of treated crystals drying would set each
other off because of its own weight.When you put the ANTI on a board
or some other surface you don't care about, use the knife or spatula
to seperate it into tiny bits. After an hour's drying just slightly touch
one of the particles with a feather or anything else and you'll get a
surprisingly loud explosion, which will most likely set off the rest
if the particles are close together.
ANTI can be made in arelatively large batch and carried safely. A good
way is to cut about a square inch from the corner of a plastic baggy.
Put the ANTI in the bottom corner and roll it up. Then wrap it in a wet
cloth and roll that up and put it in a whole baggy and roll that up
too. The ANTI could stay that way for months and yet be ready for use
at any time.
