			     Building A Campo Bomb

Here are the plans to make a nice bomb that is sure to impress your friends.
It's relatively safe too! This is an original creation, developed and tested
exclusively by Cesspool Computing. This beauty is known as...
		     "The Johnny (Fatman) Campo Bomb"

Ingredients:
     * A large explosive such as an M-80 or H-100.
     * A large cylindrical cardboard container, such as the kind Planters
       Cheese Balls or Kool-Aid drink mix, comes in.
     * Several cans of Comet Cleanser. Don't use Ajax, it's not as good.
     * Roll of electrical tape.

Plans:
     Fill the container half full of the Comet cleanser. Poke a one eigth inch 
hole in the side of the container at the halfway point. Insert the explosive 
charge in the center of the container and run the fuse through the hole. (You 
may have to lenghten to fuse.) Pour more Comet over the explosive charge to the
top of the container. Pack down well. Put lid back on container. Reinforce the
lid and base with the tape. Add the "Johnny (Fatman) Campo Bomb" name to the 
device and your done.

When you light this, run like mad (unless you love to inhale Comet), because 
when it goes off it produces a huge explosion and a massive green cloud that 
drifts & drifts & drifts. Have fun,

P.S. See if you can top the Cesspool record. We made one with three H-100's 
     inside, along with 15 pounds of Comet. What a blast!
