Napalm
------
        Mix gasoline with dish washing detergent (Ivory Soap) untill the
        solution is like honey. Use it in a bottle with a rag as molotov
        cocktail or paint it on something and light it. It will burn alot
        longer than regular gas.

Land Mine #1
------------
        Take a soup can and line the inside with Petroleum jelly (enough so
        you won't have air between the cup and can. Place a  Styrofoam cup
        inside the can and f)lU it with gasoline. Cover the soup can with a
        sheet of Aluminum foil and tape it down so it is air tight. Place can
        in a freezer over night. Dig a small hole in the ground and place the
        can in it foil side up. Cover it up with with dirt about one inch
        thick. Carefully place a nail in the dirt (don't break the foil!).
        When someone steps on the nail and pierces the foil, the mine will
        go off and so will their foot.

Land Mine #2
------------
        Get a push button switch. Take the wires and connect one end to a
        9 volt battery connecter and the other to a Solar Igniter. Connect
        the other wire of the battery to the other wire on the solar igniter.
        Connect the solar igniter to the fuse of one of your favorite bombs
        (M-80, pipe bomb, etc.). Dig a hole, not too deep, but enough to
        cover up the whole thing. Plant the switch under a leaf or something
        and plant the bomb about 5 feet away. When the person steps on the
        switch, there should be a 3 second delay, then it will blow.

Black Powder
------------
        Place 5 pints of alcohol in a bucket. In another bucket, put 3 cups
        of granulated potassium nitrate, 2 cups powdered wood charcoal, and
        1/2 cup of powdered sulfur into the bucket. Add 1 cup of water and
        stir well with a wooden stick. Place the bucket on a heat source and
        add 2 more cups of water and wait for it to bubble but don't let it
        boil. Remove the bucket from the heat and pour it into the alcohol
        while stirring well. Let the alcohol stand for about 5 minutes. Strain
        the liquid through cheesecloth to remove the powder. Wrap the cloth
        around the powder and squeeze out the excess liquid. Place a piece
        of screen on top of a bucket. Place a workable amount of black powder
        (That black muddy looking stuff) on the screen and begin to workd it
        through. Spread the end result on a piece of newspaper and let it dry
        in the sunlight. Now you have black powder which can be used to make
        other bombs.

Impact Bomb
-----------
        Mix solid Nitric Iodine with househould ammonia. Wait overnight
        and pour off the liquid. You will be left with a muddy substance.
        Let it dry untill it hardens up. To use it, put it in a bottle or
        can and just drop it or throw it at something.

Carbide Bomb
------------
        This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution....
        Obtain some calcium carbide. This stuff can be found at nearly any
        hardware store. Take a few pieces of this stuff (it looks like gravel)
        and put it in a glass jar with some water. Cover the jar tightly. The
        carbide will react with the water to produce acetylene carbonate which
        is similar to the gas used in cutting torches. Eventually the glass
        with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a burning rag
        nearby, you will get a nice fireball.

Exhaust Bomb
------------
        Install a spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tail
        pipe by drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.
        Attach a wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the
        switch and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached
        to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply
        hit the switch and watch the flames.

Turn Signal
-----------
        Detach the plastic running light (or turn signal) cover on someones
        car.  Break the bulb.  Test the bulb with a voltage meter to make sure
        it is not live. Pack the bulb with Flash Paper and replace the cover.
        When the person starts his car or goes to turn, a quick burst of flame
        will pop out of the back of his car making him think it is on fire.


Winger
------
        This is the ultimate in assault devices. It is a large, three person
        sling-shot designed for hurling water baloons up to 100 yards. They
        are supposed to leave the sling-shot at 240mph but through personal
        experience, I've gotten some to go at least 150-200 yards. As for the
        speed, I don't know. These are good for launching almost anything
        that is not motion sensitive. You can get them at some boat shops
        (that's where I got mine), or you can order them from:

                Winger Sports LTD.
                2167 Buhl Avenue
                North St. Paul Minnesota  55109
