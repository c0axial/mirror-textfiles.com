           STEEL CASINGS:
           BY: GRAY CHANCE 

OK, THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST DEADLY OF
THE PIPE BOMBS. TAKE A STEEL ROD OF ANY
THICKNESS (PROBABLY AT LEAST 1/2") AND
BORE OUT THE CENTER BY DRILLING IN FROM
ONE END. DONT DRILL ALL THE WAY THROUGH
THOUGH. THEN DRILL A HOLE IN THE SIDE
FOR THE FUSE. FOLLOW THE SAME METHOD
FOR CAPPING THE OPEN END AS IS DONE
WITH REGULAR PIPE BOMBS.
THE NICE THING ABOUT STEEL IS ITS
STRENGTH. THE THICKER YOU MAKE THE
WALLS OF THE BOMB, THE BIGGER THE BANG.
SIZE HELPS ALSO. THERES ONLY ONE
PROBLEM WITH IT THOUGH- THE CAP AT ONE
END TENDS TO BLOW OFF IF ITS TOO
POWERFUL, OR IF THE CAP HOLDS, THEN ALL
THE FUEL SHOOTS OUT THROUGH THE FUSE
HOLE. THERE IS A SOLUTION FOR EACH.
TO KEEP THE CAP ON, MAKE A CLAMP OUT
OF STEEL THAT WRAPS AROUND THE BOMB
FROM END TO END. THIS SHOULD HOLD IT
IN PLACE.
FOR THE FUSE HOLE: DRILL A VERY TINY
HOLE. THEN USE AN IGNITOR (PREFERABLY
HOME MADE) WITH INSULATED WIRES. THEN
TAKE ANOTHER THIN STEEL CASING AND FIT
THE BOMB INSIDE IT ONLY THIS STEEL CASI
NG DOESN'T HAVE A FUSE HOLE JUST
RUN THE LEADS OUT ONE END. USE YOUR
STANDARD IGNITION SWITCH FOR ANY
IGNITOR AND SET IT OFF. IT WOULD
PROBABLY BE SAFER TO USE A TIMER.
