Phone Ringer
------------
        This will only work if you have an old desk type phone with the bell,
        not one that beeps. Remove the various screws that you need to to take
        the phone apart. If you see 2 bells with a little knocker in the
        middle, you are in luck. If the bells are made of some non-electricity
        conducting metal, cover them, along with the knocker, with tin foil.
        Connect a wire to the knocker and one to the bell. This is your "gap"
        for the electrical current. Wire up some type of electrical device
        to the "gizmo" you have created by wiring the negatives direct, and
        by splitting the positives with the bell and knocker. Since the contact
        will only be for a millisecond, I suggest that you do not use a Solar
        igniter. Instead, use a mini lightbulb that only requires something
        like a 9-volt to make it light. Break the very top of the bulb off and
        fill the remainder with gunpowder or flash powder. Place the fuse in
        the powder and tape it up real good. When the phone rings, if all has
        gone well, whatever you have connected will blink, blow up, or do
        whatever it is supposed to.

Matchbox
--------
        Take a matchbox (sliding type, preferably white tip matches) and remove
        all of the matches. Get a piece of light sandpaper approximately the
        size of the box and glue it to the roof of the box housing (not the
        little drawer part). Take one or two matches and cut the wood off so
        you will have just the tip and enough stick to push it up against the
        roof of the box. Use heavy glue or air hardening clay to glue the
        sawed-off matches to the floor of the drawer. Fill the drawer up with
        some type of explosive or other device (salt-peter -n- sugar for a real
        small, inexspensive smoke bomb. Just enough to scare somebody and
        maybe burn their hands a little). Push on the sides of the box to
        make to roof lift up from the rest of the box and slide the drawer in
        slowly and carefully. Now, just place the boom-box somewhere where it
        is sure to be found (on a table in a mall) and watch for some dude
        who wants to light up a smoke!

Christmas gift
--------------
        Is there alot of holiday thefts in your town? If there is, this is
        for you. First, build a small pipe bomb with heavily salt-petered
        black powder or some other powder that is easy to ignite. Instead of
        a fuse, insert one of those little kid toys that you pull the 2
        strings apart and it pops, or even a popper from a champagne party
        popper that shoot out streamers or confetti. Next, poke a small hole
        in the side of a nice sized box. tape the bomb to the wall of the box
        so the popper hole is right next to the hole in the box. Run the
        string through and tie an even longer one to the end. Tie the very
        end (not the bomb end) to something in your car, roll down the window,
        place the "prize" on the seat, and go for a little cruise through the
        problem areas in your town. Just wait for one of those little bastards
        to reach in, grab the box, and run. Looks like you're at the end of
        your rope there son. This could even be placed / tied down to a park
        bench or something like that. The only problem is, when it blows,
        he/she/it will be quite pissed if they can still move. I've seen people
        get everything from school bags to purses ripped off in this manner.
        You can't call that anarchy, that is just plain being an asshole!

Highway Messages
----------------
        You see everyone painting stuff like "Ozzy Rules" and "Dick loves Jane"
        on highway overpasses. You may think it is a cool idea yourself by
        painting something as simple as an anarchy symbol up there. Well, why
        be normal? Try painting it on the cement where the cars go! Just steal
        a few road barricades (ones with blinking lights on them) and set them
        up around the road to be painted. Get out your can of paint, do the
        job, and go! Make the letters tall. You'll have to remember that the
        motorists will be reading it from an angle!

Police Radar Stopper
--------------------
        Have you ever gotten nailed by the cops in one of those speed-radar
        traps? Well, if you put a burnt out flourescent lightbulb on your
        dash, it will absorb the energy from the air and not sent them back
        a response! A cop said it works, but I would still slow down if I
        were you. Personally, I think it's tacky looking to drive around
        with a lightbulb on the dash of my Porsche! Ha!

Radio Control
-------------
        Obtain an old remote control vehicle (very cheap, like the kind radio
        shack sells for $20, you probably have 3 or 4 in your attic). It
        doesn't have to be complex, just the kind that will make the wheels
        turn when you hit a button. Remove the "servo" from the car. Make
        a small box that will hold the receiver, servo, and battery. Run a
        wire from the + terminal on the battery to the servo. Next, find where
        the servo will stop rotating and place a small piece of sheet metal
        there (preferably somewhere on the wall of the box). Run a wire from
        one side of a solar ingiter to the sheet metal. Wire the other side
        of the igniter directly to the negative terminal on the battery.
        Now, just tape the fuse from an explosive directly to the igniter.
        You're machine is ready to roll. This can be used in devices like
        the christmas gift bomb. It should have about a 50 foot range.
        When you want it to go, just hit the switch!

School Stink Bomb
-----------------
        Take a mayonnaise jar and fill the bottom with sulfur. Next, take
        some flimsy aluminum foil and make a leak-proof bowl out of it that
        will cover the top of the jar (test it first or get busted!). Place
        the bowl over the top of the jar. Obtain some medium strength
        Hydrochloric acid and pour enough of it to do a good job in the bowl.
        Place your little jar near one of the air conditioning unit's intake
        vents and leave (preferably one in a janitor's closet or where no
        students go). In good time, the HCL will eat through the aluminum
        and drop onto the sulfur. The air intake will suck up the smoke and
        fumes and take out the whole building, and they'll probably close
        school for a day or so.

Where do I get it?
------------------
        I know what you're thinking.. "Where do I get the chemicals I need to
        make all of these explosive devices I would need to use some of these
        ideas?" Well, I've been asked that question many of times. The only
        answers I have are: 1) Make your own black powder (See Terrorist Home
        Companion series), 2) Buy some Pyrodex and cannon fuse from your local
        sporting goods shop (Tell them you have a house on a lake with a small
        cannon and you need it for a family reunion), or (drumroll please),
        for the chemicals, tubes, fuses, and everything else you would ever
        need, send $13.50 for a subscription to AM Fireworks News (address
        below). It has ads for companies that sell everything you would
        ever need.

[ Warning ]
-----------
        The tips in this file and other files written by myself are somewhat
        incomplete. This leaves a margin for you to use your own creativity.
        All tips have either been tested or just plain "have to work". I
        suggest that unless you know what you are doing, don't try too many
        of these. And if you do, do it small scale first.
