Intro:

        It's time for another file to be written. People tell me "From your
        files, you don't look very much like an Anarchist, I mean, you use
        fair grammar and all..". I would just like to say that I am an
        Anarchist, not an illiterate (sounds pretty fake coming from some one
        in New Orleans).. Also, as you can see, I'm running out of ideas. If
        anyone has any good ideas or even thoughts about making bombs, tell
        me. I can take a thought and turn it into a Cat Bomb for instance..
        On to the Bombs!


Shocking Experience
-------- ----------

        Run a wire from spark plug #1 on your car (preferably 6 or 8 cylinder
        engine) out to the bumper. Fix a rubber platform to the bumper (if you
        have a metal one) and attach a coat hanger to the wire and prop it up
        like a ram-rod. Next, pull up behind some fool outside of a shopping
        mall waiting to pick someone up. Touch the coat hanger to the car and
        rev up your engine a little. The next person to touch a metal part of
        the car will get a 12 volt current through their whole body! Not enough
        to kill (unless the guy has a pace maker), but enough to make them jump
        and scare the shit out of 'em!


Cat Bomb
--- ----

        Take a full can of tuna. Open it, remove all of the tuna and clean it
        out real good. Drill a small hole in the side and then nail the can
        down to a piece of plywood. Take a Champagne Party Popper and remove
        the little explosive device on the string. Run this through the hole
        (so the explosive in on the inside and the string on the outside) and
        fill the can up with about 1/8 inch of gunpowder (Heavily salt-petered
        for easy ignition). Place the lid back on and pack it down good. Use
        Clay or Silicon to seal up the cracks on the sides. Put some of the
        tuna back on top and place the bomb in the path of some soon to be
        suprised feline! Tie a string to the igniter string and hide about
        20-30 feet away. When the cat stops to have a bite, pull the string!
        And if all works well, the device should explode and scare or kill
        the little furry bastard.


Loud Pipe Bomb
---- ---- ----

        Mix Potassium Perchlorate with some 600 mesh Aluminum Powder in a
        2/1 ratio. Drill a small hole in a small piece of 1/4 in. copper
        tubing. Place a fuse in the hole, pack the tube with the above
        mixture, and close both ends of the tube. If you don't know what
        to do from here, you shouldn't be reading this!


Bird Buster
---- ------

        This isn't really a bomb, but it's fun anyway! Place some Alka-Seltzer
        in someones bird feeder. When the bird eats it, it starts producing
        gas. The bird can't release the gas and if he ate enough, he should
        explode!


Tennis Ball
------ ----

        Take a box of kitchen matches and saw all of the heads off (must be
        white tips! The kind you can light on the ground!). Get a tennis ball
        and pop a little hole in the top. Put the match heads in the tennis
        ball untill it is full (this takes a while). Throw it at hard as you
        can at your target. If the match heads were packed tight enough, it
        should produce a nice sized explosion.


Time Delay
---- -----

        These are the simplest forms of time delays for bombs that use fuses.
        (1) Light a cigarette and break off the filter. Place the end of the
        fuse in the end where the filter used to be. In about 10-15 minutes,
        your device should go off. (2) Set up your bomb on a wooden platform
        (When planting bombs, I always do so I don't have to waste time
        setting up). Place a drop of glue on the wood and mount a party candle
        on it. Lay the fuse of the bomb across the candle where it cannot move
        and the flame cannot miss it. These "always" work and I have never had
        any problem with either one.

Drink Fun
----- ---

        If you want to have some fun and scare on of your friends, take a 9
        volt battery and drop it in his or her drink. When they go to take
        a sip, they'll get a small shock and probably spill their drink all
        over themselves.

Locker Fun
------ ---

        If you would like to get revenge on someone in school, wait till before
        a real long holiday (or a weekend if you can't wait). Take an apple and
        grate it on the locker vents. If the person doesn't find out, in about
        a day or so, his or her lcoker should be surrounded by fruit flies and
        all of their belongings should stink pretty bad!
