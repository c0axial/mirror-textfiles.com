======RDX====== 
[RDX...cyclotrimethylenetrinitra-mine.
Also known as cyclonite.
Secondary high explosive.
Heat of reaction 5.694 kilojoules
per gram.  Gas volume creation
908 cubic cm per gram.  140% as
prisant as TNT.  Effect of
prolonged storage is negligible.]
Stuph Needed:
             -------------
Hexamethylenetetramine (also known as hexamine)
...available from
drugstores as urotropine, hexamin,
and methenamine.  Used to cure
urinary infections.

Strong Nitric Acid...chem supply
stores.
Acetone...from drug and hardware stores.
  Used as a paint solvent.
Graduated cylinder or measuring cups
Thermometer (20-100 degrees C or 68-212
 degrees F)
Several quart canning jars
Two large basins or bowls made
of metal.
Paper towels

Procedure:

1.   Place 1/2 cup (120 ml) of
nitric acid in a large canning
jar and bring the temperature to
between 20 and 30 degrees C
(68-86 F) by putting the jar in
a basin of cold water.  If
necessary, swirl the canning jar
around the basin of cold water
to bring the temperature down.

2.   Weigh or measure out 70
grams by weight, 18 teaspoons
by volume, of the hexamine and
start adding the salt-like
hexamine slowly, 1/2 teaspoon
at a time, during a 15 minute
time period.  Maintain the
temperature between 20-30
degrees C. while stirring gently
with the thermometer.  Control
the temperature by dipping more
and less of the can in the water.

3.   When all of the hexamine is
dissolved in the acid, heat the
solution to 55 degrees C (131 F)
by placing the jar in a
basin of hot water.  Maintain
this temperature for 10 minutes.

4.   After heating the solution 
for 10 minutes, remove the canning
jar from the basin of hot water
and place it in the basin of
cold water.  Cool the canning
jar to 20 degrees C.

5.   When the temperature is 20 C,
add 3 cups (750 ml) of cold
water to the solution and a white
salt will appear.

***********************************

The white precipitated salt is   
*RDX explosive, and it should be 
handled with care from this point
on.                              
************************************

6.   Filter the acid/water/RDX
solution through a paper towel
covering the mouth of anotherjar.

7.   Wash the RDX crystals off of
the paper towel and into a canning
jar, using an additional 3 cups
of fresh, cold water.  Add a
teaspoon of sodium carbonate to
neutralize the acid and stir
rapidly for 2 to 3 minutes,
then filter again.

8.   The crude product can be
dried out on the paper towel
filter.  It is suitable for
fairly immediate use, or it can
be purified.

9.   To purify RDX, fill a
canning jar 2/3 full of acetone.
Heat the acetone by placing the jar
in a basin of hot simmering water,
then add RDX, a tablespoon at a
time, until it completely
dissolves in the acetone.

10.  After the maximum amount of
RDX has been dissolved in the
hot acetone, allow the solution
to cool to room temperature, then
let stand for one more hour.

11.  The RDX will form a salt
once again.  Filter out the
RDX and spread it to dry on a
paper towel as before.

*****************
RDX is not too *
*sensitive to  *
*heat and shock*
*but it is very*
*sensitive to  *
*friction. Thus*
*use great care*
*when packing. *
****************

Using the amount of chems given
in this article, you should
get about 1 1/2 ounces of RDX
crystals of very good quality
if you purified it.  Two or three
batches will be enough to make
a three inch hole in sheet metal
(say the side of a car).  8-10
ounces will be enough to do
enough blast overpressure to
take out the windows of a room.

========P.O.L========

[Petroleum Oil/Liquid charge.
Designed for defeating tanks
of flamable liquids or gases.]
Stuph Needed:
-------------
Soap dishes containing two
seperate halves, the bottom flat
half fitting into the top
bevelled half (standard soap dish)

Any homemade high explosive
Thermite Incendiary
Detonator
Small alinco horseshoe magnets,
double sided tape, or both.

Procedure
       ----------

1.   Seperate the two halves of the
soap dish.  Drill hole in top and
insert detonator.

2.   Fill 1/2 of the bottom half
with a metalized incendiary such
as thermite or aluminum granules.
Thermite:  3 parts iron oxide
powder and 2 parts aluminum
powder, by volume.

3.   Fill remaining half of bottom
of soap dish with any powerful
homemade explosive.

4.   Fill 1/2 of top half with
the explosive.

5.   Secure halves together with
tape.  Stick on target with
tape and/or magnets.  Detonate.
