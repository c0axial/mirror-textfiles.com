         To begin, I must first declare that the contents of these files,
         should they fall into the hands of the federal authorities, do
         not represent any specific instructions and are merely to teach.
         THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT I ALSO SAY THAT UNDER NO
         CIRCUMSTANCES, SHOULD THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS BE INTERPRETED
         INTO ILLEGAL ACTIONS...      now to the good stuff....

         DeScRiPtioN:
   
      Ever wanted to rEaLLy hurt someone?  Well, during World War I the item known as shrapnel was developed.  It was not a single material, more any material that was specifically designed to splinter into sharp, jagged pieces, and shoot into the body of the enemy, permanently and painfully incapacitating them...   HERE is a way that you can at home build a ShRapNelrocket to send at long range to someone, and give them a NaSTY suprise!­!


         MaTerIaLs:
  
    -1 model rocket

    -Normal Fuse

    -Gasoline

    -Gunpowder, sulphur, C-? Explosive, Nitroglycerine, or any supply of highly    explosive material

    -Rock, Glass, Fiberglass, Plastic, or any other sharp, splintering material
    
   
         InStRuCtIonS:

       1.) Buy any ordinary Model rocket from a hobby store.  You are best off          buying as wide a rocket as possible.  It will make construction much          easier.

       2.) Assemble the other materials listed above.

       3.) Take the body of the rocket and line it with the explosive material.

       4.) Soak the fuse in gasoline overnight, and then run it into the          explosive lining.

       5.) Place the splintering material inside the explosive lining.

       6.) Construct the model according to the directions in the box, EXCEPT
           FOR ONE NOTABLE CHANGE!­!  Run the other end of the fuse to the back
           end of the Rocket Engine (In other words, to the end where the fire          comes out of...  <grin>)

       7.) Let the glue on the rocket dry.

         
         FiRiNG InStrUcTiOns:

       BE sure to fire the rocket slightly above the intended target, and to      ADJUST THE FUSE LENGTH TO THE CORRECT LENGTH ACCORDING TO HOW FAR AWAY
   FROM THE TARGET YOU INTEND TO BE....    This must be fairly accurate,      therefore, it is good to make 3 or 4 of these to determine the exact length
   of the type of fuse you are using.  This is also an effective weapon for
   anti-vehicle action, because it exposes the most open area of attack to the
   weapon, that being the top.  BE CAREFUL:  No flammable substance should
   come into contact with the weapon before use.  This could lead to premature
   explosion, and i am sure you do not want to lose an arm or a leg from your
   OwN weapon.

             THat'S all FoR NoW!­!­

        Be SuRE to look for FiLeZ by the Minuteman in later editions...
