  Take a medium grade of steel wool and pull a strand out of it.  Attach it to
the ends of two pieces of copper wire by wrapping it around a few turns and
then pinch on a small piece of solder to bind the strand to the wire.  You want
about 1/2 inch of steel strand between the wires.  Number 18 or 20 is a good
size wire to use.  Cut a 1/2 by 1 inch piece of cardboard of the type used in
match covers.  Place a small pile of powdered match head in the center and
press it flat.	place the wires so the steel strand is on top of and in contact
with the powder.  Sprinkle on more powder to cover the strand.	The strand
should be surounded with powder and not touching anything else except the wires
at its ends.  Place a piece of blackmatch in contact with the powder.  Now put
a piece of masking tape on top of the lot, and fold it under on the two ends.
Press it down so it sticks all around the powder.  The wires are sticking out
on one side and the blackmatch on the other.  A single flashlight battery will
set this off.
