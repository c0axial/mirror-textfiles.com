                         MAKING THERMITE
                           BY XCALIBUR

  THERMITE IS A POWERFUL SUBSTANCE WHIC H CAN BURN THROUGH PRACTICALLY
ANYTHING, SAVE TUNGSTEN. IT  IS ESPECIALLY OF USE IN TRYING TO CRACK OPEN A
FORTRESS FONE.   NOW HERE'S HOW YOU MAKE IT. IT IS VERY SIMPLE. THE FIRST STEP
I N MAKING THERMITE IS TO MAKE HEMATITE. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, HEMAT ITE IS IRON
OXIDE (RUST). HERE IS A GOOD METHOD OF MAKING LARGE Q UANTITIES OF RUST. OU
WILL ELECTROLYZE A METAL ROD, SUCH AS A COMM ON NAIL. YOU WILL NEED A SOURCE
OF DC POWER AS WELL. AN ELECTRIC  TRAIN TRANSFORMER IS PERFECT. ATTATCH THEROD
TO THE POSITIVE  WIRE.
                               ^^^^^^^^
THEN PLACE THE ROD AND THE NEGATIVE WIR E IN OPPOSITE SIDES OF A GLASS JAR
FILLED WITH WATER. PUT A LITT LE SALT IN THE WATER, JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT
CONDUCT WELL (A TEASP OON). LET THE SETUP SIT OVERNIGHT. IN THE MORNING, THERE
WILL B E A DARK RED CRUD IN THE JAR. FILTER ALL THE CRUD OUT OF THE WAT ER OR
JUST FISH IT OUT WITH A SPOON. NOW YOU WILL NEED TO DRY  IT OUT. HEAT IT IN AN
IRON POT UNTILL IT ALL TURNS A NICE LIGHT RE D. THE OTHER INGREDIANT YOU WILL
NEED IS ALUMINUM FILINGS. YOU  CAN EITHER FILE DOWN A BAR OF ALUMINUM, OR (AS
I SUGGEST) BUY ALUM INUM FILINGS AT YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE SHOP. (IF YOU BUY THE
BAR USE  NO LESS THAN 94% PURE ALUMINUM. IT IS CALLED DURALUMIN.) THAT 'S
ALMOST IT. NOW, MIX TOGETHER THE RUST AND ALUMINUM FILINGS.  THE RATIO SHOULD
BE 8 GRAMS OF RUST PER 3 GRAMS OF ALUMINUM F ILINGS. THAT'S THERMITE!   NOW,
TO LIGHT IT! STICK A LENGTH OF M AGNESIUM RIBBON IN A PILE OF THE THERMITE.
(EITHER STEAL IT FROM  CHEM LAB OR BUY IT AT YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE. IF
NOT, ORDER FRO M A CHEMICAL SUPPLY HOUSE. IT'S PRETTY CHEAP.) THE RIBBON
SHOULD S TICK INTO THE THERMITE LIKE A FUSE.  NOW YOU LIGHT THE MAGNESI UM
WITH A BLOWTORCH. (DON'T WORRY. THE TORCH ISN'T HOT ENOUG H TO LIGHT THE
THERMITE.) WHEN THE BURNING MAGNESIUM REACHES THE  THERMITE, IT WILL LIGHT.
WHEN THE THERMITE BURNS, GET THE HELL B ACK! THAT STUFF CAN VAPORIZE CARBON
STEEL. IT DOES WONDERS  ON HUMAN FLESH.

                         EXPLOSIVE INFO
                         ==============

  WHEN PETROLEUM JELLY AND POTASSIUM CH LORATE ARE MIXED IN A ONE TO ONE RATIO
BY WEIGHT, IT MAKES A TOTA LY SAFE WET COMPOUND BUT WHEN DRIED IT BECOMES
HIGHLY EXPLOSIVE  AND SHOCK SENSITIVE.

  MIX 3 GRAMS OF POTASSIUM IODIDE AND 5  GRAMS OF IODINE IN A BEAKER WITH 50
ML OF WATER. THEN ADD 20  ML OF AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE [AMMONIA WATER 10%]. FILTER
THIS SUBSTA NCE AND THE RESULTING SOLID IS CALLED NITROGEN TRIIODIDE. WHE N
THIS IS WET IT IS SAFE, BUT WHEN DRY BECOMES VERY EXPLOSIVE AND  SHOCK
SENSITIVE.

 (TO SET OFF ABOVE EXPLOSIVES, PUT THE  MIXTURE ON OR IN SOMETHING THE DROP IT
SORT OF LIKE AN IMPACT BOMB . IT, LIKE A HAND GRENADE, WILL EXPLODE ON CONTACT
WITH ANOTHER OB JECT.)  FOR GREAT SMOKE BOMBS, MIX 4 PARTS SUG AR AND 6 PARTS
POTASSIUM NITRATE (SALT PETER) AND HEAT IT OVER A  LOW FLAME UNTIL IT MELTS.
STIR WELL, THEN POUR IT INTO A CONTAINE R YOU DON'T NEED. BEFORE IT
SOLIDIFIES, PUT A FEW MATHES ON THE  SURFACE AS FUSES. ONE POUND OF THIS
SUBSTANCE WILL FILL A BLO CK NICELY WITH THICK WHITE
SMOKE.

                          Nitroglycerin

HERE IS AN ADDITION TO THE FILE ON EXPL OSIVES IN THE GENERAL SECTION.

NITROGLYCERIN:

*CAREFULLY* MIX EQUAL AMOUNTS OF NITRIC  ACID AND SULPHURIC ACID TOGETHER IN A
GRADUATED CYLINDER OR OTH ER TALL, THIN CONTAINER. SLOWLY ADD ORDINARY
GLYCERIN AND STIR V ERY LIGHTLY. WAIT A WHILE, AND POUR OFF THE LIQUID ON THE
TOP. THI S LIQUID IS NITROGLYCERI N, AND SHOULD BE HANDELED WITH CAUTION. 
WASHING IT WITH SODIUM CARBONATE WILL IMPROVE THE PURITY.

                          HOW TO MAKE:
                              T.N.T
  ---------------------------------------

MIX 170 PARTS TOLULENE WITH 100 PARTS A CID. THE ACID MADE OF 2 PARTS OF 70%
NITRIC AND 3 PARTS OF 100%  SULFURIC. MIX BELOW 30 DEGREES.SET THIS FOR 30 MIN
AND LET IT  SEPARATE. TAKE THE MONONITROTOLULENE AND MIX 100 PART OF I T WITH
215 PARTS OF ACID. THIS ACID IS 1 PART PURE NITRIC AND 2 P ARTS PURE SUL
FURIC. KEEP THE TEMP. AT 60-70 WHILE THEY ARE SLOWL Y MIXED. RAISE TEMP TO
90-100 AND STIR FOR 30 MIN. THE DINITRO TOLUENE IS SEPARATED AND MIX 100 PARTS
OF THIS WITH 225 PARTS OF  20% OLEUM WHICH IS 100% SULFURIC WITH 20% EXTRA
DISSOLVED SULFU R TRIOXIDE, AND 65 PARTS NITRIC ACID. HEAT AT 95 DEGREES FOR
60  MIN. AND THEN AT 120 DEGREES FOR 90 MIN.SEPARATE THE TRINITR OTOLUENE AND
SLOSH IT AROUND IN HOT WATER. PURIFY THE POWDER  BY SOAKING IT IN BENZENE. AND
THATS IT YOU KNOW HAVE TNT.
