THIS IS THE SECOND OF THE NINJA009 SERIES, THE FIRST BEING THE ISSUE: POISON
#1.  I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE FIRST BULLETIN AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE
AS WELL...
 
***WARNING***
AS I KNOW, IN CALIFORNIA, THERE IS A LAW THAT PROHIBITS SMOKE SCREENS.  IF
YOU GET CAUGHT SCREENING UP THE STREETS, DON'T MENTION YOUR MENTOR TO THE
COPS.  AND IF YOU WANT TO BE A NINJA, OR JUST A RAD DUDE, DON'T FUCK AROUND
IN THE WRONG PLACES, AT THE WRONG TIME...
 
 
BACKGROUND ON SMOKE SCREENS:
----------------------------
SMOKE SCREENS WERE USED BY THE NINJA FOR A WAY OF ESCAPING IN TIGHT SITUA-
TIONS.  THE NINJA HAD TWO TYPES OF SMOKE SCREENS.  ONE THAT REQUIRES A FLINT
AND STONE, AND ONE THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY HEAT.  I WILL DESCRIBE THE ONE
WHICH REQUIRES A LITTLE HEAT.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT A HOT DAY IN L.A. ON TOP
OF A BLACK CAR CAN IGNITE THIS SMOKE BOMB.  THE NINJA USED TO CALL THE SMOKE
SCREENS, 'REI SEI NO KIRI', OR SPIRITUAL FOG, OR 'NAGE DAMA' OR HURLED SMOKE.
I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE 'REI SEI NO KIRI' OR SPIRITUAL FOG.  PEOPLE HAVE
THOUGHT OF THE NINJA AS MAGICAL BEINGS, MOST AMERICANS THINK THEY ARE MYTH-
ICAL, BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEARD STORIES FROM FICTIONAL BOOKS.  THE NINJA DON'T
JUST DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR OR WALK THRU WALLS, THEY SPRAY SOME SMOKES TO
HIDE SOME WHERE TEMPORARILY UNTIL THE OPPONENT IS PUZZLED AND LEAVES.  I WILL
DISCUSS SOME OF THESE TECHNIQUES IN THIS ISSUE.
 
 
REI SEI NO KIRI
---------------
THE OLD WAY OF PREPARING THE SMOKE SCLT PETER IS
DISTRIBUTED WELL WITH THE SUGAR.  THEN YOU CAN STO DAMAGE IT.  WHEN YOU MIX IT WELL
ENOUGH, YOU HAVE FINISHED!!!  IF YOU
DO LIGHT THIS SCREEN, BEWARE...YOU ARE RISKING YOUR OWN LIFE.  GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF THERE BUT TRY NOT TO BE SEEN.  TIME THE WICK IF POSSIBLE.  IF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH OF IT GOING IN A ROOM WITH YOUR FAVORITE ENEMY IN IT, IT CAN KILL THE
DUDE WITH 5 MINUTES OF THIS SHIT.  THE THING IS IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET HIS
ASS OUT OF THERE, TOO.  SO JUST KNOCK HIM OUT COLD BEFORE YOU IGNITE THE
SMOKES.  IF HE DOES AWAKE, AFTER THE SMOKE DISSIPATES, HE WILL MOST LIKELY
DIE OF SOME LUNG PROBLEMS.  ANYWAYS, IF YOU WANT HIM TO DIE QUICK WHO GIVES A
DAMN.  BUT, MAKE SURE IF YOU DO THIS DON'T GET YOUR ASS BUSTED.
 
--------------
WAYS OF ESCAPE
--------------
I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ON THIS ISSUE BUT HERE IS ONE WAY OF EVASION.  FIRST
MOST LIKELY WHEN A PERSON GETS IN SOME HEAT NOWADAYS, IT'S GONNA BE ON THE
STREETS.  SO...LOOK FOR A PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN HIDE OUT FOR A WHILE.
LIGHT ONE NEARBY AND WHEN THE SMOKE GOES UP, LOOK DIRECTLY AT YOUR OPPONENT
UNTIL HE IS VERY DIM AND FAINT, THEN MAKE YOUR MOVE.  GO TO YOUR HIDING
PLACE. AND STAY THERE FOR A WHILE.  WHEN YOU THINK THE COAST IS CLEAR, JAM
WHEREVER YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR ASS SAFE.
 
WELL...I HAVE SAID ENOUGH ABOUT  
DATED: 01-16-1985
 
PLEASE DO NOT ALTER THIS PHILE IN ANY WAY.  I WANT THIS PHILE TO BE COMPLETE
AND STAY COMPLETE AS IT IS OFFERED TO MANY CURIOUS MINDS.  YOU MAY SHARE THIS
PHILE WITH ANYONE AND EVERYONE.  BUT THE BEST WAY IS TO KEEP THE SECRETS TO
YOUR SELF.
