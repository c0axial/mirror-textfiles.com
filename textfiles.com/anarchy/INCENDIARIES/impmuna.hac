                                  Cherry Bomb

Materials:

 1. Ping pong ball.
 2. Black powder.
 3. Fuse, at least 5 in.
 4. Nail polish.

Procedure:

 1. Use an ice pick to poke a hole in the ping pong ball, then use a razor
    blade to make a big enough hole to put the black powder in.
 2. Place the black powder in. Probably 3/4 full is best.
 3. Now, insert the fuse into the ice pick hole.
 4. Cover the entire ball with nail polish. This is used to make it louder.
 5. Finally, cover the whole thing with tape, also used for loudness.
