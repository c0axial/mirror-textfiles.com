        With World War III knocking on our door, I feel it is every persons
right to be able to protect and defend his or her's investments. With the
Government making it almost impossible for the average person to have a decent
weapon, I guess that only means that you will have to make them yourself. So,
I've come back with a few more ideas, both serious and prank.

Fire Grenade Launcher
---------------------

        First, you will need a 12 or 16 gauge shotgun. You must mount two
      T=ygs to it and make it like a tripod with the stock being the third
        leg. Take a shell and hacksaw off the front part with the shot in
        it. Place the modified shell in the chamber. Take a long piece of
        circular wood (like a broomstick) and shove it in through the barell.
        Make sure it is at least touching the shell (don't push too hard
        unless you want a broomstick through your head!). Next, mount a
        small rubber platform on the end of the stick. Securely fasten a
        molotov cocktail the the platform (coke bottle filled with gas,
        oil, detergent, and an oily rag in the top). Light the rag and pull
        the trigger. With practice, you can shoot this thing wih amazing
        accuracy.


Explosive Ideas
---------------

        Everyone has made a bomb and just lit it and watched it go boom.
        there are ways to get more out of your boom. If you take something
        like sandbags or bags of cement and lay them on top or on the sides
        of your bomb, the result will be much more damaging and will create
        a smoke screen (if you use something like cement or flour and not
        rocks or sand).


Itching Powder
--------------

        I know this is no Anarchy, but ideas are running low. This, however,
        makes a great practical joke! Get some fiberglass insulation (either
        by punching a hole in your wall and removing it, or by going to a
        construction sight and lifting it). Grind it up good (for large
        amounts, I suggest something like a blender). Now just place this
        pink powder anywhere you wish. This is better than the stuff you can
        buy in the store. I got some asshole in the movies and he itched
        all throughout the show. Don't ask me why I had itching powder in
        the movies, but it did work.


Rain Detination
---------------

        Here's an easy way to let mother nature help you set off a few bombs
        (they must be ELECTRICAL). If it's raining out, place 2 test leads
        into a cup (or 2 wires), each on opposite sides, so that they are
        touching the bottom of the cup. Next place some metalic substance
        (that DOES conduct electricity) in the bottom (not too much! Don't
        connect the wires!). Wire up your favorite bomb around this leaving
        the only break in the circuit in the bottom of the cup. When it rains
        enough, the water will begin to fill cup, mix with the metal, and act
        as a bridge for the electricity. If all was set up correctly, your
        device should go off. In the event of no rain, just use one of those
        Solar Cells (obtainable from Radio Shack) and connect it to a solar
        igniter (this must be a FIRE type bomb with a fuse!). Connect the
        igniter to the fuse, set the bomb in a shady place (that is soon
        to be in the light), and leave. All should go as planned.


Whistler Bomb
-------------

        Do you have one of those asshole coaches in your school always
        blowing that damn whistle at you? If so, here's an idea that will
        shut his ass up for a while. First, make a small batch of your
        favorite friction sensitive explosive (see early "Terrorist Home
        Companion" files written by me and a few other aRu members). Fill
        his whistle up with it (not a whole bunch or he'll notice. Just enough
        so it will make a boom he will never forget. Now, go be an asshole on
        the field and wait for his to give it a good blow. "Gee coach, how did
        you get shrapnel in your face?"


Exploding Pipe
--------------

        So you have that asshole teacher or mean old man on the block who
        smokes a (cough, cough) pipe. Or maybe even your favorite weedhead.
        Steal the guys pipe (like from his car). If it is a good pipe, you
        should be able to pull it into 2 pieces. Clean it out (with a pipe
        cleaner, they're cheap). Run a fuse from the bowl back to where the
        pipe goes back together. Place a small explosive inside the tube
        where the smoke comes through to the mouth and wire it up to the
        fuse. Next, replace the burnt tobacco that was in the bowl and put
        it back where you got it from. "What's wrong, not getting enough
        drag? Maybe you should suck harder. Boom!"
