"Draino Bomb"
--------------    

A Draino Bomb is most commonly used for the complete destruction of cars.  
It is very easy to make, and is totally kitchen improvised.


Components:

[1] Plastic film container (nothing else will work)

[2] Comet

[3] Draino crystals


Procedure:

Fill the film container a little more than 3/4 of the way with Comet.

Fill the rest with the Draino crystals.

Put the lid on the container.


Use:

Take lid from gas tank of victim's car.
Put film container (pre-prepared) in
tank RUN LIKE HELL!!!!!

You will have about 10 minutes to get away after dropping the container into
the gas tank before the entire car blows up just like on TV.


This mixture is easy to make, and very safe to store, but it is extremely
effective.  I have seen it tested many times, and have never been let down.


  U S E   W I T H   C A U T I O N !

  It is a crime to blow up cars!

  ( In case you didn't know....)


             Enjoy!!

"Gunpowder"
-----------

How to make gunpowder
---------------------

Gunpowder is:

75% (or 15 parts) Potassium Nitrate(salt peter)

15% (3 parts) Sulfer (can be taken from
the ends of matches...Chop into a FINE
powder)


(2 parts) CharcoaR (Yes, the shit you put in the Bar-B-Q...also chop finely)


and mix it.......voila!  (Easy, huh?)


"Impact Explosives!"
--------------------    


Impact Explosives are VERY dangerous, so use with caution!

Petroleum jelly (Vaseline, etc..) and Potassium chlorate
mixed in a 50-50 ratio produces an impact explosive that is safe when wet,
but after it dries is HIGHLY shock-sensitive.

---------------------------------------

Mix 3 grams Potassium Iodide and 5 grams liquid Iodine in 50 ml of water,
d(Ammonia water 10%).  This mixture, after it dries, is known as Nitrogen
Triiodide, and is so sensitive (when dry) it has occasionally been set off
by a loud shout in the vicinity.  Keep in liquid form until ready to use, 
then "paint" it over the area or item you want to trap, and when it is
touched.......BOOM!  A fun use for this is to "paint" it on driveways... When a
car comes up.... Or on the driveway on Halloween night... or on car tires..
