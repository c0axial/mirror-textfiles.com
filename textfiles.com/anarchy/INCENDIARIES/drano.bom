  Drano Bombs mad easy, By: The AntiChrist

Ok, this is kinda famous where I come from. We have used these inside schools,
on peoples gardens, houses, and just about everywhere. They can't kill, but
they can really mess up your face and destroy whatever you're wearing.

Step 1- Gather the following materials- Crystal Drano
                                        Aluminum Foil
                                        a) a small plastic soda or Evian 
                                        water bottle. b) Large plastic soda
                                        bottle.

Step 2- Make sure your bottle is filled 2/3 full with water (whatever size
        you use). 

Step 3- Roll up mildly tight foil balls. You should have enough to cover the
        surface of the water. (See diagram)

Step 4- Put the foil balls into the bottle. See the Diagram below. |

                         -------------------

Step 5- Pour the Drano into the bottle until you feel it getting hot.

Step 6- Screw the lid on TIGHT, shake TWICE, and then throw at your target.

        Notes- The time it takes for the gasses to build up depends on how
much Drano is used and the amount of foil used. I have observed the time to
be anywhere from 10 secs. to 1 min. So when I say "Shake it twice", don't
shake it in your hand for two and a half minutes! I have seen these suckers
blow up in people's faces, it isn't funny (ok maybe it's funny, but not 
pretty). The leftover from the bomb is a bubbling acid, which gives off a
gas of some kind. I think it maybe some kind of chlorine gas, I dunno, but
it smells awuful. (It is pure Hydrogen gas. Don't inhale the stuff!)

                --Insert The Lame-Ass Disclaimer Here--
        Ok boys and girls, as always, if you go out and blow off a limb or
splatter you face with acid, or cause any other harm to yourself or others,
the author of this file will take no responsibility in your actions. This
file was written to inform the general public. So I will say it again, the
author is not responsible for any damages that this information might cause.
