*    Some Chemical Reactions     *
**********************************



(1)   Acetic Asid + Acetaldehyde
 =- Small ammounts of Acetic Asid will  -=
 =- cause the Acetaldehyde to Polymerize-=
 =- Thus releasing a great deal of heat -=

(2)   Cupric Sulfate + Cadium Chlorate
 =- Will Explode on Contact             -=

(3)   Mercury (II) Nitrate + Methyl Alchol
 =-Will Form Mercury Fulminate- Explosive  -=

(4)   Stannic Chloride + Turpentine
 =-Flame will be produced and a very    -=
 =- hot Exothermic Reaction will happen -=

(5)   Sodium Nitrate + Sodium Thiosulfate
 =- A mixture od dry chemicles will explode -=

(6)   Sodium + Sufler
 =- Under Right Conditions Will Explode -=

(7) Silver Metel + Tartric Asid
 =- A Explosive mixture                 -=

(8) Potassium Cyanide + Potassium Nitrate
 =- A Potentially High Explosive when Heated -=

(9) Mercury (II) Oxide + Magnisum Metel (mesh 200-600)
 =- Will make a form of flash Powder    -=

(10) Pitric Asid (dry solid)
 =- 3 oz of this shit is equally compaired to 1.5 -=
 =- stick of dyanmite                             -=
