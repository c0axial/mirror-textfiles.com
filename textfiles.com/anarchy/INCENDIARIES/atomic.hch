        Everyone always wonders how hard it must be to build an atomic
bomb, but that is not really the case.  The real hard part is getting the
necessary materials.  To build a basic bomb you first need a quantity of
Uranium-235 or Plutonium.  This can be leeched from the TVA, or you can bribe an underpaid employee of a nearby nuclear plant. If you can get this, you probably won't have any problem getting the other materials.  Next, you will need a hollow, metal
sphere.  Lastly, you will need a quantity of explosive, preferably some
plastic explosives like Plastique, with some time of ignition device.

Instructions:

1.) Under extreme saftey, place the radioactive material in the center of the
sphere (radiation poisoning is not a fun thing- be careful!!!)

2.) Seal up the sphere and use an X-ray machine to check for any fissures or
cracks in the surface of it.  EVEN MINISCULE FISSURES WILL RENDER THE DEVICE
USELESS!!!

3.) Firmly pack the explosive around the sphere and insert the ignition
device.

Your bomb is now ready!  Detonation is best at approximately 1,000-3,000 
feet above the intended target...  the blast ratio is increased tenfold... 
However, for those of you adventurers who want even more of an atomic 
thrill, you can make a hydrogen bomb.  First, you have to do the previous 
steps making a normal atomic bomb.  Next, you will need some type of pump 
device.

InStRuCtIoNs:

1.) Run plastic tubes into the center of the sphere.

2.) Connect the tubes to the pump.

3.) Place liquid hydrogen in the pump device.

4.) Set the ignition device to activate the pump simultaneously as the
explosive goes off.

     Finally, if you are that special kind of stupid that you would actually
try, I wish you luck.  However, I formally deny any responsiblity for the
consequences of your actions.  Otherwise, I couldn't give a flying fuck what

Do not fuck with this.  I didn't write this so some freaking wanna-be hacker
