     Well first of all in order to make a pipe bomb,you must first have a
pipe.  It doesn't matter how big, or how small, you could use a 1 inch
copper pipe,or you could use a 2 foot long drainage pipe.  Once you have
this, you will need a few ingredients first.  These ingredients make a
substance called 'flash powder'.  This can be alot of fun if you make a pile
of it about 1/4 lbs. and have your friend light it with a match (some
friend).  Well, here's what you need:
 
  1> Potassium Clorate(get it at any chem. store)
  2> Powdered Charcoal(not briquets,take some ash from the fire place)
  3> Powdered Magnesium(ground up mag. fire starters from camping sections)
  4> Sulpher(you know where to get this!!!)
  5> Some kind of piping
  6> Hot glue gun,or melted glue
  7> Small drill bit and drill
  8> Tissue paper(ex:kleenex)
  9> Mist water bottle+sprayer(windex bottle,etc..)
 
     The magnesium has to be FINE!!! The finer the faster! You can get them
in the camping sections of Caldor, and Sears. They look like a block of
aluminum on a keychain ($5.00-$7.00 but they go a long way!).

     Now that you have the stuph, start the work.  Find a drill bit about
the size of a pencil point, and dril a small hole about dead center of the
pipe,only drill thru one side of the pipe, don't drill both sides.  Now you
should have a piece of pipe, with a small hole drilled into it.  After this,
take some hot glue(hot glue gun or such).  Take a piece of regular paper
(not tissue) and stuff it into one end of the pipe, so it plugs up the hole,
and is about 2cm into the pipe.  Now fill that end with melted glue over the
paper, so its about even with the pipe, and sit that down on another piece
of paper.  Now you should hav a pipe with a small hole in the center, and
one end wih about 2cm of glue on it, and 2 pieces of paper on either side of
the glue.

     So far so good... now for the flash powder.  Pour in the potassium
clorate (largest amount).  Then pour in the charcoal (a little less than the
clorate). Pour this stuff into a grinding plate, not the pipe. Now for the
magnesium you filed off the block and ground up finally, make this a bit
less that the charcoal ammount.  Lastly add the sulphur, only a little
though, about half as much as the magnesium you just put in.  Now grind all
the ingredients together until they look like 1 grey dust.  Try a little bit
(no not the whole damn thing! save that for the fun l8r!).  Light it and see
how fast it goes off.  Your gonna have to fiddle with it until it turns out
the fastest (sounds like something else eh?).

     Now that you have the flash powder ready, stick a piece of tape over
the small hole you drilled (so nothng spills out!).  Put the pipe over a
sheet of regular paper so you don't loose any of this precious flash powder
and start to poor it into the pipe.  One the pipe seems full, place a piece
of paper over the opening in that end, and pack that piece of paper, and the
powder down into the pipe.

     Take the paper out, and pour more powder in.  Keep doing his until its
very well packed, and its almost full! Make sure that the flash powder fills
above the small hole you drilled! Now put a piece of paper over the powder,
and give it one last pack (a small rod,and a hammer will do just fine! but
make sure you don't getany sparks!!!).  

     After that, pour in your final glue in the end you just packed, make
sure it fills to about 2cm of glue in that end, over the paper!  Stick
another piece of paper over that end (just glued) and let it dry, but whe
drying put it on a flat surface so it hardens flat!

     While your waiting for it to dry, take your tissie paper, and lie it
down flat on the table, over a piece of cardboard or something if its a good
table!! Now mix some water with the flash powder (about 1/2-1/2 mix).  No it
won't kill the powder.  Now shake up the bottle,and spray the tissue paper
with the mixture Let it dry, and repeat the sequence.  After about 4 shots
on 1 side, repeat on the other side (flip the tissue paper). Continue this
until your liking.  When this is done, and the tissue paper is dry, tear/cut
off a small sheet, roll it, and light it.

     If you like it, then fine, if not, then keep spraying it.  If you like
to, befoe rolling it, pour in some flash powder (not too much!!!)tand roll
it like a joint.  Then twist it.  You now have a fuse(really?!?!). Make sure
its long!!

     Now for the final assembly.  Take the tape off the small hole you
drilled, and poke thru the powder with a pencil point/ice pick or whatever
(or the drill bit!).  If you REALLY want to, then put a drop of glue to hold
the fuse in better, but you don't have to!! (not too much!).  Now make sure
the glue has hardened for about 1 hour or so until its rock hard (no
ideas!).

     You are now the proud owner of a home made PIPE BOMB.  Great for
parties/special occasions, weddings, russians, mail boxes and anything else
you want to do. When you light this bomb, point the end in the direction you
are gonna be running in, and don't throw it (unless your crazy, and in that
case, I don't give a shit!) so it doesn't frag in your face!!

    If you really want to fancy it up,you can allways use threaded steel end
caps!!!!!!

     Well I hope you enjoyed your fun today,and happy bomb making!
     Be safe!
