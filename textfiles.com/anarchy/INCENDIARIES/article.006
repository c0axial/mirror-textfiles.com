    The last three chapters have dealt mostly with explosives and related
 items. While it may seem that Incendiaries are kind of basic and do not
 require too much discussion, they deserve mention here for a number of
 reasons. Explosives are an extension od incendiares; they are compounds that
 consume themselves so fast and release their energy so quickly that their
 effect is said to be explosive. Incendiary compounds can conatin just as much
 energy as explosive compounds, they just release it slower. Incendiaries can
 be used to do many things explosives cannot, such as welding and burning holes.
 Pound for pound, Incendiaries are usually more effective than explosives.  This
 unique category of mixtures and compounds, then, has many uses.




                      Preparation of Thermite

   Materials:

             (1)  Cup or large spoon for measuring
             (1)  1 Lb Aluminum Powder (Not coarser than a rough powder)
             (1)  1 Lb Iron Oxide Flakes (Fe3O4, Black Iron Oxide)
             (1)  Jar or can with tight lid
             (1)  Cardboard can w/metal ends (i.e. Comet, Ajax)

   Procedure:

         1. Place Three (3) parts by volume of Iron Oxide and Two (2)
         parts Aluminum Powder into the jar.

         2. Screw the lid on the jar aqnd roll/shake it until the powders
         are mixed completely. The mixture is now ready for use, and may
         be stored indefinately in the sealed container.

       Thermite can be used to weld or burn holes in anything metallic. It burns
   with an intense, white-hot flame and cannot be extinguished until totally
   consumed.  It is somewhat difficult to ignite, as a regular match is not
   nearly hot enough. It is recommended that the Thermite Ignitor mixture
   below be used. Failing that, a 4-6" piece of Magnesium ribbon *can* ignite
   it, though it usually takes several tries and may not always work.
       For burning holes in metal plates and other structures, the following
   technique works well. Take a cardboard can with metal ends (Comet, Ajax) and
   cut it into two section of equal length. Tape the metal ends together, to
   form an hourglass-like container. Trim the bottom section to 2" and cut two
   3/4" notches.  Fill the top tube section to 2/3 with thermite, and fill the
   remainder with the ignitor mixes described below. Prime with a fuse or other
   device. When ignited, this mixture burns extremely fast, and produces a
   white hot slag and showers of burning sparks. The device just described will
   penetrate 3/8" of structural steel.

       For welding metal parts together, the above device, without the bottom
   tube secion, is placed directly against the target surfaces and ignited. The
   molten slag produced can melt and weld just about any metal surface.
       Thermite, while relatively safe to store and handle, burns with
   incredible intensity and produces showers of burning metal flakes, with
   lots of hot gas as a by-product. The white-hot flame can also be very
   painful to look at, and may damage the eyes. Extreme caution is advised in
   experimenting with it.




                         SubIgnitor for Thermite



      This incendiary is used for directly igniting Thermite. It burns with
 intense heat and violence. It can be ignited with the Sugar/Chlorate mixture
 described below.

   Materials:

             (1) Jar or other container with tight fitting lid
             (1) Spoon or scoop

             (1) Aluminum or Magnesium powder (No coarser than table sugar)
             (1) Any one of the following Oxidizers:

              -Potassium Nitrate
              -Potassium Permanganate
              -Sodium Dichromate
              -Potassium Dichromate

   Procedure:

         1.  With a clean spoon or other scoop, place equal quantities
         (1:1 ratio) of metal and oxidizer in the jar.

         2.  Place the lid on the container and roll until the powders are
         completely mixed. The mixture may now be stored indefinately.





                          Sugar/ Chlorate Ignitor

      This mixture is used to ignite the SubIgnitor for Thermite seen above. It
 can be ignited with a simple fuse. It also ignites spontaneously on contact
 with Sulfuric Acid.

   Materials:

             (1) Spoon (Non-Metallic)
             (1) Jar or Container with tight-fitting lid
             (1) Potassium Chlorate
             (1) Granulated Sugar (Not Powdered sugar!)

   Procedure:

         1.  Using the non-metallic spoon, place an equal quantity of Sugar
         and Potassium Chlorate in the container.

         2. Tighten the lidon the jar and slowly roll it until the poders are
         mixed.
            ***Warning! Be sure to remove any mixture clinging to mouth
         of jar before tightening lid. Handle with care, as this mixture is
         sensitive to shock and friction.***

        The mixture is now ready, and can be stored indefinately. Care should
        be taken in its handling, as this mixture can be ignited easily.



     When used as suggested, thermite is a very powerful item. As with any other
  project, one should use the best materials available, and make sure all tools
  and items used are clean. When working with incendiares it is also a good idea
  to have a working CO2 or Dry Chemical fire extinguisher on hand. While
  Thermite and the ignitors cannot be put out, a fire extinguisher can at least
  stop a secondary fire. The Sugar Chlorate mixture is the only one that is
  sensitive to shock and rough handling, and should be treated accordingly.
  Have fun, use this information well and stay out of trouble.
