   Title: Explosives - Thermite
  Author: Battery
Released: 11-7-91
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thermite is a chemical used mainly to destroy pipes, file cabinets, and
heavy equipment.  Thermite is also used for temporary welding, but it has no
finesse, and is not very strong.  Now the part you've all been waiting for...
the formula for it.

    Thermite is composed of magnetic iron flakes and aluminum powder. Thermite
may be obtained as a manufactured item or may be improvised for use in welding
machinery parts together and burning holes in metal structures.  The thermite
reaction is initiated by strong heat and cannot be directly ignited with a
match, lighter, or fuse.  These igniters (found later in this file) are high
heat reactions that are capable of producing the heat needed to set off the
thermite reaction.

    Thermite is very safe to handle and transport because of its high ignition
temperature.  It burns well in cold and windy weather.  Thermite will
penetrate a sealed container and then ignite the contents.  It may be easily
improvised if aluminum and magnetic iron flakes of the appropriate size can be
found.

    Materials and equipment:

    Aluminum powder                      (no coarser than ground coffee)
    Iron oxide flakes                    (Fe3O4 - same size as aluminum)
    Spoon or cup for measuring
    Jar or can with tight fitting lid
    Cardboard can with tight fitting metal ends

    Preparation:

    1. Place three (3) parts by volume of Iron Oxide (Fe3O4) and two (2) parts
       by volume of aluminum powder into the jar.  Fill it about 2/3 full of
       the mixture so that there is enough room for mixing.
    2. Tighten the lid on the jar, turn the jar on its side and slowly roll
       until the two (2) powders are completely mixed.  If you have the time,
       then mix small amounts of the powders in a mortar and pestle, which
       will take hours if you do correctly.  No matter how you mix the
       materials, once it is mixed it will last for months without losing
       effectiveness.

    Application:

    Thermite is used to attack metallic targets such as transformers, electric
    motors, phone areas, gears, boilers, gas storage tank farms, and
    pipelines.  This method produces a quantity of molten metal that streams
    out of the bottom of the unit.  On contact with the target, the molten
    metal will cut through the outer metal casing and pour molten metal on the
    contents in it.  Thermite is not recommended for use on moderate or wooden
    structures or other applications where a constant, persistant flame is
    required.
  
    In order to penetrate a steel plate with the minimum quantity of thermite,
    the bulk of the ignited thermite must be held away from the target during
    the initial combustion period.  This minimizes conductive heat loss (from
    the thermite to the target) during this period and results in the thermite
    attaining maximum combustion temperature.  When that temperature is
    reached, the thermite is dropped molten onto the target, and a hole is
    burned to the innards of the target.

    Cut a cardboard can (having metal ends) into two (2) equal sections.
    Example types of cardboard cartons are AJAX and BON AMI.

    One section of the can must be trimmed to a height of two (2) inches as
    shown.
                Side view: -----||-----
                           |    --    |
                           | A J A X  |
                           |          |
                           ------------

    The other section is filled 2/3 full with thermite.  The thermite is
    covered with one of the igniters mentioned later in the file.
    Put the vented section (illustrated above) face down on the target.
    The metallic end faces up.  The section filled with thermite is placed on
    top of the piece already in place.  Both metal ends are now touching.

    After ignition, the thermite burns a hole through the steel plate,
    dropping extremely hot particles of molten slag into the target.

    Welding:

    A different method is employed to weld materials together.  Instead of
    being mounted several inches above the target, the ajax container is going
    to be placed directly on the target, as illustrated.

    The heat is conducted from the iron oxide onto the two (2) plates and a
    weld is made.

    Igniter:

        Powdered Aluminum/Sulfur Pellets:

    This igniter consists of finely powdered aluminum, sulfur and starch which
    have been thoroughly mixed and shaped into hardened cylindrical pellets.
    The pellet is drilled with a small size drill bit, filled with gunpowder,
    and can be ignited with a match or a fuse.

    Material:
        
        Finely powdered Aluminum (no coarser than powdered flour)
        Finely powdered Sulfur   (same consistency)
        Finely powdered Starch   (same consistency)
        Water
        Cylindrical tube about 4 inches long and 3/4 inch inside diameter
            made of Metal, Wood, Glass, or Plastic.
        Rod which fits into the above tube.
        Rod about 3/8 inch in diameter (should be about one-half the inside
            diameter of the 4-inch long tube)
        Mixing bowl
        Tablespoon
        Teaspoon
        Stove or hot plate
        Knife
        Measuring container

    Preparation:
        1. Place 6 tablespoons of aluminum powder in a mixing bowl then add
           15 tablespoons of powdered sulfur.
        2. Mix the two powders gently with the spoon for a few minutes until
           no unmixed particles of sulfur are visible.
        3. In a separate pot add two teaspoons of laundry starch to about 6
           ounces of water and boil gently for a few minutes.  Stir until the
           starch is dissolved and allow the solution to cool to room
           temperature.
        4. When cool, take about one-half of the starch solution and add it to
           the mixture of aluminum and sulfur powder.
        5. Mix with a spoon until the whole mass is a smooth, evenly mixed,
           putty-like paste.
        6. Fill the cylindrical tube with this paste.  Place one end of this
           tube on a hard surface and tamp the paste with the 3/8 inch
           diameter rod to squeeze out the air bubbles and consolidate the
           paste.
        7. Push the paste out of the tube with the larger diameter rod, which
           just fits the tube, and pushes out a tube of paste.  Cut the
           cylinder into 1 1/2 inch blocks.
        8. Dry these pieces at 90øF for at least 24 hours.
        9. Drill a small hole in one end of the pellets and fill it with
           gunpowder.  In that put a fuse.  Tape the fuse down.

    Use with Thermite:

    A cluster of three pellets should be used.  Bury the pellets in the
    thermite.  Light the fuse and the target will soon be melted.
