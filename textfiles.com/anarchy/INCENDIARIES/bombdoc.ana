Ok, first I must say some legal shit.  Neither I nor my cohorts are responsible in any way shape or form for what you do with this information.  We are not responsible for any damages, physical or otherwise, resulting from the use of this information to construct explosives.  So in other words, when you blow off your damn fool head, don't cry to us to pay your doctor bills.

First, you need to run down to the Jiffy Mart and buy yourself some stuff:

1. Crystal drain-o
2. A plastic pepsi bottle
3. Some water
4. Tin foil

Ok, now all you do is take the Drain-o and dump about one palm-full into the bottom of the bottle.  Then take the bottle and run some water in it, about to the top of the lable.  Now this next step is where the fun starts.  Take a little piece of the tin foil, drop it in, place the cap QUICKLY on the bottle, shake the whole thing, throw it, and then run like a cat out of hell.

Now you should hear an earsplitting explosion (depending on whether you did it right or not).  A few warnings though:

1. Do not be an idiot and use a glass bottle.  It tends to cast razor-sharp shards of death in all directions from what I've heard, but I've never tried it with glass, so if you attempt it, tell me what happens.
2. Get that cap on it, shake it, and drop the motherfucker as fast as you can, or you might be given a new nickname (ie. "Lefty").

Well, that's about it.  Upload this around, and be sure to check with your local law enforcement agency to see if this explosive is legal in your state (yeah, right!).
