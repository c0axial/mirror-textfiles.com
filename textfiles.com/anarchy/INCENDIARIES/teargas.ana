 THERE ARE SEVERAL EYE AND NOSE IRRITANTS ON THE MARKET WHICH CAN BE EASLIY
DUPLICATED.  A GOOD IRRITANT IS FORMALDEHYDE, BETTER KNOWN AS EMBALMING FLUID,
IT SMELLS HORRIBLE AND HURTS THE EYES AND NOSE.  IT ALSO VAPORIZES ON CONTACT
WITH AIR TO MAKE A ROOM UN- INHABITABLE FOR HOURS.  IT CAN BE SQUIRTED FROM A
WATER PISTOL OR NASAL INHALER, POURED ON THE FLOOR OR VAP- ORIZED BY A BOMB
DESCRIBED IN THE STINKUM FILE.	FORMALDEHYDE CAN BE BOUGHT AT THE DRUG STORE
UNDER THE PRETEXT OF WANTING IT TO PRESERVE MICE OR OTHER LAB SPECIMENS.

 THE IRRITANT MAILMEN USE AGAINST DOGS AND WHICH IS SOLD WIDELY FOR SELF
DEFENSE IS OLEORESID CAPSICUM.	CAPSICUM IS HOT ESSENCE OF RED PEPPERS.
OLEORES- IN IS THE PROCESS FOR EXTRACTING IT.  TO EXTRACT THE CAPSICUM, GRIND
UP FOUR OUNCES OF RED PEPPER SEEDS IN A BLENDER OR WITH A MORTAR AND PESTLE.
RED PEPPER SEEDS ARE BOUGHT AT THE GROCER'S.

 THE DRY, GROUND SEEDS ARE THEN PUT INTO A COFFEE PERCOLATOR IN WHICH THERE IS
ABOUT 16 OUNCES OF ALCOHOL, PREFERABLY WITH THE WATER DISTILLED OUT.  THE SEEDS
ARE THEN PERCOLATED FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR.  THE ALCOHOL IS THEN DISTILLED OFF
UNTIL THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF TABLE SPOONS OF RED LIQUID LEFT IN THE FLASK.
THE RED LIQUID IS THEN ADDED TO A HALF PINT OF LIGHT MINERAL OIL, BOUGHT AT A
DRUG STORE.

 IT CAN BE SPRAYED FROM A NASAL SPRAY.	ANOTHER GOOD WAY IS WITH A WINDOW
CLEANING SPRAYER BOUGHT AT ANY DIME STORE.  THE TUBE OF THE SPRAYER IS CUT TO
FIT IN A TWO OUNCE MEDICINE BOTTLE.  THIS WAY YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF THE GOODY TO
LAST THROUGH A WHOLE DEMONSTRATION, NO MATTER WHICH SIDE YOU'RE ON.  IT IS ALSO
NICE TO KEEP BY THE DOOR OR BY YOUR COMPUTER TO REPEL INTRUDERS.  INTRUDERS =
BELL SECURITY!
