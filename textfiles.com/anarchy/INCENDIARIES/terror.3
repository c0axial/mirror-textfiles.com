Dept. Store Fun
---------------

        Most department stores have those little clamp on deals that they
stick
        on clothes to keep people from stealing them. Do what you must do to
        get one of these (a friend who is employed there, hold the place up,
        whatever). Find some lady with 3-5 kids, a stroller, a huge purse and
        lots of other stuff that would make her look suspicious. Stumble by
and
        plant this little devices in one of her pockets and wait by the exit.
        when she walks out.. Bells! Cops! the works.. And to top it all off,
        one embarrased lady! Another way is to take the thing home and rip the
        little metal thing out of it (looks like a piece of card board with
        metal wrapped around it). Place it deep in your wallet or in your
pants
        and wait around by the entrance. When you see the same type of person
        going out, you go in! Same effects. Only problem is, you have to get
        back out! I suggest just leaving the little prize on someone in the
        store and leaving (don't hang around, or do it at the same store
twice,
        the Cops may get suspicious of you).

Street Fun
----------

        Take some fishing line and run it across the street. Next, hang rocks,
        bolts, sinkers, etc. at windshield level. Find a telephone pole or a
        tree to run it across on. Another thing to do is to use light string
        to tie 2 garbage cans together and run the string across the street.
        If you can't figure out what that does, you shouldn't be reading this
        file!

Bolt Bomb
---------

        Take a bolt, 2 washers, and 2 nuts. Screw on the first bolt, place a
        washer after it. Put gun powder on the washer, put the next washer on,
        and screw on the last nut so that the nut is hanging out past the end
        of the bolt and the 2 washers are pushed together. Drop the bolt on
the
        bottom nut and it will explode. Nothing big, but it is re-usable.
Kinda
        like the space shuttle. Uh, scratch that last part.

Spoke Gun
---------

        Take a bicycle spoke and that little nut that holds it onto the rim.
        Screw the spoke into the the nut a little bit. Powderize a match head
        and push it into the nut. Pack a wad of paper into the nut with
another
        spoke. Hold the device from the end that doesn't have the screw on it
        and then hold a flame under the nut. When it gets hot enough, it will
        blow up and send the paper flying. This is small scale. If you wanted
        to, you could use a piece of threaded rod and a 1 1/2 inch long nut to
        make the results a little more interesting. You can even add your own
        projectiles. Just be sure that the paper is in tight enough to compact
        the powder.

Flour & Gas
-----------

        Take a new bag of ordinary household flour and pour gas on it. Light
        it and drop it off of something high onto a hard surface. No
explosion,
        but it gives a nice efect. Kinda like an Atomic Bomb.

PineSol & Cl
------------

        Wrap some cholrine up in a paper towel and tie it up tight. Next, tape
        it high on the inside of a Mayonaise jar (See illus. 'A'). Fill the
        bottom of the jar up (don't touch the paper!) with PineSol. Screw the
        top back on and place it on the ground. When ready, knock the jar over
        and run like a bat out of hell (haul the mail, cruise, mobeelin', bust
        ass, do what you have to do, just get away!). It will explode, and
        release alot of chlorine gas. Don't breathe it in! It will kill you!

                     |.'.'.'.'| <-
                     \________/ <-


Hefty Gas
---------

        Fill a hefty bag with gas from a gas stove. Tape a fuse to it and
light         it. Have a book of matches at the end of the fuse to insure
ignition.
        Woof! No more hefty bag! Or if you want to add some fun to it, forget
        the fuse and just shoot bottle rockets at it. Same effect.

Door Shock
----------

        For this, you will need a 12 volt transformer. Strip about 1 inch off
        of the end of each wire. Run the wires out of your bedroom door. Place
        some electrical tape on the bottom of the outside door knob and then
        tape the bare wires down so they won't touch. Disguise the wires so
        they won't look suspicious. Turn on the transformer and wait for a
        victim. This is the ultimate in privacy protection devices. Don't
        use more than 12 volts. You can kill somebody.


Auto Annihilator
----------------

        You owners of pick up trucks are already in possesion of urban assault
        vehicles. All you need is some nice size rollable objects, some cord,
        and some duct tape. Tape over the latch that hold the tailgate shut.
        Tie a cord from the inside of the cab to the tailgate to hold it
        closed. Now, put a bowling ball, shopping cart, tire, large diameter
        steel pipe, etc. in the bed of the truck. It must be large enough to
        roll over the gap between the tailgate and the bed. So now your
        cruising along the interstate at 65mph and some prick pisses you off.
        Just pull ahead of him, floor it, and release the tailgate cord.
        Now look in the rearview mirror. Where is the asshole? Oh, that's him
        spinning out of control with a grocery cart stuck in his grill. Or
        is that him over there in the ditch along side of the road. No!
        wait! that's him speeding up to catch you! No problem. You were smart
        enough to have a few more goodies tied to another cord, like a bowling
        ball. Let her rip! Wham! Yeah, that's him with the broken steering
        rods smashing into the divider. I knew he was back there somewhere.
        Try it going up a steep hill or a bridge to take out more happy
        motorists.


Flare Fun
---------

        Take the glass off of a light bulb and fill it with the yellow
        make from grinding up the inside of a road flare. Tape the glass
        back on and screw it back into the socket. Give a new meaning to
        the "Red Light" district.


Non-Handymans Bomb
------------------

        Go to the nearest auto parts store and pick up a pack of road flares
        and an aerosol can of starter fluid. Take the flare and duct tape it
        to the can so that the first inch or so of the flare will burn with
        out touching the side of the can. When you wanna blow it up, use the
        handy little scratch-n-start piece of the flare and let it blow.
        Not too difficult, eh?


Fun With Cyano
--------------

        You call it superglue, we call it fun. Any Cyanoacrilate glue will
        do the job. It is the best prankster material ever produced by a
        manufacturer. Here are a few ideas to get you started. Glue the door
        to the school shut. Glue car doors, car locks, and car trunks. Glue
        money to the floor at the mall. On a busy day at the mall, put some on
        a coin and roll it infront of some lozers. It won't dry until it hits
        their skin because it needs moisture to dry. Spill some on your
enemies
        pants. Glue the dictionary shut. Glue books to the table at the
          library. Glue windsheild wipers down. Glue gaps caps on. The
        possibilities are endless. Cyano takes a while to dry on metal
        surfaces. When you put a few drops of cyano in baking soda or on saw
        dust, it turns to a rock hard substance. Fill the desired spot with
        the powder, and apply as much glue as necessary.
