THE BULLSHIT:This information is solely for educational purposes only. The
             author is not responsible for any of the actions of the reader
             that result from him/her reading this text file!

Now for the facts:
             The assembly of an M-80 Firecracker is illegal in the United
States and is punishable by law. It is also illegal to sell explosives to
people without a permit that allows a person to do so! I am not familiar with
what the authorities will do if they catch you doing something that is
described in this text file,but I'm sure that it could,at least,ruin your
weekend if not ruining your life by having a felony on your records!

*Supplies*

**********
*Assembly*
**********

1.  Put 1 drop of glue on the inside of one end of the tube and insert the
paper end plug.

2.  Punch or drill a 1/8" hole in the side of the paper tube.

3.  Cut the fuse you purchased into 2" long pieces.

4.  Insert the fuse into the hole in the paper tube and glue in place.

5.  Scoop the paper tube with the fuse into a container of flash powder. The
paper tube should be about 2/3 full.

6.  Put glue on the end plug and insert it into the paper tube filled with
flash powder.

7.  The completed M-80 firecracker should dry and the glue will become hard in
30-45 minutes.

**********************
*Flash Powder Formula*
**********************

Sensitive to friction and impact. High Explosive!

Potassium Perchlorate     2 lbs.
Aluminum Powder           1 lb.

There must be a 2 to 1 ratio of Potassium Perchlorate to Aluminum Powder in
order for the flash powder to be good. It must also be mixed well.

Suggested Price for the M-80's
You can make up your own price,but here are some prices.

2 for $1.00   11 for $5.00   24 for $10.00   50 for $20.00   100 for $40.00

Some people can make a fortune off these things,if they can front the money to
buy all the stuff and if they can find people who want to buy them.

DO NOT ADVERTISE! I repeat-M-80's are illegal and the cops will bust you if
they catch you selling these things.

If you can not contact any of the companies for materials needed,you should
look in the classified section of Soldier's of Fortune magazine for fireworks
companies. Order their catalogs. Many sell tubes,end plugs,fuses,and sometimes
even chemicals. More text files to come in the future!

                                Play it safe and don't get caught!
