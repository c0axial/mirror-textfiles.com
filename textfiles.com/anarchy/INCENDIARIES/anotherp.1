OPERATION:
---------
 
To detonate, simply throw... It will sit for a while, as the Sulfuric Acid
seeps through the fibers. When it reaches the KCLO3/Sugar mixture, it will
flare up... It is fastest upside down, a tad slower sideways. You may wish
to create a delay dependent on your personal needs. You simply decide upon
the thickness (amount) of the fibers.  ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE THAT YOU CARRY
THIS BOMB BY THE HANDLE YOU INSTALL ON TOP!  Otherwise if it is tilted too
much  you may end up with a surprise.  You may want to reinforce it  still
with thick, strong tape such as duct tape or fat electrical tape...
 
 
* Note: The Barium Nitrate is not required but will enhance the explosion.
        (In other words it makes it more big, bright, fun and exciting)
