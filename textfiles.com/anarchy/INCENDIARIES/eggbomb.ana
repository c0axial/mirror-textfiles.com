	 HOW TO MAKE A TIMEBOMB
***************************************

  MAKING A TIMER IS EASIER THAN MANY PEOPLE MAY THINK.	THE ONLY THINGS YOU WILL
NEED ARE:

   1. A CLOCK WITH HANDS
   2. WIRE
   3. A BATTERY
   4. SOME FILAMENT WIRE


  PHIRST, IF THE CLOCK HAS A PLASTIC COVER OVER THE PHACE, BREAK IT OFF.  WHAT
YOU DO NOW IS TAKE TWO LONG WIRES AND ATTACH ONE TO THE MINUTE HAND OR HOUR HAND
(NOT BOTH) AND THE OTHER PERPENDICULAR TO THE PHACE.  THE PURPOSE HERE IS TO
SHORT OUT THE WIRES AS THE HANDS SWING AROUND TO THE DESIRED TIME.

  ONCE YOU HAVE THIS DONE, SOLDER ONE WIRE TO THE POSITIVE (+) END OF THR
BATTERY, FILAMENT WIRE TO THE NEGATIVE (-) END OF THE BATT.  AND THE OTHER WIRE
TO THE OTHER END OF THE FILAMENT WIRE.

  NOW, WHEN THE DESIRED TIME COMES UP, THE WIRES WILL SHORT OUT, HEATING THE
FILAMENT WIRE AND BURNING WHATEVER FUSE YOU MAY HAVE ON IT LEADING TO THE
EXPLOSION OF YOUR PHAVORITE BOMB.

  NOTE:  IF YOU CAN'T FIND FILAMENT WIRE, YOU CAN USE SOMETHING ELSE, LIKE STEEL
WOOL.  REMEMBER IN SURVIVAL TRAINING WHEN THEY SHOWED YOU HOW TO BURN STEEL WOOL
WITH JUST A PHEW BATTERIES?  SAME PRINCIPLE.

  ***** ATTENTION:  BE JUST LIKE YOUR PHAVORITE HOLLYWOOD ACTOR:  SEND E-MAIL
FOR A SCHEMATIC OF A FULLY ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THIS TIMER!!

E-MAIL, SUBPOENAS, ETC.. SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO:

   Note from Mortician:

  This is a very good meathod.	I have used it a couple of times.  You can do
the same thing with an egg timer, except an egg timer has a max.  time limit of
an hour.  Make sure that the filiment wire will ignite the fuse before you set
it all up because a lit of the time the wire will not heat up.	Your best bet
for batteries is two nine volt one with the neg from the first hooked up to the
pos from the second.  Then use the two remaining terminals.

    A good meathod, also pretty safe.
