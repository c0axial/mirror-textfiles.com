        Good. Now that that's overwith, here's how to build the brick.

Materials                             Parts by Volume
        Powdered Potassium chlorate          40
        Powdered Sulfur                      15   
        Granulated Sugar                     20   
        Iron Filings                         10   
        Wax(Bee's or candle)                 15   
        Spoon
        Brick Mold
        Red Paint
        Measuring cup or can
        Double Boiler
        Heat source

Preparation
        1. Fill the bottom of the double boiler with water and bring to
        a boil.

        2. Place the top half on top of the bottom half and add the wax,
        sulfur, sugar, and filings in the proper amounts.

        3. Stir well and blend all the materials evenly.

        4. Remove the upper half of the double boiler and place away from 
        heat source.

        5. CAREFULLY add the required amount of potassium chlorate and stir
        again to obtain a homogenious mixture.
        
        6. Pour the mixture into the brick mold and let it cool and harden. 

        7. Paint red to simulate a real brick.

Detonation.

        1. Short time delay fuse can be used, as well as Sugar-Chlorate.

                That's about it. IF enough are placed in the 
                right places in a foundation, and detonated,
                there goes the building. More destruction 
                              from GÌD later.
