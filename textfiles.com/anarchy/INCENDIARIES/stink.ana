STINKUM FROM THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND
  BY KURT SAXON TYPED BY THE PENGUIN

IRON SULFIDE IS SOLD FOR $.35 FOR ONLY
1/8TH OF AN OUNCE. EASIER TO MAKE AND
JUST AS POTENT AND COSTING ABOUT $.50
A QUART IS AMMONIUM SULFIDE. IT STINKS
TO HIGH HEAVEN LIKE ROTTEN EGGS AND NO
ONE CAN STAND TO STAY AROUND IT ONCE IT
HAS BEEN SPILLED ON THE FLOOR OR VAPOR-
IZED BY AN EXPLOSION.

TO MAKE SOME, YOU MIX 4 OUNCES OF SULFE
R WITH 8 OUNCES OF HYDRATED LIME
IN A STEW POT. A QUART OF WATER IS
ADDED AND THE MESS IS HEATED AND
STIRRED UNTIL THE SULFER HAS COMPLETE-
LY BLENDED. THE HYDRATED LIME WILL SINK
TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN AND THE YELLOW
LIQUID IS THEN POURED OFF INTO A BUCKET

TAKE THE BUCKET OUTSIDE, IF YOU HAVE
ANY SENSE,
