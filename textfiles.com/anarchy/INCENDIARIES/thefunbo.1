	You've seen the headlines where they say "Carbide bomb wipes out entire
building complex." Well now, you can be the guy behind the scenes who gives
newspaper journalists a chance to keep their jobs. The chemical behind all of
this is calcium carbide.
 
	Calcium carbide; is a chemical that when mixed with water, releases an
ugly cloud that smells like the day Godzilla farted, and will explode violently
on contact with an open flame. Calcium carbide should be purchased from garden
supply stores in the form of Go-Fer-Gas;. It is best to buy it in a gopher-
infested area like San Lorenzo, California, the Gopher Capital of the World.
Go-Fer-Gas is calcium carbide. It gases out all the gophers, which is a cruel
thing to do. If you know where the guy who invented the stuff lives, blow up
his house for me, will you? Thanks.
 
And now, the bombs:
 
Stink Bomb
 
	To make a stink bomb, you take a few ounces of calcium carbide and put
it into a plastic bag. Take a piece of sponge and put it in the top of the
plastic bag, then tie a string or baggie tie around it, the tightness depending
on the delay that you want. You fill a tin can half way with water, and when
the time comes, you put the plastic bag, sponge end down, into the bag. The
water will seep through the sponge eventually and react with the carbide. A gas
and heat reaction will disintegrate the plastic bag and an ugly, stinking cloud
will come forth.
 
	It is a good idea to do this in a movie theater, because it is dark,
and probably no one will be smoking. You smuggle in the tin can of water, and
the bag of carbide. It is a good idea to cover the can with a piece of plastic
wrap, held on with a rubber band, so it won't spill everywhere. Also, you may
just want to ask for a glass of water at the refreshment stand (or at least a
cup, and fill it up at a drinking fountain), and use that instead, however the
bag may not fit. There are many other uses for this stink bomb, and I'm sure
many places you have in mind, so go to it, and have fun.
 
Carbide Bomb
 
	To make a carbide bomb, you take a few pounds of calcium carbide and
put it into a plastic bag, as in the stink bomb. You drop the bag into a toilet
and get the hell out of the building or house. Any cigarette, pilot light or
other open flame will blow the crap out of everything. And once the reaction
begins, it absolutely can not be stopped. If some jerk tries to pull a heroic
act and flush the toilet, it would probably make things worse.
 
	The whole area is quickly filled with gas, and the entire place will be
blown to hell if the gas is lit. If there is a guy in the stall next to you who
is smoking a cigarette, and if he won't extinguish it at your request, drop the
bomb in the toilet and get out of the building. That always takes care of rude
people.
 
	To demolish an entire apartment or office building, simply pour a
couple pounds of carbide into the toilet while it is being flushed. The buildup
of gas would make the pipe system back up and every apartment or office on that
line would fill up with the gas. Whew! Wouldn't that be exciting? This would be
completely catastrophic to a house. The pilot light on the water heater or
furnace would ignite the gas, and enough pressure might be there to knock down
the walls!
 
	Keep in mind also that calcium carbide is a fairly safe chemical to
work with, nothing like nitroglycerine or nitrogen triiodide, but do not avoid
exercising caution when handling chemicals or detonating anything.
