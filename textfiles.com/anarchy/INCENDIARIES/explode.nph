   Topic ..................... How To Properly Use Explosives
   Author .................... Compilation phrom several sources
   Compiler .................. Nocturnal Phoenix

       This is one of a series of compilations I am creating of the
       various techniques used to perphorm actions that aught not be
       perphormed (but will be done anyway, so why not do it right?).
       I am expecting to have maybe ten or so of these compilations
       by the time I am done.  I realized the need phor some phorm of
       organization of this sort of inphormation when I came across
       phour meg of shit like this.  Out of that phour meg, two meg was
       totaly redundant, one meg was corrupted to the point of not
       being able to read it, and of the other meg, everything that
       was actually usephul was scattered everywhere in bits and pieces.
       Now I personally am a strong proponant of peacephul world Anarchy,
       but I would really rather not try to make something phun like
       nitroglycerin (to use something extremely dangerous that I saw
       phrequently in all that shit) without having a complete set of
       instructions.  Whenever it was possible, I have given credit to
       the author of the original article, although I phound many
       articles which were the same, word phor word, but with dipherent
       authors, phorcing me to chose one of them.  Sorry if I chose
       wrong.

       The compiler of this phile apologizes to the authors of the
       articles within phor any alterations done to their documents.
       This was unavoidable, as most of these texts were nearly 
       unreadable by the time I got them.  I assume this is due to
       various changes made by people who had been in possesion of
       them bephore me, and to the slow corruption of the data as it
       was sent over innumerable fone lines phrom modem to modem. To
       avoid the phurther corruption of this inphormation, I would
       ask two things:

          1. That any comments, notes, additions, etc. be placed at
             the very end of this phile, not just stuck wherever you
             pheel like it.  I have put a sample addition in at the
             end of this file for convenience.  Please leave:
                -  Your name (your phake name that would be used phor
                   BBS' and such, not your real name)
                -  The date
                -  Where you can be reached (BBS' etc.)
                -  The inphormation you wish to leave
          2. That any random corruptions phound while reading (such
             as the word "EXPLOSIVES" appearing as "EXPLO´IVES") are
             phixed (I'm sure that some smartass will be tempted to
             phix the example I have just given.  Please don't).

       Thank you phor your cooperation in this matter.  Please give
       this phile to whoever you can, knowing that it will probably
       have grown substantially by the next time you phind it.  Also,
       when you do phind it again, and it is a newer version than you
       have, delete the older version and only distribute the newer
       one.

                               Tamping
                               -------


        Tamping is nothing more than an operation performed before the
explosion, to regulate and direct the destructive power of the explosion.
In other words, if a pound of black powder is ignited with a match, the
explosion will occur but most of the destructive force will take the path
of the least resistance - into the atmosphere. Now, if the same pound of
black powder was placed within a steel pipe, and sealed at both ends, except
for a tiny hole for the fuse, the explosion could be regulated with ease.
This tamping operation is necessary for any forms of demolitions in order
that the operation be successful. A stick of dynamite placed on a concrete
roadway untamped, when exploded will create a very small crater, perhaps a
few inches. If this same stick of dynamite were tamped, by placing several
sandbags on top of if and around it, the explosion would create a much
greater crater. This tamping operation is absolutely necessary for the
demolition of a large structure or building.
        Tamping with sandbags can and should be used if at all possible,
since the extent of the damage is multiplied several times by the addition
of the sandbags. Tamping can be useless if you are on a silent lightning
fast mission. In the case of railroad tracks, a two-pound charge of TNT
carefully placed between the switch and rail will almost certainly do the
trick without tamping. The best procedure when engaged in this type of
sabotage is to repeat the acts every three-quarters of a mile or so, so as
to delay the repair and create confusion.

[1> When attempting to sever a steel rod or pole, through the use of
    explosives, place a charge on each side, leaving a small gap between
    the butts of the explosives.
[2> When cutting a chain, place the explosive charge on one side and tape it
    securely into place.
[3> When cutting any odd-shaped object, the best explosive to use is
    plastique because of its flexibility.
[4> When cutting heavy metal cables, use plastique. The compound should
    be placed all around the cable that is to be cut, about a half-inch
    thick.
[5> When sabotaging railroad tracks with explosive, use plastique if
    available, since this is the easiest substance to use when trying
    to sever objects or irregular shapes.
       [A> The most common way of cutting train tracks is by placing a
           charge of high explosives on either side of the "I" beam track,
           so as to have the forces of the two explosions act upon each
           other, thus causing the middle object maximum destruction.
       [B> Another method which has proven equally effective is placing a
           charge between the rail and the switch. The switch is one of the
           weakest points along the line, and a relatively small charge will
           not only sever the switch and rail, but will also rip up the ties
           and the railroad bed.

                       Release Of Pressure Detonators
                       ------------------------------


        The next type of detonating device I will discuss is called a
release-of-pressure mechanism. This device employs exactly the same
principles as the pressure-trigger device, except in reverse. The movement
of the pressure plate, rather than down, is now up. This can be used
effectively when a weight is placed on the pressure plate. Then when it is
removed, the explosives will be ignited. To construct, use a heavy-duty
spring beneath the first metal plate. Connect a wire from the blasting cap
to the first metal plate. The second wire is then stretched from the bottom
of battery "A", to the second metal plate. The third wire is run from the
electrical blasting cap to the top of battery "B". When this is accomplished,
the booby trap is fully cocked. When the weight on the pressure plate is
remove, the spring will will force the second metal plate against the first,
thus completing the electrical circuit and exploding the device.
        In a tension-release booby trap, when the tension, resulting from a 
wire pulling on a pliable metal strip, is released, the metal strip will snap
back into another metal strip. Since the wires from the batteries and
blasting cap are connected to either metal strip, when they touch, the
circuit will be complete and it will detonate the explosive charge. This
type of detonator is especially effective when attached to drawers, doors,
or any movable object.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              
                           Placement Of Charges
                           --------------------


        In demolition work, the greatest problem is the actual placement of
the charges. When an individual is working on a large structure such as a
building or a bridge, it is imperative that he have an understanding of the
directional force of explosives, and the structure's weaknesses. These
large-type structures are built to bear up under abnormal stress, so the
chances are good, unless the charges are placed correctly, that the sabotage
will have little or no effect.
        When attempting the demolition of a building, the first thing to do
is to determine the weakest point in the structure. This is the point where a
charge can be placed and well-tamped, and will result in maximum destruction.
A large building will usually take more than just one charge. The best bet
is to place large explosive charges on either side of a weak point in the
foundations. These charges should be tamped from the outside, so as to drive
the force inward.
        There are several methods of planting explosives. The advantage to
most of the ones listed below is that they have a natural tamping factor,
built-in.

[1> Bury the explosive beneath the object of destruction.
[2> Drill a bore hole into the object and fill with explosives.
[3> Form a brace to hold the explosives tight against the object of
    destruction. A good brace can be made from wood placed on a diagnal,
    with one end jammed into the ground.
[4> Place a charge out in the open, with the tamping material surrounding it,
    and directing its force.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                              
                     Basic Formulas For Demolitions Use
                     ----------------------------------


[1> Computation for minimum safety distance with TNT
    For charges less then 27 pounds, the minimum safety distance is 900
    feet. Over 27 pounds, the minimum safety distance is 300 times the
    cubic root of the number of pounds of TNT

[2> Steel cutting
     When cutting, with explosives, part of a steel structure, determine
     the area in square inches of the member to be cut. This area is then
     labeled "A". Use the formula "P = 0.375 x A", where "P" equals The number
     of pounds of TNT necessary.

[3> Steel cutting
    When a steel member is not part of a greater structure, a different
    formula is used. This is based on the diameter of the individual member.
    Use the formula " P = Dý ", where "P" equals The amount of TNT required
    and "D" is the diameter of the piece of steel.

[4> Train rails
    To cut rails that weigh less then 80 pounds, use one-half pound of
    TNT. To cut rails that weigh over 80 pounds, use a full pound of TNT.

[5> Timber cutting
    When the charge is to be external and untamped, the formula used is
    "P equals C cubed divided by 30", where "P" equals The pounds of
    plastique required, and "C" equals the circumference of the tree in
    feet.
    When figuring an internal tamped charge, the formula used is "P equals
    D squared divided by 250", where "P" equals the pounds of plastique,
    and "D" equals the diameter of the tree in inches.

Some Important Principles
        A basic rule to follow in all calculations having to do with
explosive compounds is to round off the amount to the next highest unit
package. At times you may use a little more than necessary, but you will
be assured of success. Another rule when calculating charges is to add
one-third more explosives if you do not intend to tamp. If a formula is
given for plastique (composition 4), as was done for both timber-cutting
formulas, you are able to compute poundage in TNT by adding one-third to
the weight of the plastique.
        When using the principle of cratering to destroy a paved surface with
explosives, use several charges rather than just one. The use of a bore hole
is especially effective here. It is pointless to attempt cratering a roadway
without tamping, since most of the destructive force of your charge will go
straight up in the air.

                           Safely Using Explosives
                           -----------------------


        Bombs and booby traps incorporate more than just technical knowledge,
they are based on human nature. To create an effective booby trap, one must
have a primitive insight into his enemy's actions, thoughts, and methods. 
Before I get into the nitty-gritty of constructing booby traps, bombs, land
mines, grenades, etc., it is important explain the basic working principles 
and mechanisms behind these devices.
        In the acquisition of equipment I would recommend purchasing or
stealing, rather than making your own. Manufactured equipment is much safer
to work with, and usually more effective. Once you have your explosive
compounds, you will need a way to set it off, or detonate it. With all high
explosives, you will need a detonator or blasting cap, unless you decide to
lace the fuse into the explosive, although this is not recommended. A
blasting cap is a low explosive compound that is connected to a high
explosive, for the purpose of detonating it. There are two types of blasting
caps - electric and nonelectric.
        To use a nonelectrical blasting cap, one gently pushes the fuse into
the hollow end, until it is fully in. He then crimps the hollow metal end
around the fuse, and puts it into the high explosive. When the fuse burns
down it ignites the flash charge. That in turn explodes the priming charge,
which detonates the base charge, and finally creates enough heat to set off
the high-explosive charge. The fuse is ordinary safety fuse or detonating
cord.
        When the fuse is put into the blasting cap, it is necessary to seal
it. This act of sealing is called crimping. When involved with this sort of
thing, one must use the standard safety precautions set down in the previous
section. Crimpers look like a pair of pliers, and their function is very
similar, although pliers cannot be used for crimping. With the crimper in
your right hand and the blasting cap in your left, slowly squeeze the hollow
end of the blasting cap until it is firmly against the fuse. Use care so that
you do not squeeze the charge within the cap, as this may detonate it.
        Whereas nonelectrical blasting caps are functional and have proven
that they can be relied on, electrical blasting caps offer a much greater
variety of uses. The basic principle of the electrical blasting caps is that
an electrical charge moves through an insulated wire until it reaches a small
section of that same wire which is not insulated and which is surrounded by
a primary flash charge. The heat from the electrical charge will explode the
flash charge, which in turn will set off a series of minor explosions,
finishing up with the high explosive.
        Both types of blasting caps should be placed within the high
explosive itself. This is easy when working with plastique or a pliable
surface. Manufactured TNT has a small hole designed at the top for just
this reason, but in dynamite one has to make his own hole. This hole should
be made with a wooden or nonsparking metal object. The ends of the crimpers
are ideal. The hole can be made in one of two ways: the first is bored
carefully and gently straight down from the top of the stick, to exactly
the length of the cap itself; the second type of hole is made from the side
in a downward diagnal direction. Both of these methods have proven effective.
        Another method priming dynamite, which is not as reliable as either
nonelectrical or electrical blasting caps, is called "lacing". The principle
behind most detonating devices is simply to create a temperature which is hot
enough to ignite the high explosive. This increase in temperature can be 
accomplished with a relatively good degree of success by weaving the fuse
throughout the high explosive so that, as the fuse burns down, the heat
created from the burning process it captures and held within the high
explosive until the detonation temperature is reached.
        There are different methods of lacing, depending on what type of high
explosive you happen to working with. For dynamite, the most common and most
functional method is to literally sew the detonation cord into the stick.
This preparation entails the individual's making several holes directly 
through the dynamite itself. This hole-making should be performed just as
the planting of the blasting cap was handled. The holes must be dug gently
and slowly with a nonmetallic instrument. "Lacing" should be done only when
there is no alternative, and blasting caps are not available.
        When using TNT, you can lace it by wrapping the detonating cord
around the body of the explosive at least five or six times, and then tying
it off with a clove hitch. This will result in a great amount of heat being
transferred into the TNT from the fuse, and its detonation.
        Plastique can also be ignited in this fashion, by employing a heavy-
duty detonation cord, and tying a double knot in one of its ends. This large
knot is then buried deep in the center of the composition. It must be at
least one inch from any side.

                                 Detonators
                                 ----------


        The most common time-delay device is an ordinary safety fuse. These
fuses usually consist of a black-powder core surrounded with a fabric and
then a layer of waterproof material. Although there are many different types,
it can generally be said that safety fuses burn between 30 and 45 seconds
per foot; however, check these figures when you make your purchase. Fuses
can be bought from any mail-order pryotechnics company. Two with whom I have
dealt are:
                           Ecco Products
                           Box 189
                           Northvale, New Jersey 07647

                           Westech Corporation
                           P.O. Box 8193
                           Salt Lake City, Utah 84108

        Double-coated waterproof fuse usually sells for 20 to 25 dollars for
a thousand to fifteen hundred feet. I would advise purchasing this equipment,
since homemade fuses are not to be trusted.
        Bombs can be detonated in many ways. The detonation and use of
certain devices are based mainly on the cleverness and imagination of the
saboteur. In the following section I have discussed several basic forms of
detonators, both nonelectric and electric. However, there is an infinite
number of variations, which may be better suited to individual situations.
        The first type is referred to either as a tension-release, or a
wiretrap device. It operates on the principle of releasing the tension 
caused by a wound spring, on the firing pin, and allowing it to strike and
set off a nonelectrical blasting cap. The nonelectrical blasting cap will in
turn generate the necessary heat to ignite the TNT or dynamite. This can be
implemented in many ways. A common method in which the wire-trip device can 
be employed is stretching a trip wire six inches above the ground. Another 
equally popular method of employing the tension-release device is attaching
the taut wire to the back of a door, so that, when the door is opened, the
tension is released, and the explosive ignites.
        A device very similar to the last one is the pull-trigger electric
detonator. It functions in the same manner, in that a safety pin is removed
from the striker or firing pin, causing it to move forward and connect with a
metal plate. This connection with the metal plate completes the electrical
circuit. The batteries have been connected by wires to an electrical 
blasting cap, a metal plate, and finally to the firing pin. Although 
professional supplies for this equipment are available at reasonable prices,
the device can be constructed from household items. The construction of this
device is as follows: two flashlight batteries are connected to each other,
and then one wire is run from one end of the batteries to the electrical
blasting cap, the other wire from the opposite end of the batteries to the
metal plate. A third wire is run from the blasting cap to the firing pin.
This now completes the fully cocked device.
        In the same manner as the explosive is detonated, so is the common
military grenade. The principle of a tension release is the same. After the
pin is pulled out of the military grenade, the spring is free to react,
causing the primer to ignite the lead-spitter fuse, and it in turn will
ignite the lead oxide and pentolite. The pentolite will release enough heat
to ignite the TNT and cause fragmentation of the metal casing.
        The next type of detonating device I am going to discuss is called
the pressure-trigger device. It is based on the application of pressure
rather than its release, as in the previous devices. This mechanism is
primarily used when an electrical circuit is employed. The plunger is pushed
down; it forces one thin metal plate against another thicker metal plate.
The batteries are connected, via the blasting cap, to each of these metal
plates. Therefore, when they touch, the electrical circuit is complete, and
the explosive will ignite.
        This type of device has several important advantages. First of all,
it can be constructed away from the area it will be used in. This will cut 
installation time down to seconds. Later the in the chapter, I discuss a
type of booby trap that can be rigged into the ignition system of a car.
Although the ignition-system booby trap works very well, it takes time to
install. This pressure-trigger device will act almost in the same manner if
placed beneath the drivers seat, and can be installed in a lot less time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                              

                           Bridge Destruction
                           ------------------


        Bridges are much hard to destroy than buildings, and this is for
several reasons:
[1> Most of the bridges to be destroyed will be far larger than buildings.
[2> They are built strongly, to last for long periods of time.
[3> They have many reinforcements that are not visible.
[4> Everyone realizes the strategic importance of bridges, therefore everyone
    should realize how well guarded they are.

        An important factor to bear in mind, when working on bridge 
demolition, is the extent of real damage desired. Total destruction of a 
bridge is useless, a waste of good explosives. It may even be harmful, since
there may come a time when friendly force will need the use of that bridge.
Bridge destruction should therefore be considered a tactical-delay operation.
It will slow the enemy down, and cause them much expense and time to rebuild.
Since types of charges differ for different types of brides, I will go into
specific types of bridge demolitions.
        [Stringer bridges] are the most common type of concrete, steel, or
timber bridges in existence. They are usually one or more spans, but this
makes little difference in the actual placement of charges. If more than one
span is to be destroyed, one should just copy the first placement on the
second span. The stringer-type bridge is on basically two or three steel
"I" beams, referred to as stringers. The obvious method is to attempt to
sever these primary aspects of the entire structure. This can be accomplished
by placing charges on either side of each stringer. Each charge should be
tamped either with sandbags or a wooden brace. The result of placing all the
charges on the same side of the stringer is the twisting and forced warping
of the steel beams beyond any future use. When dealing with a bridge of 
this type which incorporates more than one span, place the charges along the
joints of the stringer, since this is the weakest point along the line.
        A [slab bridge] is a simple structure, consisting of a flat slab of
either concrete or timber held together in such a way that it forms one
continuous slab, these are the easiest bridges to destroy, since all that is
required is a diagnal line of explosive charges placed either under, or
drilled into, the structure itself. If the charges are placed beneath the
bridge, they should be attached by some means, and tamping should be used.
        The [T-Beam bridge] is very similar to the stringer-type bridge,
except it is without the bottom reinforcements. This doesn't mean the T-beam
bridge is any weaker or easier to destroy. This type of bridge is based on
three or four concrete or steel T-beams, with a large slab of concrete
covering them. The space between the T-beams on the underneath of the
bridge is ideal for the placement of explosive charges, since 75% of the
tamping has already been constructed, by the very nature of the bridge
itself. This type of bridge may have more than one span but, since bridge-
destruction is only a tactical-delay operation, the destruction of one span
should be enough. If you wish to destroy more than one span, just repeat
the same operation, on the second span, paying close attention to the joints.
Like the stringer-type bridge, the charges are placed beneath the bridge,
between the beams themselves. A steel or wooden platform should be
constructed to so hold the explosives, and direct their force upward into the
bridge.
        The [concrete cantilever bridge] is probably better known as a 
causeway. It is usually a very low bridge, with many segments or spans
supported by a series of concrete columns. The same basic procedure should be
followed as previously outlined, in that one should look for the weakest
point in the structure, and fix the charges at that point. The weakest point
in most structures is the place where two objects join, so the explosive
charges should be placed along the joints of the separate sections or spans.
Place charges of explosives at the foot of the corresponding column to insure
destruction. The charges placed at the foot of the columns should all be
tamped and placed on the same side of the respective columns, so as to 
encourage maximum destruction. This type of bridge has many spans, but
usually it is only necessary to destroy several of the middle sections.
        All charges placed at the foot of the columns should be situated on
the same side, so as to channel the movement of the destructive force in one
direction.
        The [truss bridge] is usually used for railroad crossings, and is 
built of steel. This type of bridge is one of the strongest in the world, and
offers many problems for the saboteur. The best method is to run several
different explosions at thirty-minute intervals, to that one can see exactly
what needs destruction, but this is not feasible for the guerilla operation.
Be very careful when attempting a sabotage operation of this type, especially
with a truss bridge, since, as it is a train crossing, it will undoubtedly
be guarded heavily.
        [Suspension bridges] are, generally speaking, the largest bridges in
the world, and accordingly the strongest. It is a good idea to allow yourself
three of four separate charges with a time lapse between them. If this is not
