Ok, now I know all of you are sick and tired of hearing about gunpowder but
this little treasure is worth knowing about. What it essentially is, is the
equivalent of 3 or 4 M-80's.

Ingredients:
     1 Empty Matchbox
     40 ft. Copper Wire
     1 Pair Wireclippers
     4 Size "D" Batteries
     3 Rolls of Electrical Tape
     As many Solar Igniters as you can get your hands on
             (available at your nearest hobbyshop with model rockets)
     Apx. 2-4 Ounces of Gunpowder (instructions to follow for construction)


First off, open the matchbox and fill it half-way with gunpowder. Surround the
tip of one of the igniters in a light shroud of toilet paper (very little),
soaked in powder. Next lay the igniter in the box so that the igniting tip is
in the middle and the two contact wires are extending over the edge. (MAKE SURE
THEY ARE NOT TOUCHING AS THIS WILL CAUSE A SHORT). Now fill the box to the top
and pack it well. Put the cover on the box, making sure not to damage or shift
the igniter. Wrap well with at least 25 layers of electrical tape, making damn
well sure there are no uncovered spots. It is very important to do this part
well and tightly. The igniter wires should still be poking out of the now
mummified box.

To detonate:
Cut the copper wire so that you now have 2 wire of 20 ft. each. strip all four
ends (an inch or two from the end). connect copper wires to the solar igniters
(one wire for each igniter end). Connect the 4 Batteries using what is left of
the tape (or use a lantern Battery). Touch one of the ends of one of the wires
to one end of the battery chain. GET AWAY.  Now connect the other end...
It is probably to detonate this with an alarm clock or radio signal but hasn't
been tested yet. NOTE: It may take 2 or 3 seconds for detonation, do not
approach the box... when done properly this will blow up a helluva lot.

Powder:
    60% Potassium Nitrate (Saltpetre)
    30% Charcoal (Crushed VERY Fine) (Carbon)
    10% Sublimed Sulphur (or normal Sulphur, available at Wallgreen's)


That's all for now.. have Fun...

oh, and good luck...
