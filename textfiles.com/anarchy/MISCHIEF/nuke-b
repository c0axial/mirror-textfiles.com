first, i must give credit to he who deserves it...

      thanx, cracker jack!

       call his board!  needs good users!

necessary materials:

           one shotgun, preferably one which uses large cartridges
           2 foot length of strong pipe, one end sealed
           1 empty shotgun shell
           uranium-238

    (u-238--1 ounce per 100,000 people in your city)

   after you have managed to obtain all the following necessary materials,  you must weld the shotgun to piece of pipe as strongly as possible.  if you are not an experienced welder, have a friend do this, as it is very important!  the explosion will not be as powerful if it is not welded properly.

   next, take the uranium and place it in the shotgun shell as firmly as possible.  it really doesn't matter, but why chance it?

   lastly, load up your shotgun and take the safety off it exists.
  
   call up all the local news agencies, as well as abc, nbc and cbs news and tell them you are about to blow the shit out of a city.  you'll be famous in ten (10) minutes!  what an extra added bonus!

   when you are ready to blow up the city go down to main street and pull the trigger.  or give the gun to some loser (like the 603 marauder) and tell him it is a flare gun, and get the hell out of the city with your computer, because chances are it will be radioactive when you get back.

   presto, good-bye to your hick town.  what a way to blow a saturday!

\final note/
 ----------
    uranium-238 is not as easy to get as i made it sound...the united stated and soviet governments guard this stuff like the way you guard your family jewels.  however, i'm sure the soviets would be more than happy to give you some if you promised to blow the shit out of some u. s. city....

have fun,
