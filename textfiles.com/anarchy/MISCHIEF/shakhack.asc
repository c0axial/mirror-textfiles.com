         How to break into and use display computers at Radio Shack
                                by: XyZZy

   The expensive computers on display at Trash Shack/computer stores are filled
with interesting programs and files.  However, they almost invariably are 
equipped with some sort of security program.  The most common type is the menu 
program.  Usually there is some `amazing' graphics demo running to show the 
`incredible' 300x200 Monochrome resolution, right?  After you terminate that 
program with an ESC, Break, Q or <snicker> BRS, you are greeted with a menu.  If
you want to shell to DOS, or run a program on the menu, you are asked to enter a
password.  Now, you have 3 choices.  1, you work there, and you enter the 
password. (Not likely.) 2, You hack the password by trying random combinations 
of letters or words, and probably get caught by an employee walking by. (Maybe,
if their password is `password'. <grin>) Finally: 3, you bypass the security 
system. (This is the quickest, easiest, and most effective method, other than 
method 1.  It is also less risky than spending hours hacking it.)

   Now that you have determined that there is a menu security program, and it is
not built into the operating system, try all the menu commands to see what 
programs that you can run without breaking in.  There may be a program with a
DOS shell built right in.  Wouldn't that be convenient?  If there is, shell to 
DOS and have fun!

   If there isn't a DOS shell that you can access, you'll have to get around 
the menu program entirely.  Remember that the menu is only a program, and 
being so, must be activated at start-up, either manually or by the use of an 
AUTOEXEC.BAT phile.  In the case of the former, simply reboot the computer 
with a ctrl-alt-delete.  If the reboot function is locked, BRS it.  Sometimes 
there will be a clear panel cover over the reset button, and you will need to 
find a way to remove this if there is something barring your access to The Big 
Red Switch.  After the system boots up, you will have free access to all of its
contents.

   If it *is* loaded in the AUTOEXEC.BAT phile, it is probably loaded at the 
end, so that the system can load its TSRs, if any.  All you have to do is break 
(^C) out of the batch phile before the security program is called.  If, 
however, there is a BREAK OFF command, you will have to be quick enough to 
break before the statement is executed, and after the system boots.  A few 
tries should be enough.  When you see "^CTerminate batch job?_", type "Y", and 
the computer is under your control.

                          -== Computer Phun ==-

   Once inside, move to the root directory and type "DIR *.".  This will get 
you a list of directories. (It excludes directories with extentions and 
includes philes without extentions, but it gives you a place to start.) 
Methodically change to each of these directories and check out the contents.  
You will probably find all kinds of cool stuff.  This is a list of a few phun 
things to do once inside:

1)    Create a batch file that says something over and over, or simulates an 
   error.

2)    Change the prompt to "$p$g format c:$_All data will be destroyed! Are you 
   sure?y$_formatting..." and watch the face on the first half-brained 
   employee who happens to walk by.

3)    Find the DOS directory and run GWBASIC or BASICA.  Create a program that 
   simulates the menu program, and have it record the passwords in a hidden 
   phile which you can read later. (Also edit the appropriate batch philes)

4)    Find the DOS directory and run GWBASIC or BASICA.  Create a program that
   destroys "\COMMAND.COM", "\*.SYS", or other necessary philes... Five minutes
   after you leave.

5)    Stealing software: If you have just `happened' to bring along a floppy 
   disk... (This one speaks for itself.  3«" disks are best for this.)

6)    DEL *.*, DEL COMMAND.COM, DEL *.SYS, DEL *.BAT!

7)    FORMAT C:!

8)    Bring your own programs to run, and really mess things up.

9)    Bring a hex editor and search for passwords. (Find the security 
   program's directory by TYPEing "\AUTOEXEC.BAT"

10)   If the system has an outdial modem, (unusual, but possible) hack the 
   Kremlin.

   Well, I hope you found this phile useful, and if you have any questions, I 
can be contacted on several bulletin board systems in the 214 area.  I have 
had hours of fun with this, and I hope you do too.  Happy Hacking!
