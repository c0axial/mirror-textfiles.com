HOW TO HAVE FUN AT K-MART  WELL, FIRST OFF, ONE MUST REALISE THE IMPORTANCE OF
K-MARTS IN SOCIETY TODAY.  FIRST OFF, K-MARTS PROVIDE THINGS CHEAPER TO THOSE
WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO SHOP AT HIGHER QUALITY STORES.  ALTHOUGH, ALL I EVER SEE
IN THERE IS MINORITIES AND SENIOR CITIZENS, AND THE POOR PEOPLE IN OUR CITY.
PERSONALLY, I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD IN THERE.  BUT, ONCE, I DID.  YOU SEE,
ONCE, AFTER THE MOON ROACH AND HAVOC CHAOS (DEAR FRIENDS OF MINE) AND I WERE
EXPLORING SUCH FUN THINGS AS ROOFTOPS, WE CAME ALONG A K-MART. AMUSED, AND
COLD FOR THAT MATTER, WE WANDERED IN.  THE TENSION MOUNTS.  AS WE WALKED UP TO
THE ENTRANCE, WE WERE NEARLY ATTACKED BY YOUTH GROUPS SELLING CHEAP COOKIES,
AND WHEELCHAIR STRICKEN PEOPLE SELLING AMERICAN FLAGS.  AFTER LAUGHING AT
THESE PEOPLE, WE ENTERED. THIS IS WHERE THE REAL FUN BEGINS... FIRST, WE
WANDERED AROUND THE STORE, AND TURNED ON ALL THE BLUE LIGHTS WE COULD FIND.
THAT REALLY DISTRACTS AND CONFUSES THE ATTENDENTS...FUN TO DO...  THE FIRST
NEAT THING, IS TO GO TO THE SECTION OF THE STORE WHERE THEY SELL COMPUTERS.
DARKNESS ENGULF THE EARTH THE DAY THEY FIND APPLE COMPUTERS BEING SOLD THERE.
INSTEAD, LESSER COMPUTERS LIKE THE LAUGHABLE VIC-20 CAN BE FOUND THERE...
TURN IT ON, AND MAKE SURE NOBODY'S LOOKING...THEN, ONCE IN BASIC, TYPE...
]10 PRINT "FUCK THE WORLD!  ANARCHY RULES!" (OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.)
]20 GOTO 10
AND WALK AWAY.
ALSO, SET THE SAMPLE RADIOS IN THE STORE TO A SANTANIC ROCK STATION, AND TURN
THE RADIO OFF.  THEN, SET THE ALARM FOR TWO MINUTES AHEAD OF THE TIME
DISPLAYED THERE.  TURN THE VOLUME UP ALL THE WAY, AND WALK AWAY.  AFTER ABOUT
TWO MINUTES, YOU WILL SEE THE CLERK FEEBLY ATTEMPT TO TURN THE RADIO DOWN OR
OFF.  IT'S REALLY NEAT TO SET TEN OR MORE RADIOS TO DIFFERENT STATIONS, AND
WALK AWAY. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO, IS TO GET ONTO THE INTERCOM SYSTEM
OF THE STORE.  EASIER TYPED THEN DONE.  FIRST, CHECK OUT THE GARDEN DEPARTMENT
YOU SAY THERE'S NO ATTENDENT THERE?  GOOD.  SNEAK CAREFULLY OVER TO THE PHONE
BEHIND THE CHEAP COUNTER THERE, AND PICK IT UP.  DIAL THE NUMBER CORRESPONDING
TO THE ITEM THAT SAYS 'PAGE'...AND TALK.  YOU WILL NOTE THAT YOUR VOICE WILL
ECHO ALL OVER THE BOWELS OF K-MART.  I WOULD SUGGEST ANNOUNCING SOMETHING ON
THE LINES OF:  "ANARCHY RULES!!"  BY: THE DAREDEVIL
