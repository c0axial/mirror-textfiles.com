Gutting Yards
-------------
     This is a simply marvelous way to get back at people you hate. There is no
better way to piss someone off then by rolling their house,but now, Damage Inc.
has discoved a new dimension wich digs deeper into this marvelous prank.
     What you do is simply this.

1. Go to your local slaughter house and buy a barrel of innards. (also very
   nourishing in a pinch)

2. Bring the smelly shit home with you.

3. (At night) Go to the victem's house.  Bringing along a few friends helps
   you bear the unpleasantries.

4. Slap on your handy Latex gloves.

5. Start slinging organs!

     Step 5 is very fun.. Try slinging a small intestine over the house, hang
testes on the doornob. Or fill the area between the wooden door  and the screen
door with nasty slop.. Imagine the look on their face when they open the door
and a bunch of innards slide into their foyer.. The possibilities are endless!

Diarihhea Party
---------------
     Can you recall your freshman lab-sciencce course in high school?  Do you
remember that nasty smelling pink stuff you used called PHENOPHALINE? Well this
PHENOPHALINE is used to indicate wether or not a substance is acidic, or basic.
Well anyway.. The truth has come to light that Phenophaline is a very strong
laxitive (causes the runs) and it is also skin absorbant!

 Here's what you do-->

1. Get one of those DRENCH squirt guns that pump out a quart of water in less
   than 5 seconds.

2. Fill it up with your favorite brand of Phenophaline.

3. Sneak up on you unsuspecting victem.

4. Blast the fuck out of him.

5. Follow him to the nearest public restroom and bring along a tape recorder
   for future blackmail purposes.

 Now for The Party--->

1. Enter the house of your victem on the night of his party.
2. Find the punchbowl.
3. Pour in what you would call a appropriate dosage (considering that it is a
   very strong laxitive)
4. Take out the camcorder and enter the bathroom.
5. Stay in the bathroom.
6. Tie up the bathroom, and wait for pounding on the door.
7. Open up and get out quickly.
8. Set the Camcorder on <RECORD>.
9. Call the vidio----> The Party Bathroom Riot
 
Tasers
------
     Tasers are usually called stun guns, or shock boxes.  The mafia and Damage
     Inc. use them alot to silence those who cannot keep their mouthes shut.
     To make one you will need
 
1. Soldering iron and solder.
2. Wires, or a specially printed circuit board.
3. A power transformer, or a telsa coil.(Use a telsa coil for paralization
   capabilities.)
4. A normally open, nonlocking push button switch.
5. Two sharpened skinny 2 1/2 inch nails.
6. A block of wood 1" X 1" X 4".
7. And a D-cell.
 
Schematic---->
 
OOOOO stands for the block of wood.
^ stands for the switch.
1 & 2 are the load leads of transformer or telsa.
3 & 4 are the other two leads of transformer or telsa.
5 & 6 are the battery terminals.
The exclamation points coming out of the top of the wood block are the two
nails.
 
          !         !
          !    ^    !
         OOOOOOOOOOOOO
          T   T T   T
    3-----+   ! !   !
        1-----+ 5   !
                    !
        2-------6   !
    4---------------+
 
Steps --->
 
1. Take the block and drill a hole in the middle just large enough for the
   switch to fit in.
2. Solder two wires onto the leads of the switch (about 2" apiece)
3. Securely set the switch with the button pointing well out the other side.
4. Nail the nails through the block(near the ends) so that the points react
   out the other side.
5. Solder a 4" lead under the head of each nail and pound the rest the way in.
   (make sure the points come out the side that has the switch.)
6. Solder the lead from one of the nails to 3 and the other to 4.
7. Solder one of the switch leads to 1 and the other to 5.
8. Solder a jumper wire from 2 to 6.
 
Usage --->
 
1. Stab nails completely into victem(yes all the way) and withdraw just as
   quickly (no shock is emitted until the button is let back up.
2. Run away if yours does't work(and I mean quickly!)
 
Miniture Pipe Bomb Grenades
---------------------------
     If you want to kill someone, or just have the urge to hear thunder, these
miniture pipe bombs, or grenades are perfect.

2. A C6-5 model rocket engine.
3. A legnth of water proof fuse.
4. 24 hour drying clay.
5. A news paper.
6. A hacksaw.
7. A hammer.
 
Instructions --->
 
1. Cut the CO2 cartridge with hacksaw.. On nozzel end. Cut close to the end
   cut farther from the end until you you have a hole the width of a pencil.
2. Unwrap rocket engine, and pull off the clay at both ends.

3. Put the black stuff inside the folded newspaper and crush it using the
   hammer. (make sure you have a fairly fine powder.)

4. Fill up CO2 cartridge with powder, but do not pack it in.

5. Insert legnth of fuse in the end and secur it in place, and block the rest
   of the opening with 24 hour clay.

6. Let clay dry.

To use---->

1. Light fuse and get at least 50 feet away.

2. Light fuse and throw at victim.
 
If 1-->then you would want a long fuse.

If 2-->then you want a short fuse so that the victem doesn't pick it up, throw
       it back at you, and makes you the victem.
