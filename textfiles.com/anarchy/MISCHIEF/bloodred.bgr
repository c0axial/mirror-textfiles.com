                          - I AM NOT CRAZY -

Ahh, Yes, Summer... I HATE SUMMER! Its hot. Its sticky. Its dry. It doesn't 
rain enough. Oh well.. Its comming at an alarming rate. What ever shall we do?
First thing is that i want to make this clear.. THIS FILE DOESN'T DEAL WITH
ANARCHY, It is dealing with TERRORISM. Read my last file on true Anarchy. So,
here we are, Waiting for summer to come. Still in school right? Well we will 
not start here... I have already done a BGR file on that... Lets start with
some after school fun. Lets take a trip to the local appartment complex.

                               But first:
I am not going to tell you not to try all this. But I will tell you, you could
get killed, arrested, jailed, expelled, beat up, in court, sued, an many other
things if you take this advise. It is your life, Live it how you want, but i
nor BGR is in no way responsible for the path you choose to take, and the 
consiquences involved with every choice a person makes through out his or her
life.

        1. The appartment complex

Ahh, Yes, The appartment complex, I HATE THE APPARTMENT COMPLEX! Lets fuck
with it. The first thing about ACs (appartment complexs) is that the drain
pipes are almost always connected to one big one. This is one of the biggest
mistakes the contractors make. All you have to do is a little tunnal ratting.
Come on, Don't be affraid, find that heart of the system. Good. Now, Take out
your trusty time bomb. Nothing TOO powerful now. Just some thing EAR 
SHATTERING. Set it for about 30-60 Minutes and get your ass out of there. When
that fucker blows, it will rock the whole appartment complex. Another thing
you can do since they locked all the drain pipes into one is throw in a shit
load of smoke gernades. Smoke will poor out all over. See how many colums of
smoke you can count from out side of the appartment complex! Depending on the
size of the appartment complex, it may have only one transformer. Find the 
fucker, and blow it up with a 1/4 stick. You can knock out every ones elctric
for a day or two. Don't forget to run, cuz these are real real real powerful
booms.

        2. Fun with farmers

Ahh, yes, farmers, I HATE FARMERS! Lets fuck with them. Wait in the corn 
feilds while they are getting ready to use those big clipper things on it. 
DO NOT GET CLIPED! Pull out your trusty three liter bottle out of your back 
pack... It should look something like this:
               /--\
              |    |
              |1111|   1= 1/4 inch foil balls
              |2222|   2= Water
              |2222|
              \----/

That pattern look formiliar? Yup, your right, its going to be a drano bomb.
When the farmers cliper machine is near, pull out the drano. (crystal only)
and pour it in to the bottle. thats right, the whole fucking box. Cap it very
quickly, throw, and run! The drano liquadizes in the water, and then reacts 
with the foil and produces hydrogen. The hydrogen cannot get out of the bottle
so it expands with in. Then when the bottle can't hold it any more, It 
explodes! Another thing you can do, is stick a 5 foot metal rod up in the 
middle of a hey or corn feild. Put 2' of it in the ground with 3' sticking up.
Put a few of them up all around it. Guess what, You just made punjii sticks.
When the big clipper things try to cut through it it should jam right up.

        3. Fun with the mail!
      
Ahh, yes, mail, I HATE THE MAIL! Lets fuck with it! (Do you see a pattern 
here?) Take some stamps out of some bodys house. Then get a shit load of
envolopes. Seal um all up, and put one persons adress on every single one. 
Don't put anything in side, just an empty letter with a stamp and their address
on it. Now, Send one letter to this person the first day, 2 the second 3 the
third, 4 the forth and so on untill your out of letters or stamps. This really
pisses people off. Also, you can mail death threats and put some body elses 
return adress on it. If you get really board mail some one a letter saying they
one $100,000 in a random name sweepstakes, and that all they have to do is 
send the letter back to you in 1 week. DONT PUT AN COMPANY NAME, OR ADDRESS
ON IT! Here are some usefull adresses. USE YOUR IMAGINATION!

        4. Fun with stink bombs

There are million of chemicals that you can mix to get bad smelling gases.
But this one looks as bad as it smells. My friend told me about how a movie
theater dick him and his friends over once... So before a show started we
got together while every one was in line out side. From a 23 floor of a
building across the street he mixed Hydrocloric acid with chunks of alumnium.
He caped the large bottle and threw it near the croud. Then, our bud on the
street yelled "POISION GAS!!", and every one paniced.

The combonation of the two formed a very dark gas that smells very very bad.
The police and fire department closed all the streets in the area for a while.
All you have to do is put Hydrocloric acid wich can be bought at a pool suply
store in a large bottle and add the aluminum chunks. 

  Some other chemicals are:
   1. Rotten eggs
   2. Skunk Repelent
   3. Dog Repelent
   4. Cat Repelent
   5. Shark Repelent (issued to air force piolits)
   6. Fart Spray (Practical joke that REEKS!)

        5. SuperGlue landmines

First off, you need some bubble packing. Cut out on indvidual bubble from the
rest of the sheet, and puncture a hole in it 1/16 of an inch. Inject Eastman
910 into the hole and fill it up. The hole should seal its self. Put these in
peoples shoes, pants pockets, beds, telephone coin returns, behind door knobs,
seats, ect.

If you get board of glue, use other additives! Use your fucking imagination!
