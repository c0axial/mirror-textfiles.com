This is my greeting to all you out there in white bread land. More
retail type scams for you to enjoy. Like usual these are for educational
purposes. These are designed to show you that everything is a system.
Hacking root on unix, hacking a cell network, or hacking the social
system, it is all the same. Ponder on that after this article.

                                Free Car Repair
                                ---------------

        Driving down the road, your call stalls out. You later find out
that you have several hundred dollars in car repairs to come. 'This is 
lame' you say. This is the solution...

        Go to a Firestone or Midas or other chain car repair place that
can be found anywhere. Go early in the morning. Most of these places
will open at 7am or so since they hit the yuppie fucks who want to drop
their car off, go to work, and pick it up on their lunch break. Tell them
what is wrong, let them tell you what they think is the problem etc. 
Just play it cool, and keep saying you HAVE to have it fixed because you
have to go somewhere important like court or out of town.  When they ask
"what time do you need this by?" You respond "12:00 and preferrably no
later." This gives them about 5 hours(which most car repairs can be done
in) to fix your car. They will usually say that is fine since you will
be the first or second repair if you are there that early. 
        First thing. Leave them the ignition key and NO door key. Tell them
that you lost your door key, and to leave it unlocked as you have nothing
valuable in it. Make sure you do not sound nervous and that it sounds like
you really did lose your door key. Sign all the paperwork they want you to
with bullshit info. When they ask for a number to call you at, say you 
will be away from the office/home and will just come back at noon, and that
they are authorized to do ANY repair needed.  If they insist, give them
one of those numbers which always ring busy (see #Hack FAQ).
        Enjoy your morning. Do whatever you want and get ready for the 
next step.
        Scope out the repair place. Around noon the place should be quite
busy with people reparing cars, new customers coming in, and morning
customers picking up their cars. Now, since your doors are not locked,
go to your car, use your second ignition key, get in, drive off happy
knowing that you ripped off some company that has about 250% markup on
parts, and overpriced labor charges. Free repairs to your car. Only
catch is you don't go back to the same place...but since there are a ton
of Firestone's and Midas repair shops around, no problem.  Of course they
put your tags down on their paper work so stolen plates wouldn't hurt!


                                Free Diverters
                                --------------

        Ever find yourself devoting all your time to scanning for a new
diverter of some kind? Praying that you will stumble on some decnet, 
meridian, or other diverter? Create your own.

        Most places that offer voice mail are ideal for you. Independent
voice mail owners really don't have a clue about phreaking, diverting,
or anything of that nature. Look in your yellow pages under 'voice mail'
and find some places that offer this service. Don't choose a place like
AT&T or USWorst or something since they are a little more keen on the 
fraud thang.
        Call the place up and ask questions about their voice mail service.
Ask normal questions like 'Do I have my own number?', 'How many messages
will it store?", or "Does it have paging service?". Sometime during these
questions, ask if it has a dialout feature. If it does, you are in luck.
If it doesn't, choose another place.
        If the place has dialout service, this is the place for you. Now
ask about their billing. What you want to find out is if they can do auto
billing to a credit card, or if they bill an address. Either way, you should
be fine. If they do it all by credit card, then choose that. Use your 
friend's credit card (with his consent of course). Have the place bill
that credit card at the end of each month. If they bill and address, then
tell them your address(probably a neighbor's house since you are never home)
and you are set. After all that is arranged, you should have a voice mail
box, with dialout feature. Since everything is in your friend's name(since
you work so much and are hard to reach), you shouldn't get hassled too much.
        Rememeber, if you use the dialout feature for any reason, make sure
you use it for no more than three weeks, in case your 'friend' gets the bill
and is cross with you. If he is, set up another with a different friend's 
credit card number.
