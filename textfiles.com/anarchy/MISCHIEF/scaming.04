                                The Rat Shack Discount
                                ----------------------

        How many of you shop at rat shack for any reason? Need a new tone
dialer since yours got stepped on? Need some more solder for creating that
new box? Like getting discounts just for the hell of it? This is your place.

        Background. Tandy Corporation owns radio shack. They also own some
other stores as well, making them a pretty big company. One of the things
you get when working at ANY Tandy store is a discount at all the others.
Most people don't realize this, but Computer City is owned by Tandy as well.
Since Tandy treats their employees like total shit, this is your chance to
take a little out of them on each purchase. Take into account that since
Rat Shacks litter the country, they have a virutal monopoly on small 
electronic parts. Thus, they can get away with unbelievable mark ups on
their items. Thus, ripping the customer off.
        Go into radio shack. Get whatever you want, and take it up to the 
counter. Tell them that you work for Computer City and get your employee
discount. Most Rat Shack employees will know about Computer City being in
the chain, but know nothing else about it. From there they will ask what
discount you recieve. According to Tandy, you get 10% off at all Rat Shacks
if you work at Computer City. So make sure you say 10% (If you said 25% or 
something, they probably wouldn't question you though). 100% of the time
that friend's have used this, they have NOT checked to see if it is true.
So now you can but whatever you want at a decent discount. 10% may not seem
like a big discount but look at it this way. 10% is more than your tax rate.
So at the least you are taking a little money from the government. At most
you are taking 10% from Tandy Corporation which really deserves to rot in 
hell. The ONLY thing they have brough us is a single place where you can
buy anything you need for your phreaking desires.
        When you purchase the items they will ask you for two pieces
of information. First, your store number. If you don't know a computer
city store number you can do one of two things. Call your local
Computer City (If they have one in your area), ask for customer service,
and just ask "What is your store number?". They will usually tell you without
a question. OR, you can use this one: 29-5260. That is the store number
for the Computer City in Denver, CO. The format for their store codes is
29-5XXX with it usually being either 52XX or 51XX depending on the region.
The second thing they will ask you for is your social security number.
The only thing to remember here is that they begin with a number between
2-5. So don't say "866-69-1010" or something. Also remember the number you
use in case the person is a gimp and doesn't type it in right, and has to
ask you again.

                            Free New Car Engine
                            -------------------

        Deadkat made me aware of this one, and it is quite nice.
Jiffy Lube offers a guarantee on their work that goes something like
this: They will repair/replace any damaged piece/component of your
car that is damaged due to their work.

        Go do their spiffy 10 minute oil change at a distant Jiffy Lube.
After they are done, pay and drive off. A little ways down the road
pull over somewhere where you can't be seen, and get under your car. Loosen
or remove the oil pan drain plug. Whatever it takes to make oil drip out
or leak. Keep driving as the oil drains. After a while your engine will
overheat, and probably seize. Bingo. Their faulty workmanship caused
your engine to blow up. Have your car towed back to the Jiffy Lube and
demand to see their manager. Tell them you were driving down the road
enjoying life, and your engine blew up and you don't know why. Tell them
you just came from there hours earlier, and want them to look at it and
find out what is wrong.
        Through persistance and social engineering, you should be able to
convinve him(since they will find the reason it happened quite easily)
that they fucked up and you suffered. Although this is a little more 
hardcore, it can pay off quite well, especially if you have an old piece
of shit for a car.


                                Free Books
                                ----------
                            
        Find the company that publishes the book you want. Call them up. 
Here is an example of what you would say.

        "Hi. My name is Hank Poecher and I am teaching a class on _________ 
at __________ College (Highschool). I would like to get a review copy of your 
book called 'Eye kAn hAcK!@#!". The ISBN number is 3038661010."

        Usually they will be more than glad to send you a copy as
it will be bought by every student, and spread more. If they would
like to charge you, just mention the above fact. Many computer related
or school type books are getting pretty expensive, so this comes in 
handy.

                                Free Software II
                                ----------------
                                
        Even though I mentioned one way to get software, this method
is ideal for those bigger software packages out there. This is a sample
conversation you can use. Call up the company who makes/distributes
the software...

        "Hi there, my name is Chester Karma and I am authoring a new
book called 'Business Software for the PC' and would like to review your
product. Could you send me a copy of your package please?"

        Usually they are willing, but sometimes there are two objections
to this, or two catches. Sometimes they will want the request in writing.
This is not a problem. Just write out a letter telling them exactly what 
they want to hear. Since you are not doing anything in illegal, send it
to your house. They will not do anything since the potential for a good
review in a major book is a wet dream to them. Sometimes they will ask
who your publisher is, and you can drop any name to a MAJOR publisher,
or mention that you aren't sure yet, or that you are self published.
In any case, just sound convincing.
