  To break windows, destroy personal property, and damage as much as you

PICKING A TARGET
----------------
  Before you go out, think of a place you can park the car and still have access
to what you want to damage.  It doesn't mater how good of a golfer you are.  My
friends never golf, but always manage to break something!  Remember this is your
goal.  Break and damage everything you can!  I played golf for the school team,
so it is easy for me to rack up about $200.00+ damage every time I play.  Some
of my favorite targets are:  School, Houses of people I hate (especially Jews),
Small stores, and parking lots full of cars.  Once you have picked your target,
park the car about a block away and walk to a grassy area about 100-200 yards
away from the target.  Now dump out about 15 of the balls.  You don't want to
dump them all out in case you drill something and have to leave.  I found that
lower irons (like 3, 4, or 5) work best for average damage.  If you want to
destroy the fuck out of something get out the Driver or woods!	Now hit the
balls as hard as you fucking can at the target.  Run to the car and leave if you
take out something major like a $400.00 window or a car.  I personally like
woods the best!  Two friends and I once took out 3 school windows with woods,
taking only a shot or rwo a piece.  This was hellish, we even made the paper,
stating that $700.00 in damages occured.  (Of course they had no idea who did
this!) All this time my parents think I'm out bowling or donig some innocent
shit like that.  Another memerable evening was when I nailed the Casey's store
sign with a wood about 225 yards away.	Now everytime I drive by there I look at
the golf ball sized hole and laugh.  Anything you hit and break is great.  I
enjoy just listening to the thuds and shatterings as the balls hit things in the
distance.  I have never benn caught, but be prepared because if you play enough
you will probably be chased.

HAVE PHUN AND BREAK SOMETHING!
