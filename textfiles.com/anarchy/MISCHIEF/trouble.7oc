                    -==Last second comment from Abigwar==-

  Well, This is a little rough cut, But still... What the hell.. For a groups
 first file, what do you expect. I would like to state the fact that 7oC is
 more of a street group, than a HP group. And if you take a close look, it 
 seems it is even more of a PD group. Haha, Oh well, you can't win them all.
 You should have seen it before i edited it.. Geez, it looks like Psycho was 
 some sort of /<-RaD Elite warez dude. But i think i got the turniquite 
 around the poison blood flow before it was to late if you know what i mean.
 And while i have an oppertunity, Seeming how most likly this will be spred 
 on PD boards, SHareware boards and the like, i just want to say...
                
                "Your all a bunch of fucking wankers!"
 
  Well, now that it is out of my system, i just want to state my complete and
 utter dismay with the PD scene. Some of you are warez d00dz in the making.
 Some of you are goodie goodies who think the H&P scene is out to destroy the
 world, so you narc. Some of you don't even know what H/P is. Some of you 
 are nice normal people. And a whole hell of you are leeches and perverts. 
 I sit behind a monator of a PD BBS once in a while... Luckly for the sysops,
 it is not that bad there. But, on some of the boards I call, (PD), You 
 wankers totaly destroy the board with no remorse. Some PD boards can be ok.
 (God, i wish i had not said that!) But after all the sysop has done to create
 a nice system for other people, you go and wreck it with your garbage posts,
 and "Empty" uploads. 

  As if that was not bad enough, then some of you go out and set up a board of
 your own. These are the lame sysops, the ones with the "I rule, I'm Kh00L" 
 attitudes. I just want you to know, these are the boards true H/Per's are
 after. You know who you are... So you real PD/Shareware boards, You have
 nothing to worry about, and may your board rest in peice, after the losers 
 you let on, trash your board.

  I can't give you an example of a board like that, because it would be rude
 to realise the name of the BBS, and sysop. So i will tell you, that it is 
 in NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, "Death's ___ BBS" (You fill in the blank. Not like
 it matters, because that is **NOT** who i really am talking about (Ahem). 
 The Sysop's name is and was *NOT* Dark something. And that person did *NOT*
 steal the name of a truly famous virus author. 

                                  Thank you.

                                                Abigwar
