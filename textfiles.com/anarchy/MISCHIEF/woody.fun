                        Fun for Boring Weekends

                    Thought of and written here by

                            Woody the Log


    All of these are original ideas which, for the most part, I have thought
up(the few that were contrived with my friends I will post) all are illegal,
so don't bother reading this if you don't like doing things that violate this
country's laws.  I'm not going to say I've done any of these for legal
reasons, but for the most part, I know they work, don't ask how.
      Other than that, these ideas are for entertainment purposes only, just
laugh.  I'm assuming that you are unlike me, in that you would never do
anything like these disgusting and  inhumane ideas.  I hope I'm wrong.
    Oh, by the way.  If anyone else has thought up things similar to these,
let me know.  I would like talking or typing to you.

1)  Telephones--These devices have more uses than hooking up a modem to them.  
For the first one, get a stereo, if you cannot get one then skip to #3.  
    You're going to have to know a little about electronics, not a lot; if you
have ever soldiered a wire, you are fine.
      Get a phone line, one that will reach from your stereo to a phone jack,
with at least one modular connector( the regular kind) attached.  At the end
opposite the connector, strip the red and green wires, if there are
others(usually black and yellow) cut'em off;  they have no use for modern
phone lines.  Take the stripped wires and put them in the speaker output
ports on the back of the stereo.  If you want to get fancy, you can bridge
them mono for more power.
    Now place a tape, CD, or other form of recorder music in you system, the
louder and bassier the better, "Welcome to the Jungle" is perfect, then plug
in the phone line, connecting it to the phone system.
    Go to an extension and dial either a random number or someone you don't
like too much.  When they answer, ask them if they want to hear your stereo,
the only reason for asking is that I have always done it this way.  If they
decline,keep begging, if they hang up, use your handy redial button until the
accent.
    Now push play with the volume at full and set the phone down, it might
spark.  The other person's phone will make quite a bit of noise, and it will
get very hot.  This also, I would imagine, has a devastating effect on
answering machines, faxes, or modems.

2) Telephones II- This next telephone idea is a little more dangerous and
difficult, a lot more illegal, but a tremendous amount more fun.  You have to
know a little more about electronics for this gag.
    The name for this is "Bobby Browning"  it involves going to a house,
preferably an extremely fancy summer one that is abandoned during the winter, 
calling an infamous 1-900 # and then leaving the phone off the hook.  So, by
the time the people return the next spring and get the phone fixed, they will
have run up quite a bill.($.75 per minute * 60 minutes * 24 hours * 7 days *
4 weeks * at least 5 months= $151,000- quite a bit...eh??)  
    Now for the more in depth, how to do.  You must find the telephone
connection box and find, once again, the red and green wires.  You must bring
a modified telephone with you( one that preferably is one piece, with the
dialing apparatus in the handle.  Take the phone lines coming out of it and
soldier fairly small alligator clips to them, if there are more than two
wires, just the red and green)  
    Now simply hook them up to the screws the corresponding house wires are
attached to.  If there are none, then simply clip it straight onto the
wire-you may have to push quite hard.  =====WARNING=====  ATTACH THEM ONE AT
A TIME.  I know that phone lines are not supposed to carry much power, but I
have been knocked out while trying to attach the wires, I had leather gloves
on too.  Once connected you will hear a dial tone. If not then fool around
with the clips, one at a time.
    Once you get a dial tone call your 900 number, I have always used Bobby
Brown's.  Here are some others:

    Mating Mart: $3.00 a minute:1-900-933-0600.  
    Women's Fantasies: 3:00 a minute: 1-900-933-0700

    I should have said this earlier, but once you make your call, you have to
connect a 300K resistor between the wires, otherwise you have to leave your
phone there---Not wise unless you like paying $150,000 dollars for fun.

3)Ropes- Go in a parking lot( a dark, dark parking lot) with a lot of
relatively short(12') pieces of strong but small rope.  Simply tie them
inconspicuously between bumpers, sideview mirrors--not on the drivers side--,
or axles( combinations work out well and be creative).  Now find a safe place
and watch what happens. 
 
4) Trashcans/Mailboxes- This idea was devised by a friend of mine, Chris(he's
not into modeming, so he does not have a handel) but it yields results that
will leave most people laughing for days--I'm laughing as I type this.  Well
anyway, I had to include it.  All you do is tie a thin 1/4 inch black nylon
rope across a street, between a telephone pole and either a mailbox,
preferably an unsteady one, or a trashcan.  
    All I can say is do it, find a nice, well concealed bush,(as far away as
possible while retaining vision of the area) break out the popcorn and watch
what happens as the laws of physics go to work!

5) Dummies- This is my favorite prank. Not that I have ever done it or
anything.   Make a dummy- pair of old pants, long sleeve shirt, pillow case,
shoes, gloves, and lots of news and tissue paper.   It is best to stuff them
with the news paper and then sew the gloves to the shirt, the shirt to the
pants, the pants to the shoes.  Once this is done get three economy size
bottles of tomato sauce.
    This step you can either do at your target or at your home.. I usually do
it at home.  Take the pillow case and fill it with the tissue paper, then
pour one of the gallons of sauce into it.  
    As you walk to your destination the sauce will soak through the material,
giving it a "realistic" look.  Now just leave the dummy wherever you want:
the roadside, a porch, under a car, or, my personal favorite, a portable
bathroom, and pour the other two jars of tomato sauce over it.
    One of the times I did this, fine, I admit I have done it, we left the
body in a portable john, at a work site.  As it turned out, the workers were
on vacation for a week after we left it.  The day before they came back we
checked our creation; the body was covered with flies and crap.  When the
door was opened they all swarmed out along with a nauseating odor of rot.
    Two days later we went back and saw a pair of legs hanging out of a nearby
dumpster.  The workers were all laughing and talking, they were on break.  We
asked them about the legs, and all of them fell to the ground with gasps of
laughter.  Apparently their supervisor had discovered the body the previous
day, he had screamed and jumped back, slipping into a mud pool, emptying his
stomach while still calling for help.....I guess it was pretty realistic.   

6) Bomb- This requires some knoweledge of electronics. No, this is not a real
bomb, I would never publish anything about explosive manufacture, placement,
or destination in a Weekend Fun Guide.   It however does have the effect of a
bomb, or one of them.  This I thought up with the same friend, Chris, but I
perfected it with another person, Mike.
          Take a piece of grey window calk, heat it up with a torch, and form
it into a block.  If you know anything about electronics, build a small
oscillating LED circuit, build it into a circuit board and stick lots of
extra wires, capacitors, and other components that look fancy in it.  If that
did not make sense, just go to Radio Shack and tell them you want a flashing
LED hook it up to a nine volt battery and then rip a circuit board out of an
old radio and place it on your lump,.  There is a possibility that the people
there will not know what a LED is, they do not know much about electronics(
this is not to make fun of them all, some people at Radio Shack know a great
deal more about electronics than I do, but the majority feel challenged if
they have to do anything other than search for numbers); if they don't, send
me E-mail about it and I'll give you the stock numbers of the parts you need.
    Once that is done, hook it up to a 9-volt battery.  LEDs do not use much
power so if your using one, the light will keep flashing for days.  Just
leave it somewhere frequented by people, and either watch their reactions or
go home and laugh while imagining them.  For even more realism, stencil C-4
onto the side.

                 More ideas for boring Weekends

                        by Woody the Log



    Yup, its back.  More ideas for the boring weekend.  All the same stuff
about me knowing nothing about any occasion that stuff like this has been
done.  But, if you have any comments or suggestions, let me hear 'em.

1) Snakes/Frogs/Worms- Try going to a bait shop and pick up a bunch of worms,
or for cheaper catch some frogs or snakes.  Put these in a mailbox belonging
to a person you don't want to know.  Either the mail delivery person or your
victim will get one hell of a surprise; if you are lucky they both will. 
Find a good place of observation, or if you neighbor is the unfortunate
victim, your house is a great spot to watch from: he/she will not be able to
hear your laughter.

2) Letter Bomb- Make a beeping circuit, or buy a pulsating buzzer from Rad
Shack.  Just hook it up to a battery and tape the whole thing to the inside
of a small cardboard box.  Now fill a bag with sand and tape it in the box
too, for weight.  
    This done, leave the box in someone's mailbox, on their car, or at their
front door.  I don't suggest sending it because the postal service will be
suspicious of a beeping package.  One other note, give it to someone with an
imagination; it sucks when they just open it up and look, bewildered, at the
beeper.

3) Car Fun- Get a pack of firecrackers, separate them, and tape each
individually to the muffler of a car.  Make sure the wicks are not quite
touching the muffler, if they are the wicks will shrivel up as the metal
heats.  
    As the car moves the wicks will constantly be bumping into the ever
heating muffler.  When the metal is hot enough the wicks will ignite when
they hit it.  Bang!  Especially on new cars, scares the shit out of the
people in it.

4) More Muffler Fun- I've found that bananas in the tail-pipe actually works,
but I prefer to use duct tape.  Just tape the exhaust pipe airtight and the
car will not start.  Simple but amusing.  A few nights ago, a taped car
proved to be too powerful for the tape.  It still made one hell of a noise
though.

5) Even More Muffler Fun- Slap a bunch of dirty motor oil on the muffler and
pour the rest into the pipe.  Once the tail pipe gets hot, a lot of thick
black smoke will start pouring out of it.  If the guy or gal stops to check
and finds black stuff oozing out, he or she will be scared and will, most
likely, hurry to a mechanic.


    Well, that's it for part II.  If you've enjoyed this series, let me know,
and I'll write more.
