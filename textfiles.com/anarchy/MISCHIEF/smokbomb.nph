   Topic ..................... Disrupting But (usually) Nondestructive Phun
   Author .................... Compilation phrom several sources
   Compiler .................. Nocturnal Phoenix

       This is one of a series of compilations I am creating of the
       various techniques used to perphorm actions that aught not be
       perphormed (but will be done anyway, so why not do it right?).
       I am expecting to have maybe ten or so of these compilations
       by the time I am done.  I realized the need phor some phorm of
       organization of this sort of inphormation when I came across
       phour meg of shit like this.  Out of that phour meg, two meg was
       totaly redundant, one meg was corrupted to the point of not
       being able to read it, and of the other meg, everything that
       was actually usephul was scattered everywhere in bits and pieces.
       Now I personally am a strong proponant of peacephul world Anarchy,
       but I would really rather not try to make something phun like
       nitroglycerin (to use something extremely dangerous that I saw
       phrequently in all that shit) without having a complete set of
       instructions.  Whenever it was possible, I have given credit to
       the author of the original article, although I phound many
       articles which were the same, word phor word, but with dipherent
       authors, phorcing me to chose one of them.  Sorry if I chose
       wrong.

       The compiler of this phile apologizes to the authors of the
       articles within phor any alterations done to their documents.
       This was unavoidable, as most of these texts were nearly 
       unreadable by the time I got them.  I assume this is due to
       various changes made by people who had been in possesion of
       them bephore me, and to the slow corruption of the data as it
       was sent over innumerable fone lines phrom modem to modem. To
       avoid the phurther corruption of this very usephul inphormation,
       I would ask two things:

          1. That any comments, notes, additions, etc. be placed at
             the very end of this phile, not just stuck wherever you
             pheel like it.  I have put a sample addition in at the
             end of this file for convenience.  Please leave:
                -  Your name (your phake name that would be used phor
                   BBS' and such, not your real name)
                -  The date
                -  Where you can be reached (BBS' etc.)
                -  The inphormation you wish to leave
          2. That any random corruptions phound while reading (such
             as the word "SMOKEBOMB" appearing as "SMO´EBOMB") are
             phixed (I'm sure that some smartass will be tempted to
             phix the example I have just given.  Please don't).

       Thank you phor your cooperation in this matter.  Please give
       this phile to whoever you can, knowing that it will probably
       have grown substantially by the next time you phind it.  Also,
       when you do phind it again, and it is a newer version than you
       have, delete the older version and only distribute the newer
       one.

From:  The Terrorist's Handbook 


                               SMOKE BOMBS

     One type of pyrotechnic device that might be employed by a terrorist in
many way would be a smoke bomb. Such a device could conceal the getaway
route, or cause a diversion, or simply provide cover. Such a device, were it
to produce enough smoke that smelled bad enough, could force the evacuation
of a building, for example. Smoke bombs are not difficult to make. Although
the military smoke bombs employ powdered white phosphorus or titanium
compounds, such materials are usually unavailable to even the most well
equipped terrorist. Instead, he/she would have to make the smoke bomb for
themselves.

     Most homemade smoke bombs usually employ some type of base powder, such
as black powder or pyrodex, to support combustion. The base material will
burn well, and provide heat to cause the other materials in the device to
burn, but not completely or cleanly. Table sugar, mixed with sulfur and a
base material, produces large amounts of smoke. Sawdust, especially if it has
a small amount of oil in it, and a base powder works well also. Other
excellent smoke ingredients are small pieces of rubber, finely ground
plastics, and many chemical mixtures. The material in road flares can be
mixed with sugar and sulfur and a base powder produces much smoke. Most of
the fuel-oxodizer mixtures, if the ratio is not correct, produce much smoke
when added to a base powder. The list of possibilities goes on and on. The
trick to a successful smoke bomb also lies in the container used. A plastic
cylinder works well, and contributes to the smoke produced. The hole in the
smoke bomb where the fuse enters must be large enough to allow the material
to burn without causing an explosion. This is another plus for plastic
containers, since they will melt and burn when the smoke material ignites,
producing an opening large enough to prevent an explosion.

***WARNING***
AS I KNOW, IN CALIFORNIA, THERE IS A LAW THAT PROHIBITS SMOKE SCREENS.  IF
YOU GET CAUGHT SCREENING UP THE STREETS, DON'T MENTION YOUR MENTOR TO THE
COPS.  AND IF YOU WANT TO BE A NINJA, OR JUST A RAD DUDE, DON'T FUCK AROUND
IN THE WRONG PLACES, AT THE WRONG TIME...


BACKGROUND ON SMOKE SCREENS:
----------------------------
SMOKE SCREENS WERE USED BY THE NINJA FOR A WAY OF ESCAPING IN TIGHT SITUA-
TIONS.  THE NINJA HAD TWO TYPES OF SMOKE SCREENS.  ONE THAT REQUIRES A FLINT
AND STONE, AND ONE THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY HEAT.  I WILL DESCRIBE THE ONE
WHICH REQUIRES A LITTLE HEAT.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT A HOT DAY IN L.A. ON TOP
OF A BLACK CAR CAN IGNITE THIS SMOKE BOMB.  THE NINJA USED TO CALL THE SMOKE
SCREENS, 'REI SEI NO KIRI', OR SPIRITUAL FOG, OR 'NAGE DAMA' OR HURLED SMOKE.
I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE 'REI SEI NO KIRI' OR SPIRITUAL FOG.  PEOPLE HAVE
THOUGHT OF THE NINJA AS MAGICAL BEINGS, MOST AMERICANS THINK THEY ARE MYTH-
ICAL, BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEARD STORIES FROM FICTIONAL BOOKS.  THE NINJA DON'T
JUST DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR OR WALK THRU WALLS, THEY SPRAY SOME SMOKES TO
HIDE SOME WHERE TEMPORARILY UNTIL THE OPPONENT IS PUZZLED AND LEAVES.  I WILL
DISCUSS SOME OF THESE TECHNIQUES IN THIS ISSUE.


REI SEI NO KIRI
---------------
THE OLD WAY OF PREPARING THE SMOKE SCREEN IS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT DAY
THEREFORE, I CANNOT REALLY TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE IT THE OLD WAY.  THE INGRE-
DIENTS OF THE OLD RECIPE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.  BUT I DO HAVE THE ANCIENT
RECIPE AND THE INGREDIENTS.  SINCE I KNOW THAT NONE OF YOU, I REPEAT, NONE
OF YOU CAN GET THE INGREDIENTS TO THE OLD RECIPE, WHICH INCLUDES, AGED AND
FINE POWDERED WOLF DUNG (WHICH MAY BE OBTAINABLE BY SHIPPING VIA CHINA), I
KNOW AS A FACT, THAT IN JAPAN, THEY DO NOT SELL THOSE THINGS, ALSO THE BONES
THE SEA EEL IN POWDERED FORM (WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED IN CHINA, SINCE IT IS
USED FOR MEDICINE DOWN THERE), AND MANY OTHER ODD INGREDIENTS WHICH IS TOTAL-
LY INOBTAINABLE.

-----------
INGREDIENTS
-----------
THIS IS THE INGREDIENTS OF THE NEW RECIPE WHICH DOESN'T WORK AS GOOD AS THE
OLD RECIPE, BUT WORKS GOOD ENOUGH TO COVER YOURSELF IN THE SMOKE WITH ENOUGH
TIME TO DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR.

- POWDERED SUGAR                 <- EASILY OBTAINED AT THE LOCAL GROCER'S
- SODIUM NITRATE (SALT PETER)    <- CAN BE OBTAINED AT THE DRUG STORE
- SULFER  (OPTIONAL)             <- IF POSSIBLE, BUT NOT NECESSARY
- CHARCOAL OR FINE POWDERED CARBON (OPTIONAL)  <-CRUSHED CHARCOAL WILL DO
- A FIRE CRACKER WICK OR OTHER TYPES OF HEATING DEVICE


--------------
HOW TO MAKE IT
--------------
IT IS QUITE SIMPLE TO MAKE THE SMOKE SCREEN IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE THE OPTIONAL
INGREDIENTS.  JUST MIX THE SUGAR WITH THE SALT PETER, IN THE RATIO OF 3 PARTS
SUGAR, 2 PARTS SALT PETER.  YOU HAVE TO MIX IT GOOD SO THAT THE SALT PETER IS
DISTRIBUTED WELL WITH THE SUGAR.  THEN YOU CAN STORE IT IN SOME MEDICINE
BOTTLE OR A BEER CAN.  IF YOU LIGHT THE CONTENTS IN THE MEDICINE BOTTLE IN A
ROOM, IT WILL FILL A ROOM OF ABOUT 12 FEET BY 12 FEET ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN
ESCAPE ANY SITUATION.  IF YOU PUT IT IN A BEER CAN, (NOTE: THE BEER CAN DOES
NOT HAVE TO BE DRIED OUT FOR THIS TO WORK.) IT CAN FILL A STREET WITH SMOKE
AND LAST FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES, WHICH IS PLENTY OF TIME TO GET YOUR ASS OUT OF
ANY SITUATION.  WELL I THINK ENOUGH IS SAID ABOUT THE EASY SMOKES.
**OPTIONAL**
IF THE EASY WAY CREATES ALL THAT SMOKE, THEN WHY IS THERE AN OPTIONAL ONE,
RIGHT?  WELL I INCLUDED THE OPTIONAL ONE SINCE THE OPTIONAL ONE CAN DAMAGE
THE ENTRAPPED VICTIM IN THE SMOKE PRETTY BAD.  I MEAN BAD ENOUGH SO THAT THE
VICTIM CAN PASS OUT AND DIE, IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF IT GOING IN A HOUSE OR
SOMETHING.  I'D ADVISE YOU TO STICK WITH THE EASY ONE, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE
OUT THERE IS CURIOUS ENOUGH TO BE A KILLER SO I WILL INCLUDE THE OPTIONAL
VERSION.
YOU MUST FIRST CRUSH THE CHARCOAL.  YOU NEED A LUMP OF CHARCOAL PER OUNCE OF
SUGAR USED.  I WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE THE 3 OUNCE OF SUGAR VERSION OF THE
SMOKE SCREEN.  YOU CAN ALTER THE MEASUREMENTS FOR LARGER QUANTITIES.
THE CHARCOAL IS BETTER THAN POWDERED CARBON, ESP. IF THE CHARCOAL IS MATCH-
LIGHT.  (NOTE: IF YOU HAVE PLAIN CHARCOAL, YOU SHOULD USE LIGHTER FLUID WITH
THE CHARCOAL.)  MAKE SURE THAT THE CHARCOAL IS VERY FINE.  NEXT MAKE YOUR
3:2 MIXTURE OF THE SUGAR AND THE SODIUM NITRATE.  3 OZ. OF SUGAR TO 2 OZ. OF
SODIUM NITRATE.  THEN, MIX THE 3 LUMPS OF CRUSHED CHARCOAL INTO THE 3:2 MIX-
TURE, AND MIX VERY WELL.  MIX THE POWDERS UNTIL THE MIXTURE IS A DARK GREY
NEAR GREY, MIXTURE.  THEN GET AN OUNCE OF SULFER AND MIX THE CONTENTS CARE-
FULLY.  DON'T SPILL THE SULFER OR THE MIXTURE ON THE FLOOR OR CARPETING SINCE
IT CAN DAMAGE IT.  WHEN YOU MIX IT WELL ENOUGH, YOU HAVE FINISHED!!!  IF YOU
DO LIGHT THIS SCREEN, BEWARE...YOU ARE RISKING YOUR OWN LIFE.  GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF THERE BUT TRY NOT TO BE SEEN.  TIME THE WICK IF POSSIBLE.  IF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH OF IT GOING IN A ROOM WITH YOUR FAVORITE ENEMY IN IT, IT CAN KILL THE
DUDE WITH 5 MINUTES OF THIS SHIT.  THE THING IS IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET HIS
ASS OUT OF THERE, TOO.  SO JUST KNOCK HIM OUT COLD BEFORE YOU IGNITE THE
SMOKES.  IF HE DOES AWAKE, AFTER THE SMOKE DISSIPATES, HE WILL MOST LIKELY
DIE OF SOME LUNG PROBLEMS.  ANYWAYS, IF YOU WANT HIM TO DIE QUICK WHO GIVES A
DAMN.  BUT, MAKE SURE IF YOU DO THIS DON'T GET YOUR ASS BUSTED.

--------------
WAYS OF ESCAPE
--------------
I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ON THIS ISSUE BUT HERE IS ONE WAY OF EVASION.  FIRST
MOST LIKELY WHEN A PERSON GETS IN SOME HEAT NOWADAYS, IT'S GONNA BE ON THE
STREETS.  SO...LOOK FOR A PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN HIDE OUT FOR A WHILE.
LIGHT ONE NEARBY AND WHEN THE SMOKE GOES UP, LOOK DIRECTLY AT YOUR OPPONENT
UNTIL HE IS VERY DIM AND FAINT, THEN MAKE YOUR MOVE.  GO TO YOUR HIDING
PLACE. AND STAY THERE FOR A WHILE.  WHEN YOU THINK THE COAST IS CLEAR, JAM
WHEREVER YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR ASS SAFE.


WELL...I HAVE SAID ENOUGH ABOUT THIS TOPIC.  WELL...HAVE FUN!!!

PLEASE DO NOT ALTER THIS PHILE IN ANY WAY.  I WANT THIS PHILE TO BE COMPLETE
AND STAY COMPLETE AS IT IS OFFERED TO MANY CURIOUS MINDS.  YOU MAY SHARE THIS

YOUR SELF.

               Smoke Bombs                         by the BHU


Here is the recipe for one helluva smoke bomb!

4 parts sugar
6 parts potassium nitrate (Salt Peter)

Heat this mixture over a LOW flame until it melts, stirring well.
Pour it into a future container and  before it solidifies.  Imbed a
few matches into the mixture to use as fuses.  One pound of this
stuff will fill up a whole block with thick white smoke!

                                Cacodyal


Since it is not feasible to make napalm in your kitchen, you will have to be
satisfied with cacodyal. This made by chemically extracting all the oxygen
from alcohol, and then replacing it, under laboratory controls, with metal
arsenic. The formula for alcohol is C4 H5 O, whereas for cacodyal it is
C4 H5 AR. Now, this new substance, cacodyal, possesses spontaneous
inflammability, the moment it is exposed to the air. Therefore it can be put
into a bottle and used like a Molotov Cocktail. If it is thrown, it will
explode on impact, but this is not its real advantage. When it explodes, a
dense white smoke is given off. This is white arsenic, a deadly poison. One
inhalation will probably cause death in a matter seconds.
