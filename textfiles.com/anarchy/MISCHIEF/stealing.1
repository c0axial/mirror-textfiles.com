 First you need to get into the car.  The easiest and fastest way is
to use a device that all the towing companies use in case you locked
your keys in your car.  Well here is the design for it.  Make it out
of sheet metal or just use a metal ruler about an inch by 2 feet and
make it as close as you can to the diagram.

 Once you have contructed this thing, stick it into the side of the door
(between the window and the door) and feel for a pin inside.  Once you
have found it, push down slowly and the pull up fast and it should work.
It make take some practice, but you will get it eventually.
 
 Yes, we have all the seen the movies and how those bad guys can easily
duck under the dashboard and two seconds later have the car started.  Is
this possible?  Yes it is, just it takes quite a bit of practice to
get as good as they.
 
 Each car has it's own wiring system, so each car is different and you
should know the car's wiring system before you try to hot-wire.  You
can get car manuals which show the whole wiring system.  You should be
looking for two wires that have some connection with the ignition switch.
t(Usually on older cars they are two red ones.  These are the ones to cross
over.  It make take some looking to find these wires, and you might need
to experiment on the car, which may cause some damage if you cross over
two wrong wires and short out the electrical system.
 
 If you totally questioned about where to start under the dashboard, then go
for the ignition and cross all the wires that have to do with that.  Eventually
you will get a pair of wires that will start the car.  What you are basically
doing is trying to bypass the ignition switch.  The easiest cars to
hot-wire are the older ones, but they are not worth as much.
 
 What to do next after you got it started? Jam the fuck out of there and
take it to a safe place, usually your garage (but make sure it's off the streets
and that no one can see it and identify it).  Next, you need take off the
license plates, then remove all registration numbers.  The main one is on
the dash.  There are usually some in the truck (along the sides and bottom) and
sometimes on the sides of doors.  You basically need to take apart the car and
search for anything that can link the car to someone (names, papers, etc).
 
 After you have remove all traces of it being a stolen car, you need to get
new plates and have it registered in case you get pulled over by the cops
and they ask for registration.  I won't go into detail as to how to get a
car registered, because they are lengthy and there are several of them.
Generally you need to outsmart the DMV, or confuse them at least.
 
 Having it registered and new plates you can have it painted and re-done
inside.  This is only in case the previous owner sees the car in some
parking lot while you are shopping and can identify it by dents or scratches
only known to him.  (Then you be in a lot of trouble).
 
 But remember, grand theft auto is a felony (but the law only exists when
you get caught).
