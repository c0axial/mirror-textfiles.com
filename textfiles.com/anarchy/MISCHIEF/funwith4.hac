    If your mark is an oily cuss with a credibility problem you should easily
pull off this stunt.  It involves a cop, reporters, SPCA folks and some farm
animals.  Call the police and tell them you know about a cock or dog fight
that's being held at your mark's home.  Explain that you have no morals
against animal fighting but you lost big money there last time and think the
fights are fixed.  Next call your mark and report to him that some people
are holding dog or cock fights on his property.  Call the reporters and SPCA
and tell them all about the fight.  Mention that your mark and the cops have
a payoff relationship.  Give everyone the same general arrival time, never be
too specific.  Hopefully, all will sort of show up at the same time.  You might
manipulate things so the press and animal lovers show up first.  Even if a
real story doesn't develop, you have scattered some strong seeds of distrust.
If you want a stronger story, find a dead dog on the road or something and
plant it near by and tell the reporters and SPCA where to find the evidence.
It will be fun to hear your mark and the cops talk about everything to the
reporters.


    Dead animals are very useful.  Wait until your mark goes on a trip and will
be leaving his car or house empty for several days.  Get into the car
or house and stuff very large and very dead animals everywhere.  Your mark will
probably have to sell his car and fumigate his house when he returns.

    If you are bothered by big dogs chasing you just take a good quality
plastic water pistol and fill it with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  Shoot
the furball right in the eyes and it'll soon stop the canine harassment.
