MATERIALS
~~~~~~~~~

1)   1 clock (tick tock tick tock)
2)   steel wool
3)   2 big batteries
4)   wire
5)   electrical tape
6)   scissors
7)   1 glass jar
8)   gasoline
9)   the explosive including the fuse
10)  a tiny I.Q.

1)   Take the clock and rip off the glass cover on the front.  Cut off
     the second hand and the hour hand so the only hand ticking is the
     minute.

2)   Now, take the wire and cut off the plastic covering on the end so
     the copper is showing, and tape it on the minute hand so the bare 
     part is facing the way the clock is going (clockwise). 

3)   Now, take another wire and cut off the end so the copper part is
     showing and tape it on the clock sticking up, so eventually the 
     wire you taped on the minute hand will hit the wire sticking up.

4)   Then hook up the batteries like this:

              ______________  < wire
  positive _[  ]__     [     ]   negative
           [     ]     [     ]
           [     ]     [     ]
           [     ]     [_   _]
           [_____]       [__]      positive
  negative    \           /
               \         /     < wire
                \       /

5)   Now, take one of these wires and hook it up to the wire on the
     minute hand.  

6)   Then extend the wire ON the clock, sticking up.

It should look like this: 
                            ____________
                           /            \   < wire
                   #    # /              \
                #        / #              \    _________
              #        #/    #             \__[         ]
             #        #       #             __[batteries]
             #       #   ]    #            /  [_________]
              #           \  #            /
                #          \#            /
                   #    #   \           /
                             \         /
                              \       /  < two important wires
                                    
7)   Now, take your steel wool and put one piece on both of the (two 
     important wires).

8)   Fill up a glass jar with gasoline and put the two important wires
     with the steel wool connected to both of them, inside the jar.

9)   Put your fuse for your explosive inside the jar with the two
     important wires and you're all set.

The minute hand ticking with the wire on it will hit the wire sticking up.  
This will make a conduction of electricity through the batteries making the 
steel wool burst into red-hot pieces.  This will reliably ignite the gasoline 
in the jar which will ignite the fuse to the explosive (slick, huh?)  

Only one problem: don't use alot of wire when you're wiring this up..  If you 
do, there will not be enough electricity to burn the steel wool.  

The other way is:  

How to Make a smoke Bomb:

  -There are several ways to do it, but
   I think this is about the best.  After the end of the formula, I'll put some
   varyations.  Here's what you do:

Requirements-

Sugar (powdered works best, but any will do)
Saltpeter (you can get this at a hardware store)

OK, take 4 ounces of sugar and 6 ounces of saltpeter (you can use more, but keep 

the porportions right) and put them in a pot.  Heat them over a low flame, 
stirring constantly, until it is liquid.  Pour it into a container (more on this 

later) and let it harden.

What kind of container, you ask?  Well, that depends on the circumstances.  You 
can just put it into a paper cup and light the cup, if you want.  Or, you could 
put it in a glass jar with a hole in the top for the fuse and seal the hole 
around the fuse.  Another way to do it is to pour it into a mold, stick a fuse 
in, and wait till it hardens.

How do I make a fuse?  Very simple.  Take some sturdy string and dip it in wax. 
You now have a fuse suitable for a smoke bomb.

Which bomb should I use?  The paper cup is good to just light it and chuck it. 
The glass jar (if made right) will shatter as the smoke builds up.  I'd advise 
against that, cause it sends shards of glass everywhere, and it doesn't work 
unless you do it perfectly right.  What you need to do is stop the hole with wax 

after you put the fuse in.  then, when the fuse burns down to there, the wax 
melts and fills over the hole.  More often than not, either the hole isn't 
filled properly or the wax gets popped out instead of the jar breaking.

Anyway, the mold is nice if you want to make a small, professional looking bomb. 
 
You can use almost anything for the mold.  I like to take liquid rubber (you can 

get it at a hobby shop) and brush it over something like a pencil or whatever 
and paint it so it looks real (from a VERY great distance).  You can also just 
pour it into an ice cream scoop or something.  Stick the fuse in right after you 

pour the mixture.  You should use a fuse about 1 1/2 inches long, with an inch 
sticking out.

Now that I have the bomb, what do I do with it?  Easy.  You light it and put it 
somewhere where  it will cause trouble.  You can light it and drop it near a 
smoke detector, or put it in a heating vent at your school.  Now, if getting 
caught is a problem, you can do one of two things:

1) use a really long fuse, and dip it more than once in the wax, or
2) make a timer.

               
How to make the EASIEST fuse:

  Take a piece of thin string.  Soak it in hot wax.  Let it dry. Light it. Run. 
  Simple Enough?

How to get free postage:

Introduction
------------

     If you've ever paid 29 Cents to mail a letter, you've been wasting your
money.  In a recession year such as this one, especially, it's important not
to let your hard earned dollars (and cents) go to another beauracracy.

     Twenty Nine Cents  is not  an aweful lot to  save, but  if you send ten
letters a week, you could save up to $150.  If you send only 8 (The national
average)  You could save  $120, and so on.  This file will describe the four
methods I know of for avoiding or greatly reducing postage fees.  Be counted
and count your savings!

     All us Americans know that sometimes  blind people can be discriminated
against. The government understands this too, and since mailing packages can
be expensive, the government has decided to allow blind people to send their
mail for free.  "How Generous of Them!"  You think.   Wrong!  They're paying
for it with your tax money!   You pay your taxes,  why shouldn't you be able
to send your packages free too?  Well, now you can.  Here's how to do it.

     Address your envelope like you normally would,  but in the corner where
you would normally put the stamp,  write in neat print  "FREE MATTER FOR THE
BLIND."   Now drop your package in one of  those blue mailboxes  you'll find
on any street corner.  It really works.

     The  government isn't being that nice, though.   Packages stamped "FREE
MATTER FOR THE BLIND"  are sent at library rate, which is below Third Class!
To send a letter locally will take anywhere from two to five days, national-
ly will take considerably longer.

     This method is kind of obvious, but in my experience,  it has worked.
However, it won't work if you're trying to send letters nationally,  it'll
only work if the two addresses share the same post office.   Write your
letter, and put it in the envelope.  Now, instead of writing your name in
the return  address spot, write  your name in the addressee spot,  on the
center of the page.  Write the  addressee's name in the return address spot.

     Now drop it in the mailbox  without any postage.   Guess what's going
to happen.  The letter will be  returned to the sender who,  in this  case,
seems to be the addressee.

    Both of the above methods are slow, but if you'd like to send your mail
at normal first class rates, here's a way to do it.  This way doesn't save
you money, though, unless the recipient agrees to give.

    Before sending your letter, coat the front side of the stamps with glue
(Elmer's works fine.)  It's best to use a stiff bristled brush dipped in the
glue to coat the stamps with.  It will take about twenty minutes to dry.
Once the stamps have dried, stick them on your letter and mail it.  The glue
has created a coating that can not be seen by the eye, but will protect the
stamps from being destroyed by the cancellation mark.   When the letter
arrives at it's destination, the recipient can remove the coating with water,
take the stamps off the envelope, and reuse the stamps.

This is a diagram of what your letter should look like.  It'd look just like
a normal letter, you can see.. But the 29 Cent stamp must be coated with
glue.

    The US Postal Service, as you may or may not be aware, is a private 
corporation.  Congress has the power to set postal rates, not the Post Office.  
This is stated in Section 8 of the US Constitution.   Last time congress set 
postal rates, they set them at two cents.   So two cents is all you legally have
to pay for mailing your letters.  Try it out, this really works!

    Get some a set of those stamp letters with the alphabet on them, or get the 
rubber stamps specially made up by your local printer.  Use Red ink to stamp 
"FIRST CLASS MAIL" and "NON-DOMESTIC" on the top or left hand side of your 
envelope, and black or blue ink to stamp:

"TWO CENT POSTAGE
 12 STATUTES AT LARGE
 CHAPTER 71, SECTION 23
 LOCAL/DROP LETTER
 81 U.S. STATUTE 613"

One of the keys to making this work is that it seem official looking.  It works 
for me, but if you drop twenty letters in the same mailbox all like this, it's 
less likely to work.

  -Put tape where the ink comes out on the machine.
