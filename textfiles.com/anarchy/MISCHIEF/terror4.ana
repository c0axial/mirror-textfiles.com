  So you say you had a dream last night about hijacking a twa and taking it to
lebanon....well this should provide you with many exciting nights and
distraught neighbors.


  For these exercises you will need the following items:

10 m-16's
15 shrapnel grenades
2 flamethrowers
2-3 spools of fish line (the stronger the better)
3-4 packs of bottle rockets
3-4 packs of m-80's
3-4 packs of 'jumping jacks'
20 small balloons
Water ..hmm what could that be for?
Eggs...optional
4 bricks
3-6 10 ball roman candles
A 6 inch tube about big enough for a marker to fit in and closed at one end
Spool of string
10-20 empty liter bottles (like pepsi) or some coffee cans
1 roll of transparent tape
Some tacks or nails
A small mallet or hammer
Lawn mower w/bag
A tarp
A couple newspapers
A few centerfolds...use some ugly ones
A pocketknife
Some dark clothing
Black shoes if possible
Panty hose....optional
An empty 16 oz. pepsi bottle
A old rag
Some gas or kerosene
Some alcohol
2-3 ping-pong balls
Gunpowder
2-3 feet of fuse...optional but recomended
A lighter or 2-3 packs of matches
A can of wd-40 or almost any aerosol
A good lock
Charming face w/fast legs
A pair of pliers
A quater or half-dollar
A wire-cutter
A large and small screwdriver
4-5 small paper bags
Ample supply of dog shit
2 watermelons
A candle
A smoke bomb
A bong...optional but it definitely heightens the experience and you will feel
	 more apt to try and accompish these feats

basic terrorism:
----------------
  Ok....the below ideas are for the new and unexperienced terrorist....they are
mainly just for fun and have quick results

  Holding up traffic:  well what would you do if you were driving down the road
around 2 am half-drunk,stoned,and wasted and saw little...maybe not so
little...balls of colored flame shooting through the air ahead from the
road?....well you would either freak and go straight or more likely freak and
wreck...that is the whole idea....to do this you use 1 or 2 10 ball roman
candles and the bricks.....to assemble place two bricks side by side about an
inch apart and then place a third brick behind them on the opposite side from
which you want it to shoot....then place another brick on top of the first two
and place and aim the candle in the space between the bricks.

  The next trick is yard littering...  to do this spread a tarp on the grass
and place a crumpled newspaper in the tarp....then run over it with your lawn
mower....transfer the now shredded newspaper to another bag and decorate
someone's lawn.

  While you are at it tape a centerfold on the glass door and give 'em a ring
then use those fast legs to haul ass

  Now if you truly hate these people you can give someone a good deal of small
cuts by hammering the tacks or nails on the molding around the door....then
string some fish line around the nails at any height or all up and down the
door.

  Now this trick won't work to well at night but will during a two-period
chemisrty lab....just hold a quarter over your bunsen burner or lighter for a
few minutes and toss it into the hall when the bell ring...someone will learn
to not pick everything up off the ground.

  Another idea for school requires a candle and a smoke bomb....tape the candle
to the smoke bomb leaving the wick about 1-2 inches above the fuse..  leave
this in the school bathroom...	light it and in about 10 minutes when the
candle burns down the smoke bomb will go off....of course you'll be talking to
a teacher or in class about the time it goes off leaving you in the clear

  Genuine fun:
  ------------
  Find a good road in your neighborhood or somewhere else where only one car
will be going by at a time....if the road is too busy this won't work...  now
take some fish line and get enough to stretch across the road and clear it on
both sides by 2-3 feet....you must also find a place with mail boxes or
electric boxes across the road from each other....now tie the fish line to two
of the liter bottles on each side ...the idea is to set the line up so it will
be just above fender level you must also make sure that while the bottles will
not fall over that the will come off when a car passes....  after a car passes
watch and see how far your little present stays with them...coffee can may be
preferred because they produce a more pleasing effect to the ears when dragging
behing the victim...also don't stand too close to the line incase you catch an
ulikely jogger

  Also did you ever believe in santa as a kid...well we have a new variation on
chimney suprises...just go by the nearest supermarket and obtain (how ever you
want) a watermelon...  decorating the watermelon is optional becuase it is
likely that the decorations will be messed up during action.....anywayz now for
hard part....in some way climb up to the top of their chimney and drop the
water melon down their chimney...if there is one of those damn grates on top
take it home for a souvenir

  Ever seen those luminaria things around christmas time?...well this idea can
be used at the same time as the fake santa to create a real feeling of
christmas and 'gift'-giving ok now....take that ample supply of shit and fill
some little paper bags (about 4)...then spray it with gas and leave your 'gift'
on someone's porch and light the bag....then ring the door..haul ass...and
watch to see if the person is in a christmassy spirit....by the way watch to
see if they try and stomp it out...that's messy eh?

Obvious:
--------
  Of course don't forget to smash the pumpkins on halloween

  Bottle rockets shot from hand-held tubes at joggers or passing cars

  Trip wires or clothes-lines across well-traveled paths

  You say you hear a bed squeakin through the window?...well take a look with
your high-powered lantern or headlights....ever seen two people jump so quick?

  Placing or re-placing a lock on a storage shed or crawlspace

  Ring and run with jumping jacks and m-80's left for their viewing pleasure

  Toss someone's doormat or paper up on their roof

  Climb on mr.	neighbor's roof and slam dance with your friends...then when he
comes out cover him with shit or just run

  Tying fish line to someone's knocker and while spooling out extra and being
careful not to pull it taunt walk across the street and take out your bottle
rockets and tube....then when you're set up pull the line and hold your lighter
ready...then when someone answers let 'em have it...good aim pays off here!!!

  And of course water balloons...but with a twist...make sure that these are
small...like no bigger than a shrunken baseball...and also make sure that they
are white....to a casual observer (no such thing really) it will look like
eggs...also do this from a car with hard-rock blasting...  then 'egg'
everything in sight...of course you don't have to fill them with water...it can
be mud,shaving cream,or milk for a better splattering effect

Pyro fun:
---------
  Go to your local roses and pick up some ping-pong balls (unless you still
play it outside of pe) and drill a whole in the top....now fill it up with some
gun powder...to light this (your gone if you casually light it by hand) either
make a trail with gas and light that or use a fuse about 2 ft.	long...needless
to say haul ass to watch this....if it works it will shoot a falme in the air
for a decent while or simply explode

  Have you ever sprayed anything across your lighter?....well it can have some
interesting applications....first its a nice little torch...then its a big
improvement over your lighter...  and then its a bomb (you will have found this
out by now if you sprayed that wd-40 for too long)...to make this first take
that little button off the top and place some duct tape over the little nozzle
holding it down....  then punch a hole in the tape above the nozzle....the can
should now be continuously spraying now....and any day now whenever you feel
like it just strike a match and need i reapeat haul ass

  Now lets's try an experiment....ever made a molotov cocktail?...do you know
what that is?...basically its a cheap type bomb that was used in wwi by
resistors with no other ammo.  how to construct a molotov cocktail:  ok now
like i said this is an experiment....get your 16 oz.  pepsi bottle (or coke if
you want to tell them that you don't like it now) and fill with gas,kerosene,or
both....  now soak a rag in gas and let it dry..  then stuff the bottom half
into the mouth of the bottle...now find a nice lookin porche or open
field,light the rag and throw(you better toss it quick too!)....this isn't
supposed to explode but rather throw flaming gas everywhere for a big
radius...so stay clear...maybe you could drop it off a bridge or from a tall
tree if you're a monkey

Electrical terrorism:
---------------------

  Messing up the meter....you know that damned little bubble on the side of
your house (or shack)?....well that's a kilowatt meter...it tells the power co.
how much power you used by the little circles inside....now messing with these
can be fun esp.  if it isn't yours.....keep in mind it's a felony..  but who
cares?	right?....ok now there is usually a little plastic tag with a looped
wire hanging that acts as a lock because they are about impossible to get back
on....if you live near a construction site you may be able to pick a few good
replacement tags,thus allowing you to screw with yours...or make someone's
elses story about not using so much power very hard to believe....simply rip
that tag off and open the box and turn the little dials:


   1  2     1  2    1  2    1  2
  6    3   6	3  6	3  6	3
   5  4     5  4    5  4    5  4

  Ok now that's what it should look like ...just as on an odometer (the mileage
in your car) the right side stands for parts of a kilowatt hour and then the
next dial is for the digits...the next for tens....and then for hundreds or
something like that...anywayz just play around with these until you feel
relieved....now i'm not sure about this....you can probably turn off the
people's power by madly cutting every wire in sight...be sure to use an
insulated wire cutter or wear gloves otherwise you may be found in the morning
and they seeing your charred body holding wire cutters will suspect what you
were up to and may ruin your funeral service for your friends...

  Now for water meters...one of the most effective way to gain revenge on some
bastard that you hate is to turn off his water...the reason this is such an
effective means of revenge, is because getting caught is very difficult unless
you are seen...simply open the cover of their water meter and look for a small
knob, (most have this) use your pliers or wrench to turn the knob, if you are
unsure which way is off, remember where you start, and turn which ever way is
easier until it stops,in the morning you will know if your little scheme has
worked, you can expect to see mr.  neighbor take a leisurly walk to the front
lawn carrying a pair of pliers...

  Telephone services.....  first of all nighttime provides a unique opportunity
for boxing and trying out your new boxes to make sure that they work...do this
via beige box or bud box....ok now back to terrorism ....there are a variety of
things to do to someones telephone line...to get to a single house's phone line
find the little silver box on the back of their house....use your screwdriver
to open it and have fun...you can rewire, cut off service,or make any calls you
want via a beige box knowing that anything you do will be held against their
phone line....there is also the matter of those more interesting larger boxes
with the shitty little bell on them....once you get into these the
possibilities are even bigger.....how about disconnecting the entire
neighborhood (guess this won't be in yours eh?)...well anywayz if you have read
the beige box plans you can also listen to any conversations taking place by
using the alligator clips....

  Ok finally cable....(if you live in the boondocks you may not be able to do
this) ok open that little green box or what ever color it is and again just
have fun switching the wires


  For many more ideas check out 'the anarchists cookbook' 'obtainable' at your
local bookstore (again how you obtain it is your choice however shoplifting
will not be discussed here)
