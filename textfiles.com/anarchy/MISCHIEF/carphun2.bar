     Ok.  Here are some more fun and cool things to do to peoples
cars and stuff.  The first thing that you can do is called
"skunking."  This is a very simple and hiliraious trick.  What you
do is you get a stuffed animal that looks real.  Make sure it is of
close size, color and a real animal.  What I mean by real animal is
don't use a toy giraffe or cabbage patch kid because no one will
believe for a second that it is real.  Once you have picked out
your animal, tie a long piece of fishing string to the head of it. 
Now lay it across the road from a good hiding spot.  When you hear
or see a car coming, start pulling it across the road making it
look real.  If you pick a real enough looking animal, most people
will respond in funny ways.  Some might swerve or brake hard wo
avoid it while other country hicks might aim right for it!  This is
definately a classic maneuver to do during boring summer days. 
Maybe sometinme you can even try it with one of those lifelike baby
dolls by tying a string to each arm and pulling them to give the
impression that the baby is crawling across the road.  Have fun and
if you piss someone off, run.  It is always fun to run away from
people who are after you.  If you are lucky, you might even get
chased!
     Another neato thing that one can do is the wedding day trick. 
It is simple and esay but it sometimes takes something like this to
get it going in your mind.  All you do is tie a long string of cans
to the bumper of a car.  It is best if you can do it while a car is
stopped at a light because then they wont notice it until they star
moving again.  Notihing too exciting, but it is fun.
     Lastly for this txt, I have the ultimate.  It will take a
bunch of your friends, a couple of screwdrivers and a wicked sense
of humor.  What you do is go with your friends to a mall parking-
lot and switch everyones license plates!  Well, not everyone, but
enough people that it will cause mass confusion!  Just unscrew a
bunch of plates, and then screw them on different cars mixing the
front and back numbers.  In most cases, people won't even know that
their license plate is different until they get home, or even
later.  HAHA, just wait until 10 or 20 people have two different
license plates on their car!  What havok, what a disturbance.  It
will take them dayes to get their real plates back.  This is
definately one of the best things that you can do.  Enjoy.
