     The recording of any private conversation is against the law unless both
parties have given consent, and know that a type of listening/recording device
is being used.



                  WHERE TO GET THEM

     As far as bugs goes, don't worry about not being able to obtain them.
Sure, there are some suppliers around that only sell to 'Law Enforcement
Agencies' only, but most will sell to you, so there is no reason to bother
with social engineering yourself one.  Anyway, most suppliers that will only
sell to law enforcement agencies usually have their products so marked up, its
unrealistic.  Good bargains, and very high quality equipment can be found
offered by a Japanese
company called CONY.  Usually their products are so
reasonable that it makes the competators cry in shame.  I suggest you write to
them.

                          WHERE AND HOW TO STICK THEM

     Assuming
 you obtain a bug, or any combination of different types of bugs,
you will want to use them, for any number of particular purposes.  The safest
and easiest way to plant a bug is to send the person that you want to know
better a nice gift with you know what hidden inside it.  Something that they
could, say, place on their desk, or display prominently in their place or work
or residence.  Wrap it nice, and include a small card, and do whatever you feel
is appropriate.

     They will never guess...

     A more dangerous method is to actually obtain entry into the office or
residence of the person that you want to know better.  If you have success in
getting in, planting it, and getting out unnoticed, then you will be safe.
Once a bug is planted, you will leave it there even after it becomes
inoperative, because, if you have placed considerable risk on yourself to plant
it, you do not want to go through that risk again just to retrieve it.  Just
forget about it.  It won't miss you.

     There are a number of p
laces to hide your electronic friend:

          o Carefully [!] unscrew a wall socket.  There, you will notice some
            extra, unused space inside.  Figure out the rest.

          o Do like the shows on TV.  Hide them under a table, or chair.  Let
            your imagination run wild [use good judgement].  You are relitively
            free, due to today's bug technology, and the short antennaes.
            Pick an area that is not subject to 'search or routine cleaning'.

          o Dress up like a workman and show up at their house.  Make up a good
            excuse.  Gain access.  Plant it.


                                  UTILIZATION

     You will want to record all that you can get with this bug for later
review.  Also, take into consideration, that you can't be at the receiver 24
hours a day.  The setup to use for maxium efficiency is a recorder with a VOX.
Therefore, tape waste will be at a bare minimum.  That's also good, because you
don't want to be at the receiver just to flip tap
es every half hour to 45 minutes.  Also, it would be difficult to review these
tapes, because you would have to listen to a half hour recording for an actual
half hour, and so on. Well, those half hours will add up into hours, into
hours, into hours.  Not smart.  As said, invest in a VOX.  This will make it
able to have the recorder skip over those quiet times in your target's house.

     To save tape you could slow down the recorder with electronics, if you
have the electronics.  You might not be successful, because it becomes
difficult to tell the speech of people  from  background  noise.  Please  note
that  not  every  technique  is discussed here.  This is a scratch of the
surface.

     Also...

     If you can, use metal tapes [if the recorder has that capability].  If
not, use low noise/extended range tapes.

     And...

     As with most surveillance equipment, be sure that you know what you are
doing.  This is a game in which you can be charged hundreds of dollars for
something that you could do y
ourself with 35 bucks.

     Example...

     Some companies sell recorders which claim to be able to record 14 hours on
a standard cassette.  They have simply removed the pulley from the drive shaft
of a Panasonic or Sony recorder that costs less than 50 dollars and jacked up
the price 300%.  Try it yourself, save money.


                              ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY

     There is a nice device called a shotgun mic that allows you to point it at
a window and listen in on a conversation in the immedia
te room, because of the
room's sound waves causing the window glass to vibrate.  The window must be
closed.  Since all you have to do is point it and go, well, they become
obviously convienent.  And fun.  Find one.  They might cost a little more, but
worth it.  And the target is not likely to know he is being watched, so he will
not be smart enough to enact countermeasures [more on this the next file].


                                    CLOSING

     Not everything is discussed here, but there is enoughto get you started
with an exciting and profitable new hobby.
