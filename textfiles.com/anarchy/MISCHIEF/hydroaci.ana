The hydrochloric acid goody is the most fun in the whole book.	It takes many
forms and works on the simple chemical principle that hydrochloric acid reacts
with aluminum powder, foil or metal, releasing a great dark cloud of noxious gas
which looks horrible and smells worse.

  Hydrochloric acid is used for killing algae in swimming pools and for cleaning
tile and stone work.

  Where swimming pools are common it can be bought at any hardware store for a
couple of dollars for a gallon.

  Being only 37% strenght, it is seldom harmful to the skin but will eat through
clothing like battery acid. Hydrochloric acid also goes by the name Muriatic
acid.

  On damp nights, a bottle of the acid alone, broken in the midst of a crowd
will form noxious clouds of chlorine gas.  Scream "poison gas!" and you will
have a panic on your hands that will give you many laughs.

  When you get some, open it up and give it a sniff.  It won't harm you because
you couldn't stand to smell enough to be harmed.  Then put a couple of square
inches of alluminum foil in a can in your sink and pour some acid on the foil.
If the acid bottle has been tightly capped the reaction of breaking down the
aluminum and producing a dark noxious gas should start in about a minute.  It
the bottle has been setting for months, poorly capped, the reaction may start
immediately.  You can stop the action at any time by turning onj the faucet and
flodding the mess with water.

  When you have tested the reaction with foil, try it with powder and then with
aluminum metal cut from a pipe or a slab.

  The versatility of the hydrochloric acid goody is amazing and should keep you
fascinated for hours.

  The Militants most common use of the hydrochloric acid goody is to clear areas
of people he doesn't like.  In a movie or a meeting hall a tim can full of
aluminum powder, foil or chunks is put under a seat.  The acid is in a bottle
with it's mouth covered with a couple of plastic bags held in place by a rubber
band.  You can also use a plain rubber or a ballon over the mouth of the bottle.

  The cover is pierced with a pencil and the bottle is upended intop the can,
after which the Militant gets up and walks out.  If the acid is old and reacts
immediately, a wad of sponge is put over the aluminum, causing the needed delay.

  A person sitting beside the Militant would not notice anything, especially if
something exciting was happening up front.  By the time he noticed the odor the
reaction would have left him with nothing to do but run squelling and pissing
from the scene.

  The outside goody is great too, It is used to break up parades and demon-
strations and in riots, where it's every man for himself and the devil take the
hindmost.

  It is simply a pint or quart bottle filled with goody and wrapped with several
layers of aluminum foil and put into a paper sack.

  Now say a group of militants infiltrate a civilian parade at different points.
At an agreed upon time they yell, "They're throwing things!"  Then, while the
other paraders are looking around and up, the Militants crash their outside
goodys, still in the sack to the pavement.

  As the parade moves on, the Militants filter back to where their goodies are.
When the reaction starts they scream "Posion gas, Poison gas!" and panic the
whole mob out of the action.

  The aluminum wrapped bottles have to be slammed down hard or they might not
break.	If it is something like a smoke or pipe bomb, there is a better way than
to throw it down.

  It is a good thing to cut out one of your pants pockets for this one.  The
bomb is in a sack under your jacket. You light its fuse with a cigarette and
slip the bomb into your pocket and let it drop down throught your pants leg.
