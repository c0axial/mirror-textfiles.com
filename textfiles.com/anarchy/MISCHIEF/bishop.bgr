                          -Candy For Your Enemies-

       Have you ever seen that gum that tastes like fish?  Well, these
       are alot worse...and alot more fun.

                          *Choclate covered ticks*

   Heres what you'll need:   -Choclate
                             -Some blood filled ticks (rip'em off your dog!)
                             -Someone you really dislike

              This is not a tough one to figure out, get some big old 
              blood inflated ticks and dip them in choclate, let'em ripen
              for a week...and serve...HeHhEhHeH...YuM.


                             *Cadbury Surprise*

   Heres what you'll need:   -A Cadbury cream egg
                             
              These things are so nasty, even by themselvs, I was in 
              a Cadbury coma for a week...(Cadbury O.D.)
              Well, these things are extreemly usefull.  First, with
              the foil still on, slice of the very top of the egg and
              scoop out the inside (DO NOT INHALE!, hahaha) then simply
              fill it up with all the vile discusting shit you can find
              and give it to your pal.  (Solid stuff works better than
              liqued...i.e. HorseRadish works great!)
              AlsO!  If you have some M80's or even some black cats...
              just shove'm in their and throw it at some one.

                        -Fun With Condoms-
                           By: BiSHoP



           Despite preventing child birth condoms can be used for
           a bunch of other things, here are a few ideas.


       Revenge- Fill one with Mayo and send it to a guy you hate,
                include a note saying "You forgot this souviner"
                or something like that...(it helps if they are 
                married.)

       Pranks- Take one and slip it under your victems door, fill
               it up with water using a hose...it should get really
               big and thus, stay under the door...when the victem
               opens the door...BOOM...water everywhere.

       Concerts- Just blow one up at a concert and bounce it around...
                 its fun to see if people will touch it.



                     Have fun! and remember, its all fun and games
                     till someone loses an eye! HeHhEhHeH.

           This will make anyone cry, and wish they were dead.
           Well, not quite...but close.

                Take a small jar and break an egg in it,
                stir well and add an equal amount of urine
                straight from the tap.  Now stir well and leave
                UNCAPPED for 24 hours, (this allows microbes and 
                stuff to fester in the concoction) then replace 
                the cap and put the jar in a safe place.  30 days 
                later...open the jar (gas mask reccomnded) and 
                strain the mixture as best you can into another 
                container. Thats it folks...tell'em BiSHoP sent ya.
