Having Fun With Insects:
様様様様様様様様様様様様
     This is an easy one. You can squash 'em, kill 'em, eat
'em, do whatever ya want with 'em. But one of my favorite ways
is to =-=-=-=>> BURN 'EM!

     This is my favorite way to burn them (and the steps if
you wanta try)! It's fun. I call it the 'Pit Of Doom' or, as
we will refer it to, the POD:

1) Buy some Pringles or any product that has a cylinder like
case.

2) Buy a lighter or a sparker.

3) Buy some bug spray, like OFF!.

4) Go into the woods with your items.

5) Find the insect you hate the most, for me it was the gypsy
moth caterpillar.

6) Spray the inside of the Pringle's can with bug spray
   (Be sure all the chips are gone!)

7) Light the inside of the can. It should be very easy, because
bug spray is extremly flammable.

8) Edge the insect to the top of the POD, the DROP 'EM IN!

9) The insect will light on fire. You can push him around in
the fire, etc.

10) After you have had your fun, blow out the fire (if not
already gone), and take the insect out of the POD. It may still
be alive. See it burn and die!


Oh wHell!, thats it for this issue. In the future look for
more fun with PODs and Bug Spray!
