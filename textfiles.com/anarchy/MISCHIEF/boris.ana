File: BORIS

 A man in exile living in Italy is doing his part to bring down the Soviet
economy. The man who calls himself Boris, writes a letter every week to a 
Soviet dissident and insures it for $400. Since the Soviets never deliver 
letters to dissidents.	Italian postal authorities reimburse Boris, then send
the bill to Moscow, which must pay up or be kicked out of the International
Postal Union. Boris says he makes $20,000 a year writing the letters.  If 
everyone used his  trick, he says, the Soviet economy would collapse.
