For a quick hyper/sugar/caffine rush and buzz, the following works with almost
every one.

Mix in a large pot, bowl, or what ever:
        
5 Little paper baggys of KoolAid. (powder) Any flavor, Grape my Fav.
2 cups of sugar. (Crystal)
1 Bottle of Jolt         
1 Cup of seltzer water
1 Cup of Crystal Pepsi
1 Crushed Vivarin or 2 Crushed No-Doz's
1 Baggy of watermelon jello
2 cups of luke warm water

Now mix it up real good, till its all one color and not lumpy. You might 
want to use an electric blender at setting #2, or #3. Stick in a coffee
cup and SIP. DON'T go gulping it down! Now, With what is left that your
not drinking at the moment, Saran-Rap it and stick it in your refrigerator.
This should keep ya going for a month. If theres not enough, you might wanna
add more water. You decide.
