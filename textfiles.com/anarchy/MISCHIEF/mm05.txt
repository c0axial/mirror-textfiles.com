[32mnumbre 5- laughing gas
By The Beastmaster

So you want a few laughs, eh? Well laughing gas to the rescue. The effect of
this will vary greatly from person to person.  You may experience total numbing
of the body, accompanied by unconrollable urge to laugh, etc. Of course some
people may not experience one or the other and the lasting effect will also vary
greatly.  

Obtaining Lauging Gas....

Well you can do this a few ways. The easiest way is of course to buy it. They
sell it at a place called, 'The Alley' on Clark and Belmont in Chicago. This is
a punk hangout, and this stuff is sold as shit to make whipping cream, but
actually pure N2O (laughing gas). The best way to get there is to take I-57 to
the Dan Ryan I-90/94, then merge into the Kennedy expressway and get off at
Belmont. Make a right turn and go for awhile till you get to Clark. Park on
Belmont somwhere and go to The Alley, whose entrance is in an alley on the
northwest corner or Clark and Belmont. You know you're there when you see the
Dunkin Donuts, which is right next to The Alley.  Go in there and around to
their cash register in the front case.  Right next to the cash register, is
stuff called 'EZ Whip'. These are the N2O canisters. They are $7.50 for a box of
ten, six boxes for $30. Buy as many of these as you want you should get one hit
per canister, depending on the size of balloons you use (read rest of article),
and get a breaker to control gas from the canister, which is about $10.  If you
weren't able to get a breaker from them (they always seem to be out of em) Radio
Shack sells a Brazing Torch for $25 (64-2156). On the Radio Shack model, which
can be used as a breaker, take out the canister on the Green side, LEAVING THE
CANISTER ON THE RED SIDE, and follow the instructions to mount an EZ WHIP
canister in there. Get some easy to blow up balloons from Jewel or something and
release the gas from your canister into the balloon. Note that the canister will
become very cold when you release the gas. Be careful with this. So release the
gas into a balloon (you will get one hit per canister) and release the gas into
your mouth and inhale and exhale INTO the balloon until you can't any longer,
being careful not to inhale any air other than that in the balloon (plug your
nose if you have to). Your effect should then sit in as you are inhaling and
exhaling into the balloon. If you are having any questions, problems,
suggestions, REAL GOOD HIGHS, etc. from this, please drop me a line. If you are
unable to make it to The Alley, follow the following recipe to make your own. I
have not tried the recipe however, so follow it at your own risk. Taking
laughing gas is fun, safe, and practically foolproof.  Some dentists actually
use it instead of novicane, as some patients can't take novicane.

AMMONIUM NITRATE AND LAUGHING GAS

SOME MILITANTS WHO DON'T HAVE MUCH DYNAMITE USE AMMONIUM NITRATE.  THIS
CAN BE BOUGHT BY ANYONE AT $3.75 FOR AN 80 POUND BAG (OLD PRICE).  IT IS A
FERTILIZER.  AMMONIUM NITRATE EXPLODES AT RATES UP TO 14,000 FEET PER SECOND.
IT IS ROUGHLY COMPARED TO DYNAMITE HAVING 60% NITRO. THE FERTILIZER GRADE
MILITANTS USE IS MIXED WITH MOTOR OIL AT THE RATIO OF ONE PINT OF OIL TO 8.5
POUNDS OF AMMONIUM NITRATE.  THIS HAS TO BE DETONATED WITH A STICK OF GELATIN
DYNAMITE. PURIFIED AMMONIUM NITRATE CAN BE DETONATED WITH A NUMBER 6 DYNAMITE
CAP. THE PURE STUFF CAN BE BOUGHT AT CHEMICAL SUPPLY HOUSES OR THE FERTILIZE
RGRADE CAN BE PURIFIED WITH DISTILLED WOOD ALCOHOL. PUT SEVERAL POUNDS OF
FERTILIZER GRADE AMMONIUM NITRATE IN A PAN.  POUR IN ENOUGH WOOD ALCOHOL
(METHANOL) TO COVER THE FERTILIZER.  THEN STIR IT UNTIL A LOT HAS DISSOLVED. 
NEXT, LET IT SET A FEW MINUTES TO ALLOW THE IMPURITIES TO SETTLE TO THE BOTTOM
ALONG WITH THE UNDISSOLVED AMMONIUM NITRATE. ANOTHER PAN IS SET ON SOME PIECES
OF DRY ICE FOR THE NEXT STEP.  THE AMMONIUM NITRATE IS POURED INTO THE COLD PAN. 
THIS IS DONE CAREFULLY SO AS TO LEAVE THE INPURITIES AND UNDISSOLVED AMMONIUM
NITRATE BEHIND. THE DRY ICE CAUSES THE PURIFIED AMMONIUM NITRATE TO PRECIPITATE
OUT OF THE SOLUTION IN CRYSTALS.  WHEN NO MORE CRYSTALS ARE FORMED THEY ARE
REMOVED FROM THE ALCOHOL. THE ALCOHOL IS THEN POURED BACK INTO THE OTHER PAN AND
STIRRED TO DISSOLVE AND AMMONIUM NITRATE LEFT UNDSSOLVED. AFTER SETTING A FEW
MINUTES THE SOLUTION IS AGAIN POURED OFF THE DREGS AND THE DREGS ARE THROWN
AWAY.  WHEN THE LAST BATCH OF CRYSTALS IS REMOVED, THE ALCOHOL CAN BE STORED AND
REUSED. IN ORDER FOR PURE AMMONIUM NITRATE TO BE DETONATED BY A DYNAMITE CAP, IT
MUST BE VERY DRY.  SPREAD IT OUT UNDER A HEAT LAMP OR IN THE SUN.  WHEN
COMPLETELY DRY STORE IN TIGHTLY CLOSES PLASTIC BAGS.

AS A SPECIAL TREAT FOR THE PARTY ANIMALS IN THE AUDIENCE AND SINCE AMMONIUM
NITRATE HAS BENE ON YOUR MINDS FOR A FEW MINUTES, YOU MIGHT AS WELL LEARN HOW TO
MAKE LAUGHING GAS FROM AMMONIUM NITRATE. LAUGHING GAS WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST
ANAESTHETICS.  AFTER A LITTLE WHILE OF INHALING THE GAS THE PATIENT BECAME SO
HAPPY HE COULDN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING. FINALLY HE WOULD DRIFT OFF INTO A
PLEASANT SLEEP. SOME DO-IT-YOURSELFERS HAVE DIED WHILE TAKING LAUGHING GAS. 
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY HAD GENERATED IT THROUGH PLASTIC BAGS WHILE THEIR HEADS
WERE INSIDE. THEY SIMPLY SUFFOCATED, BUT TO TOO WASTED TO EVEN REALIZE THAT.
THE TRICK IS TO HAVE A PLASTIC CLOTHES BAG IN WHICH YOU GENERATE A LOT OF THE
GAS.  THEN YOU STOP GENERATING THE GAS AND HOLD A SMALL OPENING OF THE BAG
UNDER YOUR NOSE, GETTING PLENTY OF OXYGEN IN THE MEANTIME.  THEN WHEE!!
TO MAKE IT YOU START WITH PURE AMMONIUM NITRATE FROM A CHEMICAL SUPPLY
STORE, OR HOMEMADE PURIFIED STUFF. FIRST, DISSOLVE A QUANTITY OF AMMONIUM
NITRATE IN SOME WATER.  THEN YOU EVAPORATE THE WATER OVER THE STOVE,
WHILE STIRRING, UNTIL YOU HAVE A HEAVY BRINE.  WHEN NEARLY ALL THE MOISTURE
IS OUT IT SHOULD SOLIDIFY INSTANTLY WHEN A DROP IS PUT ON AN ICE COLD METAL
PLATE. WHEN READY, DUMP IT ALL OUT ON A VERY COLD SURFACE AND STORE IT IN A
BOTTLE. A SPOONFUL IS PUT INTO A FLASK WITH A ONE HOLE STOPPER, WITH A TUBE
LEADING INTO A BIG PLASTIC BAG.  THE FLASK IS HEATED WITH AN ALCOHOL LAMP.
WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IN THE FLASK REACHES 480F THE GAS WILL GENERATE.  IF
WHITE FUMES APPEAR THE HEAT SHOULD BE LOWERED AS THE STUFF EXPLODES AT 600F.
WHEN THE BAG IS FILLED, STOP THE ACTION AND GET READY TO TURN ON. 

Take this the same way you would the other mentioned, except breatheing into a
plastic bag instead of the balloon. This kind is supposed to be more potent.
