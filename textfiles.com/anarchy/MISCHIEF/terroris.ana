       : ELECTRONIC TERRORISM :

IT STARTS WHEN A BIG, DUMB LUMMOX RUDELY INSULTS YOU.  BEING OF A RATIONAL,
INTELLIGENT DISPOSITION, YOU WISELY CHOOSE TO AVOID A (DIRECT) CONFRONTATION.
BUT AS HE LAUGHS IN YOUR FACE, YOU SMILE INWARDLY---YOUR REVENGE IS ALREADY
PLANNED.

STEP 1:  FOLLOW YOUR VICTIM TO HIS LOCKER, CAR, OR HOUSE.  ONCE YOU HAVE
CHOSEN YOUR TARGET SITE, LAY LOW FOR A WEEK OR MORE, LETTING YOUR ANGER BOIL.

STEP 2:  IN THE MEAN TIME, ASSEMBLE YOUR VERSATILE TERRORIST KIT(DETAILS
BELOW.)

STEP 3:  PLANT YOUR KIT AT THE DESIGNATED TARGET SITE ON A MONDAY MORNING
BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 4:00 AM AND 6:00 AM.  INCLUDE A CALM, SUGGESTIVE NOTE THAT
QUIETLY HINTS AT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER ATTACK.  DO NOT WRITE IT BY HAND!
AN EXAMPLE OF AN EFFECTIVE NOTE:
    "DON'T BE SUCH A JERK, OR THE
     NEXT ONE WILL TAKE OFF YOUR
     HAND.  HAVE A NICE DAY."
NOTICE HOW THE CALM TONE INSTILLS FEAR.  AS IF WRITTEN BY A HOMICIDAL PSYCH
OPATH.

STEP 5:  CHOOSE A STRATEGIC LOCATION OVERLOOKING THE TARGET SITE.  TRY TO
POSITION YOURSELF IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOU CAN SEE HIS FACIAL CONTORTIONS.

STEP 6:  SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE FIREWORKS!


ASSEMBLY OF THE VERSATILE, ECONOMIC, AND EFFECTIVE TERRORIST KIT #1:  THE
PARTS YOU'LL NEED ARE:
 1) 4 AA BATTERIES
 2) 1 9-VOLT BATTERY
 3) 1 SPDT MINI RELAY (RADIO SHACK)
 4) 1 ROCKET ENGINE(SMOKE BOMB OR M-80)
 5) 1 SOLAR IGNITOR (ANY HOBBY STORE)
 6) 1 9-VOLT BATTERY CONNECTOR

STEP 1:  TAKE THE 9-VOLT BATTERY AND WIRE IT THROUGH THE RELAY'S COIL.  THIS
CIRCUIT SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE A PAIR OF CONTACTS THAT WHEN SEPARATED CUT OFF THIS
CIRCUIT.  THESE CONTACTS SHOULD BE HELD TOGETHER BY TRAPPING THEM BETWEEN THE
LOCKER,MAILBOX, OR CAR DOOR.  ONCE THE DOOR IS OPENED, THE CONTACTS FALL APART
AND THE 9-VOLT CIRCUIT IS BROKEN, ALLOWING THE RELAY TO FALL TO THE CLOSE
POSTION THUS CLOSING THE IGNITION CIRCUIT.  (IF ALL THIS IS CONFUSING TAKE A
LOOK AT THE SCHEMATIC BELOW.)

STEP 2:  TAKE THE 4 AA BATTERIES AND WIRE THEM IN SUCCESSION.  WIRE THE
POSITIVE TERMINAL OF ONE TO THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL OF ANOTHER, UNTIL ALL FOUR
ARE CONNECTED EXCEPT ONE POSITIVE TERMINAL AND ONE NEGATIVE TERMINAL.  EVEN
THOUGH THE FOUR AA BATTERIES ONLY COMBINE TO CREATE 6 VOLTS, THE INCREASE IN
AMPERAGE IS NECESSARY TO ACTIVATE THE SOLAR IGNITOR QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY.

STEP 3:  TAKE THE BATTERY PACK (MADE IN STEP 2) AND WIRE ONE END OF IT TO THE
RELAY'S SINGLE POLE AND THE OTHER END TO ONE PRONG OF THE SOLAR IGNITOR.  THEN
WIRE THE OTHER PRONG OF THE SOLAR IGNITOR BACK TO THE OPEN POSITION ON THE
RELAY.

STEP 4:  USING DOUBLE SIDED CARPET TAPE MOUNT THE KIT IN HIS LOCKER, MAILBOX,
OR CAR DOOR.  AND LAST, INSERT THE SOLAR IGNITOR INTO THE ROCKET ENGINE (SMOKE
BOMB OR M-80).

     YOUR KIT IS NOW COMPLETE!
