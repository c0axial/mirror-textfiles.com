BLOWING FUSES
-------------

IN ORDER TO BLOW A MAIN FUSE AT YOUR SCHOOL YOU MUST FIRST PICK UP A FEW THINGS
AT YOUR LOCAL HARDWARE STORE:

1) A PLUG FOR THE WALL W/OUT ANY WIRES ATTACHED

2) A SHORT LENGTH OF WIRE (A FOOT OR SO)

INTO THIS PLUG YOU MUST INSERT THE SECTION OF WIRE WHICH HAS (OF COURSE) BEEN
CUT IN HALF AND STRIPPED AT BOTH ENDS! YOU THEN TWIST THE TWO FREE ENDS TOGETHER
THEN IN YOUR NEXT CLASS WHEN THE TEACHER IS OUT OF THE ROOM YOU POP THAT SUCKER
INTO ANY WALL OUTLET AND POOF! A LITTLE SMOKE AND SUDDENLY LIGHTS GO OUT ALL
OVER OR AT THE VERY LEAST ALL OF THE PLUGS WON'T WORK UNTIL THEY REPLACE THE
FUSE! THIS IS ESPICALLY FUN TO DO WHILE YOU ARE WATCHING A FILMSTRIP OR MOVIE
NOTE: SOME OF THE NEWER SCHOOLS HAVE FUSES INSIDE OF THE PLUGS, BUT AT LEAST
THAT TEACHER WON'T BE SHOWING A MOVIE OR WHATEVER... NOTE: THIS WON'T WORK WITH
A 3-PRONG PLUG.



REAKING HAVOK
-------------

1) FIRST IF YOU HAVE LOCKER THAT YOU PUT YOUR "GYM CLOTHES" IN DURING P.E. THEN
THIS WILL WORK, BUT THE LOCKES MUST HAVE A SCREEN OR MESH

2) IF THE CLOTHES IN AN ADJOINING LOCKER PRESS UP AGINST THE SCREEN IT IS QUITE
EASY FOR YOU TO PULL A SMALL PORTION OF THE SHIRT, SWEATS, SHORTS, ETC. THROUGH
THE SCREEN.

3) YOU TAKE YOUR HANDY RAZOR BLADE WHICH YOU PICKED UP AT THE LOCAL DRUG STORE
AND YOU CUT OFF THIS PORTION OF THE CLOTHES STICKING OUT OF THE LOCKER.. THIS
CAN BE DONE MOST INCONSPICUOUSLY BECAUSE THE RAZORS ARE VERY SHARP AND YOU CAN
CUT THROUGH AND INCH OF CLOTH IN A LITTLE UNDER 10 SECONDS.

GENERAL HAVOK
------- -----

1) IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE THE FILE "HOW TO PICK MASTER LOCKS" THEN THIS IS AN
ESPECIALLY FUN THING TO DO.. PICK A LOCK OR TWO AND KEEP THE LOCKS..THEN REMOVE
WHATEVER BOOKS, CLOTHES, OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT SEEMS IMOPRTANT FROM THE LOCKER,
THESE ITEMS WILL BE BURNED OR OTHERWISE RUINED LATER. IF THE PERSON HAPPENS TO
HAVE A PAIR OF GLASSES IN THEIR LOCKER OR GYM LOCKER, A VERY FUNNY THING TO DO
IS TO PUT ONE OF THE LOCKS WHICH YOU HAVE SAVED AND LOCK IT ONTO THE BRIDGE OF
THIS PERSONS GLASSES, THIS HAPPENS TO BE EXTREMELY FUNNY IF THE KID CAN'T SEE
WITHOUT THEM AND HAS TO WEAR THEM LOCK OR NO LOCK

MOVIES AND OTHER SUCH STUFF
------ --- ----- ---- -----

HERE ARE A LIST OF A FEW THINGS WHICH YOU CAN DO IF THE TEACHER "INTENDS" TO
SHOW A MOVIE, FILMSTRIP, ETC.

1) REMOVE THE LIGHT BULB FROM THE PROJECTOR.

2) TURN THE TAPE VOLUME TO MAX.

3) TURN OVER THE TAPE AND FAST FORWARD.

4) REPLACE THE TAPE WITH A CHEAP COPY OF A HEAVY METAL GROUP. MY FAVORITES FOR
THIS SORT OF THING ARE: VENOM, EXODUS, W.A.S.P., ETC. AND DON'T FORGET TO TURN
THE VOLUME UP TO MAX.

5) VIDEO TAPES ARE ALSO VERY FUN..ONE OF THE BEST THINGS TO DO IF YOU CAN IS TO
PUT A SMALL PIECE OF TAPE OVER THE WRITE PROTECT (IF IT HAS BEEN BROKEN) AND
SIMPL PRESS RECORD AND PLAY AT THE SAME TIME..

VANDALIZATION
-------------

IF YOU CAN GET INTO THE BATHROOM BEFORE SCHOOL, AFTER SCHOOL, AND SOMETIMES
DURING CLASS YOU CAN:

1) RIP THE TOWEL HOLDERS OFF THE WALL

2) RIP THE STALL DOORS OFF (YOUR 98 LBS WEAKLING HAS TROUBLE WITH THIS)

3) BRING A SMALL SPRAY PAINT CAN WITH YOU AND STENCIL OF WHATEVER YOU WANT AND
SPRAY PAINT THESE ONTO THE WALL (MANY COLORED "PAINTINGS" CAN BE DONE WITH MANY
STENCILS. THIS CAN BECOME VERY ARTISTIC..) THIS ONE CAN ALSO BE DONE IN THE
HALLWAYS BECAUSE IT TAKES A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME TO DO..

LOCKER DOORS ARE ALSO VERY EASY TO REMOVE..

IF YOU GET ONE OF THE LOCKERS MENTIONED ABOVE OPEN AND IT HAS QUITE A BIT OF
PAPER INSIDE JUST THROW IN A MATCH (AND MAKE SURE IT CATCHES) CLOSE THE DOOR AND
WALK AWAY..

IF YOU CAN GET THE COURAGE TO PULL A FIRE ALARM DURING SCHOOL THESE ARE VERY
GOOD TIMES TO DO SO....

1) WHEN THERE IS A VERY LARGE ASSEMBLY 2) DURING LUNCH 3) BETWEEN CLASSES


MISCELLANEOUS -------------

1) DURING LUNCH OR INTRAMURALS IT IS QUITE FUN TO BRING IN A VERY LOUD WISTLE TO
BLOW...IT IS ALSO HARD TO TRACE THE SOUND

2) A VERY IRRITATING THING TO DO TO TEACHERS IS TO THROW SHARP PENCILS UP TO
STICK INTO THE CELING..ANOTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS SHOOT PAPER CLIPS UP WITH A
RUBBER BAND... YOU HAVE TO BEND THEM A CERTAIN WAY SO THAT THEY ARE SORT OF LIKE
A LOWER CASE "Y" WITH THE PRONGS AT THE TAIL OF THE "Y"

THE ULTIMATE SIN --- -------- ---

THE *VERY* WORST THING THAT YOU CAN DO IS TO HAVE A PERSON (NOT ONE WHO GOES TO
YOUR SCHOOL) CALL THE SCHOOL AND ANNOUNCE THAT THERE IS A BOMB PRESENT INSIDE
THE SCHOOL AND IT WILL GO OFF IF IT IS TAMPERED WITH..(THIS KEEPS THE JANITORS
FROM LOOKING FOR THE BOMB)

THIS IS A VERY FUN THING TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE FINALS OR SOMETHING OF THE LIKE..
OR EVEN JUST A REGULAR BORING MONDAY. MOST LIKEY THE ADMINISTRATORS WILL HAVE
EVERYONE REMOVED FROM THE BULIDING UNTIL THE BOMB SQUAD CAN SEARCH THE WHOLE
FUCKIN THING..YOU MIGHT EVEN GET A DAY OFF...

THANX TO: TARIQ, JOE, JASON, KEVIN, RANDY, OZZY, RATT, METALLICA, VENOM, EXODUS,
SLAYER, DIO.

REMEMBER: IT'S NOT A SIN TO HAVE FUN AT SCHOOL....
