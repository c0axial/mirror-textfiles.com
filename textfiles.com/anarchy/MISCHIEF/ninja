THIS WILL BE A SERIES WRITTEN EVERY SO OFTEN TO INFORM YOU FUTURE NINJAS OR
KILLERS OUT THERE.  I WILL WRITE A SERIES OF PHILES ON THE SECRETS OF THE
NINJA.  THIS IS NO BULLSHIT YOU SEE IN THE BOOKS IN YOUR LOCAL MARTIAL ARTS
STORE.  THIS IS THE REAL SHIT.  DON'T ABUSE YOUR POWERS.
 
***WARNING*** IF YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS IN ANY OF THE SERIES AND YOU DO HARM
SOMEONE BAD I WILL TAKE NO BLAME FOR IT.  PLEASE DON'T INTEND TO USE THESE
TRICKS AS A CHILDISH JOKE.  SOME OF THE THINGS I MIGHT WRITE MAY BE VERY
HARMFUL...MOST LIKELY DEADLY.
 
 
BACKGROUND ---------- I WAS BORN IN JAPAN, RAISED AND TAUGHT THE ART OF
NINJUTSU FROM MY FAMILY. I IMMIGRATED TO THE U.S. AND BECAME A U.S. CITIZEN.
I'VE BEEN STUDYING THE ART FOR OVER 15 YEARS NOW.  I AM REVEALING SOME OF THE
SECRETS TO YOU SINCE MANY PEOPLE ARE WRITING BULLSHIT TO PLEASE THE KIDS, AND
ALL THAT BULL MAKES ME MAD.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE BOOKS CAN SOMETIMES DEGRADE US,
THE PRESENT NINJAS.
 
POISON ------ THERE WERE MANY TYPES OF POISON USED IN THE OLD DAYS IN JAPAN.
MOST OF THE POISON WAS MADE AT HOME WITH PLANTS, HERBS, AND OTHER INGREDIENTS
OBTAINABLE VERY EASILY.  IN THIS SERIES I WILL DISCUSS A CERTAIN TYPE OF POISON
WHICH HAS A DELAYING DEATH EFFECT.
 
WARNING ------- THIS POISON IS DEADLY.  I KNOW SOMEONE IN MY CLAN WHO HAS USED
THIS TYPE OF POISON TO KILL A PHEW PEOPLE.  IT WORKED FOR A WHILE BUT
EVENTUALLY HE WAS CAUGHT.  HE IS IN JAIL FOR A LIFE SENTENCE FOR MURDER.
 
========  POISON ========
 
THIS POISON WILL KILL THE AFFECTED VICTIM WITHIN A WEEK.  THE REASON FOR THE
TIME DELAY IS THAT THE POISON CAUSES THE VICTIM TO GET TETANUS.  THIS PROCESS
CAN BE FATAL, SO PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL IN USING THIS POISON.
 
THE POISON IS FAIRLY SIMPLE TO MAKE.  USING IT TO KILL SOMEONE IS SOMEWHAT
COMPLICATING.
 
THIS IS AN INFECTIOUS POISON SO MAKE SURE YOU HAVEN'T ANY CUTS ON YOUR HANDS
WHEN PREPARING THE POISON.
 
INGREDIENTS:   HORSE SHIT (EXTRACTED)   HUMAN BLOOD (TYPE DEPENDS ON VICTIM)
 
YOU CAN GET HORSE SHIT FROM MOST ANYWHERE NOWADAYS SINCE THERE ARE COPS WITH
HORSES NOWADAYS.  JUST WALK AROUND WHERE YOU KNOW HORSES PASS BY, AND GET A
SMALL QUANTITY OF HORSE SHIT.  DON'T GET A LOT CAUSE THAT SHIT STINKS.
 
TAKE SOME HORSE SHIT PUT IT IN A TEST TUBE AND PUT A RUBBER STOPPER ON TOP.
ONCE YOU OBTAIN THE HORSE SHIT, YOU MUST EXTRACT THE NECESSARY PART OF THE
SHIT.
 
YOU MUST REMOVE ALL THE HAY AND OTHER GARBAGE IN THE HORSE SHIT.  YOU CAN
REMOVE THE RUBBER STOPPER AND HEAT THE SHIT OVER A LIGHT FLAME.  THE SHIT
SHOULD START TO MELT AND THE JUNK IS EXTRACTED OUT OF THE SHIT.
 
WHEN THE SHIT MELTS, DUMP IT ON SOME KIND OF FILTERING SYSTEM SO YOU CAN REMOVE
THE JUNK.  REPEAT THE PROCESS UNTIL MOST, IF POSSIBLE, ALL OF THE JUNK IS
REMOVED.  !!! CAUTION !!! THIS PROCESS STINKS UP THE WHOLE FUCKING HOUSE SO DO
IT OUT SIDE.
 
WHEN THE SHIT IS EXTRACTED, YOU MUST OBTAIN THE HUMAN BLOOD.  THE TYPE OF BLOOD
IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!
 
FOR EXAMPLE...IF YOU WANT TO KILL THE VICTIM, YOU MUST USE THE BLOOD TYPE WHICH
CORRESPONDS TO THE VICTIM: BLOOD TYPE A POS. NEEDS AN A POS. BLOOD IN THE
POISON, AND SO FORTH.
 
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE INTENDED VICTIMS BLOOD TYPE IS, THAT'S OKAY. YOU CAN
USE OTHER BLOOD TYPES AND MIX THEM LIKE TRANSFUSIONS OF BLOOD.  BUT THE EFFECT
OF THE POISON MAY BE DELAYED OR IT MAY NOT BE FATAL.  BUT IT SHOULD DO THE
TRICK.
 
GET THE EXTRACTED HORSE SHIT AND MIX THE SHIT WITH THE BLOOD.  THE PROPORTION
OF THE BLOOD WITH RESPECT TO THE SHIT IS 3 TO 1, WHICH MEANS FOR EVERY 1 OZ. OF
SHIT, THERE MUST BE 3 OZ. OF BLOOD, AND SO FORTH.
 
HEAT THE MIXTURE AT A VERY LOW HEAT, AND THE MIXTURE SHOULD START BUBBLING. TRY
NOT TO INHALE THE SMELL.  IT'S KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER IF YOU SMELL IT. DO NOT
HEAT IT WITH A HIGH FLAME, SINCE THE BACTERIA IN THE SHIT AND THE BLOOD WILL
DIE AND THE POISON WILL BECOME USELESS.
 
HEAT THE TEST TUBE AND STIR THE CONTENT WHILE HEATING TO CREATE A BETTER
MIXTURE.  WHEN THE CONTENT STARTS TO CHANGE COLORS FROM RED TO BRICK BROWN OR
REDDISH-BROWN, THEN REMOVE THE MIXTURE FROM THE FLAME.  ALLOW THE POISON TO
COOL OFF.
 
WHEN THE POISON COOLS OFF, THEN YOU'VE JUST MADE ONE OF THE DEADLIEST POISONS
AROUND.
 
THIS IS NOT A TYPE OF POISON WHICH YOU CAN JUST SPILL ON THE VICTIM, NOR IS IT
ONE THAT YOU CAN JUST PUT INTO SOMEONES FOOD.  IT HAS TO ENTER THE VICTIM'S
BLOOD STREAMS.  TO DO THAT YOU MUST USE A NEEDLE OR A KNIFE TO RUPTURE THE SKIN
IN SOME WAY IN ORDER FOR THE POISON TO WORK.
 
THE NINJA IN THE OLDEN DAYS USED WHAT WAS CALLED FUKIYA AND FUKIBARI.  THE
FUKIYA IS A BLOWGUN MADE OF BAMBOO AND THE FUKIBARI WAS THE DART BLOWN OUT OF
THE BLOWGUN.  WE DIPPED THE DARTS IN THIS POISON, THEN BLEW THE DART OUT OF THE
GUN IMMEDIATELY.  WE USUALLY STRUCK THE VICTIM AT PRESSURE POINTS WHICH MADE
THE VICTIM PASS OUT.  WHEN THE VICTIM PASSED OUT, WE REMOVED THE DART AND LEFT
THE SCENE.  THE PERSON AWAKENS WITH TETANUS, AND DIES WITHIN A PHEW DAYS, NO
LONGER THAN A WEEK.  ANOTHER MURDER WITHOUT A TRACE.
 
WHAT CAN BE DONE IN MODERN TIMES IS GET A NEEDLE DIPPED WITH THE STUFF AND JUST
POKE THE VICTIM.  MOST LIKELY THE VICTIM THINKS YOUR CRAZY AND CONTINUE TO
FIGHT YOU.  IF THE POISON ENTERED HIS BLOOD STREAM, HE WILL GET TETANUS. WHEN
AND IF HE FINDS OUT THAT HE HAS TETANUS, AND GETS A PENICILLIN SHOT OR
SOMETHING, HE WILL LIVE.  BUT IF HE FINDS OUT TOO LATE OR DOESN'T FIND OUT AT
ALL, HE WILL DIE.
 
THERE ARE MANY OTHER WAYS OF GETTING THE POISON INTO THE VICTIM'S BLOOD
STREAM.  YOU WANTING TO BECOME THE TRUE NINJA CAN TRY MANY WAYS TO KILL WITHOUT
A TRACE.  I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER USE IT AS A JOKE.  BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO GET
THE POISON INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM.
 
GOOD LUCK AND HAVE A NICE DAY.
 
DATED: 01-05-1985
 
 
PLEASE DO NOT ALTER THIS PHILE IN ANY WAY.  I WANT THIS PHILE TO BE COMPLETE
AND STAY COMPLETE AS IT IS OFFERED TO MANY PEOPLE.  YOU MAY SHARE THIS PHILE
WITH ANYONE AND EVERYONE.  BUT THE BEST WAY IS TO KEEP THE SECRETS WITHIN
YOURSELF.

THIS IS THE SECOND OF THE NINJA009 SERIES, THE FIRST BEING THE ISSUE: POISON
#1.  I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE FIRST BULLETIN AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE
AS WELL...
 
***WARNING*** AS I KNOW, IN CALIFORNIA, THERE IS A LAW THAT PROHIBITS SMOKE
SCREENS.  IF YOU GET CAUGHT SCREENING UP THE STREETS, DON'T MENTION YOUR MENTOR
TO THE COPS.  AND IF YOU WANT TO BE A NINJA, OR JUST A RAD DUDE, DON'T FUCK
AROUND IN THE WRONG PLACES, AT THE WRONG TIME...
 
 
BACKGROUND ON SMOKE SCREENS: ---------------------------- SMOKE SCREENS WERE
USED BY THE NINJA FOR A WAY OF ESCAPING IN TIGHT SITUA- TIONS.  THE NINJA HAD
TWO TYPES OF SMOKE SCREENS.  ONE THAT REQUIRES A FLINT AND STONE, AND ONE THAT
DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY HEAT.  I WILL DESCRIBE THE ONE WHICH REQUIRES A LITTLE
HEAT.  ALL I KNOW IS THAT A HOT DAY IN L.A. ON TOP OF A BLACK CAR CAN IGNITE
THIS SMOKE BOMB.  THE NINJA USED TO CALL THE SMOKE SCREENS, 'REI SEI NO KIRI',
OR SPIRITUAL FOG, OR 'NAGE DAMA' OR HURLED SMOKE. I WILL BE DISCUSSING THE 'REI
SEI NO KIRI' OR SPIRITUAL FOG.  PEOPLE HAVE THOUGHT OF THE NINJA AS MAGICAL
BEINGS, MOST AMERICANS THINK THEY ARE MYTH- ICAL, BECAUSE THEY HAVE HEARD
STORIES FROM FICTIONAL BOOKS.  THE NINJA DON'T JUST DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR OR
WALK THRU WALLS, THEY SPRAY SOME SMOKES TO HIDE SOME WHERE TEMPORARILY UNTIL
THE OPPONENT IS PUZZLED AND LEAVES.  I WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THESE TECHNIQUES IN
THIS ISSUE.
 
 
REI SEI NO KIRI --------------- THE OLD WAY OF PREPARING THE SMOKE SCREEN IS
NOT POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT DAY THEREFORE, I CANNOT REALLY TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE
IT THE OLD WAY.  THE INGRE- DIENTS OF THE OLD RECIPE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND.
BUT I DO HAVE THE ANCIENT RECIPE AND THE INGREDIENTS.  SINCE I KNOW THAT NONE
OF YOU, I REPEAT, NONE OF YOU CAN GET THE INGREDIENTS TO THE OLD RECIPE, WHICH
INCLUDES, AGED AND FINE POWDERED WOLF DUNG (WHICH MAY BE OBTAINABLE BY SHIPPING
VIA CHINA), I KNOW AS A FACT, THAT IN JAPAN, THEY DO NOT SELL THOSE THINGS,
ALSO THE BONES THE SEA EEL IN POWDERED FORM (WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED IN CHINA,
SINCE IT IS USED FOR MEDICINE DOWN THERE), AND MANY OTHER ODD INGREDIENTS WHICH
IS TOTAL- LY INOBTAINABLE.
 
----------- INGREDIENTS ----------- THIS IS THE INGREDIENTS OF THE NEW RECIPE
WHICH DOESN'T WORK AS GOOD AS THE OLD RECIPE, BUT WORKS GOOD ENOUGH TO COVER
YOURSELF IN THE SMOKE WITH ENOUGH TIME TO DISAPPEAR INTO THIN AIR.
 
- POWDERED SUGAR                 <- EASILY OBTAINED AT THE LOCAL GROCER'S -
SODIUM NITRATE (SALT PETER)    <- CAN BE OBTAINED AT THE DRUG STORE - SULFER
(OPTIONAL)             <- IF POSSIBLE, BUT NOT NECESSARY - CHARCOAL OR FINE
POWDERED CARBON (OPTIONAL)  <-CRUSHED CHARCOAL WILL DO - A FIRE CRACKER WICK OR
OTHER TYPES OF HEATING DEVICE
 
 
-------------- HOW TO MAKE IT -------------- IT IS QUITE SIMPLE TO MAKE THE
SMOKE SCREEN IF YOU DON'T INCLUDE THE OPTIONAL INGREDIENTS.  JUST MIX THE SUGAR
WITH THE SALT PETER, IN THE RATIO OF 3 PARTS SUGAR, 2 PARTS SALT PETER.  YOU
HAVE TO MIX IT GOOD SO THAT THE SALT PETER IS DISTRIBUTED WELL WITH THE SUGAR.
THEN YOU CAN STORE IT IN SOME MEDICINE BOTTLE OR A BEER CAN.  IF YOU LIGHT THE
CONTENTS IN THE MEDICINE BOTTLE IN A ROOM, IT WILL FILL A ROOM OF ABOUT 12 FEET
BY 12 FEET ENOUGH SO THAT YOU CAN ESCAPE ANY SITUATION.  IF YOU PUT IT IN A
BEER CAN, (NOTE: THE BEER CAN DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DRIED OUT FOR THIS TO WORK.)
IT CAN FILL A STREET WITH SMOKE AND LAST FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES, WHICH IS PLENTY
OF TIME TO GET YOUR ASS OUT OF ANY SITUATION.  WELL I THINK ENOUGH IS SAID
ABOUT THE EASY SMOKES. **OPTIONAL** IF THE EASY WAY CREATES ALL THAT SMOKE,
THEN WHY IS THERE AN OPTIONAL ONE, RIGHT?  WELL I INCLUDED THE OPTIONAL ONE
SINCE THE OPTIONAL ONE CAN DAMAGE THE ENTRAPPED VICTIM IN THE SMOKE PRETTY
BAD.  I MEAN BAD ENOUGH SO THAT THE VICTIM CAN PASS OUT AND DIE, IF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH OF IT GOING IN A HOUSE OR SOMETHING.  I'D ADVISE YOU TO STICK WITH THE
EASY ONE, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE OUT THERE IS CURIOUS ENOUGH TO BE A KILLER SO I
WILL INCLUDE THE OPTIONAL VERSION. YOU MUST FIRST CRUSH THE CHARCOAL.  YOU NEED
A LUMP OF CHARCOAL PER OUNCE OF SUGAR USED.  I WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE THE 3
OUNCE OF SUGAR VERSION OF THE SMOKE SCREEN.  YOU CAN ALTER THE MEASUREMENTS FOR
LARGER QUANTITIES. THE CHARCOAL IS BETTER THAN POWDERED CARBON, ESP. IF THE
CHARCOAL IS MATCH- LIGHT.  (NOTE: IF YOU HAVE PLAIN CHARCOAL, YOU SHOULD USE
LIGHTER FLUID WITH THE CHARCOAL.)  MAKE SURE THAT THE CHARCOAL IS VERY FINE.
NEXT MAKE YOUR 3:2 MIXTURE OF THE SUGAR AND THE SODIUM NITRATE.  3 OZ. OF SUGAR
TO 2 OZ. OF SODIUM NITRATE.  THEN, MIX THE 3 LUMPS OF CRUSHED CHARCOAL INTO THE
3:2 MIX- TURE, AND MIX VERY WELL.  MIX THE POWDERS UNTIL THE MIXTURE IS A DARK
GREY NEAR GREY, MIXTURE.  THEN GET AN OUNCE OF SULFER AND MIX THE CONTENTS
CARE- FULLY.  DON'T SPILL THE SULFER OR THE MIXTURE ON THE FLOOR OR CARPETING
SINCE IT CAN DAMAGE IT.  WHEN YOU MIX IT WELL ENOUGH, YOU HAVE FINISHED!!!  IF
YOU DO LIGHT THIS SCREEN, BEWARE...YOU ARE RISKING YOUR OWN LIFE.  GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF THERE BUT TRY NOT TO BE SEEN.  TIME THE WICK IF POSSIBLE.  IF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH OF IT GOING IN A ROOM WITH YOUR FAVORITE ENEMY IN IT, IT CAN KILL THE
DUDE WITH 5 MINUTES OF THIS SHIT.  THE THING IS IT'S PRETTY EASY TO GET HIS ASS
OUT OF THERE, TOO.  SO JUST KNOCK HIM OUT COLD BEFORE YOU IGNITE THE SMOKES.
IF HE DOES AWAKE, AFTER THE SMOKE DISSIPATES, HE WILL MOST LIKELY DIE OF SOME
LUNG PROBLEMS.  ANYWAYS, IF YOU WANT HIM TO DIE QUICK WHO GIVES A DAMN.  BUT,
MAKE SURE IF YOU DO THIS DON'T GET YOUR ASS BUSTED.
 
-------------- WAYS OF ESCAPE -------------- I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL ON THIS
ISSUE BUT HERE IS ONE WAY OF EVASION.  FIRST MOST LIKELY WHEN A PERSON GETS IN
SOME HEAT NOWADAYS, IT'S GONNA BE ON THE STREETS.  SO...LOOK FOR A PLACE WHERE
YOU KNOW YOU CAN HIDE OUT FOR A WHILE. LIGHT ONE NEARBY AND WHEN THE SMOKE GOES
UP, LOOK DIRECTLY AT YOUR OPPONENT UNTIL HE IS VERY DIM AND FAINT, THEN MAKE
YOUR MOVE.  GO TO YOUR HIDING PLACE. AND STAY THERE FOR A WHILE.  WHEN YOU
THINK THE COAST IS CLEAR, JAM WHEREVER YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR ASS SAFE.
 
 
WELL...I HAVE SAID ENOUGH ABOUT THIS TOPIC.  WELL...HAVE FUN!!!
 
DATED: 01-16-1985
 
PLEASE DO NOT ALTER THIS PHILE IN ANY WAY.  I WANT THIS PHILE TO BE COMPLETE
AND STAY COMPLETE AS IT IS OFFERED TO MANY CURIOUS MINDS.  YOU MAY SHARE THIS
PHILE WITH ANYONE AND EVERYONE.  BUT THE BEST WAY IS TO KEEP THE SECRETS TO
YOUR SELF.

THIS IS THE THIRD OF THE NINJA009 SERIES.  I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE FIRST TWO
BULLETINS AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE AS WELL...
 
***WARNING*** IN CALIFORNIA, THERE IS A LAW THAT PROHIBITS SHURIKENS.  IF YOU
GET CAUGHT CONCEALING ONE IN YOUR POCKET OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON YOUR BODY IN THE
STREETS, YOU WILL BE CAUGHT AND THE OBJECT WILL BE CONFISCATED.  IF YOU ARE
OVER 18 YEARS OF AGE, YOU CAN BE FINED AND SENTENCED A FEW MONTHS IN JAIL.  SO
DON'T BE STUPID ABOUT THINGS.  DON'T SHOW OFF WHAT YOU'VE GOT.
 
 
BACKGROUND ON SHURIKENS: ------------------------ THE SHURIKEN OR THE THROWING
STAR HAS MAINLY ONE PURPOSE TO THE NINJA.  A DISTRACTION FOR ESCAPE, MUCH LIKE
THE SMOKE SCREEN.  THE NINJAS IN THE OLD DAYS, USED THE STAR TO CREATE A
DELUSION.  THE NINJA WOULD THROW THE STAR IN A DIRECTION WHICH MADE A SOUND IN
A TOTALLY WRONG DIRECTION SO HIS OPPO- NENT WILL BE SEARCHING YOU IN THE WRONG
PLACES, THEREFORE YOU CAN ESCAPE. IN MODERN MOVIES, I HAVE SEEN THEM USE IT TO
KILL AN OPPONENT.  AS I HAVE LEARNED FROM MY GRAND MASTER, THE SHURIKEN IS NOT
ACCURATE ENOUGH TO KILL MOST LIKELY, YOU CAN ONLY DAMAGE THE PERSON HIT BY THE
SHURIKEN.  THEREFORE IT IS ONLY USED AS A DISTRACTION DEVICE.  BUT, KNOW AS A
FACT THAT SOME NINJAS, ONLY A VERY FEW, WERE EXPERTS ON SHURIKEN THROWING AND
WERE ABLE TO KILL WITH IT.  THERE WERE EXACTLY TWO PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY OF
JAPAN WHO CAN PROPERLY THROW A SHURIKEN.  THEY WERE AROUND IN THE 1500-1700
A.D.  I KNOW THAT THERE IS NO ONE IN THIS WORLD, NOW, WHO CAN THROW A SHURIKEN
AND ACTUAL- LY KILL ANOTHER TRAINED NINJA.  MOST MODERN NINJA HAS THE KEEN
HEARING ABIL- ITIES AS THE OLD NINJA, SO THEY CAN HEAR THE SHURIKEN CUT THE
WIND.  SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT CAME FROM, AND AROUND HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS
THROWN.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TEACH METHODS OF HEARING BUT I WILL TRY MY BEST IN
MY LATER SERIES.  WELL...ANYWAYS...
 
 
SHURIKEN -------- THE OLD WAY OF BUILDING THIS WEAPON IS A VERY COMPLICATED
TASK.  FIRST YOU MUST BUILD A LIMESTONE FURNACE, WHICH TAKES ABOUT TWO MONTHS.
THEN, YOU CAN START BUILDING YOUR WEAPONS.  YOU MUST ALSO KNOW HOW TO FORGE THE
WEAPON. THEREFORE, I CANNOT REALLY TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE IT THE OLD WAY.  BUT
LATER ON IN THE SERIES I SHALL TEACH YOU HOW TO BUILD A FURNACE AND HOW TO
BUILD WEAPONS THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.  BUT THIS TEXT WILL TEACH YOU A SIMPLE BUT
EFFECTIVE METHOD OF BUILDING AND SHARPENING ONE.
 
----------------------- MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT -----------------------
 
- A SHEET METAL OF AT LEAST 3/16" THICKNESS. - A HACKSAW OR SOME OTHER CUTTING
DEVICE. - A SHARPENING STONE, HARD ( NOT SOFT ARKANSAS ). - A STEEL MALLET ( A
HAMMER SHOULD DO ). - A VISE - AN ANVIL OR SOME OTHER FLAT METAL SURFACE.
 
-------------- HOW TO MAKE IT -------------- IT IS QUITE SIMPLE THE MODERN WAY,
IT ONLY TAKES A FEW HOURS AT MOST.  FIRST, YOU MUST DRAW THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF
SHURIKEN YOU WANT ON A PIEC OF PAPER. AFTER YOU HAVE CHOSEN YOUR DESIRED SHAPE,
DRAW IT ONTO THE METAL WITH AN AWL OR SCREWDRIVER.  THEN, CLAMP THE SHEET METAL
ONTO THE VISE.  CAREFULLY CUT OUT THE SHUIKEN.  SOMETIMES IF YOU USE THICK
SHEET METAL WITH A HACKSAW, THE SAW BLADE TENDS TO GET WARM AND SOMETIMES START
TO WARP, SO APPLY SOME KIND OF LUBRICANT OIL AND IT SHOULD REDUCE THE FRICTION
THAT CAUSE THE HEAT.  AFTER YOU CUT OUT THE SHURIKEN, THEN YOU MUST START
MAKING THE EDGES SHARP.  START HAMMERING DOWN THE POINTS OF THE SHURIKEN.
AFTER A FEW POUNDINGS, THE POINTS SHOULD BE A BIT FLATTER THAN THE CENTER OF
THE SHURIKEN.  THEN START WORKING ON THE SIDES OF THE POINTS.  BUT REMEMBER NOT
TO GO TO DEEP INTO THE CENTER OF THE SHURIKEN SINCE THE CENTER SHOULD BE THE
SAME THICKNESS AS YOU STARTED WITH. AFTER YOU START SEEING THE EDGES BECOMING
GROUNDED, THEN STOP THE POUNDING. GET THE SHARPENING STONE.  AT FIRST JUST
GRIND THE SHURIKEN IN A CIRCULAR MOTION NEAR THE TIPS OF THE POINTS.  AS YOU
BEGIN FEELING THE POINTS SHARPEN, WORK ON THE SIDES.  KEEP WORKING ON GRINDING
THE STEEL, UNTIL AN EDGE BEGINS TO FORM.  MAKE SURE YOU SHARPEN BOTH SIDES
EVENLY.  WHEN THE EDGE BEGINS TO FORM, THEN YOU MUST SHARPEN THE SHURIKEN WITH
CAREFUL STROKES.  YOU MUST NOT FORCE THE SHURIKEN TO SHARPEN.  YOU MUST STROKE
THE SHURIKEN BACKWARDS.  NEVER PUSH IT FORWARDS TO SHARPEN IT OR YOU'LL LOSE
IT'S EDGE AS YOU TRY TO DEVELOP IT.  STROKE IT BACK FOR A WHILE, UNTIL THE
POINTS BEGIN TO GLARE.  AFTER AN HOUR OF STROKING, THE BLADE SHOULD BE
COMPLETE.  WHEN YOU FIRST TRY TO BUILD THIS THING, YOU MIGHT NOT GET A WELL
BALANCED SHURIKEN.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN I BUILT ONE THIS WAY, IT TOOK ME
TEN TRIAL SHURIKENS BEFORE I GOT A DESCENTLY BALANCED ONE.  ALL IT TAKES IS
PRACTICE.  YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW THAT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT.
 
------------------- THROWING TECHNIQUES ------------------- I CAN WRITE A WHOLE
BOOK IN TEACHING HOW TO THROW THIS THING.  I WILL TEACH THE BASIC METHOD OF
THROWING THIS TOOL.  GRIP ONE OF THE POINTS WITH YOUR THUMB & YOUR FORE AND
MIDDLE FINGERS. TO AIM IT TO THE DESIRED OBJECT, LOOK AT THE REST OF THE
SHURIKEN THAT IS NOT COVERED BY YOUR GRIP.  THE HALF POINT FROM THE TOP TO THE
BOTTOM OF YOUR VISUAL POINT, IS WHERE THE TARGET SHOULD BE FOCUSED AT.  WHEN
YOU RELEASE IT, SNAP THE SHURIKEN WITH YOUR MIDDLE FINGER.  IF THE SHURIKEN
FLYS VERTICAL WITHOUT ROTATING HORIZONTALLY, THEN YOUR SHURIKEN IS FAIRLY
BALANCED.  PRACTICE THROWING THE SHURIKEN EVERYDAY, YOU CAN FIGURE OUT OTHER
COMFORTABLE METHODS OF THROWING AND HITTING THE TARGET.  HAVE FUN...

THIS IS THE FOURTH OF THE NINJA009 SERIES.  I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE FIRST
THREE BULLETINS AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE AS WELL...
 
 
BACKGROUND ON CLIMBING TECHNIQUES: ---------------------------------- MAY
RUMORS HAVE BEEN SAID THAT NINJA'S CAN FLY OR THEY CAN CLIMB FLAT, VERTICAL
WALLS, WITH NO SWEAT...BULLSHIT...I, PERSONALLY HAVE A HELL OF A WORK OUT WHEN
I CLIMB WALLS, SOME TIMES I STAY STUCK TO A WALL FOR OVER AN HOUR JUST TO GET
SOME REST.  THE ANCIENT NINJA'S USED A VERY WELL CON- STRUCTED TOOL CALLED THE
TEKAGI (HAND CLAWS), AND THE ASHIKO (LITERALLY TRANSLATED, FOOT CLAWS, LIKE ON
CATS.).  THE ONES YOU SEE IN THOSE MAIL ORDER SHITS, ARE VERY FRAGILE AND
WEAK...I HAVE TESTED OVER TWENTY DIFFERENT ONES, THEY ALL BROKE AFTER THE
SECOND OR THE THIRD CLIMB.  BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, THEY ARE HELLA GOOD
FOR FIGHTING...AS A MATTER OF FACT, I KNOW THIS GUY, ONE OF MY BROTHERS OF THE
CLAN, KILLED AN ASSAULTANT WITH IT. THE ASSULTANT HAD A GUN AND HE JUST SLASHED
HIS HAND APART, HE BLED TO DEATH. ANYWAYS...ENUFF OF THIS BORING STUFF.
 
I WON'T TELL YOU HOW TO MAKE A WELL, CONSTRUCTED TEKAGI OR ASHIKO, SINCE I
MYSELF STILL CANNOT MAKE IT PERFECTLY...WHICH KINDA MEANS SOMETHING. THE RULES
OF WEAPONS IN THE NINJUTSU SYSTEM IS THAT, IF YOU CANNOT BUILD IT YOU CANNOT
USE IT.  AS MY MASTER SAYS.
 
CLIMBING A WALL THAT IS FLAT AND VERTICAL
----------------------------------------- HA! HA!  YOU SAY...IMPOSSIBLE TO THE
CORE...YOU SAY... WELL...IF YOU ARE WELL TRAINED, YOU CAN CLIMB A FLAT WALL AS
HIGH AS 20 FEET.  ONE OF MY BROTHERS OF THE CLAN CAN DO IT.  I CAN ONLY GET UP
ABOUT 15 FEET. ALL IT TAKES IS PRACTICE, WHICH I REALLY DON'T DO ANYMORE.
 
TO BE PHYSICALLY FIT FOR THIS, YOU SHOUD DO THE FOLLOWING EXERCISES. ***
WARNING *** DON'T TRY ANYTHING THAT MAY HARM YOUR HEALTH OR YOUR LIFE. DON'T
OVER-EXERCISE YOURSELF...I'LL GUARANTEE YOU'LL GET BOARD OF IT. ***************
 
  JUMP AS HIGH AS YOU CAN REPEATEDLY ( START AT 10 TIMES A DAY
)                                      ( WORK UP TO 50 TIMES....  )
 
  STRETCH YOUR LEGS AFTERWARDS    - DO FRONT SPLITS ON YOUR RIGHT   ( YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GO ALL   )    - DO FRONT SPLITS ON YOUR LEFT    ( THE WAY DOWN ON THE
SPLITS )    - DO SIDE SPLITS                  ( IT'LL GO DOWN EVENTUALLY.. )
 
OKAY AFTER YOUR EXERCISE, DRILL THE FOLLOWING 10 TIMES...NO MORE THAN 10...
YOU'LL FIND OUT WHY...
 
- LOOK FOR A WALL ABOUT 5 FEET ABOVE YOUR OWN HEIGHT.  MAKE SURE IT IS A
STURDY WALL... - RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN TO THE WALL AND START CLIMBING.  AS YOU
CLIMB,   PUT YOUR BODY AS CLOSE TO THE WALL AS POSSIBLE. - AT YOUR FIRST
ATTEMPT AT THIS, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO STEP TWO TIMES ON   THE WALL AND SLIP
AND DROP TO THE GROUND. - JUST TUCK YOUR BODY AS SOON AS YOU MAKE YOUR FIRST
STEP ON THE WALL.   THEN YOUR OTHER STEPS WILL BECOME NATURAL. - YOU WILL KNOW
WHEN YOU ARE LOSING THE GRIP ON THE WALL, THAT IS WHEN   YOU REACH FOR THE TOP.
- AS YOU REACH FOR THE TOP, PUSH UP OFF THE WALL. - YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GRAB
THE TOP. - IF YOU GET TO THIS POINT OF HANGING AT THE EDGE OF THE TOP OF THE
WALL,   THEN CONSIDER YOURSELF ALREADY UP. - NOW ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS USE THE
ELBOW LOCK SYSTEM TO CLIMB UP TO THE   TOP, OR YOU CAN KIP UP. - ( KIPPING UP )
- AS YOU HANG, PULL YOUR LEGS UP AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE.   REMEMBER TO KEEP YOUR
LEGS AS STRAIGHT AS POSSIBLE.  WHEN YOU GET YOUR   BODY TO BEND ABOUT A 90
DEGREE BEND OR LESS, THEN PUSH OFF THE WALL WITH   YOUR LEGS AND AS SOON AS
YOUR FEET COME OFF OF THE WALL, PULL UP WITH YOUR   ARMS.
 
ALL THIS SOUNDS SO DAMN EASY TO ANYONE...BUT IT ISN'T...I AM SORRY THAT THIS IS
NOT A TECHNIQUE THAT EVERYONE CAN LEARN IN A MATTER OF MONTHS.  IT TOOK ME 5
YEARS TO GET 15 FEET.  5 FUCKING YEARS!!!
 
SO DON'T GET DISCOURAGED...IF YOU GET TWICE YOUR HEIGHT, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD.
WORK HARD ON IT...IF YOU CAN WORK ON SOME WEIGHTS ON THE BI-CEPS AND TRI-CEPS.
DON'T OVER BUILD YOUR BODY THOUGH.  ALSO TRY TO DEVELOP ELBOW AND WRIST POWER.
 
PUSH YOURSELF IF GOT THE GUTTS...YOU MAY END UP DOING THINGS YOU ONLY DREAMT
ABOUT.

THIS IS THE FIFTH OF THE NINJA009 SERIES.  I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE FIRST FOUR
BULLETINS AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE AS WELL...
 
***WARNING*** THERE IS A HEAVILY ENFORCED LAW ON BREAKING AND ENTRY.  IF YOU
GET CAUGHT FOR B&E, AND YOU ARE OVER 18, YOU WILL DEFINITELY GO TO * JAIL *...
IF YOU ARE UNDER AGED...STILL DON'T DO IT, SOME TIMES THE STUFF YOU DO STAYS ON
YOUR FUTURE RECORDS.
 
BACKGROUND: ----------- NINJA'S WERE ABLE TO WALK THRU WALLS, ENTER AND LEAVE A
ROOM WITHOUT A TRACE. THIS WAS ONE OF THE STEALTH SKILLS, THAT THE NINJA'S
POSSESSED.  THERE WERE RUMORS THAT NINJAS CAN VANISH INTO A
WALL...WELL...THAT'S A LITTLE HOAX. YES WE ARE ABLE TO ENTER AND EXIT A ROOM
WITHOUT A LARGE TRACE...IF YOU KNOW HOW JAPANESE HOUSES IN THE ANCIENT TIMES
WERE BUILT, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SUPPORT POSTS, THEY USUALLY HAVE GRAPPLING HOOK
MARKS IF A NINJA HAD WALKED THRU THE ROOM TO KILL A PERSON OR SOMETHING.  BUT
ONE HAS TO LOOK VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.
 
-------------- HOW TO DO ITS: -------------- WELL...I WON'T GET INTO ANY
PHILOSOPHICAL BULLSHIT OR THE ANCIENT STUFF. I'LL GIVE YOU INFO ON THE STUFF
YOU CAN PUT TO MODERN USE.
 
HOW TO PICK FILE CABINET LOCKS: ------------------------------- IT'S QUITE
SIMPLE TO PICK OPEN A FILE CABINET.  MOST FILE CABINETS NOWADAYS HAVE A CHEAP
DISK TUMBLING SYSTEM.  IF THE DISK PATTERNS MATCH THE KEY SHAPE, PRESTO!  IT'S
OPEN.
 
LET ME BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT DISK TUMBLERS ARE...
 
 
          I  I  I  I  I             ****           I     I  I        ** *
****** *    <-----  KEY                            ************ *           I
I  I  I  I             ****
 
          ^  ^  ^  ^  ^           |--|--|--|--|           EACH ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT THE (^) ARROWS ARE POINTING TO ARE           DISKS.  ( SORRY FOR
THE BAD ILLUSTRATIONS. )
 
          IF THE KEY INSERTED THRU THE 5 DISKS, AND THE PATTERN OF THE
DISKS           MATCH, IT OPENS.
 
SO TO MAKE A KEY THAT WORKS WITH MOST (ALL) CABINET LOCKS...
 
GET A WIRE FAIRLY THICK, JUST THIS ENOUGH TO FIT THRU THE LOCKS. BEND IT IN THE
FOLLOWING FASHION.
 
                                +---- THE DISTANCE    SHOULD EQUAL
----------/\/\/\-           v     FROM TOP OF     THE DISTANCE
/\                                /      THE HUMP TO     ACROSS
TWO                               ^       THE BOTTOM OF   TOPS OR       ^
^                               +------ THE HUMP        BOTTOMS  -----|--|
 
WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR KEY, JUST INSERT IT ALL THE WAY IN.  JERK IT UP AND DOWN AS
FAST AS YOU CAN, AS YOU TURN THE KEY TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT, DEPENDING ON HOW THE
LOCK OPENS.  IF YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN ANY FILE
CABINET LOCK IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  I USUALLY TAKE ABOUT 3 TO 5 SECONDS WITH
MY KEY.
 
 
OPENING LOCKED DOORS: --------------------- I CAN WRITE A WHOLE BOOK IN
TEACHING HOW TO OPEN LOCKED DOORS.  I'LL TELL YOU THE MOST BASIC WAY OF DOING
IT.  THIS TECHNIQUE HAS TO BE A DOOR WITH A GAP AS WIDE AS A WIDTH OF A BUTTER
KNIFE.
 
IF YOU HAVE A BUTTER KNIFE OR A BUTTER FLY KNIFE OR EQUIVALENT, HANDY, YOU CAN
OPEN THESE KINDA DOORS AS THOUGH YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THEM.
 
           DOOR GAP              | |              | |
|-|              | |<---- THE SO CALLED "BOLT" OF THE DOOR.              |
|              |-|              | |              | |              | |
 
      BIRD'S EYE AND ENLARGED VIEW OF THIS
 
 
 
              |----------  THE KNIFE               v               I
----> SLIDE THE KNIFE THIS WAY FOR THIS PICTURE          ____ I
______              |I _|              |I/ |         DOOR              |/
|              |___|          ____|   |_______                ^
|--------------- THE "BOLT"
 
 
IF THE ROUND PART OF THE "BOLT" FACES YOU THEN WITH THE KNIFE, PUSH ON THE BOLT
WITH THE BACK OF THE BLADE.  AS YOU PUSH, SLIDE THE KNIFE TOWARDS THE SIDE OF
THE DOOR. (SEE ILLUSTATION FOR CLARITY).  YOU WILL SLOWLY MOVE IT. AND PRESTO!
THE DOOR IS OPEN.  THE TRICK IS TO SLIDE THE KNIFE AND PUSHING IT AT THE SAME
TIME, AND HOLD ON TO THE DOOR KNOB. IF IT OPENS INWARDS, GET READY TO PUSH IT
AS SOON AS THE KNIFE IS THRU THE "BOLT".
 
FOR THE OTHER CASE ( THE ROUND PART OF THE "BOLT" FACING AWAY FROM YOU ), YOU
JUST PULL ON THE KNIFE AND GIVE THE SAME SLIDING MOTION.  BE CAREFUL NOT TO
STAB YOURSELF.  THE KNIFE'S CONTACT POINT IS ALWAYS THE BACK OF THE KNIFE.
 
 
 
SINCE I HAVE A LIMIT TO THE LENGTH OF MY FILES, I WILL PUT PART 2 OF THIS ON
THE NEXT ISSUE OF THE NINJA 009 SERIES.

THIS IS THE SIXTH OF THE NINJA009 SERIES.  THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE FIFTH
OF THE SERIES.  THIS WILL BE THE LAST PART OF THE LOCK PICKING TECKNIQUES.
 
***WARNING*** THERE IS A HEAVILY ENFORCED LAW ON BREAKING AND ENTRY.  IF YOU
GET CAUGHT FOR B&E, AND YOU ARE OVER 18, YOU WILL DEFINITELY GO TO * JAIL *...
IF YOU ARE UNDER AGED...STILL DON'T DO IT, SOME TIMES THE STUFF YOU DO STAYS ON
YOUR FUTURE RECORDS.
 
 
-------------- HOW TO DO ITS: --------------
 
HOW TO PICK 5 PIN CIRCULAR TUMBLER LOCKS:
----------------------------------------- THIS IS VERY HARD...IT TAKES A LOT OF
PRACTICE TO CRACK OPEN THESE KINDS OF LOCKS.  MOST BIKE LOCKS AND ARCADE COIN
SLOT LOCKS HAVE THIS TYPE OF LOCK.
 
LET ME BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT 5 PIN CIRCULAR TUMBLERS ARE...
 
         BIRD'S EYE VIEW              _________
___                 --=_________               / o \           |->
===)              /o   o\          |->  ==)              \_o_o_/          |->
===)________                               |
--=_________                               |
+---  THE PINS (NOT ALL FIVE CAN BE SHOWN)
 
         THE KEY IS A SMALL CIRCULAR TUBE LIKE KEY WITH A LITTLE NOTCH
AT THE END OF THE KEY, WITH FIVE SMALL DITCHES IN THE TUBE.          WHEN ALL
THE PINS ARE ARRANGED SO THAT THE LOCK TURNS, PRESTO!!!          SOME HAVE
SEVEN PINS....
 
 
SO TO MAKE A KEY THAT WORKS WITH 5 PIN BIKE LOCKS AND ET. AL.
 
MAKING THE KEY IS VERY HARD...YOU HAVE TO MAKE A KEY, EVERYTIME YOU USE IT,
ONCE!  THIS IS A BITCH.  THE PARTS AREN'T THE EASIEST TO FIND EITHER.
 
FIND 5 SPRING STEEL NEEDLES THICK ENOUGH FOR STRENGTH, BUT THIN ENOUGH TO FIT
INTO THE SIDES OF THE LOCKS.  GET A TUBE THAT FITS THE LOCK PERFECTLY. YOU CAN
KEEP THE TUBE FOREVER.  TAPE THE SPRING STEEL NEEDLES ONTO THE PIPE. LET THE
SPRINGS STICK OUT ABOUT 5 mm OUT OF THE PIPE.  BUT MAKE SURE NONE OF THE
SPRINGS ARE LAYED OUT EVENLY.  NOW, INSERT IT INTO THE LOCK.  GIVE IT A RAPID
IN AND OUT MOTION.  GET A SURGICAL SPRING NEEDLE FROM YOUR BIOLOGY LABORATORY
AND USE THAT TO ROTATE THE LOCK AS YOU JIGGLE IT IN AND OUT.  I HAD A HELL OF A
HARD TIME PICKING OPEN A KRYPTONITE LOCK.  I LOST MY KEYS TO MY BIKE AND IT WAS
LOCKED TO A POLE.  IT TOOK ME ABOUT 20 MINUTES.  I HAD SUCCESSFULLY OPENED ONLY
5 OF THESE TYPES OF LOCKS, ONE OF THEM BEING A SEVEN PIN.  IT IS VERY
FRUSTRATING AND HARD.  BUT WORK ON IT.
 
 
OPENING CAR DOOR TYPE 1: ------------------------ I CAN WRITE A WHOLE BOOK IN
TEACHING HOW TO OPEN CAR DOORS.  I'LL TELL YOU THE TWO BASIC WAYS OF DOING IT.
THE FIRST TECHNIQUE IS THE FOLLOWING:
 
A CAR WITH A LIPPED DOOR LOCK:
 
           ___           (   )     <----- DOOR LOCK            | |    ________|
|___________            <_>
 
 
THESE DOORS ARE SO EASY TO PICK, IT TAKES A PRO ONLY ABOUT A SECOND TO OPEN
IT.  JUST GET A HANGER AND TAKE IT APART TO BE A SO CALLED STRAIGHT WIRE. BEND
IT LIKE THE FOLLOWING.
 
 
 
 
     _________________________                         ______>
 
                        (  L  )  L = LENGTH (ABOUT 1-1/2 INCHES)
 
     THE LOOP PART OF THE HOOK SHOULD BE JUST BIG ENOUGH TO GRAB THE LOCK.
 
JUST STICK IT IN THRU THE SIDE OF THE WINDOW.  AS YOU INSERT IT, BEND IT
TOWARDS THE LOCK.  IF THE GAP OF BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE WINDOW IS TOO SMALL,
THEN USE THE SECOND TECHNIQUE.  AS YOU APPROACH THE LOCK AND GET A HOLD OF IT,
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SNUG GRIP ON THE LOCK BY TUGGING ON IT ONCE AND PULL IT IN
AN UPWARD MOTION, FAST.  PRESTO!!!  IT'S OPEN.  THIS IS VERY EASY. JUST
PRACTICE ON YOUR OWN CAR OR SOMETHING, IF YOU GET A CHANCE, PRACTICE IN A SAFE
LOOKING PARKING LOTS, (METRO, OR PRIVATE LOTS.) AND YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT.
 
OPENING CAR DOOR TYPE 2: ------------------------ THIS ISN'T THAT HARD EITHER
ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT.
 
YOU HAVE TO GET:
 
A METAL RULER ABOUT AN INCH IN WIDTH AND AT LEAST 2 FOOT IN LENGTH.
 
CUT THE METAL NOTCH IN THE FOLLOWING FASHION.
 
       |       |        |       |        |_      |          \     |
\    |            \   |            /   |         __/   /        |     /
|     \_        |       |        |       |        |_______|
 
DO IT ACCORDING TO THE HARDCOPY'S SCALE FOR THE CUTS OF NOTCHES. IT IS AS CLOSE
TO MINES AS POSSIBLE.  THEN INSERT THE STICK INTO THE SIDE OF THE DOOR.  FEEL
FOR A PIN INSIDE THE CAR DOOR.  ONCE YOU FIND THE PIN, PUSH SLIGHTLY DOWN ON IT
AND THE PULL UP FAST.  BINGO!  IT'S OPEN. THIS NEEDS MORE PRACTICE THAN THE
OTHER METHOD BUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD. PRACTICE MAKES PERFECTION...SO PRACTICE
HARD.
 
I'LL WRITE SOME MORE LOCK PICKING SCHEMES IN THE FUTURE.  WELL...HAVE FUN.
