	PROWLING:

  Prowling.  I like the sound of that.	Reminds me of a cat,, slinking through
the night.  Isn't that the idea of it?  Basically, all you need to do is wear
dark clothing, sneakers, know how to keep quiet, and remember the 2 basic rules
of all sneaks:	1) Don't be dumb, 2) Don't get caught.  Prowling is the basic
skill for things as ghetting, trashing, and roofing.



	ROOFING:

  Roofing isn't particularly useful, just fun.  There's nothing to it, really,
just climbing and observation skills are needed.  Remember to keep quiet if you
do it in the daytime, The Moon Roach and I got caught 'cause we were jumping on
skylights, bouncing tennis balls, and mooning the parking lot - dumb.  You
usually get onto a roof from the outside, but if you're lucky, you can get up
from a trapdoor or something from inside.  Moon Roach, The Daredevil, and I were
hanging around the Cow Palace after a Yes concert, and we went back in about an
hour after the show was over, right past security guards and janitors.	We went
-everywhere- in there, including the roof.  Other roofs attained by Anarchy inc.
members:  Vallco Mall, Sunnyvale Town Center, several various houses, Monta
Vista High, Payless, a few minor shopping centers, and Jollyman School (big
deal).

	TUNNELING:

  This is just going through the tunnels where a waterway (one of those ditches
you see from time to time) goes under a road or plot of land where a 6-foot wide
ditch would be unappropriate decor, like a school.  This, again, serves no
useful purpose other than fun, but they also make good testing grounds for any
explosives you may have made (naughty you!  heh, heh...*BOOM*).  Bring a
flashlight and 2 plastic garbage bags with matching rubber bands for each person
against a puddle of epic proportions.  Spray paint is optional.


	AVOIDING SECURITY:

  This is useful for things like concerts if you want to meet the band or
something.  Make your way sneakily to somewhere close to the guard and have a
friend be somewhere in the sight of the guard, but sort of far away.  He should
do something distracting now, like doing a rain dance in the nude, or sitting
down with a bag of ants and a hammer and smashing them one at a time.  When the
guard goes over to inspect your friend more closely, slip by.


	GHETTING:

  This is your basic breaking and entering and burglary.  I call it "to ghet"
(pronounced 'get') because I don't like the soundn of "breaking & entering and
burglary".  The eaisiest way to get (not ghet, not yet) into a house is through
one of those "burglar-proof" windows.  Stick a key or small piece of metal in
between the bottom of the screen and the window pane and pry it out.  Now put
the both of your hands on the window and press hard while sliding the window
open.  Gloves should be worn unless you don't care if they have an excellent set
of all your fingerprints.

   The second way to get in is through a door which doesn't have a deadbolt.
Just take a coat hanger and bend it into this shape:	========
Slip it behind the little metal block which sticks	!
into the doorjam and pull towards you, but not too far	\=======
or the thing will just snap back and you'll have to try again.

  If the people were stupid and put a door on with hinges on the outside, just
remove the hinges.  This can be done either by unscrewing them or by pulling the
pins out with the pair of pliers.
