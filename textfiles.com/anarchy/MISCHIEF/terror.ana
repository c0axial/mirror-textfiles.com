  Welcome, to the Lord Omega School of Beginning Terrorism.  You will find that,
in a very short time, terrorism is a fun an profitable career that almost
anybody can do.  First, we'll assume that you have no money.  (After the cost of
this class, you sure won't!) So, we'll start off cheap...

      Chapter one: Dress to Kill
      -----------

  Clothing is a very important thing in a good terror- ist.  You will notice
that all of the recognized pros (ie, Fidel Castro, Yasir Arafat, Alexander Haig)
all have their own special styles.  But the main one we will be talking about is
the standard olive drab uniform since it is the most used.  As I said, I'll
prepare you with almost no money.  What you will be supplied with is a pair of
olive drab pants, jacket, and canteen.	Another important article of clothing is
the headband.  Face it, when have you seen a convincing terrorist without one?
(On that note, when have you seen a terrorist...couldn't resist...dD) Some
schools recommend a khaki one, but I prefer a nice shade of olive again.  You
must tie it around you hair and let at least 4-6 inches of cloth dangle after
you have tied it.  Any less and you will be recognized as a beginner and will
probally be immediately shot.  If you put a lot more cloth on it, then other
terrorists will think you are pretentious and stuck up.  Once again, you will
probally be shot.  For shoes, pretty much any brand will do in combat boots, but
don't get an expensive "Macy's" pair since people will just laugh at you.  Oh,
remember:  Make sure that all of the clothes are permanently soiled, and a
little bit baggy.

      Chapter two: Weapons
      -----------

  Let's face it, a good terrorist needs something to kill with, eh?  You will be
supplied with Army issue .45 caliber handguns at graduation, and a full
bandoleer.  This, however is only a temporary substitute.  You will need to get
a better weapon, preferably something fully automatic and big, for that matter.
Fitting nicely in this catagory is the M-60.  The gun can tear apart a building
in seconds, and does wonders to enemies.  (Think of what it could do to Matt
Ackeret!  ...dD) The only problem with it, is that it weighs about 53 pounds,
empty.	and about 63 lbs with a full banana clip.  So, if you are a wimp, stick
with a smaller gun.  The best way to get an M-60 is to see someone who is
carrying one and ask if you can borrow it.  If he does not agree, kill him.  If
he agrees, kill him anyway, because only a stupid terrorist would give someone
else his gun, and besides, he probally deserves to die anyway.

      Chapter three:Transportation
      -------------

  This is a short chapter.  All graduates will be supplied with a plane ticket
to either the Mid-East, or any of the Central American countries.  When you get
there, go and steal a jeep.  I recommend jeeps for transports since they are
fast, and somewhat quiet.  You can also mount your M-60 on a gun turret, and cut
up pedestrans if you wish.  Tanks are too difficult to steal, and they have a
tendency to kill you when you stand in the road to get them to stop.  Jeeps are
also very fuel-econimical.  They will do about 20 mpg city, 15 in the jungle.

      Chapter four: Which side?
      ------------

  Well, it doesn't really matter which side you are on, as long as you get paid.
That's what you came here for, didn't you?  Terrorists tend to be paid best by
the United States.  But, it's been stated that Cherinkov is making the trade now
very competitive.  Who knows, in the future, he might be out-bidding the U.S...

      Chapter five:Conclusion
      ------------

  Well, this may help you in your preparations for a fun-filled career of
terrorism.  If you chose to go to the Lord Omega School, you can apply for a lot
of giverment grants, since we are widely recognized.  We have a 97% placement
record for our gratuates, and the government is still looking for more.  This is
the time!  Go for the gold, and be what YOU want to be.
