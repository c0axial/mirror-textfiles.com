Chapter IV: Gasoline

  Undoubtedly you have messed with gasoline before. This is really some
 flammable and useful shit. The peculiar thing about it though, is it can catch
 almost anything on it on fire except for the thing that the gasoline is sitting
 on. For example, wet a rag and cover it in gasoline and light up. After all the
 gasoline is burned away, notice the rag is still wet. Nothing happened at all
 to the rag. If you stuck a firecracker on the rag while it was burning though,
 The firecracker would have went off.

  Recently, As I have a pool and this is the winter months, I had a great chance
 to see the effects of certain things on ice. A pick-axe does a great job at
 getting you soaking wet, because as I was chopping away, the island of ice
 under me decided to sink and it was about 20 below. The water was very stagnant
 as it was sitting for a few months, and you could essentially call it liquid
 fart. This is the kind of water to use as a replacement for "Stinkum" (You can
 find that recipe on almost any BBS).

  But anyway, I started out by trying out a recipe from someone that said how to
 make plastique out of gas, oil, and styrofoam. Wanting to make some fool look
 like a complete asshole, I tried it, and as it turned out, It made him look
 like a complete asshole. The only thing it does is give the gasoline a base to
 melt through the ice without getting soaked. Dont even bother trying to make
 "C-4" from gas and oil. Chances are the oil wont light anyway unless its mixed
 thoroughly with the gasoline.

  Molotov Cocktail:
   ingredients:
    Pepsi bottle
    old rag
    joy detergent (optional)
    FLAMMABLE oil (optional)

 This is one of the simplist make-do bombs that you can make. It doesn't explode
 like some 10 year olds think, but when it busts it makes one hell of a fire.
  Just fill the bottle up with 3/4 gasoline, and any joy or oil you might
 want to add, and stuff the rag in. Wait 5 minutes for the gas to soak up
 into the cloth (cotton is suggested). All you have to do is light it and
 throw it in a window, or in your pool, or where ever a flame would please
 you.

  Gasoline isn't a great thing to start off explosives though. You could pour it
 on an m-80 and chances are(tie m-80 wouldnt go off when you light it. Oh yes,
 remember that gasoline evaporates at a very low temperature. If you put some in
 a milk jug and light the rim, you will probably get a 2 foot flame if you shook
 it before hand.

  Napalm for fun:
   3 parts gasoline
   1 part Joy Dish soap

 Just mix together and the dish soap will burn steadily for quite a time. You
 can also melt certain bar soaps into heated gasoline, but this evaporates your
 gas so I dont like it. This is good for a filler in your basic molotov
 cocktail.

  Chapter V: Roly Poly Match Heads...

  Match heads are your everyday pre-made explosives. Everytime you light one you
 can see how powerful they are. One small head fills up about 250 times its
 volume in flame and about an additional 75 more in smoke.
  You can see the increase in power by putting about 5 or 10 matches
 together and lighting them. Its not much of an increase if they are right
 next to each other but it has a tremendous gain in temperature.

 Here is a interesting concept as written by the /\/\aster:

  Ingredients:
   Tennis Ball
   A few scores of matches
   Sharp knife

 Take the knife and slice into the tennis ball. Make sure that the slot is big
 enough to pour match heads in. The Smaller the tennis ball the faster it will
 be to make the bomb. Start cutting match heads off the matches with a razor or
 the knife and pour into a cup. After you get about 5 packs dump them into the
 tennis ball. Do this until the tennis ball is packed tight. If you have it as
 tight as you can, and the matches are the so called "safety" kind, then throw
 it high into the air and run. As it touches the ground it will explode with a
 great flame. If that doesnt work then you have to try something else. Just make
 the slot about a 1/4" wide and put in a pile of gunpowder and a small fuse. You
 can just light the fuse and stand back. The tennis ball will send forth a
 column of flame and flaming projectiles (match heads) about three feet in the
 air. It's GREAT!

  You can probably think of a thousand places to use these babies...

  Chapter VI: Time delay fuses

  You are probably going to need this for when you decide to do bombs in
 bathrooms (Then you'll really be smokin' in the boys room). You want the bomb
 to go off (preferably) when you are in the deans office. Here is one from an
 old bulletin board message:

  One straw
  Glycerin

 Just wrap your fuse around the bottom of the straw, plug the other end with non
 absorbant fabric (thick cotton) and fill the straw with the glycerin. Light the
 top and it will burn down slowly. You should have enough time to get out of
 there quickly without anyone noticing.
  There is an alternative to this using electronics. Any idiot can make this...

  Materials:
   Solar Ignitor
   9v battery
   3 flexible wires
   a push button switch
   A 9v battery clip

 This is one of the easiest things you can make. Just Connect two wires to the
 Switch, one leading to the battery clip, the other to one lead of the solar
 ignitor. Connect the third wire from the solar ignitor to the other lead of the
 battery clip and then plug in the battery. Just attach the solar ignitor to the
 fuse of whatever you want to blow up and when ever someone presses or steps on
 the switch, KA-BLOOIE. The solar ignitors can be found at Toys 'R' Us and the
 rest at Radio Shack. If this circuit cant light tough fuses, then pack a few
 match heads around the solar ignitor for a good flame.

  How to make a welcome mat switch:

  You can also make a welcome mat switch for this circuit. Just cut two pieces
 of cardboard that will fit under your "friend"'s welcome mat. Glue Tin Foil to
 one piece, enough to cover it, and solder a wire to it. That is your first
 lead. take a wire with about 2 inches stripped from it, and poke it through the
 center of the other cardboard, and poke it back out the top about a half inch
 away (Much like you are trying to sew the cardboard with the wire). Now stick
 some foam rubber or carpet padding on the corners of the tin-foil coated
 cardboard, and glue the other piece of cardboard to it. You should now have two
 pieces of cardboard parallel to each other separated by 4 foam rubber pads at
 the corners. MAKE SURE THE WIRE AND THE TIN FOIL CARDBOARDS AREN'T TOUCHING!
 That will complete your circuit and as soon as you connect the battery your
 solar ignitor will go off. Just slip under his welcome mat at night and either
 ring and run, or pull his knocker with a string from across the street.
 Obviously, you should have some type of explosives or fireworks attac{hed to
 his screen door.

  Chapter VII: Land Mines

  I'm not sure who really wrote this file although i think it's from The Poor
 Man's James Bond by Jurt Saxon. Its very simple. Just take a thick toilet paper
 tube, dip one end in wax until its sealed thick and stuff papers or pour very
 hard glue into that end from the other side of the tube and after you are sure
 its sealed fill it with gunpowder. You might want to put a hole for a fuse
 through the center of the tube (Its a lot easier to detonate if you have a
 fuse). Then pour some elmers glue on top of the gunpowder, after it dries pour
 a layer of crazy glue, then another layer of Elmers glue, and then dip it in
 wax. Wallah, Instant M-80.

  All you have to after that is attach your solar ignitor from the electronic
 fuse and put in some type of packaging. Bury a half inch below the ground and
 stick the switch in the ground about three feet ahead of it. Whenever the
 neighborhood kids come in your yard again, well you can imagine what happens.

  Chapter VII: Iodine Explosive

  A big asshole in your school who beats up hall monitors comes over and rapes
 your girlfriend. Well, for those times that M-80's and land mines are
 inappropiate or Just Wont work, I bring you Iodine Explosives...

  Ammonium Triiodine:  (Also known as Nitrogen Triiodine)
   Iodine Crystals
   Liquid Ammonia
   Mr. Coffee filter papers

  Stir the Iodine crystals into the ammonia at a 1:5 basis. After a few minutes
  with stirring you should see solids beginning to form. Filter this out and mix
  with 1/2 its own volume in water to store. This is HIGHLY shock sensitive. A
  leaf could set it off and some assholes foot on his locker will do it too. One
  crystal is supposedly equivalent to a firecracker and there is in the
  neighborhood of 200 crystals in a teaspoon. To use just stick in a pop can and
  spill all over in front of his locker and when it dries, it is so fucking
  explosive it isn't funny. So don't let it dry on you! To test this out try it
  with 2 grams of Iodine and 10 ml of Ammonia and just throw a brick or a rock
  on it somewhere.

   Chapter VIII: Smoke

   Smoke is very useful sometimes. You can use it to disrupt class, Fool people
  into thinking its a fire, Get rid of some cops on your tail, or any of a # of
  things. Chances are you may have already made a smoke bomb...

   Easy Smoke bomb:
    Gunpowder
    Pipe with one end capped
    Fuse or soiled rag

   Fill the pipe with gunpowder but dont pack it down really tight. Make sure
  there are air pockets in there. Then stick your fuse into the uncapped end and
  light. You should have smoke piling out of there like crazy.

   Another Easy way to get smoke is with castor or motor oil. A few drops of
  these make a tremendous amount of thick black smoke. One method uses it to its
  advantage:

   Smoke screen for your car...

   Run a rubber tubing into your exhaust manifold from the drivers compartment.
   Find a bottle with a small neck that will fit the hose on the drivers
   compartment and fill it with motor oil or castor oil. Whenever you are
   getting a high speed chase, just insert the bottle into the hose. If your
   hose is too small, you will have to use a plastic squeeze bubble or drill a
   hole into the other end of the bottle and cork it. When you uncork it, air
   can get in and the oil will go down the tubing to the red hot exhaust
   manifold, burn, and make a lot of smoke.

    Sometimes you dont want smoke. You want a smokeless flame. That is not-
   so-easily accomplished with the following recipe:

    Materials:		  (by Zaphod Beeblebrox)
     70ml concentrated sulphuric acid
     30ml concentrated nitric acid
     5g ansorbant cotton
     250ml sodium bicarbonate
     250ml beaker
     ice bath
     tongs
     paper towels

  Place 250ml beaker in the ice bath, add 70ml sulfuric acid, 30 ml nitric acid.
 Divide cotton into .7g pieces. With tongs, Immerse each piece in the acid
 solution for 1 minute. Next, rinse each piece in 3 successive baths of 500ml
 water. Use fresh water for each piece. Then Immerse in 250m lm Sodium
 Bicarbonate. If it bubbles rinse in water once more until no bubbling occurs.
 Squeeze dry and spread on paper towels to dry overnight. (Reprinted exactly as
 I have never tried this).

     This concludes Anarchy 3. In the next manual we will get into Plastic
     Explosives, and in anarchy 5 I will get into RDX, TNT, and Nitroglycerin.
     Anarchy 6 will deal with how to use these explosives I have shown you how
     to make and possibly what to do in a nuclear war threat. After that, who
     knows?
