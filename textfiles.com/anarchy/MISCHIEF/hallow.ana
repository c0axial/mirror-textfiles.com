   Halloween is traditionally the "little kid's" holliday.  You know, where
they dress up like He-Man and GI-Joe and go get free candy.  I bet you know
what I'm going to say next. Yep.  Who says OLDER kids can't have that kinda
fun too?  Other than getting free candy, you should also have a blast
(literally).

       +-->  Standard Halloween Demolitions Squad Gear

	  1. A costume.
	       (be creative. Something like...um...how about a demon or a
		axe murder victim...or even better...the axe MURDERER himself.
		this is pretty easy to improvise on, a little make-up and some
		ripped up clothes will also do just fine. Leather can also be
		effective.  The costume is pretty much just to make you look
		like everybody else.)

	  2. A lighter
	  3. Firecrackers (guess why...duh)
	  4. Raid or other aerosol
	  5. Flares (they're great for at night)
	  6. Knives can be fun, too.
	  7. A bag to hold your "goodies".
	  8. Spray Paint
	  9. Eggs are fun
	 10. Soap (for windows...oldie, but a goodie)


       +-->  Standard Halloween Demolitions Squad Conduct

	  1. Be yourself  (and if that's no good, be like your costume)
	  2. Be destructive
	  3. Be cruel  (why go to people's doors when that little kid over
	     there's got YOUR candy?)
	  4. DON'T be nice (this includes saying "Thank-you")
	  5. Watch out!  Cops are ALWAYS patrol Halloween heavily (wonder why)
	  6.  Do a fake ritual for them.  Most people wouldnt know the dif.

       +-->  Some Suggestions of Things to Say to Get You MORE Candy

	  1.  "Huh?  Only ONE candy bar?  You guys must be poor.  I bet you
	    couldn't afford to get your house re-painted if a VANDAL happened
	    to spray paint your house 12 different colors.  Sure hope THAT
	    doesnt happen some night this week."

	  2.  "Shit!  I only have a pound of candy....I hope I do better on
	    sacrifices tonite"

	  3.  "Are there razor blades and pins in this? No?  Do you want some?

	  4.  "Give me candy or die."

	  5.  "What?  No mice?"

	  6.  "Ah Shit!  I forgot my .22!" (pretend you dont notice them)

       +-->  Standard Halloween Vandalism Tactics
			(This should be obvious)

	  1.  Spray Paint their house
	  2.  Soap their windows
	  3.  Burn their shrubs and plants
	  4.  Do donuts in their yard (if you have a car)
	  5.  Be creative, be cruel, be anarchistic.
