     Well, we are back with another
edition of Harassment!!! This is a 
long one and this file contains the
instructions for doing ONE nasty 
thing. Only one thing, but a good
one!!!  Lets get on with it!!!




      This one is for all you people
who are handy with a phone. What you
need is a basic, one piece Touch
tone / pulse switchable phone and
two alligator clips. General Electric
makes a good, cheap phone like the
one I described above. It is Modem #
9110 or #9114. Either one will work.
The only difference between the two
is that one is white and one is 
brown, big deal!  Cut the modular
clip off of the end and attatch one
alligator clip to the green wire and
attatch the other clip to the red 
wire. Get a pliers, a regular size
screwdriver, a wire cutters, and the
phone you just rigged up. You are now
all set to attack your enemies phone
system!!!
     Go to his/her house late one 
night, (Like 2 or 3 a.m.), and find
the junction box for the phone. It is
usually on the outside. This is where
the wires from inside the house meet 
the wire from the pole outside. This
is usually a plastic box near the 
electric meter and is either screwed
shut or held shut by one of those 
little plastic straps. Either unscrew
it with the screwdriver, or cut the 
plastic straps with the wire cutters.
If you are real impatient, or clumsy
with tools, grab a brick and smash it
open!! Once you have it open, you have
to disconnect the wires that go into 
the house. The wires are attatched by
either screws or nuts. Unscrew the
screws or loosen the nuts with the
pliers. Loosen the screws or nuts (
or whatever) on the red wires. Take
off all the red wires that lead into
the house. They are usually the 
thinnest ones. The thick red one is
the one that goes to the pole. Next,
attatch the alligator clip that is on
the red wire on the phone to the screw
or nut where the red wires used to be,
and attatck the other alligator clip
to the green screw or nut or whatever.
You should hear a dial tone. You also
should be able to dial. If you press
the buttons and they either make no
noise, or they make noise but the dial
tone stays, you have the wires 
wrong. Reverse them and now it should
dial. If not, switch the phone to the
pulse position because your enemy is
either living in ancient times or is
too cheap at afford touch tone 
service. For the pulse mode, it makes 
no difference what wire is connected
to what color terminal. 
     Once the phone is working, a
whole world of possibilities opens up
for you, the harasser. You can sit 
there all night and make long distance
calls, but that would take a long time.
A really nasty thing to do is to have
their phone number changed. You
probbably could not do it a 3 a.m., 
but you can maybe do it when no one is
home. It takes only a few minutes.
Call the operator and ask her what 
number you would call to have your 
phone number changed. Call that number
she gives you and tell the person who
answers that you are Mr. Enemy (Use
his/her name) and you have been 
getting lots of prank pgone calls and
you want your number changed. This 
person on the other end will ask what
number you are calling from and your 
name. Tell them your enemies number,
(the number you are calling from) and 
your enemies fathers name. The person
will call you back in a moment to 
check the number you gave her. She 
will say, "Ok, Mr. Enemy, your new
phone number is xxx-xxxx, please
write it down." This is why you had
to disconnect the inside phones,
if you hadn't, they would ring. 
Reconnect the wires you disconnected
earlier and close the box. Pack you
shit up a leave. Your enemy won't
even be able to call home. He/She
won't even know their own phone 
number until the bill comes. There
will also be a charge for the number
change.
      You can do many more things
than just change the number. We
will go into that in
Harassment III. Look for it coming
soon to a BBS or whatever near YOU!

     This is a continuation of
Harassment II. If you have not yet
read Harassment II, you had better do
so, or you will not understand what
we are talking about here.
Lets get going!!!.........



       As stated in Harassment II, 
there are some more things you can
do to your enemy once you have access
to his phones. One thing to do is to
call the gas company and say you are
Mr. Enemy and that you will be going
away for a few weeks and you want
your gas turned off so as to prevent 
a gas fire. They ask for a number that
they can call you back at. Give them
Mr. Enemies number and when the phone
rings, answer it. You can do the same
with the Electric Company.
       If you want to ring up a HUGE
phone bill, you can do this. Get a 
reciever or earpiece from a phone
and attatch to alligator clips to it,
one on each terminal and bring this
with you to your enemies house.
Set up the phone as described in 
Harassment II and dial another
country. Call the Heathro Airport
in Engalnd. Call the operator and
use the overseas operator. Why should
you care, you're not paying for it.
The weather report at the Heathro
airport plays as long as you listen
to it. Go through the operator
and do what she says. She will give
you a country code, then the number 
of the waether at the Heathro 
airport. Once you hear the weather
report coming overe the phone, take
the reciever or earpiece you wired
up earlier and attatch it to the
same terminals that your phone is
hooked up to. (If you can't find
a receiver, you can use a 500 ohm
1/2 watt resistor, it will work just
as well and it costs less). Once
you have the receiver or resistor 
connected across the terminals,
disconnect your phone, but be CAREFUL
not to disconnect the receiver or 
resistor, because it will keep the
line busy and keep the weather 
report coming over the phone line.
If you used a receiver, you can put 
your ear to it and hear it just to
make sure it is working. A call to
England at 2 a.m. is about $4.50 
per minute. Leave this stuff hooked
up for a day or so. You could also
reconnect the red wires you
disconnected earlier so when someone
inside pick up the phone, they
won't know what the fuck is on line!
After a day, like the next night.
open the box a remove the receiver 
or resistor. Sure, your enemy would
have called the phone company, but it 
takes them a couple days to come out.
By the time they get there, everything
will be back to normal.
      Another fun thing to do is to 
take a piece of wire and connect it
across the red and green terminals
in the box. This will make their line
always busy, or disconnect the red wires
and leave them disconnected. That 
will make it so their phone won't work,
but it will sound like it is ringing if 
someone tries to call. Eother condition
will require them to call the phone
repair man out at $60.00 per hour and
fix the problem.


    Well, that is all for
 Harassment III!
