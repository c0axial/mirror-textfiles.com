%   Traps:								     #
%   ------								     #
%     Traps are the vital part of any assassins strategy. So if you are going#
% to be a dealer of death you must learn the art of trap building..	     #
%     All traps don't have to kill, the following traps are made to wound the#
% victim and make the kill easier...					     #
%									     #
%   Trap #1-Foot trap							     #
%   -----------------							     #
%   You will need the following items:					     #
% 1) 8-10 bungi sticks about 7 inches long each 			     #
%[Note]: Bungi sticks are just sticks that have one end sharpened to a point.#
%	 If you want to get fancy 1-1/2 inch dowel works great! 	     #
% 2) A shovel								     #
% 3) A victim								     #
%									     #
%    First off pick a spot where the victim will walk that is soft ground or #
% dirt. Then proceed to dig a hole about 2-3 feet deep and about 2 feet in   #
% diameter. Once the hole is dug take the bungi sticks and line the hole with#
% them so that they are pointing downward at an angle like this:	     #
%	hole wall--> !\ <--bungi stick--> /! <--hole wall		     #
%		     !\ 		  /!				     #
%		     !---------------------!				     #
%   Cover the hole to match the ground cover (use twigs and leaves with      #
% dirt or whatever matches on top) and find a nice hiding spot. When the     #
% victim steps into the hole the stakes will do nothing to him but maybe snag#
% his pants, but when he trys to remove his foot he will be going against the#
% stakes and they will drive into his ankle...				     #
% [P.S.]-For a nice touch you could also put the stakes on the hole floor... #
%									     #
%   Trap #2-Light Bulb Trap						     #
%   -----------------------						     #
%   To make this trap work you must have access inside the victims house and #
% it helps if you don't like them very much. To start go into the kitchen or #
% where ever your mom keeps her ammonia, and put some in a sealable container#
% that it won't eat through. Next, aquire a medical siringe. Go to the house #
% of the victim and get into a room by yourself. Go to the nearest lamp or   #
% light fixture that has a light bulb in it and remove the light bulb. Fill  #
% the siringe with the ammonia and make a small puncture in the light bulb.  #
% It may sound impossible but it's actually pretty easy. Once you have the   #
% the ammonia touching the filament in the light bulb stop injecting and re- #
% place the bulb. Leave the room and try and stay out of there until the     #
% light is turned on. When it is turned on the red hot filament and the      #
% ammonia do all sorts of fun stuff!!....Have fun,    Anselot The Slayer     #
