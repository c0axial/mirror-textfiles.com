  -=] Smoke Bomb [=-
  --- ----- ---- ---

Mix:
 4 parts sugar
 - ----- -----
 6 parts potassium nitrate

Heat:
 over low flame till melts.   stir well, then pour into  container. Before it 
solidifies, put a few matches in for fuses.

 *One pound of this stuff will fill a block nicely with a thick cloud of white 
smoke.

  -=] Generic bomb [=-
  --- ------- ---- ---

1) Aquire a glass container
2) Put in a few drops of gasoline
3) Cap the top
4) Now turn the container around to coat the inner surfaces and then evaporates
5) Add a few drops of potassium permanganate (<-Get this from a snakebite kit)
6) The bomb is detonated by throwing aganist a solid object.

(>                        EXPLOSIVE INFO
                         ==============

  WHEN PETROLEUM JELLY AND POTASSIUM CHLORATE ARE MIXED IN A ONE TO ONE RATIO BY 
WEIGHT, IT MAKES A TOTALY SAFE WET COMPOUND BUT WHEN DRIED IT BECOMES HIGHLY 
EXPLOSIVE AND SHOCK SENSITIVE.

  MIX 3 GRAMS OF POTASSIUM IODIDE AND 5 GRAMS OF IODINE IN A BEAKER WITH 50 ML 
OF WATER. THEN ADD 20 ML OF AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE [AMMONIA WATER 10%]. FILTER THIS 
SUBSTANCE AND THE RESULTING SOLID IS CALLED NITROGEN TRIIODIDE. WHEN THIS IS WET 
IT IS SAFE, BUT WHEN DRY BECOMES VERY EXPLOSIVE AND SHOCK SENSITIVE.

 (TO SET OFF ABOVE EXPLOSIVES, PUT THE MIXTURE ON OR IN SOMETHING THEN DROP IT 
SORT OF LIKE AN IMPACT BOMB. IT, LIKE A HAND GRENADE, WILL EXPLODE ON CONTACT 
WITH ANOTHER OBJECT.)

Carbide Bomb
------------

     This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution....
     Obtain some calcium carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide 
lamps and can be found at nearly any hardware store. Take a few pieces of this 
stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a glass jar with some water.  Put a 
lid on tightly. The carbide will react with the water to produce acedylene 
carbonate which is similar to the gas used in cutting torches. Eventually the 
glass with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a burning rag nearby, 
you will get a nice fireball!


Portable Grenade Launcher
-------------------------

      If you have a bow, this one is for you. Remove the ferrule from an 
aluminum arrow, and fill the arrow with black powder (I use grade FFFF, it burns 
easy) and then glue a shotshell primer into the hole left where the ferrule 
went.  Next, glue a BB on the primer, and you are ready to go!
      Make sure no one is nearby. Little shreds of aluminim go everywhere.


Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower
--------------------------

     For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a 
switch. Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tailpipe
by drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.
     Attach the wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the switch 
and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached to the positive 
terminal on the battery.
     With the car running, simply hit the switch and watch the flames fly!!! 
Again be careful that no one is behind you! I have seen some of these flames go 
20 feet!!!
