        Do you wanna get the "inside scoop" on some one you

know?  I mean... do you really want to find out about

someone's background..... for whatever reason?



*  How `bout knowing things about your prospective partners'

   background before you even sit down at the bargaining

   table?  (Imagine the look on his face when you ask about

   his wife and kids... calling them by name!)



* Or maybe you want to find the jerk who put screws to you in

  your last business deal.



*  Do you want to find out if someone is holding out on you?

   Does he have hidden bank accounts?



* Maybe you have a need for information about something else;

  like finding someone else that may have a "gadget" similar

  to yours on the market.



* Maybe you'd like to locate a missing heir, or determine

  who's responsible for the theft of something you value?



     Would you really like that?



     Well... right here, right now I'm about to tell you how

it can be done.  Now... first of all let me make something

very, very clear:



     I am quite proficient in the methods and techniques of

effective investigation.  The material I'm about to reveal to

you is based solely on my discoveries and experiences in the

trade.  HOWEVER, I am not an attorney.  Therefore, no legal

advice is offered herein.  Be cautioned--this document

neither asserts the legality of any of the methods described

in this writing, nor does it advocate any use of these

techniques without first seeking competent legal advice and

adherence to the law.  My goals are to make you aware of the

techniques; thus, helping you protect your own privacy.



     Having said that.... let's go to it!



     HOW TO FIND ANYONE-ANYWHERE-ANYTIME YOU WANT. . .



     The methods used to locate people outlined herein are

 the same strategies used for locating missing persons of

 both sorts; those missing on purpose, and those with whom

 you've simply lost touch.  First, start with the known and

 work back towards the unknown. . . Like their last place of

 abode.



STEP 1:  Go to the property.  Note the exact location by

street number or exact number of the house.  If the property

in question is located in a rural area, measure the distance,

in miles, from  the nearest intersection back to the

property.



While you are at the property talk to the neighbors using a

suitable pretext to gain their cooperation. (Perhaps you are

doing a genealogy study and trying to locate the subject

because he (or she) is entitled to a portion of their "poor

great uncle's estate.")  This will usually make the neighbors

open up and tell you whatever they know about the

whereabouts of your subject.



On the other hand, you always feel it out.  What if the

neighbor you're talking with hated the subject?  Wouldn't

they be likely to give you all the "juicy goods" on your

target?



Even if the neighbors don't know exactly where the subject

went, they may have noted a "U-haul" at the home on such and

such a date.  Using the right ruse the local U-Haul rental

company can direct you to the subject.  Usually people who

attempt to disappear aren't clever enough to turn the moving

van in, in another city.  This will probably put you right on

top of your subject.



Note any vehicles, cars, boats, campers, write down the

licence plate numbers or registration identification numbers.

These may prove to be of value.  Also look around for major

appliances, (i.e. water heaters), write down the serial

numbers of each item you find. (Using the right pretext you

can find out the identity of the person who purchased the

item by calling area stores.)



STEP 2:  EVERY PARCEL OF LAND IS TAXED!  After visiting the

property go to the TAX ASSESSORS OFFICE with the information

you have gathered.  Sometimes you will also need to visit the

APPRAISAL DIVISION.  Request to see the map and locate the

property 's PARCEL NUMBER.  Make sure to compare the maps

from both offices.  Once you have the parcel number they will

tell you who is paying the taxes.



Next, go to the County Clerks Office of Public County Deed

Records with the owners name and ask for the GRANTEE INDEXES.

Search and find the property owners name and make a list of

all properties by volume and page.  Then the index will refer

you to the Volume number and Page number of the GRANTEE

RECORDS.  Then determine which property by locating the

parcel on your map. Obtain a non-certified copy that deed

with a legal description of the property.



                         PUBLIC RECORDS



County Tax Records:  Real Property Files list the owner, the

address the tax bill is mailed to and a legal description of

the property. County Map Book contains the location of real

property from the legal description. Grantor Files (County

Recorder files) lists information on all recorded documents

of the buyer, (grantee), and the seller, (grantor), such as

loans, deeds or leases.  Usually these items are cross

indexed under both grantee and grantor.



* Registrar of Voters Records:  The voter's registration

  files will usually contain name, address, occupation,

  description, state of birth, registration date, and the

  signature of the target.



* Marriage Records:  Marriage records will provide the name

and address information of the spouse and information about

their birth place and date and other information about their

parents.  In the "Marriage license" files, you will also find

names a and addresses of witnesses to weddings.  These people

are often close contacts of your target.



                   HOW ABOUT THE EASY WAY?



     Finding people can be very easy, provided you "know the

ropes".  There are usually two basic kinds of missing

persons.  They are people who are missing on purpose (they

wanted to disappear), and people with whom you have simply

lost touch.  Those missing on purpose may be escaped cons,

husbands who are tired of paying child support or alimony,

and debt skippers.  The second type are people who have lost

touch over a period of time.  The techniques for finding

people will usually work on either of these two types of

missing persons, although the first type are usually somewhat

harder to find.



     Almost every trace I do can usually be done by

telephone, IF you have the right information--and know what

you're doing.  There's a common mistake among "skippers", he

or she will not detach themselves from there previous life or

their old acquaintances, (i. e. family and friends).

Additionally, the often will keep their old habits.



     When I am tracing, I first ask myself, "Who knows, now?"

"Who are they in touch with?"  If someone else already knows

where they are, why should you go to the expense and headache

of finding them yourself.  Just ask whoever knows!  I guess

you think I'm off my rocker don't you?  NO! You just ask!

Want to know how?



     First, determine with whom your subject may be in touch.

Then design a suitable guise for a pretext call.    You may

assume the identity of a car salesman, insurance adjustor,

pizza delivery man, or whatever is suitable for your specific

situation.  Then design a pretext.  Always write down exact

details of who you are, what your business is about, who you

will name as being involved in your "make believe story" and

as many other details as it takes to make your story

believable.



     Now you will need to study your pretext before making

the call!  Whatever you do. . . DON'T SOUND PARANOID!  Act

normal.  Talk slow and with authority.  Then throw your

pitch, using as many details as you can. Remember you want

this person to co me out and tell you where your subject is.

(Beware of impersonating an officer, this can get you in

serious trouble.)



     Another major rule of thumb in pretext is to never use

the exact name of the party you are looking for.  Use a name

that sounds near the same.  For example, if you are trying to

find Dave Jenkins, ask for Dale Jenkins.  There is a

psychological effect that lends  credibility to your pretext

and often triggers the release of the information you are

after.  Think about it, if someone (a bill collector) were

trying to find you, wouldn't you think  they would get your

name right?  You bet!  And the effect of not calling the

exact name lends credibility to your pretext.  They will

almost always give you what you are looking for.



     Another effective way is again by pretext, but this time

you look in the phone book of the subject's place of origin.

You will be looking for people with the same surname.  But

you will particularly be looking for those names that sound

like the "old-timers" in the community--names like Fannie,

Suzie Mae, or any old names.  As a whole, people today seldom

name their kids Fannie of Suzie Mae.  In today's society

that's like naming a boy Sue.  It simply doesn't happen or if

it does it's vary rare.



     Once you find the name of someone that sounds to be one

of the "old-timers" they will know your subject and almost

anyone else with their surname.  Their leads are sometimes

invaluable.  Give them a call, they will most likely know the

subject or at least who you should call.  One of the best

pretexts for this type call is the "adjuster seeking a

witness".  This one will put most people at ease to share

whatever they know.



                     "IDENTIFIER NUMBER"

                   A HELPFUL USE OF THE SS#



     That's right. Your Social Security number, that mom and

dad so graciously applied for, is the number one "identifier"

used by record keepers.  Almost every document you fill out

includes this key number to aide "record keepers" in filing

the stockpiles of information  they are gathering each and

every day.



     In many states your Social Security number is the same

number as your driver's license number.  The National Crime

Information Center maintains criminal record information on

persons convicted of a felony.  Their files are referenced by

Social Security number and date of birth.



     Credit Bureaus use your Social Security number as the

identifier when accessing or filing information in your file.

The I.R.S. uses your Social Security number as your "tax-

payor I.D.  number".  Government programs, like welfare, HUD,

WIC, and hundreds more, maintain their records by using your

"identifier number".



     The Social Security number escorted the computer

information age into existence.  If it weren't for the use of

this key source that identifies us as individuals across this

nation.  On the average, there are at least 50 government

files on each and every U.S. citizen that are tagged to our

Social Security number.  And, that's assuming we are not a

"player".



     While it is possible that a person could be born in one

state and later apply for a Social Security number in

another, you should be able to determine the state  which is

your subject's "place of birth".



     Here are the number designations for the various states

in the U.S.  I would recommend you copy these and refer to

them as needed:

          HOW TO GET FORWARDING ADDRESSES ... FAST!



     Would you like to know a fast and easy way to get exact

forwarding address information?  It's simple.  What you do is

address a standard envelope to the target you are trying to

find, and insert a blank piece of paper.  This will make it

look like a standard letter.  (The P.O. may get P.O.'d about

you using this one if you do it too often.)  Then you

proceed,  addressing the letter using the last known address.

BUT...in the left hand bottom corner of the envelope write:



                         DO NOT FORWARD

                   ADDRESS CORRECTION REQUESTED



     Guess, what will happen?  You will have your target's

current address back in the mail in a matter of only a day or

so.  The best part of all is that he or she doesn't even know

you're on their trail.  If you get a P.O. Box and need a

street address, what then?



     To get the current street address of someone who has a

P.O.  Box, in a business deal you may file a "Request for

Box-Holder's Address."  You will need to send a letter to

your postmaster as follows:



             REQUEST FOR BOXHOLDER STREET ADDRESS



     Pursuant to provisions of Postal Service Regulations--

(Administrative Support Manual,  Section 352.44)  I, the

undersigned, request that the address of the following holder

of P.O. Box________in ________________________(City) (State) (Zip) 

be provided. The reason for this request is that said boxholder is

conducting a business known as________________________ through said 

post office box, and as a customer require his street address in 

order to pursue a complaint regarding service or (quality) (Non-

delivery) (other)___________________________________________

Dated:________________________________Signature______________

Printed Name________________________



     Ok....I want to go a step further.



     Suppose all you have is the last known address or just

the phone number?  How about I show you how to use this

information to get address, phone number, neighbors names and

even "the full scoop" on your target?



     Would you like to be able to pick up the phone and get

someone's current address or phone number in a matter of

minutes?



     Ok, it's simple.  What you will do is access a little

known database operated by Cole Publishers, which has

statistical information on almost everyone in America!  (This

includes you and me.)



     There is a charge of $2.00 per minute billed to your

phone, but the average call is only a few minutes and you'll

usually get more information from these people in ten minutes

than with most private investigators in hours.



     Private Investigators charge anywhere from $35 to $50 an

hour, here you can get your answers for as little as $5 to

$20.  (I am in no way whatsoever affiliated with the people

who operate this service.)



     To get the best service, you will need the last known

address or the telephone number of the person you are trying

to find.  Then dial 1-900-288-3020 and shoot away!  That's

it! In a matter of minutes you will usually get the exact

address or phone number.



             If you really want to get serious...



     They will also provide you with the three nearest

neighbors names, phone numbers and addresses!  With this

information and a slight amount of creativity you could

design and use a suitable pretext to interview the neighbors.

This may provide the leads you need to find your target, in

the event they have moved from the address you have.  It's

amazing how many trails of information we leave behind us.



                      SKIP TRACING



* Social Locators searches nationwide using the Social

  Security number only.  With this number only, an individual

  and his address can be found.



* National Address Update searches by using former address

  information and gives updated address information on the

  person.



* Real Property Records can be done alpha/situs with an

  emphasis on alpha for skip tracing or asset location.



* Surname Scan searches for individuals by zip code, city,

  state, or nationwide by NAME ONLY!



* NCOA Database Search uses the U.S. Post Office computer

  records and goes back two years to update an individual's

  address.



* Descendent Trace uses the SSA's records to verify a retired

  SS#.



* Neighborhood Scan gives names, telephone numbers, and

  addresses of the occupants near the address you are

  investigating.  This can be of tremendous help in

  background investigations.  (Especially with the right pretext!)



                   MOTOR VEHICLE REPORTS



* Motor Vehicle Registration by VIN provides owner, owner

  address, lien holder, Plate #, etc.



* Motor Vehicle Registration by Plate # provides owner, owner

  address, lien holder, VIN, etc.



* Motor Vehicle Registration by NAME is a unique service that

  list the vehicles registered under a certain name or

  business.  This search makes an excellent asset check.



* Pleasure Craft Registration searches information on boats,

  campers, etc., in a particular state.



* FAA Registration locates information on airplanes on a

  federal level.



               MORE ABOUT THE PAPER TRAIL. . .



     Almost everything you do or say has some recorded trail.

Thousands of companies and government agencies are spending

millions of dollars every year gathering and maintaining

records on each and every one of us.  It would BLOW YOUR MIND

to know just how much information you can get from PUBLIC

RECORDS alone!  And you would be dumbfounded at the vast

number of private companies that keep tabs on us, it is

unreal.



     Think about your visits to the doctor's office, for

example.  There are some interesting things you should know

about medical records.



     I'm sure you have gone to a new doctor before.  What was

the first thing they asked you to do?  My guess is that the

receptionist handed you a clipboard with a long questionnaire

attached, and said, "Would you fill this out right quick?"

Did you notice that this questionnaire requests information

that is often totally irrelevant to your medical condition?

WHAT DOES YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER HAVE TO DO WITH WHETHER

OR NOT YOU HAVE APPENDICITIS?



     Over and above the information we willfully provide,

there is a data bank of medical and personal information

who is gathering and storing additional information into our

"file" everyday.



     Hospitals, insurance companies, and many others I

suspect input medical information about you into this huge,

well maintained computer data bank called the Medical

Information Bureau (M.I.B).  M.I.B. maintains medical records

information on almost every human being in the United States.

If you have ever filled out an application for life or health

insurance you're in M.I.B.'s data bank.  But, you never hear

about it.  Why?  I'll tell you, it's because this bureau is

used primarily by insurance underwriters as they  process

applications for life and health insurance.  And guess what?

Should you neglect to tell your insurer of prior medical

conditions, you lose!  Yes, you may get the policy issued,

but do you think you will get paid when you file a claim?



     Insurance companies can access this information at any

time.  When it comes pay-up time, the insurer punches a few

buttons and accesses the M.I.B. to determine what, if any,

previous medical conditions you have had.  Then, they decide

whether or not to pay your claim.  They like to pull up

information you provided on other applications for insurance

to determine if you falsified answers on their company's

application.  On this basis, you wouldn't believe how many

insurance companies get out of paying claims.  Pretty

interesting, huh?



                  THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY!



     Perhaps your target has a criminal record. . . These

files will usually list the names of acquaintances and

locations where you may pick up leads.



* Criminal Files: While criminal records are available via

data-base research, they are also available on a state wide

basis in many states, simply for the asking.  Criminal record

searches are the heart of good background investigations.

These records can dramatically diminish your risk in almost

any venture.  They are accessible through state and county

repositories.



     Write and request information from one of the following

offices which maintain the respective "state" criminal

conviction records.  Most states will charge a fee of $5 to

$10 to do a criminal records search in their state database.

Some states rule that these records should only be provided

to law enforcement agencies, but it's worth a try. . . What

could you lose. . . 29 cents?



     In those states where criminal records are maintained

     If you are a business person who needs frequent

background information on prospective employees, I would

recommend you obtain a copy of A Guide To Background

Investigations, published by Financial Control Publishing,

Inc., 1820 South Boulder Place, Tulsa, OK 74119, or ask your

local book store to order ISBN #

0-941233-14-6.



     This manual will provide you with the addresses of state

and county criminal repositories, as well as the names and

addresses of other record compilers, such as, Workman's

Compensation Records, Driving Records, College and University

records for education verification, etc.



                      ANOTHER WAY. .  .



     Let me reveal a secret of how to get facts fast--it is

by these bits and pieces that you will often find or trace a

target.  This is a great plan to use in emergency situations.

Start with a plan as I instructed.  Quickly review the

information on your target.  Verify the data by name,

address, and phone number.



     Once you ascertain the address, go to your local library

and review the various "Criss-Cross" directories to match

name with telephone number.  Next, refer to the "City

Directory" usually published by R. L. Polk Co., and/or Cole

Directories.  Here you will be able to determine the names,

addresses, employment status, etc., of all the nearby

neighbors.



     Most of the directories are published annually and are

updated with new information.  This leaves a great paper

trail that can help you get "history" on your target.



     Use the older directories (usually maintained for years

prior) and go back from year to year checking out your

target.  You may discover previous information from years

past, i.e., spouses names, previous addresses, prior

telephone numbers, prior employers, etc.



     With all this new information and a little creativity in

designing a suitable pretext you could really get the inside

scoop, particularly from neighbors who didn't like the

target.  Trust me, people will rattle off anything about your

target if you are prepared with the right pretext.



     Another thing about pretext--it is just as important to

plan your pretext as it is to plan your investigation.  A

seasoned private investigator has mastered the art of "little

white lies" that we call pretext.  You, on the other hand,

will need to design and carefully write out your pretext.

There's nothing that will destroy the effectiveness of a

pretext quicker than stuttering, trying to remember the

details of who you are and why you are calling.



     Always design a pretext that will allow you to go either

way with regard to "liking" or "disliking" your target.  This

will allow you the flexibility to "share" the emotional

feelings of the person you are questioning.  Have you ever

noticed how no-one will say anything bad about someone until

they realize that you too don't like the person in question?

Then they will open up and man . . .  talk about a "low-down

piece of scum."



                      Let's Move On



     If your target is a "high-profile" subject, you may dig

up articles from newspapers (local, state, and national) Most

libraries maintain what is called a "newspaper morgue"

or micro-film of the past issues of newspapers.    The New

York Times Index, the Reader's Guide to Periodical

Literature, The Business Periodicals Index, the General

Science Index, etc., are great references for this kind of

research.  You mean big time P.I.'s actually refer to such

references.  You bet they do.  Knowing what reference to go

to can help you get information fast.



         A QUICK WAY TO LOCATE OR GET INFO ON ALMOST

          ANY AMERICAN BUSINESS WHO HAS A TELEPHONE!



     How would you like to get immediate information on over

9.3 million businesses nationwide?  Well, the American

Business Phone Book by American Business Information has it.

This Phone Book is on a single CD-ROM disk.  You simply

insert it into your computer and with a few key-strokes, you

can quickly locate any business phone number and/or address

in the U. S.



     This new "weapon" will allow you to search and find info

on any company in seconds.  You can search by company name,

state, city, zip code, or area code.  You can even "reverse

search" to find the Company and address by entering the phone

number .



     If you don't have a CD-ROM drive in your computer, you

can get one for as low as $399 through DAK Industries.  You

can reach them at 1-800-325-0800;   they'll ship you a

catalog.  By the way, if you buy their external CD-ROM,

you'll receive a lot of really neat software as a bonus!



     It amazes me just how much data they can put on just one

of these disk.  If I'm correct, and I'm pretty sure I am,

they tell me the volume of information on one CD-ROM disk, if

provided on 8 1/2 X 11" sheets, would be a stack 3 stories

high!  Imagine that.  And there are lots of other CD-ROM

disks that can help almost anyone in any kind of business.

Remember, information is power . . .  but you have to use it!



     Ok.  Here's another little known source that will help

you to get those really hot leads--or get in touch with

whatever experts you may need.  Suppose you need the name of

a "Mercedes Dealer" in Tucson, or the names of "Plastic

Surgeons" in Beverly Hills, or 30 "Hardware Dealers" in

Houston, no problem!  Maybe you need information on the

"Puritan Company," like their telephone number, address,

number of employees, sales volume, etc. Piece of cake!



    We've found a little known source that will allow you to

get this kind of information, inexpensively, with a single

telephone call!  This source will  provide rapid results,

just give them a call, they'll fax the names right away!

There are two ways you can access the system; 900 number

billed to your telephone or you can call their 800 number and

bill it to your credit card.



     The fees are $3.00 the first minute and $2.00 for each

additional minute.  You can reach them at 1-900-896-0000 or

if you prefer to use American Express, Visa or MC, call

1-800-638-7171.



               What?  You WANT MORE???



     Hmmmm.  Ok.  Try this.  Say you have your targets last

known address and want to get the new address really quick,

along with a new phone number. . .



     Mail a post-card from another area besides where "Quack"

is from.  You may write something like this on the card:



     "Bill! You and I must get together.  Someone's going

       to lose their ass!  What does it take to get you

                  to return your damn calls?

          Call me ASAP! at the office: 800-277-6037.



                                     Kelsey McEllen



     Now.  Who is Kelsey McEllen, well, she's your helper.

She's going to get a call within the next couple of days, and

since Kelsey is your code name, you will make either a mental

or written note of the exact time and date of the call.



     In a few weeks when you receive your "in-bound" 800 toll

bill, you will usually have the exact phone number, and on

top to all that, you can call with the new phone number to

the 900 service, either, 900-288-3020, or another that I've

heard good reports about is 900-884-1212. . .



     Now. That's it. If you still can't find 'em, by all

means hire a private detective or use the computers at our

office through the Fax-Cess company.  I've made arrangements

for you to gain almost any information you want using our

in-house sources through this service. Fax-Cess is almost like

having a full time investigator in your office. .  .



     I certainly hope I have served you well.  Please feel

free to contact my operators if you want additional

information about my products and services. . . And no,

you're not alone. Everyone thinks I'm strange. . . Gifted?

Cursed?  Something mysterious. . .



     Thanks but I don't know either.
