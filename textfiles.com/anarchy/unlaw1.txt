 -=] Conferance calls [=-
 --- ---------- ----- --- 
*I recomend that you do this local*

To make a conference call with as many
people you want, just call the operator
("0") and say "Hello, I'd like to make a
conference call." Then give the (first) 
Names (not pirate names, ether) and the
phone #'s of the people you want to call
And she'll do it.(hint: make sure that the
people you are callin are expecting it.
because its damn annoying to be talking to
3 people and having the third be busy for the
whole time   
----- ----

  -=] Charge-a-call phones [=-
  --- ------------- ------ ---

On a charge-a-call phone (there blue but
dont have any coin slots) take a hex wrench
(with a hole in the middle) and remove the
screw in the middle for an extention!
----- -- --- ------ --- -- ----------

  -=] Free calls [=-
  --- ---- ----- ---

From a pay phone, (the kind that gives yo
a dial tone AFTER you put in the dime) and
drop in your dime.  Then dial the #, then
put another dime in!  It'll come back out 
when you finish your call.
