What I am teaching you here:

How to make a simple lock pick, to jimmy peoples locks on their airport
luggage.
 
And, how to use it.

Materials:
            -a normal size paper clip or the tiny ones

Lock Pick making:

Step #1     Get a hold of a paper clip and unfold it all but the last
            segment so it should look like this:  (See diagram below)

|\
|  \   <--  fold this part in so it is just a little but fatter
|    \      (you can do it with your teeth).
|
|
|
|
|
|

Step #2     Bend the leg in a little for a handle.  (See diagram below)

|\
|  \   <--  (foled in)  [note- I couldn't make it fold in all the way
|    \      because of the text picture]
|
|
|__________

How to use:

Step #1     Put the pick in (hook part first).
Step #2     Turn and pull on the handle.

[if this is not working and the paper clip is twist but bending to much,
use a stronger material like a coat hanger or better paper clip]
