          So you want to be a criminal?  Well, if you are wanting to be 
        like james bond and open a lock in fifteen seconds, go to 
        Hollywood because that's the only place your gonna do it. Even 
        experienced locksmiths can spend 5 to 10 minutes on a lock if 
        they're lucky. If you are looking for extremely quick access, 
        look elsewhere.

          The following instructions will pertain mostly to the "Lock-In-
        Knob" type lock, since it is the easiest to pick. If there is 
        sufficient demand, I will later write a file discussing the other 
        forms of entrance, including Dead-Bolt.

          First of all, you need a pick set. If you know a locksmith, get 
        him to make you a set. This will be the best possible set for you 
        to use. If you don't find a locksmith willing to supply a set, 
        don't give up hope; it is possible to make your own, if you have 
        access to a grinder (you can use a file, but it takes forever.)

          The thing you need is an Allen wrench set (very small). These 
        should be small enough to fit into the keyhole slot. Now, bend 
        the long end of the Allen wrench at a slight angle..(NOT 90 DEG.) 
        it should look something like this:

          #1
               \\
                \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  (THIS IS THE
                                                  \\\  HANDLE THAT WAS
                                                  \\\  ALREADY HERE)
                                                  \\\
                                                  \\\
                                                  \\\

          Now, take your pick to a grinder or a file and smooth the end 
        (#1) until it's rounded so it won't hang inside the lock.  Test 
        your tool out on doorknobs at your house to see if it will slide 
        in and out smoothly.  Now, this is where the screwdriver comes 
        in. Is it small enough for it and your pick to be used in the 
        same lock at the same time, one above the other ? Let's hope so, 
        because that's the only way your gonna open it.

          In the coming instructions, please refer to this chart of the 
        interior of a lock:


        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX K
         #  #  #  #   #   #     E
            #     #   #   #     Y
         *     *                H
         *  *  *  *   *   *     O
                                L
                                E
        XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

        #= Upper Tumler Pin
        *= Lower Tumler Pin
        X= Cylinder Wall

        (Note that the above is a greatly simplified drawing)

          The object is to press the pin up so that the space between the 
        upper pin and the lower pin is level with the cylinder wall.  
        Now, if you push a pin up, it's tendency is to fall back down, right?  That's why 
        the screwdriver's in!  Insert the screwdriver into the slot and turn. This 
        tension will keep the "SOLVED" pins from falling back down.  Now, work from the 
        back of the lock to the front, and when you're through.....

          There will be a click, the screwdriver will turn freely, and 
        the door will open. Don't get discourage on your first try!  It 
        will probably take you about 20-30 minutes your first time.  
        After that you will quickly improve with practice.

          This is by no means *THE* most efficient way of entering a 
        house.  If you would like another item or two devoted to these 
        other ways, let the sysop know.
