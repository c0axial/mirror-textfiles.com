SO YOU WANT TO BE A CRIMINAL. WELL, IF  YOU ARE WANTING TO BE LIKE JAMES BOND
AND OPEN A LOCK IN FIFTEEN S ECONDS, GO TO HOLLYWOOD BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
PLACE YOUR GONN A DO IT. EVEN EXPERIENCED LOCKSMITHS CAN SPEND 5 TO 10 MINUTES
ON  A LOCK IF THEY'RE UNLUCKY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR EXTREME LY QUICK ACCESS,
LOOK ELSEWHERE.

THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WILL PERTAIN  MOSTLY TO THE "LOCK-IN-KNOB" TYPE
LOCK, SINCE IT IS T HE EASIEST TO PICK. IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT DEMAND, I WILL
LATE R WRITE A FILE DISCUSSING THE OTHER FORMS OF ENTRANCE, INCLUDING 
DEAD-BOLT.

FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED A PICK SET. IF Y OU KNOW A LOCKSMITH, GET HIM TO MAKE
YOU A SET. THIS WILL BE THE  BEST POSSIBLE SET FOR YOU TO USE. IF YOU FIND A
LOCKSMITH WILLING  TO SUPPLY A SET, DON'T GIVE UP HOPE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE
YO UR OWN, IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A GRINDER (YOU CAN USE A FILE, BUT I T TAKES
FOREVER.)

THE THING YOU NEED IS AN ALLEN WRENCH S ET (VERY SMALL). THESE SHOULD BE SMALL
ENOUGH TO FIT INTO THE  KEYHOLE SLOT. NOW, BEND THE LONG END OF THE ALLEN
WRENCH AT A S LIGHT ANGLE..(NOT 90 DEG.) IT SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE
THIS:

  #1
       \\
        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
\\\\\\         (THIS IS
                                       
               THE HANDLE
                                       
    \\\        THAT WAS
                                       
               ALREADY
                                       
    \\\        (HERE.)
                                       
    \\\
                                       
    \\\
                                       
    \\\


NOW, TAKE YOUR PICK TO A GRINDER OR A F ILE AND SMOOTH THE END (#1) UNTIL IT'S
ROUNDED SO IT WON'T HAN G INSIDE THE LOCK.  TEST YOUR TOOL OUT ON DOORKNOBS AT
YOUR HOUS E TO SEE IF IT WILL SLIDE IN AND OUT SMOOTHLY. NOW, THIS IS WHERE 
THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN. IS IT SMALL ENOUGH FOR IT AND YOUR PICK  TO BE USED
IN THE SAME LOCK AT THE SAME TIME, ONE ABOVE THE OT HER ? LETS HOPE SO,
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY W AY YOUR GONNA OPEN IT.

IN THE COMING INSTRUCTIONS, PLEASE REFE R TO THIS CHART OF THE INTERIOR OF A
LOCK:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\ K
 #  #  #  #   #   #    \ E
    #     #   #   #    \ Y
 *     *               \ H
 *  *  *  *   *   *    \ O
                       \ L
                       \ E
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\

#= UPPER TUMLER PIN
*= LOWER TUMLER PIN
X= CYLINDER WALL
(THIS IS A GREATLY SIMPLIFIED DRAWING)
THE OBJECT IS TO PRESS THE PIN UP SO TH AT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE UPPER PIN AND
THE LOWER PIN IS LEVEL WI TH THE CYLINDER WALL. NOW, IF YOU PUSH A PIN UP, ITS
TENDANCY IS T O FALL BACK DOWN, RIGHT ?

THAT IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN.

INSERT THE SCREWDRIVER INTO THE SLOT AN D TURN. THIS TENSION WILL KEEP THE
"SOLVED" PINS FROM FALLING BAC K DOWN. NOW, WORK FROM THE BACK OF THE LOCK TO
THE FRONT, AND WHEN  YOU'RE THROUGH.....

THERE WILL BE A CLICK, THE SCREWDRIVER  WILL TURN FREELY, AND THE DOOR WILL
OPEN. DON'T GET DISCOURAGE ON  YOUR FIRST TRY! IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE YOU ABOUT
20-30 MINUTES Y OUR FIRST TIME. AFTER THAT YOU WILL QUICKLY IMPROVE WITH
PRACTICE.

THIS IS BY NO MEANS THE MOST EFFICIENT  WAY OF ENTERING A HOUSE. IF YOU WOULD
LIKE ANOTHER ITEM OR TWO D EVOTED TO THESE OTHER WAYS, LET THE SYSOP KNOW.
