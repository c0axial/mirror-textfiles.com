  THIS TUTORIAL WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW TO "PICK" A PIN TUMBLER LOCK.  USE OF THIS
MATERIAL IS FOR LOCKSMITHS ONLY, ANY USE OF THIS INFORMATION FOR ILLEGAL
PURPOSES IS FORBIDDEN AMt@AGAINST THE LAW.  (AS LONG AS WE ARE AT IT, DO YOU
WANT TO BUY SOME LAND IN FLORIDA?)

  IN ORDER TO PICK A PIN TUMBLER LOCK, YOU WILL REQUIRE FOUR ITEMS:  A LOCK,
YOU, A PICK, AND A TENSION WRENCH.  YOU CAN USSUALLY GET THESE AT A LOCKSMITH
STORE, IF YOU CAN NOT FIND ONE NEAR YOU THERE WILL BE AN ADDRESS AT THE END OF
THE ARTICLE THAT YOU CAN ORDER THEM FROM.  HERE IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF A PICK
AND A TENSION WRENCH:

     ________/	 !________
      PICK	   TENSION WRENCH

  MOST PEOPLE KNOW OF THE NEED FOR THE PICK, BUT HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE WRENCH
IS FOR.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WITH- OUT IT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSCE TO PICK A
LOCK.

  IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK, WE COUNT UPON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE LOCK.	BEFORE
WE LOOK AT HOW TO ACTUALLY PICK THE LOCK, WE WIFPLOOK AT THE PARTS OF IT AND
HOW THE IMPERFECTION PART FITS IN.  HERE IS A DISSASSEMBLED LOCK:

  WHEN YOU INSERT A KEY INTO A LOCK, THE BOTTOM OF THE PLUG IS PUSHED UP, AND
IF IT IS THE PROPER KEY, THE TOPS OF THE BOTTOM PINS WILL MATCH WITH THE SPOT
WHERE THE PLUG AND HOUSING MEET, THUS UMTWING YOU TO TURN THE PLUG, AND OPEN
THE DOOR, ETC..  WHEN YOU a#ER THE KEY, THE BOTTOM PINS GO INTO THE VALLEYS OF
THE KEY, THUS MEANING THAT THE KEY MUST HAVE THE RIGHT HEIGHT VALLEYS TO MAKE
THE LOCK OPEN.	PRETTY ELEMENTRY, RIGHT?  WELL NOW WE CAN MOVE ON TO HOW TO
PICK A LOCK.

  IN ORDER TO PICK A LOCK WE (AS I SAID BEFORE) DEPEND ON THE INACCURACY OF THE
MANUFACTURING PROCESS.	THE FIRST THHLG TO DO IS TO INSERT THE TENSION WRENCH
INTO THE LOCK AND APPLY A SLIGHT PRESSURE TO THE LEFT (OR RIGHT IF YOU WISH) SO
THAT IF YOU COULD LOOK INSIDE THE LOCK AT WHERE THE PLUG AND THE HOUSING WOULD
MEET, IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:

	       ! !*! !
     HOUSING   ! !*! !
	       ! !*! !
     __________! !*! !___________
     __________  !*! ____________
	      !  !*!!
     PLUG     !  !_!!
	      !   _ !
	      !  !*!!
	      !  \_/!

  NOW A SLIGHT PRESURE IS ON THE PINS.	BECAUSE THE PINS CAN NOT BE PRODUCED
EXACTLY THE SAME, THERE IS ONE PIN WHICH IS THE WIDEST AND THERE FORE HAS MORE
TENSION ON IT, AND ONE WHICH IS THE THINNEST AND HAS ALMOST NO PRESSURE ON IT.
WE NOW USE THE PICK TO >GENTLY< PUSH EACH PIN UP (AND TRY TO FEEL IT WHEN YOU
LET IT DOWN) UNTIL WE FIND WHICH IS THE TIGHTEST ON AND WHICH IS LOOSEST.
GETTING THE FEEL FOR THIS IS THE HARDEST PART OF LOCK PICKING.	NOW THAT YOU
HAVE FOUND THE LOOSEST ONE, GENTLY PRESS IT UPWARD UNTIL YOU FEEL A SLIGHT
REDUCTION IN TENSION ON THE TENSION WRENCH.  THIS WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE TOP OF
THE BOTTOM PIN BECOMES EVEN WITH THE JUNCTION OF THE PLUG AND

  THE HOUSING.	DO NOT RELEASE ANY TENSION FROM THE WRENCH NOW!  THE DRIVER
WILL NOW BE TRAPPED IN THE HOUSING AS ILLUSTRATED HERE:  (DON'T I DRAW PRETTY)

	    ! !*! !
   HOUSING  ! !*! !
	    ! !*! !
 ___________! !_! !___________
 _______________     ___________
	       ! !*! !
    PLUG       ! !*! !
	       ! \_/ !
	       !     !

  NOW YOU CONTINUE THIS PROCESS WITH EACH OF THE PINS UNTIL YOU WORK YOUR WAY
UP TO THE ONE THAT IS WIDEST.  WITH SOME PRACTICE YOU CAN GET FAIRLY FAST AT
THIS.  I SUGGEST PRACTICING ON A FOUR PIN TUMBLER LOCK THAT IS BOUGHT FROM A
HARDWARE STORE, THE CHEAPER THE BETTER.

  I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS A PATICULAR CONFIGURATION OF THE PINS NOW THAT MAY
PRESENT A PARTICULARLY HARD JOB TO PICK.  THIS IS GRAPHICLY SHOWN HERE BY THE
TWO MIDDLE PINS:

	!*! !*! !*! !*!
	!*! !*! !_! !*!
	!*! !*!  _  !*!
	!_! !*! !*! !_!
	 _  !*! !*!  _
	!*! !*! !*! !*!
	!*! !_! !*! !*!
	!*!  _	!*! !*!
	!*! !*! !*! !*!
	\_/ \_/ \_/ \_/

	     \_______________

  WHEN YOU TRY TO PUSH THE 2ND PIN FROM THE LEFT UP, YOU WILL UNAVOIDABLY BE
PUSHING THE ONE IN FRONT OF IT UP BE- CAUSE OF IT'S LONG BOTTOM PIN.  THE ONLY
SOLUTION FOR THIS IS TO GET A SPECIAL PICK THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS:

	 \
	  \   _______________
	   \_/

  THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT IT IS HARD TO INITIALLY DETECT.  THE
REASON THAT IT MAKES IT HARDER IF IT IS NOT IMMEDIETLY APPERANT IS THAT YOU UN-
AVOIDABLY PUSH THE 3RD PIN FROM THE LEFT UP INTO THE HOUSING, GETTING IT
JAMMED:

	     ! !*! !
   HOUSING   ! !_! !
	     !	_  !
	     ! !*! !
   __________! !*! !________
   ___________ !*! ________
	      !!*!!
     PLUG     !!*!!
	      !\_/!


  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A TECHNIQUE CALLED RAKING.  IT USES A TOOL LIKE
THIS:

	\/\/\/|______________
  BASICLY YOU "RAKE" IT K AND FORTH ACROSS THE PINS, HOPING THAT COMBINED WITH
THE TENSION IT WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT COMBINATION.  THIS WAY HAS BEEN KNOWN TO
WORK FAST AT TIMES, BUT IS NOT VERY RELIABLE, AND I WOULD SUGGEST LEARNING TO
ACTUALLY "PICK" THE LOCK.

  EARLIER I PROMISED AN ADDRESS TO ORDER LOCKSMITHING MATERIALS FROM, SO HERE
IT IS:

 GARRISON PROTECTIVE ELECTRONICS
	    BOX 128
  KEW GARDENS, NEW YORK, 11415

  SOURCES:  PERSONAL PRACTICE AND MANY EXCELLENT BOOKS FROM MENTOR PRESS, IF
YOU WOULD LIKE THEIR CATALOG, SEND A SASE TO:

    THE INTELLIGENCE LIBRARY
