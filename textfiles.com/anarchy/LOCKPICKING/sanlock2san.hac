Introduction
------------

     This is the second in a series of lockpicking philes put out from
Sanctuary.  The first, "An Introduction to Lockpicking" can be gotten from
The Hellfire BBS if you missed it, as well as any other SANctuary phile
that you might want.

     In this phile, we will cover parts 3, Disc Tumbler Locks, and 4, How
to Mount Practice Locks, along with a few dos and don'ts thrown in.  But
starting off will be two lockpicking philes by The Ninja, Room Entry/
Lockpicking Techniques Parts I&II..

THIS IS THE FIFTH OF THE NINJA009 SERIES.  I HOPE YOU'VE ENJOYED THE FIRST
FOUR
BULLETINS AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE AS WELL...

***WARNING*** THERE IS A HEAVILY ENFORCED LAW ON BREAKING AND ENTRY.  IF
YOU
GET CAUGHT FOR B&E, AND YOU ARE OVER 18, YOU WILL DEFINITELY GO TO * JAIL
*...
IF YOU ARE UNDER AGED...STILL DON'T DO IT, SOME TIMES THE STUFF YOU DO
STAYS ON
YOUR FUTURE RECORDS.

BACKGROUND: ----------- NINJA'S WERE ABLE TO WALK THRU WALLS, ENTER AND
LEAVE A
ROOM WITHOUT A TRACE. THIS WAS ONE OF THE STEALTH SKILLS, THAT THE NINJA'S
POSSESSED.  THERE WERE RUMORS THAT NINJAS CAN VANISH INTO A
WALL...WELL...THAT'S A LITTLE HOAX. YES WE ARE ABLE TO ENTER AND EXIT A
ROOM
WITHOUT A LARGE TRACE...IF YOU KNOW HOW JAPANESE HOUSES IN THE ANCIENT
TIMES
WERE BUILT, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SUPPORT POSTS, THEY USUALLY HAVE GRAPPLING
HOOK
MARKS IF A NINJA HAD WALKED THRU THE ROOM TO KILL A PERSON OR SOMETHING.
BUT
ONE HAS TO LOOK VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.

-------------- HOW TO DO ITS: -------------- WELL...I WON'T GET INTO ANY
PHILOSOPHICAL BULLSHIT OR THE ANCIENT STUFF. I'LL GIVE YOU INFO ON THE
STUFF
YOU CAN PUT TO MODERN USE.

HOW TO PICK FILE CABINET LOCKS: ------------------------------- IT'S QUITE
SIMPLE TO PICK OPEN A FILE CABINET.  MOST FILE CABINETS NOWADAYS HAVE A
CHEAP
DISK TUMBLING SYSTEM.  IF THE DISK PATTERNS MATCH THE KEY SHAPE, PRESTO!
IT'S
OPEN.

LET ME BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT DISK TUMBLERS ARE...

          ^  ^  ^  ^  ^           |--|--|--|--|           EACH ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT THE (^) ARROWS ARE POINTING TO ARE           DISKS.  ( SORRY
FOR
THE BAD ILLUSTRATIONS. )

          IF THE KEY INSERTED THRU THE 5 DISKS, AND THE PATTERN OF THE
DISKS           MATCH, IT OPENS.

SO TO MAKE A KEY THAT WORKS WITH MOST (ALL) CABINET LOCKS...

GET A WIRE FAIRLY THICK, JUST THIS ENOUGH TO FIT THRU THE LOCKS. BEND IT IN
THE
FOLLOWING FASHION.

                                +---- THE DISTANCE    SHOULD EQUAL
----------/\/\/\-           v     FROM TOP OF     THE DISTANCE
/\                                /      THE HUMP TO     ACROSS
TWO                               ^       THE BOTTOM OF   TOPS OR       ^
^                               +------ THE HUMP        BOTTOMS  -----|--|

WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR KEY, JUST INSERT IT ALL THE WAY IN.  JERK IT UP AND DOWN
AS
FAST AS YOU CAN, AS YOU TURN THE KEY TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT, DEPENDING ON HOW
THE
LOCK OPENS.  IF YOU GET THE HANG OF IT, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN ANY FILE
CABINET LOCK IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  I USUALLY TAKE ABOUT 3 TO 5 SECONDS
WITH
MY KEY.


OPENING LOCKED DOORS: --------------------- I CAN WRITE A WHOLE BOOK IN
TEACHING HOW TO OPEN LOCKED DOORS.  I'LL TELL YOU THE MOST BASIC WAY OF
DOING
IT.  THIS TECHNIQUE HAS TO BE A DOOR WITH A GAP AS WIDE AS A WIDTH OF A
BUTTER
KNIFE.

IF YOU HAVE A BUTTER KNIFE OR A BUTTER FLY KNIFE OR EQUIVALENT, HANDY, YOU
CAN
OPEN THESE KINDA DOORS AS THOUGH YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THEM.

|              |___|          ____|   |_______                ^
|--------------- THE "BOLT"


IF THE ROUND PART OF THE "BOLT" FACES YOU THEN WITH THE KNIFE, PUSH ON THE
BOLT
WITH THE BACK OF THE BLADE.  AS YOU PUSH, SLIDE THE KNIFE TOWARDS THE SIDE
OF
THE DOOR. (SEE ILLUSTATION FOR CLARITY).  YOU WILL SLOWLY MOVE IT. AND
PRESTO!
THE DOOR IS OPEN.  THE TRICK IS TO SLIDE THE KNIFE AND PUSHING IT AT THE
SAME
TIME, AND HOLD ON TO THE DOOR KNOB. IF IT OPENS INWARDS, GET READY TO PUSH
IT
AS SOON AS THE KNIFE IS THRU THE "BOLT".

FOR THE OTHER CASE ( THE ROUND PART OF THE "BOLT" FACING AWAY FROM YOU ),
YOU
JUST PULL ON THE KNIFE AND GIVE THE SAME SLIDING MOTION.  BE CAREFUL NOT TO
STAB YOURSELF.  THE KNIFE'S CONTACT POINT IS ALWAYS THE BACK OF THE KNIFE.

HOW TO PICK 5 PIN CIRCULAR TUMBLER LOCKS:
-----------------------------------------
THIS IS VERY HARD...IT TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE TO CRACK OPEN THESE KINDS OF
LOCKS.  MOST BIKE LOCKS AND ARCADE COIN SLOT LOCKS HAVE THIS TYPE OF LOCK.

LET ME BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT 5 PIN CIRCULAR TUMBLERS ARE...

         BIRD'S EYE VIEW              _________

                              |
                              +---  THE PINS (NOT ALL FIVE CAN BE SHOWN)

         THE KEY IS A SMALL CIRCULAR TUBE LIKE KEY WITH A LITTLE NOTCH
         AT THE END OF THE KEY, WITH FIVE SMALL DITCHES IN THE TUBE.
         WHEN ALL THE PINS ARE ARRANGED SO THAT THE LOCK TURNS, PRESTO!!!
         SOME HAVE SEVEN PINS....


SO TO MAKE A KEY THAT WORKS WITH 5 PIN BIKE LOCKS AND ET. AL.

MAKING THE KEY IS VERY HARD...YOU HAVE TO MAKE A KEY, EVERYTIME YOU USE IT,
ONCE!  THIS IS A BITCH.  THE PARTS AREN'T THE EASIEST TO FIND EITHER.

FIND 5 SPRING STEEL NEEDLES THICK ENOUGH FOR STRENGTH, BUT THIN ENOUGH TO
FIT INTO THE SIDES OF THE LOCKS.  GET A TUBE THAT FITS THE LOCK PERFECTLY.
YOU CAN KEEP THE TUBE FOREVER.  TAPE THE SPRING STEEL NEEDLES ONTO THE
PIPE.  LET THE SPRINGS STICK OUT ABOUT 5 mm OUT OF THE PIPE.  BUT MAKE SURE
NONE OF THE SPRINGS ARE LAYED OUT EVENLY.  NOW, INSERT IT INTO THE LOCK.
GIVE IT A RAPID IN AND OUT MOTION.  GET A SURGICAL SPRING NEEDLE FROM YOUR
BIOLOGY LABORATORY AND USE THAT TO ROTATE THE LOCK AS YOU JIGGLE IT IN AND
OUT.  I HAD A HELL OF A HARD TIME PICKING OPEN A KRYPTONITE LOCK.  I LOST
MY KEYS TO MY BIKE AND IT WAS LOCKED TO A POLE.  IT TOOK ME ABOUT 20
MINUTES.  I HAD SUCCESSFULLY OPENED ONLY 5 OF THESE TYPES OF LOCKS, ONE OF
THEM BEING A SEVEN PIN.  IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING AND HARD.  BUT WORK ON IT.


OPENING CAR DOOR TYPE 1:
------------------------
I CAN WRITE A WHOLE BOOK IN TEACHING HOW TO OPEN CAR DOORS.  I'LL TELL YOU
THE TWO BASIC WAYS OF DOING IT.  THE FIRST TECHNIQUE IS THE FOLLOWING:

A CAR WITH A LIPPED DOOR LOCK:

           ___
          (   )     ----- DOOR LOCK
           | |
   ________| |___________
           _


THESE DOORS ARE SO EASY TO PICK, IT TAKES A PRO ONLY ABOUT A SECOND TO OPEN
IT.  JUST GET A HANGER AND TAKE IT APART TO BE A SO CALLED STRAIGHT WIRE.
BEND IT LIKE THE FOLLOWING.




     _________________________
                        ______

                        (  L  )  L = LENGTH (ABOUT 1-1/2 INCHES)

     THE LOOP PART OF THE HOOK SHOULD BE JUST BIG ENOUGH TO GRAB THE LOCK.

JUST STICK IT IN THRU THE SIDE OF THE WINDOW.  AS YOU INSERT IT, BEND IT
TOWARDS THE LOCK.  IF THE GAP OF BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE WINDOW IS TOO
SMALL, THEN USE THE SECOND TECHNIQUE.  AS YOU APPROACH THE LOCK AND GET A
HOLD OF IT, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A SNUG GRIP ON THE LOCK BY TUGGING ON IT
ONCE AND PULL IT IN AN UPWARD MOTION, FAST.  PRESTO!!!  IT'S OPEN.  THIS IS
VERY EASY.  JUST PRACTICE ON YOUR OWN CAR OR SOMETHING, IF YOU GET A
CHANCE, PRACTICE IN A SAFE LOOKING PARKING LOTS, (METRO, OR PRIVATE LOTS.)
AND YOU'LL GET THE HANG OF IT.

OPENING CAR DOOR TYPE 2:
------------------------
THIS ISN'T THAT HARD EITHER ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT.

YOU HAVE TO GET:

A METAL RULER ABOUT AN INCH IN WIDTH AND AT LEAST 2 FOOT IN LENGTH.

CUT THE METAL NOTCH IN THE FOLLOWING FASHION.

       |       |
       |       |
       |_      |
         \     |

       |     \_
       |       |
       |       |
       |_______|

DO IT ACCORDING TO THE HARDCOPY'S SCALE FOR THE CUTS OF NOTCHES.
IT IS AS CLOSE TO MINES AS POSSIBLE.  THEN INSERT THE STICK INTO THE
SIDE OF THE DOOR.  FEEL FOR A PIN INSIDE THE CAR DOOR.  ONCE YOU FIND THE
PIN, PUSH SLIGHTLY DOWN ON IT AND THE PULL UP FAST.  BINGO!  IT'S OPEN.
THIS NEEDS MORE PRACTICE THAN THE OTHER METHOD BUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD.
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECTION...SO PRACTICE HARD.

I'LL WRITE SOME MORE LOCK PICKING SCHEMES IN THE FUTURE.  WELL...HAVE FUN.

----------
- PART 3 -                   Disc Tumbler Locks
----------

     To start off, a tumbler lock is any part of the lock that is directly
moved by the key and also has an unlocking function.  So, the tumbler in
the lock we are about to discuss is a lot like a disk, with a small
rectangular looking slot cut into....about the center.

            |   | |  |
            |   |_|  |                       (This is BASICALLY what one
            |        |                        looks like.  Only the edges
            |_      _|                        and corners are slightly more
              |____|                          rounded.)

Figure 1: An individual disc tumbler

     The trick is that the position of the slot can be varied, depending
where the maker wants to put the key slot.  It can be up slightly, further
down slightly, (there are set increments, but there is no REAL reason to
discuss them) but the dimentions of the slot itself never change.  Now
imagine that you take 5 of these disks (approx. nickel sized) and thread
them onto a typical disc-tumbler key.  (The key looks like your normal,
average house key, only smaller.  Keys to outer screen doors arean
example.)  Make sure that the disk you are imagining, are resting in the
absolute bottom of the "V" cut on your key.  (You can do this, if you like,
with 5 pieces of cardboard to help you understand the concept.)

(HEY! It ain't that easy drawing a key in text so give me a break ok??)

Figure 2: Cardboard practice tumblers threaded onto key cuts.


     So you can see that the disks are all the same height.  This is how it
should be with the varied key slots through the cardboard to adjust to the
different depths of the "V" cuts.

     The following is the plug shown in side view.

Figure 3: View of Disk Lock Plug.


     The slots in the plug hold the tumblers in place parallel to each
other but allow each tumbler to move individualy.  The disks protrude
outward from the slots with a constant outward pressure being exerted upon
the disk by little springs under the spring finger of each tumbler.

     Now look at a diagram of a disk cylinder.  This is what the plug
mentioned and shown above slides into.

        \ ___________ /

Figure 4: Cylinder front view.


     Notice the 2 grooves that are 180 degrees apart.  When the plug is
inserted, the disks coming out of the plug are lined up with these grooves.
This is what holds the plug from turning thus releasing the lock.  Once a
correct "key" is found that will turn the mechinism inside the plug, the
disk tumblers will slide down into the plug, then allowing the plug to turn
within the cylinder, thus opening your neighbor's...er....your door...

     The trick is to get all the tumblers at their varied hights, lined up
so that they will all go into the plug and not impeade rotation.  So if you
had a disk tumbler lock that was loaded with all #3 depth disks, and a key
with all #3 height "V" cuts, all the disk would go into the plug and you
would be able to open the lock.  Unfortuanly, such simple designs are never
found, otherwise a straight wire could open the lock.  So the lockmakers
make it so all of the disk are at different depths, making it that much
harder to align all of the disks at the same time.  Rememeber, even 1
protruding disk will keep the lock locked.

     Something to remember is that some locks have as many as 10 disks,
while 5 are the most common, 6 and 7 disk tumbler locks are not too
unusual.

     Another type of disc tumbler lock is one that has two independent
banks of tumblers that are 180 degrees apart.  They fairly normal when you
see them through the keyway,but they are really different because they move
independently.  They do tend to look like a staircase in the keyway.  The
way to tell for sure is by using a feeler or straight pick.  Begin to
manipulate one side.  If both sides then move, you know that you are
dealing with the normal variety.  But if only one side moves, not both, you
know you are dealing with independent banks of disk tumblers.

     Most if not all disk tumbler locks have what is called a plug
retainer.  This keeps the plug from being taken out end-wise from the
cylinder.  They range from cams screwed in at the far end, to snap rings,
to being welded together at the factory.  The most common is a disc
retainer.  This is simply an extra disk added to the end of the plug that
does not move when the key is used.  Some locks have a small hole in the
lock face that can be used to defeat the disk retainer when th elock is
unlocked.  By using a cylinder retainer shim tool (Figure 5) you can push
the disk retainer into the plug and remove the plug from the cylinder.

     Since most plugs have a "shoulder" on them that prevents someone from
pushing them into the cylinder, they can not be accessed that way either.

Basic Appearance
----------------

     Most of the disk tumbler keys look like your house key (pin tumbler
lock) but are a little smaller, about 1/4 or an inch shorter.


Picking
-------

     Okay, you've had alot of backround shit throw at you, now let's put it
to work and try to pick some locks.  I recommend maybe trying your own
locks around the house if you have any.  In part 4, I'll tell you all the
stuff you'll need to get started on mounting some prctice locks if you
choose to do so.

     Once you have found a lock to try, or have mounted a practice lock in
wood and put it in a vise, get a tension wrench (Figure 6).  Insert the
tension wrench into the lock making sure that you don't block the keyway
cause the raking tool in going in next (Figure 7).

Figure 7: Diamond pick used for raking technique

     If you have a problem finding a clear place to insert the tension
wrench into, look for a shallow slot at the top or the bottom of the lock
and put the wrench there.  This is where the key usually bottoms so that
you can't insert the key into the lock too far.  It is a good place to put
the wrench but remember not to apply to much tension.

Figure 8: Keyway view of disc tumblers

     After you insert the tension wrench into the lock, apply a little
turning pressure in the direction that the lock nomally turns in.  Do this
until the disk bind, or cause resistance. Now insert the rake into the lock
under all of the tumblers.  (Note:  Some locks have no backing so be
careful not to stick the pick into the space behind the tumblers.)

     Now, check to see if the rake moves smoothly in and out, touching all
of the tumblers.  If not, the rake may be too high.  Grip is also a factor.
Your best bet would be to hold the pick like a pencil, and let it pivot at
the point where the fingers grab it.  If this is not comfortable, try
holding in a way that is better for you.  Tension is just as important.
Remember to apply CONSTANT tension, but not too little, or too much.  This
you will just have to determine mostly with practice.  Too much tension
prevents the tumblers from moving, while to little gets you just as far.

     So, to recap, sum up, whatever.  Apply a light, constant turning
tension with the wrench, hold the pick right, putting it under all of the
tumblers.  Now move the rake in and out in a scrubbing motion, being sure
to contact all of the tumblers on each pass, in both directions, letting
the pick pivot.

     If you are having trouble with the first method, here are some things
you can try.  Try varing the tension, but don't let off totally.
Sometimes, when you ease tension while doing a stroke, the lock pops open.
Remeber, too much tension can also cause your pick to bend instead of
scrub, so unless you like spending money on new picks, go easy.  Also,
sometimes a figure eight motion works good.  To try this, keep the wrist
loose, and let your fingers move the pick.  One last technique you could
try would be the "ripping" technique.  This is when you carefully insert
the pick into the lock without touching any tumblers, and then ripping it
out in one very fasy stroke.  If you have opened the lock, CONGRATS!  Do it
again..and again..and again..  If not, make sure you are trying to turn the
lock in the right direction.  You can also check the key profile.  If the
key is fairly straight, with few deep "v" cuts, it is easier to open than a
lock that has a key with deep "v" cuts (Figure 9).

     Now that you've picked a disc tumbler lock (hopefully), start to
notice how common these locks are.  And most if not all can be picked by
the same type of raking technique.  After time, you'll catch on to the
tensino mystery and be able to open any disc tumbler lock.  The reason they
are so easy to open is because they are factory made.  So, since they are
off of an assembly line, they have a lot of play in them.  So is it wrong
for us to point out the lack of quality in today's locks by picking them?
Well, maybe, but who gives a shit.




----------
- PART 4 -        Practice Locks and Some Dos and Don'ts
----------     

     Now that you are a practicing thief, whoops..heheh.  I meant
locksmith, you will need lock to practice on.  I suggest getting the
following types of locks:

1. Disc Tumbler Lock
2. Rim or Mortise Pin Tumbler
3. Lever Tumbler
4. Warded Mortise
5. Warded Padlock

     Try to get fairly cheap ones because cheaper usually means easier to
pick.  You should be able to pick most up at a local store, except maybe
the warded mortise lock in which case you may want to go to some second-
hand store, chances are you'll get it cheaper there anyhow.

     What you basically want to do, is mount the lock into a piece of wood
as you would mount it into a door.  Then clamp the wood in a vise.  Or you
could make a sort of cabinet with all the locks in one place and mount the
cabinet on you wall where you can practice.  Either way is fine.  Just make
sure you have SOME PLACE to practice.  A little hint is to put the mounted
lock(s), if possible, in a place where you walk often.  That way you can
practice every time you walk by or atleast you won't totally forget to
practice a little.

     Remeber to practice alot on the pin tumblers once you know how to pick
them (in next phile) because they are the most common.  Also, don't forget
that when you are picking to sometimes practice with a flashlight because
when you are out in the "field", the owner of the house will most likely
not be there holding a flashlight for you.  Try holding the flashlight in
your mouth or even taping it to your arm.  If you want, you can also try
velcro.   Two fifteen minute practice sessions a day should get you well on
your way.

     If you have looked in catalogs for lockpicks, I'm sure you have seen
those "all in one" types.  Where you get 8 picks inside a pen or something.
Well, take a little advice and DO NOT buy one of these.  Why?  Simple.
When you are lockpicking, you will often need to change the type of pick
you are using.  So if you need two hands to unscrew the old pick, and put
on a new one, whixh hand is holding the tension wrench?  None.  So you lose
tension and have to start all over again.  Gee, isn't that fun.  I would
suggest buying one of those leather case tools.  They may be more
expensive, but they are worth it.  Not to mention, the companies that make
those "pen picks" seem to enjoy giving us 8 picks with 5 of them being of a
type you will never use in YOUR lifetime.  So stick to the kits that come
in cases.  These are generally better quality and easier to access cause
you can just drape an open case across your knee when picking.

     Let's just go over the basic things to do when attempting to gain
entry.  First, make sure of the simple things.  Like making sure the door,
as well as windows and such are ACTUALLY locked.  Also make sure that the
door is not jammed.  Check the lock also.  If the lock is old and worn and
requires manipulation when using the right key, do you think that you are
going to be able to PICK it open.  Probably not.

     Next, figure out what type of lock it is.  A stamped metal plate with
a keyway cut into it is usually a warded lock, or a lever tumbler lock
(lever tumblers will be in the next phile.)  The circulaer shaped locks,
like the ones on the door to your house, are usually pin tumbler, disc
tumbler, or wafer tumbler locks (Schlage).  On padlocks especially, if the
core rotates, this could mean a warded lock.  It is a lever tumbler lock if
the rotating core has a slot cut in the side of it's retainer.  If the core
doesn't move, it is a pin tumbler.

     Next, check the keyway for foreign objects.  A little trick some
burglers use is to put broken toothpicks in the key way.  This slows down a
homeowner who could surprise an unalert burgler.

     Also, make sure that you can see the tumblers.  If not, they could be
jammed up inside the cylinder.  Something else that you may sometimes
notice is that there are very few tumblers.  This is because some shity
locksmith put in only a few tumblers, this making the lock easier to pick.
Also, make sure you know what type of lock it is.  It may not be what you
think.

     Also, check for a brand name if visable.  Certain brands like, CORBIN
or RUSSWIN use or have installed slightly different parts making the  lock
a little harded to pick, sometimes (i.e. mushroom pins)

     Next, insert the tension wrench into the plug and try to ratate it.
The more it rotates, the more play is in the lock, meaning it's easier to
pick.  While you are doing this, try to figure out which way the plug
turns.  This is VERY important.  If you apply tension in the wrong
direction whiel picking a lock, you will never open it.  You can tell the
difference by the way the plug stops.  If you feel an abrupt, solid stop,
that is the WRONG way.  If you feel a slow increase in friction to a stop,
that is usually the way to turn it.

     Cleaning the lock is also very important.  Well, not VERY important,
but it is good to know.  A hint if the lock is in bad condidtion is if you
smell some kind of lubricant.  Chancea are that the lock is not in godd
shape and the owner tried to get it to work better by shooting some WD-40
into it, which by the way is bad for locks cause it leaves a residue.  Use
lighter fluid to clean a lock.  Gasoline and LPS-1 are also BAD to use
cause of the residue left after evaporation.  WARNING:  Cleaning the lock
with lighter fluid or naptha (another cleaning agent) leaves a smell.  This
will be left behind after you have gone for the homeowner or whomever to
smell and shows that someone was fideling with the lock.  Flush clean
twice, using a straight tool to work the tumblers betwwen each washing.
Then blow dry.  You could try those gases in a can from cetain chemical
supply house also to blow the lock dry.  The purpose is to float away any
dirt when cleaning and drying the lock.

     Now that the lock is clean, if it wasn't already you are ready to pick
it.  Some people like lubricant in a lock, other don't.  It is your choice,
but if you do, a short squirt of powdered graphite is you best bet to use.

     Also remeber to look under flower pots, rocks, etc for keys before
attempting to open a lock.  Just think where you might hide something, and
look there.

     Try to get into the routine of surveying the lock in the ways just
described.  If you get in a habit of it, you may not overlook something
obvious when it happens.  It will also help you in general to open locks.


Well, that's it for my second phile on lockpicking.  In the next
lockpicking phile, look for articles on:

Lever Tumbler locks &
Pin Tumbler Locks.

So until then,
happy trails,
and remeber not to get the foreskin caught in the zipper.
