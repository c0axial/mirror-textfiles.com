  Today's tutorial will be how to pick Master combination locks.  Here's how:

  First turn it clockwise a couple of times to align the disks inside.	Then
apply slight upwards pressure on the shackle with your forefinger while still
turning clockwise.  At a certain point it will pull the shackle down, note the
number at which it happens.  This number plus 5 is the first digit.  Then start
over, and dial the first number as if you were regularly going to open it.
Then turn counter-clock- wise and pass the first number.  Then pull on the
shackle hard and keep turning counter-clockwise.  It will stop at about 12
numbers.  Anyone of these could be the second number, and you have to try them
all.  The last number is found by dialing the first, then second, and then
after the second, keep turning clockwise while pulling up hard.  It will open
at a certain number and that is the third.  It may take a little practice
before you can do it right.  And this method works best with the newer locks.
Right now I can pick one under 2 minutes, and you can too if you practice.
