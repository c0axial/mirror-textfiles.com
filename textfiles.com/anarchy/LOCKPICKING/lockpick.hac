                             Miracle Lock Picking

     While the basic themes of lockpicking and uninvited entry have not
changed too much in the last few years, some modern devices and techniques
HAVE appeared on the scene...

AUTOS
     Many older autos can still be opened by easily with a SLIM JIM type
opener (these and other auto locksmithing techniques are covered fully in the
book, IN THE STEAL OF THE NIGHT.  Look for it at the next gun-show in your
town.); however, many modern cars have built covers over the lock mechanism,
or have moved the goodies so the Slim Jim will not function...

So...

AMERICAN LOCKSMITH SERVICE
P.O. Box 26
Culver City, CA 90230

Carries a new and improved Slim Jim that is 30" long and only 3/4" wide so it
will both reach and slip through the new car lock covers.  Price is $5.75 plus
$2.00 postage and handling.
    General Motors cars have always been a bane to people who needed to open
them, because the sidebar locking unit they employ is very difficult to pick.
To further complicate matters, the new GM cars do employ metal shields to make
the use of a Slim Jim type instrument very difficult...

So...

LOCK TECHNOLOGY CORP.
685 Main St.
New Rochelle, NY 10801

Offers a cute little gizmo which will easily remove the lock cylinder without
harm and let you enter and/or start the vehicle.  GMC-40 sells for $56.00 plus
$2.00 postage and handling.  The best general automobile opening kit is
probably the set of lockout tools offered by:

STECK MFG COPR.
1319 W Stewart St.
Dayton, OH 45408

For $29.95 one can purchase a complete set of 6 carbon steel lockout tools
that will open 95%+ of the cars around.

     Kwikset locks have become quite popular as one-step-up security locks for
buildings.  They are a bit harder to pick and do offer a higher degree of
privacy than a normal, builder installed, door lock.

So...

Kwikset locks can be handily disassembled and the door opened, without harm to
either the lock or the door, by using a KIWK-OUT tool sold by:

A MFG

Price is $11.95, but if you are too lazy to pick auto locks...

VEEHOF SUPPLY

Storm Lake, IO 50588

Still sells tryout keys for most cars.  Price averages about $20.00 a set.


Updated Lock Picking:

     For years, there have been a number of pick attack procedures for most
pin and disc tumbler lock systems.  In reverse order of ease they are:

Normal picking:  Using a pick set to align the pins, one by one, until the
shear line is set and lock opens.

Raking:  This method uses picks that are constructed wth a series of bumps, or
diamond shaped notches.  these picks are "raked", i.e., run over all pins at
one time.  With luck, the pins will raise into the open position and stay
there.  Raking, if successful, can be much less effort than standard picking
is.

Lock Aid Gun:  This gun shaped device was invented a number of years ago and
has found applicatin with many locksmiths and security personnel.  Basically,
a needle shaped pick is inserted in the snout of the "gun" and the "trigger"
is pulled.  This action snaps the pick up and down strongly.  If the tip is
slipped under the pins, they will also be snapped up and down strongly.  With
a bit of luck, they will strike each other and separate at the shear line for
a split second.  When this happens the lock will open.  The Lock Aid gun is
not 100% successful, but when it does work, the results are quite dramatic.  I
have opened locks with one snap of the trigger, impressing the hell out of
casual bystanders....

Vibrator:  Some crafty people have mounted a needle pick onto an electric
toothbrush power unit.  This vibrating effect will sometimes open pin tumbler
locks;  like instantly...


Technology to the rescue!

     There is now another method to open pin and wafer locks in a very short
time.  Although it resembles the toothbrush pick in appearance, it is actually
and electronic device.  I am speaking of the COBRA PICK.  Designed and sold
by:

FEDCORP
P.O. Box 569
Scottsdale, AZ 85252

The Cobra uses two 9-volt batteries, teflon bearings (for less noise) and a
cam-roller.  It comes with three picks (for different types of locks) and
works both in America and overseas on pin or wafer locks.  It will open common
door type locks in 3 to 7 seconds with no damage (in the hands of an
experienced locksmith).  It can take a few seconds more, or even half a minute
in the hands of someone with no experience.  How much for this toy that will
open most locks in 7 seconds?

$235 plus $4.50 handling.


    If none of these cute, safe and sane ideas appeal to you, you can always
fall back on the magic thermal lance...


    The thermal lance is a rather crude instrument constructed from 3/8"
hollow magnesium rods.  Each "tube" comes in a 10" length, but can be cut down
if desired.  Each one is threaded on one end.  To use the lance, you screw the
tube together with a mated regulator (like a welding outfit uses) and hook up
an oxygen tank.  the oxygen is turned on and the hollwo rod is lit with a
welding igniter.  The device produces an incredible amount of heat.  It is
used for cutting up concrete blocks or even rocks.  An active lance will go
through a foot of steel in a few seconds.

The lance, also known as a burning bar, is available from:
