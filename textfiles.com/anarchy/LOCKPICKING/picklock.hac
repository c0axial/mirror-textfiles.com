    1st number:

              Get out any of the Master locks so you know what's going on.  The
              handle part (the part that springs open when you get the
              combination), pull on it, but not enough so that the knob won't
              move.  While pulling on it turn the knob to the left until it
              won't move any more. Then add 5 to this number. Congradulations,
              you now have the 1st number.

    2nd number:

              Ok, spin the dial around a couple of times, then go to the 1st
              number you got, then turn it to the right, bypassing the 1st
              number once. WHEN you have bypassed. Start pulling the handle and
              turning it.  It will eventually fall into the groove and lock.
              While in the groove pull on it and turn the knob. If it is loose
              go to the next groove; if it's stiff you got the second number.

    3rd number:

              After getting the 2nd, spin the dial, then enter the 2 numbers,
              then after the 2nd, go to the right and at all the numbers pull
              on it.  The lock will eventually open if you did it right. If
              can't do it the first time, be patient, it takes time.
