WHILE THE BASIC THEMES OF LOCKPICKING
AND UNINVITED ENTERY HAVE NOT CHANGED

MODERN DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES HAVE
APPEARD ON THE SCENE...

AUTO'S

MANY OLDER AUTO'S CAN STILL BE OPENED
WITH A SLIM JIM TYPE OPENER(THESE AND
OTHER AUTO LOCKSMITHING TECHNEQUE'SARE
COVERED FULLY IN THE BOOK IN THE STEAL
OF THE NIGHT,BY JOHN RUSSELL III);
HOWEVER MANY MODERN CARS HAVE BUILT
COVERS OVER THE LOCK MECHENISM, OR HAVE
MOVED THE GOODIES SO THE SLIM JIM WILL
NOT WORK...

SO...

AMERICAN LOCKSMITH SERVICE

COVERS(INSIDE THE DOOR).

HANDLEING...

GENERAL MOTORS CARS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A
BANE TO PEOPLE WHO NEEDED TO OPEN THEM,
BECAUSE THE SIDEBAR LOCKING UNIT THEY
EMPLOY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PICK. TO
FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS, THE NEW GM
CARS DO EMPLOY METAL SHIELDS TO MAKE
THE USE OF A SLIM JIM TYPE INSTRUMENT
VERY DIFFICULT...

UPDATED LOCKPICKING

FOR YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF
PICK ATTACK PROCEDURES FOR MOST PIN AND
TUMBLER LOCK SYSTEMS. IN REVERSE ORDER
OF EASE THEY ARE:

NORMAL PICKING: USING A PICK SET TO
ALIGHN THE PINS,ONE BY ONE,UNTILE THE
SHEAR LINE IS SET AND THE LOCK OPENS.

RACKING: THIS METHOD USES PICKS THAT
ARE CONSTRUCTED WITH A SERIES OF
BUMPS,OR DIAMOND SHAPE NOTCHES. THESE
PICKS ARE "RAKED" I.E, RUN OVER ALL THE
PINS AT ONE TIME. WITH LUCK, THE PINS
WILL RAISE INTO THE OPEN POSITION AND
STAY THERE. RAKING,IF SUCCESFUL,CAN BE
MUCH LESS EFFORT THAN STANDARD PICKING.

LOCK AID GUN: THIS GUN SHAPED DEVICE
WAS INVENTED A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND
HAS FOUND APPLICATION WITH MANY
LOCKSMITHS AND SECURITY PERSONEL.
ASICALLY, A NEEDLE SHAPED PICK IS
INSERTED IN THE SNOUT OF THE "GUN" AND
THE "TRIGGER" IS PULLED. THIS ACTION
SNAPS THE PICK UP AND DOWN STRONGLY. IF
THE TIP IS SLIPED UNDER THE PINS, THEY
WILL ALSO BE SNAPED UP AND DOWN
STRONGLY. WITH A IT OF LUCK THEY WILL
STRICK EACH OTHER AND SEPERATE AT THE
SHEAR LINE FOR A SPLIT SECOND. WHEN
THIS HAPPENS THE LOCK WILL OPEN. THE
LOCK AID GUN IS NOT 100% SUCCESFUL, UT
WHEN IT DOES WORK THE RESULTS ARE VERY
DRAMATIC. YOU CAN SOMTIMES OPEN THE
LOCK WITH ONE SNAP OF THE TRIGGER AND
IMPRESS THE HELL OUT OF CASUAL
BYSTANDERS.

VIBRATOR: SOME CRAFTY PEOPLE HAVE
MOUNTED A NEEDLE PICK INTO AN ELECTRIC
TOOTHBRUSH POWER UNIT. THIS VIBRATING
EFFECT WILL SOMETIMES OPEN PIN TUMBLER
LOCKS; LIKE INSTANTLY...

TECHNOLOGY TO THE RESCUE..

THERE IS NOW ANOTHER METHODTO OPEN PIN
AND WAFER LOCKS IN A VERY SHORT TIME.
ALTHOUGH IT RESEMBLES A TOOTHBRUSH PICK
IN APPEARENCE ITS ACTUALLY AN
ELECTRONIC DEVICE.

IM SPEAKING OF THE COBRA PICK THAT IS
DESIGNED AND SOLD BY:

FED CORP.

P.O. BOX 569

SCOTTSDALE AR. 85252

THE COBRA USES TWO 9 VOLT
BATTERIES,TEFLON BEARINGS(FOR LESS
NOISE) AND A CAM ROLLER. IT COMES WITH
THREE PICKS (FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF
LOCKS) AND WORKS BOTH IN AMERICA AND
OVERSEAS, ON PIN OR WAFER LOCKS. THE
COBRA WILL OPEN GROUP 1 LOCKS (COMMON
DOOR LOCKS) IN 3-7 SECONDS WITH NO
DAMAGE, IN THE HANDS OF AN EXPERIENCED
LOCKSMITH. IT CAN TAKE A FEW SECONDS
MORE OR UP TO A HALF A MINUTE FOR
SOMEONE WITH NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL. IT
WILL ALSO OPEN GROUP 2 LOCKS (INCLUDING
GOVT,HIGH SECURITY, AND MEDECOS) ALTHOU
GH THIS CAN TAKE A SHORT TIME LONGER.
IT WILL NOT OPEN GM SIDEAR LOCKS,
ALTHOUGH A DEVICE IS ABOUT TO BE
INTRODUCED TO FILL THAT GAP.

HOW MUCH FOR THIS TOY THAT WILL OPEN
MOST LOCKS IN 7 SEC???

$235.00 PLUS $ 4.00 SHIPPING AND
HANDLEING.

FOR U HARD CORE SAFE CRACKERS (SERIOUS
SHIT) FED CORP ALSO SELLS THE MI-6 THAT

IF NONE OF THESE SAFE AND SANE IDEAS
APPEAL TO YOU , YOU CAN ALWAYS FALL
BACK ON THE MAGIC THERMAL LANCE...

THE THERMAL LANCE IS A RATHER CRUDE
INSTRUMENT CONSTRUCTED FROM 3/8" HOLLOW
MAGNESIUM RODS. EACH TUBE COMES IN A
10' LENGTH, BUT CAN BE CUT DOWN IF
DESIRED. EACH ONE IS THREADED ON ONE
END. TO USE THE LANCE,YOU SCREW THE
TUBE TOGETHER WITH A MATTED REGULATOR
(LIKE A WELDING OUTFIT USES) AND HOOK
UP AN OXYGEN TANK. THE OXYGEN IS TURNED
ON AND THE ROD IS LIT WITH A STANDARD
WELDING IGNIGHTER. THE DEVICE PRODUCES
AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF HEAT. IT IS
USED FOR CUTTING UP CONCRETE BLOCKS OR
EVEN ROCKS. AN ACTIVE LANCE WILL GO
THROUGH A FOOT OF STEEL IN A FEW
SECONDS.

THE LANCE IS ALSO KNOWN AS A BURNING
BAR AND IS AVAILABLE FROM:
