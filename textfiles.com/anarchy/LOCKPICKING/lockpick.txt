Lock picking does NOT just take 15 seconds. Even experienced locksmiths can
spend up to 5 to 10 minutes on a lock.

THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS WILL PERTAIN MOSTLY TO THE "LOCK-IN-KNOB" TYPE LOCK,
SINCE IT'S THE EASIEST TO PICK.

FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED A PICK SET. IF YOU KNOW A LOCKSMITH, GET HIM TO MAKE YOU
A SET. THIS WILL BE THE BEST POSSIBLE SET FOR YOU TO USE. IF YOU FIND A
LOCKSMITH WILLING TO SUPPLY A SET, DON'T GIVE UP HOPE. IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE
YOUR OWN, IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A GRINDER (YOU CAN USE A FILE, BUT IT TAKES
FOREVER.)

THE THING YOU NEED IS AN ALLEN WRENCH SET. THESE SHOULD BE SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT
INTO THE KEYHOLE SLOT. NOW, BEND THE LONG END OF THE ALLEN WRENCH AT A SLIGHT
ANGLE..(NOT 90 DEG.) IT SHOULD LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

#1     \\
        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\         (THIS IS THE HANDLE
                                           \\\        THAT WAS ALREADY
                                           \\\        (HERE.)
                                           \\\
                                           \\\
                                           \\\

NOW, TAKE YOUR PICK TO A GRINDER OR A FILE AND SMOOTH THE END (#1) UNTIL IT'S
ROUNDED SO IT WON'T HANG INSIDE THE LOCK.  TEST YOUR TOOL OUT ON DOORKNOBS AT
YOUR HOUSE TO SEE IF IT WILL SLIDE IN AND OUT SMOOTHLY.

NOW, THIS IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN. IS IT SMALL ENOUGH FOR IT AND YOUR
PICK TO BE USED IN THE SAME LOCK AT THE SAME TIME, ONE ABOVE THE OTHER.

IN THE COMING INSTRUCTIONS, PLEASE REFER TO THIS CHART OF THE INTERIOR OF A
LOCK:

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX| K
 #  #  #  #   #   #    | E
    #     #   #   #    | Y
 *     *               | H
 *  *  *  *   *   *    | O
                       | L
                       | E
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|

#= UPPER TUMLER PIN
*= LOWER TUMLER PIN
X= CYLINDER WALLŠ
(THIS IS A GREATLY SIMPLIFIED DRAWING)

THE OBJECT IS TO PRESS THE PIN UP SO THAT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE UPPER PIN AND
THE LOWER PIN IS LEVEL WITH THE CYLINDER WALL. NOW, IF YOU PUSH A PIN UP, ITS
TENDANCY IS TO FALL BACK DOWN. THAT IS WHERE THE SCREWDRIVER COMES IN.  INSERT
THE SCREWDRIVER INTO THE SLOT AND TURN. THIS TENSION WILL KEEP THE "SOLVED" PINS
FROM FALLING BACK DOWN. NOW, WORK FROM THE BACK OF THE LOCK TO THE FRONT, AND
WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH.....

THERE WILL BE A CLICK, THE SCREWDRIVER WILL TURN FREELY, AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN.
DON'T GET DISCOURAGE ON YOUR FIRST TRY! IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE YOU ABOUT 20-30
MINUTES YOUR FIRST TIME. AFTER THAT YOU WILL QUICKLY IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE.

THIS IS BY NO MEANS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY OF ENTERING A HOUSE.

                              VENDING MACHINE KEYS

This worked for a friend of mine at school (I would never do anything like this)
it got him over $900 in one day.

Here's how to do it:

On almost all vending machines they have those damn round almost unpickable.

When no one is looking quickly press a piece of AIR-HARDENING clay into the
lock.  (Press hard enough to get a good impression.)

Remove the clay carefully and let it dry for however long the clay has to dry as
specified on the package.

You now have a key to fit that lock, (this Type of 'key' can be easily crushed
if you're seen.  But if you're smart you won't though)
