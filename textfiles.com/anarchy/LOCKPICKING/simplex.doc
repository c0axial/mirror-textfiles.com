BEFORE you continue, you should read the article in Informatik-05 on
Simplex locks and have a BASIC (very) understanding of how these locks
operate and how to defeat them (if that is indeed your purpose).

(Insert Standard Disclaimer here)

Usage:
------
simplex XXXXX

where "XXXXX" is your combo strain.

The combo strain is composed of position numbers (0-5) and 
question marks (?).  


Examples:
---------
simplex ?????      Prints ALL possible simplex combinations.

simplex 0??1?      Prints possible combinations knowing that 
                   TUMBLER #1 is correct at position ZERO, and 
                   TUMBLER #4 is correct at position ONE.

simplex 3?0??      Prints possible combinations knowing that 
                   TUMBLER #1 is correct at position THREE, and 
                   TUMBLER #3 is correct at position ZERO.

Current Features:
-----------------
* Prints output to screen as well as file "SIMPLEX.OUT"
* Completely Command-line driven
* Damn.  Not much eh?

Known Problems:
---------------
* [Sometimes on strains like "5?32?" it doesn't know what to do,
  but, if you know this much you should have it open by now.  
  Still it should be fixed in the future.]
! This is repaired in v1.01 !

* ANY others please report to me (see below)!

Future Enhancements:
--------------------
* More Robust coding
* Support for Half Pushes (yikes!)
* Support for almost-known buttons (i.e. "I think it's TWO or 
  THREE, but I'm not sure.")
* A windows version (like anyone gives a shit)
  (which will have an intuitive interface)

How??
-----

1) When looking at a simplex lock, find the ZERO POSITION 
   tumblers first.  These are the easiest to find and will 
   eliminate a bunch of combinations!  Usually locks will have 
   1-3 of these.

2) Next try to find the ONE POSITIONED tumbler (there WILL be 
   at least one!).

3) If you don't have a s00per d00per notebook, go to Stop-N-Go 
   and call your friend and tell him to run SIMPLEX.EXE, print 
   SIMPLEX.OUT, and bring it to you, wherever you may be.

4) Try the shit.  20 or 25 tries should take you less than 5 
   minutes.

If you have any other ideas or comments send them to me.  Or just
write me as to whether you like or dislike this program and how
useful (or not useful) it is.
