			    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IF YOU ARE SEEKING EMPLOYMENT AS A SECRET AGENT,YOU WILL FIND IT NO EASY FEAT
  GETTING A SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TO INTERVIEW YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE.  THERE
  ARE SEVERAL WAYS TO CONTACT THE SECRET SERVICE.......

1)YOU MAY COMPOSE A LETTER OF APPLICATION AND ADDRESS IT TO THE DEFENSE
  DEPARTMENT OR THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND ASK THAT THEY FORWARD IT TO THE PROPER
  QUARTER.BUT THIS IS A DOUBTFUL PROCEDURE AT BEST;THE CHANCES OF YOUR LETER'S
  EVER REACHING ITS FINAL DESTINATION ARE FAIRLY SLIM,AND IF IT DOES ,IT WILL
  TAKE FOREVER AND A DAY.  MREO IMPORTANTLY,IT'S BAD SECURITY.YOUR LETTER IS
  BOUND TO BE HANDLED BY ANY NUMBER OF CLERKS AND MINOR OFFICIALS WHO DO NOT
  HAVE THE APPROPRIATE SECURITY CLEARENCE.THIS SHOULD BE USED AS A LAST RESORT.

2)YOUR BEST BET IS PROBABLY TO TRY TO GET TO KNOW SOMEONE,WHO KNOWS SOMEONE,
  WHO IS IN SOME WAY IN TOUCH WITH ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE SECRET SERVICE.
  SUCH A PEROSN COULD CONCEIVABLY BE...

A)A RETIRED COLONEL OF ARMY INTELLIGENCE
B)A PUBLISHER OF NON-FICTION SPY STORIES
C)A POLICE OFFICER OF THE SPECIAL BRANCH
D)THE SECRETARY OF SOME SUCH PERSON

THESE ARE MERELY SUGGESTIONS;THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES.

MEETING THE RIGHT PERSON TO ESTABLISH A LINK WITH THE SERVICE IS STAGE ONE OF
  THE PROCESS.NOW FOR STAGE TWO:  DON'T BE IN A HURRY!  DON'T BLURT OUT WHAT
  YOU WANT IN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OR EVEN THE FIRST FIVE DAYS.PLAY THE
  PERSON ALONG FOR AWHILE.ONCE YOU HAVE GAINED THE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE OF YOUR
  QUARRY AND REACHED THE STAGE WHERE YOU CAN FREELY DISCUSS PERSONAL
  MATTERS,YOU CAN MOVE ON TO STAGE THREE:BROACHING THE SUBJECT.FIND THE RIGHT
  PLACE,RIGHT MOOD.DON'T JUST TELL YOUR FRIEND OUT RIGHT WHAT YO_:9Q9MAKE UP
  SOMETHING .FROM THERE YOU SHOULD BE TAKEN TO SEE SOMEONE THEN ON UP THE
  LADDER UNTIL YO SEE THE RIGHT PERSON FOR YOUR NEEDS.
