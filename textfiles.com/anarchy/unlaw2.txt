Carbide Bomb
------------

     This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exer-
cise extreme caution....
     Obtain some calcium carbide. This
is the stuff that is used in carbide
lamps and can be found at nearly any
hardware store. Take a few pieces of
this stuff (it looks like gravel) and
put it in a glass jar with some water.
Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will
react with the water to produce acedy-
lene carbonate which is similar to the
gas used in cutting torches. Eventually
the glass with explode from internal
pressure. If you leave a burning rag    nearby, you will get a nice fireball!


Portable Grenade Launcher
-------------------------

      If you have a bow, this one is foryou. Remove the ferrule from an aluminumarrow, and fill the arrow with black
powder (I use grade FFFF, it burns easy)and then glue a shotshell primer into 
the hole left where the ferrule went.
Next, glue a BB on the primer, and you
are ready to go!
      Make sure no one is nearby. Littleshreds of aluminim go everywhere.


Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower
--------------------------

     For this one, all you need is a 
car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a
switch. Install the spark plug into the
last four or five inches of the tailpipeby drilling a hole that the plug can 
screw into easily. 
     Attach the wire (this is regular
insulated wire) to one side of the 
switch and to the spark plug. The other
side of the switch is attached to the 
positive terminal on the battery.
     With the car running, simply hit
the switch and watch the flames fly!!!
Again be careful that no one is behind
you! I have seen some of these flames
go 20 feet!!!
