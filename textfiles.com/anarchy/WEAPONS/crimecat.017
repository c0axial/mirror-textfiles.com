MONEY FOR NOTHING - Rip-Offs, Cons and Swindles, by M. Allen Henderson
A silver tongue, a goldbricker's heart and the brass to carry a scam
through to the end are qualities found in every successful con man. And
with the telephone, computer, photocopying equipment, TV and radio to
advance his schemes, the professional swindler can thrive today as never
before. If you haven't been a victim yet, it's only a matter of time --
unless you know what to look out for!

Besieged as we are by the rip-off artist, how can we hope to avoid his so-
called deals? This book tells you how. By reading the stories in this book
-- some shocking, some amusing -- find out the COMMON THREADS that run
through every con game. Taken from the news media, these cons -- some so
low-down that it's hard to believe anyone could have the heart, or lack of
it, to pull them off - have happened to someone. Now you can see to it that
they don't happen to you. 5.5 X 8.5, hardcover, 200 pp, $17 (MONEY)(594)


FLIMFLAM MAN - How Con Games Work, by M. Allen Henderson
There's a sucker born every minute - or so you've heard. But showman P.T.
Barnum's cynical appraisal of man's gullibility couldn't possibly apply to
you. Or could it?

Learn how to spot the con man and his tricks before he can relieve you of
your cash! Three-car monte, handkerchief switch, obituary hustle and door-
to-door home-repair scams have been around for ages, and this book explores
them in detail, as well as spiritual bunco, mail-order sex and beauty-
enhancers, electrical gadgets, investment scams and more.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD, By Burt Rapp
Credit card fraud is one of the fastest-growing crimes in the United States
because cards are easy to steal and use. Did you know that someone can
drain your bank account using your cash machine (ATM) card WITHOUT YOUR
SECRET CODE?  Or that clever criminals can get a full month's use from a
stolen credit card before arousing suspicion?

This practical manual from Burt Rapp is for policemen, merchants, bankers
and credit card holders, all of whom have a vested interest in preventing
or detecting credit card fraud. It reveals all the scams, from forged bank
cards to telemarketing rip-offs, and shows you how NOT to become a victim.

ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER SYSTEMS FRAUD
It can happen to you - your entire bank account drained by the latest
nonviolent criminal to hit the streets. That faceless person behind you at
the Automatic Teller Machine could actually be seeking clues to gain access
to YOUR money. Or that pleasant bank employee could be hatching a computer-
ized plot to transfer thousands of your dollars to his account for a quick
withdrawal and a quicker escape out of town. Even if you're insured against
such high-tech theft, it's a major hassle trying to straighten out the
resulting mess with the bank.

This manual is the first in-depth look at this growing crime wave. The
nature and extent of electronic banking fraud is examined, including scores
of actual incidents involving lost or stolen ATM cards and wire transfer
fraud initiated by sharp financial swindlers. Learn the facts BEFORE your
checks start bouncing! 8.5 X 11", 128 pp, $15 (FUND)(787)
