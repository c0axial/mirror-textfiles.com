If you're not an ex-cop, the following inexpensive pocketbooks provide a
tremendous amount of insider information. Reading these books will help to
bridge the gap between novice CrimeFighters and experienced cops.

Of course, no matter how many books you read it won't make you the equal of
an experienced cop!  But, these books (among others in this catalog) will
give you valuable insight on police work in general. That's the first step
- to understand cops, what they do, and how they go about it. If you're
going to be an active CrimeFighter, (indirectly) working with cops, you
need to know all you can what it's like being "on the job". And even if you
don't plan on being an active CrimeFighter, it's still worth while to read
a few of these books to learn what a cop's job is like.

These specially selected books reveal an enormous amount of regular and
irregular police procedure. They contain TRUE stories of hundreds of
investigations. By reading them you can learn a few things - like what to
do and what not to do. If you've led a sheltered life, you'll learn street
language, ghetto slang, and narcotics terminology. Besides being exciting
and fascinating reading, they are excellent Crimefighters' educational
material. If you plan on being an active Crimefighter, read all of them.

An important thing you'll learn is that cops are ordinary human beings, not
supermen or superwomen. The following books lets you take a peek at a cop's
emotions that the public seldom sees. You'll learn that they can cry, and
are scared at times, just like anyone else. But they're trained to do their
job no matter how they feel about it. When you get inside their heads (by
reading their books) you'll understand that YOU are no different from them
- except for the training and dedication. You too, can do police work. Not
everyone can qualify to be a cop, but everyone can be a CrimeFighter!

From the back cover:

           "THEY SEE WHAT WE DON'T SEE. AND THEY PAY THE PRICE.

Cops know how innocent kids get killed by gangs because of an accidental

see next. There's no worst - it does amaze me what people do to other
people."

THE MAKING OF A COP, by Harvey Rachlin, (1991)

From the back cover:

"The making of a Cop is an accurate account of the rigorous discipline and
intensive instruction in the police academy and of how that teaching
changes the lives of the young men and women who will soon be out there on
the streets."  Mark Baker, author of Cops.

Who are the men and women of the New York City Police Academy? What does it
take to survive this unforgiving urban boot camp and emerge a rookie, ready
for a beat on some of the meanest streets in the nation?

To find out, journalist Harvey Rachlin followed four raw recruits from the
Academy to the streets. His dramatic day by day account, THE MAKING OF A
COP, thrusts us into a world of age-old traditions and sudden-death
decisions.

From the intricacies of criminal law to the blazing of .38's on the firing
range, we watch new recruits slowly shed their innocence and open their
eyes to a new and perilous world of perpetrators, lowlifes, search and
seizure, combat reloading. We pound a rookie beat with them - subduing a
crack-crazed mugger, battling the legal machinery to preserve a "good"
bust. We see them absorb the knowledge which may one day save our lives -
or their own.

Taking us through the rigors, the grueling decisions and gut wrenching
fear, THE MAKING OF A COP is a compelling portrait of a group of men and
women striving to become the finest in blue - in a city always alive with
danger and decency, despair and hope.

sad stories, happy stories, and grisly stories. It's what a cop's life is
like - in snapshot stories. Walk a beat with David Hunter, and learn what
it's like to be a cop.

TRUE BLUE, by Ed Nowicki, 1992

"The book that's become an underground legend among cops. True stories
about real cops. No punches pulled. No apologies made. Ed Nowicki has
captured the heart and soul of Police work." Lt. Ernest A Spiotto, Chicago
Police Department.        From the back cover:

Cops dare to tell it like it is...
"Stan approached the driver's door with his ever-present, friendly smile.
The smile was promptly destroyed by a shot fired from a .357 magnum
directly in his mouth. Jack screamed through the car's radio microphone,
'10-1, officer shot. Officer needs help.' Mixed emotions of frustration,
anger, hatred, sorrow, and pity overwhelmed him as he helplessly watched
his partner's life fading away."

They risk it all on streets that have become war zones...
"Ken ran into the street to help the screaming boy who was trapped under
the left side of the Chevy van that was balanced on the curb. It was
teetering slightly, and could come down on the boy at any moment. He had
almost reached the boy when he heard the sound of an engine, and the Chevy
began to rock."

Where a split-second decision can make the difference between an official
commendation and a hero's funeral...
"Two shots rang out and Ted felt something hit the back of his left
shoulder. Adrenaline was now surging through his body. He knew he had been
shot, and he knew he was going to take care of this punk. As he found the
ammo wallet, the Camero began taking off down the road again at a high rate
of speed. Ted carefully took aim and fired the last round from his Chief's
Special."

This is law enforcement as you've never seen it... and cops as they rarely
reveal themselves -- not always by-the-book, but always human."

It is the world's most valuable commodity. It is a business bigger than the
Ford Motor Company. It is cocaine, and a single, ruthless, savagely
sophisticated entity controls the empire: the Colombian Cartel. For two and
a half years, the authors lived on the front lines of this story, and they
provide an astonishing, disturbing inside look at the Cartel and its
operators: the millionaires and enforcers, the smugglers and informers.

THE COCAINE WARS takes us from the jungles of South America where the coca
is grown to the streets of Miami where drug money has corrupted at least
one in every ten cops. With unlimited wealth and power at stake, whole
governments can be bought and sold, and almost every man has his price.

THE COCAINE WARS is investigative reporting that reads like a crime
thriller but has the shocking impact of today's headlines. For the first
time, here is the full story of the traffic in cocaine, the story of the
war being waged - and lost - on the streets all across America."

           "AMERICA'S WAR ON DRUGS - THE TRAGIC, SHOCKING FIASCO

If there were a textbook on undercover work, Michael Levine would have 
written it.  For twenty-five years he was an insider in the DEA - their
TOP undercover cop. A man with a proven record of arrests - personally
accounting for more than 3,000 criminals serving 15,000 years in jail. A
man who now calls America's war on drugs "the biggest, costliest, most
dangerous failure of American policy since Vietnam.

                        IN THIS BOOK, HE PROVES IT.

He takes us with him on one of the most dramatic, ambitious cases ever
mounted - an operation in which the drug kingpins of three countries were
caught red-handed... and tells us why they were never brought to justice.
The result is THE explosive expose of why we're losing the war on drugs -
told in the words of an American who devoted his life to winning it."

  "THE GRIPPING TRUE STORY OF A FEDERAL AGENT'S ONE-MAN WAR AGAINST DRUGS

For twenty-three years DEA agent Michael Levine has waged war against the

to use his cunning, his karate, and savage street smarts to bring to trial
over 3,000 criminals while posing as a Mafia soldier, a Puerto Rican

alongside an unmarked LAPD car and emptied a machine pistol at the cop
inside. Elite OCID Detective Mike Rothmiller lived to tell the story. Now,

illegal surveillance devices to spy on everyone from Robert Redford and
Jerry Brown to Connie Chung and Mohammed Ali. No crime was necessary. Any
public figure or Hollywood star was fair game...

OCID wanted to know who was straight, gay, left, right, friend, foe.

tell the harrowing true story of how he burrowed into the living heart of
organized crime - and how the FBI lost it's nerve!  A charismatic con man,
he played his dangerous games not for money or glory, but to see mob heads

* opened the way to the biggest cocaine bust in history

* played a key role in solving the murder of Federal District Judge John H.
Wood and the related attempt on the life of a government prosecutor - the
FBI's biggest case since the Kennedy assassination

* unraveled the mob's national network for handling stolen goods

* emerged from deep cover to fire the opening shots in U.S. Attorney
Rudolph Giuliani's crusade against the New York City mobs.

once said, "I wouldn't want to have to start Bill's car every morning."

                         Other (True) Cop Stories

LINES AND SHADOWS, by Joseph Wambaugh, by Bantam Books, (1984)

From the back cover:

"The true story only Wambaugh could tell. A band of California cops set
loose in no-man's land to come home heroes, or come home dead.

Not since Joseph Wambaughs's bestselling THE ONION FIELD has there been a
true police story as fascinating, as totally gripping as ... LINES AND
SHADOWS. The media hailed them as heroes. Others denounced them as lawless
renegades. A squad of tough cops called the Border Crime Task Force. A
commando team sent to patrol the snake-infested no-man's-land south of San
Diego. Not to apprehend the thousands of illegal aliens slipping into the
U.S., but to stop the ruthless bandits who preyed on them nightly -
relentlessly robbing, raping, and murdering defenseless men, women and
children.

The task force plan was simple. They would disguise themselves as illegal
aliens. They would confront the murderous shadows at night. Yet each time
they walked into the violent blackness along the border, they came closer
to another boundary line - a fragile line within each man. And crossing it
meant destroying their sanity and their lives.

With each book, it seems, Mr Wambaugh's skill as a writer increases. In
LINES AND SHADOWS he gives an off-trail, action-packed true account of
police work and the intimate lives of policemen  that, for my money, is his
best book yet." Elmore Leonard, The New York Times Book Review.

A saga of courage, craziness, brutality and humor...one of his best books,
comparable to THE ONION FIELD for storytelling and revelatory power."

THE COFFEY FILES, by Joseph Coffey & Jerry Schmetterer  (1991)

THE RIVETING TRUE STORY OF ONE COP TOUGH ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE MOB -
 AND WIN.

Pileggi, bestselling author of WISE GUY.

From the Back cover:

                   Wiseguys, tough guys, and killers...
                  GOTTI, CASTELLANO, GALANTE, THE WESTIES

They terrorized anyone who got in their way... until they came up against
Joe Coffey, the cop with the guts and the street smarts to bring them down.

For more than twenty years, Joe Coffey was on the job and on the backs of
of some of the country's most notorious criminals. Now, New York's most
celebrated detective opens the book on the harrowing cases that made his
reputation. For the first time, he tells the stories of the behind-the-
scenes police work that brought the criminals to justice, earning him
official departmental commendations - and unofficial resentment.

Dramatic. Intense. Compelling. This is police work at its very best.

"When the mob tried to assassinate Joe Coffey's father, it made an enemy
for life... A rare, intimate look at a remarkable career." - William J.
Caunitz, author of ONE POLICE PLAZA.

                                PROSECUTORS

ROUGH JUSTICE, Days and Nights of a Young D.A., by David Heilbroner

From the back cover:

"A fine achievement... what a big-city prosecutor's life is really like...
an eloquent, low-key account of the horrors, tumult, and constant
pressures." - Scott Turow, author of PRESUMED INNOCENT.

                  WELCOME TO 100 CENTRE STREET, MANHATTAN

It's the place where David Heilbroner, an Ivy League lawyer, is going to
get a real education. Andy Warhol's death, the School of Fourteen Bells (a
South American pickpocket-training school), prostitutes working the Holland
Tunnel, a machete-wielding cabbie, and a woman who took a bath in her
children's blood... they're all about to teach him about life in the Big
City and our criminal justice system.

From his bumbling rookie days to trying cases as a seasoned A.D.A.,
Heilbroner portrays this dark, alluring world only as one who's been there
can. His job was to apply the law: his passion was to offer justice. His
bitter-sweet, sometimes hilarious, often shocking story is a timely and
moving tale of crime and punishment today."

"Riveting... more interesting than PEOPLE'S COURT, and more realistic than
L.A. LAW... A must read." - Alan Dershowitz, Professor of Law, Harvard Law
School.       (ROUGH.J)(5018) $5

(This is a must-read if you plan on prosecuting those you catch. It will
shock you (unless you're someone in the know) the way it really is in the
lower courts where 90% of criminal cases are processed. After reading this
book (and maybe a few others like it) you'll realize anyone with a semester
or two on legal procedures and prosecution can do the same job.  With Qui
Tam law, you too, can be an official prosecutor!  This book tells you all
about it, and then some. Entertaining and VERY enlightening.)

The following pocketbooks are mainly fiction, but the difference is,
they're written by cops or ex-cops. While the events and characters are
fictionalized, police procedure and methodology in their books are what
they've learned and lived with during many years of police work. You can
learn about police procedure, their work and their life, from their books.

CLOSE PURSUIT, by Carsten Stroud, (bestselling author of Sniper's moon)

From the back cover:

"Another night falls on New York City. A victim screams. A siren wails.
Eddie Kennedy is on his beat. He's a gold shield homicide detective, and
his next week of investigations is a journey you will never forget - an
electrifying rite of passage into the heart of what it takes to be a cop.
From hookers to rapists to murderers, from street-wise muggers to
stationhouse rats, from the hectic squad room to a bloody alley. Kennedy
takes on a killing city - and takes the reader on a rare ride into a
frightening hidden world."

"Like New York City itself, CLOSE PURSUIT is an assault on the senses. And
it shines a pitiless light on the street cop's perceived enemies - from the
homicidal scum in the streets to the timid "slicks" at One Police Plaza to
the ambitious "suits" roaming the halls of justice, THIS REMARKABLE BOOK IS
AS CLOSE AS YOU WILL COME TO PEERING INTO THE SOUL OF A SQUAD ROOM, AND A
CITY, WITHOUT JOINING UP YOURSELF AND TAKING YOUR CHANCES ON THE MEAN
STREETS. AN EXTRAORDINARY WORK.  Nothing I have read throws you into the
crucible of big-city police work the way this book does. It is a gritty and
gut-wrenching piece of reportage that reads more like a well-crafted work
of fiction." - Nicholas Proffitt, author of The Embassy House.

"THE BEST DAMNED TRUE-LIFE COP BOOK OF THE YEAR." - Bill Granger, author of
The Zurich Numbers.

"The action is breathtaking and the book is a spellbinding view of a world
like no other." - Detroit News.

the jungles of Viet Nam and perfected it on New York's mean streets. It's a
talent that comes in handy when you're a sniper for the NYPD. But over the
years his calling has produced a numbness that has his partner worried: Is
Frank finding it too easy to pull the trigger? Then, when two savagely
mutilated bodies are found with a connection to him, Frank finds himself a
fugitive, dodging cops and meeting violence on a cross-country chase to
find the man who framed him."

"A powerful police procedural by a man who knows the force." - Los Angeles
Times Book Review.
