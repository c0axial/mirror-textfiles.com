                      Rifles, Conversions & Shotguns

WARNING! Be advised you must obtain a permit from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) to own and use full-auto weapons, silencers and
other "restricted" weapons, and in some states, to make and use explosives
and/or explosive devices. BATF requires a separate licensing application.
BATF guidelines are included in some books that show how to convert or make
restricted weapons - when BATF regulations apply.

Other temporary conversions, may or may not require BATF licensing. If not,
the author usually mentions that fact. If the author fails to mention it,
be warned that it might be illegal if you don't have a permit for it!
Please check with BATF guidelines before you make any conversions. ALSO,
check your own state laws for licensing requirements.

Just because the information is legally available in books by virtue of the
First Amendment (Freedom of the Press) doesn't mean it's legal to do it,
make it, or use it!  Publishers of such books usually mention in each
book's description they are for HISTORICAL AND/OR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY.
That lets them off the hook. (You're on your own if you violate any laws!)

THE STURM RUGER 10/22 RIFLE AND .44 MAGNUM CARBINE, By Duncan Long.
Legendary reliability and classic design are the hallmarks of the Ruger

one of the most popular .22 rifles in the world.

simplicity of the Ruger design and offers specs, troubleshooting
procedures, ammunition recommendations, and includes a lengthy chapter on
on the many aftermarket accessories available. This wealth of add-ons can
transform the 10/22 into a lightweight camping gun, compact survival rifle
or even a quasi-assault rifle.

range to more than 100 yards, increasing magazine capacity, speeding up
reloading and reducing recoil. These modifications are well within the
range of most shotgun owner's capabilities and budgets. And because
shotguns have not caught the eye of gun grabbers, you don't have to worry
about your shotgun being confiscated or outlawed as do owners of handguns
and combat-style rifles.
