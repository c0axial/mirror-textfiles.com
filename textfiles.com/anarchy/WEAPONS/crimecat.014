PUT 'EM DOWN, TAKE 'EM OUT! - Knife Fighting Techniques from Folsom Prison
by Don Pentecost.
You may think you know knife fighting theory through books, magazines and
martial arts training, but unless you've actually been assaulted with a
knife, it's ALL theory.

The knife fighting techniques in this book were developed in one of the
most violent environments on Earth - inside Folsom Prison. These techniques
go far beyond what you will encounter on the streets.

Learn the difference between knife fighting fantasy and knife fighting
reality.  The author exposes the ludicrous techniques perpetuated on TV and
in the movies, as well as the absurd (and even dangerous) methods taught by
martial arts instructors. He then outlines REALISTIC aspects of knife
defense and attack unknown to those who have never been in a knife fight.

You never know when you can be the subject of a knife attack. Maximize your
chances of survival in one of the deadliest encounters you may eventually
face.  5.5 X 8.5, softcover, 50 photos, 64 pp, $8 (PUT)(754)


BLOODY IRON, by Jenks and Brown.
This book was written by ex-cons who learned their edged-weapons techniques
in prison and on the streets. It begins with an informal discussion of the
blades and fighting methods used by history's greatest knife fighters, from
King David's son Absalom to Jim Bowie and others. It then goes on to
explain in detail proper stance, style, choice of weapons and unarmed
defensive maneuvers, and a lot more.

KNIVES, KNIFE FIGHTING, AND RELATED HASSLES - How to Survive a REAL Knife
Fight - by Marc "Animal" MacYoung.
Finding yourself in the middle of a knife fight is no time to discover that
you don't know what you're doing. You can forget the useless crap you've
seen in the movies or learned in the dojo: if you don't, you'll probably
wind up in the morgue.

Let Marc "Animal" MacYoung show you the down and dirty reality of knife
fighting. How do you avoid a knife fight? How do you deal with someone
who's pulled a knife WITHOUT pulling your own? How do you handle witnesses?
When does a knife fight escalate into full combat? The author covers these
and related topics in explicit detail. Learn how to choose a good fighting
knife; the best (and worst) grips, draws and stances; dealing with the
police; devious street tricks that people will use to slip a knife into
your kidney; and a lot more.

In a knife fight, you have to rely on your wits, mobility, speed and
knowledge in order to survive. This book shows you just how serious and
complicated knife fighting can be and will provide you with the necessary
skills to come out on top.

SWITCHBLADE - The Ace of Blades, by Ragnar Benson.
SNAP. For most people the click of a switchblade knife is an ominous sound.
Once considered the symbol of black-jacketed street hoodlums, switchblades
have been feared by the public, scorned by the mainstream knife dealers and
outlawed by misguided federal and local laws. Yet the switchblade is
experiencing renewed interest from sportsmen, adventurers and others who
know the value of a good one-handed knife.

Because of their unfortunate reputation, solid information on switchblades
is hard to come by. This book tells you everything you need to know: types
of switchblades and their operating mechanisms; how to use a switchblade,
butterfly and gravity knives; unusual collector's models; assembling a
knife from a kit; federal and state laws; and care and maintenance.
Discover what Ragnar Benson already knows: once you have come to rely on a
switchblade, you will wonder how you ever managed to get by without one.

Knives, by Jerry Younkins.
How does that blade you've had your eye on measure up when put to the test?
Finally, here's a source that will tell you BEFORE you part with your hard-
earned cash. If you haven't recently priced top quality combat knives,
you'll be shocked by how much they cost. It's even more of a shock when you

knowledgeable as you can before you buy, makes sense and saves dollars.

In the first book of its kind, the author reviews a range of commercially
available knives based on materials, design, appearance, availability and
reputation. With category of use in mind, he evaluates each one according
to how it sliced, cut, chopped and chiseled in the field, where performance
counts the most. Also highlighted are technical specifications, including
blade shape, Rockwell rating, edge grind, length, weight and more.

This book is an introduction to some of the better knife designs and a
valuable reference for outdoorsmen and collectors alike. Read and compare -
the good, the bad and the ugly of some of the finest examples of modern
hard-use cutlery.  5.5 X 8.5, softcover, photos, illust., 304 pp, $25

DEFENDING AGAINST THE BLADE
When a video on knife defense opens up with the narrator showing his scars
from knife attacks, you KNOW the information in it comes from firsthand
experience. And the narrator - Peyton Quinn, author of the tremendously
popular book "A Bouncer's Guide to Barroom Brawling" - has plenty of that
too. Unlike the majority of self-defense instructors, Quinn has actually
been assaulted with knives, yet he successfully defended himself each time.
In this extraordinary video, he explains the reality of knife attacks and
explicitly shows how he prevailed. Quinn says, "If I had to rely on my dojo
training alone, I'd likely be dead now."
