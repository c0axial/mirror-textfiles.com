BOUNTY HUNTER - by Bob Burton.
"No body, no booty" is the motto of the modern bountyman. Like his Wild
West counterpart, he tracks the bail fugitive, arrests him in the name of
justice and surrenders him to the police - all for the love of money.

Learn how to talk your way into a bondsman's confidence, acquire the
necessary tools, track and subdue the fugitive, and a whole lot more. And,
compiled for the first time, here is a state-by-state list of the laws of
bounty hunting. With an estimated six million bail jumpers walking the
streets, bounty hunting can be a gold mine for the smart and the daring.

Note: CrimeFighters are bounty hunters too, but the name "bounty hunters"
has been adopted by bail bound recovery agents for many years. The name of
Bounty Hunters is widely used and recognized by law enforcement agencies as
being related mainly with bail bond activity. Even though CrimeFighters are
more like the original bounty hunters (in the Wild West tradition, like
Clint Eastwood in "Hang 'em High"), we'll use our own unique name to create
our own identity with law enforcement people.  While you can be both a
CrimeFighter and a bounty hunter, the name "CrimeFighters" indicates the
difference of our unique role, and much broader activity in law enforcement.

BAIL ENFORCER - The Advanced Bounty Hunter, by Bob Burton.

the streets, down alleys and into drug dens could know. You'll get the

bust, hunting tricks of the trade, surveillance tips, working with the
police, hazards of weapons and the use of deadly force, YOUR arrest and how
to avoid it, and much more.
