                    FloppyBooks' Software Restrictions

FloppyBooks' software and name-related text files are not interchangeable
with other FloppyBooks. The book's name is embedded in the program and the
accompanying text files must have the same name. The software and name-
related text and *.BAT files are programmed to be used for one specific
book. (Some books have a PRINT option, some don't.)

FloppyBooks' software is not intended for use as a general purpose text-
file reader program. Changing the book-reader program to match users' text
files or naming a text file to fit into someone's licensed FloppyBook is
prohibited and a copyright violation. Copyright violation is a felony!

                                 Feedback

Reader's comments, suggestions, corrections, and book contributions (text)
are welcomed by authors and appreciated by future readers. Your feedback
helps to improve technical books and software. Please contact the book
author if you would like to provide additional material or corrections.

If you find errors, please do NOT make the corrections yourself. Instead,
ask the author to make the changes so the original text will not lose its
copyright protection.
                           What's a FloppyBook?

FloppyBooks are electronic books on a floppy disk. Like Shareware, they are
distributed freely on computer bulletin boards. Unlike Shareware, there is
no charge or obligation to read FloppyBooks. Instead of collecting book
royalties, the author may sell related products or services.

When copying FloppyBooks to diskettes or downloading via modems, ALL the
software and their name-related text and *.BAT files must be kept together
as ONE UNIT.  Text files from one FloppyBook cannot be read or printed by
other FloppyBook software because their respective names won't match. When
storing a FloppyBook on a hard drive, keep each FloppyBook UNIT in a
separate directory.
                          Read/Print FloppyBooks

FloppyBooks, Inc. invites and encourages copying of FloppyBooks and passing
them on for everyone's education and enjoyment. A print option on the TOP
BAR of the screen means anyone may print the text for personal use. Print
privileges does not include commercial printing for sale and profit unless
the author specifically grants that privilege in writing or in his book.

Allowing printing of a FloppyBook does not mean the book author gives up
the copyright. Only the author may make changes, additions or deletions to
the text. The author reserves the right to rescind printing authorization
at any time. Page numbering is automatic, but resets to page 1 when the
printing operation is interrupted and restarted.

                           Read/Only FloppyBooks

If a Print option is not available, it's because the author may want to
sell printed versions. Updated, printed versions of FloppyBooks may be sold
at lower prices on BBSs than in book stores, as a pre-publication offer.

To get a professionally printed copy of a FloppyBook, contact the author
whose name appears in the author's copyright section above. If there are
sufficient requests the author may make printed copies available.
