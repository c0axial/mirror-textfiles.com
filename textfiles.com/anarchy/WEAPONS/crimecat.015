STREET-SMART SURVIVAL, A Nineties Guide to Staying Alive and Living Well,
by Victor Santoro.
With the Cold War behind us, the old survivalist formula of "grab the
groceries and run for the hills" has become virtually obsolete. But today's
home-grown threats can be just as deadly. And those that don't threaten
your life may threaten your lifestyle. In telling you how to cope with
today's problems, Victor Santoro identifies the high-grade threats such as
war, epidemics, terrorism, street crime and even institutions, as well as
low-grade threats such as economic recessions, service strikes, lawsuits,
medical malpractice and various invasions of privacy. Then he takes a look
at real-life scenarios and presents down-to-earth solutions. Included are
checklists, exercises and calculations designed to prepare you for any kind
of a threatening situation. 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, 168 pp, $15 (SSS)(992)


SURVIVAL - A Manual That Could Save Your Life, by Chris and Gretchen
Janowsky.
This is one of the best guides we've seen. Lifesaving first-aid and
wilderness medical care, water procurement, improvised survival tools and
weapons - having this book in ANY emergency could mean the difference
between life and death! Every year people die needlessly because of
hysteria, ignorance or overconfidence in their own abilities. Anyone who
runs a snowmobile, flies in airplanes, or travels far from home, needs to
know how to survive on his or her own in the wilderness.

This unique book details the L.I.F.E. system - your secret formula in an
emergency to change what could be a tragedy into a triumph of living -
becoming one with nature instead of fighting it. The authors live by this
system. Now you can live by it too. This book tells you HOW.

                              BENSON'S BOOKS

fuel storage, diesel generators, creating and living in a retreat, raising

your own A-frame cabin, just like his, from local timber in one summer -
3,000 square feet of living space for under $10,000.

THE SURVIVAL RETREAT - A Total Plan for Retreat Defense, by Ragnar Benson.
A fresh approach to retreat defense - the concealed, low-profile survival
retreat is aimed at "winning battles by avoiding them."

Survivalist Benson is noted for his practical perspective; here he tells
you how to harden the city or country refuge against the perils of nuclear
attack. (In spite of the end of the Cold War, there's still thousands of
nukes around the world, some in the hands of dictators!) If no nuke attack,
there's plenty of close-to-home dangers, as well as just plain economic
collapse. In any event, survivalists should plan ahead, locate a retreat
area and keep it hidden as much as possible. This is not another grab-a-
gun-and-shoot-back book. It's a book on planned, prepared survival.

"A retreat is a place you go to live, not to die. Setting up a retreat is,
for the most part, practicing the art of the possible. It's a matter of
wisely and shrewdly identifying what you have available and turning it into
something usable," writes Benson. "Fight if you must, but try to
orchestrate events so that confrontation is absolutely the remedy of last
resort."

Chapters include: Why Retreat?, Retreat Location, Who is the Enemy?, The
Psychology of Defense, Beyond Firepower, What If It Come To a Fight?, and
Making it Difficult.

SURVIVAL POACHING, by Ragnar Benson

uncle and teacher was a member of this tribe; Benson is an old-timer now
with forty years of poaching experience behind him. He tells you how to get
a deer any time you go hunting for one and how to live off the land,
whether in the city or country. He also gives plans for ingenious,
effective traps, snares and deadfalls; plans for permanent, concealed traps
for small game and fish; lessons on woodcraft and scouting; information on
equipment, firearms selection, ammo choices, and lots more.

MANTRAPPING, by Ragnar Benson
This is the first book ever published to explain how to capture the most
dangerous animal: MAN. This highly controversial book is based on Ragnar
Benson's own personal mantrapping experience while on special assignments
in Asia, Africa, North and South America and Cuba.

You have to see this one to believe it! Illustrated with detailed line
drawings, such mantraps as the Malaysian Hawk, The Andes Mountain Trail
Trap, the Sheepeater's Rock Fall, and the Cuba Water Trap are covered. As
Benson says: "To know how to trap your enemy is to know how to avoid being
trapped yourself." Each trap is constructed with primitive materials and
tools. Includes a special chapter on the philosophy of mantrapping.

THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME - Advanced Mantrapping Techniques
by Ragnar Benson
Man - the most dangerous and deadly game of all - is without a doubt
challenging prey. In response to requests for more on trapping this elusive
game, Benson, also author of the infamous MANTRAPPING book, tells how to
easily rig more ingenious traps without explosives and other accoutrements
of war and still catch your quarry.

urban traps designed to make your victim's life undeniably miserable are

SURVIVALIST'S MEDICINE CHEST, by Ragnar Benson
Here's a truly practical guide about using specialized medicines in a world
without doctors. This book was written ESPECIALLY FOR SURVIVALISTS! It
covers pneumonia, VD, plague and diarrhea - which are killers without
modern drugs, but they can be beat with a little preparation and know-how.

From his years helping Third World natives with vet medicines, survivalist
author Ragnar Benson brings you this handbook for doctoring humans with
readily obtainable veterinary medicines. In many cases, vet medicines are
identical to those M.D.s recommend, but at a fraction of the cost. They can
be bought WITHOUT prescriptions and safely stored until an emergency
demands their use.

Tetanus, typhoid, and gun wound infections will never again strike fear in
the hearts of survivalists who have this book. With this well illustrated
handbook and your supply of antibiotics, syringes, sulfa drugs, sewing
needles and sutures, you'll be able to protect anyone from the illnesses
that would otherwise prove fatal without modern medicine.
