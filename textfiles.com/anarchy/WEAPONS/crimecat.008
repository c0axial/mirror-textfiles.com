HOW TO BECOME A MASTER HANDGUNNER, The Mechanics of X-Count Shooting, by
Charles Stephens

Perhaps the most valuable book ever written on the sport of pistol
shooting, this tutorial offers a simple formula for success to the
handgunner who strives to master the technique of shooting accurately.

In a format that is brief, straightforward and easy to read, national
champion and master handgunner Charlie Stephens presents the basic
mechanics of X-count shooting: winning grip, aiming as you press the
trigger, optical focus, controlled movement, stance and total follow-
through. These principles are not entirely new, and some may be considered
unorthodox, but Stephens insists that they are absolutely the key to
becoming a master handgunner, an increasingly rare status among competitive
shooters.

Master and novice alike can learn something from Stephens' book, and it is
certain to serve as a stepping-stone for the shooter who seeks perfection
in performance.   5.5 X 8.5, softcover, photos, 64 pp, $10. (2016)

INSTINCT COMBAT SHOOTING, Defensive Handgunning for Police and Personal
Protection.  By Chuck Klein, Foreword by Bradley J. Steiner.
In a gunfight, missed shots and lost time can result in lost life - your
own. That's why CHECKING YOUR SIGHT PICTURE IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS YOU
CAN DO! During close-quarters combat, when fractions of seconds can mean
the difference between living and dying, you don't want to be doing
anything but pulling the trigger.

It's just plain common sense to keep you eyes focused on the danger in an
armed confrontation - a natural, instinctive reaction. This updated and
expanded version of Chuck Klein's original book will help you hone those
instincts and reinforce them with learned and accurate pistol control.
You'll learn the key techniques of instinct shooting, including how to
identify the smallest centralized target, focus your eyes at the correct
distance and concentrate fully on your target. Plus, you'll be able to
perform realistic combat drills and receive a different kind of target
instruction that exchanges luck for skill.... and which would you rather
depend on when your life's on the line?

Defense. By Peter Alan Kasler.
If you stake your life on the "manstopping" power of your double-action
pistol and ammunition, you'd better get the facts. This book is a serious
critique of the wounding capabilities of handguns and ammo designed for
"business" situations - when one's life is on the line.

years, the author reveals the true physiological and psychological factors
of handgun wounding effectiveness. He then takes a hard look at the strong
and weak points of 9mm, 10mm, .40 caliber and .45 ACP ammo, and compares
major-caliber pistols from Colt, S&W, Browning, Glock, SIG-Sauer, Beretta,
IMI and others. The result: a practical assessment of the best pistol/ammo
combinations - which bullets work best in which guns to get the job done in

GLOCK - The New Wave in Combat Handguns. By Peter Kasler.
Popularized by the media as the "all-plastic gun," the "terrorist special"
and the "gun that can pass undetected through airport security systems,"
the Glock pistol is actually none of these. Since its debut in 1985, the
Glock has been the subject of considerable controversy. What are the
advantages of Polymer 2, the "space-age" plastic of which many of its parts
are made? How many different Glock models are there, and what calibers are
they offered in? Does the Glock's light weight make it "kick" more than a
heavier gun? How safe is its unique "safe-action" trigger system - does it
increase the chance of accidental discharge?

In this book, the author debunks the myths, lays to rest the rumors and,
through photos of a special cutaway Glock that clearly display its inner
mechanisms, demystifies the design and operations of what is the most
innovative handgun to be introduced in some time - and possibly in the
history of firearms. 5.5 X 8.5, hardcover, photos, illust., 304 pp, $25

POWERHOUSE PISTOLS - The Colt 1911 and Browning Hi-Power Sourcebook.
By Duncan Long.
Weapons expert Duncan Long gives shooters an in-depth look at the two most
powerful auto pistols ever created - the Colt 1911 (.45) and 9mm Browning
Hi-Power. The Author explains why the 1911 is considered to be the best
pistol design ever and why the Hi-Power is the most widely-used sidearm in
the free world. Part of the proof of each pistol's popularity lies in the
number of spinoffs each has generated, and Long evaluates specimens from
these also, from Springfield Armory's Defender to the Soviet Tokarev.

Combatants, collectors and hunters interested in practical considerations
such as price, performance and availability will benefit from the author's
straightforward discussions on internal mechanisms, outward design, test-
firing results, maintenance and accessories.

THE MODERN TECHNIQUE OF THE PISTOL, by Greg B. Morrison & Jeff Cooper
This book offers peace of mind. It teaches the modern pistol technique
perfected over the past thirty years through the efforts of Jeff Cooper and
his staff at American Pistol Institute.

You don't have the time to miss in a pistol fight, but too many shooters
believe that all they need to know is marksmanship! Actuality, marksmanship
is just the LAST step in a long list of means to an end. The best marksman
in the world can be defeated if he has not prepared his mind, instilled
correct management skills and given sufficient thought and training time to
TACTICS. Thus, the emphasis of THE MODERN TECHNIQUE OF THE PISTOL is on
mind-set first, gunhandling second, and marksmanship last. This book and
its information could make the difference between life and death for
housewives, businessmen, police officers and military combatants. 8.5 X 11,
hardcover, photos, 176 pp, $45 (MODERN)(1024)

(Editor's note: This book's most important lesson is mind-set: psyching
yourself out ahead of time to do what must be done automatically.
Hesitation at critical moments can be deadly. There must be no mental
wrestling over something that should have been rehearsed mentally many
times - to USE deadly force when necessary. This book will help to prepare
you for deadly confrontations. Tactics is the next important thing to learn
- what to do under various conditions and circumstances. Marksmanship is
critical, of course, but the first two are more important because if you
flunk the first two steps, you may never get a chance to fire your weapon!
"Live" courses taught at Gunsite, Arizona (at Jeff Cooper's A.P.I.) cost
hundreds of dollars and are worth it.  But, if you don't have the time or
can't afford to attend API, this book and others like it, are inexpensive
alternatives.)

LEAD POISONING - 25 True Stories From the Wrong End of a Gun.
By Chris Pfouts.
There are two ways this book can save your life. First, if you've never
been shot, there are vital lessons to be learned from the stories of those
who have. How did the presence of a nickel-plated handgun save one man's
life? How can one person get dropped by a bullet in the arm, while another
gets shot full in the face and yet manages to throw his adversary out of a
second-story window? The answers to these questions and many more, are
found in these real-life accounts. They provide valuable insight into the
violent world of gunplay. This is the gritty reality behind gunshot
statistics and wound ballistic studies.

If you have been shot, or might reasonably expect to be in the future
because of your occupation or other factors, this extraordinary book will
help you sort out the experience better than any unknowing pain therapist
or psychiatrist could ever hope to. This book contains the real-life
stories of 25 people like yourself who were put through the most traumatic
experience of their lives yet lived to talk about it, heal, and go on.

HIDDEN THREAT - A Guide to Covert Weapons. By Mark Smith.
A belt buckle that holds a functional black powder revolver, a wicked
little knife concealed in a comb case, a shotgun disguised as a common
highway flare - these items are not the stuff of spy thrillers. They are
disguised weapons in use today on the streets of America that can pose a
deadly threat to anyone who encounters them.

Intended for use by law-enforcement personnel, this book provides a
fascinating glimpse into the darker side of police work, a world in which
things are not always what they seem to be. HIDDEN THREAT illustrates
objects offered for sale by commercial manufacturers, improvised weapons
and items that have been modified or booby-trapped to create a nasty
surprise. This book will aid security professionals in the detection of
covert and improvised weapons and help informed citizens and CrimeFighters
to recognize innocent-looking items that can be used to lethal advantage.

HANDGUN STOPPING POWER - The Definitive Study
By Evan P. Marshall & Edwin J. Sanow
Dramatic firsthand accounts of the results of handgun rounds fired into
criminals by cops, store owners and a host of others are the heart and soul
of this long-awaited and controversial book by firearms experts Evan
Marshall and Ed Sanow. Their goal is to provide an accurate wound
ballistics and ammunition information that police officers and civilians
can use to survive lethal confrontations on the street.

The use of results of shooting incidents - gathered from such sources as
police reports, autopsies and victim statements - sets this book apart from
all others of its kind, leaving no further need for "expert" opinions or
outdated theories. By combining these case studies of actual shootings with
scientifically controlled test firings into 10-percent ordnance gelatin,
the authors have developed what may be the definitive methodology for
predicting the stopping power of any handgun load. All other theories and
formulas fade in comparison to this detailed data - what REALLY happens
when a bullet meets a man.  8.5 X 11, hardcover, photos, 240 pp, $40

Introduced by Massad Ayoob, gunfight survivor Mark Yuhr dramatically
recounts the gunfight in stark detail. Among lessons covered are point-
shooting versus aimed fire, stopping power, the importance of training, on-
safe versus off-safe carry, and other critical factors in the outcome of a
shootout. The strongest lesson is the importance of the citizen's right to
carry a defensive handgun, intensely re-told by a survivor.  45 min.
