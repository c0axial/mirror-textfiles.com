teach you how to take additional security measures - to keep your goodies
and family a lot safer than you have been. The purpose of this chapter is
to tell you what they know, so you can be aware of the existing problem.

into safes, vaults and safety-deposit boxes. It begins with simple ways to

PICK GUNS - Lock Picking for Spies, Cops and Locksmiths, by John Minnery.
The ability to open locks without keys is no longer monopolized by
locksmiths who jealously guard their secrets. The pick gun has taken the
art of lock picking away from a select few and facilitated the ability for
ANYONE to open locks by mechanical means. Pick guns are openly sold to the
public via mail order magazines! Shouldn't you know more about them?

they work and how to use them - and traces the development of the pick gun
from its early stages to its final state-of-the-art. Included are the
original patents by Epstein, Segal, Moore, Cook and others, as well as info
on pick guns used by the FBI and intelligence agencies. Photos show

CIA FIELD-EXPEDIENT KEY CASTING MANUAL
How does the CIA agent get behind locked doors? One way is by casting a
duplicate key from an original. Lock picks are equally as good, but take a
few seconds longer, and it's more than embarrassing if someone sees you
"picking" a lock. When you can obtain a key, it's a lot easier and makes it
appear you have the legal right to entry. This manual tells you how to make
a duplicate when you can keep the original for just a short period of time.

(That's why you should remove all keys except the car key when leaving a
vehicle with a parking-lot attendant or garage!  Inside your car is the
vehicle registration or other papers with your address. With a key to your
front door or office, it's like an open invitation to burglars.)

This step-by-step, self-checking guide takes you through the process of
preparing the casting mold, making the key impression, and casting a key
model, using a standard-issue or improvised clay-filled casting mold, low-
melting point casting metal and other readily available materials.

This straightforward text and clear instructions of this updated manual
give you the knowledge you need to create accurate keys to gain access to
off-limits areas without special equipment.
