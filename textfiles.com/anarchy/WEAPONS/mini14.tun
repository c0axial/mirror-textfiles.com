       TUNE YOUR MINI -14 by James Mason
          From Guns & Ammo/March 1987

With  the  introduction  of  the Mini-14 rifle, Sturm, Ruger wrought a
major coup in the field of firearms.  This  lightweight  .233  caliber
rifle  displaced  the  M1  Carbine  in  the  hearts  and minds of many
American shooters.

The  scale,  weight,  and  military presence of the Mini-14 made it an
instant hit... the .223 cartridge being vastly superior to .30 caliber
M1 Carbine ammo. Few firearms have so instantly filled a market  niche
as the Mini-14.

Over  the  years,  shooters have come to realize a few shortcomings in
the Mini-14. The factory corrected one of these when  it  brought  out
the  Ranch  Rifle  by  equipping  it  with  scope  blocks and low side
ejection of fired cases. The other concern has to  do  with  accuracy.
The  Mini-14 was never designed for match shooting and delivers 3 to 4
inch groups at 100 yards; throw in the usual "human factor"  and  that
score reads 4 to 6 inch inconsistent groups.

The average Mini-14 owner is not necessarily an accuracy buff, but the
latterday  generation  has  come  to  expect  smaller  groups  from all
rifles. Many shooters are adept at doing minor repairs  on  their  own
guns,  and  tuning  the  Mini-14 for its performance potential makes a
good weekend project for the off-season.

With appropriate references to "kitchen table" gunsmithing, there  are
three  areas where work on the Mini-14 will pay off in tighter groups.
This is a serious project that, while not overly difficult to perform,
requires attention to detail from the amateur gunsmith.

Stock bedding, Trigger group modifications, and sights are  the  areas
that  best  reward  diligent  attention.  Tailored  handloads can also
contribute toward accuracy and will be discussed, but this is  outside
the  reaim  of  a  gunsmithing  activity.  Besides,  a  lot of Mini-14
shooters do not reload, and depend upon commercial  or  remanufactured
ammunition and foreign military fodder.

A  discussion  of some Mini-14 design realities helps put this project
in perspective. As was mentioned above, the Mini-14 was  not  designed
as  a  match  gun.  It  has  a  thin,  low-mass barrel with gas-impulse
actuation. The barrel will vibrate from firing alone, but gas impulses
against the relatively heavy inertia  operating  slide  cause  further
disturbances to barrel nodal movement.

The  Mini-14  gas  system  uses  a  hollow,  fixed  piston though which
propellant  gases  impinge  on  the  operating  slide.  There  is   no
contained,  modulated piston stroke. So, the reaction to the gas pulse
induces a slight bending movement on the mid-barrel section-enough  to
disturb normal barrel vibrational rhythms.

The Mini-14 has a good quality birch stock, which is quite stable, but
not  overly  stiff,  due to the thin wall sections around the receiver
and fore-end. New guns are factory fitted to provide  some  stiffness,
but after shooting a couple of thousand rounds, setting of parts makes
the  stock  fit a fairly loose proposition. Rebedding can restore that
stiffness and assure support for the Mini-14's operating elements.

Trigger  pull characteristics on all military rifles leave a lot to be
desired. The safety aspects of two stage pulls need not be sacrificed,
but a properly regulated trigger job can produce a 4 to  4  1/2  pound
letoff that will do more to reduce the effect of the human factor than
anything else, with the exception of a better sight system.

The coarse-adjusted military sight on the factory Mini-14 is suited to
the  original  design  objectives of the rifle. It is okay for a rifle
designed to shoot  3  to  4-inch  groups.  But,  adjustment  stops  and
aperture  design  limit it for more demanding shooting. Millett Sights
(16131 Gothard Street, Dept. GA, Huntington Beach,  California  92647)
understands  the  needs  of  more demanding Mini-14 shooters, and have
adopted their Series 100 Sight to the Mini-14 and  other  assault-type
rifles.  The  result is a first-rate replacement peep sight that meets
the needs for realizing the performance potential of the Mini-14.

Positive, 1/3-minute click-adjustments on the Millett sight allow  for
both  windage  and elevation. A large match-style eyepiece shields the
eye  from  glare.  The  standard  .080-inch  aperature  (.050-inch  is
optional) provides a crisp, clean sight picture; the aperature hole is
reverse  tapered,  like  top-grade match sights, so no "tunnel effect"
distort aperture edges. The Millett sight base fits directly into  the
Mini-14  receiver and is secured by a single throughpin-a simple, easy
installation once the factory sight is removed. The installation makes
a handsome complement to the Mini-14 receiver.

The factory Mini-14 front sight blade is  an  exposed,  serrated  ramp
with  a  slightly  tapered  silhouette.  There  are  several  possible
replacements available for this front sight  unit.  The  Choate  front
sight  and  flash  hider  unit makes a good replacement choice and was
installed on our  conversion.  The  Choate  front  sight  blade  is  a
military  post  with "ears". The flash hider is of the bird cage type,
and is solid on the bottom, providing muzzle stability during firing.

A  well-bedded  stock  adds  to stiffness and support of the operating
elements. While new Mini-14's may  fit  well,  continued  firing  will
loosen  up  the  stock  and  receiver union. By using a non- shrinking
stock bedding compound such as Accraglas glas,  support  for  receiver
legs,  the  operating  rod  guide channel and the stock ferrule can be
reinforced. Dismantling the stock allows removal of the stamped  sheet
metal  recoil  stop  that  fits inside the receiver magazine opening A
thin coat of bedding compound under these supporting  structures  adds
to  the  stiffness  of the midsection of the stock and assures minimal
creep of the recoil stops. After treating  metal  parts  with  parting
compound, lightly apply epoxy to the wood then replace the recoil stop
in  the  stock  and  tighten  the  side  screws.  Let  this piece cure
overnight.

Next, remove the stock ferrule and the sheet metal action slide guide.
Butter  the  stock seating area for these parts and replace the metal.
Again, be  sure  to  coat  the  metal  with  parting  compound  before
contacting the bedding compound.

Using  silicone  parting  agent,  spray the inside surfaces of the gas
piston collar assembly and butter  the  outer  surface  of  the  stock
ferrule  with  compound. At the same time, spray the receiver legs and
bottom of the receiver with parting agent.  Butter  the  receiver  leg
channels  in  the stock to fill in the area below, in front and to the
sides of the receiver legs where they seat in the stock. Assemble  the
barrel/receiver  group  in the stock using a large rubber band to hold
the stock and receiver together. Let this work  cure  overnight  after
wiping  off  any  excess  bedding compound that oozes out of joints. A
little oozing shows a proper amount of compound; don't overapply,  but
use  enough  to  fill  all the voids. Failure to use parting agent can
result in embarrassment. You might permanently bond the stock and  the
receiver together!

Separate  the stock the next day, then carefully chisel out any excess
ridges on the inside of the stock. Small bubbles in the  work  may  be
refilled.  Reassemble  the  stock  and  insert  and secure the trigger
assembly. Observe any looseness of  the  trigger  assembly.  This  may
require  additional  bedding  under the flat contact pad on the bottom
outside edge near the middle of the receiver.

Use parting agent on the receiver bottom, then apply bedding  compound
on  the  stock  surfaces  adjacent to the receiver pad. Reassemble the
rifle, insert the trigger group, but close the trigger guard down only
to about 1/2 inch away from its hooking point.  Let  the  epoxy  cure,
then  clamp the triggerguard shut. This technique assured a very solid
stock-to-barrel/receiver  fit,  necessary   for   consistent   shooting
accuracy.

Trigger  work  calls  for smoothing burrs and surface roughness off of
sear/hammerhook engagement surfaces.  First  disassemble  the  trigger
group  and  arrange the parts so hard stoning of the contact areas can
be done without altering engagement angles. Dressing  hammerhooks  and
sear  surfaces  amounts  to  a  few deft strokes only. As a rule, when
people  feel  they  have  done  enough,  too  much  stoning  has  been
accomplished.  Overstoning  will  reduce trigger pull letoff weight to
below 3  1/2  pounds,  making  trigger  release  unpredictable  in  an
autoloading  rifle.  Too light a pull can cause the gun to "double" or
"triple" due to the rocking motion of recoil and return-to-battery  of
the  enertia slide. A 4 to 4 1/2 pound pull is ideal with little or no
sensation of cheep. The classic two-stage military pull characteristic
should definitely be maintained.

A word of  warning  is  in  order  here.  Trigger  adjustments  demand
experience  and  a definite "feel" for the job. A poor trigger job can
ruin an otherwise good rifle. It is possible to make the piece  unsafe
if  the  adjustment  is botched. Amateurs who may do other gunsmithing
perfectly well may have no particular  skill  at  trigger  adjustment.
Unless  individuals  are experienced at regulating a trigger pull, the
job is best done by a trusted professional.  The  rewards  of  a  well
regulated  trigger  are  essential  for  rifle  accuracy, so take your
Mini-14 trigger group to a competent local gunsmith or  put  it  in  a
padded  mailing  envelope along with a check or money order for $35.00
and send it to: Poway Gun Works, 13168 Poway  Road,  Dept  GA,  Poway,
California 92064 to have it done right.

Field  testing  comes  after the bedding, trigger regulation and sight
installation. The test rifle was first fired with  some  surplus  Lake
City Arsenal '67 vintage ammunition. Center zero was established at 25
yards  with  intermediate  (50 yards) firing and later 100-yard groups
fired off the bench. Shooting was done  in  early  morning  with  very
little of no crosswind.

Our early groups  were  erratic  and  disappointing,  but,  as  firing
continued,  the rifle settled into its bedding and groups converged on
zero. Early cold-barrel groups were respectable in the 2-3 inch  size.
But  groups  "walked"  with a vertical string as the barrel heated up.
Once the bedding was seated and the gun  heated  uniformly,  the  best
groups appeared.

After things settled down and became consistent, a switch to Remington
.223 commercial ammunition produced groups up to the full potential of
the gun. The best six-round group measured 1.6 inches at 100 yards. It
would  be  good  to  try  Winchester  and  Federal  Commercial loads in
individual guns to observe the  result.  None  of  these  brands  were
available  on  our  test day, however. Nobody can complain about 1 1/2
minutes of angle with a Mini-14!

The Choate front sight is investment cast and the top post corners are
very slightly rounded. Flat filing  squares  up  the  post.  Millett's
sight  base  with  the  Choate  post  combination  made  the gun shoot
high-about 12 inches high at 100 yards.  Millett  has  since  modified
their base to correct for this.

Bedding effects are intrinsic to such good groups. But the trigger job
and  crisp,  effective  Millett  sights  were  appreciated  as  aids to
practical accuracy. Shooter confidence imparted  by  this  tuning  was
evident shortly after firing began.

Custom handloads would probably shrink groups further, but the effects
would not necessarily contribute as much as if the loads were fired in
a bolt-action rifle. The need for cannelured bullets and crimping with
self-loading   ammunition,  along  with  loose  chamber  dimensions  of
self-loader, limits  accuracy  contributions  of  carefully  assembled
custom loads in the Mini-14.

So, there it is! An attainable project for the Mini-14 owner who wants
to  get the most out of his rifle. For just a couple of evenings' time
and the price of materials,  you  can  upgrade  the  rifle's  handling
characteristics as well as accuracy and performance. And, for riflemen
who  care, there is the self-satisfaction of having made their Mini-14
perform.
