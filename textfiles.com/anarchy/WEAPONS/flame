<><><>HOW TO BUILD A FLAMETHROWER<><><>

ITEMS YOU WILL NEED:
1 SQURIT BOTTLE LIKE THE WINDEX BOTTLE
2 COAT HANGER
3 CARDBOARD
4 FLAMMABLE LIQUID

BUILDING IT:

TAKE THE TOP OFF THE SQUIRT BOTTLE. FILL
IT WITH THE FLAMMABLE LIQUID. (WE USED
CHARCOAL LIGHTER.) I WOULDN'T FILL IT
ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP IN CASE THERE
IS AN ACCIDENT. (KA-BOOM!) 
CUT ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF OF COAT
HANGER AND BEND ONE END AROUND THE NECK
OF THE BOTTLE TIGHTLY. BEND ABOUT AN
INCH OF THE OTHER END VERTICALY. THE
WIRE SHOULD BE HORIZONTAL FOR ABOUT A
FOOT+ A LITTLE. ROLL UP A LITTLE PIECE
OF CARDBOARD AND RAP IT WITH LOTSA 
TAPE OF SOME KIND. HERE IS HOW IT SHOULD LOOK:

                   '      '
                   ''''''''

STICK THE TAPE-WRAPED CARDBOARD OVER
THE VERTICAL PART OF THE WIRE.

SHOOTING FLAMES:

SQUIRT SOME FLAMMABLE LIQUID WITH
THE SQUIRTER ONTO THE TAPE-WRAPED
CARDBOARD (WITCH SHOULD BE ON THE END
OF THE WIRE)
LIGHT THE FALAMMABLE LIQUID AND TAPE
WRAPED CARDBOARD. (OPPS, DON'T LIGHT
THE LIQUID!!! LIGHT THE CARDBOARD
THAT IS SOAKED WITH LIQUID!!)
