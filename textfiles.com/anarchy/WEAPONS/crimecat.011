                    Fireworks, Explosives & Demolitions

Prospectors, civil engineers, farmers, loggers and other workers may have
occasions to want to make their own explosives. Dynamite is the usual
ingredient but it may be hard to come by in remote areas, or to keep safely
on hand in hot weather and for indefinite time periods. The books in this
chapter teach you how to make your own explosives by using simple household
chemicals, and keep the ingredients in safe, separate containers until you
need them.

Instead of repeating the phrase "for information purposes only" on each
book and video listed in this catalog, ALL books and videos in this
Crimefighters' Catalog are FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.

BEFORE you blast off, check with local law enforcement agents if fireworks
and explosives are permitted in your area, and what you need to do to avoid
legal problems if you make them and use them.

RAGNAR'S GUIDE TO HOME AND RECREATIONAL USE OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES, By Ragnar
Benson.
Who else but uncle Ragnar could write this down-home guide? Ice fishing
with dynamite, blowing stumps, mixing up sugar chlorate powder - the Benson
family was never the same after Ragnar discovered the fun to be had with
high explosives.

It's not all fun and games, though. Benson details techniques, materials,
hazards and safeguards, drawing on his many years of experience on the farm
and as a consultant all over the world. How to obtain commercial high
explosives, safely storing and transporting them, detonation techniques,
improvised explosives and more are woven in with the tales of Ragnar's
outrageous adventures.

These techniques are still incredibly useful today. With them, a single
individual can easily dig a dry well, redirect creeks, blow up bad guys and
perform a host of otherwise impossible chores of immense benefit to
mankind. 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, illust. 120 pp, $12 (RAG)(731)


EXPLOSIVE PRINCIPLES - An Essential Guide to Understanding Explosives and
Detonations. By Robert A. Sickler.

is a readable, easy-to-understand primer on the nature of detonations, as
well as a concise look at the basic but often overlooked techniques that
professionals use to maximize the performance of primary and secondary
explosives to get any job done right. The author uses clear illustrations
and nontechnical words to explain the importance of detonation, velocity
and strength, brilliance, sensitivity, flammability, water resistance,
charge shape and more. Also covered are the optimum methods for initiating
particular primary explosives, the best primary explosives to set off
specific secondary explosives and much more.

HOMEMADE C-4, A Closer Look
C-4 is by far the most desirable explosive, as those who've read Ragnar
Benson's best-selling book HOMEMADE C-4: A RECIPE FOR SURVIVAL know. More
powerful than dynamite or TNT, and used in frag grenades, claymore mines
and other weapons, C-4 quickly penetrates steel or armor, yet is extremely
stable - more so than dynamite!

Making improvised C-4 requires only three common, relatively inexpensive,
legal ingredients, and no special tools, equipment or training. This video
takes you step-by-step through everything you need to know to assemble,
prepare and use improvised C-4 at home. As you'll see live footage of C-4
blowing up cars and steel plate you can judge for yourself its awesome
explosive power. VHS, color, about 25 minutes, $25  (C4V)(977)
