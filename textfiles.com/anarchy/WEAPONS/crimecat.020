If you're like most adult American consumers, you have at least one

life and financial standing and then profit from retaining as much negative
data as possible, who may request a copy of your credit report and for what
specific reasons, what your rights are under the Fair Credit Reporting Act
- explained in plain language - and cases where the bureaus have violated
it, and finally, how you can take legal action on grounds of defamation,
invasion or privacy or neglect.

financial consultants, this book will save you thousands of dollars and
