INTERROGATION - Techniques of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
The job of the police interrogator is inherently difficult. How does he
pave the way for the suspect to confess his crime while keeping within the
confines of the law? Or, still more compelling, how does he circumvent the
law when legal methods have driven him into a brick wall? This manual, used
by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to train its own interrogators,
details the insidious methods by which the "mounties" secure evidence after
all fair, legal and aboveboard tactics have been exhausted.

The contents of this book may offend you and they may shock you, but they
will certainly impress you. While stopping short of physical violence,
these tricks and the mental anguish they are designed to inflict are based
on nothing less than the brainwashing techniques championed and mastered by
the Chinese Communists and the Soviets. This is must reading for every
American police officer, as well as for every citizen who might one day,
innocent or guilty, sit across the table from a police interrogator.

DON'T BUG ME - The Latest High-Tech Spy Methods, by M.L. Shannon.
The author of this book believes that everyone in America has the right to
be left alone by government, business and others who can - and sometimes do
- listen or observe everything you and your family say or do in your home,
office or car. But there are some who don't respect your right to privacy,
and they DON'T want you to have the information in this book!

Law enforcement agents are required to obtain wiretap warrants but in
actual practice some frustrated cops are tempted to "bend" the rules to
nail slippery lawbreakers. While that's understandable, it's still illegal.
But what's more important to INNOCENT parties is, there are others who
aren't law enforcement agents who have a insidious criminal intent in
eavesdropping on private and business conversations - for blackmail,
industrial spying, and credit card fraud - to name a few. These are the
jokers everyone needs to be aware of, and should learn HOW to protect
themselves and their businesses.

dropping and from the surveillance and countersurveillance experts who prey
on innocent citizens who don't have this insider knowledge!  This
comprehensive study discusses every kind of spying device, from inexpensive
transmitters often hidden in potted plants, lamps and stereos to super-
sophisticated systems favored by governments or big business. It includes
the latest technology that allows the watchers to spy on you from your TV,

devices.  8.5 X 11, softcover, photos, illustr. 152 pp, $20 (DONT)(1017)

Basic to the CIA agent's mission is the ever-present threat of discovery
and apprehension. In such an emergency, he must have a tool, weapon, or
gadget with which to evade arrest or effect an escape. Over the more than
30 years that the CIA has been operating abroad, it has developed an
intriguing collection of specialized devices designed to go undetected by
airport scanners as well as pass the careful scrutiny of enemy searches.

Now, John Minnery, author of the infamous "How to Kill" series, provides an
exclusive inside look at a sampling of the actual Escape and Evasion
devices CIA has offered in its official E&E catalog over the years. The
information contained herein is considered so classified that CIA adamantly
denies the very existence of some of these clandestine guns, saws, knives,
daggers and chemical weapons. Yet the documented facts say otherwise.

The contents of this book will mystify, stun and ultimately amaze you. Most
importantly, the devices described will give you insight into the lives of

EXPERT BODY LANGUAGE The Science of People Reading, with Lee Lapin.
Can you tell if a person is being sincere simply by the way he or she
stands of sits? Or if someone is approachable by the signals his/her
unconscious movements are providing? Suppose you could use someone else's
thought process to make an important point or convince him/her that you
idea is/was best? Imagine how that could change (or save!) your life from
mistakes you might make, or opportunities lost, in the future.

This video is a step-by-step guide that gives you the advantage in any
social, business or law enforcement interview situation. By reading a
person's facial expressions, verbal clues and body reactions, you WILL be
able to judge that person's stress levels and other psychological signs and
tell if he or she is being truthful or deceitful. This video reveals the
vital points of the "lie detection" courses taught to the FBI, IRS and
other agencies and then goes a step further, showing how to employ these
techniques to actually manipulate a person's thinking process!

You can buy a stress analyzer machine that has red and green lights to
indicate the stress level of a person when answering certain key questions.
A polygraph machine does pretty much the same thing. The drawback is, the
equipment is expensive and difficult to conceal. What you learn from this
video course, provides almost the same thing - except you can carry it
around with you ANYWHERE without the other person being aware that you can
READ him or her just like they were "wired" to a polygraph machine!
