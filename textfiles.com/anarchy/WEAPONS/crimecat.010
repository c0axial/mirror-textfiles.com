WARNING! Be advised you MUST obtain a permit from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) to own and use full-auto weapons, silencers and
restricted weapons, and in some states, to make and use explosives and/or
explosive devices. BATF requires a separate licensing application. BATF
guidelines are included in some books that show how to convert or make
restricted weapons - when BATF regulations apply.

Some of the devices may or may not require BATF licensing. If not, the
author usually mentions that fact. If the author fails to mention it, be
warned that it might be illegal if you don't have a permit for it! Please
check BATF guidelines before you make any explosive devices, full auto, or
restricted weapons. Also, be sure to check your own state laws for their
prohibitions or licensing requirements.

Just because the information is legally available in books by virtue of the
First Amendment (Freedom of the Press) doesn't mean it's legal to do it,
make it, or use it!  Publishers of such books usually mention in each
book's description they are for HISTORICAL AND/OR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY.
That lets them off the hook. You're on your own if you violate any laws!

THE GATLING GUN - 19th Century Machine Gun to 21st Century Vulcan,
by Joseph Berk.
When it was introduced in 1862, the Gatling gun was so far ahead of its
time the U.S. military didn't even know how to make use of such a powerful,
high-rate-of-fire, multibarrel gun. But today, more than 130 years later,
the Gatling is still a force to be reckoned with. After being declared
obsolete in 1911, it staged an impressive comeback as the Vulcan in the
1950's, terrified the Vietcong in the jungles of Vietnam and contributed to
the swift defeat of Iraqi troops in the liberation of Kuwait. With modern
applications ranging from air defense to saturation fire to antitank gun
systems and even portable infantry weapons, it will no doubt play a vital
military role well into the 21st century. Here is the fascinating ongoing
story of a truly timeless weapon, from its beginning during the Civil War
to its current role as a state-of-the-art modern combat weapon.

COMBAT AMMO OF THE 21ST CENTURY, By Duncan Long
There has been a tremendous amount of advancement and change in the field
of ammunitions for combat, personal defense and law enforcement since the
publication of Duncan Long's classic, COMBAT AMMUNITION: EVERYTHING YOU
NEED TO KNOW. Now, the same author presents his exhaustive evaluation of
the stopping power of modern rifle, pistol, shotgun and machinegun rounds
based on actual case studies of shooting incidents. He looks at the hot new
cartridges that promise to dominate well into the next century - .40 S&W,
10mm Auto, subsonic 9mms - as well as the trusted standbys. Find out how to
make your own exotic tracers, flechette and sabot rounds, caseless ammo and
fragmenting bullets. This is an indispensable guide for anyone who may find
himself in a deadly situation in the streets, on the battlefield or in the
home.  8.5 X 11, softcover, photos, illust. 216 pp, $30 (COMBAT)(968)

(Editor's note: Using tracer ammo helps improve your instinct-shooting
skills. You can WATCH the bullet fly to the target. You'll SEE whether
you're shooting too high or too low. That will help you to develop
automatic aim adjustment for trajectory at different distances. Tracer
bullets aren't usually available at sporting goods stores. They are
available from a few mail-order firms specializing in "trick" ammo - but at
a premium price. With the info in this book, you can make your own exotic
ammo, and save money too.)

HEAVY FIREPOWER - Turning Junk into Arsenal Weaponry, by Ryan K. Kephart
Heavy firepower. The mere words conjure up visions of a concentrated
barrage of explosive weaponry. Yet such destructive firepower need not come
from crew-manned military ordnance unavailable to civilians. In fact, with
the simplest of tools and common items found around the house or on a junk
heap, a wide variety of devastating weapons can be constructed for
defensive purposes.

This book features more than 20 extremely simple plans for devising bombs,
mines, grenades and even a shotgun mortar that can be used in a guerrilla
warfare situation or during other desperate times. From such ordinary items
as bottles, mousetraps, light bulbs, pipe, gravel and extension cord, a
determined defender can amass a fearsome array of antipersonnel and
antivehicle munitions that can be arranged in a most cunning and deadly
defense perimeter. Simple formulas for sugar- and fertilizer-based
explosives and improvised napalm are provided.

In terms of personal security, you are most vulnerable to danger while

to its axles with a bevy of wicked surprises good for any self-defense
emergency on the road.

The clear, concise plans in this book range from diversionary and harassing
- blinding lights, smoke screens and tire busters - to more serious self-
defense: mines deployed from your moving car, oil slicks laid out to send a
pursuer careening off the road and firearms fired remotely from an internal
control panel. You can also learn how to rig a seat belt to electrically
shock a hostile passenger, modify a truck lock so it can be opened from the
inside, and build eight more destructive devices guaranteed to take the
drive out of any vehicular assailant. All of the plans require only common
tools and the simplest of materials found in any workshop scrap pile.

Note: Due to the extreme danger of these weapons as well as laws forbidding
their construction, this book is intended for information purposes only!

MODERN WEAPONS CACHING, A Down-to-Earth Approach to Beating the Government
Gun Grab, by Ragnor Benson.
Never in America? Think again. In New Jersey, it has already happened. Like
something right out of Red Square, a law has passed requiring most owners
of semiautomatic weapons to give them up. The forces that would snatch away
our Second Amendment freedoms are gaining momentum, and the time to prepare
is now. Firearm owners must literally take their weapons underground - bury
them - or be prepared to have them confiscated. Ragnor Benson has spent
years refining weapons-caching strategy down to a science. Now, with the
need for such drastic measures looming ever larger on the horizon, he tells
you how to construct a foolproof cache guaranteed to weather the elements
for years, and where to place it in order to outwit the authorities and
beat their high-tech metal detectors. In the race against the firearms
roundup in the U.S., gun owners must follow Ragnor's example and look to
the future both with mistrust and a will to prevail.
