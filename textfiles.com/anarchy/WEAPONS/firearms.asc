   COMPARISONS BETWEEN CIVILIAN AND POLICE USE OF FIREARMS

article in the January 10, 1985 Wall Street Journal.)

     Percentage of privately owned handguns used in crime: .004%

     Number of times a year private handguns successfully used in
     defense: 645,000

     Percentage of times armed police have succeeded in wounding
     or driving off criminals: 68%

     Percentage of times armed private citizens have succeeded in
     wounding or driving off criminals: 83%

     Percentage persons shot by armed police who are innocent of
     a crime: 11%

     Percentage of persons shot by armed private citizens who are
     innocent of a crime: 2%

Now, let's look a Florida's crime rate.  We already know that
Florida concealed-carry-weapons licensees aren't a problem.  But
is there any other change in the Florida crime statistics
since they instituted their new carry law?

Not a dramatic or conclusive one, but the crime trend in Florida
is reversing.  Note the following:

Which shows that homicide, the most serious of the offenses,
has been in a downward trend in Florida during the period when
the number of private persons legally carrying firearms is
increasing.

HCI responded by charging that the homicide figures weren't
telling, because rape and assault were still rising.

Well, they aren't anymore.  The trend has started to reverse.

Now lets look at some NON-VIOLENT CRIMES from the same 1991
Annual Report:

 LARCENY                         UP      3.1%
 Pocket Picking                  UP      1.0%
 Shoplifting                     UP      4.8%

 Motor Vehicle Theft             UP      1.5%
 DRUGS: Sale Overall             UP      11.0%

 Marijuana sale                  UP      34.3

 FRAUD                          UP      0.7%
 Credit Card/ATM                 UP      16.2%
 Impersonation                   UP      9.0%
 Welfare                         UP      45.5%
 Wire (telephone fraud)          UP      87.5%


Crooks in Florida do seem to be avoiding occasions where they
might run into an armed citizen.  I would say that while it is
not conclusive, there is as much statistical weight at this
point to the proposition that increasing the number of firearms
being carried by the civilian population inhibits violent
crime, as there is to the statistical linkage between cigarette
smoking and heart disease or emphysema.

It is indisputable that the Florida concealed-carry firearms
law has not turned Florida into the Gunshine State, as HCI and
CBS News predicted in 1986.

It is indisputable that making ccw-licenses available to anyone
who wants one and can pass an ordinary background check showing
no criminal or psychological disqualification does not endanger
the public.

And it is getting statistically strong that increasing the
ability of the civilian population to carry firearms reverses
rising crime trends as well.


What can we conclude from all this?

1) Restricting firearms does not reduce the homicide rate.  Look at
Scotland and Washington D.C.

2) Proliferating firearms does not increase the homicide rate.  Look at
Switzerland, Israel, New Hampshire, and Vermont, and the concealed-
carry-weapons licensees in Florida.

3) Civilians carrying firearms are more safe and effective at deterring
crime than are professional police.

My bottom line is my tagline:

Gun Control=Victim Disarmament & Increases Violent Crime!
