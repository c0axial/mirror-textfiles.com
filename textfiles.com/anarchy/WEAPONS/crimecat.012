FISTS, WITS, AND A WICKED RIGHT, Surviving on the Wild Side of the Street,
by Marc "Animal" MacYoung.
One thing this author doesn't pretend to be is a traditionalist. As he puts
it in this companion to his other very popular books, "It's awareness, or
wits, and fists that will keep you safe out there, not some fancy Oriental
fighting form."

The author focuses on the fine points and brutal technicalities of blows
and targeting - not just how to hit but WHERE to hit. Because the fact is,
the key to winning a fight is not necessarily to hit faster, or even
harder, but to do damage to the other guy before he can do it to you. On
the flip side, once you know what hurts, you'll know how to protect your
most vulnerable areas with a little more gusto. These are the critical
facts that will keep you alive and intact on the wild side of the street.

POOL CUES, BEER BOTTLES, AND BASEBALL BATS, Animal's Guide to Improvised
Weapons for Self-Defense, by Marc "Animal" MacYoung.
Would you admit to getting your ass kicked with a hairbrush? Animal would,
because he knows it can happen. In fact, any tool that aids and abets
knocking someone into next week can be considered a weapon - not just the
lethal stuff like guns and knives. This book will broaden your definition
of what constitutes a weapon to include rope, beer bottles, pens, pool
cues, cats, tables and chairs, keys, gin and tonics and a whole lot more.

Your martial arts training is not likely to protect you from a guy coming
at you with a tire iron or baseball bat, so you'd better know how to wing
it with whatever's close at hand. Here, Animal tells you how the basic
categories of weapons look, feel and act so you can keep from getting
creamed when somebody tries to use any object, in any way, to waste you.
Equipped with a new understanding of "weapons" and how they work, you'll be
able to pick up damn near ANYTHING and use it to survive.

Streetfighter, and Ambusher, by Peyton Quinn.
As a bouncer in a biker bar, having been attacked by fists, boots, pool
cues and knives, Peyton Quinn has learned a thing or two about what goes
down in a REAL fight. As a black belt, he also learned that martial arts
training is useful, but is NO SUBSTITUTE FOR EXPERIENCE. Here is his unique
guide that can save your ass in places where the brawling is quick, dirty
and very violent.

the characteristics of a real fight (you might be surprised); and tips for
dealing with aggressive people and ambushes. He teaches two basic moves
that can be applied to almost every attack, effective counterstrikes that
he has used dozens of times to defeat larger opponents, and secrets of
grappling and escapes. Finally, he takes a critical and practical look at
the most popular martial arts in the U.S.A.

STREET LETHAL, Unarmed Urban Combat, by Sammy Franco.
To survive a real streetfight, forget about those fancy leaping kicks and
pre-planned responses that you learned in the dojo - they simply won't work
in a real-life encounter. STREET LETHAL confronts this problem by both
outlining the principles for a realistic self-defense system and taking a
controversial look at the current state of martial arts in America.

Sammy Franco argues that traditional martial arts are locked into ancient
styles and forms and have lost their effectiveness as modern combat
systems. In response to this, he has founded Contemporary Fighting Arts, a
hard-hitting system that goes to the heart of a STREETFIGHTING situation
and ends it quickly. This book is a thought-provoking manual on unarmed
combat that every serious martial artist should read.

KILLER INSTINCT, Unarmed Urban Combat for Street Survival, by Sammy Franco.
On the streets of America (and elsewhere) there is no bushido, the
honorable code of the ancient warrior. Today's serious martial artist must
be prepared to neutralize vicious animals by being totally unrestricted by
rigid rules of combat etiquette. The Marquis of Queensbury rules are for
the ring, not in back alleys. Ditto for traditional martial arts taught for
tournaments: they need to be modified for streetfighters.

The author's attitude and concept of being street lethal is, when success
and failure can mean the difference between life and death, traditional
tools, stances, techniques and training methods must be MODIFIED to conform
to reality. In this book, Franco describes the mental, spiritual and
physical components of Contemporary Fighting Arts. This advanced system of
unarmed combat teaches you a brutal, efficient arsenal of techniques from a
variety of fighting forms. It equips you with the animal instinct necessary
to survive in a nation where drug wars, brutal homicides, assaults and rape
are tragic realities of everyday life.
