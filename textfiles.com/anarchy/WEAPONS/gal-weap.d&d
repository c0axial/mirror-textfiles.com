-------------------------THE SCROLL OF EXPLOSIONS------------------------

<< From:  layten@UWYO.BITNET )>>

Duration: 2 or 4 rounds depending on version (see below)
Damage:  2 or 4 round  5megaton explosion (5d100) 10megaton (10d100)
         the damage is taken from the force of the explosion and from
         the flying debris. No damage is actually taken from the blast.

     This scroll was created by Yorthin. the Chaotic Neutral magic user.
After he was unable to go into a town with a metal door.  After using all
of the 'conventional' means of blowing up the door he came up with this scroll
which takes either 2 or 4 rounds to read.  After he read the 2 round version,
he was so impressed that he created an even more powerful version (the 4
round) which created a 10 megaton explosion, instead of only 5 of the
previous version.
      The use of this scroll is not recommended for anybody except that
of the Chaotic Neutral alignment.  To give you an example, all that was left
of the town was a crater.
      The usefullness of this scroll is evident when you are in a no win
situation (like when you are fighting say, 50 storm giants) or are unable
to storm a town or castle because of the defenses, simply read the scroll
and *BOOM* no more castle.  The explosion is focused approx 300ft. away from
the caster, who is not affected by the explosion, (his companions must save
vs. dex or roll damage from being thrown 30-50 ft, or from flying debris.)
Needless to say this scroll isn't popular.

---------------------------THE SHILLELAGH SCROLL------------------------

<< From:  SNURK!ROOT@VAX.CS.PITT.EDU >>

This scroll, usable only by priests, when read will instantly transform itself
into a staff (+1/+1d6), which can also receive up to 5 more shillelagh spells.
These spells will make it +6/+5d6-4.  The spells must be cast in successive
rounds, and last as long as the final spell.  When that expires, the staff
turns back into an ordinary scroll.
The scroll saves at +1 vs fire, etc..
a "Dispel Magic" will turn the staff back to a scroll, and will be unusable
for 1d4 turns.

DM's call as to how many times this can be used.. 1, 1d20, unlimited..

---------------------------------BEADS OF ARACHNIDA-----------------------------

<< From:   DAVID@FRODO.WES.ARMY.MIL >>

Occurrence: 4-10 found at a time (2d4+2) 1"diameter
Monetary Value: 50gp and 100xp
Duration: 1 turn + 1d8 rounds

When thrown at a hard surface (cave floor, tree, rocky slope, knight in shining
armor, etc.) the bead explodes to produce a sheet of extremely thick webbing.
It expands and attempts to attach itself to the two nearest supports, which
may be up to 50' apart.  The web will cease expanding when it reaches 200 sq.
ft. in area, or less, depending on the circumstances (in a 10'x10' corrider,
the web will be only 100 sq. ft.).  If the supports are too far apart, the web
will collapse and disappear in 5 segments.  Creatures of 19 strength or less
which are caught by the web are held completely immobile.  A strength of 20 or
greater allows a saving throw vs. Spell, with success indicating the creature
has pulled free and can act normally on the following round.  Captives may use
only those items which are currently in hand.  The web can not be harmed by
normal weapons, but magical ones can cut through it in 3 rounds minus a number
of segments equal to the maximum plus of the weapon (i.e. a +1/+4 sword can
cut through in 2 rounds and 6 segments).  Magical fires, including a Flame
Tongue sword, destroy the web in 1 round; normal fire has no effect.  Creatures
which have spider-like abilities are not held by the web, although movement
across it is at 1/2 speed.                                               +
                                                                        --------
-----------------------------ELEMENTAL WEAPONS--------------------------

<< From:  RK8361A@DRAKE.BITNET >>

6 different groups of weapons and armor each bearing the powers of the planes
of:    Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Negative Material, and positive material.

Each weapon is highly coveted and creates desire to own it unless a save vs
spells is made.

*FIRE*

   Bow of Fire (long bow):
       +4 bow
       Absorbs 1 point of every die of damage owner takes due to fire
       +2 on saves vs fire.
       1 point of damage per die on cold attacks in addition to normal.
       -2 save penalty versus cold attacks.
       Changes normal arrows into arrows of flame that are similar to
       phosphorus:
            1st melee round:  2-16 points of fire damage
            2nd and 3rd:      1-10 points of fire damage
            4th and 5th:      1-6  points of fire damage
            6th +             1-3  points of fire damage
       *note* Armor will reduce the damage equal to its AC adjustment -1
              per melee round passed.
         for example:  a character wearing plate armor and shield takes
            0-9 points of fire damage in the first melee round
               (2-16 minus (8 for AC adjustment -1 for first melee round))
               (2-16 minus 7 = 0-9)
            1-4 points in the second
               (1-10 minus (8 for AC -2 for second melee round))
            ETC.
       Fire can only be extinguished by magic or by suffocating it
       (difficult to do)  and after being extinguished particles will
       re flame up.  Each arrow has a duration of 20 rounds before
       burning itself out.

       Increases relations with fire using creatures by 8%
       Causes fear in cold using creatures unless save versus spell
       Damage versus cold using creatures is twice normal

       Creates callouses on the hands of the user unless asbestos like
       gloves are used, usually found with the bow. Magical in nature to
       shrink or grow to fit.
       Causes owner to feel cold unless in warmer than usual areas
       Owner feels Very Cold if more than 20 feet from the bow.

   Sword of Fire (long sword):
       Same as bow except for arrow ability, all effects are cumulative.
       Can flame strike as a 30th level cleric similar to a cone of cold
       with the tip of the sword as it's base once per two days.

       Sword blade is so hot that it will melt metal (other than magical)
       Damage of 3-30 plus 1-4 per round for 4 melee rounds if wearing
          metal armor due to the melted metal.
       Save versus Constitution from extreme pain, if failed by more than
          5 points the player is paralysed for 2-8 melee rounds
          if the player doesn't save the player is at minus 4 to hit for
          next round.

   Armor of Fire (Banded):
       Armor class:  -1
       Causes all weapons that hit to be at -1 to hit and damage per hit
          unless magical, which then is -1 to hit and damage per 3 hits
       All characters (except wearer) must save versus breath weapon per
          hit or be blinded for 1 round from sparks and flaring.
       Same Effects as Bow, cumulative with all other fire items

   Shield of Fire (large):
       Armor class:   6 (-4 adjustment)
       Same as Armor of Fire except blinding
       fire an 8 dice fireball once per 2 days

  Potions lose their magical properties after 3 hours of being within 10
    feet of the item.
   Gems in 30 yards of all fire items decrease by half their value
    to power the item
   Each Item has an ego of 20 and an intelligence of 15 but will not try
    to control the player unless threatened with harm
   All effects are cumulative in all items, with the following effects:
       2 Fire items:
           Takes 1/2 damage from all fire hits
           Takes 1.5x damage from all ice hits
           Can summon 3 fire creatures of 4 hit dice at 30% once per week
           Can travel to the elemental plane of fire with no harm 1 time
            per week.
           Burn wood, melt ice, evaporate water in a 10' area
       3 Fire items:
           Immune to fire magical or not
           takes 2x normal damage from ice
           Can summon 12 hit dice of fire creatures 3 times per week
           Can travel to the elemental plane of fire after concentrating
            for 3 hours with up to 4 companions
           Can change the degree of heat on their body from normal to
            1000 degrees Fahrenheit at the loss of 1 hit point per melee
            round per 20 degrees
       All 4 magic items:
           Character becomes Equal to an Efreeti with same powers and
           Is Now a Fire saint:  All the magic Items meld with the player
           and become part of his being, increasing his intelligence by 4
           and giving him a major ego trip.  Player now has 2 equally
           strong opinions on everything, Schizophrenia in other words.
           player can cast gate spell to plane of fire at will 4 turns
           delay.
           Can Increase heat as 3 items at the loss of 1 hit point per 50
            degrees
           All Ice spells have a 20% chance of failing in addition to save
            but do 5 times normal damage.

Air Earth Water Negative material and positive material coming if asked
for. Remember to use VERY sparingly, Artifacts aren't found every day.

SWORDS:
=======
--------------------------THE CRYSTAL SWORD-------------------------------------

<< From:  DOUGHDE@RCN.BITNET >>

To hit/damage adjustment: +2 or +3
Special abilities: Language translation (see below)

A broad or bastard sword made out of a large single peice of quartz
crystal.  Magic makes it the same weight and hardness of a regular 2-
handed sword and provides it's special ability which is not obvious or
always known). When held so the user can see through the blade, it tran-
slates any written language into any other of the DM's choice, usally
common, dwarvish or elvish. Can be used 3-5 times a day, and each charge
lasts for ten minutes. Note: It can only be activated on command! It
thus has a limited intelligence that only pretains to translation (which
may not always be precise).  The sword must (obviously) be clean to be
useful for this purpose. The work to be translated must be clearly
visible and of a sensible language.

Possible option: only allow it to translate rom one specific language to
                 another.

-----------------------------WERE-BLADE-----------------------------------------

<< From:  JESTER@GACVAX1.BITNET >>

     The Were-blade is a doppleganger of swords, a shape-changer.
Usually, it looks to be an ordinary, but magic-radiating, dueling
sabre.  In combat against another sword, even two-handed, it takes
on the qualities and special abilities of the opponent's sword (unless,
of course, the other sword is crappy and breaks; the Were-blade saves as
a magical sword.).  Against more than one sword, the Were-blade
takes on the qualities of the most powerful one.
     The original Were-blade was made for a Duelist by the name of
Geeves, in Cormyr of the Forgotten Realms (In my campaign).  In following
my interpretation of the Duelist class and its "honor," I designed the
Were-blade to reflect the Duelist's desire to win a fight by skill and
not by magical advantage.  The Duelist usually has enough proficiencies
to handle all the swords into which the Were-blade might change.  The
Were-blade has limited telepathy, enough to let its user know what
abilities it has taken on in each combat (i.e. whether that
opponent's sword can cast a fireball once a week, and, therefore,
so can the Were-blade, for that combat).
     This weapon may suck for any character going up against a creature
which needs a +2 weapon to hit it but is attacking the character with
a regular long-sword...

-----------------------------THE SWORD SNAKE----------------------------

<< From:  AAW254@URIACC.BITNET >>

# Appearing               1
AC                        -2
HD                        1-6 (varies)

Special Attacks           Poison
Special Defenses          Immune to sleep/charm/cold spells

Size                      Short to Two-Handed
XP                        YOU DECIDE!!!!

The sword snakes were first invented by an ecentric wizard thet got confused wh
ile trying to enchant an item. The result was the sword snakes.  The sword snak
es have three different levels of growth.  At 1-2 HD the sword snake appears as
 a short sword.  It's poison is very weak save at +2 or you skin begins to hard
en until it becomes metalic (1-4 Hrs. and then death).  At 3-4 HD the sword sna
ke appears as a long sword and its poison is capable of killing in 1-2 hrs. sav
e applicable. AT 5-6 Hd the sword snake appears as a two handed sword and it's
poison is capable of killing in 1 hr. save at -2.  The poison also has one othe
r possible effect, If the charecter saves, there is a slim chance 5% that the c
harecters skin will harden anyway, but the charecter wil not die, instead the s
kin will become natural and give the person a natural ac. of -2.
      Also due to the nature of the sword snake if its alignment matches that o
f the person picking it up, the sword will not attack and instead will function
 as a +4 weapon of the appropriate type.  The snake will also defend it's owner
 and has a telepathic link with him/her.  The snake is capable of detecting dan
ger in a 30' radius.  If the weiders alignment changes, or if the snake when fo
und decides that it would be suicidal to attack than the snake will wait until
an opportun moment (when the party is sleeping) to slither off, or if it is in
it's alignment it might crawl all over the sleeping adventurers cutting them to
 ribbons.
     The sword snake looks like a normal sword, except it's hilt is made of gol
d and the pommel looks like a snakes head ready to strike,they always have some
 sort of gemstone for eyes and their blades are always razor sharp.
A heat metal or any type of spell like that (if it works) will kill a sword sna
ke.

***History of Origin***

	Several thousands of years ago, a city named Palaodrin existed center of the
 Prime Material Plane.  It was inhabited by being of lawful neutral, neutral,
 and chaotic neutral alignments only.  And these beings fought for the
purpose of Neutrality, ie. to maintain the balance between good and evil.
Although their work was done subtlely and secretly behind the walls of Palaodrin
, it was sometimes necessary for the citizens to take up arms.  Many of the
inhabitants were poor warriors, and the citizens themselves were few in number.
So it was that they recognized the need for a weapon of great power as their
defense.  Since good beings tended to recognize a form or law of balance, the
citizens decided that it would be best to make the sword more powerful against
evil than good.  For centuries and millennia, Palaodrin stood as an island
amidst the struggle for power, and the Sword, as well as other relics they
created, defended the city against all invaders.  But when news spread, some of
the good beings wondered if such power was evil.  The forces of evil saw this
doubt spreading its way through the forces of good and took advantage of it.
Through trickery and deceit, evil was able to join good in a combined crusade
against their common enemy.  But, while Good hoped to destroy the power of
Palaodrin, Evil sought to gain it.  The city was overwhelmed by the combined
forces, unable to defend against both Good and Evil at the same time.  Palaodrin
fell.  During the fighting, Mephistopheles searched for the sword which was not
a difficult task.  With its power he could overthrow Asmodeus and defeat Good,
but when he went to take the sword, he found himself wounded and the Sword gone.
Although Good had thought the Sword had been destroyed, there have been those
who have felt that the Sword of Palaodrin used its power of teleportation to
escape both Good and Evil, and none have been able to find it since.

*Next, the Sword of Palaodrin is a little out of hand so here are my
suggestions to all you DMs:
1) The Sword must remain with both SLAY GOOD and SLAY EVIL.  This        will
   keeps its origin and goals intact.
2) Choose any two Special powers other than those mentioned
   above.  This also keeps any players reading this from knowing
   the whole story.
3) Remember the Sword has an ego of *21*.  Play it as such.
   It gets interesting when the two egotists clash.
4) Choose one ability from each ability, ie. detections,
   immunities, protection, and side effects.  I suggest that the
   personal attribute modifier be -1 permanently on the players
   Constitution.
                                                                        --------
--------------------------------DRAGONCLAW------------------------------

<< From:  AAW317@URIACC.BITNET >>

Magical adj: +4 (vorpal longsword)

Spells:  (1/day)

fireblast (12d6)
lightning bolt (")
chlorine blast (")
detect evil dragons (6")
detect gold/precious metals (ems 6")

Special abilities:

shoot blade (up to 10" range) +10 dam.
hilt acts like +4 club when blade is gone
There are 4 claws on the hilt. If, when used as a club, all 4 claws hit,
the claws will animate for 1-10 additoional damage and act as a dagger
of venom.
  The sword's special purpose is to slay evil dragons. When in combat
with an evil dragon, it does double damage. It also feels a kinship to
all good dragons.
   Dragonclaw is intelligent and has a personality much like a dragon's
(greed, etc.) The sword will demand a treasure horde to guard, etc...

---------------------------SWORDS OF THE MAGI-----------------------------------

<< From:  A_COPEAB@CCSVAX.SFASU.EDU >>

Occurrence:  2 each of long, broad, short, falchion, etc...
Magical adj.: +1 (normally and for illusionists) +2 for magi

When used by a mage (not an illusionist):

- acts as a +2 berserking sword but will NEVER hit an ally (however,
  it may hit a traitor...heh heh)
- lowers AC by 2
- doubles the hit points of the mage temporarily
- allows mage to attack as a fighter of equal level

Drawbacks:

- the sword's power only lasts 30 minutes, at the end of which the mage
  is very fatigued
- he is -2 to hit, 10% chance of spell failure, and is at 1/2 movement
  for the next hour.

It is light (magically) and can be weilded by even the weakest mage.

Note:  multi-class and illusionists use it as a +1 sword.

--------------------------------LIFEKEEPER--------------------------------------

<<  same  >>

+2 bastard sword
INT: 14
EGO: 10
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (VERY slight evil tendency)

- can detect secret doors within 5'
- detect traps within 10'
- can cast cure light wounds on owner 3times/day
- can fire 8 magic missles per day (360' range) (no more than 4 per
  volley.
- speaks demon, common, alignment, and 1 other language of the DM's
  choice


While the sword is chaotic neutral, it is fairly quiet, preferring to be
left alone. When it does speak, it tends to be brisk and to the point;
rarely tactful. The sword's slight evil tendency is perhaps inherited
from it's previous owner of several years, a cambion demon.

--------------------THE CRYSTAL BLADES (STORMBLADES)--------------------

<<  same  >>

Magical adj: +3 swords (There are nine)
Intelligence: 16
Ego: 16

                       Alignments:
4 longswords          Extremes (LG, CG, LE, CE)
2 broadswords         Neutral Good and Neutral Evil
2 shortswords         Lawful Neutral and Chaotic Neutral
1 2-handed sword      Neutral (Pure)

Magical abilities:

detect law/chaos (30' radius)
dispell magic (2/day)
lightning bolt (8 die; 1/day; 360'range)
invisibility (on weilder/sword; 3/day)
become ethereal (owner/gear affected; 1/day at will; no max.duration)
  note: no plusses lost as the swords go to other planes.
speaks 4 languages two of which are common&old common (DM chooses others
  but they may NOT be dragon, demon, devil, daemon, titan, etc...

   Each sword's blade is made of Glassteeled Adamite, hence the names.
In combat, the blade darkens to a misty black color (hence the other
StormBlades). Although the personality of each sword is different depend
ing on its preferred alignment (and each has its own unique name, as
well), the magical abilities of the swords are tha same.

------------------------------ELF SLAYERS-------------------------------

<<  same  >>

Magical adj: special (see explaination)
Intelligence: nil

Magical abilities:
hitting a full blooded faerie causes triple damage
hitting a partially faerie folk causes double damage
magic of armor created by faerie folk is nullified by swords
owner gains +5 save vs. magic regardless if it is unsheathed or not.
  (see other notes on magical resistance below...)

If the result of the saving throw is 20 or better, the spell has *no*
effect on the owner.  As a side note, beneficial spells must get past a
saving throw of 2 to effect the user (-1 per level of caste Also, no mag
ic items of any sort will funtion on the user as long as the sword is wi
thin a foot of him.

For the purposes of this sword, faerie races include:

elves, sylphs, dryads, nymphs, pixies brownies, atomies, quicklings, peu
do- and faerie-dragons, satyrs, sprites, leprechauns, etc. Basically,
any race that has some inherent magical ability or defense and would be
found in a sylvan setting (see DMG#1, encounter tables) is considered a
faerie race. Note that gnomes and halflings are excluded. A partial faer
ie race is any of the above combined with a non-faerie race (usually hum
an). Half-elves are the most common example.

The metal used in these swords is flat black, and is very difficul for tt
he Dwarven masters to forge. Other weapons made of this metal (called Zu
fluct by Dwarves, which today translates as 'elf slayer' although it ori
ginally meant 'kills wimpy scum') include spears and arrows. The arrows
do not affect saving throws or magic items, and the spears only give a +
1 to saves and save against beneficial spells on a 18 or better. If a fa
erie even touches this metal, he takes one point of damage per pound of
metal. Note that this could be misconstrued as ego damage. Most Elf Slay
er swords are broadswords.

----------------------------THE SWORD OF KAS----------------------------
(note: this is VERY long!!!)

<< From:  PFREY@DREW.BITNET >>

(Note: These powers should be kept secret by the Dm...see below)

Int:15 Ego:19 Al:CE
+6 defender
Telepathy (even when not held)
Double damage against all creatures which are from a plane other
than the Prime Material (but only normal damage when on any plane
other than the Prime Material)

Minor Powers:

Animate dead (1 figure--by touch)--7/week
Darkness (5', 10', or 15' radius)--3/day
Invisibility (improved)--3/day
Know alignment (when held)--1/day
Protection +2 (when held)

Major Powers:

Fire giant strength (St:22 +4/+10) (when held)
Regeneration 2hp/round (but not if killed.  Also, see below)

Primary Powers:

Slays opponent up to 15hd on an unadjusted 18 or higher (no save)
Total immunity from cold (when held)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
HINTS ON PLAY:
 *Until the user consciously accepts the sword by committing himself to
the ways of chaotic evil, the sword will not let the user ever know abou
t the following abilities:

+6 defender--tell him only that it is a +4 defender, but take the rest
  into consideration during combat.

Protection +2--simply take this into account when being struck

Slay opponent up to 15hd--simply tell them that they struck an incredibl
  blow and the opponent is slain.

Fire giant strength--simply take this into account when he   strikes an
  opponent.

Regeneration 2hp/round--
secretly accumulate the hit points regained si nce being damaged, up to
the amount of damage suffered.  When he get s damaged in the future, thi
s amount is subtracted, and he takes no damage (note: the quazit's regen
erative powers are conferred through the sword and Chris will gain addit
ional points used towards next wo und.  This healing also causes undead
flesh to appear around the wou nd).  Excess hit points are carried over
towards the next wound.  When an amount equal to the damage suffered is
reached, this total is stored as potential for the next wound.  Of cours
e, this assumes  that enough time will pass in order to regenerate. See
above for all details.

Double damage against creatures from other planes--
do not tell him this power.  Simply take it into account during combat w
ith such creatures.

Immunity from cold--
Whenever he is holding the blade, tell the character that he somehow did
not take damage from the cold (he was out of the area of effect, his arm
or protected him, etc.). When he does enter a cold environment, tell him
he does not feel cold whenever he holds the blade.  By that time, he may
have fallen prey to the sword.  Remember: he must be holding the sword t
o gain the benefits of this power.  If it is at his belt, it will not wo
rk.  This will force him to always carry the sword during cold adventure
s, thus preventing him from casting spells. But, since the sword always
seems to be working and spells not, then he will not mind this and alway
s attack with the sword when it advises him...

As a result, the sword will appear as the following:

+4 defender, telepathic, know alignment, and darkness of varying
radiuses.  Purpose: to fulfill the quest.  Gives extra experience
points.  Has powers to reward him with.
  It will not reveal its intelligence, ego, or alignment, as it
will tell the user that this is insulting to ask.  It will say,
indignantly, that it is exceptionally intelligent and very proud of
this fact (truth).  It will know telepathically the alignment of
the possessor and take it for its own alignment (lie!).
. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Side effects:

1. Yearning for item forces possessor to never be away from the
   item for more than 1 day if at all possible--tell the user that
   something terrible will happen if the sword is not kept with him
   at all times.  Examples: The powers of the sword will no longer
   function with him, it will be mad and jealous and hate him, it
   might be lost, another might take/steal it, etc.  Feed the
   possessor all sorts of ideas to cause him to be paranoid.

2. Item has power to affect its possessor when a Primary Power is
   used if the possessor has not followed the alignment or purposes
   of the artifact.  This is tricky.  If the character is not
   killing monsters or acting chaotic, it will threaten to take away
   its power (see also several paragraphs below).  If the character
   does not follow its "advice", the sword will also threaten.

3. The item is powerless against and hates most sylvan creatures and all
   rangers.  Sylvan creatures include: brownies, centaurs, chimeras,
   cockatrices, dryads, forrest elves (those in the party are high
   and grey elves, but make sure of what they are immediately!),
   griffons, harpies, hippogriffs, manticores, pagasi, perytons,
   pixies, satyrs, sprites, stags, sylphs, and unicorns.  Against
   these, NONE of its special powers will work.

If any of these creatures come within 100 feet/yards of the
sword, it will become a +10 short sword (note: not of defending)
and both its ego and intelligence will increase to 20.  It will
force the possessor to attack.
  In the above case, there is a 25% chance that the sword will
reveal itself for what it is.  If it does reveal itself, all
powers will become evident to the possessor, and if the sum of
its new ego, intelligence, and plus (+10) is greater than the sum
of the possessor's intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, it will
possess the user.  If the possessor's sum is greater, he gets a
saving throw versus magic with a +1 bonus for every point his sum
is above that of the sword (this is the only adjustment he gets).
If he fails, he becomes possessed.  If he succeeds, he gets the
option of casting it away or accepting it.  Accepting it results
in his possession.  A character possessed can only be saved by a
deity.  They are not likely to intervene, however.

4. This is the most deadly side effect of all.  6 turns after the
   sword is first used in combat, so as to throw off rightful
   suspicion, whenever the user takes damage, he will be adversely
   affected by the regenerative power of the item.

  The flesh around the wound will appear ghastly.  It will be pale
and very unattractive.  Hopefully, the party will attribute the
effect to the weapon or power of the creature attacking him.  The
flesh is actually undead flesh.
  When hit points equal to 5 times his amount have been
"regenerated", he will become an undead knight of the same level
of ability as his major profession.  He will be chaotic evil if
not already.  Until this point, the percentage that he has become
undead will become quite evident.  If divine information is
sought, the fact that it is undead flesh will be revealed, but
not the source of this change (the sword).
  Such change is permanent and cannot be reversed except through
the removal of  the sword.  If it is removed the effects will no
longer continue.  All new damage will be removed from this undead
flesh and healed as normal flesh.  Wish and other similar spells
can reverse the process.  A regenerate spell will cure the flesh
as if it was damage.
  As this disease progresses, there is a cumulative percentage that
he will become CE.  Each time an amount of hit points equal to
his original amount is regenerated, there is a 20% chance of him
becoming CE.  This is cumulative, so that by the time 4 times has
been reached, it is unlikely that he can resist.  As soon as he
becomes CE due to this effect, the undead disease instantly
creeps over his entire body.
  The possessor's charisma also temporarily suffers.  Until he
becomes CE, his charisma drops 3 points, until a charisma of 3 is
reached, for every time the hit points regenerated matches his
original amount.  When he becomes CE, his charisma instantly
becomes 19: the ego of the sword.
  Body odor also becomes a factor with this disease.  It is very
faint and smells of dead flesh.  Note: the possessor cannot be
turned until he has completely become undead.  He can then be
turned as a special monster.  He can turn good clerics at his
level of ability.

5. Another side effect of the sword is that it will cause all
   magic cast by the user against his opponent(s) to be ineffective.
   For example, a lighning bolt cast by the user will do no damage.
   A heal spell on a companion, as it is not being used against his
   enemies.  Also, other weapons that the possessor use will never
   hit.  These two effects are caused by the sword so as to become
   the only weapon he uses.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
DETAILS:
  The sword will select the most greedy and corruptable player to
possess.  The sword will allow its powers to be learned slowly.
Meanwhile, it will corrupt him and draw him to its alignment.
  When found, it appears as a short sword.  The party will not
likely ask what it looks like in detail, so do not give any
details.  If in the rare occasion that someone asks, be vague,
"It appears to be an ordinary short sword; it is thin and of a
dull gray metal.  It is very sharp."  It radiates a faint magic
if detected for.  It has an inscription on it: 'Abyss Slicer'."
The inscription was put there by Orcus and will fade when its
true nature is made known.
  The sword will feel cold and lifeless in the hands of any that do
not claim it as their own.  It will pulse with magic in the hand
of the one who does claim it.
  The sword will tell the user that it was sent by (his god) to
slice the Abyss, when in reality it is the slicer for the Abyss.
   The Sword of Kas will know of the party's quest both through Orcus
and through its telepathic abilities.  It will tell the one it possesses
that it found its way to him through (his god) and that he should keep
this secret no matter what!  He should not reveal the sword's special
purposes or abilities to anyone.  He should use the sword in battle and
consult with it whenever he can.
   Try not to arouse any suspicion whatsoever!  As soon as
it seems that the sword is pushing too hard, let off a little.
It will always defend its actions through the above explanation.
Orcus has planted this as a seed of destruction within the party;
he does not want his plans to come to an end prematurely.  Of
course, the sword has ideas of its own and does not like to be
used by Orcus.  It will bide its time, but it will be hard
pressed to do so.  If it is revealed prematurely, it is due to
its impatience.
  Besides wanting its possessor to kill, it will also want its user
to take as much treasure and magic items as he can.  It will
prompt him to be more greedy, telling him he needs it to be more
powerful.  In fact, the sword will push all actions that make the
possessor more chaotic and evil.  If the possessor is a thief, it
will suggest to him to perform more backstabs, more
pickpocketing, more taking of treasure when noone is looking.
  The sword will improve the users thief abilities by 25%
if used for the powers of chaos and evil, and penalize by the
same amount when not.  The thief should not be aware of this.
This is so that after awhile, the thief will tend to exercise his
more successful practices.  Whenever the user does act more
chaotic and evil, the sword will telepathically congratulate him,
promising him more rewards in terms of its powers.
  The possessed character will become crafty, quiet, and withdrawn.
He will no longer participate in the conversation.  Instead, he
will follow party cue, waiting for an opportunity.  When it
presents itself, he will cut the throats of his opponents while
they sleep.  He will use the sword's powers to their fullest and
kill everyone and everything.  When he is through with a 1-6 week
binge of killing everything (during this time the plus of the
sword increases to +10), he will summon Orcus and become their chief hen
chmen.  The Sword will act as a gate through which they and all their mi
nions can enter the Prime Material Plane.  He will rule the plane when O
rcus is away.  He will become the equivalent of a Duke of Hell.
  As soon as the character takes the sword as his own, he
has lost the support of his deity.  The sword and Orcus will
prevent the possessor from knowing the loss of his deity.  If the
possessor calls upon his deity, the sword and Orcus will answer
his call in his deity's name, pretending to be that deity.  Where
before the deity was inactive with the possessor, now "messages"
will come to the possessor in such forms as "inspirations" and
"dreams".  Orcus will know everything about the party as long as
the sword is with them.
  If the character possesses a familiar, a quazit will replace it.  The
quazit will be polymorphed to appear exactly like the previous one.
The familiar will back up all messages sent by Orcus and send similiar
messages to support those of the sword.
  The user will always be detected as his original alignment
until he becomes CE.  Spells cast by a character of over 15th
level do have a percentage chance of detecting his changing
alignment.  Only a commune by a cleric of over 15th level will
discern the true nature of the sword.  The sword has a way of
altering commune spells seeking its nature directly, up to 15th
level of spells.  If a very direct question is asked regarding
the sword, such as, "Is the possessor of this sword acting in a
way that he would not believe 10 years ago?" might work.  Then
again, it might not.  This percentage is 10% chance per level of
caster above 15th.  If a character fails to detect it, he or she
does not have a chance of successful detection until he or she
attains a higher level.  Simply tell them that they do not detect
his alignment to be any different than before.  Paladins' detect
evil also applies to these restrictions and is considered at 2
levels below their level as a paladin.  As soon as the character
openly acts CE, the paladins will detect an evil so great that it
will stun them for 1-5 rounds unless they make a save versus
wands at -5.
   The sword will especially push the user to kill helpless victims,
saying that it will offer more powers.  If asked why it lied
about its powers to begin with, it will defend himself by saying
that it does not want the possessor to become too powerful.
  Inform the possessor that, by using this sword, he will gain more
experience points.  This is another lie of the sword.
  When used against the minions of orcus, It will miss every strike and
draw attention telepathically to the party. The minions of Orcus and
will always know of the sword's presence.
  When communicating, the sword should refer to himself and the
user as "we."

--------------------------------FIRE BITER------------------------------

<<same>>

Magical adj: see below...
Intelligence: 10
Ego: 18
Alignment: Chaotic Good

Magical abilities:
detect evil fire using/dwelling creature (glows; 100 foot radius)
triple damage against such creatures on a natural 20
fire resistance for weilder
telepathic in alignment tongue

How it fell into Orcus's possession:  This pompous sword led its
possessor through many a mighty battle.  As their victories grew
so did the ego of the sword and the fighter who possessed it.
Believing their powers to be so great, they decided they could
take on the queen of the fire elementals.  They found a way to
enter the elemental plane of fire.  Unfortunately, the sword
could not overcome the intense flames found there, let alone the
flames of the queen of fire elementals herself.  Orcus bargained
it from her at the expense of 66 water elementals and a merman
prince.  All memories of these events have been blasted from the
sword through Orcus's black magic.

-----------------------------DRAGON CHOPPER-----------------------------

<<same>>

Magical adj: +2 (see below...)
Intelligence: 11
Ego: 19
Alignment: Lawful Good

Magical abilities:
detect evil dragons (glows; 100 foot radius)
triple damage against evil dragons if a natural 20 is rolled
telepathic in alignment tongue

Because of the nature of the sword, it can only be possessed by a
paladin, ranger, or LG fighter.

How "Dragon Chopper" fell into the hands of Orcus:  The story is
similar to that of "Fire Biter".  Its possessor grew so confident
he single-handedly challenged Tiamat to a duel.  Tiamat knew of
this miscreant before he even entered her plane.  She had all of
her consorts beside her invisible.  The Paladin sensed evil, but
believed it to be Tiamat alone as well as the fact that he was in
Hell.  The Paladin rushed to attack and was blasted by the breath
weapons of 6 of each type of dragon.  The remains of the Paladin
were never found.  His sword miraculously survived.  Orcus traded
6 hearts of each type of good dragon in exchange for this sword.
He blasted the memory of this sword just as he did "Fire Biter".

-----------------------------HELL BEATER--------------------------------

<<same>>

Magical adj: +3 (+5 vs. devils) (also see below)
Intelligence: 12
Ego: 20
Alignment: Lawful Good

Magical abilities:
double damage vs. devils (additional to the +5)
destroys devils on a natural 20 if on Prime Material Plane
detect presence of a devil (100 feet)
telepathic in alignment tongue

(Note: can only be posessed by a paladin)

How "Hell Beater" came to be possessed by Orcus:  Like its two
brother swords, this conceited sword goaded its possessor until
he challanged Asmodeus.  Asmodeus disarmed the Paladin and is
using rings of longevity and regeneration to keep him alive for
eternal torture and torment.  Asmodeus sold the sword to Orcus
for the head of a Astral Deva and another Paladin.  Orcus removed
the memory of this sword as well.  **Note this condition.  Devils
will recognize this sword as Asmodeus's lure and will break from
regular melee to attempt to bring the possessor back to Hell with
them.  They are promised greater status as a reward and know that
Asmodeus is sincere regarding promises of this nature.

--------------------------COPYCAT BLADE-----------------------------------------

<< From:  JCROWLEY@WHEATNMA.BITNET >>

Appearance:  Sword hilt (no blade)
Magical adj: +2


- At first this sword will appear to be trash, it has no blade, but it's
  a perfectly good hilt

- If the hilt is grasped, however, and a command word said, the power of
  the blade is made known.

- By touching any substance, and using the command word, a blade  for
  the sword comes into existence made of the same material as that
  touched.  Therefore holding the blade up to a fire would produce a
  burning blade.  A stone blade would be invulnerable to rust monsters
  and such, a blade of holy water (holy ice) would do appropriate damage
  against demons.

- note that the magic can copy gold, silver, platinum, diamonds, etc...
  but breaking off the blade to use the raw material as currency ruins
  the magic of the sword.

-------------------------------METALBLADE---------------------------------------

<<  same  >>

Appearance:  Stone or bone sword
Magical adj.: +1  (this baby doesn't NEED magical bonuses!)
This is an enormously dangerous weapon.  Always crafted from stone or
bone and tempered in the blood of lava children, the Metalblade
ignores metal.  Completely.  Doesn't even know it's there.  Passes right
through it.  So those fighters striding around in plate armor, sniggering,
could be in for a shock...  Ignore the AC of metal armor, but magical bonuses
may or may not have their regular effects.

-----------------------TWELVE SWORDS FROM SABERHAGEN--------------------

<< From:  KRAUTP@SNCAD.SNC.EDU >>

Each of these swords appears to be of magnificent craftsmanship.  The   ade
blade of each seems to have no depth when looked at and is flawless at
all times.  The hilt of each sword appears as a pair of intertwined
dragons ending in a black, circular pommel with a symbol on it.  Each
Each sword has its own symbol.


#1  COINSPINNER: Longsword +3   Int:18    Ego:30    Align: True Neutral
Symbol on pommel: a pair of dice
Nickname: the sword of luck
+2 to all rolls when possessing the sword (esp. gambling)
Ability to teleport itself anywhere it wishes at any time
Drawback: only the sword will teleport, not the holder
Only one of the swords which communicates, but usually doesn't
Personality: Very self serving and egotistical

#2  DOOMGIVER: Longsword +3       Int:13     Ego:20    Align: Lawful Good
Symbol on pommel: a circle
Reflects all attacks upon holder back at attacker
 all physical, mental, and spells (D100+49 % of the spell is turned
 back at the caster, 101+ = 100%)
Drawback: Wielder cannot attack if using the power

#3  DRAGONSLICER: Longsword +3    Int:13    Ego:20    Align: Neutral Good
Symbol on pommel: a dragon
+6 and triple damage vs. all non-unique dragons

#4  FARSLAYER: Longsword +3##  Int:13    Ego:20    Align: True Neutral
Symbol on pommel: a bullseye
Nickname: the sword of vengence
A nice little weapon with the habit of teleporting without error
 through the heart of your enemy.  Where ever he/she/it is.  This is
 usually fatal unless the creature has no such organ.  In that case
 teleport the weapon someplace useful (be creative).
Drawback: do not use this power unless you want your enemy's allies
          to gain the weapon because it does not return once used.

#5  WOUNDHEALER: Longsword +3  Int: 18    Ego:20     Align: Lawful Good
Symbol on pommel: a human hand
Nicknames: the sword of mercy and the sword of love
If there ever were a weapon that could kill with kindness this is it.
Each time this weapon is used it either heals, cures, or restores the
  opponent, depending on the ailment.  If used vs. undead it attempts to
  "heal" them causing appropriate damage.

#6  MINDSWORD: Longsword +3     Int:13   Ego:20   Align: Chaotic Neutral
Symbol on pommel: arrows going outward in a circle
Merely gives the wielder a charisma of 25 & complete mental defense
  (not vs. spells or physical attacks though)
Drawback: power does not work if physically attacking with the weapon

#7  SHIELDBREAKER: Longsword +5 Int:13     Ego:50+    Align: True Neutral
Symbol on pommel: an anvil
Nickname: the sword of force
Wielder cannot be affected by physical weapons or spells while
  attacking with this weapon.
All weapons used vs. this weapon must save vs. crushing blow at a -5
  or be destroyed.
In addition to these attacks the wielder always gets one attack on any
  one attacking creature per round.
Drawback #1: This weapon causes no damage vs. unarmed people (no
  weapons that is).  It just passes through their body causing no damag e.
Drawback #2: Once you start to attack you are committed, look at the ego,
  you MUST finish all combat, one way or another.  The weapon will not
  leave the wielder's hand until combat is done.  Also, the wielder may
  not do anything else, like cast spells and use innate abilities, whil e
  fighting with the weapon.
The weapon also makes a very loud hammering noise when it is used in
  combat.

#8  SIGHTBLINDER: Longsword +3  Int:18#   Ego:20    Align: Chaotic Neutral
Symbol on pommel: a human eye
Nickname: the sword of stealth
Alter reality spell gone wierd
Wielder (actually owning will work too) looks like the most Hated/Loved
  Feared Character/beast/whatever the viewer knows or has heard of.
True Sight 1/week
Drawback: You do not know who you look like and not everyone will see
  the same person/beast/whatever

#9 SOULCUTTER: Longsword +3   Int:18     Ego:30    Align: Lawful Evil
Symbol on pommel: it has none.  Just a blank black field
Nickname: the sword of despair
Creates a cause light wounds effect to everyone in sight of the bare
  blade (allies are also included).
Drawback: Drains the wielder of 1 Permanent H.P. per 3 rounds until
  he/she/it puts the weapon away or is dead (no res. as the sword
  actually destroys the soul of the wielder, not the people being
  attacked).

#10 STONECUTTER: Longsword +3  Int:13    Ego:20    Align: Neutral Good
Symbol on pommel: a wedge cutting into a block
Nickname: the sword of siege
Cuts all stone like butter
+6 vs. creatures made of stone & triple damage vs. stone creatures.

#11 TOWNSAVER: Longsword +3    Int:18    Ego:30   Align: Lawful Good
Symbol on pommel: the top of a battlement
Nickname: the sword of fury
+5 & Haste spell in effect when wielded in an inhabitance which
  contains innocent civilians (well, semi-innocent ones will do).
All damage taken does not affect the wielder until all foes are dead.
Drawback: The accumulation of damage until the end of the battle could
  be real bad.  For example, if you have 50 h.p. and take 90 h.p. of
  damage during the battle, at the end of the battle you will drop dead .

#12 WAYFINDER: Longsword +3   Int:18    Ego:20   Align:Chaotic Neutral
Symbol on pommel: an arrow
Will point the wielder where ever they truly want to go
Drawback:The route will not necessarily be the quickest or the safest   ,
  but they will get there (if they live).

---------------THE SWORD OF THE FAMILLIARITY (ROTWEILER)----------------

<< From:  s2793064@techst02.technion.ac.il >>

The sword is the greatest masterwork of kes; done when he was at lv.19.
It emits radiation of enchantment/charm and lesser divination.
The sword looks like a regular metal longsword with a picture of a
sheperd dog on the handle (a rotweiler).
The sword had no powers when it was created.this is one of the reasons kes
created it this way: he didn't want to spend to much power on it. instead
it takes it's power from the wielder. When it is created it is made of
three parts. When combined into one it creates a link with the one which
connected it, becomes one as if never broken, and becomes extremely
loyal to the owner. This connection lowers 1 con. from the connecter.
The sword has it's own level which goes up as the owner fights with it. This
power is taken from the weilder, but as 1 con was removed the owner isnt
harmed further. The level determines which bonuses the sword has.
It also determines how strong an allingnment it radiates. It radiates inthe
wielder allignment when lev 1-4 :weakly alligned
                            5-8 :medium alligned
                            9-12:strong alligned
                            13- :very strong alligned.

When the sword breaks or the owner dies (which causes it's breaking) the
sword lets all the energy accumulated inside blow up and damages all around.
If the sword is medium alligned or further (over 5), the damage is givenfirst
to the ones with allignment most far from the weilder.
if the sword breaks up before the weilder dies he suffers some damage according
to the swords level.(see table)

Kes created the sword partly as an experiment which he never got to performe.
Therefore it created a faint magical cord which is attached to it and can act
as a guiding signal for a wizard who knows about it and tries to find it.
A detect magic from a high level MU (or successfull throw) can see it.

------------------------------SWORD OF FORBEARANCE----------------------

<< From:  reshef@techunix.bitnet >>

Magical Adjustment: +1<always a long sword; rather slim and light>
Intelligence: 0 <although it has a special purpose: to protect weilder>
Alignment:<none specified by author, personal suggestion: LG or NG>

It'll act as any normal +1 weapon as long as the wielder is healthy ( over
1/2 of max HP ).
But as the character looses HP, it'll start to make itself useful.
For every 10% bellow 50% of max HP the wielder is currently,
the sword adds +1 to his AC against weapons as it starts to fend for the
wielder. at 10% ( when the wielder is just about finished )
of max HP, The sword will stop to try to hit the opponent and will concentrate
on defending it's wielder ( it's very loyal ), adding another +1 to AC and
also if the wielder hits his opponent ( DM's - Don't let on on the sword
not attacking to harm ) - it disarms the opponent.

The AC bonuses are good only VS hand wielded weapons - it does not affect
AC vs. arrows and the like.

the reason for naming it 'sword of forbearance' are that the sword
will 'forgive' the user for abandoning her & as it's not intelligent +
it forgives enemies for hurting it's master a bit as that is life, but it'll
try it's hardest to keep him alive and well.

This Sword is usable only by fighters as the Disarm capability implies.
if a non-fighter uses it, it'll protect him at 1/2 usefullnes and can't
disarm.
If a fighter uses it to disarm an opponent it is a +3 sword.
Also for a fighter who try to fend off enemies - or any other kind of
non-lethal combat ( as per the Anearthed Arcana or the 2'nd edition. )

-------------------------SWORD OF CANINE ATTRACTION---------------------

<< From:  STNEEC@MACALSTR.EDU >>

Magical Adj: +1 (hit/dam)

     This little oddity was last reported in PM 26565, a small splinter
of reality near Torilspace.  This is a rather finely made weapon, whose
most notable property is that it is made completely from the legbone of
a dragon of unknown species.  Its main enchantment is that every canine
creature who sees it must posess it (no save).  They will follow the
sword around until they have an opportunity to grab it, in which case
they will make off with it and bury it somewhere.  And yes, they will
follow it if you throw it.

Personal suggestion: don't let your players know its power...watch them
panic the next time they walk about in a city!  <hysterical laughter>

--------------------------THE BLACK BLADE-------------------------------

<< From:  OPRDCS@GSUVM1 >>

Type: Long sword
Intelligence: 17
Ego:  18
Magical Adjustment: +2
Magic Resistance: 85%
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral

 Description:  black onyx obsidian blade w/mitheral inlaid along the blade and
 rune carved. It also has a black diamond pommel.
 The sheath and baldric are made of black dragon skin with mithril tool ing and
 stitching.
 Upon the killing stroke, the wielder will temporarily gain the number of hit
 points of the killed creature.  If the creature is humanoid or human the wielde
 r will also gain the levals/hit dice of said person.  This will last for a
 number of turns the creature has levals or hit dice.
 If the sword does not kill in three days, its ego will rise one point a day unt
 il it controls the wielder and makes him kill.  This can also occur if in battl
 e the wielder loses enough hit points to lose control.
 The black blade act as a dancing sword and also heals 1 point per day.
 It can detect traps, secret doors, and evil.
 It talks telepathically and can speak dwarvish, black dragon, stone golem, orc
 and of course common.
 The voice it speaks in is a deep ominous crackling tone.

-----------------------THE COLD INTELLECT SWORD-------------------------

<< From:  FHGAA99@BLEKUL11 >>

(author's note:
These are the stats for The Cold Intellect and a sword forged from its
remains. The sword uses a lot of the capacities of the CI so I'm providing
you with its stats also.)

Cold Intellect
--------------

There are several degrees of Cold Intellects.
Consciousness starts from an intelligence of 16 and then slowly grows to 20.
Stats vary according to its intelligence. Those of int 16 are always
first mentioned, then follow the stats of int 17, and so on.

AC: 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0
Move : /20" (floating)
Hit Dice : 4 - 5+1 - 6+2 - 7+3 - 8+4

No. of attacks : 1
Damage/attack : 1d6 (crushing damage)
                2d8 ( when charging)
Special attacks : lightning - see below
Special defense : immunity - see below
Intelligence: variable ( 16-17-18-19-20 )
Alignment: most are Neutral
           a few are CN,LN,NG,NE
           a (rare) exception is LG,LE,CG,CE
Size : hollow sphere of 3' diameter
Psionics: 100 - 150 - 200 - 250 - 300
 Attack/Defense modes: int 16:   : a,c/g,i
                       int 17-18 : a,c,e/g,i,j
                       int 19-20 : all/all
 Abilities : Domination
             Esp
             Telepathy
           - special abilities ( they require no psionic cost but cease
                                 to function when psionic ability is zero )
             Levitation ( to keep it floating )
             Energy Control

The Cold Intellect is a sleek, dark pink, metal ball. The metal is of unknown
origin and keeps the energy in the hollow sphere.
When it gains control over an area ( no other highly intelligent mortal
creatures left ) it settles down.
It lives solitary and spends huge amounts of time on thinking and controlling
its inner energy fluxes. ( a decade is normal )
When it has refined its energy structure ( and the metal around it ), it
grows in intelligence and gains additional powers.
Its hit points are a measure of the quality of the metal. How better, how
more blows the sphere can sustain before it tears apart. Should this happen
the energy is dissipated and the intellect is utterly destroyed.
A CI feeds on the thermal energy around it, hence it is cold.

A CI can release strokes of lightning at will. An 16 int CI has a surplus
energy of 18d6 and is capable of releasing it in strokes of minimum 1d6
and maximum 6d6.
17 int CI has 21d6 - max stroke of 7d6
18 int CI has 24d6 - max stroke of 8d6
19 int CI has 27d6 - max stroke of 9d6
20 int CI has 30d6 - max stroke of 10d6
It can release only one stroke per round. Thus a 20 CI is able to release
a 1d6 stroke for 30 rounds or 2d6 strokes for 15 rounds, and so on...

Recharging can only take place after combat. Exception: lightning bolts
will be completely absorbed and it number of dice added to the surplus.
A CI is immune to cold based effects ( due to the guarding metal ).
Fire based effects: Saving throw failed : half the fire dice will be converted
and added to the surplus. The other half is deducted from the hit points
Saving throw succeeded : 3/4 of the dice is added to the surplus. 1/4 damage.
Excess energy will flow to the earth ( and is not stored ).

Weapons-2.gallery

The Cold Intellect Sword
------------------------

In the beginning the sword is as follows:
+2 to hit / +2 to damage
            +4 to damage against fire-electricity using creatures
            Damage from such creatures will be added to the energy
            store. Ratio is 6 hit points for 1d6. Truncate excesses.
Wielder can use lightning bolts with a maximum of 4d6 - from a energy
store of 12d6. Normal recharging ( without bonuses from damage and attacks )
is done once a day.

The blade is extremely cold, and precautions should be taken while
wielding ( e.g. ring of resist cold in the hilt, a special enchanted
scabbard, etc... )
When the wielder makes its saving throw against lightning, all energy
will be stored in the sword as a surplus. Excess energy is truncated.
When he doesn't, he takes half damage, while the rest is absorbed.

Due to the forging process, the quality of the metal is reduced to its
lowest state. However, its capacity to store energy remains. The 'spark
of life' that once created the CI is still present.
When a to hit score of 20 is rolled ( modified or not ) against a
highly intelligent creature ( e.g. a mage ) the sword will sap an intelligence
point from him ( permanently ) and add it to his own intelligence. Decide
for yourself what the effects are on the victim: loss of spells, etc...
The sword starts from an intelligence of 5. When it has reached an intelligence
of 10 another CI will be born.
Once it has intelligence 16 , draining intelligence is at a ratio of
5 drained points for one intelligence point for the CI

Int 10-15 : +2 to hit against normal creatures
            +3 to hit / +4 to damage against fire-electricity using creatures
            Sword has empathy
Int 16 : True consciousness is now present.
         +2 to hit normally
         +4 to hit against fire-electricity using creatures
         Damage absorbation ratio is 5 hp for 1d6
         Sword has telepathy
         Lightning bolts are the same for a 16 CI
         Saving throws against fire : success:wielder takes no
         damage. Half the damage is absorbed in the sword
         failed:Wielder takes half damage, 1/4 absorbed in sword
Int 17 : Levitation upon wielder, when nicely asked ( once a day )
         Ligthning bolts as the 17 CI
         +3 on initiative ( the sword has become almost weightless )
Int 18 : Full psionic powers of an 18 CI are gained ( but only the sword
           can use them, the wielder has to ask for it )
         Damage absorbation is 4 hp for 1d6
         Lightning bolts as the 18 CI

The sword has now full powers and will decide upon its goal in life.
Note that it has no true revenge feelings, since the living CI is another
being than the one that was killed. However, it may have bad feelings
about the fact that one of his kind was killed.
Should it decide to stay a sword, it shall always remain on Int 18, but
it can drink intellect by draining points ( which is a kind of drug ).
Note that it will be always hateful against intelligent creatures, since
it sees them as rivals.
Should it decide to become a sphere, it loses the draining capacity, but
can become a powerful 20 CI. When it chooses the sphere, it will ask the
wielder to leave it behind in a secluded space. When the wielder refuses,
it will use all his forces to make him do so and afterwards destroy him.
Even when the wielder agrees,the chance of being killed is high, unless
the sword is assured ( by Esp e.g. ) of the wielder's loyalty.
This is because the conversion from blade to sphere is a delicate process
and the CI wishes no intrusion.

Final note: feel free to change the chance of draining int points and/or
            the ratio of draining int points. The purpose was the sword
            should grow along in level as its wielder, until a final
            confrontation occurs.

--------------------------THE FLAMEBIRD SPECIAL---------------------------------

<< From:  KMHK@MARISTB >>

*Shortsword with flaming spines making up the hilt (cactuslike)*
Magical adj: +1
No Int, Ego or Alignment

This shortsword *CAN* be used by clerics (it belonged to a cleric named
Father Flamebird who just happened to have a weaponsmithing proficiency)
Only the most docile gods will disallow clerics to use it since it is a
relic representing survival.  It was used in the Age of the Nine Hells
to keep Father Flamebird alive when all of his kind were going to a
slow, horrid death by the evil that grew in the land.

The spikes:
- can be shot in a widespread arc (180 deg.) for 5 pts of damage to any
  creature in that area (no to hit unless creature is on the edges).
- can be shot in a focused beam causing 20 points of damage on a sucess-
  ful to-hit roll.
- grow back in a week

-------------------------------THE DAGGER TIP---------------------------

<< From:  ADP89@MSU >>

    This item appears to be the tip of a dagger which has been          broken
off a complete weapon.  It has a hole crudely drilled in one end, so that it
can be worn on a necklace or braclet, like a charm.   When a command word is
spoken, the Dagger Tip falls from whatever it is attached to, becoming a +2
Dagger.  An additional command word will make the dagger Invisible.  The grip
is hollow: the pommel unscrews to reveal a compartment containing Thieve's
tools. Repeating the command word causes the dagger to shrink back to its
original form.  The small size and relatively harmless appearance of the
Dagger Tip makes it an easily concealed weapon!
                                                                        ******
-----------------------BAARANE'S SWORDS OF AGILITY----------------------

<< I apologize for losing the submitor's address >>

This is a variation of a sword which appeared in Dragon #38 (I believe.) I
didn't wish to use a possibly-TSR copyrighted name, so here goes:

There are three swords created by the legendary weapon forger Baarane.  They
are a longsword, shortsword, and bastard sword.  All weapons have some
properties in common.  All three are:

+2 weapons to hit and damage
(considered +4 for attacking creatures which require a certain +to-hit)

After the first round of combat, the wielder will ALWAYS strike first in the
round, regardless of dexterity or other modifiers.

All radiate Continual Light in a 60' radius. Light CANNOT be controlled by
the wielder: it is ALWAYS on when the weapon is drawn.

When wielded, the light pouring from the blade creates a "strobe" effect in
front of the wielder, adding 2 to his AC for all frontal attacks.

Color Spray/Hypnotic Pattern (and similar spells) have no effect on the
wielder or on anyone standing behind the wielder within the radius of light
emmitted by the blade.

Blade can cast Jump spell at will, up to 5 times/day.

Each blade has it's own set of additional properties.
                                                                        ------
BAARANE'S SHORT SWORD:  (in addition to the above, has these properties)

Good Alignment: INT 15, Ego:8

Can speak in any language known to the wielder, but will speak only when
questioned.

Will try to convince the weilder to "do good", as appropriate to any question
it is asked.

Will Cure Critical Wounds if the weilder receives a "fatal blow" (ie one that
could knock character unconsious/dead).   The weapon has no control over this
power.  This power will NOT take effect if the weilder of the weapon is Evil.

Can detect any of the other two Baarane's swords at a range of 1 mile.  It
must be questioned about the other weapons before it can use this power.  The
weapon has know knowledge of the other sword's powers.
                                                                        ------
BAARANE'S BASTARD SWORD:  (additional properties)

Neutral Alignment: not intelligent

If used two-handed, has a 10% chance of disarming an opponent on a sucessful
"to-hit" roll. It can only disarm an opponent using a one-handed weapon.

On a natural 20, if the opponent is wielding a non-magical weapon, it will
shatter that weapon.  If the opponent is wielding a magical weapon, he must
save vs Paralization (bonus= weapon plus) or be disarmed.

If the wielder concentrates on this sword for more than one round, it will
point in the direction of the nearest of the other two Swords. If the other
Sword lies on another plane, the bastard sword will point straight up. There
is no range limit on this power.

The Bastard sword was created for one purpose: to destroy the other two
swords.  If this sword is drawn in the presence of one of the other two
blades, the wielder must make a save vs spells at -4.  Failure to save causes
the wielder to enter a berserker rage, and attack whoever is holding the
other sword.  If the save is made, the weilder becomes aware of the special
purpose of the weapon, but resists the rage.

In combat with someone wielding one of the other Baarane's Swords, if a
natural 18, 19, or 20 is rolled, the other Sword is destroyed.  A magical
explosion occurs doing 5d4+20 points of damage to all within a 20' radius of
the combat.  If this weapon manages to destroy both of the other swords, it
loses all it's special abilities, but retains those abilities common to all
three swords.
                                                                        ------
BAARANE'S LONG SWORD:  (additional properties)

Evil Alignment: INT 10, Ego:4

This weapon cannot speak, but can communicate empathically with the wielder.

This weapon will cast Fumble on anyone of Good Alignment who attempts to draw
the weapon, or is stuck by the weapon.  Normal saving throws apply.

Can Haste the wielder for up to five rounds per week.  The five rounds do not
need to be used during the same combat, or even the same day. The Haste
ability can be switched on and off.  No aging occurs to the wielder.

The Long Sword will ALWAYS lead it's master into combats, without regard for
the wielder's ability to withstand attacks.

This weapon hates other enchanted swords. Once per day, any other magical
swords carried by the wielder of this blade must save vs spells. Failure
causes other swords to lose one property (or plus, if the weapon has no
special properties.) This will continue until the offending weapon is drained
of all magic.

The Good and Evil swords were created as an experiment by Baarane.
Considering them too powerful, he secured them in a vault, where they were
later stolen by adventurers.  Outraged and angered, Baarane created the
Bastard Sword in order to exact revenge on those who had stolen from him.
Expecting that an Adventurer's natural curiosity would do his work for him, he
presented the Bastard Sword to an adventuring acquaintance as a gift.  In
time, he knew, someone who used the Bastard Sword would follow it's gentle
tugs...and he would have his revenge!!!

Baarane felt that whatever powers remained in the Bastard Sword after the
destruction of the other two would be suitable reward for the warrior strong
enough to complete the task.

(I ran an entire campaign around the theft, and eventual destruction, of these
swords.  They can provide a most interesting addition to any storyline...)

-------------------------------FANGBLADES-------------------------------

<< From:  MUALLEMA@ECUVM1 >>

Unique Item.. no other like them in the worlds.

+4 (paired) short swords.  (intelligence and ego unknown)
Whenever a killing blow is struck with one of these blades, the victim's soul
is destroyed, and the hit points of the victim are added to a running total
of points stored in the sword.  Whenever this total equals or exceeds 1,000
points, the wielder may add a +1 to any of his abilities (+1 or +5%) permanent.
Also, the caster may will the swords to glow with burning runes depicting the
names of all the souls they have destroyed.

--------------------------------LAUNCHERS-------------------------------

<< From:  OPRDCS@GSUVM1 >>

Range: 15'
Damage: 1d6+1
Loading material: 4 Shurikens or 4 throwing knives
Speed: 4 segments (4/10 of a round--translation: 2 shots/round)

  Great for assassins/monks when they're looking for that special
someone. Lightweight, easy to snatch up for those instant getaways.
Must be on stable ground or surface to operate properly.

------------------------------THE SWORD OF HOPE-------------------------

<< From:  PARGWE@MOREKYPR.BITNET >>

Here is weapon that pops up every once and awhile.  Mostly when the Bad Times
come..................

Sword of Hope
+3 longsword
Alignment: Good
Ego: 10+ (varies with the needs of the Land)
Powers:
    All spells up to 3rd level magic user and 3rd level cleric
    My use any of these powers, but if the wielder attempts to
    misuse the powers, it refuses to work.

    Morale of all friendly creatures remains at a steady level,
    never changes as long as the Hope Sword is on their side or
    until the evil(?) has been defeated.
    (as an example:  Jordan has the Hope Sword in his hand.  He and
       his 5 friends are surrounded by an Orc army of 300.  His friends
       will say things like "Nice to have known you." and smile
       happily..............)

    The enemy is slightly daunted by the Hope Sword.  In other words,
    the enemies morale drops by 2 or 3.

    Gives all allies a +2 saving throw, +1 to hit, and a +1 to damage.

Usually appears in a strange and awe-imspiring way......
   As a Sword in the Stone (as in Excalibur)
   Fall from the sky in an incredible light and sound show
   Once, it was found in an old family chest that hasn't been
      opened in years
   etc

When ever the evil is gone, it disappears........  Is stolen, simply
     vanishes, flies out of your hand and up into the heaven's....

A nice weapon to have, but it never stays around for long.....

---------------------------DAGGER OF HAPPINESS--------------------------

<< From:  BEN@OCVAXC >>

        Similar to a Dagger of Venom, it is +1 and its hilt holds 6 doses of a
sedative/happy drug.  When striking an opponent, there is a 10% chance of the
dagger injecting the drug into the opponents system.  The opponent then makes a
save vs. poison.  If the creature attacked fails its save, one round later it
sits on the ground with a smile on its face (faces, what passes for a face).
This obviously doesn't affect things not affected by poison or that don't have
blood per se.  The effects last 1d4 + 1 Turns.
        If the creature attacked makes its save, all further saves against this
poison are at -2 per injection during the above duration, because the drug is
still in the being's system.  Since the drug is slow acting, there is more of a
chance that it will be injected over a normal Dagger of Venom - which is 5% -
on a natural 20.

-------------------------------HORGON-----------------------------------

<< same >>

Two-Handed Frostbrand Sword
Intelligence: 14
Languages: Chaotic Neutral, Common, and Gargoyle

In addition to the Frostbrand abilities (+3, +6 vs. fire/fire using
creatures; 50% chance of extinguishing magical or non-magical fires
in a 10' radius, it casts strength on its weilder twice a day (3 hr.
duration), and casts heal once per day.

        Horgon is a gruff, brooding sword that speaks in a deep voice and
shouts "DIE, FIRE GIANT SCUM" when striking a fire giant.  It has similar
messages for other fire using creatures.  He gets along alright with his
wielder and other fighters or people who are CN.  He doesn't really like Wilde,
the Intelligent flame tongue that follows...
  Horgon's primary goal is glory.

--------------------------------WILDE-----------------------------------

<< same >>

Flame Tongue Long Sword
Intelligence: 15


        Wilde is an intelligent Flame Tongue (INT 15) with Black flames.  It
does normal flame tongue damage ( +1, +2 vs regenerating, +3 vs. avian,
cold-using, and +4 vs undead; acts as a ring of warmth, burns webs). It also
speaks 4 languages: NG, Common, Elvish, Gnome; casts X-ray vision twice per day
1 Turn duration, casts detect evil twice per day; and is a special purpose
sword.  Wilde's special purpose is to Kill Drow.  Against drow it is a +5
weapon.  Any drow hit with Wilde must save vs magic or be disintigrated.
        Wilde speaks with English mannerisms and in a higher, more melodius
voice than Horgon.  Wilde objects to hitting plate mail, but will do so in the
hands of his wielder - the ranger/magic user.

--------------------------------BIFF------------------------------------

<< same >>

Long Sword of Annoyance

        Biff is a +3 long sword who can make himself and his caster invisible.
The only problem is, Biff never, ever stops talking (unless promised a good
fight, in which case he might shut up for a round).  Biff speaks even while
sheathed, but his sheath muffles him enough for his wielder to sleep.
        Biff speaks common in a high, loud, voice.  "I remember when you shoved
me into that orc's heart, it was great! I was covered in blood! I could feel
the heart beating around my blade! The view inside the body was incredible!"
(etc. etc. etc.)

-----------------------ROGENWOHR, SWORD OF MIGHT--------------------------------
<< From:  KL81@MARISTB >>

Two-handed sword +3

-Wielder is compelled to call sword by full name, while the sword keeps
 saying, "The name's Roger!".

-He gets offended when people refer to him as a bastard sword, and
 replies, "Hey, I don't call you a bastard <enter race here>!", unless,
 of course, it is a half-elf wielding it, in which case he would just
 mutter to himself.

-Roger has two modes of communication, speech and telepathy. However,
 he uses them at in oportune times.  He will speak telepathicly, when
 in public, and when the owner talks to his sword, he looks crazy. He
 will speak outloud when you are trying to sleep, or are trying to sneak
 somewhere. Roger can read his weilders mind as well, but doesn't
 tell his owner that.

-Roger was made to kill those races which make up the "giant class",
 and therefore can speak all of those languages very fluently, but
 prefers to just scream the most foul taunts at it's opponents, if they
 are of the giant class.

-The special power of the sword is it ability to fire a lightining bolt
 as a 15th level wizard, once per day.  Roger will not tell his owner
 of this ability, unless it is a matter of life and death.

-Roger is of Chaotic Good alignment, and can only be used by people
 of good alignments.  If an Neutral person touches the sword, they will
 be jolted for no damage. If an Evil person touches the sword, they will
 be jolted for 10 points of damage, with no saving throw.

-Rogenwohr(pronounced ROW JEN WHORE) is crafted of adamant, mythril,
 and platinum.  The blade is pure adamant, while the hilt is made of
 a mixture of mythril, and platnum.

-It is rumored that the spirit of Rogenwohr was a ranger in his former
 life.

-----------------------------BASTARD SWORD--------------------------------------

<< From:  KMHK@MARISTB >>

LITERALLY, +3 vs. bastards (those whose fathers are not known)

-----------------------------PEOPLESMASHER--------------------------------------

<<  same  >>

Intelligence: 15
Ego: VERY high
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral (but loyal to his master...see below)
Magical adj: +4 (longsword)  and see below..

Peoplesmasher is the favorite weapon of Kohran Valkinarde, God of Battle
and Boasting.  The sword can talk and will sing Kender tunes if argued
with.  The following is a breakdown of it's magical adjustments:

+4 normally
+5 vs. regenerating creatures
+6 vs. cold-using and inflammable or avian creatures
+7 vs. undead and fire using/dwelling creatures
+8 vs. people Kohran cannot step on or are better looking than himself
       (this is serious!  anyone with a comeliness of 21+)

(further details of Kohran are available upon request)

-------------------------------BUTT DRILLER-------------------------------------

<<  same  >>

+1 dagger normally
+3 if used from behind (great for thieves!)

---------------------------------AKASHA-----------------------------------------

<<  same  >>

Intelligence: 17
Ego: tolerable
Alignment: Chaotic Good

Akasha or Bloodbringer is the most powerful sword of Silvain Darksword
Goddess of War and Seduction (Greater Goddess).  She is the wife of
Thayathas(Thayathas' bow). Akasha may only be used in the nightime; If
used in the day, it must save versus spell as a 6th level fighter or
turn to ash.  If this happens, the sword may be restored if the ashes
are collected and mixed with nine drops of Silvains blood in its sheath.
The sword talks.  Its claim to fame is that it can drain life-levels at
the rate of 2 per hit if the opponent is 10th level or higher and at the
rate of 1 per hit if the opponent is lower than 10th level.


SPEARS:
=======

-------------------------------SPEAR OF NAUSEA--------------------------

<< From:  RESHEF@TECHUNIX >>

<in the spirit of the times:>
How about a spear of naeusa ( I know it's not spelled this way BUT )
It's a large throwing spear that looks like it can't be thrown very far
But any one that knows the magic word ( Saddam would be a nice one )
and then throws it will be not so surprised to see it fly to the range of
2"/4"/6" ( double range ) and at a hit ( or a miss ) will put forth a small
stinking cloud : 10' radius. as per the spell.

The spear is other wise a normal +1 weapon. if thrown it has no To hit bonus.

----------------------------THE SPEAR OF FEAR---------------------------

<< same >>

This is a normal, well balanced-spear ( +1 to hit when thrown )
that has the property of looking to anyone not wielding it as
a HUGE thing.

If wielded in melee combat, it is no great advantage, except that
it has an illusory +3 damage. If a save vs. spells is made,
this illusory damage will not occur. This save must be made each time
the opponent is hit.

It's greatest advantage is when thrown.
Then, (except for the +1 to hit, AND the +3 illusory damage),
when it is on it's way towards the target, it starts to grow
in the eyes of the target and it seems be double the true size
or even more. Thus, a save vs. spells must be made to determine if the
opponent flees in panic from the sight as well as an additional save vs.
spells to determine whether or not the opponent takes double damage
upon a hit ( before the +3 modifier ).

Another oddity of the weapon is that, because it has an illusory growth,
even opponents that are outside the spear's range, would see it coming
their way and might think ( save vs. spells ) that they have been hit
by the spear. However, they take only normal damage.

BOLTS/BOW:
==========

----------------------------BOLT OF ENTRAPMENT--------------------------

<< From:  SLEEPY@UWYO.BITNET >>

Cost: 10,000 gp
Tip: Cold Iron
Shaft: Demon Bone (silver coated)
Fletchings: Roc Feathers
Enchantments: Forcecage, Perminate spells.

     The Bolt of Entrapment has a maximum range of a normal (short
range) bolt.  When fired, it streaks out at the target (attack roll
required for Dwarfs).  It stops four inches from the target's face
and explodes in a bright green light.  The target must save vs.
wands or be blinded for 1-4 rounds. If the save is successful, the
target notices a dull green encompassing him.  If the target fails,
the target notices nothing.  The cage lasts for 1-2 hours and can
be removed by pulling the bolt shaft (which hovers in front of the
"lock" of the cage). The bolt is destroyed in the process.  This
bolt is used often to stop PC's but not kill them.

------------------------------BOLT OF ITCHING---------------------------

<< same >>

Cost: 50 gp
Tip: small mushroom spore
Shaft: pine
Fleatching: goose
Enchantments: none

     The Bolt of Itching is the combination of some of the most
irritating substances know in nature.  The liquids of poison ivy
and poison oak is a powerdered form are combined with spores from
various mushrooms. If a person is hit by this bolt the tip explodes
causing the contents of the bolt to cover a one meter radius.
Those who are caught in this cloud must make a saving throw vs.
poison or stop and itch themselves for 3 turns.  Those who do save
must save again once per three turns or suffer the same effects
until they are washed clean of the powder.

================================================================================
                          B L U N T   W E A P O N S
================================================================================

------------------------------------MACE OF DEMOLITIONS-------------------------

<< From:  CELOVINE@COLBY.EDU >>

This weapon has two main purposes described below:

1) When wielded in combat, the weapon can throw its force upto a distance
   of 25 feet from the wielder.  The range modifiers are as follows:
                  DISTANCE                      DAMAGE

                  0 to 5 feet                   3d8+4
                  5 to 10                       3d8
                  10 to 15                      2d8+4
                  15 to 20                      1d8+4
                  20 to 25                      1d8

2) The reason for creation of the mace was as a seige weapon. It has the
   ability to crumble walls and shatter doors. Chances for doing so are
   as follows:
                DOORS                           WALLS
           90%  wooden                      90%  wooden
           80%  wood w/iron reinf.          80%  iron
           75%  iron                        70%  stone
           70%  stone

For both doors and walls, subtract 5% per foot of thickness over one foot

WARNING:  Although this is not a relic, it is extremely rare and does
    have drawbacks.  It was a favorite weapon of kings centuries ago,
    and those fortunate to have one were not always fortunate to avoid
    boiling oil.  Also, the wielder must make a dexterity check or
    receive damage from flying debris.  Also there is a daily limit on
    uses of the mace's force projection. To determine, roll 1d6. For
    walls and doors, this can be done ten times per day, but subtract 1%
    from the chance table per charge used.

----------------------------------AXE OF DUMAS----------------------------------
<<  same  >>
    This one is a relic.  There was only one Dumas and thus only one Axe
Dumas was a hero of Chaotic Neutral alignment, however, anyone of any
neutral alignment is able to use this weapon, except for druids. There
is a catch, though.  The Axe will eventually force its owner to become
Chaotic Neutral over a period of time, determined by adding intelligence
and wisdom, and dividing by two. This yeilds the number of months that
it will take before the process is complete.

                It also has the following powers:
        1) create a Wall of Force (once a month)
        2) cast Disintegrate (once a month)
        3) cast Ray of Death (3 times/week)
        4) detects treasure (on command)
        5) detects traps (on command)
        6) detects enemy (on command)

     Other than this the Axe acts as a Sword of Sharpness +5 and speaks
Neutral, Lawful Neutral, Chaotic Neutral, Neutral Good and Neutral Evil.d,
     DMs can decide whether they wish to have intelligence an           d
ego.  It's not a necessary item.

-------------------------MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER------------------------

<< From:  BEN@OCVAXC >>

        Maxwell's Silver Hammer is a +3 silver war hammer made by the high
priest Maxwell.  When the magic words "Bang-Bang" are spoken, the hammer acts
as if a spiritual hammer spell had been cast on it: It flies around and strikes
at people selected by the wielder.  Unlike the hammers used for spiritual
hammer, Maxwell's silver hammer is not used up.  On a die roll of 19 or 20 (out
of 20), the hammer does double base damage, providing that the creature struck
has a head that is within reach of the wielder.

----------------------------KILLER-YO-YO--------------------------------

<< same >>

        A carved wooden yo-yo, used to hit a monster, will do 1d3 versus small
and man-sized creatures, and 1d2 versus large.  If a 20 is rolled, the yo-yo
string has encircled the neck (if the creature has one that is small enough)
and does 2d8 of garroting damage per round until removed.

---------------------------------THE MC HAMMER----------------------------------

<< From:  BROGAN@XAVIER.BITNET >>

Magical adj: +2

Special abilities:

immune to rusting and silly remarks
gives weilder proficiency in singing and dancing
due to the natural rhythm of the warhammer, the weilder may get an
extra attack per odd round.

        A spell  (to b used along with the hammer???)

 CAN'T TOUCH THIS
 Duration: 2 turns maximum
 Range: self
 Casting Time: 1 segment
 Components: V,S
 Level Five

  When a wizard evokes this spell his armor class is lowered to -10
for one round. On the next round his armor class is -9.  Each successive
round the armor class rises until the armor class is equal to the armor
class existing before the spell. At this moment in time the spell is    ven by t
cancelled.

------------------------------STAFF OF CREATION---------------------------------

<< From:  BARD@CS.CORNELL.EDU >>

It looks like a tall piece of polished wood. If you look at it closely,
its surface seethes with tiny images of all kinds of things appearing,
and slowly being buried in other images; it feels as if the staff is
growing by infinitely thin layers. As a weapon, the staff behaves just
like and ordinary staff, save only that it is unbreakable (in fact it
indestructable, as it continually recreates itself).  It has no combat
bonuses.  It has a single power: it may create anything straightforward,
at the tip of the staff.  This can be used as often as desired.

What's straightforward?  Most natural things, including live things.
Anything that an honest laborer could put together in a day's work from
common materials.  Anything not too rare that could be found in nature.
Anything that could be distilled by wise craft from nature.  Here are some
examples.
  * gigantic iron manacles and chains, positioned around your opponent.
  * splashes of lava
  * immense blocks of ice.
  * various corrosive and toxic substances.
  * large boulders
  * angry elephants and gryphons.
  * tornadoes
  * brick walls
  * large hills
  * gold, silver, and gemstones.
  * living flesh (e.g., muscles and bones and blood to replace those that
    your foe's sword have just removed from you.)  It can completely heal
    some kinds of wounds, in particular stabs, slices, and severs.  It is
    much less effective against crushing, burning, freezing, and so on, as
    the problem isn't simply destroyed flesh; it heals 10-40% of such wounds,
    and repeated attempts to heal don't do any good.  It can heal the bearer
    or someone that she touches with the staff.
  * most potions (all the ones in the DMG, for example)
  * selected other magic objects, based on simplicity rather than power;
    Things with an elemental quality about them, a simplicity of form and
    function.  All these objects are very hard to control.
    + Spheres of Annihilation.  Although they are antithetic to the staff's
      purpose, they are just the kind of thing it can create.  Note that the
      staff is indestructable, and so may be used to poke the sphere to try
      to keep it away from you.  (They tend to ignore talismans of sphere
      control.)
    + Gadgets that call storms.  (The storms often get out of hand.)
    + Javelins of Lightning.  (They tend to go the wrong way on occasion.)
    + Dust of Appearance / Disappearance / Choking (Tends to last rather a long
 time.)
    - Nothing that is under its user's control, except in the simplest way.
      For example, those talismans which control spheres are very much a way
      of taming the world, which put them 'way outside the staff's realm.
      The dusts up there are pretty straightforward; dust of illusion is
      intended to be subject to human will, and hence totally outside the
      scope of the staff.  Rods of Beguiling are right out.
  * Teddy bears, chocolate-chip cookies, and hot cocoa.  (To feed and comfort
    the city that just got flooded, for example.)

Comments:
  1. This list is intended to suggest the staff's scope and power.  It is not
     nearly complete.
  2. Things that it creates are real, and not kept here by magic or anything
     like that.  They cannot be dispelled.
  3. Conversely, things that are created are not under either the staff's or
     the weilder's control.  If you summon an elephant, you'd best be able to
     deal with it.
  4. A naive user of this staff will be less effective than a clever one.  It
     is not a brilliant melee weapon -- not by itself, at any rate.
  5. Some things are marginally straightforward; e.g. moving objects.  The
     staff is unreliable at creating such things; they vary greatly in
     quality and accuracy.
  6. It's pretty good for empire builders.  But they have to be careful
     with economics and such.  Don't tell people that you can make as much
     gold as you want...

-------------------------THE STAFF OF VORTICES--------------------------

<< From:  VB7R0014@SMUVM1 >>

   The Staff  of Vortices is (+3) to hit and damage and looks as if it
   came from  a tree  that had  been badly  twisted by  a tornado or a
   cyclone.  It is wooden and whitish in color.

   It can  summon from 1-4 cyclones which do a total of 4d12 points of
   damage.   If a  full cyclone  is cast,  it will  do 4d12  points of
   damage.   If a  half cyclone  is cast,  it will  do 2d12  points of
   damage and the staff will still be able to summon 2d12 points worth
   of cyclone that day.

   A maximum of 4d12 worth of cyclone can be cast in a 24 hour period.
   If a  1/3d cyclone  is cast,  it will  do 2d8  points of damage.  A
   quarter cyclone can also be cast.   (NOTE:  Three 1/3 cyclones will
   be the most power the staff can cast in a day, but if all three are
   cast simultaneously, the result will be one 1/2 and two 1/4s.  Four
   cyclones, total, are the most that the staff can cast in a day.)

   Cyclones are  controlled, as  desired, by  the holder of the staff.
   If cast in water, they can either become water spouts or whirlpools
   with the same propensity for damage as a normal cyclone.

--------------------THE STAFF OF THE PRISMATIC DRAGON-------------------

<< From:  PFREY@DREW.BITNET >>

A rope of entanglement with 'color spray' as its command word.  Watch
as the characters dive to the ground, eyes shut, when a monster uses
it! >-)

0 charges:

Light
Darkness, 5'r

1 charge:

Phantasmal force    Cone of cold
Hypnotic pattern    Fire storm
Pyrotechnics        Prismatic spray

2 charges:

Prismatic sphere
Monster summoning VI
Plane travel (to Prismatic; himself only)

It may absorb spells and cause a retributive strike.

The prismatic sphere functions at nighttime.  It will
last until dispelled.

The prismatic dragon is the first son of Tiamat.  He has exactly the
same appearances as Tiamat.  The exception is that each head
breathes a color of the spell prismatic spray that matches his head.

------------------------MONK'S STAFF OF FIGHTING--------------------------------

<< From:  KL81@MARISTB >>

- It is normally a +2 Bo staff.

- Monks weild it as a +4 Bo staff.

- It creates a mystical forcefield around Monks which reduces their
  armor class by four and enables them to DODGE spells if they roll
  against the attack.  The field only covers 1 person.

- The force feild is on when the staff is held, but only if the user
  knows the command word.

- Once per day, the wielder can Call Lighting by tapping the
  staff on a surface, and invoking the command word.The spell is
  exactly like the priest spell, save that there needn't be any clouds
  about.  The spell equals that of a tenth level priest.

- This staff is made of Darkwood and two mythril shods, one on each
  end.  The command word for the staff can only be found in the direct
  study of it for 2 days.  The word is found in the arua of the object
  and takes time to decifer.  One needn't speak the word out loud, only
  the knowlage of the word and skill with the staff are needed.

-------------------------------THE AUSSIES--------------------------------------

<< From:  snurk!root@vax.cs.pitt.edu >>

                                               Init
Type          Cost  Weight  Size  Type  ROF  Modifier  Damage   Range
Normal         2gp    1#     S     S/P  1/3     4        1d6     30
3-pronged     15gp    1.5#   S    S(P)  1/3     4      1d8(+2)   40
Slayer      20,000     "     "     "   (spec) (spec)    (spec)  (spec)

The normal boomerang is the same kind everyone thinks of when they think of
Australia.   Its effective range is 30 yards, requiring 10 vertical yards and
5 more horizontal yards (to compleat the turn).  The weapon can be thrown
to hit on the way out, or on the return trip.  Both sides of one handle are
often sharpened, thus the slashing capability.  This will not return after
a successful hit.

The 3-pronged is one similar to the one from the movie "Krull".  It has 3
arms, with curved blades projecting from the ends.  When thrown, the PC must
state if he is throwing it to stab or slash.  If it hits as a slash, it has a
50% chance of returning as normal, an additional 25% chance of returning close
to the thrower.  If it is thrown to stab, if it hits, it does not return.
This weapon needs the same 10 yards vertical space, but turns in the 40 yards.

In both cases, 1/2 STR bonus to damage is applied.  This weapon requires 2
slots for each level of proficiency.  If only 1 is used, each throw has only
a 30% chance of returning to the thrower, and a 10% additional chance of
returning near the thrower.  If used by someone with no proficiency, Non-Prof
penalties are doubled.  With 1 slot used, normal penalties apply.

The Slayer is the same as the 3-prong, except it also has the following powers:
  o Limited telepathy with owner,

  o Unlimited flight time while owner concentrates, up to max range.

  o Capable of striking up to 4 targets, or 1 target 4 times,

  o On a nat20 and unless the owner specifically says not to, it delivers the
    equivalent of a lightning bolt as a 20th lvl spell.  (No bonus/penalty to
    saves)  This can be done once per day.  It only functions when thrown to
    pierce.

  o It has the same range (40), and is capable of hitting +1 extra target for
    each 10 yards less than 40. (5 at up to 30 yards, 6 up to 20 and 7 up to 10)
    It works basically like a pinball.

  o The owner can summon it to return to him up to 4 times in a row.  The range
    of the telepathy is 100 yards.  If it is just laying there, it returns on
    the first try (roll vs Int if you don't like that.).  If it successfully hit
    on a Piercing attack, Have the owner roll vs (STR + INT)/3 for it to
    successfully break free and return.

-----------------------------THE DRAGONGLOVES---------------------------

<< From:  ST101493@BROWNVM >>

Quantity: 12 pairs (6 for chromatic dragons, 6 for mettalic dragons)
Specific Purpose: Fight dragons (gain complete control over them)
Qualification: User must know the command word (see below)

    These gloves look completely ordinary and take on the respective
colors of the dragon species they are capable of dominating.  Tiamat's
glove is gray. The metallic gloves are made of mail from the same
metal as its respective dragon species.  Bahamut's glove is made of
platinum. Once the command word is spoken, however, they burst into
flames without hurting.  The fire is colored exactly like the
color of the gloves.  The fire itself is a kind of faerie fire  that
serves no purpose other than to let the dragons know who is wearing the
gloves/what they're dealing with.
     The command word is not constant.  It is the true name of the
oldest/most powerful dragon in exitence at the time.  When it is spoken,
the wearer gains total control over all dragons of that color.  This
adds the dimention that the wearer must find out the name of said dragon
without being crisped (insert menacing look here).  The idea behind it
is that if someone is good enough to find out the name of the dragon,
he/she has right to dominion over the followers of that dragon. There is
absolutely NO chance for the gloves to malfunction if in good condition
(which they are since they would have to be destroyed by magic even more
powerful than they! Eeek!)

Additional Powers:

Force Shield from Dragon Breath - at will of wearer; protects against
all types of dragon's breath; spherical in shape; 50' across; may be
placed centered up to 100' away from wearer of gloves (to protect
companions); duration: 2 rounds or the duration of the dragon breathing;
will NOT stop a dragon's flight...be careful not to place it directly in
front of it the shield will be useless.

Detect Dragon 5 mile radius (any color)
Dragon Breath Immunity (all colors)
All hand held weapons do double damage against dragons
+4 to hit in all cases (not only when dealing with dragons

NOTE: The author recognizes the power of the gloves. In his world, magic
is EXTREMELY rare, so these even the balance. He invites feedback on
them.

--------------------------------CAT'S CLAWS-------------------------------------

<< From:  KINSONV@CITADEL >>

Appearance:  Fine leather gloves that appear ordinary unless detect
  magic is cast.

- on command will sprout 2-3 inch razor sharp claws
- when index finger is inserted into a keyhole, the claw can be commanded
  to alter its shape to pick the lock
- allows the wearer to climb most surfaces with the grace/ease of a cat
- as a melee weapon, they do 3-7 damage each using the regular animal
  attack: claw, claw, bite (ignore the bite if you will)

-----------------------------CHAINMAIL OF THE FLAME PITS------------------------

<< From:  bard@cs.cornell.edu >>

Pretty potent stuff, as it makes many common attack forms very costly to
the attacker.

Blackened and blasted-looking chainmail, which stinks of smoke and
sulphur.  It touches the pits of Hell somehow.  It has no combat bonuses
per se, but it has these properties:
  * Everyone within 10' not somehow immune to smoke suffers a -2 penalty on
    combat and saving throw rolls, and so on.  (E.g., thieves do stuff at
    -10%, etc.)
  * Everyone within 2' takes 1-6 points fire damage every round.
  * Everything hitting the armor gets covered with flaming crud, somewhat
    more noxious than flaming tar.  It is rather a pain to get the crud off:
    a matter of a few hours' work with tools and vinegar to get it off of a
    sword.  Creatures with acid weapons can get it off their teeth in a few
    minutes; other creatures are in for either a long trip to the dentist or
    a few months of foul-tasting mouth.
    - Blunt weapons covered with crud do 2 points flame damage the first
      round, 1 the second, and no extra damage the third.  They are a pound
      or two heavier, as well.  Repeated hits put more crud on the weapon,
      making it stay at two points of flame damage for an extra 1-2 rounds
      per hit.
    - Pointed weapons do one point of flame damage for two rounds.  However,
      the tar blunts them; they lose half damage (for very pointy ones, like
      rapiers) to 1/4 damage (of not-so-pointy ones, like spears).  Repeated
      hits on the armor are cumulative, so a rapier will be useless after two
      hits and a spear after four.
    - Body weapons (claws, teeth, fists, etc) are effected as above.  Claws
      and teeth are sharp, usually.  The owner of the body takes 1-4 to 4-16
      points of fire damage (small claws get 1-4, large mouths get 4-16, vary
      these numbers as necessary.)
    - Other effects at the DM's judgement.

Note that the combat modifiers and the fire damage always get the wearer; the
armor is rather dangerous to wear without fire resistance.    It does not
confer fire resistance by itself; indeed, it would be antithetical to the
enchantment to make it do so.

-------------------------THE THREE ITEMS OF NEPHATAT--------------------

<< From:  BLHUBER@MTUS5 >>

(1)  The first, Nephatat's Fireball, is a scroll.  Read Magic will
reveal the name, but 'the scroll is too complicated for you to
comprehend.'  The typical wizard places the scroll in his backpack,
right next to his or her traveling spellbook.  That's were the magic
comes in.  When held within one foot of any written spell for longer
than one turn, the scroll releases all of the stored spell energy in a
spectacluar way:
     All of the combat spells go off centered on a random person
within twenty feet.  All of the non-combat spells explode for 1d4
damage per level of spell to the caster, and all items within 1'
(namely, the backpack) must save vs.  magical fire or be blown to
bits.  Note that all spellbooks and scrolls, including the NF scroll,
have no save if they were within 1' of the NF scroll.
     Not only does this heavily damage any mid-level mage, but he or
she then cannot memorize his or her spells.
<compiler's note: also good against monty hall mages *evil grin*>

(2)  The second item, Sting, is less dramatic.  (Believe it or not, I
made the name up myself.)  Sting is a dagger +3 of pain.  Any hit with
an 18 or greater causes the victim to save vs.  paralysis or be -2 to
hit for the rest of the combat due to the pain.  This made it the
favorite weapon of the halfling fighter/thief, and he used it to great
extent.  Unfortunately, that's not all there is to Sting.
     Sting is a semi-intelligent dagger.  It has a 13 INT and a 30
EGO(!)  because it has a secret purpose: Slaying paladins.  Sting will
stay hidden until it's user recognizes some paladin.  Then, it will
possess the user and attempt to backstab said paladin.  It gives the
wielder several powers to accomplish this task:

  1) The wielder can backstab as a thief of two levels higher.
  2) The pain effect is rolled three times, and minuses are cumulative.
  3) On a successful hit, the paladin must save vs death at -2 or die in
     two rounds from the pain, in which time he or she cannot act.
  4) After one strike, if the user believes that he or she has not been
     seen, Sting will have them resume their former activity and then
     cause all memory of the incident to be erased.  For all intents
     and purposes, the user is innocent.
     If, however, the user knows that he or she was seen, Sting suddenly
     drops control, and the user is confused for 1 round.

     The party with Sting in its midst returned to their wounded NPC
paladin ally and found him stabbed to death, and the halfling didn't
know any better.  He did know better, however, when he managed to
successfully backstab a paladin who was with six other extremely
high-level characters.  The party was incredibly lucky that the
paladin didn't die.

(3)  The third item is a crystal ball.  When found, it is is mounted
on a black oak base with a small gold nameplate.  On it is inscribed
the name, 'SoulStealer.'  It is apparently indestructable, as it will
weather anything the PC's can throw at it.
     Any wizard foolhardy enough to attempt to use this crystal ball
will find that it functions properly.  Until he or she locates the
intended scryee.  At that point, the scryee must make a save vs.
magic or his or her mind will be sucked into the crystal.  Then the
viewing wizard, with no saving throw, has his or her mind exchanged
for the one in the crystal.  At that point, the scryee is in control
of the viewer's body, and acts as he or she pleases.  Then, anyone who
even glances at the crystal, except for anyone who has been in it, has
his or her mind exchanged for the one currently in it.  Any mind in a
body that gets killed is dead, and the rightful mind cannot re-enter.
Any viewer who wishes to may fail to prevent their mind from entering
the crystal, and thus have a chance of entering the next viewer's
body.
     Eventually, there will be one mind in the crystal when all has
quieted down.  This soul cannot be freed by anything short of a wish.
After a mind has been in the crystal for one month straight, it will
die and move to the afterlife.

Important note:
     These last two items have a particlarly sneaky purpose.  If they
are both brought within 10' of a character with memorized or carried
spells, Sting will possess it's weilder to stab SoulStealer.  This has
the effect of releasing, as Nephatat's Fireball, all of these spells
within 20'.  It will not directly set off items, however.  After the
ensuing exposing, both Sting and Soulstealer will be slag.
     Since the explosion has Nephatat written all over it, the
characters may decide to track him down.  They will be dissapointed to
hear that he has been dead for one hundred years, after a certain
demigod found one of his items....

-------------------------VLADIMIRE'S WIG OF MAGES-----------------------

<< From:  KL81@MARISTB >>

   (okay, okay, its not REALLY a weapon but it is certainly humorous!)

"Greetings Lone-star....Oh, sorry, wrong flick.
     Well anyway, without futher adeu, the weapon that really belongs in
the Gallery of absurtity......." -- Thisslenot.

-can only be used by mages
-mages who are bald and pick up this relic, have the urge to put it
 upon their head
-covers up all bald spot's, and almost looks real
-adds a bonus to armor class by +1
-10% chance that any intellegent creature attacking the mage will be
 stunned by the absurtity of the wig on the mage (mage will assume that
 good fortune has looked upon him, and never suspect that the wig
 appears funny looking on him, no matter what anyone says he will assume
 that they are jealous).
-once per day, the mage can throw the wig and it will entangle an
 opponent in a Web spell.

History: Created by the great mage Vladimire (you remeber him, don't
you?) to appear that he still had a full head of hair.  His enchantments
went awary, and he created the wig.  When he died, the wig left in
search of any bald mage it could find (its part of the enchantment). It
appears as an ordinary brown haired wig.

-----------------------HULAHOOPS OF THE HOBBITS-------------------------

<< From:  KL81@MARISTB.BITNET >>

-there are five of these in existance, each with a different color
 scheme (red, green, blue, white and muave stripe, and purple with
 yellow pok-i-dots).
-all of the hulahoops can be used by any race, but get an extra bonus
 when used by hobbits.
-the basic abilities of the hulahoops is as follows:
  *when being used, the edges of the hulahoops become sharp, and can be
   used as if the wielder were proficient with the hulahoop, damage is
   equaled to that of a longsword.
  *can create a minor globe of invunerability once/day
-each hulahoop also has it's own special ability

 Red-can drill into the ground. Usually used to make hobbit holes.

 Blue-user can fly for 2 turns as a modern day helicopter.

 Green-can cut through any vegtable like a ginsu knife.

 White and muave-can be thrown in ring toss and NEVER niss.

 Purple and yellow-allows user to impress opposite sex at will.

-all hulahoops will shink to the size of a ring, at wielders will. Will
 automaticly agust to wielders ring size, so it can be worn.

History: The five hulahoops were created to make life easier for the
lazy hobbits.  The hobbits contracted their creation from a local mage.
The hulahoops were spread to different hobbit villages and continue to
help and entertain.  The hulahoops will apear, if found by adventurers, they
seem to be strange colored rings.  Upon inspection, the command words
will be found on the inside rim. When at full size they appear as normal
hulahoops.

-------------------THE BLOODY RED COIN OF MAYTYRDOM---------------------

<< From:  PARGWE@MOREKYPR.BITNET >>

(author's note: This is the most powerful RELIC in my posession.  Please
view it as it was intended.)


This is a very powerful, very deadly relic of the
God Reper (the God of Redemption).

It is a golden coin that has a red tint to it.  On one side
is a picture of a set of scales that are unequal.  The other
side shows the scales righted.

Along time ago, Reper looked apon the world and saw that for many
individuals, a simple act of redemption was not enough to cleanse
them of the harm that they did.

In order to give these few individual's a chance for redemption,
Reper created the -Bloody Red Coin of Maytyrdom-.

The one seeking redemption (and they MUST have committed some crime
that not even the Devil himself would appreciate, it must truly be
a terrible crime....) must have a very important, truly impossible
mission.  (ie, save the world from a Monster, and they are only 5th level
and they have no magic items.  The mission is one that they can not hope
to accomplish without the help from a hand full of gods....)

They must instead go on a quest to find the -Bloody Red Coin of Maytyrdom-.
(makes finding the Holy Grail look simple!).

When they finally find the coin, the one seeking redemption holds the coin
up to their face and say "I have done great wrong.  Let my life be redeemed
by accepting my life."

1 of 2 things/events happen:
1) the peaceful solution
Immediatly, the PC or NPC seeking redemption is filled with a great feeling
of relief and understanding.  Then, they retire from adventuring and the
world.  Usually, they return to their homeland and settle down, and live
for many years as quietly as possible...

2) the Bloody solution (for the TRULY EVIL of the EVIL)
Immediatly, the coin will begin to glow a clear blue light that is
awe-imspirng.  All allies are totally healed.  Lost limbs return.
Old PC's and NPC's grow younger.  Then, the one seeking redemption
is comsumed by a Fireball (5d6 damage to anyone/thing that tries to
save him/her. If a PC dies, they are revived [no penalities] in 2 rnds).
Then, the PC?NPC explodes into a gory mess (gross, to the extreme.
Blood, guts, brain, etc...  only for the sadistic DM).

Now, the truly wonderous event happens.  what ever FORCE/MONSTER?etc that
is threatening the world is instantly defeated by what ever means is
availible.  Reper often shows up himself to do the job.

Afterwards, the coin vanishes, to reappear in another deadly place.
Waiting for another brave soul to come in search of redemption....

------------------------MEDALLION OF DEADLY ARCHERY---------------------

<< From:  B1599142@BROWNVM.BITNET >>

The medallion of deadly archery is a large (seven inches in diameter) round
medallion of brass hanging on a brass chain.
At the center of the medallion is a brilliant bright-red hexagonal
gemstone about two inches across.  It is the color of fresh arterial blood.
Radiating out from the gem at precise sixty-degree angles from one another
are six shallow grooves which run perfectly straight out to six simple
(almost childish) pictographs, each about one inch tall, which run around
the rim of the medallion.  These are also cut to a shallow depth in the
brass.  The six pictographs correspond (clockwise from the top) to:
Accuracy, Traveling, Direction, Capture, Cloud, and Lightning.  When one of
six command words is spoken, a bright point of red light or energy races
from the gem up the groove to the pictograph which pulses once, firing a
small red energy-image of itself at the head of an arrow held ready.  This
image will glow on the arrowhead for one round and if the arrow is fired
during that round, one of the following will occur:

     Accuracy:  When the command word oxyolai (ahks-yo-LAY-ee) is spoken,
     the arrow will have the power to make small adjustments in mid-flight
     which greatly increase its chance to hit.  The arrow will be +6 to hit
     and will do one point of bonus damage for each five points or fraction
     of five points between the minimum needed to hit the target and the
     actual final roll, cumulative of bonuses.

     Traveling:  The command word abuheacs (a-boo-HEE-aks) will enable the
     archer to be instantly transported to wherever the arrow so
     ensorcelled has landed.

     Direction:  Uttering the command word sissmif (SISS-mif) and the name
     of a person, place, or thing, then firing the magicked arrow into the
     air will cause the arrow to transform into a fiery orange streak which
     will point in the direction of the object desired out to the limit of
     the archer's range and then persist for one turn.

     Capture:  When activated by the command saixgiva (sigh-iks-GEE-vah) an
     arrow will, when within ten feet of the target explode into a cobweb-
     like pattern of golden energy force-lines which will seek to entrap
     the target.  If the archer hits and the target saves vs Magic spell
     (device) it successfully dives aside or is only partially entangled
     (depending on the circumstances).  If the target fails, it is firmly
     entrapped in a mesh of iron-hard energy, although no damage accrues.
     This condition persists for 3-12 rounds.

     Cloud:  The command usbyopi (oos-bye-OP-ee) causes the arrow to
     explode on impact (causing half normal damage) into a Stinking Cloud
     of 10' diameter on the round of impact and 20' diameter on the second
     and subsequent rounds.  It will persist from 2-8 rounds, depending on
     wind conditions.  Those within the cloud must save vs Poison or suffer
     the effects of the second-level spell Stinking Cloud (cf magic-user
     spell in Player's Handbook).

     Lightning:  Use of the command agthizmi (ag-THIZ-mee) causes a small
     bolt of blue lightning to strike wherever the arrow lands (the arrow
     does full normal damage).  This bolt will due 4-16 points of lightning
     damage (half if save vs Breath/Dodgeable) to any creature in its path,
     which extends 20' back from the point of impact.

     Regardless of the function selected, the medallion is usable once per
     round.  Any of these powers will destroy the arrow used, so they
     should not generally be placed on already enchanted arrows.
     Furthermore, the medallion of deadly archery is a charged device.  It
     is currently at full power (36 charges) and each function uses one
     charge.  As charges are expended, the color of the central gem will
     fade from bright red toward faint frothy pink and finally absolutely
     clear when all charges are exhausted.  Fortunately, the medallion is
     rechargeable.  It must be dunked in the fresh blood of intelligent
     beings sacrificed with an obsidian knife (made by the archer himself)
     on the dark of the moon.  For each energy/experience level of persons
     so sacrificed, the  medallion will regain a little color and one
     charge.  Be sure to get all the blood out of the victim in order to
     get the full value of its levels.  If the medallion is ever completely
     drained of charges it will become an ugly piece of useless costume
     jewelry.

------------------THE CUBE OF THE NETHER PLANES-------------------------

<< From:  PFREY@DREW.BITNET >>

Use a d6 to determine which side is pressed.  All sides are
exactly the same and cannot be marked.

Charlies cube:
side:

If any item is removed from them, it will dissapate 1 round after
they return to the bag.  When they come out of the bag, they will
have it again.  Only 1 can be drawn each day, it takes 1 segment
to become their form.  They must commit a deed reflective of
their alignment.  They cannot be ordered back into the bag.  If
they are slain, no more of that type will be available.  If a
good character uses the bag, they are responsible for its
actions.  The bag will appear to be exactly like a bag of tricks
(ie: they feel fuzzy objects in the bag).  If their are no backs
to stab, locks to open, traps to find, pockets to pick, etc.,
they will return to the bag.  They cannot be prevented, other
than by force, to stop.  They can, however, be commanded to
return to the bag.
