You can have a lot of fun with draino.  No, not cleaning the tub, but building
bombs!  I'll show you my favourite method to have fun with draino.  First you're
gonna have to buy some stuff:

Crystal Draino
Plastic Pop Bottle (any size less than 2 litre)
Tin Foil

1) Okay, drink the pop and wash the bottle out.

2) Pour in some crystal draino untill it gets up to the bottem of the label.

3) Now pour in some water untill it gets to the top of the label.

4) Drop in a (few) ball of tin foil and cap the bottle TIGHTLY!

5) Shake and drop (throw) it somewhere F-A-S-T!

After you do step 4, the clocks-a-ticken.  You've got a few seconds( a minute
max) to drop it untill it blows.  When it does blow, watch it!  You'll hear a
very loud bang and draino will be everywhere.  Don't get the draino on you
because it will eat through your skin (read the label).

Now, why use less than a 2 litre bottle you ask?  Well, the bottle will get very
warm while the chemical reaction takes place, so while a smaller bottle will
allow for the build up of gas to blow up the bottle, anything like a 2 litre
will probably melt before it blows up.

what happens to you.  This file should only be used for educational purposes
