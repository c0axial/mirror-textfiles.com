TERRORISM, Its Goals, Its Targets, Its Methods, by Michael Connor.
What makes a terrorist behave as he does? Why does he pick the targets he
does? Where does he get financial and technological assistance to carry out
his mission?

Anti-terrorist consultant Michael Connor provides the answers to these
questions and others, and gives you insight into the ideologies of dozens
of terrorist groups around the world.

Personal protection measures you can take to minimize your risk of becoming
a target are also detailed in this book. Should all else fail and you are
at a terrorist's mercy, Connor tells you what to do if you're on a hijacked
aircraft or receive a mail bomb, as well as actions you SHOULD and should
NOT take in a hostage situation.

GETAWAY, Driving Techniques for Escape and Evasion, by Ronald G. Eriksen.
The majority of terrorist attacks, other than bombing and hijacking
aircraft, are often in the form of vehicle ambushes in lonely places -
especially if they want to take prisoners. In such an unpleasant situation,
you need to know what to do and how to do it very fast and efficiently.
This book, written by a veteran high-performance driver, teaches everything
you need to know about escape and evasion techniques with vehicles. This
book covers cornering, right-angle turns, S-turns, the "bootlegger's" turn,
the "moonshiner's" turn and others. Ramming procedures and tactics for
dealing with double-vehicle blockades are illustrated. Chapters include how
to detect surveillance and how to elude a tail. If you live or travel in
muslim territory, especially in or around the far-East trouble spots, this
information may be more important than your passport! (It may come in handy
at other times too, depending on what you do for a living.)

BY WAY OF DECEPTION, by Victor Ostrovsky & Clair Hoy
This book describes the shocking scope and depth of the Mossad's influence,
disclosing how Jewish communities in the U.S., Europe, and South America
are armed and trained by the organizations in secret "self defense" units,
and how Mossad agents facilitate the drug trade in order to pay the
enormous costs of its far-flung, clandestine operation. And it portrays a
network that has grown dangerously out of control, as internal squabbles
have led to the escape of terrorists and the pursuit of "policies"
completely at odds with the interests of the State of Israel.

In chilling detail, Ostrovsky asserts that the Mossad refused to share
critical knowledge of a planned suicide mission in Beirut, leading to the
death of hundreds of U.S. Marines and French troops. He tells how they
tracked Yasser Arafat by recruiting his driver and bodyguard; how they
withheld information on the whereabouts of American hostages, paving the
way for the Iran-Contra scandal; and how their intervention into secret
U.N. negotiations led to the sudden resignation of Ambassador Andrew Young
and the downfall of his career.

This book is the explosive chronicle of the author's experiences in the
Mossad, and of two decades of their frightening and often ruthless covert
activities around the world. Penetrating far deeper than "Every Spy a
Prince" it is an insider's account of Mossad tactics and exploits.

Victor Ostrovsky became disenchanted with the Mossad and resigned. This
book tells you why; about the Mossad's greed for power, lust, and total
lack of respect for human life. It also tells about the Mossad's
assassination teams, how they operate, the weapons and tactics they use. If
you wanted the real facts and details of the Mossad, this book tells all.
