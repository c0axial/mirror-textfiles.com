NOTE: All information here in is true, accurate, and functional. This
      series of SoftDocs isn't bullshit! Everything stated in this Doc and the
      others that will follow is correct as of writting this (January 1985).

Disclaimer: The use for which the information discussed here is put is solely
	    the responsibility of the person(s) reading this. Modifications
	    discussed here can be done legally if the proper permits are
	    obtained. Contact the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Fire-arms for
	    details.


Enough of this stuff, lets start........

Introduction :
-------------
	       This series of SoftDocs will examine, show, and describe methods
 by which you can modify or improve certain types of guns, ammunition, and exce
sories. Some methods will require diagrams which can not be draw by text, so yo
u'll need a good imagination. Also, some knowledge of guns and machining would
come in handy, although not absolutely neccessary.

Topics that will be discussed (in probable order of issue) are :

1) Selective fire modifications for some Semi-Auto guns
2) Silencers and suppressors
3) Scopes, viewers and sights
4) Ammunitions
5) Gun straps, harneses, stocks and the alike
6) Anyother good information I can pass along


Modes of Fire :
--------------
	       There are many ways by which a gun can shoot. These modes are im
poratnt terms used by all shooters and gunsmiths everywhere. Below is a list of
 these modes of fire :


1) Manual - In this mode of fire, you must put a single bullet into the gun, ch
amber it, and fire. Then to fire again, you must remove the spent bullet from t
he gun by hand and replace it with a new one. You must repeat this everytime yo
u wish to shoot. This is something like what had to be done with Muskets.

2) Semi-Auto  - In this mode, you load all the bullets the gun can handle at a
time into the gun, then just pull the trigger to fire ONE BULLET AT A TIME. You
 only fire one bullet every time the trigger is pulled. If you hold the trigger
 after firing, nothing will happen. You must let it go and then pull it again t
o refire. You only reload when all the bullets in the gun have been fired. Guns
 like this include hunting rifles, target shooting guns, revolvers (like the po
lice .38 special), and shot guns (pump guns only. Double barrel shoot guns are
"two shot" manual-fire).

3) Full Auto - In this mode, you load like in Semi-Auto, except that when the t
rigger is held, the gun will continue to shoot so long as the trigger is held i
n the firing postion, Shooting stops when you let go of the trigger or you run
out of bullets. Machine guns are Full Auto.

"Burst" - This mode is something like Full Auto, but now so "FULL". When the tr
igger is pressed, the gun will fire a burst of bullets. This burst can be any a
mount depending on the type of gun. For example, if you had the millitary issue
 of the M-16 assault rifle, it would have this setting, and fire about 4 to 6 b
ullets (depending on the year it was made) per burst. You must, however, releas
e the trigger and then repull it to fire another burst again (like in Semi-Auto
).

"Selective Fire" - While this isn't a true mode of firing, it should be on this
 list. Selective Fire means that you can choose which type of firing you want y
our gun to do. There is a level or switch on the gun with the possible choices
marked on it. Only military guns have this as standard-issue. The only way to g
et this on a civilian gun is to put it in yourself (which is what later issues
of this SoftDoc will tell you how to do!).


The Law :
--------
	       According to Federal law, it is illegal for a common civilian to
 own a Full Auto gun. Further more, it is illegal for you to modify a Semi-Auto
 gun to Full Auto or Selective Fire without filing for the proper permit(s) wit
h the Bureau of Alcholo Tobacco and Firearms (BATF as it will be called in this
 SoftDoc series) prior to modification. This is why guns like military issue M-
16's or Uzi Machine guns can't be bought or owned by a civillian (I know in the
 movie "The Terminator", the guy went into a gun shop and got a Full Auto Uzi,
but that's only in the movies!). Just being in POSSESION of the materials that
would modify a gun to full-auto or Selective Fire is illegal. It's also illegal
 to have done partial modification on a gun. For example, if you intend to make
 a Selective Fire H&K 91 out of a Semi-Auto H&K 91, but only went as far to mod
ify the hammer or the receiver, and even though the gun still works only in the
 Semi-Auto mode, you still have broken the law.

		Possesion of the materials to make a silencer or suppressor is
just as illegal as having a whole one (even if you don't own a gun!). Still, I
think it's a neccessary chance you should take. You never know when a silencer
or suppressor can come in handy, not to mention saving your life! I'm not telli
ng you you must go out and make a silencer or suppressor, I just think having o
ne may be a good idea. Just don't show it to anyone else (even the guys at the
shooting range), and try not to have it on your person if you would be going an
ywhere there may be a securtity check (frisk, pat-down search, etc.) made on yo
u. A word to the wise is sufficiant.


But......  :
------------
	       Since many gun collectors wanted to have Full Auto and Selective
 Fire guns, the BATF allowed them to be sold to the general public so long as t
hey were made to only be able to fire in *Semi-Auto* mode. That means you can g
o into a gunshop and buy a M-16, AR-14, Ruger 10, Uzi, or any other "military s
tyle" gun, but it will be in Semi-Auto firing configuration.

	       Also, a few other points had to be re-adjusted. The major one is
 that the barrel length MUST be a MINIMUM of 16 inches long. This is the minimu
m barrel length for a gun to be classified a rifle. Any shorter, even if its on
ly 1 inch shorter, the gun is classified a handgun. Thus, while the overall gun
 will look the same as the military issue, the barrel length may seem overly st
range. A perfect example is the  Uzi carbine. It looks and (as we shall see) is
 the same gun as the Israeli Army or the Presidents' Secret Service carries, ex
cept for firing only in a Semi-Auto mode and a 16 inch barrel (with does distra
cted from the beauty of the weapon). There is some good to this however. The lo
nger the barrel, the better your accuracy when aiming and the greater chance of
 hitting what or where you aimed at. Still, guns with overly long barrels do lo
ok rather funny and misshaped, but thats the law!

	       Cutting the barrel down is a Federal crime so be ware. Again, cu
tting down the barrel will make the gun a handgun, so the proper licences shoul
d be optained, unless you want to take the chance. (If you do, Good Luck!)


Extras :
-------
	       To the best of my knowledge, there aren't any restrictions on th
e extra equipment you can put on a gun, such as scopes, stocks, camoflouge tape
, etc. You could even add a night scope, if you can afford it!

NOTE: In the case of the Uzi pistol, MAC 10, MAC 11 or Uzi Machine pistol (also
 known as The Micro Uzi), it is illegal to put a folding stock on these guns. C
heck with the BATF for full details.

Lend A Helping Hand :
--------------------
	       Since government is continually trying to restrict guns in ANY s
tyle or firing mode, it would greatly help to prevent such actions if you joine
d a gun club, preferably a national organization like The American Rifle Associ
ation. Still, a local club is better than none at all. Not only will you help t
o prevent restrictions, but you will learn quite a bit from a club and its' mem
bers. You may also make some "connections" that could prove to be very valuable
 in the future. I'm NOT telling you that to have a gun you must join a club, it
's just that if you are new to guns, then a club could best help to get you sta
rted and your membership will help the gun-owners community as a whole.
Ask at your local gun dealer about any clubs in your area.


Wrapping Up :
------------
	       I hope this introduction has informed you and that you will read
 and pass on this and the other SoftDocs in this series.

	       I'm sure your all saying,"But what are those permits and licence
s he talked about so much?".

Well here they are :

1) For the Uzi pistol (Semi-Auto or machine), MAC 10, MAC 11 and all the other
hand-style guns, a regular handgun permit is needed from the town or city in wh
ich you live.

2) For a rifel or shoot gun, all you need is to be at or over the minimum age f
or owning one in your city, and have a rifle permit. (Its ALOT easier to get th
an a handgun permit!) Even if you intend to use it for self or home protection
or your out to kill someone (I have nothing against vigilanteism), then you sho
uld also get every year a hunting licence and take the Hunter Safety Course. No
, i'm not trying to be funny. Its a fact that if you kill someone with your gun
 and when the cops get you, you will have a far easier time convincing them tha
t you are a hunter and that your gun is for hunting, not killing people (even i
f that is why you got the gun in the first place) if you can show then that you
 have a VALID hunting licence and have taken the Hunter Safety Course, which by
 the way is pretty much obvious stuff that a two-year-old could figure out like
 don't leave your gun lying around loaded, don't let your friends handle your g
un while its loaded, and don't clean your gun while its loaded.

3) If you want to get Federal permission to modify your gun to selective fire,
then you must file the BATF Form 1 and pay a $200 tax. Also, expect a long wait
 to get your permit and don't (for g-d sakes!), don't apply if you have anythin
g in your life or past to hide, because they'll search your whole pasted since
the day you were born until the time of filing and if they find anything they d
on't like then you get a big fat reject notice and you'll have lots of trouble
getting your $200 back!

4) If you intend to modify a gun illegally, then go ahead. I won't try to convi
nce you to stop. Like my father would have said, "If you want to do it, then do
 it. Just don't get caught!" Just use common sense and don't blow your cool whi
le and after doing it.

5) Check with your local gun dealer to find out EXACTLY what you need to get a
gun licence (rifle as well as hand gun) in your area.


Well that wraps it up for this issue.

Until then, keep your finger on the trigger and keep your head low!
