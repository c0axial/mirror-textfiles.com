get more heat; break a foolproof lease; beat a landlord in court; wipe out

THE GOOD BOOZE RECIPE AND COOKBOOK, by James C. Krohn, Ph.D.

"shine" one of the smoothest drinks you've ever tasted. It's easy to make,

involved and the techniques to produce your own clear sugar alky. This is
the stuff you can flavor and then "cut" to create whatever potion you
prefer. Make gin, bourbon, vodka, scotch, or orange or coffee-flavored
liqueurs. Krohn includes a helpful appendix of equipment and supplies and
offers advice on how to mix great drinks with your good booze.
(The "cooking" part in the title is in the distillation of the alky.)

                         Almost Free Legal Advice
                       and Do-It-Yourself Legal Kits

Anyone who can read this CrimeFighter catalog can prepare standard-form
legal documents when they take the time to read the simple, but detailed,
step-by-step instructions and use samples as a guide to fill in the blank
forms. That's the idea of do-it-yourself Kits. There are "dozens" of such
Kits -- for all kinds of common, everyday legal documents. Incorporation
Kits are the most popular, but there are many others also available.
Ten such Kits are mentioned below for your thoughtful consideration.

You realize, I'm sure, lawyers don't do the clerical work. They have their
secretaries use their word processors to plug in names and addresses on the
multitude of forms they have in their data bank. What you are really paying
for is a lawyer's legal advice. That may be worth $100 to $200, if you feel
you need legal advice.

A smarter option is to get your legal advice separately -- for $10 to $20!
Then get a do-it-yourself Kit for about $30. Fill in your own name and
addresses on standard-wording forms that are used by legal secretaries and
paralegals.
                 Almost Free Legal Advice - If you Need it

Local Bar Associations in every city in North America (Canada included),
has a special deal for you: a half hour of a lawyer's time for a maximum
fee of just $10 to $20. The charge is minimal to discourage free-loading,
but affordable to encourage you to make appointments. The cost varies from
city to city and depends on the local economy and affluence of the region.

The deal is an introductory offer. It's to encourage you to talk to a
lawyer to discuss your problem; to evaluate the lawyer before you commit
yourself to (perhaps) thousands of dollars of work; and for the lawyer to
assess your problem and suggest a solution and his fee for same. If you're
satisfied with the interview and decide to retain the lawyer, you know what
it will cost and can start the work by paying a retainer up front.

On the other hand, you aren't committed if you decide to talk to another
lawyer for another opinion and price. That lets you shop for a lawyer you
feel comfortable with in regards to personality, attitude, rates, etc. As a
business person, that's always a smart idea: to shop for the best deal.

For most common legal documents, the lawyer provides routine information
called "advice": and the secretary does the work! You usually don't need a
high-priced lawyer to type your name and address on simple, standard legal
forms. In fact, paralegals in most states do the same thing at a fraction
of the cost of a lawyer-prepared documents. However, in some states and
Provinces, paralegals are severely restricted in providing services to the
public. (Guess who made those laws!)

The bottom line is, if all you have is a simple question or two, and the
answers are a yes or no, or standard information relevant to the documents,
all it costs is $10 or $20 maximum.  There's no need to visit a lawyer at
standard rates of $125 to $175 an hour just to ask the "routine" questions.

Use the Bar Association referral service. It's listed in the Yellow Pages
of your phone directory under LAWYERS or ATTORNEYS. Call them, get the name
of a lawyer who specializes or has experience in the services you need.

Call the lawyer, tell him the Bar Association gave you his name. (That puts
him on notice he can't (shouldn't) charge more than the Bar Association has
promised you. It entitles you to no more than half an hour of the lawyer's
time in answering questions. It does not include any work that entails
research or preparation of documents. It's mainly to give you personal and
legal advice about your problem, and to quote a fee for doing the work.

The best deal for intelligent people is to obtain legal advice separately
via this special deal from Bar Associations (when you feel you need it).
Use a well-prepared Kit and do your own work and save hundreds of dollars.

Said Kits have samples of filled-in forms; preprinted forms with blank
spaces for names and addresses, etc.; and instructions for each step (plus
relevant comments that, if given verbally in their office, is called legal
advice and will cost you about $200; and a set of preprinted forms with
blank spaces where you fill in the blanks with your own names, addresses,
dates, and other relevant information.

I've found a legal publisher who has authored NINE different Kits. The
publisher has been in business since 1976 -- plenty of time to make them
perfect as they can be from feedback from tens of thousands of satisfied
users. Besides being the most complete Kits I've seen (and I've used dozens
of such Kits during the last 30 years) the author provides a TOLL FREE HELP
LINE which can be used to ask any question regarding any of the Kits he has
prepared. (That doesn't mean "legal advice", so don't ask for it.)

The Kits are designed for legal use in all 50 States. The instruction
manual that comes with with each Kit mentions any difference in law and the
state's requirements -- if they are different from the standard forms.

Instead of listing each and every form in all of the different Kits, I'll
just say these Kits are complete in every detail, well-prepared and
suitable for anyone who can read and follow simple instructions. As a
bonus, you'll learn about the law and how to do-it-yourself from then on,
for the rest of your life. That can save you thousands of dollars.

                                 The Kits

(1) The Non-Profit Corporation Kit provides all of the Forms required to
incorporate a Non-Profit Organization as either a Membership or Non-
Membership Corporation, or as a private Foundation.

A booklet that comes with it contains an Instruction Guide plus samples of
filled-in forms. A separate package in the Kit contains preprinted forms
for all occasions with blank spaces for names and addresses etc.
(Recommended for incorporating CrimeFighters lodges.)
Kit # 1, Non-Profit Kit, $29.95


(2) The Corporation Kit is prepared for American small business
corporations. (Recommended for a Crimefighters' Private Investigation
business to limit liability from lawsuits, bankruptcy, and to provide many
fringe benefits of being an "employee" of your corporation.
Kit # 2, Business Incorp. $26.95


(3) The Living Trust Kit is a low-cost option to the many lawyer sponsored
seminars that feed you just enough information to encourage you to use a
Living Trust and sell their services at $1,000 or more to do it for you.
By comparison, the booklet takes the place of the seminars (and is printed
for future reference). The preprinted forms and samples takes the place of
a lawyer's secretary. With this Kit, you can do it yourself for just $15!

The Kit includes a Will for the many things that may not be included in the
list of assets. (A lawsuit award for wrongful death from an accident (for
negligence), for example, paid to your estate after your death is not in
the living trust.)

The A-B Trust (Above and Below ground) is a revocable trust while you are
alive and in charge, and automatically legally transfers title of your
assets to the person(s) named in the trust when you die.

The main purpose of a Trust is to avoid Probate fees and inheritance taxes,
but it also provides a guaranteed legal disposal of your assets to the
people you want. The Trust is outside of a Will. It avoids legal battles
over Wills by disgruntled heirs. Greedy lawyers often milk an estate dry
before they "settle" the estate. Living Trusts can avoid that problem.

If you are divorced or separated from your spouse, and have children, a
Living Trust is essential.  If you have no Will or Trust, disposition of
your estate is in the hands of the court. In most cases, your estate will
be passed to your legal spouse, not the person whom you may want to have
it. If you have just a Will, it will be probated in court. First, lawyers
will dip into the estate for Probate and other fees. The judge may decide
to ignore the wishes of the deceased and give certain assets to whom he
believes deserves it. If you were alive you might disagree. When you're
dead, you can't do anything about it.

Beat them to the draw! A living trust lets you control your assets while
alive, and positively transfers ownership to the persons named in the
trust when you die. You, not lawyers or judges, are in Control when you
have a Living Trust.  Kit # 3, Living Trust  $14.95.


(4) A Living Will Kit is the companion to a Living Trust. A Living Will is
needed when you are permanently injured and can't care for yourself. It
allows you to designate someone to take care of you and your assets when
you can no longer make the decisions or pay the bills. The Kit has forms
with provisions for requesting the withholding of specific life support
procedures that may unnecessarily prolong your life and discomfort for
yourself and loved ones.  Kit # 4, Living Will  $7.95.


(5) A Regular Will Kit. If you don't need or want a Living Trust (that
includes a Will) this Kit is a no-frills do-it-yourself Will Kit. The
booklet with detailed explanations is worth $13.
Kit # 5, Simple Will  $12.95


(6) Partnership Agreements for a business that isn't incorporated. In a few
cases, a legal partnership may provide some advantages over a corporate
entity. The smaller cost (no state incorporating fees or annual reporting
fees) is a consideration, but a minor one. There are also many drawbacks to
Partnerships which are to numerous to mention in this book. Before you form
a legal business partnership, be sure to compare the pros and cons of each
type of business organization. If you decide a legal partnership is the
best for you, here's a Kit that can save you a few hundred dollars in legal
fees.  Kit # 6, Business Partnership  $19.95


(7) Pre-Marriage Agreements are standard fare for rich people. If you're a
person lucky enough to have a small fortune tucked away or invested, there
are lots of people who marry for money only. You may be a target. This may
be O.K. if you're aware of it, but it could be a disaster if your spouse
of a few months were to sue for divorce and then ask for a huge alimony or
cash settlement far out of proportion to the benefits of a short honeymoon.
That's where pre-marriage agreements come in. They avoid that problem.

Pre-Marriage Agreements usually stipulate that all assets that belong to
each spouse before marriage belongs to the original owners after divorce
(or death) and are not "joint property" because of marriage as it might be
considered in many states. Having such an agreement may save your marriage
as well as your money. With pre-marriage agreements, gold-diggers aren't
interested, or are diverted to suckers who don't insist on such agreements.
Kit # 7, Pre-Marriage Agreement  $12.95


(8) Bankruptcy Kits are the last resort in a financial crisis. Bankruptcy
is when your debts exceed your assets and ability to pay all your debtors.
In some cases, debtors my force bankruptcy on you. In other situations, you
may decide to declare bankruptcy to get your debtors off your back; to
start all over again with a clean sheet and no debtors.

There are many books on bankruptcy that provide detailed instructions and
some have tear-out forms. The problem with books of this nature is, they're
often out of date and include obsolete forms and other information.

The Bankruptcy Kits by this legal publisher have the same information as
some books, but is guaranteed to be up to date in all aspects. There are
samples of filled-in forms and all the preprinted forms you need to do-it-
yourself. Just fill in the blank spaces with personal information and file
the papers yourself. That can save you about $200 in legal fees.

Kit # 8 Bankruptcy under Chapter 7  (Wipes out personal debts)  $27.95

Kit # 9 Bankruptcy under Chapter 13 has a monthly payment plan to stop
foreclosures, garnishments, repossession and trustee sales with a court-
approved monthly payment schedule  $27.95


(10) A Do-It-Yourself Litigation Kit.  This one is under development by
CFI. It should be ready for delivery by Jan '94. Details are in CRIMFTR1
FloppyBook. Prepublication price is $20. After publication price will be
$29.95. Order now, and save $10.
