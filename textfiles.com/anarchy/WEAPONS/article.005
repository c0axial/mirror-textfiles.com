                        General Information
    Olersin Capsicum, or OC is an natural extract made from common Chili
  peppers. In manufacture, the chilis are boiled in a solvent and the oil is
  distilled out. The oil, a red syrupy liquid, is then mixed with  alcohol,
  water, or any one of a number of liquids and packages in small pressurized
  cans for use in law-enforcement and self defense. Natural in origin, it is
  both less damaging and more effective than CS or CN teargas. It causes phy-
  sical incapacitation with temporary blindness, difficulty breathing, and
  extreme pain as its main effects. It can be washed away with water, though
  its effects remain for up to 30 minutes afterward. As a chemical for crowd
  control, self-defense, and law enforcement, it is excellent. Since it is
  a liquid, it can be put into cans, sprayers, bombs, etc for use in many
  situations. It is legal to posess in personal-defense sprayers, though
  the Department of Justice has yet to approve it to the public for use
  against humans. It can, however, be sold for use against dogs and other
  vicious animals. In California and some other states, a permit from the
  pest control board may be "required." Though it has proven itself to be
  a very safe, non-lethal weapon, it's legal status is still pending.



                         Manufacture of OC Gas

   Materials:
              (1) Electric Hot Plate
              (1) Medium sized pot w/lid
              (1) 3-4 cup heatproof Cup
              (2) 16oz bottles Alcohol (91% Isopropyl is good)
              (1) 1 Pound Grond Chili Pepper Seeds, or Ground HOT Chilis
              (1) 100ml of Light Mineral Oil (i.e. Baby oil type)


  Procedure:

     1. Obtain all of above materials. Place the chilis in the pan and pour
     in the alcohol.

     2. Set up the hotplate and boil (With the Lid on!) for 30 minutes.

     3. At the end of 30 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and pour off
     the liquid part into the cup. It should be a dark red liquid at this
     point. Take the solid part and either boil it again in fresh alcohol to
     get the last bit of oil out, or discard.

     4. Place the cup in a pan with about 1/2" of water in it and begin heating
     on the hotplate. Boil the red liquid until there is only a few teaspoons
     of thick, red liquid.

     5. The thick red liquid is the Olersin Capsicum. Mix this witH 100ml or so
     of light mineral oil to form a thin, sprayable liquid.


    This mixuture can be loaded into misters, squirtguns, paint sprayers, fire
 extinguishers, bombs, etc. It is most effective when sprayed into the face of
the target, and will cause immediate blindness, hard breathing, extreme pain,
and general loss of function. It is suggested that the reader experiments with
this mixture before depending on it in an emergency. While not quite as good
as commercially made OC Gas, this mixture performs well in many forms. Enjoy.
