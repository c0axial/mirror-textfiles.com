   hI GUN LOVERS! hERES A NICE LITTLE INSTRUCTIONAL FILE TO HELP ALL YOU WOULD BE MACHINE GUN ENTHUSISTS OUT THERE TO GET YOUR HANDS ON A NICE FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPON FOR HOME DEFENSE, HUNTING, KEEPING THOSE DAMN CATS FROM SHITTING IN THE BUSHES ETC. 
TC.  
 oK, DOWN TO BUISNESS, HERES WHAT YOU'LL NEED: 
 1- sEMI-AUTO GUN (MOST PREFERABLY A SEMI-AUTO VERSION OF A SUBMACHINEGUN, THE mAC-10 IS IDEAL AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE BASED ON THAT MODEL, YOU MAY HAVE TO EXPERIMENT WITH OTHER GUNS...) 
 1- sET OF TOOLS THAT YOU USE TO COMPLETELY STRIP YOUR WEAPON (USUALLY JUST A FEW SCREWDRIVERS) 
 1- hACKSAW  
 1- eLECTRIC GRINDER OR HAND METAL FILES (optional) 
 1- pOWER dRILL 
 1- gUN BLUING KIT (optional) 
 1- dIAGRAM (BLUPRINT) OF THE GUN INTERNAL WORKINGS (OPTIONAL BUT HELPS ALOT FOR YOU DUDES WHO DONT KNOW A DISCONNECTOR FROM A TRIGGER SEAR) 
 
 oK, NOW TO THE FUN SHIT. sTRIP THE WEAPON APART AND GET THE LOWER RECEIVER (THE PIECE WITH THE TRIGGER AND SHIT ATTACHED). mETHOD 1 TO MAKE THE GUN FULL-AUTO IS MODIFYING THE TRIP. fIRST, IDENTIFY WHICH PART IS THE TRIP. iF YOUR LOOKING AT THE TOP O
 THE GUN, WITH THE REAR OF THE GUN POINTED TOWARD YOU, THE TRIP IS THE PIECE STICKING UP FROM AROUND THE FIRST CROSS BAR. iF ITS TAKEN OUT ITS SHAPED LIKE THIS:                   
                          *

(sORRY FOR THE CRUDENESS OF THE DIAGRAM, THERE AINT A HELL OF ALOT YOU CAN DO WITH ascii GRAPHICS) 
 nOW YOU HAVE TO CUT OR GRIND AWAY ABOUT HALF THE UPPER CONTACT LOBE OF THE TRIP. tHE UPPER CONTACT LOBE IS THE THINNER BIT OF IT STICKING UP THAT CONTACTS THE UPPER RECEIVER (THE PART DEPICTED BY THE % SYMBOL ON MY SHITTY DIAGRAM). cUT AT AN ANGLE P
RALLEL TO THE LOWER EDGE OF THE LOBE (CONNECT THE DOTS FROM THE ASTERIXES i PUT ON THE PICTURE AND CUT ON THE DOTTED LINE...)  
 rEASSEMBLE AND viola!!! iT'S HOSIN' TIME!! wARNING: YOUR GUN IS NOW FULLY AUTOMATIC (FULL AUTO only, NO SEMI AUTO AT ALL) AND VIOLATES A SHITLOAD OF VARIOS STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS... IF YOU GET CAUGHT YOUR SHIT OUTTA LUCK BECAUSE THE UPPER CONTACT LO
E JUST DOESNT DEMATERIALIZE...  
 bUT WHAT IF YOUR OUT THERE SAYING "hEY wARLOK YOU IDIOT!!! tHERES THIS PIECE OF METAL WELDED ON THE LOWER RECEIVER THINGIE STOPPING ME FROM TAKING THE PARTS OUT!!!" wELL MY FREINDS, THAT IS WHATS CALLED THE SEMI-AUTOMATIC CARRIAGE. iTS PUT THERE BY 
UR BUDDIES AT THE FIREARM AND TOBBACO OFFICE IN d.c. tHIS NUISANCE IS EASILY REMOVED BY DRILLING OUT THE WELDS ON THE LOWER RECEIVER AND PULLING IT OUT (dONT DRILL ALL THE WAY THRU THE LOWER RECEIVER THOUGH, LOTS OF LITTLE HOLES THROUGH THE GUN LOOK 
IKE SHIT AND MAY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE)  
 oK, METHOD 2 OF THE DO-IT-YOURSELF RAMBOMATIC ADJUSTABLE KILLING DEVICES (tm): dISCONNECTOR MODIFICATION.  
tHE DISCONNECTOR IS THE PIECE JUST IN FRONT OF THE TRIP WITH THE LITTLE BAR STICKING OUT THAT THE TRIP SLAMS AGAINST. 
 lOOKS LIKE THIS: (OH NO, NOT ANOTHER ascii DIAGRAM.. >SIGH<)

 oK, HERES WHAT YA DO: cUT THE BAR OFF FAR ENOUGH SO THAT THE TRIP CAN'T MAKE CONTACT WITH IT. (USUALLY ABOUT 1/3 OF THE LENGTH FROM THE FREE EDGE). aS BEFORE CUT FROM THE ASTERIXES... 
 aLSO, MAKE A SMALL NOTCH ABOUT MID-CENTER OF WHATS LEFT OF THE BAR FOR THE TRIGGER SPRING (THAT LITTLE ANNOYING WIRE THATS PROBLY BEEN GETTING IN YOUR WAY) TO REST IN SO IT DOESN'T SLIDE OFF THE SHORTENED DISCONNECTOR BAR. 
 rEASSEMBLE AND YOU ARE NOW THE PROUD OWNER OF A 9MM SWISS CHEESE MAKER. iF YOUR CAUGHT BY THE FEDS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THEM THE GUN "BROKE" BUT DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. 
 
   tips and hints: 
 1) aLWAYS FIND A PLACE TO SAFELY TEST YOUR GUN TO MAKE SURE THE MODIFICATIONS WORKED. pREFERABLY SOMEWHERE FAR FAR AWAY FROM SPECTATORS. iF IT didn't WORK THEN MAYBE YOU DIDN'T FILE OFF ENOUGH OF THE TRIP OR THE DISCONNECTOR BAR.. EXPERIMENT! 
 2) fOR LONGER WEAPON LIFE, FINISH THE EXPOSED EDGES LEFT BY CUTTING, GRINDING, DRILLING ETC. WITH GUN BLUING. tHIS PREVENTS RUSTING AND CORROSION.  
 3) iF YOU PLAN ON BULLSHITTING A COP THAT CATCHES YOU (i DON'T ENVY YOU) don't FINISH THE WEAPON WITH BLUING. tHE GUN MAY HAVE BROKE, BUT UZIS DON'T COAT THEMSELVES WITH PROTECTIVE FINISH.... 
 4) gETTING (OR FINDING OUT WHERE YOU CAN GET) SPARE PIECES FOR THE GUN IN CASE YOU SCREW UP AND/OR WANT TO MAKE YOUR GUN LEGAL AGAIN SOMETIMES IS A VERY GOOD IDEA. 
 5) hAVE FUN!!!
