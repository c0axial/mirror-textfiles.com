                         CrimeFighters' FloppyBook

The following chapters have over 400 hard-to-find books and videos that
contain unusual but useful information for those who decide to fight the
War on Crime. (There's a few books on other subjects too!)

If you've read "CrimeFighters" electronic book, and know all about generous
federal rewards and incentives, press F9 now for next chapter.

If you haven't read it, here's some information on what "Crimefighters" is
all about, and how to get a copy.

                                * * * * * *

CRIMEFIGHTERS - The New Breed of Bounty Hunters, by William B. McGhee.
The guts of this unusual book is based on federal rewards currently
available. One such law (Title 18, 3059) pays up to $25,000 for information
leading to the ARREST of "any felon in any state". Another DEA reward law
(Title 18, 886) pays up to $25,000 as a bonus reward if it's drug-related!
These two alone can make you rich when you join in the fight on the war
against drugs. (Do you know any drug dealers in your area?)

In addition, RICO laws (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations) may be
applied if the felony was committed for profit, which the majority are.
RICO is a very important CrimeFighter law because it provides for up to 50%
of any fines and forfeitures collected to be paid to CrimeFighters. The 50%
is in addition to specific rewards based on 3059, 886 or based on many
other laws. As you know, there's a federal law for each felony violation -
and a reward to match. This book covers them all!  Choose your field of law
enforcement, go after the perp's, and get paid huge rewards!

RICO law also provides for both civil and criminal suits - either one or
both can be used to lay charges and prosecute. Civil suits are "remedial"
whereas criminal suits are "punitive". Thus a civil suit and a criminal
suit doesn't involve "double jeopardy". If you lose one, you can still try
the other - or both!

RICO has provisions to levy appropriate fines and forfeitures on everything
a lawbreaker owns - if they are suspected of being the "fruits of criminal
activity" - and the burden of proof is on the defendant!  Any business that
launders dirty money may also be forfeited! If there's big money involved,
that's almost a certainty. Laundering dirty money via a legitimate business
is the only practical way to legally receive a reportable income.

The crook's valuable possessions may have been purchased from a lifetime of
criminal activity, but if you nail him on a felony charge, you can go after
everything he owns that he can't prove to the court's satisfaction was
purchased with "honest" money - and you get half!

Civil vs criminal suits: In civil suits, the evidence need only be a
preponderence of evidence (the best argument) not proof beyond a reasonable
doubt as in a criminal suit. In civil suits, only two-thirds of the jury
need to vote "guilty", as opposed to a unanimous verdict from all jurors in
a criminal suit. In criminal suits, maximum fines are set by law according
to the violation. In civil suits, there is no limit: it can be whatever
seems to match the violation - which may be in the MILLIONS of dollars!

Civil suits are the easiest to win and should be tried first - when the
lawbreaker is a corporation or has considerable assets to pay large fines,
or has assets used in the violation which can be forfeited (airplane,
boats, vehicles, cash and jewelry, bank accounts, businesses, etc.).

To avoid a state prosecutor's plea bargaining doing you out of a suitable
reward, you can elect to be the prosecutor! Qui Tam law is explained in a
separate chapter. It tells you how tipsters (CrimeFighters) are entitled by
law to assume the role of state or federal prosecutor -- to protect their
financial interests. Thus, you can become the D.A. for your own cases!

You don't have to be a lawyer. Plea bargaining is simply haggling between
the prosecutor and the lawbreaker's lawyer to reach a compromise, usually
over a cup of coffee. Ninety percent of cases are settled by plea bargain-
ing and won't go to trial. For the first one or two, you can hire a lawyer
to teach you plea bargaining and court sentencing procedure. When you know
simple sentencing procedure, you can handle cases yourself. Then you can
use plea bargaining to your advantage - to maximize fines and forfeitures!

Lawbreakers will, if they can, "buy" their way out of jail to avoid a
criminal record if they don't already have one. If the lawbreaker is a
corporation or someone with lots of money, the CrimeFighter (as the D.A.)
can (when legally possible) downgrade the charge to a misdemeanor and
minimize criminal charges if the lawbreaker agrees to pay large fines
and/or forfeitures in a related civil suit. If lawbreakers have few assets
or there is no agreement, a criminal suit can be used as the alternative to
punish the perp by recommending maximum punishment, giving them a criminal
record, and perhaps jail time so you can collect federal (felony) rewards.
You have a choice - they don't!  In any other situation it would be called
blackmail. But, plea bargaining (deals) are made all the time. It's legal!

When plea bargaining is used in criminal suits and an agreement is reached
it won't go to trial. You get a fast and easy "conviction" and collect your
reward(s), plus fines and forfeitures if any. If no agreement is reached
for a guilty plea, you turn the case over to a federal prosecutor and let
them handle it. If they get a conviction, you still get your negotiated
rewards - and a share of fines of forfeitures, if any.

When the evidence is iron-clad, it may be advantageous to use both a civil
suits for large fines and forfeitures, and a criminal suit for additional
fines and forfeitures (if you missed any on the first round) plus federal
rewards that require a conviction on felony charges.

A chapter explains how anyone can make a citizens arrest, and all the
things you need to know to make it stick. But, all rewards are paid for
information leading to the arrest and/or conviction. You don't have to
personally make the arrest. But, it may help to know what to do when
there's no cops handy and you'll lose the reward if they get away. If you
have the balls to be a soldier, cop, security guard or mercenary, you've
got what it takes to be a CrimeFighter! The CrimeFighter book tells you how
to collect huge rewards. This Catalog tells you where to get the kind of
training you need for your selected crime fighting specialty.

CrimeFighters work only with federal agents (mainly the FBI) and not with
local police. When you have information that provides probable cause for a
search/arrest warrant, contact the FBI.  Federal rewards are based on
federal laws, and almost all rewards are negotiable! Only federal agents
can negotiate and be legally bound to pay federal rewards. The size of the
reward depend on what you do, any personal risks taken, as well as the size
and value of the bust. (The book provides guidelines for negotiating.)

CrimeFighters are "information providers", undercover citizen CrimeFighters
without a badge or FBI authority.  You can be a high-profile crime fighter
like Elliot Ness, or stay undercover and be known only to the feds you work
with. You don't need their permission or a license to be a CrimeFighter.
It's a brand new, free-lance occupation. Anyone can be a CrimeFighter!

CRIME STOPPERS is one of the many privately-funded organization that pays
small, privately-funded rewards. Their reward formula is detailed in a
separate chapter for comparison against federal rewards. You could say that
Crime Stoppers' small rewards are designed for the amateurs, whereas the
more generous Federal rewards are for the pro's.

The first edition of this book (CRIMFTR1) is available free from computer
BBSs, and may be available from disk dealers for a maximum of $6.

CRIMFTR2, the updated version from feedback, will be available for $20 in a
professionally printed and bound book, from C.F.I., around January 1994.
