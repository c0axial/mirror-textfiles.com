              Quick Tutorial - Floppy and Hard Disk Operation

F1 pops up a Help File that's available at all times. The HELP file is in
two parts.

Part 1 is available when reading text. It contains a full explanation of
all standard features plus a few things you need to know before you begin.
Scroll through it for general information on the various Function
keys and short-cut keys. But first, please read the following notes.

Part 2 is when you're in the program and need HELP on a particular feature
you want to use that's HIGHLIGHTED. Use F1 to get information on that
particular feature in more detail. (Context sensitive Help.)

When you use F10 to activate the main menu at the top left of the screen,
use the left/right arrows to make a selection. When you do, the selection
should be highlighted to indicate where you are. If you can't see the
highlight, it may be because you have entered the wrong information about
your computer config. or made a typo. Exit the program and type START.

This page (table of contents) stays in memory at all times.
F6 displays this info at any time. Hit F6 again and it removes it.

Note: Function Keys aren't active when you're in the HELP or other windows.

Use ESC to "back up" or remove Help windows and (F*) Function windows.

The Windows feature in the Turbo Pascal software used in the development
of this program also provides Zoom and Resize Window features. These may
be useful in other programs (or FloppyBooks by other authors) but have no
real use in this book. I suggest you ignore these two features, even though
they are available and explained in the HELP file.

A minor program bug that seems to be beyond the skill of our programmer
can be easily overcome by an extra keystroke. Instead of waiting 3 to 6
months for the programmer to fix it, I decided to release the books now.

F7 opens a window to select a chapter. When the window is opened, use the
TAB key to move the invisible cursor into the prompt box where it will
start blinking, waiting for input. Enter the chapter number and <enter>.
(Using the TAB key to activate the blinking cursor is the extra keystroke.
 This minor but baffling program bug should be corrected in Version 2.0.)

                           FLOPPY-BASED Operation Only

Disk # 1 has the book reader software and HLP file. Both files MUST be in
drive A at all times. Disk # 1 has a few chapters on it, but other chapters
may be on disk 2 or 3.

To minimize floppy swapping, make sure all the chapters AVAILABLE on each
disk are in numerical sequence. (The numbers on the disk directory don't
have to be in sequence, but there should be no missing chapter numbers for
that group of files.) A missing file, not available anywhere, will prevent
loading of other chapters. That shouldn't happen, but it might because of a
bad modem transmission or faulty floppy. Use F7 to select the next chapter
available to bypass that problem until you get another copy of the book.

Disk 2 and 3 (etc) are put in drive B in numerical sequence.  When you
start, your computer will read drive A and can read the first few text
files on that disk.  Eventually, you'll try to access a file that's on
drive B, and the computer can't find it on A. You'll get an error message.

ERROR MESSAGE: "Chapter can't be found" means:

The next chapter is not on drive A. If the next chapter is on drive B, tell
the computer to read drive B from then on, and insert disks in sequence in
drive B until the end of the book.  Here's how to do it:

(1) Use ESC to exit error message.

(2) Use CTL-F7 to get a window to let you change DIRECTORY (first box)
(type B: and <enter>. (Directory Paths aren't usually needed for floppies.)

(3) Change disks as needed for the next chapter in sequence. Use F9 to read
the next file - or,

(4) You are reading files on drive B but have read the last one on the
floppy in drive B. Insert the next floppy if you want to continue reading
in sequence. Use ESC to exit error message, F9 for next chapter - or,

(5) You can also read files in random order. F7 opens a window to select
a chapter to read or print. When the window is opened, USE THE TAB KEY to
move the cursor to the prompt box and enter the number you want. Make sure
the disk with that chapter is in the current read drive and <enter>.

If the random chapter you want to read is not on the current read drive),
change drives first (Ctl-F7), then F7 to type the chapter number.

Once you're reading files on drive B you won't have to change drives back
to A unless you want to start all over, or random read files that are on
drive A. In that case, reset the directory (Ctl-F7) to read from A:

(Remember, F6 will toggle you to and from this tutorial if you need it.
 Or use F1 for additional help.)

NOW, hit F1 to read the general information on part 1 of the Help File.
Or,
                          F9 for Chapter One
