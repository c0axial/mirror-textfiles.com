          CrimeFighters' Catalog of Controversial Books & Videos

                         Self Defense and the LAW

Warning!  Many self-defense books and videos contain detailed instructions
on how to maim or kill "the enemy". If you're a soldier, that's your duty.
But if you're not a soldier fighting the enemy, you should know there are
common-sense rules and legal restrictions on non-military self-defense.

You can use only the same level of force against an opponent that it
appears to be, or is actually used against you. Lethal force is not always
necessary. (Most barroom brawls are not life-threatening.) Deliberately
killing an unarmed opponent with your hands or other weapons when he tries
to use non-lethal force against you might be considered as second-degree
murder! Everyone has the right, duty and obligation to defend his life or
the lives of innocent parties, but no one has the right to kill when
killing isn't absolutely necessary.

If someone provokes and starts a fight, then deliberately (with malice
aforethought), kills the other party when they respond with fists or non-
lethal weapons, he or she could be charged with premeditated murder! Self-
defense pleas are valid only when you defend yourself against an unprovoked
attack and use only the SAME level of force needed to protect yourself.

A possible exception is, when you know or strongly suspect your opponent is
deadly proficient in unarmed combat, or his physical size is such than your
ability to defend yourself is doubtful, and his actions or statements
indicate he intends to maim or kill you with his bare hands or other deadly
weapons, Then you MAY have a valid reason to kill him before he kills you.

If you get involved in a fist fight or brawl, take your lumps and give them
back as best you can. That's self-defense. If you opponent shows a knife,
gun, club or other deadly improvised weapon, and you fear for your life,
then you MAY have to kill him to save your life. Then it MAY be called
justifiable homicide.

The weasel-words in the above paragraphs are necessary because there are
many variables in prosecution and defense lawyer's arguments, and the
outcome of any case depends on individual circumstances, the State, the
judge and each individual in the jury. It's NEVER a cut-and-dried verdict!

Lethal techniques taught in books and videos in this CrimeFighters' Catalog
should be used only in apparent life-threatening situations. If and when
you use lethal force and your opponent doesn't survive, be sure you can
prove that deadly force was used as a last resort in pure self-defense.

                        Book and Video Descriptions

The descriptions of books and videos in this catalog have, for the most
part, been copied from the publisher's copy. Rather than re-write all the
descriptions to make them applicable to CrimeFighters, most of them have
been left "as is" because they contain more accurate descriptions of the
book's contents. Some descriptions may suggest or recommend controversial
actions. Some may broadly hint at or suggest illegal activity!  However,
CrimeFighters International, Inc. does not encourage, suggest, or approve
of any illegal actions or use of illegal equipment. (Just the opposite!)


No subject is taboo! Some readers may worry that the detailed information
in these books and videos can be used for illegal activity. But, knowledge
is a weapon too, like a gun. It can be used by criminals against the law-
abiding, but the same knowledge can also be used by the law-abiding to
protect themselves against criminals -- providing they make an effort to
learn what criminals know. Then, having the same or better knowledge, they
can counter-attack as CrimeFighters. Or, at least, take preventative
measures to defend themselves.

In most cases, lawbreakers already know about these books or the technical
information in them.  Many ex-cons could write their own books on these
subjects.  Some already have!  You'll find a few of them in this catalog.

Knowing what criminals know will give you insight of what to look for and
what to look out for - like booby traps and pipe bombs, and other nasty,
deadly things that ordinary citizens are seldom concerned with. Law
enforcement personnel and Crimefighters may encounter all kinds of illegal
equipment: terrorists' explosive devices, arson equipment and homemade
weapons. You need to recognize them, know what they are used for, and HOW
they're used and how to handle them to avoid nasty surprises -- and to have
"probable cause" for a search warrant or an immediate arrest!

Cops learn many things in Police Academies but seldom the down-and-dirty
things they need to know. The material in books and videos in this catalog
are written by experts in their field - whether they're ex-law enforcement,
ex-military, or ex-cons!  The authors have the insider knowledge cops and
CrimeFighters need to survive in today's world. That's why these highly
controversial books and videos are being made available to CrimeFighters.

This is where you can get the essential training you need, whether it's
fighting crime, avoiding becoming a victim of crime, or providing personal
security for yourself, your family and neighbors. Be a survivor.  Or,
better still, be a Crimefighter AND a survivor!

Please note: ALL books and videos are sold for INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY!
               (Use common sense - DON'T violate any laws!)
