                       Catalog Sales - Refund Policy

There are often many books by different authors on the same subject. If you
were to buy them all, you can expect to find a certain amount of overlap of
general information. There are usually a few differences in each book. It's
difficult to say which one is the best of its kind because each author and
reader has different experience and areas of knowledge. That's why we list
all books on the same subject that we can.  One book may cover a particular
bit of important-to-you information superficially, another one may go into
more explicit detail.  Getting two or more books on the same subject may be
necessary to get complete coverage.  However, you may be disappointed in
some of them and want a refund. We understand that, and we have a solution:

Videotapes are seldom sold with a money-back guarantee because of the ease
and low cost of copying. And, C.F.I. has subcontracted the mail order book
and video sales to a book-store owner who incurs expenses and takes his
earned commission on each sale. That's why we can't offer a 100% refund.

However, our book and videotape costs are about 50% of the retail price. A
returned book or video can be purchased from you for about about the same
amount as our dealer charges us for it.  So, that's our compromise: a 50%
refund on books and videos that are returned in "like new" condition.

Our refund policy is a no-nonsense, no-questions-asked policy. If you're
not completely satisfied with any of CFI's books or videotapes, return them
for a 50% credit on future purchases or a 50% cash refund. Your choice.

    (Please rewind videotapes when they are returned for credit.)

                       Damaged Books and Videotapes

No refunds will be given if books and videos are not "like new" condition.
Please don't underline words or mark or crease pages. Coffee-cup stains,
cigarette burns, dog-eared pages, and water damage convert them into "used"
books. They can't be resold as "new" and no refund credit will be given.

Videotapes are fragile and might be damaged by insufficient packaging or
careless carrier delivery. If you receive a tape that's flawed or damaged
please return it for an exchange. We'll immediately ship a new tape to you
(with the same title) to replace the damaged one.

Returned items should be carefully packaged to prevent damage. It may be a
good idea to insure them for the list price. If you've taken insurance when
returning items, it will be up to you (the shipper) to collect from the
carrier.

Damaged items received by us for a refund are not acceptable for resale.
You'll be advised by mail of any damaged items and asked if you want the
items returned to you to collect insurance. If no reply to our inquiry
letter is received within 60 days, the damaged items will be considered
abandoned by you and discarded by us. No future claims will be considered.

                                  Prices

Prices are, unfortunately, always subject to change. The same book that was
printed a year or two ago, usually costs more to print the next edition.

Prices in CRIMCAT1 will be effective until January 1994. If you order from
an out-of-date catalog and are short a dollar or two, we may ship the order
and invoice you for the amount due. But, if the amount due is over $5, the
book or video involved may be put on a "back order" status. They will be
shipped when the amount due is received by us, or a refund promptly mailed
to you if you ask to cancel the book or video.

Every six months or so, a new CrimeFighter Catalog will be distributed to
BBSs on our mailing list. When you receive a copy of the latest CRIMCAT,
delete the old version. New versions will have new books and videos listed
with current prices. And, a few books that go out of print will be deleted.

     This version is CRIMCAT1. Look for CRIMCAT2 around December 1993.

                                  Payment

Fledgling mail-order businesses usually find it difficult to get Visa and
Mastercharge merchant accounts from banks. Unfortunately, CFI is in this
category. At this time, we can't offer charge card convenience and we don't
accept C.O.D. orders. (Perhaps in a few months, before the next version of
this catalog, we'll have Visa and Mastercharge and you can FAX the info to
us to expedite orders.) In the meantime:

Checks for payment are accepted but, like many merchants, we found it
advisable to delay shipping until checks are cleared by our bank. That may
take about 2 or 3 weeks depending on where your bank is located.

If a check bounces, we pass on the bank's service charge of $20 and ADD $5
for the extra clerical and collection effort. In such an unhappy event,
the next invoice will include $25 to pay for the NSF check! (We hate that
part too, but you've been warned!)

To avoid delays and NSF problems, please use MONEY ORDERS for payment.
Money orders are available in many supermarkets 24 hours a day, seven days
a week - for about 25 cents at American Express outlets. (Banks and Post
Offices also sell money orders.)

                                Order Form

The next chapter is a blank order form. Use the PRINT menu to select a
chapter. Select PRINT CHAPTER (F5). When you're in the selection window,
use the TAB key to move the cursor into the prompt box, input # 24
and <enter>. If you need two or more pages, repeat the above.

Or, at any time in the future you want to print the order form, use the
shortcut ORDRFORM.BAT file to print it on your printer.
