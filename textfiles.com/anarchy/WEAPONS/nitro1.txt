 Here are a few fun things me and my friends would do on weekends.
 
 Brass cracker
 1) This is a small explosive device that is easy to make.
 First get a bullet casing(you know the brass part) or a live round, if
 it is a live round use pliers to pull the bullet out.Don't use a huge
 casing like a .375 H&H Magnum or to small like a .22, use a casing about
 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches tall.

 2) Fill the casing with an explosive powder, almost anything will work.
 Me and my friends use mortor powder and or Piccolo Pete( a fire work
 that when you light it, it wistles realy loud). Don't fill it to the 
 brim, leave about 3/8 of an inch empty.

 3) Put your desired length of fuse into it. Push the fuse about 1/4 of
 an inch into the powder.

 4) Carefuly pinch the opening closed around the fuse useing pliers.Make
 sure there are no open holes.

 5) Light the fuse and run. The explotion should be prity loud depending
 on what you use for your explosive. There shouldn't be much, if any,
 shrapnel because most of, or all of the casing vaporizes, but still
 be careful.

 We would also wreak havoc on the nehborhoud at night.
 These are some things we would do.

 Super glue wedges of wood into door locks of houses and cars.

 Shoot those little fake blood capsules at white houses with a wrist rocket.

 Write dirty stuff on doors with crayons and magic markers and paint markers.

 Put death threats in mail boxes.

 Put CO2 bombs or brass crackers in mail boxes.

 Niger knock(no afence to any black readers) at old peoples houses.

 Throw paint filled balloons at cars and house windows.

 Push over stop sighns and speed zone sighns.

 Throw CO2 bombs or brass crackers into the backs of pickup trucks.
 Thats just the cool stuff, I could make this list 3 pages long.

 This section is about things you can do to a car.
 I sugjest picking on older cars like before 1990, they're not as complex,
 and its easyer to open the hood.

 For those of you who know didly squat about cars, these are for you.

 Use wire cutters on anything they will cut(wires only, of course).The best
 wires to cut are the spark plug wires(they are normaly black or orange
 and look like they go right inside the engine).
 Use a razor knife and chop up the radiator hose and heater hoses.Be careful
 when cutting because the hose may be under pressure or have hot liquid in
 it.
 Also unhook,unplug, and undo what ever you can.

 If you realy hate someone do this to their car.  Take a McDonalds straw
 (because they're fat) and cut it in half. Then plug up one end with something
 like clay. Then fill the straw with Dain O and plug the other end. Check
 for leaks, there CAN NOT be any leaks. Now find your victomes car and put
 it in the gas tank and run like hell. What should happen is the gas eats
 the plastic straw and when it comes in contact with the Drain O it should
 explode. I have never tried this but if you have the balls go ahead and
 try it.

 This is also a very mean thing to do. Put Lye in the victomes cars gas.
 The Lye will burn extremely hot and hopefuly melt down the pistons, hehe.

 If you don't want to cause to much trouble then just put dirt in the gas,
 or sugar, or alot of water, or something that will disolve in the gas,
 like a tampon, or little stips of plastic.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ok enuff about cars. Back to bombs.

Milk jug bomb. This bomb can be made as a concution bomb or a shrapnel bomb.
1) Fill a milk jug with black powder or pyrodex(for a shrapnel bomb add some
small nuts and bolts and small pieces of metal).
2) Useing a small nail poke a hole just big enuff for the fuse in the cap.
3) Crimp blasting cap onto fuse
4) Put blasting cap into powder and fill the rest of the jug.
5) Put the cap on the jug with the fuse sticking out of the hole.
6) Duck tape the cap on very tightly, use alot of tap, maybe even glue the
cap on.
7)optional:Tape nails to the outside of the jug. Use clear tape or small
pieces of duck tape.   There you have it, now just place it, light it, and
run.  NOTE:You could use an electric blasting cap if you wanted to.

For another big bomb use a coffee can instead of a milk jug.(Don't forget to
tape the lid on realy good!)

Here is a good boobytrap.
1) Get an empty soup can(the bigger the better)
2) Useing a drill or something, make a hole on the side of the can about 1/4
of an inch from the bottom of the can, make the hole just big enuff for a
blasting cap.
3) Put an electronic blasting cap in the hole.
4) Fill the can with black powder or pyrodex or some other explosive so it is
an inch deep. Pack it around the blasting cap.
5) Now put a 1/4 inch thick wad of tissue paper.
6) Cram as many nails into the can as you can, heads facing in. If you grind
or cut off the heads you will be able to fit more nails in the can.
NOTE: Don't cram it to full or the nails will never come out.
7) Set the can up were you want it. If you don't want to kill the person
aim it at knee level, if you want to kill the person aim it so that the
nails will hit him in the head.
8) Connect the basting cap to your battery and trigger.(a clothespin switch with
a trip wire would work good with this boobytrap.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The House Bomb
1. Find a house with a gas stove and the owners are away for at least a day.
2. Get inside the house and seal up all the windows and doors(close them,put
blankets over drafty ones.)Don't forget the fire place.
3. Tape a bundle of strike anywhere matches to the front door with the heads
faceing the door jam and on the edge of the door.
4. Glue or tape a peice of sand paper to a small block of wood. Nail the 
block of wood to the door jam with the sand paper touch the matches.
5. Turn on all of the burners on the stove so that the gas comes out(don't
light any matches or lighters) and get out of the house threw the back door.
Now when someone comes home after they're vacation and open the front door
BOOOOOM!!!!!.(the blast will mainly blow out the windows and weak doors,
maybe boarding up the windows from the inside tightly might help the blast?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is something mean to do to someone you hate.
Copy this cookbook to a disk and mess it up. What I mean is change numbers,
change ingredents and amounts of stuff, just totaly fuck it up, but don't
make it obvious or they will find out. Then give it to your "friend" hehe.
I have done this to 3 of my "friends".  If you are really good with computers
you could make an autoexec file that would format they're hard drive, use
your imagination.
