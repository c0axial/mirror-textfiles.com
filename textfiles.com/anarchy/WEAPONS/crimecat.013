IN SEARCH OF THE ULTIMATE MARTIAL ART, The Jeet Kune Do Experience, by
Jerry Beasley, Ed.D.
Experience the power of Bruce Lee's jeet kune do, the explosive martial art
drawn from the best of Eastern and Western fighting styles. Bruce Lee
enthusiasts can now see in print a definition of jeet kune do that would
have made the late master proud. This exclusive collection features
interviews with top masters who worked closely with Lee - Dan Inosanto,
Larry Hartsell and Joe Lewis - along with a dynamic presentation of
principles and techniques and an introduction to the next generation of
jeet kune do artists.

Jerry Beasley, college professor AND martial artist, has written what many
feel is the most authoritative and innovative story of jeet kune do ever
told. Photos of top artists and current practioners in action, combined
with an insightful text on the history, development and application of
techniques, make this an exceptional book on this subject. This highly
enlightening documentation clearly explains what jeet kune do is, and what
it can do 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, photos, 208 pp, $16 (JEET)(811)


THE WAY OF NO WAY, Solving the Jeet Kune Do Riddle, by Jerry Beasley, Ed.D.
"What the Hell is JKD?" The editor who posed this question was probably not
the first - nor the last - to do so. How do you pin down an art whose
founder, Bruce Lee, said had "no boundaries" and referred to as the "way of
no way"? When Bruce Lee died, he left behind a legacy, but he also left
mysteries, riddles and puzzles.

In this book the author, a martial arts scholar who trained extensively
with JKD champion Joe Lewis, takes a logical, down-to-earth approach to
sorting the pieces and solving the puzzle. In the book, you'll discover
that JKD is not simply a matter of joining a JKD organization, or studying
the art with a JKD instructor. It is the freedom to react, the knowledge to
respond and the ability to discover. Beasley's insightful research, in-
depth discussions with Dan Inosanto and exclusive photos of training
sessions with Lewis will lead you to a greater understanding of the
emerging art and practice of Jeet Kune Do.

THAI BOXING DYNAMITE, The Explosive Art of Muay Thai, by Zoran Rebac.
Muay Thai is the hottest style of kick boxing to hit the sports world this
century. Unlike conventional kickboxing, wherein the opponents get in their
three token kick and then duke it out with fists, Thai boxers integrate the
use of their legs and fists so that all four limbs are utilized in one
fluid, savage, yet clean style. Only real men survive bouts of Thai
kickboxing, and only you can decide if you're tough enough to learn a rough
way of fighting. 8.5 X 11, softcover, photos, 120 pp, $14 (TB)(659)

GUGE GONGJI, Seven Primary Targets to Take Anyone Out of a Fight, by Master
Hei Long.
Structurally disabling an opponent is like removing the bullets from a gun.
It's unlikely that an opponent can throw a punch at you with a broken wrist
or elbow, and his ability to advance is substantially inhibited by a busted
knee or ankle. That's the principle of guge gongji: stopping an attacker by
breaking his instruments of danger. In unarmed combat, that means his
ability to move or strike.

Guge gongji is an alternative to killing, a second-to-last resort that
should be used only when conventional self-defense tactics are likely to be
ineffective. Master Hei Long's precise instructions and illustrations show
you how to use your opponent's body as YOUR weapon! Learn the seven primary
targets guaranteed to take ANYONE out of a fight.

GOUZAO GONGJI, Seven Neurological Attacks for Inflicting Serious Damage,
by Master Hei Long.
In this groundbreaking study, the author unveils the secrets of Gouzoa
Gongji, a (really) no-holds barred system of self-defense consisting of
seven anatomical targets which, when attacked strategically, will
effectively cripple an assailant's nervous system. The Master pinpoints
these primary targets and reveals how a properly delivered blow can bring
about the desired effect, be it disrupted balance, acute pain,
unconsciousness or a temporarily paralyzed limb. Then he outlines which
strikes and angles of force are the most effective for achieving the
precise results you are after. These targets are not lethal or even
critical - but not every confrontation calls for such severe action or
warrants such devastating consequences. Instead, these seven targets offer
a comfortable middle-ground option, arming you with tools to inflict damage
serious enough to stop an assailant of comparable size, strength and weight
in his tracks. 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, illust., 168 pp, $16 (GOUZAO)(2010)


DRAGONS TOUCH, Weaknesses of the Human Body, by Master Hei Long.
Drop your opponent in an instant with the deadly moves of the Dragons
Touch! Learn how you can immobilize or destroy your foe with high-impact
blows to his most vulnerable areas. Master Hei Long explains which pressure
points are the most susceptible to Dragon strikes and which angles you
should use in applying force. The body's 43 major target areas are
explicitly illustrated, and 165 photographs show you how to attack each
pressure point with the self-defense moves of Lian Shi kung fu.

The body's weaknesses and physiological reactions can work in your favor in
a combat situation. Sufficient force to specific target areas can cause
pain, shock, paralysis, unconsciousness, even death. Each deadly set of
movements can ensure that you are in control. Be the survivor - not a
victim.  5.5 X 8.5, softcover, photos, illustr., 184 pp, $10 (DRAG)(398)


MASTER'S DEATH TOUCH, Unarmed Killing Techniques, by Master Hei Long.
There are times when a man is forced to kill or be killed. Such a physical
confrontation is the most fearsome form of unarmed combat he will ever
face. To survive, he must know how to properly execute LETHAL martial art
techniques that will get the job done quickly and efficiently.

This book gets down to the devastating fundamentals of the DEADLIER side of
self-defense. The author teaches the primary targets of an opponent's body
and points out how to recognize various physical characteristics that would
limit the lethal effectiveness of certain techniques. He then outlines the
merciless use of the hands, feet, elbows and knees to overcome any
assailant who is trying to kill you.

Whether fighting on the battlefield, in an elevator, back alley or on the
streets, MASTER'S DEATH TOUCH takes self-defense to its most brutal level.

IRON HAND OF THE DRAGON'S TOUCH, Secrets of Breaking Power, by Master Hei
Long.
As a scream rends the air, the punch and scissors kick shatter three

Bones or boards, you want to shatter your targets without maiming yourself.
Only mastering the iron hand will give you the strength, precision and
confidence. The most deadly weapons of the hand - the punch, suto, backhand
and palm strikes - as well as those of the feet  the front kick, hook kick
and side kick - are explained by Master Hei Long. Break through the
mystique surrounding the power of breaking skills and put that awesome
force into YOUR hands and feet. 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, illus., 112 pp, $12

21 TECHNIQUES OF SILENT KILLING, by Master Hei Long.
Assassination using manual weapons rather than firearms is a deadly skill
that few possess. The assassin must locate his target, get close enough to
neutralize him with a single stroke, and escape without being captured. To
be successful, the job has to be done quickly and silently, attracting as
little attention as possible while guaranteeing the death of the target.

This highly controversial and informative book outlines methods used by
trained assassins to execute their victims with cold efficiency. The spike,
knife and nunchaku are used to impale or strangle victims in a minimum
amount of time with a maximum chance for lethal results. These are ruthless
methods used in the shadowy world of criminal activity and international
espionage. This book holds nothing back! (In fact, the illustrations in
this book are so gruesome the regular printer refused to handle the job!)

The techniques in this book are not self-defense maneuvers, nor is it a
training manual. What you can LEARN from it is what to look out for, and
how to protect yourself from such attacks by fanatical zealots or paid
assassins! If you're a lawman or CrimeFighter involved in fighting
terrorists, you NEED to know what assassins know - and a little bit more!

MASTER'S GUIDE TO BASIC SELF-DEFENSE, Progressive Retraining of the
Reflexive Response, by Master Hei Long.
At least once in his life, every man will stand face-to-face with an
aggressor. In that moment of truth, he must be prepared to defend himself -
to the death is necessary. Despite common self-defense myths, there is no
deeply mysterious method by which you can touch an opponent in a strategic
spot and bring him to his knees.

The CORE of any system of self-defense is the RESPONSE to an attack. But
certain natural responses (such as ducking and blinking) often leave you
exposed and defenseless for just a moment or two - which is all the time
needed to finish you off. In an unexpected attack, none of your martial
arts training is going to help you if these reflexes are allowed to take
over.

Master Hei Long's training program focuses on DECONDITIONING such
counterproductive responses to an assault. Through a structured learning
process that combines fundamental defensive maneuvers with the retraining
of the central nervous system, you will learn how to instinctively avoid
ducking and blinking during common assaults and counterattack with maximum
efficiency and ferocity to deftly and swiftly defeat your attackers.

Saigon, Vietnam - Loren learned the hard way that real fights are far more
explosive and violent than karate sparring matches. This book teaches the
physical and mental adjustments a martial artist MUST make in his thinking
and training in order to survive the real thing.

The author exposes the weaknesses of popular hand techniques and kicks used
in sparring matches and shows what WILL work to stop a determined opponent.

guidelines, including grappling, vulnerable targets and using your
environment as a weapon. Also taught are training tips and sparring drills
that will sharpen the skills necessary to come out on top of any physical
confrontation.  5.5 X 8.5, softcover, photos, 176 pp, $16 (GOES)(888)

SUDDEN VIOLENCE, The Art of San Soo, by Master Greg Jones.
There is one big difference between street fighting and tournament fighting
- in a street fight, if you miss with a dramatic whirling kick, a referee
won't step in to save you from a death dealing blow in return. The
developers of kung fu san soo know this all too well. That's why this
martial art bypasses formal dojo techniques and gets down to the bone-
breaking, eye-gouging, rib-crushing basics that will keep you alive on the
violence-prone city streets.

This manual teaches simple but unique self-defense principles that you can
learn to use to stop an attack BEFORE IT'S BEGUN. Through the "five
families" of this little-known style of kung fu, you will learn how to
recognize a threat and use deadly efficient strikes to put the bad gus away
every time. Your opponent may be tough, but as a san soo martial artist,
YOU WILL NEVER GIVE HIM THE CHANCE TO PROVE IT!

body are vulnerable to attack, so you must know where and how to strike.

THE WAY OF THE WARRIOR, The Violent Side, by Loren Christensen.
The warrior spirit - it is within everyone, ready to be called upon when
you can rely on no one and nothing than your own strength. The author has
had to call upon his in a wide range of violent encounters, from grueling
karate sparring matches to brutal barroom brawls as a military policeman in
Saigon, Vietnam.

In this book, the author tells in detail some of the many fights, showdowns
and contests that he's been involved in, and how his warrior spirit helped
him not only to prevail, but teaches valuable lessons about the NATURE of
violence. This is not a book of New Age mysticism or esoteric philosophy.
It is a practical, honest and interesting story which reveals by the
explanation of one man's experiences in a violent world, how they led him
down the path of the warrior.

Roman gladiators, American Indians and Japanese Samurai, to name a few, all
knew the Way of the Warrior. Modern man, sheltered by police and military
protection has had no one to teach him or the need to learn the way of the
warrior - until now. It isn't a fighting skill - it's a state of mind; an
essential ingredient for those who must fight for survival like a warrior!

points ever to appear in a single volume. Through strikingly dramatic

BLACK MEDICINE II, Weapons at Hand, by N. Mashiro, Ph.D.
Here is the sequel to N. Mashiro's infamous Black Medicine I, The Dark Art
of Death. That book reveals the 150 parts of the human body most vulnerable
in hand-to-hand combat. This book, Weapons at hand, takes the opposite
approach, presenting 112 parts of the body that are natural weapons,
largely because they are very injury-resistant. Following this is a section
radically different from conventional self-defense theory, which lists more
than 180 deadly makeshift weapons that can save your life. The weapons are
all improvised from common items. And 50 action photos show exactly how to
use the "black medicine" techniques discussed in "Weapons at Hand." This
volume is especially suited to the needs of bodyguards, security personnel
and martial artists, and anyone else who feels they have a need to defend
themselves or targets of deadly, unprovoked attacks.

BLACK MEDICINE III, Low Blows, by N. Mashiro, Ph.D.

third volume in the author's infamous "Black Medicine" series. In LOW BLOWS
Mashiro presents his favorite techniques for bringing the body's natural
weapons into violent and painful contact with an opponent's vulnerable
areas. He teaches devastating responses to wrist holds, punches, chokes,
rear attacks, bear hugs and special defenses against knife and club
attackers. Especially noteworthy is a chapter on fighting a standing
opponent from the ground! If you get into fights, sooner or later you'll be
on the ground. (You can bet on it.) Learning and using this trick alone may
turn the tables - and quite possibly save your life!

Over one hundred dramatic photos illustrate the holds and moves in LOW
BLOWS, making it substantially longer than previous volumes in this series.
An excellent self-study guide for beginners and an eye-opening reference
work for advanced students and instructors. But be warned: LOW BLOWS is not
for readers with weak stomachs.

                           Martial Arts Weapons

CHINESE RING DAGGERS, The Ultimate Close-Quarter Weapons, by Ricky Pickins.
A rare, exotic weapon, the Chinese ring dagger has a ring situated where a
pommel normally would be. This arrangement allows you, with your index

punches. Or, use the dagger singly or in pairs, one in each hand to double
your slashing power.

Hundreds of photos illustrate the stances, moves and kata that make this
such a beautiful and exotic, albeit deadly, martial art form. Take
advantage of this first-ever revealing book of this ancient Chinese art
that uses the ultimate close-quarter weapon.

PANANANDATA YANTOK AT DAGA, Filipino Stick and Dagger, by Amante P. Marinas
You don't have to live in the Philippines to use this very practical and
efficient self-defense system of using a stick and dagger. Why use both the
stick and dagger? When you're attacked with a long weapon, the stick is
used to block and thrust THROUGH your attacker's defenses; the dagger is
used once you have bypassed his defenses. If your assailant has only a
short weapon, the stick easily defeats it, opening an avenue for a slash or
thrust with either the stick or dagger.

Visualize yourself going for a peaceful walk in the park or lonely streets.
You always take with you a walking stick (perhaps a sword cane, or if it's
rainy weather, an English style umbrella with a sharp 4" point) and your
trusty hunting knife which is easily accessible. Suddenly, you're
confronted with a robber who shows a knife as a threat. Imagine the thugs
surprise when you pull your knife and, using your walking stick (sword cane
or sharp umbrella), attack him! If you know how to use a stout stick and
sharp dagger, the ordinary robber won't have a chance of a snowball in hell
- where you can send him if need be. This book, with its 188 photos, can
teach you HOW to use both the stick and dagger with deadly efficiency.

If you live in a State that has highly restrictive gun laws, this may be
the only legal way to carry self-defense weapons. If you own a hunting
knife (and you should) and take a walking stick with you when you go for
walks, and know how to use them effectively, you'll never be unarmed and
defenseless! 5.5 X 8.5, softcover, 188 photos, 104 pp, $12 (YAN)(692)

NINJA DEATH TOUCH, By Ashida Kim.
The black and terrifying world of the ninja, history's most diabolical
assassins, is explored here. Certain ninjutsu ryu specialized in the Death
Touch, the ultimate perversion of the beneficial Chinese art of
acupuncture, this unique book reveals the principles of this unholy
science, which can induce death with the touch of the hand! Through
interruption and manipulation of the body's nervous system, circulatory
systems and chi flow, the THREE Death Touch styles are capable of
terminating ANY human life. Acupuncture is now recognized as a medical
science. The Ninja Death Touch is based on the same thing - except for
killing, not healing.

BLACK MEDICINE: THE VIDEO, Vital Targets, Maximum Punishment.
Here's a graphic video demonstration of how to exploit the vulnerable
points of the human anatomy. Instructors Peyton Quinn and Mike Haynack are
black belts in a variety of martial arts and have worked as bouncers in
some of the most violent bars and roadhouses from new Jersey to Texas.

This video focuses on the strikes that these men KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE will
put a man down. Debunking the common myth that there is one magic shot that
will drop someone every time, this video demonstrates which techniques work
best against specific targets on the human body. It explicitly shows not
only where to strike but also how to create an opening for the blow and how
to achieve enough power to break an opponent's bones, shut off the blood to
his brain or drop him unconscious to the pavement. Color, about 50 min. $30

TAEKWON DO FORMS AND THEIR COMBAT APPLICATIONS.
For the first time on film, here is a remarkable look at the combat
practicality of taekwon do forms. In this video, 7th degree black belt L.A.
Grasso, a master in the combat application of TKD forms, demonstrates 14
sharp "hyungs", from CHONG-JI to KAE-BECK. After each demonstration, he and
his top students don street clothes and show you how certain strikes could
be used in ACTUAL COMBAT SITUATIONS.

This unique video shows you what you need to know to harness the awesome
power of TKD strikes to shatter bricks or boards - or bust an assailant's
bones in a street fight. As you watch the action, the full-power
demonstrations on specially armored attackers, you will understand the
combat applications of moves "within" the forms that are so often
misunderstood or missed altogether by many TKD students. This complete
instructional video will open your eyes to the necessity of practicing TKD
forms if you want to maximize your real-life self-defense training.
VHS, color, approx 45 minutes, $30 (TAEKWON.DO)(2011)
