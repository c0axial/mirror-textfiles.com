  1st- Carefully twist and pull the metal part (Along with eraser) of the pencil
till it comes off.

Part ///: Using the Darts
-------------------------

  1st- Now take the finished dart and insert it in the tube (if it is too small
put on more yarn.)

  2nd- Aim the tube at a door,wall,sister, ect.

  3rd- blow on the end of the pipe.

  4th- Sometimes the end of the pipe may be sharp.  When this happens I suggest
you wrap it with some black electrician tape.  It should feel alot better.
