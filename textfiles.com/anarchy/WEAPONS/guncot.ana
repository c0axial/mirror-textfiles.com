*****************HOW TO MAKE GUN-COTTON**********************



If only a small quantity is required---Mix 4 1/4 oz of pure dry 
Potassium Nitrate with 30 fl.dr of Sulphuric acid specific gravity
1.845 ish and stir into this mixture 120 grms of pure cotton.
(The adding of Potassium Nitrate straight to the Sulphuric acid
saves you having to buy the Nitric acid , which can be a bit of a
pain sometimes).
As soon as saturation is complete,in about a minute,throw the cotton
into a large container of water under the tap and leave the tap on,
so that all the acid is washed out...THAT MEANS ALL..Test the water
with Litmus paper to be sure.If the cotton is left slightly acidic
it will explode at some later date;all by its self wouldn,t that be
fun.!!!!
  Then squeeze it out into a towel till it feels quite dry and then
finally dry it at about 180 F.
 Gun-Cotton differs widely from Gun-Powder in its properties requiring 
a much lower temperature for its ignition about 136 F G-P about 250 F
 Gun-Cotton burns so fast in the open that you could put some on your
hand and light it , you wouldn,t feel a thing !!
 It needs to be confined in a strong case if your fuse is a normal
Black-Powder one but if you use a detonator ie/a Fulminate it will
explode on its own.

 Rapid as this combustion is,however,it occupies an appeciable time,
as may be seen by igniting a train of loose gun-cotton,which takes
several seconds to burn a few feet,giving at the same time a large
flame. If gun-cotton be confined at the moment of ignition this flame
is forced back into the mass.and by rapidly heating it brings it to
the point at which combustion passes into explosion.Prior to 1868
it was always confined in strong cases,but in that year someone
discovered that when a detonating fuse was exploded in contact with 
compressed gun-cotton,the unconfined mass at once exploded with 
ENORMOUS violence,and this discovery opened up an entirly new ball-
game. 
 The products of the explosion are :- Carbon Dioxide
                                      Carbon Monoxide
                                      Hydrogen
                                      Nitrogen
                                      Methane
 It can be detonated buy hitting with a hammer on an anvil but only
the portion under the hammer will explode with a loud report.

 To recap,do make sure that all the acid is washed out..

and lets be careful out there...........IVAN
