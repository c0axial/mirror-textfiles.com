Hydrogen Bomb

Ingredients:

   * 2-liter bottle
   * hydrochloric acid (HCl) (The Works toilet bowl cleaner)
   * aluminum foil
   * balloon
   * long wick

Procedure:

   * fill the 2-liter bottle with 20 or so strips of 12" long X 1" wide
     loosely rolled aluminum foil
   * add 8 oz of HCL to the bottle
   * shake and remove cap (be sure to cap before shaking)
     Note: If you need more detailed instructions on how to complete the
     prior part, see How to Build a Pressure Bomb
   * Place the balloon over the top of the bottle to catch the Hydrogen (H)
     gas that will escape from the bottle
   * when the balloon has expanded, place the wick partly inside it, and
     tie the ballonn in a knot.
     Note: Hydrogen is lighter than air, so if you release the balloon, it
     will float away (This could be useful...)
