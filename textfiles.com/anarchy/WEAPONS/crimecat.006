THE SCOUT, by Ion L. Idriess
This Australian guerrilla manual presents a rare insight into one of the

commander must still rely heavily on the eyes, ears and stealth of his
scouts. In addition to detailing the basic fundamentals of scouting in
general, certain obscure techniques of scouting, often overlooked in most
U.S. Army and Marine Corp scouting texts, are detailed in this book.

LONG-RANGE SURVEILLANCE UNIT OPERATIONS
As a primary source of human intelligence, the long-range surveillance unit
is a fundamental element of war. LRSUs are not intended to carry out direct
action; their mission of limited reconnaissance and stationary surveillance
is quite different from that of Special Forces and Rangers, but is,
nonetheless, indispensable. (Like CrimeFighters vs cops, maybe?)

This manual provides doctrine for the tactical employment of LRSUs and is a
reference for the information needed to plan their assignments. It outlines
each stage of the process, from organization and mission development to
execution, extraction and recovery. Find out how these teams are organized,
trained and equipped to surreptitiously enter enemy areas and then observe
and report enemy dispositions, movements, activities and battlefield
conditions for the benefit of the tactical commander.

BREAK CONTACT, CONTINUE MISSION, by Raymond D. Harris
The men of MACV-SOG; they were the elite combat troops of the U.S. Army
Special Forces, carrying out the most dangerous missions of the Vietnam
War. Secretly inserted by Huey helicopters deep into Laos, Cambodia and
North Vietnam, SOG recon patrols moved silently through enemy sanctuaries
deep in the hills and jungles, gathering military intelligence, snatching
prisoners and calling in air strikes. If the team was discovered, they had
to fight their way to the nearest clearing against overwhelming odds,
praying that the rescue choppers would arrive instead of orders to "break
contact, continue mission."

In his widely praised first novel, MACV-SOG veteran Ray Harris tells the
story of Ted Garner, a recon sergeant running missions out of the CCC
compound south of Kontum. In what Special Forces vets have called
"extraordinary," "haunting" and "one of the best" accounts of special
operations in the Vietnam War, Harris describes the faith, fear and
friendship that bound the men of SOG, and with stark and brutal honesty
unveils the meaning behind the unit's motto: "YOU HAVE NEVER LIVED UNTIL
YOU'VE ALMOST DIED."

While this is a fictionalized version of what it was all about, it's also
based on the author's personal and actual experience in this unique outfit.
Absolutely fascinating reading, especially for Vietnam vet's.

and the skills it took to get back alive. From their special weapons to

AMBUSH! - Navy SEALs in Deadly Action
The most devastating terror tactic of U.S. Navy SEALs in Vietnam was the
ambush. SEALs were experts at delivering themselves silently to ambush
sites, setting up kill zones and laying down blankets of fire from which no
enemy could escape. Occasional survivors returned to their villages with
chilling tales of the "men with green faces" appearing out of nowhere,
bringing sudden, violent death.

This video features all-new, never-before-seen footage from the personal
archives of SEAL veterans. This is not a rehash of SEAL history - rather,
it is an instructional video on the art of the ambush as told by the men
who perfected the tactic. SEAL vets describe what it was like to go out on
"wham and scram" operations, the differences between planned vs. hasty
ambushes, unconventional methods used only by SEAL teams, the vital
importance of the elements of surprise and all the explicit details of
springing a successful ambush. Filmed with the cooperation of the UDT/SEAL
Museum, AMBUSH! is the ultimate video on how America's deadliest warriors
carried out their deadliest missions.

conflicts around the world. SEAL counter-insurgency operations rank among

warfare.

In this video release, you'll witness live footage of SEALs in action from
World War II to today's "dirty little wars." See UDT (Underwater Demolition
Teams) clearing the beaches prior to landing at Guam, Normandy and Inchon;
SEALs waging a deadly guerrilla war against the Vietcong in the canals and
jungles of Vietnam; and today's SEAL fire teams securing key enemy outposts
during the Grenada operation, protecting U.S. shipping interests in the
Middle East and spearheading the invasion of Panama. Much of this material
has never been available to the public - until now.
