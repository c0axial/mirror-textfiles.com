If you want to be an active Crimefighter, you need to know what police know
about the law. It would also be beneficial to understand the various kinds
of police organizations and what they do. You'll also need to understand
the criminal justice system and the basics of criminal law.

Most colleges have courses on Criminal Justice as well as tort law
(lawsuits). I suggest that you check them out and enroll in a semester or
two. In the meantime, or if you don't have the time to attend classes,
here's a few textbooks that you can read on your own time and schedule.

                             Criminal Justice

THE POLICE IN AMERICA, an Introduction, by Samuel Walker, Copyright 1992
This 411-page book is a detailed look at all aspects of police work, what
cops do: the good, the bad, and the ugly (police corruption). The book is
not about how to be a cop, or how to make arrests or be a detective. It's
mainly about what police work is all about. It starts with the history of
various police organizations and their role in maintaining law and order in
America. It analyzes the wide scope of responsibility, authority and
related problems of sworn police. It mentions current problems and
solutions as well as the important and expanding role of blacks, hispanics
and women in the "new" police force, and discusses their performance and
acceptance on the force as well as in the streets.

The book analyzes the image and reality of police work. "The crime-fighter
image is not an accurate description of what the police do. Only about one-
third of a patrol officer's activities are devoted to criminal law enforce-
ment. The typical officer rarely makes a felony arrest. Rather, most police
work takes place in "peacekeeping" or "order maintenance" situations in
which there is no violation of the criminal law."

If you've been thinking about wearing a cop's badge, but haven't made up
your mind, the information in this book will be helpful. If you think a
cop's life is full of action and glory, think again. The book gives you an
overview of police work in general, promotion criteria, office politics,
and what to expect from police organizations as an officer and citizen.
When you finish the book you'll have a better idea of a cop's job, and the
police departments' peacekeeping and public relations role.

The book is a second edition. It's recommended reading in criminal justice
courses taught at UNLV. I recommend it too, for all CrimeFighters. $29

CRIMINAL JUSTICE, by James A. Inciardi, Fourth Edition, copyright 1993
This is a BIG book in physical size, contents, scope, and weight -- and
priced accordingly. It is profusely illustrated in color, with many graphs,
charts and photos to break the monotony and ease the burden of reading 760
pages. However, the material itself is not boring. On the contrary. It is
interesting, enlightening, and even fascinating if you're a prospective
CrimeFighter with no experience or basic knowledge of the justice system.

The contents are a comprehensive coverage of all aspects of the criminal
justice system in America. It's far easier to tell you what it doesn't
cover (very little, if anything) than what it does cover. The following
table of contents will give you a hint at what it includes:

Chapter 1. The Rediscovery of Criminal Justice in America.
Chapter 2. Crime and the Nature of Law.
Chapter 3. Legal and Behavioral Aspects of Crime.
Chapter 4. Criminal Statistics and the Extent of Crime.

CRIMINAL LAW, by Joel Samaha, Fourth Edition, Copyright 1993, 560 pages
This book delves deeply into all aspects and nuances of Criminal Law.

Chapter 1. The Nature and Origins of Criminal law
Chapter 2. The General principles of Criminal Law
Chapter 3. The General principles of Criminal Liability
Chapter 4. Parties to Crime: The Doctrine of Complicity

Chapter 10 Crimes Against Habitation: Burglary and Arson
Chapter 11 Crimes Against property
Chapter 12 Crime Against Public Order and Morals.

Each chapter explains, analyzes and discusses the law topic by a unique
method of student participation: It uses a thorough analysis of recent case
law, asks questions and provides answers before disclosing the final
verdict. The courts' decisions are explained in detail to illustrate the
legal concept and interpretation of the law as it has been applied and
tested through appeals. This method teaches by analysis of actual cases,
not by just reading the text in lawbooks. Many people have memorized the
law but don't understand the reasoning behind judicial interpretations.
This book will teach you both. Highly recommended for CrimeFighters. $49.95

together, and you have full coverage. Get them all, if you can afford it.

QUI TAM law and CIVIL SUITS are tools of the trade for CrimeFighters. There
is no "textbook" available on Qui Tam law, but that subject is explained in
detail in CrimeFighters' electronic book. To understand civil suits and how
the game is played lawyer-style, "The Litigation Explosion" book provides
an overview as well as a few dirty tricks by lawyers. Here's some info:

THE LITIGATION EXPLOSION, What Happened When America Unleashed the Lawsuit,
by Walter K. Olson (1991) (An 8.5 X 5.5  softcover book, not a pocketbook)

The author of this book makes a good case to restrict lawsuits and to rein
in the legal fraternity. But he also provides the information and incentive
for citizens to personally sue lawbreakers. Crimefighters can go a step
further and make them pay for the Crimefighters' time and costs of the
investigation leading to their arrest!

Example: You must be the person suffering a loss to sue for "damages". When
you read this book you'll realize anyone can sue lawbreaker for the adverse
effect the crime rate has on our basic freedoms - like freedom from fear
when walking late at night, from the constant worry of robbery, mugging,
rape, and burglary. All of which makes most urban areas an "unsafe" place
to be.

These and other "injuries" are inflicted on us by lawbreakers. The problem
is, most lawbreakers don't have enough assets to make a lawsuit practical.
But, some do!  The solution is to use a do-it-yourself litigation Kit that
cuts your costs to about $125 to initiate a lawsuit -- which is later paid
back to you by the defendant as part of your legal "costs".

CrimeFighters can sue those they catch for appropriate amounts -- from
$1,000 to $10,000 -- as a substitute for or in addition to federal rewards.
If you do the actual investigative work, you can also charge them about $75
an hour for your time and effort, plus all related investigative expenses.

Each lawbreaker is only a small part of the problem, but each is a part of
the problem. A guilty plea (or jury verdict) provides conclusive evidence
of their liability. The civil suit will hardly ever go to trial. In most
cases, it will be settled out of court when plea bargaining the criminal
charges, or by asking the court for summary judgment based on a conviction.

When a lawbreaker has any assets, you can sue them for a small part of your
million-dollar compensation. Thus, CrimeFighters can use lawsuits to
collect an alternate reward from lawbreakers -- even for misdemeanors!

"The Litigation Explosion" book tells you all about civil suits, and all
the dirty tricks lawyers use to win and make millions of dollars. If you
use Qui Tam law to prosecute criminals you catch, report, or arrest, you
can sue them via civil suits and be 99% guaranteed of collecting a $1,000
to $10,000 award -- when the guilty party has sufficient assets to pay.

Read this book to learn all about civil suits and how you can use them to
collect "awards" as well as rewards, and how to win virtually every lawsuit
you initiate on your own -- without the assistance of a lawyer.
THE LITIGATION EXPLOSION (LITIGATE)(5019) $13


WITH JUSTICE FOR NONE,by Gerry Spence (1989), 8.5 X 5.5" softcover book.

"A scathing indictment of how law is taught, practiced, and administered in
this country... One of the best books ever written on the law." - The
Denver Post.

This book, like The Litigation Explosion, is a critical examination of the
law and corporate lawyers in particular. The writer, a well-know lawyer
from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, knows what he writes about and he does it well.
The book is entertaining because of the author's style of writing and home-
spun humor. It's a pleasure to read. More important, it provides overlooked
facts of HOW the law is being abused in the name of "justice", with justice
for none.

The contents of his book explains all the evils of the law as it now stands
in civil litigation - the "unfairness" of tort law (lawsuits). It also
mentions a lot of insider information on prosecutors and judges. If you
plan on using civil suits, read this book. It's worth the price and the
time to read it. You'll learn from it. (JUSTICE.F.N.)(3025) $10

                     Security Guards and CrimeFighters

Private Security and the Law, written by Charles P. Nemeth
This book is a unique training Manual for Security Guards and CrimeFighters
As the book explains, a security guard has no more police authority than a
civilian. Accordingly, everything in the book that's directed at security
guards also applies to CrimeFighters!

The book includes (among other things): The Law of Arrest, Search and
seizure - applications in the private sector; Civil and Criminal liability
of security personnel; The enforcement of laws and interpretation of
evidence; Public and private law enforcement.

It also includes dozens of examples and case histories explaining various
scenarios and court decisions. It's a recent publication (1989) and tailor-
made for CrimeFighters. Every CrimeFighter needs to know all they can learn
about citizens arrests and the inherent dangers if they don't know WHAT to
do, what NOT to do, and WHY.

If you make an arrest for a felony while on duty as a security guard, you
may not get a big reward, but you are eligible to apply under Title 18,
USCS 3059. If the reward isn't as much as you think it's worth, and there
may be some fines and forfeitures involved, consider prosecuting the case
yourself via Qui Tam law. You can also consider a lawsuit against the
lawbreaker to get paid a $1,000+ award.

The pay for a security guard is minimal. But, being a rent-a-cop puts you
in a position to look for lawbreakers; make citizen arrests; be eligible
for rewards; use Qui Tam law to be the prosecutor; and sue the perp's (if
they have any assets). A security guard's job might be considered as basic
training to get experience in a CrimeFighter role - doing all of the above.
This college-level textbook is recommended reading for all security guards
and serious CrimeFighters. $26  (P.SECURITY)(3028)

THE SPY'S WORKSHOP - America's Clandestine Weapons, by Don McLean
Spy, Plumber, Agent, Operative. Call him what you will, this shadowy figure
is a master of intrigue. THE SPY'S WORKSHOP reveals the most fascinating
but least known aspect of the modern spy; his legendary black bag of secret
tricks.

The development of modern American spy hardware began in World War II, when
an elite corps of scientists created a special arsenal for America's
pioneer spy agency, the super-secret OSS. Many of these items are still in
use today. This heavily illustrated volume details the men and the
ingenious weapons they devised - AUNT JEMIMA (a high explosive mixture
camouflaged as pancake flour), ZEPHYR (a silencer for outboard motors used
in covert landing operations) and a lot more.

THE SPY'S WORKSHOP will delight World War II buffs, spook enthusiasts and
those curious about the gadgets, gizmos and gimmicks of all types.

If your case rests on the results of a lie detector test, be sure to know
how the results can be rigged. Learn what to watch for and watch out for.
In the event the tests say "innocent" but you know better, you may be able

"innocent" claims based on such tests.

DECEPTION DETECTION - Winning the Polygraph Game, by Charles Clifton
Each year in the U.S., up to 4 million people submit to polygraph tests.
Even more shocking is that 40 to 50 percent are erroneously branded liars!
Government studies have found polygraph accuracy to be as low as 50.6
percent!

But since fear is the polygraph's most powerful weapon, you can defend
yourself! The ammo is all here: a description of the machine and the tests
so you'll know what to expect; physical, cognitive and pharmacological
countermeasures, plus clever tricks you can use to stack the cards in your
favor; and practice tests so you can gauge your progress and ability. Use
these proven tactics for rendering the polygrapher impotent in his efforts
to intimidate and manipulate, and you'll beat the box hands down!

NEVER SAY LIE - How to Beat the Machines, the Interviews, the Chemical
Tests, by Scott French and Paul Van Houten, Phd.D.
Do your unconscious body movements call you a liar? Can you tell when
someone else is lying? How do government intelligence agents trick lie-
detection systems?  NEVER SAY LIE exposes the "science" of lie detection
and shows how screening tests can be influenced by mechanical tricks,
drugs, practice and knowledge.

The FBI, IRS, CIA, job-screening firms, detectives and others use the old-
fashioned polygraph, graphology, drug-screening tests, and kinesic
interviewing. Do these techniques really work? Will you lose a job, get
fined or even go to jail because of a false positive on a shaky system?
Learn how these systems work and how to manipulate the tests and testers to
mislead anyone, anything, anytime - and get away with it.
