      Ok, I just watched Under Seige, it took two years for that? big deal,
it was a piece of shit......now here's how you do terrorism the USA way!


  First get a dedicate group of people. ok get together and decide on some
targets, for the sake of this text file we will pick Bambergers, Quick Check,
and a Computer store. Plan what you are going to do, so no mistakes will be
done. If your really into this, get some money together and buy four or five
non-firing Uzi's from the sharper image (they make sounds and the shells will
fall out) this will make it look real good! Now that you have guns make some
firebombs [take a couple of empty wine bottles fill them with gasoline, take 
soaked raggs and fit them in the nozzle and presto! instant fire bomb], okay to
make it look like a terrorist group, we watch the news and find ou what there
stiles are and try to copy them (accept for killing yourselfs that the one
exception, a good terrorist is a live one) and look at there close, try to
dress like them.
  Now your ready for the hit, we'll take babmbergers first since it's the
biggest, hop in your car and drive to it, stop right in front of the doors and
have one person check if anyone is coming, wait for there signal and go full
blast through the doors and get out and start firing! go to the cash registers
and get the money, light a few fire bombs and throw them were nobody id, and
get out and away fast! before the cops can get there, the stupid security
guards won't mess with people who have uzi's (supposedly). back up and drive
away.
  Ok your at the Quick check, ram them to and fire all over, get the cash
register and some food for your party later, and some VHS tapes and the display
VCR (most quick checks have them), take the TV too, what the fuck! no get out
quick and go to computer store, but bring bags.
   You ram the computer store, take a person and hold the uzi's to his head
yelling some arabic or Middle east sounding words (makes them think that it
wasn't teenagers from america) and put everyone in a room and lock it now, get
the cash register AND the little pink slips that have CC on them! now, hit the
place with everything you got, clean them out of stock (maybe you should rent a
truck) and fire bombs the place after you let the people out.
    ok, should said this before, rent a Ryder or some kind of truck with false
I.D. and after your finihed go to a cliff or deeep lake and drive it into or
off of. I suggest you blow the truck up by driving off a cliff with your close
and all in it (except the cargo witch you accidently left at your garage) and
blow the remaining fire bombs and the gas tank. need i remind you to wear
gloves at all times. keep the uzi's for sentimental reason but don't let anyone
see them! Now go to the garage, open the food you stole sort the money and pick
slips out and give each person the same amount of computer parts and trade, or
play poker. while watching the XXX movies you stole on the ho VCR and TV. The
person whos garage your in keeps them and watch the news for any local
happening such as strange men terrorizing you town.......
