HOW TO BUILD A NUCLEAR REACTOR:

     A back-yard reactor is easy to build, and a fascinating
educational project.  It can also produce an inexpensive
supply of hot water - handy in these days of high fuel bills!
Just follow theses step by step instructions.

You will need:

* A 32 gallon plastic trash can (heavy duty, and preferably
  with locking handles to discourage inquisitive pets and
  children).

* 45 Feet of 3" PVC plumbing pipe

* 10 Feet of 2 1/2" PVC plumping pipe

* A keyhole saw

* A Hacksaw

* Duct Tape

* A meat thermometer

* 12 Standard 75mm rods of U 235

1.  Cut your three-inch piping into 28" lengths-nineteen in
    all.  Position the sections vertically in the trash.  A
    few inches of sand in the bottom will help hold them if
    necessary.

2.  With the keyhole saw, cut seven holes in the trash can
    lid, corresponding to the locations of the pipes.  These
    are for inserting your control rods.  Cut three more
    smaller holes as shown.

3.  Now for the control rods.  Cut the smaller pipe into 34"
    lengths - seven in all.  Seal one end securely with duct
    tape.  Fill each rod to the top with an appropriate
    damping material.  The "pros" use graphite, but a good
    potting soil will work nicely.

4.  Slide the fuel rods into the correct pipes.  Safety
    first!  Wear gardening gloves when handling the U 235.

5.  Pop on the lid, lining up the holes with the control rod
    sleeves.  Insert a garden hose in one of the 5/8" holes,
    and fill the trash can right to the top.  Heavy water is
    best here.  (If you live near a nuclear power plant, you
    may already be getting heavy water from your tap.  If
    not, plain water will do).

    A second garden hose will carry the heated water out,
    provided the can is higher than the end of the hose.
    NOTE:  Before doing steps 4 & 5, be sure to insert the
    control rods into their sleeves.  Otherwise, there is the
    risk of a "runaway" reaction.  The inserted rods will
    stick up six inches above the lid, so you can grasp them
    for removal.

6.  Push the meat thermometer into the small hole in the lid.
    Now, by altering the flow of water from the faucet, and
    by removing more or fewer control rods, you should be
    able to maintain a constant temperature inside the
    reactor.

    You can use the hot water you produce to run a toy
turbine, heat your doghouse, or fill a ht tub.  Any overflow
can irrigate your garden, where it will often produce
beautiful and unusual foliage.  Always dispose of spent fuel
rods properly.

* U 235 rods can often be obtained through local hobby or
  terrorist groups.  Or order by mail from "The Electric Pub,
  1113 E. 7th St. Stagfarm, NJ 08865.  You must state that
