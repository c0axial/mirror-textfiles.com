How to get them...

      Well on getting things 1, 2, 3, 4 ,and 6 you can.
      A) Go trashing through dumpsters outside
         of malls, and stores.
      B) Go through mail boxes looking for bank
         statements or bills. (Put back when 
         done or they'll cancel the card)
      C) Call up a BBS and get one POSTED for
         the whole world to see.
     *D) Call up someone who has a h/p oriented
         VMB. Ask him for a VIRGIN card and tell
         him you'll trade something for it.

  Well let's look at these ways...
 Procedure A. TRASHING
   Whatcha do is get some old nasty clothes. Like Cavaricci's, Bugle
   Boy, K-Mart, that basic shit. An old pair of Girbaud shorts won't
   hurt. Well then go to like malls, and other stores BIG dumpsters.
   Look through them for CARBONS, those black sheets of paper that
   you can use to write stuff on to alot more than two sheets of 
   paper. Well look for around 50 to 100... 

     This is what they basically look like..

   ________________________________________________
   |                                              |
   | Account Number    Exp. Date(1)               |
   | Exp. Date(2)      Exp. Date(3)               |
   | Card Holders Name                            |
   |______________________________________________|

       Differant Parts...
   
     -Card Holder's Name: Name of the person who owns 
                          the CARD.
     -Exp. Date (1-3): (1) American Express = xx/xx - xx/xx
                       (2 or 3) ViSA/MasterCard = xx/xx/xx - xx/xx/xx
     -TiDBiTS : If you examine your cardbon CAREFULLY you
                MAY find bits of information that will help
                you out. Not always though.

 Card formats...
 AMEX, VISA, MSTRCRD have from between 12 and 21 digits..
   
   Card Type                 Format of Account #
 +-------------------------=-------------------------+
  American Express        -=- 3xxx xxxxxx xxxxx
  MasterCard              -=- 5xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
  ViSA                    -=- 4xxxx xxx xxx xxx

  The drawback to doing that is... Nowadays they use the same
  shit schools do. The carbon is built into transaction papers...

Procedure B. Mailboxing
   Well in this one you go digging through people's mailboxes
   (which is illegal) and look for billing, and bank statements.
   When you find one. Take it. Go home. Open it. Look at it.
   Look for all the shit you need. Then put everthing BACK in the
   envelope. Glue it shut. Go back THE NEXT DAY and put it back
   in. Pretty simple eh?

   The drawback to this is... If you get caught your gone...
   Federal Law.

Procedure C. Boarding
   Well here all you do is... Call up a board. Look through
   the ELiTE message bases. Look for someone who has posted
   a card number and iNFO. 

   The drawback to this is that the card is probably MAXED!

Procedure D. VMB's (my own favorite)
  Well, this is my own personnel favorite. All you do is call
  up a H/P oriented scan/code line. Lemme just let you know.
  A VMB is something that is set up. You call, you enter the
  extension, then listen to a pretty long out going message.
  Then you can leave a message to the person who has the VMB.
  Well a scan/code line is a VMB that has Codes and scans on
  his VMB. Well just call one up. Tellem you need a VIRGIN
  card, unused that cardholder doesn't know is gone, and tellem
  that you'll trade them something for it. Like a VMB of your
  own or a BUNCH of codes. Then leave him someplace he can leave
  you the number. It ain't to smart to leave your voice number.
  What you should is setup a VMB of your own. Then tellem to
  leave the card number.

  The drawback to this is that you gotta have a place for someone
  to leave the number to.


Now on getting the number 5.
  If you can't get number 5, goto hell!
  Just use that as the phone number...

Getting number's 7, and 8.
  Well whatcha should do is wait til someone around where
  you live goes on vacation. Then use thier address. You gotta
  know thier names too because nowadays businesses call 
  directory assistance and see who the home owner is if it
  isn't a delivery to the card billing address. 

Getting 9,and 10.
  First of all, if you don't have a deep voice then you can do
  1 of two things. First you wait about 4 or 5 years, or your
  second choice, pretend you are a female. Yes, I said female.
  The salesperson would rather believe a female ordering a 2
  GiG deive, rather than a high pitched lil' kid ordering the
  same damn thing! Now on the mentality thingy. The ONLY cure 
  this is to wait 4 or 5 years like I said before...

Doing The actual ordering...
  1. FIRST rehearse it...
  2. No all the info clearly
  3. Get into any problems DON'T HANG UP. Just say you'll
     do business with another company, hanging them up will
     destroy the card.
  4. MAX it ALL in one day!
  5. Order the same shit from more than 2 companies. If one
     screws up then you still get it. Otherwise you make 
     some fast cash.
  6. Speak slowly AND clearly.
  7. Say you are going to visit a relative and you're at
     an AIRPORT payphone. So they don't call back and chck
     and so that you can get it delivered to the drop point.
  8. Go for NEXT DAY ups delivery.
  9. Be courteous.
 10. "BARGAN" with the salesperson for a cheaper price. Makes
     it more realistic.
 11. Say "Thank You" when you're done.

Now the pick up...
  What you should do is THE DAY BEFORE the order is scheduled to
  be delivered write out a note that says something like please
  deliver in backyard or leave in this box because you are at work.
  Then just pick it up. like the night it comes in.

That's about it. All you do now is stay low for about a week or so..

Basic Rules of carding...
1) Don't use the same card two seperate days.
2) Don't use the same drop point twice.
3) Don't brag before the actual order
4) Don't give out the card number you use until you're done with it.

One basic thing you should do is get the shit. Then buy it legitimately..
That way you'll have the proof of purchase, and you won't have the 
carded shit on you...

Well that's about it from me...

Now I'll give ya'll ONE of my many VMB's. This one isn't a CODE/SCAN line,
but you can ask me questions on carding or anything else...
