I. PREFACE

This is my first infofile as a N.A.R.C. member. For those of you who have read
"Getting Serious about Carding by Optical Illusion", this is a somewhat a con-
tinuation of things you need to know about carding which Optical Illusion did
not cover. In this file, we'll try to cover the aspects of the use (or shall we
say misuse) of a credit card, strategies mail order companies keep us from
getting away with carding, and a list of bank id numbers with their banks.


II. CREDIT CARDS versus CHARGE CARDS

Many people have the misconception that all cards are credit cards. This is of
course not true. For example, American Express is a charge card and not a credit
card. American Express is a charge card since the owner of the card must pay off
the whole amount when his bill comes. If the owner doesn't, he or she is in
serious shit. One thing good about the American Express is that it has no limit
on how much the person can spend as long as the person can pay off the bill when
it comes. Basically, the card is based on the person's good judgement on how
much money the person have. Why is there American Express Gold and regular
American Express cards then? It still has a hidden limit which you cannot buy a
Corvette ZR-1 with a regular American Express. You could however do it with a
American Express Platinum (if you can find one to abuse). This means you can buy
more expensive things at one time with a Gold or Platinum card. Credit cards
have a set limit after you you apply for the card. Usually a Classic Visa has
about $700 plus or minus $100. Mastercard on the other hand has about $1000
limit on it.



III. TYPES OF CARDS


        Credit Cards                          Charge Cards

        VISA                                  American Express
        Mastercard                            American Express Optima
        Discover                                               Gold
                                                               Platinum

Here's a couple type of cards I do not know what category they fall into since
they are never accepted by mail order companies. One of them is Diner's Club
International and the other is Carte Blanche.

VISAs are grouped either                         |
in 4XXX XXX XXX XXX or                           |
   4XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.                   This is either a C or a P.
The  2 groupings used are different for       C for Classic (regular)
each bank. There are banks'                P for Preferred (better, much better)
preferred cards that are group in
4 3 3 3.

  1234 is the bank id number.
  The bank may have more than one id number for
  their 5000 XXXX XXXX XXXX series cards.



IV. MAIL ORDER COMPANIES

Most of the mail order companies will accept Visa or Mastercard. Some will also
accept American Express and Discover. These mail order companies check the card
by either calling into a TRW center to check if the amount of the order will
exceed the limit. In either case of a approval or declining, the mail order
companies will call you back to check with you the order you have placed.
Anyways, a way of finding a valid card is to call a credit approval system
yourself. Here's some ways of checking:

     (1)
           1-800-554-2265 for check Mastercard or Visa

                for mastercard   10#1067#24#CARD#EXP#XX*XX#

                for Visa         20#1067#24#CARD#EXP#XX*XX#

               - 10 and 20 are for the type of cards
               - 1067 is the bank id number
               - 24 is the merchant number (52 will also work)
               - EXPiration must be in the form of 0291 for feb of 1991
               - XX*XX is the amount. Use a small number like
                 11*04 for $11.04.


Another way mail order companies verifying cards is to call the bank of the
card and verify the name of the person and the billing address versus the name
you gave the mail order companies and the address (drop site). So the only way
of getting pass this is to have the stuff sent to the person's address or
getting the waybill number from the mail order houses and intercept the package
at the UPS or Federal Express office before the package arrive's at the card
owner's address.

VIII. CONCLUSION

Well this comes to an end of this N.A.R.C. file. If you know any more Bank Id#'s
and the first four digits to which issuing bank which are not listed above,
please contact me (Htaed) at Nuclear Wasteland or at Critical Condition. If you
also know what bank owns which numbers, also contact me.What I really want is
the small banks that issues cards' numbers like Brookside Savings with like only
two branches offices.
