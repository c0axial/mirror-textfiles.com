HOW TO AVOID BEING TRACED ON BOC CALLING CARD CALLS
---------------------------------------------------

When using hacked Bell/GTE/Bell Canada/ALLTEL calling cards, here
is a safe way of making your calls:

Have your local Bell Operator dial 1-800-288-2880.   You'll hear
a dial tone.  

Dial 412-928-2105+0+ACN(Area-Code&Number) You are calling!

DONG!  ONCOR!  Dial the calling card.

Your call will go through.

-----------------
If your local Bell operator cannot dial 1-800-288-2880, simply dial
direct.  ONCOR uses WILLTEL's hi-cap service that does not make a 
list of ANI's.  That's why you enter 412-928-2105... to tell it the
number you are calling from.  Always use the 412-928-2105 as ONCOR 
only has certain phones set up on their network.  

If you have any questions, please contact me.  This service also
blocks any caller ID machines.
