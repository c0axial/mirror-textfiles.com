Preface:
-------
        Hopefully you will have read my other files on carding and the
 advancements in credit card fraud, but to me [and maybe to you], carding is
 becoming a boring trick, it's neat at first, but gets old after a while, there
 are only so many 10 megs and apple cats you can get.  (Be k-rad, ok?)


Student Cards:
-------------
        Citibank of South Dakota offers to college juniors and seniors a Visa
 or Mastercard issued by Citibank with a $500 credit line.  The advantage to
 these cards is that you do not have to have any prior credit whatsoever.  Real
 credit cards are the greatest, once while in Chicago I had a Visa an went to
 literally dozens of stores, buying clothing, and never once was asked for
 identification! It's almost ironic how checks require 3 forms of ID, yet a
 credit card only requires the card itself!

Getting the card:
----------------
        Run down to your local college and look in the lounge for little credit
 applications that say something to the effect of "get yourself some credit!".
 Grab several of these!  They are pretty self-explanitory.  You must again,
 find a good drop place to have the mail sent to , but this only requires a
 mailbox, to recieve these letters.  Once the application is sent in, it takes
 about a month to actually recieve the card.

Cash-now!:
---------
        This is a program that allows Citibank card holders to get cash from
 any Cirrus bank teller machine, and a cardholder can get up to $300 off of his
 original $500 credit line.  In other words, 10 cards mean $3000 in CASH!  All
 one must do is send in the Cash-now! slip with your desired PIN number, then
 within a month, you are ready to go out and get cash!

Other Uses:
----------
        After totally cleaning out the cards cash advance credit line, you can
 use the card for other things, as outlined in my previous files.
