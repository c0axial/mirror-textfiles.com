Credit theft?

What  is  credit theft?  I don't mean carding stuff (well, maybe, if you're
into  that shit) but more like using credit data to find out information on
people who don't think anyone knows about them... if you catch my drift.

Basically,  with  or  without  getting  into  TRW or one of the other major
credit  data  systems (Trans-Union, CBI, Chilton, et al) you can have a ton
and  a half of information about people sitting at your fingertips and your
voices.  A lot of times a convincing voice can change a lot of things.  How
do  you think one enterprising phreak from many moons ago walked right into
an  AT&T  office  and  conned the secretary to give him the COSMOS manual?
Don't think it's the "pretty-face" syndrome...

Anyway, the thing you are doing when you voice-verify or obtain information
about  people  is  called Skip-Tracing.  It is a system of people that work
for   credit  companies  (like  General  Electric  Credit  Corporation  for
instance;  Macys, Sears, Citibank, et al) that are employed to do one thing
and one thing only: locate people; people that move and leave no forwarding
address,  change their fones to non-published numbers, change jobs, or just
plain "skip-out" on their creditors.

At the end of this file, there will be a list of fone numbers.  Guard these
numbers carefully.  They can be your ticket to tons of information.


                       -+ TRW and Credit Bureaus +-

Credit  Data  corporations are a disaster area.  They deal with hundreds of
thousands of creditors and debitors each day.  If you have the power to get
your  hands  on  a credit report, go for it.  If you can't, then just get a
copy of a credit carbon or a credit card number.  The rest falls right into
place.

Trans-Union, the first and largest credit data system, is the worst to deal
with.   Due  to  the  influx of hackers busting into their system, they are
beginning  to scramble account numbers.  Unfortunately, they did not tell a
lot of the companies that post data on reports about it!  This is very good
for  us,  because...  well,  I'll  explain in a minute.  CBI is the best to
read, since the data is laid out for the most complex idiot to read with no
difficulty.   You can take an account number off of a CBI credit report and
call  a mail order place with the number.  They are the exact duplicates of
card  numbers.   (Stupid  people...)  CBI's and TRW (actually named "Credit
Data Corporation") are set up like thus:

ACTS: NO STATUS CHANGE REPORTED

Now...  this  shows that she has two creditors, GECC and Citibank.  You can
tell  that  she's into an Installment Loan through Citibank (the "IL" after
the  firm  gives it away) for 10K (under "Hi-Credit/Balance"), and she pays
$125  per  month  on  it  ("125M").  You can also see that she's never been
delinquent with it.

Speaking  of  delinquency... you can tell how many months due to a creditor
she  is  by  looking  at the 30/60/90 - 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, etc.. so
she's  been 1 month due with GECC now, has a $3805 balance and a four grand
credit limit, with monthly payments of $15 per month.

Simple  right?   The  "ACTS" are comments that the credit companies send to
the  bureaus  that  tell  of lost or stolen cards, balance disputes, closed
accounts, paid off accounts, etc.

Now,  once you have information like this, the rest of the process bases on
how  good  of a bullshit artist you are. If you can stumble home stoned and
convince  your  folks  that  you  went  to see "The Smurfs take Manhattan",
you're all set.

I  just  realized...  I  forgot to tell you about three more columns on the
bureaus!   Forgive  me, for I am trying to cram 132 column reports into 80,
and I am having difficulty.

In between the margain and the account numbers are three dates:

LAST-PR   LAST-PY   DT-OPND
-------   -------   -------
 10-85     10-87     10-85          (Citibank, let's say)
 10-87     11-87      4-81          (GECC, let's say)

Obviously,  the  first  one  is  "Last  Purchase Date", the second is "Last
Payment  Date  (Payment  Received)", and the last is "Date Account Opened".
You  can tell that her GECC account is an active credit card, she just made
her  November  payment,  opened  the account in April of 1981, and used the
card  last  month.   GECC,  although  it  is a credit "warehouse" of sorts,
handles  the  financing  for thousands of companies, including credit cards
for  Apple  Computer,  IBM, Commdore/Amiga, Caldor, Fortunoff, Canon, Syms,
and  almost  350  others.   You  can  never tell what type of account it is
unless you ask them... which is my next topic!


       -+ SKIP TRACING:  GET THAT BIMBO ON THE OTHER END TO TALK +-

First,  grab  your  bureau  and  check  for some "current" account, meaning
accounts that have been used within the past few months.  They usually lead
to  current information.  Check the firm, pull out your handy-dandy list of
creditors  and  give 'em a call.  The following is a transcript of a normal
skip tracing conversation...

T = Them and U = Us, just to clarify.

T: Good afternoon, this is Citibank.  Can I help you?
U: Yes, I'm calling from GECC on a skip trace. Can you help me?
T: On a MasterCard or Visa, Sir?
U: It's a loan, ma'am.
T: et me transfer you.  Please hold.

<tick tick tick tick>

T: Hello, Citibank.
U: Yes, I'm calling from GECC on a skip trace.
T: Do you have an account number?
U: Yes I do, it's 81457920345723024570832570 whatever
T: One moment...

<tick tick tick>

T: Where are you calling from again?
U: GECC.  General Electric Credit Corporation.
T: Ok, and this is for whom?
U: Dorothy Jones.
T: Ok, what do you need to know?

HA HA!  From here, you got whatever you want.  Some standards are:

"Do you have a good H# (home #) for her?"
"Where do you show her at?"
"Do you have a POB (place of business) on her?"

...and  from there on, you can get pretty much any info out of the creditor
that you want.  Usually, if the account that Ms. Jones has with Citibank is
NOT  delinquent,  they  may  not  give  you  any  information,  but certain
companies  will  tell  you  anything, even start going through the person's
payment history with you... "well, in October of 1974, she was late because
her daughter got hit by a truck..."   I think you catch my drift.

Remember   I  mentioned  Trans-Union  scrambling  account  numbers?   Well,
sometimes  if  you  give  another creditor a scrambled account number, or a
partial  account  number,  they'll  freak  out on you. There is an easy way
around  this:  remember that many creditors hate Trans-Union for scrambling
and not telling them HOW they are encoded, so just say:

"I'm reading this off of a Trans-Union bureau - you know they scramble
accounts."

Then,  they'll  either  tell you politely to go to hell on the end of their
dick, or will ask you for name or social to cross ref them with.

Remember:   Where  there  is  a  reason,  there  is a way.  Now, onto those
numbers!

If you get a bureau with a firm that is NOT listed below, you can cheat and
call  TRW  or  CBI themselves and ask to have a number decoded... the first
number listed on the bureau is the "subscriber number" which identifies the
creditor  to  TRW.   You can call CBI, give them the subscriber number, and
they'll  give  you a fone # and/or address to get ahold of the creditor at.
And you thought this would be easy...

Well, here goes.

Don't  forget,  there's a ton and a half more of these, but, as you'll find
out  by  fooling  around  with them, certain companies have "divisions" all
over  the  country,  and,  for  instance,  Sears  may  send you half-way to
California and back for an account listed to a person in Vermont.
