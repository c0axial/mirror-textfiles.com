 Program:     Calling Card Calculator (C.C.C.) v1.0
 Written by:  HACKER and MANIAC of MPI

   This program, coined C.C.C., was written to compute the Personal
Identification Number (PIN) of AT&T calling cards. NOTE: This pattern only
applies to first-issue cards. In other words, if the card was lost or stolen
(and subsequently a new card was issued), a new PIN pattern would be
implemented, rendering this program worthless. However, MPI plans to have
alternate patterns for reissued cards in future versions of this program. And
of course, the owner of the phone number that you input must own a calling
card.
   Currently, this version of C.C.C. supports trapping to a file or to your
printer.
   Number one, a calling card prints out on the owner's bill the number that
you called from AND the number that you called to. Due to this nasty fact, it
would be advisable to call from a pay phone or use a divertor. And DON'T call
your dope dealer, unless of course, he didn't make his last shipment!
   Anyway, pick up the phone.

   Dial: 1 + Area code + Number that you are calling TO.
   NOTE: For international calls (natch!), it would be 0 + 1, etc...

   You will then hear 'AT&T' and a tone.

   Dial: Area code + Number of the OWNER of the card + 4-digit PIN number.
                                                               ^^^^^^^^^^
                                    (aquired from your handy-dandy C.C.C.)

   If the PIN number is valid, you're in. Otherwise, you will be asked to
try again.

   We hope you enjoy this product of MPI and we appreciate your support.
