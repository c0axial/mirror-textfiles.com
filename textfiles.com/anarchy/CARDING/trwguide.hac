     Hit Control-G at the prompt and you will get a message saying
"Circuit building in progress"..if you are in a	V52 term, you will get a
screen clearing	code sent and then see a blank screen(its best to call in
half duplex so you can see what	yer typing).  If you have an ANSI term up
you will see a prompt that looks like a	filled in less than(<) sign.
now you	will enter the info required.  All you have to enter to	pull info
is the first line but i	will show all three..this is the way it	is done
 
 
Enter the geographic regional database code (Base). Here are some examples.
If you have a semi-complete or complete	list. PLEASE post it!
 
TCA1 - Some of California
TCA2 - More of California (southern?)
TNJ1 - New Jersey
TNY1 - New York
TGA1 - Georgia
TMI1 - Michigan
 
This is	to tell	it what	geographical area the customer is in, it really
doesnt matter which you	use, because trw will automatically switch when	it
finds the record..
 
Then the transaction code (TC) types go	as follows.
 
RTS - Most Common
OPX
RTX
(NOTE: TRW will	accept an A, C,	or S as	the 'X'	in the transaction code)
 
Base TC	ID(7-8 Character Numeric)(No space)Password(3-4	character alpha-numer
ic) LastName FirstName ...,(house #) (First letter of street name) (Zip	Code)
[RETURN] or [RETURN]<control-s>	to do a	1 line transaction
 
(Second	line)
Social Security	Number,	Age [Enter YOB(4 digits	eg. 1947],[RETURN]
 
(Third line)
[EMPLOYERS]Address city	zip[RETURN]
 
Control-S to finish the	transaction.
 
----------------
Common Addresses
----------------
All addresses have 3 basic parts:
 
1. House Number	- If the house number is more than eight digits,
type the last eight digits.
 
2. Street Initial
 
3. Five	Digit Zip Code
 
EXAMPLE: 1615 ROLLING ROAD
	 WHITE PLAINS, NEW YORK	10823
YOU WOULD ENTER	: 1615 R 10823
-RL---------------------------------------------------------------Page 2

------------
Street Names
------------
Always convert numbered	street names to	numeric. Type the first
digit of the number as the street initial.
 
EXAMPLE: 310 THIRTY SECOND AVE
	 NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10031
 
You would type:	310 3 10031
 
----------------
P.O. Box Numbers
----------------
Always use the number of the box as the	house number. Also use
the # sign as the street initial.
 
EXAMPLE: BOX 329
	 DETROIT, MI 48221
 
You would type:	329 # 48221
 
-----------------
Telephone Numbers
-----------------
TRW has	a sevice that will print out all known phone numbers that
the person has.	This should be of use to people	needing	someones
phone number.
 
To use this feature you	must input the information at the
end of the SSN#	in this	format.	SSN#<9 DIGITS>,K-PH.
This will give you the report called direct check phone	listing.
 
Example:
	(return)
	TRW
	Control-G
 
Circuit	building in progress...
