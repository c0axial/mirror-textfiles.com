A short background on Trw
=========================

     Trw is a large database in which company's and banks can run credit checks on their customers.  Example: John Jones orders 500$ worth of stereo equipment from the Joe Blow Electronic distributtng Co.  Well it could be that he gave the company a phony credit card number, or doesn't have enough credit,  etc.  Well they call up Trw and then run a check on him, trw then lists his  card numbers (everything from sears to visa) and tells the numbers, credit, when he lost it last (if he ever did) and then of course tells if he has had  any prior problems paying his bills.

     I would also like to add that although Trw contains information on mill-
ions of people, not every part of the country is served, although the major
area are..  So if you hate someone and live in a small state, you probably
wont be able to order him 300 pink toilet seats from K-mart.

Logging on
==========

     To log on, you dial-up your local access number (or long-distance, what
ever turns you on) and wait for it to say "trw" at this promt, you type eithe
r an "A" or a "Ctrl-G" and it will say "circuit building in progress" it will 
wait for a minute and then clear the screen, now you will type one of the   
following.

Tca1
Tca2
Tnj1
Tga1

This is to tell it what geographical area the customer is in, it really
doesnt matter which you use, because trw will automatically switch when it find
s the record..

     Next, you will type in the pswd and info on the person you are trying to
get credit info on:  you type it in a format like this:

Rts Pswd Lname Fname ...,House number First letter of street name Zip,L-street name,h-y now you type ctrl s this what it looks like in real life:


Ae: Dialing xxx-xxx-xxxx

(screen clear)
Trw ^G

circuit building in progress

(pause . . . screen clear)

Tca1 Rtc 3966785-cm5 Johnson David ...,456 R 48932,L-Renoylds,h-y ^s

and then it will wait for a few seconds and print out the file on him (if it
can locate one for the guy)

note: you may have to push return when you first connect to get the systems
attention.

Getting Your Passwords
======================

     To obtain pswds, you go down to your favorite bank or sears store and
dig through the trash (hence the name trashing) looking for printouts, if
they are a big enough place, and live in a trw area, then they will probably
have some.  The printouts will have the 7 digit subscriber code, leaving the
3-4 digit pswd up to you.  Much like trashing down at good old ma bell. Another way would be to social engineer an account from a local car dealership or a credit union, if you are a real good se.
