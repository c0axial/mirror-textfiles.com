  Yes,Oxygen is VERY flammable.They use it in cutting torches...

 One of my favorite destructive devices.

the #1 is simply the CO2 cartridge I described in my last post.The number two
is
   a coke can (or better yet,a thick cardboard tube) filled with finely
powdered aluminum.I say aluminum rather than magnesium because aluminum is
cheaper and easier to find,but if you have powdered magnesium,by all means
USE IT!!!

 When this goes off,a huge fireball (incredible intense light) will pretty much
kill anything for a bout 5' radius.You may say that that sucks,but you have to
see this thing going off to really appreciate how cool it really looks.
