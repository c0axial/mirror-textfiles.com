Hello! Welcome to the Jolly Roger's Cookbook III! I hope that 
this collection of text files has enough info to keep you hackers 
busy for awhile (at least until the next update!). As I gather 
information I will keep adding it and uploading it to my "home 
base" bbs's in different cities with additional numbered files, 
and an updated index that you can just replace the old one with. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this file, by the way. There are 
a few things that I want to say about the Cookbook.

1) If I ever find out that anyone has omitted my name from 
anywhere in these files withoutmy expressed permission, then I 
will immediately stop doing any updates and I will release your 
name to as many boards that I can find, urging them to put you on 
their Black List. I also, will FIND YOU! (I think you can see from 
the knowledge base contained in this collection that I DO possess 
the capability! You will wish it were the FEDS and not me!) In 
other words, be careful who you give this collection to. Of, 
course there are idiots (probably the same ones who write 
viruses!) that will misuse this information and kill some people 
or get themselves & you into a lot of trouble! So keep this 
treasure chest buried and only dig it up for those that you can 
TRUST! Also you would be screwing yourself, because I still have 
all kinds of things that I can put in here for updates, and you will 
NEVER see them if I quit updating because of some asshole. So 
think about it. If you WANT the updates (info you would probably 
have a helluva time finding elsewhere!), then STAY COOL with it.

2) I was going to encrypt these files and load/print them from 
within an encrypted program. However, I have decided against that 
for these reasons:

 a) It would then be machine-exclusive
 b) It would show that I don't trust you.
 c) Only Atari ST users would ever see it.

So I decided on keeping it ASCII. ANY machine that can read ASCII 
files can now read these.

3) Please do not use my handle to gain access to boards. you never 
know where I might show up and I will have to find you and deal 
with you if I ever see it. Don't make me do this. 

4) By releasing this database I am taking a real chance on you 
people. I sure as hell don't want MY house blown up with a paint or 
Solidox bomb! And I am sure that you don't want yours blown up 
either (or your credit cards used for tha matter). So I have to 
stress again: BE FUCKING CAREFUL WHO YOU GIVE THIS TO!!

That is all for now. If I ever have to update this, it will just be 
in the update archive as file 000.doc. Just replace the old one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Ok... here it is... long awaited v2.0.... what a bitch it was for me to 
put this shit together. Hell, over 6 months to put the update shit 
together. Anyway, response was cool, nobody fucked with the rulez above. 
I am glad. This allows me to continue the updates. You should find it 
worth the wait.

God, there is so much more to do. As you can probably see, this database 
is getting quite huge. And I have not even begun to tap the resources I 
have available to me. I can easily over the next year or so make this 
thing grow to 1600k or more..... so as long as I DON'T find this on a 
p/d bbs, and I DO see it being spread around the proper channels, as 
LONG as you guys keep bugging me for an update, and finally, as long as 
the rulez above are kept,I shall continue.

What you have in your disk drive right now is some of the most dangerous 
knowledge ever unleashed on the computer underground. Use it wisely. 
The really JUICY stuff will come in Cookbook v3.0, but let's see how 
this one goes across, shall we? The Blotto box should be enough to see 
how responsible you all are.....................

Have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Enjoy this database! A lot more to come!!! -----------The Jolly Roger

note to all warring pirates and the so-called "groups"
(You know who you are...):

FUCK YOU! You are all assholes. Acting like fucking babies like trading 
software was your fucking life or something. Like you have some big name 
or something. Do you realize that nobody gives a flying fuck about you 
in the real world? I have been a pirate for over 10 years, and have over 
4000 ST programs, over 2000 IBM programs, over 2500 Macintosh programs, 
and over 500 Amiga programs (& I do not even own an Amiga!).... and you 
do not see me kissing ass on the bbs's, or making a deal out of someone 
not "liking" me..... boo-fucking-hoo!! I really do not care. You see, 
the difference between you and me is that I do this for fun. I see no 
other reason to pursue a "hobby" but FOR fun. I hate the fucking 
politics & shit. I give my stuff freely. It all comes back to me.
It just makes me sick when I am on the bbs's and I see these little baby 
games about who did what, and who stole what loader, or re-crack, or 
whatever. I AM AN original pirate. 1st generation. Not anything like you 
baby-shit assholes. Excuse me but I had this boiling in me for a long 
time. The ST world is so small that what little we do have we destroy 
from within. And we blame Jack for it. Fuck, maybe that is the only 
thing we agree on. Anyway, where is the hacking spirit? The giving? The 
free will? Why all of the fucking ego's? It should be obvious by now 
that I have no interest whatsoever in ego-tripping. You can like me or 
hate me. But I will always be here. --------------Jolly Roger

******************** Notes for Version III! *********************
*****************************************************************

Ah..version III. Well, I never thought for a minute that version 
II would turn out to be so popular! Well, I am proud to announce 
version III, and can assure you that a version IV is in the works! 
As a student, however, I cannot say when it will be ready...but 
what the hell...it will be a long time, I am sure, before you run 
out of "toys" to play with.

Lots of interesting new reading for you in this version! A Special 
thanks to CREDITMAN, who lives in the UK and contributed an 
excellent article on carding in the UK. It is great reading.

Now, I would like to say a few words to those who insist on 
yanking my chain (or is it dick?) in the message bases here in the 
U.S.: "Whatever, dudes!" 

Now that was a few words, eh? Ok, I am debating on a new format 
for Cookbook IV...something with easier access. Hell, this index 
idea worked just fine when the cookbook was small, but now it is 
getting quite large and the articles are getting quite 
numerous...and--who knows? My laziness tells me to stick with it. 
I just might do that!

Well, the files spilled over onto two disks, so I figured I would 
include some ST-specific "goodies". They are in a file on disk B 
called "Goodie.Bag" and contain a few rarities and a few 
essentials. Some will find most interesting, most will find some 
interesting, a few may find none interesting. Oh, well.

If anybody has any comments (there always is a few slags--take 
your best shot!) then drop me a line in the usual places that one 
can find me. If you do not know where those places are, then I am 
sorry. It just wasn't meant to be. Ha Ha!

All who oppose me and my ideas and/or the group that I participate 
in can bugger off. Sure, yeah, I steal a lot of things--I am a 
pirate after all. but so do you, and don't forget it. It is 
ridiculous to call a thief a thief when it is a thief doing the 
accusing. Grow up. This Cookbook is done for no other reason but 
to share with EVERYONE ELITE some of the underground and often 
illegal as hell information that I have gathered, researched, and 
labored to locate, type, and write/compose. At least give me 
credit for that. Anyone whom I call asshole deserves it in my eyes 
for only one reason: there is not ONE DAMN THING redeeming that I 
can find to compliment them on!! For example, Automation slagged 
me for the R.C.A Slag Show II, I turned around and told them to 
piss off on that, and then said that their cd's are getting 
better. What kind of "kid" (a 24 year old one) would do that 
anyway? Certainly not the TOI, that's for sure! Oh, well, fuck it 
anyways. We are all going to die in Iraq soon enough anyway....-

Enjoy and spread! Contribute if you can! Information should be 
free (that's why I turned down an offer to publish portions of 
this thing!)!!
