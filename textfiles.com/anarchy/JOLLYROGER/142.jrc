Delay Igniter from a Cigarette                       by the Jolly Roger

     A simple and economical (everyone wants to save money haha) time 
delay can be made with a common cigarette.

Materials Required:
------------------

Cigarette
Paper match
String (shoelace or similar cord)
Fuse cord (improvised or commercial)

Procedure:
---------

1) Cut end of fuse cord at a slant to expose inner core
2) Light cigarette in normal fashion. Place a paper match so that the had 
is over exposed exposed end of fuse cord and tie both to the side of the 
burning cigarette with string.
3) Position the burning cigarette with fuse so that it burns freely. A 
suggested method is to hang the delay on a twig.

Note: Common dry cigarettes burn about 1 inch every 7 or 8 minutes in 
still air. (Now I am talking about all except American brands, which burn 
about 1 inch every 4-5 minutes) If the fuse cord is place one inch from 
the burning end of the cigarette a time delay of 7 or 8 minutes will 
result.
      Delay time will vary depending upon type of cigarette, wind, 
moisture, and other atmospherc conditions (get to know your cigarette!)
      To obtain accurate delay time, a test run should be made under 
"use" conditions.
