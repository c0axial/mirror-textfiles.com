Nitric Acid                                     by the Jolly Roger

     Nitric Acid is used in the preparation of many explosives, incediary 
mixtures, and acid delay timers. It may be prepared by distilling a mixture 
of potassium nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid.

Material Required                                 Sources
-----------------                                 -------
Potassium Nitrate (2 parts by volume)             Elsewhere in this
                                                  Cookbook, or drug store
CONCENTRATED sulfuric acid (1 part by volume)     Motor vehicle batteries
                                                  Industrial plants
2 bottles or ceramin jugs (narrow necks are
     preferable)
Pot or frying pan
Heat source (wood, charcoal, or coal)
Tape (paper, electrical, masking, but NOT cellophane!)
Paper or rags

IMPORTANT: If sulfuric acid is obtained from a motor vehicle battery, 
concentrate it by boiling it UNTIL white fumes appear. DO NOT INHALE FUMES

NOTE: The amount of nitric acid produced is th same as the amount of 
potassium nitrate. Thus, for two tablespoons of nitric acid, use 2 
tablespoons of potassium nitrate and 1 tablespoonful of concentrated sulfuric 
acid.

Procedure:
---------

1) Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug. Add sulfuric acid. Do not 
fill the bottle more than 1/4 full. Mix until paste is formed.

CAUTION: DO NOT INHALE FUMES!

2) Wrap paper or rags around necks of two bottles. securly tape necks of two 
bottles together. Be sure that bottles are flush against each other and that 
there are no air spaces.
3) Support bottles on rocks or cans so that empty bottle is SLIGHTLY lower 
than bottle containing paste so that nitric acid that is formed in receiving 
bottle will not run into other bottle.
4) Build fire in pot or frying pan.
5) Gently heat bottle containing mixture by gently moving fire in and out. As 
red fumes begin to appear periodically pour cool water over empty receiving 
bottle. Nitric acid will befin to form in receiving bottle.

CAUTION: Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may shatter. 
As an added precaution, place bottle to be heated in heat resistant container 
filled with sand or gravel. Heat this outer container to produce nitric acid.

6) Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed. If the 
nitric acid formed in the receiving bottle is not clear (cloudy) pour it into 
cleaned bottle and repeat steps 2-6.

CAUTION: Nitric acid should be ket away from all combustables and should be 
kept in a SEALED CERAMIC OR GLASS container. DO NOT inhale fumes!
