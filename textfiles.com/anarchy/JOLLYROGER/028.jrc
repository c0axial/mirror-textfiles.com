Exploding lightbulbs                            by The Jolly Roger

Materials needed:

 -lightbulb (100w)
 -socket (duh...)
 -1/4 cup soap chips
 -blackpowder! (open some shotgun shells!)
 -1/4 cup kerosene orgasoline
 -adhesive tape
 -lighter or small blowtorch
 -glue

Procedure for a simple exploding lightbulb:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Drill a small hole in the top of the bulb near the threads!

 - Carefully pour the blackpowder into the hole. Use enough so 
that it touches the filament!

 - Insert into socket as normal (make sure the light is off or 
else YOU will be the victim!!)

 - Get the hell out!!

Procedure for a Napam Bulb:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - Heat kerosene/gasoline in a double boiler

 - Melt soap chips, stirring slowly.

 - Put somewhere and allow to cool

 - Heat the threads of the bulb VERY carefully to melt the glue. 
Remove threads, slowly drawing out the filament. Do NOT break the 
cheap electrical igniters and/or the filament or this won't work!!

 - Pour the liquid into the bulb, and slowly lower the filament 
back down into the bulb. Make sure the filament is dipped into the 
fluid.

 - Re-glue the threads back on. Insert it into a socket frequently 
used by the victim and get the hell out!!

When the victim flips the switch, he will be in for a BIG surprise!

Have fun!                              -Jolly Roger-
