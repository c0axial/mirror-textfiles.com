 Take a CO2 cartridge (spent) and cut it open (use a hand held torch that'll 
run about $20 but it's got so many uses,it's worth it.).Fill it with gun powder
seal it up with a fuse hanging out and strap a hook like this to the side.

the --- is the fuse.

 hook it onto the wrist rocket light and shoot.You will not believe the range
you
can get on it.Plus it's a small grenade complete with lots o' shrapnel.
