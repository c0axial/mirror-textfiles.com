    Hello! Welcome to the world of reality where some sicko will just as
  soon take your balls off and hang them on the wall than suck down a 7 year
  old boy...In this world we live in today, one must know how to defend
  himself, as one who is defenseless will soon get attacked (Sun Tzu,
  Ancient Art of War (c) 17th century). This first article will teach you
  an opponents vital spots to give you a greater chance of winning a
  conflict. To demonstrate take the following example:
   Fighter #1) Throws a long right to #2's jaw.
   Fighter #2) Side Steps, hooks arm, Knife hand (karate chop) #1's throat,
    and breaks the elbow by falling to the ground.
     Who won? #2, obviously because he knew that his opponents throat was
  open. In this example #1 was on the ground puking blood with only one arm
  working right...#2 combined his knowledge of his opponents body with a
  little basic training and ended a fight in less than say, 4 seconds. It
  really does happen folks...

  Great eh? mwahahha...
   The most important thing in a fight (and the most neglected) is the
   block. Without a block (block-defender throws something to redirect
   attackers energy, OR moves out of the way and lets the energy connect
   with nothing, mid-air), you get hit, right? If you are occupying the
   space that will soon be occupied by an attackers foot, I would think you
   would 1) stop occupying the space or 2) make sure the opponents foot wont
   occupy the space, or 3) both (doubly sure!). You get the idea.
    After a block, The attacker is ALWAYS open. There is nothing an attacker
   can throw that won't leave him open somewhere. You quickly assimilate
   what areas are open, and then attack with an appropiate blow. In this
   process the new defender may block and counter-attack you! so be careful.
   This can be a long cycle with two smart fighters continuously blocking
   and counter-attacking each other! (You have seen this thousand of times
   in ninja and kung-fu movies...Untrained fighters simply cannot block and
   counter-attack...that's a fact, jack)
    I'll deal with different types of blows and kicks later, now we'll deal
   with the target areas...

 The Body is divided into three areas:
  1) upper position    top of head to the diaphragm
  2) middle position   Diaphragm to the groin
  3) lower position    groin to lower extremities


 1) Upper position
  A) Skull - any blow to the skull may cause cerebral concussion,
  unconsiousness, fracture, laceration (very often lethal)
   1. Parietal Bone - Top of head protecting the brain
   2. Frontal Bone - Forehead protecting brain and large blood vessels
   3. Temporal Bone - Side of head (temple) midway between the corner of the
    eye and ear. Temporal Artery is located here.
   4. Nasal Bone - Bone located in the nose
   5. Maxilla - Upper jaw
   6. Mandible - Lower jaw
   7. Zygoma - Cheek Bones (breakable)
   8. Lacrimal - Bones surrounding the eye.
  B) Eye - necessary for vision, hemorrhages easily
  C) Nose - extremely sensitive to trauma, fractures and moves directly into
   forebrain on upward trauma (causing death and/or loss of memory...haha)
  D) Ear (trauma directly to ear can cause rupture to eardrum resulting in
   Severe Pain.
  E) Neck
   1. Anterior - front of neck, contains adam's apple, fractures relatively
   easy, causing loss of ability to inhale...
   2. Lateral - side of neck, contains muscles protecting large blood
   vessels, arteries and veins and large veins - trauma resulting in spasm
   of vessels decreasing oxygen resulting in unconsiousness causing
   hemorrhage and death (I say death is better with a hemorrhage anyway)
   3. Posterior - back of neck, trauma causing severe pain, unconsciousness
  F) Clavicle - collar bone, is easily fractured, and interestingly enough
   removes victims ability to move his arm away from his body!
  G) Sternum - breast bone, extremely painful when injured.
  H) Ribs - elastic arches of bones, easily broken, may puncture lungs or
  heart
  I) Axilla - Arm Pits, contain large blood vessels, trauma causes extreme
  pain and/or paralysis of the arms
  J) Heart - in general area of left breast nipple, non-penetrating force
  can cause hemorrahage and often rupture
  K) Arm
   1. Shoulder - trauma causing dislocation, severe pain or fracture
   2. Elbow - trauma causing severe pain, fracture, dislocation, internal
   bleeding
   3. Wrist and Hand - trauma causing severe pain, fracture, dislocation,
   rupture of blood vessels
 II. Middle Position
  Diaphragm to groin, Diaphragm being the floor of the chest cavity
  A) Stomach - hemorrahage and extreme pain
  B) Solar Plexus - great network of nerves location of dorsal aspect of
  stomach (the front part). Gives off nervous control to all abdominal
  organs. Trauma causes slow death.
  C) Liver - located under right portion of Diaphragm, trauma causes severe
  pain and possible hemorrhage and death.
  D) Kidneys - located on back of the abdomen, severe pain, severe
  hemorrhage causes death. Excellent target when side stepping to opponent's
  side.
  E) Small Intestine - it can be contracted around the belly button, causes
  severe pain and possible rupture
  F) Large Intestine - in lower abdomen, can rupture, causes severe pain
  G) Lumbar Area - Arch of lower back, trauma results in severe pain,
  possible fracture, permanent paralysis to the legs and pee-pee (dick)
 III. Lower Position
         groin to lower extremities (legs)
  A) Bladder - below belly button and above groin, trauma causes possible
  rupture (all urine spills out into the opponents body)
  B) Inguinal Rings - to either side of the groin, trauma causes severe pain
  and possible herniation (he can't stand straight for about a decade)
  C) Pubic Symphysis - pubic bone in groin area; directly in the middle,
  trauma causing fracture (nothing else, he won't die contrary to popular
  opinion)
  D) Testicles & Scrotum (If they have any) - pouch containing the testes
    - extremely sensitive - trauma causing severe pain, hemorrhage
  E) Sacrum - bony extension located on both sides of buttocks, trauma
  causing severe pain and fracture
  F) Coccyx - tailbone, trauma causing severe pain and possible fracture
  G) Leg
   1. Hip Joint - prominent on top and side of leg, trauma causing pain and
   possible fracture
   2. Inner Thigh - upper and inner part of leg, trauma causing rupture of
   the large femoral blood vessels
   3. Knee
    a. Front - trauma causing severe pain, dislocation and possible fracture
    b. Back - trauma causing tearing of ligaments and popliteal blood
    vessels
   4. Anterior Tibial - shin bone, trauma causing severe pain (in most
   cases, some people can't feel that) and possible fracture (everyone feels
   that)
   5. Anterior - instep, trauma causing fracture and severe pain
   6. Posterior - back of heel, trauma causing pain and fractrure or tearing
   of the achilles tendon (making it difficult to walk)

  Well friends, there it is. You can easily make a body chart on the wall or
  just mark up your sister or what-have-you. I present this for self defense
  use only, however, if you get into the case where someone needs his block
  knocked off, go for it...

  Hello! Welcome back to the world of reality! This article in the series
 deals with ... Confrontations ...

  What is a Confrontation?

 A confrontation is the first thing before a fight, or it may start a fight.
 When you meet somebody, that is not a confrontation. Usually you won't want
 to fight him (you wouldn't walk down the street and start with everyone you
 see would you?) so if you dont know him, you walk past and don't even look
 at him. If you know them, you might look and nod. If you want to fight you
 may snarl and swear and huff and puff until your chinny chin chin hairs
 stick up. That is a confrontation.
  Confrontations happen most often in school, and almost as often in bars.
 When two people are drunk, they may start a fight without intending to...
 That's why you commonly see two best friends biffin' it out, or more often
 two strangers who've never seen each other.

  A confrontation in a bar occurs most often because the other guy (we'll
 refer to him as asshole, they almost always are) gets close and says
 something that you can't back down out of without losing face. He might say
 "Hey this guy has a slimey dick" which you wittingly reply "Hey! He just
 stuck his hand down my pants! Ack!" as loud as possible. Asshole doesn't
 have time to back down out of this so he throws a punch at you. so on...
  If you want to avoid a confrontation in a bar, just get a lounge and watch
 asshole #1 fight asshole #2 (which incidently, the best way to learn how to
 fight is to watch others and think about their mistakes), or if you have to
 sit at the bar, mind your own business, and if someone comes up to you and
 says something about your mom's gray pubic hair, you should say "I know..."
 and leave, and don't come back (who wants someone who says his mom's pussy
 really is gray?)
  The most important part of a confrontation is identifying when one is
 going on. You should be suspicious if you tell the asshole next to you that
 you pumped his girlfriend and he smiles while his hand is on an empty beer
 bottle...He's probably waiting for you to turn around which then he will
 follow up by smashing bottle #1 into your face...
  Another thing to be suspicious of is if you see the same strange people
 crowding you all night and they're all looking at you with beady eyes...

  Well, you can figure it out...

 So what I'm trying to explain to you is that a confrontation usually ends
 up in a fight, and also a confrontation is very hard to back down out of.
 Identifying a possible confrontation is the best way to get out of a fight
 (or better yet to get in to one).
