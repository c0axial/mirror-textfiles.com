Note: This is a message posted on the Pirates Hollow when me and Death were
discusing the best way we would like to die.  We're not saying that we want to
die or that you should go do this today....it's just that we we talking about
the best way TO die if we had a choice.  Lalala....have a Beer!

  Ok, here it is in a nutshell....

1. Fast Car              =              Dodge Daytona or 427 AC Cobra.
2. Leather               =   Nice smelling Black Leather jacket.  Brand New.
3. Rock & Roll           =   Rock 'N Roll!  AC-DC Highway To Hell or
                             Led Zeppelin "Communication Breakdown"
4. Drugs                 =   Shrooms, Acid, some kind of Hallucinagenic drug.
5. Sex                   =   Any girl of your dreams on the noted drug above.
(My personal choice would be Samantha Fox or Laruie from my Psych class.
 Sitting in my lap while I drive, eh hoser?)
6. Fire & Death          =   The object here is to get as much speed and
velocity as possible so your car could actually puncture a Chevron Oil Tank.

Instructions  :   Now once you've gathered these few items (actually NOT that
hard...at all.). You then prepare...Put on your leather jacket.  Get in your
car of choice (shown above, forget the seatbelt, eh?).  Put in the AC/DC tape
and crank it up to the point that the woofers are almost ripping apart from
the bass.  And your ears are starting to trickle drops of blood.  Take several
hits/lines/tabs/peices of your chosen drug, wait a few for it to take a nice
effect.  By this time your girl should have been ready (women, eh?).  So have
her get in the car...I'll leave the sexual position up to you.  So get in that
position. Now comes the interesting part.  I assumed that you've had your route
all planned by now...into some Oil Tank.  Ok, start driving/having sex (same
time) and you will begin to pick up speed/orgasm.  Is the music cutting through
your skull, slowly but surely?  Good.  Now you see the Tank in sight. Your up to
112mph.  Your girl is screaming as she comes to another orgasm.  The Tank is
getting closer by the second!  "HIGHWAY TO HELL!!!!!!!!!!" Screams through
your speakers, through your ears and eats away at your brain!!!!  212 miles per
hour!!!  The Tank is almost here!!!  You see a green 747 fly through your
girlfriends head (drugs do that eh?).  245 (only in the Daytona can this speed
be possible).  The Tank is here.....

   Conclusion  :   You hit the tank at such a velocity that you make it about
half way into the tank before it explodes. So your right in the middle of a
huge flaming inferno.  You and your girl come/cum at the same time.  The radio
goes, "Hiiiiiighway to He......."...cut off by explosion.  At this point you
are dead.  But your still wondering if your alive (drugs again).  I can't tell
you what happens next....because I've never died.  I hope this help you.  This
should make "DEATH" alot easier to handle if you think of dying in this way.
We've hope you enjoyed this.
