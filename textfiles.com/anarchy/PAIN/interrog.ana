  It is easy to intercept transmissions-but the human brain is still one of the
safest places to keep information.  This phile will help you pull information
from the bodies greatest fortress.


Pain
----

  Pain used to be the most popular sort of interrigation.  The thumb screw and
the rack were famous for "loosening a strong man's tongue." Pain, however, is a
two-edged weapon.  Its infliction may be able to bring quick results-- but a
victim pushed to extremes of pain may babble anything his questioners wish to
hear.  Torture can also harden a few individuals.  They may resist until death,
or prove poor exhibits at a subsequent trial.  Also torture can bring about
negative propaganda towards the torturer.

The Five S's
------------

  1.  Stop and search.	At checkpoints or randomn searches, clothing is checked
of weapons, and people are checked against photos to see if they are the
suspects being searched for.

  2.  Segregation.  As soon as possible, suspects should be seperated from one
another.  This helps to break down the suspect's will and allows statements
made by other suspects to be checked.  Also it reduces the possibility of two
or more suspects cooperating together to come up with a clever plan to escape.

  3.  Silencing.  A bag put over the suspect's head disori- ents and isolates
the subject.

  4.  Speed of interrogation.  Initial "safe" questions throw a suspect off
guard, and quick "unsafe" questions may be answered unknowingly by the suspect.

  5.  Safeguard.  Thick, steel, locked doors bar escape and crush the suspect's
will.

Sensory Deprevation
-------------------

  In civil custody, the same isolation is used as a tool throughout many
Western countries.  Police forces can deny access to solicitors or friends on
the grounds that information may be passed to the suspect's associates in
crime.	Techniques of sensory deprivation can aid the proceess of isolation.

  Hooded or crowned with an upturned bucket, the simple lack of light and
vision can swiftly break a prisoner's grasp on normal realities.  The use of
"white noise"--a recording of sounds across the spectrum, not unlike the hiss
of escaping steam-- blots out auditory contact with the world.	Drugs used by
Syrian captors of Israeli soldiers remove all sensations of sight, smell,
hearing and touch, but left the brain active.

  To increase time disorientation, periods of lightness and darkness may be
varried irregularly.  Meals can be produced at odd intervals so a prisoner
looses track of the days of captivity.	Even before a formal interrogation has
begun, the suspect has already lost contact with reality.

  Confusion and uncertainty are increased if his captors treat him with
absolute "correctness." Many experts now regard such an approach as more
effective than abuse or hostillity towards a suspect--which gives him a focus
for his aggression and a recognizable opponent.  The captors should reveal no
emotion and not talk amongst themselves.  They should restrict conversation
with the prisoner to monosyllabic commands and orders.

  Since Man is a social animal, the surge of relief encountered when he is lead
into a room and comforted by an apparent friend may overwhelm his determination
to keep silent.

Soft Man, Hard Man
------------------

  The "Hard Man, Soft Man" technique is definately the most interesting form of
non-drug interrogation to be produced by the twentieth century.

  It is basically this:  One interrogator ("The Hard Man") is violent and
unfriendly.  He insults and may physically attack the suspect.	The other
interrogator is nice, friendly, and compassionate.  He may offer the prisoner
something to eat or cigarretes.  He also establishes a friendly relationship by
opening a conversation, rather than by conducting a question-and-answer period.
One will hurt the subject, the other will comfort the subject, and then the
"Hard Man" will take over again.  Despite awareness of the game he is caught up
in, the prisoner finds it difficult not to relax and lower his guard with the
"Soft Man".

Breaking Alliances
------------------

  The toughest job of an interrogator is getting the prisoner to break faith
with his freinds or organization.  He must convince him that his group has
rejected him, or that they have cooperated also, thus exonerating him from
silence.  At his most effective, the interrogator uses a mix of suggestion and
deprivation to pursuade the captive to identify with the new group that the
captive represents.

  Lack of sleep is another very effective method of breaking down a suspects
will.

  Well, have phun with these methods, and remember "A phile is a phile!"
