                                Introduction

        All of you who have read all of the enlightening Anarchy files out there have
SURELY noticed one thing missing. "How to Screw-Over Public Utilities" brings a new
light to this art of trashing. This file doesn't contain boxing or anything like that
. Except maybe a few references to the Beige Box, or Cheese Box.



                        Part One : Telephone Company

        The telephone company is probably the one that pays the most attention to what
is going on out there. But they have messed on one major thing. THEY NEVER LOCK THE
GREEN BOXES. The green boxes are the green boxes along the side of the road, with th
e Bell symbol on it. They have about 20 lines running out of them to different houses.

        You can screw these boxes up very simply.....open it up, take a baseball bat,
and smash that sucker to bits, and then close it again. This will most likely knock out
all the lines connected to that box and the ones after that box. You should do th
is with the larger boxes with the double doors. (you need a hex wrench to open them).

        Another way of doing this is to take two extra long pieces of stripped wire and
wrap them around the separate lines of bolts in the box. This will cross all the lines
in the neighborhood. Or else, just take one wire, and connect it inbetween ALL t
he bolts inside. Then the people will just get static when the pick up the fone.

        You can steal a person's line, temporarily, by connecting their bolts, to yours,
by two seperate wires. Then you can call out using their line. You have to make sure
you take this off after about a night or so, because if Bell finds it, you're dea
d.

        You could hook up the "Blotto Box" to the line out there.

        You could intercept people's phone calls using the "Beige Box", and crank the
people from their own line.




                         Part Two : Cable Company

        These guys are as stupid as the phone co.. They leave their boxes unlocked too,
and every cable wire has a tag with a number on it (address). Which means you can take
out a certain person's cable, or else, steal their cable, and switch the tags on
 the wires. I haven't don't much with this, so goof with it...



                       Part Three : Street Utilities

        This means the sewer people, and the paving people and that shit. Anyway, you
guys can think up things do with it. These things are never really locked up, or
anything, so just trash, mostly. Steal the signs too. 
        I have stolen many of those construction lights on the "horses", and sold them.
good money.



                   Part Four : Water, Gas, Electricity

        I don't know. I haven't ever fucked with these. Don't goof with the gas, though,
or else you could end up on the moon. Electricity can be disabled, by chopping down a
telephone pole or something. And Water can usually be knocked out, if there is a
 well there. I don't know all the kinds of wells, so goof with it...


                              Conclusion

        I hope you guys have fun with this, and if you have any additions, leave e-mail
at the bbs's mentioned below. Thanks, and watch for more files in the "Destruction"
series, by me.
