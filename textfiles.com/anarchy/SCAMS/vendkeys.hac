  
VENDING MACHINE KEYS 
By The Pyro 
  
This worked for a friend of mine at school (I would never do anything like
this) it got him over $900 in one day. Here's how to do it: 
  
On almost all vending machines they have those damn round almost unpickable
locks. When no one is looking quickly press a piece of AIR-HARDENING clay
into the lock.  (Press hard enough to get a good impression.) 
  
Remove the clay carefully and let it dry for however long the clay has to
dry as specified on the package. 
  
You now have a key to fit that lock. (this Type of 'key' can be easily
crushed if you're seen.  But if you're smart you won't though) 
  
Have Phun!!
