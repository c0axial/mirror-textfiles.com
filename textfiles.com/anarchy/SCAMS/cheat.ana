FILE:  HOW TO CHEAT AT SCHOOL TESTS- BY: THE DATA BLITZ

I'm sure that you have cheated, bu there are a few quesions involved here.
What method did you use?  Were you caught?  And, how successful were you?  In
this tutorial, I hope to do the following things for you:
1)  Perhaps show you some new methods.
2)  How not to get caught.
3)  And, when to use what method.

The first thing that you want to keep in mind when you are going to cheat, is
"don't get caught." The reason for this is, not just because of the fact of
being caught, but also being able to get away with it without arousing
suspicion.
     Here are some methods of which to use:

PEN-DROPPING ROUTINE- If you can't get the answer, you'll want to get it from
someone who knows it.  So try this, drop your pen on the ground, and glance up
at the person's paper on your way back to your desk.  (Easy cheat!)

CRIB-NOTES- This is one of the most familiar ones.  Write the answers on a
small piece of paper, and keep it in your hand.

POCKET-CHEAT- This is basically the same as the crib notes one, but you keep
the paper in a shirt pocket (open) and hav it you can glance down and peek an
answer.

LEG-SPREAD CHEAT- I'm not sure, but I think that I may have made this one up.
It's very simple.  All you have to do, is write the answers on a piece of
paper, and put it between your legs.  When you need and answer, spread em'!!

CODE-CHEAT- This is very similar to all of the rest of them.  You write the
answers in a coded form of which you can only understand.  I find this to be
the safest, because if you are caught, the teacher will just think that's it's
a bunch of gibberish.

LOOK-AROUND CHEAT- ANYONE who can't figure out this one, must have a negative
I.Q.!!	It's basically common logic.  All you do is look aroung the room for
maps, lists of words, anything that might give you a clue to the answer.

Well, now that you know most of the familiar methods, you have to know how to
use them wisely.  Here are some tips to keep from getting caught:
1)  Make sure no one is looking when you cheat!  (DUH!)
2) Don't look puzzled.  If you do, the teacher will keep an eye on you.
3)  Watch out for those little "tattle-tale pricks!!"
4)  Do the cheat quickly without any interruptions.

Now that you have a good idea on how to cheat, HAVE FUN!!!!
