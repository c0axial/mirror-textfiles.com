
  IF YOU HAVE CABLE TV BUT ARE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE THE PREMIUM
SERVICES, HERE IS A SIMPLE WAY TO STEAL CINEMAX, THE MOVIE CHANNEL, SHOWTIME,
THE DISNEY CHANNEL, AND ANY OTHER SERVICE THAT APPEARS AS A BUSSING FUZZY
PICTURE (THAT YOU CAN ALMOST GET CLEARLY BY FINE TUNING).  THIS METHOD ALSO
WORKS ON CHANNELS THAT APPEAR AS A LINED FLASHING SCREEN THAT PRODUCE A
BEEPING SOUND.	THESE CHANNELS ARE NOT SCRAMBLED, BUT INSTEAD A GARBAGE
TRANSMISSION IS SENT AT THE SAME FREQUENCY.  THEREFORE, IN ORDER TO RECEIVE
THE MOVIE SERVCICES CLEARLY, YOU MUST FILTER OUT THE GARBAGE.

HERE IS A SIMPLE WAY TO DO THIS:

  EXAMINE THE BACK OF YOUR TV SET.  FIND THE VHF ANTENNA TERMINALS (THESE ARE
THE ANTENNA TERMINALS THAT THE CABLE SERVICE IS HOOKED UP TO) .  GET A PIECE
OF ANTENNA WIRE (ABOUT 3 FEET LONG).  STRIP ONE END OF THE WIRE AND AND ATTACH
IT TO THE VHF TERMINALS ALONG WITH THE CABLE.  TUNE IN TO ONE OF THE MOVIE
SERVICES AND ADJUST THE FINE TUNER UNTIL YOU GET THE CLEANEST PICTURE.	CUT OFF
ABOUT 1/4 INCH OF THE ANTENNA WIRE AND ADJUST THE FINE TUNER.  CONTINUE TO DO
THIS UNTIL YOU GET A NEARLY PERFECT PICTURE (YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO CUT OFF
MORE THAN 6 INCHES OF THE ANTENNA WIRE) .  GET A PIECE OF ALUMINUM FOIL AND
WRAP IT AROUND THE ANTENNA WIRE SLIDE IT UP AND DOWN UNTIL YOU HAVE A PERFECT
PICTURE.  THIS IS A SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET MOVIES FOR FREE.
