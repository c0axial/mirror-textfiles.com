We all know what the scan-tron is, don't we??????

The scan-tron are those bitchy little cards with the little bubbles
and rectangles that our precious teachers expect us to fill in with
those #2 pencils. In the past you had some machine zap through the
cards only to tell you that you have failed biology. This meant that mom
and dad are gonna take your computer, telephone, and nights on the town
and stuff them in their closet, (along with their kinky sex toys).

Well, worry no more... A group of brilliant people from the
Armed Forces Pirating Guild have come up with a simple, but workable method
to evade those little red slashes that seem to say "nice try, faggot".

***EXPLANATION***

Scan-tron machines detect right or wrong answers by picking up on led
#2 pencil marks.

If nothing has been marked at all in the given space, then your answer
will be marked wrong.  However, if there is neither a dark pencil mark
nor a blank, the machine will get a little confused and simply not mark
anything. You might say to yourself, "Well, what about the score printed
at the end of the test??", to which point we respond...

Scan-tron machines assignes a variable to the number of possible points
and the number of problems wrong. Then it subtracts one from the other
and prints the answer at the bottom. The little red marks beside your
answers represent the number wrong, however, if there is no red mark, then
there is simply "nothing wrong" as far as the machine is concerned.
And we all know that our beloved teachers pay no attention and leave
all the adding to those wonderful little machines.

***HOW TO AVOID THE RED MARKS***

There are two types of fill sheets one can receive, ones with the
circles to fill in, and ones with the rectangles to fill in.

On the ones with the circles, there is one way to avoid a slash...
IF A CIRCLE IS LIGHTLY SHADED IN, TOO LIGHT FOR THE MACHINE AND
TOO DARK FOR THE TEACHER TO QUESTION, THE MACHINE WILL GET CONFUSED AND
SIMPLY LEAVE YOUR ANSWER BE. Once again, if there is no mark, the
machine does not subtract from the total possible, and the teacher
does not notice. Don't get it wrong though, the computer will mark
a circle that has not been filled in at all 'wrong'. The only trick is
to lightly fill it in with the correct tint.

Now for the rectangles...

The same method described for the circles will also work for the
rectangle form, along with another method...
This method is, drawing many diagonal light lines through the rectangle.
However, this method is not recommended because 'teacher' will probably
catch on (some teachers are really stupid though).

One more note:

Finals are coming. Start practicing!!!

By the way, this wethod WORKS. It's kept me playing sports and
I gotten to keep my telephone, computer, and social time.
