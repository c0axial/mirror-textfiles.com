      This is for informational purposes only, 
 we do not condon ripping off the post office
 in this fashion. There are better ways!!!!!!!


      When you want to send a letter to your
 friend, put his address as the return address,
 and put your address on the front. Do not put
 a stamp on the letter.  When it gets to the
 post office, it will be returned because of
 incorrect postage, and will be sent to the 
 return address, which is where you want to 
 send it.

      This will work fine for local letters,
 but don't try it cross country. If you want to
 send a letter to Nevada, and you live in 
 Ohio, when the Ohio post office sees a return
 address of Nevada, they will wonder how it got
 in a mail box in Ohio, and they will net send
 it.
