This is the second issue of Vending Machines.  I have know about another way
to get money from Vending Machines for a long time now and I decided to write
a file on it.

DISCLAIMER: This is only information on these machines I take no responsibility
for the action or methods used in this file.

				   CIGARETTES
				   ----------

Dont smoke huh?  Well you dont have to, this file is on the art of getting money from these machines (or cigarettes if you wish).  There are only 2 items
that you need these items are:

A CIGARETTE MACHINE (The old kind with the pull knobs (explained later))
A piece of bendable metal about this size:
			      _____________
			     |_____________|

That's it for supplies.  Now comes the fun part.  What to do.  O.k. Go to
the machine (*MUST* be a pull machine, this is one that you insert your
money then pull a knob for you selection) Be sure nobody is around.  Take
your metal piece (above) and bend it so it looks something like a "C".
Now pull out a lever (If it gives you some smokes then yer lucky if not
then continue reading) once you have pulled out the lever as far as you
can (without putting money in it), place the metal strip (which shoul now
look like a "C") around the bar.  See diagram I

I.	       place "C" metal here
		      |    _______
	      |___________/	  \
	       ___________	  |    <----knob (side view)
	      |     ^	  \_______/
		 bar|

Now the bar should look something like this:

		   metal strip "C" (it will curve around the bar)
			   ______
	      |___|   |___/	 \
	       ___|   |___	 |
	      |   |   |   \______/

Now that you have it in place (Keep out a watchful eye for security) wrap it
around the bar so that nobody can see it. Then let go of the knob.  It should
(If you did it right)  Be a couple of spaces out from all of the rest of the
Bars on the machine.  Dont worry nobody will notice (But to make sure. place
the "C" strip on a Knob which sells a brand nobody wants to waste money on.)
The just go shop for a couple of hours.  If you want to test it before you do
this.  Put in your $1.00 or $1.10 (whatever) and try to pull a knob (not the
one you rigged!!)  You will find that nothing comes out. Now try to get your
money back, Pull the change return, Oh no it doesnt work.  Take of the "C"
then pull it, then your money will be refunded.  Now put it back on and go
out a shop for a while or do whatever.	Come back after about every half
hour and look around then take off the "C" strip and hit coin return. You
should get some money.	If not that means the "C" strip is gone or that
nobody has tried to purchase any CIGARETTES yet.  So sit down on  bench and
wait untill someone does.  They will loose their money, swear a couple of
times then leave.  Now make your move, Carefully take off the "C" bar while
looking around.  Then when you think it is clear hit coin return and get your
money.

This really does work so dont just sit their and dig yer noise....get some
money.....we all need it!!  And for you smokers, just take the money you
got and spend it on a pack or two....why not, your not paying for it!
