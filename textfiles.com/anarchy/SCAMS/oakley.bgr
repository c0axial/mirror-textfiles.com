                  "How to Get Free Oakley Sun Glasses"
                            by õungle õimmy

        This file is going to tell you how you can get free oakley sun 
glasses from the manufacturer.  This is very easy to do but you have to 
have it all planned out.  

        The first thing that you are going to do is go and look at the 
glasses and pick which one you want to get.  You can pick FrogSkins, Razors,
Razorblades, M-frames and many more!!Go and pick out one of the glasses that 
they make.  Now that you know what kind of glasses that you want to recieve
you have to find out the 1-800 number to dial..Well I will do that for you.
Dial 1-800-733-6255.. Once you dial this up you are going to have to know
your stuff.. They are going to ask you about what kind of glasses that you 
sent to them..Who you sent them with(ie. UPS)..What was wrong with them..

        To answer these questions you have to be prepaired..Pick one of the
shipping companies that you know.  You could say UPS, Federal Express, or
some other ones..It really doesn't matter..You have to know what kind of 
glasses that you sent to them.  You need to find out what was wrong with
these sunglasses.  One thing that you could say was that the side piece was
worped and they sat wrong on my head, or that the lense had tons of scratches 
in it and I hadn't even used them yet.  Then they are going to ask you where 
you bought them.  Well just say that you are from "Idaho" or whatever state 
you are from, and say that you bought them while skiing in Colorado, or 
Utah. Therefore you can not remmeber who you bought them from..I also don't 
have the receipt becasue it was sent to you in the mail.  UPS did say that 
they shipped it to you and you recieved it.

        Once you get through with all of these questions and they tell you
they will send you a pair and that they are sorry for the inconvenince, you
have done what you set out to do and now you have a cool pair of $100 
sunglasses being delivered to you..
