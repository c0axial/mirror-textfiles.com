                         STEALING A CAR AND WHAT
                              TO DO WITH IT

OVERVIEW
--------
Have you ever needed a ride, to get to mexico or some place out of state?
Well, I will include several proven ways (ways I have done myself) to get
(steal) a car.

WHAT TO DO WITH EVERY STOLEN CAR
--------------------------------
   When you have stolen a car, make sure to replace the license plates
with a car exactly the same, but not stolen.  If you have an enemy with
the same type of car, take the stolen license plates, and place them on
his car, and place the clean license plates on the stolen car.  Now if
he ever gets pulled over, he'll go to jail!  NEVER EVER drive the car 
in the same neighborhood it was stolen in, or keep the car for more 
than a few days.  A friend of mine (a stupid friend of mine) stole a car,
got it painted and switched license plates on it, but drove it around for
about 6 months.  He even told his parents he bought it..then one day, he
got pulled over on the freeway, and since the registration or insurance
didnt match, the police checked the VIN number (a serial code engraved on
the car) and the car came up as stolen, and he got 2 years probation.  I 
have taken two cars to Mexico (Tijiuana) and sold them off for 500
dollars a piece and taken a bus back to California. If you know a chop shop
then sell the car there, just dont keep the car any longer than you need too, 
unless you want to get caught!  

STEALING THROUGH WORK
---------------------
Ok, if you have a job at a gas station, a auto body shop, a auto paint
shop or a auto detailing shop, you can do this procedure.  Basicaly
you just need a job where people leave their cars there for a couple of
days with the keys.  Ok, when you see a nice car available, have a friend
stop by, and give him the key to the car, and have him take it to a locksmith
and make a duplicate of it.  Then look in the registration box and write
down the adress of where the owner lives.  Once your friend has the duplicate
made, get him to bring the original keys and the duplicate back and put the
original keys where you got them and keep the duplicate. Ok, about 1 month
later after the owner has picked up their car, go to their house (usualy
when you are ready to make your trip) around 2 - 3 am, open the door, and 
drive off with the car as if it was yours.

VALET PARKING
-------------
I have gotten lucky with this way once down in LA.  Go near a decently fancy
resturaunt, and bring an easel, and a large white sign with fancy black 
lettering that says Valet parking.  Wear black pants, a white button shirt,
bow tie, and a red coat.  Now, set up your easel and put on the sign and stand
out side semi close the entrance.  You wouldnt believe how many people give
you keys to their cars and even give you a tip!  Once you get the car, take
it to Mexico quick, or strip what ever pieces you need from the car, be sure
not to leave ANY finger prints inside the car, especialy if you are going
to abandon it.

HOTWIRING
---------
You need a screwdriver (or a lock punch) and an oral B tooth brush to do
this. Go to a parking lot (with no security) and go feeling door handles
until you come across one that is unlocked, ok, go inside the car, and
Pop the key hole off the ignition, this is hard to do on newer cars, and
I advise using a lock punch instead of a screwdriver.  Pry in the screw
driver inbetween the metal and the plastic dash, and pry all edges untill
finaly the ignition key hole pops off.  Then you will notice a slot for
the key, insert your Oral B toothbrush inside it (not the side with bristles
you dumb fuck) and turn..there you go, the car is started and your off to
your destination.

SUMMARY
-------
Stealing a car is easy, keeping it without getting busted is nearly 
impossible, always drive as safe as possible, dont be some dumb fuck
Evil Kaneval.  ALWAYS clean every part of the car after abandoning one
because you dont want police knocking on your door with your finger 
prints.
