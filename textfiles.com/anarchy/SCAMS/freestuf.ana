Sections
========

The following tutorial will cover how to get the below free:

  1. Mail
  2. Electricity
  3. Super market goods
  4. Magazines
  5. Phones
  6. Misc.

Mail
====

  Method 1:  If you live in a 'backwater' town then simply put the stamp 1.5
inches down from the right corner and the machine will miss it.  However, newer
machines check the whole envelope for them.

  Method 2:  Put some tape on top of the stamp so that when the machine tries to
cancel it won't come off on the stamp!  Then whoever recieves it can peel off
the tape (carefully!) and use the stamp again!

  Method 3:  Put the address for the person you want to send it to in the left
corner (return address).  Now put a nonexisting address on the right.  Don't put
a stamp on it.	Now, the post office will return the letter to the return
address which is really the place you want it to go!

Magazines
=========

  Method 1:  Go to a doctor's office, barber, or any place that has magazines.
Find one you want to 'subscribe' to and take it (under your shirt, etc.).  Now,
when you get home peel off the subscriber label (has name, address) and send it
to the publisher (says the address under the table of contents).  With it
enclose a letter saying that you are moving to and then give your address (or
P.O.  box).  From then on the magazine will be sent to you!  Normally they won't
notice...

Supermarket
===========

  Method 1:  Someday when you go to a supermarket go to the back of the build-
ing into the 'employee only' section.  There (hopefully) will be some price guns
'lying around'.  Now, slip one into your backpack that you just happen to be
wearing!!  Now comes the fun part!  Go over to the item you want and make a
price tag for it that's cheaper (make it realistic though) and you can now buy
it at your own price!  Dont forget, stamp a couple and help other citizens!

  Method 2:  This works better in department stores than in grocery stores...
First buy (legally!) an item and have it put in a bag.	Now, throw it away or
somehow get rid of it.	Then, go back into the store and select an item you
want.  Stuff it in the bag and go to the cashier and say "I got this item as a
gift and I want to return it for credit so I can buy it in a differnt model (or
color)".  She (or he) will give you the credit and now you buy whatever you want
for free!  (that wasn't that hard, was it?)

Electricity
===========

  Method 1:  This method is very simple, just put a magnet over the power meter
and it will slow it down.  Don't forget to take it off before PG&E comes to
check it!!!!!

  Method 2:  This way will only work if you have a cheap source of gas.  Hook up
a generator to the wall socket but shoot the electricty the other way.	This
will make the meter go backwards!

Misc.
=====

  Method 1:  Need some $$$?  Go down yo your friendly vending machine and open
it up!	To do this buy some air-hardening clay.  Then, pull it quickly out of
the box and jam it into the vending lock.  Make sure you keep it there a couple
seconds and you now have the key!  An advantage of this is if someone sees 'ya
just crush the key as hard as you can and it will be just a lump of clay!

Phones
======

  Note:  This is to get free phones, not phone calls!

  Method 1:  Go to a large hotel with a shopping bag and clip off a phone in the
lobby.	This is somewhat difficult as they are often locked down!

  Method 2:  Go to a Holiday Inn or Sheraton and clip the Trimline phone from
the elevator!

Money
=====

  Method 1:  For every piece of American Currency there is a corrosponding
foreign piece of lesser value.	The following is a table of some:

Quarters:      Uruguayen 10 centismo
	       Danish 5 ore
	       Pervuian 20 centavo
	       Mexican 10 centavo
	       Icelandic 5 auran

Dime:	       Malasian Penny
	       Trinidad Penny
	       #14 brass washer
