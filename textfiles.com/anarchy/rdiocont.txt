|||  Another GREAT Anarchy File!  How to make things radio controlled!!!!  |||
==============================================================================

Disclaimer: Why the fuck sould I disclaim anything?!?  YOU'RE the one to
blame when you get your damn head blown off!!  Naturally, the standard safety
rules aply here.  Fuck you! (That's a load off my mind, as incomprehensibly
vast as it might be.)

Making your bombs (or lights or traps or whatever) radio controlled is rather
expensive.  First, you get an RC car, boat, plane, whatever you can get your
evil little hands on.  The frequency of that setup should be marked on it or
its instructions.  Its vital that you know it, so keep looking til you find
it.  Usually, the frequency is 49mhtz.  This is bad.  If you make a bomb with
something like that, you will be unpleasantly suprised as the half pound
block of TNT in your pocket explodes because you walked by a kid with a
walkie-talkie.  If you have a fancier (and more expensive) model, you are
probably safe.  If not, you need to change the crystals.

When conducting electricity, quartz vibrates at a speed directly based on its
size and shape.  Man, in his questionable wisdom, has seen fit to use quartz
crystals and their vibrations to regulate radio frequency.  As you want to
change the frequency at which your equipment sends and recieves, you will
need to go to your local Radio Shack (or whatever) and buy some crystals of a
frquency other than that of the orriginal crystals.  This will NOT arouse
suspicion, and if asked, you just say you're making a crystal radio.  Fig 1
shows what these things look like.

Look for something like this in both the controller and the car, and replace
both of them with the ones you got at Radio Shack.  The car should still work
to the extent that when you push forward (or back) the rear wheels turn.
They don't have to turn much.  You also need to get a relay from RS, at the
lowest voltage rating you can find.  Then, construct the following circut to
make a latching relay assembly:
                         /------------\
----<-- Car              :     relay  :
:  :----------      /----&:---:%%%%:--&:

    :motors  :        :  coil side   switch:side
    :(throw  :   /----/                    :
    :motor   :--/                          :
    :away) />:-----------------------------/
 ---      /   ---
 : :to---/    : :
 ---batery    ---
:--------:                   ([{Figure 2}])

Basically, what all this says is that when the relay gets the power that
would normally go to the motor, it closes the switch.  When the switch is
closed, it completes a circuit that allows the relay to keep getting power
from the batteries, even when the motor is no longer getting power.  You
hook whatever devilish device you want up to the switch side of the relay, as
shown in figure 3, where the example is a bomb, so your device starts getting
power when you push forward (or backward) on the car control, and doesn't
stop when you let up.

                 \---------------------/         one that powers the car.  It
                                                 all depends on how long it
                                                 needs to remain functional.
                                                 (Not long if you're making
                                                 a bomb)

Radio controlled devices can be incredibly effective in Creative Mayhem.  A
good example would be making a setup with really long-life batteries, and
wiring it into your school's alarm system.  The alarms would be going off,
perhaps daily, and perhaps at the same time each day.  This would baffle the
authorities, as once they saw the pattern, they would post a watch on every
one of the alarm switches, and the alarm would still go off.  

With these plans, you could also modify one RC car, take off unnesecary parts to reduce
weight, and attach it to another RC car, along with a bomb.  Just use one
controller to move the working car to some place that they (those thrice-
damned COPS!) would be watching for humans, and press the other controller.
WOW!  Instant fried bacon!

RC is just another little thing that drastically expands the damage an
anarchist can do or the tricks a prankster could pull.  Please do me a favor
and use this knowledge in a way that contributes to the eventual overthrow of
the U.S. government, especialy those dealers in drugs, child pornography, and
all sorts of other atrocities, the CIA.
