       This works best if you happen to have alot of deralict friends, as
I do... Your first day of school you should bring the following items, to 
insure a prosperous school year:

   1) Fountain pen (and extra ink refills)
   2) 3 tubes of Super Glue (Krazy Glue)
   3) Pennies (about $1.00 worth)
   4) Baloons (small sized for convieniance)
   5) Mirror (small hand held)
   6) Liquid soap
   7) Lighter, (matches as alternat)
   8) Firecrackers (ladyfingers are great)
   9) Screwdrivers and other tools (small)
  10) Small squeezable bottles (like nasal de-congestant type)
  11) Wire (10-20 ft)
  12) Tape recorder mic. (batter operated pref.)
  13) Ziplock baggies
  14) Half of an orange
  15) Ligth bulb (75 watts and over are great)

       This will do for now... Some of the cool things to do are, take the 
pennies and glue them to the cafeteria tables, (and watch the custodians 
try to get 'em off). (this also looks good with silver dollars glued to the
fire alarm (so it goes off when the custodian attempts to remove the coin)
and to a door someplace.... (principals preferably))

       Another thing to do with a coin is, heat it up over a bunson burner
(in chem) and just as the bell rings, toss the coin into the hall, I will
guarantee you will know when the coin is picked up... While your using the 
bunson burner, fill your little squeeze bottle with gas, then cap it tight
and put it in your pocket... later, take a firecracker, and glue it to the
bottle, use a cigarette as a fuse extension, then put it in the bathroom, 
and get to class fast... (gas and glue make a nice flame)...

       While your in the bathroom, place a light bulb over the door, and 
when the superintendant goes to see what the explosion was, he gets a 
nice little surprise... 

       Now for the wire, if you can access a room near your locker, when 
no one is in the room, take off the speaker cover on the pa system, and 
hook 2 wires from it, to your mic. ( then into your locker) This is good
for getting your friends out of classes... Just ask for them... (use your
tools for that one, and try to be neat about it)...


        Now for your mirror, you can use this for getting your, uh...
"Friends" locker combanation.... after you get that, take that little
baggie you got, and put the orange in it... let it sit for a week or
four, then open the baggie, and place it in your friends locker... I 
can guarentee he/she will love it...

        Another thing that is fun to do, is, Take a penny, and glue
it over the key hole on your friends gym locker, just after he goes 
out, thus he has to truck around all day in his gym stuff, (unless 
you rent him your screwdriver to pry the penny off) 

        Ballons are fun to play with in chem lab, fill them with the
gas that you get out of the taps on the lab desks, then tie up the 
baloon tight, and drop it out the window to the burnouts below, you 
know, the ones that are always smoking, they love to pop baloons with 
light cigaretts.... get the picture? Good...


        Those fountain pens are cool, because if you make a slight jerking
motion with your hand, ink squirts all over the room, (or person, what ever
your aiming at) It is a good idea not to let the teachers know you have one of
those, it makes it too easy to find out who did it when theres ink all over the
principals face... (or on the floors, walls, and ceilings...)

        Liquid soap is great for use in crowded hallways, it turns everybody
into a ice skating star, (works especially well when people come in from the
rain)... If your school is anything like the one I goto, people never flush the
toiletts, A little liquid soap in here makes for a nice surprise, I mean, what
happens when the soap is not flushed out of the toilett, and the suds are'nt
flushed out either? The janitors have a really good time trying to figure out
that one... (glue a quarter in one of the urinals, always ane)... Turn off the
water under the sinks too... Getting back to the soap, it is also good on the
hand railings in hallways and on steps, If you mix perfume with it, some poor
grub has to have that stench on him all day....

        I shall go into more depth at a later date, so look for a new
volume coming to a bbs near you... This was: How to have fun at school
part 1, (By: Walkon) Part 2 will be written as soon as I have some more
time...

                          School Fun Number: //
                          ---------------------
                           By - Walkon / Sysop

  If you have'nt yet seen part I of this phile, I suggest you do so, for it is
definatly one of a kind. I shall start off with some of the cool aspects of a 
school cafeteria. As most of you know, this is not a very nice place, or at 
least it's not very nice in my school., you have to get out there and catch the
food before it gets away... but in any case...

  1) School Cafeterias: In this ever growing world of terrorism, and practical
jokes, you should learn the basic methids and uses of ketchup. This red stuff
that they use to cover the mold on the french-fries, makes a nice stain on 
peoples clothing. So... take a few packets of ketchup, and during phys. Ed. 
you take the pack and put little holes in it, then put it in someones back 
pocket, (preferably white pants), do this while they are out in the gym, and 
you are alone in the locker room... It's a gas when they get up after pulling
their pants on and there 'Bleeding...'... 

 2) Marbles are very cool... especially glass ones and steel ones, what you do 
is, get into your 'Friends' locker and (if he/she has a shelf) take a book and
brace it up at an angle, and leave them alot of marbles to play with... so when
they open their locker, they should have no problem watching them spill all 
over the floor... then they get little questions like 'Hey man, did you loose
all your marbles?' and 'Is this a throw back to your child hood?'. This is 
even better when they have to go out in the middle of a class period and when 
all the marbles fall out he has teachers all over him asking 'What do you think
your doing?' and the ever popular 'Wheres your pass?'... 

 3) You can improve on the marbles scheme by using water/perfume filled baloons
or plastic baggies. 'Cause, howd you like to go around smelling like a flower
all day long (if your a boy), if your a girl, then your a wet flower... your
'Friend' walks down the hallway 'Squish. Squish Squish' from all the water in 
their sneakers... 

 4) Do any of your parents have old contact lens fluid bottles? (small) If so
then your in luck... if you fill these with water and walk down a crowded hall
you can have alot of fun... Spray your victem so it looks like he/she took a 
leak in thier pants... in a crowded hall-way, the'll never notice till someone
says.. 'Hey, Professor Leaky... Turn off the faucets...'... If you want to 
be even meaner, then you can take the bottle and fill it with the juices from
a rotten egg.. now its' one thing to piss in your pants, but if you go around 
smelling like rotten eggs all day, whew... I can almost guarntee a suspension
or a free trip home... (very embarrasing)... 

 5) During your free period, goto a pay phone and call the front office, and 
have your victem paged to the front office... tell the front office that you
are the boy/girls father and your coming to pick them up for an emergency
doctors appointment... and to go and get his/her books... then they sit in 
the front office for 1/2 an hour, (and miss class).. then they say  ' Hey, 
did you and some of your friends pull this stunt so you wouldnt have to goto
class?!?!?!.. Goto the principals office NOW!' Good 'eh?

 6) Heres some fun to have at the library... goto the magazine rack and 
replace the Sports Ill. and the other widely read magazines with Playboy and
some of the others... (rip off the Sports. Ill. cover and put Playboy inside)
You should see the expressions on the girls faces when they open that sucker 
up... (or on the teachers faces)...

 7) Hide a cheap radio ($3.00 things that you get from radio shack (am)) and 
set it to blast when the locker is opend. (set it on some queer station) To
set the wiring up.. Open up the radio and disconnect one of the wires going 
to the switch, turn the switch on. Now take the wire you just disconnected and
run it to another switch, and a wire from the other end of that switch to the
old switch... now tape the switch into the locker in a way that whenever the
locker is opend, the switch will go on, and whenever the door closes, the  
switch will go off... this is embarrasing, especially when you cant find the
radio to turn it off... 

   Well, I have coverd just a few more aspects of life in a school... so I
will be signing off now... call my bbs at: 201-575-4010, and keep those
teachers/students hopping... and look for.. yes I will... PART /// coming
soon to a terminal near you...

  I can safely presume that most of you have seen at least one of my files, so
you know what you are getting in this file...  I have thought this file out
fairly hard so it should be of semi-decent quality...

  Have you ever noticed that the water fountains in schools have two holes in
them (for the water to come out of)... I have no idea why they are there...
(maybe some one put them there for us to put to some GOOD use), take some
chewing gum and plug up the bottom hole, this is great because that forces the
water out of the top hole at HIGH PRESSURE thus getting alot of people wet
(espoecially the person getting the drink)... to give you an estimat of how
much power there is, in our school, the auto shop ceiling is about 20 ft up,
and when the gum is in place the water hits the ceiling (if it wasnt there it
continue another 5 to 10 feet...)

  You people have all seen those little (dont get me wrong, I dont play with
these things (too much)) toy pellet guns that shoot the little yellow plastic
BB's... well, these are good in the hallways between classes (or out the
windows at the people that are cutting classes) just be carefull not to hit
people in the eyes... (un-less it is intentional)

  I dont know if this is standard in all schools (I suppose this will pertain
to some of you), you may have these long 'Airconditioner/Heaters' (they never
work) BUT... in our school these heaps of junk have a small opening for a
5/32 Allen key, these are usefull for turning off the cold air in the winter
and turning it on in the warmer months...)

  Hey, you all go into food stores or hardware stores at one time or another,
you know the vending machines (that dispense gum or other junk), well, where
I work, they have just installed one filled with little containers of 'SLIME'
so? What does this have to do with school? Well, this stuff is FUN in the halls
and the cafeteria... This stuff is very annoying when you get it down your
back... And speaking of backs...

  Itching powder is fun... (especialy if theres someone in front of you in a
class or two that you dont like..) just dump a little of this down there back.
WHAT? You dont have any... well, as I said before, I work in a hardware store
and I can tell you for a FACT that the fiberglass in isulation itches ALL DAY!
all you have to do is get some insulation and shake it out onto a peice of
newspaper (tear it up a little if you have to) and soon you will have a small
pile of shards of fiberglass.. put it into a small baggie or film container,
and keep it in class with you... NOTE: Use gloves when you do this... this WILL
drive you insane by the end of the day if you get any into your hands...

  Do you have any dead animals laying around? A dead rat or some animal you
have scraped up off the road? If not you should have one... you take them into
the bathrooms at school and lift off the top (exposing the flush mechanism) and
you insert the animal into there... if it's warm, and moist then this animal
will start to rot, and smell extreamly bad... you may get lucky (if they cant
find it) you MAY even get a day off from school while they look for it...

  Hey, if your school has a computer classroom that has a small multi-plexer
(so the teacher can see what you are doing)... well.. have some fun.. change
the cabels around so the teacher does not know who she is looking at (or you
can make your terminal the master terminal (hahah))


  Ok people, I have again pointed out some more of the more interesting aspects
of school life... and I may possibly come out with a School Fun IV ( I have a
LOT of ideas... but I want to get the good ones out first... ) Oh, By the way
I am planning to come out with a 'Guide to Terrorist Activities' and if your a
Fed thats reading this... no I am not crazy, just a good U.S. citizen, and when
you think about what Quadaffi said (about comeing to fight US, right in OUR OWN
streets... I feel that we should know a little more about how these people
think, and how to combat them...)

   Ok dudes... look for some more files from me soon... (your best bet is to
call my bbs and see if I have any new ones on my list... (they usualy appear
on my list first... hmmm... I wonder why???))
