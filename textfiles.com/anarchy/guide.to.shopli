        Ever since my interest in G-Philes, I haven't seen anything dealing with one of the most important things one must know: shoplifting. There are certain things a person MUST know when trying to do this, because it is easy to get yourself caught if you are not careful. Here are some tips that can make your experience in shoplifting more rewarding and less dangerous to your freedom.

     1) Don't be too noticable. Dont wear clothes that could attract the attention of the store owner (orange, flourescent, etc.). Try to blend in with the woodwork.

     2) Don't act like you are in a great hurry, or you might look suspicious. Casually walk in and take what you need and casually walk out. NEVER, I repeat NEVER run.

     3) If possible, get a friend to go with you and attract the store owner's attention while you steal things from behind his back.

     4) If you get caught, dont try to violentley escape from him and run away, you should act real sorry and cry if you can and he might let you go. If he decides to press charges, never admit to the crime.

     5) Be on the lookout for plainclothes police men who seem to be looking around at everyone. If you think you see one of these people, leave the store immeadiatley and come back another day when the asshole isn't there.

     6) It is better to shoplift in a place with many different means of escape, like a mall. It's a great place 'cause you can just go from store to store. If a chase should occur, go to the area that has the biggest crowds, and go into a store and hide somewhere until you can can get out of the mall.

     7) Do not spend a lot of time trying to hid the merchandise that you are stealing. A good time to steal things is in the fall and winter because you can just slip them into your coat and walk out of the place.

     8) Look out for one-way mirrors. If you are in a department store where there is a big mirror in front of you, do not steal anything from there. There is often someone sitting right behing the mirror watching everything you do.

      I hope this phile will help you in your further ventures into the stores. Steal what you can and get out. DO not go to the same one every day. And above all, just use your common sense. It isn't that hard.
