HOW TO MAKE TNT



BY  THE SCREAMER

*S*C**RE*A***M**E**R*



PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT EXPLOSIVE

COMPOUND IN USE TODAY IS TNT

(TRINITROTOLUENE).  THIS AND OTHER VERY

SIMILAR TYPES OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES AR ALL

USED BY THE MILITARY, BECAUSE OF THEIR

FANTASTIC POWER- ABOUT 2.25 MILLIONS

POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH, AND THERE

GREAT STABILITY.  TNT ALSO HAS THE

GREAT ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE TO BE

MELTED AT 82 DEGREES F., SO THAT IT

CAN BE POURED INTO SHELLS, MORTARS,

OR ANY OTHER PROJECTILES.  MILITARY

TNT COMES IN CONTAINERS WHICH

RESEMBLE DRYCELL BATTERIES, AND ARE

USUALLY INGNITED BY AN ELECTRICAL

CHARGE, COUPLED WITH AN ELECTICAL

BLASTING CAP, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE

OTHER METHODS.



PREPARATION OF TNT



1. TAKE TWO BEAKERS.  IN THE FIRST

PREPARE A SOLUTION OF 76 PERCENT

SULFURIC ACID, 23 PERCENT NITRIC ACID

AND 1 PERCENT WATER.  IN THE OTHER

BEAKER, PREPARE ANOTHER SOLUTION OF 57

PERCENT NITRIC ACID AND 43 PERCENT

SULFURIC ACID (PERCENTAGESS ARE ON A

WEIGHT RATIO RATHER THAN VOLUME).



2. TEN GRAMS OF THE FIRST SOLUTIONS

ARE POURED INTO AN EMPTY BEAKER AND

PLACED IN AN ICE BATH.



3. ADD TEN GRAMS OF TOLUENE, AND STIR

FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.



4. REMOVE THIS BEAKER FROM THE ICE BATH

AND GENTLY HEAT UNTIL IT REACHES 50

DEGREES C.  THE SOLUTION IS STIRRED

CONSTANTLY WHILE BEING HEATED.



5. FIFTY ADDITIONAL GRAMS OF THE ACID,

FROM THE FIRST BEAKER, ARE ADDED AND

THE TEMPERATURE IS HELD FOR THE NEXT

TEN MINUTES, AND AN OILY LIQUID WILL

BEGIN TO FORM ON THE TOP OF THE ACID.



6. AFTER 10 OR 12 MINUTES, THE OU TOO WILL HAVE TO TAKE

A NICE LONG SHOWER.
