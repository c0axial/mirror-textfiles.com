Well the ingredients are:
    Potassium Nitrate 85%
    Carbon(Charcol)   12%
    Sulfur             3%
 
They are rough percentages but try
a little like that and play with it.
The more Potassium you add the faster 
it iwll burn. Less sulfur slower. Less
carbon the less it will burn. What
you will do is just put them all in 
a mixing jar, I used a little cardboard
box with low sides and then ground it
up and mix together. You can get Potassium
Nitrate at most drug stores. It is commonly
known as Salt Peter.     Have fun.
