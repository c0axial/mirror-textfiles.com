Part 1:  Uniforms, equipment, and weapons
=========================================
                   
        A.  Clothing--
            ----------
 
                1.  Most Special Forces and SEAL personnel prefer to wear black 
                clothing.  However, during the Vietnam years, U.S. forces 
                operating in south China, Laos, Cambodia, North Vietnam, and 
                South Vietnam preferred to wear Tiger Stripe camouflage.
 
                2.  In Vietnam, most personnel wore special boots called jungle 
                boots.  The upper half of the boot was canvas to let the feet 
                breathe, the lower half was leather.  The soles were very 
                similar to the waffle stompers on hiking boots.
 
                3.  Most personnel operating in Southeast Asia wore bandannas 
                or bush hats.  No one ever wears a helmet during Special 
                Operations.    
 
 
        B.  Equipment--
            -----------
 
                Personal equipment carried by Special Ops personnel always has 
                to be in small quantities.  The reason for this is fairly 
                obvious, if you are walking thirty or forty miles, you don't 
                want to carry a pack, or anything else for that matter, to keep 
                you from tiring out. 
 
                First, you would probably need some sort of backpack or butt 
                pack to carry loose equipment.  You can carry energy-giving 
                food, water, insect repellent, dry socks, scivvies, grease 
                paint, compass, first aid equipment, carabiners, rope, and 
                whatever stuff you can find.
 
                C.  Weapons--
                    ---------
 
                        1.  The insignia of the U.S. Army Special Forces is a 
                        turquoise coloured arrowhead patch, with the Airborne 
                        tab directly above the skyward arrow.  On the patch 
                        itself, there are three lightning bolts.  They stand 
                        for the three methods of fighting: hand-to-hand,
                        weapondry, and aerial combat.
                            Suggested fighting knives to be carried by Special 
                            Ops personnel are, the M7 bayonet for use with the 
                            M-16 rifle, the Air Force pilots' survival knife 
                            with sharpening stone, the Marine Corps fighting 
                            knife (similar to the Kabard m1000 knife)
                        2.  For those of you who prefer weapons that make a 
                        bang, here are a few suggestions.  It is wise to carry 
                        weapons that the other side uses when going on covert 
                        missions.  For instance, in Vietnam, Special Forces 
                        carried AK-47 assassinators and penetrated the enemy 
                        camps by using the Vietnameses' own stuff.  
                        3.  The last category in the weapons department is 
                        Pyrotechnics, not synonymous with Pyromania.  As far as 
                        grenades go, you can use either a personnel-propelled 
                        frag or a rocket propelled grenade.  The two best frag 
                        grenades are the Frags' 1 and 2m.
                            Explosives used most of the time consist of C-4.  
                            The M-18 Claymore mine uses it.  The Claymore is 
                            set up on four stilts, and is labeled "FRONT, 
                            TOWARDS ENEMY." It is detonated by tripwire or by 
                            an electric switch.  An added hindrance are 
                            electric ground mines.
Part 2:  Tactics in Guerilla Warfare
====================================
 
        A.  Movement to a determined target--
            ---------------------------------
                1.  Wear dark clothing that will hide you at night, but will 
                make you blend in during the day.  
 
                2.  Do not wear any sort of rank, insignia, or identification.  
                However, it would be wise to take a tip from the SEALs; wear a 
                number on all of your clothing, so that your own people can 
                identify you if you become a casualty.
                
                3.  Travel in small parties of four to ten team members.
                
                4.  Always take someone who is familiar with the terrain your 
                team will be traversing.
 
                5.  Never talk, use hand signals.  If a twig breaks, or a dry 
                leaf cracks, it could be anything; like an animal.  If you talk, 
                it flows over the ground, even if you whisper.  In the still of 
                night, a whispering voice is definitely human.  
 
                6.  Have your escape route covered.  Choppers waiting in a 
                landing zone are always helpful. 
 
                7.  Learn how to walk in a crouch.  Learn how to sneak around 
                like the enemy.  Take careful steps, always make the ball of 
                your foot touch the ground first.
 
                8.  If you spot enemy personnel, do not look at them.  If you 
                think about it, someone staring at you is always going to make 
                you turn around and see them; therefore, always look just to 
                the right or left of the enemy soldiers.  Believe me, it's 
                weird but it's TRUE. 
 
        B.  Attack and psychological warfare--
            ----------------------------------
 
                1.  Say you have a specific target in mind, like a specific 
                person, and you have been instructed by your superiors or 
                employer, to terminate him with extreme prejudice; in order to 
                complete your mission you must have a devised plan.  It would 
                be a good idea on having at least half a dozen.
 
                    If you are planning on making your target a casualty via 
                    knife, use your imagination.
 
                2.  Psychological warfare is always interesting.  We will give 
                you as examples, some of the methods used by MACVSOG team 
                members in Southeast Asia.
 
                    During the war in Vietnam, members of MACVSOG set up fake 
                    radio stations in Southeast Asian communist countries where 
                    they broadcast false information about U.S. and allied 
                    military troop movements, and such things like that.  On a 
                    close range dummies would prove very helpful in decieving 
                    the enemy. They would , of course, attack the wrong places, 
                    and then you can nail those commies from the back.   
                    Lastly, for those of you who are interested in scaring the 
                    hell out of the enemy, frequently the Green Berets would 
                    locate an enemy campsite at night, find two men sleeping 
                    near each other, and then slit the throat of one of them.  
                    After this, the others will be too scared to sleep in the 
                    next few battles, and they will lose.  
                C.  Prisoners Of War--
                    ------------------
 
                    We once heard about an intersting technique that the SEALs 
                    used in Vietnam.  It went as follows:  First, you've got a 
                    target in mind.  Again, we assume a "tax collector."  Your 
                    mission, should you decide to accept it, is to find the 
                    man and bring him back to base. 
                D.  Do's And Don'ts in Guerilla Warfare--
                    --------------------------------------
 
 
                        1.  For rapid fire of ammunition, tape two magazines 
                        together, so that the receiving ends face out.
 
                        2.  For the ability to climb rapidly, cut off the two 
                        middle sections on the ball of your jungle boots' waffle 
                        stompers.
 
                        3.  Always have a piece of safety tape wrapped around 
                        the grenade and the spoon.
 
                        4.  Use tracers at night.
 
                        5.  Tie your knife sheath upside down on your 
                        suspenders, so you can merely reach across your chest 
                        and grab your blade very quickly if need be.
 
                        6. Put tape around your dog tags, (if you wear them) or 
                        interlace one or two in your shoe strings.
 
                        7.  Do not wear an ID that could connect you as being a 
                        citizen, or a representative of the U.S.  If you break 
                        the rules, don't involve the government.
 
                        8.  Know what kind of food is available in the jungle, 
                        or wherever you are.
 
                        9.  If you are carrying magazines in a pouch, place 
                        something in-between each one, like empty cigarette 
                        packs, so they won't rattle.
 
                       10.  Use silencers when available.
 
                       11.  Use starlight scopes at night.
 
                       12.  Never let anything get wet.
 
                       13.  When using a radio, only answer yes and no by keying 
                       the mike once for "yes," and twice for "no."
 
                       14.  Make sure everything you have, including yourself, 
                       is very dark in colour.
 
                       15.  Hit quickly, and get the hell out of there fast.
 
                       16.  HAPPY HUNTING
