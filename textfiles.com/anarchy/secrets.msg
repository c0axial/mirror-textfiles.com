Knowledge is Power. . .



From: Magnolia, (Backwoods) MS

Thursday, 6:45 p.m.



Dear Friend and Subscriber:



        It was a nightmare. . .A few weeks ago - early

morning as  I was sleeping.  I heard a boom--it sounded like

a grenade was tossed under my bed.  Naturally, I rolled out

of bed grabbing for "Betsy..." (instinctively)



        What was it?  Only lightning--but it hit so close and

 so powerful that it literally split a tree in half near my

 house.  But that's nothing, that was just the beginning.

 Over the next 24 hours it stormed heavier than anything I've

 seen in my 35 years--over 9 inches of rain--tornadoes, and

 the worst flooding I've ever seen.



        At first, I wasn't concerned.  But as I watched

 throughout the day, the water rose higher and higher.  Late

 that afternoon my brother ( a local rescue worker) came with

 a warning that I MUST EVACUATE.   He warned that a "wall of

 water" was on its way down the river.



        As you might imagine, I didn't want to leave my work.

I was facing deadlines and  needed to stay with it. . .  I

explained how I couldn't possibly leave my cabin house, after

all it's my personal office--it's where I do all my writing

and computer work. . .  "No way," I said. . .



        Finally, despite my stubbornness, I did evacuate, but

not until I glanced back toward the river (still arguing) and

saw a tree (at least four feet in diameter) with roots

reaching into the sky about 6 feet, traveling with the

current of the to terential waters at what looked to be 40

miles per hour.  I have never seen a river rise and become so

fierce, in such a short time.



        A tornado touched down just north of me and cleared a

two mile track, literally flattening everything in its path.

The power of nature amazes me.



        The end result?  Flooding.  And I mean flooding like

I've never seen.  In a matter of hours--my home was several

feet underwater. . .  I could only watch as much of my most

precious work--personal and business, went under.  Many of my

work projects, furniture, computers, fax machines, BBS

System, were damaged--some were saved, but the most grieving

losses were the many priceless heirlooms--my deceased wife's

wedding rings, my deceased grandmother's bible (something the

family has fought over for years) but granny gave to her

"Michael."



        Then I look at you, my subscribers, in L. A., who

were thrown out of bed unexpectedly at 4:30 in the morning by

the earthquake.  Many of you, I am sure, can relate to my

losses.



        I was speaking with Gary Halbert, who had just

 returned from Los Angeles before the quake, he said that "30

 second quake" seemed like an eternity--I can relate.  I'll

 never, as long as I live, forget the days of waiting to see

 how much damage was done--what was lost--what we could save.

 It's an awful gut wrenching feeling.



        Finally, once we were allowed to enter, everything

was devastated.  As I drove up I saw my barbecue grill up in

a tree.  My lawn furniture was completely gone... the housing

to my free flowing artesian well--gone.  But the worst

nightmare was

 when I entered my home--what was left of it.   Hell, friend

to be quite honest with you--I looked around--and then sat

down in a state of shock. . .  fighting back the tears.



     As many of you know I've been working 18 to 20 hours a

day on some projects for months and months.  At this moment,

we aren't sure just exactly how much has been lost.

Fortunately we had computer backups of a lot of our work.

However, diskette s, paperwork, and computer hardware was

damaged.  We'll know as we wade through the mucky mire over

the next couple of weeks just how bad it is and how much can

be saved.



        Oh well... enough of the pity party--let me share

 with you the greatest lesson I've learned from this, and

 hopefully many of you who have or will suffer loss in the

 future will adopt my philosophy in situations like this.

 As you may expect, it's sort of radical--but that's my style

 anyway, right?



        The most important thing is: I'm alive.  And if you

were a victim of the quake, be thankful if you're reading

this, because you too still have the most precious gift of

all--life.  As I was swaying between anger, hurt and

puzzlement, I received a call from a friend who

had heard of the flood.  He shared something with me that I

wish to pass on to you.



        My friend is a veteran of the Vietnam War.  He served

in battle--and the stories he's often shared with me are

shocking to say the least.  He told of the emotional traumas

and the constant expectation of catching a bullet.  Friends

were so commonly killed that everyone become psychologically

distant--tired of hurting--tired of wondering who would be

next to die.  Finally, you accept it--the jungle--machine gun

fire--ration food--and death become your life.  Home becomes

a distant memory--a haze or semi-reality. You develop a

completely different psyche.  You learn to accept whatever

comes your way.  Finally, my friend shares with me how he and

many others dealt with such emotional turmoil. . .



        If you are a veteran you'll remember this--a

statement that became the chant of many a marching soldier--

the dying words of many. . .



                    It Don't Mean Nuthin'



        What does this mean?  What relevance does it have to

this month's issue of Inside Secrets?  Well, there's a lot of

truth to this "country boy" statement.  It became the frame

of mind and way of life to literally tens of thousands of

soldiers during a time of crisis--and now it rings true to

me.  It's fact.  What matters?  So what?  My house is all

screwed up. Many items I cherished are either washed away or

ruined. . . Hundreds of hours of hard work must be  re-done.



        But, finally, I feel like my friend.  I could use my

energies to groan, moan, and bitch--or I can accept, that

catastrophe--pain--loss is inevitable.  It's a part of life.

We must accept it and fight onward with the same triumphant

attitude--It don't mean nuthin'. There's up's--down's--

successes and  losses. . . Then death.



        As I write this, I am reminded of an old preacher I

once knew.  He made a statement nearly 20 years ago, that I

have never forgotten. . . It's one of those things that you

either believe or you don't.  I do.  He said:



 If it won't matter 10,000 years from now--It don't matter

now. . .



        So, why do we place so much emphasis on the things of

this life?  Perhaps we should just prepare for death--be

ready--and just glide through with the soldier's attitude.



        It's hard for me to describe to you the comfort I

felt when Jimmy made me repeat this silly--almost ridiculous

statement over and over--but I can say--it worked.  My

attitude changed.  Now, I'm back up and running--but with a

slightly different attitude. I won't develop an ulcer over

all the day to day stresses now. . . Isn't it strange how

something as simple as "It Don't Mean Nuthin'" can help you

re-hash your position in life?



        This month, we are going to tinker with electronic

technology--but in a different way than anything we've done

before.  Many of you are having a "hay-day" with Electronic

Marketing, so, I'm about to give you a crash course in "on-

line" investigating.



        Now, I'm sure there are those of you who just tucked

your head under your arm because you expect what I'm teaching

will be extremely "technical."  But, you're  in for a

surprise.  I plan to share how most of you have everything it

takes to. .  .



                Be Your Own Digital Detective!



        You're about to become one of the few people who

realize just how many ways you can use on-line resources.

You're about to see how the advancements in technology are

nice, convenient, and even profitable.  And at the same time

could (and most probably will) be the very tool of hi-tech

modernized businessmen to undercut, out-wit, and excel in the

business world.   Trust me, I'm talking about one of the most

dangerous transitions that has ever taken place in the

business world, with . . .



                  The Global Super-Highway!

                          a/k/a the

                  Information Infrastructure



        Right now, and for the next couple to three years,

until someone figures out how--and who--will regulate and

control the electronic advancements that are taking place,

the less astute business man is in real danger.  The dangers

are very broad. Space won't allow me to cover them in full,

but let's take a look at a few ways the "Global Information

Infrastructure" could very well be your worst nightmare--or

the best thing to ever come along--depending on whether

you're willing to make a few changes.



        From a detective's point of view, what is happening

is. . .



    Your Business and Private Information Is An Open Book

               To Anyone Who Owns A Computer!!



        As I've told you in prior letters, I've assisted

attorneys, insurance companies, and others, to find

information.  Information about a wide variety of situations,

products, chemical formulas, product defects, demographic

information. . . and on and on.



        I've worked almost every type case you can imagine.

But seldom have I worked any kind of case that I didn't

resort to on-line information.  What is on-line?  Well, since

I am sure many of you have little or no understanding of all

the "technical computer B.S." I'll try and make it simple.  I

know you'll want to better understand, once you realize how

much of an edge I'm about to give you.



        I'm going to address every aspect of using on-line

technology, down to the bare basics--and then on through the

roof.  I have every intention of making this the very best

part is: this is just the beginning.



        Friend, I've had it with some of the crap I see.

Chicanery is not a prerequisite to business success.  Good

clean honest business works just fine.  Anyone can  enjoy

tremendous success if they're willing to follow instructions.

But, please, d o follow my instructions.  This letter is the

first of many that will ultimately give you superiority over

even the best of  the best. The way we do business is

changing--you have the chance to learn now--and be the first

in!!!



      Whoever Has The Best Information Ultimately Wins!



        I want to broaden the scope of my newsletter to cover

a lot of interesting subjects.  From carpentry to hydrator

operator, I've always excelled.   I love what I'm doing--and

from here on, I going to open up and share with you a monthly

jolt of powerhouse, no bull, mind boggling, life changing,

business boosting, creative ideas that will give you "inside

secrets" to success overall.



        Now, On-line information is nothing more than

information stored on another computer and made accessible to

you via either your telephone line, direct connection or via

satellite.   If you don't know anything at all about

computers, that's fine.  In fact, that's probably best,

because then you will have less to unlearn. I've never taken

a computer course of any kind whatsoever, but I can operate

and thousands of "on-line" services.



        First, you MUST overcome your fear of computers.

It's much easier than you think.  I can teach anyone how to

use a computer to find answers to almost anything they wish

to ask. . . ANYTHING!  That's almost unbelievable, but until

you've been at it as long as I have, you just can't imagine

how much information is floating around out there.  It's much

bigger than you think.  In fact, once you dare to "take the

plunge" you will never look back.  Let's take a look at how

on-line surpasses conventional research and  footwork:



        Let's use my friend Gary Halbert for example. When I

first shared with Gary the power of my concepts with

Electronic Marketing, he took off flying around the country

interviewing "techies." He flew from city to city--state to

state, in search of  more information.  He wanted to put his

own twist to what I was doing.  He saw the excitement

and frenzy of the crowd as I shared my strategies at "his"

seminar.  This meant big bucks--mucho fungolas--and he wanted

a bigger piece of the action!  Anyway, I continued my

studies, while Gary traveled literally thousands of miles

interviewing "experts."



      I told Gary to wait and I would find time one

evening, go on-line and answer any questions he wanted

answered.  But you know Gary, he's impatient.  Anyway to get

to the point, Gary spent thousands of dollars and weeks of

time seeking answers to his specific wants for electronic

marketing.  Then one evening, I took a few minutes, went on-

line and found everything Gary wanted--and much, much, more.

How long? Well. . .



           I Found Every Answer In 12 Minutes For A

                       Measly $7 Bucks!



      Think about it.  I was on-line for exactly 12 minutes

and 38 seconds.  My cost was a whopping $7.18. I got every answer 

(from much more reliable and experienced sources) and

it took over 2 hours to print all the data!  This, my friend

is what I want to teach you.  How to get more information--

more accurate--and faster--than everyone around you.  You

will learn to take advantage of the abundance of hot-juicy

info in more ways than I have room to list. . .



      Example:



     *  Tracing/Locating/Collections.  On-line sources

will allow you to cost effectively find most "missing

persons" and do so in minutes.  Even if your target is trying

to hide--the databases (on-line information sources that most

people don't even know exist) are available to you, too.

They are completely menu driven, meaning you simply select

the answer you're after, type in the name, etc., and get your

answers while you're still connected to the service.  Then

generator. . . (Literally thousands of people are looking to

find lost relatives, missing debtors, etc., daily!) One such 

source is: The National Publishers Address would have believed 

that information is readily available to you!!  It takes me an 

average of 17 minutes to find almost anyone on earth with nothing 

more than a name and an old address.



        I want you to know how to do this for yourself--for

your friends!  There's a virtual goldmine to be made with

tracing/collecting/bounty-hunting/repossessions/finding

parents of adopted children, etc., especially when you can do

it my way--the easy way.  Want to know how?  Ok. Here's one

of  my finest resources.  A one-stop shop for fast accurate

on-line information.  The company is CDB-INFOTEC.  Of all the

services I've used, they are one of the most accurate and

reasonable services I've found.  The best feature is, you can

often get the records within seconds after you log in.

        So, as you can see, the power of intelligence

gathering is right at the tip of your fingers and your

computer keypad.  So.  Now, let's take a look at what's

needed and how you too can almost immediately become your own

investigator.  This is only one of literally thousands of

databases we use, but a great start.



        Now, let's take a look at the "not so technical side"

of gaining access and what you will need to do this.



        First, you will need a computer, almost any kind will

do, and a modem.  A modem, for those of you who haven't read

a magazine or newspaper lately, is nothing more than a small

box that connects to your computer that makes it possible for

your computer to link to the telephone line and communicate

with other computers.  They are priced according to the speed

at which they will transmit data (from 300 baud to 14.4 baud)

from $25 to $200 bucks.



        Once you have the computer and modem, you will need

some kind of telecommunications software. (The brains that

make it all work in your computer). My favorite is one called

Telemate and is available as shareware on most computer

bulletin boards.  If you have trouble finding it, you can

call any local computer store or local technician and get

them to "download" (that's when you get a file from another

computer) it for you.

        If you are absolutely computer illiterate, and want

to get the program working to where you can use online

services, you should hire a local "techie" to come in and set

up what's called "batch" files that will enable you to type

single words to make the computer do what you want it to.  I

often assist my customers and other investigators to write

batch files to make computer using less difficult... I do it

on the phone and they just write them using their word

processor.  It's a lot easier than you think.  Like I said

earlier, you have to "wade in" and make it happen.  Once

you've done it a few times you'll be mad at yourself for

allowing such "information gathering power" to slide by you.



  Other On-Line Services That Can Increase Your Productivity

      and Protection by 1000% For Less Than $10 A Month!



        So far I've shown you one of the services used

primarily by detectives. Next month we'll look at how many of

the general online services like, Compuserve, Prodigy, Genie,

Delphi, etc., can be of value to you in gaining the superior

hand!  We' ll also get back on track with a few of "yours

truly" original designs. . .



        You'll discover that on-line services are your

line technology/almost anything you can imagine! From due

diligence to "spying. . ."

knowledge or confidence--want to know where to go to get the

best information on a daily/weekly/monthly basis and become

"the expert?"  Want to know if anyone else h as

"beat you to the punch. . ." already patented your invention

or idea?  Want to know who's trustworthy to help you in

development and distribution of your invention?  How about

becoming a full time information broker--at $100 or $200 an

hour?  Want to use this same service to find out who needs

your services--communicate with them--and get their business

at no advertising costs?  Want to find books that are out of

print--that you can get for change and turn into huge

profits?  Want to reach a celebrity or other famous person,

but can't find them--want to know how to find them and send

them a certified letter, telegram or fax all in one shot?

Want to find investors for your business venture--but you

want to be secure and deal with honest and straight forward

people?



        Are you getting the point?  This is all coming off

the top of my head.  I could go on for hours.  The amount of

information available on-line is so vast, it is like having a

"genie in a bottle."  This evolution is finally becoming more

and more recognized by professional people. . . But overall,

you are about to become the "majority". . . Few have the

creativity or know how to use this for profit or gain.  I

want to make you more secure, knowing that nothing will come

your way that you c an't answer. . . Trust me friend, I can

make even the most technical very simple--that was always one

of my strengths in litigation.  We'll start with A and

perhaps someday--we may reach Z.  In the meantime, I'll keep

you up to date with the developments of investigative

advancements as they occur.



        Before I close, I want to address the question many

of you have asked regarding tracing and collections.  Yes,

on-line technology is one of the easiest ways on earth to

find missing persons for those of you who want to use

computer interaction for a "quick fix." But for those of you

who don't?  Well there's. . .



           Mike Enlow's Secret to Tracing Skips and

               Collecting Cash From Deadbeats!



      You could always use this secret service (no pun

intended) known mostly by "super spies". . . It's quite a

crafty system.  It uses caller I.D.. to locate and get

service or collection action on your target.  However, it is

not to be confused with standard caller I.D.. which can

easily be defeated by pressing *67 before dialing.  It is

much better and is used primarily by "insiders."  It's Tel-

Scan and I'll tell you all about it.



     Tel-Scan works because you give debtors, skips or

anyone you're trying to locate for that matter, an 800 toll

free number to call.  What kind of message you send them to

prompt the call is your business. . .  Anyway, when the

target gets your message via mail, associate, relative, or

whatever, they call your 800 number and key in the extension

number you've provided (this will allow you to track down any

number of targets--each assigned an extension number to allow

you to identify the caller) and PRESTO--they're busted.



     The Tel-Scan system is designed to immediately capture

the number from where they are calling and save it in a voice

mailbox.  The system will also fax the target's phone number

to you if you wish.  You, then, have the opportunity to cross

reference the number in a criss-cross directory to get the

address.  I bet some of you will make a buck or two off this

one... The number to Tel-Scan is: 303-663-1703.  To check out

the system, go ahead, try to block it. . . Call 800-276-2054.

If you decide to use this system, tell Jim you read about

him in the Inside Secrets.



        Until next time, I remain,



                     Bodaciously yours,



                     Michael E. Enlow

                     Private Investigator



P. S.  I am planning on hosting a seminar in the near future.

The topics will be:  Information Brokering, Investigative

Sciences, Legal Investigations, and just plain ole

"Investigative Salesmanship". . .  If you're interested call

Jennie or Sissye and tell them you're interested in rubbing

elbows with yours truly for an event that will change your 

perspective on life.  The number is: 601-783-6037. Or send

e-mail to michael@enlow.com.



P. P. S.  Oh yeah, I've received a number of letters from you

wanting to know how to determine if a certain person has a

federal rap sheet. . . Call the Bureau of Prisons at 202-307-

3126 and you can rapidly find out if he or she has ever been

an inmate at "Camp Fed."
