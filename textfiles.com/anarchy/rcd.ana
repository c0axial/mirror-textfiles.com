 Ok, here I am again. Greets to Red, Digital Demon, Armitage, Marcus

 everyone else who feels that their existance needs to be acknowledged.

NOTICE FUCKERZ!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It has been brought to my attention that a few lamo geeks have been
confusing SANctuary with UASI (The Underground Agent Society Inc.)
This is a bunch of shit. I am the SysOp of The Global Intelligence
Center, which is the Pennsylvania SANsite. I carry all (or will as
soon as Red sends me the fuckers again! *HINT*) of the SANphiles on my
system. UASI is in no way affiliated with SANctuary. I guess a few
pholks have said that SANctuary is a subsidiary of UASI. But it aint,
so chill. UASI is presided over by me, and is aimed more toward
Phreaking and Anarchy.  Nuff said.

PREFACE
~~~~~~~
As you may have guessed, this phile is on how to make your very own RC
detonators for your favorite High Level Explosives. I figured on
writing a huge fucker that has all of my terroristic knowledge
contained within, but that would take me about 4 months, so I'll be
releasing a bit at a time. This is the first in a series on making
remotely activated, time delay, and timer detonators, so keep yer eyes
open for the ones to come.


THE SCENE
~~~~~~~~~
Ok. You know this lamer zit fuck who really gets on your nerves just by
his mere existance. The usual pranks of having Pizza Hut deliver a $50
order to his house, having the exterminators fumigate his house, and
running his fone bill through the roof have gotten boring, so you
decide to terminate this putrid pile of hippo shit.
  One fine morning he goes out to get his morning paper, and finds a
package on his front door (made to look like UPS was there). Of course
the curiousity is always the killer so he picks it up and takes it in
his house. A few seconds later *!BOOM!* his windows blow out, and his
house caves in. After the little lamer zit fuck geek pieces settle on
his front lawn, you smile and drive away.  How do we do it? Read on.

MATERIALS
~~~~~~~~~
To construct an R/C detonator, get, purchase, steal, or otherwise
aquire the following:

1 R/C vehicle *
1 Soldering Iron *
1 Long length of resin core solder *
1 Lighted SPST switch  *
1 Project Box about 4" wide x 8" long x 3" deep.  *
Lots of wire *
1 package of Alligator Clips *
1 package of 9 volt snap-on battery terminals *
2 9 volt batteries *

* = Can be obtained from Radio Shit er Shack


CONSTRUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ok now for the phun shit.  Hopefully you bought a really cheap junky
R/C car, cuz you're gonna tear it apart. (Go ahead and play with it til
you get bored.. Gawd!)
Now take out the screws in the car and remove the circuit board. note
where all wires go to and tape and label them accordingly. For this
phile we will use the Nikko Turbo Panther R/C Buggy. (simply cuz that's
the one I used and it worx). On the Turbo Panther, the antenna to the
receiver was just a wire fed through a plastic tube to make it stick
up. pull off the tube and pull the wire through the hole so that it is
coming straight off of the circuit board. Ok, now cut the wires to the
battery compartment. Usually there are two that go to positive
terminals, and two to negative. Make sure you put tape on ALL wires you
cut off of the car and label them. Now, cut the wires to the cars
motor. Label these. Cut the wires that go to the relay magnet, or servo
motor, or whatever little gadget that controls the cars steering. Now
the circuit board should be free of the car. If not, cut and label
whatever shit is still connected to it. (usually the "ON" switch).

Throw the car away, or keep it for parts for a future project. On the
detonator I built, I made it so that two bombs could be hooked to the
one detonator. You could build the bomb and the detonator together, and
thats fine, but your little project gets blown to hell too, and you
have to go buy another R/C car.

OK. The first thing to do is drill two small holes close together on
the side of your project box. Mine has two holes on each side, for the
two bombs. now drill a hole on the top for the little lighted SPST
switch. (lighted for neato terrorist effect)
Note the "ON" switch wired to the circuit board. Cut the wires off
close to the switch. wire the new lighted one on and solder it well.
Next, wire the 9 volt clip-on thingy to the wires that originally went
to the battery compartment. (if your car required 8 AA's, (12 volts)
then wire two 9 volt thingys on. Yeah I know, thats 18 volts, but shut
the fuck up and do it cuz it worx).
Now cut the little servo, or relay magnet off and solder two lengths of
long ass wire onto it. Do the same on the wires that were connected to
the cars motor. feed these wires through the two holes in the project
box that you drilled. (from the inside, duh!) Attach the alligator
clips to the other ends of these four wires (after you feed them
through the holes, DUH!). Now if you've done all of this shit right
your little mess should look something like this.

Well I tried. I guess if you stare at it long enough you'll eventually
decipher it.  Anyways, that's the basic shit. Now just connect the
lengths of wires to a solar ignitor to use as a primer for a secondary
explosive, or wire it straight to a chunk of C-4 and blow up your
favorite dept store! Turn on the nifty lighted switch, and get in your
car and drive about 2 hundred yards away. move the transmitter buttons
around till the receiver picks up the signal, detonates the bomb, and
throws people across the parking lot! I don't really give a fuck.  If
