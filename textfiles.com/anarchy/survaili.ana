				 ^OBJECTIVE^ 

	THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TUTORIAL IS REMOTE SURVEILENCE WITHOUT THE
OBJECT REALIZING THEY ARE BEING SURVEYED.  TO HELP ILLUSTARTE THIS PROJECT
WE SHALL USE SURVEILENCE OF A HOTEL AS A EXAMPLE.  THE REASON IS TO PROTECT
GOODS.	BECAUSE OF THIS IT MUST BE MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:

1.  IT CAN BE WATCHED IN REAL TIME, BUT ALSO CAPABLE OF BEING RECORDED.
2.  IT MUST BE HIDDEN SO THE CUSTOMER CAN'T SEE IT.
3.  IT MUST NOT WASTE TIME OF SECURITY OFFICER OR TAPE BY JUST WATCHING AN
EMPTY ROOM.

				^OBJECTIVE #1^

	   OBJECTIVE #1 READS "IT CAN BE WATCHED IN REAL TIME, BUT ALSO CAPABLE
OF BEING RECORDED.  WE'LL SPLIT THIS IN TWO PARTS AND NOW CONCENTRATE ON
THE FIRST ONE (BE WATCHED IN REAL TIME).  TO DO THIS IT MUST TAKE THE 
PICTURE AND TRANSMIT IT OVER THE AIR AS RUNNING A WIRE TO SAY, THE 20TH
FLOOR WOULD BE A HASSLE.  TO ALLOW THE PICTURES TO BE TRANSFERRED YOU NEED
THREE THINGS: A CAMERA, RF MODULATOR, ATTENA, AND PERHAPS A LINEAR AMPLIFIER
DEPENDING ON HOW FAR YOU WANT IT TO GO.  THE CAMERA CAN EITHER BE PURCHASED
LEGALLY WHITCH WOULD COME OUT TO ABOUT $800, OR ORDERED WITH THOSE WONDERFULL
THINGS CALLED CREDIT CARDS.  AN EVEN BETTER WAY IS TO GO TO A PARKING LOT
OR OTHER PLACE WHERE THEY USE CLOSED-CIRCUIT VIDEO TO MONITOR PEOPLE AND
SNAG 'EM.   A QUICK NOTE, IF YOU WANT TO PREVENT A CAMERA FROM SEEING
YOU BUT DONT WANT TO  PHISYCLLY DAMAGE THE SURVEILENCE DEVICE THEY CAN BE
TEMPERARILY KNOCKED OUT OF COMMISION BY FLASHING A BRIGHT LIGHT (FLASHBULB, ETC
.) AS CLOSE TO THE LENS AS POSSIBLE.  ANYWAY, I RECOMMEND SONY AND PANASCONIC 
CAMERAS IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE.  THEY MUST BE CAPABLE OF RF OUTPUT.  WHICH BRINGS US TO THE RF MODULATOR.  GREATLY SIMPLIFIED WHAT A RF MODULATOR DOES IS MODIFY 
THE SIGNAL FOR A CHANNEL.  TO GET YOUR PERSONAL RF MODULATOR GO TO ANY FINE 
ELECTRONIC STORES INCLUDING JERROLD ELECTRONICS CORP 4TH AND WALNUT STS., 
PHILADELPHIA, PA. IT SOMETIMES IS CALLED CABLE DRIVER. NET COMES ANTENNA. THE 
ANTENNA MOST COMONY USED FOR TV OUTPUT IS THE DI-POLE ANTENNA.	WHAT IT IS IS A
TALL POLE WITH NORMALLY THREE SETS OF FOUR PRONGS JUTTING OUT HORIZONTALLY.  
FOR MORE INFROMATION ON ANTENNAS (AND MUCH OF THE OTHER STUFF DISCUSED HERE) 
CHECK OUT RADIO AMATEUR'S HANDBOOK PUBLISHED BY AMERICAN RADIO RELAY LEAGUE  
NEWINGTON, CONN. 06611.  TV SIGNALS TRAVAL STRAGHT FROM THE ANTENNA AND 
THEREFORE AND BE FUCKED UP BY BUILDINGS IN THE WAY, SPECIFICALLY METAL TYPE
 ONES.	TO AVOID THIS YOU WOULD PUT THE ANTENNA AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE, IN THIS 
CASE TOP OF THE HOTEL.	OR IF THE HOTEL WAS SHORT PUT IN ATATCHED TO A BALLOON,
 ETC.  ANOTHER QUICK NOTE, IT IS THERERTOCALLY POSSIBLE TO USE SOMEONE ELSES 
ANTENNA FOR YOUR SIGNAL AND OBVIOUSLY IF IT IS A BETTER, AND BIGGER ANTENNA 
YOUR SIGNAL WILL BE BETTER AND GO FARTHER (AMAZING, HUH)!  AND NOW WE ARE 
FINNALY  TO THE LINEAR AMPLIFIER.  ALL THIS DEVICE DOES IS STRENGTHEN YOUR 
SIGNAL.  A 5-WATT AMPLIFIER WILL GO ABOUT 3 1/2 MILES.

			       ^OBJECTIVE 1.5^

    TO RECORD IT NOTHING COULD BE SIMPLER.  GO TO ANY LARGE DEPARMENT STORE,
OR ELECTRONICS SHOP AND THE WILL HAVE VCR'S (VIDEO CASSETTE RECORDERS).  THEY C
OST AROUND $600 AND ONCE YOU GET ONE YOU ATTATCH IT TO THE TV, AND OPERATE IT JUST LIKE A TAPE RECORDER (IE HIT RECORD BUTTON TO RECORD WHATEVERS ON THE 
SCREEN, ETC).

			       ^OBJECTIVE 2^   

   OBJECTIVE #2 IS TO NOT LET THE CUSTOMER KNOW THE DEVICE IS THERE.  THIS
INCLUDES BOTH VISUAL AND HEARING.  THE HEARING IS THE EASIEST, THE CAMERA
MAY MAKE A MINIMUN OF DRONING, SYMPLY "PACK IT" IN A HEAVY TOWELL, ETC.
THE THREE BEST WAYS IN ORDER OF EASIEST 1.  HIDDEN IN LIGHTS, 2.  THROUGH
AN EXTREMELY SMALL HOLE, 3. BEHIND A ONE WAY MIRROR.  FIRST OF ALL IN OPTION
1 (HIDDEN IN LIGHTS) THIS WOULD BE FLUORCENT PANEL LIGHTING WHERE IT WOULD BE
EASY TO HIDE THE LENS BEHIND THE PICE OF PLASTIC BELOW THE LIGHTS.  PLASTIC
THAT DIFFUSES LIGHT WILL WORK BEST AS THAT WAY THE CUSTOMER WILL NOT EVEN
BE ABLE TO SEE THE OUTLINE OF THE LENS (NOT THAT MOST PEOPLE STARE AT THE 
LIGHTING IN A HOTEL).  OPTION 2, AN EXTREMELY SMALL HOLE, HAS THE ADVATAGE
OF LETTING IT BE LOCATED ON THE WALL OR CEILING HOWEVER THE PICTURE QUALITY
GOES DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY.  THE WAY IT WORKS IS YOU NARROW THE LENS (ZOOM) TO
A SMALL HOLE THAT HAS A 360 DEGREE VIEW.  THESE CAN EASLY BE PURCHASED AS
"PEEP HOLES" THAT ARE INSTALLED IN MOST HOMES TO ALLOW THE RESIDENT VIEW
OUTSIDE THE DOOR "SAFELY".  THE LAST METHOD INVOLVES ONE WAY MIRRORS, AND
YOUD HAVE A CAMERA BEHIND IT.  IT SOUNDS VERY EASY, AND IM SURE ITS POSSIBLE
HOWEVER I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE YOU GET ONE WAY MIRRORS...OH WELL! 	    
   
			  ^OBJECTIVE #3
^	 
 
   THIS ONE CAN BE DONE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.  SIMPLY PUT, YOU MUST
HAVE A DEVICE CAPABLE OF TURNING ON THE CAMERA WHEN THERE IS A PERSON
OR PERSONS IN THE ROOM.  THE MOST FAIL-SAFE WAY OF DOING THIS
IS BY HEAT DETECTION (IE INFRA-RED).  THEY ARE OFTEN USED TO TURN ON
LIGHTS WHEN HEAT IS APPROACHING (IE A BURGLAR), HOWEVER SOME ALSO HAVE A LIGHT 
SENSITVE DEAL THAT TURNS ITSELF OFF WHEN DAY BEGIND (TURNING ON LIGHTS JUST 
ISNT VERY EFFECTIVE DURING THE DAY...).  TO FIX THIS PUT A DARK CLOTH OVER
THE EYE (THE LIGHT-SENSITIVE ONE).  THESE DEVICES ARE AVAIABLE AT MOST 
ELECTRONIC SHOPS.  OTHER METHODS I NCLUDE LIGHT BEAMS, PRESSURE MATS, ETC.  
HOWEVER THEY CAN BE SCREWED  UP IF MORE THEN ONE PERSON COMES IN.

				 ^NOTES
^

  MANY LARGE ELECTRONIC STORES (HEATHKIT IS ONE) HAVE CLOSED CIRCUIT TV FOR 
ABOUT $350.  IT INCLUDES A B/W TV, 50 FEET CABLE OR SO, A CAMERA,
AND SOMETIMES A INTERCOM.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU HAVE TO USE CABLE BUT
IT WILL WORK WELL IN SOME CASES.  ALSO, THERE ARE A SOME VIDEO CAMERAS THAT
WILL SEND (TV SIGNALS) TO THEIR CORRESPONDING VCR.  THE RCA VKP-900 VCR, 
ALONG WITH CKC-021 CAMERA ARE CAPABLE OF THIS (IF I GOT THE MODEL #'S RIGHT).
WELL, IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CONTACT F] SIR FRANCIS	L] DRAKE ON PLOVER-NET.
