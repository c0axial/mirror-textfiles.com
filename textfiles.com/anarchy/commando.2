        The reason we are putting this file out and not another Pranks file is
that we need more time to compile another Pranks file.  Another reason we put
out this file is that lately many teenagers have been getting into the Vietnam
experience.  So if you are into Vietnam or are just starting to get into it,
here are some common sayings used during the war.  If you are not into Vietnam
give it a try.  I (The Untouchable) have been into it since I can remember 
thanks to my dad who was in the war.  With some effort I got Elliot into it
and I think he enjoys what he's learned about it so far.  So please try to get
into it if you already haven't because it is an important part of U.S.
history.  Thanx.
