21.  Throw out the teacher and decide for yourselves what, how, why you want   

 to learn.  Spread the action to other classes and other schools, this happened 

in Paris back in 1968.



22.  Have gigantic coughing and sneezing fits in class or in assemblies.



23.  Find out your teacher's and principal's addresses and go there at night   

 and spray anti-school slogans on their walls.



24.  Rub glue, lipstick, vasiline, or shit on the doorknobs of the officies of 

 the headmasters, principals, or on theteachers toilets.



25.  Pick up some dog training liquid at a pet store (it smells like concentrat

ed piss) and if you can't figure out what to do with that then shouldn't be read

ing this.



26.  Intercept the teacher's mail.  Pass around, copy anything confidential or 

interesting.



27.  Impersonate angry parents phoning up the school. Try complaining that a na

sty teacher has been having sex with little Johnny. 



28.  Don't go to school.  Sick notes are no problem to copy.  Think of better w

ays to spend your time.



29.  Make a super stink bomb out of hydrogen-sulfide and put it in the school's

 ventalation system.  This has cleared schools for days.



30.  If your school has suspended ceilings (that is ceilings composed of rectan

gles or squares that can be pushed up) you can put dead fish or anything else ab

ove them. Or try dead fish in a disused locker and glue up the lock.



31.  When you get the staff totally neurotic and parannoyed, put out notes and 

hints that "Tuesday is the day."



32.  With a new teacher change names in roll call, so that he/she can never fig

ure out who everyone is.



33.  Get your school library a subscription to any underground/anarchist/sex or

iented newspaper and insist that they make it availible to pupils.



34.  Get school note paper and type out letters to teachers fireing or suspendi

ng them.  Soon they won't know what to believe.



35.  Do some revolutionary wall spraing.  Recipe.. Spray cans or paint and brus

h, look out, a little imagination and courage.  Write your favorite slogan on wa

lls, billboards, blackboards, floors, etc.  A stencil is nice though it limits s

ize.  Best where gloves or you will get tell-tale paint on your hands.



36.  Copy and hand out a sheet with the names and house phone numbers of teache

rs on it.  Now people can ring up anytime if punishments don't stop.  Say 3a.m. 

for instance, say you're the mafia or keep sending police, plumbers, coffins, et

c. to their house.    



37.  Get hold of a film to be shown at school, and splice in bits of your own m

aking, then return it unnoticed.  Wizard wheezes for technical wizards, like bug

ging the teachers toilets and hooking up the results to the school loudspeaker s

ystem.



38.  Clog up all drains with clay, paper, etc., then flush all toilets and turn

 on all taps.  Instant swimming pool.



39.  Stick up anonymous posters around the school.



40.  Always carry an awl (available at any hardware store) or sharpined screwdr

ivers.  Puncture teachers tires by pushing through the sidewall (it goes through

 eaisly) while pretending to tie your shoelace.  Practice at night on the tires 

of any rich car.  Do at least two tires so that the spare doesn't help.  For rea

l nasties and cops, army, and polititians, add sugar and/or sand to the gas tank

.  The claw of a hammer will remove most locked gas caps, or use your awl and ha

mmer, tap a hole in the gas tank, light and run.
