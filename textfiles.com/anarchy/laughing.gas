AMMONIUM NITRATE AND LAUGHING GAS



Some Militants who don't have much 

dynamite use ammonium nitrate.  This

can be bought by anyone at $3.75 for

an 80 pound bag (old price).  It is a

fertilizer.  Ammonium Nitrate explodes

at rates up to 14,000 feet per second.

It is roughly compared to dynamite

having 60% nitro.

The fertilizer grade Militants use is

mized with motor oil at the ratio of 

one pint of oil to 8.5 pounds of 

Ammonium nitrate.  This has to be 

detonated with a stick of gelatin

dynamite.

Purified ammonium nitrate can be 

detonated with a number 6 dynamite cap.

The pure stuff can be bought at 

chamical supply houses or the fertilizergrade can be purified with distilled

wood alcohol.

Put several pounds of fertilizer grade

ammonium nitrate in a pan.  Pour in

enough wood alcohol (methanol) to cover

the fertilizer.  Then stir it until a 

lot has dissolved.  Next, let it set a

few minutes to allow the impurities to

settle to the bottom along with the

undissolved ammonium nitrate.

Another pan is set on some pieces of

dry ice for the next step.  The 

ammonium nitrate is poured into the cold pan.  This is done carefully so as to

leave the inpurities and undissolved

ammonium nitrate behind.

The dry ice causes the purified 

ammonium nitrate to precipitate out of

the solution in crystals.  When no more

crystals are formed they are removed

from the alcohol.

The alcohol is then poured back into

the other pan and stirred to dissolve

and ammonium nitrate left undssolved. 

After setting a few minutes the solutionis again poured off the dregs and the 

dregs are thrown away.  When the last 

batch of crystals is removed, the

alcohol can be stored and reused.

In order for pure ammonium nitrate to

be detonated by a dynamite cap, it must

be very dry.  Spread it out under a 

heat lamp or in the sun.  When 

completely dry store in tightly closes

plastic bags.



As a special treat for the party 

animals in the audience and since 

ammonium nitrate has bene on your

minds for a few minutes, you might as

well learn how to make laughing gas

from ammonium nitrate.

Laughing gas was one of the earliest

anaesthetics.  After a little while of

inhaling the gas the patient became so

happy he couldn't keep from laughing.

Finally he would drift off into a 

pleasant sleep.

Some do-it-yourselfers have died while

taking laughing gas.  This is because 

they had generated it through plastic 

bags while their heads were inside.

They simply suffocated, but to too

wasted to even realize that.

The trick is to have a plastic clothes

bag in which you generate a lot of the

gas.  Then you stop generating the gas

and holda small opening of the bag

under your nose, getting plenty of

oxygen in the meantime.  Then whee!!

To make it you start with pure

ammonium nitrate from a chemical supply

store, or homemade purified stuff. 

First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium

nitrate in some water.  Then you 

evaporate the water over the stove,

while stirring, until you have a heavy

brine.  When nearly all the moisture

is out it should solidify instantly

when a drop is put on an ice cold metal

plate. When ready, dump it all out on a

very cold surface and store it in a

bottle.

A spoonful is put into a flask with a

one hole stopper, with a tube leading

into a big plastic bag.  The flask is

heated with an alcohol lamp.

When the temperature in the flask

reaches 480F the gas will generate.  If

white fumes appear the heat should be

lowered as the stuff explodes at 600F.

When the bag is filled, stop the action

and get ready to turn on.
