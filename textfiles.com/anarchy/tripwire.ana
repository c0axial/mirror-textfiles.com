  Well first of all I reccommend that you read the file on my board about
landmines...  If you can't then here is the conecpt.  You can use an
m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other type of elxplose that will light with a
fuse.  Now the way this works is if you have a 9volt batery, from a radio
ctlred car or what ever and get either a solor igniter (preferably) or some
steel wool you can create a remote ignition system.  What you do it set up a
schematic like this.

	------------------>+ batery
 steel ||		 ->- batery
 wool  ||		 /
  :==:---  <--fuse	 \
       ||		 /
       ---- spst switch--\

  So when the switch is on the currnet will flow through the steel wool or
igniter and heat up causing the fuse to light.

  Note:  For use with steel wool try it first and get a really thin peice of
wire and pump the current through it to make sure it will heat up to light the
explosive.

**********************************
  Now the thing to do is plant your explosive whereever you want it to be but
bury it and cover the wires obviously...  Now take a this wire fishing line is
good about 20 lb.  test and tie one end of the wire to a secure object.  Have
your switch secured to seomthing to and make a loop on the other end on the
line.  Put the loop around the switch such that when pulled it will pull the
switch and set off the explosive.  Remeber it may take a few seconds to ignite
the explosive...  The thing to do is to experiment with this and find your best
method...
