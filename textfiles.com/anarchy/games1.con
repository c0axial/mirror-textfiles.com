  EXCULISIVELY FOR APPLE TREK SYSTEMS
---------------------------------------
  REPRINTED FROM VARIOUS TAP ISSUES.

PAC-MAN
    THIS  TRICK   ISN'T  EXACTLY  NEW,  BUT IT'S  INTERESTING  
NONE   THE  LESS.  ON SOME  MIDWAY  VIDEO  GAMES,   INCLUDING 
PAC-MAN,  A  SMALL  FLAW  IN  THE  COIN TOTALIZER ALLOWS FREE 
GAMES.  HOW? TAKE A  SMALL BUT  WEIGHTY OBJECT  SUCX AS A "D" 
SIZE  BATTERY   OR  POAKET  KNIFE,   AND GIVE  THE MACHINE  A 
SHARP  RAP BETWEEN THE COIN DEPOSIT AND COIN RETURN SLOTS.
  IF   YOU   HAVE  DONE  IT  CORRECTLY, YOU WILL GET ONE FREE  
CREDIT.  DO IT  MORE, AND   GET  MORE.  THERE'S   NO  LAW  OF 
DIMINISHING   RETURNS    HERE!   HOWEVER, SOME  MACHINES HAVE 
BEEN   FITTED  WITH A "TILT" SWITCH IN THAT AREA, SO, YA  WIN 
SOME, YA LOSE SOME.

STRINGING:

     A    METHOD   WHICH  WORKS  ON  MANY MACHINES IS  CALLED  
STRINGING.   IT   IS  ONE   OF   THE   MOST   SIMPLE   THINGS 
IMAGINABLE.  JUST TAKE  A QUARTER (OR  A TOKEN,  IF YOU  HAVE 
A   PLACE  LIKE  THAT AROUND.  MACHINES  WHICH  TAKE   TOKENS 
HAVE LOWER TOLERANCES AND ARE EASIER TO FOOL) AND EITHER TAPE  
OR  GLUE  A   PIECE  OF  THREAD (OR DENTAL FLOSS, WHICH WORKS 
BETTER) ABOUT 2 FEET LONG TO IT.

     GOT  THAT?  NOW, GO TO YOU FAVORITE CROWDED  ARCADE  AND 
PUT   THE   QUAD  IN. BUT NOT  ALL  THE WAY.  JUST  LOWER  IT 
DOWN  SLOWLY UNTIL YOU HEAR (OR FEEL) IT HIT  THE   TOTALIZER  
MECHANISM.   THEN JIGGLE  IT UP  AND DOWN.  EACH TIME YOU HIT 
THE  TRIGGER INSIDE,  YOU'LL GET  A CREDIT!

NOW  IT'S TIME FOR  SOME NUMBERS. THERE IS A COMPUTER LOCATED 
AT   800-521-2255. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS SINCE IT WILL NO 
ACCEPT 300 BAUD.

    IF  IT IS SAFE  TO BOX IN YOUR  AREA HERE  IS  THE NUMBER  
TO   THE  PRINCETON  UNIVERSITY   IBM   3033.   609-452-3854. 
AFTER     CONNECTING   YOU   WILL   GET   THE  VM/370  ONLINE 
MESSAGE.  HIT RETURN  AND THE  SYSTEM WILL  SEND A  "1!". NOW 
TRY DIFFERENT IDS.  YOUR  BEST BET  IS  THE Q9XXX  (XXX=000TO  
199) SERIES.  IF YOU GET NOT IN CP  DIRECTORY IT MEANS  TXAT
THERE   IS  NOT AN  ACCOUNT UNDER THAT ID PRESENTLY.       IF       
YOU  GET "PASSWORD:XXXXXXXX THEN ALWAYS TRY "NULLPASS" FIRST.  
AFTER FOUR  ATTEMPTS THE  SYSTEM  WILL DUMP  YOU. IF  YOU DO
GET  AN  ACCOUNT  TYPE  "MONEY"  TO SEE  HOW MUCH  DOUGH  THE 
ACCT.   HAS.   THEN  TYPE  "GAMES" TO ACCESS  THE GAMES DISK.  
THE OPERATING  SYSTEM IS  CMS BY  IBM. MANY OF THEIR  SYSTEMS 
USE IT.





       THERE  IS  A  GM  WATTS  EXTENDER  USING  T-TONE    AT  
800-521-1805.   THE  ACCESS NUMBER CAN BE FROM 1 TO 23 DIGITS  
LON.  AFTER   ENTERING   YOUR  NUMBER   HIT   #  TO TELL  THE  
MACHINE    YOU    ARE    FINISHED.   THERE   IS   A  PBX   AT  
800-521-1675.  THE  ACCESS  CODE  IS 3000.  THEN YOU CAN  HIT 
7,8,  OR  9. AFTER  THAT I  DON'T KNOW. THERE IS  ALSO  A PBX  
AT  800-521-2625 AND; THE ACCESS CODE IS 3 DIGITS LONG.
