    <P>
    Many people wrote in after hearing about my hard drive crash. They offered
    some cash, some advice, and a lot of support. I really appreciate that; I
    hear from folks telling me about how much they like the site, but not often
    do I hear from people saying how much they'd miss it if it were gone or
    missing things.
    <P>
    After careful thought, I'm not going to recover the disk anytime soon. It's
    a lot of money, and even though I could run a fund drive and make a lot of
    it, based on the letters, it would be silly money to spend. Maybe I would have
    a fund drive to add a new server to textfiles.com (so I could add searches,
    among other things) but making people pay for the same procedure with the
    same place that firms use to recover accounting data is over the top.
    <P>
    With VERY little exception, everything in that inbox was stored somewhere
    else. I even have a copy of the inbox, one year previous to when I had it.
    I'll use that, and I might miss a few hundred files, but I'm not that 
    concerned; everything will show up again, I promise. It took me a while
    to determine that, but I do believe it's the case.
    <P>
    New sections and files are still showing up on textfiles.com, and I've been
    making some major inroads on the 
    <A HREF="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com">documentary</A> as well. Life is
    great. Thanks for making it so.
