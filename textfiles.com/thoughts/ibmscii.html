<B>A QUICK EXPLANATION OF IBM ASCII</B>

<P>
Technically, ASCII only covers the first 128 characters of what most
people refer to as the "ASCII Character Set". This first set contains
pretty much all the characters we associate with ASCII: the alphabet
(upper and lowercase), punctuation marks like !;., and the other 
standard characters used in modern communication, such as @#$%^&.
<P>
However, the nature of 8-bit computing is that there were 128 extra
spaces in which to put other kinds of characters. (If you're new to
this whole idea of thinking, then you should know that to see 128 
characters requires 7 bits, and 256 characters requires 8 bits. Some
of you might recall the old days of setting your modem "7 or 8" bits,
like 7-E-1 or 8-N-1. Now you know why.)
<P>
The plan of what to do with these extra characters fell upon each
individual computer company; some simply re-used the first 128 
characters, while others added special characters not covered in the
first set, such as letters with accents or umlats for languages like
french or swedish. But a few, like IBM and Atari, used this extra
space for characters that, if you squinted, could be used for 
graphics.
<P>
Now, obviously, you're not going to get the same kind of graphics
that you expect these days, by using all sorts of odd frozen
characters in a handful of letters. However, in the case of IBM
character sets (now called OEM/IBM), there rose an interesting
subset of users who gained a real artistry with the font, able to
make stunning artwork and lettering by using hard-won techniques
for arranging the upper 128 characters.

<B>AN EXAMPLE</B>
<P>
Here is the marked difference between seeing these ASCII files on
a non-IBM terminal and an IBM terminal:

The feeling can be like opening a treasure chest into a whole other
world. The feeling can also be like scaling a peak of making this stuff
viewable, and then seeing the next huge peak of trying to decipher what
the thing is saying, even <I>WITH</I> the character set aimed the
right way. Some of these files (especially in the 
<A HREF="http://textfiles.com/tags">tags</A> section) approach the level of intense
Celtic art in how much information and arrangement they try to shove
into an 80x25 screen.  However, for me, this feeling is worth it.
<P>
In my own personal experience, I have been able to play with the "fixed"
character set in Netscape and set it to a font that has these characters.
I also use the "telnet" program and set the Font to "OEM/IBM" and gotten
the same response. As I don't tend to use other methods, you might have
to root around to make these images come alive for you.
<P>
As for other customized character sets, I don't know enough about the
other sets to give you accurate information on them, but I can imagine
the situation is very similar. Ah, standards!
<P>
<B>SOME OTHER RELATED THOUGHTS ON CHARACTER SETS</B>
<P>
Just some other related ideas to this subject, so that I know it's covered
somewhere on the site.
<P>
When used in Conjunction with ANSI, these IBM Graphics characters take
on a whole other life in themselves. With ANSI codes mixed in, you can
see the characters in color, doing animation, and theoretically, make
sounds or music, although this is actually rather rare. The very absolute
best site to explain the wonders of ANSI and ASCII art in detail, as well
as show examples that can be seen on any browser, is 
<A HREF="http://www.acheron.org/">ACHERON.ORG</A>, who have spent years
building up cool programs that convert ANSI to graphics, and who keep up
to the very latest news about ANSI and ASCII art (as well as RIP graphics,
which I missed entirely). I can't reccomend this site enough if you want
to experience that world.
<P>
Even if the upper 128 aren't used to make the text "graphics", there can
still be a significant difference in how an IBM displays the lower 128
compared to, say, Macs or UNIX boxes. One easy immediate fix is to use
the "fixed" character set, whatever one you have, to view the files. In
the case of textfiles.com, it is very likely your browser will do this
for you automatically. But it might not. 
<P>
Finally, while a lot of these ASCII graphics creations are stunning and
glorious, a good percentage do in fact suck. So if you're looking at
a file for a <I>very</I> long time, trying to see where the incredible
image is buried within... well, there might not be one. Caveat Emptor.
