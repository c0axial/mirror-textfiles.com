<B>THE HATERS, THE HATERS</B>
<P>
This essay is not much about textfiles at all, though perhaps it's entirely
about textfiles.
<P>
My work on this site stems from several major drives: The desire to save
a history I'm afraid is disappearing, the need to explain this history to
folks who did not live through or personally experience the events surrounding
this history, and, in some small way, to personally leave a mark upon this world. 
<P>
This is now my third year working on the project, and I have a lot to show for
it: many thousands of textfiles saved and categorized, entire series of BBS-related
text restored or sorted, and a huge amount of side projects that have made themselves
a part of the whole, such as the universal BBS list and the BBS Documentary.
This should be a happy time for me, and I should feel like I've really done something.
<P>
Buy my symphony of good fortune has a sour note in it; a steady blaring, blatting
noise aimed at me that sometimes can drown out all the good even 
though it itself is of the weakest strength. If you care what others think (and I
do), then if someone is less than pleased with your work, you want to know what you
can do to fix it. You want to inquire further to understand their discontent and
perhaps bring in their ideas to make your work on your projects better.
<P>
Some of these folks turn out to be the sort of Internet user who thinks that
anyone with a half-decently designed website must naturally maintain that website
full-time, and that any flaws in the HTML, project downloads, or images must
be their top priority in life. They blurt out some sort of demand from you,
and get angry and demanding if you do not respond immediately. We call that
sort of person "Spoiled", but at least they're addressing an improveable aspect
of your site, and when time, bandwidth and money permits, the fix can be applied.
<P>
But what if the person has no such suggestions? What if the message they bring
is that you are worthless, misguided, in some way ugly, or suffering from a core
delusion? What if you pursue them for an opinion and the only response you get
is a deep, personal insult each time? 
<P>
Bear with me a moment as I correlate my experience with a somewhat related but more
controversial subculture: The emulation scene.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#00DD00">
Not that this was entirely hard to accomplish, but I was there at the "beginning" of
the timeline for emulation. You could play the historical game and say that emulation 
has existed in various forms from before the 1970's to make certain chips function, but
I would mark things as beginning from the IBM PC Emulator "SoftPC" for the Macintosh
by Insignia Solutions in 1988 (they also released an IBM PC emulator for Sun Workstations
that same year). One or two other such programs were available as the years went on 
that allowed one personal computer to run the programs of another (DOS programs on a
Commodore Amiga, for example), and this was all fine and good, but mostly a convenience
and the province of commerical software firms.
<P>
In 1995, a Williams Electronics emulator appeared for the Sony Playstation, called 
"Arcade's Greatest Hits". This proved a very important thing: That it was possible to
emulate arcade games on present-day machines. 
<P>
To emulate an arcade game, you need to have a copy of the game's ROM chips (ROMs), which
contain the actual program that the machine is running on whatever bizzare architecture
comprises the "computer" for that game. To get a copy of a ROM, you need to physically
yank the chips out of a working game and read them using a ROM reader, to a computer file
which you can then download through the Internet or from friends via a disk or what have
you. Once you have this file, you can burn it onto a "Write Once, Read Many" sort of chip
and install this repaired chip into your machine.
This is time consuming and bothersome, but as it turns out, there was for many years
an active group of folks who collected physical arcade games and would provide each other
copies of the ROM images so if a machine were damaged in some fashion, new ROMs could be
burned and the machine could function again. No harm, no foul; everyone had a physical
machine and they were just helping each other to repair these wonderful toys. 
<P>
All this changed in the Spring of 1996 with the release of the first widely-available 
arcade game emulator, Sparcade, created by Dave Spicer. This program allowed an Intel
Box to run perfect quality arcade games, functioning just as one remembered them, because
it used these somewhat-available ROM images to program themselves. It was like an explosion
shot across the gaming world; if you grew up on these games, Mr. Spicer and friends had
dropped into your lap your entire childhood in perfect 8-bit color and vector graphics.
The sound was there, the gameplay was there (and by this time, gameplay was precious stuff
indeed) and it was FREE. The only thing was, he only emulated a handful of the thousands
of games that had been produced in the last 20 years.... And the race to emulate 
everything was on.
<FONT FACE="Courier New" COLOR="#00FF00">
<P>
Fast forward to today, when emulators of all sorts are everywhere and nearly every
platform, arcade, home system, and even 1970's-era hand-held LED games are emulated
or "simulated" (a program perfectly imitates the logic of a game that has no CPU). You 
now have a situation with three strata of people in the sub-culture: A small
handful of emulator programers, a somewhat larger base of support and media-related
folks (running websites dedicated to the emulators and contributing supporting artwork
or sounds) and, finally, hundreds of thousands of people collecting both the emulators
and the ROMs necessary to play the old games.
<P>
Two of these groups produce what could be considered content. The emulator programmers
are deep into development of the fastest and most versatile emulators they can, and the
process is often a tedious reverse-engineering of hardware that often lacks documentation.
They are like solid gold, comparatively, as there are only a couple dozen of them around
at any given time (although some go out of their way to write tutorials of their work to
encourage others to join). The media-related folks go through the effort of trying to
both report on advances in emulation (and for a long time there was near-exponential work
being done) and to collect screenshots, reviews, and sounds from the resultant emulated
games.
<P>
As one of the hundreds of thousands of others (not counting the extremely short time
I helped with the "Stella" Atari 2600 Emulator), I would spend my time browsing different
sites, finding out what new games and machines had been emulated, and reading up on
different interviews and news about what people were accomplishing. I thought it all
very neat, and an interesting way to bring history back.
<P>
But within a short time, things got ugly for the content creators.
<P>
You see, ROMs were no longer backups of actual physical machines that people owned; they
were now playable software that only needed a readily-available program to be available,
free, on a home computer. What were previously archives of backup images were now 
potential dens of software piracy. These sites dried up very quickly, now being overloaded
with download requests where previously there had been none. This was a bit of a blow,
but things adjusted and ROMs are still available to shifting degrees, although nearly
anyone associated with emulation in any context is asked constantly to supply ROMs for 
emulators they code and review. This is evident in the many, many "Please do not ask for
ROMs" admonitions that appear before any e-mail address.
<P>
But this "gimmie the ROMs" issue is just the surface of a deep, deep problem that 
until recently I considered a bit of a myth: <I>Some emulator authors claimed to have 
been forced out from working on their projects due to a continuing pattern of abuse 
and harassment! From the users of their programs! </I> I would watch this website
or that project talk about shutting down because they couldn't take the threats
anymore, or the personal attacks, or the hacking attempts on their servers. This made no 
logical sense to me; how could someone try to damage, destroy or harass 
someone creating interesting things for free?
<P>
In fact, for a while I didn't actually believe it. I watched as people updating their
project logs left messages like "I'm sick of all the backbiting, the bullshit, the 
idiots ruining it for me, and I am ceasing work." and I would naturally think the
person had found other things to do and was just getting out with a cheap excuse. 
If you can't take the heat in your e-mail, get out of the website, and all that. 
I figured if someone could show the intelligence to emulate arcade games and home 
entertainment systems, which I personally considered a sort of magic, then there was 
no reason they couldn't manage to ignore or not be bothered by the occasional 
less-than-positive e-mail. 
<P>
That is, until I started getting them.
<P>
I see it more and more; there is a small but vocal backlash against aspects of my
sites that means that I am recieving a rising amount of hate mail to my mailbox. Mail
that degrades me, calls me names, insults my purpose, dismisses my enthusiasm. 
Written by people that obviously have a grip on the construction of language but 
see my amount of success at my endeavors and let loose with all the hate they have
inside. In other words, I am seeing why people would turn and drop the whole mess,
focusing on pursuits no longer a few browser clicks away. I can see why they would
change their e-mail addresses to something unrelated, abandoning their old 
embattled addresses like a sinking ship. 
<P>
This isn't to say that I am giving up; far from it. Textfiles.com is something like
the fourth or fifth major "project" I've been a part of, and it's the first that's
so big and so encompassing that it has a long way to go to lose my fascination. 
But I have thought about how angry these attacks have made me and how for flickering 
seconds I wanted to walk away, and I want to warn others who might get this pressure.
<P>
If you put your energy and tears into something you firmly believe in, something 
that opens for public consumption, focus on the people who are grateful, who write
you and tell you what your project means to them. Even if it's a few words, those 
words were written by someone who thought you should know about them, and that
means something. Focus on these lights; and when the darkness comes from the one
or two energetic folks who think you owe them something, that you were endentured
to them by default the moment they downloaded you work, that a flaw in the program
that they see is automatically a flaw in you, it won't have the same effect.
<P>
Rap calls them "The Haters", the folks who, lacking much talent or drive of their 
own, attack others who've risen above and accomplished something. They do nothing 
but bring each other down, say that it's all useless or that you have no talent or 
your dreams are unobtainable and you should just give up. They preach death; death 
of creativity, death of goals, and want to just rain down failure on you, until 
you too are as drowned as they.
<P>
You never hear of the haters in history because by the very nature of what they
do, they do not persist; they simply slip into the oblivion they seem to crave.
<P>
The solution to this onslaught of hate, failure and despair is not to jump into it 
yourself, guns blazing and flames flying, but instead do what you do best; keep
building what it is you build or continue being a part of whatever projects you
are assisting, and direct all your anger into a positive, or at least creative
manner.
<P>
Which is what I've just done.
