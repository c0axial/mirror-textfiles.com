 <B>THERE'S ANARCHY AND THEN THERE'S ANARCHY</B>
 <P>
 I recieved a piece of e-mail from a textfiles.com user going by the nom de plume
 of "Captain Anarchy", asking me to help stop the common misperception of the word
 "Anarchy" in the BBS and Internet worlds.  I initially balked at the idea, but as
 time goes on, I do suppose there's room for casual observers to get the wrong idea,
 so let's talk about it.
 <P>
 Textfiles.com has an "Anarchy" section, wherein there are a very large range of 
 files dealing with destruction, 
 <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/anarchy/MISCHIEF/doa8.txt">mischief</A>, 
 mayhem, and general troublemaking. In
 some cases, the writers simply give you very large lists of 
 <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/anarchy/MISCHIEF/nitephun.txt">horrible things to
 do to the neighborhood around you</A>, while others go as far as listing ingredients
 for incendiaries they wish you to build (and which any reasonable person would
 never do). Throughout this section, the writers will often refer to themselves 
 as "Anarchists" and what they're practicing as "Anarchy". 
 <P>
 In his book "The Hacker Crackdown", author Bruce Sterling touches on the heavy
 preponderance of these destructive textfiles and is at a loss to explain them
 beyond an interest by Hackers in "Forbidden Knowledge", and leaves it with a pretty
 clever twist about this desire to trade information representing a shift
 in society, and so on.
 <P>
 Personally, I believe it to be an expression of power. If you read into them,
 these files represent <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/humor/atombomb.hum">huge
 acts of force</A> that the typical young teenager might
 not personally be able to experience, but through the typical ups and downs
 of these painful years, might want to. Or at least know they could if they 
 really wanted to. Handling the pressures of teenage years are that much easier
 if you think you know more than you're supposed to. 
 <P>
 As I've mentioned in a speech I gave at DEFCON in 1998, textfiles can trace
 their existence back to Abbie Hoffman and the 
 <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/phreak/yipl.phk">Youth International Party
 Line</A>,
 which became the 
 <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/phreak/tap.txt">Technological Assistance
 Party (TAP)</A> and which gave way to
 2600 Magazine in the early 1980s. Abbie Hoffman's "Steal This Book" reads with
 all the humor, prodding, profanity and clear-eyed instructions of the best
 of the later BBS-era textfiles. Abbie, however, was one of the most celebrated
 of the protesting, government-shaking youths of the time, and his book goes
 far beyond mere instructions to a sort of manifesto of how to bring about the
 destruction of this oppressive state atmosphere he saw crushing the country.
 <P>
 Somehow, in the move from the revolutionary thoughts of the 1960's through to
 the technology explosion of the 1980's, these pure ingredient lists of wanton
 destruction and danger got linked and wrapped up with the idea of protest and
 fighting against the 
 <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/politics/bookban.txt">oppressive all-powerful
 state</A>, and someone decided to
 refer to them as "Anarchy" files. 
 <P>
 I won't pretend to be an expert, or even a dabbling authority on the concept of
 Anarchy as a political system. As I understand it from my days of working as an
 artist for the Zine known as "Factsheet Five", Anarchy as a political system is
 an attempt to keep out a vast, overseeing government, and instead focus on the
 cooperation of smaller collectives towards an ideal society. Some anarchists wish
 for the abolition of all government, replacing it with a shared authority by
 these smaller collectives, while others have tried to bring Anarchist ideas and
 approaches to the current systems of government.
 <P>
 The point is, the concept of "Anarchy" as portrayed in these files is not in
 any way related to these political movements, which exist on their own merits.
 The dictionary definition of Anarchy, which is "An Absence of Government", may
 or may not be an ideal situation, but it's honestly not a part of the tone and
 ideas of the writers of these textfiles. If you feel like taking a real logical
 stretch, you might be able to argue that the files advocate the destruction of
 the current order to leave a vacuum of power. Then, this vacuum of power could
 be filled with a more radical/preferable system of governing or self-governing.
 How this could possibly be achieved by 
<A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/anarchy/MISCHIEF/mcdonld.ana">screwing with the
 ketchup packets of a McDonalds</A>, of course, is beyond me.
 <P>
 I often recieve correpondence from 
 <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/humor/COMPUTER/warbitch.hum">people who wrote
 these files</A>. More often than
 not, these writers are actually rather embarassed at their writings and ask me
 if it's entirely necessary for them to be still online. I don't believe in 
 burying the past, but I do share their concern about two groups taking these
 files seriously: Young minds who think that this sort of explosives construction
 actually happened years ago and they just missed the fun, and groups of 
 self-righteous "Universal Parents" who might point to these collections of files
 as serious attempts to foment revolution or scar the minds of the young. Both
 of these groups are entirely misguided.
 <P>
 It might need to be said, if you've previously thought otherwise, that the
 1980's were not a time of wanton, spectacular explosions raining down from
 suburban neighborhoods all across the country. While no doubt people blew
 things up, it wasn't the natural order of things and people were no doubt
 arrested or fined heavily for doing so. No great social change took place as
 a result of criminal mischief. There have been some issues with the massive
 amounts of corporate mergers, however. We're still feeling the effects of 
 that. Otherwise, pretty smooth sailing.
 <P>
 As for the idea that this collection exists in some way to poison the minds
 of youth, well, these files were WRITTEN by youth. Even a cursory view of the
 files reveal all the badly-written phrases, poor spelling, and 
 <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/anarchy/MISCHIEF/phunatdi.ana">near-myopic
 perspective</A> of teenage authors going for shock value or to wave the biggest
 stick in the playground. These are hardly the tools used by predators
 to ensnare children; much preferable ones are the uniforms of authority or
 the latest editions of school textbooks. 
 <P>
 If the idea of learning more about Anarchy as a system of government interests
 you, then simply use a search engine to find pages entitled 
"<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/">ANARCHY FAQ</A>" or
 "ANARCHY SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT" and see what pops back at you. It probably 
 won't mention 
 <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/anarchy/MISCHIEF/projects.txt">smashing mailboxes</A>
 anywhere in it.
