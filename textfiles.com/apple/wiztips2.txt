             WIZARDRY TIPS II

****************************************


  THE MYRIAD USES OF MADI AND MALOR
  ---------------------------------

EITHER OF THESE SPELLS BENEFIT FROM A
BUG IN WIZARDRY, NAMELY IT'S TOTAL
DEPENDANCY ON DISK ACCESS. HAVEN'T OUR
FAVORITE INCS (GREENBERG INC. AND
WOODHEAD INC.) EVER HEARD OF VARIABLES?
IN ANY CASE, IN WIZARDRY, NOTHING EVER
HAPPENS UNLESS IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO
THE DISK. THUS, FATE CAN BE THWARTED BY
A TIMELY SPELL. NOTHING IS WRITTEN TO
THE DISK 'TILL THE END OF THE COMBAT
ROUND, THUS, A MADI DURING THE SAME
ROUND A CHARACTER DIES WILL BRING HIM
BACK! THIS BUG ALSO MAKES MALORS TRICKY
IF YOU DO A MALOR IN COMBAT, ANYTHING
THAT HAPPENED THAT ROUND IS TOTALLY
CANCELLED. AS LONG AS THE SPELL GETS
OFF, YOU WILL REAPPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THE
EXACT CONDITION THAT YOU WERE IN AT THE
END OF THE PREVIOUS ROUND OF COMBAY.
UNFORTUNATELY, ANY GOOD THINGS DONE
THAT ROUND ARE ALSO CANCELLED, AND IF
THE MAGE DIES...SO DOES HIS SPELL...
ALSO, NO TREASURE OR EXPERIENCE IS
GAINED FROM THAT ENCOUNTER.

THESE TWO THINGS CAN BE USED TOGETHER.
IF A MAGE IS DOWN TO SAY... 2 OR 3 HIT
POINTS, AND NO-ONE ELSE HAS MALOR...
A PRIEST CANM CAST A MADI ON HIM, AND
THAT WILL ASSURE HIS LIVING LONG ENOUGH
FOR THE SPELL TO GO OFF.

        DISBAND EXPLAINED
        -----------------

MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ABOUT THE
DISBAND OPTION OF THE NEW SCENARIO,
WHICH WAS, THROUGH AN OVERSIGHT, LEFT
OUT OF THE MANUAL. WELL, OK, HERE'S
THE DATA ON THAT... WHAT? YOU DON'T
-HAVE- THE NEW VERSION OF THE PROVING
GROUNDS...GRIN AND BEAR IT!

THE DISBAND OPTION ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE
THE PARTY APART, DISASSEMBLE THEM INTO
THEIR SEPARATE COMPONENTS...STRANGELY
ENOUGH, THEY JUST SEEM TO GO TO SLEEP
ON THE DUNGEON FLOOR, AND YOU MUST SEND
OUT A PARTY TO GET THEM, AS IF THEY
WERE DEAD BODIES. THIS CAN, HOWEVER,
HAVE MANY OTHER USES...


         THE OTHER USES
         --------------

TO GIVE THE WERDNA EXPERIENCE (ABOUT
12 LEVELS) TO FIRST LEVEL CHARACTERS,
TRY THE FOLLOWING:
1) KILL WERDNA W/ STRONG CHARACTERS
2) GO TO THE DUNGEON EXIT AND DISBAND
3) BRING A WEAK PARTY OF FIVE DOWN,
PICK UP THE CHARACTER WITH THE AMULET,
AND BRING HIM OUT, GETTING THE NEW
PARTY THE EXPERIENCE.
** GO GET THE OTHER GUYS LATER **

OR...

            A VARIATION
            -----------

THIS TYPE OF THING CAN ALSO BE USED TO
GET YOUR CHARACTERS MULTIPLE AMULET
EXPERIENCE FROM ONE EXPEDITION. HERE'S
HOW:

1) TAKE YOUR PARTY DOWN AND KILL WERDNA
2) GO JUST OUTDIDE THE ROOM (WHERE IT
SAYS "THE LAIR OF THE EVIL WIZARD"...
3) GO TO CAMP, AND DO A MALOR, THEN
JUST TYPE <RETURN> - YOU'LL GET "YOU
BOUNCED BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE" - DON'T
WORRY, YOU'RE GOING NOWHERE IN THE
FIRST PLACE!
   THIS WILL RESET THE LEVEL...
4) GO KILL WERDNA AGAIN, AND REPEAT
THE PROCESS AS LONG AS YOU ARE
CONFIDENT THAT YOU CAN KILL WERDNA.
5) USE A COMBAT MALOR TO GET TO TH3
FIRST LEVEL.
6) TRADE ONE AMULET TO EACH PERSON
7) DISBAND
8) TAKE IN FIVE PEOPLE, PICK UP ONE
PERSON WITH AN AMULET, AND LEAVE,
GAINING THE EXP FOR THAT PERSON AND
FIVE LUCKY OTHERS (THESE OTHERS CAN BE
THE SAME ONES EACH TIME!)
9) GO BACK AND DO IT AGAIN!


HERE COMES PROBABLY THE MOST NASTY,
DEVIOUS, AND FUN CHEATING METHOD.
REMEMBER...<SPACE>  IS STILL APPLICABLE


           **************
           ** CLONING! **
           **************



BY THIS METHOD, YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR
WEALTH IN GEOMETRIC PROGRESSION, AS
WELL AS DUPLICATING MAGIC ITEMS IN
THOSE SAME NUMBERS!!!!

IF YOU HAVE NO COPY PROGRAMS, TOUGH
LUCK!

HERE 'TIS:
1) COPY YOUR SCENARIO DISK USING
ANY COPY PROGRAM. IT WON'T BE USABLE
AS A SCENARIO, BUT 'TWILL HAVE ENOUGH
DATA FOR OUR PURPOSES.

TO COPY THE DISK, JUST COPY TRACKS 0-22
NO NIBBLE COUNTING OR ANYTHING IS
NECESSARY- WE JUST NEED THE PLAIN DATA.


2) CHANGE THE CHARACTER NAMES ON THE
COPY- IT WILL MAKE ALL KINDS OF
TERRIBLE NOISES, BUT IT WILL WORK

3) TRANSFER THE RENAMED CHARACTERS
TO YOUR DISK, WHERE THEY WILL BECOME
GOOD, NORMAL CHARACTERS!

4) NOW YOU CAN TRADE THINGS OR WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO. WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED,
DO IT AGAIN, AND YOU'LL GET A COPY OF
THE DISK, WHICH NOW HAS DOUBLE THE
AMOUNT OF STUFF ON IT. ALSO, THE
CHARACTERS YOU TRANSFER WILL BE EXACT
DUPLICATES OF THE ORIGINAL- CHOOSE YOUR
THREE BEST CHARACTERS, DOUBLE THEM, AND
YOU'LL HAVE A PARTY FULL OF YOUR BEST
CHARACTERS..

IT'S ALSO NICE TO HAVE THIS BACKUP
AROUND IF YOUR ORIGINAL CRASHES-
WHEN THEY REPLACE THE DISK, YOU CAN
STILL HAVE YOUR CHARACTERS.

-----------------------------------

         YET MORE MAGIC!
         ---------------

SHIRUKIN (WE DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT
SPELLING..)  -  (?WEAPON) - THIS SUCKER
IS A NINJA THROWING STAR!!

A CRITICAL HIT!
GROND KILLS ONE!
VERY GOOD IF YOU HAVE A NINJA!

WORTH 50000 GOLD PIECES, BUT AFTER
LEARNING THE CLONE METHOD, WHO NEEDS
IT!!


?HELM - THIS HELM ACTS AS WERDNA'S
AMULET. WE OBVIOUSLY COULD NEVER HAVE
IT IDENTIFIED.

HELM OF MALOR - GUESS WHAT THIS DOES!

ALSO, WAIT 'TIL YOU SEE HOW MUCH MORE
WEAPONS GET TO BE WORTH AS THEIR PLUSES
GO UP! F'RINSTANCE, +5 ARMOR GOES FOR
ONE MILLION GOLD PIECES! WOW!

- ONE LAST THING TO REMEMBER -
WIZARDRY IS EXTREMELY STRUCTURED,
AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IF YOU
ARE LUCKY ENOUGH! WERDNA'S
AMULET, OR EVEN WERDNA HIMSELF
CAN ALSO BE RANDOMLY FOUND!!!
--------------------------------------

THIS IS YET ANOTHER ENTRANCE TO THE
DUNGEONS OF   W  I  Z  A  R  D  R  Y!

WITH MANY THANKS TO OUR GREAT AND
DEVOTED READERS FOR SOME MORE HINTS



SOME MORE STUFF FROM WIZARDRYLAND...

   W I Z A R D R Y    N E W S !!

        GOOD GOD, IT'S HERE!
        --------------------

WE DON'T BELIEVE IT! BUT IT HAS ARRIVED
THE SEMI-DEBUGGED KNIGHT OF DIAMONDS
(OR KOD, AS WE LOVINGLY REFER TO IT)
HAS ARRIVED!! IT STILL HAS SOME MINOR
BUGS, BUT -WHO CARES-, NONE ARE FATAL!
JUST RECEIVED OURS, HINTS FOR KOD ARE
SOON FORTHCOMING. ANY READERS WHO KNOW
TOO MUCH FOR THEIR OWN GOOD CAN SPILL
THEIR GUTS FOR US (AS LONG AS THEY
CLEAN UP!)



           H  I  N  T  S
           -------------

(OTHERWISE ENTITLED 'HOW TO WIN AT
WIZARDRY WITHOUT REALLY TRYING!)

ALRIGHT GUYS, THIS IS THE ULTIMATE!
AVERT THY GAZE (OR CTRL-P, WHATEVER
TURNS YA ON) IF YOU DON'T WANT
SUPER CHARACTERS!

1) MAKE A WEAKLING BISHOP
   GO TO THE EDGE OF TOWN
   TRY TO I)DENTIFY ITEM #9
(DON'T PROTEST- WE KNOW THERE'S ITEM 9,
YOU KNOW THERE'S NO ITEM #9, BUT DOES
-WIZARDRY- KNOW THAT?!?!?!)

   YOU WILL GET 1 BILLION EXPERIENCE!
   GO TO THE INN, AND GAIN 239 LEVELS

2) AFTER DOING THE FORMER, YOU CANNOT
   I)DENTIFY ITEM #9 AGAIN. TO CANCEL

   THIS, GET DRAINED OF ONE LEVEL.
   AND THEN TRY IT AGAIN...AND AGAIN...


AFTERWARDS, USE A THIEVES DAGGER, IF
YOU HAVE ONE, OR A METAMORPHISIS RING
FROM KOD TO CHANGE 3 OF THESE INTO
NINJAS AND LO_RDS RESPECTIVELY, OR USE
LORD'S GARB TO CHANGE CLASSES RANDOMLY.
WITH THIS, YOU SHOULD CREATE A PARTY OF
3 NINJA/LORDS FOLLOWED BY 3 BISHOPS.

GREAT, HUH???


3) HERE IS SOMETHING THAT ONLY WORKS
ON SOME VERSIONS. TRY IDENTIFYING '.'
IT WILL SOMETIMES REDUCE YOUR AGE TO
ZERO, ALTHOUGH MAKING THE 'AFRAID'
CHARACTER NEED A MADI. IT CAN ALSO
HAVE SOME REAL WEIRD-LIKE EFFECTS...


4) PLEASE NOTE: ON THE NEWEST VERSIONS
(2.1) OUR TENTH LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS
DON'T WORK. TOUGH LUCK, GUYS! ALSO,
MANY INTERMEDIATE VERSIONS ARE ALSO
DIFFERENT. IF OURS DOESN'T WORK-
          EXPERIMENT!


AFTER USING METHODS 1-2, YOU MAY NOT

REALLY NEED MUCH EXPERIENCE.TRY LEAVING
THE AMULET AT THE DOOR FOR FUTURE USE-
IT'S QUITE NICE!

AND LASTLY:
HOW TO TRANSFER NON-TRANFERABLE ITEMS
TO KOD AND BACK AGAIN-

JUST TRADE THEM TO A PERSON WHO CAN'T
USE THEM (EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF BLUE
RIBBONS AND THE LIKE WHICH CAN'T BE
MOVED AROUND.
FOR INSTANCE, TRADE A MARASUMA TO A
BISHOP, THEN TRANSFER THE BISHOP.
