PRODOS COMMANDS
===============

CAT or  
CATALOG

Provides a directory listing.  CAT give an abbreviated listing that
will fit on a 40-column screen.  CATALOG provides a more complete
listing for 80-column screens

PREFIX

This is the ProDOS equivalent of the MS-DOS CHDIR, or CD.
Note: ProDOS uses  "/" to indicate directorys while 
      MS-DOS uses  "\".  I'm sure they did this to mess us all up!

CREATE

This is the ProDOS equivalent of the MS-DOS MKDIR, or MD.

RENAME

Renames a file.  Same as what was in AppleDOS 3.3.

DELETE

Deletes a file.  Same as what was in AppleDOS 3.3.

LOCK

Locks a file.  Same as what was in AppleDOS 3.3.

UNLOCK

Unlocks a file.  Same as what was in AppleDOS 3.3.

VERIFY

Verify that a particular file exists.  In AppleDOS, VERIFY would check
to see if each sectore was readable.  I'm not sure if ProDOS does this
or not.

- (DASH)

Executes a file regardless of what type it is.

RUN

Runs an Applesoft BASIC program.
Note: Integer BASIC is *NOT* supported in ProDOS.

LOAD

Loads an Applesoft BASIC program.

SAVE

Saves an Applesoft BASIC program.

BYE

Exits BASIC.SYSTEM to run another .SYSTEM file.

EXEC

Executes a text file.  Same as what was in AppleDOS 3.3.

BRUN

Executes a binary file.  Same as what was in AppleDOS 3.3.

BLOAD

Loades a binary file.  Same as what was in AppleDOS 3.3.

BSAVE

Saves a binary file.  Same as what was in AppleDOS 3.3.


Deferred Execution ProDOS Commands
==================================

For the most part, these are the same a AppleDOS 3.3.  The noteable
exceptions are;

CHAIN

Leaves current BASIC program to execure another *without* erasing
program variables.  This was part of AppleDOS 3.3 but only worked in
Integer BASIC.

STORE

Allows you to save on disk the names and values of all variables in a
BASIC program.  With ProDOS loaded you override the command of the
same name that is available in Applesoft.  The Applesoft versions does
the same but *only* to cassette tape.

RESTORE

Complimentary function to the STORE command.

FLUSH

Forces ProDOS to write data to disk from temporary buffers without
closing files.
