July 9, 1986:

     Ok, now, if you're like most of the Sysops out there running an
Apple-Net, you've probably wanted to run AE/CATFUR with your system,
but just couldn't figure out how to do it.  There are some Sysops out
there who know how to do it, but there was no general file available to
help, or to answer some questions (at least, we've never found one).
Here's where I hope this file will fill that void; be sure and read it
all the way through before you mod your BBS.  Also, I am going to make
an assumption that you know how to program and didn't just get
Apple-Net last week.  *NOTE*: The method I outline below MAY WORK WITH
OTHER SYSTEMS BESIDES APPLE-NET, but I have not tried it elsewhere; If
you're at a loss, you might want to give it a try.  Also *NOTE*: I am
assuming in this article you are using a Hard Drive. The Method I will
describe could be used for floppies, with a little work; I'll describe
that later in this file.

     Now, there are several problems you have to circumvent.  The first
one is maintaining carrier when transferring between Apple-Net and
AE/CATFUR.  First, let's get AE out of the way.  These pokes should
solve that:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For Ascii Express:

     Put this line in the main portion of your BBS.  I will assume you
will have the BBS jump to this line when the command for Drop-into-AE
is selected (Like: IF X1$="Y" THEN 38000):

     38000 A1=300+900*(PEEK(49)=24)+2100*(PEEK(49)=26)
     38005 POKE 1146,39: POKE 1274,99: POKE 1402,139:
           POKE 1530,5: POKE 1658,(4*(A1=300)+5*(A1=1200)):
           POKE 1786,0: POKE 1914,1: POKE 2842,1:
           POKE 768,2: POKE 248,16: POKE 255,16
     38007 PRINT CHR$(4);"BRUN AE,S7,V2"

     Line 38000 determines what baud-rate the caller is at now, so that
in line 38005 it can determine what baud-rate to set AE for: POKE
1658,4 for 300 baud, or POKE 1658,5 for 1200 baud.  By the way, those
pokes in line 38005 come out of the AE Manual and say they're for a
MicroModem or some other generic modem.  Well, apparently they work for
any other modems, too, because they work for our 212 Apple-Cat.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
For CAT-FUR:


     Put this line also in your main BBS.  Again, I assume you do the
jump to this routine yourself (Like: IF X1$="X" THEN 38010):

     38010 POKE 254,32: POKE 2047,187: POKE 2046,1
     38020 PRINT CHR$(4);"BRUN CAT-FUR,S7,V2"

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     You'll also need these pokes (from Apple-Net) to restore the
volume default in DOS, so that you can change volumes from AE or
CATFUR, so add these pokes in lines 38006 and lines 38015:

     380XX POKE -24359,141: POKE -24358,102: POKE -24357,170

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     That was simple.  However, the Apple-Net Modem Driver still causes
a big problem.  It uses some zero page locations, and without getting
into all the reasons, quite simply it does not get along with AE or
CATFUR.  If you BRUN AE after doing those pokes, everything may seem
all right, but you'll probably encounter the same problem we did:  On
Carrier Loss, AEX is not EXEC'd, and the system freezes.

     The solution?  Booting your Hard Drive with, say, PR#7 (If it's in
slot 7, of course) will clear out zero page and reset things nicely for
AE or CATFUR. [Thanks, Rock 'n Roll Doctor, for suggesting that, and
for your help.] The problem is, does it lose carrier?  No.  It
shouldn't.  (At least on the SIDER, it does not.  I am reasonably sure
you should not lose carrier if you are using any other Hard Drive,
etc.)  There, the Hard Drive can load up the HELLO program, and decide
if you're cold booting and want to go run the BBS, or if you want AE or
CATFUR, or whatever (I'll explain how shortly).  Then, a BRUN is all
you need; simple as all that.

     Now, we need to set a flag that will not be wiped out that can
signal what is wanted.  I use POKE 895,x.  For AE, I use POKE 895,4 for
300 baud AE; POKE 895,5 for 1200 baud AE; POKE 895,6 for CAT-FUR; and
PEEK(895) is anything else if the Hard Drive is just cold booting.
First, you will have to re-do 38000- in the Main BBS:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Patches for Main BBS for AE and CATFUR and H.D. boot:

     38000 A1=300+900*(PEEK(49)=24)+2100*(PEEK(49)=26)
     38005 POKE 895,(4*(A1=300)+5*(A1=1200)): PRINT D$;"PR#7"

     38010 POKE 895,6: PRINT D$;"PR#7"

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     Now, in the HELLO program (the first file your HD boots up), all
the necessary POKES can be done before AE/CATFUR is BRUN'd:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
HELLO Program for Hard Drive:


     5     CALL 1002: IF PEEK(895)=4 OR PEEK(895)=5 THEN 30032
     7     IF PEEK(895)=6 THEN POKE 895,0: GOTO 30035
     10    PRINT CHR$(4);"RUN AN.BBS,S7,V3"
     20    END
     30032 POKE 1146,39: POKE 1274,99: POKE 1402,139: POKE 1530,5:
           POKE 1658,PEEK(895): POKE 1786,0: POKE 1914,1: POKE 2842,1:
           POKE 768,2: POKE 248,16: POKE 255,16: CLEAR
     30033 POKE 895,0: CALL 54915: PRINT "TRANSPORTING TO AE...":
           PRINT: PRINT CHR$(4);"BRUN AE,V2"
     30035 POKE 254,32: POKE 2047,187: POKE 2046,1:
           PRINT "TRANSPORTING TO CAT-FUR...":
           PRINT CHR$(4);"BRUN CAT-FUR,V2": END

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     Since you just re-booted, you do not need to restore the Volume
Defaults that Apple-Net had set up before in lines 38006 and 38015.

     Everything should be set.  In the case of AE, you still have to
configure it correctly using INSTALL:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
INSTALL Configuration for Ascii Express:

     Now, go to the INSTALL program from AE, and choose the
UNATTENDED/REMOTE PARAMTERS change option.  Under that, choose 'O' for
"ON-LINE RUN".  Also turn on the "EXEC AEX ON CARRIER LOSS?" option.
The other options are, of course, up to you, like setting up
AE-NOACCESS on certain volumes, your volume configuration, and system
set up.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

     Ok, now, if you're running off floppies (you better have more than
2), the same mod could be used, but it would be damn tight and probably
a waste of time.  What you'd have to do is put AE/CATFUR on drive 1,
then do a PR#6 from the BBS, there, the HELLO program would take over.
And, in the HELLO program, if PEEK(895)=0, then go run AN.BBS on drive
2 or whatever.  You'd have to have AEX run the BBS on that drive, too.
If you're gonna try this, I wish you luck! You'll be tight for space.

     If you have any questions on Apple-Net, just leave me a note on
Infinity's Edge (805/683-2725).  I've been working with it for about 2
years, and probably have the most modded, diverse Apple-Net around.  I
know quite alot about the program and the Modem Driver.  Just leave
[F]eedback to: The 0mega.  The BBS is also a hybrid with Proving
Grounds, which means we have the best of Apple-Net and Proving
Grounds...A heavily modded Apple-Net & on-line adventure, user battles,
gambling casino, bazaar, jousting, and much more.
