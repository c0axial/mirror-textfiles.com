   WHENEVER YOU INITIALIZE A BLANK DISK, A COPY OF DOS IS WRITTEN ONTO IT.
THIS ENSURES THAT THE DISK IS BOOTABLE.  BUT SOME DISKS ARE NEVER BOOTED.
THEY'RE USED ONLY TO STORE PROGRAMS, TEXT FILES OR OTHER DATA.  IF DOS COULD
BE ELIMINATED FROM THESE DISKS, YOU'D GAIN EXTRA STORAGE SPACE FOR OTHER FILES.

   SUCH A DOS-LESS DISK CAN BE CREATED VERY EASILY.  THE METHOD DESCRIBED
BELOW WAS POSTED ON COMPUSERVE BY BILL STEINBERG, A MEMBER OF THE APPLE
INTEREST GROUP OVER THERE.  THE PROCEDURE WORKS WITH ANY 48K APPLE II WITH
DOS 3.3.

   FIRST, BOOT ANY STANDARD APPLE DOS DISK IN ORDER TO LOAD DOS INTO MEMORY.
IF A HELLO PROGRAM RAN, EXIT IT AND GET INTO APPLESOFT.  NOW TYPE IN THE
FOLLOWING SIX POKES:

POKE -20734, 234
POKE -20733, 234
POKE -20732, 234
  (THOSE POKES PREVENT DOS FROM BEING WRITTEN TO THE DISK DURING THE INIT
PROCESS.)

POKE -20813, 4
  (CLEARS THE VTOC SECTOR BIT MAP DOWN TO TRACK 1 INSTEAD OF TRACK 3.)

POKE -23188, 208
POKE -23187, 3
  (EXITS THE INIT ROUTINE WITHOUT SAVING A HELLO PROGRAM.)

   THAT'S ALL.  NOW INITIALIZE A BLANK DISK USING THE INIT COMMAND.  (DON'T
TRY THIS ON A DISK WHICH ALREADY CONTAINS DATA!)  THE NEWLY INITIALIZED DISK
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BOOT, BUT IT WILL PROVIDE 2 TRACKS (32 SECTORS) OF EXTRA
SPACE FOR PROGRAMS OR OTHER FILES.  YOU MAY WISH TO LABEL SUCH DISKS AS
"DATA DISKS" OR "NON-BOOTABLE" OR SOMETHING SIMILAR.  TO USE THESE DISKS
IN THE FUTURE, YOU MERELY LOAD DOS INTO YOUR APPLE WITH A REGULAR, BOOTABLE
DISK, THEN INSERT ONE OF YOUR DOS-LESS DISKS TO LOAD OR SAVE FILES ON IT
AS YOU WOULD WITH ANY OTHER DISK.
