Mission Briefing-

Moondancer:

 Your assignment is vital. Three couriers headed to a top-secret conference in
Brussels are missing. Each was carrying a crucial component of the NATO
non-nuclear defense plans. Now two are dead and the third, last seen in Berlin,
has vanished. You must find the three critical components (a computer chip, a
floppy disk, and a CPU) before the NATO meeting -and before they fall into the
wrong hands.

 You know what's at stake. This time it isn't surveillance. It isn't a drop. Or
data farming. This is the majors, and you've just been called up. And there's
only one rule in this game: don't trust anyone.

 Fly to Berlin and await further instructions. Outside of an occasional
electronic contact, you're on your own. But then you've always liked it that
way.

Other Stuff-

 Other than that, the manual doesn't say a lot else that is not obvious, or at
least easy to figure out. Here is a list of stuff that may not be apparent.

- USE the photo-fax to send a picture of a person to Langley, and if they have
a dossier on that person, you can access it through your computer at your
apartment.

- FERAT is a device that let's you know when you are near a part of the plans.

- Amyl Nitrate and Tannic Acid- these can be antidotes to poison.

Some Hints-

- You should probably make a street map as you go along. The game comes with
one, but it is just a simple map- there's nothing special on it except the
location of your apartment, which is on Knesebeck st., between Berliner and
Hohenzollern. By the way, Berliner runs north and south.

- You can ARM during an encounter, which comes in handy considering that the
local police seem to get upset when you walk around with your 'piece' hanging out!

That's about all I can think of that you might need, after all, the manual
doesn't tell you much else.  The map will be coming out soon.
