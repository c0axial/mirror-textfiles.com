Thanx for the feedback!  More Mac-Crunching levels are on the way.  Here's
a version with awsome SoundSmith music and sound effects.  It's much more of
a "sound" game than the original beta version!

===============================================================================
The Story
===============================================================================

     The year is 1995.  The Mac has taken over the world, crushing IBM and
its clones like so much silicon styrofoam.  The evil Emperor Scully has decided
that the next target is: the Apple II!  He plans to stop the Apple II by
kidnapping its users and placing them in a series of challenges in the hopes
that they will become "Mac-ified".  Their only hope is to destroy the Macs.
For this first round, you have unlimited chances at the Macs.  In later
contests, you might not be so lucky. Can you save the Apple II?
Or will Scully reign over the computing world? Only you can find out!
Play Mega Mac Munch!

===============================================================================
How to Play
===============================================================================

     Unpack Mega Mac Munch and its companion picture data file to the same
place.  Mega Mac Munch is completely GS/OS friendly and can be run from the
Finder, even though its a Free Tools program.  MMM should work identically on
ROM 01 or 03, and it will run at the same speed no matter what your GS speed
is, whether it is Fast, Zip GS, or TransWarp GS.  To launch MMM, double click
on the Mega.Mac.Munch icon from the Finder.  After a few seconds, the game
screen will appear.  You may move the paddle back and forth with the mouse.
To start the game, or to restart after losing a ball, click the mouse button.
Esc pauses the game until another key is pressed, and Q quits back to the
Finder or other launcher.  Mega Mac Munch is written in 100% ORCA/M assembler
for the maximum speed and minimum program size.

Game Keys
---------
     Although MMM is played with the mouse, several keys have affect on the
game. For the most part, these are classic Apple II keys, but here they are:

     Esc  pauses game and music.  Press any key to continue.
     M    toggles the msuic on and off.
     S    toggles sound effects on and off.
     Q    quits the game and returns to whatever launched it.

===============================================================================
Problems and Coming Attractions (this is a beta version)
===============================================================================

     o There is only one level, "Pong the Mac Pluses".
     o You have unlimited lives (some won't consider this a problem!)
     o You will get the same score everytime you finish (this is due to the
       first two).
     o The ball occasionally skirts a Mac and erases part of it by mistake.

              Possible Level Ideas

     o Pac-Mac with Mac IIs
     o Mac Invaders with Mac SEs
     o Maccer (Frogger) with Mac LCs
