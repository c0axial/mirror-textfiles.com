Several Up and down joystick movements are necessary to complete a successful
snatch, abd each must be made at the right moment.

To bend down and grasp the bar push joystick back or press (M)
To begin lifting the bar, Push joystick foward (press I)
During the lift, Pull the joystick back (pressM) to drop underneath the bar
and snatch it over your head.
To stand up from a sqatting position push the joystick forward (pressI)

Whan two or more judges' lights in front of the platform turn white, Pull
joystick back,(M> to lower weights back down to the floor

The Clean and Jerk.

to grasp the bar pull joystick back (M)
to begin lifing the bar, push joystick forward(pressI)
Durning the lift, pull the joystick back (M) to clean the bar and drop into a
squat with the bar resting on your chest.

To Stand up from the squatting position Push joystick forward(I)
To jerk,the bard above your head , pull the joystick back again (M)
Whan two or more judges' lights in fron of the platform turn white pull
joystick back (M) to lower the wieghts to the floor.

Scoring: The winner is the lifter who successfully liftes the greatest wight.
At least two of the judges must give white success lights for a lift to be
considerd successful. The judgesvot on the accracyor your timing.Two hesitent
white votesmean your timing is poor. THree whot quick votes mean your timing
was perfect.

Timing: As wirght increases, timing becomes more critical.The right moment to
clean the bar to clean the bat to your chest is easy to judgeat lower weights,
but extremly difficult as the clean and jerk approches 200kg. After you clean
the bar,wait the right amount of timetp gather your stregth for a final lift.
Too short and the lifter isnt ready,too long and his stregth gives out. The
key to timing is practice.

Stratagey: The key to stategy in weightlifting is knowing when to increase the
wieght- and how much to increase it. Know your limits and those of your
opponents. A sudden 60kg increase my knock your opponents out of the competito
n - but make sure you can lift it befor you gamble!
