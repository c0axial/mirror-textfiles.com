When Xenocide is loaded, plug your mouse in for some heavy action. You will
come to the startup menu. The top left corner of your menu is to calibrate your
joystick. (Note: Joystick Optional). The right top corner is to view the high
scores. It gives you the option of erasing the high scores.  You can clear the
high scores by pressing 'C'. The bottom left corner gives you the option of
turning stereo ON or OFF. The bottom right corner is simply to start your
mission.

      ______________________Hints & Suggestions______________________

1. Try shooting at rocks and walls in the cave levels-some have bombs and keys
   behind them

2.  If you fly by a refueling bay, make sure that you land even if you don't
    need the fuel or ammunition-if you happen to die later then you will start
    back at the last bay that you landed. Now we wouldn't want that, now would
    we?

3.  When advancing into the Bio-lab, be sure to get a full supply of ammunition
    and grab the options that will be most valuable to you in the Bio-lab
    (Regro Shield!)

4.  Option boxes in the Bio-lab are not as plentiful as those in the caves, so
    use them more prudently.


--- Levels ---

The Hovercraft Level :

The object of the hovercraft level is to avoid hitting large rocks and aliens,
pick up as many ammunition canisters as possible and get to the docking station
which will take you to the next level before running out of fuel.  At the start
of the hovercraft level you will see a road before you.  The ammunition
canisters you are to collect will be found along side the road and the docking
station will be found somewhere along the way.  Since a hovercraft hovers above
the ground using its anti-gravity pads, it is not necessary to stay on the
road. However, if you wander too far off the road you may never find the
docking station.

Along the way you will encounter strange alien life forms that you can avoid or
shoot. If you happen to hit one at slow speed you will run it over but fast
speed will damage your hovercraft. If you hit one of the rocks at low speed it
will stop you but at higher speeds it will do massive damage to your
hovercraft. Hitting to many objects will destroy your hovercraft!

The ammunition canisters are very important because they will determine the
amount of ammunition you will be able to carry in the following levels. To get
a canister simply run over it with your hovercraft. (hitting canisters will not
harm your hovercraft).  Once you hear the "alert" voice you will be near the
docking station and a red dot will be shown on the radar screen showing the
distance and direction to the station.  To dock simply run into the docking
station and you will be taken to the cave level.


Cave level I :

You have now left your hovercraft and put on a jetpack to travel through the
treacherous cave level.  The cave level has two basic objectives: to collect
five bombs that will be required in the Bio-lab to destroy the moon and to find
the docking pad that will take you to the next level. The bombs are placed
secretly throughout the cave and there will always be five of them. You cannot
continue to the next level until you have collected all five bombs.

As in the hovercraft level, you have a set amount of fuel and ammunition
capacity.  However, for each ammunition canister that you have collected your
maximum ammunition capacity will be raised.  You will start out with maximum
fuel and ammunition, but as the game progresses you will run out of fuel and
undoubtedly ammunition.  Thus, it is important that you land at the refueling
bays located throughout the cave whenever possible to replenish your fuel and
ammunition.  It is possible to travel back up the cave all the way to your
starting position, but you may not go back to your previous level. This makes
it easy to clear out a portion of the cave then fly back to the closest
refueling bay and refuel. Also, if you happen to die in a cave level then your
next life will begin at the last refueling bay that you landed on.

Although there are many things that you must beware of in the cave level, there
are also very rewarding thing as well. For example, Option Pods (shown as
pulsating blue spheres) provide you with the different options that are listed
at the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.  When you collect a blue option
you will be able to activate the first item on the options list. To activate
the option, simply press the spacebar and it will turn from light blue to
yellow, indicating that the option is active.  If you collect a second blue
option pod and you have not yet used the first option, the indicator light will
advance to the next option in the list.  You may still collect options while
one is activated, but you cannot have two or more options at the same time.  If
you have an active option, then collecting more options will move the light
blue indicator down the list as before, but this time skipping over the
activated option. For example, if the Auto Blaster option is in yellow, or
active and the sonic wave option in light blue, collecting one or more option
pod will now make Mega Shield a light blue option. Be careful, however, for if
you have Regro Shield in light blue (waiting to use it when your shield runs
low) and you run into an option pod, then Flesh Freeze will now be in light
blue and you will have lost the ability to activate Regro Shield. This could
make even a bad day seem enjoyable!

Once you are at the end of the cave and have collected all five bombs, land on
the docking pad (marked with blinking arrows) and press button 0 on your
joystick. This will advance you to the next level.


Cave level II :

There are a few differences between Cave level I and II. Most notable is the
fact that your travel will take you through an underwater environment.  The
following is a list of the differences that you will experience.

1. You will sink if you are not swimming
2. The fuel indicator becomes an oxygen indicator, the refueling bays will now
   give oxygen supplies instead of fuel.
3. There are no more bombs to collect in Level II, but there are locked doors
   that must be opened with keys, which are hidden throughout the cave. To pick
   up a key simply run into it. To open the door just touch the keyhole in the
   door after picking up a key.  Note, however, that a key may only be used
   once.

4.  The bomb indicator becomes the key indicator and will keep track of how
    many keys you have.

Once you are at the end of Level II cave, land on the docking pad (marked with
blinking arrows), press button 0 on the joystick and you will be taken down to
the Bio-lab. When you get to the Bio-lab your shield will be repaired and you
will have the same options and ammunition.


Bio-lab level :

The objective of the Bio-lab level is to destroy the moon you are on by
dropping all of the five bombs that you collected in the cave level into
nuclear storage ports that are located throughout the laboratory and teleport
off to the moon.

The screen view is one in which you, the player, are looking down from above
the floorplan of the laboratory. You will notice that there is no indicator or
fuel, as you are now able to walk around the laboratory.

Once you have explored the Bio-lab and have placed all of the five bombs, then
you should go to the central control room and activate the teleporter (by
running into the computer terminal) and then moving to the teleporter pad. You
will then be teleported to your ship where you will be outfitted for your next
mission, or given the win sequence if you have destroyed the final moon.


--- Using The Joystick ---

To use the joystick simply point the joystick in the direction you wish to
move.  Press button 0 to fire Fireballs, Lasers and Flame Throwers and also to
refuel. Press button 1 to fire Missiles, Grenades, Sonic Waves, and land Mines.
