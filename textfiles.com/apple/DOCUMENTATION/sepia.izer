Sepia-izer
==========
     
     Lots of IIgs graphics, especially scanned-in images, are grey scale.
With 16 shades of grey, a reasonable degree of photographic clarity can be
achieved on the GS. However, grey scale is kind of -- well -- grey. Sepia
tone is often a much more aesthetically pleasant palette, while retaining
all the clarity of grey scale. For those who may not know, sepia tone
refers to a range of brownish tones, from almost black to almost white.
Many early photographs were sepia tone, rather than black and white.
Personally, I like sepia tone a lot.
     You can convert a grey scale graphic to sepia tone with most paint
programs, either by building the sepia tone palette by hand, or by copying
the palette from a pre-existing sepia tone graphic. The former method is
slow and difficult, and the latter isn't possible with all paint programs,
and requires that you already own at least one sepia tone graphic.
     Sepia-izer is another method of converting grey scale graphics to
sepia tone. Sepia-izer will take any PIC or Apple Preferred Format PNT
file, and convert the palette of the graphic to sepia tone. To use
Sepia-izer, simply launch it, and select a file from the list displayed.
Prompts explain how to navigate to the disk and folder your graphics are
in. The file SF.GET must be in the same folder that SEPIA.IZER is in when
you launch it. (SF.GET is a utility which provides the user-friendly,
point-and-click means of selecting files in Sepia-izer. SF.GET is freeware
and is available with complete documentation on GEnie and America Online.)

Ifs, Ands, Buts, and Watch-outs:
     Sepia-izer is dangerous if misused. It alters your original graphic
file, rather than creating a new graphic, so be sure your file isn't
irreplaceable. If the original graphic was not, in fact, a grey scale
graphic, the result will be a mess. Sepia-izer only works on Apple
Preferred Format PNT files and SHR image PIC files. Unfortunately,
Sepia-izer has no capability for displaying graphics.
     I'm not pretending Sepia-izer is worth much of anything (it's
freeware, by the way). It was really a bored-hot-summer-night kind of a
project. But _I_ use it and find it worthwhile; maybe you will, too.
