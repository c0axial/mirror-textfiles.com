                Part I:  Getting To Know Your Hydrofoil

Preliminary Training:  If this is your first experience controlling a
Hydrofoil, you may want to sit back and watch a demonstration. 

Here's how:

When you have your computer up and running, you will be presented with a
selection of assignments. Each assignment is a mission taking you to various
sensitive parts of the world. These are described in detail in Part II of this
manual. To watch the demo, select MISSION 0 from the list of nine. As you
watch, take note of the two 'view modes' (Bridge and Operations Map) and the
features you can control from each. You may want to read Part III of this
Manual as you watch the demo.

When you feel you are ready to undertake a real mission, press Shift-Q to quit
the demo and then select another one. We suggest you start with one of the
early missions before attempting the more advanced ones.

 
                             Part II:  Assignments

Once you have received basic Hydrofoil training, you will be in a position to
undertake the following assignments as part of the TAG task force. Of these
eight assignments, the first two are part of your advanced training, and
provide you with simulated combat experience. We strongly recommend that you
gain proficiency in the first two assignments before you proceed to the more
advanced missions.

At the end of each assignment you will receive a score and a rank, based on
your performance during that mission. Scores are calculated on the basis of
five factors, as described below. Note that the actual values will vary from
mission to mission, because of the different objectives of each one. For
example, in the first assignment (Battle Training), speed and destruction are
the most important factors, while survival is not. By contrast, in the fourth
mission (A Better Part of Valor), survival is most important, while destruction
of enemies is relatively unimportant.

Scores:
------

1. Main Objective:  Full points are awarded if the mission is successfully
completed; no points if the main objective was not accomplished.
   Range: 1000 - 5000 points.

2. Enemies Destroyed: Points are awarded for each enemy destroyed.
    Range: 50 - 500 points.

3. Enemies Damaged:  Points are awarded for each enemy hit but not destroyed.
    Range: 25 - 250 points.

4. Time Remaining:  Points for time remaining are awarded only when the
mission is successfully completed before time runs out. Points are for each
minute remaining.
    Range: 1 - 4 points/minute.

5. Survival Bonus:  Survival points are awarded when the mission is
successfully completed or when time runs out, assuming you haven't been blown
to shit by the enemy. Points are awarded for each of the twelve sections of
the ship that are capable of sustaining damage (six for the hull and six for
the systems). Full points are awarded for undamaged sections, half for slight
damage (yellow on the damage display), and no points for heavy damage (red on
the display).
    Range 20 - 200

RANKS:

Ranks are based on points earned, with different scales for each mission,
depending on their relative difficulty. For example, because the training
exercise is the easiest of all the missions, you can only advance to
Lieutenant, no matter how high you score [Sucks]. More difficult missions,
such as Search For Terrorists, allow you to achieve rank of Captain, while the
most difficult ones, such as Supply Convoy, allow you to reach the top rank of
Admiral [w0w!]. In any case, to achieve the top rank in a assignment you must
accomplish the main objective.

The ranks, in ascending order, are as follows:

Deck Mopper
Ensign
Lieutenant
Commander
Captain
Commodore
Rear Admiral
Admiral

The Missions:

1)  Battle Training:
     Ten enemy ships will be introduced to your training area off Key West, one
at a time. These vessels will range from simple patrol boats all the way to
powerful Nanuchka II missile corvettes. This exercise is designed to
familiarize you with the PHM and its weapon systems.

        Objective:  Sink all simulated enemy ships.
        Rank Attainable:  Lieutenant
        Enemy Vessels:  Patrol Boat; OSA I, Nanuchks II.
        Strategy Tips:  This is a good learning assignment,  Use your gun on   
the patrol boats, and save your missiles for the bigger ships.


2)  Graduation Exercise
     In this exercise, all the enemy vessels you seen in the first assignment
will be coming at you all at once, doing their best to blow the shit out of
you. Sinking all the enemy vessels as quickly as possible is more important
than surviving undamaged.

        Objective:  Sink all simulated enemy ships.
        Rank Attainable:  Lieutenant
        Enemy Vessels:  Patrol Boat; OSA I, Nanuchka II.
        Strategy Tips:  Get moving right away;  you're a sitting duck if you   
don't. Use you missiles on the more distant ships and your gun on the         
closer ones. Watch your radar for fast-moving dots approaching your           
ship. These are enemy missiles. Use chaff to deflect them.        (See Part
III).

3)  Terrorist Attack 
     Approx. eight hours ago, terrorists attacked a seaside resort, killing
dozens of vacationers and wounding hundreds. The terrorists were seen fleeing
west in various patrol craft. Witnesses estimate seven to ten vessels of
varying types, some suspected to be OSA I missile boats, others small patrol
vessels. Your mission is to seek and intercept these vessels, and sink them.

        Objective:  Sink all simulated ships.
        Rank Attainable:  Commander.
        Enemy Vessels:  Patrol Boats, OSA II, Zhuk.
        Strategy Tips:  The terrorist vessels are to the west of your starting 
position and moving rapidly north. Try to cut them off, while avoiding        
their allies coming in from the northeast. Save you missiles for the          
OSA class ships.

4)  A Better Part of Valor
     War is brewing in South America. Your PHM is needed there as soon as
possible. From your base at Key West, you will need to navigate the dangerous
Yucatan Straits between Mexico and Cuba in order to reach southern waters. To
accomplish your objective in this assignment, you need only to get PHM to the
southern edge of the map. Look out for enemy vessels who will be trying to
stop you. Use your SeaSprite helicopter to screen your PHM and help you avoid
the enemy, or to help you seek out and destroy the bastards.

        Objective:  Escape with your Hydrofoil off the south edge of the map   
with as little damage as possible.
        Rank Attainable:  Commander.
        Enemy Vessels:  Komar and the Assad missile boats.
        Strategy Tips:  Keep moving at full speed. Engage enemies at extreme  
range with your missiles if they are in your path.

5)  Search for Terrorists
     To missile corvettes have unsuccessfully attacked an American base off the
southern coast of Sicily. A Sparviero Hydrofoil and an AB 212 helicopter are
available to help hunt them down. The mission objective is to sink both
attackers (who will be fleeing south) before they escape. They are thought to
be fleeing toward Tripoli, and can be distinguished from similar vessels by
their course. Although a variety of enemy ships will be patrolling along a
line north of Tripoli, remember that the fleeing ships are your main objective!

        Objective:  Sink the two fleeing Nanuchka II class ships.
        Rank Attainable:  Commander.
        Enemy Vessels:  OSA I, OSA II, Nanuchka II.
        Strategy Tips:  Try to avoid the other ships on your way to your       
objective. Save your missiles for them.

6)  Supply Convoy
     A South American country has been taken over by a dictator, who has
succeeded in turning the Caribbean into a war zone. Your mission is to escort
a high-speed cargo ship carrying medical supplies and food to a group of
refugees. The dictators forces consist of two varieties of a convertible
Vosper-Thornycroft ship that comes with either two missiles and a small caliber
gun, or just a 76mm cannon identical to your own.

        Objective:  Get you convoy ship to the southern part of the eastern    
edge of the map.
        Rank Attainable:  Admiral
        Enemy Vessels:  Vosper-Thornycrft 121 ft class
        Strategy Tips:  Conserve fuel by keeping your engine setting at 2 or   
less as much as possible, sprinting ahead at high speed only when you          
spot enemies or when you fall behind your convoy ship. Keep the convoy        
moving at full speed toward the south one-third of the east edge of the        
map, an use your helicopters to spot attackers before they can get             
close. Keep your ship between the attackers and the convoy.

7)  Surveillance Mission
     It is suspected that the military equipment is being smuggled to the
dictator through an outwardly neutral South American country. A cargo ship has
been photographed loading up with tanks and aircraft parts in the Baltic, and
is believed to be approaching Nicaragua. Seven ships of similar construction
carrying farm machinery and building supplies are also entering the area to
provide cover for the arms ship. Your mission is to find all eight ships and
photograph them at close range so their identities can be established and
compared with that of the suspected arms ship. Photography is accomplished
automatically by approaching to within 1500 feet of the ship and training your
binoculars on it (by choosing it as a target), BUT be careful not to sink them
Sinking one of these vessels will result in an international incident, and will
immediately end the mission in failure. Use your two SeaHawk helicopters to
scout out the cargo ships. Some of the dictators forces are believed to be in
this area, so try to identify any ships you find at as long a range as
possible. Watch your fuel usage!!

        Objective:  Find and photograph all eight cargo vessels in the        
Caribbean without sinking any.
        Rank Attainable:  Rear Admiral.
        Enemy Vessels:  Cargo ships, OSA II missile boats.
        Strategy Tips:  The cargo ships move slowly, but they are scattered all
over the sea and will eventually reach a safe port. Move fast, and use        
your helicopters to find them as soon as possible.

8)  Jihad
     Your mission is to escort a supply ship out of the Persian Gulf. The only
complication: a war is going on [christ, thats all?], and innocent ships are
being fired upon without warning. The supply ship is trying to evacuate
western workers from the war zone, but the captain is too frightened to try and
escape through the maelstrom of warring factions that fill the Gulf. You will
need to make your way through the Straits of Hormuz to Kuwait where you will
rendezvous with the supply ship. The supply ship will respond to your controls
in the same was an auxiliary helicopter (see Part III).

     Try to avoid conflict if possible. Enemies are less likely to attack if
you are peaceful. However, if you take hostile action or if you get too close,
they will pass the word to their fleet to attack. The supply ship will be a
tempting target for them at all times, so guard it well. In any case, remember
that your primary mission is to get the supply shit out safely - damage to your
Hydrofoil is important only insofar as it compromises that mission. Use your
Seahawk helicopters to provide you with critical info on ship movements.

        Objective:  Escort the supply ship safely into the Indian Ocean.
        Rank Attainable:  Admiral
        Enemy Vessels:  OSA I and OSA II missile corvettes.
        Strategy Tips:  You're on your own for this one...

                        

                          Part III: Hydrofoil Operation

Introduction:
     The Hydrofoil is an all weather, high speed, compact weapons system,
making it ideal for strike, patrol and surveillance missions. Because of its
fully submerged foils, the Hydrofoil is capable of sustained high-speed runs
across heavy seas, with a maneuverability of a 76mm gun, missiles, and chaff
for radar deflection.
     As Hydrofoil commander, you can switch between the view from the Hydrofoil
bridge and a top-down view of the operations map. Each uses its own set of the
keyboard and joystick controls. Specific operating instructions are given in
the command summary card, included in your information packet. [what a joke]

The View From The Bridge:

The top half of the screen shows the view from bridge. The cross is the aiming
cursor, while the blinking little line is the aim correctors light, and the
think that looks like a shoe is the binocular view. The bottom half shows the
Weapons indicator on the lower left side (where it says gun, chaff, HASM) the
middle where the circle is, is the radar screen, and on the right side, the
damage indicators appear. The bottom has the time compression on the lower
right half of the screen. The Hydrofoils Instruments are composed of:

     Gyrocompass - Indicates Hydrofoil current bearing; north being straight up
     RPM - Indicates Hydrofoils engine speed
     Speed - Indicates Hydrofoil speed in knots
     Radar - Shows all craft within Hydrofoils radar range
     Weapons Status - Indicates which weapons are currently active and the     
number of rounds remaining
     Fuel - Indicates the amount of fuel remaining
     Warning Indicators - Red warning indicators show a potential problem
     Depth - Indicates danger of running aground. Flashes when heading        
towards land
     Lock - One or more enemy missiles are locked onto you. Fired or are about
to be fired upon by enemy ships
     Damage - Shows which parts of the ship (yours) are damaged.


Operations Map:

The Operations Map shows the helicopters, convoys, and the Hydrofoil. The
circle with one dot is helicopter 1. If it has 3 dots, its helicopter 2, the
diamond is a convoy, and the small circle is your ship. You can switch from
the view from the bridge to a map of the surrounding area. The map shows the
entire area of operations for the current assignment. It shows all the major
land masses, the borders of the assignment area, the current location of the
Hydrofoil, the locations of all the friendly forces and its radar range. In
addition, the operations map shows the locations of your helicopters. Control
of such helicopters or an escorted convoy is maintained from the Operations
Map.


Weapons and Defenses:

76mm cannon: Its fire rate is 90 rounds per minute, its effective against
Aircraft and missiles, its range is about ten miles. Because of the needed
time for a shell to travel to its target, the effective range against moving
targets is approx. six miles. Thus, even though your fire control radar allows
you to lock on to a target, you will need to 'lead' your cannon ahead of moving
targets further then one or two miles away.


Chaff rockets: These allow you to fire exploding rockets filled with aluminum
foil into the air. When they explode, the rockets disperse their chaff into
the air, attracting the enemy missiles and deflecting them from your ship. Your
best strategy on using the chaff rockets is to fire them when you are moving at
a right angle to the oncoming missile. Chaff is best fired when the enemy
missile is about a mile away.

Harpoon Missiles: These are the most accurate and most potent weapons. They
will hit their target 90 per cent of the time and will destroy most small ships
with a single hit. Because your radar is likely to be more accurate over a
greater distance than enemy's, you can destroy an enemy vessel by firing a
Harpoon at your maximum (40 mile) sighting range even before the enemy has a
chance to launch against you.

Gabriel Missiles: This missile has a shorter range then the Harpoon missiles,
but their guidance systems are reputed to be slightly more accurate then those
of the Harpoons. They carry a 400 pound high explosive warhead. Use these
suckers against ships beyond gun range.

Exocet Missiles: Same as Harpoon Missile.

Radar: Your radar system's range is about 40 miles, although it is greater from
the front or the back of the Hydrofoil. You can take advantage of this by
turning the Hydrofoil towards the target. Your Hydrofoil is represented by a
flashing 'blip' in the center of the display. If this 'blip' isn't flashing,
another ship is very close to you.

Auxiliary Craft:  Some assignments involve the use of search helicopters. In
such cases, helicopters are controlled from the Operations Map, same applies to
Convoy ships.

Damage: Your Hydrofoil is capable of operating even if it sustains damage.
           


Hull Damage:  The Hydrofoil's hull is separated into six watertight
compartments. Light damage to any or all of the six compartments does not
affect the ship, but serves as a warning that continued hits will cause heavy
damage. Heavy damage to a critical number of compartments can sink your
Hydrofoil. This critical number varies among the different Hydrofoils, as
follows: the PHM can sustain heavy damage to four compartments before sinking,
the Israeli Flagstaff II will sink after heavy damage to two compartments. 

    System Damage:
        76mm Cannon: Light damage may cause your gun to misfire; heavy damage  
will disable it completely.
        Radar: Light damage restricts your radar to 20 miles; heavy damage     
restricts the range to 10 miles.
        Chaff: With light damage, the chaff rockets may misfire, expending a   
round in vain. With heavy damage, they will not work at all.
        Missiles: Light damage causes misfire, while heavy damage knocks them  
out all together.
        Fuel Tanks: Light damage increases fuel drain; heavy damage increases  
it even more.
        Engines: Light damage decreases your max speed; heavy damage decreases 
it even more, sometimes to the point of immobility.


Operating Instructions:

     You can operate your Hydrofoil either from the Bridge or from the
Operations Map. To switch from one to the other, press 'V' on the keyboard.
From the Bridge you can maneuver the Hydrofoil, or select, aim, and fire your
weapons. You can also adjust your radar scanning range from 2.5 miles to 40
miles. From the Operations Map you can control your aux. vessels, or you can
set your Hydrofoil on a course using automatic pilot. Some operations are
available in either mode. Thus, from either the Bridge or the Operations Map
you can pause and restart proceedings, you can quit and select a new mission,
and you can speed up or slow down the passage of time. You can speed time up
to 128 times; thus, when you do so, every element is affected equally.


        Bridge: 
          Maneuvering the Hydrofoil:  You can maneuver your Hydrofoil  with
either the keyboard or joystick. Moving the joystick forward speeds up the
ship, while pulling it back slows it down. Moving the joystick right or left
moves your ship that way [Duh..]. See the command summary card for the
keyboard equivalents. Note that maneuvering the Hydrofoil manually from the
Bridge has the effect of disengaging the automatic pilot.

        Aiming and Firing Weapons: You can also use the joystick to aim and
fire your weapons. Pressing the <Spacebar> toggles the joystick between
maneuvering the hydrofoil and aiming your weapons. To aim at a target, you
first need to select it from among the enemy craft within your radar by
pressing T several times until the target is bracketed on your radar screen. 
At that point the target vessel appears in the binocular view at the top of the
screen. To aim your gun, move the aiming cursor so that it is over the target
in the binocular view. Move the joystick forward to move the cursor up, and
move it back down to bring the cursor down. Moving the joystick left or right
moves the cursor left or right [duh..]. To fire weapon, press the fire button
on the joystick or strike <return> on the keyboard. You can correct you aim by
using the 'aim corrector': move the aiming cursor toward the aim corrector and
fire again. Note that you only need to aim your gun once. Missiles
automatically go toward the ship in the binocular view at the time of firing,
while chaff affects all incoming missiles depending on their distance from the
Hydrofoil. You select among the available weapons from the keyboard, see your
command summary card for details. [ok..]

Operations Map

Automatic Pilot: To set a course for hydrofoil, first make sure that the
Hydrofoil is selected by pressing the appropriate key. Next, move the cross
hair to your destination point and press a key (1 through 5). Pressing 5 moves
the Hydrofoil to its destination at full speed, while 1 moves the Hydrofoil at
its slowest speed. If you already have a speed selected, you can press the
joystick button to move the Hydrofoil to the new destination at the currently
selected speed. Pressing 0 stops the Hydrofoil. When you return to the
Bridge, changing direction (w/keyboard or joystick) disengages the automatic
pilot and returns you to manual control. You can, however, change the
Hydrofoil's speed from the Bridge by pressing keys 1 though 5 without
disengaging the automatic pilot.

To re-engage automatic pilot, return to the Operations Map, select the
Hydrofoil, then press the joystick button or select a speed as before. Your
Hydrofoil will then move toward the previously selected destination. Messages
on the Bridge and Operations Map indicate current status of the automatic
pilot.

Controlling Aux. Craft:  When you are in the Operations Map you can also
control the aux. craft that are available to you. Depending on the assignment,
these can include helicopters, or a convoy of ships. To control an aux. craft,
first select it by pressing the key for that craft (see command summary card
AGAIN!!! would of been easier to just do the Q-ref card it self) and then move
the cross hair to the destination point. Press 1 though 5 to set the aux.
craft's speed and start it off towards its destination.

Aux. Craft in the Operations Map are color-coded:  Helicopters are green, and
the convoys are gray. Each aux. craft is also identifiable by its own icon. To
display the aux. craft icons, press D. this changes the display from radar
circles to the vessel icons. This feature is particularly useful if many
enemies are nearby.

Time Compression:  You can use time compression to speed up events in the
Operations Map until you get to the center of the action. You can then slow
events back down, or you can leave them speeded up. If you compress time to
more than eight times normal, any action from the enemy (such as missile or
cannon shot) will automatically slow it back down to eight times. This way you
can use time compression to make your assignments more challenging.


                     PHM Command Summary Card (Quick Ref.)

OVERVIEW

PHM Pegasus is a simulation requiring both strategic and tactical ability. The
object is to complete each mission by achieving it's main objective in as short
a time as possible. See your Manual for details on the assignments.

Hydrofoil operation is by means of keyboard and joystick. You can use either to
control the hydrofoil's movement, weapons aiming and firing, and any auxiliary
craft. Use the keyboard to pause and resume play, to increase or decrease time
compression, to switch between the Bridge and the Operations Map, and to select
weapons or auxiliary craft.

Two main viewing "modes" are available at any time - the Bridge and the
Operations Map. The key table that will follow shows the effect of each
keystroke under each of the two modes.


GETTING STARTED

Let's skip this.


SPOTTER CARDS

The identification cards in the center of your Manual can help you spot and
identify the vessels and aircraft that are active in each mission. Shooting
friendly vessels can make you very unpopular with the Commodore (I almost
barfed when I saw that word too) so it is particularly important that you
identify the vessels in each mission. This way you won't end up shooting the
convoy you are trying to rescue. To use the cards, CAREFULLY remove them from
the manual by tearing the center perforation, and then tear out each card
individually. Before you start an assignment, read the mission description in
the Manual and select the card for each vessel in the mission. Keep the cards
as handy as you proceed with your assignment, and refer to them when you need
help identifying one of the vessels.

JOYSTICK CONTROL

You can use the joystick either to control the hydrofoil or to aim and fire
your weapons. From the Bridge, in Movement mode, you can control the
hydrofoil's movement by moving the joystick left or right, and its speed by
moving it forward or back. In Weapons mode, use the joystick to move the aiming
cursor around the binocular view. Fire your weapons in either mode by pressing
the fire button. You can toggle between Movement and Weapons mode by pressing
the spacebar. From the Operations Map, use your joystick to set your
destination cursor, and the fire button to set off on your course.
