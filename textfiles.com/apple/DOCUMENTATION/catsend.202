CATSEND  202  IS  A  FILE  TRANSFER  PROGRAM WRITTEN FOR THE APPLE CAT
MODEM. WHAT DISTINGUISHES IT FROM OTHER, SIMILAR PROGRAMS IS  THAT  IT
OPERATES  AT  1200 BAUD HALF-DUPLEX, COMMONLY KNOWN AS '202'. ALTHOUGH
CATSEND WAS DESIGNED WITH EASE-OF-USE IN MIND, SOME  DOCUMENTATION  IS
NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND FULLY HOW TO USE IT. 

WHEN  YOU FIRST RUN CATSEND, YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A MENU SIMILAR
TO THE ONE BELOW:

                          -MAIN MENU-
           
                [S]END FILES
                [R]ECEIVE FILES
                [C]ATALOG DISK

                [T]OGGLE DRIVE      ->1

                [H]ANGUP HANDSET
                [A]DD A FILE
                [N]EW SLOT FOR CAT  ->2
                [Z]ERO ALL FILES
                [V]IEW SELECTED FILES
                
                --  --  --  --  --


I WILL NOW GO THROUGH EACH OPTION, EXPLAINING WHAT EACH DOES  AND  HOW
TO USE IT PROPERLY. 

[S]END  FILES:  WHEN SELECTED, THIS WILL PROMPT YOU TO 'PRESS A KEY TO
CONTINUE...' IF YOU PRESS <ESC>, YOU WILL BE RETURNED TO THE MAIN MENU
WITH ALL SELECTED FILES INTACT. OTHERWISE, THE  SENDING  PROCESS  WILL
BEGIN.  IF  NO FILES HAVE BEEN SELECTED, HOWEVER, YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED
OF THIS AND WILL BE RETURNED TO THE MAIN MENU. AFTER THE FILE TRANSFER
IS COMPLETE, CATSEND WILL SOUND A PAGER 3 TIMES ON  BOTH  THE  SENDING
AND  RECEIVING SIDE TO ALERT BOTH PARTIES THAT IT IS DONE. THE CARRIER
WILL TURN OFF AND THE HANDSET WILL GO OFF-HOOK TO PRESERVE  THE  LINE,
AND YOU WILL BE RETURNED TO THE MAIN MENU. 

[R]ECEIVE  FILES:  WHEN  'R'  IS TYPED FROM THE MAIN MENU, YOU WILL BE
PROMPTED TO 'PRESS A KEY TO CONTINUE...'. ONCE AGAIN,  YOU  MAY  PRESS
<ESC>  TO  ABORT AND RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU.  OTHERWISE, CATSEND WILL
GO INTO RECEIVE MODE, AND WILL WAIT UNTIL  A  HANDSHAKE  IS  RECEIVED.
NEXT,  CATSEND  WILL  RECEIVE  THE  FILE  NAME,  NUMBER OF BLOCKS, AND
FINALLY THE PROGRAM ITSELF. AFTER ALL THE FILES  HAVE  BEEN  RECEIVED,
THE PAGER WILL SOUND, THE CARRIER WILL TURN OFF, THE HANDSET WILL PICK
UP, AND YOU WILL BE RETURNED TO THE MAIN MENU JUST AS IN [S]END MODE. 

[C]ATALOG  DISK:  THIS  WILL CATALOG WHATEVER DRIVE IS CURRENTLY 'ON'.
THE FIRST FEW FILES WILL  BE  DISPLAYED,  THEN  IT  WILL  WAIT  FOR  A
KEYPRESS. PRESSING <RETURN> HERE WILL TERMINATE THE CATALOG, WHILE ANY
OTHER KEY WILL CONTINUE IT. 

[F]ORMAT  DISK:  THIS  WILL  FORMAT  THE  DISK  IN  WHATEVER  DRIVE IS
CURRENTLY 'ON'. IT WILL FREE UP TRACKS 1-2, AND WILL INSTALL  A  'THIS
DISK HAS NO DOS' MESSAGE ON TRACK 0, SECTOR 0. 

[T]OGGLE  DRIVE: THIS DECIDES WHICH DRIVE IS 'ON', AND TOGGLES BETWEEN
DRIVES ONE AND TWO. BE CERTAIN THAT YOU DO NOT  TRY  TO  SELECT  FILES
FROM ONE DISK, AND THEN [T]OGGLE DRIVE AND CHOOSE FILES FROM THE OTHER
DISK!!! 

[P]ICKUP  HANDSET: PICKS UP THE LINE AND ENABLES THE HANDSET FOR VOICE
MODE. THE HANDSET WILL AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF WHEN ENTERING EITHER [S]
OR [R] MODES. 

[H]ANGUP HANDSET:  HANGS  UP  THE  LINE  AND  TURNS  OFF  THE  HANDSET
COMPLETELY. 

[A]DD A FILE: THIS IS WHERE YOU CHOOSE THE FILES YOU WISH TO TRANSFER.
YOU  WILL  BE PROMPTED WITH 'FILE ->'. HERE, YOU HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS.
EITHER YOU CAN TYPE IN THE NAME OF THE FILE AND HIT RETURN,  IN  WHICH
CASE IT WILL MAKE SURE THERE REALLY IS A FILE BY THAT NAME, OR YOU CAN
PRESS <ESC> TO EXIT [A]DD MODE AND RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU, OR YOU CAN
PRESS  <RETURN>,  WHICH  WILL  CATALOG  THE  DISK.  AGAIN, <RETURN> TO
TERMINATE THE CATALOG OR ANY OTHER KEY TO  CONTINUE.  AFTER  YOU  HAVE
CHOSEN  ALL  THE FILES YOU WISH TO SEND, PRESS <ESC> TO GO BACK TO THE
MAIN MENU. (YOU CAN GO BACK  AND  ADD  MORE  FILES  ANYTIME  PRIOR  TO
[S]ENDING THEM.)

[N]EW SLOT FOR CAT: YOU MAY ENTER A NUMBER FROM 1 TO 7. 

[Z]ERO  ALL  FILES:  THIS WILL CLEAR A BEEN ADDED SO FAR. THUS, IF YOU
ADDED SOME FILES, AND THEN DECIDED THAT YOU WANTED TO  SEND  SOMETHING
ELSE, YOU WOULD [Z]ERO THE FILES AND START OVER. 

[V]IEW  SELECTED  FILES:  THIS  DISPLAYS  THE  FILES  YOU  HAVE CHOSEN
ALREADY. 


                       -- -- -- -- --


DOS ERRORS: IF AN ERROR OCCURRS WHILE A DOS COMMAND IS BEING EXECUTED,
AN ALERT WILL SOUND AND THE DOS ERROR NUMBER WILL BE  DISPLAYED.  LOOK
AT ANY DOS MANUAL TO FIND OUT WHAT ERROR THE NUMBER REPRESENTS. 


                       -- -- -- -- --


DURING THE TRANSFER: WHILE SENDING OR RECEIVING FILES, YOU MAY LOOK AT
EITHER  THE  [T]EXT  OR [G]RAPHICS SCREEN. SIMPLY TYPE 'T' FOR TEXT OR
'G' FOR GRAPHICS, AND AFTER CATSEND HAS FINISHED SENDING/RECEIVING THE
CURRENT BLOCK, IT WILL FLIP THE DISPLAY TO THE  PROPER  SCREEN.  AFTER
CATSEND  READS/WRITES  ONE PASS, AND GOES ON TO THE NEXT, IT WILL FLIP
TO THE TEXT SCREEN TO LET YOU SEE HOW IT'S DOING. 


                       -- -- -- -- --


AND THAT'S IT! WE HOPE YOU ENJOY USING CATSEND 202, AND THAT YOU  FIND
IT  USEFUL.  IF  YOU  HAVE  ANY  IDEAS  CONCERNING  LATER REVISIONS OF
CATSEND, PLEASE CONTACT  EITHER  THE  WOMBAT  OR  THE  GONIF  VIA  THE
