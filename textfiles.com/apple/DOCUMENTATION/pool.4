                            JOURNAL ENTRIES
 
   These entries include items which the adventurers might copy or file
in their journal as they travel. During the game these entries are
referred to by number. When the game refers to a journal entry read the
specific entry and place a checkmark in the margin to keep track of
which entries have come up in the game. Do not read ahead to other
journal entries; some entries are false and may lead your adventurers
astray.
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 1:
   A loud voice coming from a magic mouth cast on a stone tablet.
   "I am Yarash the Sorcerer!
   "Be known that for every living giant insect you return to
Sorcerer's Island I will pay a generous bounty, including a weapon
empowered by magic. I will pay for giant insects such as thri-kreen,
giant mantis, and anhkheg. The insects may be bound by magic but dead
insects are of no use to me.
   "Bring any bodies to the northern river mouth on Lake Kuto. Call the
name of 'Yarash' loudly three times and I shall come. Do not call
unless you have something for me. I shall be very angry if I am
disturbed without cause!
   "I am Yarash the Sorcerer!"
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 2:
   Told in a painful whisper.
   "I never liked pain. Let me go an I'll tell ya of the kobold
treasure horde. We attacked a gold shipment once -- we took it by
surprise. Thirty times my weight in gold pieces were taken. We knew if
we were raided we'd lose the stuff in the treasure room. So we hid it
behind a secret door in the warrens -- that's where we keep the
womenfolk. They tossed me in here ta die, so it don't do no harm to
tell ye. Find it and good riddance."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 3:
   An old leather-bound book, written with a small, firm hand.
   "The hordes came again last night. Their coordination was
frightening. Under the cover of darkness, goblins and kobolds pushed
bundles of sticks to within bow range. These bundles formed a wall that
protected the small ones from our archers. Once the wall was erected
orc archers took up safe positions there and begin pelting the castle
walls with arrows.
   "We tried shooting flaming arrows at the wall of sticks to set it
afire. Monsters are normally afraid of fire. But these monsters showed
no fear. They simply scooped dirt on the flames to put them out. Before
all the fires were out they had resumed firing at us. Surely, some
unnatural force must have been at work to weld these quarlsome beasts
into an organized fighting force.
   "I do not know if we can combat the monsters onslaught much longer.
We lost 12 more men last night. The monsters seem to have an unlimited
number of reinforcements. The Last Priest of Tyr, Ferran Martinez, says
he has a way to protect the keep, but he says that it's so terrible
that it may only be used as a last resort. Unless we receive
reinforcements shortly, Ferran Martinez is our only hope."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 4:
   A roughly drawn cloth map.
 
                     Mountains
 
      Target                        Mountains
                     Mountains
 
      Hills                           Hills

      Grass Land       Forest     Sorcerers    Forest
                                    Isle
 
                                        River
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 5:
   A small piece of parchment folded into the spine of a family's holy
book.
   "The family treasures are buried in the tunnels beneath Kuto's Well.
Climb down the well and search for a secret passage. In the passage
there is a dangerous trap. Search the walls until you find the lever to
disarm the trap. Then proceed through the passage into an adjacent
chamber. The treasures are buried in the southwest corner."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 6:
   A quickly scratched note.
   "Show the Boss's Seal to the thri-kreen guards. Be careful, they are
wary of outsiders. Keep your hands away from your weapons no matter
what they do.
   "With the seal you should gain safe passage in to see the Queen. She
will give you the artifacts in exchange for the seal and the treaty. Do
not do anything to get her mad, the bugs would just as soon kill you as
look at you. Once you have the artifacts, get out of the stinking
burrow and get back to the castle."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 7:
   A tightly bound scroll, seemingly immune to the ravages of time.
   "Fountains and pools hold great power that can only be reached by
performing proper ceremonies. Most sure of these is immersion, for in
this way the bather surrenders himself to the spirit of the water. That
spirit, or some portion of it, enters into the bather, whereby he gains
great powers. Woe to the weak willed whose spirits are sure to be
consumed by spirits that put even the strong at great risk. Yurax holds
that the Falls of Ixce are greatest of all these. Morden writes that
the Pool of Radiance is greater still."
   Later in the book.
   "Places of magical power are not necessarily tied to one physical
location. Power often moves from plane to plane along the path of least
resistance. The termination of the path determines the place's location
on this plane. Volatile upheavals between the planes may lead to a
change in the path of least resistance. This can change where the path
terminates on this plane, thus moving the place of power.
   "Some who wield strong supernatural forces can bend the path like an
engineer damming a river. When the path is bent, it can terminate in a
new location, moving the place of power on this plane. If the
supernatural force that bent the path is removed, the path will snap
back to its original form and the place of power will return to its
original location. Such disruption can have violent and unpredictable
results.
   "Thus, inter-planar upheavals and directed supernatural forces may
hold the answer to the seemingly ever-changing location of places of
power, such as the Pool of Radiance."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 8:
   A rugged popular account of the northern lands.
   "Ten days ride north of the Varm is a barren and dead country called
the Leewai, land-in-pain or land-of-caused-pain. Further to the south
this place is known as the Tortured Land. It is said to be an evil
place, shunned by the Riders. They speak little of this land. But,
yearly, during Ches, they make a trip into its heart. There they go to
praise the spirit of a glowing spring. This they have done for ages and
so shall they do for years to come."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 9:
   Several pieces of paper with highly organized writing.
   Fact: Joran Alberach is a special envoy, from Zhentil Keep, to the
City Council of New Phlan.
   Strong Rumor: Here to negotiate a military assistance agreement
between Zhentil Keep and New Phlan.
   Rumor: Zhentil Keep wants an ancient powerful artifact in return for
their military cooperation.
   Rumor: The New Phlan City Council has such an artifact that was
found in the ruins of a recently reclaimed building.
   Vague Rumor: Joran Alberach wants the artifacts for himself, not for
the rulers of Zhentil Keep.
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 10:
   A crude map scratched onto an old piece of parchment.

   JOURNAL ENTRY 11:
   A mangled page of fine paper with entries written in a very find
hand.
   "He is livid about the undead coming out of Valhingen Graveyard.
Three times he has sent assault groups, three times none have returned.
He dares not send any of the priests of Bane to clear the graveyard. He
assumes that if a priest could wrest control of the undead from their
current master, that the priest would then become a threat to His
power.
   "I suggested that if we could neutralize the power that leads the
undead, that we could then use the undead as a tool.
   He thought on this and then ordered me to find out who or what is in
control in Valhingen Graveyard. Preliminary investigation shows that
the graveyard is controlled by a being of great power, perhaps a
vampire or a demon. I shall expend a few scouts and low level priests
to find out more information."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 12:
   Message scratch into the wall over the pool.
   Beware the power of the pool.
   Death to those unworthy of the gifts of the pool.
   Power to those who will use the gifts of the pool wisely.
   Bathe in the pool if you dare.
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 13:
   A flowery note written on stationary emblazoned with the symbol of
the City Council of New Phlan.
   "With the artifact and agreement in this pouch we have made our
final concessions to your demands. We have given you everything you
have asked for. This should settle our differences and cement our
alliance.
   "Now that we have delivered our part of the bargain we will expect
you to uphold your end. Use this protected pouch and our
representatives to deliver your part of the bargain to the city
council. Remember to include all of the magical items we agreed upon.
   "With the buried riches in the reclaimed Phlan, and the might of
Zhentil Keep we will be able to control all of the northern shows of
the Moonsea."
   Signed
   Porphyrys Cadorna
   City Council
   New Phlan
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 14:
   Several pieces of paper with highly organized writing.
   Fact: Porphyrys Cadorna is the last known surviving member of the
Cadorna Clan.
   Strong Rumor: rising star in city politics and on the City Council.
   Rumor: very charming, has many admirers, but no known mate.
   Rumor: vindictive, likes to get his own way and remembers when he is
(in his mind) double crossed.
   Fact: has contacted thieves to have them gain him information on the
Pool of Radiance.
   Fact: has hired a number of mercenaries through the thieves (we
received our normal cut).
   Vague Rumor: is using mercenaries to find Pool of Radiance.

   JOURNAL ENTRY 16:
   Told in a proud, haughty voice.
   "I am a princess of a tribe of nomads to the northwest. My father is
an old fool. He wanted me to marry King Al Rasid, to cement an
alliance. I had more important things to do, than be tied down to an
aging monarch. When I marry, it shall be to someone who has the same
taste of adventure and the same skill with a sword.
   "Well, Father was insistent and his subjects supported him, so I
left to seek my fortune. Kobolds has been raiding our tents upon
occasion, so I headed this way. If I could end the threat, then I'd
have more leverage with my tribe. However, two nights ago, I was
ambushed by these worms -- knocked out and bound up. I finally got
myself untied a little while ago and was working my way out of these
caves, when you showed up."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 17:
   A quick note on an often used piece of paper.
   "I must find some hardy allies in case this monster from Phlan sends
his troops to attack my island. I need a small, intelligent party who
can move through the civilized areas without notice, but who have the
skill to traverse the uncivilized areas and the wilderness. I must
watch the next groups to come to the lake and see if any would make
proper allies."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 18:
   A ratty piece of parchment with large writing on one side.
   "Hold the Sokal Keep on Thorn Island at all costs. If attacked,
sacrifice your troops as necessary to hold out until relieved.
   "In your deployment set two squads of hobgoblins to patrol Thorn
Island at all times. At least 2 squads of archers are to be deployed on
the walls at all times. Let the pack of wardogs loose to cover the
island several times a day at random intervals. Set pairs of kobolds as
observers in hidden locations around the island.
   If Thorn Island is invaded immediately dispatch a message back to
the castle. We will send over however many reinforcements are necessary
to hold the island."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 19:
   A black bound tome written in a strange halting hand.
   "...and settled foremost in the hall of Minor Courtiers were the
lesser powers: Maram of the Great Spear; Haask, Voice of Hargut;
Tyranthraxus the Flamed One; Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud; and
Camnod the Unseen. These too fell down and became servants of the great
lord Bane."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 20:
   Told in a pained voice.
   "We just got the cut through to the beastie's fair when I injured my
leg. King decided there wasn't much use fer me anymore. Made me a
proposition though. Said if I went into the lair and brought out the
treasure, he'd feed me till I stopped breathin'. Best deal I had, so
they tossed me down here. Not bein' a fool, I lit out for the deepest
hidey-hole. Thankfully the beastie was asleep. I can still move real
quiet when I must.
   "Anyway, if there hasn't been much of an alarm, then drunken Ferd
must be on watch at the rock. He's the king's son, so he ain't here
with me -- worthless sot. If he's there, he's got less brains than a
fermented rat, just act officious and he'll take ya ta the king.
Wouldn't mind hearin' of that tyrant's demise. Ya seem just the types
ta do it too."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 21:
   A crumbling old book; one of a massive series.
   "At this time there ruling the Twisted Ones was a powerful general
named Tyranthraxus. He strode before his armies cloaked in flame and
led the Riders out of the Waste. At his hand the kingdom of Barze was
conquered. Turning south he led his army to conquer the Horreb and the
Vane. Tyranthraxus was a cruel man and leveled all that he had taken,
murdering the princes of these lands. But the flame that surrounded him
consumed him, destroying his body. Freed of its shell, it flew among
the men of his army, lighting on each and claiming it. It was then when
Baron Schodt imprisoned Tyranthraxus in a vial of water which shone
like the light of day. This he sank in the watery depths of Lake
Longreach, defeating the armies Tyranthraxus had raised."

   JOURNAL ENTRY 23:
   Several pieces of paper with highly organized writing.
   Fact: Ulrich Eberhard is old, hard headed in every sense of the
word, leader of the initial expedition to retake Phlan.
   Strong Rumor: unfaithful to his wife, but she knows, though he
doesn't know she knows.
   Rumor: hates monsters, with a passion; would kill every last one
before surrendering.
   Vague Rumor: angry attitude is a cover; he is actually paid by The
'Boss.
   Rumor: opposes rise of Porphyrys Cadorna as a, "Young upstart who
doesn't respect his elders!"
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 24:
   A piece of old, expensive paper written in a dried brown fluid.
   "Cursed is the child Porphyrys. He who was visited by the spirit of
fire in his cradle. He who burned his nursemaid, and he who called the
armies of the night down from the mountains.
   "Possessed is the one called Porphyrys. When the spirit of evil is
in him you can see the fire in his eyes. When he is possessed, the
ground trembles with his power and the nearby plants wither as if
exposed to a great heat.
   "None of the servants will go near the child any more. I think he
should have been drowned at birth. But his mother is blind to his
possession. She guards him like a tigress protecting a kitten. I think
he has ensorcered her.
   "For now we have no choice. We will evacuate the city by ship on the
morrow. And the accursed child shall come along. I swear that he smiles
every time there is an explosion, or anytime you hear a man scream.
Saints preserve us all from this demon child."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 25:
   An official-looking notice.
   "The number of undead creeping out of the Valhingen Graveyard is
increasing. These undead have disrupted training, destroyed property,
and killed many of our troops. Patrols have been sent into the
graveyard to reconnoiter and determine the source of the undead. None
have returned. Under your responsibilities as a priest of Bane in the
city, you must help combat the menace.
   "Lead a group of acolytes into the graveyard with the purpose of
discovering the source and leader of the undead. If your group can
engage and defeat the leader, or destroy the source, do so. If your
group is outmatched, return with your information so that we can form
an assault group with clerics and troops. Upon completion of this
mission you will be in line for promotion to the next higher rank in
the hierarchy of the temple of Bane in Phlan."

   JOURNAL ENTRY 26:
   A small bound book.
   "I have charted this maze as closely as I can. My way is blocked by
both stone and mystic death traps. Yarash must have used his magic to
escape this place. I can find no other way out.
   "Yarash has been breeding creatures for increased ferocity. Most of
his experiments fail. Few live long enough to mature. None that mature
have yet bred true. The bodies of his failures are often used as food
for his newer creations.
   "I do not know when Yarash intends to do when he completes his
hideous experiments. But I must assume that he will turn his
abominations loose on the world. To these creatures Yarash will be
their creator, perhaps even their god! The idea of Yarash as a god to
anyone sickens me. I must find a way to stop him."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 27:
   An impressive announcement.
   "BOUNTY of 10,000 GOLD!
   "I will pay 10,000 gold pieces for a live sahuagin! I will pay 1,000
gold pieces for a recently dead sahuagin in good condition. I need a
specimen of this man-like salt water aquatic creature for my studies.
   "Bring your specimen to the shore of Lake Kuto and build a fire as a
signal. Your specimen will be examined. If it i truly a sahuagin you
could end up with 10,000 gold pieces. But beware, I will know any
forgeries, and I will punish any attempt at deception.

   JOURNAL ENTRY 30:
   Carefully prepared notes.
   Note 1: "Tyranthraxus is definitely a produce of immersion in the
Pool of Radiance. His extraordinary brilliance, vigor, charisma, and
power of command must be a direct result of exposure to the effects of
the Pool."
   Note 2: "The Pool of Radiance may grant special magical abilities.
Tyranthraxus exhibits a fiery aura, obviously magical. He also seems to
have extraordinary means of obtaining information. Special magical
powers granted by the pool would explain both the aura and the extra
information gathering capability."
   Note 3. "Tyranthraxus tells stories about moving down from the
north. Though he never mentions the Pool, I gather that it is northwest
of the Dragonspine Mountains. Strangely, he occasionally lets slip that
he is never far from the Pool, but that must be a parenthetical
reference."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 31:
   Told in quiet, hissing speech.
   "Thank you for saving my children from the Mutilator Yarash. In
return I will aid you in what way I can, though that may not be great.
   "I have lost much of my following to young Drythh who listens to the
false promises of Tyranthraxus... that if he brings troops to invade
Phlan, he will rule the riverbanks.
   "So, Drythh and his followers have been proving themselves in raids
upon the kobold caves to the southwest and the hobgoblin caves to the
south.
   "For some time my followers have been disappearing. But, when you
freed my children from the clutches of the evil Yarash my status was
increased. Drythh kept quiet for a time, but once again the young
warriors listen to him and not to me."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 32:
   An announcement on rugged paper written in large clear symbols.
   "Be it announced that Mace, the former cleric of our lord Bane, is
hereby ejected from the church. His crimes include refusal to follow
temple dictates, unauthorized performance of major miracles, and the
great heresy of placing other gods above our almighty lord Bane.
   "All loyal followers of lord Bane must report Mace's presence on
sight. He is to be captured, brought before a loyal tribunal for fair
and just judgment, and then burned at the stake."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 33:
   An official looking notice.
   Yarash,
   "The time has come for you to add your power to the growing legions
of my followers. Come and supplicant yourself to me and I will reward
you as an important officer in my magical forces. You will serve as the
advisor to the cohort of soldiers to be based at Sorcerer's Island.
Resist and you shall be crushed before my almight power. I expect your
positive reply within the week."
   Signed,
   The Boss
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 34:
   Told in a triumphant tone.
   "You have no understanding of the subtlety of Tyranthraxus and his
allies. Here you have trusted me enough to let your guard down. Now you
are my prisoners.
   "My kobold's friends deserve some reward for their help. Therefore,
you are to be taken to their pit. There, unarmed, you shall fight
'Bersheera, my pet serpent. He should be hungry now, merchants don't
satisfy him for long."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 35:
   Told in halting speech.
   "Thank you for freeing us: Yarash has been experimenting on our
people, changing them in horrible ways. Every night we carry off
another lizard man with his chest burst open or his head mangled.
Yarash say he make us like Sa-Hag-An. He always say that he make us

   "We were not allowed to speak when Yarash was around. These marks
were passed down to us and remind us of home. They represent the friend
word used between lizard men of different tribes. If you meet lizard
men on the outside, this word may help you."
   The lizard men carefully scratches marks into the dirt. You
recognize the marks as two runes and a path symbol.
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 36:
   Carefully prepared notes.
   Note 4: "He has fooled me. All this time he has called himself
Tyranthraxus the Flamed One. He exhibited his flame, and spoke of deeds
attributed to Tyranthraxus. But today, while he did not know I was
around, he revealed his true identity. He spoke into the great pool in
his lair. I think he spoke to Lord Bane himself. And he referred to
himself as Maram. Maram, he of the great spear, is also a servant of
Bane.
   "Why should my leader use a false name? He hides his identity from
the world, so that they do not research his past and discover his
weaknesses. What if he also hides his identity from his closest
advisors, so that they also cannot know his true abilities and
weaknesses. Anyone who attacked him, thinking to utilize the weaknesses
of Tyranthraxus, would be destroyed by the different powers of Maram of
the Great Spear.
   "My research into Tyranthraxus is now useless. I must scour my
records for details concerning Maram of the Great Spear. I have much
work to do."

   JOURNAL ENTRY 38:
   Several pieces of paper with highly organized writing.
   Fact: Werner Von Urslingen is a retired captain turned business man.
   Strong Rumor: mostly interested in the military aspects of the
reconquest of Phlan.
   Rumor: fought in a mercenary unit hired by The Boss early in his
career.
   Rumor: hates Zhentarim because he fought in a unit against them
several times.
   Rumor: has strong contacts with other mercenaries and some ruffians
in town; none of our information confirm such contact.
   Vague Rumor: Von Urslingen's unit was wiped out by enemy magic
users; he was the only survivor; he retired and now secretly hates
magic users.
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 39:
   A preserved parchment covered with giant script.
   "I am writing to you to describe my further inquiries into the
legend of the Pool of Radiance. It seems the pool has moved several
times. Long ago, at least one wise wizard actually moved the pool into
his abode for a period of time to study it. However, the pool seems to
return to its original location after every move. I am now watching the
dry hole that is the pool's natural location. When it returns I will be
ready. I truly believe that the Pool of Radiance is the key to the
secret wisdom that I seek."
   Yours in wisdom

   JOURNAL ENTRY 43:
   A loosely wrapped scroll.
   "Armalg-the-Good, paladin and brother of Taimalg-the-Invincible, and
Sarasim of Teshwave, the high priestess of Sune, attacked the denziens
of the Valhingen Graveyard with a holy vengeance. They came in search
of Taimalg and his mercenary band, who assaulted the graveyard and did
not return.
   "Sarasim used her holy power to dissipate and turn the undead that
confronted them. Aramalg wielded his vorpal sword and slew the few that
fought her power.
   "Together, Aramalg and Sarasim penetrated the graveyard to an evil
marble crypt. They found and splintered an empty coffin, blessing the
remains and sprinkling it with holy water. Then they confronted the
owner of the coffin, a creature of great evil and the leader of the
undead in Valhingen, an ancient vampire. The three began a furious
melee.
   "The vampire was swayed by Aramalg and Sarasim's power, but would
not be turned. The vampire shouted, 'I have defeated Taimalg and his
warriors, I will defeat the brother of Taimalg as well!'
   "The vampire summoned an army of rats and tried to charm Sarasim to
his side, but to no avail. Sarasim resisted his charm and Aramalg
charged through the massed vermin. The vampire fell before the might
blows of Aramalg's holy sword and Sarasim's enchanted mace.
   "Defeated, the ancient vampire dissolved into gas and fled to his
coffin. Finding the coffin destroyed he returned to solid form and
screamed. Seizing the moment Aramalg grabbed the vampire and held him
with all of his strength. Sarasim ran up and drove an oaken stake
through the vampire's heart.
   "Aramalg and Sarasim performed the proper rituals to banish the
vampire forever. Then, wounded, Aramalg and Sarasim left Valhingen
Graveyard. It was beyond their power to completely cleanse the evil
place, but they had extracted proper vengeance for the death of Tiamalg
and his troops."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 44:
   A cleanly written note on standard paper found on the body of a dead
trader.
   Aleram,
   "Hello my good friend. I hope you and your brood are well. I am
tired; tired of trekking through unspeakable swamps and over
unclimbable mountains to take my meager wares to ungrateful customers.
   "Only one event has saved this year's sales. I found a castle full
of happy folk, who were very good customers. They were starved for
goods and news from the outside world. And well they should be, their
castle was in the middle of a small forest, and the forest was in the
middle of a swamp!
   "These people seemed to know nothing of recent events. They still
spoke of Phlan as if it were in its full flower. And they paid in old
Phlanian Gold Soverigns, double the weight of the newer gold coins!
   "Though they were out of date, they were very friendly and
prosperous. I saw more than one gem glitter in the sun, and several
swords showed a flash that made me think they were magic. If you are
willing to dodge the vermin of the swamp I would add this castle to
your trading route. Speed to your horse, strength to your arm, and
skill to your trading."
   Your Friend,
   Burach
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 45:
   Told in perfect, stylized common.
   "Generations ago, flesh things were fewer and we hard-shelled beings
ruled the shores of Lazara, what flesh things call the Moonsea. We
gathered much gold and platinum, plus many gems for decoration and to
appease our own gods. We are quite adept at finding such trinkets as we
make our home by burrowing with our own mandibles. We know the earth
like none other can.
   "When flesh things began to multiply, we did not look on them as
intelligent. They could not decipher our glorious language of sounds
and movement and we could not fathom intelligent communication limited
to their feeble squeaks and grunts.
    As we assumed the flesh creatures were unintelligent we looked on
them as slow, soft, weak, but tasty, prey. But the prey soon came
riding swift beasts, and so were no longer slow. Then they came in
metal shells, and so were no longer soft. And then they came hurling
balls of fire and clouds of stink, and so were no longer weak. Our gods
told us that the flesh creatures would multiply and that our only hope
was to retreat.
   "We retreated underground, into caverns by our own mandibles. We
only venture to the surface to guard our lands and to find food less
powerful than yourselves. We have kept the location of our nest secret
for many generations.
   "But now you have come. You have defeated our warriors, evaded our
traps. We admit your power. We have nothing further to gain by combat.
If you will leave us in peace you may take the gold and gems that were
sacred to our gods, we have been abandoned by them. If you will not
leave us in peace then we must fight to the last. What is your
decision?"
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 46:
   Told as jaunty, after dinner conversation.
   "This is an old story that I first heard while serving at the
Citadel of The Raven. Dirg was the usual barbarian hero -- the type
able to snap five men's backs with his bare hands, wrestle and tame the
cloud horses, pierce a man with a javelin from many miles away, and
other equally preposterous things.
   "The story goes that Dirg and his band of men found a pool of
unfrozen water while wandering in the snowy wastes. Dirg's little pet
lizard Jezma got too close to the pool and discovered that not only was
the water not frozen, it was boiling hot; so hot that it cooked the
skin right off of Jezma.
   "Dirg was so angered he thrust his spear into the pool and roiled
the waters. The demon of fire that inhabited the pool was disturbed and
roared out of the pool to do battle. The demon leapt from man to man,
comsuming them in a single touch.
   "But the demon of fire could not defeat Dirg. Neither could Dirg
find a weapon strong enough to withstand the creature's fire. After
battling for an entire day, Dirg finally called upon his totem god for
aid. With this magical aid, Dirg was able to trap the flaming demon in
a triangle of power where supposedly he is even to this day."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 47:
   A small wrinkled parchment with roughly scratched notes.
   "Hobgoblins transferred out of Valjevo Castle. Now replaced by
giants and trolls. Sounds very tough.
   "Stojanow Gate guarded by bugbears and ettins. Heard ettins didn't
like light. Must be charmed or controlled. Sounds tough!
   "Some smugglers sneak supplies through Stojanow Gate to The Boss.
Must check it out.
   "Overheard hobgoblins say a dragon scared them into leaving a nice
lair in the mountains out east. Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of
creeps."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 48:
   Several pieces of paper with highly organized writing.
   Strong Rumor: The Boss is a dragon or is a human who can take the
form of a dragon.
   Vague Rumor: The Boss is a metallic dragon. Not considered likely as
metallic dragons are 'good'.
   Fact: The Boss holds audiences in Valjevo Castle. Castle is guarded
by groups of big stupid monsters, with occasional smart human leaders.
   Rumor: The Boss doesn't spend full time at Valjevo Castle.
   Fact: maze inside castle wall; passwords are needed to get past
castle gates.
   Rumor: The Boss has been sending out messengers to the tribes of
monsters in the area to recruit new units.
   Vague Rumor: The Boss is recruiting new units in preparation for an
assault to retake the civilized sections of Phlan."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 49:
   A letter on clean white paper in a strong hand.
   To:
   The Boss
   Valjevo Castle, Phlan
   Sir,
   "I categorically reject your demand that I submit my island and my
powers to your control. I am a free man and I will remain free. No
petty tyrant can order about a true mage.
   "If you or your troops make any move toward Sorcerer's Island I
shall send an army of my unstoppable aquatic creations down the Barren
River and sink your precious castle. Until now you have been beneath my
notice. If you value your empire, let us keep it that way."
   Signed
   Yarash, the Sorcerer
