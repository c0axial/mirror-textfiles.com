      Semi-Complete Documentation for the following aspects of GEOS:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GEOS is for the Apple //e, //c and //gs and the Laser 128.

Chapter 1
~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have downloaded, pirated, or otherwise illegally gotten ahold of
this fine program, you may wish to make backup copies for yourself (or a
friend).

Program requirements:

Enhanced //e (//c) with 128k and double hi-res with at least two drives and
although a mouse is not required it is strongly recommended.

Along with the program and the docs that came with the original of the program
came a IQR interupt card which if you do not have a mouse re-routes the signals
that were suppose to be going to the mouse to the joystick or the keyboard.
This is not required, but there will be schemes for anyone wishing to build one
out of 15 bux of (good ole) Radio Shack parts.

Boot the boot disk after it says 'OK' in a box press 'return' to continue.  If
you wish to install the boot on a hard drive hit 'h' a few times right after you
press return and follow the instructions there.  If not it will automatically
load then.  It will cycle thru the drives to find the on-line volumes and then
the desktop will appear.  Once this happens and you get a little arrow, use the
U,i,o,j,k,l,n,m',' to move the arrows.  You must hold down the open apple key at
the same time.  Insert the Drivers disk into the second drive and hit closed
apple - a,b,c, or d to select which letter represents the drivers disk.  Once is
done loading the catalog track there will appear 6 icons of drivers for
printers, etc...  Move the arrow to the OPTIONS and use the 'k' to click that
box, a menu will appear and you can move the arrow down to the INPUT DEVICE and
select the device you wish to use.

Once this has been done things get much easier. Repeat the procedure, but now
for the printer, interface, Clock, aux drivers.  Then after you have that done.
In order for GEOS to load your configuration up when ever you boot the program,
you must have the drivers that you selected on the boot disk.  You will need to
copy those driver files to the boot disk. Refer to Copy Files.

SYSTEM disk
~~~~~~~~~~~

When GEOS is booted it looks for the following things: Drivers on the boot disk
or the SYSTEM disk or directory.  If you have installed GEOS on your hard drive,
you will need to create a folder or (directory) named SYSTEM for GEOS.  Select
the drive you wish to have the SYSTEM folder by moving the pointer over the disk
icons and clicking the chosen one.  Click the FOLDER menu or press closed apple
- U and you will be prompted for a name.  In upper case type SYSTEM and press
return.  Once you have done this, you may wish to copy the following files into
it:

Desktop, drivers (your selected ones) merge, Geopaint etc.  This will be your
work or SYSTEM folder where GEOS will go to upon booting.  Once you have done
this you will be all set up to run the programs and begin your using of GEOS and
the other utilities.    Refer to Copy Files later in the file.

VIEWing modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the view menu or press closed apple G and click the following commands

:

by size  (apple S)  Sorts items in dir by size, largest item first
by type  (apple T)  Groups items by file type
by date  (apple Y)  Sorts item by date of last modification
by name  (apple N)  Sorts items alphabetically

Copying files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select source disk by clicking icon or hitting closed apple a,b,c, or d.  Then
click file icon once and then a second later again.  Drag the ghost icon
(trasparent) down to the bottom of the screen and click again.  It will do a few
disk accesses and then the icon will re-appear down at the bottom.  After you
have done this for all the files you wish to copy on that page or until the
thing is full select the destination disk and click the icon on the bottom of
the screen and drag it up to the work space and click again.  It will copy the
file.  Repeat

process for other files.

Group Icons:

if you wish to copy more than one icon onto a different disk select the iconsby
hitting closed apple and then the numbers 1-6 which rep the icons on the work
space.  After you have highlighted all the files you wish to by copied or dump

ed or whatever click any of the highlighted icons and then a group ghost icon
will appear. This icon reps all the icons (or files) you have selected.

Launching ProDOS files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to do this you must copy GEOLOAD.system as the first file on the disk
that you wish to load and run a prodos sys file.  After this file PRODOS should
be placed.



Having big problems???
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Why not call Berkeley Softworks and ask them what to do, but sound intellegent.
I have been having problems with launching ProDos files. (415)/644-3414  9 am
and 5 pm Pacific time.
