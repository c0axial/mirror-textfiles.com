THE WORD PROCESSOR
------------------

Creating a New Document
-----------------------

To create a new document simply start up GraphicWriter and you're ready to begin
typing. If you're already into a document, then save the changes (if you wish
to), then CLOSE the window and go up to the File menu and select "New Document".
This brings up a new, "Untitled" window, just the same as if you boot-up from
scratch. A blinking cursor awaits your keystrokes. The blinking cursor advances
along as you type indicating the eventual position of the next typed character.
As you are typing the pointer changes from an arrow to what we call an I-Beam.
By moving the mouse you can select where you would like the blinking cursor to
be positioned and inserted within your document. You can maneuver this I-Beam
Pointer between characters, click the mouse button and a new position of the
blinking cursor will be obtained. From there you can begin typing in new
characters, or BACKSPACING out characters on the left.

Highlighting Text
-----------------

The key to using the Word Processor centers around HIGHLIGHTING TEXT. By
"HIGHLIGHTING" we really mean "SELECTING". Thus, to process words, you need to
tell GraphicWriter which WORDS you want to PROCESS and HOW you would like this
done. Position the cursor next to the word(s) you wish to highlight, click and
hold down the mouse button while DRAGGING the POINTER across them. Highlighted
words become blackened.

Processing Highlighted Text
---------------------------

When some text has been highlighted (selected), you can perform various
operations on it. Examples would be choosing a different FONT from the Font
menu, or a different SIZE from the Style menu, or any combination of them. Just
the text that was highlighted will be changed. As your document grows, you can
even highlight multiple paragraphs (by dragging across them) and "operate" on
the entire sum of highlighted text.

Other Ways To Highlight Text
----------------------------

There are a few other ways to highlight text besides dragging the pointer over
it. DOUBLE-CLICKING ON A WORD will highlight that particular word. It doesn't
matter which character of the word the pointer is on when you double-click, the
whole word will become highlighted allowing you to choose a new font or style
(or color) just for this word.

SHIFT-CLICK (holding down the SHIFT key while clicking) will highlight ALL OF
THE TEXT BETWEEN the current position of the "blinking" edit cursor and the
position of the click. For example, suppose the "blinking" cursor is located at
the Beginning of a sentence. If you where to position the I-Beam pointer at the
END of the sentence and do a SHIFT-CLICK, then ALL OF THE WORDS OF THE SENTENCE
will become highlighted. Inn this way, multiple paragraphs, or even an ENTIRE
DOCUMENT (through the use of "scrolling") can be highlighted and operated upon.

CUT-COPY-PASTE
--------------

The Edit Menu
-------------

The Edit menu offers some "tools" that you can use while working with a
document. It will allow you to take characters or words in your document and Cut
them out, Copy them, or Paste the Copy back into your document. These are used
so often that they have keystroke equivalents for them: OPEN APPLE-X to Cut,
OPEN APPLE-C to Copy, and OPEN APPLE-V to Paste.

Removing Text
-------------

It is very easy to REMOVE text from a document. All you have to do is highlight
the desired text, then press the BACKSPACE key. Another way is to highlight the
text and just start typing. The first keystroke will eliminate the highlighted
text before inserting the newly typed characters. The text will be removed
permanently. (However, if "Undo" is active on the Edit menu, you may select it
to cancel the last activity.)

Cutting Text
------------

A more sophisticated way to remove the text is to highlight the desired section
and then Cut it from the document.

The Clipboard
-------------

When you Cut out some text, it isn't gone forever. It goes into the Clipboard.
This "stores" the text in memory for future use (replacing whatever text was
there before it). You can always review the contents of the Clipboard by
selecting "Show Clipboard" from the Edit menu. The Clipboard window can be moved
about the screen by dragging the window by it's top "black" part. You can put
this Clipboard window away by clicking in it's Close Box or by selecting "Hide
Clipboard" from the edit when presented (or by clicking directly on the title of
your document).

Copying Text
------------

Another function you can employ while text is highlighted is to make a Copy of
it. By selecting "Copy" from the Edit menu, the highlighted text will also be
moved into the Clipboard, but this time the highlighted text will NOT be taken
away from the document.

Therefore, the only difference between Cut and Copy is that Cut removes the text
from the body of the document. They both will "save" the text on the clipboard.
Using the BACKSPACE key or just typing when text is highlighted will, of course,
remove the text WITHOUT placing it onto the Clipboard.

Pasting Text
------------

When the Clipboard has some text in it, either by Cut or Copy, you can then take
it's CONTENTS, and Paste it anywhere back INTO your document. To do this,
position the I-beam pointer and click the mouse button at the desired STARTING
location so that the edit cursor is "blinking" there. The pasted text will be
INSERTED into the document beginning at this point upon selecting "paste" from
the Edit menu. you might notice that the new text is placed into the document
while retaining it's original font, size, color, and style.

It should also be pointed out that if any text is highlighted when selecting
"Paste", then the highlighted text will be eliminated before the new text is
inserted. This is exactly like removing the highlighted text by first hitting
the BACKSPACE key just prior to Pasting.

RULER SETTINGS
--------------

The RULER is used as a "measuring stick". Although it is displayed across the
top of your document, it is only IMAGINARY in that it will NOT appear when you
print your final document. It simply serves as a "guide" for FORMATTING your
documents. By selecting various SETTINGS, the text can be "molded" or confined
within certain boundaries dictated by left and right margins, or it can be
forced into certain positions on a line by using what's called TAB MARKS.

Rulers VS. Paragraphs
---------------------

A Ruler is always related to a specific PARAGRAPH. There is only one Ruler per
paragraph and each paragraph will contain a Ruler. A paragraph is simply defined
as a body of words or sentences that ENDS with a carriage return. When you are
typing, as soon as you press the RETURN key, the paragraph ends and a new one
begins. A new Ruler is automatically created for this new paragraph and will
conveniently be an exact "copy" of the same Ruler from the previous paragraph
just finished.

Since each paragraph has a Ruler, you can actually have SEPARATE Ruler settings
for your paragraphs. A Ruler is set for a particular paragraph WITHOUT effecting
any other paragraphs. The rule to remember:THE RULER YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN WILL
ALWAYS BE RELATED TO THE PARAGRAPH THE "BLINKING" CURSOR IS LOCATED IN AT THE
TIME.

Formatting A Document
---------------------

There are 4 possible ALIGNMENTS: Left, Right, Centered, and Fully Justified, as
found under the Format menu. Select the type of justification and begin typing.
The new text entered will then appear in the chosen ALIGNMENT. Or, for
previously typed text, you can highlight the text (actually, any characters in
the paragraph) and then select the justification. Multiple paragraphs can be
highlighted, in the usual manner, and then justified all at once. LEFT JUSTIFY
positions all the test, for each given line, at the LEFT SIDE of the document.
RIGHT JUSTIFY forces each line to end exactly on the RIGHT SIDE of the document.
CENTER JUSTIFY places the text an EQUAL distance between the LEFT and RIGHT
MARGINS. FULL JUSTIFY is a type of alignment where the test is both LEFT AND
RIGHT JUSTIFIED at the same time. If the words of the sentence do not add up to
a full line across the page, the GraphicWriter adds spaces between the words in
such a way until all of the words fit evenly on that same line.

Left And Right Margins
----------------------

The left and right sides of a document are called MARGINS. The RIGHT MARGIN can
be set so that typing will never go past a specific mark.

Paragraph Indentation
---------------------

The INDENTATION MARK, at the LEFT SIDE of the Ruler, signifies where the FIRST
WORD of a paragraph will be positioned. As you type, and the sentence "wraps", a
new line will begin at the LEFT MARGIN MARK. The INDENTATION MARK can be moved
by placing the pointer on it and dragging it to a new setting.

Single & Double Line Spacing
----------------------------

The body of text of a document can also be formatted with Single or Double Line
Spacing. Selecting "Double Spacing" from the Format menu will insert a BLANK
LINE between every line. Re-selecting "Single Spacing" will remove the added
lines. Note that the chosen Spacing will affect the ENTIRE document.

Tab Markers
-----------

A TAB MARK is used to designate WHERE you want the cursor to go when you hit the
TAB key. These MARKERS, when placed on the Ruler, will "force" the text to be
positioned on the screen. When a TAB MARK setting is changed, the text will
ADJUST to specific locations, as called for by the MARKS.

There are 3 types of TABS: Left; Center and Decimal, as found under the Format
menu. They can be selected using OPEN APPLE-1, 2 or 3, respectively. They can be
used individually or in COMBINATION. You may select up to a total of 6 for each
paragraph.

Left Tabs
---------

When you select "Set Left Tab", a new mark will appear on the Ruler. To change
this MARK, position the pointer on it and DRAG it to a new location. This will
act upon the text in that paragraph only.

You can place multiple Left Tabs on the Ruler. For example, if a second Left Tab
is placed at the 3 inch MARK, the edit cursor will move to the 3 inch MARK when
you hit the TAB key again. In this way you can control where the edit cursor
will move, but more importantly, you can begin to dictate where the typing will
occur on the document window. This process is very important when it comes to
designing the desired document.

Center Tabs
-----------

A Center Tab can be placed in a similar manner and cause the text, after
pressing the TAB key, to be CENTERED as you begin typing. The position of a
sentence on a line will be determined by it's LENGTH when centered beneath this
MARK.

Decimal Tabs
------------

A Decimal Tab has a "dot" to it's right. This is how you can tell the difference
between a Decimal Tab and the other Tabs. The interesting thing about a Decimal
Tab is that when typing begins, any numerical values will have their DECIMAL
POINTS aligned vertically. This sets up the possibility of creating a
professional report which will show a LIST OF AMOUNTS, such as PRICES or DOLLAR
TOTALS and so forth.

Removing Tabs
-------------

A TAB MARK can be removed at any time by simply dragging it off the Ruler and
letting go of the mouse button.

PAGING
------

Page Numbers
------------

You can type out a very long document without stopping (although you should
always Save your document from time to time for "insurance" against unforeseen
disasters). The Word Processor uses what's called VIRTUAL PAGE which means it
acts as if you had an infinitely long piece of paper fed "forever" through the
program's "typewriter".

As you type, the document will be separated into NUMBERED PAGES. These pages
will simply be the divisions of what the document will look like when printed.
Each PAGE therefore represents ONE PIECE OF PAPER. The PAge Number that you  are
currently typing in will be shown at the lower left corner of the window.

Scroll Bars
-----------

On the right side and along the bottom of the document window are what's called
SCROLL BARS. These allow you to move through a large document rather swiftly, in
order to pin-point the exact Page you would like to edit.

CLicking on the DOWN ARROW moves the contents of the window upward a LINE or two
at a time. Or clicking on the UP ARROW will move the contents downward on the
screen. Holding down the mouse button on an ARROW will act like "consecutive
clicks" and continue moving the contents. You can also SCROLL RIGHT or LEFT by
using the bottom SCROLL BAR which works in a similar fashion. However you will
really only need to do this when your RIGHT MARGIN is set beyond 8 inches. Note
that you can go out to the right up to 15 inches, but you can ONLY print such a
document on the Wide ImageWriter.

The Thumb
---------

The way to move through the document a few "screens" at a time is by dragging
the white rectangle called the THUMB. You might have noticed that when you
clicked on the ARROWS, this THUMB also moved. The THUMB rectangle is positioned
along the SCROLL BAR in the exact PROPORTION of the contents you currently see
with respect to the ENTIRE DOCUMENT. Thus, if the THUMB is at the top of the
SCROLL BAR, then you will know that you are at the very beginning of your
document. If you drag it to the middle of the SCROLL BAR, then release the mouse
button, you'll be at the halfway point of your document, and so forth. Clicking
on the actual gray part of the SCROLL BAR will also advance the contents a few
"screens" at a time. You can reverse the direction of the "scroll" by clicking
on the OTHER SIDE of the THUMB (when the gray appears on that side).

As you drag the THUMB, the Page Number of its position will also be shown (in
its usual place at the bottom left corner). Therefore, you can drag the THUMB
while examining the displayed Page Number in order to "pinpoint" the exact page
you'd like to go to. Note that the actual SIZE of the white rectangle represents
how much memory remains for you document. As you document grows in length, the
THUMB rectangle will shrink.

Page Breaks
-----------

As you are typing a document, you will come to the end of a page (as it would be
printed on paper). At this time a line will be displayed across the screen
indicating the fact. This is known as a PAGE BREAK. What this means is that
during printing, the paper will be fed through the printer to the next sheet.
You can force this to happen at any time by positioning the "blinking" cursor at
the desired place and then selecting "insert Page Break" from the Page menu.
During printing, a form feed will occur exactly at this point, with subsequent
printing continuing on the next sheet of paper.

You can always tell where a Page Break exists by the fact that the screen will
be "empty" between the Break and the bottom of that Page. Of course, you aren't
allowed to type within this area. Upon reaching such a Break during typing, the
cursor will "hop" down to the next Page. However, an inserted Page Break can be
removed by positioning the cursor anywhere within the LAST PARAGRAPH of the Page
and selecting "Remove Page Break" from the Page menu thereby removing the Break
"area" from the document.

Headers And Footers
-------------------

A HEADER, or a FOOTER, is simply a line, or a few lines, that you would like to
have printed at the top or bottom of every page. To create a HEADER or FOOTER
simply type the text and HIGHLIGHT it. Immediately select "Copy as Header" or
"Copy as Footer" from the Page menu. The text will be saved (replacing any
previous ones) and will appear during printing. You can examine a HEADER or
FOOTER by selecting "Show Header" or "Show Footer" from the Page menu in which
case they will appear on the screen. Common usages for HEADERS or FOOTERS
include your company's name and address (or logos and other Graphics drawings as
cover later) which will then become your special Letterhead stationery.

Show Full Page
--------------

Since an entire 8 1/2 by 11 page cannot "fit" onto the screen all at once, there
is an item under the Page menu called "Show Full Page". By selecting this you
will be shown a miniature representation of the current page of your document.

This function is often used to see what your page will look like prior to
printing, especially when it contains numerous graphics drawings or complex
layouts. By examining the Full Page from time to time, you can then create your
document with full assurance it will be taking the form you had originally
planned. Click the "OK" button when done viewing the Full Page window and you
will be returned back to the normal editing mode.

CREATING DOCUMENTS
------------------

Saving Documents
----------------

When you have finished typing your document and are ready to save it to your
disk simply go up to the File menu and select "Save Document" or press OPEN
APPLE-S instead. Upon doing so you will be asked to give your new document a
NAME (For untitled docs). The default name "Untitled" appears at the bottom of
this Save window. Note that it is highlighted. As usual, it can be edited by
simply typing in a name or by clicking the pointer between characters and begin
typing or backspacing.

When ready, click on the "Save" button, or press the RETURN key (the "ring"
around the button means it is the default button), and the document will be
saved. You will then be returned back to your document, Notice that the TITLE of
the window will change from "Untitled" to "XXXX" (the name you enter).

About The Save Window
---------------------

It is important to know some more things about the Save window. At the top you
will be shown the name of the current PATHNAME. The Disk icon will be followed
by a name that indicates the main directory to where you document will be Saved.
You are also given the amount of disk space remaining.

Those items in the window which are grayed mean they do NOT apply to the
activity. Naturally saving your new document with the same name as one already
saved will completely destroy the contents of the original. The Cancel button
when clicked, will simply return you back to your document WITHOUT saving the
document.

Saving To A Folder
------------------

What you are really trying to do when you save a document is to save it INTO A
FOLDER. Thus, you locate the FOLDER you want (clicking on the Up or Down Arrows
to scroll through a large list of them) and then click "open" or press RETURN,
or you may double-click on the folder name. In any case, THIS IS WHERE THE
DOCUMENT WILL BE SAVED.

A Folder icon represents a SUB-DIRECTORY which in itself can hold other files,
and these files can only be found by examining this particular folder. You can
recognize it as a SUB-DIRECTORY since the name includes slashes "/", each one
meaning a "folder within a folder". Again, this will be the FOLDER your document
will be saved in (when you click on Save). When a folder icon is showing, the
"Close" button will become activated. Clicking this will take you back to the
previous FOLDER (if you have ventured a few folders deep).

You can create a brand new folder by typing in a name for it then clicking on
"New Folder". After this is done you would then type in the name for the
document itself and Save it into this new folder.

The "Disk" button is used by first ejecting your disk and inserting another
disk. CLicking "Disk" will then read the new disk for all of it's FOLDERS, and
then you can carry on as explained above.

RETRIEVING DOCUMENTS
--------------------

Closing A Document
------------------

You can put away your document (in order to get to a different document) by
clicking in its CLOSE BOX. If you have been typing before closing your document
and you haven't saved these changes yet, then you will be prompted if you wish
to Save Changes Before CLosing. Clicking "Yes" (or pressing RETURN) will
automatically save the document before putting it away. Clicking "No" will put
the document away WITHOUT saving any changes. "Cancel" will simply return you
back to your document for further editing.

New Documents
-------------

Once the current document is put away and the screen clears, you may select "New
Document" from the File menu which will bring up a blank "Untitled" window, the
same as if you just entered GraphicWriter. Or you can re-open a document which
you have already created and saved prior to this session.

Opening Documents
-----------------

When a document is put away, you can then open a previously saved document by
selecting "open Document" from the File menu. In this case the Open Document
window will appear. Selecting the filename, then clicking the "Open" button (or
pressing RETURN), or double-clicking on the file's name will open the document.
The new window will have the document's name as it's title.

Working With Documents
----------------------

You can then start working with this document in the usual fashion. When
finished, you have the option of Saving an changes and then Closing the window,
or Close it and save it (or not) directly from the prompt window.

Sometimes one might just want to "see" a document, or "copy" some of its text
(or graphics), then close the document and bring up another and paste the copy
into this newly open document. Once you get the hang of it you will find there
are a number of options available for creating and retrieving documents.

OTHER DOCUMENTS
---------------

Save Document AS...
-------------------

You can work with an existing document by bringing it up, typing new data or
making some changes to it and then selecting "Save As..." from the File menu.
This will allow you to save this altered document to a different file(name). In
this way you can make a "copy" of an entire document. The original document
stays intact as the window's title then changes to the new documents name (that
you entered in the Save window). This is how you can create "templates" and
other such files that you would like to have saved aside. Many documents might
actually contain the same "structure", such as "Letterhead" or reports, and by
saving a "copy" you won't have to always create a new document entirely from
scratch.

Save As Text File
-----------------

By selecting "Save As Text" from the File menu you can save just the data you
have typed (no pictures). A TEXT ONLY file will be created which will consist of
just the numbers and letters. The fonts, sizes, styles, and colors are
"Stripped" out. In this way, the data can be moved over to other Apple IIGS
programs. Note that saving as TEXT does NOT eliminate the "Save Changes?" factor
on your current document.

Importing Text Files
--------------------

A document can also be created from TEXT type files. This is the process you can
use to bring into GraphicWriter any documents or TEXT created from other
programs. When you select "Import Text File" from the File menu, another "Open"
type window will be presented allowing you to choose a TEXT file (you may insert
other disks during this "search"_. You then select the TEXT file just like you
were opening a normal document, but this time the DATA from that file will be
inserted into your document. The insertion of the TEXT will occur at the current
point of the "blinking" cursor. Thus, you should first position this cursor and
then select "Import Text File". After the TEXT is inserted, you are welcome to
edit it (cut-copy-paste,etc). You can also just bring up a "New Document" then
import the TEXT. When ready you can Save this new document, or use "Save As..."
to a completely different file for an altered document.

GRAPHICS
--------

The Drawing Tools
-----------------

Each DRAWING TOOL can be selected by simply clicking on its ICON at the bottom
of the screen. The "A.." (for ASCII) is used for what is called TYPING MODE.
Clicking on it (so that the square becomes highlighted) means you can then begin
typing on the document. CLicking on any of the other squares means you will go
into the GRAPHICS MODE.

Next to the "A..." we have the LINE TOOL. After selecting it, the arrow pointer
becomes a CROSS when you drag it up to the middle of the screen. This is also
how you can tell that you are in the DRAWING or GRAPHICS MODE and that you can
NOT type at this time.

To use the LINE TOOL you first click and hold down the mouse button and DRAG the
CROSS about the screen. A LINE will be drawn FROM THE STARTING POINT of where
you FIRST clicked, TO THE ENDING POINT of where the CROSS is when you RELEASE
the mouse button. You can "eyeball" the LINE until it is perfectly straight.

Next to the LINE there are four SHAPE TOOLS:a rectangle, a rounded rectangle, a
triangle, and a circle (or oval). These tools work the same way, that is, you
click and DRAG to draw with them.

The next four FILL SHAPES work exactly the same way, but instead of drawing a
"border", the entire area is filled in.

The hand tool is used for moving pictures about the screen. It works by clicking
ON the picture, holding the mouse button down, and DRAGGING the picture with the
HAND. A ghost picture moves with the HAND and when the mouse button is released,
the picture will move from its original position to the new destination. If not
satisfied with the position, simply drag it again to another place.

The LINE THICKNESS is determined by selecting one of the 5 CROSSES before you
draw. Of course, only the NON-FILL SHAPES are affected by LINE THICKNESS since
the FILL SHAPES are essentially solids.

You click on one of these drawing pointers and then choose the TOOL you wish to
draw with. To understand their differences, let's examine how the thinnest one
can be utilized to create the same effects as the thicker ones. Using the
smallest CROSS pointer, draw a rectangle, then position the pointer just inside
the upper left corner and drag into place a new, internal rectangle. Repeating
this process creates a thicker "border" just as if you used a larger CROSS.
Therefore, as you draw with one of the larger CROSSES, adjacent multiple lines
or "dots" are formed at the same time, thus yielding larger "rectangles".
