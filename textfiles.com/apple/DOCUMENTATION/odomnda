	Here it is again.  You saw the original in the Incider/A+ June 1992 issue, the mouse odometer for the Macintosh.  Now, here's the best, the GS version!  This is a handy dandy NDA that tracks how far your mouse travels.  It measures in pixels, inches, feet, miles, centimeters, meters, and shylars.  Best of all, its freeware.  If you have any comments, please contact me.  I don't care if you call me at 3 in the morning (chances are, I'll probably still be awake, and would welcome the company).

Shylar: A person who uses big long complex words, has no idea what he's talking about, and makes a fool of himself in the process.
