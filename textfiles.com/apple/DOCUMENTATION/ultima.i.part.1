THE ADVENTURE

Hail, Noble One!  Our land is in need of a stalwart hero, one who will
brave perils to horrific to consider. A plague has befallen the Realm, a
scourge is upon the land!  Our villages lie sacked, ruinous mounds of
ashes where once trod peasants stout of heart and sound of mind, where
once lay fields of grain and fruit, where kine and fowl grew fat upon
the bounties of our fair Sosaria.  All manner of wicked and vile
creatures prey upon our people and ravage the land. 'Tis the doing of
one so evil that the Very Earth Trembles at the Mention of his Name.
Mondain the Wizard hath wrought his malice well. Our nobles bicker
amongst themselves, and each hath retired to the confines of his keep in
hopes of watching the downfall of his rivals. Verily, the Evil One hath
heaped indignity upon curse by releasing upon the Realm a host of
creatures and beasts so bloodthirsty and wicked that our defenseless
people fall as grain before the reaper's scythe. These denizens of the
underworld hold sway over all that can be surveyed, save for the
strongholds of the nobles besotted with their own ambition. Nowhere in
our once peaceful country may a traveller find safe passage or lodging,
save in the keeps of the self-proclaimed kings -- and they demand hard
labors for their indulgences. 

Only the young Lord British remains steadfast in the vision of a
peaceful and united Sosaria. In his castle and his towne the pure of
heart will find an ally and replenishment for the needs of one who hath
chosen to fight for the Realm. 

Aid us in ridding our land of the scourge that hath befallen us, O Noble
One.  We beseech thee, for without thine aid we shall surely perish
before the onslaught of the maleficent necromancer. Slay the evil
Mondain! 

FELLOWSHIP

The lands of Sosaria are populated by a diversity of races as varied as
the elements. From the tiniest bobbit to the most towering human, our
folk show a strength of character unknown in other parts of the world.
Until the coming of the foul Mondain, our folk lived in harmony and
worked together in the true spirit of comrade-ship. The principal
inhabitants of Sosaria are: 

HUMAN: 
Endowed with a natural intellact higher than any other race, the humans
are the backbone of Sosarian society. Found in all walks of life, they
are strong of body and of unexcelled spirit. 

ELF: 
Shorter than their human counterparts by the span of three handsm the
elves of Sosaria are slight of build and swift of movement. Their
superior natural agility makes them excellent musicians and clever
thieves. At home amongst the trees of the deepest forest or in the
alleyways of the capital, The Sosarian Elf makes a stalwart companion
and a relentless foe. 

DWARF: 
Mountain folk and legendary miners, the dwarves of Sosaria stand but
half a humans height, yet often outwiegh slender elves. They are
matchless in courage and possess an inordinate endowment of natural
strength. Never accept the Sosarian Dwarf's challenge to wrestle for
drinks in a tavern, unless thy supply of gold be endless and thy
generosity ample. 

BOBBIT: 
A small and gentle race, the Sosarian Bobbits are believed to have come
to our realm from a distant place. They are said to favour mountainside
meadows and the serenity of forest clearings. Their dimunitive height
being even less then that of a dwarf, they shun any task that involves
hard, physical labour, preferring instead the pursuits of study and
contemplation. Bobbits are naturally weak, yet possess a serenity
indicative of profound wisdom. 

PROFESSIONS

Whilst the professions practiced by our folk are numerous, there are but
four courses of action that may be followed by the novice adventurer.
These are: 

FIGHTER: 
The rigorous training involved in learning to become a fighter results
in a stronger, more agile adventurer. The knowledge acquired during this
period permits the fighter to use virtually every kind of weapon that
might be found in Sosaria. 

CLERIC: 
A profession suited to those who are of an introspective nature, the
study of the ways of the cleric requires patience and results in a good
deal of wisdom.  Such is their calm and concentration that at no time
will the proper spell cast by a cleric fail to attain its desired
result. 

WIZARD: 
To become a wizard in our Realm, one must study long and diligently,
poring over ancient writings and dusty tomes. Mastery of the arcane arts
comes not easily, yet such training hones the intellect to a superior
edge!  The fruits of the long years of discipline are deemed to be worth
the effort, however, for only the wizard may purchase the necessary
supplies for the casting of the more powerful enchantments. 

THIEF: 
Whilst not a profession held in the highest esteem among those charged
with maintaining the public order, thieving is a trade that often serves
the adventurer well. Many of the explorer's finds are guarded by clever
and devious traps that require nimble fingers and a dexterous hand.
Larceny and the opening of locks comes much easier for the thief than
for other mortals, for they who follow this occupation are endowed with
exceptional agility. 

CASTLES & TOWNES

Sosaria is a land dotted with the castles of the nobility of the Realm
and with numerous townes wherein the traveller might purchase supplies
and provender.  Townes and castles may be entered freely, but woe to the
one who foolishly is apprehended in an act of thievery, for the public
order is maintained here by burly Guards who fear none. 

Each castle is held by a noble, the King of his particular region. Visit
these local rulers, they have much to offer the adventurer. The castles
are often built of stone and peopled with merchants, courtiers, guards
and adven- uh, fools. Beware of the jesters, for although they amuse,
they may also decieve. 

SHOPPES

The merchant class of Sosaria is the mainstay of the Realm's economy.
All manner of trade goods -- foodstuffs and the handiwork of local
artisans -- can be found in the towne and castle shoppes. An adequate
supply of gold will help to equip the adventurer with everything from
rations to the most esoteric of weapons. Some of the more common
emporiums include: 

ARMOURY: 
The tailors of protective garments await your pleasure in the armouries
of Sosaria. The finest craftsmen in the Realm will swiftly fit out the
adventurer in a suit made of worked leather or metal. Price varies
according to the level of protection offered by the suit of armour. 

WEAPONS: 
The workers of metal in Sosaria know no peer. From a simple carved mace,
reinforced with good iron, to the most exquisitely crafted greatswords
of tempered steel, the weapons found in the shoppes of the Realm are
truly works of art. 'Tis rumored that some of the arms one may find in
the distant reaches of our land surpass belief. 

TRANSPORTATION: 
Whilst one may travel throughout much of the Realm afoot, there are
alternate means of transport that make short journeys pass more quickly,
and longer journeys feasible where once such voyages seemed
unattainable. Common modes of travel include the use of horses and of
sea-going vessels. Uncommon modes of travel (Hmmm!) are also rumored to
exist. 

MAGIC: 
A once-forgotten discipline, the study of magic has enjoyed a
renaissance since the coming of the evil Mondain. Many hold the belief
that sorcery is indeed needed to combat sorcery. The practitioner of the
arcane arts can purchase the needed tools of the trade in various magic
shoppes scattered throughout the Realm. 

FOOD: 
None can live without sustenance. The food shoppes of Sosaria provide
the local populace with fresh produce and meats, while the adventurer
can find provisions therein that will last for weeks in the wilderness
with no special care. 

PUBS: 
The people of our land are not without a certain fondness for strong
spirits and lively companionship. Most settlements are graced with
public houses where a tankard of strong ale from the region of Trinsic
or a flagon of the best Jhelom mead may be had for but a few coins. Many
of the people found in these taverns are quite friendly, and the ones
serving the drinks are often fountains of wisdom and gossip. 

DUNGEONS
Our land is an ancient one, where strange and wondrous beings once
walked the earth and civilizations rose and fell. There are numerous
labyrinths to be found throughout Sosaria, the handiwork of unspeakable
creatures and unknown forces. These mazes have become the dwellings of
many of the horrors unleashed by Mondain upon our poor land. Indeed, the
lowest depths of some of these hellholes contain creatures that make
even the staunchest warriors blanch and tremble. Yet these subterranean
passages also contain caches of the ill-gotten gains of the predations
of Mondain's minions. An intrepid adventurer can finance many an
expedition with the spoils of a careful foray in the dungeons of
Sosaria. Hearken to my words:  The use of extreme caution is needed when
exploring underground. The corridors of the dungeons are lined with the
bones of explorers who overestimated their abilities! 

STARWALKING
Before the archmage Mondain can be defeated, one's mettle will first
have to be tested in the farthest reaches of the heavens. 'Tis said that
the Evil One has formed Alliances with Starwalking Monsters of
Unparalleled Savagery. These malicious creatures stand poised to swoop
down upon our people and devastate them. The need to slay the vile
wizard is doubled in the face of this threat. 

Should a champion emerge from the mists of legend, the means by which to
combat this menace will appear -- so say the prophets. The legends which
foretell of this hero include a number of writings and several ballads
sung by the bards of our Realm. Among the more recent discoveries
pertaing to the coming of the starwalkers is an arcane manuscript, found
on the foothills of M. Drash. Since it appears to hold instructions for
the use [of] some form of transport, it has been broadcast throughtout
the land in hopes that it might prove useful to one engaged in the quest
to rid Sosaria of Mondain. The substance of the document is as follows: 

"In the heavens, each vehicle has the means to control rotation, as well
as thrust and retro (reverse thrust). In the front view mode one can
turn left, right, climb, and dive. 

"The starways are divided into 49 sectors on a 7x7 grid. In the top view
mode one can see all within the current sector. A long range scan may be
obtained by use of the 'Inform' control. Consult the Pilots Reference
Manual for the symbols needed to interpret a scan. 

"One can jump to the next sector in the direction of current travel by
using the Hyperjump capability of the vehicle. 

"Docking with starbases can be attained at any of the unused docking
ports and should be made only at slow speeds while headed directly into
the port opening.  A docking fee is required. Upon docking, a 'Base
Comand' query will be issued and the pilot is expected to indicate the
direction toward the next vehicle that will be used. 

"Reentry takes place when your ship passes over the lands of Sosaria. 

NOTE: 
Only the shuttle craft has heat shields. Any vehicle will incinerate if
it collides with a star. 

"One may encounter and engage in combat with hostile beings in the
heavens.  Once combat has begun, the pilot cannot return to the top view
mode until all enemy craft have been driven from the current sector or
the pilot has chosen to hyperjump to the next sector. 

IMPORTANT: 
Changing from front view mode to top view mode at high speeds will
surely result in a fatal collision. Be wary of fuel levels and shield
condition. A ship without fuel drifts forever and a depleted shield
spells certain death."

Our most learned scholars have translated the document into the common
tongue of the Realm, but certain terms and phrases have no meaning even
to the most erudite sage. Nonetheless, such is our desire to be rid of
the scourge of Mondain that we make this information available to all. 

THE MAGICAL ARTS

As mentioned elsewhere in this manuscript, the practice of magic had
once died out in Sosaria. The power of the mystic tradition proved too
corrupting for the general populace and the lords of the land decreed
that all who dabbled in sorcery were to be banished. 'Twas not until the
coming of Mondain the Wicked that our scholars once again unearthed the
dusty tomes that contained the records of the once flourishing arcane
arts, and set about to retrain adepts in the use of enchantments. Our
leaders realize that once the discipline of magic is reawakened, it
shall never again be put to rest. Such is our plight that even the most
dreaded of the arts is laid bare to all who will try to learn it and who
swear to use its powers to combat the spread of Mondain's vile
influence. 

While those naturally born to the practice of sorcery, who can invent
their own enchantments and forge new ground in the arts, have yet to
emerge as powerful wizards in their own right, a certain progress has
been made. There are four artifacts available to the budding mage which
will enhance the ability to weave enchantments:  Staff, Wand, Amulet,
and Triangle. The latter is a magical sword that may also serve as a
weapon. Several powerful spells, which will cost the buyer in both gold
and experience, may be purchased in the magic shoppes of Sosaria. These
include: 

BLINK: 
The ability to be physically transported a short distance while
underground. 

CREATE: 
The ability to create a wall of magical force directly in front of the
spellcaster. 

DESTROY: 
The ability to remove a wall of magical force that blocks the
spellcaster's path. 

KILL: 
An enchantment hurled at a foe in front of the spellcaster. If
successful, this cantrip will destroy the opponent. 

LADDER DOWN: 
This enchantment creates a magical ladder which permits the spellcaster
to descend to the next level of a dungeon. 

LADDER UP: 
This enchantment creates a magical ladder which permits the spellcaster
to ascend to the next level of a dungeon. 

MAGIC MISSILE: 
The ability to strike a foe with a blast of magical force. The more
skilled and well-equipped the spellcaster, the greater the damage
inflicted by the blast. 

OPEN: 
This spell permits the opening of coffins at no risk to the spellcaster
by magically disarming any traps. 

PRAYER: 
The ability, when in dire straits, to call upon one's personal deity in
hopes of finding a way out of a pressing dilemma. Should be used only
when the spellcaster is in serious need of divine aid. 

UNLOCK: 
This spell permits the opening of chests at no risk to the spellcaster
by magically disarming any traps.
