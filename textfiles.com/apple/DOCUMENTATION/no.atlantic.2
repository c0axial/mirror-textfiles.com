MISSLE RESOLUTION
-----------------

1.PRIOR  TO  ATTACKING A SHIP, THE ANTI SHIP MISSLES MAY BE ENGAGED BY
CAP, SAM'S, LIGHT GUNS, TARGET  DEFENSE.   SAM'S  WILL  NOT  BE  FIRED
AGAINST SURFACE SKIMMING MISSLES.  SAM'S MAY NOT FIRE IF EARLY WARNING
WAS  UNSUCCESSFUL  AND  TARFE  TF  IS  IN PASSIVE EW-MODE.  THERE IS A
CHANCE THAT A SHIPS WILL SWITCH TO  ACTIVE  EW-MODE  DURING  A  MISSLE
ATTACK

2.  MISSLES THAT SURVIVE AAM AND SAM ATTACKS WILL BREAK INTO GROUPS OF
1-7 MISSLES. EACH GROUP WILL SELECT A TARGET

3.   MISSLES THAT SURVIVE DEFENSES MAY BE JAMMED.  JAMMING POSSIBILITY
IS AFFECTED BY THE TARGETS EW RATING AND THE MISSLE RATING

4.  IF A MISSILE SURVIVES THE ABOVE MENACES, IT MAY MISS  OR  HIT  THE
TARGET

ACCURACY RATINGS: 

HARPOON 9*  SS-N-7  7*  SS-N-12 6
TOMAHWK 9*  SS-N-2C 5   SS-N-19 7
EXOCET  9*  SS-N-3  4   AS-6    5*
WALLEYE 7   SS-N-22 7   AS-7    7

* SURFACE SKIMMING

5. THE PROBABILITY OF AND ANTI-SUB MISSLES HITTING THE SUB DEPENDS UPON
THE SUB'S SPEED, THE SUB'S EW RATING AND MISSLE ACCURACY.

ACCURACY RATINGS:

ASROC:   4   FRAS-1:  4   SUBROC:  4
SS-N-16: 4   IKARA:   3   SS-N-14: 3


SURFACE COMBAT
--------------

SURFACE COMBAT MAY OCCUR BETWEE TWO TF'S OCCUPYING THE SAME SPACE WITH
ENDURANCES OF 9 OR MORE

1.  RESOLUTION

A.   EACH  SOVIET SHIP IN TF PERFORMING A "C" MISSION WILL FIRE AT ONE
OF THE NATO SHIPS

B.  EACH NATO SHIP WILL FIRE AT A SOVIET SHIP

C.  EACH NATO SHIP IN A "C" MISSION WILL FIRE

D.  EACH SOVIET SHIP WILL FIRE AT NATO TF

2.  WHEN ATTACKING, EACH SHIP WILL FIRE TORPEDOES MAIN GUNS LIGHT GUNS

ONLY SOVIET SHIPS WITH 533mm TORPEDOES CAN FIRE TORPEDOES  IN  SURFACE
COMBAT


SUBMARINE COMBAT
----------------

1.  SUBMARINES PATROL AN AREA TWO SPACES AWAY FROM THE TF LOCATION

2.   EACH  SUB IN A TF WILL HAVE A CHANCE OF ENGAGING A SUB WITHIN INS
PATROL AREA. THIS CHANCE IS DEPENDENT ON SPEED, SONAR,  AND  EW  MODE.
SUBS  THAT HAVE BEEN DETECTED HAVE THEIR OWN DETECTION CHANCES REDUCED
BY 2/3.  THE CHANCE OF ENGAGING AN ENEMY SUB IS 1/4 THAT  OF  ENGAGING
AN ENEMY SUB

3.  THE CHANCE OF ENGAGING/TORPEDOING WILL BE REDUCED BY THE NUMBER OF
ENEMY ASW SHIPS IN THE ENEMY TF

4.   IN  AN  ATTACK,  A SUB WILL FIRE 2 TORPEDOES.  AFTER EACH ATTACK,
THERE IS A 10% CHANCE OF A SUB RUNNING OUT OF TORPEDOES  IN  WHICH  IT
WIL HAVE TO RETURN TO PORT FOR A RESTOCK. 

5.   AFTER A SUB ATTACKS A TF, THE ASW SHIPS IN THE TF WILL ATTEMPT TO
FIRE BACK. 

6.  RANGE/ACCURACY OF ASW/AST WEAPONS: 


ASROC   20/4     MK 48     50/5
SUBROC  55/4     TIGERFISH 40/4
IKARA   20/3     533mm     20/3
FRAS-1  50/3     400mm      7/4
SS-N-14 50/3     MK46      10/4
SS-N-16 75/4


AIRCRAFT RETURNING TO BASE
--------------------------

1.  AFTER COMPLETION OF MISSION, AIRCRAFT WILL ATTEMPT  TO  RETURN  TO
BASE FROM WHICH THEY CAME

2.   IF  LAUNCHED FROM A CARRIER WHICH RECEIVED 26% OR GREATER DAMAGE,
THE AIRCRAFT WILL TRY TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING ON ANOTHER BASE

3.  EMERGENCY LANDINGS WILL OCCUR AUTOMATICALLY IF THERE IS A FRIENDLY
BASE OR CARRIER WITHIN 3 SPACES

INVINCIBLE, ARK ROYAL: HARRIERS ONLY KIEV, MINSK: FORGERS ONLY

4.  IF AN EMERGENCY LANDING IS REQUIRED AND  THERE  ARE  NO  AVAILABLE
BASES, THE AIRCRAFT WILL DITCH IN THE OCEAN

5.   AIRCRAFT  WHICH  ENGAGE IN CAP, STRIKE, OR TRANSFER MISSIONS WILL
SUFFER 1% LOSES.  TROOPS AND  SUPPLIES  BEING  TRANSPORTED  WILL  ALSO
SUFFER 1% DAMAGE

LAND COMBAT
-----------

LAND  COMBAT  WILL OCCUR WHEN THERE ARE BOTH NATO AND SOVIET TROOPS ON
ICELAND OR FAROES

1.  ORDER OF LAND COMBAT=> DEFENDER FIRES AND THEN SURVIVING ATTACKERS
FIRE

2.  THE GREATER THE ATTACK LEVEL, THE GREATER THE  CASULTIES  ON  BOTH
SIDES.   ATTACKS  MADE  WITHOUT  ADEQUATE  SUPPLIES WILL SUFFER DOUBLE
CASULTIES.  DEFENSIVE FIRE WITHOUT REQUIRED SUPPLIES WILL BE ONLY HALF
AS EFFECTIVE

3.  IF TOTAL COMBAT STRENGTH OF ATTACKER (TCS) IS GREATER THAN THAT OF
THE DEFENDER, THE AIRFIELD IS TAKEN. 

ATTACKING TCS=(INFANTRY COMPANIES+ GROUND ATTACK POINTS)*RANDOM NUMBER

DEFENDING TCS=INFANTRY COMPANIES+ GROUND SUPPORT

4.  AND AIRFIELD  UNDER  HEAVY  FIRE  WILL  NOT  BE  ABLE  TO  CONDUCT
OPERATIONS IN THE FOLLOWING TURN


GROUND SUPPORT AND BOMBARDMENT
------------------------------

LAND COMBAT MAY BE INFLUENCED BY BOMBERS AND BOMBARDING SHIPS

1.   BOMBERS  FLYING GROUND SUPPORT OVER FAROES OR ICELAND WILL ADD TO
LAND COMBAT STRENGTH.  TF'S WITH "B" MISSION WILL ALSO  HELP  IF  THEY
OCCUPY THE FAROES OR ICELAND SQUARE

2.   BATTLESHIP  MAIN  GUNS  ARE  WORTH 3 POINTS EACH.  LIGHT GUNS ARE
WORTH 1/2 POINT EACH.  CRUISER MAIN GUNS ARE WORTH 1 POINT EACH

3.  GROUND SUPPORT POINTS HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECT: 

A.  EACH POINT WILL SUPPRESS ONE INFANTRY COMPANY (USUALLY)

B.  EACH POINT WILL ADD 1/2 POINT OF FRIENDLY FIRE (USUALLY)

4.  AIRCRAFT'S GROUND SUPPORT RATING IS DETERMINED  BY->  ACCURACY  OF
BOMBS, AND RADAR RATINGS (P.M. TURNS ONLY).  DURING A BOMB, EACH " <*>
" MEANS 2 GROUND SUPPORT POINTS HAVE BEEN SCORED. 


REPAIR AND REFIT OF SHIPS
-------------------------

1.   DAMAGED  SHIPS  WHICH  DOCKED  ARE PLACED IN THE REPAIR AND REFIT
PIPELINES.  UNDAMAGED SHIPS WILL BE PLACED IN THE REFIT  PIPELINE.   A
TF  WHICH DOCKS WITH AN ENDURANCE GREATER THAN 50 WILL NOT BE REQUIRED
TO REFIT.  REFIT TIME IS 3 DAYS

2.  REPAIR TIMES IS EQUAL TO:  9 X  DAMAGE  POINTS  SUFFERED.   DAMAGE
POINTS  SUFFERED  IS:  DEFENSE  FACTOR  OR  SHIP  X DAMAGE PERCENTAGE.
REPAIR TIME MAY BE DOUBLED FOR SOME SHIPS WITH SMALLER SHIPS HAVING  A
GRETER CHANCE OF LENGHTNED REPAIR TIME


REINFORCEMENT ARRIVAL
---------------------

SHIPS  WILL  ARRIVE  AS  SCHEDULED IN PIPELINE.  INFANTRY, SUPPLY, AND
AIRCRAFT WILL BE REINFORCED AS FOLLOWS: 
               
                                   S   T   T   A

3.  AMERICA

4.  SCAPA FLOW

1.  EACH TURN (DURING CAMPAIGN GAMES ONLY) THERE IS A 1/16  CHANCE  OF
THESE REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVING

2.   THE  SOVIETS WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE #1 DURING FIRST WEEKS
IN OCTOBER THAN LAST WEEK IN SEPTEMBER. 

3.  THE SOVIETS WILL AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE #1 FOLLOWING  ANY  TURN  IN
WHICH  FENCERS+FLOGGER<100.   WHEN  THIS  HAPPENS,  NATO IS AWARDED 50
VICTORY POINTS

4.  NATO WILL AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE #3 FOLLOWING  ANY  TURN  IN  WHICH
TORNADOS+EAGLES+FALCONS<50.   WHEN  THIS  HAPPENS,  THE SOVIET WILL BE
AWARDED 25 VICTORY POINTS. 

GENERAL OPERATIONS
==================

SHIP DAMAGE
-----------

SHIPS RECEIVE DAMAGE POINTS WHEN THEY ARE  HIT  BY  BOMBS,  TORPEDOES,
MISSLES,  OR  GUNFIRE.   WHEN DAMAGE POINTS ARE GREATER THAN DEFENSIVE
FACTOR, THE SHIP WILL SINK.  WHEN DAMAGE POINTS ARE GREATER  THAN  50%
OF THE DEFENSIVE FACTOR, THE SHIP IS CRIPPLED. 

1.  DAMAGE POINTS CAUSED BY WEAPON: 
               
               LIGHT (AA) GUN:  0.5
               CL MAIN GUN:     1.0
               BB MAIN GUN:     7.0
               TORPEDO:         8.0

               WALLEYE:        12.0
               SS-N-2C:         5.0
               SS-N-3:         12.0
               SS-N-7:          9.0
               SS-N-12:         9.0
               SS-N-19:         8.0
               AS-6:           15.0
               AS-7:            7.0
               SS-N-22:         6.0

2.  ASW/TORPEDO HITS WILL ALWAYS SINK A SUBMARINE

3.  TORPEDO HITS WILL ALWAYS REDUCE A SHIP'S SPEED BY AT LEAST 5 KNOTS

4.   SHIP THAT IS HIT MAY SUFFER ADDITIONAL DAMAGE, HENCE THE MESSAGE,
"EXPLOSION ON BOARD." (THIS INDICATES A CRITICAL HIT)

5.  CRIPPLED SHIPS MAY  ACCRUE  ADDITION  DAMAGE  WHILE  RETURNING  TO
PORT.   IT  IS POSSIBLE FOR A CRIPPLED SHIP TO ATTEPT REPAIRS WHILE AT
SEA.  IT WILL ATTEMPT TO REPAIR ITSELF UNTIL  NO  LONGER  IN  CRITICAL
CONDITION. 

6.   CARRIERS  WITH  26%  OR  GREATER  DAMAGE  MAY  NOT LAUNCH/RECEIVE
AIRCRAFT

7.  U.S.N. CARRIERS WITH DAMAGE  BETWEEN  26%  AND  35%  WILL  ATTEMPT
REPAIRS UNTIL BELOW 26%

TF MISSIONS
-----------

BELOW IS A LIST OF MISSIONS AND ENDURANCE
               
               MISSION              ENDURANCE (TURNS)
               --------------------------------------
               C-COMBAT             60
               B-BOMBARDMENT        60
               T-TRANSPORT          60
               E-EVACUATION         60
               U-SUBMARINE          90
               R-RETURN             N/A

(1 DAY = 2 TURNS)

1. CARRIERS MAY ONLY PERFORM "C"

2. AP,AK,AO,AE,AKR, AND AFS MAY ONLY PERFORM "T"

3. LST,LHA,LPH AND LPD MAY ONLY PERFORM "T" OR "E"

4. SS,SSN, OR SSNG MAY ONLY PERFORM "U"

5. ONLY "E" MAY INITIATE COMBAT

6. SURFACE COMBAT MAY CAUSE A "B" TO ABORT ITS MISSION
   (CAUSING IT TO  BECOME AN "R")

7.   AND  "E"  HAN  DOCKS  AT  FRIENDLY  BASE  WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOAD
INFANTRY INTO ITS LST, LPH, LHA, AND LPD  TYPE  SHIPS.   THESE  LOADED
SHIPS WILL BE CHANGED TO "T"

TF ENDURANCE
------------

1.  EACH TURN AT SEA REDUCES ENDURANCE BY 1

2.   A  BOMBARDMENT TF WILL HAVE ITS ENDURANCE REDUCED BY 10% FOR EACH
TURN WHICH IT BOMBARDS

3.  SURFACE COMBAT HAS THIS EFFECT:  ATTACKING TF ENDURANCE IS REDUCED
TO 7 (IF GREATER THAN 8), IF THE  DEFENDING  TF'S  COMBINED  DEFNESIVE
FACTORS  MULTIPLIED BY RANDOM NUMBER FROM 0-1 IS GREATER THAN 25.  THE
DEFENSIVE ENDURANCE IS REDUCED TO 8 IF  THE  ABOVE  IS  TRUE  FOR  THE
OPPOSITE ROLES. 

4.   IF A TF'S ENDURANCE REACHES 0 AND IT FAILS TO DOCK THAT TURN, ALL
NON-NUCLEAR SHIPS' SPEED WILL BE REDUCED TO 5

5.  SUBMARINES WITH 0 ENDURANCE MAY NOT FIRE TORPEDOES


SUPPLIES
--------

SUPPLIES ARE USED FOR INFANTRY DAILY LIVING, COMBAT, FORMING TF'S, AND
AIR MISSIONS

1.  BASES MUST SPEND DAILY SUPPLIES TO  MAINTAIN  THEIR  TROOPS.   THE
DAILY  REQUIRED AMOUNT IS THE NUMBER OF INFANTRY COMPANIES/100 ROUNDED
UP

2.  SUPPLIES ARE CONSUMED IN LAND COMBAT ATTACKER: 1 SUPPLY PER  LEVEL
DEFENDER: ONE SUPPLY UNIT

3.   THE MAJOR PORTS, AMERICAM RIGA, AND MURMANSK USE SUPPLIES TO FORM
TF'S.  EACH SHIPS REQUIRES 1/5 OF ITS DF

4.  A TF RETURNING TO A BASE WITH AND ENDURANCE GREATER THAN  30  WILL
RETURN ITS UNUSED FUEL TO THE PORT

5.   AITBASES USE ONR UNIT/STRIKE LAUNCHED. CAP/SEARCH/TRANSFER DO NOT
REQUIRE SUPPLIES


SCORING
-------

1.  PLAYES GET VICTORY POINTS (VP) BY SINKING ENEM  SHIPS.   THE  VP'S
EQUAL TO DF+CARGO/AIRCRAFT CAPACITY

2.   NATO  PLAYER  RECEIVES  1  POINT  10  VP'S  FOR EACH MORALE POINT
REMAINING.  (CAMOAIGN SCENARIOS ONLY)

3.  EITHER PLAYED MAY SCORE 500 VP'S FOR  POSSESSIONS  OF  ICELAND  OR
FAROES AT END OF GAME. 

4.  SOVIET PLAYER RECEIVES 1000 VP'S IF NATO MORALE IS 0

5.  VICTORY TABLE: 

SUBTRACT SOVIET FROM NATO POINTS: 

               
                    SCORE           RESULT
               ---------------------------------------
                    1000+           NATO DECISIVE
                 500-999            NATO SUBSTANTIVE
                 100-499            NATO MARGINAL
                (-99)-99            DRAW

FOR SOVIET WIN, JUST CHECK IF IT IS NEGATIVE AND CONSULT ABOVE TABLE


WEATHER
-------

CLEAR, LIGHT OVERCAST, HEAVY OVERCAST, AND STORM

1.   THERE  IS A RANDOM CHANCE EACH TURN THAT THE WEATHER WILL CHANGE.
THE WEATHER ONLY CHANGES IN STEPS OF 1.  THERE ALSO IS A RANDOM CHANCE
A HEAVY OVERCAST WILL BECOME A STORM.  STORMS ARE RARE IN SEPT-OCT AND
MORE FREQUENT IN NOV-DEC. 

2.  WEATHER INFLUENCES THA ABILITY TO SPOT TF'S AT A RANGE OF  GREATER
THAN  1.5.   THE  CHANCE  OF SPOTTING A TF AT GREATER THAN 1.5 WILL BE
REDUCED BY 1/3 DURING LIGHT OVERCAST AND 2/3  DURING  HEAVY  OVERCAST.
STORMS WILL PREVENT ALL AIR AND MISSLE OPERATIONS

3.  DURING STORMS, ALL TF'S WILL HAVE THEIR SPEED REDUCED TO 5 KNOTS

4.  THE LIGHT BLUE AREA A TOP OF SCREEN IS ICEBERG ZONE.  SURFACE TF'S
WILL  HAVE TO MAKE ONE STOP WHILE ENTERING AND ICEBERG, BUT SUBMARINES
ARE UNAFFECTED.  THE ZONE PROGRESSES SOUTHWARD AS THE GAME FOES ON


AIRBASE CAPACITY
----------------

TABLE OF MAXIMUM AIRCRAFT

ICELAND: 80   HAMBURG:  600   RIGA: 900  FAROES:  60
SCAPA FL: 900   USA:  900  BERGEN: 500   MURMANSK: 900



NATO MORALE
-----------

NATO MORALE WILL BE REDUCED BY LONG PERIODS OF INADEQUATE SUPPLY

1.  LEVEL STARTS AT 100 FOR CAMPAIGN ONE OR 40 FOR CAMPAIGN TWO

2.  NATO MORALE WIL BE REDUCED BY ONE FOR EACH TURN SUPPLY'S AT  SCAPE
FLOW ARE LESS THAN 10 OR TROOP LEVEL IS LESS THAN 20000

3.  MORALE POINTS MAY NEVER BE REGAINED. 


REPLACING CARGO SHIPS
---------------------

1.   DURING  THE CAMPAIGN SCENARIOS, ANY AMPHIBIOUS OR CARGO SHIP SINK
WILL BE REPLACED BY A CARGO SHIP WHICH WILL BE  NUMBERED  AND  HAVE  A
CARGO CAPACITY OF 4 AND SPEED OF 20

2.   SUNK  CARGO/AMPHIBIOUS  SHIPS WILL NOT BE LISTED IN THE SUNK SHIP
OPTION, BUT WILL COUNT FOR POINTS


AIRFIELD REPAIR
---------------

REPAIR TAKES 1-3 DAYS AFTER CAPTURE UNTIL OPERATIONAL STATUS


NATO CARRIER EARLY ARRIVAL
--------------------------

IF BETWEEN OCT. 1 AND NOV. 10, THE NATO PLAYER IS REDUCED TO LESS THAN
2 AMERICAN CARRIERS AT SEA OR IN PIPELINE FOR  5  DAYS,  THE  PIPELINE
TIME  OF  CV-KITTY  HAWK  FILL BE REDUCED TO 5 DAYS, GIVING THE SOVIET
PLAYER 50 VP'S. 


GAME DURATION
=============

CAMPAIGN GAMES
--------------

CAMPAIGN ONE: 252 TURNS
CAMPAIGN TWO: 122 TURNS


MINI-GAME DURATION
------------------

QR.44:  12 TURNS
ICELAND: 20 TURNS



SOLITAIRE PLAY
==============

WHEN PLAYING SOLITAIRE, THE COMPUTER WILL COMMAND THE SOVIET FORCES

1.  THERE ARE FOUR LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY.  AT LEVEL 3, THE SOVIETS WILL
PERFORM NORMALLY.  AS THE LEVEL IS DECREASED, THE SOCIET ARRURACY WILL
INCREASE. (BACKWARDS!) THIS LEVEL CAN ALSO BE  USED  IN  A  TWO-PLAYER
GAME

2.  ONE CAN START A SOLITAIRE GAME, SAVE IT, AND RESTART AS TWO-PLAYER

3.   ONE  MAY CHANGE A TWO-PLAYER TO SOLITAIRE IF ALL SOVIET SHIPS ARE
IN-PORT


COMMENTS
========

THESE ARE COMMENTS FROM DIRTY HARRY, NOT FROM THE SSI DOCUMENTATION. 

NORTH ATLANTIC '86 IS A VERY  COMPLICATED  GAME,  EVEN  MORE  SO  THAN
GERMANY  1985,  ON  WHICH  I  HAVE ALSO WRITTEN DOCS.  ONE MUST BECOME
FAMALIAR WITH THE DOCUMENTATION TO THIS GAME BEFORE GIVING ANY  THOUGH
TO  PLAYING.   THE GAME WILL START SLOWLY, BUT SPEED UP AS THE PLAYERS
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  NOTE WELL, THAT YOU WILL BE CLOBBERED
AT FIRST, BUT DON'T WORRY.  NATO: ABANDONING FAROES AND  EVEN  ICELAND
IS NOT ALWAYS BAD
