               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Get all the men to the lower left corner. 

1] Attract all the men to the bottom left corner (you can do this from
the bottom right corner) and collect all the chests. 

2]  If  any chest is picked up by a man, try to get him to drop it for
you toward the bottom middle of the board.

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] As the man starts down the second long ladder from the  left  after
you,  dig the brick to the right of the first short ladder. Get him to
follow you through and exit down the ladder to the left, then back  up
the long ladder. This gets you past the man. 

2]  Get  all the chests in the left section, taking one at a time, and
each time escaping  back  throughthe  brick  left  of  the  top  short
ladder. 

3]  Get  the  chest  in  the  middle  section by shooting holes to the
ladders below the middle short ladder and always escaping back through
your starting point. 

4] Get all the chests in the right section and escape.

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

The only important thing to know about this level is to spend as  much
of  your time as possible on the second row from the top. The men will
bring you many of the chests and you can drop down to the ground level
to pick up others after you've caught all of the men in the pits. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Trap the men in the upper 2 chambers by leading them  over  the  outer
edges.  Then  collect  the  rest  of  the chests being careful you can
always escape via the center ladders. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Follow the man through the traps using him like  an  elevator  to  the
first  chest  on  the  upper  right.  Collec the rest of the chests by
clever digging. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Try to keep the men together. Get the first left chest  in  the  ledge
first. 

1] First, get the first left chest in the ledge, using a man's head to
step on. 

2]  Run to the bottom of the far right ladder on the floor and get all
the men on the ladder to the left of you Go to the top of your  ladder
to force the men to the top of their ladder. Collect as many chests as
you can. 

3]  Use traps between the 2 ladders to get to the bottom of the board,
and run quickly to the far left bottom ladder and climb. 

4] Collect as many chests as you can while keeping the men together on
their ladder. 

5] To keep them together and get past them, wait at the bottom of  the
far  left  bottom  ladder,  drawing them over and, at the last second,
climb up and run for their ladder. The men will return to their ladder
from below, but too late to interfere with you. 

6] Collect the rest of the chests by repeating step 5.

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Trap a man in the brick at  the  bottom  right  of  the  long  left
ladder.  Use  this  ladder to force the man left when he climbs out of
the hole - he'll then fall into the chamber allowing you  to  get  the
chest in the center of the chamber. 

2]  Get the chest in the rabbit's left nostril, while you lead the men
behind you. 

3] Collect the rest of the chests.

1] Lure the man into the left center pit, but don't  get  stuck  there
yourself. 

2]  Dig a column between first 2 rows of short ladders on the right to
get the right bottom chest. 

3] Repeat step 2 on the left side. Dig the brick left  of  the  bottom
left  chest.  If  you  move to the short ladder across from it the man
will get the chest and when the  brick  refills,  he'll  be  destroyed
along
   with the chest.

1]  Destroy  the  men  repeatedly  until they trap themselves in the 3
single holes across the top. 

2] Collect the rest of the chests, leaving the bottom left  chest  for
last. 

3]  When  you  get the last chest, the men will be released. To escape
through the ladder that appears, run over the men's heads,  from  left
to right to short right ladder on the 4th floor.

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1]  Dig  the  4  bricks  to the right of the 4th ladder from the left,
using timed digging as done in previous levels, to get  to  the  chest
beneath. 

2] To get to the first chest on the right, start digging at the top of
the  top right ladder. Dig your way to the chest, leaving an exit path
out to the left of the bricks to the right of the 4th ladder from  the
right. 

3]  Work  you way to the left side of the board by exiting through the
brick to the left of the short middle ladder. 

4] Use timed digging on the bricks to the right of the far left ladder
to get to the first left chest. 

5] Dig the 3 bricks down the left side of  the  8th  ladder  from  the
left.  Dig  down  to  the brick over the 7th ladder from the left. Run
back up the ladder, drop down on the brick to  the  left  of  the  9th
ladder from the left, dig it and get the chest and exit by digging the
brick under it and dropping to the floor. 

6] Work your way back to the left side of the board. 

7]  SURPRISE!  The  man trapped in the lower left chamber has a chest!
You must release him and then trap him in order to get the chest  from
him.

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Stack  the  men  on  top  of  each  other in the left and right ledges
(second floor from the bottom) so that the top  man  can  get  at  the
seemingly  unreachable  gold  chests  on  the  left  and  right  sides
Repetitive digging is required. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Collect the left chest by  descending  then  centermost  of  the  4
ladders  that reach the top of the screen.  Then dig away the brick to
the left of the ladder's base. Drop in that hole and  descend  to  the
ladder  beneath  it, digging the 2 bricks to the left of the ladder as
you descend. Then move left and dig away the brick immediately to  the
right  of  the  gold  chest.  Race  back  up the ladders until you are
standing just above and to the left of the first  brick  you  dug.  Go
left  and  drop  straight down onto the gold chest.  Climb back to the
top of the board before the bricks fill in. 

2] The 2nd gold chest is easy to get to however, getting back  to  the
tope of the board is difficult since there's only one way. You'll have
to  travel  the  bottom bar to the leftmost ladder, climb up, and then
work your way back to the right by digging in order to get out. 

P.S. The ladder that appears at the far right after  you  collect  the
second gold chest is a red herring. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

You  must  use  timed digging on the row of bricks to the right of the
2nd ladder from the left. 

1] Dig the top brick, pause, dig the 2nd brick, pause  until  the  top
brick  reappears,  then  dig the 3rd brick.  Now run to the top of the
ladder and all the way to the right. Dig and drop down onto the  chest
that is floating in the air, then run left until you have regained the
safety of the ladder. 

2]  Don't  stop  for breath. Before the 3rd brick fill in, dig out the
4th.  Then go back up the ladder and dig out the 1st  and  2nd  bricks
again.   Descend  and dig out the 5th brick from the top. When the 4th
brick reappears, dig out the 3rd and the 6th brick. Run right  (across
the  top  of  the 4th brick) and dig out the brick just over the short
ladder.  Then back up one brick and dig out another brick.  Jump  down
in  the  hole  and,  standing on the ladder, dig out the 2 bricks that
form a wall to the left of the ladder. Then drop  down  to  the  chest
below  the short ladder and run left. The floating chest is left up to
you. 

3] Your exit is at the bottom of the bottom of the long ladder.  There
are  2 clever parts to the right side. In the top part, you'll need to
stand on the head of a falling man to pick up the leftmost chests. The
most difficult part is the bottom.

Use timed digging, first to reach the top chest (digging bricks in the
order A,B,C,D,E) then starting over and getting the bottom chest  (Dig
A,B,C,D,E,F  and  G).  Run  up  and  over  brick  A,  which  will have
reappeared. Then drop down through brick D and dig H, I and J).

1] Get the top 2 men to fall into the  2  trap  doors  (marked  T)  by
dropping to point A when a guard is at point B.  Then you can clear up
the left side of the board in peace. 

2]  Be  sure  to pick up chest C by by following the 2 guards you have
trapped and running over their heads back to the middle  ladder.  Then
dig  your  way  to the right part of the board by blasting through the
bricks to the right of point A and immedia- tely  cutting  through  to
chest D. 

3]  Dig  your way to the short ladder marked E and descend it to bring
the last free man toward you and trap him in the hole to  your  right.
Now  clean up al the remaining chests on the board except for chests F
and G. 

4] You can get to chest F and G by digging the brick to  the  left  of
the  2 men stuck in the trap doors and jumping in the hole (the second
brick down is also a trap door so you'll be able to walk out of it  to
chest  F).  Pick up chest G and run over the other 2 men's heads until
you're back on top of ladder E. 

5] If the pit to the right of ladder  E  hasn't  been  filled  with  a
ladder,  then  one  of  the  2  men at the bottom is carrying a chest.
You'll have to kill them to fill the pit and free yourself. You can do
this by digging the block to the left of ladder E, staying at the  top
of the ladder until the brick is about to fill in, and then descending
to draw the guards toward you.

1]  Move  to  the  left and get the 4 men trapped into holes. Run over
their heads and go to the ladder on the left. 

2] Dig down to the 1st 4 chests at the bottom left rows. 

3] Next, position yourself just to the right of the rightmost man. Dig
the 2 bricks to the right of him, work- ing right to left (you'll have
to dig the 2nd brick while standing on his head). Take one step to the
left as you finish digging the 2nd brick so you won't  fall  when  the
man starts to move. 

4]  After  he  drops into the hole in the next row, jump in after him,
run to the right, and repeat the process as you proceed to collect the
top and then the bottom chests on the diagonal.

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Begin by digging at the bottom of the board to kill the  men.  Keep
doing that till they fall through the 4 traps at the top of the screen
into the holes. 

2] Fall on the man's head, get the chests, dig and release the man and
continue recovering the chests (same technique as level 47).

               #######

This  level  makes  extensive  use  of a little known capability-it is
possible to blast bricks in the normal manner while standing inside  a
trap door. 

1] Dig brick A and jump in. You'll fall into the trap door below brick
A.   Wait  for brick A to reappear, then dig brick B, exit left to the
ladder and cross over to brick C, where you repeat the  process.  Once
bricks  B  and  D  have  been removed, you can enter the central room,
recover the chest and dig down to the rooms underneath. 

2] Many of the other bricks in this level play off the same  trick-you
stand inside a trap door and dig an adjacent brick.

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] If you've gotten this far, you're a pretty good Lode Runner player,
so you're going to have to figure out this level with the help of just
one minor clue... 

Here's  the  hint.  Just  as level 49 hinged on being able to dig from
within a trap door, level 50 hinges on  your  ability  to  dig  bricks
while falling on the head of a man. 

Good luck!
