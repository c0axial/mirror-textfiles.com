The Goal:
=-=-=-=-=
The goal is for one or two adventurers to survive the perils of the dungeon
while collecting valuables and destroying evil creatures.  Each level is
determined by your health score, which will go up and down as you progress thru
the levels.

The Villains:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Scattered throughout the depths of the dungeon you will find Monster Generators.
Creatures spew forth from these generators at regular intervals.  Each generator
creates a specific type of villain.  There are three generator levels, creating
monsters from merely strong to awesomely deadly.  You can destroy the generators
by shooting them or, for the tougher heroes, by pounding them into rubble or by
using magic.

The monsters come in three levels of toughness (except death, more on him
later).  A level one ghost will take one hit to destroy, while a level three
demon will take three hits to destroy.

Ghosts: Stay away from ghosts.  They will only hit once then disappear.  That
one hit can hurt a lot, so shoot them don't run into them.

Grunts: Grunts will immediately move up and attack you with their clubs.  Either
fight them hand to hand or shoot them from the distance.

Demons: Demons will shoot fire balls at you from the distance, and they will
bite fiercely when they get in range.  The fireballs are far more harmful than
their bite.  Fight them hand to hand or shoot them.

Lobbers: Lobbers attack by throwing rocks over the tops of dungeon walls.  They
run away so if you intend to fight them you have to corner them.

Sorcerers: Sorcerers can disappear while moving.  They will attack evasively by
flickering in and out of sight.  They are immune to attack when invisible.
Fight them hand to hand or shoot them.

Death: The Dark Prince drains health from you.  He will steal up to 200 points
from you and then die.  Death cannot be killed by any weapon except magic.

Dungeons:
=-=-=-=-=
The dungeons are filled with a variety of objects...some good some evil.  You
should collect the good ones and avoid the evil ones.  Here are a few pointers
to help you tell the difference.

Potions: Poisons grant magical powers to those who know how to use them.  When a
potion is collected and used, all the monsters on the screen will be affected by
the proportion to the magical power of the hero wielding the potion.  Some
potions.  Some potions can be activated by a shot, but the effect is not as
great.

Special Potions: These are just like regular potions when they are shot, but if
they are collected, they give special bonuses to the player.

Food:  Plates of cold food increase both your health and your score by 100
points.

Cider: Cider is the same as food, except it can be destroyed by a careless shot.

Poison: Looks a lot like cider, but it takes one special power and 100 points of
health when consumed.

Keys: Score 100 points for collecting each key.  Keys are used to open doors.

Treasure: Treasure chests are worth 100 points each.

Amulet: A magical device that confers invisibility for a short time.

Walls: Most walls are impenetrable, but some of the older ones can be crumbled
by multiple shot.

Traps: Glowing floor patterns that make some walls disappear

Transporters: These powerful devices transport you to the nearest visible
transporter.  If there are several within the same distance then one is chosen
at random.  There are ways to influence the direction of travel if you can find
them.

Exits:  These labeled holes lead down to specified level.  If you do nothing for
30 seconds, then all walls will disappear, freeing all monsters.  After another
30 seconds (if you avoid and combat) the walls turn into exits.

When you use an exit, there is a chance that you will end up in a treasure room.
Collect all the valuables you can and escape within the time limit for bonus
points.  No score will be awarded if you do not escape.

In general, players are immune to each others shots, but in some portions of the
dungeon, they may be stunned or injured by careless fellow adventures.
