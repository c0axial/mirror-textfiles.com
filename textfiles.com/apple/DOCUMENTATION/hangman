HANGMAN
By: Carl Steadman

You are sure to recognize this clasic pen and paper favorite.  The object is to complete the word by picking the correct letters before hanging your man.  Each incorrect letter chosen will cause one body part to appear on the screen.  You have seven guesses before your man is doomed beyond hope.

[ESC] will return you to the startup screen, where you may exit to UpTime or continue the game.

CTRL-S toggles sound on and off.

Note: There is occasion when the rare ?FORMULA TOO COMPLEX error will pop up.  If this should happen just reboot the machine.  The reason it happens is ?FAR TOO COMPLEX to explain.
