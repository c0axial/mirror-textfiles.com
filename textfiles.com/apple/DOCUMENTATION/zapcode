        |                     Introducing ZAPCODE                      |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        What is ZAPCODE?

        ----------------

 

        ZAPCODE, simply put, is a printer control utility. With it, you

        can send control codes to your printer to activate or deactivate

        any of its options and features. Pop-up ZAPCODE at any time to,

        for example, reset your printer, turn on condensed print, or

        advance the page. ZAPCODE can also be used to automatically

        enter printer codes into your word processor, spreadsheet, or

        any other program. This is great for word processors that don't

        support all of your printer's features but allow you to embed

        printer control codes inside your documents. Simply pop-up

        ZAPCODE, select the desired printer option(s), and then let

        ZAPCODE enter the printer codes for you, just as if you had

        typed them at the keyboard. ZAPCODE can even be used to print

        envelopes, as a dialing directory, and even as a crude keyboard

        macro program. ZAPCODE is ideal for all types of printers

        including dot-matrix, laser, and even plotters. Additional

        features include:

 

        o  Stand-alone running for those times when memory residency

           might not be disirable.

 

        o  Support for any parallel printer attached to LPT1 to LPT3,

           and any serial printer attached to COM1 to COM4.

 

        o  Completely customizable printer drivers. You can easily

           modify the included printer drivers to suit any desired

           configuration, or even create your own.

 

        o  Memory resident activation over most applications, including

           those graphics-based.

 

        o  Customizable window colors and activation hotkey.

 

        o  Capability of multiple installations for those systems which

           require support for more than one printer.

 

        o  Uninstallation of memory resident copies for those times when

           the extra RAM is needeed.

        ZAPCODE Files

        -------------

 

        ZAPCODE consists of the following files:

 

           ZAPCODE.COM   -  ZAPCODE program

           ZAPCODE.DOC   -  ZAPCODE program documentation

           INVOICE.DOC   -  Invoice for permanent license

           ASP.DOC       -  Association of Shareware Professionals Info.

           EPSFX.PMF     -  Printer driver: Epson FX Series

           HPLJ.PMF      -  Printer driver: Hewlett Packard LaserJet

           IBMCOLOR.PMF  -  Printer driver: IBM Color Printer

           IBMPRO.PMF    -  Printer driver: IBM Proprinter

           TSHP341.PMF   -  Printer driver: Toshiba P321SL/P341SL

           TSHP351C.PMF  -  Printer driver: Toshiba P351C Color Printer

 

        All printer drivers end in the extension "PMF" (Printer Make

        File). Printer drivers have been included for some of the more

        popular printers. If your printer is not yet supported, you can

        easily build your own driver or customize one of the given. This

        will be covered shortly in the section "Using The PMF Editor".

 

        System Requirements

        -------------------

 

        To use ZAPCODE you need:

 

        o  IBM PC, XT, AT, PS/2, or compatible computer

 

        o  A parallel or serial printer

 

        o  PC-DOS or MS-DOS version 2.0 or later

 

        You'll also need at least 64K available memory to use ZAPCODE in

        stand-alone mode. 128K is required to use the PMF Editor. When

        installed in memory, ZAPCODE uses approximately 17K. However,

        depending on the size of the printer driver, an additional 10K

        is usually needed.

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

        |                      Purchasing ZAPCODE                      |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        ZAPCODE is distributed under the Shareware marketing system. The

        Shareware concept allows you, the user, to use a program on a

        trial basis to determine if it meets your needs. If you find the

        program useful and wish to continue using it, you are required

        to pay a license or registration fee to the author.

 

        If you recieved ZAPCODE through a distribution service and paid

        a small fee (usually $3 to $5), this does not constitute payment

        for ZAPCODE. You have simply paid for the distribution service.

        The $3.00 or $5.00 or whatever pays for the diskette,

        duplications and handling and does NOT constitute payment for

        the programs contained on the diskette.

 

        ZAPCODE license and registration costs $19.95. The file

        "INVOICE.DOC" contains an invoice which you may print and use

        for this purpose. Registering ZAPCODE gets you:

 

        1. The latest version of ZAPCODE without the Shareware notice.

        2. A professionally printed/bound 33 page manual.

        3. All of the latest printer drivers. We're always creating

           new drivers for more printers. If yours isn't currently

           supported, we'll create it for you FREE. Just mention it to

           us on the invoice.

        4. Six months support plus we'll notify you of any program

           updates and new products.

 

        The Shareware system is dependant upon honest people. If you use

        a Shareware program and have not registered with the author

        after the evaluation period, you are helping to destroy the

        viability of the Shareware concept. If you appreciate the

        ability to try software, before you buy it, then we encourage

        you to register EVERY Shareware program you use. Registration of

        Shareware products ensures the existance of quality, low-cost

        software.

        |                       Running ZAPCODE                        |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        To get ZAPCODE up and running, simply log into the drive and

        directory containing ZAPCODE and type:

 

                                ZAPCODE <Enter>

 

        A window will be displayed containing a list of all printer

        drivers in the current directory. Use the following keys:

 

                UpArrow   -   Move selection bar up one file

                DnArrow   -   Move selection bar down one file

                PgUp      -   Move selection bar up one page

                PgDn      -   Move selection bar down one page

                Home      -   Move selection bar to first file

                End       -   Move selection bar to last file

                Enter     -   Use the selected PMF in stand-alone mode

                I         -   Install the selected PMF in memory

                U         -   Uninstall last PMF installed in memory

                E         -   Edit the selected PMF

                A         -   Add/create a new PMF

                Esc       -   Exit

 

        Use the UpArrow, DnArrow, PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End keys to

        select a PMF.

 

        Press the Enter key to use the selected PMF in stand-alone mode.

        Consequently, ZAPCODE will not be installed in memory.

 

        Press the "I" key to install ZAPCODE and the selected PMF in

        memory. To confirm memory resident installation, a window is

        displayed containing printer setup, program activation, and

        memory information. The default hotkey for ZAPCODE is Ctrl-Alt-Z.

        That means, to activate ZAPCODE, hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys

        and press "Z".

 

        You may install as many copies of ZAPCODE as available memory

        will allow. If you have installed more than one copy and each

        shares the same hotkey, press the hotkey once to activate the

        copy installed last. Press it again to activate the copy

        installed prior to that, and so on.

 

        Press the "U" key to uninstall ZAPCODE from memory. If you have

        installed more than one copy, the last copy installed will be

        uninstalled. Uninstalling again will cause the copy installed

        prior to that one to be uninstalled. If you have loaded other

        memory resident utilities after ZAPCODE, it is possible that

        ZAPCODE will not be able to uninstall itself. When this happens,

        the message "Cannot uninstall" is displayed.

 

        Press the "E" key to edit the selected PMF. The "PMF Editor"

        allows you to easily create and edit printer drivers. See "Using

        The PMF Editor" for instructions.

        Press the "A" key to create a new PMF. A window will be

        displayed prompting for the PMF filename to create. Once you

        enter a filename, the "PMF Editor" is invoked and you can begin

        building your new printer driver.

 

        Command Line Switches

        ---------------------

 

        All of the above functions can be performed by use of command

        line switches. The complete syntax for ZAPCODE is:

 

                     ZAPCODE [filename] [/I] [/U] [/E]

 

        "filename" is the name of the printer make file. It is not

        necessary to type the ".PMF" extension.

 

        /I installs ZAPCODE and the specified PMF in memory.

 

        /U uninstalls the last installed copy of ZAPCODE.

 

        /E invokes the PMF editor. You must also specify the name of the

        PMF you wish to edit. If the PMF does not exist, it will be

        created.

 

        If you wish to have a PMF loaded automatically each time you

        boot up, you may include ZAPCODE as an entry in your

        AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If other memory resident utilities are loaded

        in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and conflictions occur when loading

        ZAPCODE, try different variations in the order each is loaded.

        |                        Using ZAPCODE                         |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        When ZAPCODE is activated, a window is displayed containing the

        printer options. A bar hilights the currently selected option.

        The description window contains a description of the selected

        option. Another window contains a list of keys that can be used

        to control ZAPCODE. They are:

 

                UpArrow     -   Move selection bar up one option

                DnArrow     -   Move selection bar down one option

                PgUp        -   Move selection bar up one page

                PgDn        -   Move selection bar down one page

                Home        -   Move selection bar to first option

                End         -   Move selection bar to last option

                Insert      -   Send the selected option to keyboard

                Enter       -   Send the selected option to printer

                Spacebar    -   Send reset code sequence to printer

                Slash (/)   -   Manually enter codes to send to printer

                Esc         -   Exit ZAPCODE

 

        Use the UpArrow, DnArrow, PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End keys to

        select a printer option.

 

        Press the Insert key to send the control codes for the selected

        option to the keyboard. Use this feature to enter printer codes

        into your word processor, spreadsheet, or any other program.

        ZAPCODE can be configured to enter codes in a variety of formats

        including decimal and hexadecimal. This feature defaults off and

        you must use the "PMF Editor" to activate it. (See "Using The

        PMF Editor" for instructions.) This feature only works when

        ZAPCODE is memory resident. Pressing the Insert key when ZAPCODE

        is stand-alone or when this feature is off causes the speaker

        to beep and has no effect.

 

        Press the Enter key to send the control codes for the selected

        option to the printer. When done, the message "Codes Zapped"

        will be displayed if the operation was successful. If your

        printer is off-line or turned off, an error message will be

        displayed and you will be prompted for necessary action.

 

        Press the Spacebar to send the reset codes to the printer. This

        is a string of control codes used to restore all printer options

        to their power-on defaults. Some printers provide a control code

        for doing just this, while with others, each option must be

        restored individually. If there are no reset codes configured,

        this function has no effect.

        Sending Printer Codes Manually

        ------------------------------

 

        Pressing the Slash (/) key causes a window to be displayed in

        which you may enter codes to send to the printer. The codes may

        be entered in any of three formats:

 

                        Decimal       -   eg. 255

                        Hexadecimal   -   eg. 0FFh

                        ASCII         -   eg. "&k4s"

 

        Codes must be seperated by a comma or a space. Codes entered in

        hexadecimal format must be preceded by a numeric digit and end

        with the character "h". Codes entered in ASCII format must be

        enclosed in quotation marks. AS YOU ENTER CODES, THE WINDOW WILL

        PAD ONCE YOU HAVE REACHED THE RIGHT MARGIN. This allows you to

        enter an unlimited number of codes.

 

                        Example:    27,"&o2e5",0C5h

 

        While entering codes, use the following keys to edit and control

        ZAPCODE:

 

                LeftArrow    -   Move cursor left one character

                RightArrow   -   Move cursor right one character

                Ins          -   Toggle insert/overwrite entry modes

                Del          -   Delete character under cursor

                Backspace    -   Delete character left of cursor

                F1           -   Display syntax help window

                Enter        -   Send entered codes to printer

                Esc          -   Abort

 

        Use the LeftArrow, RightArrow, Insert, Delete, and Backspace

        keys to edit what you have entered. Press F1 to display a window

        containing information about the syntax that must be used while

        entering codes. Press Enter to send the entered codes to the

        printer. Press Esc to abort.

 

        The "Enter Missing Parameter(s)" (EMP) Window

        ---------------------------------------------

 

        Some printer options require that a parameter or parameters be

        entered before they can be activated (eg. Set Tabs). Selecting

        one of these options causes a window to be displayed prompting

        you for the missing parameter(s). This window is identicle to

        the window used for entering codes manually. However, there is

        an additional window containing instructions explaining what is

        expected. Two additional keys are available for scrolling the

        instruction text:

 

                PgUp   -   Display previous page of instructions

                PgDn   -   Display next page of instructions

 

        Once you have entered the necessary parameter(s), the control

        codes for that option along with the missing parameter code(s)

        will be sent to the printer.

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

        |                    Using The PMF Editor                      |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        Using the PMF Editor, you can create and edit PMF's and change

        the following PMF control information:

 

                             Printer Name

                             Printer Port and Setup

                             Printer Reset Codes

                             Activation Hotkey

                             Window Colors

                             Keyboard Setup

 

        All control information is personal and stored in that PMF.

        This means that each PMF can have its own personal activation

        hotkey, window colors, and everything else.

 

        The PMF Editor's main editing screen is identicle to ZAPCODE's

        main selection window. There is an additional window displayed

        at the bottom containing status information and a list of keys

        that can be pressed to control editing. They are:

 

                E   -   Edit the selected code

                A   -   Add a new code after the selected

                D   -   Delete the selected code

                M   -   Move the selected code

                C   -   Configure other options

 

        The PMF filename and memory usage are displayed in the lower

        left corner. This memory amount reflects the number of bytes

        the PMF would use when installed in memory (using the "/I"

        switch). This amount does not include the 17K bytes ZAPCODE

        itself uses.

 

        Edit Printer Code

        -----------------

 

        Press "E" to edit the selected printer code. A window will be

        displayed containing the printer code name, description and

        actual codes in decimal. Use the following keys during editing:

 

                UpArrow     -  Move to previous field

                DnArrow     -  Move to next field

                LeftArrow   -  Move cursor left one character

                RightArrow  -  Move cursor right one character

                Ins         -  Toggle insert/overwrite entry modes

                Del         -  Delete character under cursor

                Backspace   -  Delete character left of cursor

                Enter       -  Finish editing and save changes

                Esc         -  Abort without saving changes

                F1          -  Display syntax help window

                Alt-A       -  Add EMP window at cursor

                Alt-E       -  Edit EMP window at cursor

 

 



        (C) Copyright 1990 Morton Utilities, Morton Intl.        Page  9

 

 

        Use the UpArrow and DnArrow keys to move between fields. Use the

        LeftArrow, RightArrow, Insert, Delete, and Backspace keys to

        edit the current field. Press Enter to finish editing and save

        changes. Press Esc to abort without saving changes.

 

        Press F1 to display a window containing information about the

        syntax that must be used while entering codes. You may press F1

        only when the cursor is in the codes field.

 

        Press Alt-A to add an EMP window at the current cursor location.

        You may press Alt-A only when the cursor is in the codes field.

 

        Press Alt-E to edit the EMP window at the current cursor

        location. The box character symbolizes an EMP window. You may

        press Alt-E only when an EMP window symbol is displayed at the

        current cursor location.

 

        * Adding An EMP Window *

 

        To add an EMP window, place the cursor at the position within

        the codes that the "missing parameter" codes should be inserted.

        Then press Alt-A. A window will then be displayed in which you

        may enter the EMP instruction text. The following keys can be

        used while entering instruction text:

 

                UpArrow      -  Move cursor up one line

                DnArrow      -  Move cursor down one line

                LeftArrow    -  Move cursor left one character

                RightArrow   -  Move cursor right one character

                Ins          -  Toggle insert/overwrite entry modes

                Del          -  Delete character under cursor

                Backspace    -  Delete character left of cursor

                PgUp         -  Move to previous page of instruction text

                PgDn         -  Move to next page of instruction text

                Enter        -  Finish entering EMP instruction text

                Esc          -  Abort

 

        Use the UpArrow, DnArrow, LeftArrow, RightArrow, Insert, Delete,

        and Backspace keys to edit the instruction text. If you need

        additional pages to enter instructions, press the PgDn key. The

        PgUp key allows you to move back to previous pages. Press Enter

        to finish and save the new EMP.  Press Esc to abort without

        saving.

 

        You may create as many EMP windows for a printer option as you

        like. When the printer option is then later used, each EMP

        window will display and prompt in the order it is found in

        the control codes. For example, If you defined the following:

 

                "Hello ",EMP#1," My name is ",EMP#2,".",13,10

 

        (EMP#1 and EMP#2 would be displayed as box characters.)

        When this option is printed, the following happens:

 

 

 



        (C) Copyright 1990 Morton Utilities, Morton Intl.        Page 10

 

 

                1.  "Hello " is sent to the printer.

                2.  EMP window #1 is displayed and you are prompted

                    for "missing parameter" codes. Let's assume

                    you respond by typing "everybody." (quotation marks

                    included).

                3.  "everybody." is sent to the printer.

                4.  " My name is " is sent to the printer.

                5.  EMP window #2 is displayed and you are prompted

                    again. Let's assume you respond by typing "John Doe".

                6.  "John Doe" is sent to the printer.

                7.  "." is sent to the printer.

                8.  Character 13 (carriage return) and 10 (linefeed) are

                    sent to the printer.

 

        Your printer would have printed the following:

 

                Hello everybody. My name is John Doe.

 

        EMP windows allow you to do all sorts of great things. Use an

        EMP window to prompt for the tab stops in a "Set Tabs" control

        code sequence. Use one to prompt for the recipient's address

        for printing envelopes. Examine the included PMF's for examples.

 

        * Editing An EMP Window *

 

        To edit an EMP window, place the cursor on the EMP window symbol

        and press Alt-E. A window will be displayed containing the

        instruction text. Follow the same rules for editing an EMP as

        you did for adding.

 

        * Deleting An EMP Window *

 

        To delete an EMP window, place the cursor on the desired window

        symbol and press the delete key. You will be prompted for

        confirmation before the window is actually deleted. Attempting

        to type over the EMP window symbol will also delete it. ZAPCODE

        will ask you to confirm before it does so.

 

        Add Printer Code

        ----------------

 

        To add a printer code, press "A". A window will be displayed in

        which you may enter the name, description, and printer codes.

        Follow the same rules for adding a printer code as you did for

        editing. When finished, the code will be added immediately after

        the one that was selected when the "A" key was pressed.

 

        Delete Printer Code

        -------------------

 

        To delete the selected printer code, press "D". You will be

        prompted for confirmation before the code is actually deleted.

        Move Printer Code

        -----------------

 

        The move command allows you to organize and group the printer

        codes. To move the selected code, press "M". Then select the

        destination for the move using the UpArrow, DnArrow, PgUp,

        PgDn, Home, and End keys. The printer code will be moved to the

        entry immediately before the selected destintation. Press Enter

        to perform the move. Press Esc to abort.

 

        Configure Other Options

        -----------------------

 

        Pressing "C" allows you to configure the following PMF control

        information:

                                Printer Name

        9600, 19200, or 38400 bps. Data parity can be either Odd, Even,

        None, Space, or Mark. The number of data bits can be either 7 or

        8 and the number of stop bits can be either 1 or 2.

 

        * Printer Reset Codes *

 

        This option allows you to configure the printer reset codes.

        The printer reset codes can be sent by pressing the spacebar

        from ZAPCODE's main window.

 

        Selecting this options causes a window to be displayed

        containing the current reset codes for the PMF. Use the

        following keys:

 

                LeftArrow    -  Move cursor left one character

                RightArrow   -  Move cursor right one character

                Ins          -  Toggle insert/overwrite entry modes

                Del          -  Delete character under cursor

                Backspace    -  Delete character left of cursor

                F1           -  Display syntax help window

                Enter        -  Finish and save changes

                Esc          -  Abort without saving changes

 

        Use the LeftArrow, RightArrow, Insert, Delete, and Backspace

        keys to edit the reset codes. Press F1 to display a window

        containing information about the syntax that must be used. Press

        Enter to finish and save changes. Press Esc to abort without

        saving changes.

 

        * Activation Hotkey *

 

        This option allows you to change the key combination used to

        activate ZAPCODE for this PMF.

 

        A window will be displayed prompting for the new activation

        hotkey. You may use any combination of the shift keys (Ctrl,

        Alt, LeftShift, and RightShift) while entering a new hotkey. For

        example: To set the new hotkey to Ctrl-Alt-P, hold down the Ctrl

        and Alt keys and press "P". If you entered it incorrectly the

        first time, enter it again. Once you have entered it correctly,

        you must enter it once again to confirm.

 

        * Window Colors *

 

        This option allows you to change the ZAPCODE window colors. The

        colors for the following windows can be changed:

        Press Esc to return to background color selection.

 

        * Keyboard Setup *

 

        The "Keyboard Setup" option allows you to tailor the way ZAPCODE

        sends printer codes to the keyboard. The following options allow

        you to customize ZAPCODE to work with virtually any program:

 

                                Code Format

                                String Prefix

                                String Suffix

                                Code Prefix

                                Code Suffix

                                Code Delimiter

 

        "Code Format" is the format each code is expressed in. The

        following formats are available:

 

                Decimal ............................... 5,15,255

                Decimal 3 character ................... 005,015,255

                Hexadecimal with digit start .......... 5,0F,0FF

                Hexadecimal without digit start ....... 5,F,FF

                Hexadecimal 2 character ............... 05,0F,FF

                Hexadecimal 3 character ............... 005,00F,0FF

                ASCII

 



        (C) Copyright 1990 Morton Utilities, Morton Intl.        Page 14

 

 

        The examples to the right demonstrate how three codes (5, 15,

        and 255) are expressed when that format is used. "Hex with digit

        start" means that a numerical digit (0-9) must always lead the

        number. This is the format ZAPCODE prefers to accept hexadecimal

        numbers in. The last format, "ASCII", causes each code to be

        entered as its ASCII character equivalent. Thus, the following

        codes:

 

                        72  101  108  108  111

 

        would yeild their ASCII equivalents:

 

                        H   e    l    l    o

 

        The NUL code (character 0) can be used to define special keys

        and key combinations. For example, the following codes:

 

                        0   59   65   66   67   0   19

 

        translate into:

 

                        F1       A    B    C    Alt-R

 

        Codes 0 and 59 define the F1 function key. Codes 65, 66, and 67

        define keys "A", "B", and "C" respectively. Codes 0 and 19

        define the Alt-R key combination. See Appendix D for a complete

        list of special keys and the codes needed to define them.

 

        There aren't many programs that you would use the "ASCII" format

        for entering printer codes into. However, it does add to

        ZAPCODE's functionality in that it allows you to create keyboard

        macros. You could, for instance, create a PMF dedicated to this

        cause entirely. To use one of the macros, you would simply

        pop-up ZAPCODE, select it, and voila!

 

        "String Prefix", "String Suffix", "Code Prefix", "Code Suffix",

        and "Code Delimeter" are used to specify what comes before,

        after, and in the middle of each individual code and the entire

        string of codes. Each of these is sent to the keyboard as an

        "ASCII" format string. This means you may use special keys and

        key combinations in them. "String Prefix" specifies what comes

        before the entire string of codes. "String Suffix" specifies

        what comes after the entire string of codes. "Code Prefix"

        specifies what comes before each individual code. "Code Suffix"

        specifies what comes after each individual code. "Code

        Delimeter" specifies what comes between each individual code. If

        three codes were sent, they would look like this:

 

        SP, CP, Code1, CS, CD, CP, Code2, CS, CD, CP, Code3, CS, SS

 

                SP = String Prefix

                SS = String Suffix

                CP = Code Prefix

                CS = Code Suffix

                CD = Code Delimeter

 



        (C) Copyright 1990 Morton Utilities, Morton Intl.        Page 15

 

 

        Consider the following example:

 

                Code Format    =  Decimal 3 character

                String Prefix  =  "/PPOS"

                String Suffix  =  13,"QQ"

                Code Prefix    =  "\"

                Code Suffix    =  (nothing)

                Code Delimeter =  (nothing)

 

        The above configuration can be used to enter codes into Lotus

        1-2-3. Lotus 1-2-3 requires that each code be expressed as a

        three digit decimal number and that each is prefixed by the

        backslash character "\". The "String Prefix" moves 1-2-3 to

        the "Setup string:" option. The "String Suffix" moves 1-2-3 out

        of the "Setup string:" option and back to the spreadsheet. With

        this configuration, all that is needed to do is:

 

        1. Pop-up ZAPCODE.

        2. Select desired printer option.

        3. Press the Insert key.

        4. Goto step 2 if more.

        5. Press Esc key.

 

        You may also use the "Send to keyboard" feature to insert

        printer codes into ZAPCODE itself. For instance, you might want

        to create two PMF's for your printer. One would contain a

        definition for each individual printer option. The other might

        contain entire setup strings which might combine individual

        printer options. To create this second PMF, you could use the

        first to insert the codes into the PMF Editor. The "Keyboard

        Setup" for the first would look like this:

 

                Code Format    =  Decimal

                String Prefix  =  "A",0,80,0,80,0,80,0,80,0,80,0,80

                String Suffix  =  0,72,0,72,0,72,0,72,0,72,0,72

                Code Prefix    =  (nothing)

                Code Suffix    =  (nothing)

                Code Delimeter =  ","

 

        The "String Prefix" contains:

 

        "A" key to tell PMF Editor to add a new option.

         Six DnArrow keys to move the cursor to the "Codes" field.

 

        The "String Suffix" contains:

 

        Six UpArrow keys to move the cursor back from the "Codes"

        field up to the "Name" field.

 

        With this PMF resident in memory and while your using

        the PMF Editor to create the second:

 

        1. Pop-up ZAPCODE (which contains the PMF for the first).

        2. Select desired printer options you wish to combine.

        3. Press Esc key.

 



        (C) Copyright 1990 Morton Utilities, Morton Intl.        Page 16

 

 

        You must pop-up ZAPCODE from the main PMF Editor window since

        the "String Prefix" will take care of adding a new option and

        moving to the "Codes" field. Once you've exited the resident

        copy, the codes will be entered and the cursor will be moved

        to the "Name" field.

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

        |                   The Printer Make File (PMF)                |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        The PMF is simply an ASCII text file which you may edit using a

        line editor (such as EDLIN) or a word processor. The PMF Editor

        allows you to easily customize and create your own PMF's without

        regard to PMF syntax or structure. You may, however, do the same

        by simply text editing the PMF. This section and appendixes A,

        B, and C describe the PMF structure, syntax, and conventions in

        detail.

 

        The PMF consists of commands which tell ZAPCODE the following:

 

                        Printer Name

                        Printer Port and Setup

                        Printer Reset Codes

                        Activation Hotkey

                        Window Colors

                        Keyboard Setup

                        Printer Option Names

                        Printer Option Descriptions

                        Printer Option Control Codes

 

        Each command consists of a keyword and a number of arguments.

        The keyword identifies what is being defined, while the

        arguments define it. Appendix A contains a complete list of all

        PMF commands and their usage.

 

        PMF Syntax and Guidelines

        -------------------------

 

        1. Keywords must be in all capital letters.

        2. Keywords may start at any location within the line.

        3. Comments may be used by placing a semicolon before the

           comment text.

        4. Blank lines are permitted.

        5. The equals sign (=) is not necessary but may be used to

           enhance the clarity of the PMF.

        6. Arguments may be entered in any of three formats:

 

                        Decimal       eg. 255

                        Hexadecimal   eg. 0FFh

                        ASCII         eg. "XYZ"

 

        Arguments must be seperated by a comma or a space. Arguments

        entered in hexadecimal must be preceded by a numeric digit and

        end with the character "h".  Arguments entered in ASCII must be

        enclosed in quotation marks. To use the quotation mark in an

        ASCII argument, you must define it twice.

 

        The following page contains an example PMF:

        |           Appendix B - Shift Mask & Hotkey Tables            |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        This appendix contains the Shift Mask and Hotkey tables used for

        defining an alternate activation hotkey. (See the ACTIVATE

        command in Appendix A for a discussion.)

 

        To activate ZAPCODE, a combination of shift keys along with a

        hotkey must be depressed. The shift keys are the Ctrl, Alt,

        LeftShift, and RightShift keys, while the hotkey can be any

        other. To setup your own, you'll need to substitute a value from

        the Shift Mask Table for the argument "shiftmask" and substitute

        a value from the Hotkey Table for the argument "hotkey". The

        Shift Mask and Hotkey tables are on the next page.

 

        Example: To change the activation key sequence to Alt-P, you

        would substitute 8 for "shiftmask" and 25 for "hotkey".

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

        |             Appendix C - Calculating Window Colors           |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        ZAPCODE consists of eight windows in which any of seven colors

        can be changed. This appendix outlines the window numbers and

        their color assignments. (See Appendix A for a discussion of the

        COLOR command.)

 

        To change a window color, you must substitute the desired window

        number for the argument "window", and a color value for one of

        the arguments "color1", "color2", etc. depending on which window

        part you want to change. The Window Color Assignment Table (on

        the next page) lists each window number and its part assignments.

 

        To calculate the actual color value that must be substituted,

        you must use the following formula:

 

                colorvalue = (background x 16) + foreground

 

        The table below contains the background and foreground color

        numbers which must be substituted in the equation above.

 

                COLOR TABLE

                =========================================

                0   Black       8    Gray

                1   Blue        9    Light Blue

                2   Green       10   Light Green

                3   Cyan        11   Light Cyan

                4   Red         12   Light Red

                5   Magenta     13   Light Magenta

                6   Brown       14   Yellow

                7   White       15   High-intensity White

                =========================================

 

        For example, to change the selection bar color to yellow on

        blue, you would use the following equation:

 

                colorvalue = (1 x 16) + 14

 

        This would yield 30 for the "colorvalue" argument. Thus your

        COLOR statement would be:

 

                COLOR 2,0,0,0,0,0,0,30

        |               Appendix D - Special Keys Table                |

        +--------------------------------------------------------------+

 

        This appendix outlines the codes needed to use special keys in

        the "String Prefix", "String Suffix", "Code Prefix", "Code

        Suffix", and "Code Delimeter". Special keys can also be used

        when defining keyboard macros instead of printer options. See

        section entitled "Keyboard Setup" in "Using The PMF Editor" for

        details.

 

        The table on the following page lists the special keys on the

        left and the codes needed to define them on the right. For

        example, to define "F1" and "Enter", you would use "0,59,13".
