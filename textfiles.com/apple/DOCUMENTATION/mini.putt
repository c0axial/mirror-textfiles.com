The Star League Presents

Mini-Putt

\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

 THE GAME (introduction)

 Mini-Putt allows 1 to 4 people to play a round of minature
gold on any of 4 unique corses. This is a fun simulation of
a classic game, combining skill with a sense of humor.


 CHOOSE YER CLUB (selecting options)

+Move the mouse up or down to highlight Practice a hole,
 Play a game, or Quit. Press the button to continue.
+Move to the esired course and press the button.
+In practice mode, select hole to practice, and press the
 button.


 YOUR NAME IN LIGHTS! (name entry screen)

 Enter your name (up to 8 letters) and press RETURN. If
there are fewer than four players, press RETURN again.

 If you achieve a "low" score for any course, you're invited
to enter your name on the course's Pro Board. Use the same
procedure as above to enter your name.


 OFF THE WALL (how to aim your shot)

 Use your mouse to position the crosshair where you would
like your first putt to go. You may move the crosshair
within the play area only. If a hole extends past one
screen, move to the edge of the screen, and the next part of
the hole appears.


 HOW HARD? (powering your shot)

 While you're aiming your putt, the distance between the
ball and the current cursor position is displayed
numerically next to your golfer. You may have to use extra
power on holes with slopes and banks, and less power on
holes with a clear shot.


 FORE! (how to putt)

 When you're ready to shoot, press the mouse button. Notice
the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the
desired distance, press the button again, and the bar moves
back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving
indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the
bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves
horizontally onto the accuracy bar. In the middle of the
accuracy bar is a center line. To make the ball move exactly
toward the cursor position you're aiming for, you must press
the mouse the instant the indicator reaches this line. If
you press the button late (right of the center line), the
ball will move to the right of where you aimed. Press too
early, and the ball veers left. When you release the button,
the ball will begin to move.


 CHECK IT OUT (the scorecard)

 At the end of each hole, the current score for all players
appears on the scorecard screen. If you wish to see the
score at any other time, press the space bar.

 HOT TIPS FROM THE CLUB PRO
----------------------------

 TIMING SHOTS: The ball doesn't move until you release the
button on the accuracy bar. When you're trying to putt
through a moving object (a windmill, for example), use this
fact to aid you in your timing.

 MAKING PAR: In most cases, you've got several ways to make
a shot. The easy route to the hole requires more strokes
than the trickier multiple-bounce shots, but, of course,
it's safer. To make par on some holes, it may be necessary
to take the more difficult shots.

 TERRAIN:

 Smooth: Constitutes the main playing field. It is flat and
solid in color.
 Slopes: Slopes and breaks are indicated by arrows that
point in the direction they influence the ball to go. Dark
arrows on a light colored background break slightly faster.
 Walls: Walls and diagonals cause the ball to rebound in a
manner dependant on the speed and direction of the
approaching ball.
 Water: Water pools and traps may or may not be surrounded
by walls. If your ball lands in the water, your next stroke
is played from the point where it entered the water. A one
stroke penalty is added to your score.
 Bridges: Bridges may be flat, or sloped in any direction.
Some bridges are covered; others are open. Some bridges
(like draw-bridges) involve timing events; others require
more power in the shot. Some are bordered by walls, while
others have no such safety rails to prevent the ball from
falling into the water.
