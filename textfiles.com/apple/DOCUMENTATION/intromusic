About: NOISE TRACKER v1.0
 (VAMPS) DEMO DISKS
 INTROMUSIC & INTROMUSIC.W 

The INTROMUSIC files and INTROMUSIC.W  wave files, found on all VAMPS DEMO DISK,  are a complex (VAMPS) version of both new and earlier Noise Tracker and/or SoundSmith music files.  It took several days of work to create each of these files using my Apple IIgs, porting the data to a Macintosh and/or IBM with customized DSP (Digital Signal Processor) cards for editing, processing and encoding, then porting them back to the IIgs for final editing and composition.  

They were then converted, along with their selected individual sound samples to the Macintosh II format,  after being digitally remastered as VAMPS they were saved and converted to files that could be processed with a special VAMPS designed super-computer system.  After the final VAMPS full digital encoding was mixed, recorded and mastered, they were saved for use with Noise Tracker (VAMPS) v1.0.  Some of the original samples/sounds; (voice samples, musical riff instrument combinations and single music instruments)  were selected from a vast collection of digital samples from both the IIgs and Macintosh II/Quadra.   In some of the  VAMPS intromusic - wave files,  some VAMP sound/samples and wave files include characters like; (  Wolfman Jack,  Bart Simpson and family,  StarTrek digital voice clips,  Amiga,  Atari, NeXT and CRAY II sound samples, plus an original (RARE) digital voice clip of Marilyn Monroe.  Oh yes!, let's not forget the Church Lady from Sat. Night Live, with her famous, " Isn't  That Extra Special " classic ). 

 The VAMPS samples list in the OSRL library collection is so complex and gigantic, (with over 6000 sound/samples), I might have left something out.  If I did, you can view and listen to the individual VAMPS sounds that will be loaded from the INTROMUSIC.W VAMPS wave files, associated with  each  VAMPS INTROMUSIC file, via the NoiseTracker v1.0 program.  

To the best of my knowledge, no other music and wave file combinations (available for the Apple IIgs),  can even come close to the special VAMPS digital encoded effects and complexity of these on these disks.   Featuring tracks in the GS-RamBased sounds, with VAMPS sound/samples and tracks in the Ensoniq RAM with VAMPS sound/samples,  all playing together, some having separate speed-time rates and play-track maps set to loop or play for infinity.  These and the other ( 2 file/2 disk VAMPS sets) are the most complex yet devised for use with the Apple IIgs, using Noise Tracker v1.0  !  

Many of the  VAMPS - INTROMUSIC (music files) & INTROMUSIC.W (wave files) audio aspects, that have been released for use with: - Noise Tracker VAMPS v1.0, (according to  many experts in this field of ' Audio Directional Localization '), have virtually the same VAMPS and Psychoacoustic effects as can be found on the 
 " ROLAND SOUND LOCALIZATION SYSTEM " , which cost around $45,000 !   

So, Apple IIgs users and owners rejoice !   With the VAMPS system,  using Noise Tracker v1.0 and your Apple IIgs; with a Stereo card, a good high quality, high-volicity  set of full sized headphones and the unique built-in IIgs Ensoniq chip,  you can experience the same quality of Vortex Audio Mastered Psychoacoustic Sounds (VAMPS), that might cost upwards of $45,000, using other computer systems and add-on hardware/cards.  

 I hope you will enjoy the revolutionary new ( VAMPS) sound experience you have available with this DEMO disks set.  (AGAIN I WISH TO POINT OUT),  you can only experience VAMPS, via your IIgs, with a Stereo card, a good quality - high velocity full-sized headphone set, a good stereo system & Noise Tracker (VAMPS) v1.0.   I also hope you find some humor and laughter in listening to the various INTROMUSIC files presented during the start of this and the other  VAMPS DEMO disks that are released.   Be prepared to wait a bit for the music and wave file to load and play for you.    PLEASE NOTE:  Some INTROMUSIC files are set to play in a loop (for infinity).     When you grow tired of it,  press any key or click the mouse, to enter the program or press the Apple key during the boot to by-pass it and go directly into the NoiseTracker program.  

NoiseTracker v1.0 is FREEWARE.  It is supplied as a free program on all VAMPS DEMO disk sets.   In my opinion this program is the most advanced music program yet made available for the Apple IIgs and its users, who number over 1 million, world wide.  
The author/programmer, Olivier Goguel deserves praise and support for his efforts in developing and making such a supreme freeware IIgs music program, from all those that use it.

 He deserves all the support you can give him !  He is one of the few programmers that develops software for the IIgs, that really shows the full potentials the Apple IIgs can present.  Many of his software products; Photonix II,  Fontrix GS, NoiseTracker, the SSS Sound Editors, etc.,  have made my computer music,  art work and related efforts so easy and  enjoyable.
