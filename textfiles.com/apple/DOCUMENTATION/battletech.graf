Is the Battletech dox file called BATTLETECH.DIAG? Its a BINary file correct?
You packed it with DDD? I got EDS errors or something like that when I was
unpacking it and I cannot get it to work. Any su]gestions? Otherwise thank you
very much for uploading them.

  The doc is a high-res picture showing the various battletech parts that you
would need to know for the exam in the game...
  I think DDD files are of type $DD. Packed Bin files are usually binary II
files that can be unpacked with shrink-it.
  You do not have to unpack the Battletech.Diag:
    Goto Basic
    Bload Battletech.Diag,A$2000
    call -3100
    poke 49234,0
    (text and then bye when finished)

        The Battletech.diag file is a hi-res pic.  Just do a "]HGR2" and then
"]BLOAD BATTLETECH.DIAG,A$4000" and you'll see the pic load up...or use your
favorite single hi-res paint program...like 816/paint...
