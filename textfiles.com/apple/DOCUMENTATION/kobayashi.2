SHIP'S SYSTEMS

Some candidates may not have detailed information concerning the  theory
and operation of Constitution class starships.  Since basic knowledge of
these  systems  is  required for participation in this scenario, a brief
rundown of equipment structure and capabilities is included.  (Excerpted
from  Jane's  Fighting Starships, vol. 1, Federation Star Fleet Vessels:
revised edition. By kind permission of the publisher, Jane  Interstellar
Ltd., London WC1/Deneb V.)


ENGINES

Propulsion   is   by   controlled   matter-antimatter   reaction.  Total
annihilation of both substances  takes  place  within  magnetic  bottle.
Maximum  speed:  Warp  Factor 8; cruising speed:  Warp Factor 4; maximum
safe cruising speed: Warp Factor 6. If Warp Factor 6 is  maintained  for
more  than  twenty-four  hours at a time, the magnetic bottle containing
the  matter-antimatter   reaction   erodes   dangerously   and   becomes
un-regenerable  because  of  magnetization  of the generating equipment.
Damage to the dilithium crystals  is  also  likely,  especially  if  the
crystals have seen more than 3000 hours of service. Failure of dilithium
crystals  (which  help  channel  power  to  the  warp  engines  from the
matter-antimatter reactors in the nacelles) will force the ship to  drop
out  of  warp.  The  ship may proceed on impulse power until repairs are
effected (usually eight hours). 

Destruction of all of the ship's dilithium crystals will force the  ship
to  proceed  to  a  planet  where they can be obtained through mining or
trade. However, just getting to such a planet is likely to take anywhere
from several months to several years.  Captains  who  burn  out  all  of
their  ships'  dilithium  crystals  are  rarely  entrusted  with another
starship command. 

Matter  for  the  matter-antimatter  reaction  is  usually  interstellar
hydrogen,  NH,  or other radicals that are "scooped" out of space by the
accretion layer of the ship's warp field.   Antimatter  is  manufactured
periodically  aboard  ship  by accepted laboratory methods (each nacelle
has a collapsed-matter-target linear accelerator adapted for use  as  an
antiparticle  "breeder").  Fuel  is  therefore  a  regenerable resource.
However, there are places in space where even monatomic hydrogen  is  so
sparse  that  the  ship  will  be  in  danger of running out of "steam."
Sensors can be used to locate these interstellar doldrums in advance. 

Primary life support is powered by the warp  engine  system.   Secondary
life  support  is  powered  by the impulse engines.  Periods longer than
thirty days on impulse will exhaust secondary life support, leaving  the
ship without backup. 


PHASERS

Phasers  come  in  two  kinds:  the  large "ship's phaser" and the small
"handphaser."  A  "phaser  beam"  is  hypercoherent  radiation  from  an
artificially  grown  cesium-dilithium  crystal  LED that is energized by
ganged conventional high-power  laser  (descendants  of  the  "satellite
killers"  of  old). The multiple lasers and the crystal are manufactured
and  tuned   to   emit   a   "chord"   of   frequencies   only   a   few
hundred-thousandths   of   an   angstrom   apart.   The  multiple  beams
exponentially augment  one  another's  effeciency  and  are  still  more
coherent  than  any  conventional laser alone while they remain in phase
(hence the name). Phasers are independently powered out  of  the  ship's
secondary  energy  supply  (as  opposed  to  those on the newly designed
Enterprise, which are powered directly out of the warp engines). When  a
starship   is   in  warp,  the  phaser  beams  (at  firing)  shares  its
faster-than-light (FTL) acceleration for a brief period  after  punching
out  of  the  warp field. Therefore, they can be used in FTL battle, but
over long distances they quickly lose their FTL speed.  Phasers  can  be
"burned  out"  by  excessive use (bombardments of more than five minutes
without a rest-and-recycling period). Their most common  malfunction  --
also  related  to  overuse (which often occurs after approximately three
minutes of constant use) -- is failure of one of the ganged lasers. This
causes the phaser chord to lose effectiveness. Full power is not  always
necessary. A captain may call for half- or quarter-power. 

Ship's  phasers  are  the  most  effective  way to reduce another ship's
defensive screening.  A  sequence  of  three  hits  (sustained  barrages
lasting  from  3  to  10  seconds  each) at full power on another ship's
screens  will  begin  overloading  those  screens  and  reducing   their
effectiveness. Subsequent hits knock the target's screen down another 10
percent  to 15 percent for each hit until there is no power left and the
target ship's naked hull is exposed. 

Enterprise's phaser "banks" are located both fore and aft. The fore bank
is located under the main "disk" hull, near the center; the aft bank, on
the rear edge of the disk, above the impulse  engines.  Both  banks  are
aimable  within  about  a  270-degree spherical radius, leaving very few
unprotected angles. (But there are a few.)

Handphasers are small versions of the  large  ship's  phasers.   Setting
range  from  "stun"  to  "kill." The stun setting will leave the average
human being unconscious for  anywhere  from  ten  minutes  to  an  hour,
depending  on  the  victim's  physical  condition.  A  handphaser on the
highest setting is capable of heating  a  small  boulder  red-hot  in  a
matter  of seconds or melting through a metal door. Handphasers are good
for about twenty minutes' continuous use before needing  recharge.  They
are  rechargeable  either  aboard ship or, in the field, by use of extra
power packs (which contain about fifteen minutes' power each). 

 Handphasers have the same tendencies to burn out or lose chord  as  the
big  ship's  phasers  do.  They can be set to intentionally overload and
explode. Some alien species (for example, Hortas) are  not  affected  by
handphaser fire unless special alterations have been made to the weapon.
They  have small limited-range warp-field generators that enable them to
be used against objects traveling faster than the speed of light. 


PHOTON TORPEDOES

A photon torpedo is a simple, elegant, and effective weapon comprised of
a very small amount of antimatter contained in a magnetic bottle and the
generating apparatus to maintain the  bottle.  On  command,  the  bottle
degenerates,   which   brings  the  antimatter  into  contact  with  the
generator's matter and produces a tremendous explosion of both  standard
shock  waves and extremely hard radiation. Photon torpedoes can be fired
directly at a nearby object to explode on contact with it, or  they  can
be set with delayed fuses and ejected as mines. 

Photon  torpedo  "tubes"  must  be  recharged  after  each  use, both by
reloading the tubes with new torpedo apparatus and equipping  the  torps
with fresh antimatter from ship's breeder. The process takes from thirty
seconds to a minute after a "full spread" has been fired. 

Enterprise  is  equipped  to  fire  photon torpedoes from both front and
rear: each bank is comprised of four aimable tubes. A "full  spread"  is
eight  torpedoes,  one  from  each tube: front, back, right front, right
rear, left front, left rear, upper center,  lower  center.  Simultaneous
fire  from  all  four  tubes  pointing  in  a  given  direction  may  be
concentrated on one point. 


TRACTOR BEAMS

Tractor beams are actually "grasers":  coherent  beams  of  gravity-wave
packets. A tractor beam locks onto a given object
