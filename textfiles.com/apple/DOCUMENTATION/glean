                                 INTRODUCTION                  

                                                                                

                                                                                

     Greetings:  This manual is designed to assist you in the execution 

     of commands found on your Gleaners diskette.  The sequence of 

     commands on the diskette corresponds to the steps in the manual. 

                                                                                

     As you proceed with the execution of the Glean program, the 

     research potential for home and school becomes apparent.  I feel 

     that the development of research and computer skills with the use 

     of the program makes for a winning combination. 

                                                                                

     It has been the intention from the beginning to share this program 

     with students and educators.  For all curious individuals who seek 

     knowledge, especially with the help of National Geographic (R) 

     magazines, I wish you the best of luck with this program!



     I wish to thank my wife Trish, who's inspiration initiated the

     program, and who's many hours of data entry helped produce the

     final product.

                                                                                

     Feel free to write or communicate with me at any time.

                           STARTING A NEW DATABASE



     If you wish to create an index for another magazine or set of 

     books, you may do this with GLEANERS INDEX.  To do this, erase 

     the Cat$.rec files and Gleaners Index will create new files 

     when you add new records using the ADD NEW RECORD selection.



     Another method would be to delete all the records from the 

     Cat$.rec files using the EDIT OR DELETE RECORD selection.  Either 

     method will allow the user to create a new index.



     GOOD LUCK !!!
