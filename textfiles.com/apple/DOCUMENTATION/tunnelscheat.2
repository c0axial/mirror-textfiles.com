Tunnels of Armageddon Cheat Number Two
By DrMicrochp
	As most of you
know, typing in "K- A - C - P - E - R", at the stage of the game where the 
color wheel becomes neccessary to gain access to the game, will allow 
you access without consulting the wheel.  You simply type KACPER and hit 
return and you're in.
	While playing the game in
this fashion I discovered a real first class cheat.  After entering the game via 
the KACPER back door, type/press the letter "Q" while in the game.  Presto! 
You have an unlimited supply of "disintegrator" bullets.  These bullets will 
destroy any door, generator, or guardian.  It's similar to Ammo Type 3 but it's
unlimited.  Also it doesn't seem to matter which way you aim as anything in
general direction gets blown away.  Constantly firing like this, I made all the way to level/stage 6 without even trying.  Now I feel like I can get through this game.
No more dodging black wall obstacles!  Careful though, as some moving gray
walls can still cause you enough damage to put you out of the game.  Enjoy!
