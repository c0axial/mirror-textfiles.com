Chapter One: Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~ ~~~
Hardware Requirements:  Certain pieces of hardware (such as your computer and a modem) are required for Mousetalk to work properly.  To use Mousetalk, you should have:

     An Apple personal coumuter or compatible
     128K Memory (64K internal and 64K Text Card)
     80 Column Text Card (as above)
     Mouse and Mouse CArd
     Serial Card
     External Modem
     Serial Cable

Mousetalk will not work on the Apple II, Apple II+, or unenhanced Apple IIe computers.  While Mousetalk can be operated without an Apple Mouse, we encourage you to have and use one.

     Mousetalk does not support any internal "plug in" modems, except internal modem/serial card combinations, such as the Prometheus 1200A.

     Additionally, optional equipment includes a printer, extra disk drives, and a hard drive.  Though not required, we do recommend you have a printer, and a hard disk drive is one of the best things that you can have for your computer.  Mousetalk works with all ProDOS-compatible printers, hard disk drives, including the Unidisk 3.5 drives.

Note: The caret (^) or hat, is used to indicate a control character or code.  For example, ^D is CONTROL-D.

     When words appear between sqare brackets ([]), they're referring too a graphic button on the screen.  For example, [OK] refers to a button marked OK on your screen.

     USII Customer Support- (303) 671-0033.  The phone number is available Monday thru Friday from 9 AM to 12 PM and 2 PM to 5 PM Mountain Time. NOTE: You need the program serial number, and this support is for registered Mousetalk owners only, and is designed for problems regarding program problems.


Chapter Two: Using MouseTalk
~~~~~~~ ~~~

Menus: To pull one down, hold down the mouse button while pointing to the menu releasing the button hides the menu.  To select an item, call up the menu and drag the mouse down until you get to the item, then release the mouse button.  Items with checkerboards cannot be accessed, and items with checks can be toggled on or off.

Mousetalk's Menus:  From left to right, Mousetalk's pull down menus are:

Apple: Contains general information about the program and what options were selected during installation.

File:  Controls files on the disk, files used with Mousetalk's Edit or quitting options.

Edit:  Contain's MT's editing and text commands.

Phone: Is responsible for dialing, answering, and hanging up the phone and allows access to MT's macros and session files.

Send:  Contains sending options.

Receive: Contains receive options.

Session: Deals with configuration of MT's session files and options, macros, and general communications control.

Review: Is a special storage place (called a buffer) where characters MT receives are temporarily stored.

The Mouse Pointer: Is controlled by moving the mouse.  Usually, pointer resembles an arrow head, but depending on which part of the program is used and when it is used it can change to different characters.

Insert Cursor: When editing, the mouse pointer changes to a large "L" shaped cursor.  It is controlled the same way as the mouse pointer.

Bracket: When using MT's Review window, the mouse pointer changes to the left bracket "[". This is only in the actual Review window itself.

Nothing: When typing in MT's editor, or when the screen scrolls in terminal mode, the pointer dissappears from view.  Any movement of the mouse will bring it back.

Buttons: to press a MT button, click the mouse on the button, clicking the mouse on the menu bar is usually the same as clicking the [OK] button.

Checkbox: is a box which indicates whether a function is on or off. A check appears in the appropriate box.  To change it, just click the mouse on the other box.  When a function doesn't have an On or Off checkbox, a check in it's checkbox indicates that it is on, no check means it is off.

Radio Buttons: are like the push buttons on a car radio to choose station, only one may be selected at a time.  The item with the lit button is on...to change it, just click the button on whatever other one you want.

Input box: is a box with a underscore cursor.  It is used to allow the user to type in a selection (such as a file name).  When several input boxes appear in one dialog box, click the mouse in the one you want to activate it. All editing functions are availible in an Input box (see chapter 9)

Scrolling Windows: used to display long lists.  Only a set about of the "roll of paper" can be seen at a time. Clicking the down arrow key next to the list scrolls the list down, the up arrow scrolls it up.  The small rectangle in the scroll bar area is like a tiny picture frame which moves up and down the list showing approximately where the window is looking on the list.  To select an item from the list, either double click the mouse on the item, or click the [OK] button to confirm the selection.  To hide a menu, click the close box(a small box with a dot in it).

Pseudo-Mouse: Usually, when a dialog or alert box asks [OK] or [Yes], RETURN will substitute, and ESC for [Cancel] or [No].  Pressing OPEN-APPLE-? in a dialog box with a [help] button is the same as selecting [help] OPEN-APPLE-/ is the same as OPEN-APPLE-?.  A scrolling window can be positioned using the arrow keys(Up arrow for up etc...) to highlight one entry in the list.  To scroll the window bar, use the OPEN-APPLE with the up or down arrow keys.  The TAB key can be used to swithc from one input box to another. Some items in the menus can be called by pressing OPEN-APPLE with a letter key, to be discussed as it comes along.  

:Holding down the OPEN APPLE key and pressing ESC will turn on the imitation mouse mode, the menus can be selected with the arrow keys.  To switch on the mouse movement mode, hold down both APPLE keys at once and then let go the SOLID APPLE.  press any of the arrow keys to move the mouse pointer and SOLID APPLE to click.  Once the OPEN APPLE is released, imitation mouse mode is over.

Chapter Three: Getting Started
~~~~~~~ ~~~~~
Getting Started...the mouse controler card is recommended for slot 4 and the modem in slot 2.

Super Serial Card:MT only pays attention to switches setting SW1 number 7 and SW2 numbers 6 and 7, other switches should be set according yto your manual.

              Printer:SW1 number 7 should be ON.
                      SW2 number 6 and 7 both should be OFF

              Modem :SW1 number 6 and 7 should be ON
                     SW2 #6=ON, #7=OFF

              Software:

Chapter Five: Communicating with MT
~~~~~~~ ~~~~
     MT allows your computer to communicate with other computers working as a remote terminal.  This Chapter is provided as any easy, non-technical overview of how computers communicate with eachother.

Bits, Bytes and Characters: Computers operate on a binary counting system. The numbers 0 and 1 represent off and on.  A bit (Binary DIgit) is either a 0 or 1 A byte is a set of bits, typically 8.  The eight bits in a byte can be arranged in 256 different ways.  Each of these represents a value from 0 to 255.  The first 128 of the 256 arrangements represents characters, each seperate number, corresponding to a letter, number or symbol.  The standard set of the 128 characters is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and represent the numbers, letters in upper and lower case, punctuation and special control codes.

The Modem: The modem is a contraction of MOdulater-DEModulator, it translates the digital bits that the computer understands to analog sounds, which are sent over the phone line, and translated back.

Carriers and Breaking: Once two modems are talking to eachother, they send a special signal to each other, called a carrier, the pitch of which is either the Originate or Answer (to tell which computer is sending what info.).  When the carrier stops, communication ends, and usually means that the other modem has hung up.  Breaking is a special interruption in the carrier, about 1/3 second long.  The break can be used in many different ways, depending on the host computer.  Some interpret it as a break signal as in Basic's CONTROL-C, but it really is up to the computer.

Data Word Format: refers to how your computer's serial interface interprets bits coming in from the modem.  The bits of the information is sent in a stream between computers, but a special format is needed to tell when one character ends and the other begins...Each character transmitted is usually 10 bits in length, 2 more than in a byte, are used to tell the format of the information.: the first bit of the character is the start bit, used to tell when the character starts.  the following 8 (7,6 or 5 with some interfaces) bits represent one of the 128 ASCII characters, sent out backwards.  The 128 characters is represented by the last 7 bits, the 8th used to flush it out to 8.  The 8 bits are followed by an optional value called the parity bit.  If an odd parity check is used, and the sum of the bits is odd, the parity bit is set to 0.  If the sum is not odd, the parity bit is set to 1.  If an even parity check is used,the parity bit is set to 1 when the sum is odd.  The parity bit occupies the 8th bit in the byte, since ASCII uses only the first 7.  The 10th bit, is the stop bit, used to tell when the character stops.

Echo: Usually, on-line communications is a two-way street, you send a character to another computer and that computer echoes the same character back at you.  That means that all the characters you see are sent by the other computer.  But that is not always the case.  Some systems don't send back an echo, and therefore your system must display the characters sent out. On most systems echo is on, therefore, the local echo is off, but if you cannot see what you are typing, local echo must be turned on. If double characters appear, local echo must be turned off.

Chapter Six: Controlling the Terminal
~~~~~~~ ~~~

     The terminal is where most on-line communications take place, and where the most time will be spent on MT.

The Session Menu: Configuring MT's communications options is done in the Session menu.  The menu is divided into two basic parts.  The first several items, NEW SESSION, LOAD, WRITE, WRITE SESSION, MACRO EDITOR, SESSION TYPE, DIAL SETTINGS, and ANSWER SETTINGS allow changes made in the terminal mode to be saved to disk in session file.  Adjustments can be made for each on-line system and be recalled later for use.  These are disscussed in chapter 10. The remaining items can be used to customize Mt's terminal for each different call: 

System Settings controls various aspects of MT's Terminal Speed adjust the bits per second at which MT sends and recieves characters.

Data Word Format selects the way MT interprets data recieved

Terminal Emulation allows MT to emulate the behavior of several popular computer terminals, and is discussed in Chapter 11

Char Suppression selectively filters control characters recieved by MT

Here-is is an option which allows MT to automatically send a response each time it recieves the special "Here-is" character

System Settings:  Pull down the Session Menu and choose System Settings, or press OPEN APPLE-U.  Most of the items displayed in this dialog box can be toggled on or off.  After the nessesary changes are made, click [OK] to put them into effect.

Add Line feeds: This is used when the host computer is not supplying line feeds for your screen or printer.  The line feed character usually follows the carriage return.  If a line feed does not, all characters recieved are written over on the same line

Chat: If you are on line with someone, and you cannot see what you are typing, but can see his, choose the Chat option. The chat can also be used to communicate with dumb terminals or on-line printers.

Display Menu Bar:  The menu bar on the top of the screen can be turned on or off.  When off, the menus can be accesed by moving the mouse to the top of the screen and pressing the mouse button.

Flow Control: refers to MT's ability to control the flow of text coming from the host computer, flow control works by sending the XOFF and XON characters (CONTROL-S and CONTROL-Q) to pause and resume transmission.  Normally, there is no need to turn this off, since most hosts will support it.  Also, when this is off, typing  CONTROL-S and CONTROL-Q manually can still be done.  You can redefine the XON and XOFF characters in the boxes below the option.

Key Click: When this is on, a click will be heard whenever a key is pressed.

Local Echo: See ch. 5
         
Show Control Chars:  ASCII characters 0 through 31 are called control characters and are not displayed like normal characters. When this option is on, a control character recieved will be shown with a "^" in front of it. (ie. CONTROL-C = ^C)  The only ones not shown are CONTROL-M (carriage return) and CONTROL-M/CONTROL-J  (carriage return with line feed).

Speed: is the communications speed in bits per second.  Pull down the Sessions menu and choose Speed.  The speed at which communications will be done can be chosen by clicking the mouse.

Data Word Format: refers to the format of the parity and ASCII bits (see ch.5) The first character stands for the word length, the second for (e)ven or (o)dd parity bits and the last for the amount of stop bits.

Character Suppression: directs MT to filter or suppress recieved control characters as they are recieved.  Listed is a table of ASCII control characters, a check by the suppressed ones.  To change the status of one, click the mouse on it.

Here-is: This option directs MT to look fro a specific character sent by the host.  When this character is recieved, MT sends a response automatically. 

The Review Buffer: is where MT holds the last 8,192 characters (8K) recieved, when it is full, MT deletes the oldest characters and makes room for the new. The review buffer can be used anytime, on-or off-line. Just pull down the review menu and choose review.  Use the Scroll Bar to look back through the text.  To get out, pull down the Review menu and choose Terminal, press OPEN APPLE-R. 

Selecting Text: it's possible to copy portions of the text in thereview menu to MT's Clipboard, the printer or to disk.  Move the mouse to the review window, and select a block of text. Pull down the Edit menu and use on of the following options.

Copy to Clipboard: stores a copy of the selected text to the Clipboard.

Copy to Printer: sends a copy of the text to the printer.

Copy to Disk: save the block to disk.

Chapter Seven:Working with files
~~~~~~~ ~~~~~
     A file is acollection of infromation on a disk.  The 3 types of files refered to in this manual are:

Text Files: consist of ASCII text, typically containing information made by text editors and word processors, or contain text sent over the modem.

Data Files: contain binary information, such as facts in a database or numbers in a spreadsheet.

Program Files: contain programming instructions and code, which the program reads from for its instructions.

The File Menu:  The File menu is where most of MT's file related commands are located.  The command areas are the Editor commands, dealing with the MT editor, which are disscussed in Ch. 9.  Disk Utilities are general disk file commands.  Quitting commands, either to quit to ProDos, or to the Install program.

Disk Utilities:  Catalog: to see a list of files on the current directory. At the top of the Catalog dialog box is the name of the current directory, or subdirectory. Below the directory name is a scrolling window listing every file in the directory, in alphabetical order.  Following the name of the file is a 3 file type (i.e. BAS for BASIC, TXT for ASCII).  The size of the file in blocks (of 512 bytes) is shown after the file type, followed by the date of creation, and the date of last modification.  The last number is the size of the file in bytes.  Use the [PREFIX] button to catalog another volume.

Volumes: displays information about all the disk volumes in your system.  The first item is the name of the volume,  followed by its slot and drive.  The next item is the total # of blocks on the disk, and the number of blocks used and free.
     
View a File: displays the contents of a text file. Double click the file name to select it.  While viewing it, the space bar or the mouse button will pause and unpause the scrolling. Press ESC or OPEN APPLE-PERIOD.

Rename a File: will change the name of a file.  If a file is locked, a disk error box will appear, the name cannot be changed by MT.

Delete a File: will delete a file from disk.  To delete a Subdirectory, choose the name from the scrolling window.

Prefixes:  The [PREFIX] button appears in every dialog box dealing with files.  When it is pressed, a dialog box will appear.  Listed in the scrolling window are the avalible directories under the current directory. When at the volume directory level, (as shown by one /), the names of each volume are displayed in the window.  Click the [<-] button to move from a subdirectory up to the parent directory, and the [->] button to move down one level to the subdirectory. If the name of a prefix is entered that does not exist, MT creates it for you. Just enter the name of the Subdirectory, and MT will create it and automatically switch to it. All Prefix dialog boxes are operated in the same way, however, changing the prefix for one command does not change it for all.  MT has 4 seperate prefix groups: The First includes all MT's primary disk and file access commands. VIEW, DELETE, RENAME, CATALOG, OPEN, SAVE AS, SEND FILE PROTOCOL, RECIEVE FILE PROTOCOL, and SEND TEXT FILE.

   The second controls Recieve to File.
   The third conrols MT's Session commands.
   The fourth cannot be changed by using a [PREFIX] button, and is where MT looks for it's own program files.

About MouseTalk shows information about the MouseTalk program, including the program drivers and modem selection.

Open loads a text (TXT type) file into the Editor. Choose a file from the window, or type its name in the input box. Click 'Prefix' to choose a new disk drive/directory. Click 'OK' once a file is selected.

Clear Editor wipes clean the contents of the Editor. If a document in the Editor has not been saved since the last change, Clear Editor asks to verify the clear. The Editor must be clear before a new file can be Opened.

Close ends the editing session. If the file has been changed since the last save, you will be prompted to proceed with the close or given another chance to save. After Closing, the Editor is emptied.

Read inserts a text file into the Editor at the cursor's location. This is similar to Pasting a text, though an entire file is inserted. 

Save records all changes made in the Editor to the disk file being worked on. 

Save As saves the contents of the Editor to disk. Choose a file name from the window or type the name of a new file in the input box.  Click 'Prefix' to choose a new disk drive/directory. Click 'OK' to save the file.  If an existing file name is used, MouseTalk will ask if you wish to re-use or append to the file. 

Revert To Saved loads the most recently Saved copy of a document back into the Editor.

Editor switches from Terminal mode to the MouseTalk Editor. Once in the Editor, this menu item changes to Leave Editor. Leave Editor switches back from the Editor to the Terminal mode.

Click 'OK' to save the file.  If an existing file name is used, MouseTalk will ask if you wish to re-use or append to the file. 

Find locates a word or phrase of up to twenty characters typed in the input box.  Choose Forward to search after the cursor position, or Backward to search before.  Click 'Find' to start the search. Once the text is found, MouseTalk selects (highlights) it. 

Find Next locates the next occurance of text entered using the Find command. It's the same as re-using Find and clicking 'Find'. 

Change Case alters the case of selected text to either all upper, all lower, or mixed case. 

Fill puts as many words possible on each line in a paragraph and word-wraps text to the next line.  Fill works only on selected text.  A paragraph is considered any group of letters, words and numbers followed by a blank line. 

Clean Up removes all control codes from selected text. After 'Cleaning Up', the text will only contain carriage returns. 

Show Clipboard displays text held in temporary storage in the MouseTalk Clipboard.

This command displays the help box for any item on any MouseTalk menu. After choosing Help, select an item from a pull down menu. Releasing the mouse button displays the help box for that item. For more detailed help, refer to the MouseTalk Manual. 

Enter a phone number in the input box. Wait time indicates the number of seconds MouseTalk waits for the other modem to answer the phone.  Click Tone or Pulse dialing depending on the phone company equipment installed at your house.  The Redial option automatically redials the number if a connection is not made.  Click 'Dial' to dial the number.
