    WHAT IT DOES:

    -------------



    19200HST is a utility program written with Turbo Pascal 5.0 using

    routines from Prokit by Samuel Smith.



    19200HST is released as a free program.  No donations are requested for

    it's use.  The authors are not responsible for any damage that might be

    caused by the use of this program.  Please use this program at your own

    risk.



    The purpose of 19200HST is to aid owners of USRobotics Courier HST

    modems in setting up for optimum speed.



    This program is designed for callers only.  Although I run my BBS with

    the settings from 19200HST, I would recommend that Sysops follow the

    instructions for their specific BBS package on modem settings.

    Registered PCBoard sysops have a similar program called PCBMODEM that

    should be used instead of this program.



    This program will lock your serial port at 19200.  This setting may

    only be effective on 286 and 386 systems.  Some multi-tasking software

    may not be able to handle this setting.  If you find that you are

    having trouble with aborted downloads after running this program then

    you should probably go into your terminal program and type AT&F

    followed by the ENTER key to reset the modem to it's factory settings.



    Using these settings along with protocols designed for error correcting

    modems such as DSZ's Ymodem-G and Xmodem-1K-G or Qmodem's version of

    Ymodem-G I have achieved file transfer speeds in the 1100 - 1150 cps

    range on a regular basis using both 286 and 386 systems.





    HOW IT DOES IT:

    ---------------



    19200HST starts by giving the suggested dipswitch settings, which are

    as follows:



                1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10

                --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --

                UP  UP  DN  DN  DN  UP  UP  DN  UP  UP



    These settings will do the following to your modem:



    1 UP - DTR is controlled by software



    2 UP - Send verbal result codes



    3 DN - Result codes are displayed



    4 DN - Local echo of commands is suppressed



    5 DN - Auto Answer Suppressed



    6 UP - Do not force carrier detect



    7 UP - Single phone line connection (RJ-11)



    8 DN - AT command set enabled



    9 UP - Hang up when escape code is sent



    10 UP- Load from NRAM in power up





    It then will reset your modems internal NRAM settings to the original

    factory defaults.



    Next it sends the following settings to the modem's non-volitile

    memory:



    ATS7=60E0M0X7



    S7=60 - Number of seconds modem waits for carrier



    E0 - Local echo off



    M0 - Speaker Off (can be overidden by putting M1 in your modem program's

         initialization string)



    X7 - Result code option (OK, CONNECT, RING, NO CARRIER, ERROR, CONNECT,

         NO DIAL TONE, BUSY, NO ANSWER, RINGING, VOICE)





    Once this string is received it sends the following additional

    settings:



    AT&H3&R2&S1&B1&K0&W



    &H3 - Hardware and software control



    &R2 - Received data output to terminal on RTS high



    &S1 - Modem controls DSR



    &B1 - Lock port at speed setting (19200)



    &K0 - Disable data compression (override with &K1 in modem

          initialization string)



    &W -  Write these settings to non-volitile RAM (NRAM).





    After running this program, you should go into the setup portion of

    your modem program (Qmodem, Procomm or whatever) and change the modem

    initialization string to ATZ followed by whatever character that

    program uses to send a carriage return (Qmodem uses a { Procomm uses a

    !).



    DATA COMPRESSION?

    -----------------



    The HST has a setting for "Data Compression".  19200HST turns this off

    because I've found that when the HST tries to compress a file that is

    already compressed, such as an .ARC file that it will slow the transfer

    down considerably.  Text Files and compiler listings that are not

    compressed will go at blinding speeds, but in the real BBS world it's

    rare to find files in the download sections that aren't in some sort of

    compressed form.



    If your application finds you downloading mostly un-compressed files

    then you may want to put &K1 in your modem initilization string.

    Otherwise, leave it alone and you will see a marked increase in

    performance.



    TIPS 'N' TRICKS:

    ----------------



    If you want to overide any of the NRAM settings that I have written in

    the program, you can either do by placing the replacement commands in

    the modem initialization string, or by going into the terminal mode of

    your modem software and typing those commands followed by AT&W.



    It is highly recommended that you use a high performance protocol

    driver such as DSZ by Chuck Foresberg.  The registered version of DSZ

    includes YMODEM-G and Xmodem-1K-G protocols which should yield the

    highest possible CPS ratings under this setup.  The current versions of

    many popular modem programs have built-in versions of Xmodem-1K-G

    (called Ymodem-G in some versions) which will yield excellent speed,

    but won't allow batch mode downloading that true Ymodem-G from the DSZ

    program features.



    Zmodem will give 1000-1100 cps on properly configured systems. Zmodem

    is featured in non-registered versions of DSZ that are available on

    most BBS systems.



    Avoid using Xmodem, Ymodem, WXmodem, Kermit, Jmodem or other protocols

    that rely on software error checking when you are connected to another

    HST at the fixed 19200 bps rate.  These protocols will give you between

    400-900 cps.  One reason I wrote this program was that I see people

    night after night calling with HST modems improperly configured and

    getting transfer speeds of 400 cps.





    SUPPORT:

    --------



    As stated above, this is a free program.  You will probably use it

    once, then throw it away and forget all about me.  That's fine, but at

    least when you call my BBS at 19200 you won't be getting 400 cps!



    Updates to 19200HST are always available on my BBS, The Ledge PCBoard,

    which is listed at the top of this file.  Although you can't download

    from my file directory on the first call, you will be able to open the

    SUPPORT door and download any of the programs that I've written, or any

    third party programs (such as DSZxxxx.ARC) that are mentioned in this

    file.  My support door DOES have Xmodem-1K-G (Ymodem-G) so if you are

    looking for a place to test...come on!
