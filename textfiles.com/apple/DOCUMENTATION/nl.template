----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Templates module gives Nifty List, version 3.0 or better, the
ability to use GSBug style templates.  A template is basically a
structured way to view memory.  For example, there are all kinds of
parameter blocks for GS/OS sitting around in memory that you could
view with Nifty List's ;h command.  But, with the ;h command, all you
would see is a big unstructured group of bytes.  With a template,
memory is broken down into fields which can be displayed with meaning.

To install Templates 1.0, copy the Templates file into the
*:System:Desk.Accs directory of your GS/OS boot disk, and then reboot.

NOTE:  To be able to use Templates 1.0, you *MUST* have a copy of
       the GSBug "GSBug.Templates" file, or you can create your own
       following the GSBug.Templates file format.  You can acquire
       the GSBug.Templates file, as well as GSBug, from APDA.

While this command isn't specific to Templates, it will show you all
the commands that you can issue for Templates 1.0.  Don't forget
that you can issue the = command on each template command to find
out more about it.  For example:

=\loadtemp
   Will show you the help information for the \loadtemp command.

---------
\loadtemp
---------
The \loadtemp command loads in a GSBug style template file.  You must
first load a template file (obviously) before you can use a template
to view memory.  The \loadtemp command uses a default filename of
"*:System:System.Setup:GSBug.Templates" to load a template file.  If
you wish to load in a different template, you can specify the name,
in quotes, after the \loadtemp command.  For example:

\loadtemp
  Will load in the default *:System:System.Setup:GSBug.Templates file.

\loadtemp ":MyDisk:MyTemplate"
  Will load in the :MyDisk:MyTemplate file.


-----------
\unloadtemp
-----------
Once a template file has been loaded, it sits around in memory until
you feel the need to unload it.  Template files take up a lot of
memory, so if you have loaded a template file and think you will no
longer need to use it, unload it to reclaim some memory.  You can
always reload the template file later if you need to use the
Templates module again.


---------
\tempinfo
---------
If, for some reason, you want to find out some information about the
template file that you have loaded, you can use the \tempinfo command
to do just that task.  The \tempinfo command will show you the pathname
of the template file you have loaded as well as some information about
the memory that the template file occupies.


-----
\temp
-----
The real work of the Templates module comes from the \temp command.  With
the \temp command, you can apply a template to a particular area of memory.
The \temp command has the syntax of:
  addr\temp "template"
Where addr is the starting memory address to apply the template to and
template is the name of the template to overlay on that memory area.  For
example:

12/54AF\temp "OpenRecGS"
  This takes the template called OpenRecGS and applies it to the memory
  starting at location 12/54AF.

To see the master GSBug template list, you can issue the command:

\temp "Templates"

You would then see the major template categories.  You can then look at
the subcategories by issuing yet another \temp command, for example:

\temp "GSOS"
