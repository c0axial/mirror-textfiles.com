Offensive Plays

You have five offensive plays from which to choose:

Left Wing      LFT
Right Wing     RHT
Top of Key     TOP
Basket         BKT
Screen         SCRN

Left Wing (LFT).  Your teammate runs to the high post left or high post right
(HPL or HPR) and stays there for one second.  Then he runs to the left wing
(LFT), stays there for two to four seconds, and runs a random pattern on the
left side of the court.

Right Wing (RHT).  Your teammate begins by running to the high post left or
high post right (HPL or HPR) and waits there for one second.  Then he runs to
the right wing (RHT) and waits there for two to four seconds before running a
random pattern on the right side of the court.

Top.  Your teammate runs to either the right of left high post (HPR or HPL),
waits there for a second, and then runs to the top.  He stays there for two
to four seconds and then runs a random pattern at the top of the key.

Screen (SCRN).  You see your teammate as a screen to block out any defenders
trying to cover you.  Your teammate runs to HPL or HPR and stays there for
six seconds, allowing you to dribble around him as he blocks the defender.
Then he runs a two-step pattern between the high posts.

Basket (BKT).  Your teammate runs to the high post left or right (HPL or
HPR), then drives under the basket.  He waits there for two seconds and then
runs a random three-step pattern under the basket.

Defensive Plays

You have four defensive plays to choose from:

Low Zone            LZN
High Zone           HZN
Man-to-Man Light    MML
Man-to-Man Dark     MMD

Low Zone.  When you call low zone, your teammate will stay in the key
(between the basket and the inner white line on the court).  When an
offensive player enters his zone, he covers him man-to-man.  If the offense
floods the low zone (which means BOTH offensive players enter the key), your
teammate will cover the ball handler.  In this case, you should cover the
offensive player without the ball.  When your opponents are not flooding the
low zone, your teammate always takes the man in the low zone, and you take
the man outside the key in the high zone.

High Zone.  If you assign your teammate to the high zone, he covers the ball
handler when that player is in the high zone.  When the ball handler enters
the low zone area around the key, YOU cover him, and your teammate covers the
player without the ball.

Man-to-Man Light.  Your teammate covers the opposing player who wears the
light-colored uniform.  He stays with that player everywhere on the court.
You cover the player in the dark uniform.  The goal in man-to-man coverage is
to stay between the man you're guarding and the basket, trying to keep him
from getting under the basket and making an easy shot.

Man-to-Man Dark.  This is the reverse of man-to-man light.  Your teammate
covers the man in the dark uniform, and you cover the man in the light
uniform.

Strengths and Weaknesses of Zone Defense

The zone defense is very effective against inside shooters.  If the ball
handler breaks away from the man playing the high zone, the man playing the
low zone can usually cover the ball handler before he can get into position
near the basket.  The weakness of the zone defense is that one defender is
always the key, resulting in a two-on-one situation outside the key.  This
sometimes means that one of the offensive players can take an easy outside
shot.

If you're playing against the computer, it's easier to beat the computer when
you play a zone defense.  If you want a more challenging game, play
man-to-man.

Playcalling and Loose Ball

If nobody grabs a rebound and the ball is loose, the computer will sometimes
allow you to regroup your offense and call another play.  You'll know this is
happening if the playcalling screen appears.

Penalties
---------

Bumping into an opposing player continuously for more than one second results
in a foul in the following situations:

A defensive foul occurs when one of the defensive players bumps into the ball
handler.  The penalty is either the ball out of bounds to the offense or free
throws.

Charging occurs when the ball handler bumps into a defensive player.  The
penalty is change of possession or free throws.

Fouls and other penalties are displayed on the scoreboard in flashing letters
right after they occur.  However, if a player is fouled while shooting, the
foul won't be displayed on the scoreboard until after the shot has either
gone in for a field goal or missed.  Fouling the shooter results in one free
throw if the basket is good and two free throws if he misses his shot.

The number of TEAM FOULS is also displayed on the scoreboard.  Teams get five
fouls per half; the count is reset to zero at halftime.  If a team
accumulates more than five fouls in a half, this results in bonus free throws
for the other team.

Other Violations

Traveling is called if you jump to shoot but don't release the ball in time.
It won't be called if your shot is blocked by an opponent and you come down
with the ball.  Traveling results in a change of possession.

The Three-Second Rule is invoked if an offensive player stays inside the key
for more than three seconds at a time.  However, when the ball is in the air
or up for grabs, all players can stay in the key for as long as they like,
until someone comes up with the ball.  Staying in the key too long results in
change of possession.

The 24-Second Shot Clock gives the offensive team 24 seconds to make a shot
after they bring the ball into play.  The scoreboard has a SHOT CLOCK which
counts down the seconds.  Failure to make a shot in time results in change of
possession.

Here's a summary of all violations and penalties:

With three of fewer team fouls:

Fouling the Shooter:
   if ball goes in...............1 free throw
   if ball misses................2 free throws
Fouling the Ball
   Handler.......................Ball out of bounds to the offense
Charging.........................Change of possession
Three Seconds in Key.............Change of possession
24-Second Clock..................Change of possession

With more than three team fouls:

Fouling the Shooter
   if ball goes in...............1 free throw
   if ball misses................2 free throws
Fouling the Ball
   Handler.......................2 free throws
Charging.........................2 free throws
Three Seconds in Key.............Change of possession
24-Second Clock..................Change of possession

A word about free throws.  Players don't have control over free throw
accuracy.  It's based on the outside shooting rating.  To make a free throw,
just push the joystick button and release it.  All players can rebound after
the last free throw attempt.

The Quarter Clock and Overtime

You'll play four 6-minute quarters in each game.  If the teams are tied at
the end of the fourth quarter, you'll automatically go into overtime, which
is another 6-minute quarter.  The amount of time left in each quarter is
shown on the clock in the middle of the scoreboard.  At the end of each
quarter, a buzzer rings and the screen displays which quarter has just been
played.  You then go immediately into the next quarter.

At the start of the game, the home team always takes the ball out (Player One
is always the home team).  The visiting team brings the ball into play in the
second quarter.  The home team again takes the ball out when the third
quarter begins, and the visiting team starts off the fourth quarter.

Calling Timeouts and Pausing the Game

To pause the game, simply press the <esc> key on your keyboard; TIMEOUT OR
ESC TO RESUME will be displayed on the scoreboard.  If you merely want to
pause the game, press the <esc> key when you're ready to resume.

You can call a timeout only when you're on offense.  If you want to call a
timeout, first press the <esc> key, then press the joystick button.  Each
team is allowed five timeouts per half.  On the scoreboard you'll notice five
little lights on the HOME and VISITOR sides of the board.  Each time you call
a timeout, one of the lights will go out.

Calling timeouts saves precious seconds at the end of the game.  If your team
is behind and the clock is about to run out, you should call a timeout right
after you've called a play.  When you call a timeout, your players don't have
to take the time to run down court and set up the play; they'll just appear
on the court, in position, when play resumes.

To quit a game in progress and start over, press <esc>, then <CTRL-R>.

After the Game
--------------

At the end of every game, you can read all about it.  The sports page of the
Gamestar Gazette appears on the screen with the following boxscore writeups:
the team names, the final score, the total field goals for each team,
shooting percentages, rebounds, steals, blocked shots, and the name of the
leading scorer.  Here's what the numbers mean:

Field Goals.  This is the total number of baskets that each team made.  Each
basket is worth either 2 or 3 points, depending on where the player was on
the court when he made the shot.  Free throws do not count as field goals.

Percentage.  The field goal percentage is calculated by taking the total
number of actual field goals and dividing it by the total number of field
goal attempts.  That number is the team percentage.

Rebounds.  Every time your team pulls down a rebound, it's recorded here.

Steals.  This number records the number of times your team stole the ball
from the opposition.

Blocked Shots.  There are two types of blocked shots.  After the shot is
blocked, either the defender comes down with the ball or the offensive player
retains possession.  Blocked shots are only recorded here when the defender
gains possession of the ball.

Assists.  This is the number of times a player's passing sets up a teammate
for a basket.  To get credit for an assist, you must pass the ball to your
teammate, who can dribble the ball only one time before putting the ball in
the basket.

Fouls.  The number of personal fouls-- for example, charging and hacking--
each player commits is listed here.

Leading Scorer.  The top scorer's name will be displayed with the number of
points he scored.

GBA Championship Basketball also gives you a breakdown of each teams'
statistics.  Press <return> and you'll see a linescore similar to:

Pioneers
                 PTS  FG  %   RB  ST  BS  AS  FO
Player One        10  05  35   4   2   5   2   4
Player Two        20  10  45   5   4   5   4   3

Sharks

Player One        10  05  35   4   2   5   2   4
Player Two        20  10  45   5   4   5   4   3

By Quarters        1   2   3   4   F

Pioneers          12  12  13  10  47
Sharks            10  10  12  14  46

                      Attendance 17,547

Press Button to Continue

In this linescore, PTS stands for points scored, FG for field goals (that is,
baskets) made, % for shooting percentage (baskets made divided by shots
attempted), RB for rebounds, ST for steals, BS for blocked shots, AS for
assits, and FO for fouls.

This linescore also shows you the score at the end of each six-minute period
and the final tally.  It also lists the attendance for today's game, in this
case, 17,547.

If the game was part of league play, GBA Championship Basketball lists the
division standings after you press <return> to continue.  It also tells you
<Parent Dir>   O
<return>) to return to the chalkboard menu and start another game.

To Play Another Game

When a game ends, press the joystick button (or <return>) to return to the
chalkboard menus.  If you've just played any game (except league play) and
want to play the same game again, you don't have to type in your name again
or select a new computer teammate unless you want to.  Just press <return> or
highlight CONTINUE and press the joystick button as you move quickly through
the menus.
