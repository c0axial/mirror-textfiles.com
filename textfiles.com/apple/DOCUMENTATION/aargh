                             ERNST ROHM & THE PROTECTORATE OF BOHEMIA


AAARGH! DOCUMENTATION:

The monsters are on the loose, heading out of their caves in the badlands and into the cities.  They are coming to cause chaos, wreck havoc and inflict terrible destruction, as they search for the Roc's eggs.

The giant horned ogre and the hideous lizard are out to seek revenge on the humans who have for so long driven them back into the highlands.

CRUSH! MAIM! DESTROY!

Pulverize towns to find Roc's eggs, take them back to your cave, then providing that you can beat off the challenge from the other monsters and collect a hoard of five eggs, you will head off to the volcano and find the golden egg to win the game.

OGRE

Born in a damp cave in the north of the island, you have always had a hard life.  When you were just a little ogre none of the other monster children would play with you, and now if you go into town, all the humans scream and fire cannon at you.  It could have something to do with the fact that you are twenty feet tall, with 2 horns in the middle of your forehead.  Alternatively,
it could be your halitosis, which is so bad it sets things on fire.  Or even the fact that you can knock down stone wall with your fists.  Anyway, now it is your turn to get your revenge, you are going to claim the golden egg.

LIZARD

So what do you do if you happen to be an eighteen foot tall green scaly lizard, with a spiked tail and a penchant for young ladies, preferably flame grilled in your own breath?  Well, you set up home in the mountains and start work on your first hoard and try and terrorize the neighborhood.  So when you learn that that infuriating ogre is after the golden egg that lies under the volcano, there is nothing to do but to head into town and try and get there first.

THE ISLAND

Darance is a quiet, peaceful island, where the humans go about their daily business with a smile on their face and a song in their heart, ah!  They are totally unaware that they are about to receive a visit from two of the most terrible and ferocious monsters ever to see the light of day.

THE CITIES

Awaiting your destruction there are ten cities.  These include a primitive village of straw huts, a wild west fort, a Chinese pagoda, an Indian temple, and many others before your final goal of the famous volcano.

GAME PLAY

In each city you need to destroy the buildings until you find the Roc's egg.  There is an egg hidden in most but not all of the cities.  You will need to punch the buildings to demolish them, or flame them to set them on fire, while fighting off the other creatures on the screen.  Watch out for the hornets that fly across the screen and sting you.  Be wary of the weapons the humans try to bring to bear.  You will need to destroy these before they destroy you.

FOOD

You can eat the junk food and the people.  These increase your health, thus enabling you to continue your destruction for longer.

FIRE POWER

Eat the lightning to revitalize your fire power.

HEALTH

Every time you are hit your health decreases.  Your health is represented by the word "Aaargh," by your character at the top of the screen.  When the word is completely formed, you will die a very bloody death.

COMPLETING A LEVEL

Wen you hve captured the egg you will take this back to your treasure cave.  Unfotunately, life is never easy and you will need to fight to keep your treasure.

You have a limited amount of time to find the egg.  After a certain period, the natives will have had time to hide the egg from you, and you will have to go on to another scene.

When you have succeeded in gathering a hoard of five eggs, you can go to the volcano and try to capture the big one, the final Roc's egg, a golden egg to surpass all others.
