The new GS/OS Driver I have written for the RAM Disk is designed to be a
companion to RAM Disk Manager, however it will run just as well without the
RDM CDA installed.  On my computer I get nearly 3x the speed out of my RAM
Disk.

What you have is a DEMO of the GS/OS driver.  The "real thing" is part of
the RDM package but you get it only after paying for RDM.  $10 isn't too much
to ask for such a useful utility.  See the CDA documentation for information
on how to pay for RDM.

This DEMO is just like the "real thing" except in one respect:  You cannot
write to the RAM Disk.  This is just enough to tease you, and make you want
to send me money.  The fully functional driver is available immediately.
With this demo you can play around with benchmarking programs and try things
while at the same time it is counterproductive to try to use this for
normal work.  Use a ProDOS 8 program to copy files onto the RAM Disk
and test it under GS/OS.  Or whatever makes you happy.

One last thing.  The driver is NOT being distributed under the shareware
concept.  It is available ONLY to registered users of RAM Disk Manager, with
the exception of this demo.  Remember, a measly $10 gets you both the CDA
with the P8 driver and the GS/OS driver.

INSTALLATION:  Put it in your DRIVERS directory.  You're done.  When the
               demo gets on your nerves, delete it.  Simple.  The file to
               copy is called "RDM.GSOS", or in the case of the demo,
               "RDM.GSOS.DEMO".  When you install the release version be
               sure you delete the demo first!

* FEATURES *

      o ROM 1 machines only.  It's a feature until I can do something
        about it.  That should be very soon, actually.

      o 2-3x speed improvement.  Fast!  <1 millesecond access time.
                                    (Benchmark: ProSel-16 w/7 MHz TransWarp)

      o Smartport independent.  That is, if Slot 5 is set to "Your Card",
        the driver is smart enough to install itself as a slotless device
        and you can access the RAM Disk anyway.

      o Device independent.  The driver will work even if you boot from
        the RAM Disk.  One driver fits all.

      o Fully Functional.  Supports virtual RAM Disks.  Transparent to
        the user with exception to the speed improvements.  Works with
        RAM Disk Manager's CDA flawlessly.


That's about all I can think of right now.  Read the other documentation
file to see how to get a fully working version of the driver.
