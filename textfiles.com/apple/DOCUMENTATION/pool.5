   An official looking notice.
   "Assemble a group of at least 30 of your followers. Meet up with a
hobgoblin assault force at the small docks to the west of town. You and
your group will be under the command of the hobgoblin leader. Follow
his orders. Upon completion of the mission you will be rewarded with
food, treasure, and many slaves."
   Signed,
   The Boss
   Scribbled on the back of these orders is Norris the Gray's unsent
reply to The Boss
   "I will never follow the orders of a hobgoblin. I don't go on
missions until I know exactly what we're supposed to do. And I don't go
on missions for an unknown amount of food, treasure and slaves'. I do
go on missions where I am in command; where I know exactly what the
target is; and where I know exactly how much I'll get paid. Don't send
me another order until you can meet my terms."

   JOURNAL ENTRY 51:
   Several pieces of paper with highly organized writing.
   Fact: Bishop Braccio is the highest ranking religious leader in
Phlan. Runs small temple in civilized section of city.
   Vague Rumor: Braccio is actually a front-man for a powerful high
priest who never leaves the small temple.
   Strong Rumor: Braccio is under fire to 'do something' about the
undead problem. So long as the undead were causing the monsters more
trouble than the settlers, he had other, more pressing, problems.
   Rumor: Braccio is opposed to the temple tendency to sell clerical
'miracles'; but he understands that the temple needs funds. Braccio
would rather perform such 'miracles' in exchange for good works done in
the name of the church, not just for money or items of power."

   "Hear us in our hour of need!" the nomad witchdoctor cries, "This
night we fight a great battle. By the breaking of dawn either our
enemies will be dead or we will have been destroyed.
   "Accept the sacrifice of these outsiders and give us the strength to
defeat the hordes of our enemies. Fill our limbs with your fire, and
fill our minds with your fury. Let us vanquish our enemies just as we
vanquish these invaders who have come among us."

   A page from an unknown diary.
      "They stole my map to the Pool. Somehow they knew when I was
coming and exactly what to look for. They didn't even bother to kill
me; they said I wasn't worth killing. They just crippled my legs, took
the map, and rode away laughing.
   "After the attack and the rigors of my trek all I remember is that
the Pool is in the Dragonspine, north and west of Sorcerer's Island. It
shines just like they said it would. You can feel the power flowing out
of it. Kings and generals have searched for the Pool, and I had a map
that led right to it.
   "If I ever get back the use of my legs I'll go after them. I'll get
back my map. I'll get to the Pool. And this time I'll bathe in its
power. Then I'll teach them. I'll teach them all."
 
   JOURNAL ENTRY 55:
   Delivered as you sit around the campfire.
   "You must beware of the many dangers in this region. Several days
walk to the west there is the pyramid of evil. It has been long avoided
by all sensible men. To the southeast is a lair of many ferocious
hobgoblins. The areas to the southwest, are inhabited by evil men --
buccaneers, marauders, and soldiers of an evil empire far to the west.
And all good folks avoid the swamps to the east. Nothing but danger
grows in the swamps."

at the west of town to Sokal Keep. Find the adventurers in or around
Sokal Keep. Kill them before they can return to the city council with
information about the true situation at the keep. Return with the
invader's heads as proof of completion of your mission. Upon completion
you will be rewarded with food, treasure, and many slaves."

                             TAVERN TALES
 
   The taverns of New Phlan are filled with scoundrels, con-men, adn
adventurers - every one a liar and a gossip. The following tavern tales
represent such rumors and lies.
 
   When you are in a tavern, you may be referred to a particular tale
by number. Find and read that tale. If you really think of your
adventurers as rumor mongers, read all the tales.
   Some of these tales are true, some are based on truth, and some have
never been corrupted by a hint of truth. Even when a tavern tale is
referred to by number, it might be false.
 
   TALE 1: Far to the northeast, in the midst of a vast swamp, lie the
uninhabited ruins of a powerful wizard's castle.
 
   TALE 2: A drunk bard sits in a corner of the tavern spinning a
seemingly endless tale, but no one is listening.
 
   TALE 3: Wells throughout the city often provide access to hidden
dens and underground passages.
 
   TALE 4: An anglish lord commandeers one corner of the bar to lecture
on the ultimate range of his adventurers. The crowd ignores him.
 
   TALE 5: To the east of Phlan lies a gleaming castle of gold that
shifts its location from time to time.
 
   TALE 6: A weird looking wizard, dressed all in black, sits alone and
mumbles into his beer, "I'll return next time and show them all!"
 
   TALE 7: Great treasures are to be found on the banks of the Barren
River as one ventures northward.
 
   TALE 8: The graveyard is controlled by a very powerful and clever
undead creature.
 
   TALE 9: A puzzled patron with a limited vocabulary questions
everyone he comes across about how to complete a manuscript dated 1977
GUE. Unfortunately, no one can help him.
 
   TALE 10: To the west lives a tribe of insect-men who worship normal
men and give valuable gifts to all who visit them.
 
   TALE 11: The Dragonspine Mountains are inhabited by a race of evil
dragons who lure travelers to their lairs and slay them.
 
   TALE 12: A bedraggled adventurer decries, "There was a man called
turtle, walls that aren't there, living daggers; I never did figure out
what was going on!"
 
   TALE 13: A master thief has set up a hidden training ground deep in
the old city, right under the noses of monsters.
 
   TALE 14: Ogres who live to the east of Phlan are holding captive a
princess for whom a huge reward has been offered.
 
   TALE 15: The merchants of Zhentil Keep are setting up a trading base
far to the west of Phlan. They're hiring caravan guards for good wages.
 
   TALE 16: Buccaneers operate a slave auction out of a hidden camp
near Stormy Bay.
 
   TALE 17: An old sage sits in a corner with a dark wizard. "You're
right," laughs the sage, "they'll do anything I tell them to, no matter
how silly or phantastic."
 
   TALE 18: Off to the east of Phlan roams a tribe of marauding nomads.
They have been pillaging villages in the plains with the help of a
powerful artifact they have discovered.
 
   TALE 19: Mighty tribes of wild dwarves, thousands of them, roam the
Dragonspine Mountains, destroying villagers and killing travelers.
 
   TALE 20: "I was totally confused; it was like being lost in the
darkness," sighed the overwrought adventurer. "Rabbits, hats, bowling
balls? Where in the realms was I?"
 
   TALE 21: The monsters in Phlan are led by one of the generals who
sacked the city a generation ago. The general has used great magic to
make himself immortal.
 
   TALE 22: A vast fortress of kobolds dominates the western tip of the
great swamp. These normally weak creatures grow to great size and have
extraordinary powers here.
 
   TALE 23: An ancient Silver Dragon still lives up in the Dragonspine
Mountains. The dragon is not evil and will help travelers who battle
evil.

   TABLE OF EXPERIENCE PER LEVEL
   The following shows the amount of experience a character must earn
to gain a level in his character class. All experience earned by
multiple-class characters is divided by the number of classes. When a
character has earned a gain in level for one class but not another, the
Show command shows his highest level. Thus, a character who is a
fighter-thief and has earned 1,800 experience points in each class (a
total of 3,600 XP), will be shown to be 2nd level because he has earned
that level as a thief, though not as a fighter. His fighting abilities
are still based on his being a 1st level fighter.

   CLERICS vs. UNDEAD
   A good or evil cleric (not a neutral one) has a certain influence on
undead. He extends this influence by using the Turn command in the
Combat Menu. His level determines how many undead and what kind he can
influence. Evil clerics can make undead either neutral or friendly to
the party. Good clerics can drive the undead away and may be able to
destroy them if the cleric is of a high enough level and the undead are
of a low-enough level.
   The following is a list of undead in increasing order of power and
what minimum level of cleric a character has to be to have any
influence over them. Low level clerics generally have a chance, not a
certainty, of affecting undead.
 
                      Minimum
   Undead Type       Level of Cleric
 
   Skeleton                1st

   GLOSSARY OF AD&D GAME TERMS AND COMPUTER TERMS
 
   ABILITY SCORES. These are numbers that describe the attributes of
the characters. There are six ability scores: Strength, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma. For the most part, the
range of numbers runs from 3 to 18, the higher the better.
 
   ADVENTURER. This is a term for one of the characters you play in
this game.
 
   ALIGNMENT. This is the basic philosophy of a character. See
Alignment in the What are Characters? section of the rule book.
 
   CHARACTER. This is another name for one of the persons you play in
the game. A party consists of several characters.
 
   COMMAND. A one or two word option in a menu. Activating the command
allows you either to view another menu or have your characters perform
an action.
 
   ENCOUNTER. This is what happens when a party meets a monster. You
are given a menu of choices of how you want to handle the situation.
 
   ENTER. The act of giving a command to the computer. How this is done
varies depending on the computer.
 
   EXPERIENCE POINTS (XP). Every encounter the characters have yields
experience points for every character depending on how successful the
encounter was for the party. A character who gains enough XP can
advance a level if he has enough gold for training.
 
   FACING. In combat, a character faces a certain direction. An attack
from the direction he is not facing has a greater chance of doing
damage. A character will always face an opponent if he has only one
opponent.
 
   HIT POINTS (HP). This is a measure of how healthy a character is.
Damage from weapons subtracts hit points from the characters total.
When he has lost all of his hit points, he is unconscious and dying. If
his wounds are bound by another party member, he is simply unconscious.
 
   ICON. This is the small picture of a monster or a character seen in
the initial stages of an encounter and during combat. Character icons
can be altered using the Alter command in the Camp Menu.
 
   INITIATIVE. This is a semi-random determination of which character
in a combat acts first. The characters with higher dexterities have a
better chance for a higher initiative.
 
   LEVEL. This describes the power of a number of different items. The
power of characters, dungeons, monsters, and spells are all described
with levels.
 
   CHARACTER LEVEL. This is a determination of how much experience a
character has. The higher the level, the more experienced and important
the character is. High-level spellcasters can cast high level spells.
 
   DUNGEON LEVEL. This is a measure of how far down in the earth a
dungeon is. For the most part, the further down one is, the more
ferocious the monsters. Thus, a high-level dungeon refers either to how
deep it goes or the relative toughness of the monsters.
 
   MONSTER LEVEL. This is a measure or how powerful monsters are. The
higher the level, the more powerful the monster.
 
   SPELL LEVEL. Spells come in degrees of difficulty. The higher the
level of the spell, the higher the difficulty. Only very experienced
magic-users and clerics can learn high level spells.
 
   MAGIC. This term covers spellcasting, enchanted items, and any other
application of the supernatural.
 
   MELEE COMBAT. This is hand-to-hand combat with weapons such as
swords, spears, and fists.
 
   MISSILE COMBAT. This is ranged combat with weapons such as bows and
arrows, crossbows and quarrels, and slings and slingstones.
 
   MONSTER. This term actually includes human and other player races as
well as such creatures as ogres and dragons. In general, if it isn't
part of your party, it's a monster. Monsters are not necessarily
hostile. Some may be helpful. That's what the Parlay command in the
Encounter Menu is for.
 
   NON-PLAYER CHARACTER (NPC). This is a member of a player character
race who is not controlled by the player. Some NPCs can be brought into
a party.
 
   PARTY. The group of adventurers you form to perform the missions you
are given. A party can be reformed for each adventure, and even altered
during the course of an adventure.
 
   PLAYER CHARACTER (PC). This is a member of a player character race
who is controlled by the player. The characters in your adventuring
party are PCs.
 
   SPELL. This is a magic incantation that can alter the nature of
reality. Both magic-users and clerics can cast spells after memorizing
them. If the spell is cast, it is gone from the user's mind and must be
re-memorized.
 
   SPELL BOOK. The book a magic-user carries his spells in. If he
doesn't have a magic book, he has no spells to memorize.
