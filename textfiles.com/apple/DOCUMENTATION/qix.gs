DISK LOADING INSTRUCTIONS

        Turn on the computer (duh!).  Insert the game disk into drive 1 with
the label facing upwards.  The game will load automatically using the GS/OS
residing on the QIX diskette.

        If the GS Operating System is already up, insert the game disk into the
drive.  Clock the mouse pointer twice on the QIX icon when it appears.  The
game will load automatically.

Please Note:

        At least 768k, but preferably 1 megabyte, of free memory is required if
you want to load QIX from the Finder.  One megabyte of expansion memory is
required tro run QIX under Finder 5.0.2

        If your GS has less free memory than required, you will only be able to
boot directly from the supplied disk.

        If you want to boot directly from the QIX disk, with the disk in the
drive, reset the computer in the usual manner and the game will load
automatically.

HOW TO PLAY

        The QIX is an evil and terrifying computer virus.  Nobody knows where
it comes from (yeah, right!).  Your mission: immunize the system against this
insidious infection!  But the QIX is intelligent; it learns from its mistakes. 
It also breeds lethal subviruses that can quickly spread and infect your
system.

        Each player starts with three lives.  Fill in sections of computer
memory without becoming infected.  A level is completed when the required
section of memory is immunized against the QIX.  For example, you must immunize
65 percent of level one to proceed to level two.  The percentage increases as
your progress.

        A life is lost if the QIX touches an incomplete line, or if the marker
is attacked by a FUSE, SPARX, or SPRITZ.


STATUS AND SCORING

        The status panel on the right side of the screen shows the current
number of lives, required claim, completed claim, and current level.  The
SPARX timer is located above the game screen.  It begins to shrink during play.
Two SPARX are created each time the line disappears.  On higher levels, the
SPARX will follow you up your line once the alarm rings.

        Player scores are located at the top of the screen.  Points are awarded
for filled section of memory.  A SLOW draw earns twice as many points as a FAST
draw.  A player earns 1,000 bonus points for each percent over the required
claim.

        Trapping a SPRITZ virus inside a filled section is worth 500 points. 
All FAST fills will now generate SLOW points until you die.  Splitting two QIX
from each other multiplies the point value for each new FAST and SLOW fill.  An
extra life is awarded every 50,000 points.


HIGH SCORE SCREEN

Enter your name in the QIX Hall of Fame by using the keyboard to enter your
initials.  Press RETURN to return to the title screen.


STEREO CARDS

        This game supports several stereo cards, such as the SUPERSONIC(tm)
from MDIdeas.  When this type of card is installed, QIX provides rich stereo
sound for your listening enjoyment.


HINTS AND TIPS:

o QIX has no time limit; plan your strategies carefully.
o Build alls to guide the QIX into a position where you can trap it.
o Try and split a pair of moving QIX as often as you can; your score
  will multiply.
o Keep moving; the SPARX are always looking for you.
o Second guessing the QIX isn't recommended.
