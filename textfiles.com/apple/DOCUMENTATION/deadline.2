CHAPTER I

Investigative Techniques for Cases of Suspected Homicide----

The  detective investigating a possible homicide is much like a person
piecing together a puzzle. In both  endeavors,  the  participant  must
weigh  each  inconsistency, and ultimately determine how all the parts
fit together as a logical whole.  Here, then, are some  considerations
to bear in mind as you attempt to solve this puzzle. 


The Time Element: 

It is usually necessary to conduct your investigation as expeditiously
as  possible.You  have  a deadline of 12 hours,make proper use of your
time, its important. Most actions you  perform  will  take  about  one
minute  of investigative time, some actions, such as examinations done
CAREFULLY, may take longer.  If you wish time to pass without actually
doing anything, you can say WAIT FOR some number of  MINUTES....OR....
WAIT  FOR  some  person.....OR...  WAIT UNTIL a specified time. In any
case, you will see events occurring while you are waiting  and  always
have  the opportunity to change your mind about sitting idly should an
interesting event take place. 


Evidence: 

During your  investigations,  you  will  uncover  pieces  of  physical
evidence  found  in your vicinity. While this evidence may be vital in
itself to reach a proper conclusion to the case, it  may  also  be  of
great  interest  to  one  ot  the  principals  in the case. Therefore,
Showing pieces of evidence to others (even suspects) may have a useful
effect. Other people may make discoveries of their own which they  may
relate  to  you.   It  is  altogether  proper  to ask to be shown such
findings. 


Suspects: 

It is possible to ask people for information. However, be  aware  that
their  answers,  while  often  helpful, may be self-serving, false, or
contradictory.  Remember at  all  times  that  you  are  dealing  with
people----some  of  whom are under great pressure or emotional strain.
The most extreme care must be exercised when your ACCUSE people. 


The Police Laboratory: 

The facilities of the nearby police laboratory are always available to
you. Fingerprints found on objects can be compared with those  of  the
principals,  which  are  on file at the lab, simply by instructing the
lab to FINGERPRINT the object in question.  you can ANALYZE an  object
in  a  routine  manner or FOR a specific substance. Sergeant Duffy, as
diligent an assistant as can be found the annals of criminology,  will
take  objects  to the lab for you and return with the results, usually
within half an hour. 


Procedure for Making Arrests: 

When you feel that you have established a convincing case against  one
or  more  people,  you may decide to ARREST them. (A single individual
must be in your presence to be arrested;two or more  accomplices  need
not  be.)  After some soul-searching, you may realize that you haven't
nearly enough evidence to substantiate the charge, and may hold off at
the last moment.  Otherwise,  Sergeant  Duffy  will  arrive  with  the
handcuffs  and  take  the accused into custody.  Your role in the case
will then be concluded, and  you  will  receive  a  letter  from  your
superiors  indicating the outcome of the grand jury investigation, and
if all goes well at that level, the trial  itself.  Should  the  grand
jury  fail to indict or the trial jury fail to convict, your superiors
will try to indicate the reasons for the failure of the state's  case.
(Since  guilt  must  be  established  beyond a reasonable doubt, it is
important to demonstrate the three crucial  elements;  means,  motives
and opportunities.) But take heart from any failures you may have--the
sleuth  who  learns  from  his  mistakes  will  sleuth  all  the  more
effectively his next time on  the  trail.   There  are  many  possible
endings to your case, each determined by your handling of the case and
the  conclusions  you  draw  from the evidence you gather. But just as
there exists the perfect crime, there is also the perfect solution  to
a crime. 



 Strategies for Novices: 

Many  detectives  start  an investigation by "casing" the scene of the
crime.  This facilitates movement as the case proceeds.In this regard,
it is useful to draw a map or blueprint indicating the  directions  of
travel  between  the  various  places  in  the  area. It is especially
important to examine potentially  important  pieces  of  evidence.  Be
liberal  in  the  use  of  the  police laboratory in FINGERPRINTing or
ANALYZing laboratory's findings. 

Ask people questions about the crime itself, other people involved  in
the  case,  or  unusual  words  which  may  turn  up on evidence or in
conversation. Often, this will uncover contradictions or lead  to  new
evidence. 

Pay attention when people's behavior changes. It may be that they have
learned something which will affect their actions.  FOLLOWing them may
be  helpful,  but  often  it  is better to observe at a safe distance.
Show  relevant  evidence  to  interested  persons.   They  may   learn
something  which  could  cause  them to react in a helpful manner.  If
another person has found something, ask  to  see  it.   Although  care
should  be  taken in making accusations, especially without sufficient
evidence, a timely accusation can lead the presumed criminal  to  make
careless mistakes. 


CHAPTER II

How to Use Computers in Detective Work-

It  is  possible  to  conduct  an entire investigation without leaving
one's computer, here are some useful pointers on dealing with our  new
environment. 

Doing the Legwork: 

To  walk  from place to place, say WALK and the direction in which you
wish to proceed. There are ten  possible  directions:   NORTH,  SOUTH,
EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, UP & DOWN Each
of  these directions can be abbreviated to one or two letters (e.g.-N,
SE, D) When you enter a particular place for the first time, survey it
in detail.  Note its name (e.g.-the living room),its layout , and  all
objects located there which might be of interest. Whenever you return,
you  will  instantly  recall  the  name of the place and your eye will
catch any significant object.  In order  to  examine  the  place  more
fully, you have only to say LOOK AROUND (or something similar). 

Handling Evidence: 

To  handle  any of the various pieces of evidence, simply refer to the
object by its name. Should there  be  several  objects  of  same  type
(e.g.-two tables), just add a descriptive word (e.g.- THE LONG TABLE).
Here   are  some  ways  in  which  other  investigators  have  handled
evidence: 

TAKE THE PENCIL
PUT DOWN THE CUP OF COFFEE
SIT DOWN ON THE SOFA
EXAMINE THE DETECTIVE MAGAZINE
LOOK BEHIND THE PAINTING 
SEARCH NEAR THE SCUFF MARKS
TAKE EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE FISH BOWL AND THE ANTIQUE ROCKING CHAIR

Don't hesitate to handle more than one object at a time. Just be  sure
to separate their names by a comma or the word AND: 

PUT THE WRAPPER, THE TICKET, AND THE NAIL FILE ON THE DRESSER

Dealing with Suspects and Other People: 

The  best  authorities  recommend  courtesy  as  a  key to winning the
confidence of those you encounter while  conducting  police  business.
For   instance,  speaking  to  people  from  a  distance  is  strongly
discouraged. If you need to get the attention of someone  who  is,say,
down  a  hall  or  corridor, simply remark, MRS. JONES!  If you cannot
resist the urge, you may even say HEY, MRS. JONES! 

Once you an another  person  are  in  the  same  place  ,you  can  ask
questions  or ask that person to do something for you.  However, there
are "only two" types of questions that will be answered; those dealing
with information about someone or something, and those concerning  the
whereabouts  of  person  and objects. Again, courtesy is the key. When
addressing someone, precede  your  statement  or  question  with  that
person's name and a comma: 

MR JONES, TELL ME ABOUT MRS. JONES
JIM, WHO IS THE BUTLER?
SALLY, HAVE YOU SEEN MR. BRADY?
FRED, SHOW ME THE BULLET HOLES
MR. GILES, GIVE ME THE GUN

Once  you  are  engaged in conversation with someone, you can skip the
formality and simply state requests. However,  when  your  the  person
with whom you are speaking moves to a different place, it is proper to
re-initiate your interview by using the individual's name. 


Avoiding Tedious Interrogations: 

It  is  considered  extremely poor form to ask interrogative questions
which have already been asked by other police  officials.   Therefore,
you  are  supplied  with  any  relevant interviews obtained from other
police officials. Also, as noted in the preceding section, only a  few
types  of  questions will receive a response. When is is impossible to
elicit  a  response  to  a  question  that   seems   vital   to   your
investigations,  the  needed  information  will often be found in your
dossier. If not, you can assume the information is not important. 

Communication Your Intent: 

Clarity of speech is as import ant as clarity  of  mind  in  detective
work.  At times, you may happen to specify an action incompletely. For
example,  you might say KILL THE SUSPECT without indicating the weapon
you wish to utilize. In such  cases,  you  may  be  asked  to  make  a
clarification  (e.g.-  WITH  WHAT?)  Should this occur just answer the
question  (e.g.-  WITH  THE  REVOLVER).   If  you  specify  an  action
incompletely  in  a  situation  where  one thing may be assumed (e.g.-
there is only one weapon), you will be  informed  of  that  assumption
(e.g.-  WITH  THE  REVOLVER).  If  you  say  something which cannot be
understood because it is either too complex or improperly stated,  you
will be told of the problem. 

Flatfoot Computer Lingo: 

The  police  have  only  limited  resources and it computers often use
words which they cannot  understand.  Such  words  are  used  only  to
enhance your imagery and focus you deductive powers. 


Ending an Investigation: 

If you wish to terminate your investigation and not come back to it at
a  later  time,  you  can  type QUIT. Since a decision of this kind is
irreversible, you will have to confirm your decision. 

If you want to terminate your  investigation  by  starting  over  from
scratch, you can type RESTART. You will again be asked to confirm your
decision. 

Continuing an Investigation at a Later Time: 

If  you wish to suspend your investigation midway and continue it from
that point at a later time, type  SAVE  and  answer  the  question  as
described  on your Reference Card.  To return to your investigation at
another time, type RESTORE and answer the question as described in the
Reference Card. You may want to use this feature when you are about to
try something dangerous or irrevocable. 

Utilizing Stenographic Services: 

Depending on  you  hardware,  you  may  be  able  to  obtain  a  typed
transcript of your activities using the SCRIPT command. The transcript
may  be stopped with the UNSCRIPT command.  Consult reference card for
availability of this service on your system. 


CHAPTER III
Commonly Encountered Terms in Criminal Investigations----

REFERENCE CARD: 

Talking to the Game--
When  ever  you  see  the prompt ( > ), the game is waiting for you to
type up to two full lines of text at a time. If you  make  a  mistake,
use  the  left-arrow  key  to  erase the error. When you have finished
typing in your instructions, press  the  RETURN  key.  The  game  will
respond and then the prompt ( > ) will reappear. 

If  a  description  will not fit on the screen all at once (MORE) will
appear in the bottom left portion of the screen.   After  reading  the
part  on  the  screen, you will need to press the space bar to see the
rest of the description. 

The Status Line at, the top of the  screen,  you  will  see  a  status
line.   The line is updated after every move to show you current where
about in the game. Depending upon the type of game. it may  also  show
other information. 

Score --
In game that keep score, (e.g.-ZORK) the right side of the status line
will show something like this: 

 SCORE: 245/920

The  first  number  is you score and the second is the total number of
moves you have made. In the  example,  you  have  245  points  in  920
moves. 

Time--
In  games  that  keep  track  of  the time (e.g.- the mystery thriller
DEADLINE), the right side of the status line will look something  like
the following: 

 TIME: 9:22 AM

This show the current time of day in the game. 

SCRIPTing--
The  SCRIPT  function is an optional feature which is not necessary to
play the game, and may not be available with certain hardware. If  the
SCRIPT  command works with your hardware configuration, you may make a
transcript of the game as you play it. 

1. Turn on Printer
2. Load Game
3. Use SCRIPT command to start transcript
4. To stop transcript use UNSCRIPT command

SCRIPT & UNSCRIPT may be used as often  as  desired  as  long  as  the
printer is left on-line. 

Saving a Game Position--
WARNING***  The  diskette used for SAVE and RESTORE is maintained in a
special format and should not be used for any other  purpose.Files  of
any  other  kind  stored on the diskette will be destroyed by the SAVE
command. 

To SAVE current position use SAVE command. 

You can SAVE eight different positions on each disk and  RESTORE  them
in any order. 

To  keep track of these different positions, each is assigned a number
(from 0 -7). Each time you SAVE a game position, it will overwrite any
position that is already on you  storage  disk  with  the  number  you
specified.  If you want to SAVE more than one position, you must use a
different position number for each one. 

Prompt-- PLEASE INSERT SAVE DISKETTE
         POSITION (0-7) (DEFAULT=0)
         type number between 0-7

Follow prompts for 1 or 2 drives and when to insert disks. 

Restore a Saved Game Position--
To restore  a  previously  saved  game  position,  enter  the  RESTORE
command, then follow save steps for SAVE instructions. 


STORAGE,  OR  SAVE  DISK  ARE  MADE  USING  THE  STANDARD  APPLE  DISK
INITIALIZATION PROCESS.....SEE DOS MANUAL FOR FURTHER HELP

Trouble shooting--

If the game fails to SAVE/RESTORE: 

1. Check to see if drives are connected properly
2. Check to see if disk was inserted properly
3. Inspect disk for damage (visible damage)
4. Be sure disk is in proper drives
5. SAVE- be sure disk is not write-protected
6.  "  - be sure disk has been initialized properly, as last resort
   try a different disk
7. If you turned off the Apple or hit RESET, reload game
