"Leap Frog" -- a second pre-release version of a multitasking program
by

        Note on this release--Pre-release means that it works but not all
the time.  A lot more programs will run successfully under this version,
but I would not (I must emphasize this) use Leapfrog in a situation where
valuable data could be lost.

        "Leap Frog" is a program which allows up to eight other programs to run
all at the same time!  It is like a combination of Multifinder and Switcher,
with some advantages all its own.

        What is new in this (pre-)release:  Resource-oriented programs should
now run more successfully, including AppleWorksGS.  Also, the Finder will run
under Leapfrog (though I suggest that you make Leapfrog the Start program,
and rename the finder to "finder" if you want to try this).  You cannot run
other applications from the finder by double clicking on an icon.  All that
will happen is the finder will start to shut down and the system will crash.
Probably, though I will prevent the crash in a future version, Leapfrog will
never allow finder to run other programs.  If Apple wants true MultifinderGS,
they can pay me to edit Leapfrog hooks into their finder code, otherwise
there isn't much I can do short of writing a program to patch finder, something
that strikes me as a stupid way of doing things.

        How to use it--Run the program leadfrog from GS/OS 5.0.2 or later.
It will bring up its menu bar, which has apple, file, edit, and applications
menus.  You may then procede to open applications with the open menu item.

        Shelling out of a program--press Control-@ at any time to return to
the standard Leap Frog menu bar.  Use the applications menu to get back to the
program you want, open another application, or whatever.

        Selecting windows--like Multifinder (on the Mac), if you click on a
window, the application owning that window becomes active.  This does not work
while the Leap Frog menu bar is visible, only when an opened application is in
control.

        Quitting--quitting from a program should return you to the Leap Frog
menu bar.  All other programs opened should be accessable through the
applications menu.

        How it works--Leap Frog uses patched to TaskMaster and GetNextEvent to
allow all opened programs to run at once.  Only the "hot" program (the one
owning the top window) will receive input, but all others will continue to
operate, thus allowing any number of different activities (animation, sound
generation, computation) to take place in the background.

real soon now.)
