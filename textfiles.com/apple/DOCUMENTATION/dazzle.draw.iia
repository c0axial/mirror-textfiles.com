This  section  is  designed  both  as  a step-by-step guide to all the
features in Dazzle Draw for beginners, and as  a  reference  guide  to
particular features of the program for experienced Dazzle Drawers.

               |             Paint Brush             |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Paint  Brush  lets  you  paint with a wide variety of solid colors and
patterns. You can add text and even create lines, ovals and rectangles
at the touch of a button. 

Here's how to use Paint Brush: 

1. Pull down the Tools menu and select Paint Brush. 

2. Select either the solid color or pattern option. 

3. Select a color or pattern.  If you've chosen  patterns,  click  the
mouse over the "up" or "down" scrolling arrow to view all the patterns
possibilities, six at a time. 

4. Select a brush shape. 

5. Select a brush size. The smallest brush size you can use with solid
colors is one pixel. 

6. Move the cursor, now shaped like the tip of a paint brush, onto the
drawing area, and press the mouse button to begin drawing. 

7.  Release  the  button when you want to stop drawing and to move the
cursor around the screen without leaving a trace. 

8. To erase, select black or the color  of  your  background  and  the
brush size and shape with which you want to erase. 

9.  With  the  mouse  button pressed down, sweep the cursor across the
area you want to erase. 


Hints: 

1. To draw straight vertical or  horizontal  lines,  press  the  "Open
Apple"  key ("Closed Apple" if you're using a drawing pad or joystick)
while you move the brush.  This feature is called "constrain." You can
also use this feature inthe Spray Paint mode and, as you'll soon  see,
when drawing Shapes. 

2.  Your  brush  tip  is  displayed in a contrasting color so that you
won't "lose" it on a background of the same color.  Occasionally,  you
may  want  your  brush displayed in the current color, rather than the
contrasting color. press the spacebar  to  switch  between  these  two
options.

               |              Spray Paint            |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Spray paint is primarily a shading tool that lets you apply colors and
pattern  in  any  density.  You can adjust the spray to four different
shapes. 

Here's how to use Spray Paint: 

1. Pull down the Tools menu and select Spray Paint. 

2a. Using solid colors: If you are filling a solid color with  another
solid color, the "Fill" and "With" boxes both are pre-set to the solid
option,  so all you have to do is select a color, then click the mouse
over the area that you want to fill that color with. 

2b. Using patterns: If  you're  filling  with  a  pattern  or  over  a
pattern,  you  must tell the computer. To do so, first click the mouse
option next to the computer. To do so, first click the mouse  over  he
solid  or  pattern option next to the "Fill" box to indicate what type
of area you plan to fill. Then click over the solid or pattern  option
next  to  the  "With"  box.  Now  select the pattern or color from the
palette that you ant to fill with. If you are filling over a  pattern,
the cursor will change to a dotted-line box.  Click the mouse over the
area that you want to fill. 

Note  -  The  dotted-line  box  shows  what  Dazzle Draw "sees" as the
pattern it will cover

               |                  Zoom               |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

The Zoom feature lets you magnify a small segment of your  drawing  so
tat  you  can do fine detail work by adding and deleting colors, pixel
by pixel. You can work in even finer details with the color option  in
the  Goodies  menu  turned off. The Grid function, also in the Goodies
menu, can further enhance your Zoom work. 

Here's how to magnify a section of your drawing: 

1. Pull down the Tools menu and select the Zoom feature. 

2. A dotted-line box will appear on the screen. 

3. Move the box to the area you want to magnify by pressing the  mouse
button  and  dragging the box to the section you want to magnify. Then
click the mouse. 

4. The selected area will be placed in the Active box. It also will be
enlarged to fill up the entire drawing area, so  you  can  modify  the
drawing pixel by pixel. 

5.  While  you're working, you can redefine the section you're working
on by using the "zoom scroller," a device that appear in the Zoom tool
window. The  zoom  scroller  is  like  a  joystick  that  directs  the
positioning of the magnified working area.  Simply point the cursor at
the dot in the center of the zoom scroller and press the mouse button.
Then move the cursor in the desired direction. 

Working  in  your  magnified  section,  here's  how  to add the delete
colors: 

1. Pick a color. 

2. Move the cursor to the pixel you want to color and click the mouse.
To color more than one pixel, simply hold down the button while moving
the mouse until you've filled in all the pixels. 

3. If you change your mind and want to erase  this  color,  click  the
mouse  over  the  pixel or pixels you have that color. The pixels will
turn black.

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Using the Text feature, you can add words to your  drawing.  You  have
your  choice  of  two  type  fonts  (Modern or Serif) and three stylus
(Plain, Bold, or Italic). In addition, you can choose  two  sizes  for
each font: 18 or 36 Point for Modern and 24 or 48 Point for Serif. 

If you want to add text to your drawing: 

1. Pull down the Tools menu and select Text. 

2.  The  Text  Tool  window  will appear, displaying the current font,
size, and style. You can change any of these settings by clicking  the
mouse  over  the current choice. The available options will appear one
at a time. 

3. Move your cursor to the position where you want your text to begin,
and click the mouse. This position the text cursor at the place  where
the character type will begin.

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Shapes  lets  you  add squares, circles, ovals, and rectangles to your
drawing. You can  choose  solid  shapes,  outlined  shapes  with  four
different border thicknesses, plus 16 colors and 30 patterns. 

Here's how to use the Shapes feature: 

1. Pull down the Tools menu and select Shapes. 

2. Select the outline or filled oval or rectangle. 

3. Pick a border thickness if you've chosen an outlined shape. 

4. Move the cursor to the drawing area. 

5. Press the mouse button and drag cursor to create the size shape you
want, and then release the button. 

Note  -  To  draw a perfect circle or a square, press the "Open Apple"
key ("Closed Apple" when  using  a  drawing  pad  or  joystick)  while
defining an oval or rectangle.

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Dazzle Draw's Edit  menu  gives  you  the  option  of  "editing"  your
drawing.  Using  the  Capture  feature,  you  can  "capture"  specific
sections of your drawing and then erase, move, or duplicate them.  You
can  even  "invert"  colors  in a captured section or flip the section
vertically or horizontally.  With  Capture  and  the  Exchange  Colors
feature, you can replace one color with another within any section. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |               Capture               |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

The  Capture  feature lets you define a section of your drawing on the
screen and place it onto  the  computer's  invisible  "clipboard"  for
later  use.  The  Capture  feature must be used before you can use the
Flip, Invert Colors, Cut,  Paste,  Copy,  Exchange  Colors,  or  Clear
Section features. 

Here's how to capture a section: 

1. Pull down the Edit menu and select Capture. 

2.  Move  the cursor to any corner of the section you want to capture,
and then press the mouse button. Drag the cursor a little and a small,
dotted-lined box appears on the screen. 

3. While continuing to hold down the mouse button, move the  mouse  so
that the dotted line surrounds the area you want to edit. 

4. Release the mouse button. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |             Flip Section            |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

With  this  feature, you can flip a section of your drawing vertically
or horizontally. 

1. Capture the section you want to change. 

2. Select Flip Horizontally or Flip Vertically from the  Capture  tool
window. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |            Invert Colors            |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

The  Invert  Color feature lets you change colors in a section of your
drawing to their "opposite" colors (such as white to black). 

1. Capture the section where you want to invert colors. 

2. Select the Invert Colors option from the Capture tool window. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |            Cut and Paste            |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Using the Cut and Paste features together, you can remove the  section
you captured and reposition it in another area of your drawing. Here's
how to do it: 

1. Capture the section you want to reposition. 

2.  Select  Cut  from the Edit menu or type "x" on your keyboard.  The
captured section will be lifted off you screen  and  placed  onto  the
clipboard. In its place will be a black space. 

3. Select Paste or type "v". 

4.  Press  the mouse button and drag the cursor (which now look like a
right angle to indicate the lower right corner of the section you cut)
to where you want the section to be relocated. Then release the  mouse
button. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |           Copy and Paste            |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

With  the  Copy  feature,  you can reproduce a section of your drawing
without removing it and, by using  Paste,  place  the  duplicate  onto
another part of your screen. Here's how: 

1. Capture the section you want to copy. 

2.  Select  Copy  from the Edit menu or type "c." The captured section
will be copied off the screen and placed on the computer's  clipboard.
This  time  you  won't  see  a black space replacing it - the original
remains on the screen. 

3. Press the mouse button and drag the cursor to  the  location  where
you want a copy of the section to appear. 

4. Select Paste or type "v." The cursor now looks like a right angle. 

5.  When you move it to where you want the copy to go, press the mouse
button. As you hold down the button, you can drag the image for  exact
positioning. Then release the button. 

6. To make multiple copies, type "CTRL-V" each time you want a copy to
be pasted to the screen.
