   Here is the last update of Disk Disintegrater DeLuxe.  Version 4.2 is much
easier to use and much faster.  Many improvements have been made to D.D.DeLUXE:

1) Now, D.D.DeLUXE can pack the track volume # of 5.25" disks.  Note: the
   volume # is not the prodos volume, it's the track volume (the track volume
   is an old technique used by DOS 3.3 to format tracks of 5.25" disks, but not
   used by prodos).
2) In partial catalog mode, you may configure D.D.DeLUXE to show not only
   DIR and DDD files, but also REL and TXT files.
3) You can configure your D.D.DeLUXE to scan or not, your 5.25" drives
   (scan = search for a prodos disk volume).
4) You can also configure it to scan or not, all your devices connected to your
   Apple //.
5) When you unpack a DDD file and format the target disk, D.D.DeLUXE
   unpacks it much faster than V4.1 or V4.0.  Take note when you
   unpack a DDD file type ".A " (5.25" disk), D.D.DeLUXE will format
   your target disk automatically (it's necessary because of the track volume      #).
6) You can now use all the prodos commands in pack and unpack option.
7) In the main menu, you can quit D.D.DeLUXE quickly by pressing CTRL-Q. 
8) Like version V4.1, V4.2 can unpack old DDD 2.1 files.
9) There are also many other modifications you will discover using this
   program.



Notes:
------
a) When will run D.D.DeLUXE V4.2, you will have to re-configure it because
   V4.2 do not use the same configuration file as V4.1 or V4.0.

b) If you use the loading file "D.D.DELUXE.LOAD", you must replace it by the
   new one.

c) All DDD files packed with V4.0 and V4.1 are compatible with D.D.DeLUXE V4.2
   (V4.2 can unpack V4.0 and V4.1 DDD files).

d) To unpack old DDD 2.1 files, you proceed the same way you do with
   D.D.DeLUXE DDD files.

e) When you unpack an old DDD 2.1 file, there is no guarantee the unpacked
   disk is exactly the same as the original disk because there is no checksum
   in the old DDD file.  But if you unpack a new DDD file (type $DD, with
   message in the file), if D.D.DeLUXE unpack without checksum error, you can
   be sure your unpacked disk is exactly the same as the original disk.

f) Last note: For the moment, the documentation has not been updated to V4.2.
   The present documentation is for D.D.DeLUXE V4.0.
