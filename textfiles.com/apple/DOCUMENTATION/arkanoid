        The intergalactic carrier Arkanoid travels through the outer reaches of
        the galaxy, carrying planet Earth's remaining human survivers. They
        encounter DOH, a complex entity of incredible power. As the carrier
        falls prey to his attack, the crew escapes in the "Vaus" and enter a
        demention of living energy! The battle for freedom takes place over 33
        levels of complex and intricate barriers. Will you survive the final
        onslaught of DOH?

        Move the Vaus left and right. Use you skills to deflect an energy ball
        will gradually destroy the walls confronting you. Grey energy blocks
        must be hit more than once; some energy blocks are indestructible.
        Alien life forms randomly descend to hinder you. Eliminate them on
        contact with an energy ball or the Vaus.

        B       (Pink)  Advances you to the next level
        C       (Green) Catch the ball, move to a new position and fire
        D       (Lt Bl) Gives you three energy balls instead of one

STEREO CARDS

        This game supports several stereo cardes, such as the SUPERSONIC from
        MDIdeas. When this type of card is installed, Arkanoid provides rich
        stereo sounds for you listening enjoyment.

HINTS AND TIPS

        o The dividing capsule is very usefull if your ball is caught behind
          or enclosed within a wall.

        o The laser is useful for breaking down energy block that require a
          number of hits.

        o Use the very edge of your Vaus to deflect the ball and give it a
          sharper angle for maneuvering into restrictive places.
