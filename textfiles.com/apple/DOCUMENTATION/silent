    The actual playing of the game is very simple since Silent Service is
almost totally mouse controlled.  What I will be doing is giving a description of
each command and its uses.

Scenarios:  This is the first options you will see when booting up the game.

       Torpedo/Gun Practice: This option places you outside the American
                             base at Midway Island.  Four ships are anchored
                             here all you have to do is blow them up.

       Convoy Actions:  Here you have an actual fight.  You have to destroy
                        all the ships.  Watch out for destroyers because they
                        attack back.

       War Patrols:  This is comprised of several convoy actions. In this
                     option you must find the ships.  Here you have a limited
                     amount of fuel (55 days).  When finished return to base.

Difficulty Levels:  After choosing a senario you will be taken to another menu.
                    This menu has options that affect the games difficulty.

       Skill Level:  Range: 1-4; 1= Midshipman, 2= lieutenant, 3= Commander
                     4= Captain.  The levels affect accuracy of torpedos,
                     damage from depth charges, skills of enemy lookouts and
                     sonar operators as well as other factors.

       Reality Levels:  These also contol difficulty and also amke the game
                        more realistic.

              1. Limited visibility:  If selected ships that are beyond sonar
                                      and radar range will not appear on maps

              2. Covoy Zig-Zags:  Convoys will change course at regular
                                  intervals if selected.

              3. Dud Torpedoes:  Torpedos will launch but don't explode.

              4. Port Repairs only:  Once something is destroyed it may not be
                                     repaired.

              5. Expert Destroyers:  Certain enemy convoys will be escorted
                                     by expert destroyers.

              6. Convoy Search:  Convoys won't always appear in radar range.
                                 Convoys can be sighted by doing a 360 degree
                                 periscope/binocular sweep of the horizon.

              7. Angle-On-Bow Input: The computer will no longer calculate
                                     the angle for torpedo shots.  You must
                                     enter the angle yourself based on
                                     periscope observations. This option is
                                     for experts only!

Terminology

Port:  The left side of the ship
Starboard:  The right side of the ship
Bearing:  The direction you are looking
Heading:  The direction your ship is going

The Game:  After choosing all the levels you will be taken to the actual
game.  It will eventually take you to an inside view of the submarine.  From
this option page you can select yout next move by moving to the mouse
tocertain locations on the graphic.  The options are: go to bridge (can only
be done if surfaced), examine maps and charts, quatermasters log, damage
reports, instuments and guages.  You can also continue patrol in the war
patrol option and quit to main menu in the other modes.

     Bridge:  From the bridge you can fire torpedoes and the gun.  You can
              also vary the speed of the sub from full reverse to full foward.
              The sub can dive from this screen.You can also change the
              direction of the sub and use the biniculars and also change the
              time mode.  You can also identify the enemy ship when it is in
              you binocular or periscope sights on target ( the ship is on
              target the sight turns white).  To identify the target move the
              mouse pointer the large box and click the mouse.

     Periscope:  This option is the same as the bridge options.  The periscope
                 can be used up to 44 feet below the water.  When under water
                 the gun can not be used.  It can also not be used at night.

     Maps: This option allows you to navigate the sub.  You can also use the
           three zoom levels to locate ships.  The time mode is very
           important for speeding up the process of approaching ships.  Time
           mode 1 is normal (one minute game time takes 15 seconds).  Each
           increase in time scaling doubles the speed. Time mode 4 is 32
           game time.

Special Commands and descriptions

     Torpedo:  Your sub has 24 torpedos, 14 foward and 10 aft(back).  A
               topedo is fired by clicking the mouse on the torpedo graphic.
               A torpedo has an the most effective range between 1000 and
               4000 yards.  After firing several torpedos.  Only 4 torpedos
               can be active at once.  If more are fired the earlier ones
               will stop before hiting their target.  After firing several
               the screen will say bow torpedos or aft torpedo tubes broken
               or empty.  You will have to wait to use these again (10
               minutes) or you can rotate you ship 180 degrees and use your
               other set of torpedo tubes.

     Deck Gun:  The deck gun has an effective range of 8000 yards.  You start
                with 80 shells.  The main purpose of the gun is to destroy
                damaged ships.  The gun has alomost no effect on destroyers,
                but work quite well on tankers and troop transports.  The gun
                can only be used when surfaced.  If a ship is approaching you
                want to decrease the gun deflection.  "-" decreases gun
                deflection, the "=" key increase gun deflection.  Use the the
                = if the distance is increasing.  Each time you press the key
                the deflection increases or decreases 25 yards.  Example:  If
                a destroyer is moving towards you at 18 knots at a distance
                of 4000 yards it will move over 200 yards before the
                projectile would hit it.  Therefore a deflection of -200 to
                -250 yards should be selected before firing.  When the ship
                is 2000 yards away the deflection should only be a 100 yards.

     Battery:  The subs battery is capable of running for 1 hour at flank
               speed  when under water and several hours at lower speed.  The
               battery recharges when the sub is surfaced.

     Blow Emergency Tanks:  Control E does this.  You use this option only
                            when you sub is in a fatal dive.  This will
                            usually bring you to the suface.  You can use
                            this only once per battle.  Once used you will
                            not be able to dive again.

     Release Fake Debris:  "?" accomplishes this.  This also can only be used
                           once.  This used to fake destoryers into believing
                           that the sub was destoryed.

     Volume:  As you all know the volume can be controlled through the
              the control panel.  You can also use the "v" key.  This will
              allow you to select low, medium, high, or off for the volume.

Convoy Action Scenarios:  These senarios have various types and amounts of
                          of ships to fight.  Some are harder than others.

     Plunger in the Inland Sea: (day/submerged) You will fight an escorted
                                cargo ship.  You will be fighting moving
                                ships.  They will also change direction.

     Wahoo vs. Convoy:  (day/surfaced) You will have to destroy an unescorted
                        group of ships, but time is of the essence because a
                        destroyer is on the way.

     Hammerhead at Borneo:  (night/radar) In this scenario you will be
                            intoduced to night combat.  Avoid being as long
                            as possible.  Approach at moderate speeds.

     Searaven at Toagel Mlingui:  (endaround)  You are in a bad position
                                  against a convoy.  You must meneuver around
                                  the enemy to get a good attack.

     Tautog at Night:  (radar/visual night)  Here you can approach the convoy
                       but more care must be taken since there is good
                       visiblity this night.

     Grayback in the China Sea:  (submerged radar) A very difficult scenario.
                                 Three radar equipped destroyers are guarding
                                 the convoy.  The best plan of attack is to
                                 use you periscope in a dawn or dusk attack.
