GRAFEDIT
By: Philip Guiochon

GRAFEDIT can be used with keyboard, joystick or mouse, although some operations operate from keyboard only, as you will see.  If you have a mouse card in your Apple, you may hit ESCAPE when prompted to do so in order not to use the mouse. A whole picture is devoted to menu, which is made up of icons.  The icons are explained below.

Here are cursor moves with keyboard :

NOTE: Because of proportional spacing the following may look strange on the screen.  A Printed copy of this documentation will shoe correct spacing.

     W             I
   A   D         J   L
     S             K

Use with or without CONTROL for faster movements in some cases.  In all options, RETURN (or button 0 or a press on mouse) means "GO" while ESCAPE (or button 1) means "OUT".  With some functions, you will have to crop picture with following moves (some with CONTROL to go faster) :

              W
      -----------------
      :       S       :
      :               :
    A : D           J : L
      :               :
      :       I       :
      -----------------
              K

A little practice will show it is convenient, fast and easy!  Do not forget that cropping is done only by keyboard!  To go to picture after having selected a function, go to the lowest part of picture (on line 191) and press RETURN (or button or mouse).  

Color selection is a little strange: work color is composed of one color for even Y and one color for odd Y.  You have: color1+color2=work color. With cursor and RETURN (or equivalent), you have on screen:

back  advance  back  advance  result
col1  col1     col2  col2     color

Note that all plots are solid ones, to have some good control over color problems: therefore, GRAFEDIT works in 140 mode, although it could easily adapted to "normal" but awful 280 mode.

Functions are, from upper left to lower right (in nearly all cases, ESCAPE or equivalent is a UNDO function).  To go back to menu while working on a picture, place cursor at lowest part of screen (on line 191) and press RETURN.  In most functions, a zoom feature is available with the SPACE bar, while one also can toggle joystick/keyboard with the "!" key.

- erase screen in current color.

- cut window to create a window which can be saved and loaded later on.  Crop it with the frame.

- paste: show the current window on screen.  Then you can move it with A-S-D-W or I-J-K-L keys. ^T toggles bit 7, ^I inverse bits, ^R reverses it, ^F flips it, and four keys (; / > < on a II+) are used for rollings in four directions: which compensates for the byte operation.

NOTE: ^ = CONTROL

- text adding is easy: set cursor to position then RETURN. <- and -> arrows control case (for II+), while CONTROL with I, J, K and L does a bit movement.  Some control characters allow a II+ to generate non-keyboard characters.

- DOS 3.3 menu is obvious: hit key (inverse character means with CONTROL) then give filename if asked to.  RETURN to exit, or ^X).  Suffixes are automatic.  The "Command" prompt allows a DOS 3.3 command such as LOCK, DELETE, UNLOCK.  You can load and save 33 sectors pictures (".PI"), packed ones (".FC") or windows (".WI").  To save packed picture, just crop part of picture you want to pack, then hit RETURN and give a name.  ESCAPE cancels this operation.  Be careful, as windows and packed files share the same buffer!  RETURN alone exits DOS menu.

- point plots a point!

- draw draws continually until a RETURN.

- line wants a starting point and then a ending one, as in every graphics editor!

- lines links them automatically.

- fill allows you to fill on any standard primary color: it is fast and rather powerful.  In some cases (on complicated colors), it can "hang up": press any key to exit or to stop filling.

- circle: select center, then radius in relation to Y movement.

- disk: same as circle, but will be a solid circle.

- frame: obvious!

- box: idem!

- reverse: works on the Y axis after cropping.

- flip: works on the X axis.

- toggle toggles bit 7 which changes colors.

- inverse toggles all bits.

- clean is a very useful function: it can erase all colors, letting only outlines on screen.  Used with inverse, it allows to wipe out colors without having to redraw everything.

- shrink is a mere gadget, creating four small pictures with four different masks: not very useful with Apple's low Hi-RES resolution!

- some brushes are here for the user: they work with functions like draw, plot, lines, frames, etc...

A zoom is available through SPACE key.  You can toggle joystick and keyboard input with the [!] key.

We suggest that these instructions be printed for reference while working on a picture.
