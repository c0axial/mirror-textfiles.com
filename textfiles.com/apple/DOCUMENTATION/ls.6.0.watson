          WATSON DOCUMENTATION
=======================================
         GENERAL DESCRIPTION

WATSON is a powerful assistant to THE INSPECTOR disk and memory
utility.  Like THE INSPECTOR, WATSON is permanent-- either on an EPROM
to be simply plugged into socket D0, or on disk ready to be merged with
Int Basic for loading on boot. WATSON augments many of THE INSPECTORS
commands--making them handier, more automatic, more complete.  For
instance, you can now increment or decrement buffer locations with a
single key-stroke.  The disk map now also displays free space remaining
on the disk.  You can even reconstruct a VTOC automatically. 

But WATSON brings along a whole new bag of tricks his very own.  A
Disassembler that displays ASCII, an instant hex/decimal/signed decimal
converter, the ablitity to EOR the buffer with any value, lock-out or
free-up specific sectors on a disk, follow a file sector-by-sector
automatically, and much more.  Browse through all the new commands in
this manual. You can now call for a jump to any of the nine of your own
subroutines.  If you enjoyed working with the INSPECTOR you'll love
WATSON.  When you quit WATSON, you can take a single-stroke Screendump
along with you back into Basic.  Or an automatic inverse display of all
control characters.  Together, WATSON and THE INSPECTOR give you by far
the most complete disk and memory utility for your Apple.

                   ACCESSING WATSON

WATSON is always in memory and available for use, WATSON can be used in
a number of different APPLE configurations.  Since erach is slightly
different there are a number of distinct procedures to be used depending
on the ocmputer configuration you are using.  To access WATSON proceed
as specified for the Apple configuration which you are using. 

A. APPLE II STANDARD (INT VERSION)

FROM         TO          TYPE
----------------------------------------
INTEGER   WATSON  CALL-12288
MONITOR   WATSON  C081  D000G
APPLESOFT WATSON  CALL-151 C081 D00G

B. APPLE II+ 


FROM         TO          TYPE
----------------------------------------
INTEGER    WATSON  CALL-12288
MONITOR    WATSON  C080 D00G
APPLESOFT  WATSON  CALL-151 C080 D00G

WARNING!!!!!!! GOING DIRECTLY FROM APPLESOFT TO INTEGER WILL
DESTROY THE APPLESOFT PROGRAM IN MEMORY (HOPE YOU KNEW THAT
ALREADY).  TO PREVENT THIS GO FROM APPLESOFT TO MONITOR AND
THEN WATSON.

FROM          TO        TYPE
---------------------------------------

INTEGER     WATSON      CALL-12288
MONITOR     WATSON      CTRL-Y
APPLESOFT   WATSON      &

                     SCREEN DISPLAY

The screen display is the same as the INSPECTOR except for the version
#.  When first accessed the version number is different from the
INSPECTOR's.  This makes it easy to tell which program you are using.
The second difference will not be seen until the first sector is read
from the disk.  The version number will be blank, and a 4 diget HEX
number will appear in the upper right corner of the display.  This
number is a checksum for rhe current buffer.  This checksum is dependent
not only on values in the buffer, but also the order of the bytes.  Ths
means that if either the values or the order of the bytes is defferent,
the checksum will be different.  Using this checksum, it is very easy to
compare sectors to see if they are the same. 


             COMMANDS
             (FINALY)

+ = CONTINUOUS SCAN FORWARD

Causes WATSON to start scanning forwared sector by sector. When any key
is pressed, scanning will stop. 

- = CONTINUOUS SCAN BACKWARD

Same as above except backward. 

 .(period) = INCREMENT BUFFER

Increments the Buffer location by 1 page in memory.  For example, if the
buffer is currently set to $0800, pressing this key will change the
buffer to $0900. 

 ,(Comma) = DECREMENT BUFFER

Same as above. 

CTRL-E = EOR BUFFER

This command will EOR the entire buffer with any entered value.  Certain
programs encode information by using this method, causing the
information to be unreadable.  By using this command, these may be
decoded.  To use the command do the following: 

1. Press CTRL-E.  The cursor will move to the upper left. 

2. Enter value to EOR with and press return. 

CTRL-D = DISASSEMBLE WITH ASCII

Disassembles instructions starting at the Buffer Location. The ASCII
values of memory will be displayed in the right column.  This is very
Convenient for looking at data areas in Machine language programs. 

1. press "B"

2. select memory location

3. press ctrl-D

4. press any key to stop scrolling

5. press any key to start scrolling

6. press (RETURN) to exit

CTRL-B = BUFFER TEST PATTERN

Fills buffer location with the values $00-$FF.  Used to display
character sets, or testing. 

C = CONVERT HEX-DEC & DEC-HEX

1. PRESS "C"

2. ENER NUMBER TO CONVERT. REMEMBER SIGN ($,-)

3. NUMBER WILL BE DISPLAYED IN THRE FORMS. 

4. PRESS RETURN TO EXIT


M = MAP WITH FREE SPACE

This command is in THE INSPECTOR, but has been modified slightly.  after
pressing "M", a map will be displayed, an "M" will appear in the upper
left-hand corner of the map, and the free space on the disk will be
displayed at the bottom of the map, in the form of "F=xxx"

CTRL-T = DISPLAY ALL TRACK/SECTOR LISTS

Causes the disk to be scanned, and all sectors which could possilby be
Track/Sector Lists will be displayed on a map. This is very convenient
when trying to reconstruct a blow VTOC. To use this feature you should
follow these steps.....: 

1. Set the number of the track and sector you wish to begin scanning
from. 

2. Press "CTRL-T".  The screen will clear below line 3, and a blank map
will be displayed, containing a "T" in the upper left-hand corner.  As
WATSON scans the disk, sectors which may possibly be Track Sector Lists
will be displayed on the map. 

3. pressing any key will halt the scan. 

4. After the last sector is read on the disk, the scan will stop. 

CTRL-R = RECONSTRUCT VTOC

Reads the VTOC from a disk, then rebuilds the Track Bit Map from the
Catalog Track.  This is especially useful when a catalog is
reconstructed from a blown disk, or a file is undeleted. 

1. Insert the disk that you wish to be reconstructed in the drive 2.
Press ^R.  The Catalog Track will be read in the map.  All files will be
displayed as they are relocated 3. after the disk has stopped. The new
VTOC may be saved to disk by pressing ^W

NOTE:DISK MUST HAVE A READABLE VTOC. IF NOT COPY ONE FROM ANOTHER DISK. 

CTRL-K = KILL DOS ON DISK

Frees tracks 1 and 2 . 

CTRL-V = VERIFY THAT DISKS ARE ALIKE

This command may be used to compare two or more disks, and display a map
of any sectors which are not the same.  The first disk that is read will
be placed in memory with sector checksums. As further disks are
compared, their checksums will be compared to the previous disk, and any
differences will be displayed on a map..... 

1. insert disk

2. Set track and sector to start

3. Press ^V, map will be displayed if this is the second disk
differences will be displayed on map. 

4. Stop by pressing any key. 

CTRL-F = FILE FOLLOWER

Allows a file to be scanned sector by sector aautomatically, both
forward and backward.  This is accomplished by reading the Track/Sector
List for a file, which is then used by WATSON to read tin each sector of
the file. 

--> = Read next sector in file

Increments sector.  Is used with ^F to follow file.  The apple will beep
when you reach end of file. 

<-- = Read previous sector in file

same as --> but it decrements. 

CTRL/SHIFT-N = TEST OVERIDE

Pressing this will put WATSON in overide mode.  Normally for the File
Follower, WATSON checks to ensure that the Track/Sector list read in is
valid. This mode ignores that test, in case the Track/Sector list is
partially bad.  Using this command, it is still possible to partially
use the file follower command. 

Z = SET UP $300 TO TURN ON PRINTER

In THE INSPECTOR documentation, it was explained how to install a
routine at $300 to turn on the printer when ^Z is pressed.  This is used
for the Hex/Ascii and nibble dump commands.  By pressing z a routine
will be setup automatically to perform this function.  $2BA contains
printer slot. 

CTRL-S = SCREEN DUMP Performs a screendump when pressed. Anytime a
printout of the WATSON display is desired, pressing this will perform a
screendump. 

CTRL/SHIFT-M = PRINTER ECHO STATUS. 

If your printer doesnt need carriage returns this is used. 

CTRL-P = EXIT AND SETUP SCREEN DUMP

This command works much like the normal Screendump command, only it may
be used from outside WATSON.  After pressing ^P WATSON will return to
DOS.  Normal commands and programs can be run at this time, and a
Screendump will be performed whenever a ^Z is pressed. 

CTRL-O = EXIT AND OUTPUT CONTROL CHARACTERS

Exits WATSON, and causes all control characters displayed on the screen
to appear in inverse.  This will owork with DOS and normal programs.
This is helpful to find hidden ctrl characters. 

ESC 1-9 = USER FUNCTIONS

Just as ^Z command will perform any jump to a subroutine located at
$300, ESC 1 throught ESC 9 will perform jumps to user subroutines.
These jumps are specified by the bytes located at $3BE throgoughh $3CF
(lo/high)

Well I hope that helps all of you have needed WATSON docs.
