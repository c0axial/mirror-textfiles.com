Testing:
-------

Spooler.DA has been tested under the Merlin, APW/Orca, and ProSEL shells, as
well as the Finder as various other programs. Because of the nature of the
program, Spooler.DA is NOT guarenteed to work with all programs. In addition,
Bill Tudor is NOT responsible for any damages resulting from the use of this
program and/or instructions. Use at your own risk.

Limitations:
-----------

+ The Spooler.DA will only work under GS/OS. You cannot enter the CDA from
  ProDOS 8.

+ The Spooler.DA should continue background printing even if a ProDOS 8 program
  is run...but this has not been tested.

+ You CANNOT print to slot 1 while the spooler is running.

+ The spooler only works with Txt and Src files. Merlin Txt files will be
  expanded, as will tab characters. Any other control characters in the text
  are simply ignored.

+ You cannot disable VBL IRQ's while the spooler is running.

+ You MUST have enough free RAM to hold ALL of the files in the print queue.

+ Avoid the use of IRQ intensive programs (like communication programs) while
  the Spooler.DA is active.

+ Spooler _may_ have problems with programs that disable interrupts often or
  when running during large amounts of disk access.

+ Spooler will not work if the host program destroys background task queue.

1. Overview:
   ========

The Spooler.DA remains dormant in memory until a print session is active. You
can tell that a session is active by either observing the action of your
printer or listening for periodic 'clicks' of the IIgs speaker. When the
Spooler is active, it sends a line of text to the printer about once every
half-second. You may continue to use your IIgs normally while the spooler
sends information to the printer. When the print job is complete, the spooler
places itself back in a dormant state until it is again activatied via the CDA
menu.

2. Getting Started.
   ===============

Simply copy the Spooler.DA to your *:System:Desk.Accs folder on the system
disk and re-boot the computer.

2. Setting up the Print Queue.
   ==========================

Enter the IIgs CDA menu by pressing <command-control-esc> and select the CDA
called "Print Spooler". You will be presented with a main menu screen. The
menu lists all the files currently in the print queue, and provides options
for left margin, line numbers, adding a file to the queue, and deleting the
queue. The options are described below.

A. Adding a file to the queue [Option 1]
   -------------------------------------

- Selecting option [1] will cause the Print Spooler CDA to first prompt you
for the path of the file you wish to add tp the print queue. Select the
DIRECTORY (folder) that contains the file you wish to print. After the
directory has been established, you will be asked to select the filename. You
can press <ESC> at any time to return to the main menu.

The following command are available       | Note: Only files of type
when selecting the PATH (Directory):      | ----  DIR are shown.

      Path Selection Commands:
      -----------------------
Escape     =  abort; return to menu    oa-Period   =  abort; return to menu
Up Arrow   =  change last directory    Left Arrow  =  drop dir. from path
Down Arrow =  change last directory    Right Arrow =  append dir. to path
Tab        =  change disk drive        Clear       =  clear entire path
Return     = accept path as is

The following commands are available      | Note: Only files of type
when selecting the FILE:                  | ----  Src or Txt are shown.

      File Selection Commands:
      -----------------------
Escape     =  abort; return to menu
oa-Period  =  abort; return to menu
Up Arrow   =  change filename
Down Arrow =  change filename
Return     = accept the current filename

B. Deleting the print queue   [Option 2]
   -------------------------------------

- select option [2] to delete the entire print queue and start the file
selection process from the beginning again.

C. Printing line numbers      [Option 3]
   -------------------------------------

- select option [3] to toggle printing of line numbers on/off. If line number
printing is set to ON, all of the files in the print queue will be printing
with a line number at the begining of each line.

D. Left Margin                [Option 4]
   -------------------------------------

- Selecting option [4] will increase the left margin by 1 character at a time
up to a maximum of 8 characters. If this option is selected when the left
margin is already at 8 characters, the left margin value wraps back to 0.

E. Quiting                    [Escape  ]
   -------------------------------------

- Press ESCAPE to exit the Print Spooler CDA. If there are ANY files listed in
the print queue, background printing will begin. Printing continues until all
of the files in the queue are printed. You will here a click in the Apple IIgs
speaker every time the Spooler finishes a line (about every 0.5 seconds).

3. Cancelling a print job.
   ======================

If the Print Spooler CDA is entered while a print job is currently in session,
you will be asked if you want to cancel the print job. Selecting "Y" will
abort the current print job and allow you to setup a new print file queue.
Note that you may have to manually eject the final page from the printer.
Selecting "N" will exit the CDA and allow the current print job to finish up.

You CANNOT use the Print Spooler CDA while a print job is in session.


Enjoy!
