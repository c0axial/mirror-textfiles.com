Constructing Castles: 
--------------------
Bronze Dragon can generate adventure settings, called "castles," for 12
different scenarios. Like the module, you can use either side of the
castle disk to construct a castle. Unlike the module, you get to
customize a castle according according to your taste. 

There are a few limitations to this. Castles have a minimum of 10 rooms
and a maximum of 100 rooms. To get an entire plot, however, the castle
must have at least 60 rooms. 

Your castle will be constucted from your answers to the questions below.
Your replies are limited by previous answers. To illustrate, if you
choose to have 25 rooms per level, you can't have 8 levels below ground
(that would be more than 100 rooms). 


1> Rooms per level: Your answer can be any number from 10-30. This is
the number of "areas" on each level of the castle, whether they're
hallways, rooms, chambers, or whatever. 

2> Levels below ground: This can be any number from 0-10. This
determines the number of floors below ground level. 

3> Levels above ground: This can be any number from 1-10. Level 1 is
ground level. 

4> Starting monster level: There are ten different "levels" of monsters.
High level monsters are much harder to kill than low level monsters. You
are allowed to pick the level of the first batch of nasties loaded in
the castle. 

5> Difficulty: Difficulty ranges from 1-10. High difficulty means more
monsters and traps, but it also means more treasure. 


6> Plot number: Refer to appendix 1 to choose the appropriate plot. DO
NOT choose a "sequel" unless you have successfully completed the
preceding plot. 


You'll be told how many rooms are in your castle and whether or not it
contains the entire plot. You'll be asked if you still wish to make it.
If you do, just enter "Y" and follow the prompts. 

Your castle will be built from the bottom up. When the word "making" is
in the upper left-hand corner, the blueprint is being fashioned. When
the word "filling" is there, the rooms are filling with monsters and
treasure. It should take bout 15 minutes to construct a 60 room castle. 



Gathering a Party: 
-----------------
By now, you should have created and equipped a part of rouch and ready
characters. You've also either created a castle or copied the module on
a blank disk. It's time to gather your party (option 5 on Main Menu). 

You'll be shown the name of each character who's already in the party
(if any) and asked the name of each member who wants to join. After
you've entered the names, the computer will check to see if each
character is available. If som it will print "<Name> has joined". Any
character who is unavailable (i.e. dead or already on an adventure) will
not be allowed to join. 

When characters come back ot Dragon Village, they are dispersed. In
other words, they must re-gather before goin on another adventure. 

If you try to gather a party for an adventure that already has five
characters assigned to it, the computer will say the party is full.
Next, it will ask you if you wish to destroy the party by killing all of
the characters. If you decide to destroy the old party, you'll be able
to gater a new party for the adventure. 




Going On An Adventure: 
---------------------
After you've fathered your party, it's time to have some fun and
actually play the game (option 6 on the Main Menu). 



The Screen: 
----------
During play, there is a "menu window" at the top of the screen. These
four lines contain a lot of information. The top line shows the
character's na,e and which menu is up. The numbers of the left represent
the commands; the command you choose is highlighted to the ight. For
your convenience, the bottom line shows the character's hit points,
armor rank, and endurance. 

Don't be put off by the complicated looks of the window. Before long,
you7ll only need to glance at it for a moment to get the information you
need. 



The Controls: 
------------
The number, arrow, and letter keys all preform the same function,
highlighting commands. Choose the method of input which suits you best. 

0-9: Pressing any number will highlight a command. 

Arrow keys: These highlight commands left and right. The arrow heys must
be used to highlight a nimber higher than 9 when characters have more
than 9 objects in their inventeory. 

Letter keys: The first letter of each regular command also highlights
it. The two exceptions to this are "V" for look and "Z" for retreat. 

Return: Implements the highlighted command. 

Space bar: The space bar has two functions depending on when it's hit. 
     
     1> If you haven't chosen a command (pressed return), the space bar
     will toggle between the regular commands and special commands. 
     
     2> if you've chosen a command that affects another monster or
     character, the space bar will toggle between the name groups. 

Escape key: This key will abort almost any action in case you change
your mind. 
The slash key works the same way.. 

Ctrl-G: Toggles "group move" off and on. Group move is on when you
start, which means characters travel together. Characters can't toggle
this off during module play. 

Ctrl-T: Allows you to set the time delay, which is how quickly stuff
prints out.  Initially set to 25, it ranges from 0-50, with the lower
numbers increasing the speed. Zero time delay waits for you to press a
key. 

Ctrl-Q: Saves the game at its current place. This can only be done
durring the first character's turn. 

Ctrl-R: Reorders the party. This can only be done during the first
character's turn. 

Ctrl-D: Toggles the area description on and off. It is on when you
start. When off, it allows for faster movement through known areas. 



The Regular Commands: 
--------------------
The following is a list of the command options available when playing
Bronze Dragon. The numbers in brackets correspond to those in the menu
window. Some commands, such as search, will bring up another menu. 


1> Rest: The pause that refreshes. Resting regains some endurance for
weary characters. 

2> Fight: Fighting is attempting to strike a monster or character with a
weapon.  Your weapon must work in the rand you're in for your attack to
have a chance at success. See "How To Fight" and "Range."

3> Search: There are 4 different ways to search. 
     
     1) Search for objects: Let's talk treasure. If you want something
     that's in a room, this is the commands to pick it up. It'll also
     allow you to read a scroll or even push a button. 
     
     2) Search Creature: You can plunder dead monsters and characters. 
     
     3) Search for Secret Doors: Hidden exits can sometimes be detected
     using this command. High intelligence increases the chances of
     detection, and repeated searches increases it even more. 
     
     4) Search for Traps: The truly paranoid can check a room out if
     they suspect a trap. High intelligence and repeated attempts also
     improve the chances for detecting traps. 

4> Look: This will give you a description of you immediate surroundings
if there is sufficient light. Hitting space bar after the description
will let you see the exit locations and the monsters (if any). Since
"look" is automatically executed when you enter a room, mapping is
usually done at the very start. An important note: Any objects you
happen to see with "look" aren't necessarily the total contents of the
area. 

5> Diversion: This gives every character in the area except the diverter
a "+1" to hit on their next turn and allows assassins to assassinate. A
drawback, the dirverter draws the monster' attention. 

6> Advance: This is moving within a room toward a certain monster or
character, generally used to get in proper range for fighting. See
Range. 

7> Retreat: The opposite of advance. It can also be used to get in
proper range, especially when using weapons that won't function in short
range, such as a flail or javelin. See Range. 

8> Use Object: There are 5 different ways to use an object. 

     1) Unlock Item: An attemp to unlock some sort of container, suck as
     a chest or coffer with whatever is in hand. It is not used to
     unlock anything else (such as doors). Thieve's tools are the best
     at doing this, but you can use anything. 
     
     2) Use On Creature: This isusing the object in hand on a monster or
     character.  Food, elixer, and magic items work under this command.
     While food and elixer are benificial when used this way, magic
     items could be harmful. Your fellow characters probably wouldn't
     appreciate a "dancing sword" being used on them... 
     
     3) Examine Object: Finding out how unusual onjects work is one of
     the biggest sources of puzzlement for Bronze Dragon players. When
     you look at an object closely, you might discover something
     interesting or important. 
     
     4) Use On Your Possessions: This is using the object in hand on
     another object.  If you wanted to connect two rods together or put
     poison on a dagger, this is the command to use. See "Solving
     Plots."
     
     5) Use In Room: This is sort of the "default" command when you
     don't know what else to do. It could be unlocking a door with a
     key; using a want to levitate a rock, etc. See "Solving Plots."
     
9> Inventory: There are 5 sub-commands under inventory. 
     
     1) New in Hand: It is often necessary to put the proper object in
     hand before fighting, using an object, ect. This doesn't take up a
     character's turn. Once something is in hand, it will stay there
     until you say otherwise. 
     
     2) Status: This will tell you absolutely everything about your
     character's health and standing. 
     
     3) Get Rid Of: This command will erase the object of your choice,
     never to be seen again. It does not affect the object in hand,
     unless you happen to choose it for disposal. This command does not
     take up a character's turn. 
     
     4) Give Object: This command transfers one of your possessions to a
     monster or character of your choosing. Gifts often convince
     non-vile creatures to leave in peace. 
     
     5) Give Money: This works exactly like give object, except the
     medium of exchange is bronze pieces. 

0> Leave: Yep, the thrill of adventureing is right here: there's always
that last kill to climb or secret chamber you havn't seen yet.
Characters travel in a pack unless you toggle group move off with
Ctrl-G. Exits will appear on the numbers 1-4. If you're outside the
castle, "Go back to Dragon Village" will be at number 5. 

Special Commands: 
----------------
The regular commands on the preceding pages are available to any
character.  Hitting the space bar will toggle on a second menu, which
has the "special commands." Each character gets one command due to race,
as explained uder race in "How To Create A Character." The character's
class affords several additional commands which are detailed below. 

Knights: 

1> Swordplay: This adds a "+1" on the to hit roll for every two skill
levels of a knight. It also maximizes a sword's damage. This command
can't be used inless a sword of some type is in hand. 

2> Rage: Knights can attack at twice their normal rate with this
command, although it reduces endurance to zero. 


Assassins: 

1> Assassinate: Successfully using this command will instantaneously
kill any monster or character. To even have a chance at assassinating,
however two conditions must be met.... 

A) The assassin must have a dagger in hand. 
B) Someone else must divert or area must be dark

Once an assassin reaches the 10th skill level, condition B no longer
applies. 


Ninjas: 

1> Martial Arts: Martial arts are a special method of defense and
fighting.  There are 10 different levels of martial arts, called
disciplines, which range from Yeti to Dragon style. Each discipline has
3 modes: an attack, a strike, and a defense. Ninjas can master a maximum
of 5 modes, if they wish to learn more, they must replace one that they
have previously learned. The different modes are explained below, and
appendix 5 should further enlighten you. The best way to figure all this
out, of course, is to create a ninja and experiment. 

Attack modes: This is a short range attack that causes dammage if
successfully rolled, much like an ordinary weapon attack. A martial arts
attack does double damage if the creature attacked is covered under the
attack's discipline. A Yeti attack, for instance, does 1-10 damage
against everything except for monsters with a "freeze" attack. A hit
against such a creature would automatically do 20 points of damage. 

Strike modes: Strikes are short range attacks that will not affect
characters or monsters nor under the strike's discipline. If a strike is
used against a monster under the correct discipline, however, it will
automatically hit and cripple the monster. If a tiger strike, which
affects anthing that claws or bites, were used against a ghost, it would
have no effect. If it were used against a bear, however, the bear
couldn't use it's claw or bite. 

Defense modes0 Defense modes improve your armor rank (subtract from it)
in addition to making you invulnerable under the defense's discipline.
Their effects are cumulative, meaning that having both bear defense (-1)
and eagle defense (-2) would lower armor rank by three, in addition to
making one invulnerable to encircle and drain attacks. 

2> Leap: Like sneak, a successful leap moves a character across a room
without taking a turn. Ninjas can position themselves anywhere within a
room this way, but there is one drawback - the only action allowed at
the end of a leap is a martial arts attack or strike. First level ninjas
have a base 25% chance of leapping with bonuses added for high agility
and additional skill levels. 

3> Imitate Dead: If successfully done, a ninja us unable to do anything
for 4-6 turns after using this command. During the trance-like state,
neither monsters nor characters will strike the Ninja. Upon awakening,
the ninja will no longer be poisoned, illusioned, beserk, frozen, etc.
If you fail to imitate your chances at imitating dead. 


Elders: 

1> Sorcery: This is the act of casting a spell. Spells work at any
range, each for having a certain number of charges, or times it can be
used. If the charges are used up, the spell is gone and the caster will
regain the spell points used to learn the spell. Check appendix 7 for
details. 

2> Destroy: Any "undead" creature less powerful than the elder casting
this will be burned to ashes. Undead creatures are those who have lived
and died, yet still walk the earth. Typical undead monsters are ghosts,
devils, lethal deadlies, etc. Characters get no skill points for
destroying monsters. 

3> Innate Heal: This will heal chaacters whose hit pointsnow have falled
below 50% of hit point max. The side effect is that hit points max will
be lowered a little: Example: A knight named joey started an adventur



 with 100 "hit points now" and 100 "hit points max." Hit points now was
reduced to 40 by an ill-tempered fire beetle. An elder used innate
healing on Joey, which put both "hit points now" and "hit points max" at
90. 

Joey's hit points max isn't permanently crippled - both the healers and
king Leopold can fix him up. The healers do it for a price and Leopold
doesm if Joey brings him an artifact. 


Wizards: 

1> Sorcery: See sorcery under the elder's special commands. 

2> Cast Energy: This is a damaging attack that will function at any
range.  Damage is 10 times the Wizard's skill level, but if reduces a
Wizard's endurance to zero




Range: 
-----
Characters must be in proper range to fight. The proper range depends on
what weapon is being used (see appendix 3). The three ranges, short
range, medium range, and long range, are listed on the character and
monster screens.  There're abbreviated SR, MR, and LR, respectively. You
can move into the proper range by advancing or retreating. 

EXAMPLE: Arch Mage George wants to hit a giant rat with his lucern
hammer. He tries, but the rat is in medium range and hit hammer can only
hit monsters in short range. George has a choice - he can either advance
toward the rat and hit it next turn, or he could put a sling & stones in
hand and hit it this turn (A sling and stones works in medium or long
range). 



How To Fight: 
------------
Before you fight, you should put the proper object in hand. This is done
by hitting inventory and new in hand. 

The next step is pressing fight and choosing a victim, either a
character or a monster. You can toggle between the monster and character
names by hitting the space bar. Hitting escape aborts the fight
command. 

You can hit any number corresponding to a monster to see the creature's
name and range. When you find the monster you wish to strike, hit return
and the "attempt" will take place. 

Smack any key to freeze the rolling randomizer. Afterwards, any plusses
or minuses will be added to the number and if it's enough, you'll hit.
Good luck!
