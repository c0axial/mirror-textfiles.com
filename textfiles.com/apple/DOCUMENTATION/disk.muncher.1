                        CORRUPT COMPUTING



DISK  MUNCHER  IS  PROBABLY THE FASTEST COPIER AVAILABLE FOR THE APPLE
COMPUTER.  (THERE MIGHT BE  COPIERS  THAT  SACRIFICE  RELIABILITY  FOR
SPEED, AND ARE THUS FASTER.) DISK MUNCHER CAN COPY A DISK IN LESS THEN
30  SECONDS  WITH  INIT!  (ON  A 48K SYSTEM).  IF YOUR SYSTEM HAS MORE
MEMORY ADDED THRU ADDITIONAL RAM CARDS, DISK MUNCHER WILL BE  ABLE  TO
COPY  A  DISK  IN EVEN LESS TIME! WHILE DISK MUNCHER IS EXTREMELY FAST
AND RELIABLE, IT IS DESIGNED WITH THE USER IN MIND. DISK  MUNCHER  HAS
SUCH  USER FRIENDLY OPTIONS AS A CATALOG FUNCTION WITH DISK MAP, WRITE
VERIFY, SAVE-ABLE CONFIGURATION, STATUS INDICATORS AMONG OTHERS. 

BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN BEGIN TO USE DISK MUNCHER, YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW A
FEW BASIC THINGS ABOUT HOW DISK MUNCHER REFERS TO  YOUR  DISK  DRIVES.
THE  SOURCE  DISK  IS  THE  DISK YOU ARE COPYING FROM (USUALLY SLOT 6,
DRIVE 1) AND THE TARGET DISK IS THE DISK YOU ARE COPYING  TO  (USUALLY
SLOT 6, DRIVE 2). THE VALUES FOR SOURCE AND TARGET CAN BE CHANGED, BUT
WE WILL DISCUSS THAT LATER. NOW ON TO USING DISK MUNCHER. 

TO  START  DISK  MUNCHER ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TYPE "BRUN DISK MUNCHER
1.1" FROM DOS. ONCE DISK MUNCHER IS LOADED IN, IT  WILL  DISPLAY  THIS
MENU: 
               
               [1] CATALOG SOURCE DISK
               
               [2] CATALOG TARGET DISK
               
               [3] COPY DISK
               
               [4] BOOT DISK


SINCE  THE  FIRST  AND  SECOND OPTIONS ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL WE WILL BE
DISCUSSING THEM FIRST. WHEN YOU PRESS EITHER THE '1' OR '2' KEYS, DISK
MUNCHER WILL CATALOG WHAT EVER DISK IS  IN  THE  DRIVE  DESIGNATED  AS
SOURCE  OR TARGET. AFTER THE SCREEN IS FULL, DISK MUNCHER WILL ASK YOU
"PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE". AFTER YOU PRESS A KEY, DISK MUNCHER  WILL
CLEAR  THE  SCREEN, AND DISPLAY MORE FILES. THIS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE
UNTIL ALL THE FILES ARE DISPLAYED. AFTER ALL THE FILES ARE  DISPLAYED,
DISK  MUNCHER WILL ASK YOU TO "PRESS ANY KEY TO SEE MAP". IT WILL THEN
CLEAR THE SCREEN, AND DISPLAY A MAP OF WHAT SECTORS ARE FREE AND  WHAT
SECTORS ARE USED ON YOUR DISK. FREE SECTORS ARE DESIGNATED BY A SPACE,
AND  USED SECTORS ARE DESIGNATED BY A PLUS SIGN. THE CATALOG WITH DISK
MAP IS THE ONE FUNCTION OF DISK MUNCHER THAT SETS IT  APART  FROM  ALL
OTHER  "FAST"  COPIERS.  IT  ALLOWS YOU TO DETERMINE WHAT DISK YOU ARE
COPYING FROM AND WHAT DISK YOU ARE COPYING TO, IF THERE IS NO LABEL ON
THE DISK, AND YOU CAN DO IT WITHOUT EVER LEAVING DISK MUNCHER!.  NOTE:
SOME  DISKS  DO  NOT  HAVE  A CATALOG OR DISK MAP, OR THE DISK MAP MAY
APPEAR GARBLED.  IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO TELL WHAT IS ON  THE  DISK  FROM
THE  LABEL  OR  BECAUSE OF ONE OF THESE CONDITIONS, YOU ARE ADVISED TO
"BOOT" THE DISK TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT IT CONTAINS. 

NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO CATALOG A DISK, WHY DON'T WE LEARN HOW DO USE
THE ACTUAL COPIER! 

WHEN YOU PRESS "3" TO COPY A DISK, THE SCREEN WILL CLEAR AND  WILL  BE
DIVIDED  INTO  TWO  SEPARATE  SECTIONS.  THE LEFT SECTION CONTAINS ALL
MESSAGES, WHAT SLOT AND DRIVE THE SOURCE AND TARGET DISKS ARE IN,  AND
ALL  INFORMATION  ABOUT  RAM  CARDS. THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN IS A
STATUS AREA. IT SHOWS WHAT MODE THE COPIER IS IN, AND WHAT TRACK  DISK
MUNCHER  IS  CURRENTLY COPYING. WHENEVER DISK MUNCHER IS ACCESSING THE
DISK IN COPY MODE, IT WILL DISPLAY A "STATUS MARKER" NEXT TO THE TRACK
IT IS ON. THIS  IS  A  LIST  OF  WHAT  THE  DIFFERENT  STATUS  MARKERS
REPRESENT: 

          
          INVERSE R - READING FROM CURRENT TRACK
          INVERSE W - WRITING TO CURRENT TRACK
          INVERSE V - VERIFY WRITE TO CURRENT TRACK
          NORMAL  R - READ ERROR
          NORMAL  W - WRITE ERROR

BESIDES  THE  NORMAL STATUS INFORMATION, THERE IS ONE SUBTLE, BUT NONE
THE LESS IMPORTANT INDICATOR. YOU WILL NOTICE A SPACE REVOLVING AROUND
EACH OF THE SECTIONS. WHETHER THIS SPACE IS  REVOLVING  CLOCK-WISE  OR
COUNTER  CLOCK-WISE  DETERMINES WHETHER THE WRITE VERIFY IS ON OR OFF.
IF THE SPACE IS REVOLVING CLOCK-WISE, THE VERIFY IS OFF, IF THE  SPACE
IS REVOLVING COUNTER CLOCK-WISE, THE VERIFY IS ON. 


AFTER  DISK  MUNCHER  DISPLAYS  THIS  INFORMATION,  IT  WILL TELL YOU:
"<RETURN> BEGINS COPY, SPACE BAR CHANGES OPTIONS". AT THIS PROMPT, YOU
CAN PRESS RETURN, SPACE BAR , OR  CTRL-V.  CTRL-V  TOGGLES  THE  WRITE
VERIFY ON OR OFF. IF YOU PRESS RETURN, DISK MUNCHER WILL BEGIN COPYING
THE DISK. (NOTE: IF YOU ARE USING A ONE DRIVE SYSTEM IT WILL PROMPT TO
YOU  INSERT  THE  SOURCE  DISK AND PRESS RETURN. YOU WILL HAVE TO SWAP
BETWEEN THE SOURCE AND TARGET DISK. DISK MUNCHER WILL PROMPT YOU  WHEN
TO  CHANGE  DISKS.)  WARNING!: DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS VERY EASY TO
PUT  THE  WRONG  DISK  IN  THE  DRIVE,  YOU  ARE  ADVISED  TO  PUT   A
WRITE-PROTECT TAB ON THE SOURCE DISK TO PREVENT ACCIDENTAL ERASURE. 

IF  YOU  PRESS SPACE BAR TO CHANGE OPTIONS, DISK MUNCHER WILL MOVE THE
CURSOR TO THE SLOT OF THE SOURCE DRIVE. YOU CAN ENTER  A  NUMBER  HERE
BETWEEN  1  AND  7.  AFTER ENTERING THE SLOT NUMBER, DISK MUNCHER WILL
MOVE THE CURSOR TO THE DRIVE NUMBER. HERE YOU MAY ENTER EITHER A 1  OR
2.  AFTER  ENTERING  THE INFORMATION FOR THE SOURCE DISK, DISK MUNCHER
WILL MOVE THE CURSOR TO  THE  TARGET  DISK  INFORMATION  SECTION.  THE
ENTERING  CRITERIA FOR THE TARGET DISK IS THE SAME AS THE SOURCE DISK.
NOTE: IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE FEW PEOPLE THAT ONLY HAVE  ONE
DRIVE,  YOU  SHOULD  ENTER  THE  SAME SLOT AND DRIVE ( USUALLY SLOT 6,
DRIVE 1) FOR SOURCE AND TARGET DISKS. AFTER ENTERING  THE  INFORMATION
ABOUT  YOUR  DISK DRIVES, DISK MUNCHER WILL MOVE THE CURSOR TO THE RAM
CARD SECTION. THE PROGRAM CAN USE UP  TO  4  RAM  CARDS  IN  DIFFERENT
SLOTS.  DISK  MUNCHER WILL ONLY RECOGNIZE STANDARD 16K CARDS, MOST 32K
CARDS, AND RAM CARDS THAT BANK SELECT IN THE SAME FORMAT AS LEGEND AND
SATURN CARDS DO. (IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW YOUR RAM CARD  BANK  SELECTS,
TRY  ENTERING IT'S SLOT NUMBER ANYWAY. DISK MUNCHER WILL IGNORE YOU IF
THE RAM CARD IS NOT A LEGEND OR SATURN TYPE CARD.) NOTE: DISK  MUNCHER
WILL  NOT RECOGNIZE OR USE ANY RAM CARDS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE
APPLE IIE. BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL WAY THAT DISK MUNCHER COPIES A DISK,
YOU WILL NEED AT LEAST 224K IN ADDITIONAL RAM CARDS TO  COPY  A  WHOLE
DISK  INTO  A  RAM  CARD  (IF  YOU  ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE THAT MUCH
ADDITIONAL RAM, DISK MUNCHER WILL  ALLOW  YOU  TO  COPY  A  DISK  ONCE
NORMALLY  USING THE RAM CARD, THEN COPY THE SAME DISK AGAIN AND AGAIN,
USING THE RAM CARD AS A BUFFER). WHEN YOU ENTER THE SLOT OF  YOUR  RAM
CARD,  DISK  MUNCHER WILL SCAN THAT SLOT TO DETERMINE HOW BIG THE CARD
IS, AND WHETHER IT IS A LEGEND, SATURN, 16K, OR 32K CARD,  BECAUSE  OF
THIS  IF  YOU  ENTER  THE  SLOT  OF  A  CARD  THAT  IS NOT A RAM CARD,
UNPREDICTABLE THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN TO YOUR CARD  (I.E.   A  CLOCK  CARD
COULD  HAVE  IT'S  TIME  CHANGED,  ETC...).  NOTE:  DISK  MUNCHER WILL
AUTOMATICALLY SEARCH SLOT 0 FOR A RAM CARD. YOU SHOULD ENTER THE SLOTS
FOR ALL YOUR RAM CARDS. WHEN YOU ARE DONE ENTERING, PRESS  SPACE  BAR,
AND  DISK  MUNCHER  WILL RETURN YOU TO "INSERT DISKS" PROMPT. NOTE: TO
LEARN HOW TO SAVE THIS CONFIGURATION, SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE  TO  TYPE
ALL  THE  INFORMATION  IN  EACH TIME YOU WISH TO USE DISK MUNCHER, SEE
APPENDIX C. 


YOU HAVE NOW LEARNED HOW TO COPY A DISK, AND CHANGE THE OPTIONS.   THE
ONLY  THING  LEFT  TO  TELL  YOU  ABOUT HOW TO EXIT FROM DISK MUNCHER.
EXITING FROM DISK MUNCHER IS VERY SIMPLE, ALL YOU HAVE OT DO IS SELECT
OPTION 4 FROM THE MAIN MENU. AFTER YOU SELECT OPTION 4,  DISK  MUNCHER
WILL  CLEAR  THE  SCREEN, AND ASK YOU TO "VERIFY BOOT" YOU SHOULD THEN
PUT THE DISK IN THE DRIVE YOU WISH TO BOOT AND PRESS Y FOR  YES  I  DO
WANT TO EXIT, OR N FOR "NO IT WAS A MISTAKE! I WANT TO GO BACK!"

APPENDIX A - SAVING THE CONFIGURATION

THERE  ARE  TWO  TYPES  OF  CONFIGURATIONS  FOR DISK MUNCHER, THE USER
CONFIGURATION, AND  THE  RESET  CONFIGURATION.  IN  ORDER  TO  SAVE  A
CONFIGURATION,  YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW HOW TO ENTER THE MONITOR, CHANGE
BYTES, AND RE-SAVE A BINARY PROGRAM OUT  TO  DISK.  IF  YOU  HAVE  ANY
DOUBTS  ABOUT THIS PROCEDURE, DON'T DO IT! YOU COULD DESTROY YOUR COPY
OF DISK MUNCHER. 

TO BEGIN WITH YOU WILL NEED TO "BLOAD" DISK MUNCHER FROM  DISK.   THIS
CAN  BE  ACCOMPLISHED  WITH  THE "BLOAD DISK MUNCHER 1.1" COMMAND FROM
DOS. AFTER DISK MUNCHER IS LOADED  IN,  ENTER  THE  MONITOR  WITH  THE
"CALL-151" COMMAND FROM BASIC. THIS IS A LIST OF THE ADDRESSES IN DISK
MUNCHER  THAT  CORRESPOND TO THE DIFFERENT DEFAULT VALUES FOR THE USER
CONFIGURATION: 

LOCATIONS OPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

$1000     SOURCE SLOT TIMES 16 + SOURCE DRIVE I.E. $1000=$61
$1001     TARGET SLOT TIMES 16 + TARGET DRIVE I.E. $1001=$62
$1002     SLOT OF RAM CARD 1 TIMES 16.
$1003     SLOT OF RAM CARD 2 TIMES 16.
$1004     SLOT OF RAM CARD 3 TIMES 16.
$1005     SLOT OF RAM CARD 4 TIMES 16.
$1006     VERIFY ON/OFF ($00=OFF,$FF=ON)
$1007     FUTURE EXPANSION.

AFTER YOU HAVE ENTERED YOUR RAM CARD SLOTS IN THE BYTES, YOU  HAVE  TO
FILL  THE  REMAINING RAM CARD LOCATIONS LOCATIONS WITH $A0'S (SPACES).
LOCATIONS $1008-$100F ARE THE RESET CONFIGURATION SECTION. THE  FORMAT
FOR RESET CONFIGURATION IS THE SAME AS THE USER CONFIGURATION. 

AFTER  YOU  HAVE  ENTERED ALL THE INFORMATION YOU CAN RETURN TO DOS BY
TYPING "3D0G". ALL YOU HAVE LEFT TO DO IS "BSAVE"  DISK  MUNCHER  BACK
OUT  TO  DISK.  THIS  CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE "BSAVE DISK MUNCHER
1.1,A$800,L$11DF" COMMAND. THEN  EVERY  TIME  YOU  WANT  TO  USE  DISK
MUNCHER  YOU  WILL  JUST  BRUN IT AS USUAL, AND THE USER CONFIGURATION
WILL BE ACTIVE. IF YOU WISH TO USE THE  RESET  CONFIGURATION  YOU  CAN
PRESS  CTRL-R.  YOU  CAN THEN SWITCH BACK TO THE USER CONFIGURATION BY
PRESSING CTRL-C. 


IF YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT COMPUTERS THAT YOU USE DISK MUNCHER ON,  YOU
COULD  CHANGE BOTH THE USER AND RESET CONFIGURATIONS. THIS WOULD ALLOW
YOU TO USE THE USER CONFIGURATION  FOR  ONE  COMPUTER  AND  THE  RESET
CONFIGURATION FOR THE OTHER. 

APPENDIX B - STORY AND PRINCIPLE BEHIND DISK MUNCHER

WHEN WE (THE STACK AND MYSELF) FIRST SAW THE "FAST" COPIERS WE THOUGHT
THEY  WERE  GREAT,  BUT  THEY  LACKED  ONE MAJOR FEATURE: YOU COULDN'T
CATALOG A DISK FROM WITHIN THEIR PROGRAM! SO WE DECIDED TO  WRITE  OUR
OWN  "FAST"  COPIER. WHEN WE WERE IN THE PLANNING STAGES, THE STACK IN
ONE OF HIS BRAIN STORMS (THE SAME ONES  THAT  GAVE  YOU  THE  ROTATING
SPACE,  AND THE ZOOM SCREEN CLEAR) DECIDED THAT HE COULD MAKE A FASTER
COPIER. WELL THE PRODUCT OF THAT IDEA WAS DISK MUNCHER. 

THE PRINCIPLE BEHIND ALL  THIS  IS  A  LITTLE  COMPLICATED,  AND  THIS
EXPLANATION  IS  JUST  THE  BACKGROUND AND BASICS BEHIND IT. ON A DISK
INFORMATION IS STORE IN NIBBLES. EACH NIBBLE IS ONLY  SIX  BITS  LONG.
NORMALLY,  DOS  READS  THE  NIBBLES  IN AND CONVERTS THEM TO EIGHT BIT
FORMAT. WELL THIS IS JUST FINE AND DANDY, BUT  IT  TAKES  A  WHILE  TO
CONVERT  THE  NIBBLES,  SO  THE  STACK  DECIDED HE WOULD JUST READ THE
NIBBLES AND WRITE THEM BACK OUT WITH OUT  CONVERTING  THEM.  THIS  CAN
SAVE  A  LOT OF TIME WHEN YOU ARE COPYING A WHOLE DISK AND MAKES IT SO
THAT THE DISK DOES NOT HAVE TO BE INITED. BECAUSE THE  6  BIT  NIBBLES
TAKE UP MORE ROOM IN MEMORY THAN A 8 BIT BYTE, IT TAKES MORE MEMORY TO
READ A TRACK, THUS THE REQUIRED 224K+ FOR READING IN THE WHOLE DISK. 

APPENDIX C - TECHNICAL STUFF

THIS   SECTION   CONTAINS   INFORMATION   USEFUL  TO  THE  EXPERICENED
PROGRAMER. 

IF BY SOME UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE YOUR DRIVE HAS THE  HEAD  VIOLENTLY
MOVED (LIKE DROPPING IT OUT THE WINDOW OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT) YOU CAN
RECALIBRATE  IT  WITH  THE  !  AND  "  COMMANDS.   THESE COMMANDS WILL
RECALIBRATE THE SOURCE AND TARGET DRIVES RESPECTIVELY. 

ONE OTHER INTERESTING THING YOU MIGHT WANT TO  KNOW.  THE  TRACK  MOVE
DELAY  TABLE IS STORED AT $1200. IF YOU HAVE A DRIVE THAT CAN SEEK THE
HEAD FASTER THAN NORMAL, THIS MIGHT BE USEFUL. 

APPENDIX D - DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VERSION 1.0 AND VERSION 1.1

THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VERSION 1.0 AND VERSION 1.1 IS  THE  READ
AND  WRITE  VERIFY.  THERE  ARE OTHER MINOR DIFFERENCES, LIKE THE FACT
THAT DISK MUNCHER DOESN'T RECALIBRATE THE HEAD AFTER THE  FIRST  TIME.
ANOTHER  FEATURE  ADDED  IS EASY ACCESS TO THE TRACK MOVE DELAY TABLE.
OVER ALL THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VERSION 1.0 AND 1.1

WELL THAT IS JUST ABOUT ALL THERE IS TO DISK MUNCHER. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

UPCOMING PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS: 

THE NEWEST MEMBER OF CORRUPT COMPUTING,  THE  TECHNICOLOR  PIRATE,  IS
ALMOST  DONE WITH A VERY INTERESTING AND UNIQUE PROGRAM: SHAPE HUNTER.
THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE AN  NMI  TO  INTERRUPT  A
GAME, AND SAVE IT FOR LATER PLAY, OR EVEN EDIT THE SHAPES AND PICTURES
IN  THE  GAME.  THIS  IS  ONE  OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE PROJECTS CORRUPT
COMPUTING HAS EVER UNDERTAKEN. 

STILL IN THE PLANNING STAGES IS A PROGRAM PACKER/UNPACKER,  A  MODULAR
DOS, A RAM DISK PROGRAM THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO USE ANY RAM CARD BY ANY
COMPANY  AS A RAM DISK, AND A SHAPE HUNTER UTILITIES DISK. ALSO IN THE
PLANNING STAGES IS A CORRUPT COMPUTING NEWSLETTER. IT WILL  INCLUDE  A
MAJOR   ARTICLE   ON   HOW  THE  DISK  DRIVE  WORKS,  AND  A  COMPLETE
INTERPRETATION OF THE P6 AND P6A PROMS. 

WELL THAT IS JUST ABOUT IT FOR NOW. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------
