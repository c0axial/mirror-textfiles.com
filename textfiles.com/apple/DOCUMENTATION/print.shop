Ok,  to start off with this is one EXCELLENT program, and all you need
is an APPLE II+/IIe/IIc with at least 48k of memory or  APPLE  III  in
emulation  mode.  optional equipment is as follows. Joystick,Koala pad
and color ribbons and paper. To start just put boot up  the  disk  and
you  come to a menu. You can use eitherthe joystick,cursor keys or the
Koala pad to move to the proper program. 
 Obviously if this is your first time you will choose SETUP. Now  tell
it  what  type  of  printer  you  have,  what slot and type of printer
interface and how many drives you have. You can use  Print  Shop  with
only  one  drive,  but once you start making your own designs you will
need two. at this point, to test your printer setup,  make  sure  your
printer is ready and type return. You should see 'WELCOME TO THE PRINT
SHOP' print out. If it does we're ready to go!! Oh, one last thing, to
use  the KOALA PAD plug it in BEFORE you boot up. Also the buttons may
be used as RETURN and ESCAPE. 

                        Greeting Card

To make a Greeting card highlight it on the menu and press return. You
have a choice of 'Ready Made' or  'Design  your  Own'  if  you  choose
design  your  own,  just  follow  the step by step instructions. First
you'll design the FRONT then the INSIDE. You'll be asked to  choose  a
border,graphic,graphic  size,grahic  layout, font. There are 3 graphic
sizes; small,medium and  large.  The  staggered  graphic  layout  will
evenly  space  13  (small) or 5 (med) sized graphics. The tiled layout
will place small graphics side by side on the whole  page.  Note  that
the  CUSTOM,  TILED  or  STAGGERED  layout  can't be useWith the large
graphic. The Custom layout lets you choose how many  SMALL  or  MEDIUm
graphics  will  be  printed.  Use  the  arrow keys or koala pad to the
different positions and hit return to select.  When done just move  to
the DONE box and hit return. Choose a FONT and we will type a message.
You  will  now  see  a  box.  on the right the 'C' means centered.  By
pressing ^P (CTRL=P) you can change it to  Flush  Left/Right.  On  the
left  side  you  will  see  small boxes. You can change the Font being
printed to be SOLID(preset) OUTLINE or 3-D. by pressing ^F will change
this. You can also set the print to be larger or smaller  by  pressing
^S.  You  will not be able to JUDGE the outcome until AFTER your done.
When you done just hit return and now you'll go  to  the  INSIDE  card
design.  This is done exactly the same way.  When done with the inside
you will be at the  print  menu.  Just  position  your  paper  at  the
perforations  and  go!  The  system  will pause with 'THINKING' on the
screen and then print. Congradulations on you  first  card!  One  last
note,  using  graphics  #51-60  in  the  TILE  mode  will  print  nice
backrounds

                                SIGN

The SIGN mode will let you print full page signs. These can be of  any
graphic  supplied  or  one  of  your  own,  that you designed with the
Graphics Editor. The procedure is the same as for the  front  page  of
the GREETING CARD. 

                             LETTERHEAD

In  LETTERHEAD we design the top first. Choose a graphic or no grahic.
If you choose graphic,you will now see a  way  to  postion  them.  The
options  are shown as you move the highlighter up and down. Select one
and you will now have to choose the FONT. This is the same as for  the
GREETING  CARD with the exception of not being able to alter the size.
Just type in your message. You can use ^F/P as  before  also.  If  you
want  your  address  printed  the line will wrap around the screen but
will be printed on one line if your message is to long.  If you  don't
want your address just hit return. For that extra touch you can have a
horizontal  line  your  name  from  the  rest  of the page. Choosing a
graphic for the bottom isthe same as the top. When you  have  finished
the design go to the print menu and VIOLA? Nice eh? You can also print
multipule copies to use for your word processing needs. 

                               BANNER

Highlight  'BANNER'  then  return. Choose a FONT that you want, return
and now choose either solid or outline printing. Type your message  on
the  two lines.  If your message doesn't fit, you'll have to edit your
message. Only on line can go on the banner even though you  type  your
message  on two. you can also 'CHAIN' two banners or graphic pictures.
By doing this you can get different fonts or graphics on  one  banner.
The  graphic choices are done the same as in the GREETING CARD. Choose
the postions of the graphics and just print. 

                            SCREEN MAGIC

Screen Magic is a very powerful SCREEN PRINTING program. It will print
different shades of grey as well as printing the whole screen.The menu
has five choices. They are: See Kalaidescopes,Draw text on  screen,Get
screen,Save  Screen  and  Print  screen. Let's highlight KALAIDESCOPES
first and then go onto the others. Kalaidescope will let  you  see  12
different screens. by pressing RETURN you can advance to the next one.
Hitting  ESCAPE  will  freeze the present screen.  When you hit ESCAPE
the screen will be put into memory and you will go back to  the  menu.
Kalidescope  2  will  start out like 1 but has only one starting point
and return will not work. Hitting ESCAPE will though and also put  the
screen  in memory. NOTE that you can only have one screen in memory at
a time. DRAW ON TEXT will let you do just  that  with  the  screen  in
memory.  Just  choose  a  FONT  and  type.  The  number  of  lines and
characters differs with the font size. Also  ^F  will  toggle  between
solid  and  outline  as 3-D is not available. Now center your text. It
can be done from top to bottom if  desires.  If  you  want  to  get  a
different screen that you previously saved, type in the name and drive
#.  Hit  return  for  a  catalog  of RETRIEVABLE screens. Only screens
created with the screen editor are valid. Save screen is just that. It
will ask you if you want init disk. If you dont have a inited disk get
a SCRATCH and just follow the directions. Print screen will print  the
screen  in  memory.  You can choose between normal or reverse. Reverse
meaning that all the BLACK areas of your screen will be  printed.  You
will  also  be asked if you want a border around the screen. This is a
single black line and is not like on the  GREETING  CARDS.  The  print
menu  is  like  the  others  with  the exception of 'PRINT TOP HALF OR
BOTTOM HALF'? This is if you want to fold the paper  in  1/2,  as  the
PRINT SHOP works only on 8 1/2 x 11 paper. 

                           GRAPHIC EDITOR

Last  but  not least is the Graphic Editor. This will let you edit ANY
an ALL graphics CREATED or USED by the PRINT SHOP.  The  menu  to  the
right of the drawing screen is really self expanatory (so is the whole
program  so  why  this  big text file??) but, the one thing you should
know about is the ^D- device.  This is NOT for  a  drive  selection!!!
This will let you reactivate the KOALA PAD if it was not on the system
when  you  booted up. The buttons on the joystick and koala pad act as
'D' for draw and 'E'  for  erase.  NOTES:  before  you  can  edit  the
original  PRINT  SHOP  graphics the must be save to another disk. As I
stated before ONLY graphics created with PRINT SHOP can be used. 

Print Shop suggests that if you have a serial printer  to  set  it  at
9600 baud.  Try this if your printing is erratic. For those of us that
have  the  OKIDATA  92  we  will not get as good graphics as the other
printers. This is because the graphic resolution is  only  72x72.  The
others  are  160(120)x72.  Who  cares,  we  get  better  print quality
anyway.
