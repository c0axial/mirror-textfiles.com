                     The Black Market.........[615] 377-6929
                     ---------------------------------------

                               Getting Started
                               ---------------

Start your disk as you would any other.
Use a self-centering joystick.
Press the joystick button to begin.
(Note: A Mockingboard plugged into a ][+ or ][e will
dramatically improve game sound effects and music.)


                  Choosing Ranks (Skill Levels) And Scenarios
                  -------------------------------------------

Move the joystick right and left to select SCENARIOS
and forward and backward to select RANKS (skill levels).
Press the joystick button when you have the ones you want.
There are 5 RANKS from CADET (the easiest) to ACE OF THE BASE (the hardest).
There are 15 SCENARIOS.

The first 7 SCENARIOS are TRAINING MISSIONS, some with ENEMY
TANKS only, some with ENEMY PLANES only, some with both.
TRAINING MISSIONS contain no ENEMY MOTHER SHIPS
and the enemy cannot destroy your home base.

In the 8 invasions you must protect you home base or lose
your computer and whatever fighters you still have there.

When you wipe out all the enemy forces or when the enemy wipes out all your
planes, you will be returned to base. when you get to the end of the game,
use your joystick to select either same game (same rank, same scenario) or
restart (if you want to change either). Then press the button.
(See inside for more information about scenarios.)


                          Launching A SkyFox Fighter
                          --------------------------

After you choose rank and scenario,
the base computer will appear on the screen.
To launch automatically against the nearest targets,
press the joystick button to enter the launch tube.
If necessary, then use the joystick to select low
(for launching against tanks) or high (for launching against planes).
Press the button again to launch.  Your launch speed depends on your rank.


                             Flying A SkyFox Fighter
                             -----------------------

Move the joystick right and left to turn the plane.
Move it up and down to change altitude.
Press and hold down the second joystick button
to engage the after burners for quick thrust.
Release it to return to your pre-thrust speed.

Tank Training 1-
You are launched flying due east toward three consecutive waves of tanks.
When you destroy the last one, you will automatically be returned to base.
Launch again to face even more tanks.
Use your overhead radar scanner to spot your targets.

Tank Training 2-
You will be launched onto the tail of an enemy plane.
Shoot fast or it will circle and attack you.
The forward scanner shows planes which are in range and
will help you determine whether they are above or below you.
(The space bar toggles between forward and overhead scanners.)
Try your guided and heat seeking missiles.
(Press G or H to arm and the joystick button to launch.)
Succeed and you can re-launch against successively more planes.

Plane Training 2-
Launches you nose to nose with the enemy.
The slow don't live.

Plane Training 3-
Like tank training 2, but with planes.

High/Low Training-
Alternate waves first of tanks, then of planes.
You'll automatically be returned to base after each success.

Combo Training-
Like high/low but a wave consists of both tanks and planes.
You may fly through the cloud layer that separates air and ground wars.

Small Invasion-
1 Mothership to defeat, before it launches
enough planes and tanks to destroy your base.
Protect your base and the outlying installations
containing your friends and relatives.
Be sure to save some missiles to use against motherships.
When a mothership launches a plane on a bombing run to one of your installations, the message "LAUNCH DETECTED" will appear on the radar
scanner display in your cockpit.

Full Invasion-
A 3 Mothership invasion.  Massive onslaught-6 motherships.

Halo, Alamo, Advancing Wall, Chess And Cornered-
Each a multiple mothership invasion, each with its own shape and pressure.
To study enemy movement patterns in the scenarios, choose a scenario
and press the button to enter the base, then don't launch.
Just watch the enemy movement on the tactical map to understand the
IR strategies.




                        Using The SkyFox Weapons Systems
                        --------------------------------

Press the main joystick button to fire the laser cannons.
Press H on the keyboard to arm a heat
seeking missile and G to arm a guided one.
Press again if you want to disarm an armed missile which you haven't yet fired. Press the main button to send an armed missile against an enemy target.
You must be pointed toward a target visible on your on-board radar scanner
to fire a missile or you will get a 'no target' message on the scanner.


                 Using Automatic Pilot To Find More Enemy Targets
                 ------------------------------------------------

When no enemy targets are in view, press both joystick buttons
simultaneously or press A on the keyboard to engage the automatic pilot.
Your on-board computer will locate the nearest
enemy targets and send you to their location.


                           Using The Base Computer
                           -----------------------

The base computer displays a tactical map which shows the
location of all your installations and of all enemy vehicles.
While flying the SkyFox, press C to bring up a visual
display of that map, transmitted from your base computer.
Use the arrow keys (or I,J,K and M) to move the cursor to the
sector you want to fly to, then press A to engage the automatic pilot.
You may also follow this procedure to choose
your own target to launch against from the base.
(And while you're in the base, you can use the base computer to play an old
 20th century video game if you can find the control that brings it up.)
Pressing C again disengages the base computer.


                          Flying Through The Clouds
                          -------------------------

There is a cloud barrier that stretches between 1,000 and 10,000 feet.
You must fly through it each time you switch between ground and air combat.
Flying up to 30,000 feet results in heavy fuel consumption.
Look for enemy planes between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.
They will only fly in that range.
As you approach the cloud barrier the base computer will
automatically be disengaged and moved out of your way.


                            Landing A SkyFox Fighter
                            ------------------------

You may land at home base to recharge your shields and take on fuel.
You may not land at any installation other than your home base.
(Your home base is shown on the tactical map as a white checkered square.
 All other installations are shown as solid white squares.)
To Land:
1) Enter the sector containing your base;
2) Reduce your speed to zero by pressing zero on the keyboard;
3) Reduce altitude to zero by pushing forward on the joystick.
Once you've successfully landed; the base computer will appear on the screen.



                       Link With Computer's Tactical Map.
                       ----------------------------------

'C' Brings up the computer map.
    Pressing C Again removes it.

With the map up: I,J,K,M or the cursor keys move the cursor (blinking square).

'Z' zooms in on a square under cursor.

'A' Engages automatic pilot, targeting square under the cursor.
    If tactical map is not up when automatic pilot is engaged,
    computer will automatically select nearest enemy occupied square instead.

'R' Brings up an installation status report.
    Check the shields on each installation.
    When they reach zero the installation is destroyed.

'T' Brings back the tactical map.

Guided Missile Count-
Press G to arm and G again to disarm and the joystick button to fire.
You must be facing a target on you radar scanner to fire.

Clock- shows elapsed time since invasion.

Fuel Indicator-
Fuel consumption increased with speed.
Using afterburners for thrust boosts 9 with the second joystick
button and climbing to fight planes are especially expensive.
Land at home base to refuel.  Running out of fuel in flight is fatal.

Speed Indicator-
In Miles Per Hour.
Press a number on the keyboard to set a new speed.
0 Stops, 1 Sets at 10% of maximum, 2 at 20%, etc.
Ground maximum is 1500 mph.
High altitude maximum is 3000 mph.

Control S- Toggles sound on and off.
Control B- Restarts The Game.
Control P- Pauses The Game.
Esc- Gets help when you are at the base or flying with the computer map up.

Radar Scanner Display-
The space bar toggles between overhead and forward radar screens.
Overhead radar shows installations as well as enemy targets.
Enemy targets blink.  Watch for messages to appear here.

Heat Seeking Missile Count-
Press H to arm and H again to disarm and the joystick button to fire.
You must be facing a target on your radar scanner to fire.

Auto Pilot Indicator-
Will show either auto or norm depending on your flying mode.
Press A or both joystick buttons simultaneously to engage.

Shield Indicator-
When all the blue is gone so are you.   Land at home base to recharge.

Altitude Indicator-
Be careful.
Above the rank of cadet, hitting the ground hard costs some shield strength.
