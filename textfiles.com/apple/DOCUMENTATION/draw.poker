             Draw Poker
 
The  Poker  Table  pits you against the
"House".  Both you and the dealer start
with   an   equal   amount  of   money,
depending  on  the  amount  the  player
withdraws.    You  play  "table stakes"
rules meaning that, during play, you or
the  dealer  cannot bet  any amount  of
money that exceeds the others bankroll.
 
At the first  prompt after entering the
Poker Table, you may:
 
A)nte    or    Q)uit to the Casino Menu
 
If you choose to Ante, both you and the
dealer put  $5 in the  "pot".  Each  is
then dealt 5 cards.   You or the dealer
may B)et, C)heck or F)old.   The winner
of the previous round will always  B)et
or  C)heck first.   Betting  may  range
from $2 to $25.  After one  B)ets,  the
other may  either  C)heck,  R)aise,  or
F)old.   If  one  B)ets  and the  other
F)olds, the one who  B)et automatically
wins the  "pot".  If one  R)aises,  the
raise is always limited to $25.   There
is also a limit of  3 raises before and
after  discards.    You are  allowed to
check and raise.
 
After both you and the dealer C)heck or
C)all, you  are  shown your  cards  and
asked which ones  you wish  to discard.
If   you   wish  to   "stand pat",  hit
<RETURN>.   You may discard from 1 to 5
(all) cards.
 
You discard by typing the  number(s) of
the cards:
 
To discard 1,2,5:      125    <RETURN>
To discard 2,4  :      24     <RETURN>
To discard all  :      12345  <RETURN>
 
ALWAYS enter the numbers of  the cards
in  ASCENDING  order.
 
You are then  shown  the number  of new
cards that  you  and  the dealer  took.
You new hand is then dispalayed and you
are  given  the  chance  to  bet  these
cards.   The same  rules apply  to this
round  of betting  that  applied to the
rst round.
 
After  all  betting  is  complete,  the
"house" analyzes each hand to determine
the winner.   If you win, the  "pot" is
added to your bankroll.  In the case of
a tie, the  "pot" is  split between the
player and the "house".
 
At this point you may either  A)nte for
a new round of Poker  or Q)uit.
