                 MidiMate - A Midi File Utility for the Apple IIGS Computer

                              Copyright 1990 by Lindsay B. Hough, Ph.D.

                               Version 1.1 - Compiled by TML Pascal II

     MidiMate is a program for the Apple IIGS that allows users to convert Industry Standard Midi Sequence Files to the new format supported by the program SynthLab.  SynthLab is a powerful instrument editor and Midi-compatible sequencer written by Apple Computer that allows users to build instruments and play them with their Apple IIGS.  Synthlab uses the new Apple IIGS Tool 35 (MidiSynth).  

     With MidiMate, standard Midi files from MasterTracks Pro, MasterTracks Jr, Audio Animator, and others can be converted to the SynthLab format.  This version of the  program will convert the first 7 midi tracks of standard files up to file sizes of about 40K (the acutal limitation is 64K of SynthLab format, but the maximum size of the midi standard file depends somewhat on the type of midi data).  Only Midi file format 1 (multi-track) is supported, which means that if your sequencing software gives you a choice of midi standard files to produce, always choose the multi-track option.  The program also supports NDAs (but see bug report below).

MIDIMATE REQUIRMENTS- The program requires an Apple IIGS with at least 1 MB of memory running GSOS 5.02.  The program will run in any disk configuration, but special instructions are required for single disk drive users (see installation, below).  The program DOES NOT require Tool 35, SynthLab, or a Midi Interface.

MMDemo - This is a demo version of the program that is installed and run exactly like the actual program.  MMDemo will let you load and convert files, allowing the user to get the look and feel of the program.  The demo will not save converted files.

INSTALLATION OF MIDIMATE OR MMDEMO- For users of hard disk drives or more than a single 3.5 inch drive, just launch the MIDIMATE application file from the Finder.  Users of single disk drives must create a bootable system disk containing the MIDIMATE or MMDEMO file, re-boot with that disk, and launch the program.  If necessary, get rid of extra fonts, or unneeded desk accessories.  The program doesn't use custom fonts.  MidiMate needs constant access to the system (boot) disk, so make sure that the system disk is in another disk drive (or on the hard disk) while MidiMate is running.  If you like icons and have the room, copy the file MidiMate.Icon to the Icon folder of your boot disk (optional).

RUNNING THE PROGRAM - To convert a Midi Standard File, perform the following 3 steps in order:

          1) Choose "Load Midi Sequence" from the File Menu.  After a brief pause, you will see a "Standard Midi File Window", showing, among other data, the actual midi data in hex format.  You can use the sidebar to scroll through the midi data (if you're interested).  You don't HAVE to do anything with this window - it's just there to tell you that the file was loaded correctly.  Since the TextEdit tool was used in displaying the midi hex data, you can also EDIT the midi hex data.  However, in the present version of the program, MidiMate will ignore whatever you do to the data.

          2) To convert the loaded midi data, choose "Stnd Midi --> SynthLab" from the Convert Menu.  Depending on the file size, the conversion make take several minutes.  During the conversion, MidiMate tells you exactly what it's doing (info on number of tracks, number of seq items converted, etc).  At any point during the conversion, you can interrupt this process and go back to the Midi Window by choosing the "Cancel" button at the bottom of the screen.  MidiMate informs you of any problems encountered during the conversion.  At the end of a successful conversion, you will see a "SynthLab" window displaying data on the converted file.  If, for any reason, the conversion was not successful, the program informs you and tells you the nature of the problem (e.g. bad file, file too big, etc.).  MidiMate can convert files up to 64K of converted sequence image, which corresponds to 8,192 seq items (seq items are counted on screen during conversion).

          3) When the file has been successfully converted, choose "Save Sequence (Synthlab)" from the File menu.  You can save it to any folder with any name.  The file created has the "synth" instrument has the default for SynthLab.  Of course you can change that after the file is loaded into SynthLab, but it is most convenient to place converted sequences in a folder with "Synth.bnk" and "Synth.wv" files (see the SynthLab manual).  MMDemo will not save converted files.

OTHER MENU OPTIONS - The apple menu has an "About" choice, a "Help" option, along with your favorite NDAs.  Choosing "Close" from the file menu or clicking the close button on the MidiMate windows does nothing to NDA windows, but will remove any open midi or SynthLab files (You get a warning).  After closing the open window, you will have to start the conversion process all over again.

FILES WITH THIS PACKAGE:

     MMDEMO - A GSOS application file that is the demo program.  No other files are needed by the program, but the program uses both the data fork and resource fork of this file..

BUGS AND BUG REPORTING - So far there is only 1 known bug.  The program is incompatible with some NDAs, but I'm not sure which.

  When the program can't translate a file, it almost always tells you and tells you why.  So it seldom crashes.  However, it does translate a file incorrectly once in a while - no problems with Midimate, but SynthLab gags on it (crashes while playing).  Use "turn off all notes" option in synthlab if needed, and also choose "view sequence".  Sometimes you will see the seq items out of ascending order with a crash like this.  THE FIX  for this problem is removing NDAs.  I can't tell you which ones cause the problem - only that file translation errors like this are not reproducible (they produce different bad files, not the same bad files) and they are ALWAYS (so far) fixed by removing the desk.Accs folder from my hard disk.  What DAs do I have?  Memory, WriteIt, IIGS Text Printer, along with BG sound and label grabber.  I haven't had time yet to figure out who the culprit is.

  If you have a reproducible bug or a file that won't convert after removing ALL NDAs (by renaming Desk.Acc), please record the sequence of events that causes the bug, and send me the report, along with the file that wouldn't convert and the file that MidiMate produced if any (that SL won't play):
