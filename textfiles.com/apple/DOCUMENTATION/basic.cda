Visit Applesoft BASIC CDA  v1.1

by David A. Lyons     July 1990
===============================

This is one of those "because it could be done" projects.

"Visit Applesoft BASIC" drops you into good old Applesoft under
GS/OS, provided it can allocate 4K of bank 0 memory.  (If it
can't allocate the memory, complains politely and doesnUt let
you into Applesoft.)

The "&" command takes you back to the CDA menu.

Don't try to use HGR or HGR2 while you're visiting Applesoft--
that memory may already be in use by other parts of the system.
