                                ENCAMP
 
   This command is used in several menus to take time off and try to
rebuild characters and the party. It is used to handle day-to-day
functions such as saving the game, resting to heal, or memorize spells
(described under Magic Menu), and changing game items such as game
speed or party order.
 
   Encamp Menu
 
   ENCAMP:SAVE VIEW MAGIC REST ALTER EXIT
 
   SAVE:
   This command saves the characters and game as they are. Check the
Quick Reference Card for any system specific details of how to save
your game.
 
   VIEW:
   This displays the View Menu, as described under Viewing a Character.
In camp, this does not display the Sell Item or ID commands.
 
   MAGIC:
   Magic is a very important part of Pool Of Radiance, and is described
later under its own heading. Magical Spells can only be memorized while
the party is in camp.
 
   REST:
   One of the most important aspects of the Encamp Menu is the chance
to rest. Characters catch their normal sleep without having to go to
camp. However, to memorize spells or heal naturally, specific rest time
is necessary.
   For every 24 uninterrupted hours of resting in camp, every wounded
character regains one hit point above and beyond any recovery gained
from healing magics.
   The initial resting time is established by anyone who is memorizing
spells. The screen will show the days, hours, and minutes necessary for
the spell-using members of the party to memorize (or pray for) the
spells they want to memorize. Memorizing any spells at all takes a
minimum of four hours. Third level spells take a minimum of six hours.
See the Magic Menu for further description of memorizing spells.
   Rest can be interrupted by any random encounter. Only take long
rests in safe places, such as inns, hideouts, or secure buildings.
 
   Rest Menu:
 
   REST INCREASE DECREASE EXIT
 
   REST
   Once you have determined the full time you want the party to rest,
this command starts them Resting.
 
   INCREASE
   This command adds to the time that the party will stay in camp,
usually for resting to regain lost hit points. Every 24 uninterrupted
hours in camp restores 1 HP to every injured member of the group.
 
   DECREASE
   This command decreases the time to be spent in camp. This may mean
that characters do not memorize all the spells they want or that
characters may not recover all their hit points, but sometimes time
constraints are part of the adventure, and the party cannot spend all
the time it wants resting.
 
   ALTER:
   This command is used to change the basic makeup of both the party
and the characters who are part of it. You are given the following
menu:
 
   Alter Menu:
 
   ALTER: ORDER DROP SPEED ICON PICS EXIT
 
   ORDER
   This command allows you to reorganize your characters for combat.
You can place characters in the first or second rank. The first four
characters are in the first rank, where they will meet enemies
hand-to-hand, the rest are in the second rank, where they can use
spells and missile weapons.
   The computer asks who takes position number 1, etc. and reforms the
group, with position #1 on top, when all the choices are made. Position
of NPCs can be changed with this command.
 
   DROP
   This command allows you to permanently drop a character or NPC from
the party. Once dropped, the character is gone from the party and his
current version will not be saved if you then use the Save command to
save the game.
 
   SPEED
   This command controls the speed of messages presented on the screen.
If you are having trouble reading messages before they disappear, use
the Slower command. If messages seem to take forever to get off the
screen, use the Faster command. Note that once you have used this
command, it affects all subsequent messages, and you may have to re-use
the command if later messages are too fast or too slow.
 
   Speed Menu:
 
   SPEED: SLOWER FASTER EXIT
 
   ICON
   When a character is created, he is given a combat icon. When the
party is in Combat, each party member's icon designates his position
and general facing on the screen.
   The Icon command is used to change the character's icon. You can
customize this icon to represent the character's favorite weapons,
armor, and colors. You may want to do this when the character picks up
a new weapon.
 
   Icon Menu:
 
   ICON: PARTS COLOR SIZE EXIT
 
   Parts: You can alter the weapon (which controls the rest of the body
shape) or the head of the icon. You are shown both the Ready Icon
character and the character's Action Icon (which shows the character
attacking).
   When you are done choosing the weapon and head, you can reject the
new form or accept it. The screen shows you and the new and old
versions of the Ready and Action Icons.
 
   Parts Menu:
 
   PARTS: WEAPON HEAD EXIT
 
   Color. You use Color to alter the color of virtually every part of
the Icon, as shown on the screen. Some of the areas you can alter on
the Icons do not correspond to the terms given in the menu. For
instance, changing the shield color for a character with a bow or
crossbow actually changes the color of the arrows or quarrels. Play
with the Icons commands until you get a feel for how these variables
work.
 
   Color Menu:
 
   WEAPON BODY CAP HAIR SHIELD ARM LEG EXIT
 
   Size. Large size Icons are usually used for humans, elves, and
half-elves. Small size Icons are usually used for dwarves, gnomes, and
halflings.
 
   Size Menu:
 
   SIZE: LARGE/SMALL EXIT
 
   Exit. When you are done, use this command. The computer will ask you
to confirm any changes to your icons. Make your choice and the computer
returns to the Alter Menu.
 
   PICS
   This command governs when character and encounter pictures will be
displayed.
 
   Pics Menu:
 
   PICS: CHARACTERS ON/OFF MONSTERS ON/OFF EXIT
 
   Characters On/Off. This command governs the portraits displayed with
the character statistics when you use the View command. Characters On
shows the pictures when you view a character; Characters Off hides the
pictures. Having the characters hidden slightly speeds up the game
since the computer does not have to take the time to load or draw the
portrait each time.
 
   Monsters On/Off. This command governs the pictures that appear
during encounters. Monsters On shows the animated picture when the
monsters get to the closest range in an encounter; Monsters Off hides
the animated pictures.
 
 
                              ENCOUNTERS
 
   When a party comes across NPCs of any kind, there is an encounter.
The computer provides a quick glimpse of who the party has encountered,
then asks what you want to do.
   The computer determines whether both parties see each other, the
NPCs surprise the party, or the party surprises the NPCs.
   If the party surprised the NPCs, the party can attack immediately,
getting a free round to attack in which the NPCs cannot retaliate. This
opportunity must be taken at once or surprised is lost.
   If hostile NPCs surprise the party, the NPCs can attack immediately
and get a series of attacks in without retaliation by the party.
   If the NPCs do not surprise the party, the computer offers these
commands.
 
   Encounter Menu:
 
   ENCOUNTER: COMBAT WAIT FLEE ADVANCE/PARLAY
 
   COMBAT:
   The party attacks the NPC's. Who goes first is decided on the basis
of initiative, which is explained in the Combat section.
 
   WAIT:
   This command allows the NPCs to decide what to do. They may wait,
combat, flee, advance (if more than a square away) or parlay (if in the
same square).
 
   FLEE:
   If you see NPCs you think your party cannot fight successfully, use
this command to run away. If successful, you may flee wildly, risking
getting lost. If unsuccessful (because the NPCs can move faster than
you do) you go to combat.
 
   ADVANCE:
   If the NPCs are far away use this command to approach them. Once the
NPCs are adjacent to the party the Advance command will be replaced
with the Parlay command.
 
   PARLAY:
   Use this command to speak with NPCs that are adjacent to the party.
Choose a character to speak for the party. Pick the character who you
think will make the best impression on the NPCs. Then, choose one of
five possible attitudes for dealing with the NPCs.
 
   Parlay Menu:
 
   PARLAY: HAUGHTY SLY MEEK NICE ABUSIVE
 
   HAUGHTY
   You try to demonstrate your superiority to the inferior creatures
you are dealing with. Some encounters only respect an air of
superiority and are impressed enough to cooperate; this is also a good
way to make them resentful and attack.
 
   SLY
   You try to get information out of the NPCs without them realizing
you are doing so. Some NPCs will realize you are trying to get
something out of them and will become hostile.
 
   MEEK
   You are mild and unassuming in hopes that the NPCs will think you
are not worth attacking. Of course, some NPCs attack meek opponents,
because they are easy pickings.
 
   NICE
   You try to be friendly in hopes the NPCs are friendly to you. Some
NPCs do not choose to be friendly to anyone.
 
   ABUSIVE
   You try to browbeat information out of the NPCs. It is best not to
do this unless you have the power to back up your threat.
   The computer assumes you are as effective as possible in the
attitude you call for.
 
                                COMBAT
 
   In many adventures the party will have to fight to defeat the enemy.
In combat the computer determines which characters (both player
characters and NPCs) have initiative (i.e., which goes first) and
depicts that person and his nearby compatriots.
   If the character is a PC then the player will control his actions.
If the character is an NPC, or a PC under computer control using the
Quick command, the computer determines his actions.
 
   HITTING THE TARGET:
   The ability of an attacker to hit a target with a melee weapon (such
as a sword, spear, or fist) or a missile weapon (such as a bow or
crossbow) depends on the chance the attacker has of hitting the Armor
Class of the target. This is represented by a number called the THAC0.
The lower the THAC0 the better the chance to hit.
   A target's defense is his Armor Class, or AC. This is influenced by
the armor worn, plus the dexterity of the target and any benefit
various magic spells may have. (Magic has another method of hitting a
target; see the Magic rules). The lower the Armor Class number, the
better the armor.
   The number needed for an attacker to hit a target is the attacker's
THAC0 minus the target's Armor Class. The attacker hits if a random
number from 1-20 is greater than or equal to this number. Thus, a
person with a THAC0 of 18 needs a 14 or more to go hit Armor Class 4.
Armor classes can go into negative numbers, so the same character
trying to hit Armor Class -1 would need to get a 19 or better.
   In a combat, the first and second attackers strike at the defender's
front. The third attacker strikes at the defender's rear, unless all
the attackers are adjacent. The fourth and any additional attackers
strike at the defender's rear. The defender's AC is substantially
reduced against rear attacks.
   A thief forms the only exception to the automatic facing rules. If
the thief attacks from exactly opposite the first attacker, he can
backstab. A backstab has a better chance of hitting the defender, and
does additional damage when it does hit.
 
   USING MISSILE WEAPONS:
   A character may not use a missile weapon if he has an opponent next
to him. If he has no opponent next to him, he can fire a missile at
anyone in his line of sight. The Next and Prev commands will only aim
at targets in the attacker's line of sight.
 
   BEGINNING COMBAT:
   Each character can be controlled manually or by the computer. At the
beginning of combat each character is controlled the same as he was in
the previous combat. Any character under manual control may be turned
over to the computer using the Quick command. All characters may also
be simultaneously switched to manual control or computer control. Check
your Quick Reference Card for the commands used on your system.
 
   EXECUTING COMBAT:
   When a combat begins, the screen shows the area around the character
with the highest initiative. The entire party may not be on the screen
at the same time, and one can rarely see all of the monsters at one
time. The computer indicates the active character and lists his name,
current condition, armor class, and current ready weapon.
   Characters and NPCs move according to each character's dexterity and
a random number generated by the computer. This is called an Initiative
Number and changes with every combat round. Usually higher dexterity
characters move before lower dexterity characters.
   You may use the following commands to handle your side of the
battle. If a character cannot use a command (such as Turn for a
non-cleric or Cast for a fighter or thief) it does not appear.
 
   The Combat Menu:
 
   MOVE VIEW AIM USE CAST TURN QUICK DONE
 
   MOVE
   This is used to move a character and to attack. You attack by moving
the character into an enemy's square. You can even attack party
members, but the computer gives you a chance to abort such an attack.
If you disengage an enemy, he gets a free attack at your back, as do
others you move by.
   Some characters may have multiple attacks in one turn. Bows get two
attacks per turn. High level fighters get two attacks every other turn.
All of a character's attacks are taken against his first target. If the
first target goes down with the first attack, you may aim the remaining
attack at another enemy.
   Fighters may make a special form of multiple attacks called a sweep.
A sweep may attack several weak targets with a single blow each.
   Refer to your Quick Start Card to find out how to move the character
with your particular computer. The number of spaces a character can
move is reduced by the weight carried. A character weighted down with
coins or extra armor and weapons cannot move as fast as he could
without the items. Bulky armor can also reduce movement. 
   A character who is faster than any enemy can run away from the
fight, eventually running from the battlefield. A character who is as
fast as the fastest monster, only has a 50% chance of getting away
(otherwise he must remain until the end of the fight). A character who
is slower than any enemy cannot run off the edge of the fighting area.
A character who has run away is no longer part of the fight. He returns
after the fight is over.
 
   VIEW
   This is essentially the same command used any time you wish to see a
character. Using this, you can ready appropriate weapons to meet the
fight in progress. Some options, such as Trade, are not available in
the middle of combat. The Use command shows up under items to allow you
to use an item, such as a wand, in combat.
 
   AIM
   This command is used to aim an attack using the following options.
 
   Aim Menu:
 
   AIM:NEXT PREV MANUAL TARGET EXIT
 
   Next. Use this command to look at all possible targets, starting
with the one closest then going to the next closest. The computer looks
at ALL possible targets, including other party members; don't shoot
without looking. (However, the computer confirms your order first,
before shooting at a teammate.)
 
   Prev (Previous). This is the opposite of the Next command. Use this
command to look at the possible targets starting with the one farthest
away and working back toward your character. Usually this is a good way
to find a good target without working your way through all of your PCs
first.
 
   Manual. This command lets you aim anywhere on the map. It is
especially useful for finding opposing leaders and targeting spells
with area effects.
 
   Target. If your character has a ready ranged weapon, or an item
prepared with the Use command, this command shoots at the target you
selected.
 
   USE
   This command allows the character to use any non-weapon item. The
command brings up the same screen and menu as the Items command under
the View Menu.
 
   CAST
   This is only available to magic-users and clerics when they still
have spells available. Using this command brings up the Cast options of
the Magic Menu (see that description of the Magic Rules). If hit
recently, the character's concentration may be broken and you won't be
given the Cast option.
 
   TURN
   Clerics can sometimes destroy undead monsters or turn them away from
the party. This has no effect on any other form of monster. See the
Appendices for a cleric's minimum level to affect various forms of
undead.
 
   QUICK
   This command turns over control of the character to the computer. It
is a good way to handle fights against hordes of less powerful
opponents. Once you have established computer control for a character,
the computer controls him in future fights until you interrupt it.
   The computer uses ready melee or missile weapons and available
spells, switching between them to the most appropriate in the
situation. The computer plays a very aggressive game.
 
   DONE
   This command is used when a character has finished his turn.
 
   Done Menu:
 
   GUARD DELAY QUIT BANDAGE SPEED EXIT
 
   Guard. The character can adopt this tactic and simply wait to meet
any attacker. This means that he attacks the first foe that moves
adjacent to him before the foe attacks him.
 
   Delay. This command lets you delay this character's action by
reducing his initiative number by 1. If he is the only one to be at the
next lowest number, it is his action again. He can continue to delay
his actions until all others have had their action for that round and
then he must take an action or lose it.
 
   Quit. You can signify you are finished with this character by using
this Command.
 
   Bandage. This command only appears if a member of the party is
dying. The character for whom the command appears can use this command
to bandage the party member and keep him from dying.
 
   Speed. This command is described under the Alter command of the
Encamp Menu.
 
   IF THE PARTY FLEES:
   As long as any party member survives to the very end of the combat,
the bodies of unconscious or dead party members are assumed to be with
the party. If the party flees from combat all unconscious and dead
party members are permanently lost.
 
   IF THE PARTY DIES:
   If ALL the party members are slain you will have to go back to your
last Saved Game and try again from that point.
 
   AFTER COMBAT:
   When combat is over, the screen will show some congratulatory
message, then present a menu of commands. If a command does not apply
to this after-combat situation, it will not appear.
 
   Treasure Menu:
 
   VIEW TAKE POOL SHARE DETECT EXIT
 
   VIEW
   See Inspect a Character. At this time you can use the Drop commands
in both the Items menu and in the Character Screen menu.
 
   TAKE
   This command is used to pick up treasure.
 
   Take Menu:
 
   TAKE: ITEMS MONEY EXIT
 
   Items. Use this command to produce a list of items carried by the
monsters you have overcome. If more than one had a missile weapon, all
of their remaining missiles are lumped into one line (if there are more
than 100, 99 are on one line, and the rest on another line).
Frequently, the weapons and armor used by monsters are substandard and
not worth picking up as treasure, so they are not listed.
   If one character tries to pick up too many items, the computer will
say he is overloaded and will not allow the acquisition.
 
   Money. The computer displays each type of coin available and how
many of each coin there are. You indicate how many of the coins the
active character takes. One character can take all of the coins if he
has the strength to do so, or you can allow each character to take a
share.
   If you try to pick up more than the character can carry, the screen
displays a message saying, "The character is overloaded," and will not
let any more coins be put on the character. Remember, carrying lots of
coinage slows a character down in combat.
 
   POOL
   This command makes all the party members drop all of their money
into one pool of money. It becomes part of the treasure and the party
members can use the Take Menu to reapportion their funds.
 
   SHARE
   This command picks up all the money in the treasure, divides it into
shares, and distributes it among the characters.
 
   DETECT
   This command casts a detect magic from the current active character.
 
   EXIT
   This command lets you leave the scene of the battle. If there are
still items that can be picked up, the machine will remind you that
there is still treasure left. You can go back to the Treasure Menu or
leave the treasure and go to the Adventure Menu.
 
                                 MAGIC
 
   Magic is integral to Pool Of Radiance. Both magic-users and clerics
can use magical spells.
 
   HOW MAGIC WORKS:
   A spell can exist in one of three forms: In Memory, In Spell Book,
and On a Scroll.
 
   IN MEMORY
   A magic-user or cleric who has a spell in Memory is said to have
memorized the spell. He can cast the spell as shown in the Cast command
description.
 
   IN SPELL BOOK
   Magic-users write their spells into a Spell Book. They can only
write those spells into the book of which they have the ability to
cast. The books are compendiums of spells among which they choose the
ones they want to memorize. Clerics do not keep a spell book, they
simply pray each day to get their spells.
 
   ON A SCROLL
   A spell written on an enchanted scroll can be read by a cleric or
magic-user, depending on the kind of spells on the scroll. A magic-user
must cast the spell read magic to understand the spells a scroll
contains. Once he has done that, he can read the spell aloud at any
time to cast it. A cleric does not need a read magic spell to read a
clerical spell on a scroll, but only a cleric can read the spell. Once
any kind of spell has been cast or scribed from a scroll, the spell
disappears.
   A magic-user may scribe the scroll spell into his spell books for
future memorization. This erases the spell from the scroll.
Spellcasters can get a list of their memorized spells from the Cast
option of the Magic Menu or from the Spells option of the View Menu.
They can get a list of their spells on scrolls from the Scribe option
of the Magic Menu. If all you want is a list of available spells, be
sure to exit before you actually cast or scribe the spell.
 
   The Magic Menu:
 
   CAST MEMORIZE SCRIBE DISPLAY REST EXIT
 
   Cast. Use these commands to cast spells. In combat the spellcaster
is the current character. In camp the spellcaster is the current active
character.
 
   Cast Menu:
 
   CAST NEXT PREV EXIT
 
   The Cast Menu appears in both the Magic Menu, and the Combat Menu.
It shows all the spells available to the active character. Find the
page with the spell you want to cast. Select the Cast command. Then
select the spell to cast it. If necessary, indicate the target of the
spell. If you do not find the spell you want, you can Exit. In combat,
the character can take another option. Otherwise the character returns
to the Magic Menu.
   Once cast, a spell is gone and until it is memorized again.
 
   Memorize. For a character to learn a spell, use this command, which
only appears in the Encamp Menu. The computer displays a page from the
active character's spell book (or a list of possible clerical spells)
and you are offered the following commands. Remember that if a
magic-user or cleric has the ability to learn more than one spell at a
level, he can learn the same spell more than once.
 
   Memorize Menu:
 
   MEMORIZE NEXT PREV EXIT
 
   Find the page with the spell you want to memorize. Select the
memorize command. Then select the spell to memorize it. The 'pages'
here are the pages of the magic spell book, rather than just the list
of already memorized spells.
   Picking a spell to memorize does not mean that the spell is
memorized. Learning a spell takes 15 minutes (game time) per level of
spell, plus a period of relaxation before starting to memorize one or
more spells. See the Rest command in the Magic Menu.
   Only one spell may be learned at a time, though the spellcaster need
only relax once before learning several spells. The learning time must
be uninterrupted. You have to go to the Rest command and spend the time
to memorize the spell. If you have only been in camp long enough to
memorize some spells, those are learned and the others lost. The spells
are memorized in the order you pick them.
   Example: A magic-user decides to memorize 2 uses of magic missile (a
first level spell) and 1 use of Invisibility (a second level spell).
This is a total of 1 hour of time for memorization, plus 4 hours
relaxation time. If the party is attacked before the first 4 hours are
up, no spells are learned. If the party is attacked after 4 hours and
15 minutes in camp, the magic-user has learned 1 magic missile spell.
After 4 hours and 30 minutes he has learned both magic missile spells,
and after 5 hours he has learned the invisibility spell as well.
   Once you have picked all the spells for one character, you Exit the
menu. The computer displays the spells you have chosen and asks you to
confirm the choices. If you confirm the choice, you go back to the
Magic Menu and can select spells for the next character who needs to
memorize them. If you cancel the choice, all the choices are ignored
and you must re-select all the character's spells.
 
   Scribe. Use this command to inscribe spells the character finds on a
scroll into his spell book.
 
   Scribe Menu:
 
   SCRIBE NEXT PREV EXIT
 
   The computer displays all the spells on scrolls that the magic-user
has cast read magic on. Find the page with the spell you wish to
scribe. Select the Scribe command. Then select the spell to scribe it
from the scroll into your spellbook. If a spell is of too high a level
for the character to scribe, the computer tells you so. Scribing the
spell erases it from the scroll. Scribing takes the same time as
Memorizing a spell, and is unsuccessful if the total time is not taken.
 
   Display. Use this command to find out what magic spells are
currently working on the party in camp. This serves as a reminder of
obvious spells working on the entire party, such as bless or light, and
on individual members of the party, such as protection from evil or
invisibility. This also reveals subtle curses (though not the nature of
the curse) on the party or individuals in the party.
 
   Rest. To memorize spells, one must Rest. This takes you to the Rest
Menu described in the Encamp Menu description. Spells are not memorized
until the character has rested the necessary time.
   The Exit command in this use of the Rest Menu returns you to the
Magic Menu, not the Encamp Menu.
 
   SPELLS AVAILABLE
   A beginning magic-user is given four first-level spells when he
leaves his master to adventure on his own. These are shown in the spell
book for the magic-user. Each time the magic-user gains a level of
experience, he gains one spell, even though the rise in level may give
him the ability to learn more than one new spell at a time. To gain
further spells, he must find scrolls in treasures and copy spells he is
capable of casting into his spell book, using the Scribe command in the
Magic Menu.
 
   CLERICAL MAGIC
   Clerical magic is very similar to magic-user magic, but a cleric
needs no spell books. All spells possible to his level are always
available to a cleric, he need only memorize them. Just what spells are
available depend solely on the level of the cleric.
   Therefore, when a cleric finds scrolls with clerical spells on them,
he can simply use them straight off the scroll, since they are not
something he needs to Scribe into a spell book.
 
   SAVING THROWS
   Magic is a chancy business. Many spells do not necessarily affect
their targets. This is simulated with saving throws. In Pool Of
Radiance the saving throw is the chance that the spell has no effect or
a lesser effect on the character it is cast on. As a character gains
levels, his saving throws improve, and the chance that magic affects
him is decreased. The final results of any spell are shown on the
computer screen.
   Magic-users have better saving throws against cast magic or magic
from items, clerics have better saving throws against death and poison,
and dwarves and halflings have better saving throws versus any form of
magic.
 
   THE SPELLS:
   Some spells are quick and can be cast in combat, and some take an
extra long time to cast. Those that take extra time can only be cast
when using the Magic Menu from the Encamp Menu.
 
   TIME AND MAGIC
   The duration of magic spells is important. A spell's duration is
either: instantaneous, as with most damage spells; measured in rounds,
as with most other combat spells; measured in turns, as with many
detection and protective spells; or permanent.
   When planning use of spells to use in movement (such as a find
traps), remember that one round equals one minute of game time and one
turn equals 10 minutes of game time.
 
   THE SPELL LIST
   The spells available for characters in the Pool Of Radiance are:
 
   FIRST LEVEL CLERICAL SPELLS
 
   Bless. This spell can only be used in camp or combat, and it only
affects those characters not in melee. It gives a bonus of one to their
THAC0 for six rounds and raises the morale of friendly NCPs by 1. Use
it in camp only if you know you are going into combat immediately
afterward.
 
   Curse. This reversal of bless affects enemies not in melee and
modifies their THAC0 and their morale by 1. Usable only in combat and
lasts 6 rounds.
 
   Cure Light Wounds. This can be used any time. The caster must be
next to the target. It heals 1-8 points of damage.
 
   Cause Light Wounds. This combat-only spell causes 1-8 points of
damage to one adjacent target touched by the caster.
 
   Detect Magic. This is similar to detect evil but only lasts 1 turn.
It detects the presence of magic in a 1 square by 3 square area, but
gives no details on the type of magic.
 
   Protection from Evil. This spell can be used in combat or in camp
when you expect to go into combat shortly. It adds 2 to the AC of the
character against evil attackers. Any saving throws caused by attacks

saving throw against this effect.

increases with the level of the magic-user. Everyone within that sphere

   Invisibility, 10' Radius. This is like invisibility but affects
everyone within 10 feet of the caster when it is cast. Everyone
affected stays invisible, and comes out of it normally, but if the
caster ends his invisibility, it ends for everyone.
 
   Lightning Bolt. This affects everyone in its path. It does 1-6

round. This can be used to negate haste. Its duration is 3 rounds plus
1 round per level of caster.
