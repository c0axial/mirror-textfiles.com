v3.1  Update Pattern selector, auto-update to new desktop when closing
- Changed pattern selection from a dialog to the active Control Panel to allow
for a more logical interface.  Includes Delete and Insert pattern.

save much space on your boot disk (2.5K vs 15.5K)

v2.5  Bug Fix
- Changed the handle size so that the resource and message will always

something with the DMA SCSI card System Software and System 5.03
changed that.
