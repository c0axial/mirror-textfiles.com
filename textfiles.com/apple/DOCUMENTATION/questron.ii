Your Quest: (As told by Merson, The Great Wizard)

"Though you have completed your quest to save the land of Questron from the
crazed magician Mantor and his Evil Book of Magic, the book Itself still exists.
The book is so evil that it cannot be destroyed by normal means.  Its very
presence, anywhere in our continuum, poses the threat of corruption and doom to
all civilizations.  You must journey back in time to ensure that this
abomination is never created.

"I will send you back through time and space to Landor, where Mantor has enticed
six mad sorcerers to create the Evil Book of Magic.  I have bent my power to
allow communication with Landor through the "Hall of Visions".  An important
early step in your quest is to search out the hall so that I can lend you my
guidance.  Through the hall I have learned a few scraps of information
concerning the situation on that troubled world. Within these parchments I pass
information on to you.

"You have never existed on Landor, so there you will not have the title and
standing you have earned on Questron.  My transportation spell is limited to
sending only you and a few items.  You shall take along the Evil Book of Magic,
for we would trust no other to guard it, and the glittering gold key.  Beyond
these items I can send you only the barest of equipment.  Also, the temporal
transition will cause the loss of some of your Questron-renowned power.

"When you get to Landor you must quickly gain equipment to improve your chances
of survival.  Talk to many, for you will have much to learn about the land and
its situation.  Regain your fighting prowess and equipment as soon as possible,
for Landor is at least as dangerous as Questron.  Learn how to survive in
cities, as well as the wilderness. Visit the cathedrals and learn their secrets.
Venture carefully into the castles.  And be ready for the dangers of the tombs
and dungeons.  To stop the six mad sorcerers you will have to brave the perils
of all these locations.

"Your victories on Questron prove you ae the only one we can send on mission.
You are our last, best hope of destroying the Evil Book of Magic. Go now; the
future of all people rides with you into the depths of the past."


Theory and Practice Of Time Travel


(As told Morle the Magician in his text "Magic for the Masses")

Moving through space you accept without question.  Moving through time you find
impossible to believe.  This is understandable, but foolish.  To a wizard, time
and space are but different sides of the same coin.  Just because your
experience forces you to see events occurring from past to future, do not be
fooled into believing the grand plan operates in that way.

Among wizards, time travel is a common phenomenon.  Yet it is often
misunderstood.  The fabric of time is self-repairing.  Going back in time to
prevent an event can do nothing to alter the years between the event and the
moment you move back through time.  Only the future after your departure will be
altered.  The past is but an elusive shadow - only the future can truly be
changed.

The Six Mad Sorcerers (As chronicled by Lady Myrando, Historian to His Majesty,
King Kelfar of The Realm of the Sorcerers.)


For decades the Council of Seven Sorcerers jointly ruled The realm of Sorcerers,
for no mortal king could challenge their magic and no king was allowed to be a
wielder of spells.  In the beginning the council's rulings were fair, but harsh.
But longer they ruled unopposed, the more despotic their decisions became.

As the council rulings became more self-serving and forced greater and greater
cruelty upon people, one member of the council was revolted by the misuse of
power.  Kelfar was a junior member of the council, but he understood that the
council members' vanity and suspicions were their weaknesses.  He secretly
gained the confidence of the common people, and dug to discover every
vulnerability of the other six members of the council.

When Kelfar was finally prepared, and the rest of the council was in total
disarray over a minuscule dispute, he renounced his sorcerers ways and took up
sword to become one with his followers.  With the common people behind him and
the scattered despots at their weakest, Kelfar struck down the power of the
council members and banished them as one from the civilized areas of the realm.
His joy claimed him His Majesty, King Kelfar, Lord of The Realm of the
Sorcerers!

His Majesty's rule ws wise and fair, but his mercy in banishing, and not
eliminating, his former comrades has cost the realm dearly.  For in banishing
them as one, His Majesty has provided the sorcerers with a common purpose.  The
sorcerers have hidden themselves somewhere in the realm and even now work to
being down His Majesty's rule.


The Evil Book of Magic


Sire,

My Sorcerers eyes and ears have been very active searching out the activities of
the Six Mad Sorcerers.  We know some thing of their plans, but of late their
mystic defenses have become much stronger.  The plague of monsters that has
nearly over-run the realm is but a by product of the hideous creatures they
create to protect themselves.

What I have learned is that The Six labor as on to create a great magic tome.
They continue to siper of an Evil Book of Magic and of an other-dimensioanl
leader who binds the group together.  The name Mantor is spoken when the group
believes it is alone.  The Six fear Mantor, and his power, but they see him as
the means to gain their revenge upon you.  I fear they are nearing completion of
whatever vile project they attempt.

Given your political position as the leader of your people (and the renunciation
of your sorcerers powers) and my creeping infirmity, neither of us is properly
equipped to challenge the six Mad Sorcerers and their other-worldly leader.
None of our own knights have been successful in finding, let alone
circumventing, their monstrous power.  I fear, your majesty, that without a hero
of mystical proportions, your reign, and our realm are doomed.  Heroes have come
unto the land before, and we must pray that one comes to us again.
