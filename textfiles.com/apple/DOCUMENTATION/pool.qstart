BEFORE BEGINNING PLAY: You should back up both sides of all four game disks with
the copy option on side 1 or a commercial copy program.  Put the originals away
and play off of the copies.

TO LOAD THE GAME: Connect you computer, monitor, and disk drive.  If you use a
joystick, plug it into the joystick port.  Set the Shift Lock key off and do not
press shift when typing in text.  Turn on the monitor, place side 1 into disk
drive 1, and then turn on the computer.

First you will be prompted to copy a disk.  Type "Y" to make a backup disk or
type "N" if you have already made backups of your masters.  Next type "Y" or "N"
if you wish to have the sound on.  After pressing "Y" or "N" for sound, you will
have the option of using a joystick by typing "Y" or "N" to use the keyboard.
Next, you will have the option to run your machine in Fast mode, type "Y" if
your machine has an accelerator card or //GS board, otherwise type "N."
Finally, the computer prompts you to change disks, place the correct disk in the
drive and press Return.  Press any key to pass the title screen.  After the
credits, press Return to play the game, or if you are using a joystick you will
now calibrate your joystick for play.  Once your joystick is calibrated, press
Return to play the game.  Two symbols and a path are displayed.  Find the first
symbol on the outside of the translation wheel, and the second symbol on the
inside ring of the wheel.  Match the two symbols and read the word under the
path from inside to outside.  After typing the translation, the game will load
and display the Party Creation Menu.

HOW TO MAKE CHOICES: Pool of Radiance is controlled by using menus.  One each
menu one item is highlighted.  To indicate the command you want, use the
joystick or cursor keys to highlight the command.  Press the joystick button or
Return to select your choice.  For example, to look at an overhead view,
highlight the Area command and press the joystick button or Return key.

Some commands, such as View, act only on a single character.  Use the joystick
or cursor keys to highlight the character you want to be active for the command.
Then, highlight the command and press the joystick button or Return key.  For
example, to view a character's ability scores, highlight the character's name in
the character list, highlight the View command in the Adventure Menu, and press
the joystick button or Return key.

Some commands toggle the program between two states.  When you select one of
these commands, the name on the screen changes to reflect the new state of the
program.  For example, if you select the Characters On command in the Pics menu,
it will change to Characters Off.  From then on the character's portrait picture
is not displayed when you view the character.

HOW TO MOVE AROUND: In 3D travel the party can move forward, turn right or left,
or move backwards.  In the wilderness or in combat you can move in any of eight
directions.  You may use the joystick or keyboard interchangeable to move in any
mode.  If you have a problem in making a diagonal move with a joystick in combat
or the wilderness, use the 2, 4, 6, or 8 keys instead.

TO BEGIN PLAY QUICKLY: A pre-rolled and pre-equipped party of adventurers are
stored as a saved game on disk side 4.  Choose Load Save Game from the Party
Creation Menu.  Insert disk side 4 in the drive when the game disk is requested.
After the saved game is loaded choose Begin Adventuring.  You will get a tour of
the main street of the civilized section of New Phlan.  When the tour is over
choose the Move command from the Adventure menu.

If you want to start the overall quest, turn around, go back to the city council
building and obtain a commission.  If you want to try out the game, walk forward
into the slums.  Once in the slums you won't have to go looking for danger,
danger will look for you!

TIPS ON SUCCESSFUL EARLY ADVENTURING: If you build your own party you will need
equipment before your adventure into the slums.  A shop selling arms and armor
is located at 8, 11.  Pool your money.  Buy fighters banded mail, a shield, and
a broad sword.  Buy clerics banded mail, a shield, and a flail.  Buy theives
leather armour, a broad sword, and a sling.  Buy your magic users a staff and a
couple of darts.  You may want to buy your fighters short bows and some arrows
or a two handed sword instead of a sheild.

Make sure you have at least 10 gold left over to pay for your lodging.  Use the
View, Items, and Ready commands to prepare all your characters' equipment for
battle.  Once you have bought everything you need, use the Take command and have
one character pick up all the money.

Go to the inn at 4,12, pay the money, and memorize spells.  Clerics should
memorize cure light wounds spells.  Magic users should memorize sleep spells.
Rest to memorize spells.

Keep Search "off" while you move through the slums, you don't want to attract
monster encounters.  After you clear the monsters from a room you can put Search
"on" and check for treasure.  Try the Area command to get a birds-eye view of
the slums.  The slums are 16 squares by 16 squares.

In many parts of the slums it is unsafe to rest.  But after you clear the
monsters from some rooms, the rooms become safe to rest in.  Clear out your
first safe room in the building at 13,1.  Here your party can rest to regain hit
points and memorize spells.  Adventure deeper into the slums, clearing other
safe rooms where your party can rest.  Whenever your party is low on sleep and
cure spells or hit points, return to the nearest safe room to rest up.

Once your characters have enough experience points and money, they should return
to the civilized area and train in the training grounds.  Before you train, go
into a shop and make sure each character is carrying atleast 1000 gp.  Remember
to Share your money after you Pool it to buy items.  If you find a particulary
difficult location to clear, go to the training hall in the civilized area and
hire a NPC to help.  Once your party clears the slums they should go to the city
council and get their reward.  Then take a boat to Sokal Keep and clear it.

After you successfully complete each mission, return to the city council for
your reward and news of any other commissions available.  Once the council clerk
has read you a commission, it's yours!  Carefully note the messages,
proclamations, journal entries, and other clues you get for the best chance to
solve the mysteries of Phlan.  Good luck!

RULES ERRATA:  Wilderness encounters replace your party's icon, they do not
appear adjacent to it.  Charmed characters will not join your party, but they
will fight on your side for one battle.  Evil clerics Turn undead, they do not
charm them onto your side.

DIFFERENCES IN APPLE ][ VERSION: The Apple // version of Pool of Radiance is
slightly different than the rules.  These differences include:

Pressing the <ESC> key is the same as choosing the Exit command in a menu.
While moving in combat, the <ESC> key will "take back" your current move, but it
will not erase any damage taken during the move.

The Monster Portrait On/Off isn't uesd on the Apple // version.

The "<" and ">" keys can be used for menu cursor up and down.

There is no Exit to DOS on the Party Creation Menu.  Turn your computer off and
then on to run other programs.  A character's portrait picture is only shown in
the civilized area.  Some items can only be Readied in combat or in camp.  If
you try to ready these items in other places, the computer responds "NOT HERE."

The following commands can be given at the Combat menu or while a party
character is moving under computer control.  Press the key to execute the
command.

      C : Sets all characters to computer control.
<Space> : Resets all characters to manual control.
      M : Toggles magic on or off for characters set to Quick.

Characters set to Quick will always use Readied Magic Items.  Characters with
Readied arrows will use bows if no enemy is adjacent.
