COMMANDS

ESC   = Restart or exit demo mode
CTRLS = Sound on/off
P     = Pause
Space = Continue

I = UP
J = LEFT
K = RIGHT
M = DOWN

OPTIONS
-------

After  you  enter  your  options,  press  RETURN. If you don't want to
change an option, pressing RETURN will enter the option shown. 

MODE: ENTER P OR T (for Practice or Tournament) In the practice  mode,
you  choose  the  pieces  to  play  against and their positions on the
screen. The computer will ignore the numbers after the Round and Level
options. 

In Tournament mode, the computer chooses the pieces you  play  against
and their positions. 

ROUND: ENTER 1-9
----------------

The  higher  the number you enter, the greater the number of pieces on
the board. Round one starts with four pieces. One additional piece  is
added  each  round.  No  more than 25 pieces will be placed on any one
board, however. This option isn't valid in practice mode. 

LEVEL: ENTER 1-9
----------------

The skill level  determines  the  complexity  of  the  playing  pieces
selected  for play in the tournament mode. This option is not valid in
practice mode. 

SPEED: ENTER 1-9
-----------------

This is the speed at which the pieces  make  their  moves.  1  is  the
fastest and 9 is the slowest. Should a player wish to follow the moves
in  detail,  a  slower  speed  should  be  selected. Once a player has
mastered the  moves,  a  faster  speed  will  allow  victory  to  come
swiftly! 

RETRACE? ENTER Y OR N (YES OR NO)
---------------------------------

Retrace  refers  to  the  ability  to  land  on a square that has been
occupied previo usly by one of the player's  pieces.   If  you  choose
"No",  once  a player lands on a square, it can't be occupied again by
either one of the player's or the  computer's  pieces.  These  squares
willbe  marked  as you go along so you know which ones can't be landed
on.  If a computer's piece lands on one of these squares, it will make
its move again according to its set pattern. A player loses  the  game
by  landing  on one of these squares. In a two-player game you can use
this option to be able to block your opponent's path to the other side
of the board.  If you choose "Yes", any of the squares may  be  landed
on again by either players' or the computer's pieces. 

MOVES AHEAD: ENTER 1-4
----------------------

This  is the number of moves you choose before you get the opportunity
to pick another move or set of moves. During play,  first  your  piece
makes  one  move,  (In  two-player  mode, the second player would then
move), then the computer's pieces move and you continue  to  alternate
moves. In the tournament mode, you must choose at least two moves. 

PLAYERS: ENTER 1 OR 2
---------------------

If  you  choose  1,  your  piece  just  needs  to avoid the computer's
pieces.  Choosing 2 means you have to avoid not  only  the  computer's
pieces,  but  an  opponent's as well. In the two-player version, moves
may not be deleted.  Once entered, they stand. 

GAME ID: XXXX
-------------

With the //E the arrow keys also work

You can't move diagonally. If the player's piece comes in contact with
any other piece, the game is over. 

Once the player's piece moves, each of the other pieces on  the  board
move.  The direction each other piece moves depends on two factors: 

1. The type of piece
2. The direction the player's piece moved

If  the  computer's piece lands on another of its own pieces, it makes
its own move again. 

WRAP AROUND
-----------

The computer's pieces can wrap around the  screen  when  making  their
moves.  Your  piece  will  not  wrap around. If you enter a move which
would take your piece off the edge of the screen, it will count  as  a
move, but your piece will stay in the same place. 

The four-digit ID code on the left represents the last game played and
the  one  on  the  right  shows  the  current  game  either pending or
underway.   You  may  enter  0-9  and  A-F  as  identification  codes.
Exceptions: you can't use 0000 or have two zeros on either the left or
the  right.   Tournament  games can be replayed at a later date if you
remember the Round, Level and Game ID  code  combination.  Enter  this
information in the options. 

TO PRACTICE
-----------

After  you  have  entered  your options, press ESC, then choose the ID
numbers of the pieces you want to play  against.  Press  return  after
choosing  the  number.   See  the  chart  below  for  the ID #s of the
pieces.  Use the I,J,K,M keys to position the  pieces  on  the  board.
Press  return  when  each  piece is in the position you want. When you
have entered as many pieces as you want (1-25), press ESC to begin and
choose a starting location for your piece. Enter 1-8, or "N"  for  New
if you decide you want a different board setup. 

In  practice  mode  with  only one player and more than one move ahead
chosen, the "/" key allows a move (or moves) to be erased.  You  can't
erase  the  last move, however, since once that is entered, the pieces
begin to move. On the Apple //E, the DELETE key  also  works.   During
move  selection,  pressing  "?"  allows  you to review the options you
selected. Press any key to return to the game. 

TO PLAY IN TOURNAMENT MODE
--------------------------

You must choose at least two moves ahead. After  you've  entered  your
options,  press ESC. If you want to use a different setup, press N for
New. Then choose the square you want your piece  to  start  on.  Enter
1-8.   To  choose  your moves, use the I,J,K,M keys. In the two-player
mode, players alternate selecting moves. The  computer's  pieces  move
according to the chart below. 

During  move  selection, pressing "?" allows the review of the options
selected Press any key to return to the game.  If you lose,  the  game
will  go back into Demo mode. Press ESC to begin another game, press R
to Replay the last game with the same setup  or  press  I  to  see  an
instant replay.
