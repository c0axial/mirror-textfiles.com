|     ABOUT INTELLIHACKER?                                                    |
|                                                                             |
|          About a year ago a got my Apple //e.  It was a great system,       |
|     and a fantastic upgrade from my cassette based TRS-80 model I.  I       |
|     had my first experiences with the TRS-80 and, since most of them        |
|     were bad, the Apple was an enormous improvement.                        |
|          I realized shortly after that, however, that programs are          |
|     really expensive and some aren't even so great.  That's why I was       |
|     drawn to pirating.                                                      |
|          A high school friend of mine introduced me to Apple pirating.      |
|     Before I even had a modem, I had several thousand dollars worth of      |
|     reasonably good pirated programs.  I learned a hell of a lot by         |
|     disassembling the boots of those programs, and finally, after           |
|     investing about $750 in a 1200 baud modem, a Super Serial Card,         |
|     and a modem program (Ascii Express, what else?), I started to           |
|     pirate on my own.  My first booty: Spy vs. Spy.                         |
|          But, fuck, AT&T was making a god damn fortune off of me.  I        |
|     had built a blue box before, but had been caught BBing and didn't       |
|     want to go through that shit again.                                     |
|          Another friend on a now defunct AE line told me how to use my      |
|     first extender.  It was an 800 extender used by GM and he warned me     |
|     not to get caught.  "After about a week," he said, "hack out a new      |
|     code.  Use MM//e."  I didn't have the slightest idea what mm//e was     |
|     but I took his advice and tried to hack out some codes.  Without a      |
|     program to do it, it's nearly fucking impossible.  And, after           |
|     getting MM//e, I found out it was only for the Micromodem.  Well, I     |
|     had spent a hell of a lot of money on an Applemodem 1200, and I         |
|     had every intention of putting it to use.                               |
|          I saw Smart Hacker on an AE line a few weeks later!  Great, A      |
|     phreaking tool for the Hayes Smartmodem, and mine is a compatible!      |
|     After downloading this, I found that you had to adjust a DIP switch     |
|     on the back of the modem, the DCD switch.  Well, Apple didn't think     |
|     to put this switch on the Applemodem, and I heard from a friend         |
|     everytime he wanted to use AE, he had to put the switch in its          |
|     original position again.                                                |
|          With no solution in sight, I made a decision to write a            |
|     program that should be compatible with every Apple computer system,     |
|     and be able to detect a carrier with no modifications.                  |
|          The result is IntelliHacker.                                       |
|                                                                             |
|                                                                             |
|                                                                             |
|                                                                             |

|     WHAT DOES INTELLIHACKER DO?                                             |
|                                                                             |
|          IntelliHacker is a multi-purpose hacking and phreaking tool.       |
|     Hacking is using your resources to illegally break into someone         |
|     else's computer via modem and access their data.  Successful            |
|     hackers are usually very dedicated and really don't care too much       |
|     about much else.  When you see a 19 year old buying VAX assembly        |
|     language manuals and walking around a major company looking at          |
|     license plates, you can be pretty sure that he is either nuts, or       |
|     is a hacker looking for some obscure bit of information that will       |
|     get him past the security of the system he has his sights on.           |
|          Phreaking, on the other hand, is making phone calls for free.      |
|     People used to do this with various colored boxes, but now, since       |
|     the phone companies have wised up and look for people using these       |
|     boxes, they are somewhat rare.  In addition, it's harder to box a       |
|     free call than it is to use an extender.                                |
|          An extender is a number that you dial, get a beep, dial an         |
|     authorization code, and dial the phone number that you want to          |
|     reach.  If you're not using your own authorization code, some other     |
|     sucker gets billed for the call.  These are dangerous, but since        |
|     it's impossible for a long distance company to detect you from a        |
|     valid user, they are usually only dangerous after extended periods      |
|     of time.  They also can't be used to make calls outside of the          |
|     continental U.S.                                                        |
|          IntelliHacker aids you in both hacking and phreaking.  In          |
|     addition, as you'll see later, it can even help you out if you just     |
|     want to harass the shit out of someone.  If you've got the              |
|     hardware, the guts, and if you aren't asleep yet, read on, and          |
|     learn how....                                                           |
|                                                                             |
|     HOW INTELLIHACKER WORKS                                                 |
|                                                                             |
|          Intellihacker is made up of several modules:                       |
|               1. Terminator                                                 |
|               2. Code Breaker                                               |
|               3. Scan Man                                                   |
|                                                                             |
|          I will deal with each one separately.  It is a good idea to        |
|     read about them all in order, since I may refer to each of them         |
|     from within the description of the other.                               |
|                                                                             |
|     TERMINATOR                                                              |
|                                                                             |
|          In the movie, The Terminator, the terminator is a hunting          |
|     machine.  He hunts until he finds his prey.  And if you're his          |
|     prey, it's terminal.  Well, IntelliHacker's Terminator works the        |
|     same way.                                                               |
|          The terminator program looks for carriers.  If you saw that        |
|     dreadful movie, WarGames, you saw that the kid had a program that       |
|     just looked for terminals.  Well, that's what terminator does.          |
|          If you're a hacker looking for new prey, this is your program.     |
|     It is based on suffixes and prefixes.  The prefix is a number that      |
|     you set one time and it stays the same.  It is the first part of        |
|     number that you want to dial.  An example might be 212-637-.  This      |
|     is the first part of 212-637-2938, 212-637-4949, and about 9998         |
|     other numbers.  The suffix, as you might have guessed, is a four        |
|                                                                             |

|                                                                             |
|     digit number that is tacked on the end.  The suffix is the part of      |
|     number that changes.  You might try a range of suffixes, like 2112      |
|     to 9999.  If your prefix is 212-637- this will try out every number     |
|     between 212-637-2112 and 212-637-9999.  That's as complex as            |
|     suffixes get!                                                           |
|          Prefixes can be more complex, though.  If you use an 800           |
|     extender to call the number, the prefix might be:                       |
|                                                                             |
|                     1-800-738-3849,,,,,828392 212-637-                      |
|                                                                             |
|          The 1-800-738-3849 is the number of your extender number.  The     |
|     ,,,,, is to delay until the extender number is ready for you to         |
|     dial your code.  Since the Smartmodem recognizes each comma as two      |
|     seconds, this will delay 10 seconds.  The 828392 is your                |
|     authorization code, and the 212-637- is your area code and              |
|     exchange.  That's about as complex as prefixes get.                     |
|          When the program askes you for starting and ending suffixes,       |
|     put in any range of numbers that you want.  They must be four           |
|     digits long though.  If the starting suffix is higher than the          |
|     ending suffix, the computer will know to count backwards.               |
|          You can have the carrier numbers that it finds sent out to         |
|     disk, and/or you can have them printed out.  If you prefer to watch,    |
|     you can do that too.  You can have the speaker either on or off.        |
|          If you want to change the speaker status, just press joystick      |
|     button 0 or open-apple.  Hold it down until it finishes calling the     |
|     number it is trying.  Let it go when you see on the status board        |
|     that the speaker is off (or on, if it was already off).                 |
|          If you want to pause the program, perhaps to make a phone call     |
|     or build a bomb, press joystick button 1, or solid-apple.  When you     |
|     here the bell the computer is in pause mode.  Let go and go about       |
|     your business.  Just press the same button to start it up again.        |
|          If you want to abort the procedure all together, just hold         |
|     both buttons down at once.  When you hear the bells, the program is     |
|     calling it quits.  You will be taken back to the main menu.             |
|                                                                             |
|     CODE BREAKER                                                            |
|                                                                             |
|          Boy, these dox are long!  But, shit, it took me a few weeks        |
|     to write the programs and I'm no bum.  There's a lot to them!  But,     |
|     I realize that everyone wants to run the program, so I'll condense      |
|     the rest of the dox.                                                    |
|          Code Breaker looks for authorization codes for a long distance     |
|     number that you supply.  The number for Sprint here in NY is            |
|     950-0777.  This is the number that you would put in as the long         |
|     distance company's number.                                              |
|          You then put in a range of codes to try.  They must be of the      |
|     same length.                                                            |
|          There are more features to Code breaker, like increments.  If      |
|     you've used MM//e Hacker, you now that it counts in sequence.  So       |
|     does Code Breaker, but you define the sequence.  Even though Code       |
|     Breaker will count backwards, you must put in a positive number for     |
|     the increment.  To make it count backwards just make the starting       |
|     code larger than the ending code.                                       |
|          You can also have randomness with Code Breaker.  Just say yes      |
|     to the randomness feature and the program will stay within your         |
|     bounds, playing tricks with the increment.                              |
|                                                                             |

|          Unlike Terminator and most other modem hacking programs, Code      |
|     breaker also write and saves the bad codes to disk.  The reason is      |
|     simply this: with the randomness feature on, you have no other way      |
|     of telling what numbers, bad or good, you've tried.                     |
|          If this is an inconvenience, let me know.                          |
|                                                                             |
|     SCAN MAN                                                                |
|                                                                             |
|          If you call a lot of AE's you know what it's like to get a         |
|     busy signal all night.  And redialing with the modem is no fun.         |
|          What this program does is scans a few BBS or AE or Whatever        |
|     numbers until one picks up and you get a carrier.  It then either       |
|     switches you to Terminal Mode or boots the AE disk.                     |
|          You have a directory with Scan Man.  It contains your computer     |
|     numbers.  You can delete or add numbers as you please, keeping up to    |
|     fifty numbers at a time.  You will also be asked for a key by which     |
|     to identify the number.  An example key might be the password or the    |
|     name of the BBS.  It's up to you, but there is a 34 character length    |
|     limit on the key.  You will also be asked if you use an extender        |
|     for this number.  If you reply yes, the computer will automatically     |
|     dial whatever extender number you are using at the time.  This way,     |
|     when you change extenders (do it frequently) you don't have to          |
|     revise the entire directory.                                            |
|          When asked for the extender number, put in the long distance       |
|     phone company's number, the time delay commas, and the authorization    |
|     code.  Scan Man will automatically dial it before the numbers that      |
|     you ordinarily use with extenders, and won't dial it for numbers        |
|     that you don't ordinarily use with extenders.                           |
|          You can, of course, delete numbers from the directory, but by      |
|     no means should you delete every number!  This will cause an error      |
|     and Scan Man will not work!!!!                                          |

|     speaker status.                                                         |

|     CALL ME                                                                 |
|          If you have any problems, comments, suggestions, or just want      |
|     to gab, call the Protestor's AE/BBS at 512-396-0780.  It's not my       |
|     AE but I am in charge of the Anarchy Board.  It's got all the           |
|     latest wares and one of the coolest sysops around.  Give it a ring.     |
|          And Keep your eyes peeled for IntelliHacker V2.0.  It will be      |
|     a result of the feedback I get through the Protester's AE/BBS and       |
|     a few other that I belong to.                                           |
|          Now, Scan, man.                                                    |

|     BY THE WAY                                                              |
|          If you want to really harass the shit out of someone, put          |
|     their name and number in the Scan Man Directory.  Then leave it on,     |
|     calling their house every 30 seconds.  Also, Put their name on the      |
|     directory and pass the program around with their name on and a note     |
|     to bother the shit out of them.  Before you know it, they're            |
|     getting calls from all kinds of pervs and who knows what the fuck       |
|     else!!!!!  Great, huh???  Try it on your teacher some time.             |
