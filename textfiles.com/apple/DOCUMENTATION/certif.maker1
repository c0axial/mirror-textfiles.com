 INTRODUCTION
--------------

Certificate  Maker  provides  more  than  200  professionally  designed,
partially- completed certificates, called templates for you  to  use  in
making  certificates  for  any occasion. Some templates are intended for
specific occasions such as academic achievement, sporting  triumphs  and
so  on;  these  include a title and appropriate artwork. Other templates
are multi-purpose; they haveno artwork and only a  partial  title  like:
CERTIFICATE OF..... 

To  make  a  certificate,  all you have to do is select the template you
want, (a complete list of the template numbers  and  what  they  contain
will be found later on in these dox) choose a border and type style, and
fill in the blanks with the recipient's name and achievement. 

For  those  occasions when you want to present personalized certificates
to several peopl, Certificate Maker has  a  feature  called  the  *NAME*
WILDCARD   that   lets   you   insert  names  into  otherwise  identical
certificates. 

The information you enter is added to a  template  when  you  print  the
certificate. The templates themselves remain intact and can be used over
and over. 

THE ELEMENTS OF A CERTIFICATE
------------------------------

Basically there are 4 parts to a certificate: 


>  TITLE:  Some  templates  include a complete title such as MATHEMATICS
AWARD or MOST VALUABLE MEMBER, while other templates provide  a  partial
title like CERTIFICATE OF...., or a completely blank title area. 

>  GRAPHICS:  Many  templates  include  an  illustration to spice up the
certificate and add the professional, or humorous, touch. 

> BORDER: There are 24 designs to choose from. Samples  of  each  border
appear on a special Border menu in the program. 

>  TEXT:  Every  template  provides space where you can type in specific
information about an award. Most templates also include a line  for  the
date  and your signature. Certificate Maker has five font styles and two
font sizes from which you may choose. 

Entering the special code *NAME* in your text instructs CM to print  the
same certificate several times, with a different name on each copy. 

A  seperate  procedure  allows you to create "name" files containing the
names of the people in your office, classroom,  or  organization.   Just
before  you  print a certificate that has the *NAME* wildcard in it, the
program asks you to choose the names you want to use. 

USING THE KEYBOARD
-------------------

The following table shows the keys used in Certificate Maker. 


Function              Key            Description

                or a list of options.


[esc]           Use [esc] to cancel your work on one
                screen and return to the previous screen.

                When entering text, use [esc] to delete
                the text on the current line and move the
                cursor back to the previous line.

                cancel your work and return to the Main
                Menu. From there, you can start over or
                exit from Certificate Maker.

[backarrow]     Use the backarrow or delete key to erase

[delete]        characters to the left of the cursor.


SETTING UP AND RUNNING C.M.
----------------------------

BEFORE YOU START: 

If you plan to use the *NAME* wildcard feature, initialize a floppy disk
for *NAME* file storage. Use ProDOS to initialize your disk. 

*NAME* files must be stored on a seperate floppy disk.  They  cannot  be
kept  on  the  Certificate  Maker Master Program disk or the Certificate
Catalog disks. A single floppy disk can hold all your *NAME* files. 


TO START CERTIFICATE MAKER: 

Insert the Master Program disk in drive 1 and turn on your computer.  If
you  have  two disk drives, insert the Certificate Catalog disk in drive
2. 


TO EXIT FROM CERTIFICATE MAKER: 

1. Return to the Main Menu by pressing [Ctrl-R]. 

2. Select the Exit Program option (if you want to run  another  software
ap- plication), or turn off your computer. 


HOW TO MAKE A CERTIFICATE: 
---------------------------

Listed  below  are the 12 steps necessary for making a certificate. Each
step is described in detail after this list. 

1. Select MAKE CERTIFICATE from the Main Menu

2. Enter the template number. 

3. Select the border of your choice. 

4. If the certificate is blank, then select the Title Font  Style.   (If
the  certificate  is  not  blank, but is partial, then it will skip this
step)

5. If the certificate is partial, then enter the Title Text. 

6. Select the Body Font Style. 

7. Enter the Body Text. 

8. Enter the Date Line. 

9. Enter the Signature Line. 

10. Select *NAME* file to use. (This step is taken only if  you  used  a
wild- card *NAME* in step #7)

11.  Select  names  to  print  from the *NAME* file you selected in step
#10. 

12. PRINT MENU - Print the certificate. 



MAIN MENU
----------

Select MAKE CERTIFICATE if you want to create a certificate. 

Select *NAME* FILE if you want to create or edit  a  list  of  names.  A
*NAME*  file  list  can  be merged into a certificate to produce several
personalized copies of the same certificate. The program goes to  Screen
A, Select *NAME* file option (described in more detail later). 

NOTE: This option is used to add or delete names from a *NAME* file, not
to  select the names to be printed on any given certificate. Actual name
selection is done in the Make Certificate procedure. 

Select EXIT PROGRAM to leave CM and return to ProDOS. 

No matter where you are in CM, you can press [Ctrl-R] to Return to  this
menu. 


ENTER TEMPLATE NUMBER
----------------------

Enter the number of the certificate template you want to create. 
     
     Templates 1 - 39 are on Disk 1, Side B. 
     
     Templates 40 - 127 are on Disk 2, Side A. 
     
     Templates 128 - 220 are on Disk 2, Side B. 

Illustrations  of  the  certificates appear in the back of the origional
manual.  There is no way to see the certificates before you  print  them
unless  you  have the origional docs that come with the program when you
buy it. So I would hope that some bright, young, "hacker" out  there  in
the  pirate  community would make a small program that could read in and
display the different certificate graphics contained on these  disks  to
the apple hi-res screen. 


SELECT THE BORDER
------------------

You should be able to figure this out for yourself! Just move the cursor
to  the  border  of  your  choice.   The NEW DISK option is reserved for
future additions to CM. 

SELECT THE FONT STYLE
----------------------

Select the font style you want for the certifcate title. 

This screen only appears if the certificate has space for you to enter a
title AND if that area is completely blank. (Examples:  Certificate  218
and 219)

If  there  is space for you to enter a title, but the title area already
has some text, such as CERTIFICATE OF.... or THE WORLDS  BEST....,  then
the  title font style is chosen by the program to match the text already
in place. 

As you scroll through the list of five font names, you can see a  sample
of each font at the bottom of the screen. The fonts are: 

  SERIF
  SAN SERIF
  SCRIPT
  GOTHIC
  ART DECO

The  font  style  appears  only  on  the printed certificate, not on the
screen while you are entering the title. 

The NEW DISK option is reserved for future CM additions. 


ENTER THE TITLE TEXT
---------------------

Enter a title for your certificate. 

This screen only appears for those  csrtificates  that  have  space  set
aside for you to enter a title. 

You may press [Ctrl-S] to toggle the FONT SIZE between small and medium.
The cursor will change size to show the selected size. If you enter some
text  on  a  line  and then press [Ctrl-S], the size of the text on that
line will change. All the text on any given line must be the same  size,
but you can change the size from one line to the next. 

The  NUMBER  OF LINES ON THE SCREEN indicates how many lines of text you
may enter for the title. The number may change  depending  on  the  font
size you select. These lines do not appear on the printed certificate. 

As you type, the TITLE IS CENTERED on each line. 

Note  for  MULTIPLE-LINE TITLES: While word wrap does work, you may also
press [return] to move the cursor from one line to the next. 

Pressing [return] on the last line ENDS THE TITLE ENTRY. 


SELECT THE BODY FONT STYLE
---------------------------

Select the font style you want for the body of the certificate. You  can
see the samples of the different styles at the bottom of the screen. The
fonts are: 

  SERIF
  SAN SERIF
  SCRIPT
  GOTHIC
  ART DECO

The  font  you choose for the body of the text will also be used for the
date text. 

You may choose any of the 5 fonts, regardless of the font used  for  the
certificate  title.  Usually,  a certificate looks best when you use the
same font for both the title and the body text. 

Once again, the NEW DISK option is for future CM additions. 


ENTER THE BODY TEXT
--------------------

This is basically the same as entering the text  for  the  title  except
that you are entering it for the body of the certificate. 

The text is centered on each line. 

To  make  typing  corrections, use the [backarrow] and [delete] keys. To
delete an entire line of text, press [esc]. 

Pressing [return] on the last line ends the text entry. 

TO PERSONALIZE SEVERAL COPIES OF THE CERTIFICATE: 

Type *NAME* all by itself on the  line  where  you  want  each  name  to
appear.   Don't  put  any  other  text  on  the line that has the *NAME*
wildcard. Just before you print the certificate, the  program  will  ask
you  what  *NAME*  file  and which names from that file that you want to
use. (Creating name files will be explained later in these dox)


ENTER THE DATE LINE
--------------------

Enter the date text you want to appear on the certificate. 

Entering a date is optional. You may  decide  to  leave  the  date  area
blank,  or  you  may enter some text other than a date. The line and the
word "date" that you see on the template, do not appear on  the  printed
certificate. 

Because  of  the  amount  of  space available, not all certificates have
enough room to spell out an entire date such as  "September  23,  1987."
The  amount  of space allowed for the date is indicated by the length of
the line on the screen. 

The font style for the date text is the same as what you chose  for  the
certificate text. The font size is small and cannot be changed.
