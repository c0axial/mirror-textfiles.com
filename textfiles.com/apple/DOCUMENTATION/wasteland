                                 The Crackforce

Getting Started

The first thing you must do before playing Wasteland, is copy sides 1-4 using
CopyA or a similar program. Remove write protect tabs from sides 1-4 and you are
ready to begin.

Insert the boot disk, turn on your computer, and the game will automatically
load. You will then see the title screen with two options at the bottom: 'Start'
and 'Utils'. Press S to start gameplay, or U for utilities.

Utilities Menu

To use and option, press the first letter, or use arrows to choose:

Copy Since the Crackforce removed all copy protection from Wasteland there is no
need to use this option. It will not work because it assumes you have an
original, so use CopyA or Fast Copy to copy sides 1-4. You need not copy side 0,
the boot side, because it is not used after the game is started.

Restart Automatically restarts your party near the Ranger Center. Use this
command if your party is hopelessly stuck somewhere, or if you want to start the
game over with the same characters. To restart, save the game where you are.
Copy all sides with CopyA or Fast Copy. Insert the Boot disk (disk 0), reboot,
select U at the menu, then select R at the next menu. Next, insert the old side
1 when the message "Please put side 1 in drive 1." Then insert the new copy of
side 1 when you see "Please put destination Wasteland character disk in drive
1." Now you're ready to start over with your old characters - minus all the
items and cash they were carrying.

Prints all of your characters' statistics.

Start
Starts the game. You're asked "Use last saved game (y/n)?" Choose Y if you want
to start where YOU last saved the game with the Save command. Choose N and
you'll start where the COMPUTER last saved the game (Which happens anytime you
answer "yes" to "Enter new location?"). With either choice, you'll be prompted
to insert one or more disk sides. If you're new to the game, you'll start in the
Ranger center.


IMPORTANT: Wasteland is a dynamic game, and it's very important that you
understand how it keeps track of and saves the game. As you play, the game
constantly changes, and permanently updates those changes to the disk. Once you
change something, it's changed forever! If you pick up an item from a spot, you
can't return to that spot and find it there again. If you kill the wrong person,
you can't go away and then come back hoping to find him or her alive.

The game is divided up into many locations. Any one of the following could be a
location: a floor in a building, a section of a desert, a path in a sewer. In
the course of your adventure, you'll often be asked "Enter new location (Y/N)?"
If you answer "yes," the game will save and changes to that location, and your
party's status. If you switch to another location by viewing a disbanded party,
the statuses for all the parties are saved on whatever disk side you end up on.

If you use the Save command, your location and party status is saved to side 1.
The next time you load Wasteland, and answer "yes" to "Use last saved game?" and
pick up where you left off. However, if you ar your computer shuts down before
you can use Save, then answer "no" when asked "Use last saved game?" The program
will search for the place where it was last saved. This way, you're unlikely to
lose any important items you've acquired.

What can you do if a character dies? Don't save the game. shut the computer off
and reboot. Answer "mo" when asked "Use last saved game?" Your characters will
now come back alive, but without the items they acquired since the last time you
saved.

Time and Distance

The maps in Wasteland vary in scale. The large desert map contains the various
city maps, which, in turn, contain building maps or whole underground levels of
sewers and hideouts. In combat, distances may seem a bit off for the map you're
on, but these are tactical distances and are valid in combat only.

Because of the difference in scale of the maps, time passes differently on them.
Though a single keystroke on the computer will move you one space north in both
the desert and in a building, the amount of time that each move takes is
different. The game takes this into account for healing and deterioration
purposes. Remember that time passers for characters in the main party as well as
for any disbanded characters who are not moving. If you disband a character and
send him off to find a doctor to help a wounded comrade, the seriously-wounded
character will still bleed away.

If you want time to pass without moving your party, press <ESC>.
