Here is the last update of Disk Disintegrater DeLuxe:  Version 5.0.
You will find many new features in this version, here is a list of what have
been added or modified since version 4.2a:

 o  If you have a mouse, you can use it (//gs).
 o  D.D.DeLuxe remembers your last drive access so you can call back the last
    catalog you made.
 o  You can quit quickly, anywhere in the program by pressing CTRL-Q.
 o  There are more ways to quit the program.
 o  When you format a disk, you can specify a volume name and also, the disk is
    now prodos bootable.
 o  When you format a 3.5 disk on a //gs, you can now specify the interleave
    you wish to use to get a faster 3.5 disk (to know more about interleave
    please read notes about interleave in the D.D.DeLuxe documentation...).
 o  There are more options to configure.
 o  Each time you use the CTRL-I (insert on/off) in the mini-editor or at
    others places, the insert on mode remain on even if you use arrows.
 o  The size of the D.D.DeLuxe buffer is now displayed on the main menu screen.
 o  The time of day is always displayed on screen (//gs).
 o  You can configure the program to show TXT, REL or/and APW files in partial
    catalog mode.
 o  You can now rename a prodos volume.
 o  When you ask to view DDD info, you can now save the info-file or you can
    print it on your printer.
 o  You can now view on screen or print on your printer normal text files,
    appleworks APW files or any other prodos files (view hex bytes).
 o  In catalog mode, you can execute a SYS program directly.
 o  You can now analize a DDD file without unpacking it to check if the file is
    good.
 o  Now, D.D.DeLuxe can use your full 128k on a //e or //c as buffer when
    packing and unpacking. 
 o  On a //gs, D.D.DeLuxe can now use //gs memory as buffer.
 o  Each time you pack a 3.5 disk, you can specify a suggested interleave for
    the disk you pack.
 o  There is now a "buffer meter" when you pack/unpack.  With this meter, you
    can see D.D.DeLuxe put or remove bytes to the buffer.
 o  You can now pack/unpack new 3.5 1.44M disk.
 o  When you run the program an a //gs and you pack/unpack a 3.5 disk,
    D.D.DeLuxe eject the 3.5 disk automacticly and also, detect when you put
    a 3.5 disk in the drive (1 drive operation).
 o  The program, in general, is faster.
 o  And many others littles modifications you will discover...

To know more about all these features, read the documentation on the side 2 of
the D.D.DeLuxe disk.



NOTES:
------

a) When will run D.D.DeLUXE V5.0, you will have to re-configure it because
   V5.0 do not use the same configuration file as previous versions.

b) If you use the loading file "D.D.DELUXE.LOAD", you must replace it by the
   new one.

c) All DDD files packed with V4.0, V4.1, V4.2, V4.2a are compatible with
   D.D.DeLUXE V5.0.

d) To unpack old DDD 2.1 files (disk packed with PBH, DDD Pro, and other 
   DDD 2.1 comptabile program), you proceed the same way you do with
   D.D.DeLUXE DDD files.

e) When you unpack an old DDD 2.1 file, there is no guarantee the unpacked
   disk is exactly the same as the original disk because there is no checksum
   in the old DDD file.  But if you unpack a new DDD file (type $DD, with
   message in the file), if D.D.DeLUXE unpack without checksum error, you can
   be sure your unpacked disk is exactly the same as the original disk.

f) The documentation has been updated for V5.0 now.

g) If you have an Apple //gs, please replace your old icon file by the new
   one (DDDELUXE.ICONS) in the ICON folder.
