Note: I will symbolize the open-Apple key with the "@". @-a = open-Apple a.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Required equipment:
Apple //e or //c
Appleworks boot disk and system disk
One Prodos formatted data disk (the program will format it for you)

** Note **
in  the  lower  right-hand  corner,  an  approximate  memory available
indicator will appear. If you have a //e with ext. 80-col. Card  or  a
//c, the number will be 55k. An un-expanded //e will show 10k. 

To begin, insert the Appleworks startup disk and press ctrl-@-reset to
boot up. (or if the Apple is off, turn it on.)

The disk will load PRODOS and ask you to switch disks. Do so and press
return. 

Next you will enter the date. (if you have a clock card in slot2 or 4,
all you have to do is check the year.) press return when all is well. 

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You should now be presented with the main menu. It says the follwing: 

   1. Add files to the desktop

   2. Work with one of the files on the desktop

   3. Save desktop files to disk

   4. Remove files from the desktop

   5. Other activities

   6. Quit

The  desktop  is  the  area of memory where your files are kept. (like
having a mess of papers in folders on your desk.)

Knowing  what  they  consider  a  desktop,  all  of  the   above   are
self-explanatory. 

Instead  of  going  into  each  menu  option  in depth (like I did for
"Locksmith 5.0 documentation"), I will go in to each function  of  the
progrm in depth (data base, word processor, spreadsheet). 

**  NOTE  **  When  main  menu  appears  use  #5,  other activities to
configure (type of printer,data drive) and to format a data disk. (see
part V for printer info.)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Part I : Data base understanding & operation
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

A data base is simply a program that keeps track of  groups  of  data,
called  records.  Each  record  is  a  group  of  entries in different
catagores, one entry from each catagory. 

Appleworks limits: 
 Max. # of records 1350
 Max. # of records, average 64k ram:140 128k ram:750
 Max. # catagories 30
 Max. length/record 1024 characters (1k)
 Max. length/entry 76 characters
 Max. length/catagory name 20 characters


Suppose you want to make a data base to keep track of  information  on
your  home  appliances.  You  will  need  catagories  such  as  "item"
(blender), "serial  number"  (#JWM233949272),  "model"  (super-blend),
"make"  (GE),  date of purchase" (1/2/82). Each item in parenthesis is
an entry in each catagory.  You boot up Appleworks, select #1  on  the
main  menu, select 4 on the sub-menu (data base file), and select 1 on
the sub-sub-menu (from scratch). You then enter the name of  the  file
("appliances").  You  enter  the  catagory names, one at a time, press
return after each. It will the tell you to start adding records. Enter
the sample entries above. When you are done you should  see  a  second
blank record. Press @-z (open-appl z).  You are now in multiple-record
layout.  (before  you  were  in single record layout.) if you had many
records, you would see them all "at-a-glance". 

That's basically a data base. Here are  some  helpful  features  Apple
threw in: 

@-a          Arrange the catagory the cursor's on alphabetically or
             numerically. (use the tab key to move cursor right,
             @tab for left).
@-c          Make a photocopy of certain records onto the clipboard
             (see Part IV : Cut and paste) or make a copy of the
             clipbard onto file
@-d          Delete a record
@-e          Toggle between edit cursor and insert cursor
@-f          Find a record
@-h          Screen dump
@-i          Insert a record
@-m          Move a record onto/off of clipboard
@-n          Change catagory name or file name
@-q          Goto another desktop file
@-r          Change record selection rules
@-s          Save current file
@-v          Set a default value for a catagory
@-y          Clear to end of entry
@-z          Toggle single-record/mulitple-record layout
@-1..@-9     Move through multiple-record layout
             @-1 = beginning      @-2..@-8 = middle  @-9 = end
@-?          Help
@-up arrow   Move up one screen
@-dn arrow   Move down one screen

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Part II : Word Processor
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Most  of  you  know  what  a  word  processor  is. When connected to a
printer, it's a computerized typewriter. Like you see on TV, it allows
deletion & insertion of text, correction of spelling errors, and  then
prints  a nice, neat paper with no signs of correction or "white-out."
this file was creatd  with  Appleworks'  word  processor.  (even  word
processors can't fix my typos so if you find some, please correct!)

Now  that we know what to do with a word processor we can find out how
Apple intends for us to command it. 

Restrictions: 
# of characters: 64k-10,000 128k- 56,000

** Note **
You don't have to hit return after each line. When  printed  out,  the
program  will  supply returns. Note the phrase "when printed." In your
file, the text looks like one long line. Excessive line length can and
will cause other word processors grief if you try and use Apple Writer
//e or Apple Works files in them. So decide early on if  it  is  worth
the candle. 

All you have to do is type. For lower case, release "caps lock".

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Part III : Spreadsheet
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

HMMMM...a  spreadsheet...let  me  see....A  spreadsheet  is like a big
piece of paper. The computer controls where  you  are  by  referencing
your  position as a numbered cell. (examples-A1,C4,AD27) the letter is
the column, the number is the row. Cell A1 is in column A and  row  1.
You can put letter,numbers,or formulas in a cell. By lining up numbers
and words, you can crete very meaningful information. 

Restrictions: 

Filled  cells:  64k-1000  128k-6000 Rows- 999 Columns- A through Z, AA
through AZ, BA through BZ, CA through CZ, D through DW.   Total  #  of
cells available for use:126,873 (999 rows times 127 columns)

To enter a label into a cell (letters explaining another cell), type a
letter  or  a  quote (") to signify a label. Then type the rest of the
label. 

To enter a value, type a number, or, to copy another cell, a plus sign
then the cell name (+B7 will copy the value in B7). 

To enter a  formula,  type  a  plus  sign  followed  by  the  formula.
Example:   +B7-B6-B5+A2  will subtract the value in B6 from that in B7
,subtract the value in B5 from that, and add the value in a2  to  that
total. 

To  enter  a  built in function, type an at-sign (@) [not open-Apple],
the name of the function, and the proper argument. 

Here's a list of functions and arguments.  Example- @abs(value)  means
use the "value" argument below. 

arguments:
value        A number or an expression that equals a number (i.e. +B7-B6)
range        A list of adjacent cells  (A10...A13) means cells A10-A13,
             inclusive.
List         List of values (14,A22,B17-B16,D12...F12)

Functions:

@ABS(value)             Absolute value of argument
@AVG(list)              Average value in list
@INT(value)             Integer value of argument
@MAX(list)              Largest value in list
@MIN(list)              Smallest value in list
@SQRt(value)            Square root
@SUM(list)              Sum of all values in list
@CHOOSE(value,list)     Like BASIC "on x goto zzzz,zzzz,..."
@COUNT(list)            # of numeric entries in list
@ERROR                  prints "error"
@LOOKUP(value,range)    Looks for largest entry less than/equal to value
@NA                     Display "na" (for not available)
@NPV(rate,range)        Display net present value based on interest
                        rate and payments in range
@IF(val,val1,val2)      If value is true, then value1 is returned.
                        If value is false, value2 is returned.

Example: @IF(A14<A15,D3,Z14)      @IF(S23>=2,W2,E3)

Part IV : Cut and Paste
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Q: What is the differnece between @-m (move to clipboard) and @c (copy
to clipboard)?? 

A: @-m will remove the information from where you got it and @- leaves
the info. Where you got it and puts a copy where you're copying to. 

Cut and Paste is a fancy term for moving text/records from one part of
a  file  to  a  part  of  another file or a different part of the same
file.  This is done using the "clipboard" to hold the text  while  you
select where to "paste" it. 

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Part V : About some printers.....
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

If  you  have an Apple DMP and no other printers:  You can do nothing.
Dmp is the default printer. 

If you have one of the following printers, you can select it when  you
configure: 

Apple  daisywheel  (dwp)  Apple  silentype  Apple imagewriter Epson mx
series or mx graftrax+ Epson rx Epson fx Qume sprint 5 or 11

If you have a dmp and a printer above:  Select which one will  be  the
main printer and select it. Put th other down as a secondary printer. 

If you don't see your printer:  Set up a "custom printer". 


for a custom printer,you need to know: 

Does  it  need  line  feed  after  each  return?   Will  it  accept  a
top-of-form command?  Should the program pause after each  page?   How
wide is the paper (in inches)? 

The    program    will    tell   you   how   to   enter   the   above.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Good luck with the program.....
