*** Diversi-Copy for 5.25 Disks ***

There was not enough room on this demo disk for the full Diversi-Copy
program and documentation.  The 5.25 copy program on this demo disk
is a short version.  When you send your $30 for Diversi-Copy, we will
send you a new Diversi-Copy disk with the full documentation and
program, which can also format ProDOS, Pascal, DOS 3.3, and CP/M
5.25 disks.  To use the short version, follow the screen prompts.

To get this version to copy 5.25 disks in a specific slot, get into 
BASIC and enter:

BLOAD DCOPY
POKE 2054,S (where S=4..7 slot number)
BSAVE DCOPY

*** Instructions - Diversi-Copy for 3.5 Disks ***

*** Making Copies ***

Diversi-Copy for the Unidisk 3.5 is a separate program included on
the Diversi-Copy disk. This program is called "UCOPY".  You can use 
the UniDisk 3.3 System Utilities disk to transfer "UCOPY" to any 
ProDOS disk, and execute it with a "BRUN UCOPY" command.

When you run the UCOPY program, it automatically finds the slot where 
your Unidisk 3.5 is located. The copying process works very much 
like Diversi-Copy for floppy disks. You may make 1-drive copies, or 
2-drive copies (if you have 2 Unidisks).

*** 1-Drive Copies ***

To make a 1-drive copy, insert your original disk in Unidisk drive #1
and hit <space>. The program will prompt you with screen messages
and beeps. You may hit 'S' to turn the beeps off and on.

To avoid writing onto your original by mistake, you may want to write
protect it by sliding the tab on the disk so the write protect hole
is open. The write protect hole on your duplicate must be closed, of
course.

*** 2-Drive Copies ***

Put your original in drive #1, and your duplicate in drive #2. Press
<return> to begin copying. Both disks are ejected when copying is 
complete.

*** Copy Features ***

When copying ProDOS or Pascal disks, Diversi-Copy skips all unused 
blocks, as shown by the disk directory. This greatly speeds up the 
copying process, unless your disk is nearly full.

If you want to copy these unused blocks for some reason, press "="
from the main menu (the one that says "Insert Original Disk in Drive
#1").

Before writing to a Unidisk 3.5, Diversi-Copy automatically formats
the disk. This takes about 45 seconds per disk, in addition to the
write time. When copying onto a "virgin" disk, i.e. right out of
the box, this step is necessary.

However, if you are re-writing over a disk that already has data on
it, you can skip this format step by pressing "F" from the main menu.
Press "F" again to restore formatting.

*** Halting ***

Hit <DELETE> to cancel a disk read or write in progress.  You can 
also hit the disk eject button to force an I/O error.

*** Apple //GS ***

Diversi-Copy uses the Apple //GS built-in 256K memory, and any memory 
plugged into the //GS memory expansion slot.  Diversi-Copy works with 
the new Apple Disk 3.5, as well as the UniDisk 3.5 connected to the 
//GS.

We recommend the Apple //GS with a single Apple Disk 3.5.  Then buy a 
1-megabyte Apple RAM card, or the GS-RAM (or GS-RAM plus) from
Applied Engineering.  This memory will allow 1-pass copying of any
disk, and will be very useful for future //GS programs.

Diversi-Copy will NOT use or destroy the memory on peripheral slot
RAM cards in the Apple //GS.

*** Screen Display ***

The bottom line on the screen shows the progress of your copy. The 
number at the left is the read block, which goes from 0000 to 1600 as 
the program reads in your original. To the right of this is the
write block, which also goes from 0000 to 1600 when writing the
duplicate.

The number of successful copies written is shown at the right. Press 
"R" from any menu to restore it to 0000.

*** Mass Production ***

Put your original disk in drive #1 and hit 'M'. Diversi-COPY will
read this original disk into memory and hold it. You can then write
multiple copies from memory without re-reading the original. If the
original disk does not fit into the available memory, the program
displays an error message. Otherwise, you will hear 2 beeps and see
a new menu.

On a 1-drive system, put a blank disk in drive #1 and hit <space> to
write each copy. On a 2-drive system, put blank disks in drives #1
and #2 and hit 'A'. Diversi-COPY will write to drive #1 and #2
alternately until you hit <ESC> or get a write error. You never have
to touch the keyboard. While Diversi-COPY is writing to drive #2,
put a new disk in drive #1, and vice-versa.

*** Errors ***

When something goes wrong in the copy process, Diversi-Copy will 
print an error number and explanation. If you forget to insert a 
disk, you will see the "OffLine - No Disk in Drive" error. Just 
insert the disk and try again.

If you try to write to a disk with the write-protect hole open, you 
will see the "NoWrite - Disk Write Protected" error. Slide the 
write-protect tab over the hole and try again (if you really wanted 
to write on this disk).

The other error you are likely to see is the "I/O Error". 
Frequently, this is caused when the disk did not insert properly. 
Try pushing the eject button, and re-inserting the disk.

The I/O error will also occur if you try to read a "virgin" disk as 
an original, or if you try to write onto a "virgin" disk without
formatting.  If the disk is copy-protected, it will also give an I/O 
read error.

Finally, some I/O errors are caused by defective, damaged, scratched,
or just worn-out disks. Hopefully, you will have used Diversi-Copy 
to back-up these disks before this happens.

When you get an I/O error during reading, Diversi-Copy will stop and 
ask you to press "T" if you want to try to read the block again.  
Hit <SPACE> to cancel the copy, or "I" to ignore the bad block.  If
you hit "I", then a block of all "0" will be substituted for the bad
block.  The file which contains this block will be partially lost.
