  THE QUEST

     The Caliph of Damaron was a powerful ruler in his youth; but now he's an old coot, and pretenders are plotting to further their own selfish ends in the kingdom.Orincess Sylphani, the Caliph's beautiful daughter, has been urging her father to name a successor before it is to late..

     The morning our story open's, Sylphani, as was her custom, was the first to enter the Caliph's chambers.But instead of her father, she discovered a Falcon on his bed.The Caliph was no longer human.

     The princess immediately summoned the royal physicians;but inspite of there supposed knoledge, they had no answer's.  However, the wise men were able to agree on this:  if the transformation was the result of a conjuror's spell, it would have to be broken soen.  Otherwise, the Caliph might be trapped as a foalson forever.

Princess Sylphani realized she needed a hero.  She remembered the orphaned boy who was raised at the palace by her own mother - the boy who had left to become a sailor when she was only ten years old.  She had made him promise to return if ever she needed him, and she couldn't imagine a greater need than this.

You, the mighty Sinbad, receive the summons from your childhood playmate, and immediately hasten to Damaron.  Overwhelmed at what a beautiful young woman Sylphani has become, you silently take a vow to do anything she requires.

The task is formidable.  You must marshal the Caliph's forces to guard the city; you must undertake a great voyage to learn how the Caliph can be saved; and, abouve all, you must keep Princess Sylphani under your constant protection.


ON THE TRAIL

At the crossroads, you see a signpost showing potential destinations.  Click on a city to go there.  At the top of the screen on the right side is an INFORMATION BAR that contains, from left to right, a Location Bos, a Restart Box, and a Music Box.  The Location Box tells you where you are.  Click on the Restart Box to begin your quest anew; click on the Music Box to toggle the music off and on.

Plan your travel's by clicking on the map on Sinbad's belt.  Check the precious time left to you by clicking on the Thersanill Stone next to your map.The time is represeneted by an hourglass;as you undertake your journeys, the sand fills the bottom of the glass. When the last grain of sand passes from the top, the Caliph's doom is sealed. You also use the hourglass to send order's to the armies of Damaron (see war is hell later) and check your progress on the quest.

If you are lucky enough to find a Genie, he grants you three wishes, and stays with you until you use all three. Click on his bottle to confer with him. You may choose any number of wishes; if  the one you see does not satisfy your desire, click on the bottom of the screen to see another. When you decide to accept a wish, click on the scroll.

Your odyssey will take you on ocean voyages as well as overland treks, and all the tools listed above are available to you in your cabin aboard the Sabaralus as well.

On the left side of the screen at the crossroads, and in your cabin aboard the Sabaralus, is the strength bar. If your strength is low, click on the strength bar for a rest for a day.

YOUR LOYAL CREW

Your ship, the Sabaralus, is the worthiest ship afloat, and your srew will defend it with their lives.  But, while you are on land, pirates are likely to attack your ship.  Each attack costs lives, and when your entire ship is gone, the pirates will take your ship. So, when you anchor, remember that large continents may have many ports.  If you try to explore the entire conitnent from a single harbor the journy may cost several lifes.  Also alway's remember where you leave your ship!!!

Each time the ship lands you must decide how many men to take with you, and how many to leave guarding the ship.

When you return to your ship to begin a voyage, you can send out a recruting party to recrute new crew member's, the best places to get new crew member's are in large port's..
