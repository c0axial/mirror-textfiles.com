Pcp Hacker Beta, Prelude

Contents:

One Pcp Hacker, Beta
One Pcp Scanner, Beta

The sheer size of these docs require that they should be printed out.  Several
portions of the program may get to be confusing, so it is wise to have a copy
of the documentation ready in case you have an problems.

Notice to all programmers : Feel free to improve upon and release future
versions of this program.  If you do release future versions, please keep
credit to me for the original version.

I.  Introduction

        For awhile now the Apple users who use PCP have been living like
parasites on the IBM world.  IBMers have had the technology, and the patience
to get PCP codes much longer than Apple users ever thought of the idea.  A
HACKER THAT HACKS THEM OUT FOR YOU?  Gee whiz boz, what a thought there.  Well,
I decided enough was enough.  I mean, sure I can hack on Sprint, Mid-America,
ITT or whatever.  But I can sure get busted too.  Yeah, yeah, Extender Bender
will help me cover myself, and lessen the chance of getting caught, but the
danger STILL exists of getting caught every second you USE THE CODE!  So, I
designed a PCP hacker for the Apple // series.  Fully capable of changing with
the (seemingly constant changing) new PCP formats.  It's got it all.  (And
for only $19.99!  That's right, the TI-99, the COMMODORE-64, the...).

        Seriously.

        This is the second file release in the "HAYES HACAMATIC ][: THE
NEXT GENERATION" series production.  This program is compatable with
Novation Apple Cats, Hayes Smartmodems, "OTHER"s, and the Multimodem 224.

EXTENDER BENDER 1.0 -- RELEASED <get version 2.0 if you own this>
                2.0 -- RELEASED AND AVAILABLE AT A BBS NEAR YOU
                3.0 -- SOON TO BE RELEASED

CREDIT CARD NUMBER GENERATOR 1.0 -- RELEASED <get version 2.0 if you own this>
                             2.0 -- RELEASED

II.  Documentation

BOOT UP

Stick the disk in the drive.  Flip the power switch into the "ON" postion.

DATE

If you don't have a clock, you will be asked for the date.  Enter it in the
following fomrat:  mm/dd/yy (mm=month, dd=day, yy=year).

If the date shown on the screen is already correct, you need not enter it
again.  Just press return.

The program automatically saves the date to disk so you need not type it in
next time.

CONFIGURATION

If it is the first time you have booted, you will need to configure.  You
will be asked several questions, and they will be saved to the disk, so
you need not enter them again.

MODEM TYPE

[1] Novation Apple Cat
[2] Hayes Smartmodem
[3] Other

Enter the correct modem type by pressing the number indicating it on the left
hand side of the correct modem type.

GS USERS ONLY:  GS users many need to change DCD and DTR settings on their
                modems to provide for true carrier detect ability and support
                (as opposed to ignore).  DCD and DTR handshakes should also be
                set in the control panel to 'NO'.

GS USERS ONLY:  USE GS MODEM PORT?

If your modem is in the gs modem port, not in a slot, select this option.

SLOT OF MODEM

Simply enter which slot your modem is in.  If you own an Apple //c, it is slot
2.

SLOT OF PRINTER

Enter the slot your printer is in.  If you don't have one, simply press '0'.
On the Apple //c, the slot is slot 1.

Then the program will save your setup, and continue on.

USING THIS PROGRAM ON A HARD DRIVE OR UNIDISK

There is no need to specify a prefix within the Pcp Hacker.  All you must do
is copy ALL the files and ALL the DIRECTORIES to your 3.5" disk or Hard Drive.
Then make a program that does PREFIX /your.directory/ and then runs STARTUP.

Example:  You copy ALL the files to /hard.drive/pcp.hacker/

You then make a program called /hard.drive/pcp.run

]NEW
]10 D$ = CHR$(4)
]20 PRINT D$"PREFIX/HARD.DRIVE/PCP.HACKER/"
]30 PRINT D$"-STARTUP"
]SAVE /HARD.DRIVE/PCP.RUN

and then you just "RUN PCP.RUN" anytime you want to use the PCP hacker.

TITLE PAGE

The title page will be shown on the screen.  Press any key to continue once you
have viewed it.

MAIN MENU

From the main menu you have six options.  View good codes.  Delete good codes.
Start hacking.  View these docs.  Reconfigure.  And a hidden option, the
credit screen.

VIEW GOOD CODES

First you must enter the correct prefix.  Use the correct ProDOS format.
Example: /proterm/pcp.codes

At the input prompt, where you are asked to enter the prefix, press 'esc'ape
to return to the main menu.

This allows you to view a list of saved PCP codes you have, and if you wish,
print the list out.

Use the arrow keys, and when the file you want is higlighted, press return.

DELETE GOOD CODES

First enter the correct prefix.  Use the correct ProDOS format.
Example: /proterm/pcp.codes

At the input prompt, where you are asked to enter the prefix, press 'esc'ape
to return to the main menu.

This allows you to delete a list of saved PCP codes you have.

Use the arrow keys, and when the file you want is higlighted, press return.

CREDIT SCREEN

Press ? to access this.  It is a simple explanation of the program and a quick
credit for me, the author of the program.  Also you may choose CREDITS.

START HACKING

<see hacking procedures, roman numeral III>

VIEW THESE DOCS

Hell, you got here, you should remember!

When it asks if you wish to print the docs out, you may press 'esc'ape to abort
to the main menu.

RECONFIGURE

This takes you back, and allows you to change your modem type, modem slot
and printer slot.

PCP SCANNER

Final addition to the program.  Scans out pcp addresses.  No documentation,
pretty simple to use.

III.  Hacking Procedures

First the program will load in Modemworks, the correct driver, and Amperworks.

Then it will run the PCP Hacker.  You must again answer a couple more
questions.

PCP NUMBER [xxx-xxxx]

Enter the number of your local PCP port in the format shown.  If you wish to
call a port that is not local.  Enter it in as 1-(xxx)-xxx-xxxx (you'll overun
the brackets - but that doesn't matter).

STATE AND CITY DESTINATION

This is the abbreviation of the state and city put together you use to connect.
You can get a list of these from your local PCP port by entering at the @
prompt, C  PURSUIT  - at username and password type guest - then go to the
main menu, then go to the downloads.  Look through the downloads, and you
should stumble accross a list.  Some popular examples:  MNMIN, CALAN, NJNEW,
TXDAL, TXHOU, etc.  It's usually best to pick a less popular state - for
sometimes the PCP ports can get congested and that would ruin your hacking
efforts because an error message would be sent back, and the program would
be unable to connect.

SPECIFIED PCP FORMAT

This next question will allow you to choose whether you wish to hack with
a specified pcp format (this is very selective, and allows by far the best
accuracy when hacking) or what I call the controlled chaos format.  The
controlled chaos format basically allows the user to add a suffix and prefix
to the id and password, and it allows you to control the length of the id
and password, by allowing you to set limits for randomizing the lengths.

Comparision between formats:

CONTROLLED CHAOS                              SPECIFIED PCP FORMAT

Will allow the randomization of length of     One specified length.
the password and id.

Will allow a suffix and prefix to be added    Allows the pinpointing of exactly
to both the password and id.                  what should be a number, letter,
                                              copying of other characters,
                                              selection from a preassigned
                                              list format, and an unkown mark.

SPECIFIED PCP FORMAT

If you choose the specified pcp format option, a row of numbers will appear.

0000000001111 etc.
1234567890123
           x

The numbers are to be read from top to bottom.  Example:  See where the x
is?  Notice it is under a 2.  And notice above the two is a 1.  So reading
it from top to bottom you get 12.  The x is in space 12.  This will be used
later with the copy function.

ENTERING THE FORMAT

You can use any of the following commands.

CONTROL-L or }    = Limited Set.
CONTROL-C or {    = Copy.
?                 = Unknown.
#                 = Number.
$                 = Letter.
,                 = Seperation of Id and Password.
any # or letter   = Preassigned Specified Characters.

CONTROL-L or } (LIMITED SET)

This basically allows a random choice from a list that you enter.  Let's say
you know the first character is always either an A a 6 or a Z.  The first
thing you would press is CONTROL-L or }.  Down the screen the following
will appear:  [Set]: at this you would enter the set.  A;6;Z - making sure
to seperate each character with a SEMI-COLON.  (;).  Example

000000 etc.
123456
}

[Set]: A;6;Z

Now you will be returned to space 02.  Now when hacking, the first characters
will either be an A a 6 or a Z, depending on how the randomization turns out.

Example:  C  D/MNMIN/12,A  < that first character will either be an A, a 6 or
                             a Z.

NOTE!  You can only have one character inbetween the seperating markers.  In
       other words, you can't have "16;20;30" because they would each take
       up too many spaces, and these are only good for ONE space.

CHANGING THE RANDOM PROBABILTIES IN A LIMITED SET

The way the set command works is, let's say you entered [Set]: A;6;Z - okay,
so then you finish entering everything, and the program calls up Pcp and
starts a nice little hacking job.  It goes through, printing the characters
to the screen, then it comes to the set command.  It says "Hmmm, I see there
are three characters that aren't semi-colons in that set.  So, I'll pick a
random number 1-3.  Then I'll compare it to the set to come up with a number.
Okay, here goes.  **** 3   - so we'll use the Z".  - get it?  Pretty simple.

What you can do to offset the outcome some, is enter more of the desired
character.  Let's say you know the second character of the id is either a
0 or a 1.  You also know the 0 is used more frequently.  You would go like
this:  [Set]: 0;0;0;1  or [Set]: 0;0;1 or [Set]: 0;0;0;0;1 - or however
much you want to offset the balace.  In the first set [0;0;0;1] there would
be a 3 in 4 chance the 0 would be picked, and a 1 in 4 chance the 1 would
get picked.  So in the [0;0;1] set, there would be a 2 in 3 chance the 0 would
get picked, and a 1 in 3 chance the 1 would get picked.  It is very simple.

CONTROL-C or { (COPY)

This fuction allows you to duplicate another character.  Here's an example.

00000000 etc.
12345678
#$#$#$#  

As later you will learn, # picks a random number, $ a random letter.  So,
let's say you know the pcp format is number,letter,number,letter,number,letter,
number, and then the next character (the 08 character) is the same as the first
character (01).  So let's say a 9 comes up in 01, then a 9 should be in 08.
So all you do is go to 08 and hit { or CONTROL-C.

00000000011
12345678901
#$#$#$#{


[Copy]:

Now, at the [Copy]: prompt, you should enter the space you wish to copy.
Since you want the (08) space to be the same as the (01) space, you should
enter 01, or just 1.

[Copy]: 1

Now, when the program hacks the 08 space will be the same as the 01 space.

                        00000000
                        12345678

Example:  C  D/MNMIN/12,9Z2C4Z79

Notice the 08 space and 01 space are the same.

(Note, when copying, you must use a number BEFORE the number you are copying.
 In other words you CAN COPY 01 if you were at 08, but you CAN'T COPY 13.
 If you wanted 08 and 13 to be the same, you would put the correct sign at
 08 (like are 08 and 13 always numbers? then put a #, or letters? put a $)
 and then when you get to 13 you would do a COPY and then [Copy]: 08.)

? (UNKNOWN)

The unknown marker is basically for if you don't know if it's a letter or
a number.  Example:

00000
12345
#$#$?

Number, letter, number, letter, then either a number or a letter.

# (NUMBER)

You would use this to signify a number in the format.

For example, if you knew the format was always number, letter, number,
you would put #$# (the # represents a number).

$ (LETTER)

You would use this to signify  letter in the format.

For example, if you knew the format was always number, letter, number,
you would put #$# (the $ represents a letter).

, (Seperating the id and password)

As you know, when you enter the id and password when connect to pcp, you
enter the id,password.  Example:  PLL000000L,L0000L - Notice the comma
seperates the id and password.  Well, when entering the format, you will
use the comma to seperate the id and password also.  Example:
#$#$#$#,$#$#$#  would mean the id consists of number, letter, number, letter,
number, letter, number and the password consists of letter, number, letter,
number, letter, number.

PREASSIGNED SPECIFIED CHARACTERS

You would use this if you knew a character was ALWAYS THE SAME.

Example:  Let's say you knew the format ALWAYS STARTED WITH PCP then had
a number.  You would go:  PCP#  - not too hard.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

Let's pretend (boys and girls) that after studying 80 old Pcp id's, you
suddenly discovered a pattern.  The pattern goes like this:

The id always starts with the letters PLL.  The next character is either a
0 or a 1 followed by three numbers, a L and then two more numbers.

The password starts with a letter, followed by a number, then a 3, followed
by two more numbers, and then the last character is always the same as the
first in the password.

00000000011111111
12345678901234567

PLL}###L##,$#3##{

That is what you would enter (PLL}###L##,$#3##{).

Here's why:

The id always starts with PLL, so you simply type PLL.

Then next character is either a 0 or a 1, so you would use the LIMITED SET
command.  You would hit CONTROL-L (or the } character) and at the
[Set]: prompt, you would enter 0 and 1 like this: [Set]: 0;1

NOTE!  YOU MUST REMEMBER TO USE A SEMI-COLON (;) TO SEPERATE THE ITEMS.

IF EXTRA IGNORED? APPEARS - THAT MEANS YOU FORGOT, AND EITHER USED A COMMA
OR A COLON (:) TO SEPERATE THE ITEMS WHICH IS A * NO-NO *.

The next three characters are numbers.  So you enter a # for each of them.

Then there is always a L, so you press L.

Then there are always two more numbers, so press a # for each of them.

The password starts with a letter, so enter $.

The next character is always a number, so enter #.

The next character is always a 3, so enter a 3.

The next two characters are always numbers, so enter a # for each.

The last character is always the same as the first in the password.  So you
would use the { or CONTROL-C, the copy command.  At the [Copy]: prompt you
would enter 12, since you want the character to be the same as the 12th
character.  (Haha!  Lost?  Did the example roll off into the twilight zone?
Should have printed the docs out!).  (Hmm, where have I heard that before?).

CONTROLLED CHAOS FORMAT

This applys only if you chose not to use the specified pcp format option.

PCP ID TO USE OR RETURN

If you want to hack a specific PCP Id you, lets say, accidently saw after
accidently reading someone's email or something, at this point you would
enter the id (like if you only found the id, and not the password).
EXAMPLE:  PLL000000L or PCP1234LLL

If you don't have a specific ID you want to hack, simply press return.

PCP PASSWORD TO USE OR RETURN

Similar to the PCP ID TO USE input, except in this case, lets say you
stumbled accross a PCP password, but not the ID, then you enter the
password at this prompt.

If you don't wish to hack a specific password, press return.

           RANGE OF NUMBER OF DIGITS NOT INCLUDING PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES

           Lets say you know that the ID's always have 8 digits, and the
           passwords always have between 3 and 6 digits.  But the ID'S
           always begin with PCP.  Here is how you would enter that.

           NUMBER OF DIGITS IN PCP ID

           From  [5]  (since you don't include the PCP, since that is a
                       prefix - it's always the same).
           To    [5]  (There are only 5 random digits in the ID, so you
                       type the same number in the TO box that is in
                       the FROM box).

           NUMBER OF DIGITS IN PCP PASSWORD

           From [3]
           To   [6]   - not too tough.

           TOTAL NUMBER OF CHARACTERS

           Let's say you only know that the passwords have at least 6 digits,
           and that there are always a total of 16 digits if you add both
           the digits of the password and id together.  Here's how you would
           enter that.

           NUMBER OF DIGITS IN PCP ID

           From [1]   > Remember, you know at least 6 digits are in the
           To   [10]  > password, so that means there is always anwhere between
                        one and 10 digits (16-6=10) in the ID.

           NUMBER OF DIGITS IN PCP PASSWORD

           From [1]
           To   [6]

           TOTAL NUMBERS OF CHARACTERS IN BOTH THE ID AND PASSWORD

           [16]

           Not *too hard.

           Now, it will ask you if you wish to add a prefix to the ID.
           See up before, in the first example where we said that all the
           ID's began in PCP (what, did that scroll off into the twilight
           zone you say?  * you should have printed this sucker out!)
           (Hmmm? Where did I hear that before?) well, this is where that
           comes in.  When it asks if you want a prefix to the ID, you
           enter "PCP" - (prefixes come before, suffixes are attached to
           the end).  When it asks if you want a suffix, if we were using
           the above example, we would hit RETURN.  We would hit return
           when it asks if we wanted a prefix or suffix for the password
           too, since there was none.  But lets say you think all codes
           end with the letter Z.  You would enter Z instead of return
           when it asked you SUFFIX FOR THE PASSWORD?

DOCUMENTATION THAT APPLYS FOR BOTH FORMATS

Okay, back to the documentation that applys to both formats.

BAUD RATE

Use the arrow keys, and when you have your selection highlighted, press return.

Remember, you can only use 2400 baud in pcp ports that are made for 2400 baud.
NOT ALL PORTS WILL WORK WITH 2400 baud.  Sorry, modemworks doesn't support
4800 or 9600, so therefore this program cannot.

SPEAKER ON/OFF

This will either turn the speaker on or off when it dials the PCP port.

NUMBER OF CODES TO FIND

This allows you to set how many codes to be found before the program shuts
down.

NUMBER OF TRIES

This allows you to set, lets say 100 tries, and after the program attempts
100 tries, it will automatically turn itself off.

OUTPUT OF VALID CODES

You can either select PRINTER, DISK or BOTH.

PRINTER

Prints a found code onto the printer, using the printer slot given when you
configured.

DISK

Appends the code onto a file.  If you choose this you must choose the prefix
and filename to store the file at.  Use the correct prodos format.  Example:
/PROTERM/PCP.CODES  - the program will print the code and the date.

BOTH

Puts it to both the PRINTER and DISK.

Press a key to start or escape to abort.  Your final desicion.  Go for it, or
not?

While it hacks...  PRESS CONTROL RESET for an instant abort.  This is the
only way the modem will shut off immediately.

OTHER

How do you know you have the wrong driver?  The program will say "Beginning
Hack Procedure..." and freeze up on you.  I personally use the "OTHER"
driver with my //c, Apple Modem 1200.  (Fully hayes compatable).

At the top of the screen, across from my credit line, it says FOUND:
there it will print how many codes have been found.

How the program works - the program enters a code in the correct format.
Then it searches for the @ prompt.  IF it finds the @ prompt, it assumes
it is a bad code.  If it does not get the @ prompt, it will continue and
wait for the prompt for 60 seconds, and if the prompt is still not given,
assume that it is a good code.

This is based on how Pcp works.

Example run:

@C  D/MNMIN/12,PLL000000L,L0000L
INVALID ID OR BAD PASSWORD

here the program will wait for the @ prompt, and get it, so it will continue
to hack.

@C  D/MNMIN/12,PLL000001L,L0000L

CONNECTED /MNMIN/

here, the program will wait 60 seconds, and since no @ prompt appears, it
will assume it is a good code, and same the code.

IV. HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM (AND WHEN)

No one I've ever heard of has gotten busted using PCP.  So, let it hack all
night.  Set it up at about 8pm, and go away, do whatever.  And let it hack
until 8pm or 10pm the next morning.  Remember, the only drawback to hacking
PCP accounts is ---- THEY TAKE A LONG TIME TO GET!!  Basic estimates into
how much time it does take was given to me by an IBM user as one day per
code.

V. CREDITS
