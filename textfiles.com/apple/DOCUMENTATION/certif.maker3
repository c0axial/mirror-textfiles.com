Below  is  a  list  of  all  the template numbers and what they contain.
These templates are also grouped  into  categories  which  I  have  also
listed below

                       S P E C I A L K E Y S

*  A  template number with one asterisk before the number means that the
certificate has no title on it at all. In other words it  probably  just
has  a picture in the upper right hand corner with blank lines on it for
you to fill in with whatever info you want  to.  Template  #  92  is  an
example of this. 

! A template number with an exclamation point in front of it means it is
in the SMALL FORMAT. 

$  A template with a dollar sign in front of it means the template is in
the HORIZONTAL FORMAT. 

All other templates are in the VERTICAL FORMAT! 

Do not use these special keys in the program itself when it asks you  to
ENTER  THE TEMPLATE NUMBER! Just use the number itself. The special keys
are just for your own reference.
