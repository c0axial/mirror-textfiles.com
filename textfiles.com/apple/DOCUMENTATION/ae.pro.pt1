AE PRO is part of the "Professional Series" pioneered by Southwestern Data
System (SDS).  For the first time ever, there is communications software
which operates similarly in all three major operating systems of the Apple
II computer; CP/M,Pascal, and the native Apple DOS.  The comprehensive set
of software is conversive with each of its members -- CP/M files can be 
transferred via modem or direct connect interface to Pascal, Pascal to DOS
or any combination.

-=+*> BAUD RATES <*+=-
AE PRO supports all standard telecommunications baud rates as well as the
higher direct connect rates up to at least 4800 baud when interfaced to
conventional 80 column boards, or in excess of 9600 baud when interfaced to
an external terminal capable of those higher rates.  Its supports full
terminal emulation -the ability of AE PRO and your 80 column board or
external terminal to mimic screen display characteristics of other popular
terminals.  Thus you can communicate with host computers which may require
a particular display characteristic.  This provides maximum flexibility
while minimizing connect time.

-=+*> HARDWARE <*+=-
AE PRO also supports all currently available hardware for the Apple II
including all modems, whether plugged into the Apple mother-board or
operating externally, all display devices from the internal Apple 40 column
screen to 80 column boards and external terminals compatible interfaced.
The same versatility applies to printer interfaces as well.  With most
printer interface cards, AE PRO's unique printer "ring" buffer prevents the
loss of data while on-line with the printer enables simultaneously.

-=+*> COMPACT CODE <*+=-
AE PRO is written in very compact efficient form. Code overlays are used
frequently which allow different sections of AE PRO's code to share the
same section of memory.  The result is a very large data buffer without
wasting space anywhere in memory.  Micro PRO's Wordstar word processor and
Microsoft's A.L.D.S. assembler-linker package were used exclusively for its
development.

-=+*> POWERFUL EDITOR <*+=-
AE PRO contains a powerful built-in editing system.  The editor can utilize
either the same memory as AE's data buffer, or a special expanded buffer.
In the expanded mode, your already large 18k byte data buffer is expanded
further by another 7.5k.  You can switch between buffers quickly & easily,
but may not maintain data in both simultaneously.  The Editor is line
oriented in nature, but utilizes a flexible screen-oriented editing system
in which the cursor may be freely moved around in text.  Characters may be
added or deleted at will.  Also featured are recursive global find and edit
commands, which allow you to locate particular characters or strings
anywhere in your file, instantly move into the edit mode,make necessary
changes, and continue on to find the next find occurrence.

-=+*> BUILT-IN MEMORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM <*+=-
AE PRO goes one step further.  If your Apple II is equipped with a standard
16k or greater ram card in slot zero, AE will automatically relocate the
DOS operating system to higher memory and increase your data buffer size
even further.  In this mode of operation, your minimum buffer size will
increase from 18k bytes to approx. 28k bytes.  In the expanded editor mode,
another 7.5k bytes is added above that.

-=+*> MOST POWERFUL MACRO SYSTEM EVER <*+=-
AE PRO provides you with the ultimate in flexibility.  Complete system
parameter assignment as part of the normal macro library.  Now not only do
you have full macro libraries with which to make complex operations easier,
each separate library can completely reconfigure AE PRO.  Things such as
the system phone number, baud rate, parity, various menu parameters, even
terminal emulation tables are part of this powerful system.
Once configured, all you need to do is tell AE PRO which system to call.
It will call,connect,reconfigure itself, and complete the log-on
automatically while you sit back and watch.

-=+*> UNATTENDED AUTO-ANSWER <*+=-
AE PRO allows completely unattended answer mode with password log-on.  If
the Novation Apple CAT modem is utilized with the Bell 21a option, AE PRO
will auto-search baud rates and adjust to that of the caller automatically.
In the unattended mode, the caller can view standard text files to the
screen, do blind copy of data, or send or receive any type of file in the
Christensen error-free mode.  The unattended mode can be set up for
complete turnkey operation too.  If configured to so, you can power-up your
computer on the AE disk and automatically enter the unattended remote mode.

-=+*> AUTO-ANSWERBACK MODE <*+=-
AE PRO also have the ability to function as an ANSWERBACK DDD or TWX mode
to forwarding mail systems such as Telenet's Telemail and many others.
In this mode, AE PRO will pick up the phone, and wait for the forwarding
system to activate it with special HERE-IS character.  AE PRO will then
identify itself, and accept the incoming data into its buffer.  At the
conclusion of the exchange, the forwarding computer will hangup, and AE PRO
will automatically save its buffer to disk (the printer may be
simultaneously supported also) and wait for the next call.

-=+*> ERROR FREE TRANSFERS <*+=-
A wide range of send modes are provided.  Everything from the simplest
blind block dump, to a very complex packet-oriented error checking mode
ensures that you'll be able to quickly and easily transfer all sorts of
data to practically any host computer you can find.  Even the slowest or
most awkward systems are easily accommodated.

-=+*> MENU DRIVEN <*+=-
AE PRO is unobtrusive.  It remains quietly on the sidelines until you
request something.  It can display extensive help menus if you want them,
or none if you don't.  An extra feature, the BRIEF mode allows the more
experienced operator to turn off AE PRO's extra prompting.  This keeps the
screen clear of announcements and prompting you may not always need.

-=+*> SOPHISTICATED INSTALL PROGRAM <*+=-
AE PRO's install program is very user friendly and easy to use.
It requires no programming knowledge to operate but encompasses all aspect
of the basic set-up of AE PRO including various automatic modes which allow
you to move AE PRO from one system to another of different hardware
configuration.  It will figure out what is there and work correctly without
further attention.  There are no line numbers to change or internal
programming changes to make.  If AE PRO cannot adjust for a particular
hardware incompatibility, it will inform you and automatically run the
INSTALL program if present on that drive.

-=+*> MANUAL ABBREVIATIONS: <*+=-
Throughout this manual,
certain abbreviations for keys or characters may be used:

c/r   carriage return key
BS    backspace character (^H)
RUB   RUBout character
ESC   ESCape character
 ^    Control character
 ^#   RUBout character (screen display only)
<c/r> execute c/r
Also note that a HEX value may be indicated by a numbe being
preceded by a dollar sign ($) or followed by "H" (letter H)

-=+*> AE PRO DISKETTE CONTENTS <*+=-

                 All "S" files are macro data files.

B    CHFORM      A utility program which changes the FORMAT or a DOS text
                 file to that of Pascal or CP/M, or vice versa.  Use this
                 when you transfer files in protocal mode with AE PRO and
                 one of the other "PRO" series packages, P-TERM
                 (Pascal 1.1) or Z-TERM (CP/M).

B    BFD92       A utility program designed to produce a TEXT FILE FROM A
                 Binary block of data, if that data does NOT reside from
                 $9200-$9600.

NOTE:
AE PRO itself does not rely on any non-macro files to operate normally.
Therefore, you can produce diskettes which contain on HELLO, AE and
associated macro files, to allow you the largest possible disk space.
If you also would like to be able to operate INSTALL from AE PRO,
you must include INSTALL and BDOS on the AE disk.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-=+*> A TYPICAL QUICKIE SET-UP <*+=-

For our example, we'll take a pretty "standard" hardware configuration
found in many reasonably equipped Apple II's used in the home.
It would consist of:
                    1  Apple II Plus, 48k RAM
                    1  16k RAM card - any manufacture
                    2  Apple mini-drives on one controller card
                    1  80 Column board (optional)
                    1  Hayes Associates MicroModem II
                    1  Epson MX70/80/FT Printer
                    1  Parallel Printer Interface

First, like running any other new software, MAKE A COPY OF AE PRO DISKETTE.
Any conventional copy program may be used. When done, put the master aside,
and "use the copy".  Insert the AE PRO copy disk in you boot drive, and
either power up the computer or type PR#6 to initiate the boot process.
After a few seconds of disk activity, AE PRO will attempt to run and
discover it has not yet been installed.  It will display a message on the
40 column screen.

The first install--RUNNING  INSTALL

Another few seconds will pass the screen will again clear and you will see:
                    ASCII EXPRESS  "THE PROFESSIONAL"
                          INSTALLATION PROGRAM
                          FOR AE VERSION 3.4x
                             (C) 1982 BY
                        SOUTHWESTERN DATA SYSTEMS
                    CAN YOU DISPLAY LOWER CASE? (Y/N)

If you can ON THE DEVICE THAT WILL BE USED WITH AE PRO, answer YES.
If you cannot under any circumstance, display lower case, answer NO.

Then it will ask: CAN YOU DISPLAY IS NOW? (Y/N)

If you can, at the moment, display lower case on your 40 column screen,
answer yes.  This question only affects the display of Install's menus.

Since you are running AE PRO for the first time, the screen will again
clear and you will see the next display stage:
(This level also accessed by option I of install's main menu)

YOU MUST SELECT ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

1 Novation Apple CAT
2 Hayes Assoc. Micromodem II
3 CCS 7710A/D, 7711, SSM AIO, Apple Comm-Card, Prometheus VersaCard
4 Mountain Computer CPS
5 ESI Lynx
6 MPC MicroConnection
7 Apple Super Serial Card

Current: 0         New: ---

Since for this example, you have a MicroModem II installed, select option 2

Next: SLOT of communications device (0-7)

      Current: 2         New: ---

Enter the slot in which you modem is installed.
The message: Installing Communications Driver!

Will appear indicating you choice is valid and the proper code has been
installed.  If you had given invalid answers to the previous questions,
Install would inform you and allow you to try again.  AE PRO configures
itself automatically for various display devices, as well as most printer
interfaces, so for this installation, all that remains is to tell AE PRO
which slot the printer interface (if present) resides, and which slot the
display board (if present) resides.
No other hardware adjustments need be made.

The printer slot may be set with the "P" option and the display slot with
the "L" option. Most other user parameters have already been set for you
and need not be changed at this stage.

Look at the various options of Install and their descriptions in the
instructions.  You need not make any further changes now, but make a note
of any changes you might want to make in the future after you understand
this program better.

When your through looking around, use the "S" command at Install's main
menu to save the changes you have made and run the program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE FIRST RUN:

As AE PRO is running, it configures itself for the various hardware you
have installed in your computer.  It should always come up onto the
selected display device with:

                            ASCII EXPRESS "The Professional"
                               Version 3.4x (c) 1982 by
                               Southwestern Data System

"->"

The "->" is the system prompt as long as you are NOT currently connected to
a host computer.  At this point you can type "?" or "1" to display command
menu #1 or "2" to display command menu #2.

DIALING A NUMBER:
You type "D" to dial a number.  AE PRO responds: Number?

You enter the phone number of the system you wish to call and hit return.
If you change your mind, just enter a c/r (carriage return) alone to abort
this command.

AE PRO has the number now and displays:  AE: Dialing: 853-1212

The numbers are output to the screen as they are dialed.  When dialing is
completed, it reports:  AE: Waiting for connect..
and "listens" for the host computer's carrier.  If no carrier is detected
within about 40 seconds, the message: AE: Connection terminated
-> will overprint the previous message, display the "->" prompt and wait
for further instructions. If carrier was detected, a different course of
events occurs.  First the screen will clear, and the message: AE: Term-->
will appear in the upper left hand corner of the screen.  You are not in
terminal mode.  Anything you type now, will be directed to the computer you
called. Any time you wish, you can temporarily exit the terminal mode with
the ^Q key (control-Q).  AE PRO will respond with: +> This is the TERMINAL
ESCAPE key. At this prompt you can issue most AE PRO Commands. For Example:
If you wish to record a session, you would type "^QR" and the message:

AE: Copy ON
AE: Term-->

will display.  To turn the copy buffer OFF, just type "R" again, or "^QR"
from terminal mode if you are connected.  For now, you have the copy flag
enabled, but are not currently connected.  Call the same computer again,
but since AE PRO remember's previous commands, type "D" to invoke the dial
mode.  Instead of re-entering the number, enter the "/" character.
"/" recall the last input used for most commands that require a more than
one character response.

AE will again dial the previously specified number and attempt to connect.
Once carrier is established, sign on to the system as you did before.
Remember that now we are copying all data on your screen to the copy buffer
Wait for the host computer (the one you called) to ask you a question
(a time when it is not sending anything) and type "^QF".  AE will display
something like: AE: Used-456, Free- 17009
                AE: Term-->
this means you have 456 characters in the copy buffer, and 17,009 unused.
Remember, you are back in terminal mode at this point.
Now type "^QV".  What happened.  You just saw a repeat of everything you
just did in signing on to that computer.  This was the "V" view buffer
command.  At any time, you can view the contents of your buffer.
To clear the current buffer at any time, type "^QC". AE PRO will respond:

Ok to clear? (def=n)
to make sure you really want to do this.
Answer "Y" if you do, or any other response if you don't.
Experiment with some of the other basic commands such as "^QW" to write the
current buffer to disk or "^QI" to catalog the current disk.  Remember that
most any of the commands can be executed while on or off line and AE PRO
will always keep you informed of your connect status and various other
parameters.

If at any time you want a complete summary of current system parameters,
type "!" or "^Q!" from the terminal mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT ARE MACROS?:

Now that you have been able to connect to a system and operate the dial
option, the copy buffer and possible the printer,we'll take a brief look
at another powerful section of AE PRO-Macros!

By definition, and AE PRO macro is a two key sequence that represents a
whole string of characters.  The first of the two keys always begins with
the TERMINAL PREFIX CHARACTER defined in INSTALL (the shipped default is ^W.

When the terminal prefix character is typed, a special mode is set within
AE PRO which performs an analysis of the NEXT character you type.  If that
second character is not designated in the keyboard substitution table, it
will check the macro table. If it finds no match in the macro table either,
the character you typed will be sent out to the host as-is.

Macros are numbered form 0 to ";" in this order: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,:,;

If you were to type "^W0" from terminal mode, the string in the zeroth
element of the currently loaded macro, would be sent to the host computer.
It can consist of any data and is programmed by you in the "U" section of
the program.

MACRO STRUCTURE FUNDAMENTALS:
AE PRO's macro system is quite versatile and allows you to define a whole
set of basic parameters for each host computer you intend to communicate
with.  There are four basic pieces to the macro system structure:

1. THE MACRO LIBRARY FILE:

The library file which indexes all other macro files is "MACRO.LIB".
Its sole purpose is to keep track of the other macro related data on disk,
and provide quick access to it for loading or display purposes.  It is this
file's contents that are displayed when the "M/" command is issued.

2. THE MACRO DATA FILE:

The macro data file is that which contains all data pertaining to
configuration, emulation and the actual macro elements themselves.  You can
create a separate data file for each host computer you intend to deal with,
and each of these data files can be configured, saved or loaded from within
AE PRO.  These are "S" type files on the disk and the file-name always ends
with ".MAC".

3. THE MACRO DATA:
This is the part of the data file which actually performs the configuration changes to AE PRO when that respective macro is selected.

4. THE MACRO ELEMENTS:

This is the part of the data file which contains the actual sequences
unique to each dual keypress, index numbered "0" to ";".   Any one of these
may be called from the terminal mode keyboard by the ^W prefix character.
Additionally, one of the elements may be selected to be executed auto-
matically when the host it repres%nts is called.

MAKING A SIMPLE MACRO:
Let's take one of the macro files on the AE PRO disk and use it as an
example and a basis to start from in creating your own macro.  You should
still be sitting at the "->" command prompt. At this point you can type:

"M" to select a macro request
"/" to view the contents of the library file

Your display should look something like this:

A  PMS Santee  stpms
D  Source      source
E  Online      online
I  MicroNet    mnet
J  Smartmodem  hayes

Basically this is giving you a library list of the various macro files you
have to choose from.  Of course, this can be customized to suit your
individual needs.
If you were now to type "M" "A" you would be directing AE PRO to load the
file for PMS Santee which on the diskette is an "S" file names "STPMS.MAC".
The second field displayed is the system which the first field selection
represents, and the third field is the name of the macro data file which
will be loaded at that time.

AE PRO should respond: PMS Santee <macro loaded>
                       ->

DISPLAYING MACRO PARAMETERS:
Now let's check out what we actually loaded.  Type the "U" command (this is
displayed on menu 2) to enter the macro configuration section.  You'll see
a complete display of the data parameters of that file:

Current loaded: STPMS.MAC
         Phone: 561-7277!:
B = Baud rate                300
D = Macros display/edit
E = Duplex                   FULL
F = Data word format         8N1
K = Chat mode                OFF
L = Load macro from disk
N = XON character         $11=^Q
O = XOFF character        $13=^S
P = Change macro phone #
S = Set terminal parameters
T = Transpose ^H/RUB         OFF
U = Update from current macro
W = Write macro to disk
X = Exit to main command prompt
Z = Format screen            OFF
$ = Emulation mode           ON
^ = Apple CAT port           INT

We won't get thru all this now, but rather step through a basic macro
set-up to get you going in the right directions.  First pick a system that
you can call so you have a "target" for this macro fill.  We'll consider it
a bulletin board for simplicity, but the same procedure would apply to any
set-up.  Update the phone number displayed to that of the system you are
creating this macro for.  Do this with the "P" command.

AE PRO will respond:
Enter new number:

Enter the phone number of the new system followed by c/r.  For the purpose
of demo, we'll call it "BBS Yourtown".  After the number is correctly
entered, the menu will re-display and the number just entered should be in
place.  Change any other obvious parameters dealing with that system, such
as baud rate or parity in a similar manner.  Once you are done with the
parameters section, enter the "D" command to enter the actual macro element
editing section.

EDITING MACRO STRINGS:

AE PRO will display:

#0 g;n
#1 yourid
#2 yourpassword
#3 alt'%)y'
#4
#5
#6
#7
#8
#9
#: <a programmed macro>
#; <a programmed macro>

P=PRINTER INTERFACE/DRIVER SELECT:

Previous: Main Install
Menu Current: PRINTER SETUP

A = Printer msg.terminator.....^@ ($00)
I = Install printer driver
L = Line feed strip (Y/N)..... NO
P = Message:
S = Printer interface slot.....1
X = Exit        Choice?

This section defines all aspects of standard printer operation.

A=Printer message terminator:
This defines the key used in Install which signals the end of the Printer
message string (see "M" below) when being entered into computer.  Since
carriage returns (^M) are sometimes needed within set-up strings, it must
be typeable as part of the string.  By setting string keyboard terminator
to something else (like,control-shift-P or ^@"null") the c/r may be typed
just as any other character.  If you have no need for imbedded c/r's, you
may assign it as the terminator.  Your keyboard must be able to produce any
characters entered in this,or any other string entry mode.

I=Install printer driver:

Previous: Printer set-up
Current: PRINTER INTERFACE TYPE

0 = Auto
1 = User routines (PRINTER.USER)
2 = 6522 parallel card
3 = Comm-card
4 = Apple serial card
5 = Apple parallel card
6 = Special
7 = CPS
8 = CCS-7728 parallel card

Current 0       New:

Choices are somewhat similar to video display options.  If zero is selected
and as long as AE PRO can,it will recognize the interface card installed &
configure automatically.
ALWAYS SELECT ZERO OPTION UNLESS YOU HAVE SPECIFIC REASON NOT TO!!
Like video, if you do not desire the auto function,or have a card not
recognized by AE PRO select one of the below.

1 = User routines is a custom section,you may install a custom driver.
2 = An interface using the 6522 chips
3 = Comm-type card in any interface using the 6850 chip.
    Examples: SSM AIO board,CCS 7710 SERIES,standard Apple comm. card,
    modified as printer driver.  The firmware on these is NOT utilized.
4 = Apple HS Serial Card: Only one card that fits this - the original Apple
    High Speed Serial-some firmware IS used on these cards, but part of it
    dealing with linefeeds or protocol.
5 = Apple Parallel card- This is the most popular, as well as the most
    copied interface mode.  Most printer cards designated as parallel will
    fall into this section,including many of the universal types of EPSON
    printer,its own parallel card and many others.
6 = Special is any type card using TYPE 6 FIRMWARE protocal.
    Apple SSC BOARD,GRAPPLER & MICRO-BUFFER.
7 = CPS-- only one card in this category -MOUNTAIN COMPUTER CPS card-- may
    be used as serial or parallel driver.  If selected you will be asked as
    to the mode of drive.  Be careful here if using same CPS card for both
    modem,screen driver, as well as printer driver.  Inadvertently
    specifying the same section as two different drivers may cause unusual
    results.As screen driver, it may be used ONLY in the serial mode.
8 = CCS 7728 Parallel card or Micro-Buffer system.

L=LINEFEED STRIP:
AE PRO supplies linefeeds directly to the printer at all times.
This normal default mode is not dependent on the type of printer interface
you are using, only the printer internal drivers themselves.  If printer is
doing double-linefeeds all the time when driven by AE PRO set this to YES.
Otherwise set at NO.

M=PRINTER MESSAGE:
If your printer requires any kind of initialization characters be sent when
accessed, set them up here.These don't include sequences which are normally
designated as FIRMWARE initialization.  Things such as ^I are usually
firmware initialized are ineffective here.  Thus it is unnecessary to send
^I commands to set printer column width as that is a function of the
interface card firmware rather than the printer itself.  The message to the
printer can be entered directly from the keyboard,including all control
characters.

Current printer setup message:

Enter new message or RETURN:

(you type)     HELLO THERE ^S ^S ^[  ^[

Of course, HELLO THERE control-s control-s ESCape ESCape won't do anything
useful to your printer and is shown only as an example.  Entering c/r as
the FIRST character of the line, will immediately exit this mode and leave
the original string intact.  Note each time printer is enabled from AE PRO
these characters are sent.  If you want to clear the entire contents of the
printer set-up buffer, enter the printer terminator character as the first
and only character.

S=PRINTER INTERFACE SLOT:

0 = No printer installed
1-7= Printer interface slot

Current = 0     New:--

Set to slot in which printer interface card resides.

The terminal prefix key is very powerful.  It commands all macro functions
as well as a means of producing any ASCII character from the keyboard.
In the prefixed terminal table,you program which characters are to be
converted, and to what,when preceded by the terminal prefix key, up to 16
substitutions.

NOTE: If you are operating install pgm. totally in upper-case, or intend to
us AE PRO in upper case only, some of these characters will actually
display as their upper-case counterpart.  Thus {,|,},~, will be [,",], ^,.
This is unavoidable because Apple see some ASCII values this way.

A=Add character:
This mode allows you to add a character substitute.  Either the character
prefixed, or the character to be output, you can enter from the keyboard,
or "$xx" as the HEX value.

D=Delete character:
Just like the above "A" mode, except it deletes the
character and its substitution from the existing table.

X = Exit
Choice?

C=Ring count before answer:
Sets the number of incoming rings before AE PRO will pick up the phone.
Values are from 1-9.

R=Remote password:
This is the sequence of characters which must be entered by a called at the
"ENTRY:" level of AE PRO.  No reaction from AE will occur unless exactly
the correct combination of characters is entered.  Any alphanumeric
characters including control char. are legal except ^M, (c/r), ^H,^J.
A maximum of six char.may be installed.

S=Disk slots remotely accessible:
Only those slots specified here will be legal for remote access.
If not legal,will be ignored.

  Determines whether the "R" copy flag comes up on or off.

D=Duplex half/full:
  Determines if the duplex default comes up half or full.
  This may be superseded by a macro file,if active.

E=Emulation:
  Determines if the AE emulation mode ($) mode comes up on or off.
  This too may be changed by a macro file.

F=Data word format:
  Determines the default word length, parity and number
  of stop bits the modem will default at run-time.
  Can be changed by macro file.
  Install will show another chart which allows all possible combinations.
  Select by # or c/r's

G=Screen format default:
  Determines whether the "Z" screen format command in on or off.

H=Chat:

not all baud rates are supported by all modems and interfaces,
consult modem or interface manuals.

J=Apple CAT using Aux port:
  Set port default.  NO means the internal modem is being used.
  YES directs all I/O to external port.Macro files can also modify.

K=Keyclick:
  Set the default for the audible key-click option (").

N=XON character:
  Sets the char. which is used to re-start a sending host temporarily on
  "hold" by the auto-save mode.  Install displays the ASCII char. as well
  as its HEX value.When Install request input,you can type from the local
  keyboard or type in "$xx" Hex value.

O=XOFF character:
  Sets the char. which is used to stop a sending host while in the
  auto-save mode.Option same as above.  It also responds to chars.
  sent from the host while in ASCII mode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2=SYSTEM DEFAULTS (menu 2)

See above menu breakdown, the letters are different but the menu
construction is the same.  This is menu 2 of the default system.
Typed below are the explanations of that menu in order as to how
they are viewed on the screen:

B=Prefixed break key:
  This is the second char. of the break key sequence.  In the current
  setting, to send BREAK, you would type ^W^B from within the terminal
  mode.  ^W char. can be defined as can this, the second char.  It is
  recommended that it be a control char., as a dual control char. 
  sequence is easier to type that if the second of the two is non-control.
  ^B is easy to remember for the word break.

C=BREAK send time:
  The standard BREAK time is actually 250ms (milliseconds) but many systems
  may require a break to be sent for as long as 500ms (one half sec.).
  Try it this way first (menu setting) and redefine it necessary.

D=Dial mode default:
  Novation Apple CAT only.
  Set the dialing default mode, pulse (rotary type) or TouchTone.

E=Screen clear char.:
  Actual screen clear char... $0C ^L        Lead-in     ... $00 ^@ (none)
  Defines the char. when used internally will cause the display screen to
  clear.

Note:
This serves a different purpose that the similar function in the Terminal
emulation table.The emulation table converts incoming characters to those
required by your display.  This option,is used only by AE PRO during
internal clear screen option.  The "Actual" screen clear char. above serves
an additional function when used in the 40 col. screen mode.  In 40 col.
the defined char. determines which INCOMING char will cause 40 col. screen
to display while in terminal mode.

F=Screen clear delay:
  Some external terminals may require a small "settling" time directly
  after a clear screen before it can accurately accept further data.
  This value is equivalent to the time delay in milliseconds.

G=Backspace char.:
  This causes your display device to move the cursor one space to the
  left-non-destructively. DO NOT confuse this with the key to type on your
  keyboard.  That will ALWAYS be the BS or RUBout (left-arrow) key.  There
  are a handful of terminals that might require a char. other than ^H to
  perform this act.
  DO NOT CHANGE THIS FOR LOCAL SCREEN OR 80 COL.BOARD USAGE.

H=Copy ON char.:
  Like the "here-is" char., the copy on char. is that which when received
  in terminal mode cause AE to immediately turn on its copy buffer.  It is
  normally at ^R. To disable, enter zero.

I=Copy OFF char.:
  Corresponds to the copy on char., except that when encountered in
  terminal mode,instruct AE to turn OFF its copy buffer.
  Normally set to ^T. To disable,enter zero.

J=Literal send mode:
  This mode sets whether or not blank lines in ASCII text file are being
  sent non-protocol,are sent exactly as-is or "padded".  Padding converts
  blank lines (c/r alone) to space-c/r.  Most host computers take a blank
  line (c/r alone) as a command, so this sequence would occur during a text
  send, the host would change mode.  If the literal send mode is OFF, any
  blank line consisting of c/r would be converted to space-c/r to avoid
  being taken as a command.  This in no way modifies the appearance of the
  text.  Set to suit.  AE PRO is shipped with this mode disabled (off).

K=Keyclick duration:
  The Apple speaker will emit a "click".  The higher the value the longer
  the delay,and the louder (or more obvious) the click. The range is 1-40.

L=Pre-sub case insensitive:
  This decides if prefixed char.are to be sensitive to input case.  Example:
  you have defined ^WA to send ^A or another char.  What this option
  determines is whether the case of the letter you type after the ^W is
  significant.  If set to YES, case would be insensitive, thus a lower case
  A would be treated the same as a upper case A.  If NO,lower and upper
  case letters are regarded as different chars.

Q=Brief AE PRO:
  This selects default condition for the Brief (non-verbose mode).
  It is also managed by the "#" command in the main menu.

S=Shift key hardware mode:
  This is between the connection of your keyboard and PB2 of the game I/O
  connector that is used with 80 col. boards.  You can install this jumper
  even with 40 col. screen in use and tell AE to use the shift key for its
  case shifting.

V=View speed:
  Sets the default of all commands which display text on the screen, and is
  controlled from within by the non-shifted "<" & ">" keys.  Command
  affected are "V","J",& "L" within the editor.  Range is 0-14 with zero
  being no delay.

W=Screen formatting width:
  In the forced width of the display device when the (Z) is selected.
  Use this for 80 col. boards that can't perform their own screen wrap
  if a line exceeds its total width.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

3=SYSTEM DEFAULTS (menu 3):

See menu 1 break down.

A=Auto-dial from boot:
  This determines whether or not AE should dial in the number at run-time.
  Note the difference between this and the "D" dial after loadng a macro.
  The "D" will cause the macro to be automatically dialed after a macro is
  loaded any time EXCEPT right after boot or the first run of a session.

B=Bells after connect:
  This works only if you are in auto-redial loop with a cycle number
  ("/x" or "//").It selects the number of ^G's(bells) your Apple or
  external terminal will sound if and when you are connected to the host.
  Set from 0 to whatever you can tolerate up to 255.
  If a high number is chosen you can terminate by pressing any key.

C=Case toggle key:
  Is the key in 40 col. mode which will shift between upper and lower case.
  Lower case is the starting default.Typing this key once, shift to upper
  case for the next character only.  Twice in a row is a shift lock.  Once
  again after twice returns to lower case & etc.  The key is normally (and
  recommended) as the ESCape key.

D=Dial after loading a macro:
  This determines whether you automatically dial the host after loading the
  macro file.  If set,dialing will start immediately after a successful
  macro load.  If not set,dialing may be done only by first selecting "D"
  to dial followed by "M" to select macro.

E=Terminal escape key:
  This key, if in terminal mode, exits that mode and takes your to the
  prompt "+>".  You will remain connected to the host.

F=80 column board firmware:
  This determines whether chars. coming from your Apple keyboard are to be
  processed by the firmware in your 80 col.board.  If you do not wish to
  use the "features" some of the boards have,set this option to NO.  Since
  bypassing the 80 col. board also stops shifting capabilities AE auto-
  matically handles these according to shift mode and toggle.  Note this is
  similar to "V" described later, except "V" only affect control chars.
  typed.

J=Run from hard disk(or 8" drive)
  This has to do with AE and DOS volumes during load, save and catalog.
  If this option is set to NO, the disk volume default is zero, which
  allows exchange of disks freely without concern for volume parameters.
  If YES the vol. which AE runs from becomes the default for further load,
  save and catalog operations do not default to zero wildcard, but to the
  specified volume.  The hard disk option may also apply to 8", single,
  double density systems which vol. parameters are significant.

S=Send LINE delay:
  This default delay value of AE's "N" command,the delay after each line
  sent in the NON-prompted send mode.  Legal values are from 0 (no delay)
  to nine (maximum)

R=Block mode send rate:
  This default RATE is which char. are sent out the modem port in ALL send
  modes except C)haracter mode.  It is continuously variable during the
  actual send with the "<" & ">" keys (non-shifted).  Each time "<" key is
  pressed the speed will slow one "notch".  The reverse is true for the ">"
  key.  Range is 0 (full speed) to 7 (very very slow).

T=Terminal prefix key:
  This key serves as the prefix to special chars.and macros.
