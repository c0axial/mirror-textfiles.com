Here are the sides of Ultima V with their corresponding sizes.  Make sure you
get the correct boot disk, CtC released two versions of the first (boot) side.
The first (200 block) version had some errors in configuring the sound to work
with a mockingboard; the correct (198 block side) corrects this problem.

             Side 1           Side 2
  Disk 1  Program (198)    Dungeon (191)
  Disk 2  Britannia (151)  Underworld (162)
  Disk 3  Towne (206)      Dwelling (189)
  Disk 4  Castle (200)     Keep (204)


GETTING STARTED

Insert Disk One, the Ultima V program disk, label side up into your disk drive.
Turn on your computer and monitor. You will see the opening graphics. Press the
SPACE BAR to exit this view and bring up the main menu. Use the arrow keys and
RETURN to select an option.

The first time you play Ultima V, select "TRANSFER FROM ULTIMA IV" if you want
to use your character from that game, otherwise, select "CREATE A CHARACTER".
From this point, you should follow the on-screen instructions. Remember to use
the ESC key to acknowledge all disk swaps. After creating or transferring, you
will return to the main menu.

Next, select the "INTRODUCTION" option in the main menu before confinuing to
the main part of the game. After completing the introduction sequence, select
"JOURNEY ONWARD" to proceed to the main part of the game.

In all subsequent sessions, you may skip both the transfer/create character
step and the instructions sequence by either selecting "JOURNEY ONWARD" from
the main menu or pressing the "J" key while the disk is booting.

If you have at least 128K of memory and a Passport Systems MIDI interface,
Phasor, or a Mockingboard that you wish to use, see "MUSIC WITH ULTIMA V".


MOVEMENT

Except in dungeons or while engaged in combat, your party is represented by a
single figure. During combat, each party member is shown and allowed to act
independently. Pressing the following keys will move your party or party member
in the designated direction:

North: Up arrow     or  [  or  RETURN
South: Down arrow   or  /
West : Left arrow   or  ;
East : Right arrow  or  ' (quote)
In dungeons, the period key will turn you around.

These keys are also used to indicate direction when attacking and casting
spells.


MENUS

In a game menu, use the directional keys to move the cursor bar and highlight
your choice.

When you are satisfied with your selection, press the SPACE BAR. To leave a
menu without making a choice, press the ESC key. If you are selecting a member
of the party from the party roster, you may alternatively indicate your choice
by typing in the number of the player's position in the roster.
A arrow symbol just below a menu indicates that the list extends to include more
items in one or both directions.


COMMANDS

Here is a list of commands that are executed by pressing the designated key:

A /Attack/
Attempt to engage a person or creature in combat. Must be followed by a
direction. In combat, you can aim the weapons in any direction, at any target
within the weapon's range by using the direction keys to move the crosshair on
top of the target. Press <A> again or the SPACE BAR to fire.

B /Board/
Board a frigate, skiff, or other conveyance, or mount a horse. If you board a
ship from a skiff, the skiff will be stowed and kept ready for later use.

C /Cast/
Cast a spell. Must be followed by the first letters of the spell's syllables.
Only works when the proper reagents have already been mixed and the spellcaster
has enough Magic Points remaining. Some spells require additional information
(direction or target).

E /Enter/
Enter townes, castles, and other structures. Party members must be standing
directly on structure to enter.

F /Fire/
Fire cannons. Must be followed by a direction. Ship cannons may only fire when
the ships broadsides are facing the target.

G /Get/
Take possession of gold, food, and other items you find. Must be followed by a
direction.

H /Hole Up/
In dungeons and wilderness, hole up and camp once a day to rest, heal wounds,
and recover magical strength. In cities, hole up in an unoccupied bed to quickly
pass time. On sea, hole up to make minor repairs to your ship.

I /Ignite a Torch/
Light a torch, if you have one, to see at night or in dungeons.

J /JIMMY LOCK/
Unlock most doors and safely open chests with a skeleton key. Keys are
re-usable, but often break if the person jimmying is not nimble enough.

K /Klimb/
Climb up or down ladders in buildings and dungeons, down steel grates, or over
small rockpiles, fences, and other objects.

L /Look/
Identify any object or terrain feature or read signs one step away. Must be
followed by a direction. May allow further interaction with some objects, such
as wells and fountains.

M /Mix/
Prepare spell reagents for later use. Enter the first letters of the spell's
syllables, then select the appropriate reagents from the menu. Press <M> again
to mix.

N /New Order/
Exchanges the positions of any two party members, excluding the leader. Select
the two members to be exchanged from the roster menu with the cursor bar.

O /Open/
Opens an unlocked door or chest. Opening a locked chest will set off a trap if
the chest has one.

P /Push/
Allows small objects, like tables and chairs, to be moved around the room. May
be used to block doors.

Q /Save Game/
Save the current game status. If you do not use this command to end a playing
session, any progress made since the last save will be lost.

R /Ready/
Equip a party member with personal items from the party's stores. Use the arrow
keys and space bar to select or de-select an item in the menubar. Press ESC when
finished.

S /Search/
Search the location or object in the direction indicated. Searching may detect
traps on chests, concealed doors, dungeon floor traps, or reveal hidden items.
Use the south direction key to search the immediate area in the dungeon halls.

T /Talk/
Converse with merchants or townfolk in the direction indicated. Conversation is
possible over counters,  tables, fences, through windows, and doors with
windows.

U /Use/
Use a potion, spell, or other special item found during the game.

V /View/
Reveals a bird's eye map of the surrounding countryside, city, or dungeon floor
currently occupied. View requires a special item.

X /X-it/
Exit or dismount current form of transportation, leaving it behind while
continuing on foot. Horses not left on a hitching post may wander off. Exiting
from a ship is possible only if there is a skiff available or if the ship is
next to land.

Y /Yell/
On a ship, Yell will hoist or furl sails. In other situations, Yell will allow
you to enter up to two lines of text to be spoken loudly.

Z /Stats/
Displays the status and attributes of your party members, including several
screens of information such as supplies, weapons, and spells. Use the East and
West directional keys to change pages. Use the North and South directional keys
to scroll up and down long lists. Pressing the ESC or SPACE BAR will exit the
Z-stat screens.

1-6,0
Several commands require that one party member be designated to perform the
action. When this is required, an illuminated cursor bar will appear over the
names of your party members. Use the directional keys to highlight the name of
the character you wish to designate and press RETURN. Or, abort the command by
pressing ESC. Instead of designating which party member is to perform a command
each time you invoke it, you may set any living player as the "active player".
Until you select another party member or disable this feature by pressing 0,
this player will be the default player for those commands which require a single
party member for execution (i.e., jimmy, get, search, etc.). This player will
not serve as the default during combat, although you may seperately assign a
party member to be the active player during combat. To assign a player as the
active player, press the number key from 1 to 6 representing that player's
position in the party roster.

<Space Bar>
Pass a turn, allowing time in the game to proceed. Also aborts any command
requiring a directional key.

<Escape>
Aborts or exits commands which use scrolling menus. Also speeds exit from combat
scenes after all foes have been overcome.

CTRL-S
Turns sound effects on or off.

CTRL-T
Toggles speed between fast and slow on an Apple ][ GS on any Apple ][ equipped
with an Applied Engineering Transwarp or a compatible accelerator card.

CTRL-V
Set Mockingboard and Phasor volume. Must be followed by a number from 0-9


TO MAKE A BACKUP DISK:

To keep a backup copy of your characters' status or to play more than one game
simultaneously, use any ProDOS compatible utility to copy BOTH sides of the
Britannia/Underworld disk onto a blank floppy disk.


HINTS

Conversation is integral to Ultima V. Only by piecing together clues from the
different inhabitants can you complete your quests. You may ask inhabitants
about a number of topics. Often you will need to know what to ask a specific
person to glean interesting information. Everyone will talk about their job and
give you their name, and asking about these will often help you learn who else
to interview and what questions to ask them.

As an example of conversation, you might Talk to Dupre. First you type "JOB".
He responds, "I am hunting Gremlins!" Type "HUNTING" and he may respond with an
interesting insight. Or Iolo might have suggested that you ask Shamino about his
sword. If you have already spoken to Shamino, you would not have known to ask
him that, and must seek him out again. You may be asked questions by some of
those you meet. Consider carefully before responding; your life may depend on
it. How you converse with others will determine how willing they will be to
share information they have when you next meet them. Do converse with people
more than once. Some people you will meet may be willing to become your
travelling companion. If you wish to do so, invite them to "JOIN" your party.

Press RETURN or type "BYE" after an inhabitant's response to conclude a
conversation.

Keep a journal of your travels. Keep a list of the clues you pick up; there
will be too many for you to simply carry in your hand.

Thoroughly explore the Realm. Exploring each towne, castle, keep and other
populated spots will prove to be time well spent.


SCREEN VIEWS

<This part of the documentation refers to pictures in the manual. Most of it is
common sense, and stuff for beginners. So, we'll skip it.>


MUSIC WITH ULTIMA V
-------------------
Warriors Of Destiny includes over a dozen musical compositions ranging from
willage dances to castle fanfares. To hear the music, you need an Apple //e
with 128K of memory and any of the following boards:

SWEET MICRO SYSTEMS
 A. Mockingboard A
 B. Sound I
 C. Mockingboard C
 D. Sound II
 E. Sound / Speech I
APPLIED ENGINEERING
 F. Phasor
PASSPORT DESIGNS
 G. Apple MIDI Interface (for use with MIDI synthesizers)

To start the music, select "ACTIVATE MUSIC" from the Title Screen menu. From
the Music Configuration menu, select "CHANGE MUSIC CONFIGURATION."

For each of your music boards, place a letter (from the list above) under the
number of the slot in which the board is installed. Only one MIDI board can be
used, and the total number of voices for all other boards cannot exceed twelve.
Press RETURN after making your music board selections.

To save your settings for later recall, select "SAVE MUSIC CONFIGURATION". To
exit from the Music Configuration menu, select "RETURN TO THE GAME."


MIDI INTERFACE

If you selected a MIDI interface, a MIDI Information screen will appear. Set
"MIDI CHANNEL" to match your synthesizer. Set "NUMBER OF VOICES" to the maximum
number of notes which your synthesizer can play at one time.

The name of each Musical Selection will be displayed with a corresponding
Instrument Suggestion. Use the cursor or type the first letter of the title to
select a song. Enter MIDI NUMBERS using either of the following methods:

Select an instrument from your synthesizer keyboard. The MIDI NUMBER will
automatically be entered on the Apple screen. (This method works with most, but
not all MIDI synthesizers.)
  -OR-
Type in the MIDI NUMBER (MIDI Program Change number) on your Apple.
Synthesizers use various numbering schemes, so check your manual. Instrument 1
is usually Program Change number 0. Hit RETURN to hear the song played in that
voice.

When finished entering MIDI information, press ESC to return to the
Configuration Menu.

*Note: Phasor boards must be set to "Phasor Mode" (all four switches in
closed position.)
