King of the Court
-----------------

Basketball.  The lightning-paced sport for super-athletes.  The game of
strategy, guts, stamina, and--most of all--teamwork.

It's all here, in GBA Championship Basketball: Two-on-Two.

Two-on-Two helps you develop the strategies and skills to make you play like
a pro.  You can play with a teammate and learn teamwork.  You can can pick
your offensive alignment while your opponent sets his defense.  And when your
opponent has the ball, you can choose among several defensive strategies.

Two-on-Two gives you lots of ways to compete: one player against the
computer, two players against a computer team, two players against each
other, practice sessions, and even a 24-team league competition climaxing in
the GBA Championship Game.

This Player's Guide includes all the information you'll need to play
Two-on-Two.  The first section, "Getting Started," tells you how to load the
program into your computer.

"The Chalkboard Menus" describes all your options for playing the game, from
the two practice modes to the four game modes.  There's also a DEMO mode that
lets you watch two computer-controlled teams go head-to-head against each
other.  This section also tells you how to use the joystick and command keys.
 "The Scouting Report" shows you how to rate your playing skills for inside
and outside shooting, dribbling, stealing, quickness, and jumping.  In
addition, you'll get your first look at your computer opponents--all the
teams you'll have to beat to make it to the GBA Championship game.

In "How to Pass and Shoot," you'll find all the information you need to
develop your passing game and become a team player.  And you'll learn all
about jump shots, hook shots, slam dunks, tip-ins, and rebounds.

"The Player Draft" tells you all about your superstar computer teammates-- 10
players in all, each one patterned after a real professional basketball star.

"Calling Plays" describes the offensive and defensive strategies you'll need
to outsmart and outplay your opponents.

The "Penalties" section explains fouls and other violations and describes how
you can use the clock to your advantage by calling time-outs.

"After the Game" tells you how to read the box scores from the game you just
played and how to start a new game.

Getting Started
---------------

You must have version 2.0 ROM chips in your Apple IIgs to play GBA
Championship Basketball.  If your computer is not so equipped, see your Apple
dealer.

To load GBA Championship Basketball: Two-on-Two into your computer, follow
these steps:

(Note: Do not write-protect your GBA Championship Basketball diskette.)

You may use a joystick or the keyboard to play a one-player game of GBA
Championship Basketball.  During a two-player game, player one uses the
joystick and player two uses the keyboard.  See "Joystick and Keyboard
Controls".

If your computer is off:

1. Insert the GBA Championship Basketball diskette in your disk drive, label
side up.

2. Turn on your computer and monitor.  (Press the <esc> key to skip the title
and credit screens.)  After the title and credit screens appear, the PLAY
OPTIONS chalkboard appears.

If your computer is already on:

1. Insert the GBA Championship Basketball diskette in your disk drive, label
side up.

2. Hold down the command and control keys and press the reset button at the
top left of the keyboard.

Sound

If you like, you may press <control> and <s> at the same time to turn the
sound on and off.  You can also press the up and down arrow keys to gradually
raise and lower the sound level.

The Chalkboard Menus
--------------------

Following the introductory music and credit screens, a green chalkboard
appears on your screen with three choices: DEMO, GAME, and PRACTICE.  You'll
notice the GAME option is highlighted in white.  If you're using a joystick,
pull back or push forward on it to highlight the option you want, then press
the button.  If you're using the keyboard, use the up and down arrow keys to
highlight the option you want, then press <return> to make your selection.

(Note: Both players can use the up and down arrow keys to highlight
selections and the <return> key to make selections while at any of the
chalkboard menus.)

A new chalkboard then appears.  What you see depends on which type of action
you've selected.

If you selected PRACTICE or GAME you are prompted to select between
ONE-PLAYER or TWO-PLAYER action.  You should now skip to "Practice Options"
to practice or "Game Options" to play a real game.

If you selected DEMO, the computer controls all players, and you're allowed
to choose between SELECTED PLAYERS or RANDOM PLAYERS.

When you select RANDOM PLAYERS, the computer picks both players for both
teams, then displays a chalkboard showing who was drafted.  Press <return> to
start the game.

When you select SELECTED PLAYERS, a chalkboard displaying the name of 10
players appears, and you're allowed to pick both players of both teams.
You're prompted to first pick TEAM ONE PLAYER ONE and TEAM ONE PLAYER TWO,
the repeat to process for TEAM TWO PLAYER ONE and TEAM TWO PLAYER TWO.

To make your selections, use the joystick or appropriate up or down key to
highlight the player you want.  Then press the button (with the joystick) or
<return> to make your selection.

After you've selected a player, highlight CONTINUE and press <return> or the
joystick button to move to the next chalkboard.

You'll then see a screen that confirms your choices and tells you what color
jersey each player will wear when play begins.

Press <return> to start the game.  The computer-controlled cagers will play
four six-minute quarters, moving up and down court automatically each time
the ball changes hands.

You can pause play by pressing <esc> (this does NOT stop action if a player
is shooting).  To return to the initial chalkboard menu and select another
game before the demo contest is complete, press <control> and the <r> key
together.

Practice Options

No one wants to hit the courts cold.  Just as in real basketball, it's a good
idea to warm up a little before playing a game, so you may want to select
PRACTICE from the opening chalkboard menu.  Two-on-Two offers you two
practice modes: ONE- and TWO-PLAYER.

Use the joystick or the up and down arrow keys to highlight the option you
want, then press the joystick button or <return>.

ONE-PLAYER (one player on the court by himself)

You can practice with either the keyboard or the joystick; use the up and
down arrow keys to highlight your choice-- JOYSTICK or KEYBOARD-- then press
<return> to practice.   See "Joystick and Keyboard controls" for instructions
on controlling your player.

If you selected JOYSTICK, make sure your joystick is plugged into your
computer's joystick port.  You can practice shooting inside and outside and
work on your hook shots, jump shots, slam dunks, tip-ins, and rebounds.  The
scoreboard shows you how many points you've run up during this practice
session.  When you hit a basket or toss the ball out of bounds, the ball is
automatically returned to you.  Press <esc> to return to the chalkboard menus
when you're through practicing.

TWO-PLAYER (two players on the court)

Player One uses the joystick, Player Two the keyboard in two-player practice
games.  Notice that Player One is always in the blue jersey, Player Two in
light red.  You can practice different shots, from hooks to dunks, as well as
dribbling, rebounding, and tip-ins.  (All tip-ins are scored to the shooter.)
 You can play straight one-on-one or other "pick-up" games such as "Around
the World" and "HORSE"

How to Play "Around the World."  Player One tries a shot from the baseline--
say, at the edge of the key (the key is the area between the inner white line
and the basket).  Every time the player makes a basket, he or she moves
further along the edge of the key, working around the key to the baseline on
the other side of the basket.  If Player One misses a shot, Player Two gets a
turn.  When a player misses a shot, he must shoot again from the same spot on
his or her next turn, and stay in that spot until he or she makes a basket.
The first player to go "Around the World" wins.

How to Play "HORSE."  Player One makes a shot from anywhere on the court.
Player Two must then make the same shot or he will get an "H."  When Player
One misses, Player Two can make a shot from wherever he or she wants, and
Player One has to make the same shot.  Everytime a player misses, he gets
another letter until the word HORSE is spelled.  Whoever gets all the letters
first, loses.  (Note: The letters in HORSE do not appear on the screen.  You
must keep track of the "score" yourself).

As with the ONE PLAYER option, each basket you hit is recorded on the
scoreboard, and there are no fouls or time clock.

To leave the practice game and return to the chalkboard menus, press <esc>.

The Scouting Report

Once you're warmed up and ready to play ball, you still have to rate your
playing abilities on a screen called The Scouting Report.  It might look like
this:

    INSIDE.............2    OUTSIDE...........6
    DRIBBLING..........3    QUICKNESS.........5
    STEALING...........5    JUMPING...........3

            RACE: BLACK/(WHITE)

INSIDE refers to your shooting accuracy inside the key.

OUTSIDE refers to your shooting accuracy outside the key.

DRIBBLING rates your maneuverability with the ball.

QUICKNESS rates your maneuverability both on defense and when you're not
handling the ball on offense.

STEALING rates your ability to outmaneuver the ball handler and steal the
ball.

JUMPING rates your ability to block shots and come down with rebounds.

The highest rating you can give yourself is 6 (very skilled), and the lowest
is 2 (minimally skilled).  Notice that INSIDE and OUTSIDE are grouped
together, as are DRIBBLING and QUICKNESS and STEALING and JUMPING.  Within
each of these groupings, the total skill level always equals 8.

So if you choose to rate yourself 3 as an outside shooter, you must be a 5
inside.  If you choose a 6 rating at stealing, you'll only be a 2 at jumping.
 After all, you can't be great at everything.  Remember, too, that in a game
situation you'll want to select your offensive and defensive strategies
according to your strengths and weaknesses.

Game Options

TWO-PLAYER HEAD-TO-HEAD

Each player has a computer teammate.  Each player names his team, then types
in his own name and rates himself when the Scouting Report screen appears
(see page 7).  (When entering your name or a team name, you may use up to 12
letters.)

Player One uses the joystick to highlight the choices and the joystick button
to change the ratings and move between BLACK and WHITE.  Player Two then uses
teh arrow keys to highlight CONTINUE and presses <return> to make the
selection.

Each player also picks a computer teammate from the Player Draft, which
includes ten pros, each one patterned after a real-life basketball superstar.
 (For details of the Player Draft, see the appropriate section).

A STARTING LINEUP SUMMARY screen lists player names, with corresponding
uniform colors, and shows which team is "home" and which is "visitor".

TWO PLAYER TEAMMATES

When you select this option, you and a friend team up against a hard-driving
computer team.  You first type in a TEAM NAME of 12 letters or less, then
pick a DIVISION to play in.  The division you choose determines the caliber
of your computer opponents.  NORTH is the easiest division, SOUTH is tougher,
EAST is tougher still, and WEST is the toughest of all.

Take a look at the chart.  It gives you a breakdown of all the teams in every
division.  Notice that the rating totals are higher in the tougher divisions.
 For example, in the easy North, the INSIDE and OUTSIDE ratings total 7; but
in the tough West, they total 10.  Since the players in the West are better,
the West teams have higher ratings.

When Player One types in his name (12 letters or less) and presses <return>,
the Player One Scouting Report allows Player One to rate his abilities.  Then
Player Two types in his name and rates himself.  In this mode, Player One has
the light blue jersey, Player Two the dark blue one.

ONE PLAYER EXHIBITION GAME

You and your computer-controlled teammate challenge a computer team.  Type in
your TEAM NAME and YOUR NAME and pick a DIVISION.  Again, the division you
select determines how tough your opponents will be.  Next, rate yourself on
inside and outside shooting, dribbling, stealing, quickness, and jumping.

Finally, you select your computer-controlled teammate from the Player Draft.
Do you want the great outside shooting of Larry Berg or the dynamite inside
moves of Kareem Ugrin?  Strategy is important, because you'll want a player
whose talents will complement your own, someone who's going to be effective
against your opponents.  (Again, use the chart "Your Computer Opponents" to
scope out your opponents' strengths and weaknesses).

Your team will always be the HOME team, with the player you control in the
light blue uniform.

ONE PLAYER LEAGUE PLAY

This game mode allows you and a computer teammate to play in league
competition that can take you all the way to the GBA Championship.

You first choose a division to play in (North, South, East, or West), then
play a five-game season against the other five teams in that division.

Once you've selected League Play, the computer screen will ask if you want to
GET TEAM or assemble a NEW TEAM.  If you select GET TEAM, you'll continue to
play with a team you've already created--that is, your current team.  Select
NEW TEAM to create a new team; your old team (if you had one) and its league
record will be ERASED from the game disk.  In other words, you can have only
one team at a time.  (If you try to create a new team and there's already a
team on the disk, the screen will display the message "Warning: Selecting new
team will erase your current team.")  However, you can go from League Play to
Exhibition Play without erasing your League Team from the game disk.

You'll play a five-game schedule.  The computer will select your opponents
within your chosen division until you've played all five.  Playing in the
easier divisions will of course mean easier games-- until you get to the
playoffs.  At the end of the season, the computer will compare your win/loss
record with the records of the other teams in your division.  If you have the
best divisional record, or if you're tied for the division lead and have
beaten your co-leader, you'll advance to the playoffs.  The playoff schedule
is set up so that the easiest division (North) plays the hardest division
(West) in Game 1; in Game 2, South meets East.  The winners from Game 1 and
Game 2 then meet in the GBA Championship Game.

How to Pass, Shoot, and Move Around
-----------------------------------

Joystick and Keyboard Controls

In one-player games against a computer-controlled team, you may use either a
joystick or the keyboard to move your player around.  In two-player games,
the home team player uses the joystick and the visiting team player uses the
keyboard.

The joystick works as described in "Passing" and "Shooting."  The keyboard
works as shown below; you may use either cluster of keys shown.

         ^                  ^
     \   |   /          \   |   /
      Q  W  E            7  8  9
   <- A  S  D ->      <- 4  5  6 ->
      Z  X  C            1  2  3
     /   |   \          /   |   \
         v                  v

To move your on-court player in a particular direction, tap and release the
key corresponding to that direction.  Press the <S> or <5> key to stop the
player.  Use the <option> key as your "fire" button to jump and shoot.

Passing

Naturally, good teamwork means getting the ball to your teammate when he's in
he open.  And to do that, you've got to become a good passer.

To pass to your teammate when you have the ball, quickly press and
immediately release the joystick button.  If your teammate has the ball and
you want him to pass to you, quickly press the button.  Your teammate will
usually pass you the ball, but not always-- after all, any player can become
a ball hog now and then.  Your teammate may also pass the ball to you if he
sees that you're open, even if you don't press the joystick button-- unless
you're moving, in which case he'll never pass to you unless you press the
joystick button.  If you pass to your computer teammate while he's moving,
he'll stop to try to catch the ball.

In order to catch the ball you must be directly in line with it.  Otherwise,
the ball will go out of bounds or will be stolen by your opponents.

Shooting

Shooting Basics

When you have the ball and want to make a shot, first hold down the joystick
button.  Your player will begin his shot by jumping and will release the ball
at the same time you release the button.  You must time the release to the
jump.  If you release the ball at the top of the jump, you have a better
chance of scoring.

So your success in shooting depends on your ability to release the joystick
button at just the right moment.  If you look very closely, you'll notice
that at the very top of his jump, your player will cock his wrist slightly,
preparing to shoot.  It is at this moment that you should release the button.
 If you release the button too early or too late, you will still make some of
your shots, but a smaller percentage than if you time it perfectly.  You
should also be aware that if you fail to release the button before your
player comes back to the floor, you'll be charged with traveling (See
"Penalties").  In addition to your timing, the other factor that will
determine your shooting percentage is your Player Scouting Report-- that is,
your rating as an inside and outside shooter.

Hook Shots

To make a hook shot, you must be downcourt, near the baseline, with your back
to the basket (as you look at your player on the screen, he must be facing 9
o' clock or 3 o' clock).  With a hook shot, the ball is released as the
player's arm "hooks" over his head.  The advantage of this type of shot is
that it cannot be blocked.

Slam Dunks

A slam dunk may be the most satisfying shot in basketball.  What could be
better than actually stuffing the ball through the hoop?  To slam dunk, you
must have a 4, 5, or 6 rating as an inside shooter.  You must be at the
baseline, as far downcourt as you can go, and you must shoot when you're in
one of three areas: under the basket, half a step left or low post left
(LPL), or half a step right of low post right (LPR) (see "Zones on the
Court").  Finally, there must be NO DEFENDERS under the basket.  If all of
these conditions are met, a slam dunk will ALWAYS be successful.

Tip-Ins

If an offensive player grabs a rebound while directly facing the basket (as
you look at him on the screen, facing 12 o' clock with his back to you),
he'll tip the ball in for a basket.  As long as the player is facing the
basket and underneath it, the tip-in will be automatic if you make your
player jump.  Again, only an offensive player can tip the ball in.  (In the
practice mode, either player can tip the ball in.)

Rebounds

A player can rebound only when he's in the area immediately surrounding the
basket.  To rebound press the joystick button in the same way you do to make
a shot-- your player will jump for the ball.  Timing your jump is the key to
successful rebounding.

Shooting Percentages

Nobody can make every kind of shot every time.  But you can increase your
shooting percentage by working on the timing of your release.  (Of course, it
also helps to have a high rating).  The following charts show the percentage
of outside and inside shots you'll make based on the timing of your release
and your outside shooting ability.

Outside Shooting Percentages

Outside Rating:                6        5     4     3     2

When release is:

very early....................10%      10    10    10    10

early.........................30%      20    10    10    10

a little early................50%      40    30    20    10

perfect.......................70%      60    50    40    30

a little late.................60%      50    40    30    20

late..........................40%      30    20    10    10

very late.....................20%      10    10    10    10

Inside Shooting Percentages

Inside Rating:                 6        5     4     3     2

very early....................30%      20    10    10    10

early.........................50%      40    30    20    10

a little early................70%      60    50    40    30

perfect.......................90%      80    70    60    50

a little late.................80%      70    60    50    40

late..........................60%      50    40    30    20

very late.....................40%      30    20    10    10

3-Point Shots

If a player shoots a basket from outside the white 3-point line (see
illustration on page 21), that basket is good for 3 points instead of the
usual 2.  Successful 3-point shots are based on a player's outside shooting
rating and the timing of his release.  However, if a player shoots from
outside the white 3-point line, the odds of that shot's being good are only
half the odds of a regular outside shot.  For example, if a 6-rated outside
shooter releases the ball perfectly from beyond the 3-point line, he has only
a 35% chance of making that shot.

Shooting From Under the Basket

Whenever a player shoots directly under the basket, his chance of scoring is
based only on his inside rating, not on his timing.  As long as he releases
the ball before he's called for traveling, it's assumed that his timing is
perfect.

Notes on Defense: Stealing the Ball and Blocking Shots

To steal the ball from the offense, you must "bump" the ballhandler on the
side on which he's dribbling or holding the ball.  Any player's success at
stealing the ball will be based on his rating at STEALING-- see "The Scouting
Report."

To block a shot, move in close to the ballhandler and press your joystick
button to jump just as he goes up for a shot.  Your success in blocking the
shot will depend on how close you are to the ballhandler and your rating at
JUMPING-- see "The Scouting Report."

Your Computer Teammate

Your computer teammate is an intelligent player.  If he's under the basket,
he'll shoot.  If he sees that you're open under the basket, he'll pass the
ball to you.  If the block is about to run out (either the 24-second shot
clock or the quarter clock), he'll shoot if he has the ball.  If he's being
covered and he realizes he can't drive to the basket, he'll pull up and shoot
from as close as he can get.

Remember, just as in real basketball, the key element in Two-On-Two is
teamwork.  Your computer teammate is designed to work with you to beat your
opponents.  Not matter how good you are as an individual player, you'll never
make it to the GBA Championship unless you learn to play as a team.

The Player Draft
----------------

After you've rated your abilities, you get to draft a computer-controlled
teammate.  In the two-player mode, each player gets to draft a computer
teammate unless you're playing the TWO PLAYER TEAMMATES option.  You have ten
players from which to choose, each patterned after a real basketball
superstar.

When the player draft screen appears, you'll see ten names in white letters,
with the two "pointer" basketballs on either side of a name.  Use your
joystick to line up the basketballs next to the name of the player you want,
then release the joystick and press the joystick button.  This will highlight
your choice in yellow.  Finally, move the balls down to the word CONTINUE and
press the joystick button to go to the next screen.

Your Superstar Teammates

Here are the computer stars you can play with:

Magic Lyndon.  One of the best players in the game, famous for his
sleight-of-hand passing.  Now you see it, now you don't.  Magic provides that
extra magic that can take you all the way to the GBA Championship.

Jerry Orr.  A consistently high scorer, Orr has been known to score over 50
points in a game.  He knows how to draw fouls from opponents and almost never
misses from the free throw line.

Elgin Cutter.  Some say he's the best pressure player in the game.  He once
scored 61 points in a GBA playoff game-- a record.  Cutter has some deadly
inside moves.

John Madland.  An excellent defensive player.  When Madland's on the court,
expect lots of turnovers.  Also a dynamite outside shooter.

Larry Berg.  If you want a teammate who can do it all, Berg's your man.  A
real team player who knows how to win.  Great all-around abilities.  Berg can
shoot and pass with either hand.  He received the GBA Most Valuable Player
Award two years in a row.

Kareem Ugrin.  Some say he's getting too old, but Ugrin seems to just get
better.  A great inside shooter with an almost unstoppable hook shot, Ugrin
recently became the highest scorer in GBA history.  He's also a ferocious
rebounder.

Walt Barnett.  A superb rebounder and one of the best defensive players
around.

Julius Keith.  Dr. K.  When he's not selling basketball shoes or soft drinks
on TV, Keith can be found driving defenders crazy on the court.  He averages
over 30 points a game and has some of the best moves in the game.

Oscar Dunbar.  A player with all the right moves, Dunbar is considered the
best guard of all time.  A great player at any position, he's equally adept
at inside and outside shooting.

Wilt Dulmage.  a.k.a. Wilt the Tilt.  This man is great at blocking shots and
coming down with the ball.  Also one of the few unstoppable inside shooters.

The Super Teammate Player Draft chart rates the talents of your computer
teammates.  The numbers indicate their skills at inside and outside shooting,
dribbling, stealing, quickness, and jumping.  Unlike the ratings for
yourself, these are fixed.  Because all these stars are excellent players,
they rate no lower than 4.  A 6 is the highest rating a player can have.

Notice that the total within each grouping (Inside and Outside, Dribbling and
Stealing, and Quickness and Jumping) totals 10 for your superstar teammate,
as opposed to 8 for your other player.

Calling Plays
-------------

In all the game modes except two-player teammates, you must choose an
offensive and defensive alignment every time you're on offense or defense.
The PLAYCALLING SCREEN comes up whenever there's a change of possession
because of a basket, steal, defensive rebound, or penalty.

Although the game is actually played on a full court, you see only half the
court at a time.  Every time there's a change of possession or a basket is
good, the players run down the court and the offense brings the ball up from
mid-court.

The playcalling screen replaces the scoreboard for about seven seconds while
the players automatically run down the court and bring the ball back into
play.  The playcalling screen disappears when the ball handler crosses center
court.  So you have seven seconds to select a play.  If you fail to select a
play, the computer will automatically pick one for you.  (On defense the
computer will pick LOW ZONE (LZN) and on offense it will pick BASKET (BKT)).

The playcalling screen is divided into OFFENSE and DEFENSE.  For offense the
screen shows a picture of your joystick surrounded by the abbreviations BKT,
RHT, TOP, LFT, and SCRN, which stand for the five offensive plays you can
choose from.  For defense the screen shows a picture of your joystick
surrounded by the abbreviations LZN, HZN, MMD, and MML, which stand for the
for defensive alignments you can choose from.

You select a play by moving your joystick forward, back, right, or left to
"point to" the play you want: forward for BKT or LZN, back for TOP or HZN,
right for RHT or MMD, and left for LFT or MML.  On offense you can also use
the joystick button if want to select the SCRN play.

If you've called a play, but change your mind while the playcalling screen is
still visible, simply push the joystick in the direction of the new play you
want.  Whenever you call a play, you'll hear a tone at the same time the word
OFFENSE or DEFENSE flashes.

Whenever you call a play, whether on offense or defense, you are telling your
computer teammate what to do.

Following is a complete rundown of the plays.  It will help you to understand
the plays if you also study "Zones on the Court"
