After [P] Pitch: 

[RETURN] -
(sets the play in motion) Hit away. 

[R] Run (HIT & RUN) -
(sets  the  play in motion) With a runner on first and no one on second,
you may start the runner moving with the pitch by pressing [R].  Hitting
and  running  will increase the probability of taking an extra base on a
hit and will lower the chance of a double play, but calling for a HIT  &
RUN  will  result  in  a  steal attempt if the batter takes the pitch or
fails to make contact. Hitting & running takes some power away from  the
batter  but  increases  the  number  of hits through the infield (mostly
singles) as a defensive player moves to  cover  second.  The  chance  of
success  for a HIT & RUN depends in part on the HIT & RUN ability of the
batter and his strike-out frequency. 

[B] Bunt -
(sets the play in motion) With one or more runners on base, press [B] to
call for a sacrafice bunt. Bunting ability is mostly a question  of  bat
control.  Players  who  do  not strike out a lot will be better bunters.
Drawing the infield in  does  NOT  affect  the  chance  of  a  succesful
sacrafice  because the effects of suprise and defensive positioning have
been built into the outcomes. 

With a runner on third, runners  on  second  and  third,  or  the  bases
loaded, a bunt is assumed to be a squeeze play (the runner on third will
be  heading  home  with  the pitch). With runners on first and third the
offensive manager will almost always be given the  option  to  hold  the
runner at third or to squeeze. 

Important  note:  Plays  which only change the count on the batter, like
foul balls, do remove the bunt and Hit & Run calls. After each play, you
must make these calls again if you still want them to be in effect. 

[S] Steal -
(sets the play in motion) With one or more runners on base, press [S] to
call for a steal. With more than one base  runner,  you  will  be  asked
which base(s) you wish to steal. Exception: if you're stealing home with
runners  on  second and third, or the bases loaded, the trailing runners
will advance automatically. 

A number of factors affect the chance of a successful steal. They're (in
order of importance): the runners Steal  Success  Number;  the  runner's
Steal  Allowance  rating,  which reflects the frequency of his real life
steal attempts (A-high to G-low, Rare,  Never);  the  cather's  throwing
arm;  the pitcher's move to first; the base situation; and occasionally,
the side from which the batter is batting. 

Special situation: with runners at first and  third,  if  the  offensive
manager  calls  for  a  double  steal, the defensive manager must decide
whether to make a throw. If he does not throw, the runner on first  will
steal  second  unmolested  and the runner on third will hold. If he does
throw, the catcher's throw will always go to second, and  the  defensive
manager  will  be  given  the  opportunity to cut the throw to home (the
steal of home is a delayed steal). If the throw is not cut off, that is,
if a play is made at second,and the runner is tagged out for out  number
three, the runner on third will score ahead of the out about half of the
time. 

[T] Time -
Press [T] to step out of the box (call time). Calling time nullifies the
pitch.  Only  the manager whose team is at bat may call time. After time
is called, either  manager  may  make  new  managerial  decisions.  Play
proceeds  as  if  the  pitch  were never made; however, if the defensive
manager has already called for HOLD, STRETCH, or IN,  those  calls  will
remain in effect. 

Important  notes:  Hitting  &  running  and bunting often create a count
agains the batter (more strikes than balls). A count against the  batter
increases the chance of a batter striking out. 

Occasionally  a  sign - an offensive managerial call - will be missed by
the batter or base runner. Play will proceed as if the sign had not been
given. 

[Dynamic Decisions: Base Advancement, Throwing, and Fielding]

Dynamic decisions are managerial calls which must  be  made  during  the
play.   The  program  allows  a  limited time to make the decisions. You
determine the time limit in advance from the RULES AND DATA SCREEN. 

Each dynamic decision demands a response. Press the number of the choice
of your decision. If you do not respond (make a decision)  in  the  time
alotted, a decision will be made for you. This automatic decision is the
default  and  generally  is  the  "conservative" decision. Sometimes the
default is the obvious decision; for instance, the default  response  to
"MAKE THROW?" on a steal atempt is always "yes."

Important  note:  For  dynamic  decisions,  the  response  marked with a
asterisk (*) is the default. If you do  nothing,  the  default  response
will guide what happens next. 

Dynamic  decisions  for  the  offensive  manager  are  base  advancement
decisions for example "TRY FOR  THIRD?"  and  "TRY  FOR  SECOND  ON  THE
THROW?"  When  the  offensive  manager  is  asked  to  make  advancement
decisions, the defensive manager  has  to  make  throwing  decisions  in
response. 

Occasionally  the  defensive  manager  will  be  asked  to make fielding
choices as well, for example: "GO FOR DOUBLE PLAY OR OUT AT HOME?" These
fielding decisions will  not  require  a  response  from  the  offensive
manager. 

You  will  need some information to help you decide when to advance base
or when to try to throw out a base runner. This information is  provided
in four ways: 

1)  The  description of the play gives you verbal clue about your chance
of advancing successfully. These descriptions include  such  information
as  how  far  the  ball  was  hit, where and how it was fielded, and the
postion of the runner. 

2) The arm and fielding ratings of the defensive players  are  displayed
by  their names - the outfielder handling the ball is marked with a flag
sign. 

3) The speed ratings of base runners are displayed next to their names. 

4) The number of outs is displayed on the scoreboard - with two outs the
runners with be moving on contact. 

[Cutting Off Throws]

When a manager chooses to advance an  extra  base  on  the  outfielder's
throw, the defensive manager usually will be given an opportunity to cut
off the throw (to make the play on a trailing runner). Any runner headed
for  home  when  the  ball is cut off will score, and his run will count
even if the third out is subsequently made on the play. 

The chances of putting out a trailing runner depend largly on the  speed
of  that  runner and the chance of advancement of the runner on whom the
play was originally being made. The closer  the  play  on  the  original
runner,  the  greater the chance of the trailing runner has of advancing
if a play is subsequently made on him. Exception: if the chance  of  the
original runner advancing successfully is an almost sure thing, then the
chance  of  the  trailing  runner advancing even with the cutoff is also
good. In this case it is usually better not to make a play for the  lead
runner. 

There  is  no  cutoff option when the runner is attempting to advance on
the hit rather than the throw. 

[Pinch Hitting and Pinch Running]

At any time in the game the offensive manager may choose a pinch  hitter
or  pinch  runner.  To do this press [CONTROL] [O] (if the ball has been
pitched, call [T] Time  first).  The  Pinch  Hitter/Runner  Screen  will
appear. It contains the same information as the Line-up Screen. 

To  make  a  substitution,  press  [A],select  the  letter of the player
entering the game, then select the [B] Batter or [1]...[3]  base  runner
to  be  replaced.   Players  NOT  available for pinching are highlighted
(players playing the game) or marked OUT, EJECTED, or INJURED. 

Important note: The only offensive [M] Move permitted  during  the  game
allows  the pitcher to pinch-hit or pinch-run for the designated hitter.
This [M] Move will invalidate the DH for the remainder of the game. 

Important notes after play begins: Once a player is announced,he  is  in
the game! Once a player is replaced, he is out of the game! 

[Defensive Substitutions, Moves, and Relief Pitching]

At  any time in the game before the ball has been pitched, the defensive
manager may make a defensive substitution, move  defensive  players,  or
bring  in a relief picture. Press [CONTROL] [D]. The Substitution Screen
will appear.  It contains the same information as the Line-up Screen. 

To make a substitution: press [A].  Select  the  letter  of  the  player
entering  the  game,  position  in  the  batting  order,  and  defensive
position.  Again, players NOT available for substitution are highlighted
or marked OUT, EJECTED or INJURED. Remember: the Official Baseball Rules
specify that once a player is announced he is in the game. 

To move a player to a new defensive  position:  press  [M].  Select  the
batting  position  of  the  player  to  be  moved.  Then  select the new
defensive position of the player. [M] Move is useful when you have  used
a  pinch  hitter  or pinch runner and you wish to announce his defensive
position. You can also use  it  to  swith  players  in  the  field,  for
instance, to move a better "arm" to right field from left field. 

To  bring  in  a  relief  pitcher  simply  make  a  substitution  in the
appropriate spot in the batting order. Press [A]. Then select the letter
of the pitcher entering the game, position in  the  batting  order,  and
defensive position (pitcher). 

Any  player  may  be  used  as a relief or starting pitcher (if your own
league rules permit it), but his grade, control, and  endurance  factors
will  be  adjusted  according  to  his  probable  skills.  Remember: the
Official Baseball Rules require a relief pitcher  to  face  atleast  one
batter or to pitch until the side is retired. 

For  all  defensive  substitutions,  [ESC]  will  back  you  out  of  an
incomplete announcement or move. 

Important notes: Once the game begins, a player cannot be moved from one
position in the batting order to another. If  you  wish  to  change  the
batting  order  before  the  game  begins,  a  player can be removed and
reannounced at a different spot in the order. 

If a player is INJURED or EJECTED,  the  manager  will  be  required  to
replace  him only when it becomes necessary, (that is, when he must bat,
run the bases, or take a defensive position). If there is not  a  player
eligible to play at that time, the understaffed team forfeits the game. 

To  help  make  pinch  running,  pinch  hitting  and  other substitution
decisions, you can examine the complete player staatistics by using  [D]
Display and [A]...[Z] or batting order number [1]...[9] of the player to
be  studied.  When you choose a player in this manner, the Player Screen
will appear. 

[The Player Screen]

The player's name is in the upper left-hand corner. 

<Defensive ratins and statistics>

Throws -
The arm with which the player throws (Right/Left). 

Arm -
Rating of arm strength and accuracy: range 20 to 40 (higher is  better).
The arm rating of an outfielder is an important consideration for making
base  advancement and throwing decisions. The arm rating of an infielder
who relays the ball also affects the outcome of the play. 

Positions -
A list of positions for which a player is rated defensively. If a player
is rated at a position, then he appeared at that position in the  season
represented. His primary position is marked with an asterisk. 

Rating -
The  defensive  fielding  rating.  The following are ranges for fielding
ratings by position (higher is better): 

pitcher        1 to 2             third baseman 3 to 6
catcher        5 to 9             shortstop     6 to 10
first baseman  2 to 5             outfielder    1 to 3
second baseman 5 to 9

The total of defensive ratings for the  infield  (six  players)  is  the
Infield Rating. The total for the entire team (nine players) is the Team
Rating.  Although the individual fielding ratings are the most important
factor in determining how well your team plays, the outcome of plays  in
which  the ball is handled by several players is sometimes determined by
the Infield and Team Ratings. Again, higher is better. 

Important note: If you play a player at a position for which he  is  not
rated,  he will be given the lowest rating for that position. Exception:
good-fielding shortstops and second baseman may be rated slightly better
than "lowest" at other infield positions. 

Any player may play at any position, but for realistic outcomes, players
should not be used at unlisted positions unless  injuries  or  ejections
require it. 

Injury -
Determines  the  seriousness  of  the  injury should a player be injured
(higher tend to be a more serious injury): range 0 to 4. 

Throw -
A rating of the strength and accuracy of  a  cather's  throwing  arm  on
steal  attempts: range th-4 to th+6 (higher is better). Non-catchers who
are playing catcher are always rated th-4. 

PB -
Passed ball rating: range 0 to 3 (lower is better). This rating  affects
the  frequency of passed balls. Non-catchers who are playing catcher are
always rated 3. 

Season and Game Statistics -
Fielding percentages  (PCT),  defensive  games  played  defensive  games
played (G), put-outs (PO), assists (A), and errors (E). 

Season  statistics  are  the  officially  published  statistics for that
season.  Game statistics are updated after every play and are  reset  at
the  beginning  of  each game. Game statistics can be printed out at the
end of the game by pressing [CONTROL]  [P]  (see  END-OF-GAME  OPTIONS).
Game  statistics  can  also  be printed out at any time during the game,
again by pressing [CONTROL] [P]. 

<Offensive ratings and statistics>

Bats -
The side the player bats from: Right/Left/Both (R/L/B). A switch  hitter
(Both)  is assumed to bat from the side opposite the throwing arm of the
pitcher. 

Type -
The type of hitter: straightaway (SA), pulls to left field  (PL),  pulls
to  right  field (PR), switch hitters who pull to both fields (PB). Type
affects where and how hard the ball is hit. Only  extreme  pull  hitters
are given a PL, PR, or PB. 

Platoon -
A  rating  determining  how  much  a batter gives up to a pitcher who is
throwing from the same side as he is batting: range 0  to  5  (lower  is
better).  Example:  if  a right-handed pitcher with grade 15 is facing a
right-handed batter with platoon 5, the pitcher will perform  as  if  he
were a grade 20 pitcher. 

Speed -
Running speed: range 1 to 20 (higher is faster).  Slow = 1 to 6, Average
=  7  to  14,  Fast  =  15 to 20. Speed is an important consideration in
making base advancement in many situations where  no  decision  must  be
made. 

Steal Allowance -
Rates  the  frequency  of  steal attempts: range A to G, Rare, and Never
("A" rated players steal most frequently). The middle and lower  ratings
can  substantially  reduce the chance of a successful steal, except when
the stealing runner on first is not being held on. 

Steal Success -
Rates the success of steal attempts: range 0 to 36 (higher is  better  -
36 means he was successful on every attempt). This is the primary rating
used to determine steal attempt outcomes. 

Hit & Run Ability -
Rates  the hitting-for-average ability of a player (how much his batting
average will increase) when the HIT &  RUN  is  called:  range  0  to  5
(higher  is  better). General hit & run ability takes into consideration
the batter's tendency to strike out. When the batter does miss the ball,
a HIT & RUN becomes a steal attempt. 

Season and Game Statistics -
batting average (AVG), slugging average (SLG), on-base-percentage (OBP),
games played (G), at bats (AB), runs (R), hits (H),  total  bases  (TB),
doubles  (2B),  triples  (3B),  home  runs  (HR),  runs-batted-in (RBI),
sacrafice hits or bunts (SH),  hit-by-pitch  (HP),  total  walks  (TBB),
strike outs (SO), stolen bases (SB), caught stealing (CS)

<Special ratings for pitchers>

Throws -
Pitching  arm  (Right/Left). A pitcher will perform better than his base
grade against a batter hitting from the same side as he  throws  if  the
batter has a platoon rating greater than 0. See platoon example.
