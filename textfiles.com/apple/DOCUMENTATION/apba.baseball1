- INTRODUCTION

APBA  Major  League Players Baseball puts you in the dugout as a manager
of your favorite baseball team! The game is intended to be played by two
players, each managing one team, but it can also be played by one player
managing both teams. With the draft disk, you can set up your own league
and organize teams, with players of your own choice. 

The game simulates much of the complex decision making that goes on in a
real baseball game. Before the game starts, you choose which  teams  you
want  to  manage, and then your starting line-ups. Once the game begins,
the defensive  manager  has  several  strategic  options  of  his  opwn.
Bringing  in  relievers,  pinch  hitting, intentional walks, hitting and
running are just a few of the strategic decisions to be made.  Sometimes
you  will  even  have to make quick base running and throwing decisions,
just like in the real game. 

- SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

To play APBA Major League Players Baseball you must have an Apple //c or
//e with 128K RAM and an 80-column card, two 5 1/4 floppy  disk  drives,

- RULE, TEAM AND LINE-UP SELECTION

Once BASEBALL  is  loaded,  you  can  start  playing  with  just  a  few
keystrokes. 

[Rules and Data Screen]

Using  [SHIFT]  [1],  choose  to  play  with a designated hitter (DH) or
without a designated hitter. Your choice is highlighted. The  DH  option
has  been  implemented  according to the Official Baseball Rules. If you
choose to play with a DH, certain  managerial  moves  may  nullify  your
right  to  use a DH (for example-announcing a defensive player at the DH
spot in the batting order after the game has begun). If you  attempt  to
make such a move, a warning will appear on your screen. 

Using  [SHIFT]  [2],  choose  the  length  of time available for dynamic
decisions - Professional (10 seconds), Semi-pro (15 seconds), or Amateur
(20 seconds). Your choice is highlighted. 

Using [SHIFT] [3], choose to play with or without sound. Your choice  is
highlighted. 

Using  [SHIFT]  [4],  choose the speed at which you wish the outcomes to
show Regular for dramatic play, Quick for "no pause" play. 

Using [SHIFT] [5], determine which Data Disk you have inserted. 

After using the shift keys to specify the rules, insert side  A  of  the
Data  Diskette,  press  [RETURN],  and  the  Team  Selection Screen will
appear. 

[Team Selection Screen]

Teams are arranged by organization, league, and division. The game comes
with 676 players organized by the leagues and cities in which they play.
You can play these teams immediately. To select  a  team,  follow  these
steps. 

1. Choose the organization you wish to play with by pressing [1] through
[6].   (Before  drafting  your own teams, you will have only one choice:
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL.) Your choice will be highlighted. 

2. Select a division using [A] through [L]. (Before  drafting  your  own
teams,  your  choices  are  [A], [B], [G], and [H].) Your choice will be
highlighted. The teams in this division will  appear  under  TEAMS  with
their won/lost records. 

3.  Select a team to play with using the up/down arrow keys. Your choice
will be highlighted. 

4. Indicate whether this team  is  the  home  or  visiting  team.  Press
[SHIFT]  [1]  to  choose  the  home  team  and [SHIFT] [2] to choose the
visiting team. 

5. Repeat these steps to choose a second team. 

6. When you have chosen two teams, press [RETURN]. Insert side B of  the
Data Diskette and press [RETURN] to continue. The Line-up Screen for the
visiting team will appear. 

Important  Notes: You may change your mind about which teams to play for
as long as you remain on the Team Selection Screen. Simply follow  steps
1-4  above.  Your new selection will replace the team you had previously
selected. 

To play teams from different years or Data Diskettes against each other,
load the first team following the  procedure  above,  then  switch  Data
Diskettes, press [SHIFT] [5], and load the second team. 

You  may play any team from any organization against any other team. You
may even play a team against itself. 

[The Line-up Screen]

The name and year of the team is in the upper  right  hand  corner.  The
line-up  will  be  displayed in the upper left of the screen. The roster
for the team appears in the lower half of the screen. 

On the roster, non-pitchers star at letter A and proceed down;  pitchers
start  at  letter Z and proceed up. Non-pitchers are displayed with last
name, primary position (Pos), fielding rating at that position (D),  the
side they bat from (B), and running speed (Sp). 

Pitchers  are  displayed  with  last  name, the arm they throw with (T),
pitching grade (always as a starter, if they started during  the  actual
season) (Gr), and control letters (Ctrl). Grades of relievers are marked
with an asterisk. 

See  THE  PLAYER  SCREEN for a further explanation of player performance
ratings. 

[Announcing a Line-up]

You  may  either  use  a  pre-stored   line-up   or   announce   players
individually. 

[Announcing a Prestored Line-up]

Space  has  been  provided  for  five  prestored  line-ups  in the upper
righthand corner of the screen. A frequently used line-up for each  team
is  provided  as  choice  1. After you have saved your own line-ups they
will also appear on the list. To load a prestored line-up: 

1. Press [L]. 

2. Select a number from [1] through [5]. 

Loading a line-up erases all previously announced players. 

The names of the players on the starting line-up are  displayed,followed
by  their  defensive position and fielding ratings. Totals are given for
team and infield fielding ratings. 

If a designated hitter (DH) was stored in the line-up and  you  are  not
now playing with the DH, the DH will be dropped from the line-up and the
pitcher,if  there  was  one, will appear batting ninth. If a DH does not
appear in the prestored line-up and you have chosen to  play  with  one,
the  pitcher,  if  there was one, will be moved out of the batting order
automatically,and you will need to select a DH. 

[Announcing Individual Players]

To help make line-up decisions, you  can  display  the  complete  player
statistics. 

1. Press [D]. 

2.  Press either [A]...[Z] or the batting number [1]...[9] of the player
to be studied. 

The Player Screen will appear. For a complete description of the  player
ratings, see THE PLAYER SCREEN section. 

[Adding a Player to the Line-up]

After  selecting a player to announce, follow the steps below to add him
to the line-up: 

1. Press [A] to start an announcement. 

2. Press [A]...[Z] to select the player. 

3. Press [1]...[9] (or [P] if you elected to use designated hitters)  to
select his place in the batting order. 

4.  Press [1]...[9] (or [D] if you elected to use designated hitters) to
select his defensive position. 

5. The selected player and his ratings will appear in  the  line-up  and
his name will be highlighted in the roster. 

6. Repeat this process until you have a valid defensive line-up. 

[Correcting a Line-up]

Check the line-up to make sure it is the one you want. If the line-up is
incorrect,  press  [R] for Remove followed by [1]...[9] or [P] to remove
the  incorrect  player.  Announce  the  correct  player  in  the  vacant
position. 

BASEBALL  will  tell you if your line-up is invalid. Examples of invalid
line-ups: you have entered two players at the  same  position;  you  are
missing  a player; you have an ejected or injured player in the line-up;
you have not designated a defensive position for a pinch hitter, a pinch
runner, or his  replacement.  If  your  line-up  is  invalid,  make  the
correction as described above. 

After  you have corrected an invalid line-up, if there is still a player
marked with an asterisk, you must [M] Move that  player  to  his  proper
defensive  position to finish validating the line-up, even if it appears
that he's already there. You may also use the [M] Move command to change
the  defensive  position  of  a  player  without  changing  his  line-up
position. 

Before  finalizing  your  line-up,  you  may make as many changes as you
want. 

[Saving a Line-up]

1. Press [S]. 

2. Press [1]..[5] to choose the line-up  number.  If  a  lineup  already
exists at that position, the new line-up will replace the old line-up. 

3. Enter a name for the line-up. 

4. Press [RETURN]. 

This  line-up  will  be  saved to the data diskette. You will be able to
load this line-up with the [L] Load command in the future. 

Important note: [ESC] lets you back out of any incomplete command. 

[Completing the Line-ups]

Announce a  line-up  for  each  team.  When  you  press  [RETURN]  after
announcing  the  second  line-up, you are prompted to insert the Play By
Play diskette.  Insert thid disk, press [RETURN], and  the  Game  Screen
will appear. 

- PLAYING THE GAME

[The Game Screen]

The  top  part  of  the  Game Screen displays the two line-ups, the line
score with run, hit, and error totals, the inning, count, and number  of
outs, and a description of each play as it occurs. The current batter is
highlighted  and  after  the  first inning the lead-off batter is marked
with an asterisk. 

To the left of the "INN," on the same line, is a space reserved  for  up
to two scorer messages. The messages and their meanings are: 
     
     E1...E9 - Error on the defensive player indicated
     WP      - Wild pitch
     PB      - Passed ball
     SAC     - Sacrafice bunt or fly
     FC      - Fielder's choice

On   some   complex  plays,  further  scoring  messages  appear  in  the
description of the play. 

The lower part of the Game Screen displays the  diamond,  the  defensive
alignment,  the  current  batter (on the appropriate side of the plate),
and base runners with their running speed. You will also  see  the  base
running  results  of  each play, partial game statistics for the current
pitcher (innings pitched, hits, earned runs, walks  (BB),  strike-outs),
partial  game  statistics  for  the current batter (at bats, runs, hits,
RBI), the pitch, bat, and time-out indicators,  and  slected  managerial
calls when in effect (IN, STRETCH, HOLD, HIT & RUN). 

Important  note:  A  HOME  RUN  graphic  will  flash  repeatedly  on the
scoreboard after a home run  is  hit.  You  can  stop  the  flashing  by
pressing any key. 

Below or next to each defensive player's name are one or more ratings: 

For all defensive players: 
The  first  number  is  the  fielding  rating  for  that  player at that
position. 

For the pitcher: 
The arm he throws  with  (R-right,  L-left)  and  his  current  pitching
grade. 

For the catcher: 
His throwing arm rating for steal attempts. 

For outfielders: 
Their arm ratings. 

For offensive players you will find: 

For the batter: 
His batting type and platoon factor. 

For base runners: 
Their base speed ratings. 

See  THE  PLAYER  SCREEN for complete explanations of player performance
ratings. 

[Managerial Decisions]

APBA Baseball can be a game of managerial coaching  decisions.  Choosing
the  team  and the line-up are only the first of these decisions. As you
play the game, the following options are availible to you: 

<Options for the defensive manager> <Team in field>

Before [P] Pitch: 

[H] Hold -
With a runner at first base, holding him on slows  the  runner  somewhat
for stealing and base advancement and provides the chance for him to get
picked  off.  Of  course,  with  the first baseman nearer the bag, it is
easier to hit through the right side. Holding  on  is  automatically  in
effect  if  there  is a runner on first and no one on second, unless the
defensive manager turns it off by pressing  [H].   Press  [H]  again  to
reinstate HOLD. 

[I] In -
With  a  runner  at  third  base,  press  [I]  draws  the infield in and
increases the chance of the play being made at home on  a  ground  ball.
If  you  play IN, though, more ground balls will get through the infield
for hits. IN must be called before each pitch to remain in effect. 

[S] Stretch -
With a runner at third base, pressing [S] causes the  pitcher  to  pitch
from the stretch rather than from a full wind up. In all base situations
except  men  on  first and third, pitching from the stretch will prevent
the runner on third from stealing home, but the pitcher will be a little
but less effective against the batter. With runners on first and  third,
the pitcher must pitch from the STRETCH. 

[1]...[9] -
Either  manager  can  display  the  statistics for a defensive player by
pressing the number of his defensive position: [1] pitcher, [2] catcher,
[3] first basement, [4] second baseman, [5] third baseman [6] shortstop,
[7] left fielder, [8] center fielder, [9] right fielder.  See THE PLAYER
SCREEN for a description of player statistics. 

[B] Batter -
Either manager  can  display  complete  statistics  for  the  batter  by
pressing [B]. 

[SHIFT] [1]...[SHIFT] [3] -
Either  manager can display complete statistics for a base runner. Press
[SHIFT] [1] for the runner on first base, [SHIFT] [2] for the runner  on
second base, and [SHIFT] [3] for the runner on third base. 

[CONTROL] [D] -
Allow  defensive  substitution.  See  DEFENSIVE SUBSTITUTIONS MOVES, and
RELIEF PITCHING. 

[CONTROL] [R] -
Either manager can call up an instant replay by pressing

[CONTROL] [R] -
If the play went more than size lines,  press  [CONTROL]  [R]  again  to
continue the play. 

[CONTROL] [Q] -
Toggles  the Quick Play option. Quick Play speeds up the presentation of
outcomes,  but  it  does  not  affect  the  time  allowed  for   dynamic
decisions. 

[W] Walk -
Press [W] to intentionally walk the batter. 

[P] Pitch -
Press [P] to pitch the ball. 

After [P] Pitch: 
No defensive commands are allowed after the pitch. 

<Options for the offensive manager>
<Team at bat>

Before [P] Pitch: 

[1]...[9] -
Display  defensive  player's  statistics  by  positions  (see  defensive
options). 

[B] Batter -
Display batter's statistics (see defensive options). 

[SHIFT] [1]...[SHIFT] [3] -
Display base runner's statistcs (see defensive options). 

[CONTROL] [O] -
Allows an offensive substitution, ie., inserting  the  pinch  hitter  or
pinch runner. See PINCH HITTING AND PINCH RUNNING. 

[CONTROL] [R] -
Instant replay (see defensive options). 

[CONTROL] [Q] -
Toggles the Quick Play option (see defensive options).
