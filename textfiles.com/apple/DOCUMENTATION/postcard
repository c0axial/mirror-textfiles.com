                          POSTCARDS (Activision)

           -  TURN YOUR COMPUTER INTO A WACKY POSTCARD MAKER  -


You've probably used your Apple GS computer for a lot of different things. For
work or homework.  For organizing home business information.  For games. Maybe
even for creating other types of letters or cards.  But you've probably never
used your micro to create anything as wacky (and fun!) as the kinds of things
you'll create with POSTCARDS.

POSTCARDS gives you everything you need to create you own original, far-out
postcards.  For starters, you get the craziest assortment of creative clipart
ever compiled.  There's a bikini-clad warthog.  A platypus. A UFO. The Mona
Lisa.  Insects of all sizes and scariness.  And scads more.

Then, you get a wide array of postcard backgrounds.  Like a beach, farm, desert,
cityscape, and even a moonscape.  So you can mix and match the most ridiculously
unique combinations.

Put a one-eyed, three-antennaed alien at a busy downtown penguin crossing. Or
show a giant tarantula crawling out from behind an erupting volcano. There are
thousands of possible possibilities.

Plus, POSTCARDS comes with catchy captions as well as clipart alphabets, for
your own writing.  It only takes about five minutes to make your first postcard.


                   SIX EASY STEPS TO MAKING A POSTCARD


Utilizing a GS paint program , like PaintWorks Plus, its as easy as cut, paste,
and print.

1. PICK OUT THE SCENE.  Open the SCENE1 file and, using the SAVE AS command,
give it a new name, like BIRTHDAY, and save it on your work disk.  Then CLOSE
the file.

2. PICK OUT THE ART.  Open the PEOPLE2 file.  Use the lasso with the COPY
command to select the guy in the Hawaiian shirt, or any other image, to put on
your postcard.  Then CLOSE the file.

3. PLACE THE ART.  Open your BIRTHDAY (or whatever name you used) file. Using
the PASTE command, position your guy in the Hawaiian shirt in the bottom right
hand cornor of the beach.  The CLOSE and SAVE your file.

4. PICK OUT A MESSAGE.  Open the LETTERS file.  Use the lasso with the COPY
command to select "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" and place it on your postcard as described in
steps 2 and 3 above.

5. PRINT.  Just click on your PRINT command.

6. CUT AND GLUE TO CARD STOCK.  Loosely cut out your postcard and glue it to a
standard US Postcard.  Blank stock can be purchased from Activision.
