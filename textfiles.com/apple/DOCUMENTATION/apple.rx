                     Documentation for Apple.Rx
                     --------------------------
 
 This program requires an Apple IIgs or an enhanced //e or //c WITH
 a 65802 or 65816 microprocessor.  A 65802 chip can be bought for
 around $20 and can easily be inserted in place of the 65C02 in the
 latter two machines.
 
                            ---------
 
 This program is "virus medicine".  It will read your system files
 (and any other types you specify) and create a data file that
 contains information on these files.  At any time, you can run it
 in check mode and it will report any of these files that have been
 altered.  For obvious reasons, I am not going to detail exactly what
 sort of data the program saves, but suffice it to say that it is
 virtually impossible to change any of these files without detection
 by this program and it would also be very difficult to either alter
 this program or the data file it creates without detection.
 
 The program makes an effort to protect itself and its data file from
 modification.  It encrypts itself and resaves itself whenever it is
 used to write a new data file.  However, despite these safeguards,
 the safest way to use it is to keep this program and its data file
 on a separate dedicated 3.5" disk, which you use only for running
 this program.
 
 THE PROGRAM NAME
 
 If you do not keep this program on a separate dedicated disk then
 you should change its name, so that a viral program specifically
 looking for this program cannot easily find it and modify it.
 
 THE DATA FILE
 
 The name of the data file defaults to RX.FILE.  This name is kept
 in the STARTUP position of the program.  If not kept on a dedicated
 disk, then its name too should be changed using BLOCK.WARDEN from
 ProSel.  Unless you give it a full pathname, it will be kept on the
 same disk as the program.
 
 THE VOLUME NAME
 
 The program must be told what volume to check.  This defaults to
 /HARD1, but this can be changed via the Change defaults function in
 the program.
 
 FILES CHECKED
 
 The program has two means of deciding which files to check.  (Ordinarily,
 pure data files need not be checked, only programs.)  The first way it
 decides whether to check a file is by a list of file types it keeps.
 It will check all files whose file type is in this list.  The list
 presently contains only SYS (type $FF) and S16 (type $B3) types.  You
 should add the NDA, CDA and TOL types ($B8, B9 and BA) and the tool setup
 type $B6.  There is an option in the program for modifying this list.  For
 example, you could add type $06 for BIN files, or type $FC for BAS files.
 Since many BIN files are data files, however, it is probably best to use
 the second option for them.
 
 The second way it decides is by a list of "special files".  This list
 presently contains the file PROSEL.  Again, there is an option in the
 program for adding to and deleting from this list.  Note that if you
 have a file name in this list and the file cannot be found, then a
 program error will be reported and the program will abort.  In such a
 case, you must remove that file name from the list.
 
 It is suggested that you either add the type $F1 to cover the CD.EXT
 file, or add that file to the name list.
 
 Whenever you add a program file to your system, you should run Apple.Rx
 in check mode to make sure things are now ok, and then rerun it in
 Create mode to revise the data file to include the new program file.
 
 You should run this program in check mode at frequent intervals, perhaps
 every day, to quickly determine if a problem exists before it has a
 chance to spread further.  In particular it is a good idea to run a
 check before backing up a hard disk.
 
 PASSWORD
 
 To protect itself somewhat, the program requires a password when you
 enter it.  The initial password is APPLEAPPLEAPPLE (passwords are not
 case sensitive) and one of the first things you should do is to change
 it with the built in facility to do that.  A password must be at least
 12 characters long, and when it is changed the program will encrypt
 most of itself and resave itself to disk.  After that point you MUST
 remember your password.  Recreation of the password from the encrypted
 file is virtually impossible unless you have the facilities of the CIA.
 It is in the nature of the encryption that even knowing the encryption
 algorithm, and having both encrypted and decrypted files at one's
 disposal will not, without gargantuan effort, yield the password that
 was used to drive the encryption.  You can change the password any
 time you want, but you must know the old password to access the program
 in order to make that change.
 
 Some functions, including changing the password, are disabled and
 payment of the shareware fee will bring enabling instructions.
 
 WHAT THE PROGRAM CANNOT DO
 
 The program only checks that files have not been changed (by a virus
 or whatever).  It cannot prevent damage by a program that does not
 change other files; for example, a program that just starts erasing
 a disk at a certain date.  Only well kept backups can protect from
 that.  Even backups cannot protect against a virus that invades other
 programs, however, and that is the purpose of this utility.
 
 DISEASE PREVENTION
 
 Nothing can be 100% protection against viruses.  You should practice
 diligence and prevention.  Do not ever download (and use) a program
 from a pirate board.  (I can imagine and understand a software
 publisher uploading an infected program onto such boards, in sheer
 retribution.)  Never use, in a susceptible environment (such as a
 hard disk), any program downloaded by or otherwise received from
 someone you do not know or in whom you do not have confidence.
 
 COPYRIGHT
 
 This program is copyrighted 1988 by Glen Bredon.  It is expressly
 forbidden to give this program to anyone else or to upload it to any
 bulletin board.  If the program was not uploaded by me to a major
 service then you should not use it.  These restrictions are to make
 it more difficult for a look-alike contaminated program to be
 distributed.
 
 The program is SHAREWARE for $20.  When you pay your fee, you should
 indicate where you got the program, so I can warn you if it is not
 legitimate.  (Of course, this notice is unlikely to appear in a
 non-legitimate copy.)

 Glen:
 
 ____  Enclosed is my check for $20 in payment for Apple.Rx.  I obtained
 
 the program from:  Compuserve
 
  (or)
 
 ____  Enclosed is my check for $25, for which please send me the Apple.Rx
 program on a 5.25" disk.  I understand that you will not distribute the
 program in this manner during the months of June, July and August.
 
 
 I understand that the payment entitles me to receive instructions on how
 to enable the disabled functions, and to receive a warning if my source
 for the program is not legitimate, and that I may download any future
 updates from the same source with no further payment, or obtain a revision
 from you for a P&H fee of $5.  I further understand that it is not possible
 to have 100% sure protection against software viruses and that no such
 implied warrantee is given.  I agree to abide by the copyright and to not
 distribute any copies of the program to other people or services.
