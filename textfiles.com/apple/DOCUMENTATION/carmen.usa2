                 loss is crime's gain.  She'll have to take out her

Wendy Pauper: Half-time madness!  Wendy and the lead guitarist from Reeking
              Sewage tear things up at the stadium.

     Great addition to the team! Recruited her 8/15 from a club on the
     outskirts of Cleveland.  Cooks great chicken creole.

     She never misses a Miami Dolphins game!  (The team even gave her own
     helmet.)  Tood bad it'll cover her gorgeous red hair . . .

           Lost again in the lottery!  Next time we pull a job in Vegas,
           I'm going to show her the ropes.



Alexander Graham Edison: Alexander engaged in his (and my) favorite
                         sport (basketball).

     Notes: This blushing brown-haired beauty was a lineman laid off by the
            local phone company when I met him in a we-never-close fried
            chicken bar.  He was planning to use his training to becaome a
            freelance gene splicer until I convinced him to sign up with
            V.I.L.E.



Benjamin Hana: The chef picks his "menu" for tomorrow with a little help from
               a "friend". (Just horsing around, of course.)

     Jet black hair (just like mine!), impish grin, cute little ears, and
     cooks a terrific shrimp creole.  So glad we met when we did.

     Employment history:
       Martial arts instructor
       Goalie for Calgary Flames
       Backup guitar man at the Palomino Western Bar

         Benjamin's Folly! (betting on horses)

         asparagus, not horses.
