                     WARRIORS OF RAS
                        VOLUME II

SAVING/RESTORING GAMES & CHARACTERS

TO  SAVE A GAME IN PROGRESS, TYPE THE COMMAND SAVE.  YOU WILL BE ASKED
IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE GAME (G) OR ONLY THE CHARACTER (C).  YOU MIGHT
WANT TO SAVE ONLY THE CHARACTER  SO  THAT  IT  COULD  BE  LOADED  INTO
ANOTHER WARRIOR OF RAS GAME, SUCH AS DUNZHIN OR WYLDE. 

CHOOSE  A  #  FROM  1 TO 5: THAT IS THE NUMBER YOU WILL USE TO RESTORE
THAT GAME OR CHARACTER. 

TO RESTORE, SIMPLY FOLLOW THE PROMPTS WHEN YOU BOOT THE DISK. 


BEGINNING THE ADVENTURE

THE FIRST THING YOU WILL WANT TO DO IS (B)UY SUPPLIES. YOU  START  OUT
WITH  2000  SILVER  COINS  (OR,  IF PLAYING AN OLD CHARACTER, WHATEVER
TREASURER YOU HAVE COLLECTED). FOR 1800 SILVER COINS  YOU  VAN  BUY  A
"STANDARD  PACK",  WHICH  CONSISTS  OF  A  SUIT  OF  CHAIN MAIL, THREE
ORDINARY SWORDS, 10 TORCHES, 15 MEALS  WORTH  OF  FOOD  AND  WATER,  A
CROSS,  A  FLINT & STEEL, THREE ROPES, TWO DIRKS, A PICK AND A MIRROR.
TO BUY THIS, ENTER A "@" INSTEAD OF AN ITEM NUMBER. 

THE (S)TASH AND (R)ETRIEVE COMMANDS ARE USED TO SAFELY STORE TREASURE.
SINCE EVERY POUND YOU CARRY SLOWS YOU DOWN, IT IS IMPORTANT  TO  LEAVE
BEHIND TREASURE THAT YOU DON'T NEED. 

(E)NTER THE KAIV, WHEN YOU ARE READY.  THE OBJECT OF KAIV IS TO FIND A
GREAT TREASURE, SOMEWHERE IN ITS FARTHEST REACHES.
