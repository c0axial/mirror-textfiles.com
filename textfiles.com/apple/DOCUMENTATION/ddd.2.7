                 Disk Disintegrator Version 2.7 Release Notes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Features:
------------
     FORMAT:  A new format option now supports 35, 36, and 40 track disks.  The
       40 track option frees up 608 sectors, but will only work correctly on
       Non-Apple drives.  Most Apple drives do, however, support the 36 track
       option which formats 544 sectors.  If those two fail (I/O Errors) then
       you can use either of the 35 track formats.  The first of these formats
       a disk with the standard 528 sectors, while the second formats a 528
       sector disk, but uses 14 sectors usually allocated to the catalog,
       giving you 542 sectors.  The second format only allows you 7 filenames
       on the disk.

     DELETE:  This option is selected from the main menu, and simply lets you
       delete files.  You will be prompted for source or target, and then can
       select the files to delete with the lightbar.  Press <ESC> when you are
       done.

     FASTLOADER:  DDD 2.7 is now equipped with a fastloader and reads itself in
       much faster than the old version.  This loader will work in Diversi-DOS,

       Standard DOS 3.3, Sider DOS, and probably all other versions of DOS 3.3
       avaliable.

     FILETYPE:  To make ProDOS conversions of packed files easier, DDD 2.7 now
       writes its object file to disk as an "R" filetype (Relocatable).  This
       originally appeared in The Screamer's DDD 2.5R, and was done in good
       taste, and for a good reason.

Apology:
-------
     We would like to apologize for the little bit of protection added to the
code for DDD.  The reason for adding this protection is all the people with
sector editors who think releasing a new version of a program means changing
the version number and names on the title page.
     If you want to make any modifications to DDD, contact Radioactive Snail
or Data Latch on the Last Dimension and we will see about getting you the
source code so you can do it right.
