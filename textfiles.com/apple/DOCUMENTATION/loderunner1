               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Descend the left ladder and draw the men to the bottom right before
they get any chests. 

2]  Dig  down the column of bricks next to the ladder slow enough that
the top brick has reappeared when  the  bottom  brick  has  been  dug.
Quickly  run  up  the  ladder  to the top of the column and across the
steps for the closest of the two lower chests.  When you fall  to  the
bottom,  quickly  run  out  before  the  bottom  brick  of  the column
reappears. 

3] Climb the ladder halfway, then lure the men into the  trap  at  the
bottom.   Move  them  all  the  way to the left by descending the left
ladder again.  Then cross over to the right and repeat Step 2. If  you
move  quickly,  you'll  fall  to the ground with the second chest just
before the men reach you. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *        LEVEL 2: MUSIC MAESTRO       *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Keep all the men together! 

1] Move to the top right corner. 4 men will proceed up  and  left  and
the  5th  will  climb toward you. Just as he approaches, move left. As
soon as he's near you, drop to the bottom, run right and up the ladder
to a spot that makes him run left. 

2] Stay high to draw all the men to the top left. Collect  the  chests
from the right side and bottom. 

3]  Draw  all  the  men that are on the bottom to the right side, then
up. 

4] Go left and down, moving to the left ladder to keep all  5  men  on
the right side. Now clear the left side.

               *       LEVEL 3: LADDERS GALORE       *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Move left, under the first man and over the next. 

2] Lure the men individually into the one place on the board where you
can dig and get rid of them one at a time. 

3] Collect all remaining chests. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *         LEVEL 4: DROL HOLE          *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1]  Use  your  position on the ladders to move the men left and right,
dropping each man past and  below  you  through  then  center  channel
before moving up to the next level. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *      LEVEL 5: FOUR IS COMPANY       *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1]  Trap  the  men at the bottom center by moving to the bottom of the
far left ladder. 

2] Run over their heads and get all the chests on the right (the fifth
chest from the right has a trap door under it). 

3] Dig away all the bricks to the left of the  men,  letting  one  man
free. 

4] Dig a hole to the left of the man and walk over his head while he's
in it, and force him to the right by positioning yourself at the right
spot on the ladder. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *          LEVEL 6: THE U.N.          *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Get the men into strategic "U's" and walk over their heads. 

1]  Climb  either  ladder and position yourself at the top so that the
men fall into the "U's". 

2] Using their heads to stand on, dig and release them  after  getting
the  chests.  They  will  drop into other "U's" and you can repeat the
action. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *       LEVEL 7: PYRAMID TRAPS        *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Clear the inner pyramid by forcing the men to drop through the  top
middle bricks into the right and left "U's" underneath. 

2]  Drop  down  after them, get the chests and then release the men to
the next left and right "U's" below them. 

3] Repeat this for all areas. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *      LEVEL 8: EIGHT WAS GREAT       *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Go up the ladder toward the left hand corner of the screen.  You'll
have  to  duck into one of the diagonal channels and dig to get by one
of the men. 

2] Pick up all the chests across the top, dropping  from  diagonal  to
diagonal by blasting through the bricks. 

3]  Descend  a  diagonal  to  the  lower left corner and make your way
across the bottom  in  the  same  manner,  picking  up  the  remaining
chests. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *         LEVEL 9: ARROWHEAD          *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Clear the center arrowhead chests first and trap the men in the area. 

1]  First, dig a hole in floor above the point of the arrowhead (point
X).  Collect the chests that appear at the center of the arrowhead. 

2] Collect as many chests around the arrowhead by digging  from  point
'X' and circling back. 

3]  Go  to  either the bottom right or left of the triangle of ladders
above the arrowhead and dig a hole.  Get a man to chase you to the top
of the pyramid. At this point dig, trap the man, climb down the  first
ladder  on  the  other  side of the pyramid, and he'll eventually drop
into the bottom center. 

4] After all men are trapped, collect the chests. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *            LEVEL 10: TEN            *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Don't fall to  the  bottom.  Step  right  as  you  pass  the  first
opening. 

2]  Go  up  the  first ladder and to the top of the first section. Dig
your way to the gold chests in the first section in two passes. 

3] Climb up the middle ladders and get the chests. 

4] The far right section is a matter of timing. At  the  bottom  right
ladder,  dig  the  top  brick,  hesitate,  the  next  brick  under it,
hesitate, the next brick...as soon as you see the top  brick  forming,
run  across the top right to last right brick, dig, drop through, grab
the chest and run through the left hole before the bottom brick forms.
Repeat procedure for the left side of the ladder. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *      LEVEL 11: CHAIN REACTION       *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] To get to the second and third boxes on either side of the  screen,
you must cross over a falling man's head from the ladder. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *        LEVEL 12: CROSS YOUR T       *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Go to the far right & up the ladder. 

2]  The  first, third and fifth cross on on the top row are traps. Get
the men to fall in them. 

3] Get the last two men together & make them follow you  in  a  circle
while you collect the rest of the chests. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *          LEVEL 13: MAZOLIA          *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Get the men to bring the chests to you! 

1] Collect the chests that aren't near the men. 

2]  Manipulate the men by moving up and down in the center part of the
maze.  Get by the leftmost man into the lower central portion  of  the
board. 

3]  Continue  to  manipulate the men from this area as you collect the
chests. 

4] To get the leftmost man to part with his chest in the right  place,
draw  him to the fifth floor on the right and stand at the left of the
third ladder. When he's almost upon you, race up the third ladder  and
he'll  race  up  the second ladder. He may drop the chest in the space
between the two ladders. Race down, collect the chest & race  back  up
the ladder. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *       LEVEL 14: NEW YORK CITY       *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

There's no specific strategy for this level except that by keeping the
men  together  you  have a better chance of controlling and getting by
them. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *       LEVEL 15: MAGICAL GOLD        *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

Get the far right chest left. 

1] Collect all chests across the top except the far right one. 

2] Let the rightmost man out of the hole that he's fallen into and get
any chest that may appear. 

3] Manipulate as many men as needed to the bottom left  of  the  board
and use their heads to climb the far left ladder. 

4] Get the last chest. 

               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*
               *      LEVEL 16: RUNAROUND QUILT      *
               */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*

1] Collect some chests from the upper right side of the board. 

2]  Stay  high  on the board to attract the men. Then, go down and dig
from the second floor from the bottom on the far right ladder and down
the 'steps of bricks' to the bottom row of ladders...cross to the left
side of the board. Run in circles to avoid the men. 

3] Get a man  to  fall  into  the  hole  bottom  hole  in  the  center
'circle'.   Collect  the chests in the middle and get the other men to
fall in to get them out of the way. 

4] Collect the rest of the chests.
