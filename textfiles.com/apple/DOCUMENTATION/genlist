GenericList v1.0 Documentation
------------------------------

GenericList is a quick and dirty GS/OS shell program for
listing text and source files. Rather than loading your
clumsy editor or using the aggravating type command from the
APW/ORCA shell, use GenericList!

Features: GenericList is a clean and to the point program
which will load a text file and display it. You can scroll
up and down, left and right, at very high speed. It can be
installed as a shell utility in the APW/ORCA shells.

Why did I write this? I've used an MS-DOS (I know, I know)
machine for a while now for telecommunications. I buffered
my sessions to disk, and viewed them later with a small
program called "l". In the spirit of "l", and the need I had
to continually view files and the desire not to load up
MaxEdit to view one file, GenericList was born. (I also
needed something to do after I cleaned my room up this
afternoon).

GenericList is Copyright 1991 by ventureTech. I ask you give
this to EVERYONE YOU KNOW. I won't ask for any money, though
I will gladly accept some. What I do ask is that whether or
not you like the program or will continue to use it that you
send me a note saying that you've tried it. My addresses
(email and otherwise) are at the bottom of this file. If you
could also tell me where you got it from, it would be
appreciated as well.

Installing GenericList:
-----------------------
GenericList consists of one EXE file (GS/OS Shell
Executable) that can be run from anywhere. If you are
installing it in an ORCA/APW system, copy it to your
UTILITIES directory. Then edit your SYSTEM/SYSCMNDS file and
add the following line:
L               *U                 List Utility
That way, when APW/ORCA is loaded, L becomes available from
any directory.

Using GenericList:
------------------
Type "L FILENAME" where filename is any valid GS/OS path to
a valid text file. Valid files include SRC and TXT files.
Sorry, AppleWorks and other word processor formats are not
supported.
Once loaded, you should see two numbers at the top left. The
left number indicates what line you are on, the right
indicates how many lines are in the document.

To scroll up by one line: Press the left arrow key.
To scroll down by one line: Press the right arrow key.
To scroll up by one screen: Press the up arrow key.
To scroll down by one screen: Press the down arrow key.
To scroll right by one column: Press the "." key.
To scroll left by one column: Press the "," key.
To quit GenericList: Press space bar or ESC.

About the Program:
------------------
You may notice that the source code has been included for
your viewing pleasure. I emphasize viewing, as you probably
won't be able to compile it yourself. GenericList uses many
routines from the TextTool Kit from 360 MicroSystems. (more
on 360 MicroSystems later). The program is small, and the
source code is reasonably well documented. Note: I am not a
classical "C" programmer! I have very BAD habits, which are
ingrained into me from years of AppleSoft BASIC, Turing (I
vow to torture Hume and Holt), and recently HyperTalk.
There are some limitations to this program that you may run
across. If you load a file that is larger than your memory
size, unpredictable results may occur. I have no idea what
might happen to your computer. Use caution with big files as
the file is completely loaded into the IIgs memory before
being displayed.

About the Author:
-----------------
Matthew Montano is some strange, live by night programmer
who works on a variety of projects. Recent IIgs projects
include GenericComm v2.0 and several niche market Plus
applications (a HyperCard compatible system form IBM's and
Macs). GenericComm 2.1 or v3.0 (I haven't decided what
version # to give it) is almost done and WILL include
Xmodem/Xmodem-1k/Xmodem-4k upload and download abilities.
Also recently finished are several programmers utilities for
adding quick and dirty help screens to programs. Although my
use of computers ranges across MANY platforms, I still have
one favorite, the Apple IIgs. I simply enjoy using it and
will continue to do little things like this as long as I
continue to enjoy using it.

The Future of GenericList:
--------------------------
I will add, very shortly a "search ability" so you can
quickly search a text file for a string of text. I will also
make this available from the finder by changing the filetype
to s16 and adding code to handle MessageByName messages that
pass GenericList a filename. There will also be a command
that will take all long line (>80) and wrap them to a single
screen. Hopefully within a few weeks I'll get to it.

About 360 MicroSystems TextTool Kit:
------------------------------------
The TextTool Kit is a library of routines accessible from
"C", Assembler and Pascal ORCA/APW languages. It provides an
incredible list of routines for managing text files,
windows, mice, text ports, pull down menus, menu-lists,
direct screen writes and buttons and controls. They are very
well debugged (I only found two, and once notified, they
were corrected promptly by 360 MicroSystems). Even with the
advent of Apple's fantastic GUI based tools, I still believe
there is a place for text based tools and programs.
GenericList and GenericComm I think are two righteous
programs. As well, 360 MicroSystems has developed and is
selling MAXEdit, simply the best editor ever written for the
IIgs. For the price it is being offered for, you cannot go
wrong. I do NOT work for 360 MicroSystems but have spent
just over a $100US with them and am VERY satisfied with the
support and products they develop and offer.
