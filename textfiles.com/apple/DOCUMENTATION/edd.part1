ESSENTIAL DATA DUPLICATOR (EDD) PROGRAM LIST #3-8 BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE

Pardon all the typing errors

What is an Essential Data Duplicator Program Information List???  This is a list
of copy-protected programs which Edd has been known to copy.  This list  would
contain the program name, the publishers name, and all known instruction for
making back up copies.  We compile this list from information gathered from EDD
owners all around the world.

FINDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR COPING DISKS:

First of all ... note: if you are backing up Apple III software, remember to
always use one of the synchronize track processing modes; mode#2, #5, #6.   If
you are using a IIe or IIc, the CAPS LOCK key must be in the DOWN position for
EDD to run properly. This list is divided into two sections; Programs listed by
name and Protection used by companies.

The "Programs listed by name" section is an alphabetical order listing of
protected programs by program name.  To the right of each name, references the
software company in the "Protections Used By The Company" sections to  actually
find information for copying that disk.

Since many software companies will use the same protection on all or most of
their disks, if the name of the disk you are trying to copy is not located in
the "Programs Listed By Name" section, try locating the company who publishes
that disk in the "Protections Used By Company" section of the list.  You have  a
very good chance that one of the instructions will work for that particular
disk.

Here is an example for using this list to find the instructions for a disk.
Suppose you want to make a back up copy of the disk named, "MICRO COURIER".
First, look up MICRO COURIER in the "Programs Listed By Name" section of the
list.  It says, "MICRO COURIER:MICA#a".  This tell us that the protection used
on this disk is "MICA#a".  Now we look up "MICA" in the "Protections Used By
Company" section of the list.  This shows that we used the abbreviation "MICA"
for the company "MICROCOM INC." (who is the publisher for this disk).  Since we
know that the protection used is protection "#a"; locate protection #a for this
company.  Here we find instructions for copying this disk:

a.  t22
    t0-t23 parm 28=3

HOW TO USE THE INSTRUCTION FOUND IN THE LIST:

To make a back up copy of a program found in the list, you will need to know the
coding used:

            key:    t   = TRACK START and/or END
            inc   inc   = INCREMENT TRACK value
            parm  mode# = PROCESS MODE#
            normal      = NORMAL; default values (push Return for all prompts

Here is an example:  Let's say you want to copy a program with the instruction

              t0-t23

To copy this disk you will need to copy the range of tracks from track "0"
through track "23".  So, when copying the disk, enter the value "0" when EDD ask
you for the START TRACK (it's already preset to "0"), and enter the  value "23"
when EDD asks for the END TRACK.  Since the instructions don't tell you to
change anything else, don't.  Simply just press Return for all prompts.

Here is an more involved instruction example:

             t0 parm 28=1
             t1-t9 inc 4
              tA-t22

mode#2 You will notice these instructions use three lines of information. Since
there are three lines to this instruction and each line starts with a "t"
(track) this means that there are three ranges of tracks to copy on this disk.
The  first range, "t0 parm 28=1" means that you will need to change the
parameter  "28" to the value of "1" (see OPTION 2).  After the parameter is
changed (any parameters that need to be changed for a range of tracks are always
changed first), enter a "0" for the START TRACK. Since "t0" (track 0) is the
only track specified, you will also need to enter it for the END TRACK. There is
no additional information for this range, so, just press return for  all other
prompts.  After EDD is done processing track "0", EDD will say  "process done".
At this point, one range of tracks has been copied.  The  second range of tracks
says, "t1-t9 inc 4". Enter the value "1" for the START TRACK, and a "9" for the
END TRACK.  When EDD asks you for the INC TRACK value enter a "4".  After you
copy this second range of tracks, EDD will again say "process done". The third
range of tracks, "tA-t22 mode#2" is the last range  that needs to be copied.
Enter an "A" when EDD asks for the START TRACK, and a "22" for the END TRACK.
When EDD asks for the PROCESS MODE, enter a "2" (synchronize tracks mode).

NOTE: You MUST copy the ranges of tracks in the order they are listed. One
reason for this is because any parameter that may have been changed for a
previously copied range of tracks stays changed for the next range. If the list
tells you to "write-protect before running", be sure you put a write- protect
sticker on the duplicate disk covering the notch, BEFORE attempting  booting
that disk! A good rule of thumb is: If an original disk has a write- protect
sticker on it, always put a sticker on the duplicate disk before  running it.
Disk drive speed can be very critical on some disks.
