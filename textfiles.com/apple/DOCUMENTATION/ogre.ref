                              TO BEGIN PLAYING OGRE
                              ---------------------

1.   Place  the  OGRE disk, label side up, in the disk drive and turn on
the power. 

2.  Once past the title page, a dialogue box will prompt for the type of
input device:  K-keyboard, M-mouse, or J-joystick.  The options may vary
depending on what input devices are installed.  The  desired  device  is
selected by pressing the appropriate key.  In addition, the joystick can
be selected by moving it or pressing its button. 

3.   OGRE  will  start  in  the  Field Editor, from where the player can
either continue a previously saved game or start a new game. 

OGRE CONTROL
------------

Making Choices.  Choices are  made  in  OGRE  through  the  use  of  the
pointer,  a  black,  triangular  object  that can be moved around with a
mouse, joystick or keyboard.  A mouse  (if  available)  or  joystick  is
highly recommended for playing OGRE. 
 OGRE  can  be  played  using  the  keyboard  to move the pointer and to
simulate 'clicking' or pressing a button, or it can be  played  entirely
with  'pointing',  'clicking' and 'dragging' techniques using a mouse or
joystick. 

Clicking.  Some selections in OGRE are made by first moving the  pointer
to the desired object or option, then pressing and quickly releasing the
button.   This  is  referred  to  as  clicking.   When  playing with the
keyboard, typing RETURN will simulate pressing or releasing the button. 

Dragging.   Another  method  of  designating  choices  is  by  dragging.
Dragging  is accomplished by placing the pointer over the desired object
then pressing and holding the button while moving the pointer to another
location.  Releasing the button completes the  drag.   If  playing  with
keyboard  control,  typing RETURN will simulate holding the button down.
When the pointer is in the desired location, typing  RETURN  again  will
release the button and complete the drag. 

Pulling  down the Menu.  In the upper right corner of the screen are two
menus that can be pulled down.  The  first  is  titled  'Menu'  and  the
second  is  'OSI'.   To pull down either menu place the pointer over the
desired title and press and hold the button.  The  selected  menu  title
will  become  highlighted and a list of commands will appear beneath the
title.  Releasing the button without moving the pointer will  cause  the
menu  to disappear.  The menus can also be pulled down by typing M (on a
//e or //c) or SHIFT-M (On a //, //+ or ///). 

Choosing Menu Commands.  Menu commands are chosen by using the  dragging
technique.   Position  the pointer over the selected menu title and pull
down the menu by pressing the button. While  holding  the  button  down,
drag  the  pointer  to  the  desired menu command.  As the pointer moves
through the menu, each command is highlighted in turn.  When the desired
command is highlighted, releasing the button selects it.  If you  change
your  mind  about  choosing a command, move the pointer off the menu, or
back up to the title, then release the button. Nothing is chosen  unless
you release the button while one of the commands is highlighted. 

Dimmed  Commands.   When 'Menu' is pulled down, some of the commands are
less distinct than others.  These less distinct commands are referred to
as dimmed.  Dimmed options are ones that cannot be used at that time. 

Dialogue Boxes.  Whenever additional information is required to complete
a command, a dialogue box appears.  Dialogue boxes usually have  special
areas  called  'buttons' to click, such as 'OK' or 'Cancel'.  Sometimes,
they present further options for selection.   Dialogue  boxes  are  also
used  to  warn you if you're about to do something that is irreversible.
If keyboard control is used, the pointer will automatically  move  to  a
dialogue  box  anytime one appears.  Typing O or V will move the pointer
to the 'OK' button and typing RETURN will press  it.  Typing  Ctrl-O  or
Ctrl-V  (or button 1 on the joystick) will automatically invoke the 'OK'
button. 

Control Keys.  In most cases, pressing single keys, such as O or V, will
move the pointer to a command area (i.e. the 'OK' button, or the 'Menu')
without invoking that command.  The command must then be  invoked  by  a
second  keystroke,  such  as  typing RETURN.  This two-step process is a
safety precaution against accidently choosing the wrong  command.   This
precaution  can,  in  most cases, be overridden by pressing the CTRL key
while simultaneously  pressing  the  desired  command  key.   This  will
automatically   invoke   the   desired  command  without  requiring  the
additional keystroke. 

LOADING and SAVING GAMES
------------------------

A previously saved game can be loaded at any time.  If a  battle  is  in
progress  when  another  game  is  loaded, the current game will be lost
unless it is saved first.  To load a game, select "Load a Game" from the
Menu. 

A dialogue box will appear from which one of five  saved  games  can  be
selected.  Select the desired game and then click 'OK'. 

The  selected  game  will  be loaded in and the battle will proceed from
where it was saved. 

The current status of a battle can be saved for continued play later  by
selecting "Save a Game" from the Menu. 

A dialogue box will appear, from which one of five games can be selected
for saving.  Select the desired game and then click 'OK'.  The game will
be saved and play can continue.
