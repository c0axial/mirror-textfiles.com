TRICKY DICK INSTRUCTIONS

THE DISPLAY:
Press any key to get out of the display that appears when TRICKY DICK is run
This will bring up the data viewing area, but will leave intact the three
lines of parameters at the top of the screen and the command line at the
bottom. "ALL COMMANDS" at the lower right of the screen prompts you to
enter the instruction you wish TRICKY DICK to execute. Each command is
echoed on the right of the ':' to serve of a reminder of your last input.

HELP SCREEN (/ or ?):
The help screen lists each command. A ^ before a letter means that the CTRL
key must be pressed at the same time as the letter. Hit any key to go back
to the data display.

SELECT DOS VERSION (CTRL D):
Toggles between DOS 3.2/3.3 The current version is shown under the word DOS
at the top of the display.

SLOT, DRIVE AND DEVICE SELECT (CTRL O):
Brings the cursor up next to 'SL-'. If your disk controller is in SLOT 6,
hit RETURN, if not type the slot #. If a card with P5 and P6 PROMS is
present, DOS 3.2 will automatically be brought into play. The cursor will
move to 'DR=' -type in the # of the drive which has the disk you wish to
work on. After that, press RETURN to go to 'PR='. The default (PR=0) means
that printer output is disabled. Enter your printer card's slot # when you
are ready to print out some data from Tricky Dick.

TRACK AND SECTOR SELECT ( ;  <  > ):
';' puts the cursor next to 'T='. Select the track # and hit RETURN. The
cursor will then go to 'S='. Select the sector # and hit RETURN. A RETURN
alone for T or S accepts the value shown. You can increment or decrement the
track # shown by hitting < or > (with or without pressing the shift key).
Track #'s wrap around after track $22. You can also < and > the sector #
and in DOS 3.2 sectors wrap at $0C, with 3.3, they wrap at $0F. However, the
';' command allows you to designate track #s greater than $22 or sector #s
greater than $0F/$0C.

READING A SECTOR (CTRL R):
Press CTRL R to read the sector you've selected into TRICKY DICK'S buffer.
The sector data will be displayed in the data viewing area.

VOLUME NUMBER:
The volume # of the disk you just read will appear under the letters 'VOL'

CURSOR MOVEMENT (I,J,K,M AND ^I,^J^K^M):
I, J, K, and M move the cursor around the data display. When the cursor goes
beyond the edge of the screen, scrolling or wrap-around occurs. Scrolling
can be continued until the first or last line of sector data appears on the
screen. Holding down CTRL and hitting any of these 4 keys increases the
distance covered, causing the cursor to jump to the edge of the display.

EDITING SINGLE BYTES IN THE DISPLAY:
Place the cursor over the byte you want to change, and type in the new hex
value. Single-digit hex numbers must be entered with a leading 0 i.e. enter
5 as 05. If you type the first digit and change your mind, hit 'J' or 'K' to
move the cursor away and cancel the entry. If you want to change the digit,
hit the SPACEBAR and start again.

DATA ENTRY MODES (CTRL @) (") ('):
Just after loading TRICKY DICK, the words "NORMAL HEX" will appear at the
lower left of the screen next to the word "DATA". That means that you can
 enter hex digits and these digits will appear in the data display under the
cursor. This allows you to edit the screen display before writing it to disk.
Typing " (SHIFT 2) puts you in "high ASCII" mode and causes an inverse "HIGH
ASCII" message to appear in the lower left corner of the screen. In this mode,
each time you press ANY key, its corresponding ASCII code # with the high bit
set will appear under the cursor, and the cursor will advance to the next
space. This lets you type alphanumeric characters into the data display without
looking up their corresponding high ASCII codes. Before you can issue any
other command, you'll need to hit the CTRL SHIFT P (CTRL @). This puts you
back into the "NORMAL HEX" mode and allows TRICKY DICK to accept your
 keyboard commands again. Typing ' (SHIFT 7) will place you in standard, or
"low" ASCII mode. Each keypress will leave its normal ASCII under the cursor.
To return to normal TRICKY DICK functions, hit CTRL SHIFT P (CTRL @).

THE DATA DISPLAY:
When you read a sector, the data viewing area shows the first half (the first
128 bytes) of the sector data. On the far right of the screen you will also
see an 8 column alphanumeric symbol display. This part of the screen gives
an ASCII translation or the hex data. CTRL characters are in inverse and
all flashing symbols get changed to normal.

To view the second half of the sector, hit either CTRL M or RETURN, bringing
the cursor to the bottom of the screen. To scroll throught the remaining data,
hold down the M and REPT keys. You can scroll back to the beginning by
hitting CTRL I, followed by pressing I and REPT. Alternatively, hold down
the CTRL key and press F, M, and F, in that order. The column of hex #s on
the far left which are followed by a ':' tell you what portion of the sector
data you're viewing. They are offsets in TRICY DICK'S data buffer and range
from $00 to $FF in 8 byte increments.

FLIPPING DATA DISPLAYS (CTRL F):
When in the viewing mode CTRL F will erase the alphanumeric symbols on the
right of the screen and display all the data in the last sector read. The
cursor will remain over the same byte during the flip. The leftmost column
of numbers indicates the buffer offsets, but with the trailing zero omitted
to retain clear screen formatting. Press CTRL F again to get back to the
partial screen with ASCII and the next 128 bytes of data, starting with the
row in the full display where you left your cursor.

SECTOR FILLING (CTRL Z, CTRL X):
In either of the above 2 displays, CTRL Z replaces the sector data with
zeros beginning with the byte over which the cursor is placed, and extending
to the right to the end of the sector. CTRL X fills the sector from the cursor
to the end with the byte value under the cursor. These commands don't write
anything to the disk itself.

DISASSEMBLING SECTOR DATA (L):
Hitting L disassembles the sector code beginning with the byte under the
cursor and continuing until the screen is filled. The middle column of the
display gives the ASCII translation of the hex data to its left. Repeatedly
pressing the L carries on the disassembly until the end of the sector is
reached. After disassembling a screenful of hex, you can return to the
previous hex display by hitting the SPACEBAR or some other noncommand key.
The cursor will be positioned next to the last byte that was disassembled.

LISTING APPLESOFT AND INTEGER CODE (CTRL L) (L):
If the sector data contains Applesoft or Integer BASIC code, a listing can
also be displayed. Select the language that you want to list by pressing
CTRL L then typing an A for Applesoft, an I for Integer or a * for
assembler. Finally hit L for a listing which begins with the byte under the
cursor. Keep typing L's until you have listed all the code in the sector
buffer.

WRITING TO THE DISK (CTRL W AND Y):
CTRL W followed by 'Y' writes the contents of the sector buffer to the sector
whose address shown at the top of the screen. WARNING: Be sure that all the
information shown on the screen is correct before you write it, if you make
a mistake you'll clobber the disk, maybe irreparably. Check to be certain
you've selected the correct drive, track and sector #'s and that the data
displayed on the screen is the data you want written on the disk. When you
press CTRL W you'll hear 6 short tones. Keying in a 'Y' during this sequence
writes to the disk and stops the tones. If you press CTRL W by mistake, you
can simply elect not to do anything and when the 6 tones cease, the write
instruction is automatically cancelled.

ERROR MESSAGES:
When an error occurs during the operation of TRICKY DICK, a tone is sounded
and a flashing error message occurs inside the '<-->' mark in the upper right
corner of the screen. Just above, Tricky Dick displays the accompanying DOS
error code inside the '<00>'. a subsequent normal read or write operation
clears both the error message and its code from the screen. The chart below
shows the type of error, its flashing designator, and its DOS code.

Type of Error               '<-->' designation          DOS code
Write Protect Error                <WP>                    10
Drive Error (Read or Write)        <IO>                    40

DEALING WITH NON-STANDARD SECTOR MARKS (CTRL S):
These are the features that let you read and write to disks whose formatting
has been altered. To do this with the least amount of work, use THE LINGUIST
to determine the nature and extent of the alterations.

Hit CTRL S and the cursor will jump up to first byte of the sector marks.
You can move the cursor along this data with the left and right arrows. To
replace any digit, position the cursor over it and type in the new digit.
The change will appear and the cursor will move to the next symbol. A RETURN
gets the cursor back to the data display.

In the top line, "D5AA96" is the standard DOS 3.3 address field header and
"DEAA" is the address field trailer. If you've changed the DOS version to
3.2 the top line will read "D5AAB5" which is the 3.2 header. The next line
"D5AAAD" refers to the data field header and "DEAA" is that field's trailer.
IMPORTANT: By replacing one or more of the header or trailer bytes with a
'00', you can tell TRICKY DICK to accept any value in that position. For
example, 'DE00' in the first line causes the second byte of all address
field trailers to be ignored during reading or writing.

The third line shows the data field header and trailer (the latter with
an added 'EB') once again. The header and trailer you select here will
appear in the data field of the next sector you WRITE to the disk. This line
is used only for writing and allows you to alter the values in the data field
header and trailer of any sector you write to the disk.

Finally, by changing the 'Y's' in the DOS mark section to 'N's', you can tell
TRICKY DICK to ignore the address field checksum (the first Y) and/or the
data field checksum (the second Y). The 'O' just below the 2 'Y's' indicates
that TRICKY DICK will always write a sector of data to the disk with a data
field checksum of $00.

PRINTING HARD COPY FROM TRICKY DICK (CTRL P) (P):
Typing CTRL P allows you to select the form in which you wish the sector
data in TRICKY DICK'S display to be printed. The cursor will jump to the
print select parameter, prompting you to type in one of the following
instructions:
'H' for a hex dump with ASCII translations
'A' for an Applesoft listing of the sector code
'I' for an Integer listing
'*' for a disassembly
The next step is to type CTRL O, followed by 2 RETURNS. This brings the
cursor in position next to the 'PR=' for you to key enter the slot # of
your printer interface. After making sure that your printer is turned on,
type 'P' for the action to begin. If you select the wrong slot, you may
find that TRICKY DICK hangs, or that other strange things happen.

If you are in the *, A or I modes you'll get a listing from the last cursor
position to the end of the sector data. In the 'H' mode, you get a full sector
dump irrespective of the cursor position.

MODULE CHECK-OUT (SHIFT M):
Typing a SHIFT M displays a list of the TRICKY DICK coresident modules,
their names and a brief description of their functions. If one of the
modules is already in memory, its name will be displayed at the top of the
screen just to the right of the inverse 'TRICKY DICK'. If no module is in
memory, TRICY DICK'S version # will be displayed.

EXITING TRICKY DICK (RESET) (CTRL C):
You can restart TRICKY DICK by typing '&' (or CALL 2051). CTRL Y (or 803G)
from the monitor also gets things going again.

JUMPING TO A MODULE (CTRL E):
To load a module while running TRICKY DICK, type CTRL C followed by BLOAD
(name of module). When the drive stops, type '&' and you're ready. When you
get back to TRICKY DICK you'll notice the name of the module presently in
memory replaces the version # in the banner at the top of the screen. To go
into a module you have loaded into memory, type CTRL E and the module's
introductory display will appear on the screen. Hit any key and you're ready.

If you hit CTRL E with no module in memory, TRICKY DICK will let you know by
sounding a rather pleasant tone. When you jump to one of the modules, the
words "TRICKY DICK" at the top of the screen get changed from inverse to
normal. At the same instant, the module's name switches from normal to
inverse. This lets you know at a glance which program you're "in" - it's
always the one whose name is in inverse.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm going to be posting docs on the modules as I get them done, this is
turning out to be quite an undertaking and I'd appreciate it if you'd
leave Apple Manor's name on if you give these docs to another board.
