For those of you who had problems with GScii crashing, please try this one out
and send me bug reports.

Now, then, here's the scoop on GScii+.

I've added BinHex decoding and sped up BinScii decoding * 3 (at least).
It almost keeps up with D.W.'s Binscii (not bad for an NDA).

There is a skip button, it will allow you to go on to the next file in the queue
if you selected a bunch of files.

There is a speed bar at the bottom of the screen :
     1) GScii allows you to do other things while it is working because it gets
          called by the desk manager every so often.
     2) In order to get any real work done, GScii needs to do several lines per
          call.
     3) The more work GScii does per call, the slower the desktop will become.
     4) This means, if you want the file decoded NOW and aren't going to do anything
          in the meantime, put it on fast.
     5) If you are messing around with your current application and don't want to
          wait forever to get a response to your clicks, put it on slow.

There is some pretty extensive error testing upon startup, so lemme know if
anything funny pops up on the screen and then won't let you do anything.

Re-written in C, so it's much more compact.  However, ORCA/C is not perfect, so
this is still a beta version, I'm not sure I've worked around all the compiler
problems.

Mail me!!!
