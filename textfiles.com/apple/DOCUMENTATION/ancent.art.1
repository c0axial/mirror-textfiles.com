  : MAP FEATURES :   Repair Port:  looks like a fort.  Increases the condition
  ----------------                 of a ships sails and hull.
  Supply Port: looks like a town.  Provides supplies to ships.
  Crown: A crown provides both supllies and repairs to ships of the same color
  and represents the heart of a sides homeland.  When either side's crown is
  captured the game ends.
  Rough Water: represented by dark water areas.  Dangerous for Frigates, Safe
  for Ships-of-the-line, Flagships and Merchantships.
  Shallow Water: represented by light water areas. Dangerous for Ships-of-the-
  line and Flagships.  Safe for Frigates and Merchantships.

  SHIPS:
         Squadrons: a group of between 1 and 3 ships
         Fleet: all of the squadrons of the same color form a fleet.
         Flagship: This is a ship-of-the-line with an Admiral aboard.  It is
                   the most powerful ship on the high seas.
         Ship-of-the-line: a mighty warship, nearly as strong as a flagship.
         Frigate: a small and fast warship.
         Merchantship: brings supplies to ports.

  HINTS:
         x To receive supplies or repairs from a port or a crown, you must
              anchor where there is a flat shore across the entire length of
              the port.  Check a squadron's "Info" to see if it is "in port".

         x The cannons can only fire out of the sides of the ship and the crew
              can only be on one side of the ship at a time.

  HOW THE CAMPAIGN ENDS:

         [1] When the last ship on either side is captured or sunk, or
         [2] When the last flagship on either side is captured or sunk, or
         [3] When one side captures the other side's crown or,
         [4] When either side surrenders.

                 TRAINING SESSION :   Prepare for WAR !

 -----------------------
 : CHOOSING A CAMPAIGN : Campaign: A series of military operations that form
 -----------------------             a war.


   Start at the title page. "GO TO WAR" should be displayed on the sail.  If
 not, press + or - until it is.  Press ENTER.  The sea scroll will open,
 revealing the titles of a variety of campaigns.  Most of the scrolls in the
 game are about two screens long, so use the + or - keys to see all of the
 information.
   From this point, until you press ENTER after choosing your opponnent, you
 can go back (all the way to the title screen, if you wish) by pressing ESC.

   Following the directions at the bottom of the screen, make sure the sabre
 is pointing to "The Bane of Oldain" and ENTER.  The sea scroll will close,
 and when it reopens, will reveal the story behind this campaign.  After you
 read through the story, press ENTER.  The scroll will close and reopen again,
 this time showing you the rules.  The rules have been individually preset for
 each campaign, but you can adjust them.  However, it's a good idea not to
 make any changes until you are more familiar with the game.  After you have
 read the rules, press ENTER.
                                        Now you will meet your opponent.
                                                                              
  CHOOSING AN OPPONENT

     You can fight any of the enemy leaders portrayed on the screen.  Each has 
a different fighting style, as well as different strengths and weaknesses.  At 
the  top of the screen,  you will see the enemy's name and a brief description 
of his fighting style.  Use the + or - keys to move the cursor box through the 
opponents. (HINT: the easiest opponent is Thor Foote.)

     When the cursor frame is on the enemy you want, press Enter.

  VIEWING THE WAR MAP

     As  the campaign begins,  you have a sea gull's eye view of the war  map.
At  the  bottom of the map are two ports.   The port on the left side  of  the 
screen is a Repair Port.   To improve the condition of a squadron's sails  and 
hulls,  anchor  it at a Repair Port.   The port at the right side is a  Supply 
Port.  To increase a squdron's supplies, anchor it at a Supply Port.
     Between  your  ports are two white crowns.   If an enemy ship  reaches  a 
white crown and defeats any white squadrons at that crown,  you will have lost 
the  campaign (the enemy's crown is at the top of the map).   Crowns will also 
repair and supply ships.
     Dark ocean areas represent rough water, and are dangerous for frigates to 
sail  through.   Light colored ocean areas represent shallow  water,  and  are 
dangerous  for  ships-of-the-line  and flagships to sail  through.   The  Wind 
Cherubs  at  the  top  center and bottom center  of  the  map  indicate  which 
direction the wind is blowing only if the wind is set to "realistic" in YeOlde 
Options  Shoppe.   The  wind  direction  will  occasionally  change  during  a 
campaign.
     The white cross-shaped object near the center of the screen is the marker 
which lets you scout out the enemy squadrons and command your own.  
     The  ship and anchor symbols represent squadrons of ships.   You  control 
the white squadrons,  and the enemy controls the black ones.  Asquadron symbol 
with a flag on it means there is a flagship in that squadron.
     To  scroll  the  map,  use the - key to scroll up (+ key to  scroll  back 
down).   You can jump quickly to the top or bottom of the map by pressing  the 
Shift  key and the + or - key at the same time.   You can use Ctrl in place of 
+,and Tab in place of -.   This is especially helpful if you are left  handed. 
If  you are using the joystick,  hold down button #1 and move the joystick  to 
scroll the map.
     You  will  recieve  messages during the campagin  indicating  enemy  ship 
sightings,  imminent encounters and other events.   These messages will appear 
at the bottom of the screen, just above the command line.
     
  YOUR MISSION

     Win by capturing or sinking all of the enemy's flagships while protecting 
your own.  You can also win by capturing a black crown.  In the Ancient Art of 
War  at Sea,  the most skillful player does what it takes to win the  campaign 
with a minimum of fighting.

  COMMAND OPTIONS

     At  the  bottom  of  the  current screen  are  several  command  options.
Throughout the AAoWaS,  command options will appear,  usually at the bottom of 
the screen.   To select an option, pess the letter key that corresponds to the 
first letter of the command.  In this example, the commands are as follows:

   (T)ime  -- You can alter the speed of the campaign at any point  when  Time 
appears  on  the  command line by pressing T.   Four  different  settings  are 
possible.   (You  may want to use a slower time when you're making your plans, 
then speed up time when you've got everything set.)

   (F)leet -- Press F and the size of both fleets will be displayed.  You will 
see the types and total number of ships on both sides.   The game will  freeze 
while you are doing this.  Press End(or any other key) when you are done.

   (C)lear  -- Use Clear to remove old messages from the bottom of the screen.
Clear will not appear when there are no messages displayed.

   (P)ause -- Use Pause to freeze the game.   To get things going again, press 
any  key.   Clear will sometimes take the place of Pause on the command  line, 
but pause will still work.

   (S)urrender -- You can surrender at any time during the game when Surrender 
appears on the command line by pressing S.

    Saving  the  Game -- Press Alt S if you want to save the game so  you  can 
resume playing where you left off at a later time.   The computer will  prompt 
you  to  insert a data (or blank) disk -- just follow the instructions on  the 
screen; the program takes care of the rest.

     There  are command options available when you have the marker  positioned 
over one of your own squadrons.

   (M)ove -- To "move" a squadron,  press M(notice that the marker changes its 
shape  to an open box).   Move the marker,using the keyboard or  joystick,  to 
trace the path you want the squadron to follow,  and press M again to mark the 
destination ( a small white mark will appear here).   The squadron will follow 
the exact same route that the marker took.   Collisions between squadrons will 
not occur.

Occasionally,  while you are tracing a squadron's path, the computer will mark 
a  destination  before  you press M.   This means the  computer's  memory  for 
keeping  track  of  squadron paths is temporarily  full.   Once  the  squadron 
reaches the marked destination,  you will usually be able to move it ahead  to 
the final destination.  This shouldn't happen very often though.

   (I)nfo  -- Press I to see what ships are in a squadron.   It will show  you 
their names, type, the condition of their hulls, supplies on board and sailing 
speed.  While you are in Info,  you can change the squadron's sailing speed by 
pressing  S.    A  frigate  at half sails will move at the same speed  as  the 
larger ships will full sails.  Press E when you are done.

You  can  gather limited information about an enemy squadron  by  placing  the 
marker over it, and pressing I for info.

   (D)etach -- To detach part of a squadron,  press D.  Use the + or - keys to 
select a ship and then press S to switch it to the new squadron.  When you are 
done, press E.

   (J)oin -- If two squadrons are close enough, you can Join them (up to a max 
of  3  ships  in a squad).   Press J and then join them in the  same  way  you 
detached  a squadron.   If Join is not shown at the bottom of the screen,  you 
can use the Move to bring the squadrons closer together.

   (Z)oom -- This option appears on the command line when you place the marker 
over  a squadron that has encountered an enemy squadron and changed  into  the 
battle symbol of crossed sabres.   Zomm gives you an exciting, animated close-
up view of the battle where you can give tactical commands to your ships.

   (P)ractice  -- Use  this  option  to  familiarize  yourself  with  tactical 
operations.   Practice is the same as Zoom except it is used when the enemy is 
not present.  When you are done practicing press E.

          TACTICAL OPERATIONS

     Tactical operations begin after choosing either Zoom or Practice.  During 
this  phase,  movement on the war map will stop.   You can choose between  two 
views,  a long view of the entire tactical battle area,  or a closer view of a 
portion  of the battle area.   The white ships on the screen are yours and  if 
the enemy ships are present, they will be black.  

The  long view lets you see the relative positions of all the ships  involved.
This is useful for setting up your tactical plan and watching the enemy's plan 
of attack. Time will move faster when using close view.

During  a long view,  you will see the view fram over the water.   The ship in 
the center of the frame is the selected ship and info about it is displayed at 
the top of the screen.   You are "on board" the selected ship and can give  it 
orders.  If there is more than one ship in your squadron, use + or - to select 
another ship.  The selected ship will blink and be centered in the view frame.

     (S)peed: Adjust the sails to control the speed of the ship.
     (G)un  : Change broadsides to fire from the other side of the ship.
     (A)im  : Change the barrel eleveation to adjust the range.
     (F)ire : Shoot the cannon.
     (O)rders:Change the ship's orders
     (T)ime : Adjust the speed of the game.
     (V)iew : Switch between close-view and long-view of the battle
     (P)ause: Freeze the action temporarily.
     (L)eave: Lave the battle, return to the battle map.

  The  view  frame will follow that ship until you use the keypad to move  the 
view  frame around the battle area.   When you press the Space bar,  the  view 
frame will center on the selected ship and begin following it again.

The  view  frame can also be used like a magnifying glass  by  pressing  View.
This  gives you a close view,  causing the area inside the view frame to  fill 
the  whole  screen.   You  can also move within this close view by  using  the 
keypad.   For example,  press 7 to move Northwest,  6 to move East,  etc.  The 
close view is usefull for precision maneuvering and combat.   Holes in damaged 
sails  and  hulls  can also be seen during a close  view.   In  long  view,  a 
disabled ship will show damage marks.  To return to a long view, press View.

If enemy ships are present,  try moving the view frame so that enemy ships are 
within  it's boundaries and press View to see the condition of their sails and 
hull.

If two ships are close enough where part of one is being covered by the other, 
the  nearest ship will become partially transparent so you can see the  hidden 
ship.

If  a ship goes far enough off the edge of the battle area,  it has  retreated 
and you can no longer use it during this battle.

If a ship is stopped, it will drift in the direction of the wind.

If  the  battle takes place near a shore,  avoid the hidden  coral  reefs  and 
shoals that occur near land.

Time  moves  a  little slower when you are using close view than  during  long 
view.   But  even the slowest time setting in the game is considerably  faster 
than the pace real sailing ships moved at during actual battles.        

Time,  View and Pause can be used almost always in tactical battle mode,  even 
if they are not displayed on the screen.

If  you decide you want to leave a tactical battle before it  is  over,  press 
Leave.  You will return to the strategy level and the battle will continue and 
resolve on it's own.

     COMMANDING A SHIP

When  you have selected a ship in a tactical battle,  you are responsible  for 
the ship's speed,  course,  orders and cannons.  When using a command, it will 
be  highlighted.   When appropriate,  additional instructions will be shown on 
the  command line at the bottom of the screen.   To leave a command and  clear 
the command line, press Enter.

If  you are using a paticular command you can usually go directly  to  another 
command  without  having to formally leave the first command.   Just type  the 
first letter of the new command.

     SAILING SPEED

The speed of the ship is determined by the condition and trim of the sails and 
the direction of the wind.

The  trim  of  the sails is represented at the top left  corner  by  the  Sail 
Indicator.   Press  S and then use + or - to adjust the trim.   The more  sail 
that is put to the wind,  the faster the ship will move.  If no sail is shown, 
the ship will come to a halt.   Press Enter when you are done.   To quickly go 
to full sails, press S twice.  If the sails are already full when you do this, 
they  will  switch  to no sails.   As a ship's sails become damaged  the  Sail 
Indicator will start to turn blue,  indicating decreased effectiveness of  the 
sails.  

The wind direction Indicator is to the upper left of the Sail Indicator.   The 
wind  can blow from any of the 4 primary compass points.   The Wind  Direction 
Indicator will only appear if wind is set to "realistic" in the Options Shop.

Momentum  is  a factor when moving a ship through the water.   A stopped  ship 
will take a few moments to get up to speed after giving it full sails,  and  a 
moving  ship  will take a few moments to stop after cutting the sails all  the 
way back.  A ship that loses momentum will drift in the direction of the wind.

To  the  right  of  the Sail Indicator is the Speed  Bar.   It  works  like  a 
speedometer.   The Spped Bar will be full when a ship is in perfect condition, 
using  full  sails  and on a course that takes full  advantage  of  the  wind.
Trimming  the  sails,  sail  damage and beating into the  wind  contribute  to 
reducing your speed and are reflected in the Speed Bar.  If the wind is set to 
"not realistic" in the Options Shoppe, it will not affect the Speed Bar.

     CANNONS

To  the  right of the Sail Indicator are the controls for the ship's  cannons.
You decide which side of the ship the men will be on and when to fire.

If ship is not selected, it will automatically shoot at enemy ships.

     GUN

Your crew can man only one side of the ship at a time.   If the crew is at the 
cannon on the right,  the ship will fire out of the right starboard side.   To 
change broadsides, press G for Gun and your crew will move to the left cannon.

To  help  you visualize which direction your cannons will fire,  look  at  the 
gauge at the top right of the screen.   Your ship is in the center and the red 
square shows the direction that your cannons will fire.

     AIM 
   
Aim  is  available  to the player only when "Manual Aim" is  selected  in  the 
Options Shoppe.   If Manual Aim is not selected,  the crew will  automatically 
aim the cannons for you, and this option will no be available.

You  cannot aim or fire a cannon unless your crew is on that side of the  ship 
and in firing position (standing behind the cannon with the firing punk ready)

To aim your cannons, press A.  Use + or - to raise or lower the aim.

     FIRE

On the top of the cannon barrel is a small hole with a bit of gunpowder in it.
When  you  order "Fire!",  a slow burning punk is touched to this  hole.   The 
flame  from  this  flash runs down to the base of the charge  and  the  cannon 
fires.  Your crew will quickly reload and you'll be ready to fire again.

When  realistic  reload  is selected in the Options  Shoppe  your  crewman  go 
through a longer procedure.   The crew may skip some of the loading procedures 
depending on the reload time seeting in your Options Shoppe.

You  will see a flash on the target ship when a cannonball hits.   Damage from 
sail hits is evident as the ship's sails become increasingly tattered.   A hit 
on the hull will destory cannon and crew and leave holes.  Damage to sails and 
hull can be seen most clearly when the side of the ship is facing you.

     ORDERS

Battle orders are given to ships in your squadron individually.   To change  a 
ship's  orders,  press  O,  then  use + or - to rotate through  the  available 
orders.   You can also press O again if you prefer, since it works the same as 
+.   Some of the orders are not always available.   While Orders is  selected, 
time stops.  (Orders is selected ?? Shouldn't that be are selected ??)

     General Chase: Make your best speed and course to individually attack the 
                      enemy.

     Follow Ship in front:  Try to maintain a single-file line if it is behind 
                              another ship.

     Mimic Ship in front: Copy the maneuvers of the ship ahead.

     Avoid Battle: Stay away from the action.

     Course:  Player  controls the heading of the ship.   When you select this 
                order,  a box will appear on the perimeter of the gauge at the 
                top  right of the screen.   Use + or - to move the box  around 
                the gauge,  and the ship will turn to the heading indicated by 
                the  box.   A quick way to change a ships orders to Course  is 
                simply to press C (you don't need to press Orders first).

     Board: Grapple a disabled ship.

          At the upper right of the screen is the compass.   At the center  of 
the  compass is the "heading Indicator" which shows the active ship's  current 
heading.   The  red  square is the "Gun Indicator."  It shows which  broadside 
will shoot when you press Fire.   When a ship's orders are "Course", the white 
"Course  Box"  will appear showing the current course assigned to  the  active 
ship.   The  "Heading Indicator" will always point at the "Course Box"  except 
when the active ship is turning to that course.

     BOARD

If two ships come together,  side by side, they will grapple.  If neither ship 
is disabled or extremely overmatched, you will have the opportunity to command 
the  battle  yourself.   When  you receive the message  that  two  ships  have 
grappled, select Zomm to take command and meet the enemy man to man.

There  are two types of fighters,  sailors and marines.   Marines shoot rifles 
and  their orders are to take their station and fire at will.   Sailors  fight 
with swords and will respond to your commands.

Two ways to win when boarding.
1. Capture the enemys flag.
2. Defeat the enemy sailors and marines.

The  Four Zones:  The raised deck at the stern of your ship is  the  Poopdeck. 
(don't look at me).  The lower deck is the Quarterdeck, except for the area by 
the  enemy  ship,  which is called the Railing.   The foruth zone is the  area 
around the flag.

Commands:   You command your sailors by assigning them to a new zone to  fight 
in.  To do this, press the first letter of the zone the sailor is in, followed 
by the first letter of the zone you want him to move to.  For example, to move 
a  sailor  from the Poopdeck to the Flag,  press P and then F.   To  repeat  a 
command,  press  (A)gain.   If you select a zone to move from and then  change 
your mind,  you can cancel it by pressing Backspace or Esc.  From the Poopdeck 
to  the  Railing  you can command a sailor to (C)ross.   A  sailor  with  this 
command will try to fight his way across the enemy ship and try to reach their 
flag.   Once  a sailor is told to Cross,  he will be dedicated to that mission 
and you will not be able to recall him.

To begin the battle,  press (A)ttack.   If you would rather leave and let them 
fight it out for themselves, press (L)eave.
 
     SAILING TO WAR

Now you've learned how to command squadrons, gather information on a strategic 
level  and  command battleships on a tactical level !   Remember  - the  enemy 
squadrons  are  on the move while you're getting ready to meet  them,  so  act 
quickly !!

The campaign can end in any of four ways:

[1] When the last ship on either side is captured or sunk.
[2] When the last flagship on either side is captured or sunk.
[3] When one side captures the other side's crown.
[4] When either side surrenders.

After  the campaign is finished,  you will see the results of the  battle.   A 
chart  will show how many warships on each side were sunk or captured and  the 
number of flagships that were sunk or captured.

     END OF TRAINING SESSION

The  purpose of this training session was to show you how to use the  program.

               *** NOTE `O' FRIENDS OF SVEN *** 

    There isn't anything you can do in this part of the program that will have 
a permanent effect,  so feel free to "cut loose!".   You can change any or all 
of the rules and choose a different opponent if you wish.   Each campaign  can 
be very different, depending on the rules and the enemy, but the next time you 
play the game, everything will return to the way it was before you started.


     SHIP DISCRIPTIONS

The  warships  in The Ancient Art of War at Sea are of the late  18th  century
variety.   You will encounter four types of ships in The Ancient Art of War at 
Sea.

     * MERCHANTSHIPS *

Merchantships  supply  ports  with  food,   provisions  and  various  nautical 
equipment.   They  are  lightly  armed and built for  carrying  supplies,  not 
fighting.   Merchantships  have their own orders and you have no control  over 
them.  You can intercept enemy merchantships to capture their supplies.

     * FRIGATE *

Frigates  are  small warships.   They usually had one gundeck in  addition  to 
cannons  on  the quarterdeck and forecastle.   The  classic  frigates  carried 
between 30 and 44 guns.   Fast and maneuverable,  they could escape a ship-of-
the-line and were powerful enough to handle any other vessel.

A frigate in the AAoWaS is a sleek,  fast,  two-decker with 44 guns and a crew 
of 250.

     * SHIP-OF-THE-LINE *

A ship-of-the-line in the AAoWaS is of the classic type:  a four deck,  74-gun 
warship, including 10 carronades, and a crew of more than 600.

     * FLAGSHIP *

A  flagship  in the AAoWaS contains an Admiral and is of the classic  type:  a 
massive  four deck,  130 gun warship,  including 22 carronades and a  crew  of 
875... the most fearsome sight on the high seas.

                                                                             
      ------------
      : STRATEGY :
      ------------

  Concentrate your Power.

     When facing an enemy fleet of equal or greater size, isolate small groups 
of enemy ships.  Attack partial fleets with full fleets.  Isolate one ship and 
fight  it  with two or three ships.   This is the way to defeat an enemy  both 
strategically and tactically.

     Usually try to keep squadrons full with three ships instead of  splitting 
them into smaller squadrons.   If you split them up, you'll end up with two or 
three weak squadrons instead of one powerfull squadron.

     Before  deciding to battle,  compare the strength of your squadron to the 
strength  of  the  enemy  squadron and  determine  your  chances  of  victory.
(Strength is determined by the number of ships on each side, the type of ships 
on each side and their condition.)  Then,  try to engage in battle only from a 
position  of strength.   The condition of the ships involved can have a  major 
effect on the odds of winning.

     Focus  your  attention  on enemy flagships (where  their  Admirals  are).
Since a fleet cannot function without any Admirals,  eliminate their flagships 
and they will be defeated.  Cut off the head and the body will die.

     Use  your crown or supply ports to keep your ships stocked.   A well  fed 
crew is an efficient crew.   Use your Crown or Repair ports to keep your ships 
in good condition.  One fresh ship is better than two badly damaged ships.  If 
a  squadron's supplies decrease below 20%,  the condition of the ships in  the 
squadron  will start to deteriorate.   This is because the crew has to  ration 
food and can't work as hard to keep the ship in good condition.

     Anchor near a food port to increase supplies.   Anchor near a repair port 
to  improve condition.   To be sure your ship is receiving supplies or repairs 
from  a  port,  check its Info after it is anchored.   Instead  of  indicating 
speed,  it should say "In Port".   A Crown will increase both the supplies and 
the condition of any ship in its harbor.  A ship cannot be repaired unless its 
supplies are above 20%.   Another way to increase a squadron's supplies is  to 
capture enemy merchantships or intercept friendly merchantships.

     Frigates are the fastest ships on the high seas.  But a squadron can only 
sail as fast as its slowest ship.   If you need speed, make sure your squadron 
is made up exclusively of frigates.

     Merchantships and Ports
     -----------------------

     Ports supply or repair any squadrons that are anchored in their harbor as 
long as the port has supplies.   When a port's supplies get low,  it will send 
for  a  merchantship to replenish its depleted stock.   If a  merchantship  is 
captured before reaching port, the port will send for another merchantship but 
may  soon  run  out of supplies.   When a port changes colors,  it is  out  of 
supplies and closed to any squadrons in its harbor.

     To blockade a port,  use a squadron to intercept merchantships enroute to 
that port.  The enemy will lose supplies and your squadron will gain supplies.
Frigates  are effective interceptors since they are the fastest ships  on  the 
sea.

     You  can  also  intercept  your own merchantships at sea  to  increase  a 
squadron's  supplies.   If  the  squad's supplies are  below  50%,  the  white 
merchantship's  supplies will be used up and it will  disappear.   You  cannot 
capture a merchantship after it reaches a port's harbor.

     You  may  want to send warships to escort friendly merchantships  if  the 
enemy presents a threat to your supply line.

     Rough Water/ Shallow Water
     --------------------------

     Larger  ships  (flagships and ships-of-the-line) can sail  through  rough 
water  without fear or damage,  but frigate will often sink,  depending on how 
rough  the  water is.   This factor can be adjusted in the Rules  scroll  just 
before starting a campaign.

     It  is very dangerous to try to sail large ships through  shallow  water.
When a flagship is lost in shallow water, the Admiral will board another ship-
of-the-line that is in the same squadron.   If there is none, the Admiral will 
go  down  with  his  ship.    Frigates  have  no  troulbe  in  shallow  water.
Merchantships can sail through rough or shallow water without fear or damage.

     Wind
     ----

     A  major  factor  in  the speed of sailing ships.   If  wind  is  set  to 
realistic  in Ye Olde Options Shoppe,  look for the Wind Cherub on the map  to 
see which way the wind is blowing.   Generally,  the more you try to sail into 
the  wind,  the slower your squadron will move.   The wind may change during a 
campaign.  Wind speed varies from 5 to 15 knots.

     If you plan to attack an enemy squadron,  try to gain the wind  advantage 
by meeting him with the wind at your back.   The position of the crossed sabre 
symbols  in  relation  to the wind on the strategic level determines  the  two 
squadron's  position  in relation to the wind after you zoom to  the  tactical 
level.

 : TACTICS :  Note: Due to difficulties and lack of time I've had to skip
 -----------           MOST parts of this chapter.

  ORDERS - Each ship in your squadron will be given individual orders.  The
orders that you can give will vary dependin on the situation.

   Course: This is used when you want to take charge of a ship's naviagation.

   General Chase: Make your best speed and course to attack the enemy.

   Follow Ship in Front: You can use this order to try to maintain a line.

   Mimic Ship in Front: A ship with this order will turn the same amount as the
ship in front of it even if they are on different headings.

   Avoid Battle: If your ship gets hurt badly you may want to use this.

   Boarding: A ship with this command will sail to and board a disabled enemy
ship.  It can also board a friendly ship and make enough repairs to put it
back into action.

    DUKE OF MEDINA SIDONIA 1588 

        Strategy: Sidonia tends to pick an objective and then move towards it
                    enmasse.
        Tactics : Sidonia's cannons can only shoot a short distance so his
                    ships will try to fight at close range.  His Spanish
                    galleons are slow and bulky ships that were built to carry
                    marines.  His goul is to bound your ships where he can use
                    his superior marksmen to defeat you.  His sailors are not
                    skilled in the art of fencing.

        Tactics : Beware of Blackbeard's bloodthirsty pirate crew: they are the
                    most deadly swordsmen on the high seas !  He will try to
                    close with your ships where he can board and fight man to
                    man.  Motivated by greed, the pirates can reload their
                    cannons faster than any other crew.
        When grappling, 95% of his crew will be sailors and 5% marines.

        Strategy: Tromp is a conservative strategist and will patiently wait
                    for an opening or weakness in his enemy's forces.
        Tactics : His cannons are more accurate and will shoot farther than any
                    enemy leader that came before him.  The skill level of his
                    marines and sailors are average.  The maximum range of his

        Tactics : His cannons shoot farther than any other leader's except
                    Nelson's.  The fighting skills of his sailors and marines

    [ CAMPAIGN DESCRIPTIONS ]
   
       The  Ancient  art of War at Sea contains  eleven  campaigns,  each 
  offering a unique challenge.  
       A brief description of each campaign follows.  Difficulty is rated 
  on a scale of 1 to 10,  10 being the most difficult.  time is also on a 
  scale  of  1  to 10,  10 being the lengthiest.   (Of  course,  if  your 
  opponent  is  much craftier than you,  it might make a long  game  very 
  short.)  Time and difficulty will vary if you change the rules  or  the 
  enemy leader.

     THE BANE OF OLDAIN
       The massive enemy fleet is setting sail in the north.   Your fleet 
  is  harbored  in the sout.   This may be the first campaign,  but  that 
  doesn't  mean it's going to be easy !   A balanced offense and  defense 
  could be the key to victory.

     Difficulty: 3
     Time: 5

     THE RACE FOR THE CROWN
       You  have  3 warships,  the pirates have 26  warships.   They  are 
  between you and your crown.   What could be more fair !?   The emphasis 
  in this campaign is on strategy.

     Difficulty: 2
     Time: 3

     RUNNING THE GAUNTLET
       Again,  you find yourself cut off from your crown by a huge  enemy 
  fleet.  It will take an understanding of many aspects of the art of war 
  to be standing victorious when this campaign is over!

     Difficulty: 4
     Time: 4

     THE LAST CROWN
       You've  managed  to corner your enemy at his crown.   You've  also 
  managed  to lose most of your once powerful fleet in the  process.   To 
  clinch a victory will require a clever game of cat and mouse.

     Difficulty: 5
     Time: 6

     ATTACK OF THE SUPERPOWER
       Anticipate the enmey's strategy and strike where he is weakest
                                                             (Aiken Drum)
     Difficulty: 5  
     Time: 5

     1588 THE SPANISH ARMADA
       You command the British defense fleet that is standing between the 
  Armada and its traget, London (the white crown).  To stop their advance 
  you  will need to rapidly deploy your squadrons to where they  will  be 
  most effective.   During combat, take advantage of your technologically 
  superior ships and cannons.

     Difficulty: 7
     Time: 10

     1676 SICILY, 1798 THE NILE
       You  are  thrust into the middle of a pair of famous battles  that 
  occurred a century apart.  it will require strategic brilliance against 
  the French on two fronts to avoid a visit to Davey Jone's Locker !

     Difficulty: 6
     Time: 5

     1759 QUIBERON BAY
       This  time,  you are placed in command of a French fleet  that  is 
  being  hard  pressed  by a strong British presence.   to take  a  bold, 
  offensive position or a more cautious defensive position,  that is  the 
  question.

     Difficulty: 4
     Time: 4

     1805 TRAFALGAR
       This  battle was Admiral Horatio Nelson's most brilliant  victory, 
  But  what  if  you were in charge of the British sea force  instaed  of 
  Nelson ?  Can you find the weak link in the French chain ?

     Difficulty: 8 
     Time: 8

     1941 BISMARCK
       What  if  the  battle of the Bismarck had taken  place  200  years 
  earlier ?   You command the mighty Bismarck but the British are sending 
  every available ship on a single mission: to sink you !

     Difficulty: 8
     Time: 4

     YOU ONLY LIVE THRICE
       We saved this one for last.   Some players swear that this one  is 
  impossible to beat.  They're wrong.

     [[ DATA DISKS ]]

  A  data disk is used when you want to make your own campaigns,  play  a 
  campaign that you make,  or resume a campaign that was previously saved.  
  You  can make as many data disks as you want.   Each data disk can hold 
  up to 11 new campaigns and 1 saved game.

     PREPARING A DATA DISK

  Before you start, you will need to have a blank or expendable disk to use as 
your Data Disk.   The program will tell you when you need to insert your disk.
If your disk is not formatted,  the program will do this for you.  Just follow 
the  prompts to swap disks when necessary, and the computer will do the rest.
  Make sure the Data Disk option is set properly in the "Options Shoppe.".

       PLAYING A CAMPAIGN
  To play a campaign that you created and saved on a Data Disk,  select "Go To 
War"  at  the  title page and then choose the last  selection  on  the  titles 
scroll, "Data Disk"
  If  you are using the Data Disk and you want to play a campaign on your  War 
Disk, choose the first selection "(WAR DISK)", on the data disk titles scroll.

       SAVING A GAME IN PROGRESS
  A  game can be saved only on a Data Disk.   If there already is a saved game 
on the Data Disk, taht game will be ERASED when you save the new game.
  You  can save a game in progress when the war map is on the screen  and  the 
pointer is not over a squad (any time "View" is on the command line).
  When you are ready to save the game, hold the Alt key down and press S.  The 
program  will tell you when to insert your Data Disk.   You will automatically 
exit the game after it is saved.

       RESUMING A SAVED GAME
  Select  "Go to War" at the title page.   Select the last title on the  first 
scroll, "(DATA DISK)".  The program will tell you wehn to insert the Data Disk 
with the Saved Game.
  When the program asks if you want to continue with the saved game, press 'Y'.
