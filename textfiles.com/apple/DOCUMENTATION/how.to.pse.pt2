   Hello, yes, finally i have been talked into writing part 2 and soon part 3
of this series... maybe more?? Dunno, but i am thinking of writing my very own
Pse editor which will incorperate some of the best editors into a single easy
to use program... well on to the file.


Proterm Special Emulation::: Speed and Size!
----------------------------------------------
 
    Speed in Pse is a very touchy subject, alot of the best heavy pse games and
Boards out are slow and clunky... people still refuse to do the extra work
required to make Pse go like lightening. Size, with the use of message bases to
distribute Pse ads and animations, people started to worry about size. The
normal Msg base has a 4k limit on messages entered or uploaded, although this
is plenty for a nice ad, some ad's are chopped off, many dont work at all! 
This is why you are going to learn about giving speed and size to Pse ads and
animations!


       Speedy Pse....
------------------------------
 
In using Pse you can do a number of things that will speed up those ads, most
will be covered, those that arent will be at a later date once you've become
Pse affluent...

===============================================================================
   <Control>-^     This Ctrl-^ function is used to position the cursor. If they
                are used to reposition the cursor space by space (like Street
                Scenes) the extra commands tend to slow the pse. So in order to
                speed up Pse, you should remove all extra ctrl-^'s used...

                   Extra Ctrl-^'s are used when you are positioning the cursor
                constantly space after space to print a horizontal sentence or
                string like so:
    
         abHbbEcbLdbLebOfb!gb!hb!   (output line:66  columns:65-72   )
  
                      (this prints the string 'HELLO!!!')
 
          Not all pse printing is done Horizontally, so it is best to first
          get the useable code. First make sure all of the parameter #2's are
          the same, this means they are printed on the same line. Now use the
          Ascii table to figure if the parameter #1's are in ascending order,
          (pse may be printed right to left, change for speed, but leave it if
          it is for effect) that is if it starts at a low column position and
          increases by one for each space.

            Once you have the code you wish to use, printing in left to right
          order (if parm #2's are in decending order, just flip it, use the
          last position and then assemble the string after it. Like so....

                       abHELLO!!!    (output same as above)

                             (Still prints 'HELLO!!!')

            This also works for repedative strings like 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
          But there is an even faster way to do those...

==============================================================================
   <Control>-R     This function is used when repeatedly printing characters
                   horizontally (example 'xxxxxxxxxxxxx'), if you print the
                   char in a line of 3 or more, you will save alot of wasted
                   time...

                   A line printed like this::

                   ab<bb<cb<db<eb<fb<gb<

                   Will give an output of '<<<<<<<' at line:66  columms:65-71
                   this may be speeded up using the Control-^ idea like so:

                                ab<<<<<<<
                  
                   but this is made even faster by using the repeat char
                   function, this function was explained in file 1 but will be                    repeated here in the appendix. Anyways, by using the Ctrl-R
                   you will gain alot of speed... like so:

                                 ab<

                      This does the same thing, just alot faster... remeber,
                   look to file #1 for Ctrl-R info... some is also given at
                   the end of this file...

===============================================================================


Size... it really does matter!!
-------------------------------

   Size in Pse ads is usually not a problem, seeing as you have a whole 4k to
use that is... But in some really good ads where room is used in large amounts,
it is best to try and shorten the file by removing unneeded characters...

   Here are some of the most common space wasters in pse ad's::

         [1] Excess use of Ctrl-^'s... this was covered earlier in the
             file... it will make the pse faster and smaller.

         [2] Repeated characters without using ctrl-R. Use Ctrl-R whenever
             possible... it save alot of room and speed. It was also
             covered earlier.

         [3] Printing over 4 Spaces in a string when not needed. If you
             print a string like:

                 abABCDEFGHIJKL             MNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  
             You can save time and space by either replacing the spaces
             with a Ctrl-R of the equivelent number of spaces, or remove
             them and just use a Ctrl-^ to reposition the cursor to print
             the rest of the string that many spaces away... these are 
             used like so:

                   Ctrl-R:   abABCDEFGHIJKL MNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

                   Ctrl-^:   abABCDEFGHIJKLzbMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

             Both are the same size... but the Ctrl-R wastes a little time
             by printing the spaces, either will work though.

===============================================================================

    Well... this isnt as comprehensive as i had hoped... but it is fairly easy
to understand for a person who read and understood the first part of this series. Look for updates to the series giving more detail and information,
possibly, if i follow through, you will see a fully featured Editor combineing the abilities of all of the best editors... it will even do speed and size editing (fudgepacking) on its files...

  Dont get your hopes up though, you might just see improved or rewritten Street Scenes or Fudgpackers before then...


                      >>>>>>>>> Appendix <<<<<<<<<<

                     Control 'R'::::[Repeat]::::::::
                    ---------------------------------
 This Control function is used when repeating one Character 3 or more times in
 a horizontal line (ie: Top of a box) it is used like so:

                       -------    AB   --------

    'A' stands for the Actual Character you wish to repeat
    'B' stands for the ascii equivelent of the number of times you want
        it repeated

     (ie: Line of 64 equal signs would be --> =@)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   Control '^':::::::[Position]:::::::
                  -------------------------------------
  This is an easy way to Position the Cursor anywhere on the screen. It is
  used like this:

                          -------  AB  ------

     'A' stands for the Ascii equivelent of the Horizontal position +32
     'B' stands for the Ascii Equivelent of the Vertical position +32


   (ie::Positioning the cursor at ''horizontal=5 and Vertical=5'' would look
        like this:   5+32= 37 / Ascii(37) = %     ----->> %%  real easy!!)
