                               CONGRATULATIONS

You have just purchased a valuable and convenient tool that you will use day
in and day out for as long as you have to remember an appointment, birthday,
holiday, or any date for any reason.  You will also have a complete record of
all appointments, expense records, family medical records, or any type of
information that you wish to keep a chronological record of.
"DateWorks" can be used as an:
                               APPOINTMENT BOOK
                               DIARY
                               EXPENSE LOG
                               FAMILY MEDICAL RECORD
                               DAILY REMINDER
                               T & E LOG
                               TIME LOG AND MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE.

And you can do it all within the incredibly flexible "AppleWorks" database.
What this means is that at a touch of a key or two you can find, sort,
format, add, delete, view, or print your information to suit YOUR specific
needs.

"DateWorks" is a group of "AppleWorks" data templates encompassing 12 years
of dates, days of the week and holidays.  Each file gives you fields for
occasions and 24 appointment or reminder fields.  You can also add any local
holidays, union holidays or anything you want in any field.


1. "DateWorks" is not copy protected.  As with any valuable data or program
   disk, the first thing you should do is make a backup copy.  Use the
   "DUPLICATE DISK" option on your system utilities for that purpose and store
   your original in a safe place.

2. To add a "DateWorks" file to YOUR data disk use the "COPY FILES" option on
   the System Utilities Disk.   Another way to do this is to boot your
   "AppleWorks" program and then  insert your "DateWorks" disk into your data
   drive.  Bring the "DateWorks"  file (year) that you want to the "desktop" in
   the normal manner.  After  you have done this, remove the "DateWorks" disk
   from the data drive and  insert the data disk that you will be using. Using
   option 3 of the  "AppleWorks" Main Menu, put the "DateWorks" file on YOUR
   data disk. CAUTION: DO NOT TRY TO COPY "DateWorks" FILES TO YOUR
   "AppleWorks"  PROGRAM DISK.  "DateWorks" CONTAINS DATA FILES AND MUST GO ON
   YOUR DATA  DISK. For quick and easy access I suggest that you keep the
   current "DateWorks"  year on the "Desktop" whenever using "AppleWorks".

3. Your "DateWorks" screen looks like this in the "single record layout".:

The "DATE" and "DAY" fields contain data for the years 1986 thru 1997.   The
"HOLIDAY" field contains all "legal" Holidays in effect at the time  of the
latest version of "DateWorks" plus the more widely recognized  holidays.  You
may add any local, union, school or any holiday that  effects you or your
geographical area. The "OCCASION" field is for entering birthdays,
anniversaries or any  other occasion that you would not want to forget.

You may change the category names or any other part of the "DateWorks" screen
that you want to change.  Use the "OPEN APPLE - N" to enter the "CHANGE
NAME/CATEGORY" screen and and follow the instructions on the  screen. If you
need further help, press "OPEN APPLE ?" from the  "REVIEW/ADD/ENTER" screen.

These are only a few samples of the way you can change the screen to suit your
needs.  Let your creativity and requirements be your guide.  The possibilities
are virtually unlimited.

4,  I have prepared 4 basic printer formats for you.  You may want to prepare
your own.  Refer to your Appleworks Manual for additional help in  preparing
printer formats.

The four printer formats which I have prepared for you are:

                                     APPOINTMENTS
                                     HOLIDAYS
                                     OCCASIONS
                                     ALL ENTRIES

For each of the formats note the record selection rules on the top of the
"REPORT FORMAT" screen and you will see the criteria the format uses to
select the records.  You may change the record selection rules from the
same menu simply by pressing "OPEN APPLE R" from the same screen.


                            A WORD ABOUT HOLIDAYS

I have researched holidays through a number sources and checked and double
checked my work until I was sure that the information was accurate.  THINGS
CHANGE!!   It is possible that new holidays may be added or the formulas used
to determine on what day a particular holiday be observed will be changed.  I
STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU TAKE A MOMENT OR TWO AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR
TO COMPARE THE HOLIDAY SCHEDULE IN "DateWorks" WITH A CURRENT HOLIDAY
CALENDAR.

Everybody does not celebrate the same holidays.  Depending on your religion,
geographical location, union membership, and various other factors, you may
choose to either observe or ignore the listed holidays.  You may enter any
holiday in the "HOLIDAY" field and you can just as easily delete any holiday
that appears. Technically there are no national holidays in the United States.
Each of the  states has jurisdiction over its holidays which are designated by
legislative  enactment or executive proclamation.  In practice however, most
states  observe the Federal Public Holidays even though the President and
Congress  can legally designate holidays only for the District of Columbia and
for  Federal employees. When a holiday falls on a Sunday or a Saturday, it is
usually observed on the  following monday or preceding Friday.  For some
holidays, government and  business closing practices vary. In most states, the
office of the Secretary  of State can provide details of holiday closings.

In most states the following will be legal public holidays as of 1986:

               NEW YEARS DAY           PRESIDENTS DAY (WASHINGTONS BIRTHDAY)
               MEMORIAL DAY            INDEPENDENCE DAY
               LABOR DAY               COLUMBUS DAY
               VETERANS DAY            THANKSGIVING DAY
               CHRISTMAS

I have also included holidays that are generally observed by most
geographical areas and religious faiths, they are:

               LINCOLNS BIRTHDAY       ST VALENTINES DAY
               ST PATRICK'S DAY         MARTIN LUTHER KING JR DAY
               MOTHERS DAY             ARMED FORCES DAY
               MEMORIAL DAY            FATHERS DAY
               FLAG DAY                VICTORIA DAY (CANADA)
               CANADA DAY              HALLOWEEN
               ELECTION DAY            ASH WEDNESDAY
               PALM SUNDAY             EASTER SUNDAY
               GOOD FRIDAY             UNITED NATIONS DAY
               1ST DAY OF PASSOVER     1ST DAY OF ROSH HASHANA
               YOM KIPPUR              1ST DAY OF HANUKKAH

    The word "OBSERVED" is used next to holidays that do not occur on the
anniversary of the event or the anniversary of the persons birthday.  Instead
they occur on a day that is designated by a pre-determined formula.  For
example, Washingtons Birthday which is actually February 22 is always
celebrated on the 3rd Monday in February (PRESIDENTS DAY).

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT DATEWORKS OR THE APPLEWORKS DATABASE, PLEASE
DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL.
