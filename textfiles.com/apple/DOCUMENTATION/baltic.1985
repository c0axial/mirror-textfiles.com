INTRODUCTION TO BALTIC 1985: 
THE  SOVIET  OFFENSIVE  INTO  SOUTHERN  GERMANY HAS BEEN HALTED AT THE
RHINE AFTER BITTER FIGHTING.  IN THE PERSIAN GULF, THE BATTLE FOR  THE
OILFEILDS HAS PAUSED, AS BOTH SIDES RESUPPLY. 

SATELLITE   AND  OTHER  INTELLIGENCE  REPORTS  SHOW  WIDESPREAD  CIVIL
DISOBEDIENCE IN WARSAW, GDANSK, AND OTHER POLISH CITIES.  SOME EASTERN
EUROPEAN UNITS HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED  AS  UNRELIABLE  BY  THEIR  SOVIET
ALLIES,   AND   SOVIET   RESERVES  HAVE  BEEN  SENT  TO  SUPPRESS  THE
REBELLIONS. 

RADIO REPORTS FROM BERLIN, BREAKING THROUGH  INTENSE  SOVIET  JAMMING,
SHOW  THAT  AMERICAN INFANTRY UNITS, BYPASSED BY THE SOVIET BLITZKRIEG
INTO SOUTHERN GERMANY, ARE STILL HOLDING OUT IN THE  SUBURBS  OF  WEST
BERLIN. 

IN  THE  NATO BATTLEFIELD HEADQUARTERS, THE NATO COMMANDER REVIEWS THE
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS, MEETS WITH HIS STAFF, AND ISSUES THESE ORDERS: 

NATO UNITS ARE TO DRIVE SOUTH EAST,  SEIZE  AND  HOLD  A  CORRIDOR  TO
BERLIN,  LINKING  UP  WITH THE NATO UNITS HOLDING OUT THERE, BEFORE HE
SOVIETS CAN BRING IN THEIR RESERVES. 

AT  0400  THE  NEXT  MORNING,  TACTICAL  AIR  SUPPORT   FIGHTERS   AND
FIGHTER-BOMBERS  TAKE  OFF FROM THEIR AIRFIELDS.  AIRBOURNE UNITS DROP
STRATEGICALLY ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO SEIZE KEY OBJECTIVES.   NATO  MAIN
BATTLE   TANKS   AND  ARMORED  PERSONNEL  CARRIERS  ROLL  THROUGH  THE
CHECKPOINT S AND THE WRE FENCES ALONG THE EAST GERMAN BORDER,  ON  THE
ROAD TO BERLIN. OPERATION BALTIC HAS BEGUN.

                       \_____/   


[NOTE]:THE  CURSOR  ([*]) CAN MOVE UP, DOWN, OR DIAGONALY INTO ANY ONE
