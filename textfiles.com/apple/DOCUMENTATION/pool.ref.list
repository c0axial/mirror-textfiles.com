TABLE OF EXPERIENCE PER LEVEL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following shows the amount of experience a character must earn to gain a
level in his character class.  All experience earned by multiple-class
characters is divided by the number of classes.  When a character has earned a
gain in level for one class but not another, the Show command shows the highest
level.  Thus, a character who is a fighter-thief and has earned 1,800 experience
points in each class (a total of 3,600 XP), will be shown to be 2nd level
because he has earned that level as a thief, though not as a fighter.  His
fighting abilities are still based on his being a 1st level fighter.

CLERICS vs. UNDEAD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A good or evil cleric (not a neutral one) has a certain influence on undead.  He
extends this influence by using the Turn command in the Combat Menu.  His level
determines how many undead and what kind he can influence.  Evil clerics can
make undead either neutral of friendly to the party.  Good clerics can drive the
undead away and may be able to destroy them if the cleric is of a high enough
level and the undead are of a low-enough level.

The following is a list of undead in increasing order of power and what minimum
level of cleric a character has to be to have any influence over them.  Low
level clerics generally have a chance, not a certainty, of affecting undead.
