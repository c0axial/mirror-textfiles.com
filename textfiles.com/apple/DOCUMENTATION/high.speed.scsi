Apple II High Speed SCSI Card
 
Copyright 1990, Apple Computer, Inc.
 
The Apple II SCSI card significantly increases data transfer speed between
Apple II personal computers and SCSI devices such as hard disk and CD-ROM
drives.  The card works with the Apple IIe and Apple IIGS personal computers
and is compatible with all SCSI devices.  It provides the fastest data
throughput possible for Apple II users.  Using direct memory access (DMA) data
transfer, if offers speed improvements of up to 10 times faster than that of
the previous Apple II SCSI Card, which it replaces.  The new card also comes
with software utilities for use with hard disk and CD-ROM drives.
 
Users with a hard disk drive and the new SCSI Card will see a significant speed
improvement when using large software applications, such as AppleWorks GS, or
large data files.
 
Features and benefits include:
 
¥  DMA Data Transfer -- on the Apple IIGS computer, data can be transferred at
a rate of up to 1MB per second.  On the Apple IIe computer, data can be
transferred at a rate of up to .5MB per second. There are four switches on the
card.  One is used to set DMA on or off. The other three are used to set the
SCSI identification number of the card Ñ each SCSI device, including the
computer, is set to a unique number from 0-7.
 
¥ SCSI Compatibility -- compatible with all SCSI devices, the Apple II
High-Speed SCSI Card requires only that device-specific applications and
drivers be installed on the system.  The card comes with drivers and
applications for hard disk and CD-ROM drives.
 
¥  On-Board Terminator -- simplifies setup for the user when connecting SCSI
devices to the computer.The user simply places one terminator at the end of the
chain of SCSI devices.
 
¥  Utilities -- comes with improved hard disk utilities that partition and
verify hard disks, and backup information.  The Partition and Verify utilities
take advantage of the improved firmware commands for hard disk drives.  The
Backup utility is now able to handle the resource forks that are part of the
IIGS files.  These are all ProDOS utilities and can be used by both Apple IIe
and Apple IIGS users.  In addition, the CD-ROM desk accessory for the Apple
IIGS, CD-Remote, comes with the card.
 
System Requirements
 
The Apple II High-Speed SCSI Card works on an Apple IIGS personal computer
or an Apple IIe computer with a 65C02 microprocessor (note: older Apple IIe's,
that have a 6502 microprocessor, will need to upgrade with an Apple IIe
Enhancement Kit).  The Apple IIGS requires a 3.5-inch disk drive, while the
Apple IIe requires either a 5.25- or 3.5-inch disk drive.  Both require a
device with a SCSI port, appropriate SCSI cabling, and one SCSI terminator.
 
There is no upgrade program for owners of the previous Apple II SCSI Card.
