Docking: 210 Nautical Mile in Space.
------------------------------------

Objective: You are attempting to dock with a satellite that is
traveling at Mach 23.9, several hundred nautical miles above the
Earth. You will have to slow down or speed up to reduce distance (X
axis) to 0. Also you will have to be at the same altitude (Z axis)
and position (Y axis). All of these movements are interrelated -
changing one can affect the others. And in flight mode #3, time is
important because the longer you take, the more fuel you consume. To
save fuel, tap the joystick instead of holding it in a control
position.

Docking Checklist.
------------------

Maneuvering in Space: There are 2 different ways to maneuver the
shuttle in orbit. For major maneuvers (30 nautical miles or more),
the Orbit Maneuvering System (OMS) can be used. This system takes
some study and experience to use effectively. So when first starting
out, use the Reaction Control System (RCS). Its clusters of rocket
engines in the shuttle's nose and tail can move the shuttle about its
three major axes (X, Y, Z).

-     To use the OMS, press "R" to activate ROT (rotational engine).
      Lean joystick left or right to affect Yaw, forward or back to
      affect Pitch. Press fire button to fire engine.
-     To use RCS, press "T" to activate TRH (transitional engine).
      Lean joystick left or right to affect Y axis, forward or back
      to affect speed (and X axis), forward or back while pressing
      fire button to affect altitude (Z axis).

Shuttle Speed and Position: Speed is just as important as position.
Never allow your speed to drop below Mach 170 or your altitude to
fall below 195 nautical miles, or you'll burn up in the atmosphere!
Your X axis relationship to the satellite depends on your speed,
which is affected by your engine. To overtake the satellite when it
is ahead of you (when the X axis value is positive), your speed must
be greater than 23.9. As you make your final approach t the
satellite, keep speed close to Mach 23.9

Drifting: As you near the satellite, continually recheck all axes.
The satellite's movement is erractic, settings will shift. When RCS
is active (TRN is on), press "X", "Y", or "Z" to display current
status of those axes. Press the SPACEBAR at any time to check
position, remaining fuel, mission elapsed time, and pitch and yaw.

"S" Curve: On the Ground Track Screen, the "S" line indicates both
the satellite's and the shuttle's ground track around the Earth. The
shuttle's position is the solid dot, the flashing dot is the target
satellite. Notice as you track the satellite, that your X axis
(distance between shuttle and satellite) will suddenly change
significantly as the satellite wraps around the tracking line. This
is because the orbital tracking line wraps around the display as a
real orbit would wrap around the earth.

Docking Screen: Use the "S" curve screen until you get fairly close
to the satellite. Then 2 smaller radar screens will appear. The left
screen shows your Z axis (up-down), and a wide view of your Y axis
(left-right). The right screen, which you'll use more, shows the X
axis and micro (close in) Y axis.

Satellite Sighting: When you see the satellite, prepare to conduct
close range maneuvers with the RCS (TRN engine on).

Multiple Docking: Every time you dock (in flight #3), you receive a
"Rendezvous" signal and some additional fuel units. Each additional
docking becomes more difficult, so the amount of fuel you get
increases. After each rendezvous, the satellite moves away from the
shuttle. Wait until it is at least 80 units (X axis) away before
attempting to dock again, or the satellite will interfere with the
shuttle's signals.

Docking Sequence: Match the position of the shuttle with that of the
satellite by correcting Z, Y and X axes, preferably in that order.

1) Press "T" to activate RCS Transitional.

2) Correct Z axis to 0. Press button and move joystick forward or
back. A negative number means the satellite is below you. A positive
number means the satellite is above you. A zero reading means you
altitude is the same as the satellites's.

3) Correct Y axis to 0. Move joystick to the right or left. A
positive number means the satellite is right of you. A negative
number means the satellite is to the left of you.

4) Correct X axis. Move the joystick forward or back. A positive
number shows the distance, in units, that the satellite is ahead of
you. A negative number shows units the satellite is behind you. To
increase shuttle speed, move joystick. Likewise, move joystick back
to decrease speed. The satellite's speed is Mach 23.9.

5) When you meet the satellite, all axes must be adjusted to 0 and
stabilized for 2 seconds. Then you will receive a "Rendezvous"
signal, indicating that you've docked.


Deorbit Burn.
-------------

Objective: To turn shuttle around, fire engines and decelerate to the
correct speed for leaving orbit. This is one of the most critical
phases of you flight.

During deorbit operations, the shuttle is oriented to a tail-first
altitude, decelerating to reentry speed by the powerful OMS engine,
then turned around to a nose-first altitude.

You begin to lose altitude when you've slowed the shuttle down below
the speed needed to sustain orbit at 210 nautical miles.

Deorbit Burn Maneuver: First you must turn the shuttle around so this
it is traveling tailfirst. Then in order to maintain the correct
altitude, set your Z axis and pitch. Once this maneuver is completed,
fire the engine to decelerate. If the Z axis and pitch are not set
correctly, firing the engine will make you shuttle climb or dive.
After the deorbit burn, the shuttle must then be reoriented
nose-first to the correct altitude. Entering the atmosphere backwards
will cause the shuttle to burn up!

Yaw: Left-right rotation of the nose of the shuttle.

Sequence for Deorbit Burn:
1) Adjust Z axis until altitude reads 210.
2) Pull joystick back or push forward to set speed to Mach 23.9.
3) Press "R" to activate OMS (rotational).
4) Turn shuttle around completely. Move joystick left or right to set
   Yaw at 180.
5) Set pitch at -004.
6) Press joystick button until speed is Mach 19.0.
7) Turn shuttle around nose-first be setting Yaw to 0.


Reentry.
--------

Objective: To establish and maintain the correct pitch, yaw and
speed, follow the correct trajectory, and properly manage heat
build-up during reentry. There are 3 important stages to reentry:
Entry interface, TAEM and LOS. Position, altitude, velocity, and
heading must all be exact to both to manage the tremendous
heat buildup and correctly position your shuttle for the final
approach.

Entry Interface: This is the point in your flight where atmospheric
entry officially begins. As the shuttle descends, atmospheric drag
dissipates tremendous energy, generating a great deal of heat. This
heat quickly builds up. Pitch and speed must be correct to
utilize the shuttle's thermal protection system.

Terminal Area Energy Management: After entry interface, you must
closely follow the proper descent trajectory in order to maintain
enough altitude and speed to reach the final touchdown point. This
process of conserving your energy by maintaining the correct
position, altitude, velocity and heading is called Terminal Area
Energy Management (TAEM).

Loss of Signal: During reentry, the shuttle superheats the gas of the
upper atmosphere creating flashes of color outside your window. Heat
strips electrons from the air around the shuttle., enveloping it in a
sheath of ionized air that blocks all communications with the ground.
So at 140 miles, you will experience a temporary partial loss of
signal (LOS). Keep a close eye on your radar at this point. You will
receive intermittent signals which you need to use to correct your
course and plane.

Descent Screens: On your reentry screen, "X" indicates cut-off of
your OMS engines (deorbit burn). "T" indicates the terminal area
energy management phase. "L" indicates your transition to final
landing approach. The small box at left is your plane indicator.

Reentry Sequence:
1) Pull back joystick to set +24 pitch for proper reentry altitude.

2) Close cargo bay doors.

3) Follow reentry course on computer screen. Pull stick back to go
right. Push forward to go left. Left and right on the stick centers
plane.


Landing: Edwards Air Force Base.
--------------------------------

Landing Sequence:
1) Watch for the runway. Use the right radar screen to maintain
alignment.

2) Follow final approach course on both computer screens. Left
screen: keep dot centered between the two arched lines. Right screen:
keep dot centered on straight runway approach line. Pull Joystick
back to raise nose (slow decent). Push joystick left or right to keep
dot centered.

3) When range become negative, you're over the runway, just seconds
from touchdown, so drop landing gear now.

4) Push joystick forward to lower nose.

5) When the shuttle hits the runway, your nose will prop up, so keep
your joystick pushed forward to keep nose down until you hear the
thud of the front landing gear.
