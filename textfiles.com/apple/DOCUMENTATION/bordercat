This program allows you to make catalogs of all your Print Shop borders.  These catalogs are saved as HiRes screens, and can be printed using THE PRINT SHOP's Screen Magic option.

When the progam runs, the first question it will ask you is how many drives you have.  If you have two, place the disk containing the borders you wish to catalog (several are included with this issue) into drive #1, and a disk for saving these catalogs in drive #2.  If you only have one drive, place the borders disk in the drive; the program will prompt you to insert the data disk and the borders disk as needed.

The borders disk is then read, and your pictures are placed on a clean HiRes screen.  Up to 12 borders can fit on one screen.  After each screen is filled it is saved to disk, and the process is repeated until all borders have been processed.

^Note 1:@ You will supply a name for your screen images (catalogs).  The program saves the files in the following manner:  VOL yourname#  where 'yourname' is the name you supplied, and '#' is the sequential number of the screen.  For example, let's say you have 20 borders, and have said you want the catalogs to be named "PHRED".  You will have the following screens saved:

        VOL PHRED1
        VOL PHRED2

^Note 2:@ Once you commit yourself to doing a catalog of your borders the [ESC] function will no longer work.  The only way out other then pressing [CONTROL]-[RESET] is to let the program run its course.
