TRAX:   A  track  examination  program.  TRAX will read a track from a
diskette in its "raw" pre-nibbilized form and format it on the screen,
attempting to pick out the sector  formatting,  such  as  a  protected
diskette  or  one  which  has  been  damaged  in  some  way, TRAX will
highlight its anomolies. TRAX is also useful in conjunction  with  the
INIT  program to determine the physical order or skewing of sectors on
a diskette.

INIT:  The INIT program can be used to reformat a single  track  on  a
diskette, a range of tracks, or the entire diskette. In addition, INIT
will  optionally  attempt  to  preserve  the  contents of any readable
sector it finds before reformatting. Thus, INIT can be used to  fix  a
single  sector  whose  formatting  has  been damaged so that it can no
longer be read from or written to. This avoids  having  to  initialize
the  entire  diskette  with the DOS INIT command. INIT will also allow
you to specify the order of the sectors on any given track. doing this
can improve disk read times by about 40%. 

               INIT OPTIONS
               ============

Disk Sectoring: 
    THIS VALUE IS THE NUMBER OF SECTORS PER TRACK. THE OPTIONS ARE  13
    OR 16. 
    
Disk  Format:  This is the type of operating system being used on this
    diskette. 
    
Preserve Data:  This question asks whether the data currently on  your
    diskette should be preserved. 
Skew Direction: 
     This prompt indicates the direction of
     the skewing to be used. 
Skew  Factor:  This is the spacing placed between logically sequential
    sectors during formatting. 
    
Slot:  The number of the slot occupied by your disk  drive  controller
    card. 
    
Drive:  The drive number of your disk drive. 
    
Volume  Number:  This is the volume number that will be used to format
    your diskette. 
    
Starting Track:  The track number upon which formatting is to start. 
    
Ending Track:  The last track to be formatted.

ZAP:  ZAP in its simplest sense  allows  you  to  read  and  modify  a
diskette  at  the  track  and  sector  level. A sector may be read and
displayed in hexadecimal  and  ascii  and,  optionally,  modified  and
rewritten  to  the disk. ZAP provides over 50 commands, including some
programmability with  macros,  labels,  and  loops,  allowing  you  to
perfrom  complex  manipulations on diskettes.  full support exists for
DOS files of all types, CP/M files, and Pascal files as well.  ZAP  is
perhaps  the  most  complex of the four programs but you will probably
find you use it most heavily.

FIXCAT:  The fixcat program is an automated utility which  allows  you
to  diagnose  and  correct  errors  in  the  catalog  track of any DOS
diskette. In addition, it takes the Find Track/ Sector  lists  program
(FTS)  of Beneath Apple DOS a step further by actually recovering lost
files on a diskette automatically!  Fixcat  will  also  allow  you  to
remove the DOS image from track 1 and 2 to provide more room for files
and will recover lost sectors by correcting the VTOC freespace map. 

               
               FIXCAT MESSAGES
               ===============

Display in what slot? 

If  you  wish  to  have  fixcat  display its message only on the Apple
screen, enter 0 (the default). If you want them to  be  printed  on  a
printer, give the slot number of your printer here. 


Automatic Timeout in Seconds? 

Enter  0  (the  default)  if  you  want FIXCAT to always wait for your
response to each question it asks. If you specify a number of seconds,
in the other hand, each time FIXCAT prompts you  for  a  response,  it
will  wait  that  number  if seconds before taking the default as your
answer. 


What Format is Your Diskette? 

If your diskette is 16 sector format, type 16 (the default). If it  is
an older 13 sector diskette, type 13. 


Read  existing  catalog  from  diskette or start from scratch? ("R" or
"S")

If your catalog is at all intact, specify  R  (the  default)  to  have
FIXCAT  use  it as a basis for its operations.  Only if there is not a
single valid sector left in the catalog should  you  specify  "S".  In
this  case, FIXCAT will start with a zeroed out catalog track and will
build it up from scratch. 


Does this diskette contain a DOS image on tracks 0, 1, and 2? 

If this is a standard, bootable disk, reply Y (the  default).  If  you
want  to  recover  track  1  and  2  for  your own and never boot this
diskette again, reply N. Also reply N if you have previosly  recovered
these tracks using FIXCAT. 


Scan for Lost or Deleted Files? 

If  you  do  not  think  you  have  any  missing  files,  reply N (the
default).  If you wish to have FIXCAT search the entire  diskette  for
"unattached" track/ sector list sectors, type Y. 


Recover This File? 

If  you  think that this is a file you want, reply Y (the default). If
the file looks like an old deleted file you no  longer  wanted,  reply
N. 


What type of File is it? (T,I,A,B,R,S)

If you were able to identify the file, you probably know its file type
as  well.  If  not,  FIXCAT  will prompt you with a pretty good guess.
You'll find that FIXCAT will be correct in its guess about 95% of  the
time.  If  the  wrong file type is given and you later detect this you
can delete the file and rerun FIXCAT, supplying a different type  this
time. 


Apply Accumulated Corrections to the VTOC/Catalog Track? 

Reply  Y  if  you  want the corrections you have authorized up to this
point to be applied to the catalog track on your diskette. Reply N  if
you  want to forget the whole thing and not change your diskette after
all.
