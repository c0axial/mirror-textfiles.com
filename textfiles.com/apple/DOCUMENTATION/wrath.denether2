Hints for the Wrath of Denethenor by the Nudge

Don't get lost, go to the Gargoyle!
Pass through with Netrelon
Ask lord Mirrih, he might be able to help you
Speak to the Backwoods hermit of torches
The Bank of Deledain knows who they work for
Doors are so charming
FireTrench can take you a long way
Exit Nisondel on a western Island
Look for a different way out of the Dark
Silver reflects
Find a harbour & take to the seas
Solrain, Mirrih, & Estrine are the real conspirators
A mages intelligence echoes in the staying power of his spells
Use Wethrir wisely - master it befor learning higher powers
There is but one spell that will still the waters
Don't get caught in a field of light
One of Limbar's warriors will help you
The Wizards of CastleDrawn will help you
Demons can smell their pray
That's why he's the Lord
Limbar wi8ll get me out
Someday the truth wi8ll be revealed & they will praise him
You can't hide from a demon!
I've got a Specer's Atlas
Look in the stone
Don't move in the Dark
I say its just a myth
You can hide behind your spells
He who goes unseen & speaks unheard is the strongest
Our chef's cooking sucks
You are doomed
With aQ
All magic is released by the spoken word
The very words which cast the illusion will dispell the source
So it is written...
Look even beyond Cestiona
Lost?  Find a scroll
Demon Glow can easily be cast or dispelled
But why?   (ed. Good question!!)
I'm afraid our boss isn't too hospitable to strangers
Seek a Western exit
Don't bother with the Hotel Pescara; they don't take drifters
I know something you don't!
The Demon's glow is just a form of magic
Across the channel!
Have you heard the truth?
I've got friend's coming to get me out
Take me with you!  I can show you the Western door!
Limbar's nothing more than a Lunatic
Many treasures lie in the hole
There's lots of gold to be had
The citizens of En Siev have dug in
Every spell drains energy from the wielder
Look beneath the ruins of En Siev
Isn't this a great condo?
Move in you own dimension with Monsrol
En Siev is a heathen city
I've seen the Graveyard at Shadowmere
Go in at Midnight, come out at Mystenor
Learn Hexerei in CastleDrawn
Things can change at midnight
I hate raw fish
Ask of Clien at Karibae
The seven towers of Castle Denethena have darkened
I know of CastleDrawn: sanctuary of magic
I crossed Death Meadow!
You'll find Janai in the isles of Bregalad
He used his ower only in defense - seek Bhui in the Dungeon
Seek our Lord Mirrih
Have you learned Specere
Seek help of those imprisoned unjustly
Open your eyes and the myth w8ill vanish
Death Meadow is impassable - but you must cross
If it won't open, pass through
One of Limbar's warriors knows something
You ski?
Castle Denethena was rebuilt
Clien is on the Lake
A more powerful spell is more tiring
Not so!  I've seen the castle
His old castle in Mystenor is completely deserted
Estrine's men destroyed the castle
You won't find him there
It's on an isle surrounded by magic
He fled from his castle to build a remote fortress
2 false entrances, 1 trun: Look south & pass between the caves
Report all suspicious persons
You're not one of then, are you?
The Banshee is floded
Learn of his castle in Swain's
Enter the hole only with great wi8ll
I helped to capture Donovan
All will perish
Janai waits beyond the meadow
Mirrih and Solrain are the true evil: kill them!
Denethenor lives and you, you shall die
I am Bhui.  I know the power of Resonim - speak the word to a wavy light
LaVince is also a disciple
Remove Mirrih from his throne and claim his rule
The name is engraved on a secluded pub
Don't be afraid to use your magic when needed
Ask of Donovan at the Penitentiary
The true exit from the mountain swims in a sea of light
I'm the wealthiest man here!
Stage tricks are but simple spells
You'll always find Aligre near a stage
Seek Shadowmere in Bregalad
You must visit Bregalad someday
There's more than one way to leave Mount Restorn
The crossover occurs at midnight
Search the isles for the ampitheatre
Look south of the mountain
Ever been to the mountain?
Take caution wi8th blanket spells; you may strike a friend
The blanket spell is most draining, but so deadly
Lethren concentrates all your power on a single foe
Remember, Denethor's evil grew from his abuse of the death spells
Like Wethrir, it will shatter upon striking an object
Our Lord has a thing for sharks
Our vault is protected by magic
You will die a fool
All but one passage to Mystenor is useless
You must pass the mountain
The trail is visible only under close inspection
Comb the northern ridge
Red Sands is the link between Shadowmere and Sorie Gulch
The most obvious is rarely the safest
The walls of Mystenor have no passage
Search the Northern ridge for the Mountain
The circular river refuses all but the most experienced
Overcrowded?  Never!  Just keep death row moving
Look for the door in the graveyard
The cavern is only visible in still waters
The fools shall perish
Hemlock can't be found in the wild
His last ditch is off the south coast
Limbar shall rule all
You must pass Mount Restorn
Don't kill the benevolent one
The gate to Restorn is locked by magic
I didn't know the grenade was armed
65 mph isn't that fast
Forget the legend of Donovan - it's a fool's tale
It's just glass on silver
Find him before he finds you!
Beware, silver dust hides, but doesn't protect
Many tricks can be performed with mirrors
When you want to pass unseen, turn off the stage lights
Throw up a little silver dust
Yes, I am Aligre and you seek the knowledge of Inslerete
Even Denethor can be fooled... sometimes.
If he should discover you...well, you won't live long.
Shadowmere hides more than shadows after dark
You wi8ll never defeat him w8ithout Aligres knowledge
Ask at the Banshee of the most deadly
Do not fear the thunder but rather the evil it represents
Move wisely - you have much to learn
Learn to choose your steps wisely
You are closer than ever to mystenor!
He who enters the stench of the cave will not return 
Sorry, no ceremony tonigh
I've volunteered for the next offering
The lighting is a steady reminder of our proximity to the crossover
To pass Red Sands, float the cavern river
Step into his throne
Sorie Gulch feeds the mystical circular river
Janai looks for the one who w8ill cross the meadow
Go in at midnight and come out at mystenor
His fortress lies beyone the meadow
The blanket spell, Desapar, is most deadly - use it only in a desperate
situation
Limbar says I'm gonna be a gerat warrior
Limbar says we're gonna take on mirrih
You will cross twice
I've returned from Death Meadow
Sure, we get cots, Limbar gets a jacuzzi
Don't even think about it
Don't hurt me!
Approach him as the sun does: from the east and like a whisper
You must learn balance, Grasshopper
What chu lookin' at?
He stole my purse!
He stepped on my toe!
He owes me five
He killed Scruffy!
He wasted my family
Approaching invisible will not be enough
The Isles of Bregalad hold many secrets beyond your reach!
To escape Red Sands, you must find that red sand
There are many hidden places among these isles
Attract his attention and you shall perish
Welcome to Shadowmere! and have a severly unpleasant experiance!
Eat this, dirt bag!
Wait till the witching hour.
Welcome visitors!  Feel free to walk about but don't talk to the patients
and stay out of restricted areas
How was your stroll through the graveyard?
I saw toto in the graveyard
Wait for the thunder
Ziped ee doo dah
Stand back you gerbil
Fools Beware, this is Mystenor
This is the Crossing point: Red Sands
These are the walls of Sorie Gulch - within which the mystical river is fed
I guard the entrance to the mystical circular river...
I will not allow your passage!
Welcome to the seven towers of Castle Denethena: Enjoy!
Have a nice stroll through the meadow?
Someday the truth will be revealed and Mirrih dethroned
The other Lords of Deledain are just jealous
This is just an illusion
All is not as it seems
Step into his throne at all costs 
You haven't been listening to fearless leader, have you?
You must step into the throne of the open court!  now!
Go the the open court!
Mirrih is a senile fool - there is no hemlock
Limbar belongs in LaVinces Asylum
An engraving is now visible upn the throne!
A single phrase is etched upon the stone: "UrenDuirEsex"
The enscription fades just as the illusory castle does!  Thus you realize that
your quest is far from complete.
I am Janai... this is the hemlock Lord Mirrih spoke of.  Return it to him,
take care though, its poisonous!
Death awaits...
Isaac knows
Turn back now while you have the chance
You are a fool!
No, not herfe!  Find Isaaac's cell!
I've built a passage to the outer wall!
My Hemlock!  You found some.  You earned your reward!
The sky is falling!
