  INTRODUCTION:

Welcome  to  Middle-earth.  This  is  the  world of Bilbo the hobbit, of
Thorin and Gandalf, of dwarves and  trolls  and  wizards.  This  is  the
magical and mysterious land of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. 

You  are  about  to  play  one of the most sophisticated adventures ever
designed for the microcomputer. Addison-Wesley and Melbourne  House  are
very proud to be able to present the Hobbit Software Adventure, based on
Tolkien's brilliant fantasy novel. 

In the Hobbit Adventure, you play the role of Bilbo Baggins. You will be
able  to  roam  freely  throught Middle-earth, explore and discover this
enchanted land. You will meet all types of creatures, some friendly  and
helpful, others very dangerous. Your adventure will be exciting and will
hold many surprises each time you play. 

If  you  are  unfamiliar with honbbits, you should know that they are "a
little people," about half the size of humans. Since they spend a  great
deal  of their time eating (at least six meals a day), they tend to have
large and fat stomachs. Unlike most creatures of Middle-earth, they  are
not  very  magical, capable of preforming only the most ordinary kind of
trick. Hobbits wear bright-colored clothing but no  shoes,  since  their
feet have leathery soles and thick fur on the tops to protect them. They
are  a quiet and simple folk and do not care for anything unexpected. No
self-respecting hobbit has any use for adventures. 

Like other good hobbits, Bilbo just wanted to be  left  alone  in  quiet
comfort. But there was always a little spark of adventurouness in him, a
tiny  bit  of  the not-entirely-hobbitlike Took-clan, inherited from his
mother, Belladonna Took. Perhaps this was why Bilbo was singled  out  by
the  dwarves  and  mistaken  for  a  burglar,  and  why he found himself
reluctantly agreeing to join Gandalf and Thorin on the  most  incredible
adventure any hobbit could imagine in his most unhobbitlike dreams. 

As  the  adventure  opens,  Gandalf the wizard has talked you (as Bilbo)
into entering a new and exciting adventure  helping  Thorin  the  dwarf.
Your  Mission  is to seek out the evil dragon, return the treasure he is
hoarding to your warm and comfortable hobbit-hole, and  place  it  in  a
chest  for  safekeeping.  As  a  secoundary mission, you must look after
Thorin and protect him. If he should die early in the game, it  is  most
unlikely that you will be able to survive the dangers ahead of you. 

It is also important for you to know that, as a hobbit, you are a rather
small  and  milad  creature, and most others you will meet along the way
will be bigger and  stronger  than  you.  You  will  therefore  need  to
exercise all of your cunning and skill to survive. 

Best of Luck, Bilbo, and may you return with wounderful tales to tell on
a cold winters evening in front of a log fire.

COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROGRAM: 

In  the  Hobbit Adventure, the computer will act as a translator between
you and the program. You will tell the computer what you want to  do  in
Inglish,  and  the  computer  will translate the request and the program
will execute it. 

The computer will also be your source of  information  about  where  you
are,  what  you  can  see, and what other creatures in the adventure are
doing. 

If the computer is not sure of something you mean, or  if  there  is  an
ambiguity  in  your instruction, it will come back to you with questions
for clarification. 

The Hobbit program has a  large  vocabulary  (see  the  section  on  the
Inglish  Language).  It  knows  over  500  words and can preform over 50
different actions (combining verbs and prepositions), so it  is  capable
of very sophisticated communication. The use of Inglish to interact with
the  computer  allows  you  to  enter  your  instructions  in familiarly
structured sentences. 

THE SCREEN DISPLAY: 

The screen display is divided into two windows. The bottom five lines of
the screen are the "communications window." Everything that you type  in
will  be  shown  here.  This  is  also the place where the computer will
indicate when it does not understand something you typed. For  instance,
if you mistype the word door as "DOR," the program will come back with: 

I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WORD "DOR."

Other  messages  will  also appear when the program is unable to execute
your instructions. Each window will scroll independently of the other. 

The rest of the screen is the "adventure window." This is where you will
find out what is happening in the adventure, what you can see, and  what
the other characters are doing and saying. 

The adventure window is displayed on the screen in upper- and lowercase.
Every  action  that  takes place, whether performed by you or one of the
other characters, will be shown here. Descriptions of locations  and  of
objects and their contents, etc., will also be shown. 

Usually,  the  text  that is displayed on this screen is short enough to
fit in one window. Occasionally, however, the screen must scroll to  fit
all of the information. When this happens, the screen will pause and the
word   MORE  will  appear.  Press  any  key  to  see  the  rest  of  the
information. 

The adventure window is also the area where graphics depictions  of  the
various  locations  will appear. Over 80 locations described in the book
are represented in this adventure. When this  happens,  the  bottom  two
lines  of  the adventure window will remain text to let you know what is
happening, and the rest of the window will change to pictures. 

Through the pictures of the  locations  containe  many  details,  it  is
possible  that  Bilbo  can  see  things  and people in the area that you
cannot see on the screen. Don't be decieved by thinking that the  screen
shows everything. It is always a good idea to take a look around.

RULES OF INGLISH

Inglish is one of the most sophisticated language-recoginition  programs
developed  for  the microcomputer. It allows you to communicate with the
program in a language and structure that is familiar to you. 

The rules of Inglish is simple. The main thing to keep in mind  is  that
each  instruction must be in the form of "verb-the-noun," where the noun
(or pronoun) can also be implied. 

Each sentence must have a verb. 

RUN; CLIMB; WAIT

are all valid sentences, with an implied pronoun of "I."

The meaning of the verb may be altered by the use of adverbs. 

RUN QUICKLY
VICIOUSLY BREAK THE DOOR

English grammar applies, and the order of the  different  parts  of  the
sentences is usually not critical. 

WITH THE SWORD CAREFULLY ATTACK THE TROLL

ATTACK THE TROLL CAREFULLY WITH THE SWORD

Adjectives  that  describe nouns must come before the noun. If it sounds
right in English, it is probably valid in Inglish. 

OPEN THE GREEN DOOR is correct, but

OPEN THE DOOR GREEN is not. 

Prepositions usually come before the noun in Inglish. 

ATTACK WITH THE SWORD
PICK UP THE GOLD

The preposition could go before or after some verbs, or even at the  end
of the sentence if it sounds more natural. 

TURN THE LIGHT ON
PICK THE GOLD UP

USE OF AND: 

You  can  use  the  word  AND in all its normal meaning in Inglish. This
means, among other things, that you can enter more than one sentence  or
perform more than one action at a time. 

TAKE THE LAMP AND THE ROPE OUT OF THE BARREL
DROP THE SHORT AND THE LONG SWORD
TAKE THE TREASURE AND RUN

PUNCTUATION: 

Sentences  can  be  separated  by  the  use  of punctuation. You can use
commas, semicolons, and periods as you normally would. 

Quotation marks are used when you are  speaking  to  another  character.
(see the section on Conversing.)

The  only limitation the computer puts on what you can enter is that the
command must not be more than 128 characters long. 

Keep in mind, however, that if you enter a very long instruction,  other
characters in the adventure could use that time their own advantage. 

USE OF EVERYTHING, ALL, EXCEPT: 

It  is  sometimes not convenient to have to enter a long list of objects
when the words EVERYTHING or ALL would suffice.  You  are  able  to  use
these words in Inglish just as you normally would. 

You  may  also  specify  what  you want to manipulate by using EXCEPT in
conjunction with ALL and EVERYTHING. 

EAT EVERYTHING
BREAK ALL THE BOTTLES
OPEN ALL EXCEPT THE GREEN DOOR

LIMITATIONS OF INGLISH: 

To describe an object, you are only able to use the  object's  name  and
its  associated adjectives (if any apply). For instance, if you see some
delicious foamy beer in a bottle, you could say: 

DRINK BEER
or DRINK DELICIOUS BEER
or DRINK FOAMING BEER
or DRINK DELICIOUS FOAMING BEER

all of these would result in quenching your thirst. You cannot, however,
use the position of an object as its description. 

DRINK BEER IN BOTTLE

would not be acceptable. 

You cannot have more than one indirect  object  object  in  a  sentence.
Basically,  this means that you cannot do one thing in more than one way
in the same sentence. 

PUT THE ROPE ON THE TABLE and
PUT THE REOP ON THE CHAIR

are both valid, but

PUT THE ROPE ON THE TABLE OND THE CHAIR

is not. 

By the same general rule, you cannot say things like

ATTACK THE TROLLS WITH EVERYTHING

SPECIAL COMMANDS: 

There are a number of special commands unique to the Hobbit Adventure: 

LOOK (L) gives you a  graphic  depiction  of  your  location.  Then,  by
pressing  a  key,  you  will receive a text description of the location,
including all exits and objects (other than any you are carrying). 

INVENTORY (I) describes everything you are carrying. 

EXAMINE (object) enables you to have a closer look  at  any  object  you
come across. 

WAIT passes the time. 

@  (no  return)  instructs the program to repeat the last command. (This
must always be the first input of a sentence.)

NOPRINT disables the PRINT command. (PRINT and NOPRINT  may  not  be  be
avaliable in all versions. Check your reference card.)

SAVE  allows you to save your current game on disk. After you have saved
the game, play will continue normally. The next time you play,  you  can
pick up where you left off. 

LOAD loads a previously saved game from the disk. 

QUIT restarts the game. 

SCORE tells you what your presentage is so far. 

Pause suspends the game until another key is pressed.
