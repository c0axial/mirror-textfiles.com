You have a choice of two missions, diversion or assault. In the diversion
scenario you attack units for a specified time period and then exit the map to
the south at recall. In the assault scenario you must locate and destroy your
objective. At present, I don't know how to end this scenario.

You also may select one of three standard suits or have one made up to order.
For a custom suit, you are given a certain number of points and each option
costs a varying number of points. The leftover points are used for powering
the suit.
