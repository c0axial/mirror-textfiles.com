 A War in Middle Earth Dox -------------  written by Morgoth

OK, these are the dox for War in Middle Earth.

There are 3 different screen levels.  The top level shows the whole map
of Middle Earth.  This game is icon oriented.  The 3 icons to the side are

orb - tells status off all forces on map
load/save - loads/restores saved game
magnify - allows you to go to the next map level down
hourglass - changes rate at which time goes by

At the middle level, the icons go as follows

orb - tells status of selected party
map - goes to top map level
magnify - allows you to go to the next level down
hourglass - changes rate at which time goes by

At the scene level, the icons are

orb - tells status of party on the screen
map - goes to middle level map
hand/bottle - gets/puts things down


I assume as I haven't seen the dox is to get the ring to Mt. Doom.  To do
so, you have all the good forces at your disposal.  The blinking forces are
yours to do so as you wish.  The non-blinking ones are either your enemies
or neutral forces.  Neutral forces go under your command at different times
of the game or when you get certain magical objects to those groups.

The best way to learn how to play is just dive in.  At first be careful of
the Nazgul.  They'll kick yer ass quickly if they get to Frodo.  You would
be best going to Bree first via Bombadil's house.

To see what a certain place is, just click on it.  If it is important at all,
the game will tell you so.  You can play the game militarily forgetting the
books altogether, or you can play it following the book (which is probably
safest at first).

At some point in time, the protection scheme will ask you for coordinates to
a particular place.  What follows is a list of places and what I believe
to be their coordinates.
