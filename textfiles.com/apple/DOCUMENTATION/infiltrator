                               "THE STORY SO FAR"


The strange little man in the trench coat and Porsche sunglasses seemed a
little out of place.  After all, the unveiling of the new McGibbits Wing of the
Library of Congress(in honor of your 47-volume treatise on the Dewey decimal
system) was a strictly formal affair.  You paid little notice to him at the
time, however as you moved gracefully to the piano in your McGibbits Trim-Fit
bulletproof jeans.  As you started into the third movement of your piano
Concerto No.2 in E, you heard a whisper in your ear: "We need you Jimbo baby!
The whole world is in danger and only a super-soldier, ace helicopter pilot,
ballistics expert, engineer, neurosurgeon, politician, movie actor, rock star,
world-class motorcyclist, explorer, karate expert, and devil-may-care all
around nice guy like you can save the day!)

"Not again!" you thought to yourself as you finished up the concerto,
christened the library, and leapt onto your Super Gizmo 8 motorcycle with
cruise control, AM/FM, auto seat warmer, and heat-seeking missiles) all in one
fluid move.  "Its; getting so I barely have any time to myself what with that
Mad Leader running around!"

Back at your modest country estate/training grounds/experimental aircraft test
facility, you quickly solve the prime-key encrypted note the agent left with
you(lucky thing one of your doctorates is in combinatorial mathematics and
cryptography!)
                                        
                                        
                                  "TOP SECRET"


Message to:  Captain Johnny "Jimbo-Baby" McGibbits/AKA Infiltrator

    Captain,

We need you! The world is on the brink of destruction only you save us.  The
Whizbang Enterprises Gizmo DHX-1 Attack Helicopter is on the pad.  The mad
leader must be stopped only you can stop him.  Stop him at all costs.  Enclosed
is a Gizmo Flight Manual, secret communication code names, and other mission
info, weapons, film(with pre-paid processing mailer), and the McGibbits Guide
to Ground Installation Infiltration(Pocket Edition).


Good luck Jimbo-Baby!- The fate of the world is in your hands!


                   Brigidier General Bunson "Old Blood -n- Guts"

                   O'Shaughnessy"

"So what else is new?" you say as you gather your gear and head out to the
waiting Gizmo.  "I guess this afternoon's open-heart surgery will have to wait.
I hope the patient can."  And whistling the theme from your new TV series, you
head out to save the world....

You will begin all of your missions from you Home Base, just beyond the border
of the country.  At the base, you will be briefed about your mission goal just
before takeoff.  You must successfully pilot your chopper from Home Base
through enemy airspace and reach one of the Mad Leader's installations to
complete the ground mission assigned during the briefing.  There are a total of
3 missions, each progressively more difficult, in keeping with your growing
skill, stature, and worldwide acclaim.  Good Luck!


                             "OWNER'S FLIGHT MANUAL"
                                        


Welcome to the Whizbang Family

you should be feeling pretty good right now.  You've just purchased a Whizbang
Enterprises

Gizmo  DHX-1 Attack chopper

Which is known affectionately around here at Whizbang as "The Snuffmaster"
Welcome once again to our family.


"WE THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT"


Your new Whizbang Gizmo DXH-1 Attack Chopper is loaded with the following
Whizbang goodies:

* Turbine-Thrust Dual Propulsion Whizbang Whirler engine, capable of a top  
speed in excess of 450 knots
* Four Whizbang Waster air-to-air heat seeking missiles
* Two rapid-fire Whizbang Whizzer 20 mm cannons
* Anti-heat seeking missile magnesium flares
* Anti-radar guided missile chaff disperser
* Whizang Whomper turbo booster

* Whizbang Whisper silent travel capabilities


                              "TAKEOFF PROCEDURES"


Upon entering the cockpit of your Gizmo, you will find yourself facing an ultra
sophisticated array of controls.  Through the windshield you can see the Home
Base.  At the bottom of the screen, note your hands holding the control sticks
which control the movement of the chopper.  You might wish to take off after
you finish admiring your manicure, so here are the instructions.

1.  Turn the battery on by pressing the "B" key.
2.  Initialize the computer and communication systems by pressing the "S" key. 
The computer screens will light up and the warning lights will initialize      
at the top of the display.
3.  Turn on the engine ignition by pressing the "I" key.  The engine will not  
provide enough power for movement until it exceeds 2300 rpm's. 
4.  Pull back on the joystick until you have cleared your base and are looking 
at a green landscape with mountains in the distance.
5.  Press the FIRE BUTTON (note that your right and on the display registers   
this) and push forward to accelerate.

                                "COCKPIT DISPLAY"


ARTIFICIAL HORIZON  (lower-middle gauge on main panel)
The artificial horizon indicates your present altitude (degree of tilt or bank)
and indicates whether you are climbing or diving by the location of the horizon
is level and centered in the gauge, you are flying straight and level.

DIRECTIONAL COMPASS  (lower-right gauge on main panel)
The compass displays the directional heading of the Gizmo in degrees, shown in
both analog and digital format.  The dial is accurate within 23 degree
increments;  the digital readout is accurate to smaller values.

FUEL GAUGE (far right of side panel)
This horizontal bar displays remaining fuel.  The tank is empty when the red
bar disappears.

OIL AND BATTERY TEMP (on vary top of chopper)
These two bar graphs at the top of the screen display the temperatures of your
battery and oil.  When the bar reaches the red zone, heat is critical and the
the temperature warning lights will flash and beep until you reduce the heat
(by slowing your speed to reduced strain on the battery or by turning off the
turbo to conserve oil).

WARNING LIGHTS (on vary top of middle of chopper)
The six warning lights at the top of the cockpit, when flashing red while a
buzzer sounds, indicate:

 E ngine damaged
 B attery overheated 
 O il overheated
 F uel low
 A ltitude level below 200 ft.
 R pm deficiency in engine or rotors

The warning lights will alert you to any noteworthy status conditions that
require immediate attention.  You have some direct control over the B, O, and A
warning lights.  The E, F, and R lights refer to problems that cannot be
corrected mid-flight.  In these cases, you might want to readch your
destination as quickly as possible and avoid an further damage from air combat.
   
AIRSPEED INDICATOR (top-left on main panel)
This dial shows the Gizmo's present airspeed, in knots.  The digital readout
under the dial displays the same information.  Maximum speed is 450 knots
(without the turbo engaged)

ADF(top-middle of main panel)
The Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) will aid you in arriving at the proper
destination.  Therefore, you may want to program it immediately after takeoff.
Once programmed, the ADF always points towards your destination.  If you are
moving forward and the ADF points straight up, you will eventually reach your
target, regardless of the compass heading.  Moving off course will cause the
ADF to spin, adjusting itself to the Gizmo's orientation.  The ADF will move
only when you spin the helicopter or when you bank.  To correct the orientation
of your helicopter so it is heading toward the destination, you can either spin
the chopper (for minor heading changes) or bank (for more drastic changes in
direction).

Note that if the adf is blinking on and off, it has not been properly
programmed at the communications terminal.  (see communications.)
If the ADF is flashing black and white and moving around radically!!! then your
directly over your destination.  You should slow down and proceed to land
immediately.  (see Landing Procedures.)

ALTIMETER (top-right of main panel)
The altimeter displays your present altitude in feet.  The hand on the dial is
accurate only within jumps of 60 feet or more, so use the digital reading for
greater accuracy.  Each time the dial sweeps past 12:00, it registers 1000 ft.
Maximum altitude is limited to 8000 ft.  If your altitude is below 200 ft., the
low altitude warning light and buzzer will sound.

RPM INDICATOR (bottom-left of main panel)
The RPM indicator displays the rate at which the blades are spinning. 
Helicopter blades do not speed up or slow down to maintain a constant rate
since it is the angle tilt of the blades that causes the movement.  The onboard
computer systems monitor and maintain steady rpm's. Optimum RPM's is 2300. No
flying can take place until RPM's are at or above optimum. At this time the
takeoff alert will sound until the Gizmo is airborne

MISSILE WARNING LIGHTS (far-left of main panel)
The missile warning lights, to the left of your instrument panel, flash to
indicate that a missile is heading toward your chopper.  A warning siren will
sound as well.  If the R light is on, then a Radar guided missile is heading
towards the chopper, and chaff must then be used to decoy it.  If then H light
is on , then a Heat seeking missile is headed towards the Gizmo, and flares
must be used to decoy it.


                                   "ARMAMENTS"


The next four items are represented by buttons that flash when set to active
and are found on the lower left and lower right bottom of the cockpit.  Once
armed, they can be activated by pressing and releasing the FIRE BUTTOn on the
joystick.  Any or all of these may be damaged or rendered inoperable by enemy
fire.

CANNONS-The Whizbang Whizzer 20mm cannons are armed by pressing C(gun) key.  An
enemy in the HUD(heads up display) cross hairs may be damaged or destroyed if
you fire upon it.  You have unlimited ammunition.

MISSILES-Pressing the R(rocket) key arms the Whizbang Waster air-to-air heat
seeking missiles.  An enemy must be visible to be hit, but it doesn't have to
be in the cross hairs.  You are limited to four(4) missiles per mission.

FLARES-Pressing the F key sets the flares.  These are used to decoy enemy heat
seeking missiles.  The flares, made of Magnesium, will fool the missile into
thinking that the flare is actually your exhaust.

CHAFF-Unlike heat-seeking missiles, radar guided enemy missiles must be
deceived by dropping strips of metal into the sky, creating a fake radar image
of Gizmo.  Pressing the C key sets chaff for dropping.


                                "OTHER FEATURES"


HEADS UP DISPLAY-Pressing H displays the Head-Up Display(HUD).  Using the
latest technology available, a computer image of your cannons' aiming cross
hairs is superimposed on your windshield.  Use the to aim at a target for
firing.  With your cannon armed, any object that passes through the crosshairs
should be hit.  Missiles do not use visible tracking methods, so you may turn
off the HUD if you wish by pressing H again.

TURBO BOOSTER-Press the + key to turn on the Whizbang Whomper turbo booster. 
Press the - key to turn it off.  The turbo booster will double your present
speed (to a maximum of 900 knots).  It also causes the oil to heat up at a very
fast rate, so it must be used sparingly.  When the turbo booster is on, the
turbo indicator to the right of the instrument display will light up.  The
turbo can be made inoperable if hit by enemy fire.

WHISPER MODE-Pressing the W key engages the Whisbang Whisper.  This effectively
silences the Gizmo.  Whisper mode must be activated whenever attempting to make
a secret landing, or else the noise from the helicopter may alert enemy ground
personnel.  When the whisper mode is on, the Whisper Indicator to the right of
the instrument display will light up.

PAUSE-Suppose you want to suspend the game and take a break from all this
excitement.  Switch to either the computer terminal(press the T key) or the
communications screen(press the * key).  Press any unassigned key to get back
into the thick of it.


                              THE COMPUTER TERMINAL
                                        
                                        

The computer terminal, the small screen located on the right of the cockpit, is
activated by pressing the T key.  You will then be presented with a weapons
inventory and two optional categories for status update.  Pressing any
unassigned key returns you to the cockpit view.  If your computer system has
been destroyed by enemy fire, the cockpit terminal will be blackened and you
will not be able to access it.

The Weapons store is displayed in LED bar graphs indicating remaining Missiles,
Flares, and Chaff.  Press the 1 or 2 keys to review chopper status information
or your tactical map, respectively.

1. Status Display- This represents your Gizmo's present status.  If any damage
has been sustained, the picture of your Gizmo at the top of the screen will be
highlighted by visual damage circle indicators where the damage has occured,
accompanied by flashing text descriptors.  Below this are displays for
remaining missiles, flares, and chaff.  Cannon rounds are unlimited.  Pressing
the SPACE BAR returns you to the main terminal screen.

2. Tactical Map- The Top of this screen houses a small computer screen with a
digital readout.  The numerical value is you calculated ADF frequency.  See
COMMUNICATIONS for more details.  The large gridded map below is a tactical map
of the country.  Your position within the country is displayed by a flashing
sphere with a shadow underneath.  The distance between the sphere and the
shadow represents your altitude.  If you have programmed the ADF, a small flag
will appear on the map as well.  This is your destination.  This display can be
used to determine your relative position to your destination at any time during
your mission.  Press SPACE BAR to return to the main terminal.





                                 COMMUNICATIONS
                                        


The Whizbang Gizmo DHX-1 is equipped with the kind of highly sophisticated
communications equipment that is often necessary for the successful completion
of missions for which this machine has been expressly designed. Pressing the *
key on the keyboard takes you from the cockpit display to the communications
terminal (which is located on the left of the cockpit screen).  Be careful,
this system can be destroyed by enemy fire.  The system is used as follows:

*Press "A" to program the Automatic Direction Finder (ADF).  Type in the three
numbers from the tactical display, ignoring the decimal point. Your ADF is now
programmed.  You do not have to program it again unless the numbers were
entered incorrectly.  Your ADF will not function properly if the values are
incorrect.

*Press "S" to go into send mode.  Send mode allows you to send messages to
other aircraft or to ground controllers.  Once you are in send mode, you may
type messages at the top of the screen on the Comm-bar.  No punctuation is
allowed.  Use the DEL(ete) key to backspace.  Pressing RETURN sends the message
to either another aircraft or to a ground controller (as appropriate). The
flashing S or R represents the current Send or Receive status.  Press the space
bar to return to the cockpit view.


                                 OTHER AIRCRAFT


As you begin a mission by flying the chopper to your destination, you will
encounter other aircraft along the way.  Some may be ohter infiltrators also
trying to upset the Mad Leader's plans, while others may be staunchly loyal to
the Mad Leader and his evil goals.  There are three types of other aircraft:
the friend, the enemy, and the maniac.
Upon encountering another aircraft, you must determine whether it is a friend
or an enemy.  Since there are no distinguishing markings on your ship, and
because helicopters are not an unusual sight over the Country, other pilots
will also try to determine your loyalties and intentions by talking to you via
the communications system (sending and receiving messages).  You should always
try to communicate with an unidentified aircraft first.  As soon as you see an
aircraft for the first time, press the * key.  Once on the communications
screen, press the S key to send a message.  The only phrases the comm systems
of other aircraft will understand are:

REQUEST ID
INFILTRATOR      (TYPE THAT TO A FRIEND)
OVERLORD         (TYPE THAT TO A ENEMY)

After requesting the identification of another aircraft, examine the response
for a code name.  With experience, you should be able to distinguish friendly
code names from those of enemies.  This will provide you with the information
necessary to respond properly to their request for identification.  Giving the
correct ID to an aircraft will allow you to continue on your mission
unhindered.  Giving the wrong ID to an aircraft will result in a battle that
will last until one of you is destroyed!


oh, by the way, we weren't kidding about the maniacs out there.  A few of the
other infiltrator pilots have snapped from the strain, and it really doesn't
matter what code name you use in a response.  They will always attack, and
you're going to have to fight against a former friend, turned deadly foe!

SAMPLE FRIENDLY NAMES:

   WHIPPLE AND HAYMISH
SAMPLE ENEMY NAMES 

   BOOMER AND SCUM

(The rest your on your own!)


                               LANDING PROCEDURES


Once you have arrived at your assigned destination, you will have to land to
continue your mission.  To land safely you must make sure of the following:

1.  your speed is between 20 knots and 0 knots
2.  the artificial horizon is level and you are not banking
3.  your rate of descent is at minimum

Once you have descended below 200 feet, you will hear the low altitude warning
buzzer sound.  Set your rate of descent to a minimum.  Wait until your altitude
is reduced to 0 and the Gizmo shakes and thumps loudly as it hits the ground. 
If you have landed at the proper destination, as programmed into the ADF, the
ADF gauge pointer will be flashing black and white and spinning madly. 
Remember, you must have the Whizbang Whisper silent travel mode engaged to land
without warning an enemy.
To take off once again, simply increase your altitude by pulling back on the
joystick and increase your airspeed.
While on the ground, do not back, accelerate, or spin, or you may crash!!


                                  UPON LANDING


Once you have landed, your view will change.  You will now be looking down at
yourself standing next to your trusty chopper.  You must pretend that you are
an enemy guard, much as you may have had to pretend to be an enemy in the sky.
Avoiding the enemy is the key to ground missions.

OBJECTIVE
To complete the mission displayed in the briefing without being captured, blown
up, or running out of time.  if you fail five times, your dead!  There are
three missions that become increasingly more difficult.  Once you finish one
mission you will be assigned your next task.

MISSION COMPLETED AND LEAVING
If you successfully complete your ground mission, make your way back to the
helicopter. Moving into the cockpit section onscreen will take you inside so
that you can return home.
If you haven't completed your mission, you won't be allowed to enter the
helicopter.  You can check to verify that your mission has been completed by
going to the inventory screen.  A message will be displayed when you have
completed the assignment, just to let you know it is time to get the "HELL OUT
OF THERE!"

RESUMING PLAY
If you stop playing once you have successfully completed a mission, you will be
given the option to either start from scratch or to start at the beginning of a
new uncompleted mission when you load the game again.  You cannot, how ever,
embark on a new mission before completing the previous one.


                       GROUND CONTROL AND INVENTORY ITEMS


When you see the screen with a grey figure standing next to a helicopter, move
the joystick in any direction to start the next phase of the mission.

YOU are the small dark grey figure on the screen.  You have a limited amount of
time and the use of several helpful devices (your inventory) to help you
complete your mission. Pushing the joystick will cause you to move in that
directions, unless you are busy with an item that is currently active.  An
active item is an object from your inventory that has been selected to be used.
Note that at the beginning of the ground mission your papers are present as the
active item.

FIRE BUTTON
Press the FIRE BUTTON to activate the active item.  The current active item is
always indicated at the bottom of the main screen.  Depending on the item
activated, you may not be able to move until you are finished.

PAUSE
To take a break, press the SPACE BAR to go to the inventory screen.  Your game
will pause until you are ready to continue.  Press any unassigned key to return
to the main screen, and your mission.

The inventory screen allows you to change the active item and displays
important inventory information.  You may select an item by moving the cursor
with your joystick.  Press the SPACE BAR again (or any unassigned key), and you
will return to the main screen.  The newly selected item will be active, and is
so indicated at the bottom of the screen.  Once you have returned from the
inventory screen, pressing the FIRE BUTTON on the joystick activates the item
you have selected.

In addition, important items found during your search will appear in a text
line at the bottom of the inventory screen.  Activation of these items will
occur without having to select them as active when and where appropriate.
(more details see: mission interference and enemy installation structures)
 
SLEEPING GAS-You have a hidden canister strapped inside your jacket which
contains a colorless, odorless sleeping gas.  Anyone sprayed will fall asleep
for several seconds and forget what has happened.  Pressing the FIRE BUTTON on
the joystick sprays the gas.  You have specially treated nose plugs which
allows you to breathe the gas harmlessly.

PAPERS-These are your fake ID papers.  You should activate your papers when a
guard asks to see them.  When that happens, move directly over and stand next
to the guard.  If the papers are not already active, move quickly to the
inventory screen and select them.  Return to the main screen, press the FIRE
BUTTON on the joystick.  Upon showing them, the guard will decide whether or
not they are "in order" and valid.  If they are in order, you can go about your
business, undetected as an infiltrator.  If they are out of order, you have a
short tie to gas the guard or run away before he tries to take you in for
questioning.  But be forewarned, running away will cause the guard to sound an
alert throughout the compound. (See Mission Interference)

GAS GRENADE-This grenade has the same effect as the sleeping gas canister,
except that it has a greater range.  When used inside, all guards in the room
in which it is dropped will fall asleep.

MINE DETECTOR-This is used to detect mines.  Selecting the mine detector on the
inventory screen enables it to be used whenever you press and hold the FIRE
BUTTON on the joystick as you move through enemy territory.  You will hear the
detector working.  Stepping on a mine wit the detector activated is harmless
and exposes that mine.  Stepping on a mine without the detector activated is
fatal-and stupid.

EXPLOSIVES-Explosives are planted by selecting the explosives icon on the
inventory screen as the active item, and then pushing the joystick up under the
main control panel in the control room or under the desk in the lab.  Only one
bomb per room is permitted.  Upon setting your last remaining bomb, an
automatic countdown timer will go off.  You then have about 20 seconds to leave
the building before all the bombs detonate.  If you don't make it out of there
in time, you will be trapped inside during the explosion, and it's bye! bye!
(Jimbo-baby that is!)

CAMERA-Use the camera to photgraph any vital documents.  To use it properly,
face the papers you want to photograph and press the FIRE BUTTON on the
joystick.  Only one picture per room is permitted.

INFORMATION UPDATES-At the bottom of the inventory screen are four graphs which
update the following:

Spray-How much sleeping gas you have left.
Grenades-The number of sleeping-gas grenades you have.
Explosives-How many charges you have left.
Film-How many more pictures you can take with the camera.

KEYBOARD-Pressing the following keys while on the main screen is the same as
using the cursor on the inventory screen to select an item:

S-Sleeping gas        M-Mine Detector
P=Papers              E-Explosive charge
G-Gas Grenade         C-Camera


                             "MISSION INTERFERENCE"
                                        
     

GUARDS
Enemy guards within the compound are fanatically loyal to the Mad Leader.  They
are assigned to patrol certain areas of the compound, and they will carry out
their orders unfailingly.  If one of the guards spots you, he may ask to see
your papers.  If you do not comply, an alert will be set off and guards
throughout the compound will chase after you.  Within the compound buildings,
an electronic key will turn off the alarms temporarily, but it will only work
once during a mission.  Find the electronic key, and a line of text on the
bottom of the inventory screen will note that you have it.  Make your way to
the alarm control center.  Stand directly in front of the card slot in the wall
and press up on the joystick.  This will cause the electronic card in your
possession to be inserted into the slot, without having to select it. (you
cannot select this particular item to be active.  If you have it, activation
will occur automatically when you push up on the joystick.) The alarms will be
silenced.
Outside the compound buildings, a talking guard will turn red (from dark grey).
You must follow the guard's directions or risk being discovered.  Running away
from a guard who is talking to you will prompt him to sound the alarm.  If you
gas a guard while he is talking to you, he will fall asleep and forget ever
having seen you.  (but you had best get out of the area before he comes
around.)  The guard's speech appears at the bottom of the screen.

MINES
Mines are usually scattered in the forest and in restricted areas to prevent
exactly what you doing-infiltrating.  Mines can be exposed with the mine
detector.  Stepping on a mine (without the mine detector activated) is a dumb
thing to do; besides, it will kill you!

TIMER 
A mission timer is visible on the screen at all times during the ground phases
of a mission.  If time runs out, you've blown it; your mission will end, and
you will have to start over again.  Tough luck dude! (you have about 20 minutes
of real time for each mission once you have landed within the confines of the
compound.) Time is of the essence when saving the world, you know what i mean!


                          ENEMY INSTALLATION STRUCTURES


Inside a building you can search through chests and cabinets for gas grenades,
security cards, and other useful and not so useful items.  Travel to different
levels within the same building is accomplished through elevators.  Clothing
disguises may be of some help.  If you want to swap clothing, stand directly in
front of a until you have finished changing.  An audible tone and accompanying
text will indicate when you have finished.

MAPPING UNIT
While inside any of the compound's buildings, your mini-mapping unit will
appear at the bottom of the screen.  The room you are in is represented by a
flashing box within the mapper screen.  All rooms are shown as boxes with
highlighted doors.  Moving into a new room maps it into the unit's screen.

ROOMS ARE COLOR CODED AS FOLLOWS:

RED:     designates a room of great importance (prison, control room, etc.)
GREEN:   designates the building entrance or an elevator
BLUE:    represents a room of no special importance

SEARCHING CHESTS

You may search any of the chests (on the top far wall only-chests on the side
walls seem to be empty...) in any room by moving in front of it and pushing up
with the joystick until you find whatever it contains.

DOORS AND THE SECURITY ROOM

Locked doors must be de-activated before you can enter these rooms.  To unlock
all the doors in the enemy compound, you must first find the security card
(search for it!).  With it in your possession, you can unlock the doors.  Once
you have found it, a line of text will appear on the bottom of the inventory
screen to indicate that it is in your possession.  Now, find the security room.
It is the room with the lock status indicator light on the wall and a passcard
slot directly below it.  To unlock the doors, stand directly in front of the
security card slot and press the joystick up.  This will cause the security
card in your possession to be inserted into the slot, without having to select
it. (You cannot select this particular item to be active.  If you have it,
activation will occur automatically when you push up on the joystick.)  The
lock status indicator light is red when the doors are open.


                                     THE END
