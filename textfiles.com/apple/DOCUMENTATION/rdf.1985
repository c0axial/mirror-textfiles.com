0.0 INTRODUCTION TO RDF 1985: 

AS  NATO  AND WARSAW PACT TANKS BATTLED FOR CONTROL OF THE WEST GERMAN
PLAIN, AN ELITE SOVIET PARA ASSALUT REGIMENT,  FLYING  AT  NIGHT  FROM
AIRFIELDS  IN  SOVIET  CENTRAL ASIA, SIEZED THE STATEGIC SAUDI ARABIAN
AIRFIELD AT  DHAHRAN.  SOON  HUGE  ANTONOV.22  TRANSPORT  PLANES  WERE
LANDING AT HAHRAN, UNLOADING T.72 TANKS, BMP INFANTRY COMBAT VEHICLES,
ARTILLERY,  AND BM-21 "KATYUSHA" ROCKET LAUNCHERS. BY MORNING, A LARGE
PART  OF  A  MOTOR  RIFLE  DIVISION,  VETERANS  OF  DESERT  COMBAT  IN
AFGHANISTAN,  WAS  ON  THE  GROUND.   BY  THE END OF THE DAY, THE MOST
IMPORTANT PERSIAN GULF OILFIELDS WERE IN THE SOVIET HANDS. 

WITHIN HOURS, C-141 STARLIFTERS CARRYING THE PARATROOPS OF THE  UNITED
STATES  RAPID DEPLOYMENT FORCE TOOK OFF FROM THEIR AIRFIELDS IN EGYPT.
IN THE UNITED STATES, C-5 GALAXIES BEGAN TAKING ON CARGOES OF  ARMORED
PERSONNEL  CARRIERS  AND  SELF-PROPELLED  GUNS. IN THE INDIAN OCEAN, A
U.S. NAVY TASK FORCE, CARRYING RDF ARMOR AND HELICOPTERS, SET A COURSE
FOR THE PERSIAN GULF. 

RDF 1985, THE SECOND OF  WHEN  SUPERPOWERS  COLLIDE  SCENARIOS,  IS  A
BATTALION-LEVEL  SIMULATION  OF  THE  RESULTING BATTLE.  THE RULES ARE
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THOSE IN GERMANY 1985. THIS BOOKLET  DESCRIBES
THE  EXCEPTIONS  AND  THE SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF DESERT COMBAT THT ONLY
APPLY TO RDF 1985. 


1.0 PLAYING THE FIRST GAME: 
--------------------------

*YOU WILL NOW BEGIN A SOLITAIRE GAME, IN WHICH YOU  ARE  THE  AMERICAN
COMMANDER, AND THE COMPUTER PLAYS THE SOVIET COMMANDER. 

WHEN  THE  GAME  OPTIONS  DISPLAY  APPERARS, HIT 3 TWICE TO REDUCE THE
STRENGTH OF THE RUSSIAN FORCE AND TO EXPOSE ALL OF THE SOVIET UNITS TO
VIEW.  THE RUSSIAN UNITS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. 

PRESS THE SPACEBAR, AND THE GAME WILL BEGIN WITH AN  AMERICAN  AIRDROP
ONTO THE DESERT. 

1.1 THE MAP
EACH  HEXAGON  OF  THE  39 X 28 HEX MAP REPRESENTS 2.5 MILES.  ON YOUR
SCREEN, YOU WILL SEE ONE-TWELFTH OF THE TOTAL BATTLE FIELD.  A  NUMBER
OR  A  LETTER WILL TELL WHICH SECTOR YOU ARE SEEING.  AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE GAME, ALL OILFIELDS, VILLAGES, TOWNS AND AIRFIELDS ARE  RUSSIAN
OWNED.   IF  AN  AMERICAN  UNIT MOVES INTO THEM, THEY WILL BE AMERICAN
OWNED, AND THE SYMBOL WILL CHANGE.   THEY  CAN  CHANGE  OWNERSHIP  ANY
NUMBER  OF  TIMES DURING A GAME. FOR THEIR IMPORTANCE, SEE RDF VICTORY
CONDITIONS (11.0). 

1.2 MOVING THE CURSOR
TO MOVE THE BLINKING CURSOR AROUND THE  MAP,  TYPE  THE  COMMAND  KEYS
PICTURED IN THE DIAGRAM BELOW: 
               
                      ____
                 ____/ 1  \____
                / 6  \____/ 2  \
                \____/ *  \____/ 
                / 5  \____/ 3  \
                \____/ 4  \____/ 
                     \____/   

1.3 MOVING UNITS
PRESS  ESCAPE  TO  MOVE  THE CURSOR TO THE FIRST UNIT AND TO ENTER ITS
MOVEMENT PHASE, AND THEN USE THE COMMAND KEYS TO MOVE THAT UNIT.  WHEN
YOU'VE USED UP THE MOVEMENT ALLOWENCE OF THAT UNIT,  THE  CURSOR  WILL
FIND THE NEXT MOVABLE UNIT. WHEN YOU HAVE MOVED ALL OF YOUR UNITS, THE
CURSOR WILL BLINK.  PRESS CONTROL AND E, AND THEN E TO END YOUR TURN. 

1.4 THE SOVIET MOVE
THE  COMPUTER  WILL  MOVE  ALL OF THE SOVIET UNITS.  DURING THE SOVIET
MOVE, YOU CAN STOP THE COMPUTER BY TYPING ESCAPE.  WHILE THE  MOVE  IS
PAUSED,  YOU  CAN  USE  ANY OF THE SPECIAL KEYS (12.0).  TO RESUME THE
SOVIET MOVE, PRESS ANY KEY.  WHEN THE SOVIET  MOVE  IS  FINISHED,  THE
CURSOR  WILL  BEGIN TO BLINK, INDICATING THAT THE FIRST FOUR-HOUR TURN
IS OVER.  PRESS ESCAPE TO MOVE YOUR FIRST UNIT AGAIN. 

2.0 MOVEMENT
------------

2.1 THE MOVEMENT DISPLAY
THE RDF MOVEMENT DISPLAY SHOWS THE WORD SMOKE; IF IT  IS  HIGHLIGHTED,
THE  MOVING  UNIT IS IN A SMOKE FILLED HEX.  MN(MINE ) AND NC(NUMCLEAR
CONTAMINATION) ARE  NOT  SHOWN,  SINCE  THEY  PLAY  NO  PART  IN  THIS
SCENARIO. 

2.2 AIR CAVALRY
AIR  CAVALRY  USES  ONE  MOVEMENT  POINT (MP) PER HEX.  IN ADDITION TO
THIS, AIR CAVALRY UNITS WILL USE: 

2 EXTRA MP'S TO ENTER A SMOKE-FILLED HEX

1 EXTRA MP FOR EACH SIGHTING ENEMY UNIT (SEU)

(2 IF THE AIR UNIT IS IN TRANS MODE)

1 EXTRA MP IF THE ENEMY HAS AIR SUPERIORITY, AND THE AIR CAVALRY IS IN
THE TRANS MODE. 

AIR CAVALRY UNITS CANNOT ENTER ENEMY-OWNED OILFIELD, VILLAGE, TOWN  OR
AIRFIELD HEXES. 

2.3 UNITS IN TRANSPORT MODE *CAN ONLY TRAVEL THROUGH TOWN, VILLAGE AND
AIRFIELD HEXES, OR ALONG THE ROADS. 

*CANNOT ENTER ENEMY-OWNED OILFIELDS, TOWNS, VILLAGES AND AIRFIEDS. 

2.4 BRIDGING
DUE  TO  AN  EXCEPTIONAL  LACK  OF  WATER IN SAUDI ARABIA'S RIVERS, NO
BRIDGING IS NECESSARY  IN  THIS  SCENARIO.   ENGINEER  UNITS  HAVE  NO
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS. 

2.5 TERRAIN
THE  EFFECTS  OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF TERRAIN UPON MOVEMENT ARE DETAILED
IN THE TERRAIN EFFECTS TABLE IN THE APPENDIX. 

3.0 MODES ---------

3.1 SPECIAL MODE RULES ENGINEER UNITS ARE ALLOWED TO RE-ORGANIZE.   NO
UNIT CAN ENTER RIVER MODE. 

4.0 THE ORDER PHASE
-------------------

NAVAL UNITS CANNOT USE STATEGIC MOVEMENT.  THEY CAN ONLY BE MOVED WITH
THE MOVE MENT KEYS. 

5.0 AIR POWER
-------------

5.1  THE  AIR POWER DISPLAY HIT CTRL A AT ANY TIME TO SEE AN AIR POWER
DISPLAY LIKE THIS: 
============================================================

NATO:3:RUSSIAN:1:  :ALC:KEYS (A)IR SUPERIORITY:SPARE.9:0 :0-9 TACTICAL
AIR SUPPORT :6 : 

============================================================

IN THIS SAMPLE, THE  HIGHLIGHTED  SIDE,  NATO,  HAS  THREE-TO-ONE  AIR
SUPERIORITY  DURING  THIS  TURN.  THE NATO PLAYER MAY ALLOCATE UP TO 9
SPARE POINTS TOWARD AIR SUPERIORITY IN THE FUTURE TURNS BY TYPING  ANY
NUMBER  UP  TO  9.   THE  NATO PLAYER MAY CALL IN UP TO 6 TACTICAL AIR
STRIKES DURING THIS TURN. 

5.2 CALLING AIR STRIKES
IF ITS SIDE HAS AIR SUPERIORITY,  AND  THE  AIR  POWER  DISPLAY  SHOWS
AVAILABLE  TACTICAL  AIR  STRIKES,  ANY UNIT CAN CALL FOR A SUPPORTING
STRIKE BY: 

        *TYPING (O) FOR ITS ORDER PHASE
        *TYPING (S) FOR SUPPORT FIRE

IF A PLAYER DOES NOT HAVE AIR SUPERIORTY, HE CANNOT CALL FOR  TACTICAL
AIR STRIKES DURING THAT TURN.  IF THE U.S. PLAYER HAS AIR SUPERIORITY,
HE  WILL HAVE BETWEEN 2 AND 7 AVAILABLE AIR STRIKES.  A RUSSIAN PLAYER
WITH AIR SUPERIORITY WILL HAVE BETWEEN 0-5 STRIKES. 

5.3 AIR SUPERIORITY
*THE U.S. PLAYER HAS AIR SUPERI ORITY DURING THE FIRST 2 TURNS. 

*THE RUSSIAN PLAYER STARTS THE SCENARIO WITH NO SPARE AIR POINTS,  AND
HE RECEIVES FEWER POINTS THAN THE U.S. PLAYER EACH TURN.  IT WILL TAKE
5 OR 6 TURNS BEFORE HE HAS ENOUGH TO CHALLENGE THE U.S. PLAYER. 

6.0 COMBAT
----------

RUSSIAN  UNITS  ON COAST HEXES CAN ATTACK OR FIRE ON U.S. NAVAL UNITS,
BUT THE NAVAL UNITS CANNOT FIRE BACK AT THEM. 

6.1 ARTILLERY DAMAGE
PARA UNITS, LIKE BMP,TANK, AND APC UNITS, SUFFER GREATER  DAMAGE  FROM
ARTILLERY IF THEY ARE IN TRANS, ATTACK OR REOR MODE. 

6.2 RETREATING UNITS
NAVAL  UNITS  THAT  ARE  FORCED  TO  RETREAT  AFTER COMBAT WILL SUFFER
INCREASED LOSSES INSTEAD. 

7.0 REORGANIZATION
------------------ IN ADDITION TO THE NORMAL RULES THE U.S PLAYER  MAY
USE  A  FRIENDLY  AIRFIELD INSTEAD OF ITS HQ (WHICHEVER IS CLOSER) FOR
RE-ORGANIZATION PURPOSES. 

8.0 HIDDEN UNITS
----------------

PARA UNITS WILL BE EXPOSED DURING THE TURN  THEY  LAND,  EVEN  IF  THE
HIDDEN  GAME  OPTION  HAS  BEEN  CHOSEN.   THEY MAY BE HIDDEN IN LATER
TURNS. 

9.0 MINES AND NUCLEAR CONTAMINATION
-----------------------------------

MINES AND NUCLEAR CONTAMINATION PLAY NO PART IN THIS SCENARIO. 

10.0 REINFORCMENTS
------------------

BOTH SIDES ARE SCHEDULED TO RECIEVE REINFORCEMENTS  DURING  THE  TURNS
SHOWN ON THR RDF DATA CARD. 

RUSSIAN REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE AT THE HEXES SHOWN ON THE DATA CARD. 

*PARA  UNITS  ARRIVE  WITHIN 3 HEXES IF THE DROP ZONES SELECTED BY THE
COMPUTER, OR BY THE NATO PLAYER, HAS  USED  THE  DROP  ZONE  PLACEMENT
OPTION.(13.3). 

*PARA  UNITS CANNOT LAND ON ENEMY-OWNED HEXES, OR ON THE WESTERN THIRD
OF THE MAP (SECTORS 1,4,7 OR A). 

*IF A DROP ZONE IS TOO CLOSE TO THE SEA OR THE EDGE OF THE  MAP,  PARA
UNITS  MAY  BE UNABLE TO LAND; THE ERROR SIGNAL WILL SOUND.  *THE PARA
DROPS ON TURN 3 AND TURN 4 WILL BE DELAYED ONE TURN  IF  THE  RUSSIANS
HAVE AIR SUPERIORITY. 

U.S.  REINFORCEMENTS  ARRIVING BY AIRPLANE (TURNS 7,8 AND 9) WILL LAND
ON AVAILABLE FRIENDLY AIRFIELDS.  NO MORE THAN TWO UNITS  WILL  ARRIVE
AT  ANY  FIELD (ONE UNIT AT NIGHT).  FRIENDLY UNITS ON THESE AIRFIELDS
WILL HINDER THE LANDING OF REINFORCEMENTS.   RUSSIAN  AIR  SUPERIORITY
WILL DELAY ALL AIR-LANDING REINFORCEMENTS FOR ONE TURN. 

10.1 NAVAL UNITS
A U.S. TASK FORCE, CARRYING REINFORCEMENTS FOR THE RDF, ARRIVES IN THE
PERSIAN GULF DURING TURNS 12, 13 AND 14. 

*NAVAL  UNITS  ARE  MOVED THE SAME WAY AS CONVENTIONAL UNITS, WITH THE
DIRECTION KEYS. 

*AT SEA, NAVAL UNTIS CANNOT ENGAGE IN COMBAT,  CHANGE  MODE,  USE  THE
ORDER PHASE OR SUPPLY SUPPORTING FIRE. 

*NAVAL  UNITS  ARE  ASSUMED  TO  BE  IN TRANS MODE.  THEIR MOVEMENT IS
REDUCED IF THE RUSSIANS HAVE AIR SUPERIORITY, AND BY THE  PRESENCE  OF
SIGHTING ENEMY UNITS. 

*RUSSIAN  UNITS ON COAST HEXES CAN FIRE ON OR ATTACK U.S. NAVAL UNITS,
BUT CANNOT BE ATTACKED IN RETURN. 

10.2 LANDING NAVAL UNITS TO LAND, A NAVAL UNIT MUST END  ITS  MOVEMENT
PHASE  ADJACENT TO THE COAST WHERE IT INTENDS TO LAND.  ANY UNIT WHICH
MOVES AT SEA CANNOT LAND UNTIL THE NEXT MOVE.  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
NEXT MOVE, THE UNIT WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE ASHORE. 

*NAVAL UNITS CANNOT LAND ON ENEMY OCCUPIED HEXES OR  ENEMY-OWNED  TOWN
OR VILLAGE HEXES. 

10.3 NAVAL UNITS ON SHORE
ONCE  ASHORE,  NAVAL  UNITS  CONVERT  INTO  CONVENTIONAL UNITS, WITH A
REDUCED MOVEMENT ALLOWANCE FOR THE FIRST  TURN.   UPON  LANDING  UNITS
CHANGE AUTOMATICALLY TO NORM MODE.(ARTILLERY CHANGES TO FIRE). 

11.0 VICTORY CONDITIONS
-----------------------

THE  GAME  WILL END AFTER 21,22, OR 23 TURNS, AT THE DISCRETION OF THE
COMPUTER. THE COMPUTER WILL THEN COMPARE EACH PLAYER'S POINT TOTAL AND
WILL DECLARE A WINNER.  POINTS ARE AWARDED AS FOLLOWS: 

1 POINT FOR EACH ENEMY UNIT ELIMINATED (ENEMY  UNITS  WHICH  EXIT  THE
BOARD DO NOT COUNT)

1 POINT FOR EACH OILFIELD HEX OWNED

2  POINTS  FOR  EACH  TOWN  OR  VILLAGE OWNED A PLAYER WITH 10 OR MORE
POINTS THAN HIS OPPONENT HAS WON A DECISIVE VICTORY. 

12.0 SPECIAL KEYS
-----------------

THE SPECIAL KEYS CAN BE UNSED DURING YOUR OWN TURN WHEN THE CURSOR  IS
FLASHING, OR, BY PRESSING ESCAPE DURING THE COMPUTERS MOVE. 

*IF  THE HIDDEN OPTION WAS CHOSEN WHEN YOU SET UP THE GAME, YOU CANNOT
USE THE D (HIGHLIGHT DIVISION) OR THE P (STRATEGIC  MAP)  KEYS  DURING
THE COMPUTER'S MOVE. 

13.0 GAME OPTIONS
-----------------

13.1 SAVING THE GAME
A  GAME MAY BE SAVED AT ANY TIME ON A SECOND DISK BY HITTING CONTROL B
AND FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS. RDF GAMES MAY BE SAVED ON THE SAME DISK AS
GERMANY 1985 OR OTHER SCENARIOS. 

13.2 RESTARTING A GAME
TO RESTART A GAME SAVED ON ANOTHER DISK, HIT THE NUMBER OF  THAT  GAME
OPTION  AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. THE NAMES OF GAMES AVAILABLE FOR PLAY
WILL BE SHOWN NORMALLY.  HIGHLIGHTED NAMES SHOW GAMES THAT  BELONG  TO
OTHER SCENARIOS, WHICH CANNOT BE PLAYED WITH THE RDF DISK. 

13.3  DROP ZONE SELECTION OPTION TO SELECT THE DROP ZONES FOR THE U.S.
PARA UNITS, HIT 9 WHEN THE OPTION DISPLAY IS SHOWN, SO THAT  PLACEMENT
IS  HIGHLIGHTED.   AS  THE  COMPUTER  DIRECTS, MOVE THE CURSOR TO EACH
DESIRED DROP ZONE AND PRESS RETURN. 

*PARA UNITS WILL LAND WITHIN 3 HEXES OF TH SELECTED DROP ZONES.  *DROP
ZONES CANNOT BE LOCATED IN THE  WESTERN  THIRD  OF  THE  MAP  (SECTORS
1,4,7, OR A)

14.0 STRATEGY AND TACTICS
-------------------------

THE  KEY TO WINNING RDF IS TAKING AND HOLDING OILFIELDS, AND EVEN MORE
IMPORTANT, AIRFIELDS. THE SOVIET PLAYER HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF  NUMBERS.
THE  U.S. PLAYER HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF SUPERIOR AIR SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY
ON THE FIRST DAY, AND THE SUPERIOR TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT OF THE  PARA
UNITS. 

WHEN  PLAYING  AGAINST  THE  COMPUTER, REMEMBER THAT THE COMPUTER SIDE
ALWAYS HAS ENHANCED AIRPOWER AND GREATER  ABILITY  TO  REORGANIZE,  TO
COMPENSATE FOR ITS LACK OF FLEXIBILITY. 

IT IS ADVISABLE TO AVOID A BATTLE OF ATTRION OR HURRIED, UNCOORDINATED
OFFENSIVES,  AND  TO  CONCENTRATE  ON SHARP, WELL-SUPPORTED ATTACKS TO
ELIMINATE ENEMY UNITS. 

IN EFFECT, WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST THE COMPUTER, YOU ARE PLAYING AGAINST
A WELL-EQUIPPED AND WELL-TRAINED ENEMY, WITH LITTLE IMAGINATION AND  A
TENDENCY  TO  GO  STRICKLY BY THE BOOK, A TYPE OF SOLDIER PLENTIFUL IN
BOTH THE U.S. AND RED ARMY.
