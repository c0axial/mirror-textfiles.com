THE THIRD COURIER

Moondancer:

Your assignment is vital.  Three couriers headed to a top-secret conference in
Brussels are missing.  Each was carrying a crucial component of the NATO
non-nuclear defense plans.  Now two are dead and the third -- last seen in
Berlin -- has vanished.  You must find the three critical components (a
computer chip, a floppy disk, and a CPU) before the NATO meeting -- and before
they fall into the wrong hands.

You know what's at stake.  This time it isn't surveillance.  It isn't a drop.
Or data farming.  This is the majors, and you've just been called up.  And
there's only one rule in this game: don't trust anymore.

Fly to Berlin and await further instructions.  Outside of occasional electronic
contact, you're on your own.  But then, you've always liked it that way.



HOW TO CREATE YOUR AGENT

There's a small matter regarding your cover.  Field Operatives are allowed to
select their own now.  After hiring a few Human Resource Psychologists the
Company was convinced morale would improve if you had a hand in selecting your
new profile.



Create Your Profile

You can have up to four different agents on file at any one time.
To create a new agent identity:

1.  Position the cursor on Create Agent and press the button (or press C).

2.  Type in the name you want to use for your new identity.
    (up to 23 characters)

3.  Press Enter.

The folder will open to display an Electronic Dossier for you to complete.


Complete an Electronic Dossier

The first page of the dossier is mandatory.  Think of its as your social
security number.  Your choices determine your agent's ability.

1.  Use the mouse, joystick or cursor keys to select an option from each
    background area (sex, occupation, etc.).  if you are using the keyboard,
    the tab key will move you from one selection group to the next.

2.  Click on Next Page (or Press N) to continue when you've completed the
    first page.

Character Traits

On page two of the dossier, you are assigned Character Traits based on the
information you provided on page one of the dossier.  The numerical values
beside Character Traits are indicators of your particular abilities relative to
the best agents of all time.  (the scale runs from 0 to 99, the highest number
being the best, 0 the worst.)

Personality Traits

These are additional characteristics that affect your character's abilities. 
As you gain more experience, more of your character's idiosyncrasies will be
revealed to you.  You will learn one more positive and one more negative aspect
of your character's personality with each level you gain.

Experience Points

Experience points are gained by playing the game.  You gain points by
exploring, encountering other characters, finding objects and by solving
problems.  promotions are based on your accumulated experience.

Grade Level

Indicated your progress.  No matter how good you may be now, everyone starts
out as Sleuth.  As you advance (gain experience points), you graduate to higher
levels: Agent, Resident Agent, Spy, and finally, Master Spy.  You attain these
levels based on the following expedience points:

                         Agent               25,000
                         Resident Agent      40,000
                         Spy                 60,000
                         Master Spy          75,000


How To Change Your Mind

If you're satisfied with your character, you have two choices:

1.  Select Activate and start the game

2.  Click on Done or Press D and return to the Agent Selection Screen.

However, unlike life, if you don't like your character profile you can start
over again.  Just click on Prev Page (or press P) and fill in the dossier with
new information.


How to Activate an Agent

After you create an identity (you can create up to 4), you can activate it at
will from the agent file disks.

1.  Click on Select Agent (or press S), then click on (or use the arrow keys
    to move the cursor to) one of the four files disks.

2.  Click on Activate Agent (or press A).  You will begin in your apartment
    or wherever you last saved the game.


How to Terminate an Agent

If you wish to create a fifth identity, you must first "retire" one of your
other agents.

1.  Click on Select Agent (or press S)

2.  Choose one of the four file disks by clicking on it or moving the cursor
    to it and pressing Enter.

3.  Click on Terminate Agent (or press T).  You will be asked if you want to
    delete this Agent.  Press Y or N.  If you terminate, he's gone.

4.  Go back and create a new agent as you did in Create Your Profile.


How to Review an Agent's File

Allows you to review the dossier and current statistics of any your saved
agents.

1.  Click on Select Agent or press S.

2.  Choose one of the four file disks by clicking on it or moving the cursor
    to it and pressing return.

3.  Click on Review File (or press R).  You will be taken to the second page
    of the dossier.  When finished reviewing the file, click on Done
    (or press D) and you will return to the Agent Select Screen.


How to Quit the Game

To return to DOS, follow these steps:

1.  Click on Quit Game (or press Q).  You will be asked if you want to save
    the current status of your agent.

2.  Select Y, NB, or ESC (ESC returns you to the menu).  Selecting Y saves
    your agent's status and returns you to DOS.  Selecting N does not save
    your agents's status and returns you to DOS.



KEYSTROKES

In The Third Courier, you can use a mouse, joystick or keyboard to control your
movements.

In you are using the keyboard, simply press the appropriate key for the desired
action.  With a mouse or joystick, highlight the desired option and press the
mouse button or fire button.

The directional movements works as follows:  Select a direction, such as North.
You will now be facing north.  To continue moving north, continue to click on

3.  To register your selection, press Enter.



WELCOME TO BERLIN

You'll be staying at a Knesebeck Strasse apartment building where most CIA
people stay.  If you venture beyond the Berlin Wall, prepare yourself for a
trip into the past.  Where West Berlin is alive with technicolor brilliance and
sparkle, East Berlin still has the look of a forty-year-old black and white
WWII movie.  Nothing has changed.  It has only aged.  Little reconstruction, no
modern services.  The trains still carry wooden seats, the cars with their
two-piston engines sound like noisy motorcycles, and the air is thick with the
smell of cheap, burnt motor oil.  A cloud of despair hangs over the city,
making the shadows grayer and the faces longer.

Mech Insert : West Berlin is within the Wall, East Berlin is on the outside.



HOW TO NEGOTIATE THE MAIN ACTION SCREEN

Your apartment is the first place you'll see in Berlin.  We trust you'll find
it comfortable -- and quite secure.  Your apartment is furnished with a
computer and an answering machine.  The computer is the only way The Company
can contact you.


Dialog Box

Displays critical conversation and information.


View Window

All the people you meet, the weapons you carry, the city streets, the building
you enter, the taxi, the U-Bahn, and the border crossings will be displayed
here.


Status Box

Indicates your current location, weapon in hand, and available ammunition are
displayed here.  As you explore the city, icons representing types of
establishments you are passing will appear on either the right or left side of
the status box.  Their positions indicate which side of the street they are on.

If you turn in the direction of the icon, you will be facing the entrance to
the building represented by the icon.  The building may or may not be open to
you.  Remember that most businesses have set hours.  Most in West Berlin open
about 6 a.m.


Character Information Display Unit (C.I.D.)

The C.I.D. Unit on the right of the screen has multiple functions.  You will
use this handy device to access special menus, keep track of your character's
statistics and the time of day, move around the city and make split second
decisions in encounters.


Menus:  Action, Inventory and Places

The options contained inside these menus are your modes of action.  They are
dynamic menus, which means that certain options are only available when they
are applicable to the situation at hand.  To operate these Menus:

    selection and press the button (or Press Action, Inventory, or Place on
     the keyboard).

2.  The menu will open up & the available options will be displayed in black
    type (options are not available at the present time are show in grey).

3.  With a mouse or joystick, position the cursor on the appropriate
    selection and press the button (or use the up and down arrow keys from
    the keyboard to highlight your selection and press enter).

               to change weapons during an encounter.

Bribe          Offers money to people you encounter.  Because you're street
               wise, you always bribe the correct amount.

Drop           Removes an item from your inventory.  Becareful; once you
               leave the location where you drop something, its gone forever.

Inventory Menu

This menu lists all the items you have in your possession at the tim you open
it.  In certain locations, such as Mission Control or your apartment or in a
restaurant, it will list the objects that are available to you there.  At these
locations, th Inventory menu will open automatically when you select options
from the Action menu such as Buy or Take.


Place Menu

When hailing a cab (option from the Action Menu), this menu opens to reveal the
places you can get to by taxi.  As you uncover more important locations at
Berlin, these locations are added to the place menu.


Dynamic Character Traits
Your character's traits reflect the choices you made on the dossier.  They are
represented as bar graphs on the C.I.D. Unit.  Each graph fluctuates as you
move, have encounters and gain experience.  Watch these stats as you play. 
They affect how well your character can react to different situations.

    o  Intelligence :  It is affected by your experience, solving problems
                       and your health.

    o  Strength :  Increases due to successful combat and decreases bases on
                   the amount of damage your character has taken.  Health
                   also affects your strength.

    o  Knowledge :  Increases as you uncover facts and gain proficiency with
                    new items and weapons.

    o  Intuition :  Changes as a result of encounters with other characters.

    o  Health :  A big factor in strength, hence in your ability to fight.
                 Thus, if your health is low you might want to flee a
                 possible attacker instead of standing your ground.  You
                 might even want to get to the doctor at Mission Support.


Level

Shows your character's current level rating (1-5).  These numbers increase as
you gain experience and are promoted by Langley.


Experience Points

This figure represents the points you accumulate as you move toward
accomplishing your mission.  Certain discoveries you make will increase
experience points faster.


Time and Day

The digital readout provides you with the time of day (represented in military
time).  Many places in the city at 0600 hours and close at 1800 hours.  The
number of day represents the day elapsed since the beginning of your mission. 
Remember you have only 7 days to accomplish your mission.


Compass

You may only move in the compass directions that are highlighted.  To leave
your apartment, for example, N is your only possibility.  To move, position the
cursor over one of the compass points and press the button, or press the
appropriate letter key: East, North, West, South.



ENCOUNTER OPTIONS

When you meet someone, applicable Encounter Options will appear.  To select an
option, position the cursor over the appropriate option and press the button or
press the appropriate letter key.


                              Encounter Options

Chat          A good way to get information; chat with everyone unless, of
              course, they're ready to swing an ax in your directon.

Run           If your health or strength is down, you might want to let your
              feet do their stuff.  A word of warning, however.  When you
              run, you have no control over where you go.  You are dropped
              randomly in the city.

Fight         Combat goes in rounds between you and the other guy.  The
              outcome will be determined by your strengths and weapons and
              your opponents strengths and weapons.  You can be wounded in
              combat, which will affect some of your character traits.
              During combat you may arm or change weapons by opening the
              Action menu and selecting Arm.

              Your inventory menu then opens so you can select the weapon you
              wish to be armed with.  Combat continues until one of your is
              defeated or one of you runs.  If you win, you can now search
              your opponent.  if you lose your are Terminated... dead.  But
              if you open the Action menu and select Restore, Moondancer is
              returned to the last "saved" position.  So it may be prudent to
              save the fame often.

Threaten      Threaten is an aggressive action that evokes different
              responses from the people you meet.  Some will run, some will
              fight, some will call the police, and some will call you names.

Search        If you happen to eliminate an opponent, be sure to frisk them.
              They may be carrying vital info.



FIELD OPERATIONS BEGIN

To begin your assignment you'll want to USE some of the equipment in your
apartment.  Try logging onto your computer or using the your answering machine.
Remember, aside from the contacts you make on the street and in shops, these
two machines will be your only sources of information.  Check them
periodically.


Know Your Password

You'll need to enter a passcode when you Log On to your Computer the first time
each game session.  To decipher the password:

Mech Insert : What Password?

Once in the computer you can check your mail and the dossiers of the important people with whom you will deal throughout your mission.  The dossier list is dynamic and new names will be added as you meet these people and make use of your Photo-Fax.  Only people Langley has a dossier on will show up in this list, which can be found under Name Check.  When you're finished using the computer, Clock Log Off.



DENIZENS of BERLIN

Our intelligence has told us that there are some contacts and informants in
Berlin who will be helpful to you during the mission.  However, specific
information as to their identities died with the two couriers.  Don't forget to
use your Photo-Fax -- Langley most likely has Dossiers on some of those people.

We also know that as in many large cities, there is a flourishing black market.
Usually, these operations are fronted by normal-looking businesses.  Check out
the local merchants.  maybe you'll locate some sources for specialized items.

Due to the nature of this particular situation, we have reason to believe that
counter-espionage activity will be very heavy in Berlin.  Watch your back.

And watch your front.  Reports from the field indicate that the streets of the
city have become more dangerous, especially at night.

Good lock, Moondancer, we'll support you in the mission however we can.  But as
always, you are alone out there and will have only your quick wits and clever
ways to see you through.

rifles.  Mission Support also stocks them occasionally.

                   AK 47                     M16

                   HK 91


Submachine Guns

Hopefully you won't meet anybody carrying one of these, but rumor has it that
someone has been supplying submachine guns to some of the locals to prevent
people like you from doing their job correctly.

                   K-50M                     Port Said

A little refresher here from your school days might be in order on some of
these, so we'll include descriptions.

Bali-Song : A short, flat-bladed knife, commonly called a 'butterfly knife'.

Stiletto : A thin-bladed knife, longer and thinner than a Bali-Song.

Sykes-Fairbairn : A heavy, military knife which can be fixed int a bayonet
                  if need be.



GIZMOS

There are some items at Mission Support that may be of value.  Occasionally
check with Murphy in Supply to see if he has any of these devices available.
(Note : that some devices will only be available as you gain certain levels).


Electronics

Bomb Sniffer:  Standard issue C.A.N.I.N.E. class explosion detection device
               capable of detecting even minute traces of explosive compounds
               at range of up to 50m.

Bug Finder:  The Super Sentry Speakfree Bug Finder, which, when used in
             conjunction with the Super Sentry Bug Eradicator, (q.v.) allows
             the most secure local bug protection on the market today.

Bug Killer:  The Super Sentry Bug Eradicator, a single use device which not
             only destroys local convert listening devices, but doubles as a
             handy aerosol stain remover as well.

Bug Recorder:  Located in your apartment, this device records any Super Bugs
               you have activated.

Ferat:  Infared through Ultrapurple wave detection device keyed to hormonium
        compound used to coat NATO defense plans.  Will emit a beeping sound
        when within 10m. of said plans.

Photo-Fax:  A photographic facsimile machine which will allow you to send
            pictures to suspected contacts and agents to Langley from
            indentification and report immediately if a dossier exists on
            these individuals.  Langley will then send, via modem, the
            complete dossier to your apartment computer.  This is a very
            important device, as it is the only method of direction
            communication you will have with the company.

Super Bug:  An extremely small and powerful covert listening device designed
            to blend well into any number of art-deco and neo-modern
            backgrounds.


Protective Gear

BERLIN TOUR GUIDE FOR NON-GERMANS

Whenever visiting a new city, it's always a good idea to bring along a good
guide book.  It increases the pleasure of your wanderings -- and you never know
what interesting nuggets of information you might pick up.  Here's a brief
description of some of Berlin's notable districts.


WEST GERMANY


The Park District:  To the south of and east lies the great Berlin park, a
place of scenery, beauty and enchantment.  For centuries, lovers have strolled
hand in hand through these woods, enthralled by their pastoral beauty.  Many
forms of entertainment abound herein and, of course, public restrooms are
provided.

The Place District:  North and east is the home of the famous Charlottenburg
Palace, the largest mansion in Berlin and bastion of German culture.
Surrounding the palace are some of the finest restaurants and bars Berlin has
to offer.  Be sure to sample the beer.

The Templehoff District:  Smack in the center of Berlin lies the Templehoff
business district, home of Berlin's thriving international trade community.
Experience the hustle and bustle of a truly dynamic economy at work, and
perhaps see the city from a new perspective -- high atop the Templehoff
building itself.

The Dairy District:  The mere mention of Germany immediately conjures up images
of good food.  Beer, pretzels, and of course, wurst are as German as bagpipes
are Scottish.  This south-western district is the home of these rural delights.
These merchants, known for their biting wit and rural wisdom, are always glad
to exchange pleasantries with foreign travelers.

The Industrial District:  What city could survive without the working man? 
Berlin is no exception.  North and west lies the home of the proletariat and
his pleasures.  here you will be staying in some of the most affordable housing
in all of Europe.


EAST GERMANY

Max Engles Plaza:  Wide open space and open air cafe's mark this plaza, the
largest in East Germany.  Here, it is said, old friends may meet and relive
happier times.

Cultural District:  Traveling east from the plaza along Unter den Linden, one
encounters the home of German culture.  If one is careful, one might almost be
able to see the spirits of such German immortals as Beethoven, Mozart, and
Wagner as their music drifts out from the opera house.

Government District:  Between Friedrichstrasse and Otto Grotewohl along
Unter den Linden sits the center of international government in East Berlin.
Travelers who encounter troubles may wish to consult their embassy, located
along this stretch of road.

Brandenburg Gate:  Of all of the beauties of Germany, one of the greatest must
be the gates of Brandenburg concerti.  It was once said of these gates:
"If I could choose, from all of lifes pleasures, my last sight, it would be of
the gates at Brandenburg."
