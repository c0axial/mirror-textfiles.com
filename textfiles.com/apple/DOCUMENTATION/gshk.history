 GS-ShrinkIt v1.0.5 (3/21/92)

Fixed a bug which made GSHK unable to extract several (usually small) files
from StuffIt and ARC files.  The bug only happened if the file was compressed
with RLE (run-length-encoding).

Fixed bug when archiving, the name displayed would be prefixed by elipsis, but
the right-hand side of the name wouldn't be displayed at all (Andy McFadden).

The default text for "New.Folder" is now selected.

Fixed a bug that caused EOF errors to happen when extracting from .QQ files
which were smaller than 4k (Karl Bunker and Bryan 'Zack).

Fixed a bug where if you'd extract and overwrite an existing file, the
extracted file would magically inherit the filetype, auxtype, and other
attributes from the file that was overwritten, not from the file that was
being extracted (Karl Bunker).

When archiving an HFS disk, if you have the HFS FST installed, GSHK will
now save the file_sys_id for the disk inside the archive.

Added "Save COMPRESS files as" popup to preferences so that when compress
files are decompressed, they can be saved as binary or text files.

Fixed bug where if a file was saved with "Save as .BXY file" and it was
named something like "filename.bxy", the Binary II header would contain
"filename.bxy.SHK".  Now it properly contains "filename.SHK" (Dean Esmay).

If "Save as .BXY file" is checked and the filename is filename.SHK (instead
of the more common filename.BXY), the last character before the suffix will
be incremented to provide a name unique from the outside name instead of
incrementing the first character (which seemed to confuse some people)
(Dean Esmay).

Changed "Save as .BXY file" to "Add Binary II to this archive" (Dean Esmay).

When archiving a disk with a bad block, GSHK will report the error instead
of just closing the thermometer dialog and deleting the archive (how
annoying!).

The HFS filetype and creator are now used when extracting from a StuffIt
archive (very handy if you're extracting to an HFS disk using System 6's
HFS FST which you intend to someday use on a Macintosh).

The high bits are only removed from files in archives which need them
removed, not always removed.  Also, slashes ("/") are no longer turned into
colons for files in StuffIt archives.

GetFile dialogs now display prettier and more distinct icons in the standard
file lists.

Added elipsis to a few buttons to indicate a modal dialog will happen if the
button is clicked.

Changed text of 'Cancel' button in extraction dialog (the one with the
thermometers) to more accurately be 'Stop'.

Fixed bug which caused data to not be able to be extracted.  The exact
problem was that if a clear code was issued by the compressor with 1 byte
remaining to be compressed in a 4k chunk, the decompressor would put
garbage in the output file.  The decompressor has been fixed (which means
that if you archived something with an older version of GSHK, if you use
v1.0.5 to extract, you won't lose any data).

 GS-ShrinkIt v1.0.4

Extracting NuFX from America-Online actually works now.

Graph box now listens to OA-period to get it to abort.

Fixed bug which would cause data to be archived such that it couldn't be
extracted.  The exact problem was caused by the string table filling up and
issuing a clear code ($101) after the last character for a block had been
output.  The corresponding decoders in ShrinkIt and GS-ShrinkIt know nothing
about any codes after the final code in a block and get very confused at that
point saying that the data has been corrupted.

 GS-ShrinkIt v1.0.3

Fixed a bug which caused "Fatal Error $0401" to occur after clicking "extract"
when some of the static segments were bank-aligned.  Apple DTS (specifically,
Dave Lyons) helped me track this down at the A2-Central Kansas-City Developer's
Conference.  Extra credit goes to Dennis Doms who built a system disk which
duplicated the problem.

 GS-ShrinkIt v1.0.2

The select-all button in the archive, addto, and delete dialogs now works
faster.

Fixed a problem that caused GSHK 1.0.1 to crash whenever someone hit a key
which was mapped to the SF list on screen.  This only happened to the
archive, addto, and delete dialogs. (Stowe Keller)

When a stuffit file's forks are split into separate file (presumably to
make use of ResSpy), the filetype for the res fork was whatever the HFS
filetype routines deemed appropriate.  Now, the res fork is saved as a BIN
file to make ResSpying yet even easier -- it probably should have been BIN
in the first place. (Robert Rosenberg)

Prefix 18 is no longer used.  Prefix 20 (and 8) are now saved before GSHK
starts and restored after exiting gshk. (Bryan Pietrzak)

Separate source and destination directories are now provided.  The destination
pathname is initially set to the source pathname -- the source path is left
as prefix 8 if prefix 8 exists and prefix 0 if prefix 8 is null.  "New Archive"
works FROM the source TO the destination.  "Open Archive" works from the source
and TO the destination when extracting.  The paths can not be predefined, yet.
(most of the known world).

 GS-ShrinkIt v1.0.1

DO NOT use the ShowText NDA or ShowPic NDA (below v4.60) with GS-ShrinkIt.
ShowText causes really bizarre stuff to happen, especially when GSHK shuts
down.  You will occasionally get an "Error $0003" message if ShowText is
installed.  Chris Haun's WriteIt! 2.0 NDA is a good replacement for ShowText
in that it's much faster and you can edit what you see.  ShowPic's before
version 4.60 can not handle having the "shadow" bit set in System 5 QuickDraw
II and trash the scanline control-bytes (SCBs) leaving the screen a horrible
mess.

If you suspect something is wrong with GS-ShrinkIt, before you jump to any
conclusions please remove all the Desk Accessories (DAs) and INITs from your
system.  It's quite possible that a DA or INIT is contributing to the problem.
If you have a problem which occurs with GS-ShrinkIt and -several- DAs (ie,
each one seems to always cause the same problem in GS-ShrinkIt), then most
likely the problem is with GS-ShrinkIt and you should tell me.  If you find
that the problem is only caused by a single DA or INIT, most likely the
DA or INIT is flakey and you should contact its author.

Fixed problem that GSHK 1.0 had leaving a file open after receiving an
error when someone would try to sort an archive, such as trying to sort on
a write-protected disk. (Stowe Keller)

A <Select All> button has been added to the New File Archive dialog, the
Add Files dialog, and the Delete Files dialog.

Because the AppleDisk5.25 Driver doesn't support getting the volume number
from a DOS 3.3 disk (or specifying it when formatting), DOS 3.3 disks
can't be archived or extracted under GSOS.  Warnings have been installed
to this effect.

If the preference "Split StuffIt forks when extracting" is checked, each
of the forks of a StuffIt file will be saved as a separate file.  The
res fork's default name is filename.r -- this should make people who use ResSpy
happy.

There are 2 more pop-ups in the prefs, "Save ARC files as: TEXT/BIN" and
Save ZOO files as: TEXT/BIN" -- these cover some of the most frequently
asked-for enhancements.

The TextEdit flag fRecordDirty is checked to see if any changes have taken
place since the last time the update button was clicked to determine whether
or not to highlight the update button instead of relying on finding that the 
TE control got hit.  This allows you to scroll through the comment without
GSHK thinking that you need to click the update button.

Changed the way the info icon is displayed.  If any text is available in the
archive comment, the icon will be shown as a yellow comment icon.  If no text
is available, then the icon will be shown as a grey comment icon.  The
difference is probably subtle enough that some people will not notice the
change, but the icon looks better with the interior colored grey than if it's
masked with alternating dots.  If you edit a comment and change the amount of
text in it, the correct icon will be redrawn in the list when the update
button is clicked.

Added HFS creator_type of "pdos" support for the unStuff routines.  The
filetypes are now interpreted the same way that the AppleShare FST does a
filetype translation from Macintosh HFS. The ProDOS filetype and auxtype are
now set correctly if the creator is 'pdos'. If the filetype is TEXT, then the
prodos filetype is set to TXT.  The create date is now set correctly when
extracting stuffit archives -- the mod date is set to the current date.  The
correct filetype and creator are set if you unstuff to an AppleShare volume.

Added recursive delete routines to the DELETE option in the file menu.  1.0 used
to refuse to delete folders unless they were empty.  Now, if you select a
folder, everything in that folder will be deleted.  You'll be properly
prompted if a file is locked, also.  (Dennis McClain-Furmanski)

Fixed problem with GSHK 1.0 reporting "file not found" when a folder with files
in it was archived with "Delete after archiving" turned on.  This always
happened with 0 files remaining to be archived and didn't affect the
resultant archive.  (Rick Zeman, Dennis McClain-Furmanski)

Fixed problem with GSHK 1.0 always saying it got error $1202 whenever it
couldn't finish the _StartUpTools call.  The error code was wrong -- new error
codes have been installed which explain the error and what to do about it.
