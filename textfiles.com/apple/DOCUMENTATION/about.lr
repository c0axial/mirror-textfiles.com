NEEDS:     Apple 3.5" drive,ShrinkIt to unpack

Here is a very good version of Lode Runner from Germany.  Its in english, don't worry.  It must be unpacked to a blank 3.5" disk (it will erase the contents of the ENTIRE disk!) and you must boot the disk to run the game.  The drive MUST be a apple 3.5" drive!

In case you don't know, Lode Runner is one of THE classic Apple II games.  You've gotta pick up little treasure chests and avoid the little men chasing you.  There is also a maze, FYI, to navigate around.  One joystick button will make a little "hole" to the left of you, the other to the right of you.  The holes aren't permanent, and there are some squares you can't melt away.  Use the holes to entrap/kill the men chasing you!  Unfortunately, they have a tendency to regenerate quickly...

Again, the disk must be booted.  The easiest way to do this is to run basic.system from Finder, and type in "PR#5".

** NOTE **

Surak TFF kindly let me know of the following commands:

CTRL-K = enable keyboard
CTRL-J = enable joystick
CTRL-E = level editor (!)
CTRL-R = start on a random level
