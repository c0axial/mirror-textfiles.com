Undo Button: 
The  "Undo" button allows any piece's move to be undone, or restarted at
any time during the Movement Phase. To undo a move, select  the  desired
piece  by  clicking  on it; then click the "Undo" button. The piece will
move back to its original location. The  "Undo"  button  remains  dimmed
unless  a  piece  that has moved is selected.  If the Ogre has rammed or
overrun a defender, it can only be undone back to the hex where the  ram
or overrun occured. 

Clear Button: 
The  "Undo" button changes to the "Clear" button during an attack phase.
The "Clear" button is used to deactivate weapons that have been aimed at
a target. 

Group/Split Button: 
Explanation of the button is covered in Grouping Infantry and  Splitting
Infantry in the Movement section. 

Fire Button: 
The  "Group/Split"  button changes to the "Fire" button during an attack
phase. Once weapons have been aimed at a  target,  clicking  the  "Fire"
button fires them. 


MOVEMENT: 

Moving a Piece: 
To  move  a  piece, click on it, and while holding the button down, drag
the pointer to another hex and release the button. If an illegal move is
attempted (i.e., moving onto a  crater,  across  rubble,  off  the  map,
moving a piece that has already moved, or moving a piece farther than it
can) you will hear a beep and a message informing you of your error will
be  in  the  Tactical Display. Once a piece has moved at all, it appears
dimmed (green). This alerts the player that  any  solid  (black)  pieces
have  not  moved yet. A piece can move up to its maximum movement value.
It is not necessary to move a  piece  at  all  if  it  is  already  well
located. 

Ogre Movement: 
The Ogre's movement depends on the number of treads it still has intact.
A  Mark  III  starts  with 45 treads; a Mark V with 60.  When the Ogre's
treads are reduced to two thirds their original total (30 for Mark  IIIs
and  40  for Mark Vs), the Ogre's movement value is reduced from 3 to 2.
When the treads are reduced to one thiird their original total  (15  for
Mark  IIIs and 20 for Mark Vs), the Ogre can move only one hex per turn.
When the Ogre's treads are completely destroyed it can no  longer  move.
It can still attack anything within range. 

Selecting  the  Ogre  will  display  the  "Ogre Summary" in the Tactical
Display and will show the Ogre's current movement value as well  as  the
number of treads remaining. 

Movement Through Occupied Hexes : 
In  general, only one unit at a time may occupy a hex. Any unit may move
through a hex occupied by a  friendly  unit.  When  moving  onto  a  hex
occupied by a friendly unit, the top piece will be highlighted. Clicking
on  this hex brings the bottom piece to the top. One of thes pieces must
be moved before any other action can  be  taken.  Attempting  any  other
action  (except  moving  the  map, undoing, or moving one of the stacked
pieces) elicits a beep and the message "Please move from one full hex". 

Grouping Infantry: 
The maximum number of squads of infantry that can occupy a single hex is
three.  Two 1-squad units may be grouped  into  a  2-squad  unit.  Three
1-squad  units,  or  a 1-squad and a 2- squad unit may be grouped into a
single 3-squad unit. To group two infantry units, move them to the  same
hex and click the "Group" button.  WARNING - When two infantry units are
grouped together, the newly merged unit will have a remaining move value
equivalent  to  whichever  of  the  two  original  units  has  moved the
farthest. Also, grouping infantry CANNOT be undone. 

Example: 
an INF 1 uses its first move to move onto an INF 2 that hasn't moved  at
all.  At this point, the INF 1 has moved 1 hex and has 1 move remaining.
The  INF  2 hasn't moved at all, therefore, has 2 moves remaining. If so
desired, the INF 1's move can be undone at  this  point.   Clicking  the
"Group"  button combines the INF 1 and INF 2 into an INF 3. The Tactical
Display will show a 3-squad unit that  has  move  1.  Also,  the  "Undo"
button will be dimmed, indicating this piece can, however, be split. 

Splitting Infantry: 
2-squad  or 3-squad units may be split into two infantry units. Whenever
a 2- or 3- squad infantry unit is selected, and is not currently sharing
a hex with another piece, then the "Group" button, will  change  to  the
"Split"  button.  Clicking  the  "Split"  button  will  cause  a 1-squad
infantry unit to be split off and share the hex with the remaining squad
unit. The two new infantry units will have the same  "moved"  status  as
the original unit. 

(Example: 
If  an INF 2 is split after having moved one hex, then the two new INF 1
units will both have moved 1 hex and can be undone back to the same  hex
as  the original INF 2). The "Split" button will immediately change back
to the "Group" button allowing the two infantry units to  be  recombined
if so desired. 

Ramming: 
An  Ogre  can  damage  or  destroy  an armor unit by ramming it. This is
accomplished by moving onto its hex. Any immobile armor  unit  (i.e.,  a
howitzer  or  any ;unit that has been disabled) is destroyed when rammed
by the Ogre. Any mobile armor unit has a 50% chance  of  being  disabled
and  a 50% chance of being destroyed when rammed. The Ogre however, pays
a price. Ramming a heavy tank, the Ogre  loses  2  treads.  Ramming  any
other  armor unit costs the Ogre 1 tread. An Ogre can completely destroy
the Command Post with a single ram at no tread loss to  itself.  If  the
Ogre disables a piece when ramming it, then the Ogre will be highlighted
to  indicate that a piece is underneath it. If the Ogre has any movement
left it can ram the piece again, thus destroying it. If the  Ogre  moves
off the disabled piece, the piece will be dimmed (blue) as an indication
that  it  is  disabled.  THE  OGRE CAN ONLY RAM TWICE IN ONE TURN. Armor
units may in turn, ram the Ogre.  This ram, however is  sacrificial  and
destroys the ramming armor unit. (Sort of like using your compact car to
ram  the  crawler  that carries the Space Shuttle to the launching pad).
The Ogre loses 1 tread due to this. This ploy is not recommended  except
in dire emergencies. 

WARNING: 
A  Ram  CANNOT  be  undone.  Therefore,  any  time a piece moves onto an
opponent's hex, a dialogue box appears requesting  verification  of  the
ram. Clicking "ok" allows the ram to procced. Clicking the "cancel" will
abort the move. 

Overruns: 
Infantry  are not rammed by an Ogre, but overrun.  If an Ogre moves onto
a hex occupied by infantry, that infantry is reduced by one squad IF THE
OGRE HAS ANY ANITPERSONNEL WEAPONS LEFT. If the Ogre does not  have  any
antipersonnel  weapons, the infantry is not reduced. There are no limits
on overruns; the Ogre can overrun for  as  many  moves  as  it  has.  In
addition, overruns do not cause the

Ogre  any  damage.  An  infantry unit may move onto a hex occupied by an
Ogre without any immediate effectss.  The  infantry  will,  however,  be
reduced by one squad at the beginning of the Ogre's Movement

Phase,  providing  the  Ogre  has any antipersonnel weapons, without the
Ogre having to expend movement points to do so. WARNING: 
Overruns cannot be undone.  Therefore, any time an Ogre moves onto a hex
containing infantry, a dialogue box appears requesting  verification  of
the  overrun.  Clicking  "ok"  allows  the  overrun to proceed. Clicking
"cancel" will abort the move. 

GEV Double Movement: 
A GEV may move twice per turn - once  (up  to  four  hexes)  during  the
defender's  Movement Phase, and again (up to three hexes) during the GEV
Movement Phase following the defender's attack phase. 

Ending Movement: 
To end the Movement Phase, click the "Done" button. If all of a player's
pieces have not been moved when the "Done" button is clicked, a dialogue
box appears requiring a verification to end the Movement Phase. 

One-Player Ogre Movement: 
During the Ogre Movemnt Phase in the one-player game, the  pointer  will
disappear while the Ogre is thinking about where to move. When done, the
Ogre automatically moves. If the Ogre rams a piece, there may be another
pause while the Ogre considers a different move. 


COMBAT: 

A  Combat  Phase  occurs  after  each  Movement  Phase  (except  for GEV
second-phase  movement).  During  a  Combat  Phase,   the   "Undo"   and
"Group/Split"  buttons  in  the  sidebar  change  to "Clear" and "Fire",
respectively. These buttons are dimmed initially, and  remain  so  unitl
weapons have been aimed. 


Weaponry: 
Most  weapons are heavy rapid-fire cannon using tactical nuclear shells,
capable of finre in any  direction.  Each  unit  may  apply  its  attack
strength  once  per  turn.  Each intact Ogre weapon may apply its attack
strength once per turn, with the following exceptions: 

Antipersonnel: 
The Ogre's antipersonnel weapons are effective only against infantry and
the Command Post. No infantry unit may be attacked more  than  once  per
turn  by antipersonnel. When all antipersonnel weapons are gone, an Ogre
can no longer reduce an infantry unit's strength by overrunning it. 

Missiles: 
Each of the Ogre's  missiles  are  one-shot  weapons.   Once  fired  (or
destroyed before firing), they are gone. 

Ogre Attacks: 
An  Ogre may attack an enemy unit by dragging from the Ogre's hex to the
enemy hex. If the Ogre has any unfired weapons that can reach the enemy,
a dialogue box will appear offering the available weapons. Weapons  that
have  been  fired,  destroyed,  or  are  out of range will be dimmed and
cannot be selected. Clicking on the desired  weapon  highlights  it  and
displays  the  weapon's  attributes  in  the sidebar. Clicking on the up
arrow in the dialogue box will  increase  the  number  of  the  selected
weapon  to  be  fired  (up  to  the  maximum  number of this type weapon
available). Clicking the down arrow will decrease  the  number.  At  the
very  bottom  of  the  sidebar is a window displaying the probability of
killing the target with the selected weapons. Any  number  and  type  of
weapons  can  be  fired  in  combination  to  increase  this chance. The
probability of  killing  will  not  always  be  increased  by  combining
weapons.   This  probability  is  derived  from  the ration of the total
Attack Strength of the  attacker(s)  to  the  Defense  Strength  of  the
target.  Sometimes the combined attack strengths are not enough to reach
the next highest ratio. The following table contains  the  probabilities
for all he possible ratios. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ratio of Attack Strength      Prob. of Killing         Prob. of Killing
