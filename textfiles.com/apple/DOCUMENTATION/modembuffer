ModemBuffer is meant for IIgs users whose communications program can't keep up with their modem, particularly modems 9600 bps and faster.  It is an init that should be placed in the System/System.Setup folder of your startup disk.  It sets up a 64K buffer for the GS modem port. If your communications program doesn't enable buffering, be sure to enable it in the control panel.  ModemBuffer.1 uses slot 1 and ModemBuffer.2 uses slot 2.  Be sure to use the appropriate one.

This is ModemBuffer version 1.1.  It represents a significant improvement over version 1.0.  Version 1.0 did not work.  Version 1.1 does work.  It should work with any communications program that uses the firmware.  If a program can't keep up with fast modems, it is likely that it uses the firmware.  If ModemBuffer can't allocate memory, you will get an error $201 and will have to reboot; sorry.
