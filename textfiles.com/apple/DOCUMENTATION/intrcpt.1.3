     Okay...This is  the latest  version of  Intercept. I  wrote it  because  I
learned that Intercept 1.2 wouldn't work properly with the Apple //c, and also,
one of the instructions in the driver routine wasn't truly slot-independent, as
I had hoped.  Anyhow, it's done, so have fun...

                           Section 1: How it works:
                           -----------------------

1.0: The process of booting:
---------------------------
    When a disk that has been modified with Intercept is booted, the  following
is what takes place:

    1)  The disk controller  ROM reads Intercept's BOOT1  routine from track 0,
       sector 0 into page 8 of RAM.

    2) Intercept clears the screen to either spaces or inverted @'s and  prints
       'Intercept  1.3' in the upper left  corner, and the user defined message
       in the center of the screen.

    3) Intercept  reads in  the track/sector  list from  the sector  stored  at
       track in $8FE, sector in $8FF.

    4)  Intercept reads  in the  Intercept driver,  the old  BOOT1 routine, and
       the code to be  run as an  interception from the  sectors listed in  the
       track sector list.

    5) Intercept jumps to the driver routine at $A00.

    6)  The driver routine calls the intercepted code, and when the intercepted
       code returns  to the  driver, it  moves the  old BOOT1  routine to  page
       8  from page B,  sets up memory as  if a disk had  just been booted, and
       jumps into the controller ROM's routine  that sets up the registers  and
       jumps to $801.

    7) The boot continues as if nothing had ever happened.

1.1: Intercept's structure:
--------------------------
     Note:  In the docs for Intercept 1.2, I kindly included a breakdown of the
technical workings of Intercept, T/S  list format, etc. Unfortunately,  certain
people  (The Sector Smasher, Mad Rat, The  Nudge, 6-Golds, and Knight Writer of
The Star League) decided to  be ASSHOLES and remove the  small bit of credit  I
try  to reap by putting  Intercept 1.2 in the corner  of the screen by changing
the message to all spaces on  their crack of Planetary Construction Set.  These
guys  are so  lame, they  couldn't even  figure out  how to  NOP out  the print
routine...they went and changed  all of the data  that made up 'Intercept  1.2'
into data that would produce spaces.  Well, guys, the whole reason I put in the
user-defined message was so that people wouldn't take out the title and replace
it  with something of their  own. Thanks to these morons  who were not only too
damn stupid to  write their OWN  boot routine,  but also stupid  enough to  get
caught  stealing someone else's,  there is no  longer any technical information
concerning Intercept available.  I'd suggest you call them up and thank them if
you  wanted the data. The  boards that they frequent are  on the title page for
Planetary Construction Set.  Now I know how you felt about Bun E. Boot, Tyrone.

                       Section 2: How to use Intercept:
                       -------------------------------
1) Crack a ware

2) Make a title page program for it.

3) Boot the Intercept 1.3 disk.

4) SCANNING FOR BLANK SECTORS:  Place the disk you  plan to intercept in  drive
   one or two and press the appropriate key.  Intercept will begin to scan your
   disk for blank  sectors that  contain all $00s.  If you  already know  where
   enough  free sectors are to hold your title page program, plus 3 sectors for
   overhead, press the <ESC> key. Once  you think Intercept has located  enough
   free  sectors  to  hold  your  title page,  hit  <ESC>.  Note:  You  can let
   Intercept scan the whole disk for free sectors, as it will continue  merrily
   along until it locates 255 blank sectors, but why spend the extra time?

5) DEFINING THE BOOT PARAMETERS: There are four parameters you will have to set
   for Intercept to continue.  They are:

   CLEAR SCREEN TO: This option allows you to clear the screen either to spaces
                    or to inverse @ signs.  Choose whichever you like best.

   BOOT MESSAGE: This option  allows  you to enter a  20 character long message
                 that will  be  displayed  in  the  center  of  the  screen  as
                 Intercept  loads your  title program.  If you  do not  wish to
                 have a boot message displayed, just hit <ESC> at the prompt.

   TITLE FILENAME: This is where you enter the name of the file you wish to use
                   for  your title  program. Hit ESC  to catalog  the drive you
                   booted Intercept from.

   FILE TYPE: This option allows you to select the type of file you wish to use
              for  your  title program.  Use P  if you  simply have  a standard
              hi-res picture, or F  if your title program  is a BRUNable  file.
              If  you choose the P option,  Intercept will load the picture and
              ask you  if it's  the correct  one. If  so, the  picture will  be
              packed  and an  unpacker will  be included  as part  of the title
              page.

6) DEFINING THE TRACK/SECTOR LIST: This section is where you work with the list
   of  tracks and sectors on  which you want your title  page to be written. If
   you want to use the blank sectors  found with the scan function, use  option
   1 at this menu.

   OPTION 1: USE BLANK SECTORS FOUND WITH SCAN:  This option  will allow you to
             use any blank  sectors you  found with  the scan  function as  the
             track/sector  list.  You will  be notified  if not  enough sectors
             were found to accomodate Intercept's requirements.

   OPTION 2: DEFINE TRACK/SECTOR LIST MANUALLY:  This option will allow you  to
             manually  enter a track/sector  list. Intercept will automatically
             stop asking for  track/sector pairs once  you have entered  enough
             to hold your title program plus 3 sectors for overhead.

   OPTION 3: VIEW CURRENT TRACK/SECTOR LIST: This option will allow you to view
             your current track/sector list to verify that it's correct.

   OPTION 4: EDIT LIST: This option will  allow you to edit the current  track/
             sector  list. Use the arrow keys to  select the pair that you wish
             to edit, and hit the spacebar to  edit it, or D to delete it  from
             the  list. Note  that if you  delete a track/sector  pair from the
             list, you may have to add a pair using option 5 in order for there
             to be enough room for Intercept to function properly.

   OPTION 5: ADD TO LIST:  This option  is similar to  option 2, except it does
             not initialize the track/sector list to 0 entries when you  select
             it.

   Once  you are finished editing/defining the  track/sector list, hit <ESC> to
   intercept the disk.

7) INTERCEPTING THE  DISK: Once  you have completed  the necessary  preliminary
   steps,  you will be  prompted to place  the disk to  be intercepted in drive
   one, and to  press <RETURN>.  Make sure  the disk  to be  intercepted is  in
   drive  one and  not write  protected. Intercept  will attempt  to place your
   title program  on  the disk.  If  an error  occurs,  you will  be  informed,
   otherwise,  the  message, "Intercept  1.3 has  been successfully  written to
   the disk"  along with  the ']'  prompt  will be  displayed. I  suggest  that
   after  you intercept a disk, you boot it  and verify that it functions as it
   did before the Intercept process.

8) NOTES: If you make  a BRUNable title page program,  it MUST NOT BEGIN at  an
   address  lower than  $2400. If  it does,  it will  interfere with Intercept.
   If it DOES begin at a location lower than $2400, but greater than $BFF,  you
   may still use it, but you'll have to move it to a location higher than $2400
   and write a memory move routine to move  it to where it should go. Under  NO
   circumstances  may a title program  begin at a location  lower than $C00, as
   the area from $0000-$07FF is used by the Apple internally, and the area from
   $800-$BFF is used by the Intercept 1.3 loader program.

NOTE:  If you're a  GnU WaReZ KiD,  you can use  Intercept to add  a title page
      to cracks that are  already out, but let's  face it...how much lower  can
      you get than to steal credit for someone else's crack?

Well,  that's  about it.  If  you've got  any  questions about  Intercept, feel
