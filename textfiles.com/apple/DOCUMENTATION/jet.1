Note:  JET should work on any Apple system with or without a Joystick.
If you've lee..er..downloaded a packed version of JET the correct file
length should be <208>.  There is a bogus ware in circulation right now
in the Atlanta Area at least. 

Introduction
------------

At SubLOGIC we've been steadily developing a comprehensive system of
real- time three-dimensional display and simulation technologies for
microcompu- ters.  Jet is an exciting application of these technologies
in a realistic simulation of both the F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-18
Hornet jet fighters.  These jets have tremendous power and agility, and
each is very easy to fly.  Jet includes a free flight mode for
practicing aerobatics and precision ma- neuvering, and two different
combat modes to test your skills.  We hope Jet will provide you with
some excitement of flying the real thing.

  Next comes explanations of the commands.

Out the Window View
-------------------

In flight mode the screen displays a view of the local scenery in front
of the jet.  If you select the F-16, your initial view will be of the
hanger walls and ceiling that surround your aircraft. When flying the
F-18 your initial view is off the bow of a Nimitz-class aircraft
carrier, where your jet sits ready to be launched from the carrier
deck.  As you take off and start to fly, the out-the-window display
rapidly updates the view bases on your position and attitude. 

Heads-Up Display
----------------

A variety of instruments located around the sides of the screen allow
for quick readings with minimum outside viewing interference.  The
veritical bar to the left of the outside view is your AIRSPEED
INDICATOR.  This in- dicates the jet's velocity in Mach number (times
the speed of sound).  Other instruments located around the outside-view
display will now be de- scribed in detail. 

A. Altimeter

This vertical bar indicates the jet's altitude above ground level (AGL)
in feet.  The altimeter's scale is nonlinear and highly accurate even at
low altitudes (i.e., landing).  The nonlinear scale also alerts your to
near-ground approaches when teh bar indicator begins to move very
rapidly. 

B. Heading Indicator

The heading indicator displays the jet's magnetic heading (0...359),
where 0 degrees indicates north, 90 degrees is east, 180 degrees is
south, and 270 degrees is west. 

C. Frame Loading Indicator

Frame loading measures teh force exerted on the aircraft perpendicular
to the wing surface.  This force is measured in G's, where one G equals
the force of gravity.  If frame loading shows a negative value, the
force is applied upward with respect to the wing.This instrument is
important be- cause of the human body's limited tolerance to high
acceleration.If frame loading exceeds 9 G's, the pilot will black out
due to blood draing from the head.  If frame loading drops below -3 G's,
the pilot will red out as blood rushes to the head. 

D. Gear Status Indicator

This indicator displays the aircraft's landing gear status.Press Cntl-G
to toggle the landing gear up or down as required. 


E. Brake Status Indicator

This indicator displays the status of the jet's airbrake.  To toggle the
airbrake on or off, press, Cntl-B. 

F. Fuel Level Indicator

This indicator displays the amount of fuel remaining as a percentage of
total internal fuel capacity. As the throttle is increased,fuel comsump-
tion rises proportionally.  With afterburners on, fuel consumption is
doubled.  If your fuel supply is depleted,the engines will flame out and
you will have to attempt a dead stick landing. 

Selectable Instruments
----------------------

Several other instruments may be enabled or disabled at any time.These
instruments are optional because they can obscure the out-the-window
view and because they slow down overall animation speed. 

G.  Radar Display

The radar display is superimposed over the outside view.It shows the lo-
cation of enemy targets-missiles-and your home base with respect to your
aircraft.  Your own aircraft is displayed as a blue dot in the center of
the display.  Enemy aircraft or ground targets appear as red dots (your
selected target flashes red) and enemy missiles appear white.  Your home
base will appear as a flashing red/white dot.  If your home base is out-
side normal radar range, the red/white dot will be plotted at the edge
of the radar screen in the direction home base is located.The radar
display can be turned on and off by pressing the [W] key. 

H. Attitude Indicator

The attitude indicator is toggled on and off with the [A] key.  This in-
strument shows the orientation of your aircraft with respect to the
ground.  A scale of lines in 20-degree increments both above and below
the horizon indicates the pitch of your aircraft.  Single points at the
top and bottom of the scale indicate a 90-degree pitch attitude.The
aircraft's bang angle is displayed by rotation of the pitch scale.This
instrument is very useful when the horizon is not visible outside
window. 

I. Range Indicator

The range indicator is toggled on and off with the [R] key.This instru-
ment, which appears as a circle in the center of the screen indicates
the distance to your selected target (see WEAPONS SYSTEMS).A white
circle indicates that the target is out of range.When the target comes
into range, the circle turns black and diminishes counterclockwise as
your close in.In Target Strike mode range is computed by measuring the
distance to the point on the ground that intersects your aircraft's
flight path.This is the target point your guided ordnance will track
when released.The range indicator can also be used in conjunction with
the attitude indicator to determine precisely which way your aircraft is
pointing. 

View Control
------------

Control Tower Mode: In normal flight mode, the out-the-window display is
from the cockpit point of view.In control tower mode you can watch your
aircraft from the control tower's point of view.You may zoom in or zoom
out (see VIEW DIRECTION CONTROL) but the view direction is fixed towards
your aircraft.If you eject from the aircraft the view will track you as
your parachute opens and you float gently (?hmmm?) back to earth.
Flying the aircraft in this mode is like flying a jet by remote
control.  Press [C] key to toggle between cockpit and control tower
points of view. 

View Direction Control
----------------------

Keypresses:       [5][F] - Left View      [5][H] - Right View
                  [5][T] - Front View     [5][B] - Rear View
                  [5][G] - Upward View

You can also zoom in and out,like a camera lens, to adjust your angle of
view.  2x is the normal viewing angle, but you can zoom in to 8x or out
to 1x as desired.The current zoom factor is displayed in the lower right
corner of your Heads-Up Display: 

                   [Y] - Zoom in by a factor of 2
                   [N] - Zoom out by a factor of 2

Flying the Jet
--------------

A.  Flying by Wire

Fly by wire refers to a system of aircraft control in which the pilot
sends steering commands to a computer which in turn generates actual
elevator and airleron movement.  All the pilot has to do is point the
aircraft in the desired direction and the computer will keep it flying
that way.  Because the F-16 can generate more pounds of thrust that it
weighs,it can accelerate vertically and is considered ballistic.  This
allows any angle of controlled flight. 

B.  Controls

The Jeft has five controls for flight operations: 

The THROTTLE controls engine thrust.  To decrease thrust press the [<-]
key.  To increase, hold down the [->] key for a few seconds & the thrust
indicator will climb rapidly.  When thrust percentage exceeds 99, the
afterburners are activated and a red A.B. indicator is displayed.  Press
the [<-] key once to disable the afterburners. 

The ELEVATOR controls the aircraft's pitch attitude.  Press [B] or pull
back on the joystick to pitch up.  If the aircraft has sufficient
airspeed this will bring the nose of the jet up.To pitch the aircraft
down, either press [T] or push forward on the joystick. 

AILERONS control the jet's bank angle.  To bank the aircraft left or
spin counterclockwise, press [F] or move the joystick to the left.  To
bang right or spin clockwise, press [H] or push the joystick to the
right. 

NOTE: When using the keyboard for elevator/aileron control, note that
the more times you press a control key the faster you rotate.Press [G]
will stop rotation about both axes. 

LANDING GEAR are used for all ground maneuvering.  They are toggled up
and down by pressing [Cntl-G].You may not raise the landing gear while
on the ground.When flying, the landing gear should be raised to reduce
the drag on your aircraft.  This will give you a higher top speed.  If
you attempt to land with the gear up you will, of course, crash. 

The AIRBRAKE is used for landings and quick midair decelerations.  Use
[Cntl-B] to toggle it on and off. 

Ejection
--------

In extreme emergencies (imminent crash or missile hit) it may become
neccessary to bail out of the aircraft.  Press [Cntl-E] to eject. 

Sample Flight
-------------

To begin a sample flight, load the Jet and select the appropriate dis-
play device.  Make your menu selections as follows: 

Game Mode     - [3] for Free Flight
Skill Level   - [0] for Practice Mode
Aircraft Type - [2] for F-16

Now you should see the flight mode display,including theout-the-window
view and instruments.  Turn the attitude indicator on by pressing [A].
This overlays pitch markings on top of your window display.Turn on the
range indicator by pressing [R].This overlays a small white circle in
the center of the screen which can be used to indicate direction the jet
is flying in. 

NOTE:You may pause the simulation at any time by pressing the P] key.
Press any key to resume flying.  Press [Cntl-P] to pause the sim-
ulation without displaying the pause message. 

Joystick:  Press [Cntl-J] to enable and center the Joystick.  Once the
joystick has been enabled,it may be disabled by pressing [Cntl-J]again
