   Here is the last update of Disk Disintegrater DeLuxe:  Version 4.2a.
In this update, there is no additionnal feature than V4.2.  For more features,
wait for version 4.3.

   D.D.DeLUXE V4.2a correct a little bug of version 4.2 when you unpack a DDD
file and format the target disk.  Now, the bug is fixed in V4.2a.  This bug was
NOT present in earlier versions (lower than 4.2).  All DDD files packed with
compatible packers or D.D.DeLUXE (any versions) are all good.  The bug was
present only in certain rare conditions and when you unpack a file while
formating the target disk with D.D.DeLUXE V4.2. So all your D.D.DeLUXE packed
files are good.

   Also in V4.2a, a little modification has been made to distinguish between
the two partial catalog modes in PACK and UNPACK options:

a) In PACK option:  when you ask for a partial catalog, D.D.DeLUXE print
   PARTIAL2 and show only sub-directory filenames.
b) In UNPACK option: when you ask for a partial catalog, D.D.DeLUXE print
   PARTIAL1 and show sub-directories, $DD type files and REL or TXT files if
   you have configured your D.D.DeLUXE to show them.


   Please DISTRIBUTE this version on many Apple BBS boards as you can, it's
very important to use V4.2a rather than V4.2 (when you unpack a DDD file).
Thank you.
