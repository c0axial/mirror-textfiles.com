Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
BRAM Checker is an Apple IIgs Temporary Initialization file (TIF) that
checks the contents of the battery RAM present in an Apple IIgs for
changes from an image that is saved to the disk. You will be notified
at boot time of any changes to the battery ram since the last time you
booted the computer. The program will inform you of the battery RAM
locations that were changed, and give you the opportunity to restore the
old values or continue booting with the new values.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just copy the file "BRAM.Checker" to the "*:System:System.Setup" folder on
your boot disk.

That is all.

Using the Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you make a change (or someone else does) to your battery RAM, for example,
change the monitor border color, BRAM.Checker will inform you of the change
during the next boot. You will have the option of accepting the changes and
continuing with the boot, or you may restore the old values.

If the battery RAM has changed, the IIgs boot process will be interrupted
by a dialog on the text screen informing you that there was a change. Press
ESC to see which values were actually changed; press return to simply accept
the changes and continue. After viewing which items were changed, another
dialog allows you to either restore the old values (press ESC), or continue
with the new (changed) values (press RETURN).

BRAM.Checker saves a copy of your battery RAM to a file called "BRAM.Image"
in your System.Setup folder. This saved image is compared to the battery
RAM image at boot time, and you are informed of differences.

That's it. Have fun with it.
