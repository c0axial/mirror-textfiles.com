--------------------------------------------------------------------------------.
Explanation:

     This file will point out the differences between the many packing programs
and hopefully introduce the new STANDARD in packing, DDD 2.5R.

Here's a list of the current (most recent) packers:

DDD 2.1E - Enhanced DDD makes use of 128k and lightbars
DDD 2.5  - Further enhancement of 2.1E which includes a Digi-Check
DDD 2.5R - The most recent packing program, is EXACTLY the same as
           DDD 2.5 except that it creates an "R" type file, not a "B".

     As many of you know when DDD 2.5 or DDD 2.1E (referred to from now on
as DDD 2.5) pack they create a Binary or "B" type file. However, DDD 2.5R
creates a Relocatable or "R" type file, but this is done for a reason. With
the advent of the IIGS many people have been purcashing 2400 baud modems or
simplying buying full duplex 1200 baud modems (such as Hayes and USRobotics).
Well the standard transferring program is Ascii Express (AE) which uses
XMODEM protocol. There are a number of ProDOS compatible XMODEM transfer
programs which are compatible with AE, including DOS. What this means is
that let's say you are calling a board using AE:MOUSETALK under ProDOS and
the board you are calling is running AE (DOS) remotely. Well once you
enter AE you can still download or upload even though you are in ProDOS, you
see all of the ProDOS XMODEM transfer programs automatically convert the
file you are sending/receiving to ProDOS or to DOS. So once you got all that
let's go on to say that you see something that you want to download, like
Defender of the Crown, but it is packed using DDD 2.5. Well as I stated above,
even though you are in ProDOS you can still transfer with DOS boards because of
the built in converter in the ProDOS transfer programs. But, there is a problem
as many of you know not all the files that are in DOS can convert to ProDOS
perfectly or vice-versa. Well the Binary or "B" file is one such file, and this
is what DDD 2.5 packs files into. So even though you COULD download it into
ProDOS the file would be garbled as a result of the bad converting. This may
seem very complicated but I will go over it again near the end of this file.

     This problem has been solved, but only partially. You see, there has been
a new packer created DDD 2.5R which creates "R" type files which can be
converted back and forth between DOS and ProDOS without any mess ups, but not
many people realize this problem and are thus not using the new DDD. Well if
everyone would begin to use the new DDD 2.5R then anyone using a ProDOS
transfer program could download any ware packed with DDD because the built in
converter in the transfer program would no longer mess up the packed files like
it used to with the "B" type files.

     Whew! Well the point is simple, DDD 2.5R should become the new standard,
not because I say so or anyone else - simply because it is better. DDD 2.5R is
no different from DDD 2.5, the ONLY difference between the two is that 2.5R
creates a Relocatable (R) filetype instead of the normal Binary (B) filetype.
The "R" filetype allows users of either DOS to download/upload any ware without
worrying whether it will convert correctly or not, as it converts perfectly.

     Along with this file I am going to re-upload DDD 2.5R in case some people
over looked it as I did at first and I am also going to upload a DDD CONVERT
UTILITY program which will be explained in detail a little later.

     People who own Apple IIGS's and are planning to buy any external
modems are "stuck between a rock and a hard place." Because everyone knows that
the IIGS has a built in Serial port for external modems, but the only XMODEM
programs to support this are all written in ProDOS and none for DOS are planned
in the future. This means that even though the IIGS has a built in Serial port
for modems, IIGS user's would have to purchase a Super Serial Card and use this
instead simply because AE (DOS version) only works with the Super Serial Card
and not the built in port. Not only is this dumb it's also costly. An
approximate cost for a Super Serial Card is $120.00 and plus a cable for around
$20.00. Well if they used the built in port it would only require a $35.00
cable instead of $140.00 for a card and cable. Now, on the other hand, if
people started to use DDD 2.5R then IIGS user's who are using a ProDOS XMODEM
program and the built in port (remember the only XMODEM transfer programs who
recognize the built in port are all in ProDOS) can still be able to download
and upload all packed files because they can be converted perfectly.

     Now let's make up two examples to further illustrate what I am trying to
point out.

Ex.#1:
     Jim owns a IIGS, and a USRobotics 2400 Courier modem connected to his IIGS
via the built in port. Well Jim calls up Wares Palace, the nation's #1 wares
board, and decides to download BUREAUCRACY, the hottest new ware out in the
country. Jim goes to the transfer section, finds BUREAUCRACY on a volume and
then decides to start downloading. Well unfortunately since Wares Palace is
using AE (DOS) and Jim is currently in AE:MOUSETALK he cannot download it
because it was packed with DDD 2.5 (not R). If he had downloaded it not only
would he have his copy not have worked, but he also would have wasted his
last remaining xfer credits. What can Jim do? Not much of anything unless
someone sends it to him packed with DDD 2.5R or with a "R" filetype (more
later).

Ex.#2:
     Jake (Jim's brother) is now using the IIGS and calls up Wares Palace East
Elite because Jim is not cool enough to get on. So then Jake decides to take a
shot at downloading BUREAUCRACY, I mean it's already been out for 4 hours and
he doesn't even have it. So he enters the transfer section and as before the
board is in AE (DOS) whereas he is in AE:MOUSETALK, but this time he sees that
some nice fellow has packed it into an "R" filetype so quickly without wasting
anymore time to think Jake starts to download it to his unidrive. After 800
blocks he is relieved to have the ware, so he hangs up and now has to unpack
it. Well, the packed file is in ProDOS how can it be unpacked? The Answer: Boot
up Copy ][+ 6.x+ and convert the file to DOS by copying it from the unidrive to
any DOS disk. Now Jake has the packed file in DOS so he boots up DDD 2.x (any
version of DDD 2.x even DDD 2.1 can unpack DDD 2.5R files as well as DDD 2.5R
itself). After unpacking Jake is thoroughly enthralled with his Gnu ware and
decides to upload it to Wares Palace Southeast but he has deleted his packed
file of it, so he boots up his only DDD, version 2.1E. (Jake never needed 2.5R
because he only downloads, he doesn't ever pack wares!) Well Jake has packed
the ware and he now uses Digi-Check // to tack the Digi-Check onto the end of
the filename. Now Jake has a packed file which looks exactly as if it were
packed with DDD 2.5. Jake now decides he needs it to be a "R" filetype so he
uses DDD CONVERT UTILITY to change the filetype from "B" to "R". Jake now has
gone through a long ordeal which noone should have to, because Jake could have
used DDD 2.5R to accomplish all of the above. Now Jake can upload the ware.

     The end result is this: From now on pack all files using DDD 2.5R and if
you are a sysop and someone uploads a packed file that is a "B" filetype the
sysop then uses DDD CONVERT UTILITY to change its filetype to "R". The following
 are docs to DDD CONVERT UTILITY.

DDD CONVERT UTILITY is a program which was written in order to help DDD 2.5R
become more popular and the current standard. The program is very
straightforward and when run it prompts you for the appropriate Slot, Drive,
and Volume to use. After this it will ask you for the entire filename, if you
are not sure press [RETURN] and the current catalog will be displayed. When you
know the name type it in exactly and DDD CONVERT UTILITY will find the file,
change it's filetype to "R" and exit you to DOS. Very simply, this program
changes a files filetype from "B" to "R", but since I did not know of any
simple programs that do this I decided to write one, besides it only took
around 2 hours. After the file has been converted to "R" filetype it can be
converted back and forth between DOS and ProDOS without fear of messing it up
as it remains intact throughout all of the conversions. To exit the program
press [ESCAPE] at any time and to re-enter press "&". The program works great
with hard drives as well as normal drives, simply press [RETURN] when prompted
for the appropriate volume if you are using a floppy.

Closing Comments:

     The filetype does not matter at all to DDD 2.1E, DDD 2.5, or DDD 2.5R -
they can unpack any filetype, which means that they all can unpack each others
packed files. With DDD 2.5R and the DDD CONVERT UTILITY there is no reason why
there should ever be a "B" type packed file on any board, as they can easily be

changed. From now on I hope that everyone understands and decides to use DDD
2.5R to pack files and in the future I plan on writing a universal converter for
 any filetype, like Text and Applesoft, which will also convert back as
well.

If you do not understand this then please contact me on any board I am on or
specifically:

              Apple Tree //...........................305/556-6858
              Rock'n Roll Harbour.....................305/821-2232
              Capital Connection ][...................716/473-8051

Also if it matters, Apple Tree // will begin to support DDD 2.5R and the "R"
packed files shortly so I hope all other boards contend as well. And this file
did not mention DDD 2.6 or DDD ProDOS because I do not have either one of them,
but the point stands that from now on all packed wares should be in the "R"
filetype.
