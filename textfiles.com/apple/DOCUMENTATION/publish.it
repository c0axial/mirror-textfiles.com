          THE FIVE STEPS TO DESKTOP PUBLISHING
          More information for PUBLISH IT!

          Written by the JAZZMAN.

There are several preliminary steps in creating any document for the first time.
The file should be named, and a number of program settings should be checked.

Fortunately, none of these steps requires you to memorize anything. Each step is
on a pull-down menu, and the help menu can lead the way if you get stuck.

                                 THE HELP MENU

When you choose one of the options from the help menu, an informational Dialog
Box appears. Click on OK to return to your document.

                              ACTIVE MENU OPTIONS

There is a strong interaction between the Toolbox and the menus in Publish it!
When you first enter the screens Work Area and the arrow is selected as a
default, the EDIT, FONT and FORMAT menus are dimmed, showing that they are
inactive and not available for use. Pull down one of these menus, and you'll see
that the menu items are also dimmed.

Items within the active menus are also effected by the tool you've chosen. If
you pull down the FILE, PAGE and OBJECTS menus, you can see the highlighted
commands and functions which are available as well as those which cannot be
selected at this time.

When a menu is selected, you should also notice that some items have keyboard
equivalents ("Quick Keys") listed to the right of the function name. Once you've
learned Publish it!, you can save time by using the Quick Keys. There are Quick
Keys for a number of menu functions. At the beginning though, the program is
easier to learn by using the pull down menus.

As you experiment with the powerful features of Publish It!, the program will be
your best teacher. The process will soon become intuitive.

                           SELECTING YOUR DATA DRIVE

Choose Select Data Drive ...from the File menu to tell Publish it! where your
data drive is located. Your choice will depend on your hardware and
configuration of your system. Notice that you can use PRODOS pathnames.

                              SAVING YOUR SETTINGS

This option saves your default settings for any option that was active at the
time you chose SAVE SETTINGS, including settings for your data drive, the page
size, line, pen and fill choices. IT DOES NOT SAVE YOUR DOCUMENT...

                               OPENING A NEW FILE

Publish it! provides a default document name of "Untitled". If you wish to name
your document before starting it, or you wish to abandon the current document
you are working on, choose the New File...option from the File Menu. A box will
appear with a blank line for the file name. Type a short word (not more than 15
characters) which quickly describes the theme of your document. Use letters,
numbers and the period, but must begin with a letter.
To return to your document, click on OK.

                                  SAVING FILES

The Save File option saves your document under the current file name. If you
save frequently, another way to do it is to press O-Apple-S, the save file Quick
Key. On single drive systems, you will be prompted to insert your data disk. If
you want to use a different name, choose the Save File As... option.

                       SAVING A FILE WITH A NEW FILE NAME

This option allows you to save the current document under a new name. Choose
Save File As... from the File menu.
The ability to save a document to a different file name can be useful in a
number of ways. For example, if you want to save a layout to use in designing
other documents, you can save your current document under more than one name so
that you can preserve the current document and still have copies available for
use in creating other layouts. You can also save the document in various stages
of development under different names.

A dialog box will appear with the current file name. to change, type in a new
name. To save the file and return to your current document, click on OK.

                                 DELETING FILES


To permanently remove a file from your data disk, choose Delete File...from the
File menu. You can only delete one file at a time. A Dialog box will appear with
a list of file names. Select the one you want to delete and click on delete. A
second Dialog Box will appear asking you to confirm your decision.

                           CHECKING AVAILABLE MEMORY

From time to time you will want to check the memory available for your document.
Pull down the Apple  menu and select Status...for information on your computers
current memory availability and information on how many objects you have
remaining to use (the maximum allowed is 65). If you run out of memory, the
program will notify you. To return to your document, click on OK.

                     Now lets start to produce a document.

While it is possible to start your document anywhere, with design, art work or
words, and to move back and forth among these three parts of your documents
whenever you wish, I will present these ideas starting with the page layout,
continuing with the text possibilities, then graphics and finishing with the
printing.

Objects are such an important part of the program that they bear some
discussion. With the Toolbox,you can create six types of objects.they are:

     Graphic frames  [x]
     Text columns  [T]
     Horizontal or vertical lines  [l-]
     Rectangles  [ [] ]
     Round-cornered rectangles  [ (_) ]
     Circles  [O]

(Note: these symbols are not perfect, but as close as I can produce.)

Only one tool can be selected at a time. Select the tool by clicking on it.
Tools are deselected automatically when you choose another. Selecting one of the
tools will activate some menus and menu options and deactivate others.

To create an object, first click on the desired tool and then move to the spot
on the page where you want to place the upper left hand corner of the object.
Press the mouse button and drag to where you want the lower right corner, then
release the button. Several objects drawn on a single page may overlap each
other. Each object is actually on a single plane, with the most recently created
on the top.

                                 DESIGN GUIDES

To make designing your pages easier, we provide a guide system that helps
position your objects quickly and accurately on the page. Although these guide
appear on the screen, they will not be printed on your document. A check mark
next to Snap To Guides, indicates this option is active. Snap To Guides works
when creating text, columns and graphics, not when moving or resizing. If you
overlap a guide when drawing it, Your object will snap to the outer edge of
those guides.

To use this feature, select the page guides you want to use with the Select
Guides option. The page can be divided into rectangular regions composed of 1
(1x1), 4 (2x2), 9 (3x3), 16 (4x4) equal parts or no guides if you do not want
guides to appear on your display. The guides you choose will remain in effect
until you change them or until you quit Publish It!. To save a guide setting as
a default, set your guides and then choose Save Settings from the C-Apple menu.

You may change or remove guides at any time. If the Snap To Guides are on, when
you create a text column, graphic or graphic frame, it will automatically be
aligned with the nearest page guide.

                          SHOWING THE COLUMN OUTLINES


This option from the SPECIAL menu allows you to turn the display of text column
outlines on and off. It does not effect the text within the defined areas or the
text columns themselves or printing, since column outlines are never printed.
Choosing Show Column Outlines from the SPECIAL menu toggles this option on and
off. A check mark next to Show Column Outlines indicates that the option is
active.

                               SELECTING OBJECTS

AN OBJECT MUST BE SELECTED BEFORE IT CAN BE MANIPULATED. Click on the desired
object with the arrow.(or pointer). Selecting a new object deselects any other
object on the page. A newly created object is selected until you click on
another object, to select it. To deselect an object without selecting another,
Click in a blank section of the work area. When an object is selected, it may be
dragged by the lower right handle to resize it. Objects may overlap each other
on the page.  You may also change the order in which the objects are stacked by
selecting objects with the arrow and choosing either Move To Front or Move To
Back from the objects menu.

WARNING.......If the object you are moving to the back (bottom) is smaller than
the other objects, it may be hidden by other objects.

                                GROUPING OBJECTS


You can drag several objects around by using the grouping feature. Using the
arrow, drag the arrow pointer from a point above and left of the target objects
to a point below and right. Be sure to start dragging from a point that has no
objects. As you drag, you will see the outline of a box being drawn, almost as
if you were creating another object. When you release the mouse button, the box
will disappear, and every object that was inside the box will become selected.
You may now drag any one of these selected objects and all the rest will follow.
Other functions for grouped objects are, delete, change fill patterns and change
line weights.

NOTE...Some object menu items are not available for groups. They will appear
dimmed.

                               SPECIFYING OBJECTS

Objects can be moved or resized with the arrow. For more precise work, you can
choose Show Specifications... from the OBJECT menu. With this option you can
determine and modify the exact size of a selected object.

Specifications sheets vary with the type of object selected, but all have Left
Start and Top Start coordinates.

What the Dialog Box displays:

LEFT START...
Shows where the objects left edge starts relative to the left edge of the page
(in a  measurement determined by the UNIT MEASURE option in the SPECIAL menu.

TOP START...
Shows where the selected objects top edge starts relative to the top edge of the
page.

WIDTH...
How wide the selected object is.

HEIGHT...
How high the selected object is.

You may resize and reposition the selected objects with precision by changing
any or all of the four selections in the Dialog Box. For some objects, not all
four will be available. For example, There is no width option shown for a
vertical line, because width is determined by the line weight selected when the
line is drawn.

Click on the box with the value you want to modify and type in the change. When
you finish, click on OK. The selected object will be adjusted according to your
changes.

                          COPYING, CUTTING AND PASTING

When working at the object level with the pointer (arrow) tool, if you want to
duplicate an object, use the arrow to select the object, then choose Copy
(O-Apple-C)from the objects menu to copy the object to the programs internal
clipboard. The object will not disappear from the screen, but a duplicate will
be held in a buffer (clipboard) until you are ready to use it. Choose PASTE from
the objects menu, or O-Apple-V. A copy of your graphic will appear in the center
of your screen. Use the arrow to drag it to a new position. Once an object has
been copied to the clipboard, the original object can be moved or deleted
without effecting the size or position of the copy in the clipboard. cutting an
object works the same as copying except the original is removed from the screen.

                                DELETING OBJECTS

You can remove objects using one of two methods. The DELETE key or the CUT
method. To delete an object using the DELETE key, select it with the arrow, then
press DELETE. The object is permanently erased from the screen.

The CUT option on the OBJECTS menu also deletes objects. Unlike the above
method, cut objects are placed in the clipboard and can later be recalled with
the Paste option, providing nothing else has been cut or copied to the
clipboard. The clipboard can only hold one object at a time; cutting or copying
will replace any previously cut or copied objects.

                             SETTING THE PAGE SIZE

Before you start your layout, you must tell the computer which page size you
want to use. Select the SET PAGE SIZE option on the PAGE menu.

Selecting this option allows you to choose your page size from four U.S. and
international standard page sizes. The choices are: U.S.LETTER, U.S.LEGAL, A4
LETTER and B5 LETTER. These last two are approximately 8 1/4 x 11 2/3 inches and
7x10 inches respectfully.

The two choices under each of these are for the width of paper your printer
uses. Only wide carriage printers can handle a full 8 1/2 inch line width. DO
NOT SELECT 8 1/2 inch IF YOU HAVE A STANDARD SIZE PRINTER.

A Dialog Box will appear with four clearly defined page sizes. Select the page
size for the paper you have loaded in your printer (or a page size you plan to
use for this document or publication). Click on the page size you want to use,
then click on OK. What do you do if the page size you want is not listed? For
example, you want to layout a business card or an 11x17 flyer. For the smaller
page sizes, use the on-screen rulers to insure that your design stays within the
size you want for your business card. When the page is printed, you will only
use the section of the page you want.

For a larger page, like an 11x17 sheet, you could work with two 8 1/2 x 11"
pages and paste them next to each other.

                                SELECTING PAGES

You select pages by clicking on the left arrow and right arrow in the lower left
corner of the display. The current page number is shown after the document
title.

                           ADDING AND DELETING PAGES

To add pages to a document, choose the Insert Page option on the Page menu.
Selecting this option will cause a new page to be inserted before your current
location. The page you are working on and all subsequent pages will be
renumbered.

To append pages at the end of the document, click on the left arrow until you
reach the last page. If you click on the left arrow again, you will be asked if
you want to add a page. Click on OK to do so.

To delete a page, select the Delete Page option on the Page menu. Selecting this
option will delete the current page. All subsequent pages will be renumbered and
moved up one page in your document. You will be given a chance to reverse your
decision to delete a page. If you decide not to delete the page, click on CANCEL
or press RETURN.

NOTE...Delete Page erases text columns and reflows your text through the
remaining chain. Text will not be lost, if any linked columns remain. Text that
is not part of a chain on another page will be lost.

                                 VIEWING PAGES


Publish It! lets you work on a document in four different views. To change to a
different view, choose a size from the SPECIAL menu. You will be able to edit
text, define graphics, or use the arrow to move and resize objects in any view
as shown later.

1. With the SHOW FULL SIZE option, you can see text and graphic elements on the
   display in the size they will appear on your print-out. However, you can only
   view a portion of the page at a time.

2. The SHOW HALF SIZE option shows the page at about half the size that it will
   print out. You will view the page in full width, but will be able to view
   only a portion of the length.

3. SHOW DOUBLE SIZE is like a close-up. Use for fine tuning your text or graphic
   elements. Use the scroll arrows and scroll boxes on the sides of the screen's
   work area to move the page up, down and from side to side so you can view
   different sections of it. As you move. the rulers on the top and sides will
   inform you of your location on the page.

4. Use the SIZE TO FIT option if you would like to view the whole page at once.
   You may not see the text clearly because of its reduced size, but you can see
   what your layout looks like. Your page will appear on the left half of the
   screen.

In all views except Full Size, imported bit maps (graphics) will be represented
as grey shaded boxes. When in FULL SIZE, the picture itself will be visible.

WARNING....You cannot print anything you place outside the page area in the SIZE
TO FIT view, but you can use that area to try out ideas and then move them to
the left half of the screen. Anything on the right side will be saved, even
though it will not be printed.

                                  WHITE SPACE

When laying out your page, keep in mind that the absence of objects is important
too. The space left over after you have everything in place, in fact, becomes as
much a part of the page as the elements you inserted. This is called white
space. Used properly, it adds pleasing contrast to the art and text on the page.
So, when you're reviewing your page layout, take a moment to review the size of
the margins, the amount of space between the lines of text, the amount of space
around the art work, and the distances between the headlines and the body copy.
White space adds to a crisp, clean looking page. Avoid, however what is called
negative white space, that is , white space surrounded by art or text. This
white space is considered undesirable because it resembles a doughnut hole on a
page.

                            AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

All page layouts should consider the audience. Obviously, the audience for an
advertising flyer is not expecting something that looks like a wedding
invitation. A greater proportion of black to white may be perfectly acceptable
in an ad, but very unacceptable in a poetic greeting card. As you design each
document, try to put yourself in the readers shoes. If you're writing for senior
citizens, for example maybe you don't want 9-point text. Perhaps 12-point is a
better choice.

                            CHOOSING MEASURING UNITS

Choosing measurement units for the on-screen rulers is as simple as choosing
Select Unit Measure from the Special menu. With this option, you are free to
choose the unit of measure with which you want to work. Inches, Centimeters, or
Picas ( 6 Picas = 1 inch).
NOTE....In publish It!, picas will be both the horizontal and vertical unit of
measurement, even though the type fonts will be measured in points. A point is
1/12th of o pica (1/72 of an inch).

The default settings are in inches. The units of measure chosen here affect the
on-screen rulers and other measurements, especially in the FORMAT, PAGE and
OBJECTS menus.

                          SETTING THE ON-SCREEN RULERS

Rulers help place items and size them on the page with reasonable precision. Two
indicators, one on each ruler, show the position of the mouse pointer at any
time. As you scroll the page, the rulers change to reflect the current position.

The Show Rulers option toggles the horizontal and vertical rulers on and off.
Rulers are very helpful when laying out a page, but as you work on text, you may
want the extra screen space that is made available by turning off the rulers.

Now that you understand the concepts of objects, let's talk about specific ways
you can use them, beginning with your text.

                             CREATING TEXT COLUMNS

Move the pointer to [T] in the tool box and click on the Text tool. Notice how
this tool is now highlighted and arrow is deselected. You are ready to create a
text column.

Simply move the mouse into the work area. As long as the [T] tool is active,
every drag in the work area will start a new column.

A text column is a defined region on the screen which resembles an empty box or
frame (if you have the column outlines turned on). The program displays a
rectangle to indicate the border of the new text column, so you can judge its
size and shape as you create it. If you move the pointer past the window
boundary while creating a text column, the window scrolls automatically.

Release the mouse button when the column is the right size. If a guide is
visible and SNAP TO GUIDES are selected, your text column will snap to the
nearest guide.

Text may be entered from the keyboard or imported from another file to a
particular text column or to a specified series of columns.
Publish it! considers text columns to be objects, so you can drag, resize,
delete, cut, copy and paste using the pointer. Remember, if you cut or copy a
text column, the frame, not the text within is cut or copied. A little
experimentation with this function will show you how to create text columns of
all sizes any where on the screen, including on top of each other.

NOTE...At least one column must exist before you can enter or import text.
Furthermore, Publish It! will not allow text to be placed outside of the text
column. Two or more text columns must exist before you can link them for the
flow of text.

                                  SETTING TABS

To set tabs on your page, select the TABS...option on the PAGE menu. A Dialog
box will appear. Click on the first input box and type in the tab setting you
want. You do not have to enter the tabs in order. They will be put in order for
you. You can set up to six tab stops per page. Tabs are measured in inches,
centimeters or picas, as set in the SET UNIT MEASURE...option of the SPECIAL
menu. To move the text insertion point to a tab location, press the TAB key on
your keyboard.

                        THE TEXT TOOL AND ENTERING TEXT

There are two ways to enter text: either use its built-in word-processor or
import text from your own word processor or other programs. Before you can enter
any text, you need to create a text column as explained before.
To enter text, select the I-BEAM tool and click the I-BEAM pointer on the next
column in which you want to work.
The text insertion point will appear and you can begin typing. As you type,
words wrap automatically at the end of the line . Text will fill the column and
any overflowed (extra) text will be indicated by a double width border at the
bottom of the text column (assuming Show Column Outline is on).The appearance of
your text input depends on the font you're using and on the size of your screen
objects. The default font is Deerfield 12 point. Text layout within the column
depends on the settings for FORMAT and PAGE.

                                 SELECTING TEXT

You must select [I] before you can select many of the text functions. You can
change fonts, type sizes or styles (special effects) for text already entered.
Drag the I-BEAM pointer [I] over the text you want to change to highlight a text
block. Then, select a new font or style from the FONT menu.

                                 IMPORTING TEXT

Text columns may also be filled with text imported from other documents. Publish
It! reads documents created by Appleworks and Bank Street Writer directly and
most other word processors if the files are in standard ASCII.
To import text, select [I], and click on the text column you want the file to be
placed in. Choose Import Text File from the File menu (or Import Appleworks File
or Import Bank Street Writer file).

A Dialog box will appear with a list of file names. Select the one you want.

To import the file and return to your document, click on OK.

REMEMBER...you can double click on file names to open them).

The files do not have to be just word processing files. If they are ASCII files,
you can import data base and spreadsheets too.

When importing files, the program only looks for the files on the disk drive
currently selected as the data disk drive. Make sure you have the correct disk
in the drive.

NOTE...The Import Text File option will be dim and unavailable on the menu,
unless you have clicked on the [I] in your text column to create an insertion
point.

Importing Appleworks files this way will preserve underline, bold,superscript
and subscript text. Bank Street Writer files cannot be distinguished from
picture or other program files, so be careful when selecting the file name.
Other formatting options, such as tabs indent and margins must be assigned in
Publish It!.

                              LINKING TEXT COLUMNS

In publish It ,Text columns are usually independent objects.
To support articles that span several columns (and even pages), the program lets
you link text columns together in a chain. If text in a linked column is edited
the entire chain is automatically updated. For example, if you enter text in the
first of two linked columns, text overflows automatically into the second
column. If you resize the text column, the program dynamically reflows the text
to fit the new column size. Use the Link Tool to link text columns by clicking
on each column in the sequence you want your text to flow. If the text columns
are on different pages, flip the pages with the left-right arrows between clicks
of the linking tool. When you finish creating the chain, click on the linking
tool again to complete the link. When you enter or import text, it will
automatically flow through the text columns in the order in which you have
linked.

To relink a series of columns, click on the linking tool and then click on the
new series of columns starting with the original column.

                               UNLINKING COLUMNS

To unlink columns,double click on the column you want unlinked. For example, you
have linked three columns -1, 2, and 3. Double click on column 2, and the text
will disappear from it. Columns 1 and 3 are still linked and 3 will contain the
text that was previously in 2. When you have unlinked a column, click on the
linking tool in the tool box to complete the process.

                               INSERTING COLUMNS

If you insert columns into an existing chain, use the linking tool to link them.
Click on a column in the chain and then click on the new text columns. When
you're finished, click on the linking tool in the tool box to complete linking
process. If you cut or copy and paste linked text columns from another page or
document, you must use the linking tool to relink the text columns.

                                DELETING COLUMNS

Columns are objects, so they may be cut, copied or deleted as instructed
earlier. However, the text within a column is treated separately. If you delete
the middle column of a three column page, the text within that column would
reflow to the third column ( assuming they were linked). If you try to delete a
single column without links that contains text, the program will warn you that
you are about to lose that text, as text cannot exist independently of a column.

                                RULES OF LINKING

There are some rules to linking that you must observe:
Selecting the linking tool (looks like one page on top of another), you will see
a small hook on the bottom of the linking tool. The first click of linking tool
establishes the start of a chain (or insertion into a chain) and moves the hook
to the top of the linking box. Subsequent clicks on different columns create the
links. Clicking on linking tool in the tool box ends the chain.

Columns selected with the pointer can be deleted by the delete key, but the text
remains and is distributed to other columns, if any remain in the chain. If no
columns remain, the text in the deleted column is lost. A Dialog box will appear
giving you a chance to change your mind.

Columns selected with the pointer are removed completely from a chain by CUT.
All linking information will be lost.

Paste does not insert a column into a chain. Use the linking tool to link
columns.

A column can only belong to one chain at a time.

Double clicking with the linking tool unlinks a text column from a chain.

Linking is not permitted to a previous page.

                               EDITING YOUR TEXT

Editing text is the same as in any word processor. Following is a discussion on
how to delete, cut, copy and paste text.

Deleting Text.....
First be sure the I-Beam is selected from the tool box. To delete a section of
text from within a text column, highlight the text by dragging, then press the
delete key or choose CUT from the EDIT menu (O-Apple-X). Delete erases text
permanently. CUT moves text to the clipboard where it can later be recovered
with Paste. The text to be cut can be as little as one character or as long as
about 1000 characters.

Cutting and Pasting Text.....
Highlight the text you wish to move. Pull down the Edit menu and choose CUT or
O-Apple-X. The selected text will disappear from the screen and be stored on the
clipboard. Choose a new insertion point with the I-Beam and select Paste from
the Edit menu (O-Apple-V). Paste retrieves the text from the clipboard and
places it at the new insertion point. You may continue to paste the cut text as
many times as you want until you cut or copy again.

Copying and Pasting Text.....
Use copy to place selected text in the internal clipboard while leaving it on
the screen. To copy, highlight a text range and choose Copy from the Edit menu,
or use O-Apple-C. The selected text will not disappear from the screen (but will
be held in the clipboard until you are ready to use it). Point and click at the
position you want to place it (on the same or another page). Choose Paste from
the Edit menu or O-Apple-V. You can repeat the last two steps if you want to
insert the selected text in more than one location.

Finding Text.....
Publish It can search your text for a particular character, word or phrase
(numbers too) and, if you want, replace it with something else. These features
are found in the Edit menu labeled FIND..., FIND NEXT, REPLACE...and REPLACE and
FIND.

To find a particular word or phrase, move the I-BEAM to the first character in
the text column you want to search. Click (a text insertion point will appear).
Select the Find option on the EDIT menu and type the text you are searching for
in the Dialog box. Then click on OK. If the search was successful, the
character, word or phrase will be high lighted on the screen, and a text
insertion point will appear at the end of the highlighted text. Once a
character, word or phrase has been entered in the Dialog box of the Find
command, every occurrence can be found in the same page by using the FIND NEXT
option. To repeat the search, select FIND NEXT or press O-Apple-F.
NOTE...You must use Find before you can use FIND NEXT.
If the search was unsuccessful or no more occurrences are found, an Alert box
will tell you so.

NOTE... When the text is highlighted, you can manipulate or change the text
area, using options in the EDIT and FONT menus. The text could, for example, be
changed from plain to bold, to another font or size, or it could be copied and
pasted elsewhere.

Replacing Text.....
To replace a text string in your document, use REPLACE from the EDIT menu. This
command enables you to find a character, word or phrase and replace it with
another. It is especially useful when editing large amounts of text within
Publish It. Since the program remembers the last used find and replace string,
you can easily change either string in the Dialog box. To use this option, move
the I-BEAM to the first character in the text column you want to search. Click
and a text insertion point will appear. Choose REPLACE from the EDIT menu. A
dialog box will appear. Click on the top box and type in the character, word or
phrase, you want to find. Move to the next box, click (or use the TAB key), and
type in the replacement text. Click on FIND. You'll be informed if the string is
not found.

Once a character, word or phrase to find, and a replacement has been defined in
the Dialog box under REPLACE, you can repeat the sequence throughout the entire
page. Choose REPLACE and FIND from the EDIT menu (O-Apple-R). Use O-Apple-F to
find the next occurrence without replacing.

Sticky Spaces.....
If you have a phrase or name that you don't want to split between two lines, use
the Sticky Space option. Bill Johnson, Sticky Spaces and Search & Replace, for
example, could all use sticky spaces. When Publish It wraps words from one line
to another and a sticky space has been entered, it will treat the group of words
as one. If the group is too long to fit at the end of a line, Publish It moves
the whole group together to the next line. To use Sticky Space, put the I-BEAM
between two words and press O-Apple-Spacebar. Repeat as often as necessary.

Soft Hyphens.....
If a word is broken at a point you don't like, you can change it. Click on the
word at the point you would insert a hyphen should the word need to be broken.
Press O-Apple-Dash (-). As the text flows, if that word is broken, Publish It
will insert a Hyphen at that point. Later, as you make changes in text and the
column rewraps, that hyphen will disappear if the word no longer needs to be
broken and reappear later if needed. You can place as many soft hyphens in a
word as necessary.

Number Spaces.....
When creating tables of numbers in the program, you will find that all digits
take up the same amount of space, that is,they are not proportionally spaced as
alphabetic characters are. Consequently, pressing the spacebar between columns
of digits introduces uneven spacing, since spaces are considered alphabetic
characters. To solve this dilemma, we have included number spaces. Number
spaces, as their name implies, take up the same amount of space as a digit.
Press the O-Apple-O to get a number space. When you use number space, lines of
text will be easier to align than with variable word spacing.
Automatic Runaround.....

If you have completed columns of text and then decide to drop in an object,
Publish It automatically flows text around the new object.


                                Text Formatting

You can set the justification, spacing and margin/indents for all the text on
the entire page. Select these options from the PAGE menu to do so. These options
require that the I-BEAM be selected before you select them.
NOTE.....Most of the settings in the page menu become the default settings for
the options in the FORMAT menu, unless you decide to specifically change a
setting for a particular document.
The sections below give you details on using the Justification, Spacing and
Margins/Indent options on the Format pull down menu. Use the same procedures for
these options on the PAGE pull down menu.

Justifying Paragraphs.....
You can align text in the paragraph you are currently working in using the
FORMAT menu. You can justify text left or right, aligning text on the left or
right column margin, leaving the other margin ragged or uneven. Two other
choices are Full and Center. Full justification will make the paragraph look
like a newspaper or book column, aligned on both sides. Center will make the
column ragged on both sides by centering each line. Justification can be applied
to a single paragraph, selected paragraphs or the whole page. To change the
justification characteristics of an individual line, click on any line in the
paragraph line you wish to work on with the I-Beam. Then pull down the FORMAT
menu and choose Justification.

NOTE...The Use Page Standard selections refer to the values entered in the
Margins/Indents option on the PAGE menu.

A Dialog box will appear. Click on the options you want to use. (You must click
the Use Page Standard setting off if you want to change the justification of
this paragraph or group of paragraphs).

Note....The options on the FORMAT menu only affect the paragraph the text
insertion point is currently in or the group of paragraphs you have selected.
The similar options on the PAGE menu affect all the text on the entire page.
Those options will not be available if you have highlighted a block of text.

Justification can apply to groups of paragraphs; simply highlight the paragraph
and choose Justification.

Letter Spacing.....
You also have the ability to change the horizontal and vertical spacing between
letters, words, lines and paragraphs. To change any of this type of spacing,
click at a point in the paragraph where you want to work. Then select the
Spacing option on the FORMAT menu and a dialog box will appear. Click on your
selection and enter revised spacing for the item. Then click on the box next to
the Use Page Standard for that item to deactivate current settings.

Letter Spacing.....
Letter spacing is the exact opposite of kerning. You will use this option to
move all the letters in a paragraph further apart. To space letters, use the
I-BEAM to select the paragraph with the letters you want to space. Select the
Spacing option on the FORMAT menu and type a value (inches, cms, picas) in for
letter spacing. When you click on OK, the letters will be spaced that many
points apart.

Word Spacing.....
 The word spacing option on the Spacing Dialog Box is used to modify the spacing
between words in a paragraph.
Click the I-BEAM on the paragraph with the words you want to work with and then
select the Spacing option on the FORMAT menu. When the dialog box appears, click
on the word spacing entry box and enter the new spacing you would like to use.

Line Spacing.....
Lines of text are also spaced vertically within a paragraph. to change the
spacing between lines (also referred to as leading), select your paragraph and
choose Spacing from the FORMAT menu. When the Dialogue box appears, enter the
desired spacing in points. The value you specify represents the distance, in
points, added between the lines of text.

Paragraph Spacing.....
Paragraph spacing is the amount of spacing between paragraphs. Normally, spacing
between paragraphs is the same as between lines. Paragraph spacing is changed by
selecting a range of paragraphs, choosing Spacing from the FORMAT menu, and
typing a new value in the dialog box, followed by clicking on OK. The program
then adds the point value as extra space before the paragraph. Click on OK to
return to your document.

Margins and Indents.....
Choose Margins/Indents to set or change your left or right margins and paragraph
indents. Use the I-BEAM to select a paragraph, then select Margins/Indents
option on the FORMAT menu. A dialog box will appear.  Enter the left, first line
and right margins, then click on OK. To make your paragraphs hanging, that is,
with the first line set out from the remainder, set the left margin indent to a
value more than 0 and click on Hanging. Use the right margin specification to
tell the computer the distance from the right edge of the text column to the
right edge of the text. Set both left and right margins for a paragraph, as for
long quotations. The first line is for typical, non-block style paragraph
indentation.

Kerning.....
Spacing between letter pairs is controlled by the defined width of each
character. In certain cases you may wish to change the spacing on a
character-by-character basis. With Publish IT you can reposition individual
characters, moving them closer together using KERN from the FORMAT menu. A
typical situation where a change in character spacing is warrented, is with
certain combinations of letters like AV, that show too much space between them.
To move the letters AV together, place the I-BEAM between the two letters you
want to kern and click. The text insertion point will appear between the
letters. Choose KERN from the FORMAT menu and a Dialog box will appear. Type in
the number of points you want to remove in the selected space. When you click on
OK, the spacing between the letters is reduced by that number of points. The
larger the number, the closer together the two letters move. (you must repeat
this sequence each time you want to reduce the space between letter pairs).

NOTE.....Sometimes text on the screen may appear to need kerning because the on
screen representation of the text does not exactly match what will be printed
out. We suggest that you do a test print-out before deciding to kern.

To increase space between two characters, Place an extra space between then and
then kern.

Fonts, Faces and Special Effects.....
Text font, size and style are chosen from the font menu. As with other text
options, these are assigned by selecting a text range and then choosing the
appropriate menu options. Publish It! automatically chooses Deerfield 12-point
as the start-up text font. To change to a new font, select block of text, or
just click on I-BEAM and then select Select Font from the font menu, or
O-Apple-W. A scrolling dialog box will appear with all the available fonts and
sizes. Click on the font size you want to use. Then click on OPEN. The text you
have selected will convert to this font and size.

Style (special effects) options are selected from the font menu also. Style
choices include Plain, Bold, Italic, Underline, Outline, Shadow, Superscript and
subscript.If you establish a new text type (font, size and style)without
selecting a block of characters, the text insertion point takes on the chosen
text type, so any characters typed from that point on will be in the new type.

To quickly cycle through the different type options, pull down the font menu and
you will see these options:

     NEXT SIZE...(O-Apple-N)
     NEXT TYPE FACE...(O-Apple-T)

Highlight a block of text and then press O-Apple-T or select the Next Type Face
option from the font menu. The block you have marked will automatically changer
to the next type face available in the same size. If you press O-Apple-T again,
it will change again. Keep pressing and it will cycle through to the original
type face again.

Press O-Apple-N or select Next Size option to cycle through the available type
sizes for the current font. This is a convenient way to view alternatives right
on the computer display.

Plain Text.....
Use this option to return to the basic (plain) style of a type face if you have
been using, for example, Bold or Italics. Select a range of text, then choose
Plain from the Font menu, or O-Apple-P. This will erase all the attributes
(bold, italics, etc.) of the selected text.

Bold Face.....
Choose Bold for a more dramatic (thicker) style of type face. Select a range of
text, then choose Bold from the Font menu, or O-Apple-B.
Italics.....

Choose Italics to make a word or phrase stand out (slanted) from the rest of the
text. Select a range of text then choose Italics from the Font menu, or
O-Apple-I

Underlining Text.....
Choose underline as another way to make a word or phrase stand out from the rest
of the text. Select a range of text, then choose Underline from the Font menu,
or O-Apple-U.

Outlined Faced Lettering.....
Outline is a Graphic style of a font. Each letter looks like a frame. It should
be used sparingly for such things as announcements, invitations or brochures.
Select a range of text, then choose Outline from the Font menu.
Shadow Faced Lettering.....

Like Outline, shadow should be used sparingly for special effects. To use this
option, select a range of text, then choose Shadow from the Font menu.

Superscript.....
Superscript and subscript are used mostly in technical publications (i.e.
footnotes in a mathematical, medical article). Choose Superscript  to set text a
half line above the other text. Select a range of text, then choose Superscript
from the Font menu, or O-Apple-H.

Subscript....
Same as Superscript, except sets type a half line below the other text. Select a
range of text, then choose Subscript from the Font menu, or O-Apple-L.
Combining Styles of a Type Face....

You can combine all styles of a type face (bold, italics,underline etc.) except
Superscript and Subscript for special effects or emphasis. To combine styles:

1. Select a range of text, then choose the first style  (i.e. Bold) from the
   Font menu to select and you are returned to the screens work area.

2. Pull down the Font menu. You will see a check mark next to Bold, which
   indicates it has been selected.

3. Select the next style and you are returned to the screens work area.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as many times as you want. If you click on a style
   again, the check mark will disappear, and that style will no longer be
   active. You will be in the combined style until you select another style or
   face.

Creating your Graphics.....
There are two ways to include graphics in your publications.

1. Create graphics with the drawing tools included in the program. These tools
   can be used to draw simple objects such as lines, circles, boxes, etc.. You
   can also use these tools to highlight elements of your page layout.

2. Import graphics from other sources. Publish It! recognizes standard Apple
   high res graphics. Dazzle Draw, MousePaint, Computer Eyes from Digital Vision
   can also produce this type of graphic.

Another way to include graphics in your publications that will be professionally
printed, is to leave a "Hole" on your page and insert the graphic before it is
reproduced.

Graphic Objects.......
You can add lines, rectangles, circles and round cornered rectangles to your
pages using a variety of line types, widths and patterns. Publish It provides
four graphic object tools: line, rectangle, round-cornered rectangle, and
circle. Use [l-] to create either horizontal or vertical lines (rules) by
dragging up or down, left or right. Select [ [] ] to create a square or
rectangle with right angle corners. Select [ (_) ] to create a square or
rectangle with rounded corners. Select [O] to create circles. All these types of
objects may be moved, overlayed, underlayed, resized or deleted by using the
arrow (pointer). You can create interesting visual effects by experimenting with
the pen patterns for borders and fill patterns.

A moving rectangle indicates the size of the object being drawn. If the cross
hair pointer leaves the window area, the window scrolls automatically. You can
also use guides and the Snap to Guides option.
Line Weights and Pen Patterns....

The program provides a large assortment of widths and styles for borders and
lines. You can choose from six solid line widths and 24 pen patterns, including
eight user defined pen patterns. Change the width or style of a selected line
with Set Line Width, or the outline of a filled box or circle with Set Pen
Pattern on the Objects menu. To change a line weight or pen pattern, select the
object by clicking on it with the pointer and, selecting this option from the
Objects menu.

Selecting Fill Patterns.....
The program features 24 fill patterns that can be used for the interiors of
graphic objects and offers the ability to create your own pattern with Define
Pattern. To choose a fill pattern, select a graphic object, then select the Set
Fill Pattern option on the Objects menu. A Selected pattern fills the interior
of any selected object. The selected pattern becomes the default until you
change it. To change a fill pattern, select the object, then select this option.
Click on the fill pattern you want. Then, click on O-Apple.

Defining a New Pattern.....
Design your own or modify any one of up to eight existing patterns. Selecting
this option will bring up a Dialog box with eight pen or fill patterns which you
can define. Click on a pattern and select it. The currently chosen pattern is
shown in a close-up cell at the right. The Work Area is at the bottom left.
Clicking on a cell in the 8 X 8 matrix shown in the dialog box, will toggle it
black or white. Choose Define Pattern from the Special menu. AS dialog box will
appear. Click on a pattern to select it. To design your own pattern, a work area
is provided at the bottom left of the dialog box. Your new design will be stored
on disk when you click on OK.

                               Importing Art work

Publish It! lets you add graphic elements to your documents, lending them a
professional appearance. Before you can insert pictures on a page, you must
create graphic frames to house the art work. Graphic frames are created with the
graphic frame tool [X] from the tool box. Position the [X] in the area where you
want to insert the picture and drag it across the page to define the size of the
graphic frame. If you have the Snap To Guides on, the block will snap to the
nearest grid boundaries automatically. Graphic frames appear as shaded boxes on
the screen. this provides a visual way of distinguishing the from text columns.
Graphic frames are objects, They can be moved, resized, cut, copied, pasted and
deleted like any other object.

NOTE....You cannot create a graphic frame that is larger than the importing
screen-- about 4 2/3" X 2 2/3".

Publish It can directly access Dazzle Draw, MousePaint, and Beagle Graphics
files or any other pictures in Apple standard high res or double high res
format.

To Import Art work.....

1. Insert the disk containing the art file into the drive you have designated
   for data.

2. Select a graphic frame by clicking on it with the pointer and choose Import
   Picture from the File menu.

3. A dialog box appears, listing all the picture files on the data drive. If
   necessary, scroll the list to locate the picture you wish to import. Click on
   the file name, then click on OK. The picture will appear in full size on the
   display.

4. A box is shown along with the picture to indicate the size of the graphic
   frame in your document. Drag this cropping box until it is around the part of
   the picture you want. You may change the size of the cropping box with the
   O-Apple key and the arrow keys. You may also use the arrow keys to move the
   box. When you are satisfied, press return.

   You will return to your document with the picture in the graphic frame you
   have selected.

NOTE.......You will only be able to view the picture in the Show Full Size
display. When you are in other viewing modes, bit maps are represented with a
shaded box. The art work you cropped will print out completely, and be the
proper size. If you import a small piece of a bit mapped picture, and
subsequently enlarge the graphic frame, the extra area is shown as gray shading,
because the area shown outside the crop box, is discarded when you return to
your document. If you find you need a part of the bit map that fell outside the
crop box, you should resize the frame and import the picture again.

Adding the Finishing Touches.....
The difference between an OKAY looking document and a GREAT looking document is
often nothing more than a slight adjustment here and there and one more pass
through the printer. So, consider your first print-out a draft. Look it over and
see what you can do to make it better. Don't be afraid to experiment. With
practice, each draft will be better than the one before.

Printing Your Documents.....
Printers are an intregal part of your desktop publishing system. Most dot matrix
printers produce output at a resolution of 120 dots-per-inch horizontally by 72
vertically, well suited for inter-office memos, newsletters, and other documents
you'll produce with this program. You should find this print resolution easy to
read and suitable for most of you publishing needs. For extra contrast, you can
choose the Double Strike option from the Print dialog box (on the File menu)
when its time to print.

To print your document on a laser printer, you will need to use Timeworks
Publish It Laser Pack. Instructions are included with this program.

The Page Numbering Tool....
Selecting [#] from the tool box enables you to create a page number up to 100,
for the page you are currently working on. Just click on [#], then click
anywhere on your document. An object containing a "#" will be created. This
object cannot be resized, but can be repositioned.

After you have defined the page number, you may change it by clicking on the
pointer to reposition it. The page will be given a sequential number during
printing. To change the font, select the page number object [#] on your page and
change the font size using Select Font from the Font menu.

How To Print.....
To print a document, choose Print from the File menu. A dialog box will appear.
Normally you'll want to print all the pages of a document, but a number of
possible choices are available:

ALL---
All the pages of the current document are printed.

FROM/TO---
Lets you pick a range of pages you want to print. Click on the radio button,
then type in the numbers of the first and last pages you want printed.

COPIES---
If you want more than one copy, type the number you want.

START PAGE #s at PAGE---
If you have page numbers, enter the page number from which you want to start
printing. This is useful when printing multi-page documents that are stored in
several different disk files.

DOUBLE STRIKE---Select this if you want your copies to appear darker.

PAUSE FOR PAGE---Choose this option to make the printer stop at the end of each
page to allow you to hand feed another sheet.

The OK and CANCEL buttons let you begin printing or cancel. Printing can be
canceled or momentarily suspended at any time by pressing the appropriate key
shown in the dialog box that appears while the program is printing the document.

Exiting Publish It!
Use Quit to exit Publish It! Just choose Quit from the File menu or O-Apple-Q. A
dialog box will appear and ask for confirmation. To exit the program, click on
OK. If you have a program selector installed (such as ProSel or Catalyst), Quit
will return you to your selector.

Appendix....There are a few more chapters in the manual, but these appear to be
the same as the Mini- manual which was up-loaded earlier. There are some
pictures in the manual which I cannot reproduce for you so, I tried to explain
it all with words. I am sure you can learn to run the program very expertly from
the instructions. To load the program on a hard drive, load all the files from
the program disk as you normally would. Include all the font files and art
files. then set it up in your program selector. (such as ProSel, or the one that
you have installed yourself. Be patient with the program, and read all the
instructions. Everything you need to know has been covered here.
