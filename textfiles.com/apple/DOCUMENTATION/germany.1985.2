NIGHT MOVEMENT
--------------

DURING  A  NIGHT TURN, SIGHTING DISTANCE IS LIMITED TO 2 HEXES.  AIRCV
UNITS HAVE THEIR MOVEMENT ALLOWANCE HALVED. 

NIGHT TURNS ARE INDICATED BY WHITE TERRAIN,  UNLESS  THE  "B"  KEY  IS
HIT.  THE TURN COUNTER IS INVERSE WHEN NIGHT IS OCCURING. 

NIGHT OCCURS ON TURNS:  5,6 & 11,12 & 17,18

COMBAT
------

WHEN  AN  ENEMY UNIT ENTERS AN ECH (ENEMY CONTROLLED HEX) OR CTRL-C IS
HIT, COMBAT IS INITIATED. 

THE COMPUTER RESOLVES COMBAT CONSIDERING: 

THE NUMBER OF ENEMIES SIGHTING THE ATTACKER

THE NUMBER OF FRIENDLY UNITS SIGHTING

THE DEFENDER

THE TERRAIN THE DEFENDER IS IN

THE NUMBER OF FRIENDLY UNITS SUPPORTING THE ATTACKER

THE NUMBER OF ENEMY UNITS SUPPORTING

THE DEFENSE

THE DISTANCE FROM COMBAT OF THE RESPECTIVE HQ UNITS

THE EFFICIENCES, STRENGTHS, MODES, AND TYPERS OF THE UNITS ENGAGED

THE AMOUNT OF ARTILLERY FIRE THE DEFENDER HAS SUFFERED

ALL ADJACENT DEFENDING UNITS ARE ATTACKED FIRST BEFORE  THE  ATTACKING
UNIT  CAN SUFFER LOSES.  A UNIT SUPPORTS THE ATTACK BY BEING IN SUPPRT
MODE, WITHIN 3 HEXES OF ATTACKED, UNMOVED  AND  WITH  NO  ENEMY  UNITS
ADJACENT TO IT.  VICE VERSA FOR DEFENDING UNITS.  HQ UNITS SUPPORT THE
ATTACK  IF  THEY ARE WITHIN 9 HEXES (BONUS AT 4 HEXES) AND ARE WITHOUT
ANY ADJACENT ENEMY UNITS. 

ARTILLERY BONUS
---------------

AN ENEMY UNIT HIT BY ARTILLERY WILL SUFFER A LOSS IN EFFICIENCY.   FOR
THE  USE  OF  FRIENDLY  COMBAT, ONLY THE FIRST 2 HITS HAVE ANY EFFECT.
ARTILLERY WILL NOT AFFECT A RETREATED UNIT. 

RETREATS AFTER COMBAT
---------------------

AFTER COMBAT, A DEFENDING UNIT MAY BE  FORCED  TO  RETREAT.   IN  THAT
CASE,  IT  WILL  SWITCH  TO NORM MODE (OR FIRE MODE FOR ARTILLERY) AND
RETREAT. 

A RETREATING UNIT MUST FOLLOW NORMAL RULES AND NOT ABUSE IT'S MP'S

A RETREATING UNIT CAN'T INITIATE COMBAT

A RETREATING UNIT THAT FAILS TO RETREAT THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF  HEXES,
WILL  SUFFER  ADDITIONAL  LOSES AND MAY BE DESTROYED.  IF THE UNIT CAN
NOT RETREAT 1 HEX, IT WILL ENTER DEFENSE MODE. 

A UNIT MAY RETREAT ONLY ONCE DURING A TURN.   IF  IT  IS  REQUIRED  TO
RETREAT AGAIN, IT WILL INSTEAD SUFFER LOSES. 

DURING  THE  NEXT  MOVEMENT PHASE, NOT INCLUDING AIRCV UNITS, THE UNIT
WILL HAVE ONLY 1/2 NORMAL MP'S. 

COMBAT DISPLAY
--------------

DURING COMBAT, THE FOLLOWING WILL BE DISPLAYED: 

UNIT: 
TYPE

STRN: 
OF THE DEFENDER (LIGHT, MEDIUM, OR HEAVY)

RSLT: 
(RESULT) SEE LATER IN DOCS FOR EXPLANATION OF COMBAT RESOLUTION

ARTILLERY
---------

A UNIT MAY BE FIRED BY: 

PRESS "O" AND THEN "F"

BEING CALLED INTO SUPPORT WHEN IN SUPPRT MODE

OPERATED  MANUALLY  BY  ENTERING  FIRE  MODE   AND   HITTING   CTRL-F,
POSITIONING CURSOR, AND HITTING: 

CTRL-F: 
FIRE

CTRL-S: 
SMOKE

CTRL-X: 
RETURN  TO  MOVEMENT  PHASE  (WHEN IN THIS PHASE, THE COMMANDS WILL BE
DISPLAYED IN INVERSE IF ILLEGAL)

RUSSIAN NOTE: THE RUSSIANS MUST USE THE  SAME  DIVISION  TO  SIGHT  AN
ENEMY

ARTILLERY SIGHTING
------------------

A  UNIT MAY ONLY FIRE ON A SIGHTED ENEMY.  ANY FRIENDLY UNIT MAY SIGHT
FOR ARTILLERY.  THE "O" "F" SEQUENCE WILL NOT FIRE  ON  HIDDEN  UNITS,
THE MANUAL APPROACH MUST BE USED TO DO THIS. 

AIR POWER
---------

WHEN CTRL-A IS HIT, THE FOLLOWING WILL BE DISPLAYED: 

NATO: #:#: RUSSIAN           :ALC:KEYS
(A) SUPERIORTY        :SPARE #: #: 0-9
(T)AC. SUPPORT        :STRKE #  #  C/F

#--A NUMBER BETWEEN 0-9

THE SIDE IN INVERSE HAS SUPERIORTY.  IF BOTH SIDES ARE NORMAL, NEITHER
HAS SUPERIORTY. 

AIR SUPERIORTY
--------------

WHEN  THE MENU IS DISPLAYED, THE PLAYER MAY ALLOCATE 0-9 POINTS.  THIS
IS DONE BY HITTING "A" AND THEN THE NUMBER. 

SUPERIORTY IS DECIDED BY THE SIDE WHICH HAS MORE POINTS.  A PLAYER MAY
GET 1-2 EXTRA POINTS IF HE HAS HELF SUPERIORTY FOR MORE THAN 2 TURNS. 

TACTICAL AIR STRIKES
--------------------

IN TURNS 0-3, A PLAYED CAN ALLOCATE 3 STRIKES.  THIS CAN BE CHANGED BY
1-2 DURING THE LATER TURNS. 

TO ALLOCATE THE STRIKES, HIT "T" AND MOVE THE CURSOR TO THE PLACE  YOU
WANT AND HIT CTRL-F TO PLACE THE CURSOR. 

ON THE PLAYER'S NEXT TURN, WHEN CTRL-A IS HIT, AIR STRIKE MARKERS WILL
APPEAR  AT THE DESIGNATED PLACES.  THEY MAY THEN BE CALLED IN BY UNITS
ORDERING SUPPORT WITHIN 3 HEXES.  IF THE OPPONENT HAS AIR  SUPERIORTY,
THE STRIKES FAIL TO APPEAR. 

MINES AND NUCLEAR
-----------------

THESE OPTIONS MAY BE CALLED IN LATER IN THE GAME

REINFORCEMENTS
--------------

DURING  THE COURSE OF THE GAME, BOTH SIDES WILL RECIEVE REINFORCEMENTS
AT SPECIFIED PLACES.  THE REINFORCEMENTS WILL ARRIVE IN  AN  OVERSIZED
STACK WHICH IS MOVED AWAY. 

REORGANIZATION
--------------

MOST  UNITS  (NATO AND RUSSIAN) AT A RATE DECIDED UPON BY THE DISTANCE
FROM THE HQ. 

THE UNIT WILL INCREASE ITS STENGTH AND EFFICIENCY BY: 

3 IF WITH 0-4 HEXES (OR IS AN HQ) 2 IF WITHIN 5-9 HEXES FROM HQ  1  IF
DISTANCE IF 10+ FROM HQ

A UNIT WILL FAIL TO REORGANIZE OF IT IS ADJACENT TO AN ENEMY UNIT. 

A HIDDEN UNIT IN REOR MODE HAS A SIGHTING DISTANCE OF 2 HEXES

A  UNIT  WILL  INCREASE  TO  A  MAXIMUM  OF  12  STRENGTH POINTS AND 7
EFFICIENCY. 

BRIDGING
--------

THE ENGINEER UNIT CAN BE USED TO AID UNITS CROSSING A RIVER. 

            TANK------<< NEW POSITION
   RIVER  --------
             ^    \
             ^     \

                     \
                      \



SAVING THE GAME
---------------

TO SAVE THE GAME AT ANY TIME, JUST HIT CTRL-B.   A  SPECIAL  SSI  SAVE
DISK MUST BE INITIALIZED TO DO THIS. 

TO RELOAD THE GAME, REPEAT THE CTRL-B PROCESS, BUT POSITION THE ARROWS
NEXT  TO  A  NAME AND HIT <RETURN>.  YOU CAN ALSO USE THE RESTART GAME
FEATURE ON THE MAIN MENU. 

LEVEL STRUCTURE
---------------

THERE ARE 3 LEVELS OF PLAY.  I SUGGEST  THAT  YOU  START  OUT  ON  THE
EASIEST  LEVEL OR THE COMPUTER WILL BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF YOU.  CHANCES
ARE IT WILL DO THAT ANYWAY. 

SCENARIOS
---------

GAME WILL END AFTER THE 20,21, OR 22 TURN.  THE IS  A  50%  CHANCE  IT
WILL END ON TURN 21, AND A 25% CHANCE FOR TURNS 20 AND 22. 

ADVANCE TO COMBAT: 

NEITHER PLAYER CAN GET AIR SUPERIORITY FOR THE FIRST 2 TURNS

INVASION: 

THE RUSSIAN PLAYER HAS AIR SUPERIORITY FOR THE FIRST 2 TURNS.  IN TURN
0,  THE  NATO  PLAYER  HAS  THE  OPTION OF SETTING UP HIS FORCES.  THE
RUSSIAN SIDE PLACES 2 DROP ZONES FOR PARATROOPERS.  IT IS A GOOD  IDEA
TO  PLACE  THESE APART, BECAUSE IF A UNIT ATTEMPTS TO LAND ON A STACK,
IT WILL FAIL TO ARRIVE AND BE LOST FOREVER. 

VICTORY
-------

VICTORY IS ATTAINED BY WHO CONTROLS  THE  MOST  VILLAGES,  TOWN,  ETC.
USUALLY, WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING AND ONE SIDE IS KILLING THE OTHER, IT IS
BORING TO CONTINUE ANYHOW.
