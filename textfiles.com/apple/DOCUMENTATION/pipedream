        Can you think under pressure?  How about under flooz pressure?  You'll find out when you play pipe Dream, the fast-flowing game of speed, strategy, and plumbing.  Make your pipeline as long as you can, but always stay ahead of the flow or your score will go down the drain.
        Maybe you can imagine yourself as the plumber-in-chied at Acme Chemical Company.  OK?  Well, Acme has just invented this miracle sewer cleaner called flooz.  Problem is, they're making flooz faster than they can pipte it into tank card.  Your job is to build an emergency pipeline with spare plumbing parts, and keep Acme from sinking under a sea of sickly green sludge.
        Pipe Dream has 36 increasingly cunning levels, with almost infinite variations in each one.  There are three playing modes (basic, expert, and two-plumber) and a training mode that's a real plumber's helper.  What are you waiting for?  Take the plunge!


HOW TO PLAY PIPE DREAM
----------------------

        Pipe Dream starts on a playing field that is empty except for the starting piece.  The object is to score as many points as possible by constructing a continuous pipe from the starting piece.
        As you play, pipe pieces appear in a dispenser to the left of the playing field.  You can place a pipe anywhere you like, whether or not it connects with other pipe sections.  In fact, you'll learn to place pieces in a pattern that anticipates connections five or ten moves in advance.
        You can't rotate the pipes, nor can you alter the order in which they appear, nor can you skip a pipe and come back to it later.  You'll have to play 'em as then come.
        You can "bomb" a pipe by placing a new pipe on top of the previously played one.  The old pipe will explods and the new pipe will appear in its place.  There is a short time delay for replacing pipes, and a 50 point penalty.
        Once a pipe piece fills with flooz, you can no longer replace it.  And, at higher levels, the game field will contain advanced pipe pieces and obstacles.  You can't "bomb" and replace those special pieces that appear at the start of a round.
        After the round has started, a timer set for the level of difficulty in that round will allow the flooz to start flowing from the starting piece into the pipeline you're constructing.  Keep placing pipes and adding to the pipeline until the flooz catches up with you or spills off the edge of the playing field.  When the flooz reaches the end of your pipeline, the round is over.
        Once you've placed all the pipe pieces you can (or want to), press the "flow" (F) key (as in "fast flowing flooz") and the flooz will speed up and end the round quickly.  You will score double points for each additional pipe piece the flooz flows through.


ADVANCING TO THE NEXT LEVEL
---------------------------

        In order to advance to the next level, you must make the flooz flow through a certain number of pipes.  Look at the counter in the upper right corner of the screen.  At the star5t of each round, this counter tells you how many pipes the flooz has to flow through in order to advance to the next leve.  Then as the flooz flows through the pipeline, the counter decreases, keeping track of how many more pipes the flooz must go through.  When the counter reaches zero, you qualify for the next level.
        On higher levels, many things change:
        o The flooz flows at a faster rate.
        o Obstacles appear on the playing field.  You can't place pipes in
          those squares.
        o Bonus pieces may show up.  These earn you extra points if the flooz
          goes through them.
        o One-way pieces appear in your pipe dispenser.  The flooz can only
          flow through these in one direction.
        o End pieces show up.  In addition to acheiving the required pipeline
          length, you must direct the flooz into the end piece in order to
           advance to the next leve.
        o Reservoir pieces appear.  The flooz takes a little longer to fill
          these up, so they gain you some valuable time.
        o There are sections of the playing field that allow the flooz to exit
          one side of the screen and reappear on the other side.


SCORING
-------

BASIC GAME SCORING

o 50 points for each pipe the flooz flows through, until you reach the distance
  required to advance to the next level.

o 100 points for each pipe the flooz flows through after you reach the distance
  required to advance to the next level.

o 500 points for each time the flooz crosses itself in a cross pipe.  (If the
  flooz does not cross itself you can still receive 50 or 100 points for going
  through the cross pipe).

o 500 points for each bonus or reservoir piece the flooz flows through before
  you reach the distance required to advance to the next level.

o 1000 points for each bonus or reservoir piece the flooz flows through after
  you reach the distance required to advance to the next level.

o 1000 points for using the end piece.

o 100 point penalties at the end of the round for each unused pipe left on the
  playing field.

o 50 point penalty for each replacement made.

o After you hit the "flow" key, every pipe the flooz flows through earns you
  double the usual point value.


EXPERT ONE PLUMBER

The basic scoring rules apply, but:

o 100 bonus points are fiven every time the flooz flows through pipe pieces
  selected from alternating (top and bottom) dispensers.


COMPETITIVE TWO PLUMBER

The basic scoring rules apply but:

o Points from the flooz flowing through a pipe -- including the 500 point bonus
  for crossovers -- are scored only by the player who placed the pipe.

o The 100 point penalty from the flooz not flowing through a pipe is levied to
  the player who placed that pipe.

o The bonus piece points go to the player who placed the previous piece and
  connected it to the bonus piece.

        Two plumber Pipe Dream encourages both teamwork and competition.  You have to work together to keep the flow going, but you'll want the flooz to flow through more of your own pipes, and fewer of your opponent's.


PIPE DREAM PLAYING MODES
------------------------

        Pipe Dream has three playing modes:  basic one-plumber, expert one-plumber, and competitive two-plumber.  There is also a training mode that allows you to play any of these modes at a slower rate of flow.


BASIC ONE-PLUMBER

        Pipe pieces appear in a single dispenser on the left side of the screen.  You can always see the next five pipes in the dispenser.


EXPERT ONE-PLUMBER

        Pipe pieces appear in two dispensers on the left side of the screen, one above the other.  The pipe pieces nearest the middle of the screen are available to be placed on the playing field.  You can always see the next three and one-third pipes in each dispenser.


COMPETITIVE TWO-PLUMBER

        As in expert mode, pipe pieces appear in two dispensers on the left side of the screen.  Player One uses the pipes from the top dispenser, and Player Two uses the pipes from the bottom one.


PLAYING TIPS

o Use the training mode to become a good plumbing strategist.  Learn how to
  visualize the completed pipeline and place pieces accordingly.

o If you want a big score, don't be too eager to advance quickly to the next
  level.  Earn as many points as you can on each level.

o Think ahead.  If you don't need a piece rihgt away, put it where you can
  connect it later.  Blowing up pipes wastes time and valuable points.

o Use cross pipes wisely.  You only get a limited number of them, and each one
  can deliver bonus points.  Make sure you place them where there's room to
  loop back through.

o Even if you're way ahead of the flow, work fast.  That way, you'll have time
  to figure out how to fill as much of the playing field as possible.  Or you
  can press the "flow" key and score bonus points.
