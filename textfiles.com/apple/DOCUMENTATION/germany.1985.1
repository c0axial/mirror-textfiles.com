MOVEMENT POINTS
---------------

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MAXIMUM MP'S ALLOWED TO A UNIT

NATO      MP        RUSSIAN     MP
---------------------------------------
TANK      25        TANK        25
APC       25        BMP         25
SPG       20        ARTLY       18
AIRCV     30        KATCH       18
RECON     30        INF         15
ENG       20        ENG         20

NOTE:
AIRCV HAVE MP'S OF 15 AT NIGHT

THE  ACTUAL NUMBER OF MP'S DEPENDS WHAT MODE IT IS IN, AND WHETHER ITS
MAXIMUM MOVEMENT HAS BEEN HALVED.  THE FOLLOWING RATIOS  ARE  USED  TO
CALCULATE THE INITIAL MOVEMENT ALLOWANCE. (IE. TANK IN NORM MODE WOULD
HAVE 25*(3/4) OR 18 MP'S)

MODE      RATIO    MODE     RATIO
---------------------------------------
DEFN      0        RIVER    1/2
REOR      1/4      FIRE     1/2
SUPORT    1/4      NORM     3/4
ATTCK     1/2      TRANS    1

MODE CHANGE
-----------

THE CHANGE MODES, A UNIT MUST EXPEND MP'S BASED ON ITS EFFICIENCY AND THE
NUMBER OF SIGHTING ENEMY UNITS (SEU)

EFFICIENCY         COST
---------------------------------
6-7                SEU/2
3-5                SEU + 1
0-3                SEU * 2 + 1

WHEN CHANGING MODES, THE * INDICATES THEY THE UNIT CAN'T CHANGE TO THAT
MODE.

NEW MOVEMENT ALLOWANCE:
(MAX MP'S - CHANGE COST)*(NEW MODE RATIO)*(NUMBER MP'S LEFT / NUMBER OF
MP'S AT START)

IN OTHER WORDS (HA!) THE MORE ENEMIES AROUND, THE HARDER IT IS TO
DO ANYTHING

MODES
-----

DEFN:
(DEFENSE)  ALLOWS A UNIT TO JUST DEFEND ITSELF 

SUPPRT:
(SUPPORT) ALLOWS A UNIT TO SUPPORT THE DEFENSE/OFFENSE OF A
UNIT FROM THE SAME DIVISION

NORMAL:
OBVIOUS (I HOPE)

TRANS:
(TRANSPORT) INDICATES THAT A UNIT IS USING A ROAD AND IS
VULNERABLE TO COMBAT

RIVER:
ALLOWS A UNIT TO CROSS A RIVER

ATTCK:
(ATTACK)  GIVES INCREASED COMBAT ABILITY, BUT LOSES WILL INCREASE

FIRE:
ALLOWS ANY UNIT WITH AN ARTILLERY
RANGE ABOVE 0 TO FIRE

REOR:
(REORGANIZE) INDICATES THAT A 
UNIT IS REFITTING AND IS 
INCREASING ITS STRENGTH AND
EFFICIENCY)

TERRAIN

RIVER      4        5           0

AIRFIELDS  AND  NUMBERED  HEXES  ARE  TREATED AS OPEN FOR MOVEMENT AND
COMBAT PURPOSES

MOVEMENT IN TRANS MODE COSTS 1MP/HEX AIRCV PAYS 1MP/HEX IN ANY TERRAIN

+2 MP'S TO ENTER SMOKE HEX

+1 MP (+2 IF IN TRANS) FOR EACH SEU

+1 MP IF IN TRANS MODE AND ENEMY HAS AIR SUPPERIORITY

ORDER PHASE -----------

WHEN MOVING A UNIT, ONE CAN GIVE AND ORDER BY HITTING "C"

1-C: 
WILL MOVE UNIT TO  APPROPRIATE  POINT  USING  ROAD  NET  (PRESENCE  OF
ENEMIES NEGATES THIS ORDER)

D: 
CAUSES UNITS IN NORM AND FIRE MODE TO MOVE AND FIRE DURING THE ENEMIES
MOVING PHASE

X: 
WILL  CAUSE  THE INIT TO EXIT THE MAP WITH A 25% CHANCE OF COMING BACK
AS A REINFORCEMENT  AT  THE  SAME  SPOT  1-3  TURNS  LATER,  OR  BEING
ELIMINATED

V: 
WILL  CAUSE  THE  UNIT  TO  CAPTURE  ANY  VILLAGES  WITHIN 5 HEXES AND
CONTINUE (ENEMIES PRESENT NEGATE THIS ORDER)

F: 
WILL CAUSE THE UNIT TO FIRE AT THE BEST TARGET WITHIN RANGE

R: 
WILL CAUSE THE UNIT TO RUN UNTIL OUT OF SIGHTING RANGE WHERE  IT  WILL
CHANGE TO REOR MODE IF POSSIBLE

S: 
WILL  CALL  IN  FIRE FROM ARTILLERY AND AIRSTRIKES WITHIN RANGE ON ALL
ENEMY UNITS WITHIN 3 HEXES OF THE MOVING UNIT

M: 
WILL CAUSE THE UNIT TO ADVANCE AND FIRE ON ENEMY UNITS

N: 
WILL CAUSE THE UNIT TO ADVANCE AND ATTACK ENEMY UNITS

IF THE ORDER CAN NOT BE CARRIED OUT, THE ANNOYING BEEP WILL SOUND  AND
CONTROL  WILL  BE  PASSED  BACK  TO THE PLAYER (NO EFFECT WILL BE TAKE
AGAINST THE UNIT)

HIDDEN MOVEMENT
---------------

ANY UNIT MAY BE HIDDEN DURING ITS MOVEMENT PHASE PROVIDED THAT: 

IT IS NOT STACKED
NOT ADJACENT TO A UNIT
NOT IN TRANS MODE
NOT SIGHTED BY AN ENEMY UNIT

COMMAND TO HIDE: 
CTRL-H (OR <-)

IF A HIDDEN UNIT ENTERS TRANS MODE OR FIRES, IT WILL BE "UNHIDDEN"

SIGHTING
--------

A HIDDEN UNIT THAT IS SIGHTED BY AND ENEMY UNIT OR MOVES  ADJACENT  TO
AND  ENEMY  HIDDEN  UNIT WILL BECOME EXPOSED THE DISTANCE UPON WHICH A
HIDDEN UNIT BECOMES SIGHTED DEPENDS ON: 

TERRAIN
NIGHT (MAXIMUM OF 2 HEXES)
IN SMOKE
IF IT IS IN DEFN (1 HEX) OR REOR (2) MODE

WHEN A UNIT IS SIGHTED, THE SPEAKER MAKE A BEEP

DELAYED MOVE
------------

A UNIT GIVEN A DELAYED MOVE IN THE ORDER PHASE OF ITS  TURN  MAY  MOVE
DURING  THE  ENEMIES TURN.  UNITS IN FIRE MODE WILL ATTEMPT TO FIRE AT
OTHERS AND UNITS IN NORM MODE WILL ATTACK.  THE  PROBABILITY  THAT  AN
ENEMY  UNIT WILL ACTIVATE AN ENEMY UNIT IN DELAYED MOVE DEPENDS IN THE
NUMBER OF DELAYED UNITS WITHIN 5 HEXES. 

L KEY
-----

WHEN MOVING UNITS, IF YOU CHOOSE TO MOVE A UNIT AND THEN HAVE NOT DONE
ANYTHING WITH IT, YOU CAN HIT "L" AND CYCLE AROUND TO  THE  NEXT  UNIT
WHILE COMING AROUND TO THE OTHER ONE LATER. 

MOVEMENT RESTRICTIONS
---------------------

NO MORE THEN 2 UNITS IN A HEX

NO UNIT MAY ENTER A UNIT OCCUPIED BY A HIDDEN UNIT

AIRCV'S  CAN NOT ENTER RUSSIAN CONTROLLED VILLAGES, TOWNS, OR AIRFIELD
HEXES

UNITS IN TRANS MODE MAY ONLY TRAVEL IN ROADS,  OPEN  TERRAIN,  OR  NON
ENEMY CONTROLLED VILLAGES, TOWNS, AND AIRFIELDS

UNITS IN DEFN MODE MAY NOT MOVE
