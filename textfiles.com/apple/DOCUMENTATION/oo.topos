This documentation contains the Operators Manual, Letter from the President of
the Space Ecological Society, and the Auto Flight Log.

OPERATORS MANUAL
----------------

  This operator manual contains important information regarding operation of 
the Intergalactic star fleet Astro Mega Class series of intermediate-range 
spacecraft.
  In order to obtain maximum usage of this spacecraft, we suggest all craft 
pilots familiarize themselves with the contents of this booklet and follow
the recommendations outlined.
  Astro Mega Class vehicles should be operated only by a trained, licensed
pilot.  This book is NOT meant to be used as space flight instruction.
  The Astro Mega Class meets or exceeds all applicable Intergalactic Federation
star fleet safety standards.  Effectivenessof these safety features can best
be continued through regular craft inspection and maintenance.  Proper repair
of this craft should be done only by a qualified Astro Development technician.
Always specify Astro Development parts for maximum performance and economy.

			Observe all flight regulations.
			     Make safety a habit!


Main Computer
-------------

  Using advanced technology, the Astro Mega Class craft is virtually self-
operational.  The on-board computer system provides all engine control,
navigational maneuvers, and systems monitoring necessary for intermediate-
range space travel.
  The Main Computer is entirely voice-activated.  The system receives audio
input only at the Main Computer Console, located behind the bridge on the 
port side.  However, the system provides audio output anywhere on-board.

  COMPUTER OPERATION-When the vehicle is in total shutdown, the computer 
must be re-activated for flight.  Audio input of the MISSION CODE is required 
to begin computer functions.  Audio input of the word "STATUS" initiates a 
computer check of all on-board systems.  Audio output will notify the pilot
of malfunctions, safety hazards, or any other disorder that owuld imperile
space travel.  Intergalactic Federation safety codes requier that ALL SYSTEMS
MUST BE IN PROPER OPERATING CONDITION IN FOR THIS CRAFT TO ENTER FLIGHT.
Audio output will notify the pilot of lift-off condition with the ALL SYSTEMS
CHECK response.
  The Main Computer performs other functions besides standard ship operation.
For example, with audio input of the word "VALUE," it will appraise any item
and supply currency exchange rates for nearby star systems.


Bridge Controls
---------------

  Bridge controls are automatically activated and monitored by the Main 
Computer.  Override Systems will function only during an emergency landing
situation.


Primary Components
------------------

1) ACCELEROMETER: an instrument that measures the rate of acceleration changes.
Located on the Bridge control panel by the co-pilot chair.

2) AIRLOCK: a chamber that adjusts air pressure for passage from on-board to 
extravehicular environment and vice versa.  Located mid-ship on the port side.

3) APOGEE KICK MOTOR: a rocket motor that fires at the apogee of an oval 
transfer to launch the craft into a circular geostationary orbit.  Located 
in the Port Engine Room.

4) AVIONICS: the electronics system and instruments that monitor and control
ship functions in flight.  Located on bridge.

5) COMPUTER CARD UNIT: storage for individual Universal Activan Data Cards to
control varisou computer information functions.  The cards can easily be 
exchanged and updated to the most recent banks.  Located in the Main Computer
on the port side before entering the Bridge.

6) CRYON PURIFIER: a filter that intnesifiescryon particles emitted by the 
power cylinder.  Located in the Port Engine Room.

7) ENERGY CONVERTER: an "Xchanger" energy converter that uses zellium-based
internal coils to convert various forms of energy created by the power 
cylinder into usable light drive energy.  Located in the Port Engine Room.

8) EXTRAVEHICULAR HELMET: a self-sealing headgear used in conjunction with
Extravehicular Space Suit and Thermo Gloves for extravehicular activity in 
hostile or no-environment situations.  Contains light activated face shield a
and portable oxygen recirculator.

9) EXTRAVEHICULAR SPACE SUIT: a self-sealing and regulation thermo-spacesuit
used in conjunction with Extravehicular Helmet and Thermo Gloves for hostile
and no-environment extravehicular activity.

10) GYRO-MATIC LEVELER: a system that stablizes the spacecraft during flight.
Controls stability along linear (roll), planer (pitch) and vector (yaw) axes.
Located in the Bridge control panel.

11) HYDRO-PARTICULATOR: a life-support component that purifies and recycles 
condensation from internal atmosphere of the craft into the water system.
Located in the Life-Support Center.

12) KRYLLIAN CHIP: a vital component of the transmission beacon.  Located on
the Bridge.

13) LIGHT-ROD: a short-term source of light that absorbs energy from available
light when not in use.  Required in the Life-Support Center during flight and
removable for emergencies.

14) MAIN SHIELD UNIT: a protable protective unit that, when installed, creates
a "cushioning" shield around the spacecraft to prevent damage from micro-
meteoroids and other space debris.  Installs on the garon ray transfer housing
in the Starboard Engine Room.

15) NAVCHIP: a computer component that contains current interstellar causeway
information and navigational beacon.  It controls firing of the external
retro-rockets during flight.  Located in the Bridge control panel.

16) OXYGEN RECIRCULATOR: a vital component of the Life-Support Center that 
removes condensation and harmful gases from the internal atmosphere of the
ship.  Whater particles are channeled into the hydro-particulator and gasses
are jettisoned into open spaces.  Located mid-ship on the starboard side.

17) THERMO GLOVES: self-sealing hand protection used in conjunction with
Extravehicular Helmet and Extravehicular Space Suit for hostile and no-
environment extravehicular activity.

18) TACHYON POWER CYLINDER: a power intensifier that creates a radioactive
zone around the engine core using intense alpha-coronic waves.  Supplies 
limitless engine power and life support capabilities.  Located in the Port
Engine Room.


CARGO BAY
---------

  The Cargo Bay in located in the center of the spacecraft and measures
8 x 7 x 7 fleegs.  The entrance to this ares of the ship is airlocked since 
the CARGO BAY doors must sometimes be opened during flight.  The Cargo Bay 
is designed to accomodate most cargo and payload support equipment (i.e.-
for specialized atmospheric control).  The size and weight of all cargo
support equipment must be included with data that is fed into the Main
Computer to determine exact payload limit.


PAYLOADS
--------

  The Mega Class spacecraft is capable of carrying two types of payload:

1) ATTACHED PAYLOAD: remains in the cargo bay during flight and unloaded
only at fixed landing destinations.

2) FREE-FLYING PAYLOAD: is deposited in space throught the Cargo Bay airlock
during flight.  Free-flying payload requires proper orientation training and
instruction.  It is best to check the payload manufacturer for recommended 
disembark information.


EMERGENCY LANDING
-----------------

  The Main Computer operates all emergency landing functions.  However,
in an emergency landing situation, the pilot can engage the Main Computer 
auto-pilot override system.  This enables the pilot to combine Main Computer
scanning data with optic visualizer input.

J. Castor Nebulus
  President

              Date: 51.7.290
              Time: 06.13.00
     Communication: Argo HQ, President
                To: Flight Commander Argo Base
      Mission Code: TSE957X
          Priority: Urgent--red level
            Depart: White Bay 2. Maximum speed, immediate upon reciept of
                    this directive.
       Destination: Observation Labport 5V, Station 5 Omega Sector 12
         Objective: Trasnport protective compound to Labport
        Background: Outside the boundaries of star system 69 Omega is
                    Observation Labport 5V.  Subject of this Labport is
                    star 69B and surrounding planets.  The third planet of
                    of this system (Earth) is inhabited.  Earth has no 
                    knowledge of or contact with the numerous members of the
                    Intergalactic Society.  An interstellar transport 
                    carrying power transfusion waste collided with a meteor
                    and its toxic contents have scattered into open space.
                    These contents are being drawn toward star 69B (Sol) and
                    Earth is in the path.  The transfusion waste is so deadly
                    that all lifeforms on Earth could be destroyed on contact.
                    Earth is not aware of the problem and does not have the
                    technology to avert a disaster.  A protective compound
                    has been synthesized by SES scientists.  With seeds of
                    this compound, Labport 5V can produce the chemical and
                    secretly introduce it into Earth's atmosphere.  It is
                    IMPERATIVE that no attempt be made to communicate directly
                    with lifeforms on Earth.  Earth is within a restricted 
                    travel zone.  Sudden contact with other lifeforms could
                    cause irreparable damage to Earth's development.
          Comments: The SES has great hopes for the inhabitants of Earth.
                    It is of the utmost importance that we do whatever possible
                    to avert this disaster.

		    Good Luck,

                    J. Castor Nebulus
                    PRESIDENT
