Your destiny unfolds.....

     2187, the year your legacy began. Dondra, world of the Elders...a place of
harmony and tranquility. The masses were content and at peace with each other.
War was virtually nonexistent and the wisdom of the Elders had been undisputed
for over 100 years.

Meanwhile, in another dimension...

     The universe is filled with pestilence, crime and disease. Colnar is the
being who rules all evil, controlling everyone and everything. He is planning
time travel to another state of being, a new universe which is prevalent with
happiness, so that he may once again spread his evil ways.

Time passes.....

     2199, Colnar begins the domination of his new universe.  The Elders
anticipate the need of foreign aid and form a pact with the Tellasien race of
Halcar, a neighboring planet.  "The Tellasien race must defend the Elders
againist any evil forces.  If life is taken for naught... then they must
avenge."

     Colnar has reached Dondra and has initiated his devious plan to abolish
this nucleus of organization.  After taking over the minds and bodies of a
neighboring town, Colnar's now evil warriors brutally attack and slay all of
the Elders.  The last remaining wiseman, using telepathy, summon their
defenders just before being killed...


PLAYER INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------

Apple // Version:

          Ram Needed:

          1287k Needed, Joytick (optional)

          Put in the boot disk "Side 1" in drive one and turn on the computer.


BEGINNING ( FIRST TIME PLAYER NOTES )
-------------------------------------

In your travels on Ardnod you will be generating experience based upon how
you perform in this world.  You will also gain items that can be used in future
Questmaster modules.  Therefore, when you boot this program for the first time
you will be asked to supply a name to assign to your first character.  Even
though you may be terminated many times during the game play, you will always
be re-incarnated after being brought back to the boot disk.


EXPERIENCE
----------

You will be given experience during your travels based upon:

     Total  Number of saves
            Number of times terminated
            Number of objects gained
            Elapsed time

These results will be used to calulate you total experience gained. To view
your experience at any time during game play type: EXP or EXPERIENCE.


BASIC COMMAND ENTRY
-------------------

In this program there are many different ways to enter commands. You may use
the standard two word method, ie: GO NORTH [RETURN], or you may type CONTROL-N,
or you may press the joystick forward and press button (0) to move, or you can
simply press N [RETURN]. When entering a command you will usually need an
ACTION word and an OBJECT word. Some standard commands might be: LOOK DOOR,
READ SIGN, TAKE KEY, OPEN DOOR. To enter and execute your commands you will be
using something called a "parser", ie: the link between your nimble fingers and
the computer of your choice. When typing in a command the prompt or starting
point is indicated on the bottom of the screen as: ENTRY> or >. After
familiarizing yourself with the program for a while using some of the basic
commands above, try some of the following methods of getting around in Ardnod.


ADVANCED COMMAND ENTRY
----------------------

If you enjoy being more verbose in your description of actions and objects this
parser will accommodate you. For instance, the basic commands from the previous
paragraph could have been entered: READ THE SIGN ON THE DOOR, TAKE THE KEY OFF
OF THE FLOOR, OPEN THE DOOR, FACTUS ARE SNOBS. You may also use multiple
actions and multiple objects in the same sentence.  If, for instance, you knew
what you wanted to do in a particular room you could: GET THE KEY AND THE
WRENCH THEN OPEN THE NORTH DOOR. This would immediately take the key and the
wrench from the floor and open the north door in that order.

Your capabilities are not limiited to what is on the screen at the present
time. You may also move between screens, look at objects, and do just about
anything in that same sentence, ie: OPEN THE DOOR THEN GO NORTH AND HAVE A LOOK
AT THE OLD MURAL. When getting or dropping items you may also use commas: TAKE
GEM, VIAL, SACK.


MULTIPLE COMMAND ENTRY
----------------------

One of the special text handling capabilities is the multiple command entry.
You may type in a lengthy number of commands one after the other with a period
between each: TAKE THE GEM, VIAL, AND ROPE. GO NORTH. GO UP. GIVE THE GEM TO
THE MAN. GO DOWN. GO SOUTH. GO WEST.

Each of the commands will be executed in the order received until they are
completed. Remember, if something was entered incorrectly, them the chances are
the commands that follow will not properly execute.


TRAVELLING ON ARDNOD
--------------------

Remember that you are always looking out the eyes of Terna, the last of the
Tellasien race. We have tried to make it as easy as possible to understand your
position at each location, while trying to maintain a proper perception of your
facing. When you move to a location the description shown will give you a good
understanding of your surroundings. In many cases it is possible to look in
more than one direction. To accomplish this you may: LOOK SOUTH.

In your travels of Ardnod you will encounter many strange beings which will in
some way have to be dealt with. Sometimes you might have to give them something
or perform some action, to make them more friendly. You will also find that
there are many "timed" events which keep you on your toes and prevent stagnant
game play.


    Keyboard Movement:

        Earlier we discussed basic and advanced commands which game you an
        understanding of the parser. We said that you can GO NORTH to move to
        the next location in a northerly direction. You may GO in any direction
        you can think of: NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, EAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, UP,
        NORTHEAST, and DOWN. You can even GO AROUND or GO BEHIND many things
        (hint, hint). However, it is not necessary to type GO every time: N, S,
        W, E, NW, NW, SE, SW, U, and D [RETURN] will get you around very
        quickly. After you have mastered these movement commands, try the ones
        below.

  CONTROL - Movement commands ( See Help Screen )


JOYSTICK MOVEMENT
-----------------

You are slumped over that machine, it is time to pack in a heavy hacking
section and you couldn't type another move... Don't fuckin' worry! Pick up the
joystick which is hiding under all of the ECC releases and type CONTROL-J. This
command will toggle your joystick on or off. When you press the joystick in any
direction you will see the corresponding movement command at the ENTRY> prompt.
When you press button (0) it will then move in that direction. When you want to
go UP or DOWN you will need to hold down the botton (1) and move the joystick
forward and back to make your selection. When you want to type something into
the computer, let the joystick self center ( there is no need to disable the
joystick to type in commands ).


SPECIAL FUNCTIONS
-----------------

HELP:                    This screen may be accessed to help you remember some
                         of the features in Questmaster

EXPERIENCE (EXP):        Displays your present Questmaster stats as well as the
                         elapsed time.

TIME (CONTROL-T):        Will display your elapsed time since you started your
                         quest. This time will be a factor in calculating your
                         experience.

CONTROL-J:               Toggles joystick function on and off; it can be used
                         at any time for immediate movement. ( make sure that
                         you have your joystick adjusted properly.)

CONTROL-R:               This will purge your charcter from the disk and make
                         you RESTART FROM THE BEGINNING.


SAVING AND LOADING POSTIONS
---------------------------

This feature is provided so that you can return to locations previously saved
after you quit or have been terminated ( by one of the strange or evil beings
you might encounter on Ardnod. ) There is a catch, however; the number of times
that you can save a game is counted and will negatively affect your experience.
We hope this will give your character an air performance, rewarding the more
cautious and penalizing the frivolous adventurer.

At ALMOST any time during play you are permitted to restore as well as to save
your present stats to the saved game disk. To do this simply LOAD GAME and SAVE
GAME.

    Apple // Version:

        The screen will clear and you will be instructed to insert your saved
        game disk and press [RETURN]. If you have a second disk drive press D
        and you will see the disk drive indicator change on the screen. A
        second drive is convenient because your disk swapping will be reduced
        to a minimun. After putting in the appropriate disk and pressing
        [RETURN] a slect game menu will appear. If using the LOAD command
        , only previously saved games will be indicated. If using SAVE you may
        type a new letter not indicated or you may elect to write over an old 
        one. Any letter from A to Z is available in SAVE mode.


BASIC COMMANDS
--------------

Some basic commands to get you started are: Use, Open, Take (all), Drop (all),
Say, Look, Kick, Read, Go. This is only to help the beginner. There are
hundreds of words this program will recongnize and execute, so do not hesitate
to try anything. There are also some command substitutions that will make your
travels a little easier. (L) is the same thing as typing in LOOK, (I) is the
same as INVENTORY and all of the directions can be abbreviated. When typing in
commands these abbreviations will also work in full sentence structure, ie:
LOOK AT THE SOUTH DOOR THEN OPEN THE SOUTH DOOR. GET THE KEY THEN KICK THE KEY
SOUTH. GO SOUTH ---- same as ---- L S DOOR. OPEN S DOOR. GET KEY. KICK KEY S. S


YOUR QUEST ON ARDNOD
--------------------

This futuristic land has mountains, deserts, streams, fields, and cities. You
will find that aspects of this world are different from any other you have
known.

To win you must set forth in this strange and forbidden land to find the
Crystal Prism of Heheutotol and return to the starting location. Upon return,
you will gain new power which can be used in future Quests!


SOME FUCKIN' HINTS
------------------

Stuck in the first room? Try these fuckin' hints:

        Did you take the key?

                Yes     -it dropped to the ground.
                No      -try taking it.

        Did you decipher the code on the north door?

                Yes     -good.
                No      -it is a sliding code, (ie: B=A C=B):
                        XQFBL ZF UIFTF XPSET
                        SPEAK YE THESE WORDS

                Which means: SAY DEATH TO COLNAR
                This will make a keyhole appear in the north door.

        To get the key you must:

                OPEN THE SOUTH DOOR
                KICK THE KEY SOUTH ( The key steams up the south room. )
                GO SOUTH
                TAKE THE KEY
                GO NORTH

        To open the north door:

                After you insert the key into the keyhole the door will open.
                GO NORTH
                Skeletons will appear and scream "SPEAK MORTL". Simply try what
                has worked before:
                SAY DEATH TO CLONAR

        The skeletons give you items helpful in your quest on Ardnod.

        To get past the skeletons in one set of instructions when starting from
        the first screen:

                TAKE KEY. OPEN S DOOR. KICK KEY S. S. GET KEY. N. SAY DEATH TO
                COLNAR. INSERT KEY INTO KEYHOLE. N. SAY DEATH TO COLNAR. N.
