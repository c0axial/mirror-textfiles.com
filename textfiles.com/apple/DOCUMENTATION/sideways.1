                            WHAT YOU NEED
                            -------------
TO  RUN SIDEWAYS YOU WILL NEED AN APPLE ][+,e,c COMPUTER WITH AT LEAST
48K, AT LEAST  ONE  DISK  DRIVE,  A  PRINTER  INTERFACE  CARD,  AND  A
DOT-MATRIX  PRINTER  WITH  DOT-ADDRESSABLE  GRAPHICS CAPABILITY. FOR A
LIST OF CURRENTLY SUPPORTED PRINTERS AND PRINTER INTERFACE CARDS,  SEE
THE SECTION ENTITLED 'INSTALLATION GUIDE'. 

                              WHAT'S ON YOUR DISK
                              -------------------

YOUR SIDEWAYS DISK CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING FILES:

SIDEWAYS.........THIS IS THE SIDEWAYS PROGRAM

INSTALL..........THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS YOU TO SET-UP SIDEWAYS FOR YOUR
                 HARDWARE CONFIGURATION (PRINTER MODEL,INTERFACE
                 CARD,SLOT NUMBER)

SAMPLE.PRF.......THIS IS A SAMPLE SPREADSHEET, WHICH CAN BE USED
                 IMMEDIATELY TO DEMO SIDEWAYS PRINTING.


                            INSTALLING THE PROGRAM
                            ----------------------

BEFORE  YOU CAN USE THE SIDEWAYS PROGRAM, YOU MUST TELL IT THE TYPE OF
PRINTER YOU HAVE, THE TYPE OF INTERFACE CARD YOU HAVE, IN  WHICH  SLOT
THE  INTERFACE  CARD  IS LOCATED, AND THE NUMBER OF DATA BITS PER BYTE
THAT YOUR PRINTER WILL ACCEPT (NORMALLY 8). 


1.  PUT YOUR SIDEWAYS DISK IN DRIVE 1 AND TURN ON THE COMPUTER. 

2.  WHEN THE  SCREEN  TITLE  APPEARS,  TYPE  THE  CHARACTER  "I"  (FOR
INSTALL). BE SURE TO DO THIS BEFORE THE MAIN SIDEWAYS MENU APPEARS. 

3.   THE  "INSTALL"  PROGRAM  WILL  TELL YOU HOW SIDEWAYS IS CURRENTLY
INSTALLED, AND WILL PRESENT A  MENU  FOR  CHANGING  THE  INSTALLATION.
SELECT  WHICHEVER  ITEMS NEED TO BE ALTERED; THE PROGRAM WILL LEAD YOU
THROUGH THE VARIOUS OPTIONS IN A SERIES OF MENUS. 

4.  WHEN YOU HAVE MADE  ALL  THE  NECESSARY  CHANGES,  USE  THE  "TEST
INTERFACE"  OPTION  TO DO A PRELIMINARY CHECK OF THE SYSTEM. THIS WILL
SEND A LINE OF TEXT CONTINUOUSLY,  INSURING  THAT  YOUR  SELECTION  OF
PRINTER INTERFACE CARD AND AND SLOT NUMBER WERE CORRECT. 

5.   NOW  USE THE "EXIT" OPTION TO LEAVE THE INSTALL PROGRAM AND START
THE NEWLY INSTALLED SIDEWAYS PROGRAM. 

6.  CHECK OUT THE SYSTEM BY PRINTING THE SAMPLE SPREADSHEET THAT WE'VE
INCLUDED ON YOUR SIDEWAYS DISK WHEN THE SIDEWAYS SCREEN COMES UP, TYPE
IN "SAMPLE.PRF", FOLLOWED BY <RETURN>. 

IF YOU BUY A NEW PRINTER, OR OTHERWISE CHANGE YOUR CONFIGURATION, MAKE
SURE YOU KEEP SIDEWAYS ABREAST OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS  BY  REPEATING  THE
ABOVE PROCEDURE. 

REFER  TO THE SECTION ENTITLED "INSTALLATION GUIDE" FOR INFORMATION ON
PARTICULAR PRINTERS AND  INTERFACE  CARDS,  AND  HOW  THEY  SHOULD  BE
INSTALLED. 


                            STARTING UP THE PROGRAM
                            -----------------------

PUT  YOUR  SIDEWAYS DISK IN DRIVE 1 AND TURN ON YOUR COMPUTER FIRST, A
TITLE SCREEN WILL APPEAR,  FOLLOWED,  AFTER  A  FEW  SECONDS,  BY  THE
SIDEWAYS MENU. 

WHAT  YOU  SEE  ARE  ALL  THE  CURRENT  SETTINGS OF THE FORMATTING AND
PRINTER OPTIONS. YOU MAY ALTER ANY OF  THESE  OPTIONS,  SAVE  THE  NEW
SETTING  TO  DISK,  SELECT  A FILE FOR SIDEWAYS PRINTING, OR EXIT TO A
DIFFERENT PROGRAM. 

THE CURSOR ALWAYS POINTS TO A HIGHLIGHTED FIELD; INITIALLY  IT  POINTS
TO  THE  PRINT  FIELD. USE CTRL-E AND CTRL-X TO MOVE THE CURSOR AROUND
THE SCREEN TO DIFFERNT FIELDS  (ON  AN  APPLE  IIe  USE  UP-ARROW  AND
DOWN-ARROW).  IF  YOU WOULD LIKE TO ALTER THE VALUE OF A FIELD, SIMPLY
POSITION THE CURSOR TO THAT FIELD AND RE-ENTER IT. 

FOR MOST OF THE FIELDS, YOU WOULD  SIMPLY  ENTER  THE  NEW  VALUE  AND
TERMINATE  YOUR  ENTRY WITH <RETURN>, OR CTRL-E OR CTRL-X. YOU CAN USE
LEFT-ARROW OR DELETE TO DELETE THE LAST CHARACTER YOU TYPED, OR  <ESC>
TO  DELETE  YOUR ENTIRE ENTRY.  IF YOUR ENTRY IS INVALID, YOU WILL GET
AN ERROR MESSAGE, AND THE FIELD YOU JUST ENTERED WILL REVERT ITSELF TO
ITS PREVIOUS VALUE. 

THE REST OF THE FIELDS ARE  "TOGGLE"  FIELDS:  YOU  CAN  CHANGE  THEIR
CONTENTS  SIMPLY  BY  STRIKING ANY ALPHANUMERIC KEY (SUCH AS THE SPACE
BAR). THESE FIELDS INCLUDE HORIZONTAL FORM SIZE, CHARACTER  FONT,  AND
DOUBLE STRIKE. 

                           SELECTING A FILE TO PRINT
                           -------------------------

TO  PRINT A FILE, POSITION THE CURSOR TO THE PRINT FILE FIELD AND TYPE
IN THE NAME OF THE FILE  YOU  WANT  TO  PRINT,  TERMINATE  BY  HITTING
<RETURN>. ENTER THE FILE NAME IN NORMAL DOS FORMAT: 

                            filename[,Sn][,Dn][,Vn]


(S,D, AND V ARE SLOT, DRIVE, AND VOLUME. AS INDICATED BY THE BRACKETS,
THE ARE OPTIONAL PARAMETERS,)

ONCE PRINTING HAS BEGUN, THE FOLLOWING IS DISPLAYED: 

                          STRIKE "P" TO STOP PRINTING


IF  YOU  DO  STRIKE "P", THE PRINTER WILL STOP PRINTING AT THE CURRENT
LINE AND DO A FORM FEED. 

AFTER YOUR FILE HAS BEEN PRINTED, YOU MAY ONCE AGAIN ALTER THE  OPTION
SETTINGS,  ENTER  A  NEW  FILE  NAME  FOR  PRINTING OR EXIT TO ANOTHER
PROGRAM. 

SLOT, DRIVE, VOLUME: 

IF YOU DON'T SPECIFY A SLOT OR DRIVE NUMBER,  SIDEWAYS  WILL  USE  THE
DEFAUTL  SLOT  AND DRIVE. INITIALLY, THE DEFAULT IS THE SLOT AND DRIVE
FROM WHICH SIDEWAYS WAS BOOTED (NORMALLY SLOT 6,  DRIVE  1).  WHENEVER
YOU  SPECIFY  A  SLOT  OR  DRIVE  WITH  A FILENAME, IT BECOMES THE NEW
DEAFULT. 

IF YOU DON'T SPECIFY A FILENAME, BUT  TYPE  IN  A  SLOT  AND/OR  DRIVE
NUMBER,  FOLLOWED  BY  <RETURN>, SIDEWAYS WILL CHANGE THE DEFAULT SLOT
AND DRIVE WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO PRINT ANYTHING. YOU MUST  REMEMBER  TO
PRECEDE  THE DRIVE OR SLOT NUMBER WITH A COMMA. FOR EXAMPLE, TO CHANGE
THE DEFAULT DRIVE TO DRIVE 2, TYPE IN: 

                                 ,D2 <RETURN>


IF YOU SPECIFY A VOLUME NUMBER, SIDEWAYS WILL MATCH THIS NUMBER TO THE
VOLUME NUMBER ON THE DISK, AND GIVE YOU AN ERROR ON A MISMATCH. 


WILDCARDS: 

IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE FILE YOU WANT TO PRINT, YOU  CAN
EXAMINE  THE  FILENAMES  ON  YOUR  DISK  BY  USING  A "WILCARD" IN THE
FILENAME YOU ENTER. THE EQUAL (=) SIGN IS  THE  WILDCARD  CHARACTER-IT
STANDS FOR ANY SEQUENCE OF CHARACTERS IN THE CORRESPONDING POSITION OF
THE  FILENAME. FOR INSTANCE, P=W WOULD STAND FOR ANY FILENAME STARTING
WITH P AND ENDING  WITH  W.  AFTER  ENTERING  THE  FILENAME  WITH  THE
WILDCARD  IN  IT, DON'T TYPE <RETURN>, BUT USE RIGHT-ARROW TO DISPLAY,
ONE-BY-ONE, ALL TEXT FILES MATCHING YOUR ENTRY. WHEN THE FILE THAT YOU
WANT APPEARS, HIT <RETURN> TO PRINT IT. 

HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WILDCARDS: 

         = ALL FILES ON DEFAULT DRIVE
         =,D2 ALL FILES ON DRIVE 2
         =ING ALL FILES ENDING IN ING


FILENAME RULES: 


YOUR FILE MST BE ON A DOS 3.3 DISK. DOS ASSIGNS  EVERY  FILE  ON  YOUR
DISK A "FILE TYPE", WHICH GENERALLY DESCRIBES THE FORMAT OR PURPOSE OF
THE  FILE. THE "TEXT" FILE TYPE INDICATES A FILE COMPOSED OF PRINTABLE
CHARACTERS-THIS IS THE TYPE OF FILE SIDEWAYS EXPECTS, AND IF YOU ENTER
A FILE OF A DIFFERENT TYPE, SIDEWAYS WILL NOT RECOGNIZE IT. TEXT FILES
ARE INDICATED BY THE "T" CODE NEXT TO THE FILE NAME WHEN  YOU  CATALOG
YOUR DISK. 

YOU  SHOULD  NOT  USE  FILE NAMES WITH EMBEDDED CONTROL CHARACTERS, OR
WITH FLASHING OR INVERSE CHARACTERS. 

WHILE SIDEWAYS WILL HANDLE LOWER-CASE CHARACTERS IN A FILENAME, IT  IS
GOOD  PRACTICE  TO AVOID USING THEM. SIDEWAYS WILL DISREGARD CASE WHEN
YOU USE RIGHT-ARROW TO SEARCH FOR A FILE; HOWEVER, WHEN YOU  TERMINATE
YOUR  FILENAME ENTRY WITH <RETURN>, ALL THE CHARACTERS OF THE FILENAME
MUST BE IN THE CORRECT CASE FOR THE FILE TO BE FOUND. 

WHEN YOU USE RIGHT-ARROW TO SEARCH FOR A MATCHING FILENAME, THE  EQUAL
SIGN  (=)  IS  A  WILDCARD; BUT WHEN YOU TERMINATE YOUR FILENAME ENTRY
WITH <RETURN>, THE EQUAL SIGN IS TAKEN LITERALLY. 


                               SIDEWAYS OPTIONS
                               ----------------

SETTING PAPER DIMENSIONS: 

HORIZONTAL FORM FEED REFERS  TO  YOUR  PAPER  WIDTH.  IT  WILL  TOGGLE
BETWEEN 8 INCHES AND 13 INCHES. IF YOU HAVE A NARROW CARRIAGE PRINTER,
YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT SET TO 8 INCHES. 

VERICAL FORM FEED IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PERFORATIONS OF YOUR PRINTER
PAPER. WHENEVER SIDEWAYS IS DONE PRINTING A PAGE, IT FORM FEEDS TO THE
NEXT MULTIPLE OF VERTICAL FORM SIZE. IT IS NORMALLY SET TO 11 INCHES. 

SETTING THE STYLE OF THE PRINTOUT: 

DOUBLE  STRIKE  IS  A TOGGLE FIELD WHICH MAY BE ON OR OFF. IF IT'S ON,
EACH LINE WILL BE PRINTED TWICE, FOR ADDED PRINT DENSITY. 

CHARACTER FONT IS A TOGGLE FIELD WHICH GIVES YOU A CHOICE  OF  VARIOUS
TYPE  SIZES, FROM TINY TO EXTRA LARGE. ON THE RIGHT OF THE SCREEN, THE
DIMENSIONS OF THE "DOT-MATRIX" - THE  VERTICAL  AND  HORIZONTAL  PRINT
DOTS  THAT ARE USED TO MAKE UP EACH CHARACTER IN THE SELECTED FONT ARE
SHOWN. 

CHARACTER  SPACING  IS  THE  DISTANCE  BETWEEN  SUCCESSIVE   CHARACTER
COLUMNS, MEASURED IN TERMS OF THE VERTICAL DOT DENSITY OF THE PRINTER.
YOU  CAN  CROWD  CHARACTERS  TOGETHER, OR SPREAD THEM APART, BY MAKING
THIS NUMBER SMALLER OR LARGER-THE RESULTING NUMBER OF  CHARACTERS  PER
INCH IS DISPLAYED AT THE RIGHT. 

LINE  SPACING IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE PRINT LINES, KEASURED
IN TERMS OF HORIZONTAL DOT DENSITY OF THE PRINTER. YOU CAN CROWD LINES
TOGETHER OR SPREAD THEM APART BY MANIPULATING THIS VALUE-THE RESULTING
NUMBER OF LINES PER INCH IS DISPLAYED AT THE RIGHT. 

YOU MAY SET A DIFFERENT CHARACTER AND LINE SPACING FOR EACH  CHARACTER
FONT; WHEN YOU CHANGE FONTS, YOU AUTOMATICALLY REVERT TO THE CHARACTER
AND LINE SPACING ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW FONT. 

SETTING THE FORMAT OF THE PAGE: 

LEFT MARGIN CONTROLS THE AMOUNT OF WHITE SPACE BETWEEN TOP-OF-FORM AND
THE LEFTMOST SIDEWAYS PRINT COLUMN

TOP  MARGIN  CONTROLS THE AMOUNT OF WHITE SPACE BETWEEN THE RIGHT EDGE
OF THE PAPER AND THE 1ST SIDEWAYS PRINTED LINE. 

BOTTOM MARGIN CONTROLS THE AMOUNT OF  WHITE  SPACE  BETWEEN  THE  LAST
SIDEWAYS PRINTED LINE AND THE LEFT EDGE OF THE PAPER. 

THE   AMOUNT   OF  SPACE  AVAILABLE  FOR  PRINTING  IS  DETERMINED  BY
SUBTRACTING TOP MARGIN AND BOTTOM MARGIN FROM  HORIZONTAL  FORM  SIZE.
THE  PROGRAM  AUTOMATICALLY COMPUTES THE NUMBER OF LINES THAT WILL FIT
ON EACH PAGE, AND DISPLAYS THIS ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN. 

OTHER OPTION: 

STARTING PAGE ALLOWS YOU TO SKIP OVER THE INITIAL  PAGES  OF  A  PRINT
FILE; IT IS NORMALLY SET TO 1. 


                        SAVING OPTION SETTINGS TO DISK
                        ------------------------------

ONCE  YOU  HAVE  SET UP THE SIDEWAYS OPTIONS AS YOU LIKE THEM, YOU CAN
SAVE THEM TO DISK BY TYPING CTRL-S,  AND  RELOAD  THEM  FROM  DISK  BY
TYPING CTRL-L. 

THE  OPTION  SETTINGS  ARE  SAVED IN A FILE CALLED SWOPTIONS. WHEN YOU
TYPE CTRL-S, THE CURRENT OPTION SETTINGS ARE WRITTEN TO  SWOPTIONS  ON
THE  DEFAULT SLOT AND DRIVE. WHEN YOU TYPE CTRL-L, THE OPTION SETTINGS
ARE LOADED FROM SWOPTIONS ON THE DEFAULT SLOT AND DRIVE. REMEMBER THAT
YOU CAN ALTER THE DEFAULT SLOT AND DRIVE BY ENTERING THEM IN THE PRINT
FILE FIELD WITH A BLANK FILENAME, FOLLOWED BY <RETURN>. 

YOU CAN ALSO SAVE THE OPTION SETTINGS TO THE SIDEWAYS DISK ITSELF.  IF
YOU HAVE DONE SO, THEY WILL BE RELOADED EVE RY TIME YOU BOOT SIDEWAYS,
AND YOU WILLNOT NEED TO USE CTRL-L. 

IF  YOU  HAVE ONE STANDARD SET OF OPTION SETTINGS THAT YOU USE MOST OF
THE TIME, IT MAKES SENSE TO SAVE THEM TO THE  SIDEWAYS  DISK.  IF  YOU
HAVE  DIFFERENT  OPTIONS  SETTINGS USED FOR DIFFERENT PRINT FILES, YOU
MIGHT WANT TO SAVE EACH OF THE VARIOUS SETTINGS TO A  DIFFERENT  DISK,
AND USE CTRL-L TO READ THEM IN.
