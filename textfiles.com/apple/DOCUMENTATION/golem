Golem: a powerful, compact tank, designed for efficient movement
through small, narrow passages and caves.  Golem contains an
unlimited number of shots and 5 missiles.  It also has a powerful
cloaking shield which effectively prevents detection.


The plot:
  
  The moon XG4 had been a peaceful, settled place for decades.  Its small
colony mined the moon for krymite, a red rock that stored
incredible amounts of energy.  The rare compound was prized across the
galaxy and provided the small moon colony with a strong, stable economy.

  Then, in the year 2132, an intergalactic terrorist force took over the small
moon XG4 and threatened to kill every colonist if the Alliance attempted
a rescue.  The terrorists began conducting strange underground experiments
with krymite and Alliance spies suddenly began disappearing from the small
planet.  Rumors soon started of how the once peaceful creatures that lived
beneath the moon's surface were being mutated into destructive monsters. . .

  For months, Alliance officials explored their options and argued vehemently
over which plan of attack would be best.  Finally, they unanimously agreed
on a plan:  If they could safely land one tank by an entrance to the mines,
it could move safely inside the moon without attracting any attention.
The tank would then detonate a bomb in the mines directly below the terrorist
headquarters, which would set of a chain reaction destroying the
terrorists.  The colony was located hundreds of miles away from the terrorist
headquarters and would, therefore, be safe.  It was a perfect plan, or so they
thought - just as the tank was laying the bomb a strange creature appeared
and destroyed the tank, leaving the bomb untouched.  The crew was scattered
and lost in the mines, but the terrorists did not know what had transpired and
the bomb remained in place, waiting to be activated. The plan was then revised:
     INFILTRATE THE MINES,  FIND THE BOMB,  AND DETONATE IT.

  
The game:

  There are over thirty levels in the mines that must be passed before
encountering the bomb.  Each level must be completed before time runs out.
Time starts at 100 for every level and counts down to zero, but the countdown
becomes faster at higher levels.
  The game always starts with four tanks (three in reserve).  When time runs out,
or Golem is exposed to exploding krymite, he will be destroyed.  The mutants
will also destroy Golem.

Each level contains some of the following:
  gray rock - this rock blocks Golem's way and requires 5 shots or one
     missile to be destroyed.
  Krymite - a reddish rock that explodes when shot.  The explosion damages
     everything around it, including gray rocks, blue rocks, spineys, and Golem.
  blue rock - takes 10 shots(2 missiles) before exploding.  One blue rock in
     every level contains a blue key.  Others may contain hearts, missile paks
     or other items.
  blue key - opens the portal, allowing Golem to move to the next level.
  heart - When Golem finds a heart, the number of tanks left will increase
     by one.
  missile pak - Increases the number of missiles by five.
  hourglass - Increases the time left for the level.  Remember, when the time
     reaches zero, Golem will be destroyed.
  flower - A strange but harmless underground mutant that greatly increases
     your score.
  lightning bolt - Alliance spies have not discovered what the lightning
     bolt does.
  crew member - There are five crew members in the mines.  If Golem makes it out
     of the caves alive he will receive 1000 points for every crewman he rescues
     or 10000 points if he rescues them all.
  portal - The portal looks like a gray whirlpool.  It is the entrance to the
     next level, but will not open until the key is found.  The open portal is yellow.
  bomb - A gray orb in the last level, the bomb must be shot with ten missiles
     before it will activate.  Upon bomb activation, the portal will open and the
     whole room will begin to shake and flash.  Get out as quickly as possible!

  The mutants come in various shapes and sizes and pose the greatest threat
to Golem in the mines:
  Spiney - A mutated rock beast that eats rock and most anything else in its
     path.  It also randomly lays gray rocks, constantly changing the layout of the
     level.  If killed, a spiney will vanish and, possibly, reappear later.
  rock flower - Rock flowers grow out of the ground, produce a flower, and then
     die.  The flower has a tough outer shell, and can only be hurt when its
     flower is exposed.  But beware - the flower is highly acidic and will destroy 
     Golem if he drives over it.
  Atom - Another mutated creature that only appears in the higher levels.  The
     atom moves slowly around, occasionally emitting energy bursts.  Golem will
     be destroyed if he is struck by an energy burst or if he shoots the atom.  There
     is no known way to defeat this mutant. . .
  ?? creature  - It resides below the terrorists headquarters in the next to the
     last room.  It possesses the key for that level.  What does it look like?


How to play:

  The joystick moves the tank around the screen.  The orange(main) button fires
regular bullets, while the brown(secondary) button fires missiles.  Note that
the 'Open-Apple' key is equivalent to the orange button and the 'Option' key is
equivalent to the brown button.
  When the tank is destroyed press either joystick button to resume play.
  At any time during the game, press either '?' or '/' to view the help screen
and either 'Q' or 'q' to quit.


Other notes:

  As the game level increases, creatures begin moving faster and more blue rocks
must be destroyed before finding a key.  Also the timer decreases more rapidly.
Therefore, the higher levels require quick thinking and rapid movement.

  Remember that 10 missiles are needed for the last level to destroy the bomb.
When the detonation phase begins and the screen begins to flash, movement
becomes very difficult due to the shaking ground.  Try to shoot the bomb from as
near the portal as possible and then get out fast!

  The top ten scores of the game are automatically saved.  If GolemGS cannot
find the scores file it will automatically create a new one.



Other programs by me(Travelling Faire Software):

  MAZE.LAUNCHER will run adventure game scenarios following certain
guidelines.  Included in the package are two scenarios and some
starter characters.

  The MAKE.CHARACTER program will create new characters for MAZE.LAUNCHER.
It allows the creation of a character from various races and classes.

  ExplorerGS - Graphic version of MAZE.LAUNCHER.

  Shr Castle Metacus GS - navigate through the ever changing castle in
search of five fragments of the star key.

  Castle Metacus(Text version) - The text version is NOT shareware.

  GoldenBugGS - Eat as many bugs as possible but avoid the golden bug.

  ORE.MINER and ARROW.DODGE - two old applesoft games that are really fun.
