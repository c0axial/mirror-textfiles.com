VII SAVING AN ADVENTURE, AND RESTORING IT LATER

When  perils  strike  and  the  fate of the party is in jeopardy,
preserve the spirit of the adventure onto the disk we have  named
the  "Save  Disk."  This  way,  if  the  situation  later becomes
hopeless, you may send that party back in  time  to  the  earlier
conditions, as recorded on the Save Disk. 

This  is also useful if you must interrupt the quest.  Record the
adventure and later return. 


To save the adventure, enter:  SAVE

You will then need to insert the Save Disk.  If you have a second
disk drive, place the Save Disk there.  The program will ask  you
to  assign  a  number  to  the  version  of the adventure you are
saving.  Make a note of the number you give, and  the  conditions
of the adventrue.  The computer will alert you when the adventure
has been successfully saved and you may proceed. 

Up to 15 games may be saved onto your Save Disk


When you are ready to restore a past adventure, enter:  RESTORE

As before, insert the Save Disk, and, finally, give the number of
the adventure you wish to restore. 




VIII ADDENDA:  LORE USEFUL TO THE SERIOUS ADVENTURE

A.  MAP-MAKING
Let  your  mind  be  occupied  by  the fight itself, and not with
trivia of your where-abouts.  Have at  hand  numerous  sheets  of
gridded parchment, for map-making. 

On  these  sheets,  record  the  halls, the rooms, the stairs and
floors of  the  Keep.   Mark  every  step,  and  note  the  local
conditions.   Beware that the monsters are devious, and may cause
walls to shift and  doors  to  vanish.   Do  not  be  baffled  or
hindered, but merely reorder your party and press on. 


B.  WEAPONS & EQUIPMENT
Able  adventurers will make use of a variety of weapons, but will
choose wisely from  the  lot,  knowing  the  characteristics  and
powers of each piece. 

ATTACK WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT

AXE: 
Battle  axes  such  as  this,  far larger than those for chopping
wood, are also far more destructive. 

BASTARD SWORD: 
So named for its middling size, it reaches four feet. 

BREAKER BAR: 
Pry open chests, closed doors, and other obstacles  that  require
sturdy leverage. 

BROAD SWORD: 
Commonly seen, and measuring three feet. 

GREAT SWORD: 
Stretching  a full six feet, few enemies escape death when struck
by this instrument. 

KINSLAYER SWORD: 
A deadly weapon because of its enchantment.  One uses this at the
price of some power. 

MACE: 
Of classic proportions, the deadly spiked ball is attached to the
stout handle. 

QUARTER STAFF: 
Tough wooden poles, four and a half feet tall, fend of aggressors
from the user

SOGGY STICK: 
The remnants of a torch that has extinguished; a crude but  often
effective weapon. 

SOULEATER SWORD: 
Delivers  injuries  that  devastate  the  victim.   One uses this
weapon at the price of some power. 

TORCH: 
One torch will provide sufficient light for the entire party, and
will last for several moves. 

VALKHAM SWORD: 
Will fell a monster in a single blow.  Immensely powerful, but at
the cost of power to the user. 


DEFENSIVE EQUIPMENT

MEDIUM SHIELD: 
This rectangular shield of half the height of a human tapers to a
point at the bottom. 

GREAT SHIELD: 
Nearly of a warrior's stature, the sides curve out  slightly  and
protect well.

LEATHER ARMOR: 
The  simplest  and  lightest  form  of armor, made of sturdy sewn

RUNIC ARMOR: 
Magical  armor  of  plate  construction  which  augments a user's
defenses. 

STUDDED MAIL: 
Heavier  leather  is  reinforced  with  studs  of   metal,   more

Metallic  links overlap, lending a reptilian look to the garment.
Protection is greater than from the studded mail. 

CHAIN MAIL: 
Interwoven metal loops afford  better  coverage  than  the  scale
mail.

prior wearers.

E.  CREATURES

BARGUEST: 
Wolf-like and adept at magic.   The  Barguest  prefers  to  guard
places  of  power,  such as temples and castles, and comes to its
duties at the call of magic.  Its lack of  armor  should  not  be
confused with a physical frailty. 

BROLLACHAN: 
Two  eyes,  a  grinning mouth, and shapeless substance -- that is
all.  Evolved from horrible creatures in the  deepest  unexplored
marshlands,   the   Brollachan   is  difficult  to  destroy  with
conventional  weaponry.   at  the  lack  of   a   proper   spell,
adventurers should flee. 

COCKATRICE: 
A  thoroughly evil creature composed of the head, wings, and feet
of a large fighting cock.  Its body is covered with  scales,  and
it has a long, barbed serpent's tail. 

DEMON: 
A  large  humanoid  of  terrifying appearance.  Eyes cast an evil
gleam above protruding fangs, and the black body is often winged,
with a red glow as if from flame.  Enchanted or  mundane  weapons
often fail, for the Demon is near impossible to destroy. 

FACHAN: 
Bizarre  and feathered, this foul creature resembles the trunk of
a diseased tree.  One arm sprouts from the middle of  its  chest.
Its  lone  eye stares from the middle of its head.  it prefers to
batter its foes, and jumps from place  to  place  on  its  single
leg. 

FOUL FROND: 
This  green plant-like creature has a bite of poison that can lay
flat an adventurer in quick order.  When its  enemy  succeeds  in
cutting it down, it may leave behind a silver rose. 

GARGOYLE: 
Short,
 ropelled  by  bat-like  wings,  and  possessing  a  spiked tail,
spurred elbows, and a horned head.  The  gargoyle  is  physically
tough, with rough, stone-like skin.  Its magical powers are keen,
though the creature is not well-armored. 

GHOST: 
Quick  and  troublesome, the residual life force of a once living
creature, ghosts can be bitter about their plight and thus  quite
unpleasant.  An unfortunate death from before may have bound this
creature to a single spot. 

GOBLIN: 
Puny  and  dirty,  ugly  and  irritating.  Goblins often dress in
tattered, cast-off clothing and have little to distinguish them. 

HUMAN: 
The best of traits can turn the most sour.   A  small  number  of
these  adaptable  bipeds have turned to evil, and have used their
knowledge  of  armor  and  civilization  to  aid  the  realm   of
Dal'brad.   Humans can adopt a negotiative stance, but be wary of
traitors and falsehood. 

VENOMOUS SHEEP: 
Small  and  innocent  in  appearance,  these   mindless,   fanged
creatures  can  inject  a  powerful poison which has no antidote.
They display great aggression. 

OGRE: 
Physically strong but unmagical, the ogre is second cousin to the
Troll.  Its dark skin coloring is tinged with red. 

RED CAP: 
Evil creatures that  thrive  when  residing  on  sites  of  great
bloodshed.   Their  terms of service allow them to wet their caps
with the blood of their victims. 

STOOR WORM: 
A large, slow, python-like creature  with  a  dragon's  head  may
often  be found keeping guard over treasures.  After constricting
an adventurer's armor and shattering it, the Worm will batter its
victim. 

TROLL: 
A weaker relative to the Ogre, but nonetheless tough in  physical
battle.  This hideous humanoid has dark, scaly skin and misshapen
eyes.  They dislike sunlight; the dark has invaded their core and
has made them cunning and evil. 

WIGHT: 
Like  the Ghost, often has an unearthly tie to a grave.  They are
slow to act, possibly due to the rotting  corpses  they  inhabit.
Their great magical power makes them difficult adversaries. 

ZHIS'TA: 
A  hatred  of  evil  has  turned into a love of it.  When Zhis'ta
become part of the evil realm, their cunning and agility take  on
a  keeness  that  is  hard to overcome.  However, these traitors,
like the Humans that have come into the  Keep,  have  a  weakness
that can be turned to advantage at the hands of an able warrior.
