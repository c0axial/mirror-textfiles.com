                   [ A Full-Featured  ACOS Word Processor ]

 This program utilizes the ProTERM Special terminal emulation for its effects

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECKLIST

Here is a list of items that have been included in this package:

BLACKSPRING     : the actual program
BLACKSPRING.DOX : documentation on the program (what you're reading now)
UPDATES         : file which describes updates to the program

NUVISION.GS     : NuVision GS Video Driver.
NUVISION.PATCH  : Installation program.
NUVISION.DOCS   : Documentation for NuVison GS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION

To install BlackSpring into your system, you must first install NuVision GS.
By installing this patch you will be able to see ALL of the ProTERM Special
effects locally, thus taking alot of burden off of the editor.

Consult the NuVision GS Documentation file for installation procedures.

Now you will need to copy the USE file into your system.  Simply copy the
BLACKSPRING file to whichever drivespec you please.

And finally, you will need to modify your segments so that BlackSpring will be
incorporated into your system.  To do this, please refer to the next section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BLACKSPRING OPERATION NOTES

BlackSpring has a buffer size of 96,854 bytes.  However, the buffer size isn't
really measured in bytes, it's measured by lines (a line is equivalent to 79
bytes).  So really, the buffer size is 1226 lines.

The use format is as follows:

 use "x:blackspring",[username],[filename],[optional]

[username] = a3$                This is the variable containing the name of
                                the person who's using the editor.

[filename] = "x:filename"       This is the filename of the file that will be
                                written when the save option is issued.

[optional] = 0 or 1             This is only used when editing text files.  If
                                you wish to edit a text file this must be set
                                to 1.  Please refer to the next section.

When you return from BlackSpring, memory location 10 will contain one of three
values which will give you some miscellaneous information:

 peek(10) value 0 = No errors occurred and message was saved.
                1 = Message was aborted and not saved.
                2 = The file that was loaded was too large [buffer overflow].

BlackSpring creates a text file which corresponds to the SPEC/NAME defined in
the USE string.  You should copy this file into your MSG file and then delete
it.

Please refer to the program example at the end of this documentation file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDITING TEXT FILES WITH EDITOR

A unique feature of BlackSpring is that it allows you to edit text files
on-line.  These text files can only be 1226 lines long, and no longer.

The process is very simple.  Simply place a one in the [optional] extension
and the file will be loaded instead of created.

If the text file that you are loading is longer than 1226 lines, memory
location 10 will contain a 2 and BlackSpring will not allow you to edit it.

When the Save/Write command is issued the old text file will be written over
with the newly edited one.  If no text file existed, it will be created.

BlackSpring will allow you to use control characters in the text files.
Control characters will appear in inverse during editing.

If a line in a text file is longer than 79 characters, it will be split into
two different lines.  It is not recommended that you use BlackSpring to edit
segments, since most segments have lines that are longer than 79 characters.

Example Program:

 input @2 \"Filename to edit: " i$:if i$="" return
 use "g:blackspring",a3$,i$,1:if peek(10)=2 print \"File too long...":return
 if peek(10) \\"[ Aborted ]"
 return

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GETTING HELP FROM THE EDITOR

If you, or one of your users, is in need of a command list, then he/she only
has to press Control-A (user) or Open-Apple A (sysop) to get a Help Window.

The Help Window will appear on the screen.  You simply press RETURN when you
are done using the Help Window and the screen will be refreshed and you can
continue to write your file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMANDS

Control-A      Display Help Window
Control-B      Jump to Line 1 of the editor
Control-C      Center the current line of text
Control-D      Delete current line; pull text up
Control-E      Toggle Insert/Replace Mode
Control-N      Jump to Last Line of the file which you're editing
Control-P      Toggle Insert Control Characters ON/OFF
Control-W      Write: Save Message
Control-T      Toggle tab stop
Control-X      Clear the contents of the current line
Control-Y      Delete the word under the cursor
Control-Z      Insert Line; push text down
      DEL      Delete character to the left of cursor
      TAB      Jump to next tab stop
      ESC      Abort: Abort Message

Arrow Keys     The arrow keys allow for FULL SCROLLING CAPABILITIES

If the SysOp wishes to use BlackSpring, then he/she can only enact the above
commands by means of the Open-Apple key (instead of the Control key).  This
alleviates the compatability problem with the ACOS control-character commands.
