               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Welcome to Dazzle Draw - your entry into a world where everyone can be
an  artist.  Using  the  newest in Apple color technology, Dazzle Draw
lets you turn your monitor into an  artist's  canvas.  You  work  your
magic   with  a  mouse,  graphics  tablet,  drawing  pad...or  even  a
joystick. 

Using  the  full  16  colors  of  this  new  "double  high-resolution"
technology,  Dazzle  Draw  offers  you  a full selection of electronic
paint brushes. You can fill in areas, cut and paste or  copy  portions
of  your  drawing  and  create rectangles, ovals and straight lines in
seconds. For fine detailed work, you can zoom in on any  area  of  the
screen.  When  you're  done, you can save your creation onto a disk so
you can work on it another time, show it to your friends, audience  or
customers  in  a  "slide show." or use it as part of your own software
programs. 

If you have Apple's Scribe color printer  (or  another  color  printer
listed  on  the  Dazzle  Draw  package)  you  can even make full-color
printouts of your artistry. 

Dazzle Draw offers Apple //e  and  //c  owners  a  level  of  graphics
sophistication   previously  available  only  on  far  more  expensive
computers. Whether you're a professional artist, software developer or
a part-time doodler, you'll be drawing in no time.  And,  as  you  are
about to discover, every feature of Dazzle Draw is easy to use. 

So put on your creative cap and let your imagination run free.

               |           Using this Manual         |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

This  manual  is  divided  into  several  parts to show you how to get
started and how to use all the features of the program. 

The first section, Getting Started, tells you what you'll need to  use
the program and how to load it into your computer. 

Input  Devices  explains  how to use the mouse and other "tools of the
trade."

Dazzling Basics introduces the  menus  and  general  features  of  the
program.  If  you're  already  familiar  with  graphics software, this
section may be all you need to get started. 

Beginners should try out Your First  Drawing  and  then  read  through
Dazzling  Details, which takes you through all the menus step-by-step.
This section is also useful as a quick reference if you want to  learn
how to use particular features of the program. 

Four  Appendices  provide  technical  information  on  hardware  tips,
printer setup, color, and ProDOS, the disk operating  system  used  in
Dazzle Draw. 

The Glossary includes brief definitions of all the menus and functions
of the program and terms in the manual that may be unfamiliar. 

At  the very end, you'll find a list of Shortcuts and a display of all
menus for quick reference.

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

The following are Required: 

    
    o Apple //c or 128k //e. 
    
    o Disk Drive. 
    
    o Color TV or monitor. 
    
    o A mouse, Apple Graphics Tablet, Drawing pad  (such  as  a  Koala
    Pad, ErgoPad, or Animation Station), or joystick. 
    
    
The following are optional: 
    
    o Dot Matrix printer. 
    
    o Apple Scribe or Epson JX-80 color printer. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |             Start it up!            |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

1.  Insert  the  Dazzle  Draw  disk  into the disk drive, turn on your
monitor, and then your computer. The program will load automatically. 

2. Wait until the red light on the disk drive goes out. A title screen
will appear. A second screen will appear and  you  will  be  asked  to
provide the following information: 
    
    o  Type  the  appropriate number (1 through 4) that corresponds to
    the input device you will be using. 
    
    o Select which file system (Easy File or Professional File/ProDOS)
    you would like to use. If you are  not  familiar  with  ProDOS  we
    suggest  that  you  use  Easy  File.  For  more  information refer
    directly to the File section. 


Make a backup Copy

It's a good idea to make a backup copy of  Dazzle  Draw.  The  program
lets  you make one backup copy of the front side of the disk.  To make
a backup copy, you will need a separate blank disk. Press the ESC  key
while  the  program is loading, before the title screen appears.  Then
follow the easy, step-by-step prompts that appear on your  screen.   A
disk label is provided to identify the copy you make. Make certain the
disk  you  use does not have the square, write-protect notch along the
edge covered over with a tab or label.

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

For an introduction to the program, insert your Dazzle Draw disk  into
the  disk  drive with the label side down. Then turn on your computer.
Follow the on-screen prompts  for  a  brief  slide  show  of  drawings
displaying what Dazzle Draw can do. 

Later,  you'll  learn  to  make  automatic  slide  shows  of  your own
pictures, with you deciding the  sequence  and  timing  of  the  whole
show.

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

The  best  tools  for using Dazzle Draw are either a mouse or an Apple
Graphics Tablet. Although you can  use  a  drawing  pad  or  joystick,
you'll have less control over the cursor. 

With  your "artist's tool" you can move the cursor (a white pointer or
other shape) around the screen to select features from the program and
to create your drawings. 

This manual was written assuming you will be using a mouse.  Depending
on  which  input  device  you  use,  you'll  want  to keep in mind the
instructions below that apply. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |                Mouse                |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

To select a Dazzle Draw feature, move the cursor by moving  the  mouse
on  a  clean,  flat  surface  next  to  your computer until the cursor
reaches the feature you want. Press the mouse button to highlight your
choice, and then release the button.  This  is  called  "clicking  the
mouse."  To  draw,  move the mouse while holding down the button. Then
release the button to finish a stroke. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |          Graphics Tablet            |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Move the stylus on the surface of the pad to move  the  cursor.  Press
the pen down in place of pressing the mouse button. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |             Drawing Pad             |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Apply  pressure  to  the  tablet's surface to move the cursor. Use the
left pad button in place of the mouse button. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
                            Joystick
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Move the joystick up, down, left and right to  move  the  cursor.  Use
button 0 in place of the mouse button. 

Note - The buttons on various drawing tablets and joysticks may vary.

Before  you  begin,  take  a minute to study the screen. Your "canvas"
covers the entire screen, including the area behind the menus  at  the
top  of  the screen. The small white arrow is the cursor. It will take
on different shapes, depending on the feature you pick. 

The vertical band at the bottom of he screen is  the  scroll  bar.  It
lets  you  move  the  canvas up and down the screen so you can use the
entire drawing area without  obstructions.   You  select  features  in
Dazzle  Draw  through  the menus. These contain special operations for
drawing, choosing shapes, patterns, and colors, for  cutting,  pasting
and copying, and saving and retrieving your work.

               |           Moving the Cursor         |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Before  you  begin,  practice  moving  the cursor with the mouse.  You
don't have to hold down the button.

               |         Pulling Down Menus          |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>


Dazzle Draw feature are listed in "pull-down menus." This  means  that
you  "pull  down" each menu before selecting a feature in the program.
To take a look at the available features,  move  the  cursor  to  each
menu, one at a time, and press the mouse button. Like magic, a list of
features  appears  underneath  each  menu.  Remember  to hold down the
button, or the menu will disappear! 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |          Choosing Features          |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

To choose  one  of  Dazzle  Draw's  features,  simply  pull  down  the
appropriate  menu. Keep the mouse button held down and move the cursor
over the feature you want to highlight, and then release  the  button.
When a feature is gray, it can't be highlighted, and selecting it will
have no effect. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |            The Crown Menu           |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

The  Crown  menu  includes fundamental features of the program.  As an
exercise, select the first feature, About Dazzle  Draw...  Here's  how
you do it: 

1. Move the cursor to the Crown menu. 

2. When you reach it, hold down the mouse button. 

3.  Now  move the cursor over About Dazzle Draw...and then release the
button. 

4. A window with a message appears on the screen. 

5. To exit the feature and return to the main menus, move  the  cursor
to the small box to the left of the window name and click the mouse. 


Here are descriptions of the feature you'll find in the Crown menu: 


About Dazzle Draw

This  feature  is  like  a  title screen. It tells you how created and
published the program and the publication date. 


Help About

This is a built-in assistance tool that lets you call up some  helpful
information  about  all  the  menu feature and Undo. For a little help
from Dazzle Draw, just click the mouse over Help About...and then move
the cursor, now shaped  like  a  question  mark,  to  the  appropriate
feature.  A  window with a brief description of the feature appears on
the screen. You may use Help About at any  point  to  get  information
about a Dazzle Draw feature in use. Make sure your Dazzle Draw disk is
in the drive. 


Adjust Color

The  Adjust  Color  feature  puts color bars on the screen to help you
adjust your monitor. To exit, just click the  mouse  anywhere  on  the
screen. 


Printer Setup

This  feature only applies if you're using a printer with Dazzle Draw.
Dazzle Draw works on a variety of popular printers. Check the label on
the back of the box for particulars. You must  let  the  program  know
what king of printer you'll be using. Here's how: 

1. Pull down the Crown menu and select Printer Setup. 

2. The "dialogue box" shown above will appear on the screen. 

3.  The  dialogue box indicates three things: the name of the printer,
the name of the interface card, and the  slot  number  your  interface
card  is  in.  If  your printer, interface card, or slot number do not
match these, you must change the settings.  (If you have  a  //c,  you
can only change the printer settings.)

4. To change a setting, click the mouse on that item. The name will be
highlighted  and  the  bottom section of the dialogue box will display
your choices. Click the mouse over the up-and-down  arrows  to  scroll
through  your choices. When you see the name you want, just click over
it. 

5. To change another item, click the mouse over the item you  want  to
change and follow the same steps. 

6.  If  you  change  your mind at any time during this procedure, just
click the mouse over Cancel and Dazzle Draw will restore the  original
names. 

7.  If you don't want to make any changes, simply click the mouse over
Okay. The dialogue box will disappear. 


Note - To test your printer, make sure your printer  is  turn  on  and
"selected," then click Test in the dialogue box.  The message "Welcome
to Dazzle Draw" should print out on your printer. 


Quit Dazzle Draw

When  you're  ready  to  stop using Dazzle Draw, this feature lets you
remove the program from your computer's memory without turning off the
system. You can then start up another program. 

               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>
               |            The Undo Box             |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

You've probably noticed that the Undo box has  no  features.  This  is
because the Undo box has a unique function. It gives you the option of
"undoing"  the  last  step you took - for example, the last stroke you
drew or section you cut or pasted.  This option works only i  you  use
it  immediately  following  the action you want to take back, when the
Undo box is red. To undo an action, move the cursor to Undo and  click
the  mouse,  or  type  "z"  which  is  the  keyboard  shortcut fo this
function.

               |            About Windows            |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

Windows in Dazzle Draw are the boxes that appear in the middle of  the
screen  containing  either information about the program or "tools" fo
using he various features. 


Moving Windows

You can use a window from one feature (like Help About...) at the same
time you're working  with  another  feature  without  without  erasing
what's  on  th screen. You can also move the windows around the screen
so you can work more easily.  For example, if you  want  to  keep  the
Help About...window on the screen as you work here's what you do: 

1.  Move  the  cursor  into  the  white  title  band at the top of the
window. 

2. Press the mouse button. 

3. "Drag" the window to a more convenient  location  and  release  the
button. 

Note - Several window on the screen at one time will look like a stack
of  cards. To bring one up from the pile, just click the mouse over an
exposed area of the window you want it will jump to  the  top  of  the
pile. 


Using Tool Windows

When  you choose certain functions of the program, tool windows appear
at the bottom of the screen. A tool window is really like a tool  box.
It contains the tool you'll need to use the feature you've picked. For
now,  take a look at the tool window for Paint Brush.  It contains the
following features: 


Name - Identifies the tool window. 

Sizes - Lets you pick one of the four sizes for your paint brush. 

Shapes - Gives you a selection of six paint brush shapes. 

Solid Color or Pattern - Lets you decide whether  you  want  to  paint
with a solid color or pattern. 

Palette  -  Lets  you  pick  one  of  16  colors or 30 patterns from a
palette. 

Active Box - Tells you what color or pattern is active. 

Scroll Bar - Lets you expose the entire canvas by moving  the  drawing
area up and down. 

Exit Box - Lets you exit Paint Brush and return to the main menus.

               |           Watch the Colors!         |
               <=-=*=---------------------------=*=-=>

By  now  you  have probably noticed that the little boxes that contain
the names of the menus and features change color from  time  to  time.
Each of these colors has a specific meaning. 

Blue - It's okay to use this option. 

Yellow  -  You've just highlighted this option and it will be selected
when you release the button. 

Gray - This option is off bounds.  You can't use it right now. 

Red - Applies to Undo only. Lets you know when the Undo  functions  is
available.
