Grade -
The  basic  rating  of pitching skill: range 1 to 30 (higher is better).
Poor = 1 to 5, average = 6 to 10, good = 11 to 15, very good = 16 to 20,
super star = 21 to 25, immortal = 26 to 30. 

A pitcher may be  rated  as  a  starter,  a  reliever  (marked  with  an
asterisk),  or  both.  If  a pitcher started any game during the regular
season, he is rated as a starter. Some pitchers grades  as  starters  on
the  Line-up  Screen  also  have a seperate grade for relieving. In this
case, both ratings are displayed on his Player Screen. You can  check  a
pitcher's  official  statistics  for  games  appeared  in  (G) and games
started (GS) to see if he  pitched  primarily  as  a  starter  or  as  a
reliever during the actual season. 

The  grade can change during the game in several ways. If a poor pitcher
goes 5 consecutive innings without allowing an  earned  run,  his  grade
will  advance by 5 each inning thereafter, up to a grade of 20, or until
he gives up an earned run. An  average  pitcher  will  advance  after  6
consecutive  innings,  a  good  pitcher after 7, and a very good pitcher
after 8. Any pitcher's grade will go down 5 after allowing 5 earned runs
in 3 consecutive innings. These changes will be displayed  on  the  Game
Screen under the pitcher's name. 

Some  grade  changes  are  not displayed on the screen. Batter-to-batter
changes caused by the platoon rating of the batter  are  not  displayed.
Relief pitchers are more effective against the first batter they face if
they  enter  the  game  during  an  inning  (not  at the beginning of an
inning). This increased grade of 5 is  not  displayed.  Any  effects  of
durability (see below) are not displayed. 

Control -
Rates  pitching  control and strike-out ability: possible ratings are W,
XY, X, Y, and Z. 

W  = wild (walks)
XY = super star strike-out ratio (strike-outs/innings pitched)
X  = excellent strike-out ratio
Y  = good strike-out ratio (X any Y both increase strike-outs)
Z  = good walk ratio (decreases the number of walks, especialy with men on
base)

Move -
Rates the move to first: range 0 to 3 (higher is better). A pitcher's
move affects steal attempts and base advancement of a runner on first if
he's being held on. The better the move, the less chance of successful
advancement.

Durability -
Rates how long a pitcher can be expected to go while retaining his
initial effectiveness:range for starters 0 to 4, range for relievers 1 to 3
(lower is better).

You will have to learn to sense when your pitcher really loses it. A "4"
rated starter generally can be expected to tire beginning in the seventh
inning, a "1" rated starter in the ninth, and a "1" rated reliever in his
fourth inning of work.

HB -
Rates the frequency of hit-batsmen: 0 or no rating (0 is better). A "0"
rating reduces the number of batters hit by the pitch.

BK -
Rates the frequency of balks: 0 or no rating (0 is better). A "0" rating
reduces the number of balks.

WP -
Rates the frequency of wild pitches: range 0 to 3 (lower is better). A
lower rating reduces the number of wild pitches.

HR -
Rates the tendency to prevent or give up home runs: possible ratins are G,
H, L, M, or no rating. If a pitcher has a rating of G or H (H is better),
he will allow fewer home runs. If a pitcher has a rating or L or M (M is
worse), he will give up more home runs.

Season and Game Statistics for pitchers -
wins (W), losses (L), saves (S),
winning percentage (PCT), earned run average (for the season only) (ERA),
games appeared in (G), games started (GS), innings pitched (IP), hits (H),
runs (R), earned runs (ER), home runs (HR), total walks (TBB), hit-batsmen
(HB), strike-outs (SO), wild pitches (WP), balks (BK).

- END OF GAME OPTIONS

A game can end in several ways: one team can win after the regular nine
innings or in extra innings, the game can be rained out, one team can forfeit
the game by not being able to field nine eligible players, or the managers may
choose to "call" the game using [CONTROL] [X].

When the game ends, you will be given these options:

[U] Update win-loss records -
Update will determine the winning team, if
there is one, and if the teams come from the same data diskette and
the same organization, it will add one to the Wins column for the
winner and one to the Losses column for the losing team. It will also
recalculate the games behind (GB) for all teams in the division.
These updates are displayed on the Team Selection Screen. Update
cannot be used for PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL.

Important note: Only an official game has a winner or loser. For the
updating option, an official game is one that has gone 4 1/2 innings if the
home team is ahead, or 5 innings if the home team is behind, whether the game
was ended by rain or by [CONTROL] [X]. A game that ends in a tie is not
considered an official game for the purposes of this program. A forfeited game
is an official game. (A game is forfeited when one team is unable to field a
complete line-up). Only official games can be used to update records.

Updating and printing can be done in either order. The other options
below - [S] and [R] - destroy the game statistics and eliminate the possibility
of updating the win-loss records automatically with the current game results
(but see [C] Correct).

[S] Same Teams in Same Park -
Allows you to play another game with the
same teams in the same ball park. If you want a different home team
or if you want to select new rules, you must use the [R] Restart
option below. [S] Same Teams asks you new for a new line-up for each
team.

[R] Restart -
Takes you back to the Rules and Data Screen, from which you
will be able to change the rules, speed of dynamic decisions, sound,
and the teams being played.

Important note: To review the game performance of a player screen at the
end of a game, press [CONTROL] [O] or [CONTROL] [D], then [D] Display, followed
by the appropriate player indentification ([A]...[Z] or [1]...[9]). This must
be done before choosing [S] Same Teams or [R] Restart, otherwise the game
statistics will have been erased.

- INTRODUCTION TO DRAFTING

DRAFT will make you Commissioner, owner, general manager, and manager at
the same time. You can set up your own baseball organization with leagues and
divisions. Draft your own teams. Establish a farm system. When you have set
up a league, be sure to send in your customer registration card to recieve news
of program updates and enhancements.

[How to Load Draft]

1. Put the Draft Diskette in drive 1 and side A of the Data Diskette in
drive 2.

2. Turn on the computer, or, if it's on, simultaneously press [CONTROL]
[Open Apple] [RESET].

The Copyright Screen will appear, followed by the Create/Modify
Organizations Screen.

- CREATING A NEW ORGANIZATION

For each organization you wish to create, decide how many leagues you want
(up to 2), how many divisions (up to 4 in each league, up to 6 total), and how
many teams in each division (up to 14 in each division; up to 30 in each
organization; up to 100 teams in all including PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL).

Below are three examples of baseball organizations that could be created:

                  [Example 1]

Organization Name:          Home Baseball
League name(s):  Lyme League
Division(s):     Pro                 Farm
Team name(s):    BUDAPEST Bombers    BUDAPEST Farm
                 HONG KONG Kongers   HONG KONG Farm
                 WOONSOCKET Rockets  WOONSOCKET Farm

                  [Example 2]

Organization Name:          Sunbelt League
League name(s):       ---
Division(s):          ---
Team name(s):    TAMPA Z's
                 PRESCOTT Powers

                                  [Example 3]

Organization      Name:          Office Baseball
League name(s):  League 1         League 2
Division(s):     Div 1  Div 2     Div 1  Div 2
Team name(s):    BALT   CAL       CHI    ATL
                 BOS    CHI       MONT   CIN
                 CLE    KC        NY     HOU
                 DET    MIN       PHI    LA
                 MIL    OAK       PIT    SD
                 NY     SEA       STL    SF
                 TOR    TEX

Notice that the  organization  title,  Office  Baseball,  has  the  same
structure used for major league baseball. Some people may want to replay
the  actual season represented by the Data Diskette. The Office Baseball
organization will allow you to do this and keep team  records  and  make
roster  changes  as they actually occurred during the season represented
by the Data Diskette.  The  rosters  of  the  organization  PROFESSIONAL
BASEBALL  cannot  be modified, and neither can its win-loss records, but
its rosters can be copied. 

[Setting up the Organization, Leagues and Divisions]

Decide how best to structure your new organization (see examples above),
and follow the steps listed below. 

Important note: In draft, pressing [RETURN] will advance you to the next
screen. Pressing [ESC] will bring you back to the previous screen. 

<Create the Organization>

1. Press the number [2]..[6] under which you wish to store the  name  of
your organization. 

2.  Type the name as you want it to appear on the organization list. You
are allowed up to 25 characters. If you are planning to  have  only  one
league  in  your new organization, you may wish to name the organization
using the league name - see example 2 above. 

3. Press [RETURN]. A highlighted pointer will appear  where  the  league
names will be entered. 

<Create the First League>

4. Type the name of the first league (20 characters maximum). 

Skip  this  step  if  you do not want any leagues - for instance, if you
have given the league name to the organization. If you  do  not  give  a
name to the first league, you will not be able to create a second league
for this organization. 

5.  Press  [RETURN].  A highlighted pointer will appear under the league
name. 

<Create the Divisions in the First League>

6. Type the name  of  the  first  division  in  the  league.  Up  to  20
characters  are allowed. Skip this step if you do not want any divisions
in this league. 

7. Press [RETURN]. 

8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for  additional  divisions.  Enter  up  to  four
divisions  if  you  are planning to have one or two league, up to six if
you have no leagues. 

Hint: you may wish to establish a farm system as a division.  Each  FARM
division  would  have the same number of teams as each PRO division (see
example 1 above). 

<Complete the Organization>

9. Repeat steps 4 through 8 for the second league. 

10. Check that the organizations, leagues, and divisions are as you want
them. If you have any changes, use [R] Rename and [D]  Drop  to  correct
them. 

You  cannot  [D]  Drop  a  league  or division. You can only [D] Drop an
organization. If you [D] Drop the organization, you will lose all of its
teams and rosters. You  can  [R]  Rename  an  organization,  league,  or
division. 

11.  When  you  have  finished  naming  the  organization,  leagues, and
divisions, press [RETURN] to continue. The Add/Select Teams Screen  will
appear. 

[Adding Teams to the New Organization]

1.  Using  [SHIFT]  [1],  choose  the  league to which you wish to add a
team.  Your choice is highlighted. 

2. Using [SHIFT] [2], or the right/left arrow keys, choose the  division
to which you wish to add a team. Your choice is highlighted. 

3. Press [A] Add team. 

4. Type the team name (up to 15 characters). 

5. Press [RETURN]. The arrow cursor will remain on the same line. 

6.  Type  the team nickname (up to 9 characters). This name will be used
on the line score on the Game Screen. 

7. Press [RETURN]. 

8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 for the remaining teams in the division. 

9. Repeat steps 2 through 8 for each division in the league. 

10. Repeat all of the above for each league in the organization. 

When all of the teams for all divisions have been named, you  are  ready
to add players to your teams. 

[Adding Players]

You  may  add  players  by  either  exporting  an  entire roster from an
existing team and importing the roster to a new  team,  or  by  drafting
individual players. 

[Exporting and Importing]

To  copy  an  entire roster from one team to another, use the [E] Export
and [I] Import commands. [E] Export will copy the roster of a team  into
memory.   [I] Import copies that roster under a new team name and writes
it to disk. 

This process is useful for setting up your own league in which  you  can
modify  to  reflect  roster  changes  made during the actual season. Try
copying one of the teams in PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL to a new team with  no
current players. 

To [E] export the team roster: 

1.  From  the Create/Modify Organizations Screen, press [1] to highlight
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL (or another organization that contains the  roster
you want to copy). 

2. Press [RETURN] to proceed to the Add/Select Teams Screen. 

3.  Choose  the  league  and division of the team you wish to copy using
[SHIFT] [1] and [SHIFT] [2]. 

4. Highlight the team using the up/down arrow keys. 

5. Press [E] Export to load the team into memory. 

6. Press [ESC] to return to the Create/Modify Organizations Screen. 

Important note: You may [E] Export from any organization, not just  from
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL. 

To [I] import the team roster: 

1.  Select  or  create  the  organization  which will contain the copied
team.  The organization will be highlighted. 

2. Press [RETURN] to advance to the Add/Select Teams Screen. 

3. Choose the appropriate league and division using the [SHIFT] [1]  and
[SHIFT] [2] keys. 

4.  Add  or  select  the team to contain the roster you are copying. The
team will be highlighted. 

5. Press [I] Import to write the entire exported  roster  onto  a  disk.
Importing  will  erase  any  players  previously  drafted  for  the team
highlighted. 

6. Press [Y] to confirm import. 

Important notes: You may not [I]  Import  to  PROFESSIONAL  BASEBALL.  A
roster many NOT be copied from one data diskette to another. 

- DRAFTING A TEAM

To  add  individual  players to a team roster, proceed to the Add/Select
Teams Screen. 

1. Press [SHIFT] [1] to select a league. 

2. Press [SHIFT] [2] to select a division. 

3. Press the up/down arrow keys to select a team. 

4. Press [RETURN]. The Draft Screen will appear. 

[The Draft Screen]

The upper left corner shows the name of  the  team  being  drafted.  The
upper  right  corner  shows  the number of major league baseball players
available for the draft and the year (season) of the Data Diskette. 

The top part of the Draft Screen displays nine  names  of  major  league
baseball  players.  For  a  non-pitcher, the name is followed by primary
position (Pos), defensive rating at that position (D), batting side (B),
and speed (Sp).  For a pitcher, the name is followed by position  (Pos),
throwing arm (T), pitching grade (GR), and control ratings (Ctrl). 

The nine names that first come up on the screen are the first nine names
in  an alphabetical listing of all the players. You can move through the
player list in several ways: 

Up and down arrow keys will scroll the list of names. 

[F] First will take you home to the top of the list. 

[L] Last will take you to the end of the list. 

[S] Search will take you directly to a part of the list  you  specify  -
press  [S],  then type the first three letters of the player's name, and
press [RETURN]. 

[U] Update will save your roster. 

The  lower  part  of  the  screen  displays  the  current  team  roster.
