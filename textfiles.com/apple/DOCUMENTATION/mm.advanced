                          Beginners Guide to Adventure 

THE WORLD

The world is dved into five towns, underground caverns and dungeons,
open terrain, rivers and seas, and mountainous areas.  In general, the
more dangerous the area is, the more treasure you can expect to find. 

Towns are important because they contain: 
   
  o Shops where food, weapons, armour, and other equipment can be
   purchased. 
   
  o Temples where sick or injured character may be healed. 
   
  o Training grounds where characters may advance to higher experience
   levels, provided they have the required experience points. 
   
  o Inns where characters must be taken for safe harbour at the end of
   each game session, if the game information is to be saved. 

Underground caverns and dungeons contain multiple levels, with the
danger (and possible gains) increasing at each lower level. 

Mountains and bodies of water frequently offer only one route of
passage, which may be heavily guarded by dangerous monsters. 

Avalanches may cause montain passes o shift, and spring torrents may
flood river fords.


SPELLS

Only certain clases of characters may cast spells.  There are 94
different spells, divided into CLERICAL and SORCEROR spells, with 7
SPELL LEVELS in each division. 

Characters who may cast clerical spells may not cast sorceror spells,
and vice versa.

The level of spell which a character may cast is determined by his
experience level. When you first begin, concentrate on level one spells,
since these are the only ones you may cast. 

All spells cost spell points. Higher level spells may also cost a number
of magical GEMS. Gems must be found along the way.
