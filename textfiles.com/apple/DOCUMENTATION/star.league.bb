  <-                  Run back
  Space               Stop Runner

GROUNDER. FLY balls can be CAUGHT for an out; GROUNDERS require  you  to
take some action to force an out (throw to base, tag runner, etc.). 

5. To catch a FLY ball, keep your eye on the ball's SHADOW.  As the ball

The positions on the joystick areset up  just  like  the  bases  on  the
screen  -  throwing from base to base will soon be like second nature to
you. 

3. If a runner tries to steal HOME you must MOVE your catcher to TAG the
runner coming home, If you don't MOVE your catcher the runner  will  run
by you and score. 


Scoring
-------

1  STRIKE  - pitch that crosses homeplate between batter's shoulders and
knees. Three stries result in an out. 

2 BALL - pitch that is high or lowour of strike zone. Four balls results
in a walk

3 OUT - catching fly balls, striking out  batters  and  forcing  tagging
runners results in an out. There are three outs per half-inning. 

4  BATTING  ORDER  -  visitors  bat top of inning; home or computer bats
bottom of inning. 

5 RUNS - score runs by moving runnrs around the bases  and  home.   Team
ahead after 9 innings wins game. If score is tied after 9 innings, extra
innings will be played until one team wins.  HOME or COMP doesn't bat at
the bottom of the 9th or extra innings if it is ahead



As  the  game  progresses, the starting pitchers "tire" They'll begin to
lose their "stuff" and/or start missing the strike zone. Between the 7th
and 8th innings there will be a 7th inning stretch, complete with music.
A menu will come up for you to change pitchers.  When  both  teams  have
made their selections press to re-start the game.
