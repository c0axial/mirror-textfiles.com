About X.Jump
------------

  These are two "use" files for ACOS which act similar to ON X GOTO.


The following set up MUST be followed when using X.JUMP

 use "a:x.jump",x        <- set x to any variable, with a number from 1-64
 goto qscan              <- jump to this label if x=1
 goto subs               <- jump to this label is x=2
 .
 .
 etc

The set up for X.JUMP2 is the same, except the number may be from 0-63.
 

Ending Comments:
----------------

  Make sure you have the correct amount of labels after the use, so that you
don't get a syntax error.

  X.Jump is faster than the normal " if x=43 goto label".  However you may not
notice the difference if your running over 1 mhz, or if your jumping to low
numbers.  But overall it is faster.

  If you have any questions or comments give my board a call.
