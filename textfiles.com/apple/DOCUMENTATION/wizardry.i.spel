MAGIC...

The acquisition and use of magic items is of paramount importance to the
successful adventurer. A good magic item can be worth any price in certain
situations.

Magic items range from one-use potions and scrolls to some of the most powerful
artifacts known. Some are available in the Trading Post, but most of the really
important ones can only be found in the depths of the maze, usually guarded by
fearsome monsters.

Magic items may do many things, Generally they will do one or more of the
following:

-Cast a spell
-Alter armor class
-Alter fighting ability
-Protect against certain monsters
-Work better against certain monsters
-Give the user special abilities
-Be useable only by certain characters

There are some magic items that will do other things. These capabilities will
only come to light when they are used.

When magic items are first found in the maze, their true nature is not known.
Only Bishops or the Trading Post can identify them. Even so, some items may
have hidden attributes. Some items are Cursed. When you have a cursed item in
your possession and you equip, you will be forced to use it! This usually has
detrimental consequences, especially when your sword decides not to fight
anymore!

When a Bishop inspects an item, he takes a chance that he will touch it. If
this happens he is forced to equip, and if it is cursed, too bad.

While some items can cast spells, most spell casting is done by Mages, Priests
and the like. There are 50 spells, divided into Mage and Priest categories Each
category is further divided into seven levels of power. The higher the level of
the spell, the more potent it is. Each spell has a "power word" required to
cast it, and when asked what spell is to be cast, this word must be entered,
Following is a complete description of all the spells. For each spell, the
name, translation, level, type of spell and area of effect are given. The type
of spell refers to when the spell can be cast (Combat, Camp, or anytime).

help the party.

LEVEL 7 MAGE SPELLS


   Spell Name  : MALOR
   Translation : APPORT
   Spell Level : 7
   Spell Type  : COMBAT and CAMP
Area of Effect : ENTIRE PARTY

This spell's effects depend on the situation the party is in when it is cast.
Basically, MALOR will teleport the entire party from one location to another.
When used in melee, the teleport is RANDOM, but when used in camp, where there
is more chance for concentration, it can be used to move the party anywhere in
the maze. Be warned, however, that if you teleport outside of the maze, or into
an area that is solid rock, you will all be lost forever, so this spell is to
be used with the greatest of care. Combat use of MALOR will never put you
outside of the maze, but it may move you deeper in, so it should be used only
in panic situations.

   Spell Name  : MAHAMAN
   Translation : GREAT CHANGE
   Spell Level : 7
   Spell Type  : COMBAT
Area of Effect : ENTIRE PARTY

The same restrictions and qualifications apply to this spell as do to HAMAN.

when there is no other hope for survival.

of damage.
