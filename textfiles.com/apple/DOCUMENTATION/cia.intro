TRICKY DICK is a disk editor that can be used on both normal and most
protected disks. It will read in a sector directly from disk and list
the sector's contents to screen or printer in Integer, Applesoft,
assembler, hex and ASCII. Tricky Dick can patch and customize your disk,
protect your software, and read and alter normal and most protected disks.

THE LINGUIST dumps a track of raw nibbles directly from any disk - protected
or not. It also decodes address data on the disk and translates raw disk
nibbles into hex. The translated nibbles then can be listed by TRICKY DICK
in BASIC, assembler and ASCII. This makes it possible to list the programs
and textfiles from any disk, normal, damaged or locked. It can be used to
look closer at a program, examine disk formatting and recover lost programs
no matter how badly the disk is damaged.

THE TRACER automatically searches normal and most protected disks sector by
sector for any 1-6 strings you specify in ASCII or hex. It will also find
the VTOC, catalog sectors, and track/sector lists on normal and protected
disks. You can choose any or all of its 9 search options, and they will be
carried out simultaneously, scanning an entire disk in 19-135 seconds. When
it finds something that you're looking for it jumps back into TRICKY DICK
and places a cursor on the item it's found.

THE CODE BREAKER makes use of a special table in DOS 3.3 and 3.2 to decrypt
the most popular "secret code" used to hide commercial programs from prying
eyes.

THE TRACKER shadows the disk arm, reporting its every move as DOS LOADS,
SAVES, RENAMES, or does anything else to a disk. It leaves a list of every
track and sector visited, and every read or write operation carried out
during any disk access. THE TRACKER can be used to find out exactly where
a disk is crashing, make a permanent record of your files, and learn more
about how DOS works.

THE CIA MODULES

TRICKY DICK controls the operations of the other CIA utilities. First, BRUN
TRICKY DICK. Then when you need to call upon one of the other utilities,
you BLOAD it. A single keystroke transfers control to the utility you BLOAD
and enables it to carry out its work. During certain operations, the module
will pass data to TRICKY DICK for special processing. For example, when the
TRACER finds a string it's looking for, it jumps back to TRICKY DICK,
displays the string, and places TRICKY DICK'S cursor on the first character.
TRICKY DICK is in charge and you can edit the string and/or other data in
the sector where it resides.

The only exception to this system is THE TRACKER which works alone.
