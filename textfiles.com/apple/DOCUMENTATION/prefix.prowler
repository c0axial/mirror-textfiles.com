        The Prefix Prowler is a wardialer with many useful features.  It gives you full control over dialing speed and connect parameters, so the program can be custom-fit to any prefix in any fone system.

        After the initial niceties, the program displays "The Prefix Prowler" on the top line of the screen.  Immediately under this is displayed "Load Data File".  Throughout all of the programs, this screen heading format is used.  By looking at the top few screen lines, you can immediately tell which program and sub area you are in.  The Prowler then waits for you to select the disk drive from which your datafile will be accessed.  Use the arrow keys and RETURN to select the drive, or press [ESC] to exit the Prowler and return to the Hackamatic menu.   After you have selected the drive, you are prompted for the filename.  If you press RETURN without entering a filename, the Prowler assumes you mean no datafile will be used.  If you enter a filename, the Prowler will attempt to read it from the selected disk drive.  If the file does not exist, you will be asked if you want it created.

        You are then asked a wad of boring questions such as:
"SLOT OF MODEM?"  (I am sure you can figure it out.  But you might know that you can press [ESC] here to return to the Load Datafile Screen.)
"USE PROMOTHEUS PROMODEM?" (I won't even explain this one)
"USE AN EXTENDER?" (Here, answer [Y] if you plan to use an alternate long distance service)

        If you answered Yes to the above question, the Prowler then asks "EXT. AREA CODE"  after which you enter the area code (if any) of the alternate long dist. service you are using.  If you are using a WATS extender, enter 1800 for the area code.  The Prowler will then prompt you for the long dist. service number and the access code.  If you are not using a Promodem (which senses the access tone automatically) the Prowler will ask "DELAY BEFORE DIALING CODE".  Here you type the delay (in seconds) for the Prowler to wait before dialing the access code.  Finally you are prompted to enter "DELAY AFTER CODE".  Here you type the number of seconds for the Prowler to wait after dialing the code before dialing the war number.

        Next question: "WARDIALING AREA CODE".  (if you are not using an alternate long dist. service, (but remember real men don't use AT&T) enter a '1' before the area code.  This area code is the one in which your wardialing prefix lies.  If you plan to prowl a local prefix, hit RETURN alone to specify no area code.)

Prowling right along...
"STARTING NUMBER"....."ENDING NUMBER"  (Guess what these are...)
"INCREMENT OR [R]ANDOM"  (Type either the numerical wardialing number increment, or enter "R" (no quotes) for Random Dialing.)

...We interrupt this discussion for a word from our author...

     The Random Dialing option is useful for wardialing touchy prefixes.  (Police numbers, militay bases, phoneco test prefixes, etc.)  I once knew a {somewhat short} pirate who left his wardialer running on the prefix of a large broadcasting corporation one night.  He awoke the next day only to find that every dialing attempt had bombed due to 'no dial tone'.  He checked his fone, and found it completely dead.  Somehow he contacted the fone company and asked the reason for its untimely demise.  They explained that it had been disconnected for a 'security violation' or something of that sort.  The phone pigs (commonly known as "phigs") said that they had received a complaint from an operator at the broadcasting corp. during the night.  She said she noticed the fones ringing through the building and suspected a computer break-in attempt.  (She'd seen "Wargames" too many times, no doubt.)  The pirate managed to bluff a story of computer illiteracy and convinced them that he had been trying to call a friend with his new modem and had left it unattended.  He said he (read the following out loud with nose firmly plugged for proper effect)  "had no idea how it possibly went out of control dialing all those numbers."  Luckily the phigs were comparably stupid, and he got his fone reconnected.

...now back to our program...

If you select Random dialing, the Prowler asks for "RANDOM DIALING BLOCK LENGTH".  To dial randomly, yet avoid skipping any numbers, the Prowler dials the numbers in random "blocks" of varying size;  i.e. if you selected a Block Length of 20, the Prowler would shuffle the next 20 numbers, dial them randomly, and then move on to the next block of 20 numbers.  A random block of 99 would be even less detectable, but impractical unless you really planned to call all 99.  With Random Dialing, the default STARTING NUMBER takes the value of the first number in the current block.  So if you have been hacking a prefix randomly and load the info from a datafile into the Prowler, the default at the "STARTING NUMBER" prompt will be the first number in the current block - NOT NECESSARILY THE NEXT NUMBER TO DIAL!

Finally the Prowler asks you if you still believe all that you entered, "CORRECT?"  If you type 'N', you will be placed back at the initial "SLOT OF MODEM" prompt. 

The next screen opens with "TIME TO WAIT FOR CARRIER".  If you need to, you can press [ESC] to back up to the previous screen.  Otherwise enter a value from 1 to 255 seconds.  The default value of 20 is equivalent to about 2 standard rings.
Next is "TOUCH TONE SPACING".  Enter a value between 30 and 255.  This value represents the duration and spacing of the dialing tones in milliseconds.  Values below about 50 cause the modem to dial so quickly that it is not always reliable.
Then, if you are using a Promodem, the Prowler asks "NUMBER OF REDIALS ON BUSY".  This can be a value from 0-99.
The last question is "SPEAKER ON?"  Answer [Y] if you wish to audibly monitor the prowling.

Again you are asked "CORRECT?"  Type 'Y' to declare war.

        The wardialing screen is divided into 3 windows.  The top window displays modem commands and dialing status, the middle window the numbers which have been dialed, and the bottom window the key to number display formats.  Flashing numbers are those to which the Prowler connected, inverse numbers are those skipped due to busy signals (on the Promodem), and those marked with an inverse 'N' were skipped with the 'N' command explained below:

RUNTIME COMMANDS:
-----------------
Anywhere during dialing at the ? prompt you can enter one of the following commands.  If you are using a Promodem, you must follow the commands with [RETURN].  Notice that they must be entered *ALONE* after the ? input prompt.

N:  Skip to the next number.
R:  Redial current number (useful if your modem lacks automatic busy signal redialing)
Q:  Quit and save datafile (if one is used)
G:  Pop up Graphics Page 2.  Useful if mommy walks in to see if you are learning anything with your expensive toy.
T:  Text screen (use to get back to the text display after the 'G' command)
1:  Signal the Prowler that the current number has answered with a carrier and flag it as a successful connect.

An army helmet for your telephone is suggested, but not required.

        Happy Warring.
