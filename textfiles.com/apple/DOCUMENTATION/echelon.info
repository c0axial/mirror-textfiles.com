                   Echelon    -    Patrol Zone Highlights


A-1: Ancient bridge spans a frozen river bed in Sector H-7. Elements of bridge
date back 3,000 years.

A-2: Major battle of the Alphan War took place over this area. Several destroyed
spacecraft of the Alphan and ISF configuration can still be found on the surface
throughout the area. The Echelon target range is located in sectors H-4 thru
H-10. Only ISF personnel with level 1 security clearance are authorized within
these sectors.

A-3: The Echelon training simulator Floating Tunnel in Sectors F-7 through F-10.
Only ISF personnel with Level 1 security are authorized within these sectors.

A-4: Remains of ancient Isis city can be found in Sector C-9.

A-5: The research station located in sector I-7 was set up by Dr. Adrian Van
Kempe, his daughter Sonja, and his research assistance. Van Kempe was generally
considered to be top of his field in the Science of Astro Physics. In April 2092
he sent a message to his old Univerity informing them that his experiment with
Lithicite crystal was a failure and that he was closing down his research
facility to accept a poisition with a private corporation.Van Kempe, his
daughter, and research assistance have not been heard from since. It is assumed
their spacecraft was lost on its return back to Earth.

A-6: Mining and drilling operations were set up in Sectors D-10, E-11, and H-12
after rich deposits of dylidium were located in this area in 2082.

B-1: Probes sent to this area have been unable to verify a report that an
ancient civilization lies somewhere in this area. Ships on patrol are requested
to report this find if any evidence is found.

B-2: Echelon Target Range located in Sectors F-8, G-8, H-8, I-10, and J-11. Only
authorized ISF personnel with Level 1 security clearance are allowed within
these sectors.

B-3: The Echelon Obstacle Course is located in B-12. Only ISF personnel with
Level 1 clearance are autorized within this sector. A landing airstrip is in
Sector J-10. Try your luck landing here.

B-4: The Echelon Ground Obstacle Course is located in Sectors F-4 through F-7.
Only ISF personnel with Level 1 clearance are autorized within these sectors.

B-5: No information available. Area has several structures photographed by
satellite, but large tracts of the area are unexplored.

B-6: Gigantic Rock Figures in Sector L-11 display detailed work of great
craftmanship. Many scientits have suggested that these figures had religious
significance to the early inhibitants of the planet.

C-1: Large Ancient Dam is located on a frozen river bed in Sector F-10.

C-2: During an exploration of this area, and extraordinary and startling image
was found. A huge star figure, covering an area of sveral sectors was
discovered. A concentrated study has been made of this figure and comparisons
have been made between the star figure and similar figures found on Earth in
South America. So far, the purpose and origins or this star have not yet been
established.

C-3: Ancient bridge spans a frozen river in Sector M-9.

C-4: In sector M-12 is an early refuel and supply area known as the Crossroads.
The Crossroads was an early outpost used extensively in the early and mid 21st
Century for scientific expeditions. More modern facilities at other sites were
later constructed and the Crossroads was abandoned. The Echelon Training course
(touch and go) is located in Sectors H-6 thru H-10. Only ISF personnel with
Level 1 security clearance are autorized within these sectors.

C-5: One of the most severe blows to the ISF occurred in Sector C-5. After 16
months travel from Earth, Largo, the largest of the ISF superfreighters was
nearing Echelon. The Pirate raids had been taking their toll on Echelon reserve
supplies and many items aboard the Largo were in short supply at the base. The
freighter was under military escort and at last report, indicated at current
spped they would reach Echelon within the next week. That was the last message
received from the Largo. At Echelon HQ, the position of the superfreighter was
being routinely scanned. Suddely the large ship stopped and vanished from the
monitor screen. Six LC-24s were scrambled to the last known heading. When they
arrived, all that was found were the remains of several escort fighters but the
freighter itself was gone. A thorough search was undertaken, but the huge
freighter was never found. The loss of supplies nearly spelled disaster for the
base. Supplies of food and medical equipment nearly ran out before an emergency
shipment could be received from surrounding colonies. It is assumed that pirates
attacked the Largo. By employing communication disrupters and stealth equipment,
the distress message was blocked. The mystery of what happened to the freighter
after the attack, however, remains to be solved.

C-6: Area C-6 was opened up in 2039 to independant mining operations. Isolated
settlements can be found throughout the area. Most are abandoned now because of
the Pirate attacks in the area.

D-1: Independant Mining Facilites are located throughout this area.

D-2: No information available. Area has several large structures photographed by
satellite. Large tracts remain unexplored.

D-3: Remains of Ancient Isis City can be found in Sector H-3. City has several
large buildings that are sill intact.

D-4: No information available. Area has many large structures which have been
photographed by satellie but large tracts remain unexplored.

D-5: The Refinery located in B-7 was built in 2042 to process Dylidium and
Titanium into a high strength alloy. The facility was built to furnish
replacement parts for spacecraft during the Alphan War.

D-6: Tha McAdams Penitentary located in Sector I-10 was built in 2054 for
prisoners who were considered too dangerous to be housed in other facilities.
The inmates were required to work in the Dylidium mines. When Lithicite, a very
unqiue crystal, was discovered at the mine, many prisoners were killed in a
strange accident. Apparently the laser used to mine Dylidium can excite the
crystal and under the right conditions cause an explosion. This led to riots in
2082 where 350 inmates escaped in a prison freighter. Most of the prison itself
was destroyed in the revolt and the remaining inmates were transferred to other
facilities. The prison was officially closed in March 2082.

E-1: The Abandoned Landing Strip in Sector C-7 was established in 2021 as the
original ISF base of opertations. The landing strip was attacked during the
early phase of the Alphan War and personnel were evacuated to a more defensible
postition.

E-2: The Research Radio Telescope in Sector C-9 was built in 2037. Information
and data at this site are analyzed by astronomers at Echelon.

E-5: No information available. Area has several large structures photographed by
satellite but large tracts remain unexplored.

E-6: The Mining Facility located in Sectors C-7 was set up in 2039 when large
deposits of the element Dylidium were discovered. Dylidium when combined with
Titanium makes an extremely strong alloy and is used primarily in the
construction of the outer hulls of spacecraft. The mining operations began using
prisoners from the McAdams Penitentary in 2054. In 2079, Lithicite crystal was
discovered at the site. This crystal is extremely and can explode if not handled
correctly. Efforts to mine the Lithicite crystal were unsuccessful and over 30
prisoners were killed in mining accidents.  The mine was shut down in 2083 when
more plentiful Dylidium deposits were discovered at other locations. This
location, though deserted is considered dangerous and only military and mining
officials with Level 3 security clearance may visit the site.

F-1: Remains of an Ancient Isis city can be found in sector F-6.

F-2: Sector L-6 features a large object that has been nicknamed the Great Horn.
The 'Horn' was constructed by some alien civilization over 20 million years ago.
The material is metal that is not found anywhere in our solar system as far as
we know. It is so hard that it is virtually indestructible.

F-3: The Space Platform in K-11 is owned by a private mining corporation.
Remains of an ancient Isis town in Sector I-6 has been dated over 4000 years
old.

F-4: No Information available. Area is unexplored.

F-5: Ancient remains of a small town located in Sector E-7.

F-6 No information available. Area is unexplored.
