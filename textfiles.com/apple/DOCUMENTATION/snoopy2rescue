    The Game:
    =========
    
    Woodstock   is   missing!   Snoopy,  the  Super  Sleuth,  knows  who's
    responsible.  The feline fiend,  Professor  Morehairy,  has  kidnapped
    Woodstock. 
    
    Can  the  Super  Sleuth  rescue  Woodstock  from Morehairy's castle of
    danger?  Can he escape from the traps and treacherous  robots  lurking
    in every room?  Read on and become part of Snoopy's spell-binding tale
    of mystery! 
    
    <<  THE  CONNECTION  >> is an action-packed, two-sided adventure game.
    There are six challenging levels to play on each  side  of  the  disk.
    Help Snoopy climb to the top of the castle on Side 1.  Help him try to
    capture  Morehairy  on  Side  2.  You can begin with either side.  But
    watch out!  Side 2 is far more dangerous. 
    
    On every floor, challenges await you - flying  carpets,  magic  lamps,
    trap doors, moving floors and, of course, Morehairy's robot guards! 
    
    Warm Up:

                !                                !
                ! All players using an Apple //e !
                ! must keep the caps lock key    !
                ! depressed at all times.        !
                !________________________________!
              
    Ready, Set, Go!:
    ================
    
     To guide Snoopy, you can use: 
    
    -JOYSTICK:  Move  the joystick in the direction you want Snoopy to go.
    Press the lower button to make him jump. 
    
    -KEYBOARD: Press the left and right arrow keys  to  guide  Snoopy.  To
    make him stop moving press the SPACE BAR.  Press the Z key to make him
    jump. 
    
    Be  on  the look out for trap doors and drop-away bridges. Magic lamps
    shoot Snoopy to higher floors. Guide him carefully onto flying carpets
    and moving floors or he'll fall off. 
    
    A Special Tip about Jumps: 
    ==========================
    
    When approahing a jump, guide Snoopy  slowly  and  stop  him  when  he
    reaches  the  edge. Then make him jump. Completing some jumps requires
    that a portion of Snoopy's foot hangs over the edge.  Be  careful  and
    look before he leaps! 
    
    Here's the Strategy...: 
    =======================
    
    In order for Snoopy to escape safely from a level, he must: 
    
    *  Select  numbers from each of Morehairy's tricky number boxes to add
    up to the level's challenge number. 
    
    * Pass by the robot guards and deactivate them with one of Morehairy's
    magic keys. 
    
    * Avoid all other traps and snares. 
    
    Matching Morehairy's Challenge Number: 
    ======================================
    
    Morehairy has booby-trapped his castle. Each  level  has  a  challenge
    number.  Watch  it  appear  at  the  top of your screen. Unless Snoopy
    matches it, he cannot leave the level. 
     Along the game path are 5 boxes. In  each  box,  numbers  appear  and
    change.  1,  2,  3,  4....  Snoopy's  mission is to reach each box and
    choose a number from it.  The  chosen  numbers  must  add  up  to  the
    challenge  number  above. If Snoopy fails to freeze a number from each
    box or adds incorrectly, he must start the level over  with  one  less
    chance to save his friend. 
                     _________________________________
                    !                                 !
                    ! The challenge number is at the  !
                    ! top, middle of the game screen. !
                    !_________________________________!
                   
                   
    Freezing a number:
    ==================
    
    -JOYSTICK:  Position  Snoopy  over  the  box. When the number you want
    appears, press the top button on the joystick.  The number freezes. 
    
    -KEYBOARD: Use the arrow keys to guide Snoopy  over  a  box.  To  stop
    Snoopy  at the box, press the SPACE BAR key. To freeze a number, press
    the RETURN key. 
    
    Watch out for Green Robots: 
    ===========================
    
    If Snoopy runs into a green robot, he loses a turn and must begin  the
    level  again.  But if Snoopy reaches a magic key, the robot guard will
    turn red temporarily. Snoopy can safely deactivate the robot  when  it
    is red. 
    
    Count your Chances: 
    ===================
    
    Snoopy  has  only  five chances in each game to climb to the top of or
    escape from the castle. He gains  an  extra  chance  after  completing
    skill level one. You can keep track of how many chances he has left by
    counting the small figures at the top left of the screen. 
    
    Be  careful!  Snoopy loses a chance every time he meets a green robot,
    falls too far, slips into the moat,  or  fails  to  match  Morehairy's
    challenge number. 
    
    Practice Makes Perfect: 
    =======================
    
    You  can practice a level before you play it in a game. Begin play and
    when the first level appears, press the CONTROL (CTRL) and N  keys  at
    the  same  time.  Keep pressing the keys until you reach the level you
    want to pratice. 
    
    Success is.. Beginning Again: 
    =============================
    
    What happens when you've completed all 6 levels on one side and Snoopy
    has some chances left? You get to begin again, but the play is  harder
    and  faster.  The  6  levels on each side can be repeated as many as 4
    times. 
    
    
    Special Features: 
    =================
    
    Play ends when Snoopy runs out of chances or when you  choose  to  end
    the  game.  To  end  the  game, press the SHIFT and * keys at the same
    time. 
    
    The initials of the top 20 players can  be  added  to  the  scoreboard
    along  with  their scores and the number of levels completed. To erase
    the scores, type 911 at the Score Frame. 
    
    -SOUND: You can play with or without sound. To play  the  entire  game
    without  sound,  type  911 at the Random House screen before you press
    RETURN. 
    
    -PAUSE: To pause during play, press the ESC  key.  Press  any  key  to
    resume play. 
    
    -EARLY  OUT:  To end the game early, press the SHIFT and * keys at the
    same time. 
    
    -PRACTICE LEVELS: Press the CONTROL (CTRL) key and the N key until you
    reach the level you want to practice. 
    
    -FAILING TO EQUAL THE CHALLENGE NUMBER:  If  you  realize  you  cannot
    match the challenge number, press the CONTROL (CTRL) key and the Q key
    at the same time. Snoopy loses a chance and begins the level over.
