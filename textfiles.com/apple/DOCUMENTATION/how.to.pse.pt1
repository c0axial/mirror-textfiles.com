Proterm Special Emulation
-------------------------
  First of all ill just explain what this is, for those who dont know...

  PSE is a special 'Apple' emulation developed by the makers of Proterm (an
  apple Terminal program) they took the idea of DataMedia Emulation (the use
  of inverse blocks and characters over the modem for crude graphics further
  by adding the capability of also using the apple's built in 'Mousetext
  Characters'. This allowed for an interesting way to 'Liven' up Bbs', menu's
  were no longer just text, but now could be snazzy and eye-catching...
     To use Proterm special in the begining you had to have Proterm version
  1.9 or better, and you also needed a BBS that supported PSE. By setting the
  Emulation to 'Proterm Special' when calling a PSE Bbs, you would then see any
  PSE the board used... At first it was quite the trend, but like all things it
  died out eventually, and was seen here and there. But in the last few years
  it has come back into use for Bbs' and Advertisements for Bbs', along with
  some imagination, PSE was responsible for some of the best Bbs' seen...


'Emulation'
----------- 
Quick reference for using the Emulation

  [1] Boot up Proterm 1.9 or Newer (current is 2.2)

  [2] Once at the Main Menu, you must goto your dial list (cmd 'D') and choose
      or add a PSE Bbs.

  [3] If Editing an old Bbs dial data, you must choose 'EDIT'.
       
      Now press return untill the highlighter is on 'Status Bar:  Yes No'
      When using a PSE Bbs, it is best to turn off yuor status bar so that
      any PSE they use wont be messed up by the missing screen area... now
      rtn, This gives you the 'Terminal Emulation' Prompt, use your left and
      right arrow keys to flip through the supported emualtions until you
      find 'Proterm Special'. Press return until you are back at the 'Dial'
      prompt (Proterm will save the newly edited Spec's to Disk)

  [4] Now.. whenever you dial that BBS, you can view whatever PSE they have!



Proterm Special Charcters (Control & Moustext)
----------------------------------------------

   When using PSE, you have the ability to Turn on & off the different
functions such as 'Mousetext', 'Inverse', and Ascii. You do this by using
the Control characters given in chart [--A.1--] & [--A.1b--], These Control
Chars have various functions, from screen movment to Insert/Deletion.
Depending upon how you are typing up a PSE file, you might not have access
to most or all of these options. When using the Proterm Editor you may use all
of these options by pressing ::Open Apple 'P':: then you type the actual
Character needed (example: Open Apple 'P' + 'N'  this will show you the actual
character in inverse like this ) By using certain of these you turn on Sub
Functions like Mousetext, whatever is after the Ctrl-P in the file will be converted to its Mousetext Equivelent [Chart --A.2--] (Not all Keys have
Mousetext equivelents). 


Viewing PSE with Proterm outside of a BBS
-----------------------------------------

  [1] Boot Proterm 1.9 or Better
 
  [2] Use the 'Open Apple/Control/T' command to put Proterm into a fake
      Online Mode

  [3] Now use the Open Apple 'O' command to edit the online parameters.

         Press Return until you reach 'Duplex', change this to Half.
         Change the 'Status Bar' to -No- status bar. And then change
         the Emulation to 'Proterm Special'

  [4] Now use the Open Apple 'S' command (Send) and choose ASCII send

  [5] You can either send a PSE file from disk or from the Copy Buffer, so choose whichever. 

  [6] Now, Edit the ASCII send Parameters like this:

      Change the line width to 'AA'
      Use the left arrow key to change the Inter-Char and Inter-Line to '0'
      Now send... it should goto the screen, if not, recheck the Online
      parameters, and make sure you are in half duplex.

                          Pse Control Characters

  (OA-P = Proterms Open Apple 'P' Ctrl Char Command)
  (These PT keys -ONLY- work in Proterm, SS allows limited use of Ctrl Cmds)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ctrl Char's | PT Key's |              Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
          O      | OA-P 'O' | Turns on the 'Inverse' Command  (inv=on/mt=off) 
          P      | OA-P 'P' | Turns on the 'Mousetext' Command(Inv=off/mt=on) 
                 |          | (^^Look to chart [-A.2-] for Mousetext Info^^)
                 |          |
          N      | OA-P 'N' | Turns off both the Moustext and/or Inverse Cmds
          H      | OA-P 'H' | Move cursor Left one space
          U      | OA-P 'U' | Move cursor Right One Space
          K      | OA-P 'K' | Move cursor up one line
          J      | OA-P 'J' | Move cursor down one line
          I      | OA-P 'I' | Move cursor to next TAB (Tab's are every 8 spc's)
          A      | OA-P 'A' | Move cursor begining of line
          B      | OA-P 'B' | Move cursor to end of line
          X      | OA-P 'X' | Moves cursor to Home Position (0,0) w/o Clearing
          D      | OA-P 'D' | Delete cursor's current position
          F      | OA-P 'F' | Insert a space at cursor
          Z      | OA-P 'Z' | Delete Current line
          V      | OA-P 'V' | Insert a Blank line at cursor
          Y      | OA-P 'Y' | Delete from cursor's position to end of line
          W      | OA-P 'W' | Delete From Cursor to end of screen

          G      | OA-P 'G' | Sounds Apple's --Bell--

    The next chart [--A.1b--], contains more Ctrl Chars, but these require a
                better explaination, they are MORE involved

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
                              Chart [--A.1b--]
                        Control Characters:: Complicated
                  -------------------------------------------

Control 'R'::::[Repeat]::::::::

 This Control function is used when repeating one Character 3 or more times in
 a horizontal line (ie: Top of a box) it is used like so:

                       -------    AB   --------

    'A' stands for the Actual Character you wish to repeat
    'B' stands for the ascii equivelent of the number of times you want
        it repeated

     (ie: Line of 64 equal signs would be --> =@)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control 'T'::::[Tone]:::::::

  This is the PSE sound generator command, with some skill you can use this to
 play simple songs... it is used in this format:

                    ----------   T1T2D  ---------

                     'T1' stands for Sound Tone 1
                     'T2' stands for Sound Tone 2
                     'D' stands for Duration

   For a single tone use the same value for T1 and T2, dual tone use Diff
   values for both...

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control 'E':::::[PSE Detect]::::::

  This is sent out by a BBS to detect wether PSE is allowed by the User.
  If the user does have PSE active, a control-] is sent back (Ascii 29) 
  It gives an easy way to detect PSE users for ASCII/PSE BBS's

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control '^':::::::[Position]:::::::

  This is an easy way to Position the Cursor anywhere on the screen. It is
  used like this:

                          -------  AB  ------

     'A' stands for the Ascii equivelent of the Horizontal position +32
     'B' stands for the Ascii Equivelent of the Vertical position +32


   (ie::Positioning the cursor at ''horizontal=5 and Vertical=5'' would look
        like this:   5+32= 37 / Ascii(37) = %     ----->> %%  real easy!!)


                        Chart [--A.2--]

    The end.....

      Well, this is just file one, the next files will discuss techniques of 
 making Fast/small PSE files, as well and hints on animation

Also, there will be specific files or parts of files discussing the different
PSE editors out (Thier good & Bad points!!)
