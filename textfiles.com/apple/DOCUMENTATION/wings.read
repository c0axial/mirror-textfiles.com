               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Please make a point of reading through the Salvation-Wings User's Guide at least once before you go 'exploring'.  Salvation-Wings is a very large and capable program, and you may miss--or even misuse--some of its many features if you don't know all the details.

We recommend most strongly that you use the Installer program on the Supreme.B disk to install Salvation-Wings, MiniWings, and/or MicroWings.  There are some Wings-specific files that must be in the correct folders in order for things to work correctly.  The Installer scripts on theSupreme.B disk will assure that everything is copied to where it should be.

Also, please be aware that Salvation-Wings and MiniWings make extensive use of 'resources', which are special parts of certain files.  You must use a GS/OS- based copy utility in order to be sure that files with resources ar copied correctly.  Salvation-Wings does this perfectly, and so does the Finder.  Please, do not use any ProDOS 8-based copy utility to handle any Salvation- Wings files!
