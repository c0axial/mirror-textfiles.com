Skate or Die


You can use the mouse, joystick, or the keypad to control your skater.
The joystick gives the best control of your skater though.

Keys:
    S: sound on or off.
    A: abort current event and return to Rodney's Skate Shop.


Rodney's Shop

You start out in Rodney's where you need to register before you skate.
Just click on the on the "Sign-In" clipboard and then type in your name.
To remove a name click over it. Move the pointer around in the shop to make
any further selection. After leaving Rodney's just skate in the direction
of the event of your choice. Push the joystick forward to move in the
direction that your facing. Push left or right to go in one of those
directions. Pull back to slow, or stop completely.


Events


Downhill Jam: You fight time and your buddy(if you ain't got one we supply
Lester) to reach the main street first. Careful though, there's a reception
party waiting. The controls are like Downhill Race with Regular and Goofy
foot options available. Also, clicking while leaning the controller does
the clobbering stuff. Click and lean into the direction you're facing to
punch, either high, middle or low depending on where you're leaning the
controller.
Click and lean away from the directions you're facing to kick, either high,
middle or low. No bonus points if you skate longer than 4 minutes.



Downhill Race: Moving the controller forward with a click is a jump and
back is a duck. Click and left/right does a slide turn. There are no bonus
points if you skate longer than 4 minutes.



High Jump: While your in the ramp, move the controller rapidly in any
direction you want to build speed. You get a maximum of five passes on the
right side where the height marker is. To go for it and record your attempt,
click the button at the highest point of your jump.



Pool Joust: You get five passes to to get your opponent, then he takes the
boffing stick and gets a chance to slam you. The first one to get three
slams wins, but you have to win by two.



Freestyle Ramp: There's a hundred feet of wood and steel, carved into a
wide smooth U-shape. You start on the left platform, move the controller
forward or back to choose your entry point. After you drop in, you'll have
ten passes through the ramp, executing tricks at the left, right, or both
ends. As you make a pass, click the button in the pump zones to increase
your speed and to select a certain trick. Also, lean the controller into
or away from the direction your going.

Remember, one click in a pump zone counts as one pump. To get two pumps
in a pass, pump once in each zone.
