DreamGrafix is a Copyrighted program.  If you give anyone a copy, you are breaking the law.  If you give anyone a copy and we find out, we will not send you anymore updates to the program.  DreamGrafix has your name and a serial number encrypted within the program, so we can identify whose copy everyone has.  There are under 10 copies in circulation.  Depending on the severity, we may prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.  I wish I didn't have to include this, but this is our bread and butter, and if you give away copies, you are stealing from us.

On a brighter note.

What's New?
-----------
        After about two weeks of work, we have what is dubbed DreamGrafix v.5.  We call it v.5, but our version numbers are always up to date with the status of our program.  First, you may notice we have a new look.  A couple of items have been added to the bar, and some deleted.  DG now supports 4 levels of magnification in fatbits, and two grid modes.  The SBC 3200 (full color) has been redone, and now works perfectly with TWGS and ZIP GS.  SBC 3200 fatbits are in full color and this mode currently works, the other 3200 color fatbits is almost completed.  The palettes now follow in 256 and 3200 color modes, and hopefully, the current palette selected will stay on the screen more often.  We are very pleased with the progress made on the project, and have pushed back the final release date about a month.  We estimate the program will be done by the end of February or the beginning of March.


Docs
----
        The docs are formatted with AppleWorks v3.0.  They aren't totally complete, but they will give you an idea of what functions work, and what we will include in v1.0.  The quickreference basically describes the tool bar, and the buttons.  The current docs are 26 pages long.  If you are having problems reading the file into AppleWorks, try updating the ProDOS on the disk to the current revision, v1.9, which can be found on the System Disk in the System folder, and it is called p8, which must be renamed to prodos.
