                                Echelon Full Dox

                            Typed By: Codex Warrior

Operating Classifications:

There are three general classifications for operation of your spacecraft.

1. Scientific: Exploration and training without engaging enemy aircraft. To
activate this level of play do the following:

1 - Press the Data Link Key ( -> )
2 - Press '2' (Game Options)
3 - Press '1' (Combat)
4 - Press '1' (No Enemies)
6 - Press 'X' (Terminate)

2. Patrol: Encounter mild resistance from enemy spacecraft while exploring the
unknown. This is the normal playing level.

3. Military: For non-stop enemy attacks follow the steps outlined above patrol
except in step (5) choose:

'4' Medium or '5' Heavy or '6' Very Heavy

You may change classifications at any time, simply by re-entering the Data Link.

To return to Patrol Class, follow the same steps for the Scientific Class except
in step '5' select '3' (very light enemies).

Your Patrol Zone:

The ZONE is a partially explored region of the planet ISIS that is 840
kilometers square. Within the ZONE are 36 smaller regions called AREAS (6 rows x
6 columns).

Each AREA is 140 kilometers square and is also sub-divided into smaller regions
(14 rows x 14 columns). They are called Sectors and each is 10,000 meters
square. There are 196 sectors in each area.

Your Base Station:

Your base of operations is a fully equipped orbiting base station. The Station
is located in area B3, Sector G7 at altitude 10,000 meters. The orbit is
geosynchronous so that the base will always remain in a fixed location. You must
return here to Dock your spacecraft and receive more munitions or fuel or to
repair any damage.

Your C-104 Spacecraft:

This ship is state of the art technology in a space exploration and combat
vehicle. Your craft is equipped with twin laser fusion drive engines and three
100 ton magnetic flux generators. Two of these generators power the anti-gravity
hover system while the third unit powers the shield defense envelope. The fusion
drive engines use deuterium pellets for fuel and are capable of delivering 2
million pounds each of forward and reverse thrust.

Viewing Screens:

This vessel is completely computer monitored and controlled. Information from
the infrared and microwave scanners are fed to the computer for interpretation.
The computer then displays this information on two viewing screens. The main
screen shows point of view images of buildings, vehicles, terrain, etc. This
screen will also display a blue grid which indicates the planet's surface. You
can selectively shut off all or part of the surface grid. This is normally done
to increase the rate at which the display is updated.

The smaller screen is the top view or overhead view. This is the computer's
interpretation of an outside view looking down on your spacecraft.

Your ship is represented in outline form as 7 flashing dots. The dot in the
center locates the center of your spacecraft. The green vertical and horizontal
lines represent sector boundaries, the TOP VIEW can be turned on or off as
needed by press 'T'.

Note: When the RPV view is selected, both screens will display images from the
RPV's point of view.

Coordinate System

Your current location within the Zone is always defined in terms of AREA,
SECTOR, and then coordinates and altitude within the sector. Since each sector
is 10,000 meters across, coordinates are given as follows:

X Coordinate = 0 thru 10,000 (west to east)
Z Coordinate = 0 thru 10,000 (south to north)

Z = 10,000 __________________________________
          |                                  |

           X=0            X=5000          X=10,000

Your altitude will range from 0 at the planet's surface to a max of 13,500
meters. Your ship's computer will not allow you to leave the zone or to fly
above 13,500 meters without special authorization.

Velocity Indicators:

There are two sets of velocity indicators on your instrument panel. The display
on the left indicates forward or reverse velocity.

The display on the right is the vertical speed indicator and shows the rate of
climb or descent. Rate of climb or descent while hovering is also shown.

Zoom indicator:

Both the MAIN and TOP VIEW screens have zoom capabilities. When one of the Zoom
in or out keys are pressed, these indicators will show the amount of
magnification being used. Main screen zoom has a range of 1X normal to 16X max.
Top view has range of 1X normal to 22X max.

RPV View indicators:

If these console lights are white, they indicate that the main screen is now
displaying the view from the RPV camera. If lights are black, the main screen is
displaying the view from the C-104.

Scoring Indicators:

There are two separate scoring displays. The left display is the 'E' or
Exploration score. Points are awarded here based on credits received through
artifact and clue retrieval. The right display is the 'C' or combat score.
Points are awarded here based on enemy ships destroyed. You are also awarded
combat points for target practice and combat simulation. Virtually any structure
or terrain on the planet can be a target. However, the ship's computer will not
allow you to destroy structures that are not hostile. If you fire at a hostile
target, the computer will simulate the sequence on the screen. If the target was
hit the image will be removed from the screen and points will be awarded.

Weapons:

Laser: These anti-matter packets are suspended in a magnetic field until fired.
Once released, the disintegrate rapidly but are very effective at short range
(up to 4000 meters).

Photon Cannon: This unit is basically a very high intensity pulse laser. The
pulse power is supplied by rapidly discharging a P.C. power cell and the cell
casing is ejected after each round is fired. The cannons are good at short to
medium range (up to 4600 meters).

Missiles: These are medium to long range, solid fuel rockets with micro-nuclear
detonators. (Acronym: LRN). They have no external guidance system which
virtually neutralizes and electronic counter measure techniques (effective range
6300 meters).

Teleporter:

One of the most important functions of your spacecraft is teleporting objects
aboard. There are hundreds of objects in the Patrol Zone that contain
information needed to solve the maps and locate the Pirate Base. The RPV is also
retrieved by the teleporter. To teleport objects, use the following procedure.

1. Locate an Object -

Objects that are teleportable are shown as flashing hourglasses on the viewing
screen. From a distance the object appears as a small flashing dot.

Note: (to follow this procedure while attempting to teleport an actual object,
fly to area B-2, sector J-7)

2. Approach -

When an object appears on screen, it may be in the adjacent sector. Fly towards
the object and adjust your controls so that the object remains in the center of
the screen. When your spacecraft gets close, the object will begin moving more
rapidly. Lower your speed and altitude and continue your approach. If the
spacecraft continues forward when you are very near the object it may disappear
from the front view as the spacecraft begins to pass over it.

3. Activate 'Down' Screen -

To teleport an object, your spacecraft must be directly over it. Press the down
view key ('5') to activate the down screen. The down screen shows the object
directly below your spacecraft. There is a blind spot between front and down
view screens and when the object passes out of view from the front screen, it is
not immediately seen in the down screen.

4. Maneuver Your Spacecraft Over The Object -

If the object is in front of your craft, begin moving slowly forward so that the
spacecraft passes over the object. The object should now be visible on the down
screen. If the object passes outside the down view are, use the other views to
locate the object again. Use the down view teleport sight (small cross hairs) to
line up the object. Maneuver the spacecraft so that the object is still
partially visible when you are at or below 50 meters.

Note: Objects cannot be teleported unless your altitude is 50 meters or below.

5. Begin Teleportation Sequence -

Once the object is within teleport range (inside the screen are with the
spacecraft below 50 meters), press the Teleport Key ( <- ). This will activate
the teleport sequence and bring the object on board. If the object is not
properly lined up, the message "No object within range" will appear. This means
either your craft is too high (over alt. 50) or not enough of the object is
inside the screen area.

Combat

If you wish to battle enemy spacecraft, enter the Data Link Combat Section and
set enemy strength to a value other than 1.

The Planet is broken down into a number of Patrol Zones. Since there is only one
C-104 per zone, it's up to you to defend it. When your ship comes under attack,
a small audio signal will sound. Enemy spacecraft should be visible on the top
view screen. They will be identified as small dots moving toward your
spacecraft. Activate one of your weapons by pressing 'B', 'N' or 'M' and get
ready for combat.

The only direction your weapons fire is directly ahead. Look at the top view
screen and identify which of the enemy aircraft is the closest and position your
spacecraft to view the approach from the front screen. When you are hit by an
enemy weapon, the screen will flash white and strength will be taken from your
shields.

The RPV

The RPV is a remote piloted vehicle and is used for all types of exploration and
observation work outside the spacecraft. The RPV has its own propulsion system
and can fly in much the same manner as the C-104. It also has a camera that
allows the pilot to monitor the RPV's viewing area.

RPV Controls:

To deploy the RPV, the C-104 must be at alt. 00. Once on the ground, press the
'9' key. A message and the small figure in the lower left corner of the panel
will change color. The RPV will always be deployed to the north of you.

The RPV is operated by using the same controls that are used with the C-104. To
switch the controls from the C-104 to the RPV, press 'C'. The control indicator
should read RPV. Press 'C' again will change control back to the C-104.

To switch to RPV view, press '6'. If you have not moved the RPV from where it
was deployed, you will see the outside view of your spacecraft. To switch the
view back to the C-104, press one of the Ship View keys.

You can use the RPV to explore buildings and structures or to fly around the
sectors. The RPV responds to the controls in the same manner as the C-104. If
the RPV collides with the C-104, the RPV will be destroyed.

To retrieve your RPV, press the teleport key ( <- ). The C-104 must be in
control and you must be stopped.

Remote Control Flying

The tracking function allows you to fly the C-104 like a remote control
aircraft. To try this, do the following:

1. Set your altitude at 00
2. Deploy RPV
3. Switch to RPV view ('6'). You should see the C-104 in front of you.
4. Switch the controls to the C-104 ('C')
5. Press the Tracking Key ('0')

With the tracking on, the RPV will follow the C-104's flight pattern. If you get
disoriented or lose track of your position, simply stop the C-104, switch to
front view and press the teleport key. Your lost droid will be beamed aboard.

Training Courses

There are six different training courses designed to improve your skills in
flying and operating the spacecraft.

1. Touch and Go: The object of the touch and go course is to set your spacecraft
down on landing pads that are located in Area C-4, sectors H-6 through H-10.
Start on the arrow ( ---> ) located in sector H-5 and at altitude 200. The
landing pads are small yellow squares with a red X inside. They are located in
the sectors directly east. Begin moving forward and try to set your spacecraft
directly on top of the landing pad. This requires using the down screen view.
Positioning your spacecraft over the landing pads is very similar to positioning
your ship over teleportable objects. This course will improve your skills.

2. Floating Tunnel Obstacle Course: This course is also designed to improve
maneuvering skills but you also need to watch your altitude and pitch carefully.
The course is in Area A-3 and starts in sector F-7 at X=369, Z=1029, alt=534.
The course is a series of rectangles that you must fly through.

3. Aerial Target Range: The aerial target range is to increase your proficiency
in the use of weapons. There is a target range located in Area A-2, Sectors H-4
through H-10. Start at Sector H-3 X=7884, Z=5281, alt=5175. The object is to fly
through the range hitting as many targets as you can in the least amount of
time. There are 14 triangle type figures staggered from Sectors H-4 to H-10.

4. Target Range: The target range located in area B-2 starts in sector J-10  and
goes through several connected sectors. The object is to increase your weapon
proficiency by flying through the sectors hitting as many targets as quickly as
possible.

The Data Link

Press --> to request up-link to Echelon Headquarters. When the link comes on
line you have 4 selections from the main menu.

1. Docking
2. Game Options
3. Pirate Maps
X. Terminate

1 - Docking

1. Docking procedures: This gives instructions on how to re-dock once leaving
the base station. Any time during flight you can return to the base station to
re-energize your shields, get more fuel, ammunition or droids. Any damage that
your craft has sustained will be repaired.

2. Weapons and Fuel: This option allows you to select the amount of fuel and the
amount of ammunition for each of your weapons. This can be done up to the
maximum capacity (in weight) that can be held by the ship. To activate a
category press the Space Bar. Use the (+) or (-) keys to add or subtract the
amount of ammunition or fuel. To exit press '/'.

3. Default weapons/fuel: This option automatically selects the normal loading of
ammunition and fuel. You may then make adjustments if you wish. Press '/' to
exit.

2 - Game Options:

1. Combat: There are two choices you can make under this category.

- Enemy strength - This allows you to vary the enemy strength between 6
different levels.

- Structure Display - This allows you to either leave the structures or
buildings on screen during combat or to not display them during combat. Having
the structures not displayed speeds up game play.

2. Load/Save/Restart: This option allows you to SAVE a game in progress, LOAD a
previously saved game and resume play, FORMAT a disk, or RESTART a game without
re-booting. Please follow the instructions outlined on the screen carefully. You
cannot save games onto the Echelon disk.

3. Controls: This option allows you to select between keyboard and joystick
controls. The Default is keyboard. If you wish to use a joystick, you must use
this option to select joystick mode.

4 - Pirate Maps

This allows you to view the pieces displayed on the pirate maps. The maps start
with no information but gradually fill in each time objects are teleported.
There are six different maps and each is used to help locate the Pirate Base.


Docking

1. The main base is located in area B-3, Sector G-7. Fly to this location at an
altitude of 10,000 meters.

2. To get to the docking area, you must fly through one of the four entry bays.

3. Line your spacecraft up (at alt. 10,000 meters) directly in front of one of
the bay entry doors and slowly begin to approach the opening.

4. As your spacecraft begins to enter the bay, your speed will automatically be
reduced.

5. Keep your ship in the center of the entry bay. If you hit the sides of the
bay, you'll hear a thud. You cannot fly through the walls of the space station.

6. Keep an eye on your X and Z coordinates. When your coordinates are
approximately X=5000, Z=5000 at altitude 10,000 meters you have reached the
docking bay.


7. Rotate the spacecraft to a heading of 00 and the docking system will
automatically be engaged.

ISIS - The 10th Planet

                                History if ISIS

Scientists had long suspected the existence of a 10th planet. In 1821, 40 years
after the discovery of the seventh planet, Uranus, French Astronomer Alexis
Bouvard noticed that Uranus' observed position did not agree with its calculated
orbit. Uranus was being pulled slightly off course by the gravitational
attraction of an outer planet. This led to the search and discovery of Neptune,
the eighth planet. But the mass of Neptune did not account for the distortion in
Uranus' orbit so a search began for the ninth planet. When Pluto was discovered
in 1930, it's mass was much too small to fully account for Uranus' wobble, so an
earnest search for a tenth planet had been continuing at the U.S. Naval
Observatory (USNO) since the early 1980's. In 1996 a research team from the USNO
announced the discovery of Isis, the 10th Planet in out solar system. The
Planet's mass, approximately five times that of earth, was so sufficient in size
to effect the gravitational field of Uranus. Isis has a thin atmosphere made up
of primarily Oxygen, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen and Argon. Its orbit is elliptical
and it takes over 340 earth years to orbit the sun. The biggest surprise
however, was yet to come. In 2011, the first unmanned landing probe reached
Isis. The photographs and data sent back finally verified that Earth was not the
only planet where life has existed. Signs of an ancient civilization were
observed on the surface of the planet, but life was no longer present. Evidence
indicated a great cataclysm had taken place and large areas of the planet showed
incredible devastation. Upon analysis of the information, general consensus
among scientists was that since conditions were too harsh and too cold for life
to have evolved on the planet at its current position in our solar system, Isis
must have been part of another star system in the Universe. The star exploded or
died and the planets were released from the stars gravitational pull and
wandered off to different parts of the Universe. Isis traveled through space
until it was caught by the gravitational pull of our sun, thus becoming the
tenth planet.

                              Statistics for Isis:

Mean distance from Sun                      6.5 billion km
Period of orbit                             341 earth years
Period of rotation                          47 earth hours
Diameter                                    28,940 Km
Mass relative to Earth                      5.3
Surface gravity relative to earth           1.25

Historical Time Line

1996 - Discovery of 10th planet.

2011 - First unmanned landing probe reaches Isis - Discovers ancient
civilization once flourished on Isis when it was part of another Solar System.

2012 - United Nations organizes the International Space Federation (ISF).

2015 - First manned spacecraft sent to Isis.

2017 - Scientific team arrives on Planet. Discovery of Dylidium, a new element.

2020 to 2030- Five more scientific expeditions are made to Isis.

2031 - Development of Laser Fusion Drive, cuts travel time to planet to 1.2
years.

2035 - First Martian Colonies developed and settled.

2037 - Miners arrive to collect Dylidium and other precious metals on Isis.

2041 - Alphan War Period begins when an ISF spacecraft accidentally destroys and
alien vessel. Skirmishes between Alphan spacecraft and ISF spacecraft continue.

2043 - Major battle of Alphan war takes places over what is now Zone 106, Area
A-2. Five ISF spacecraft destroyed; three Alphan spacecraft destroyed.

2045 - Contact finally made with Alphan officials and a non-aggression pact is
reached. However, isolated random attacks still occur.

2054 - McAdams Penitentiary established on Isis. Prisoners of this facility are
used to mind Dylidium.

2056 to 2081 - Exploration and mining continues - Many new colonies established
between earth and Isis.

2082 - Prison riots occur at McAdams Penitentiary, 350 prisoners escape. Over
200 prisoners and guards are killed. ISF closes the Penitentiary.

2083 - Pirates begin raiding ISF facilities. Many pirates are believed to be
escapees from the prison. Others are colonists who have grown disenchanted with
ISF controls and regulations and want to set up their own systems of commerce.

2093 - Raid on Isis outposts continue. Pirates begin to control and dominate the
area. Pirates have developed sophisticated disruption equipment which allows
them to block communications between ISF spacecraft and their bases. In
addition, Pirate space craft are equipped with stealth capabilities and are
undetectable on long range scanners. The Pirates are not strong enough for a
full attack on the ISF, but their guerrilla tactics have become increasingly
more effective.

2094 - Establishment of ECHELON headquarters on Isis. Patrol Zones are set up to
cover selected areas of the planet. Eight of the more strategic Patrol Zones
have stationary orbit Base Stations for refueling, maintenance, supplies and
sleeping quarters. These Base stations are fully automated and have a level 3
perimeter defense system. Only top military personnel are assigned to Echelon.
Its presence on Isis will hopefully help the ISF regain control of this are of
space from the Pirates. 2095 - Major Thomas Allen attempts to infiltrate the
pirate organization. He is not heard from again. 2096 - The completion of a new
combat and exploration vehicle, C-104 Tomahawk. The C-104 spacecraft has the
latest in advanced weaponry and scientific equipment. A limited number of new
spacecraft being delivered to Echelon will be flown by only the best ISF pilots.


                           Your Mission - Classified

Briefing: Space pirates have been a problem to the ISF since their appearance
over a decade ago. Their past raids had mainly been restricted to isolated
spacecraft and outposts. Then three years ago, major technological improvements
in their equipment and weaponry occurred. Since then, their raids have become
more daring. Equipped with electronic disruption equipment and stealth
capabilities, they have caused an increasing amount of damage to ISF facilities.

The ISF established Echelon two years ago to regain firm control inside the
area. Progress, however, has been marginal. Major Thomas Allen was given the
task of infiltrating the pirate organization over 16 months ago, but his status
at this point is unknown. Pirates continue to use the element of surprise and
have enjoyed an increasing amount of success against ISF facilities throughout
the area.

Objective: Your assignment is to locate the Space Pirates Main Base of
operation. According to Intelligence reports, it is somewhere inside your Patrol
Zone. Your investigation requires to retrieve artifacts and information
throughout the zone to find the answer. Any pirate spacecraft spotted inside
your assigned area should be neutralized. Good Luck, Commander!

                                The Pirate Code

The Pirate base is somewhere inside your Patrol Zone. Finding the base will take
a great deal of 'detective work'. Through intelligence reports, we know that the
space Pirates have developed a secret code to encrypt all messages and
transmissions. Your teleporter's material analyzer is programming to decipher as
much of this code as possible. Many of the objects and artifacts that you
teleport aboard will contain writings and inscriptions. Some of these are clues
and many are written in Pirate Code. Breaking the code is essential to the
solution of the game.

                                 The Six Steps

We also know that the Pirates have developed a sophisticated cloaking system
which constantly keeps their base invisible and undetectable by our scanners.
Latest reports indicate that there is a special sequence of 6 steps that can be
performed to de-activate the cloaking devices. Apparently the designers set up
this sequence to serve as an emergency override in the event of a major
malfunction in the system. These steps must be performed in the proper sequence.
If any of the steps are executed out of order, one must start again.

                                  The Six Maps

Each of the six steps is represented by a map. The maps are in your Data Link
System. The Maps have no information to begin with, but portions of a map will
fill in each time an object is teleported aboard. Each map has a graphic and
text section. Every time an object is teleported, a new piece of text and
graphic will be revealed. (If you cash in the object for credit).

The Maps are identified by color. When an object is teleported, the computer
will give its description, the number of credits available, and the color of its
as xxxsociated map.

If you cash the object in for credit, the map will be shown and the graphic and
text pieces will appear. (Note: Be sure to save the game periodically. This must
be done to preserve the map pieces between playing sessions.)

When all the objects in the patrol Zone have been teleported, all 6 maps will be
filled in. The text with each map gives instructions on how to complete one of
the six steps. This text, however, is in pirate code and must be deciphered.

                           Completing Your Mission

To solve the mystery and complete your mission, do the following.

1. Fill in the maps by teleporting objects aboard your spacecraft.

2. Write down clues. Each map has its own important clues that pertain to that
particular map. Most important clues will be encoded.

3. Break the Pirate code and interpret the instructions for each of the 6 steps.
Scattered throughout the Zone are clues to the meanings of the Pirate Code.
These clues are on teleported objects as well as written on walls or buildings.
Each time you decipher a letter or number, write it down.

4. Determine the correct order of the steps. Once you finish all 6 maps and
break the code, you will be able to read the instructions on how to complete
each of the 6 steps. All steps involve flying to a specific point and performing
specific maneuvers with your spacecraft. If you successfully follow the
instruction for that step, a sign will be given. Thus you will receive 6 signs
for successfully completing 6 steps. There is a problem, however. You must
complete the 6 steps in a specific order to deactivate the cloaking system and
win the game.

Hint: Look for clues of the form: "Something PRECEDES something" These are very
important and should always be written down.

Hint: Each MAP graphic is important. It represents something within the zone and
is related to a 'Precedes' clue.

5. Complete the 6 steps in their proper order. As each step is completed, the
sign for that step will be given, but there will be no indication given as to
whether or not you are sill on the correct sequence. You will have to wait until
all 6 steps are completed to find out. If you find the proper order, you'll know
it. If not, try again. Use the PRECEDES clues. Without them, you may have a
rough time. There are 720 different combinations.
