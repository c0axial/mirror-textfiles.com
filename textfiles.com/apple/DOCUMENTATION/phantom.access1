    Well, here it is Phantom Access.  If you have it already, its most likely
Thanks to me, at least indirectly.  I got it at a TAP meeting from The Plague
earlier in the year and I have given it to whoever asked me, namely The
Watcher(Cap. Con ][), Celtic Phrost and a friend of Celtic's.  Since then I've
heard that these people have been giving to other people, they promised not to,
but I suppose I couldn't expect them not to(I did, after all...).
Its been years since all the hoopla really started and the point has become
moot, so I'm releasing it everyone.  The old TAP kids don't mind and I might
as well take this advantage to put my name in a nice big font, right?
TAP by the way is disbanded, perhaps there will be an annual get together,
but I doubt it.  Most of the stuff said about TAP wasn't true and has come
from me anyway.  For instance Chris, in Fall of the Modem World, called
me an idiot and then went on to directly copy my sometimes incorrect or
obselete information from Tap.Interviews II.
    Enough about that however.  Here is Phantom Access 5.7k, complete with
docs.  It's not really that big of a deal as you can see, and the nonsense
about it "not falling into the wrong hands" is just that, nonsense.
For years everyone who didn't know what it was wanted it, and people
who did know what it was didn't.  For example, Sigmund Fraud turned down
a copy.  Anyway, enjoy the program, let the big debate end (but now
I guess you'll all have to debate about just what kind of loser/leech/rodent
would give it out!).  Please give to everyone you know.  Also, enjoy the
title page I tacked on...(please disregard the insults on it, I meant them
as jokes....)
