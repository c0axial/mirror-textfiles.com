INTRODUCTION:
-------------


After a fun-filled day of  adventuring,  Quick-Draw  Adventure  Mapper
accepts  your hard earned data and makes a high-resolution map on your
printer. This map is the starting point for  your  next  outing.  Your
Quick-Draw map grows along with your knowledge of your adventure. 

The  Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper is a companion to any adventure game.
It supports the following features: 

1. Prints a high-res map showing all rooms and their connections. 

2. Draws each room showing the room title, the room #, or, both. 

3. Shows which room connections are "one-way". 

4. Adds new rooms and information at any time. 

5. Stores the mapping data for 4 adventures. 

6. Prints a summary of all adventure information. 

----------------------
HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------


An Apple ][/][+/][e with 48K or 64K of memory and a single disk  drive
are  required.  A dot matrix printer is required for to print the maps
and information summaries. 

Included in this file is a list of printers and  interfaces  supported
by  Quick-Draw  Adventure  Mapper.  Appendix  I shows how to configure
Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper for other printers and interface cards. 

--------------------
LOADING THE PROGRAM:
--------------------

Place the diskette in drive 1 and turn the computer on. The first time
it is loaded, Quick-Draw Adventure Mapper will automatically  run  the
configuration  program  which will allow you to change several default
settings and to specify your printer and interface. 

From then on, when QDAM is booted, it will begin with your selections.
If you wish  to  change  them  in  the  future,  or  if  someone  else
configured  your  copy, hit <ESC> immediately after booting. This will
run the configuration program. 

-----------------------
CONFIGURING THE SYSTEM:
-----------------------

During configuration, QDAM will ask you 7 questions, as follows:

[1] Your printer's name.
[2] Your printer interface's name.
[3] The slot your printer's interface is in.
[4] If your interface uses a second slot, the number it is in.
[5] Map printing option.
[6] Map entrance/exit display option.
[7] Map graphics density.

For items [1] and [2], you select your printer and interface from  the
list of supported peripherals. If your printer and/or interface is not
shown,  then  see Appendix I on how to customize QDAM for your printer
and/or interface card. The 3rd item is the slot your printer interface
is in (usually Slot 1). The fourth item is only required  for  certain
interface cards, such as the Versa-card, which use 2 slots. 

For  the  last 3, "Numbers", "Yes", and "Single" would be good choices
until you are familiar enough with QDAM to decide  you  want  anything
changed. Their purposes are fully explained in section 7. 

------
MENUS:
------

QDAM  accepts commands from the menu on the bottom line of the screen.
Typing the first letter in the command's name is all that is  required
to  specify  that  command.  Many  of  the commands will bring up more
detailed menus.

                    /___________/
                    

---------------
ROOM PLACEMENT:
---------------

QDAM uses a grid that is 19 rooms across by 13 rooms down for a  total
of 247 rooms per map. Rooms can be positioned anywhere on that map. 

Infocom  games, considered the most advanced have the following #'s of
rooms in their 13 adventurers: 

[01]    Zork I          110            [02]    Zork ][         086
[03]    Zork ///        089            [04]    Enchanter       074
[05]    Sorcerer        084            [06]    Starcross       086
[07]    Suspended       063            [08]    Planetfall      105
[09]    Deadline        051            [10]    Witness         031
[11]    Infidel         077

NOTE: This list does not include SeaStalker or Cutthroats. The numbers
here may also be deceiving. The # here are the # of internal rooms  in
the  programming,  many of which, in some cases, can not be entered by
the player. 

As you can see by the above list, 247 rooms is plenty for  almost  all
adventuring needs. 

------------------
MOVING THE CURSOR:
------------------

The  room selection cursor is positioned in the upper left corner when
the program is first booted. The cursor can be moved anywhere  on  the
upper  portion of the screen. The table below shows the keys that move
the cursor: 

  U  I  O

  J  *  K

  N  M  ,

The arrow keys may also be used on a //e.


----
ADD:
----

The ADD command places a room at the current cursor position. As  soon
as  you  press  the  "A"  key,  the  screen  should  flip  to the room
information entry display. The ADD command automatically moves you  to
this  new  screen  and  menu since you will usually want to enter room
information as soon as you add the room. For now, press the L  key  to
LEAVE and go back to the previous menu. 

There are 3 things you should now notice: 

1.   There  is a colored box in the center of the screen, representing
the room you just added. 

2.  The "SELECTED"  area  displays  blanks  instead  of  the  flashing
message:   "*  *  * EMPTY * * *". It is really displaying the title of
that room, but since we haven't entered a title yet,  there  are  only
blanks there. The "ROOM" number shows "1". 

3.  The menu is now different. The ADD command is now gone, and in its
place are DELETE, EDIT, and VIEW. 

Since  there  is  a  room at the current cursor position, we can't add
one. We can DELETE it, EDIT its information, or VIEW its information. 

Move the room cursor again. As you move  the  cursor,  the  "SELECTED"
indicator  will  change  between  the  empty  indicator and the room's
title. The menu will  change  depending  whether  the  current  cursor
position is on a room or not. 

Room  numbers are automatically assigned as the rooms are entered. The
lowest available number is always used. 

-------
EXTRAS: 
-------

The XTRAS command calls up another menu  containing  special  features
that will be explained later. 

-----
VIEW: 
-----

The  VIEW  command  displays  all of the information entered about the
currently selected room. 

-----
EDIT: 
-----

The EDIT command displays the same information as the ADD command  and
allows you to change any or all of it. 

------
LEAVE: 
------

The  ADD,  EDIT, or VIEW commands all bring up new menus. All of these
new menus have a LEAVE command, which  returns  you  to  the  previous
menu.

TEXT EDITING:
-------------

Most of the information entered into QDAM consists of text such as: 

- Room titles
- Items found in rooms
- Pathways or connections between rooms
- Comments about a room
- File titles for saving your information

The  text  editing  commands  are  explained  below.  In the following
section, you will have many opportunities to practice them. 


---------------
BASIC CONCEPTS: 
---------------


Text editing is always performed within  a  rectangular  area  of  the
screen, whose position is dependent on the information being supplied.
This  area  can  consist  of  a  portion of a single line or encompass
several lines on the screen. When multiple lines are involved, a  word
that  is too long to fit in the remainder of the line is automatically
moved down to the next line. 


-----------------
EDITING COMMANDS: 
-----------------


Only upper case characters can be  accepted.  Newly  typed  characters
replace  those  that previously occupied their positions. Some special
command characters are recognized: 

RETURN: 
-Signals the completion of all editing. The contents  of  the  current
editing area accepted as displayed. 

ESC: 
-Initiates  a  mode  that  allows  athe  cursor to be moved within the
current editing area. In this move, the "I" key will move  the  cursor
up  one  line  (or the beginning of the current editing area), the "M"
moves the cursor down one line (or to the end of the editing area) and
the "J" and "K" keys  move  the  cursor  one  spacve  left  or  right,
respectively. Any other key exits this mode. 

Arrow keys: 
-Moves the cursor one character in the direction of the arrow. 

Control-D: 
-Deletes  the  character  at the current cursor position.  All text to
the right of the cursor is shifted one  space  to  the  left.  If  you
delete  all  the characters in the text area, it will be treated as if
you deleted the item. Apple 2e users can use the  DELETE  key  and  it
will function the same as Control-D. 

Control-I: 
-Inserts  characters at the current cursor position. All characters to
the right of and including the cursor are shifted one character to the
right. The new character is placed to the left of the cursor. 

Control-R: 
-Restarts the editing  session  with  the  editing  session  with  the
original text. This allows you to recover what you started with if you
make extensive editing errors. 

Control-N: 
-Blanks  the  current editing error. If you want to replace everything
in the editing area, it's easier to start with a clean screen. 

Control-B: 
-Moves the cursor to the first character in the area  currently  being
edited. 

Control-E: 
-Moves  the  cursor  to the last character in the area currently being
edited. 

If you are not familiar with entering control characters, it's  really
very  easy.   To type the CTRL-D command, hold the CTRL key down while
pressing the "D" key.

--------------------------
ENTERING ROOM INFORMATION:
--------------------------

When you add or edit a room, you get the same display. For each  room,
you can enter: 

- Title of the room
- Items found in room
- Comments
- Pathways to other rooms

The  first  three  are  covered  in  this  section.   The next section
discusses pathways. 


------
TITLE: 
------


The TITLE command allows the 18 character room title to  be  modified.
When  a  room  is added, the title is initially blank.  Practice using
all of the text commands now. 

After entering the title, press the "L" key to return to  the  highest
level  menu  to  verify that the title you entered is displayed as the
selected room. 


---------
COMMENTS: 
---------


The COMMENTS command allows the comments area  of  the  screen  to  be
modified.  Notice that the comments area is located in a multiple line
text  editing area.  Enter some comments and observe how the words are
placed in the area. 


------
ITEMS: 
------


Up to eight items per room can be entered.  Each item name can  be  11
characters long.  The ITEMS command calls up one of three new menus: 

- If the items area is blank: 

  ADD LEAVE

- If there is at least one item, but less than eight: 

  ADD EDIT DELETE LEAVE

- If there are eight items: 

  EDIT DELETE LEAVE

The  ADD  command  adds  a new item to the end of the list.  The arrow
keys are used to position to a particular item.   The  DELETE  command
deletes  the  currently  selected  item.   The EDIT command allows the
currently selected item to be modified. 

Practice adding, editing, and deleting items.
